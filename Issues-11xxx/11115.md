Broadening the original description of the ticket:

The aim is to provide a Cython version of the cached_method decorator. There are three benefits:

1)
Speed (see timings in the comments)

2)
Using cached methods in Cython code.

3) Parent and element methods of categories

Let me elaborate on the last point:

In order to make full use of the parent and element methods of a category, it should be possible to define a *cached* method in the category, so that any object of that category inherits it *with caching*.

Currently, it fails as follows:

```
sage: class MyCategory(Category):
....:     def super_categories(self):
....:         return [Objects()]
....:     class ParentMethods:
....:         @cached_method
....:         def f(self, x):
....:             return x^2
....:
sage: cython("""from sage.structure.parent cimport Parent
....: cdef class MyClass(Parent): pass
....: """)
sage: O = MyClass(category=MyCategory())
sage: O.f(4)
16
sage: O.f(x) is O.f(x)
False
```

So, the method is inherited, but not cached.


**Apply:**
1. [attachment:11115_flat.patch]
2. [attachment:trac_11115_docfix.patch]

Note that, if you want to **remove** the patches after testing them, you need to do 

```
rm $SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/build/sage/misc/cachefunc.*
rm $SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/build/*/sage/misc/cachefunc.*
```
Otherwise, `sage -br` would not work.

The reason is as follows (compare #8611):

The cached method f has a getter method, that returns a `CachedMethodCaller` and tries to assign it to O as an attribute. That assignment fails. Hence, whenever f is called again, a new instance of the `CachedMethodCaller` is created. Note that before #8611, that was always the case (not very efficient).

Moreover, the cached method would try to cache its  return values in a dictionary assigned to O - again, it fails. So, caching can not work.

My suggestion is as follows.

We want, in particular, that caching works for the base classes Element and Parent. I propose to provide them with a public cdef method `__cached_methods` (a dictionary), that is used by the getter method of the cached method to store the resulting `CachedMethodCaller`, if storing it as an attribute fails. 

Concerning the cache for storing the return values of f: It can not be stored in a dict as an attribute of O. But by #8611, there is a dict O.f.cache that is used for storing anyway.

So, in a nutshell, it simply works (and I already have a patch that only remains to be documented).

I tried to extend that approach to `SageObject` (from which both Parent and Element inherit), but providing `SageObject` with cdef attributes will not work, since in some places there is a double inheritance, e.g., from `SageObject` and `list`.

... and documentation is hard, in particular for building the reference manual. See #9976.

The idea is: 
* Modify `doc/common/builder.py` so that it uses the utilities from `sage.misc.sageinspect` rather than the utilities from the `inspect` module, and modify the utilities from `sage.misc.sageinspect` so that they work on classes and methods (currently, they only work on class instances). That's #9976.
* Use Cython for cached functions and methods -- it relies on #9976, since otherwise the doc won't build correctly.

I guess I will be able to submit patches to both tickets tomorrow.

It took a bit longer than I originally expected, but I think it was worth it.

**__New Features__**

* An instance of a class deriving from Parent or Element can inherit a cached_method from its category, *without* breaking the cache, even if it does not allow attribute assignment.

* The cached_method decorator can, to some extent, be used in Cython code.

* Cached_method is a lot faster now. In fact, using the cached_method decorator on a Python class is *faster* than a hand-written cache for a Python method, provided that the arguments are given by name and not by position.

**__Examples__**

__Python__

The following code defines a category, and a Parent class that has a method with a hand-written cache and a corresponding cached method inherited from the category:

```
from sage.all import cached_method, Category, Objects, Parent

class MyCategory(Category):
    def super_categories(self):
        return [Objects()]
    class ParentMethods:
        @cached_method
        def cached_by_category(self, x=100, y=-1):
            return x*y

class MyPythonClass(Parent):
    def __init__(self):
        self._cache = {}
        Parent.__init__(self, category=MyCategory())
    def cached_by_python(self, x=100, y=-1):
        try:
            return self._cache[x,y]
        except KeyError:
            out = self._cache[x,y] = x*y
        return out
```

We do some sanity tests, and then show that the cached method is faster than the hand-written cache, unless we provide arguments by name:

```
sage: O = MyPythonClass()
sage: O.cached_by_category() is O.cached_by_category(100) is O.cached_by_category(x=100) is O.cached_by_category(100,-1)
True
sage: O.cached_by_python(y=1) == O.cached_by_category(y=1)
True
sage: O.cached_by_python() == O.cached_by_category()
True
sage: O.cached_by_python() is O.cached_by_python(100) is O.cached_by_python(x=100) is O.cached_by_python(100,-1)
True
```

Here are timings for the hand-knitted cache:

```
sage: timeit("O.cached_by_python()", number=10^6)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 630 ns per loop
sage: timeit("O.cached_by_python(100)", number=10^6)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 970 ns per loop
sage: timeit("O.cached_by_python(y=-1)", number=10^6)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.1 Âµs per loop
sage: timeit("O.cached_by_python(100,-1)", number=10^6)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.31 Âµs per loop
```
and here are the corresponding timings for the cached method inherited from the category:

```
sage: timeit("O.cached_by_category()", number=10^6)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 314 ns per loop
sage: timeit("O.cached_by_category(100)", number=10^6)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 954 ns per loop
sage: timeit("O.cached_by_category(y=-1)", number=10^6)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.93 Âµs per loop
sage: timeit("O.cached_by_category(100,-1)", number=10^6)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.06 Âµs per loop
```

__Cython__

You can not use arbitrary decorators in Cython. But it is now possible to wrap a Cython function by the cached_method and assign it as a method - one needs to explicitly provide its name, though. In addition, we provide a hand-written cache programmed in Cython.

```
from sage.structure.parent cimport Parent
from sage.all import cached_method

cpdef test_func(self,x=100, y=-1):
    return x*y

cdef class MyCythonClass(Parent):
    cdef dict _cache
    def __init__(self, category):
        self._cache={}
        Parent.__init__(self,category=category)
    cached_by_decorator = cached_method(test_func, name="cached_by_decorator")
    cpdef cached_by_cython(self,x=100,y=-1):
        try:
            return self._cache[x,y]
        except KeyError:
            out = self._cache[x,y] = x*y
        return out
```

It is a Parent class, and thus it can inherit parent methods from a category. Without the patch, the cache of an inherited cached_method would break, but now it is fine:

```
sage: C = MyCythonClass(MyCategory())
sage: C.cached_by_category(y=-1) is C.cached_by_category(100,-1)
True
sage: C.cached_by_decorator(y=-1) is C.cached_by_decorator(100,-1)
True
sage: C.cached_by_decorator(y=-1) == C.cached_by_category(100,-1)
True
```

The trick is that I introduced an attribute `__cached_methods` for Parent and Element, in which a cached method can be stored. The cache is (since #8611) stored as an attribute of the bound cached method.

While it is nice that cached_method works at all in Cython, the performance is not as good as I wish. Here are the times for the hand-knitted cache written in Cython:

```
sage: timeit("C.cached_by_cython()", number=10^6)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 242 ns per loop
sage: timeit("C.cached_by_cython(100)", number=10^6)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 538 ns per loop

**__Conclusion__**

The patch provides a considerable speed-up in a case where cached_method used before, so that cached_method is not only convenient but efficient. Also, it enables to use cached_method in a broader context; here, it is not particularly efficient, but it is convenient.

We want that decorated (in particular, cached) methods appear nicely in introspection and in the reference manual. Therefore, I like to have:

The problem is that you can not have double inheritance from extension classes if Python does not know whether the underlying data structures are compatible. So, if you have

```
cdef class SageObject:
    pass
```
(which is currently the case) then it is fine, such as here:

```
sage: cython('cdef class MySimpleObject: pass')
sage: class C(list,MySimpleObject): pass
....: 
```

But you get an error if you want to put more structure in it

```
sage: cython('''cdef class MyObject:
....:     cdef dict __cached_methods
....: ''')
sage: class C(list,MyObject): pass
....: 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

There are methods that are frequently called and just return a double-underscore attribute. It would be faster to achieve the same with a cached method! I guess this is because of the name mangling that takes place for double-underscore attributes.

However, that only holds when calling a method. Inside of a method, the double-underscore seems to be quicker:

```
sage: timeit('O.derived_from_underscore()')
625 loops, best of 3: 1.65 µs per loop

I think it would be worth trying to use this trick: Little methods returning a double-underscore attribute appear all over the place. See #9138 for one example.

One more idea: Currently, a cached method will modify its own `__doc__` attribute, and some care is taken that it gets the correct one. Is it really needed to store the documentation? After all, it can easily be retrieved from the wrapped function or method!

Certainly it does not happen very frequently that the documentation of a method (cached or not) is requested: It is when the documentation is built, and it is when the user wants to learn something.

So, computing and storing the documentation during initialisation of a cached method may be a waste of time and also a waste of memory. Instead, I suggest that the documentation is only computed in the method `self._sage_doc_()`. I am now testing if that helps, startuptimewise.

In order to be on the safe side, I made some timings for the patches from #9138 (on top of #9944), and I'd like to repeat these timings here, with this patch applied additionally.

```
$ ./sage -startuptime
...
## Slowest (including children)
1.244 sage.all (None)
0.280 sage.schemes.all (sage.all)
0.243 sage.misc.all (sage.all)
0.162 elliptic_curves.all (sage.schemes.all)
...
```
So, there is no slow-down, compared with the timings from an unpatched Sage on the same machine, as reported on #9138.


Here is an arithmetical example:

```
sage: B.<t> = PolynomialRing(Integers(125))
sage: R = monsky_washnitzer.SpecialCubicQuotientRing(t^3 - t + B(1/4))
sage: x, T = R.gens()
sage: timeit('x*T')
625 loops, best of 3: 893 µs per loop
```
That is about the same as with the patches from #9944 and #9138, but slower than with an unpatched Sage.

I found that one can use the improved cached_methods to considerably speed up the arithmetics. Namely, in the multiplication, the method `modulus()` from sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_ring is called repeatedly. The `modulus()` method returns ´self.basering().characteristic()`. When I put that method under a cached_method decorator, the timing looks much better:

```
sage: B.<t> = PolynomialRing(Integers(125))
sage: R = monsky_washnitzer.SpecialCubicQuotientRing(t^3 - t + B(1/4))
sage: x, T = R.gens()
sage: timeit('x*T')
625 loops, best of 3: 253 µs per loop
```
That is much faster than without patches, which is 501 µs!!.

Currently, I try to find some places where using a cached_method might be beneficial. As I have demonstrated in previous posts, there are chances to speed methods up that do nothing more but "`return self.__some_argument`".

But independent of that possible second patch, I think the first patch can be reviewed.

I improved the performance of accessing the cache even further.

It is quite common to have methods that do not take arguments but whose return value should be cached. Typical example is the set of generators of a multivariate polynomial ring. Since sage-4.7.alpha5, it is a cached method.

Obviously, if a method takes no arguments, then caching the single value is much easier than storing the results in a dictionary for different arguments. I implemented this special case in a class `CachedMethodCallerNoArgs`. It is automatically used if `@cached_method` is a applied to a method without arguments. In particular, one does not need to do changes in the code.

Here is the performance. Bot `I.groebner_basis` and `I.gens` are cached methods (you need to take sage-4.7.alpha5 for the example):

```
sage: P.<a,b,c,d> = QQ[]
sage: I = P*[a,b]
sage: I.gens()
[a, b]
sage: I.groebner_basis()
[a, b]
sage: type(I.gens)
<type 'sage.misc.cachefunc.CachedMethodCallerNoArgs'>
sage: type(I.groebner_basis)
<type 'sage.misc.cachefunc.CachedMethodCaller'>
sage: timeit('I.gens()',number=10^6)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 170 ns per loop
sage: timeit('I.groebner_basis()',number=10^6)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 250 ns per loop
```

That is much faster than with an unpatched sage-4.7.alpha5:

```
sage: P.<a,b,c,d> = QQ[]
sage: I = P*[a,b]
sage: I.groebner_basis()
[a, b]
sage: I.gens()
[a, b]
sage: timeit('I.gens()',number=10^6)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 699 ns per loop
sage: timeit('I.groebner_basis()',number=10^6)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 746 ns per loop
```

To give you an idea of how fast 170 ns or 250 ns are:

```
sage: class MyClass:
....:     def __init__(self):
....:         self._v = 10
....:         self.__v = 10
....:     def m0(self):
....:         return 10
....:     def m1(self):
....:         return self._v
....:     def m2(self):
....:         return self.__v
....:     
sage: O = MyClass()
sage: timeit('O.m0()')
625 loops, best of 3: 1.01 µs per loop
sage: timeit('O.m1()')
625 loops, best of 3: 622 ns per loop
sage: timeit('O.m2()')
625 loops, best of 3: 621 ns per loop
```

Note that the cache is pickled -- see examples in the doc strings.

There is one further extension. There is a class `sage.misc.cachefunc.ClearCacheOnPickle`, whose purpose is quite nice: If you have a class that inherits from `clearCacheOnPickle` then the cached values will *not* be pickled.

That is to say: Let X be an instance of ClearCacheOnPickle and assume that its pickling is implemented using the `__get_newargs__` and `__get_state__` mantra. Then, the cache of any cached method of `loads(dumps(X))` will be empty (but of course the cache of X is preserved).

Depends on #9976

I just updated the patch, because I noticed the following: If you have an old pickle of an object with a cached method then of course the pickle will contain the cached value. If you unpickle then it may be that an old `CachedMethodCaller` becomes a new `CachedMethodCallerNoArgs`.

It would thus be nice if `CachedMethodCallerNoArgs` could retrieve the cache value of an old pickled `CachedMethodCaller`. This is implemented in the new patch.

What I did to test it:

1. Without the patch applied, do

```
sage: P.<a,b,c,d> = QQ[]
sage: I = P*[a,b]
sage: I.gens()  # this is in order to fill the cache - it is a CachedMethodCaller
sage: save(I,'pickletest')
```

2. With the patch applied, do

```
sage: I = load('pickletest')
sage: I.gens.cache   # this is now a CachedMethodCallerNoArgs
[a, b]
```
So, the cache is already filled after unpickling.

Yeah! I have been dreaming of this performance improvement since 2008!

Altogether, my only reluctance on this patch is about the addition of
an attribute to all Sage elements. This sounds like a non trivial
increase of the memory footprint for small objects like finite field
elements. I don't have an opinion about this myself, but this
definitely requires a discussion on sage-devel.

Parents are big objects, so this is not an issue for those.

Simon: you are doing way too much good stuff for me to follow!
Honestly, I feel a bit lost about where to start. Do you mind making a
prioritized list of patches that need review, say on the category
roadmap [1]?

Thanks!

Cheers,

If no cached methods are used (more precisely: if they are not called), then `__cached_methods` should just be None (i.e., nothing more but a pointer, if I understand correctly). So, that's one word per object. If you do call cached methods then of course you need to store them somewhere.

My main aim is the letterplace wrapper #7797.

It needs support for ideals in non-commutative rings. That is #11068.

Since there are rings that do not inherit from sage.rings.ring.Ring, we need to move (or duplicate?) methods from there in sage.categories.rings.Rings.ParentMethods. That includes cached methods -- but there are rings that do not allow attribute assignment. This is why I originally opened this patch, #11115 (in the beginning, it was not so much about performance).

In order to have cached methods (in particular the argspec) appear nicely in the documentation, we need #9976, which already has a positive review.

Moving stuff from sage.rings.ring.Ring to sage.categories.rings.Rings.ParentMethods instead of duplicating can only work if *all* rings use the category framework. That's the purpose of #9138, with a small part already done in #9944.

So, my personal roadmap is simply:

```
  #9944            #9976
  #9138           #11115
         #11068
         #7797
```
After that, I can finally start with my main project: Compute Ext algebras for finite dimensional path algebra quotients.

I inserted my favourite tickets into the section "Later patches related with or using categories:" (renaming that section, since not all of them *use* categories, but all of them *relate with* the category framework).

The tickets depend on each other, thus, the priorities are implicit.

Thanks! By the way, did you include there all the patches about morphisms?

Unfortunately, there was no reaction from sage-devel, and my question has already disappeared from the first screen.

I see an alternative to a new attribute `__cached_methods` for all elements: Since that attribute will only be used if the element does not allow attribute assignment, and since only few element classes use cached methods, it might be a good compromise to introduce the `__cached_methods` attribute only in those derived classes that really need it.

Hence, you would write

```
cdef class MyElementClass(Element):
    cdef public dict __cached_methods
    cdef ...
    def __init__(...)
```
if `MyElementClass` does not accept attribute assignment but is supposed to inherit cached methods from the category framework.

I do suggest to keep the additional attribute for sage.structure.parent.Parent, though. As you said, parents are big and rare enough that an additional attribute is no real burden.

It occured to me that I did not yet provide an example to show cached methods for elements that do not allow attribute assignment:

```
sage: cython("""from sage.structure.element cimport Element
cdef class MyElement(Element):
    cdef object x
    def __init__(self,P,x):
        self.x=x
        Element.__init__(self,P)
    def __neg__(self):
        return MyElement(self.parent(),-self.x)
    def _repr_(self):
        return '<%s>'%self.x
    def raw_test(self):
        return -self
""")
sage: class MyCategory(Category):
    @cached_method
    def super_categories(self):
        return [Objects()]
    class ElementMethods:
        @cached_method
        def test_cache(self):
            return -self
sage: class MyParent(Parent): pass
sage: C = MyCategory()
sage: P = MyParent(category=C)
sage: e = MyElement(P,5)
sage: e
<5>
sage: -e
<-5>
# This is inherited from the category, ...
sage: e.test_cache()
<-5>
# ... and the cache works, ...
sage: e.test_cache() is e.test_cache()
True
# ... even though you can't set attributes:
sage: e.bla = 1
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
AttributeError: '_mnt_local_king__sage_temp_mpc622_25602_tmp_1_spyx_0.MyElement' object has no attribute 'bla'
# By lack of "setattr", the cache is not as fast as it could be, ...
sage: timeit('e.test_cache()')
625 loops, best of 3: 1.62 Âµs per loop
# ... but it is faster than to create a new element
sage: timeit('e.raw_test()')
625 loops, best of 3: 1.78 Âµs per loop
```

At sage-devel, Martin Raum suggested to time element creation (if I understood his suggestion correctly).

I found without patch:

```
sage: K = GF(101)
sage: get_memory_usage()
839.96484375
sage: %time for i in xrange(10^7): a = K(i)
CPU times: user 25.19 s, sys: 0.01 s, total: 25.21 s
Wall time: 25.20 s
sage: get_memory_usage()
839.96484375 
```
and with patch

```
sage: K = GF(101)
sage: get_memory_usage()
841.96875
# show that the new attribute is there, but it is non-initialized
sage: a=K(4)
sage: print a.__cached_methods
None
sage: %time for i in xrange(10^7): a = K(i)
CPU times: user 24.46 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 24.46 s
Wall time: 24.46 s
sage: get_memory_usage()
841.96875 
```

So the time actually improved with the patch, and the memory usage at starting sage increased by as much as 0.24% - I hope that can be afforded.

There was rather little feedback on sage-devel.

The example above shows that the increase of memory consumption - at least directly after starting sage - is certainly tolerable. The performance gain is obvious.

There remains the question what we shall do with elements versus element class of a category. Options:

 1) Do what the patch suggest. Then, every instance of Element can inherit a cached method from the element class of a category, regardless whether it accepts attribute assignment or not. The cached method will be more efficient if you can assign attributes, but at least the cache won't break.

 2) Do not support the inheritance of cached methods from the category to elements that don't support attribute assignment.

 3) A combination of 1) and 2): If the user defines an attribute `__cached_methods` for its element, then it could inherit cached methods from the element class of a category.

I already stated what I'd prefer.

By the way, I just noticed that elements can currently (with or without the patch) *not* inherit a cached_in_parent_method. Reason:

```
sage: class MyCategory(Category):
....:     def super_categories(self):
....:         return [Objects()]
....:     class ElementMethods:
....:         @cached_in_parent_method
....:         def test_cache(self):
....:             return -self
....:         
sage: C = MyCategory()
sage: C.element_class.test_cache
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'parent'
```

I think I could make it work. Should I do that here, or better on a different ticket (which depends on this)?

The new patch is posted. Apart from fixing the categorical trouble with cached_in_parent methods, it turns several doc strings into raw strings (they contain backslashes). Please look at the documentation (I'll build it as well)!

Here is the new doc test, demonstrating that cached_in_parent works with categories:

```
sage: cython_code = ["from sage.structure.parent cimport Parent",
... "from sage.structure.element cimport Element",
... "from sage.all import Category, cached_in_parent_method",
... "cdef class MyElement(Element):",
... "    cdef object x",
... "    def __init__(self,P,x):",
... "        self.x=x",
... "        Element.__init__(self,P)",
... "    def _repr_(self):",
... "        return '<%s>'%self.x",
... "    def __neg__(self):",
... "        return MyElement(self.parent(),-self.x)",
... "    def __hash__(self):",

sage: C = MyCategory()
sage: P = MyParent(category=C)
sage: e1 = MyElement(P,5)
sage: e2 = MyElement(P,5)
sage: e3 = MyElement(P,6)
```    
We verify that attribute assignment does not work:

```
sage: e1.bla = 1
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
AttributeError: '...MyElement' object has no attribute 'bla'
sage: P.bla = 1
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
AttributeError: '...MyParent' object has no attribute 'bla'
```
Nevertheless, the cached method works, and it returns identical
output for equal elements, as expected:

```
sage: e1.test_cache()
<-5>
sage: e1 is e2
False
sage: e1 == e2
True
sage: e2.test_cache() is e1.test_cache()
True
sage: e1 == e3
False
sage: e2.test_cache() == e3.test_cache()
False
```

Back to the discussion about attributes: It is due to the `__cached_methods` attribute of `P` that the cache does not break in the example. It is not needed that the elements have that attribute.

Depends on #9976

I think that the current behaviour of the patch regarding cache storage is just fine. Getting more memory tends to be much easier and cheaper than getting a faster CPU.

I was avoiding using `@cached_method` before due to its issues with speed and documentation, but have started using it recently and it is so convenient! The more general, convenient, and well-behaved these decorators are, the more developers will adapt them.

While in principle it is not too much of a hassle to insert an extra attribute into your new class, it is quite annoying to always remember that if you decide to put a decorator on some method you have also to check if there is that extra attribute already defined or not.

Hi Andrey,

Replying to [novoselt](#comment%3A28):
> And as I understand, things don't break if you forget to do it, they just work slower than they should.


What scenario does your statement refer to? (1) The status quo, (2) the patch as it is, or (3) the patch without `sage.structure.element.Element.__cached_methods`?

Here is my view on these three:

(1) Cached methods have been improved in #8611, but they are still not fast enough, for my taste. Time and memory is wasted by assigning a `__doc__` string to each instance of a cached method (that is noticeable in the startup time). It can only be used in Python code. If a parent or an element does not accept attribute assignment then it can inherit a cached_method from the category -- but the cache breaks *and* there is a huge overhead. cached_in_parent_method can not be inherited from the category at all.

(2) cached_method can compete with a hand-written cache in Python, speed-wise, provided that attribute assignment is possible. `__doc__` is now replaced by `_sage_doc_`, which is used by sage's introspection anyway and computes the docstring only when requested. It can, to some extent, be used in Cython code. If a parent or an element does not accept attribute assignment then it can inherit a cached_method from the category: The return values *are* cached ("things don't break), but there is an overhead (though much less than in (1)). The price to pay is 0.24% more memory consumption at startup. cached_in_parent_method can be inherited from the category.

(3) (Hypothetical) Cached methods are supported for elements only if either the element allows attribute assignment, or the user did not forget to provide it with a public attribute `__cached_methods`. If neither of these conditions hold then things behave as in (1), for elements. In particular, for an element that does not satisfy the conditions, the cache of cached_method will break and will have a huge overhead. However, cached_in_parent_method is fully supported (that is since the cache is in the parent, and parents *have* `__cached_methods` in scenario (3)).

So, the memory consumption in that scenario does not increase at all, and there is a little speedup.

Hi Simon, I was referring to (3) here, although I probably phrased it ambiguously. By "don't break" I meant that, as I understand, Sage will work and produce correct results if a user forgets to add a special caching attribute. But the cache *will* break and the speed will be lower. So I think that (2) is a better option.

If I am not mistaken, creation of elements for "small" and "big" fields is somewhat different, something like all elements are created and stored somewhere for small fields, but for big ones they are created one-by-one.

Personally, I think that even 10% is fine in memory increase if it leads to an efficient and uniform caching...

Responding to http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/msg/0aa5aca883603f64

Most machines have a limited resource (CPU cache) which means that in general, one expects that applications with a smaller memory footprint should have a tendency to run a bit faster. Given that I would have a slight preference towards option (3), i.e., keep elements small.

These things are notoriously difficult to quantify and are very processor dependent - good implementations of linear algebra libraries have to be tuned to be cache-friendly on each architecture.

The general principle is the following: General memory access is relatively slow, so CPUs have a cache (nowadays several levels) of fast memory so that repeated access to the same memory locations doesn't have to go all the way to main memory and can be done faster.

This works because memory usage tends to be temporally and spatially local. (temporal: the same memory locations tend to be accessed frequently before moving on; spatial: programs tend to access memory locations that are close together).

Making elements bigger will reduce both: If a CPU has enough cache to store N words and an element occupies s words, then a program will run quickly if its inner loop refers to at most N/s elements. As soon as it refers to more, the cache starts thrashing and you'll notice a poorer performance. As you see, small s is better. Your proposal would change s to s+1 ...

The spatial component comes in because caching rarely happens with a resolution of single words (because the overhead of storing which memory locations are cached). That's why it's good to have related data stored in consecutive memory. Increasing s also reduces that ... (apart from the fact that Python does not give us control over location of allocation anyway, but we can hope Python does this sanely).

Again, this is notoriously hard to quantify, but if you fix the problem and the architecture one can usually recognise drops in performance as data size increases, due to the different levels of cache starting to thrash. So, in general, small elements are better, both for memory use and for performance.

Just to make sure that the CPU cache effect is real, I tried a little example

```
%cython
cpdef test(int nelts,int spacing,int repetitions):
    cdef int i,j,r
    cdef int *L
    cdef int k
    L=<int*>malloc(sizeof(int)*nelts*spacing)
    for r in xrange(repetitions):
        k=0
        for j in xrange(nelts):
            L[k]=L[k]+1
            k += spacing
    free(L)
```
The following program times incrementing memory cells `2^30` times, while varying the number of cells (nelts) and their spacing in memory (spacing).

```
for j in xrange(0,9):
    for i in xrange(1,29-j):
        tstart=os.times()[0]
        test(2**i,2**j,2**(30-i))
        tstop=os.times()[0]
        print [i,j,30-i,tstop-tstart]
```
The results are striking. Execution times vary by more than a factor 20 and one can see very definite thresholds where the execution time jumps. An excerpt from the output:

Hi Nils,

Replying to [nbruin](#comment%3A35):
> Just to make sure that the CPU cache effect is real, I tried a little example


Thank you for your clear explanation! I am currently testing some variations of my patch: Both for parents and for elements, one may or may not have `__cached_methods` - if one has, then it can always inherit cached methods from the category framework. And if one has the attribute, then one may or may not search it in the `__getattr__` method - if one does then the speed penalty for missing attribute assignment is reduced.

I can already confirm that the timings are affected by the presence of the attribute. But I first need to finish my tests.

    "body": "<a id='comment:37'></a>\nMy tests seem to indicate that (at least on my CPU) `__cached_methods` for parents does not hurt, but `__cached_methods` for elements can yield a slow-down. Changes in the `__getattr__` methods of parents or elements did not yield a significant slow-down.\n\nSo, I think it is a good idea to have `__cached_methods` for parents. It makes me wonder whether such attribute could serve an additional purpose: If the method resolution order does not find an attribute of a parent then it is searched in the category, by `getattr_from_other_class`. That takes a lot of time. So, shouldn't there be a shortpath so that looking up the same attribute becomes faster the second time?\n\nThat's to say: If a parent `P` inherits any attribute `foo` from the category then I suggest that `P.foo` should be stored in `P.__cached_methods[\"foo\"]`. `__getattr__` needs to search `P.__cached_methods` anyway, and a lookup in a dictionary should be faster than calling `getattr_from_other_class`.\n\nConcerning elements, it meanwhile seems better to not have `__cached_methods` by default. But it should be possible that it is provided by the user, so that cached methods inherited from the category can be stored there. The `__getattr__` of elements will test whether there is `__cached_methods` and search there.\n\nSo far, my tests indicate that the above approach is fine, speed-wise and memory-wise. My test is:\n\n```\na = get_memory_usage()\nK = GF(2)\n%time L = [K(i) for i in xrange(10^7)]\nget_memory_usage() - a\na = get_memory_usage()\nK = GF(101)\n%time L = [K(i) for i in xrange(10^7)]\nget_memory_usage() - a\na = get_memory_usage()\nK = GF(next_prime(10^6))\n%time L = [K(i) for i in xrange(10^7)]\nget_memory_usage() - a\n```\n\nSo, it is formed by three scenarios. I first give the user CPU time and the memory consumption for sage-4.7.alpha5 plus the patches from #9976:\n\n```\n25.28 s, 78.49609375\n25.11 s, 0.0 # so, GF(101) needs the same amount of memory than for GF(2)\n88.20 s, 794.9375\n```\n\nHere are the same data for the current patches (i.e., with `__cached_methods` for both parents and elements):\n\n```\n25.73 s, 78.49609375\n25.11 s, 0.0\n92.89 s, 864.21484375\n```\n\nAnd here are the same data for a (not yet posted) patch that implements the ideas sketched above:\n\n```\n25.33 s, 78.49609375\n24.49 s, 0.0\n87.13 s, 794.93359375\n```\n\nI'll first catch some sleep, then I will add documentation about the use of `__cached_methods`, and of course I also need to run doctests.",

<a id='comment:37'></a>
My tests seem to indicate that (at least on my CPU) `__cached_methods` for parents does not hurt, but `__cached_methods` for elements can yield a slow-down. Changes in the `__getattr__` methods of parents or elements did not yield a significant slow-down.

So, I think it is a good idea to have `__cached_methods` for parents. It makes me wonder whether such attribute could serve an additional purpose: If the method resolution order does not find an attribute of a parent then it is searched in the category, by `getattr_from_other_class`. That takes a lot of time. So, shouldn't there be a shortpath so that looking up the same attribute becomes faster the second time?

That's to say: If a parent `P` inherits any attribute `foo` from the category then I suggest that `P.foo` should be stored in `P.__cached_methods["foo"]`. `__getattr__` needs to search `P.__cached_methods` anyway, and a lookup in a dictionary should be faster than calling `getattr_from_other_class`.

Concerning elements, it meanwhile seems better to not have `__cached_methods` by default. But it should be possible that it is provided by the user, so that cached methods inherited from the category can be stored there. The `__getattr__` of elements will test whether there is `__cached_methods` and search there.

So far, my tests indicate that the above approach is fine, speed-wise and memory-wise. My test is:

```
a = get_memory_usage()
K = GF(2)
%time L = [K(i) for i in xrange(10^7)]
get_memory_usage() - a
a = get_memory_usage()
K = GF(101)
%time L = [K(i) for i in xrange(10^7)]
get_memory_usage() - a
a = get_memory_usage()
K = GF(next_prime(10^6))
%time L = [K(i) for i in xrange(10^7)]
get_memory_usage() - a
```

So, it is formed by three scenarios. I first give the user CPU time and the memory consumption for sage-4.7.alpha5 plus the patches from #9976:

```
25.28 s, 78.49609375
25.11 s, 0.0 # so, GF(101) needs the same amount of memory than for GF(2)
88.20 s, 794.9375
```

Here are the same data for the current patches (i.e., with `__cached_methods` for both parents and elements):

```
25.73 s, 78.49609375
25.11 s, 0.0
92.89 s, 864.21484375
```

And here are the same data for a (not yet posted) patch that implements the ideas sketched above:

```
25.33 s, 78.49609375
24.49 s, 0.0
87.13 s, 794.93359375
```

I'll first catch some sleep, then I will add documentation about the use of `__cached_methods`, and of course I also need to run doctests.

I just noticed that the additional attribute for parents could actually serve a third purpose: Providing lazy attributes for parent extension classes!

Namely, lazy attributes rely on the possibility to assign attributes. At least in the case of parent classes, if attribute assignment is impossible, they could do the next best thing and store stuff in `__cached_methods`!

Element creation__\n\nThis is with patch. I indicate the corresponding timings without patch in the comments:\n\n```\nsage: a = get_memory_usage()\nsage: K = GF(2)\nsage: %time L = [K(i) for i in xrange(10^7)]\nCPU times: user 25.23 s, sys: 0.02 s, total: 25.25 s\nWall time: 25.26 s  # without patch: 25.52 s\nsage: get_memory_usage() - a\n78.49609375   # same as without patch\nsage: a = get_memory_usage()\nsage: K = GF(101)\nsage: %time L = [K(i) for i in xrange(10^7)]\nCPU times: user 25.13 s, sys: 0.03 s, total: 25.16 s\nWall time: 25.16 s  # without patch: 26.20 s\nsage: get_memory_usage() - a\n0.0\nsage: a = get_memory_usage()\nsage: K = GF(next_prime(10^6))\nsage: %time L = [K(i) for i in xrange(10^7)]\nCPU times: user 87.40 s, sys: 0.24 s, total: 87.63 s\nWall time: 87.64 s   # without patch: 88.87 s\nsage: get_memory_usage() - a\n794.94140625   # without patch: 794.94921875\n```\n=> no slow down.\n\n__3. Cached methods in Python code__\n\nHere, I consider existing code, namely `gens()` and `groebner_basis()` for multivariate polynomial ideals. Again, the timings are with patch, the old timings are in comments\n\n```\nsage: P.<x,y> = QQ[]\nsage: I = P*[x,y]\nsage: timeit('I.gens()',number=10^7)\n10000000 loops, best of 3: 142 ns per loop\n# Without patch:\n# 10000000 loops, best of 3: 703 ns per loop\nsage: timeit('I.groebner_basis()',number=10^7)\n10000000 loops, best of 3: 249 ns per loop\n# Without patch:\n# 10000000 loops, best of 3: 746 ns per loop\n```\n\n__4. Accessing parent attributes that are inherited from the category, if the element class of the category does not appear in the method resolution order__\n\nIt may happen that a parent is not an instance of the parent class of its category. That can be for two reasons: Either the category is not properly initialised (it is partially taken care of in #9944 and #9138), or it is a Cython class (if I remember correctly, they don't play well with dynamic classes). Then, attribute lookup must go beyond the usual method resolution order, and that's very slow. So, I suggest to use a shortpath in that case:\n\n```\nsage: P.<x,y> = QQ[]\nsage: P._is_category_initialized()\nFalse\nsage: P._init_category_(Algebras(QQ))\nsage: P.sum\n<bound method Algebras.parent_class.sum of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y over Rational Field>\nsage: P.sum.__module__\n'sage.categories.commutative_additive_monoids'\nsage: timeit('P.sum', number=10^6)\n1000000 loops, best of 3: 755 ns per loop\n# Without patch\n# 1000000 loops, best of 3: 3.76 \u00b5s per loop\nsage: P.__cached_methods['sum']\n<bound method Algebras.parent_class.sum of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y over Rational Field>\n```\n\n__5. Cython: Lazy attributes and cached methods inherit from the category__\n\nThe following would not work at all without the patch.\n\nWe define a category (written in Cython) with some cached methods.\n\n```\nsage: cython_code = [\"from sage.all import cached_method, cached_in_parent_method, Category\",\n... \"class MyCategory(Category):\",\n... \"    @cached_method\",\n... \"    def super_categories(self):\",\n... \"        return [Objects()]\",\n... \"    class ElementMethods:\",\n... \"        @cached_method\",\n... \"        def element_cache_test(self):\",\n... \"            return -self\",\n... \"        @cached_in_parent_method\",\n... \"        def element_via_parent_test(self):\",\n... \"            return -self\",\n... \"    class ParentMethods:\",\n... \"        @cached_method\",\n... \"        def one(self):\",\n... \"            return self.element_class(self,1)\",\n... \"        @cached_method\",\n... \"        def invert(self, x):\",\n... \"            return -x\"]\nsage: cython('\\n'.join(cython_code))\n```\n\n*Case 1*\n\nDefine elements and parents as Python classes (but in Cython code), so that attribute assignment is possible. That's the easy case.\n\n```\nsage: cython_code = [\"from sage.structure.element cimport Element\",\n... \"class MyElement(Element):\",\n... \"    def __init__(self,P,x):\",\n... \"        self.x=x\",\n... \"        Element.__init__(self,P)\",\n... \"    def __neg__(self):\",\n... \"        return MyElement(self.parent(),-self.x)\",\n... \"    def _repr_(self):\",\n... \"        return '<%s>'%self.x\",\n... \"    def __hash__(self):\",\n... \"        return hash(self.x)\",\n... \"    def raw_test(self):\",\n... \"        return -self\",\n... \"from sage.structure.parent cimport Parent\",\n... \"class MyParent(Parent):\",\n... \"    Element = MyElement\"]\nsage: cython('\\n'.join(cython_code))\nsage: C = MyCategory()\nsage: P = MyParent(category=C)\nsage: e = MyElement(P,5)\n```\n\nCached method for the parent:\n\n```\n# Cache without arguments\nsage: P.one()\n<1>\nsage: P.one() is P.one()\nTrue\nsage: timeit('P.one()', number=10^6)\n1000000 loops, best of 3: 210 ns per loop\n# Cache with arguments\nsage: P.invert(e)\n<-5>\nsage: P.invert(e) is P.invert(e)\nTrue\nsage: timeit('P.invert(e)', number=10^6)\n1000000 loops, best of 3: 815 ns per loop\n```\n\nCached methods for elements (one with cache in the element, the other with cache in the parent):\n\n```\n# Cache without arguments\nsage: e.element_cache_test()\n<-5>\nsage: e.element_cache_test() is e.element_cache_test()\nTrue\nsage: timeit('e.element_cache_test()', number=10^6)\n1000000 loops, best of 3: 173 ns per loop\n\n# Cached in parent\nsage: e.element_via_parent_test()\n<-5>\nsage: e.element_via_parent_test() is e.element_via_parent_test()\nTrue\nsage: timeit('e.element_via_parent_test()', number=10^6)\n1000000 loops, best of 3: 574 ns per loop\n\n# Comparison with element creation:\nsage: e.raw_test()\n<-5>\nsage: e.raw_test() is e.raw_test()\nFalse\nsage: timeit('e.raw_test()', number=10^6)\n1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.57 \u00b5s per loop\n```\n\n*Case 2*\n\nWe use Cython classes for which attribute assignment is impossible. This is no problem at all, for the parent class. For the element class, we need to provide an additional public attribute `__cached_methods`, or things partially break:\n\n```\nsage: cython_code = [\"from sage.structure.element cimport Element\",\n... \"cdef class MyBrokenElement(Element):\",\n... \"    cdef object x\",\n... \"    def __init__(self,P,x):\",\n... \"        self.x=x\",\n... \"        Element.__init__(self,P)\",\n... \"    def __neg__(self):\",\n... \"        return MyElement(self.parent(),-self.x)\",\n... \"    def _repr_(self):\",\n... \"        return '<%s>'%self.x\",\n... \"    def __hash__(self):\",\n... \"        return hash(self.x)\",\n... \"    def raw_test(self):\",\n... \"        return -self\",\n... \"cdef class MyElement(Element):\",\n... \"    cdef public dict __cached_methods\",\n... \"    cdef object x\",\n... \"    def __init__(self,P,x):\",\n... \"        self.x=x\",\n... \"        Element.__init__(self,P)\",\n... \"    def __neg__(self):\",\n... \"        return MyElement(self.parent(),-self.x)\",\n... \"    def _repr_(self):\",\n... \"        return '<%s>'%self.x\",\n... \"    def __hash__(self):\",\n... \"        return hash(self.x)\",\n... \"    def raw_test(self):\",\n... \"        return -self\",\n... \"from sage.structure.parent cimport Parent\",\n... \"cdef class MyParent(Parent):\",\n... \"    Element = MyElement\"]\nsage: cython('\\n'.join(cython_code))\nsage: C = MyCategory()\nsage: P = MyParent(category=C)\nsage: ebroken = MyBrokenElement(P,5)\nsage: e = MyElement(P,5)\n```\n\nEvery parent should have a **lazy attribute** `element_class` -- but so far, it used to fail on extension classes. That problem is solved by the patch:\n\n```\nsage: P.element_class\n<type '_mnt_local_king__sage_temp_mpc622_29604_tmp_2_spyx_0.MyElement'>\n```\n\nIf attribute assignment is impossible then the cache (for parents) still works, but gets a bit slower. Without the patch, the cache would break, and even a working cache would be slower.\n\n```\nsage: P.one()\n<1>\nsage: P.one() is P.one()\nTrue\nsage: timeit('P.one()', number=10^6)\n1000000 loops, best of 3: 685 ns per loop\n# Cache with arguments\nsage: P.invert(e)\n<-5>\nsage: P.invert(e) is P.invert(e)\nTrue\nsage: timeit('P.invert(e)', number=10^6)\n1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.06 \u00b5s per loop\n```\n\nWe now consider the broken cache for elements. It turns out that the cached method for the \"broken\" element class can still be called, but is not cached. However, the cached-in-parent method *is* cached, but is terribly slow:\n\n```\nsage: ebroken.element_cache_test()\n<-5>\n# This is broken:\nsage: ebroken.element_cache_test() is ebroken.element_cache_test()\nFalse\nsage: ebroken.element_via_parent_test()\n<-5>\n# This is not broken:\nsage: ebroken.element_via_parent_test() is ebroken.element_via_parent_test()\nTrue\n# But it is very very slow:\nsage: timeit('ebroken.element_via_parent_test()')\n625 loops, best of 3: 31.2 \u00b5s per loop\n```\n\nHowever, the simple addition of a public dict `__cached_methods` make the cache work nicely (even though attribute assignment is still faster):\n\n```\nsage: e.element_cache_test()\n<-5>\nsage: e.element_cache_test() is e.element_cache_test()\nTrue\nsage: timeit('e.element_cache_test()', number=10^6)\n1000000 loops, best of 3: 921 ns per loop\n# Cached in parent\nsage: e.element_via_parent_test()\n<-5>\nsage: e.element_via_parent_test() is e.element_via_parent_test()\nTrue\nsage: timeit('e.element_via_parent_test()', number=10^6)\n1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.13 \u00b5s per loop\n# Comparison with element creation\nsage: timeit('e.raw_test()', number=10^6)\n1000000 loops, best of 3: 696 ns per loop\n```\n\n__6. Clear cache on pickle__\n\nThere was a special class `ClearCacheOnPickle` in the cachfunc module. However, it was not sufficiently documented (and not provided with tests), and in fact it was broken. I made it work, and this is one is taken from the doc strings:\n\n```\n    In the following example, we create a Python class that inherits\n    from multivariate polynomial ideals, but does not pickle cached\n    values.  We provide the definition in Cython, however, since\n    interactive Cython definitions provide introspection by trac\n    ticket #9976, whereas Python definitions don't.\n    ::\n\n        sage: P.<a,b,c,d> = QQ[]\n        sage: I = P*[a,b]\n        sage: classdef = ['from sage.misc.cachefunc import ClearCacheOnPickle',\n        ...    'from sage.all import QQ',\n        ...    'P = QQ[\"a\",\"b\",\"c\",\"d\"]; I = P*[P.gen(0),P.gen(1)]',\n        ...    'class MyClass(ClearCacheOnPickle,I.__class__):',\n        ...    '    def __init__(self,ring,gens):',\n        ...    '        I.__class__.__init__(self,ring,gens)',\n        ...    '    def __getnewargs__(self):',\n        ...    '        return (self._Ideal_generic__ring,self._Ideal_generic__gens)']\n        sage: cython('\\n'.join(classdef))\n\n    We destroy the cache of two methods of ``I`` on purpose\n    (demonstrating that the two different implementations of cached\n    methods are correctly dealt with).  Pickling ``I`` preserves the\n    cache::\n\n        sage: I.gens.set_cache('bar')\n        sage: I.groebner_basis.set_cache('foo',algorithm='singular')\n        sage: J = loads(dumps(I))\n        sage: J.gens()\n        'bar'\n        sage: J.groebner_basis(algorithm='singular')\n        'foo'\n\n    However, if we have an ideal that additionally descends from\n    :class:`ClearCacheOnPickle`, the carefully corrupted cache is not\n    pickled::\n\n        sage: A = MyClass(P,[a,b])\n        sage: A\n        Ideal (a, b) of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in a, b, c, d over Rational Field\n        sage: A.gens.set_cache('foo')\n        sage: A.groebner_basis.set_cache('bar',algorithm='singular')\n        sage: A.gens()\n        'foo'\n        sage: A.groebner_basis(algorithm='singular')\n        'bar'\n        sage: B = loads(dumps(A))\n        sage: B.gens()\n        [a, b]\n        sage: B.groebner_basis(algorithm='singular')\n        [a, b]\n        sage: A.gens()\n        'foo'\n```\n\nDoctests pass for me.

I have replaced the previous patches by a single patch. I am sorry in advance for the long post below.

It was indicated in previous posts that there was a certain danger of slowing down object creation. Also, one may think of startuptime. It seems to me that it is now solved.

I announced that I would like to use the new `__cached_methods` attribute of parents to store attributes that are obtained by slow attribute lookup in the category framework, and to make lazy attributes work on all parents.

Here are examples. I compare sage-4.7.alpha5 plus #9976 (referred to by "without patch") with sage-4.7.alpha5 plus #9976 plus the patch from here (referred to by "with patch").

__1. Startuptime__
With patch:

__2. Element creation__

This is with patch. I indicate the corresponding timings without patch in the comments:

```
sage: a = get_memory_usage()
sage: K = GF(2)
sage: %time L = [K(i) for i in xrange(10^7)]
CPU times: user 25.23 s, sys: 0.02 s, total: 25.25 s
Wall time: 25.26 s  # without patch: 25.52 s
sage: get_memory_usage() - a
78.49609375   # same as without patch
sage: a = get_memory_usage()
sage: K = GF(101)
sage: %time L = [K(i) for i in xrange(10^7)]
CPU times: user 25.13 s, sys: 0.03 s, total: 25.16 s
Wall time: 25.16 s  # without patch: 26.20 s
sage: get_memory_usage() - a
0.0
sage: a = get_memory_usage()
sage: K = GF(next_prime(10^6))
sage: %time L = [K(i) for i in xrange(10^7)]
CPU times: user 87.40 s, sys: 0.24 s, total: 87.63 s
Wall time: 87.64 s   # without patch: 88.87 s
sage: get_memory_usage() - a
794.94140625   # without patch: 794.94921875
```
=> no slow down.

__3. Cached methods in Python code__

Here, I consider existing code, namely `gens()` and `groebner_basis()` for multivariate polynomial ideals. Again, the timings are with patch, the old timings are in comments

```
sage: P.<x,y> = QQ[]
sage: I = P*[x,y]
sage: timeit('I.gens()',number=10^7)
10000000 loops, best of 3: 142 ns per loop
# Without patch:
# 10000000 loops, best of 3: 703 ns per loop
sage: timeit('I.groebner_basis()',number=10^7)
10000000 loops, best of 3: 249 ns per loop
# Without patch:
# 10000000 loops, best of 3: 746 ns per loop
```

__4. Accessing parent attributes that are inherited from the category, if the element class of the category does not appear in the method resolution order__

It may happen that a parent is not an instance of the parent class of its category. That can be for two reasons: Either the category is not properly initialised (it is partially taken care of in #9944 and #9138), or it is a Cython class (if I remember correctly, they don't play well with dynamic classes). Then, attribute lookup must go beyond the usual method resolution order, and that's very slow. So, I suggest to use a shortpath in that case:

```
sage: P.<x,y> = QQ[]
sage: P._is_category_initialized()
False
sage: P._init_category_(Algebras(QQ))
sage: P.sum
<bound method Algebras.parent_class.sum of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y over Rational Field>
sage: P.sum.__module__
'sage.categories.commutative_additive_monoids'
sage: timeit('P.sum', number=10^6)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 755 ns per loop
# Without patch
# 1000000 loops, best of 3: 3.76 µs per loop
sage: P.__cached_methods['sum']
<bound method Algebras.parent_class.sum of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y over Rational Field>
```

__5. Cython: Lazy attributes and cached methods inherit from the category__

The following would not work at all without the patch.

We define a category (written in Cython) with some cached methods.

```
sage: cython_code = ["from sage.all import cached_method, cached_in_parent_method, Category",
... "class MyCategory(Category):",
... "    @cached_method",
... "    def super_categories(self):",
... "        return [Objects()]",
... "    class ElementMethods:",
... "        @cached_method",
... "        def element_cache_test(self):",
... "            return -self",
... "        @cached_in_parent_method",
... "        def element_via_parent_test(self):",
... "            return -self",
... "    class ParentMethods:",
... "        @cached_method",
... "        def one(self):",
... "            return self.element_class(self,1)",
... "        @cached_method",
... "        def invert(self, x):",
... "            return -x"]
sage: cython('\n'.join(cython_code))
```

*Case 1*

Define elements and parents as Python classes (but in Cython code), so that attribute assignment is possible. That's the easy case.

```
sage: cython_code = ["from sage.structure.element cimport Element",
... "class MyElement(Element):",
... "    def __init__(self,P,x):",
... "        self.x=x",
... "        Element.__init__(self,P)",
... "    def __neg__(self):",
... "        return MyElement(self.parent(),-self.x)",
... "    def _repr_(self):",
... "        return '<%s>'%self.x",
... "    def __hash__(self):",
... "        return hash(self.x)",
... "    def raw_test(self):",
... "        return -self",
... "from sage.structure.parent cimport Parent",
... "class MyParent(Parent):",
... "    Element = MyElement"]
sage: cython('\n'.join(cython_code))
sage: C = MyCategory()
sage: P = MyParent(category=C)
sage: e = MyElement(P,5)
```

Cached method for the parent:

```
# Cache without arguments
sage: P.one()
<1>
sage: P.one() is P.one()
True
sage: timeit('P.one()', number=10^6)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 210 ns per loop
# Cache with arguments
sage: P.invert(e)
<-5>
sage: P.invert(e) is P.invert(e)
True
sage: timeit('P.invert(e)', number=10^6)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 815 ns per loop
```

Cached methods for elements (one with cache in the element, the other with cache in the parent):

```
# Cache without arguments
sage: e.element_cache_test()
<-5>
sage: e.element_cache_test() is e.element_cache_test()
True
sage: timeit('e.element_cache_test()', number=10^6)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 173 ns per loop

# Cached in parent
sage: e.element_via_parent_test()
<-5>
sage: e.element_via_parent_test() is e.element_via_parent_test()
True
sage: timeit('e.element_via_parent_test()', number=10^6)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 574 ns per loop

# Comparison with element creation:
sage: e.raw_test()
<-5>
sage: e.raw_test() is e.raw_test()
False
sage: timeit('e.raw_test()', number=10^6)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.57 µs per loop
```

*Case 2*

We use Cython classes for which attribute assignment is impossible. This is no problem at all, for the parent class. For the element class, we need to provide an additional public attribute `__cached_methods`, or things partially break:

```
sage: cython_code = ["from sage.structure.element cimport Element",
... "cdef class MyBrokenElement(Element):",
... "    cdef object x",
... "    def __init__(self,P,x):",
... "        self.x=x",
... "        Element.__init__(self,P)",
... "    def __neg__(self):",
... "        return MyElement(self.parent(),-self.x)",
... "    def _repr_(self):",
... "        return '<%s>'%self.x",
... "    def __hash__(self):",
... "        return hash(self.x)",
... "    def raw_test(self):",
... "        return -self",
... "cdef class MyElement(Element):",
... "    cdef public dict __cached_methods",
... "    cdef object x",
... "    def __init__(self,P,x):",
... "        self.x=x",
... "        Element.__init__(self,P)",
... "    def __neg__(self):",
... "        return MyElement(self.parent(),-self.x)",
... "    def _repr_(self):",
... "        return '<%s>'%self.x",
... "    def __hash__(self):",
... "        return hash(self.x)",
... "    def raw_test(self):",
... "        return -self",
... "from sage.structure.parent cimport Parent",
... "cdef class MyParent(Parent):",
... "    Element = MyElement"]
sage: cython('\n'.join(cython_code))
sage: C = MyCategory()
sage: P = MyParent(category=C)
sage: ebroken = MyBrokenElement(P,5)
sage: e = MyElement(P,5)
```

Every parent should have a **lazy attribute** `element_class` -- but so far, it used to fail on extension classes. That problem is solved by the patch:

```
sage: P.element_class
<type '_mnt_local_king__sage_temp_mpc622_29604_tmp_2_spyx_0.MyElement'>
```

If attribute assignment is impossible then the cache (for parents) still works, but gets a bit slower. Without the patch, the cache would break, and even a working cache would be slower.

```
sage: P.one()
<1>
sage: P.one() is P.one()
True
sage: timeit('P.one()', number=10^6)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 685 ns per loop
# Cache with arguments
sage: P.invert(e)
<-5>
sage: P.invert(e) is P.invert(e)
True
sage: timeit('P.invert(e)', number=10^6)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.06 µs per loop
```

We now consider the broken cache for elements. It turns out that the cached method for the "broken" element class can still be called, but is not cached. However, the cached-in-parent method *is* cached, but is terribly slow:

```
sage: ebroken.element_cache_test()
<-5>
# This is broken:
sage: ebroken.element_cache_test() is ebroken.element_cache_test()
False
sage: ebroken.element_via_parent_test()
<-5>
# This is not broken:
sage: ebroken.element_via_parent_test() is ebroken.element_via_parent_test()
True
# But it is very very slow:
sage: timeit('ebroken.element_via_parent_test()')
625 loops, best of 3: 31.2 µs per loop
```

However, the simple addition of a public dict `__cached_methods` make the cache work nicely (even though attribute assignment is still faster):

```
sage: e.element_cache_test()
<-5>
sage: e.element_cache_test() is e.element_cache_test()
True
sage: timeit('e.element_cache_test()', number=10^6)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 921 ns per loop
# Cached in parent
sage: e.element_via_parent_test()
<-5>
sage: e.element_via_parent_test() is e.element_via_parent_test()
True
sage: timeit('e.element_via_parent_test()', number=10^6)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.13 µs per loop
# Comparison with element creation
sage: timeit('e.raw_test()', number=10^6)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 696 ns per loop
```

__6. Clear cache on pickle__

There was a special class `ClearCacheOnPickle` in the cachfunc module. However, it was not sufficiently documented (and not provided with tests), and in fact it was broken. I made it work, and this is one is taken from the doc strings:

```
    In the following example, we create a Python class that inherits
    from multivariate polynomial ideals, but does not pickle cached
    values.  We provide the definition in Cython, however, since
    interactive Cython definitions provide introspection by trac
    ticket #9976, whereas Python definitions don't.
    ::

        sage: P.<a,b,c,d> = QQ[]
        sage: I = P*[a,b]
        sage: classdef = ['from sage.misc.cachefunc import ClearCacheOnPickle',
        ...    'from sage.all import QQ',
        ...    'P = QQ["a","b","c","d"]; I = P*[P.gen(0),P.gen(1)]',
        ...    'class MyClass(ClearCacheOnPickle,I.__class__):',
        ...    '    def __init__(self,ring,gens):',
        ...    '        I.__class__.__init__(self,ring,gens)',
        ...    '    def __getnewargs__(self):',
        ...    '        return (self._Ideal_generic__ring,self._Ideal_generic__gens)']
        sage: cython('\n'.join(classdef))

    We destroy the cache of two methods of ``I`` on purpose
    (demonstrating that the two different implementations of cached
    methods are correctly dealt with).  Pickling ``I`` preserves the
    cache::

        sage: I.gens.set_cache('bar')
        sage: I.groebner_basis.set_cache('foo',algorithm='singular')
        sage: J = loads(dumps(I))
        sage: J.gens()
        'bar'
        sage: J.groebner_basis(algorithm='singular')
        'foo'

    However, if we have an ideal that additionally descends from
    :class:`ClearCacheOnPickle`, the carefully corrupted cache is not
    pickled::

        sage: A = MyClass(P,[a,b])
        sage: A
        Ideal (a, b) of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in a, b, c, d over Rational Field
        sage: A.gens.set_cache('foo')
        sage: A.groebner_basis.set_cache('bar',algorithm='singular')
        sage: A.gens()
        'foo'
        sage: A.groebner_basis(algorithm='singular')
        'bar'
        sage: B = loads(dumps(A))
        sage: B.gens()
        [a, b]
        sage: B.groebner_basis(algorithm='singular')
        [a, b]
        sage: A.gens()
        'foo'
```

Doctests pass for me. So, I guess it is in need of review, again!

After investing some work on #9944, I am now resuming work on cached methods. 

Let's discuss elements again. The options were:

1. Have `__cached_methods` as a cdef public attribute for `sage.structure.element.Element`. Advantage: It allows cached methods for all elements, even if they don't accept attribute assignment. Disadvantage: A general slowdown could result if the memory footprint of an ubiquitous class increases.

2. Do not have `__cached_method` for elements, but let `__getattr__` test the presence of such attribute. Advantage: The footprint remains small, and cached methods can be used for classes derived from Element by simply providing them with a public attribute `__cached_methods`. Disadvantage: The `__getattr__` method of elements needs to look for `__cached_methods`, which yields another slowdown.

I therefore suggest a third solution:

3. Keep `sage.structure.element.Element` untouched (both the memory footprint and the `__getattr__` method). Instead, introduce a new class `sage.structure.element.ElementWithCache`: It derives from `Element` and only adds a `__cached_method` attribute and a modified `__getattr__`. Hence, if the user wants an element class with the possibility to inherit cached methods or lazy attributes from the category then either

   i) the class must allow attribute assignment (`class MyElement(Element)` will do), or

   ii) the class must be derived from `ElementWithCache` instead of `Element` (`cdef class MyElement(ElementWithCache)` will do).

I am now trying to implement the third approach. It seems to me that it combines the advantages of the previous two approaches and avoids their disadvantages.

I am now preparing a new patch that will implement my suggestion from the previous comment. Moreover, I'll radically apply cached methods.

That means the following: I will go through all Python files in sage/rings/ and sage/algebras/ defining parent structures, and I will use `@`cached_method on *any* method that has only `self` as an argument and will not be modified by side-effects of other methods. **Any.**

The reason for that project is the fact that even a simple-most possible method, such as

```
def is_exact(self):
    return True
```
takes about 690 ns on my machine, and

```
def prec(self):
    return self._prec
```
even takes about 2.1 µs.

The cached versions are much faster, 

```
@cached_method
def is_exact(self):
    return True
@cached_method
def prec(self):
    return self._prec
```
only takes about 375 ns on the same machine, with my patch.

Thus I expect to obtain a general speedup of arithmetics. The question is whether there will be a noticeable increase of memory consumption.

I'd like to add one functionality: Pickling of cached functions!

Cached methods can be pickled. However, cached functions can not. Without my patch (in sage-4.6.2):

```
sage: from sage.databases.cunningham_tables import cunningham_prime_factors
sage: loads(dumps(cunningham_prime_factors))
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
PicklingError                             Traceback (most recent call last)

PicklingError: Can't pickle <type 'function'>: attribute lookup __builtin__.function failed
```

With my patch:

```
sage: loads(dumps(cunningham_prime_factors))
Cached version of None
```

The last one is a bit grotesque... Anyway, I think it should be easy to add a an unpickling function that recovers a cached method from its name and module.

The problem was easy to solve: The new `__reduce__` method of cached functions returns an unpickling function, together with the module and the name of the cached function. The unpickling function can re-import the cached function from these data.

Example:

```
sage: type(cunningham_prime_factors) 
<type 'sage.misc.cachefunc.CachedFunction'> 
sage: loads(dumps(cunningham_prime_factors)) is cunningham_prime_factors #indirect doctest 
True 
```

Yes. My sysadmin told me how to switch of the cache proxy on my machine. If I remember correctly, it was similar to what Leif suggests.

> Maybe the trac server announces  that it is ok to cache the patch files by proxies?


I don't know if it is trac's fault.

Anyway, the patchbot finds that there is one failure:

```
File "/levi/scratch/robertwb/buildbot/sage-4.7.1/devel/sage-11115/sage/misc/cachefunc.pyx", line 228:
    sage: print sage_getdoc(O.wrapped_method)
Expected:
    File: ...
    (starting at line ...) some doc for a wrapped cython method
Got:
     some doc for a wrapped cython method
    <BLANKLINE>
```
That's strange, because `sage_getdoc` is supposed to also provide the file and position - and it usually does. Do you get that error as well? I don't (I just verified it)!

That's amazing. Definitely `sage_getdoc` is supposed to provide the file and position information, not just the mere doc string.

Please try the following (I did this with unpatched sage-4.6.2):

```
sage: cython("""
....: def test(x):
....:     'some doc string'
....:     return None
....: """)
sage: from sage.misc.sageinspect import sage_getdoc
sage: print sage_getdoc(test)
File: _mnt_local_king__sage_temp_mpc622_14846_tmp_0_spyx_0.pyx
(starting at line 7) some doc string
```
Do you really get nothing more than `'some doc string'`?

Leif and/or Volker, what happends if you do the following? Do you get essentially the same as I? In particular, can the file be found?

    ... '    return -x',
    ... 'from sage.all import cached_method',
    ... 'from sage.structure.parent cimport Parent',
    ... 'cdef class MyClass(Parent):',
    ... '    wrapped_method = cached_method(test_meth,name="wrapped_method")']
sage: cython('\n'.join(cython_code))
sage: O = MyClass()
sage: from sage.misc.sageinspect import sage_getfile, sage_getargspec
sage: sage_getargspec(O.wrapped_method)
ArgSpec(args=['self', 'x'], varargs=None, keywords=None, defaults=None)
sage: sage_getfile(O.wrapped_method)

```

Does `O.wrapped_method?` and `O.wrapped_method??` work for you, or is it impossible to open the source file? If the latter is the case: What is `O.wrapped_method.__module__`?

I suppose that the problem is actually located in `_sage_getdoc_unformatted`, because for me it already returns the file and embedding information:

```
from sage.misc.sageinspect import _sage_getdoc_unformatted
sage: _sage_getdoc_unformatted(O.wrapped_method)

The problem with the wrong source file directory reminded me another ticket, namely #11791.

When I start with sage-4.7.2.alpha3-prerelease and add #11768+#11791+#11115, I get the following:

```
sage: cython_code = ['cpdef test_meth(self,x):',
....:     ... '    "some doc for a wrapped cython method"',
....:     ... '    return -x',
....:     ... 'from sage.all import cached_method',
....:     ... 'from sage.structure.parent cimport Parent',
....:     ... 'cdef class MyClass(Parent):',
....:     ... '    wrapped_method = cached_method(test_meth,name="wrapped_method")']
sage: cython('\n'.join(cython_code))
sage: O = MyClass()
sage: from sage.misc.sageinspect import sage_getfile, sage_getdoc
sage: sage_getfile(O.wrapped_method)
'/mnt/local/king/.sage/temp/mpc622/8600//spyx/_mnt_local_king__sage_temp_mpc622_8600_tmp_0_spyx/_mnt_local_king__sage_temp_mpc622_8600_tmp_0_spyx_0.pyx'

File: _mnt_local_king__sage_temp_mpc622_8600_tmp_0_spyx_0.pyx
(starting at line 6) some doc for a wrapped cython method
```

Note that on my machine I do not need #11791 for avoiding the doctest error. But perhaps #11791 solves the problem for you?

Mysteriously, the `_sage_getdoc_unformatted` function works for me:

```
sage: sage: _sage_getdoc_unformatted(O.wrapped_method)
'File: _home_vbraun__sage_temp_volker_desktop_stp_dias_ie_17521_tmp_0_spyx_0.pyx (starting at line 6)\nsome doc for a wrapped cython method'
```
I'm compiling pre-alpha-3 version right now to see if that helps.

Also, I get errors applying #11791 on top of sage-4.7.2.alpha2 + #11342 + #9138 + #11115 + #11734.

No, it is all totally different. It should have nothing to do with #11791 (but of course you may try).

In the code in my example, one starts with a function `test_meth`, that has a doc string. When `test_meth` is turned into a cached method, the doc string of `test_meth` is *directly* used as a doc string for the cached method.

When I do

```
sage: print test_meth.__doc__
File: _mnt_local_king__sage_temp_mpc622_8600_tmp_0_spyx_0.pyx (starting at line 6)
some doc for a wrapped cython method
```
then the doc string contains the file info. 

You do *not* get that file info, right? But then, it has nothing to do with cached methods, because `test_meth` is a plain cpdef Cython function.

What happens when you do `sage_getfile(test_meth)` or `test_meth??`?

That is extremely strange. If you look at the `_sage_doc_` method in `sage.misc.cachefunc` then you'll find:

```python
        f = self.f
        if hasattr(f, "func_doc"):
            try:
                sourcelines = sage_getsourcelines(f)
            except IOError:
                sourcelines = None
            if sourcelines is not None:
                import os
                SAGE_ROOT = os.environ['SAGE_ROOT']
                filename = sage_getfile(f)
                # The following is a heuristics to get
                # the file name of the cached function
                # or method
                if filename.startswith(SAGE_ROOT+'/devel/sage/'):
                    filename = filename[len(SAGE_ROOT+'/devel/sage/'):]
                elif 'site-packages/' in filename:
                    filename = filename.split('site-packages/',1)[1]
                file_info = "File: %s (starting at line %d)"%(filename,sourcelines[1])
                doc = file_info+(f.func_doc or '')
            else:
                doc = f.func_doc
        else:
            doc = f.__doc__
        return doc
```
Here, `self` is `O.wrapped_method`, and thus `f` is `test_meth`. Since a Cython function has no attribute `func_doc`, the method `_sage_doc_` simply returns `f.__doc__` in our case, which *does* contain the file information.

Or is it the case that `test_meth` has a `func_doc` attribute on your machine?

I see, that could be it. However, as I have indicated above, `_extract_embedded_position` returns something non-None in both your examples, on my machine.

But let us consider the doc of `sage_getdoc`: It states that the embedded position is stripped from the doc string. Hence, actually the embedding should be shown with `_sage_getdoc_unformatted`, but not with `_sage_getdoc`.

So, after all, the fact that the embedded position is *not* stripped on my machine could be a bug.

More precisely: There is a difference on my machine between `sage_getdoc` and `_sage_getdoc_unformatted`, but the difference on you machine is different...

I get

I suggest to go through `sage_getdoc` step by step. For me, it is as follows:

```
sage: from sage.misc.sageinspect import sage_getdoc, _sage_getdoc_unformatted, _extract_embedded_position
sage: sage.misc.sageinspect.EMBEDDED_MODE
False 
sage: obj = O.wrapped_method
sage: r = _sage_getdoc_unformatted(obj)
sage: s = sage.misc.sagedoc.format(str(r), embedded=False)
sage: print s
File: _mnt_local_king__sage_temp_mpc622_9687_tmp_0_spyx_0.pyx
(starting at line 6) some doc for a wrapped cython method

sage: print r
File: _mnt_local_king__sage_temp_mpc622_9687_tmp_0_spyx_0.pyx (starting at line 6)
some doc for a wrapped cython method
```

Is the result for s fundamentally different on your machine?

```
sage: pos = _extract_embedded_position(s)
sage: pos is None
True
```

Aha! And I suppose you get `pos!=None`!

Yes, the formatting runs sphinxify, which inserts newlines:

```
sage: r = 'File: _mnt_local_king__sage_temp_mpc622_4939_tmp_1_spyx_0.pyx (starting at line 6)\nsome doc for a wrapped cython method'

```
You were lucky and the newline is right between the file name and the `(starting`. When that happens, the `sage.misc.sageinspect.__embedded_position_re` regular expression fails to match.

Come to think of it, I was probably just unlucky. Sphinxify tries to put the newline in a space, but my filename is too long so it is forced to insert it mid-word. So the doctests breaks for be because my hostname is too long ;-)

The bug is in `sage_doc()`, it should first try to match regular expressions and only afterwards format the string (by inserting newlines at random places).

Really? I'd rather locate it in `sage.misc.sagedoc.format`...

No. `format' should not apply the whole formatting business to the first line of the string, if that line contains an embedding information. Then, `sage_getdoc` would not be in trouble at all.

How is one now supposed to find out whether a function without arguments is cached?

```
sage: class Foo:
...       def __init__(self):
...           pass
...       @cached_method
...       def f(self):

...
sage: a = Foo()
sage: a.f.is_in_cache()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not callable
```
I haven't added the `sage_getdoc()` fixes yet to my patch queue, but I think this problem is unrelated.

But I guess it needs to be rebased against #11900 anyway, isn't it?

The patches do apply with #11900, I don't remember how cleanly.

Sorry, I can not reliably reproduce it.

I applied the patches from here, then did `sage -docbuild reference html`, and saw the same error that you found. If I am not mistaken, I did not docbuild this installation of Sage before.

Since the error seemed to indicate a problem in sage.symbolic.ring, I touched it, rebuilt, and repeated `sage -docbuild reference html` - but it worked without an error. Hence, it probably isn't sage.symbolic.ring after all.

Next, I removed the patches (if you do, don't forget `rm build/sage/misc/cachefunc.*` and `rm build/*/sage/misc/cachefunc.py` before `sage -b`). The docs still built fine.

Then, I was applying the first patch from here, and again built sage and the docs - and it worked without problem! The same happened after applying the remaining patches as well.

Conclusion: I doubt that my patch is to blame for the docbuild problem.

So, how did you come to the conclusion that the problem lies here?

This is what I did to test:

* I downloaded sage-4.7.2.alpha4.tar and built from scratch. Docbuild with `sage -docbuild reference html` was fine.
* I applied #9138. After `sage -b`, I repeated building the reference manual, and it was still fine.
* I applied #11900 to compensate for the speed regression of #9138, followed by `sage -b`. The references were still building fine.
* I applied the four patches from here. For the record: They applied cleanly. `sage -br` worked, and: Building the references went without problems.

In other words: While I did met a problem when working on top of sage-4.7.2.alpha3, I can not replicate what you found when starting with sage-4.7.2.alpha4.

Does that mean the positive review can be restored?

What happens if you first remove all output and then build the documentation:

```
$ rm -r SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/doc/output

So, while #11115 seems to be innocent, there does seem to be something wrong in sage.structure.category_object.

But the problem remains mysterious. Namely, not only was the resulting reference page looking fine, but also after touching sage/structure/category_object.pyx, `sage -b` and `sage -docbuild reference html` worked just fine.

I did not try removing all output, though. Doing now.

Did you double-check that there is no error in the log file?

```
$ grep -i error dochtml.log
```

(note that the log file is always *appended* to, so you need to find the last `make doc-html` run within the logfile).

So, it would be very difficult to find out which run worked and which didn't. Unfortunately, before reading your post, I have already started building docs with #11900. Thus, the log for #11115 is not the last part but the last but one part of the log file. And I already saw on screen that with #11900 I am again getting the ominous doc build error.

I must admit, it confuses me.

Hooray! With the blank line, the missing first lines of the `modp_splitting_data` doc string (and other instances) re-appear, and most importantly the error has vanished:

```
king@mpc622:/mnt/local/king/SAGE/rebase/sage-4.7.2.alpha4$ grep -i error dochtml.log
reading sources... [ 79%] sage/rings/padics/precision_error
writing output... [ 79%] sage/rings/padics/precision_error
```

The new patch does the following:

* Fix some wrong docstring formats that I stumbled over.
* Add the required blank line after the embedding information in the doc strings of cached methods.
* In two cases, a cached function has been created by first defining a non-cached function, e.g. `adem_`, and then defining `adem = CachedFunction(adem_)`. If I am not mistaken, *both* functions would be included in the docs, which is not good. So, for aesthetic reasons, I rewrote it using `@cached_function`.

I am now running doc tests. It could be that some tests in sage_inspect will fail. But I am confident enough to turn it into "needs review".

Yes, the same problem occurs in sage/structure/element.pyx. It is fixed with the new version of the docfix patch that I have just attached. At least parent.pyx, element.pyx and cachefunc.pyx pass, and I am now running all doc tests.

But I think it is ok to keep the status "needs review". Recall: The review concerns the docfix patch, the first patch already has a positive review.

What Simon said is exactly right: a patch can get positive_review even when the dependencies do not yet have positive_review.

I really hope that #11900 can get reviewed soon, it would be nice indeed to have #9138 and #11115 in Sage.

I have been through most of that patch with Simon, and I just now need to make a final pass. I had planned to do it on Friday, but got delayed by some sagetex hacking for the upcoming new version of the French sagebook. Most likely, I'll get to do it next Tuesday.

Could you please explain this line in `src/sage/misc/cachefunc.pxd`?

```
# cache is not always of type "dict"!
```

It seems that the implementation assumes that `cache` is a `dict` anyway (I see lots of `<dict>self.cache` in the code).

That's why:

```
sage: from weakref import WeakValueDictionary
sage: W = WeakValueDictionary()
sage: isinstance(W, dict)
False
```
We use weak value dictionaries for weak_cached_function.

But certainly not in weak_cached_function.

I think that's a bad design with all the `<dict>` casts. I would have prefered something more like:

```
class BaseCachedFunction(object):
    pass

class CachedFunction(BaseCachedFunction):
    cdef dict cache

class WeakCachedFunction(BaseCachedFunction):
    cdef WeakValueDictionary cache
```

This is like the classes for dense/sparse vectors.
