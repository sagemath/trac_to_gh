This is a recurrent question in the sage-support list (see for example [here](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support/browse_thread/thread/ca5f1b8821e561a2,)). I considered appropriate to add a couples of lines in the [usage-Sage FAQ](http://sagemath.org/doc/faq/faq-usage.html,) to mention some SAGE important environmental variables.

Special attention is given to **SAGE_BROWSER**, since this is a common variable changed by new users. This is already briefly mentioned in the paragraph *"How do I get started?"* but in my humble opinion, it would be nice to have a paragraph addressing exactly that question. It is not probable that people wanted to change the default browser will look to Sage pre-requisites.

Two new questions are now added:
* How can I assign a default browser to use with Sage notebooks?
* Which environment variables are available in Sage?

It should perhaps specifically differentiate between variables (mostly) related to building, and those important in "daily use".

I'm also in favour of supporting `~/.sagerc` to put frequently used options / settings  etc. into (i.e., a shell script that is sourced by `sage`).

I simply add the most relevant environment variables to the FAQ. A link to all variables (including those used during building) is also provided for more interested readers.

> I'm also in favour of supporting `~/.sagerc` to put frequently used options / settings  etc. into (i.e., a shell script that is sourced by `sage`).

I completely agree with you!
