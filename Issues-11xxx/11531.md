In Sage 4.7.1.alpha2:

```
$ hg status
? rst2man.py
? rst2odt.py
? rst2odt_prepstyles.py
```
I think this happened with the upgrade to docutils in #10166.  The attached patch puts these files into the .hgignore file.

The flask notebook currently pulls in the python package "babel" (for internationalization) which installs the file `$SAGE_LOCAL/pybabel` - could you add that as well?
