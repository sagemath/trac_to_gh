I'm not quite sure how this happened, but apparently in newer Cygwins patch won't accept certain things.

FLINT now doesn't actually work on one of my Cygwins, even after #11547, because of an extra line that crept into one of the patches.

patches/mpn_extras.h.patch
is in DOS mode. As well, some files in src/are in DOS mode, too.
Please convert all the files in the spkg into Unix mode.
This is in fact just on-liner (assuming dos2unix installed):

```
flint-1.5.0.p9$ find . -type f -exec dos2unix '{}' \;
```
New package, with this done, at http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/dima/packages/flint-1.5.0.p9.spkg
I checked in on Linux and MacOSX only - please check on Cygwin.

Replying to [@kcrisman](#comment%3A8):
> Thanks.  I have no idea what is going on with this - I only use Mac for developing (don't create patches/spkgs on Cygwin) so I am very unfamiliar with all this.  My editors don't show these things.  

well, on every Mac there is vim, which you can run in terminal window - and it will show you the encoding...

How's the storm? Did all machines survive?

If you can tell me what *DOS **file** endings* are... ;) (DOS actually used `^Z` to indicate the end of a text file.)

Hopefully this will be the last spkg in the FLINT 1.5.0 series, so I can finally rebase my 1.5.2 one on it.

Turned out to be more of a non-event here, fortunately.  Elsewhere on the US East Coast, not so much.

Yes, let's hope!
