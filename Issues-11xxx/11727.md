I'm not quite sure how this happened, but apparently in newer Cygwins patch won't accept certain things.

FLINT now doesn't actually work on one of my Cygwins, even after #11547, because of an extra line that crept into one of the patches.

What you need to do is to save this file in Unix mode and re-package...

patches/mpn_extras.h.patch
is in DOS mode. As well, some files in src/are in DOS mode, too.
Please convert all the files in the spkg into Unix mode.
This is in fact just on-liner (assuming dos2unix installed):

```
flint-1.5.0.p9$ find . -type f -exec dos2unix '{}' \;
```
New package, with this done, at http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/dima/packages/flint-1.5.0.p9.spkg
I checked in on Linux and MacOSX only - please check on Cygwin.

If you can tell me what *DOS **file** endings* are... ;) (DOS actually used `^Z` to indicate the end of a text file.)

Turned out to be more of a non-event here, fortunately.  Elsewhere on the US East Coast, not so much.

Yes, let's hope!
