**OLD STUFF** superseded by other tickets, no longer relevant:

## Fix "sage -info" and a bug when sourcing sage-env more than once

One of the patches at #9960 did a lot of clean-up to the file `sage-spkg`: quoting environment variables, replacing tabs with spaces, etc., also adding comments and TODOs.  Since those changes were not related to the issue at #9960, I've split them off and put them here instead.  The main change of any content is to look at the file `SPKG.txt` rather than `SAGE.txt` when the "`-info`" flag is passed so `sage-spkg` (through `sage -info ...`). Also, warnings and error messages are now redirected to `stderr`.

The additional patch to `sage-spkg` is based on the v2 "clean-up" patch, fixing some more bugs, adding error checks, improving some messages (see comment below / commit message for some more details).

Apparently support for `sage -info ...` was removed at some point (or never existed); the patch to `sage-sage` fixes that.

The patch to `sage-env` fixes a bug caused or enabled by #10469, which through the patch to `sage-spkg` now becomes more visible and potentially worse.

Well, the code is a bit weird anyway; there should be an `exit 1` if the package (`$PKG_SRC`) does not exist:

```sh
if [ "$INFO" -ne 0 ]; then
    if [ ! -f "$PKG_SRC" ]; then
        echo "Package $PKG_NAME not found"
        # EXIT HERE
    fi
    ...
```

I don't think we really need the `echo ""`, since `SPKG.txt` files should be newline-terminated. (The `tar` commands extract this file to `stdout`.)

As far as I know, there are indeed (at least some old, optional) packages that do have a *short* `SAGE.txt` (rather than `SPKG.txt`), so I'm not sure if we shouldn't check for both.

Also, typical `SPKG.txt` files are quite long, so we might omit some parts or e.g. "cut" them where the Changelog section starts.

Ok, though I wouldn't have changed the "error" message; the previous one sounds a bit friendlier. (Actually a non-zero status code can have a couple of reasons there, but I don't mind. ;-) )

Maybe John has some idea or opinion on that...

(We could e.g. pipe the `tar` output to some sort of `sed -e '/== Changelog ==/,$d'` and perhaps give some message indicating it was omitted. Not important to me; maybe users less familiar with `more` or `less` could enjoy that - I personally don't use the `-info` option at all.)

A few lines above, there is an error message `"Package $PKG_NAME not found"`. So I thought `"File SPKG.txt not found in package $PKG_NAME"` would follow the same grammar. But I can change it back, no problem. :-)

That's pretty hackish in my opinion. It would impose an undocumented constraint on the format of SPKG.txt, which does not have any formatting validation otherwise. I'm not sure that truncating SPKG.txt is even desirable.

What about *"Could not extract SPKG.txt."* or better *"Package $PKG_NAME appears to have no SPKG.txt."*?

Redirecting `stderr` **of the `tar` commands** to `/dev/null` is a bit odd there. On the other hand, the presence of `$PKG_SRC` (the spkg file) itself is checked **twice** a few lines above, so a non-zero exit code of `tar` most probably means either a corrupted tarball or the file to extract wasn't found. Maybe the proper way would be to first try to list the file (`tar tf - ... 2>/dev/null`) into some shell variable and check if it is empty (or, better, list the tarball's whole contents grepping for `$PKG_NAME/SPKG.txt`), and use `bunzip2 -t ...` to test whether the spkg is compressed in advance.

Or verify the spkg **wasn't** corrupted in case of an error (`$? -ne 0`):

```sh
    ...
    if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
        # Extracting SPKG.txt failed for *some* reason,
        # now check if it's simply missing:
        if (bunzip2 -c "$PKG_SRC" | tar tf -) &>/dev/null ||
           tar tf "$PKG_SRC" &>/dev/null
        then
            echo "Package $PKG_NAME lacks a description (SPKG.txt file)."
            exit 1
        else
            echo "$PKG_SRC seems to be corrupted. Exiting."
            exit 1 # or some other error code
        fi
    fi
    exit 0
fi
```

But IMHO a rather minor issue.

`SPKG.txt` files are supposed to have a quite clear structure, with ReST (section) mark-up (which an spkg reviewer should check btw). If there's no line matching `== Changelog ==` -- or preferably a more generic, i.e. robust pattern, nothing would get omitted.

But as I said, I have no opinion on truncating them there.

I have changed a number of these. I wasn't sure on a few cases; please check them.

I also replaced a few instances of `echo "*************"` with a common function call (`print_separator`). I'm not sure whether this was a good idea. Please criticize!

Hmmm, for Sage 4.7.1.alpha4, we'll have to rebase the patch:

```

Sorry for the delay btw, been busy with other things.

Though there are still some things that could be improved (e.g. still two instances of `build` rather than `$BUILD` IIRC), and I would have put the `>&2` right after `echo` to be more obvious, I'm ok with your changes.

I.e., I'll rebase the patch as is, test it, and if *you're* ok with *my* previous changes, we'd have a positive review.

(Other things like supporting `SAGE_CHECK=ignore` and what else we've mentioned on this ticket can be implemented on follow-ups, we just have to get this ticket merged first... :) )

The other two patches I've attached fix issues that came up while testing the patch to `sage-spkg` with Sage 4.7.1.alpha4.

They're both necessary to make `sage -info ...` as well as `sage-spkg` in general (with the changes made by the other patch) work.

Cf. https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/10469#comment:24.

Please review!

<div id="comment:18" align="right">comment:18</div>

I've made some more changes to `sage-spkg` (more than I intended):

* Fixed some bugs, e.g. not recording the version of a package found in `spkg/{standard,optional}` such that the installation later failed; superfluous second download now doesn't take place.
* All instances of `build` now use `$BUILD`. (It is now also checked that `BUILD` is really set, cf. patch to `sage-env`.)
* More error checks and more appropriate error messages.
* Non-conforming spkgs are no longer said to be corrupted.
* Default installation scripts now use `$MAKE` rather than `make` (`$MAKE -j1` for installation).
* `spkg-check` is now `time`d, too.
* Trying to install an already installed spkg now suggests using `-f`.
* Some restructuring and simplification, removed useless code.
* Lots of comments (including TODOs) added, some cosmetic changes.

Harder to review, but please also do. ;-)

(Patch is based on the rebased v2, i.e. should be applied after that.)

I've added another, necessary patch *to the Sage library*, since otherwise e.g. `sage -b` would break (just because to detect if an optional spkg was installed the function finally called used `sage -f` instead of `sage -i`).

P.S.: The fully qualified name of the function is of course<sup>TM</sup> `sage.misc.package.install_package()`.

I haven't looked at the *current* ATLAS spkg; don't know if it also works on Cygwin, e.g. if `SAGE_ATLAS_LIB` is set there (in which case any tests are skipped as well).

Well, `sage -i pkg1 pkg2 ...` behaves the same ("`Installing pkg1 pkg2 ...`", and did before), but I can add commas to both -- easily, until we support (or use) spaces in spkg filenames...

`sage -t --verbose ...` doesn't work either; only `sage-sage` seems to support (some) long options with double dashs.

Agreed. I'd also *remove* long options with a *single* dash (i.e., only allow `--` there), but others disagreed a while ago.

That's odd. IIRC we require **GNU** `tar`, which behaves correctly:

```sh
$ cat /dev/null | tar tf -
tar: This does not look like a tar archive
tar: Exiting with failure status due to previous errors
```

Maybe we can work around in a dumb way (which I'd still prefer over using `pipestatus` *there*) by doing

```sh
(bunzip2 -c "$PKG_SRC" || echo foo) | tar tf -
```
which should fail in any case if `bunzip2` fails.

I think given that when building Sage a user will see thousands of warnings messages, they are not likely to report this. 

It probably bothers John more as he knows it's code written by Sage developers that is generating the warning. But for "normal" users (non-developers), there's no reason this warning should stand out in any way.

As for the tar problem, there is no requirement for tar to even exist on a POSIX system, so it not really possible to say any particular behavior is wrong.

In the "else" part of this, `$PKG_NAME` will likely be an empty string, so the echo won't print anything.  The script `sage-latest-online-package` prints a suitable error message so this is not a big deal, but it's kind of odd.

Regarding the comments about Atlas and spkg-check, in retrospect, I'm not sure I understand what you're saying.  If spkg-check fails, then it makes sense for atlas not to be installed, in which case you don't have a complete Sage install, in which case I don't mind if a doctest fails.  But as I said, I may be misunderstanding your point.

I wonder if there's a better (and more efficient) way to test if an spkg is (bzip2-) compressed, preferably in a shell function.

I suspect something like

```sh
if file "$spkg" | grep "bzip2" >/dev/null; then
    # it is compressed
    ...
```
wouldn't be very portable, since `file` might not recognize bzip2 files on some systems.

We could also directly check the magic header instead, with e.g. `head` and `cut` or `dd`.

Any further suggestions?

Yes, it would have been much easier if people had based their work on this here (or simply [first] completed this ticket; there wasn't much missing, and everything was well documented)... 8/

I wouldn't close it yet, but I currently don't know what's meanwhile been solved elsewhere.

At least rebasing seems impossible, i.e., all changes would have to manually be put into one or more completely new patches.

I had a quick look over the **scripts** patches and I think everything there has been fixed in other patches (most recently, #12606, which needs review by the way).

I think we should still keep the Sage library patches.

The Sage library patch looks okay to me. I'm not completely happy with a feature of both the old and new implementation. In Sage 5.3.rc0, cvxopt (for example) has been upgraded compared to the version on the web page, so if I do `install_package('cvxopt')`, it tries to download and install the previous version. Should the behavior of `standard_packages()` be changed? Or should its output be modified before use in `install_package(...)`, taking other (later) versions of packages into account?

By the way, I see a regression in the behavior of Sage: `sage file.spkg` doesn't work anymore. It used to (as of Sage 4.7, at least) install the given spkg. When I run it now, I get an error. On sage.math:

```
$ sage /scratch/palmieri/sage/spkg/standard/cvxopt-1.1.5.spkg 
Calling sage-spkg on ''
/scratch/palmieri/sage-5.3.beta2/spkg/bin/sage-spkg: line 152: [: =: unary operator expected
/scratch/palmieri/sage-5.3.beta2/spkg/bin/sage-spkg: line 158: [: =: unary operator expected
/scratch/palmieri/sage-5.3.beta2/spkg/bin/sage-spkg: line 163: [: =: unary operator expected

Attempting to download package 
Searching for latest online version of 
Could not find a version for .
```
I guess it's from these lines, in particular the second line, from `spkg/bin/sage`:

```
   if [ "$T " = "spkg " ]; then
       install "" "$@"
       exit $?
   fi
```
Since this isn't documented, I guess it's not a big deal, but perhaps it could be fixed. Another ticket?

Edit: with the patch at #12606, the error messages don't appear, but it still doesn't work.

I added a patch to fix

```
./sage foo.spkg
```
It now force-installs `foo.spkg`.

How about simply not using `standard_packages()` at all and simply calling `sage -i cvxopt`?  Then `sage-spkg` will figure out which version to install (it would install `spkg/standard/cvxopt-NNN.spkg`)

It used to install without forcing. The old behavior seems more natural to me, so I'm suggesting my patch instead. Positive review for the Sage library patch.

> How about simply not using standard_packages() at all and simply calling sage -i cvxopt? Then sage-spkg will figure out which version to install (it would install spkg/standard/cvxopt-NNN.spkg) 

Sounds fine to me, although let's do this on another ticket.
