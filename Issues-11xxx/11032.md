sage: C = HammingCode(5, GF(2))
sage: C.automorphism_group_binary_code()
Exception MemoryError: MemoryError('Memory.',) in
'sage.coding.binary_code.BinaryCodeClassifier.aut_gp_and_can_label' ignored


------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occurred in Sage.
This probably occurred because a *compiled* component
of Sage has a bug in it (typically accessing invalid memory)
or is not properly wrapped with _sig_on, _sig_off.
You might want to run Sage under gdb with 'sage -gdb' to debug this.
Sage will now terminate (sorry).

Also, as Thomas points out we should be checking whether to use the dual code...
