At https://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-support/Pkn1o1kAcyE/discussion I noted that currently (4.7.1 and 4.7.2.alpha2), we have this:

```
sage: n = var('n')
sage: assume(n, 'integer')
sage: exp(I*n*pi).simplify_exp()
e^(I*pi*n)
```
I was really hoping for `cos(pi*n)`, or `(-1)^n`. 

If you are serious about asking Maxima, it will simplify it, though:

```
sage: A = exp(I*pi*n)
sage: A.maxima_methods().rectform()
(-1)^n
```

We should somehow wrap rectform or make it easier to access. At a minimum, we should add something to the documentation to mention this possibility.

Depends on #13061

I tried it without the complexity measure first, but this function has a tendency to make expressions *more* complicated. If we're ever going to use it in e.g. `full_simplify()`, we need to be a little more selective about which results we accept.

It turns out, string length is actually a pretty good measure.

I implemented something close to the number of vertices in the expression tree:

```
from types import ListType

def flatten_list(l):
   result = []

   for item in l:
      if isinstance(item, ListType):
         result += flatten_list(item)
      else:
         result += [item]

   return result

def flatten_operands(operands):
   return operands + [flatten_operands(g.operands()) for g in operands]

def all_operands(expr):
    return flatten_list(flatten_operands(expr.operands()))
```

and then tried the `len(all_operands(expr))` complexity measure. It also works, but is much much much slower and doesn't seem "better" than string length really. We could add that to the `complexity_measures` module as an option, but the dumb solution seems to work too.

(The way that I'm testing, by the way, is to replace `simplify()` with `simplify_rect()` and watch the failing doctests. Many of them are promising.)

Admittedly adding a new module just for this feels like overkill, but the alternatives weren't too appealing:

* Default to `lambda x: len(str(x))`
* Default to `None`, and use the string length in that case. Requires the user to pass `lambda x: 1` to force the simplification (we'd also have to use less-than-or-equal-to in the function body).
* Remove the measure altogether; this usually wasn't a simplification.

Down the line, `simplify_full()` could potentially try `simplify_foo()` with *every* complexity measure, and return the expression that's simplest according to the measure you gave `simplify_full()`.

I will ask some other people about the complexity measure stuff, but I think your default is reversed: for anyone who knows a little Maxima, they will expect something like `simplify_rectform()` to actually return what Maxima's `rectform` returns -- but the default *isn't* to do that. 

Here's my proposal: by default, call Maxima's `rectform` and return that. Don't import anything from `complexity_measures.py` by default, but include documentation showing the user how to import that and use it in the keyword argument. 

(Also, how hard is it to count the number of operands in an expression? It's just `len`, right? If it isn't too hard, perhaps the documentation could show how to use that as a complexity measure.)

But why introduce a default that's not useful? Unless you're setting up a toy example to show what `rectform` does, most expressions will be made uglier. Maxima's `rectform()` isn't labeled a simplification; if we're going to call it one, I think it should simplify.

If we call it a simplification and have it only do `rectform()` by default, we're essentially requiring the user to both read the docs and pass `make_it_work=True` on every invocation.


How many of our users are there that,

a. Know maxima **and** are familiar with its `rectform()` **and** don't know about expr.maxima_methods().rectform() **and** would expect `simplify_rectform()` to *just* call `rectform()`?
b. Use `simplify_foo()` and just want their expressions to get simpler.

I suspect (b) dwarfs (a).

I wouldn't mind if we just called it `Expression.rectform()` and documented what it does, but I also don't think that it would be as useful.




> (Also, how hard is it to count the number of operands in an expression? It's just `len`, right? If it isn't too hard, perhaps the documentation could show how to use that as a complexity measure.)




It depends on how thorough you want to be. A simple `len(expr)` will return the number of top-level operands. If you want to count all operands at any level, you either have to recurse (as I did), or know some shortcut.

The former doesn't work well because you can have,

```
sage: f = huge_expression1 + huge_expression2
sage: len(f)
2
```

The latter works comparably to the string length, but was slow as dirt (my implementation is lame). It could probably be improved, though. I would definitely include this if some pynac magic can speed it up.

* Those who want a command that simplifies definitely want the current version, or at least something like it.
* Those who use something with the word `rectform` in it will expect something with right angles.

Could we have two functions, then?  
1. Something with `simplify_foo` where `foo` is something that implies `e^(pi*i*n)` will look very simple with `n` an integer but `e^(i*x)` doesn't change?
