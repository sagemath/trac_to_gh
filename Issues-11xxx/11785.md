At https://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-support/Pkn1o1kAcyE/discussion I noted that currently (4.7.1 and 4.7.2.alpha2), we have this:

```
sage: n = var('n')
sage: assume(n, 'integer')
sage: exp(I*n*pi).simplify_exp()
e^(I*pi*n)
```
I was really hoping for `cos(pi*n)`, or `(-1)^n`. 

If you are serious about asking Maxima, it will simplify it, though:

```
sage: A = exp(I*pi*n)
sage: A.maxima_methods().rectform()
(-1)^n
```

We should somehow wrap rectform or make it easier to access. At a minimum, we should add something to the documentation to mention this possibility.

I tried it without the complexity measure first, but this function has a tendency to make expressions *more* complicated. If we're ever going to use it in e.g. `full_simplify()`, we need to be a little more selective about which results we accept.

It turns out, string length is actually a pretty good measure.

I implemented something close to the number of vertices in the expression tree:

```
from types import ListType

def flatten_list(l):
   result = []

   for item in l:
      if isinstance(item, ListType):
         result += flatten_list(item)
      else:
         result += [item]

   return result

def flatten_operands(operands):
   return operands + [flatten_operands(g.operands()) for g in operands]

def all_operands(expr):
    return flatten_list(flatten_operands(expr.operands()))
```

and then tried the `len(all_operands(expr))` complexity measure. It also works, but is much much much slower and doesn't seem "better" than string length really. We could add that to the `complexity_measures` module as an option, but the dumb solution seems to work too.

(The way that I'm testing, by the way, is to replace `simplify()` with `simplify_rect()` and watch the failing doctests. Many of them are promising.)

Admittedly adding a new module just for this feels like overkill, but the alternatives weren't too appealing:

* Default to `lambda x: len(str(x))`
* Default to `None`, and use the string length in that case. Requires the user to pass `lambda x: 1` to force the simplification (we'd also have to use less-than-or-equal-to in the function body).
* Remove the measure altogether; this usually wasn't a simplification.

Down the line, `simplify_full()` could potentially try `simplify_foo()` with *every* complexity measure, and return the expression that's simplest according to the measure you gave `simplify_full()`.

Unless you're setting up a toy example to show what `rectform` does, most expressions will be made uglier. Maxima's `rectform()` isn't labeled a simplification; if we're going to call it one, I think it should simplify.\n\nIf we call it a simplification and have it only do `rectform()` by default, we're essentially requiring the user to both read the docs and pass `make_it_work=True` on every invocation.\n\n\nHow many of our users are there that,\n\na. Know maxima **and** are familiar with its `rectform()` **and** don't know about expr.maxima_methods().rectform() **and** would expect `simplify_rectform()` to *just* call `rectform()`?\nb. Use `simplify_foo()` and just want their expressions to get simpler.\n\nI suspect (b) dwarfs (a).\n\nI wouldn't mind if we just called it `Expression.rectform()` and documented what it does, but I also don't think that it would be as useful.\n\n\n\n\n> (Also, how hard is it to count the number of operands in an expression? It's just `len`, right? If it isn't too hard, perhaps the documentation could show how to use that as a complexity measure.)\n\n\n\n\n\nIt depends on how thorough you want to be. A simple `len(expr)` will return the number of top-level operands. If you want to count all operands at any level, you either have to recurse (as I did), or know some shortcut.\n\nThe former doesn't work well because you can have,\n\n```\nsage: f = huge_expression1 + huge_expression2\nsage: len(f)\n2\n```\n\nThe latter works comparably to the string length, but was slow as dirt (my implementation is lame). It could probably be improved, though. I would definitely include this if some pynac magic can speed it up.",

> Here's my proposal: by default, call Maxima's `rectform` and return that. Don't import anything from `complexity_measures.py` by default, but include documentation showing the user how to import that and use it in the keyword argument. 



But why introduce a default that's not useful? Unless you're setting up a toy example to show what `rectform` does, most expressions will be made uglier. Maxima's `rectform()` isn't labeled a simplification; if we're going to call it one, I think it should simplify.

If we call it a simplification and have it only do `rectform()` by default, we're essentially requiring the user to both read the docs and pass `make_it_work=True` on every invocation.


How many of our users are there that,

a. Know maxima **and** are familiar with its `rectform()` **and** don't know about expr.maxima_methods().rectform() **and** would expect `simplify_rectform()` to *just* call `rectform()`?
b. Use `simplify_foo()` and just want their expressions to get simpler.

I suspect (b) dwarfs (a).

I wouldn't mind if we just called it `Expression.rectform()` and documented what it does, but I also don't think that it would be as useful.




> (Also, how hard is it to count the number of operands in an expression? It's just `len`, right? If it isn't too hard, perhaps the documentation could show how to use that as a complexity measure.)





It depends on how thorough you want to be. A simple `len(expr)` will return the number of top-level operands. If you want to count all operands at any level, you either have to recurse (as I did), or know some shortcut.

The former doesn't work well because you can have,

```
sage: f = huge_expression1 + huge_expression2
sage: len(f)
2
```

The latter works comparably to the string length, but was slow as dirt (my implementation is lame). It could probably be improved, though. I would definitely include this if some pynac magic can speed it up.

Sure, I'll create another ticket for adding `Expression.rectform` (that one should be an easy review) and implement `simplify_rectform()` in terms of that. I'll try to do it later today.
