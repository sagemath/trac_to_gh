Ut oh, the word "monomial" turns out to be ambiguous!   There are two definitions!:

      http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monomial

And in Sage we evidently have *randomly* (?) and inconsistenly chosen between the two definitions, which is very unfortunate.  

```
sage: R.<x> =QQ[]  
sage: (2*x).is_monomial()     # definition 2 in univariate poly
True
sage: (x).is_monomial()  
True
sage: R.<x,y> =QQ[]
sage: (2*x).is_monomial()     # definition 1 in multivariate poly
False
sage: x.is_monomial()    
True
```

Etc.   Fortunately, `is_monomial()` is called in only about 5 or 6 places in the entire Sage source library, according to `search_src('is_monomial')`.

Reading the argument in Wikipedia further, and discussing this with Tom Boothby, we've decided the following would work for us. 

1. Introduce a new method `is_term`, which returns True for `a*x<sup>i*y</sup>j...`, i.e. it allows a coefficient.   Fortunately, `is_term` is currently used nowhere in Sage. 

2. Unify `is_monomial` to require the coefficient to be 1.  This means changing univariate polynomials to be consistent with multivariate polynomials.

File "/tmp/Sage/release/sage-4.7.2.alpha2/devel/sage/sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_element.py", line 101:

```
This doesn't happen with only this patch applied, and no other patch (merged so far) touches `sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_element.py` (nor `qqbar.py`).

No single of the other patches merged with this one seems to cause this doctest error alone, i.e., apparently only a combination.

(And it's *not* #10635.)

So was there ever a justification why it should be "-2"?

Oh, my bad; must have been blind or confused something when trying to track down another error.

The doctest failure most probably originates from the patch at #11725, so this ticket is certainly the wrong one to report on.

Sorry for the noise.
