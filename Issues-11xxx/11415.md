Not that it seems to be affecting anything, though one would think it would print things differently...

Anyway, I don't see that in the Ginac commit list, but I don't see it mentioned in any of the relevant tickets either.

Otherwise, so far, so good.  Now to look at the actual patches and tickets involved.  #9240 I will probably not get to right away.

Hi Karl,

Burcin introduced this on my report because gcc complains. See here [https://bitbucket.org/burcin/pynac/issue/2/correct-format-in-numericcpp](https://bitbucket.org/burcin/pynac/issue/2/correct-format-in-numericcpp). This is not about printing but about entering data if you look at the commit [https://bitbucket.org/burcin/pynac/changeset/3c39cd396893](https://bitbucket.org/burcin/pynac/changeset/3c39cd396893) this is in scanf not printf. So printing is not affected.

Thanks, Francois!  I have to say, David Kirkby would love this - someone fixing a **warning** and not just an actual error in an upstream package!  If you watch Sage compile, it's amazing just how many warnings there are - small wonder we need gcc!

And since I know very little about C and its derivatives (enough to get in trouble, I guess), that explanation was actually very helpful.

Now I just need to know the answer about the bitwise and versus boolean and.

But you wouldn't believe how widespread this one is. Just look at your singular build logs for example when you have time. 
I may attempt your other question but in #9240 (he says looking at his C manual and looking at the code).

I try to fix the warnings I know about. Thanks Francois for reporting the `%lf` issue.

Unfortunately the ones above are due to the python headers not declaring the `char*` arguments of some functions as const. I don't think it's a good idea to manually cast to a nonconstant type to suppress these warnings.


Many thanks for the reviews Karl-Dieter.
