Not that it seems to be affecting anything, though one would think it would print things differently...

Anyway, I don't see that in the Ginac commit list, but I don't see it mentioned in any of the relevant tickets either.

Otherwise, so far, so good.  Now to look at the actual patches and tickets involved.  #9240 I will probably not get to right away.

Hi Karl,

Burcin introduced this on my report because gcc complains. See here [https://bitbucket.org/burcin/pynac/issue/2/correct-format-in-numericcpp](https://bitbucket.org/burcin/pynac/issue/2/correct-format-in-numericcpp). This is not about printing but about entering data if you look at the commit [https://bitbucket.org/burcin/pynac/changeset/3c39cd396893](https://bitbucket.org/burcin/pynac/changeset/3c39cd396893) this is in scanf not printf. So printing is not affected.

Thanks, Francois!  I have to say, David Kirkby would love this - someone fixing a **warning** and not just an actual error in an upstream package!  If you watch Sage compile, it's amazing just how many warnings there are - small wonder we need gcc!

And since I know very little about C and its derivatives (enough to get in trouble, I guess), that explanation was actually very helpful.

Now I just need to know the answer about the bitwise and versus boolean and.

I try to fix the warnings I know about. Thanks Francois for reporting the `%lf` issue.

Unfortunately the ones above are due to the python headers not declaring the `char*` arguments of some functions as const. I don't think it's a good idea to manually cast to a nonconstant type to suppress these warnings.


Many thanks for the reviews Karl-Dieter.
