Replying to [@katestange](#comment%3A2):
> I think it would be helpful to describe the meaning of "restricted model" in a sentence in the documentation also.

I agree. "restricted type" is not standard terminology.   In my book I called the restricted models (over Q) "reduced" which is clear (I think!), but over number fields one has much more freedom:  even if there is a global minimal model, one can still scale by units [u,r,s,t] with r=s=t=0 (which makes a huge difference to the appearance of the equation, even for real quadratic fields;  here my choice would be, given a fixed set of fundamental units to scale so that the Discriminant lies in a certain fundamental region under the standard Euclidean embedding, up to translation by the images of the 12'th powers of units (which act discretely).  I did once implement that in Magma.  And then one still has to reduce modulo translations ([u,r,s,t] with u=1), where the standard thing to do is force a1,a2,a3 to be in a fixed "small" set of residues modulo 2, 3, 2.

This is tedious though not hard to implement, and then should (of course) be properly documented.

Most of what has been described above has been implemented:  global minimal models where they exist and semi-global minimal models otherwise in #18662 (but see also #19665).  Reduction via scaling by units was done earlier for real quadratic fields and has just been extended to the general case (#19689).

The above is reasonably well documented.  If you do not think so, say so here, otherwise this ticket will be closed.
