Hi Robert,

Good point, but I would still advocate replacing `simplify_full` by an elementwise method: not only does it restore the symmetry between `simplify_full` and the other elementwise methods, your code is also more robust and generic.  And since the docstring for `apply` already has a test for `simplify_full`, the changes are only minimal.

I've gone ahead and made this change to your patch.  If you agree with the changes, I'm ready to give this a positive review (not sure it's OK to do that, but the changes are very minimal).  If not, please delete my patch and I'll approve your original version instead.
