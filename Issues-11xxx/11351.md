```
sage-4.7.rc2 built on an opteron system [skynet:flavius (x86_64-Linux-k8-fc)] with `SAGE_FAT_BINARY="yes"`, and then moved to another x86_64-Linux system will fail with a segmentation fault on the following code:

```
set_random_seed(0)
p = next_prime(randrange(2^96))
q = next_prime(randrange(2^97))
n = p * q
qsieve(n) 
```

`qsieve` is from the flintqs-20070817 spkg, which by default builds
with `-march=opteron` on *all* x86_64 systems (*and* in 32-bit mode).

<div id="comment:2" align="right">Comment 2</div>

Quite messy.

We should just apply a single patch to the Makefile, and set / pass the appropriate variables (`CXXFLAGS`, `CXXINCS` -- usually `CPPFLAGS`, `LIBS`, perhaps `CXXFLAG64`, which we can put into `CXXFLAGS`).

Also, `$(CPP)` should be `$(CXX)`; the FLINT (1.5.x) Makefile is btw. equally bad.

`-m64` or an analogue (if `SAGE64=yes`) is only necessary on 64-bit platforms that default to 32-bit builds, i.e. SunOS / Solaris and MacOS X 10.5.


Using `stdint.h`, `uint32_t` and `uint64_t` would be more portable, too.

I would have been happy if some of that had been fixed *here*. The new spkg "works", so I didn't set the ticket to "needs work", but having a couple of scary Makefiles is still odd...
