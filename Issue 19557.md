is there a difference between `sage -i sage_mode` and `sage -i sage-mode`?  (I haven't got my computer with me right now, but sage-mode-0.6 looks ancient, see https://bitbucket.org/gvol/sage-mode/overview)

Good point, `sage -p sage-mode` is the old-style spkg which you never want to install. I removed this particular ancient cruft once before since people trip over this on a weekly basis but then it was reverted in the name of backward compatibility. We deleted the old sage-mode.spkg from our servers but since you have a local copy it is used anyways.
