is there a difference between `sage -i sage_mode` and `sage -i sage-mode`?  (I haven't got my computer with me right now, but sage-mode-0.6 looks ancient, see https://bitbucket.org/gvol/sage-mode/overview)

Good point, `sage -p sage-mode` is the old-style spkg which you never want to install. I removed this particular ancient cruft once before since people trip over this on a weekly basis but then it was reverted in the name of backward compatibility. We deleted the old sage-mode.spkg from our servers but since you have a local copy it is used anyways.

Ok, thank you! `sage -p sage_mode` indeed worked fine! Sorry, I was not aware of this difference.

Changing status from new to needs_review.

This is just a misusage of Sage, not a bug of any kind (except the presence of the tarball on the repository that Volker fixed).

Determined to be invalid/duplicate/wontfix (closing as "wontfix" as a catch-all resolution).
