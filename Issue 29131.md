Given the discussion

https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/vYlbnAwKATM%5B51-75%5D

we make no promise of compatibility with py2, starting from 9.1 onwards.
But we also try not to introduce incompatible code for some time.
So the present ticket is ok, as it only removes code and moreover people should not expect to be able to use deprecated sageNB with the latest python3-enabled sage.
