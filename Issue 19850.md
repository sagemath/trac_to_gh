If `E` is an `Encoder` for a `LinearCode`, one can use `E.encode(message)`, where `message` is in the appropriate space. `E(message)` should default to the same behaviour.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/20087

I added the same mechanism with codes: let `C` be a code, and `m` an element from the message space of the encoder `'encoder'`.

`C(m, encoder_name='encoder')` is now a shortcut to `C.encode(m, encoder_name='encoder')`

There's a doctest failing which indicates the test suite is broken for codes.
That's because in the test suite, there's an idempotency test for element construction.

It picks `c = C.an_element()` and then tries `C(c)`... Which of course fails in our case as `__call__` has been redefined as `encode` - and the input of encode cannot be an element of `C`.

David, didn't you accidentally put the Encoder-related code on the GRS encoder? It should be on the abstract class `Encoder`. Also, the check `if m in self` should be `if m in self.code()` on the Encoder. And your doc-test there doesn't test that method.

Hello,

> David, didn't you accidentally put the Encoder-related code on the GRS encoder? 

Indeed, I removed it.

> It should be on the abstract class Encoder.

Should it? IMHO, there's nothing elaborate to do for the encoder. If one creates a code `C` and an encoder `E` for `C`, and types `E(c)` for some `c`, if `c` does not belong to the message space of `E` it should fail. To me, the only purpose of an encoder is to transform elements of the message space into codeword. So if one passes an element which does not belong to the message space, failing makes sense.

I think he meant if one tries to pass an element of the ambient space of the code which does not belong to the code. I added a check for that: as I cannot picture an encoder whose message space is the ambient space of the code, it makes sense to immediately reject vectors which are in the ambient space but not in the code, as it avoids calling `encode` and thus constructing an encoder for nothing.

Ouch, that's a super-nasty trap! All encoders written in the future will fall into this!

I vote for *not* defining `Encoder.__call__` as an alias, then, but instead rely on dynamic dispatch to avoid the trap:


```
    def __call__(self, m):
        return self.encode(m)
```
