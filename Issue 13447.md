Currently, `_ntl_rep_abs()` is incorrect for some extension fields::


```
sage: K=Zp(3,3)
sage: R.<a>=K[]
sage: L.<a>=K.extension(a^2-3)
sage: L(3)._ntl_rep_abs()
([57], 0)
```


The correct result here would be `([3],0)`.

The attached patch fixes this.

There was a problem in `_internal_lshift()`. I rewrote it to use multiplications of the form `x^e/p` which can be done without a precision loss.

It initially took me a while to understand what `_ntl_rep_abs()` does. I reformatted it heavily in this patch but I (hopefully) did not change what it does at all. I hope it's easier to understand now.

This also fixes a `todo` in the code:

```
sage: ZZ(W(5)) # todo: this should be different...

It seems that roed wrote that todo a few years ago. (added him as CC)
