# Issue 27260: Metaticket: move all references to master bibliography file

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27497

Original creator: jhpalmieri

Original creation time: 2019-03-15 20:14:02

Most of Sage's references are in the master bibliography file, `src/doc/en/reference/references/index.rst`, but a few directories need attention.

- combinat
- graphs
- rings
- schemes

The attached files are the output from commands like `grep -R "\.\.[ ]* \[" src/sage/combinat`.

Ticket retargeted after milestone closed (if you don't believe this ticket is appropriate for the Sage 8.8 release please retarget manually)

As the Sage-8.8 release milestone is pending, we should delete the sage-8.8 milestone for tickets that are not actively being worked on or that still require significant work to move forward.  If you feel that this ticket should be included in the next Sage release at the soonest please set its milestone to the next release milestone (sage-8.9).
