In the line

```
+.. [Mil1978] S. Milne, *A q-analog of restricted growth functions, Dobinsky’s equality and Charlier polynomials*. Trans. Amer. Math. Soc., 245 (1978), 89–118.
```

avoid using unicode dash between page numbers (use minus sign - instead), and use `\S` for the first name (obscure sphinx bug).

Once done, you can set to positive
