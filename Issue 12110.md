If the environment variable `TERMCAP` is set and `TERM` is not set, then calling `tgetent()` from the termcap library produces a Segmentation Fault because it calls `strcmp()` with a NULL argument.  Sage hits this problem because of readline, see #11970.

To reproduce this issue: let `tgetent_test.c` be the file

```
#include <termcap.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
    char* buf = malloc(100000);
    tgetent(buf, "dumb");
    printf("Successful!\n");
}
```

Now compile and link this with Sage's `libtermcap.a` (don't use `-ltermcap`, instead explicitly specify the path to the `libtermcap.a` file):

```
$ gcc tgetent_test.c local/lib/libtermcap.a -o tgetent_test
```

Run this with `TERMCAP` set but `TERM` unset:

```
$ unset TERM
$ export TERMCAP="x"
$ ./tgetent_test
Segmentation fault
```

Not reported upstream because there is no known contact person nor bug report page.

There is more info at #11970.  It's a combination of the new readline spkg at #11970 and the patch at #12263, and it also depends on the gcc version.

> but are you sure this is the right behaviour when TERM is unset? I'd probably expect an unset TERM to behave the same as an empty TERM.

In practice, this will be the case.  The `tgetent()` code checks whether the argument `char *term` equals the environment variable "TERM".  Normally, `term` will not be the empty string.  But you are certainly right that

```
term_name = getenv("TERM");
if (!term_name)
    term_name = "";
```
would also work.

Well, William's change(s) are more or less superfluous anyway, so I'd drop them.  (I looked at the spkg a while ago, but the little changes weren't worth a ticket or new spkg.

* Instead of changing the target `all`, we should use `$MAKE libtermcap.a`, then the info files won't get built, and hence not installed (also **without** commenting out the `for` loop).

* Commenting out `oldinstalldir=...` isn't necessary, but also wrong; it should either be set to the empty string, or (if we assume nobody builds Sage as root) left as is, since the lines of the receipt that try to install into `/usr/include` are preceded by dashs anyway, i.e. `make` doesn't fail because of lacking file permissions.

In the latter case we wouldn't have to patch the Makefile at all.

(Slightly OT: Should we in general issue a warning -- or abort the build -- if someone builds Sage as root?)




Another minor thing: In `spkg-install`, `-m64` should be **ap**pended, since it should take precedence over whatever a user specified in `CFLAGS`.

Maybe you are right, but I don't want to make these minor changes now in this blocker ticket.  If you want to make a follow-up ticket for the above, go ahead.

Luckily, there is no need to review the Makefile.  This is an old patch which was directly applied to the src/ directory, instead of being applied by `spkg-install`.  I restored the upstream sources and made an explicit patch.  So the file `patches/Makefile.patch` doesn't need to be reviewed for this ticket.

Two further remarks:

* `TERMCAP` is incidentally set by `$SAGE_ROOT/spkg/install` (like a couple of other "abused" environment variables).

* readline isn't supposed to use *Sage's* termcap; the p4 at #11970 avoids its use under all circumstances (perhaps unless one manually adds `-L$SAGE_LOCAL/lib/` to `LDFLAGS` or the like).

In principle we could drop the spkg, since there are [newer] replacements on every supported system AFAIK.

One more thing: *Chang**e**log* lacks an *"e"* in `SPKG.txt`.

I'd rename `Makefile.patch` to `Makefile.in.patch` to avoid confusion.

Look into (e.g.) `pari-*/src/config/get_readline`.

PARI usually looks for readline, and then ncurses, then eventually gives libtermcap a try (for `tgetent()`; but apparently only in conjunction with readline).
