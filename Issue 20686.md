Quite a few good things in there. Of course, I pushed for some of the sphinx trouble to be fixed upstream in 1.4.4.
May want to be careful with the next numpy upgrade, upstream has broken my patch in master and I haven't fixed it yet.

Does it affect the html doc or just generating pdf with an alternative to pdftex (which one)?
