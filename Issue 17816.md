# Issue 17816: Move all cython() functions in one place

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: jdemeyer

Original creation time: 2015-03-25 11:24:41

Currently we have
* `src/sage/misc/cython.py`
* `src/sage/misc/cython_c.pyx`
* `src/sage/server/support.py`

which all contain Cython-related functions calling eachother in complicated ways.

As a first step towards a clean-up, move everything in one file.
