Keywords: cygwin spkg libgap

We need to pass -no-undefined to libtool, the proper place is in libgap_la_LDFLAGS, potentially  only on Cygwin and other Windows systems (have a look in GMP/MPIR/MPFR for examples), but should not hurt anyway elsewhere if added unconditionally.

(By the way the spkg-install script is terrible, does not use $MAKE, use [ ] and [This is the Trac macro * * that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros# -macro), sets CXXFLAGS but does not export it...)

I've had a quick look at the spkg and it seems fine except there should be only one dash in front of no-undefined (not sure though putting two will break things).

The spkg-install cript looks cleaner.
Would you mind replacing the last double brackets by simple ones?
The use of double brackets does not seem necerssary for the simple tests involved.

A line for the version bump in SPKG.txt would be nice as well.

It should fix things on Cygwin (I crafted my own spkg yesterday and everything went fine, see CygwinPort).
The question should then rather be: Does it break things on other systems? (it should not.)

Long-style is `--no-undefined` (two dashes), short is `-z`. ld is being nice and also accepts the mongrel `-no-undefined` but we shouldn't rely on that imho.

I made the other cosmetic changes.

It doesn't break anything on Linux. After you review the spkg, the buildbot will catch anything that breaks on exotic platforms.

Its not an ld flag its a libtool one and its definitely one dash.
The fact that libtool does not follow usual conventions is another problem.

Specifying -no-undefined only for CYGWIN will fix this. I don't know how to do this properly, though. Any tips?

And I don't really feel #14057 could fix anything here.
It provides a fix for Python and it does not seem to me that libgap links to Python anyway...
But I agree we would need a similar fix in libgap, that is properly define environ in libgap (src/libgap.c) and not assume it is available.

I wonder if this is actually an OSX-specific  libgap bug, to use `-undefined dynamic_lookup` to get `environ`.
(or maybe this part of the code is never used in libgap setting)

[OSX docs](http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man7/environ.7.html) say that it's recommended to use `getenv()` etc, but that's GAPs design to use `environ` directly (and it's needed for `spawn()` etc there).  
And `environ` is not available to shared libraries, according to [loc.cit.](http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man7/environ.7.html), and one should use `_NSGetEnviron()` routine from `<crt_externs.h>`. (So one could add this to `src/sysfiles.c` if needed.)

Whatever, I guess that passing -no-undefined to libtool just overrides its default behavior to pass -undefined dynamic_lookup to ld on OS X.

So we have two solutions:

My understanding from e.g. [this thread](http://www.mail-archive.com/bug-gnulib`@`gnu.org/msg09272.html) is that `extern char** environ` with `-no-undefined` for a shared library used with the OSX ld  and `_NSGetEnviron()` lead to equivalent results.

The spkg is updated (I've not commited anything as I don't want to deal with the external repository hell).

And I still do not understand what you meant after reading all the thread.
The last message basically says that using _NSGetEnviron() worked, and in other messages its told that the solution used is not to remove no-undefined but to use _NSGetEnviron().

By ld do you mean run-time linking? because I don't think its ld that takes care of that.
And passing -undefined dynamic_lookup won't let ld resolve anything at linking time.
It is just a promise that at runtime environ will be available somehow, which could perfectly not be the case if the proper libraries are not loaded.

OK, it builds and seemingly works.

No, I think it says that the library built with the -undefined dynamic_lookup option works.

OK, here is the example:

```
$ cat enlib.c
extern char** environ;
char *** environ_addr (void) { return &environ; }

$ glibtool --mode=compile gcc -c enlib.c 
glibtool: compile:  gcc -c enlib.c  -fno-common -DPIC -o .libs/enlib.o
glibtool: compile:  gcc -c enlib.c -o enlib.o >/dev/null 2>&1

$ glibtool --mode=link gcc -o libenlib.la enlib.lo -rpath /tmp
glibtool: link: rm -fr  .libs/libenlib.a .libs/libenlib.la
glibtool: link: gcc -dynamiclib -Wl,-undefined -Wl,dynamic_lookup -o .libs/libenlib.0.dylib  .libs/enlib.o      -install_name  /tmp/libenlib.0.dylib -compatibility_version 1 -current_version 1.0 -Wl,-single_module
glibtool: link: dsymutil .libs/libenlib.0.dylib || :
warning: no debug symbols in executable (-arch x86_64)
glibtool: link: (cd ".libs" && rm -f "libenlib.dylib" && ln -s "libenlib.0.dylib" "libenlib.dylib")
glibtool: link: (cd ".libs" && rm -f "libenlib.0.0.0.dylib" && ln -s "libenlib.0.dylib" "libenlib.0.0.0.dylib")
glibtool: link: ar cru .libs/libenlib.a  enlib.o
glibtool: link: ranlib .libs/libenlib.a
glibtool: link: ( cd ".libs" && rm -f "libenlib.la" && ln -s "../libenlib.la" "libenlib.la" )

$ cat en.c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <crt_externs.h>
#define macenviron (*_NSGetEnviron())
extern char *** environ_addr (void); /* comes from my enlib */
int main()
{
  printf(" from the shared lib:\n  %s \n", **environ_addr());
  printf(" from macenviron :\n  %s \n", *macenviron);
}

$ glibtool --mode=link gcc -o en en.c libenlib.la 
glibtool: link: gcc -o .libs/en en.c  ./.libs/libenlib.0.0.0.dylib

$ ./en
 from the shared lib:
  NNTPSERVER=news.gmane.org 
 from macenviron :
  NNTPSERVER=news.gmane.org 
```


So you see, it works with `-undefined dynamic_lookup` just fine. (printf(%s) isn't the rght way of parsing of environ, so the output is cut at the first \n, I guess).

Volker, would you mind integrating the changes from the last version I posted "upstream" and repackage a "proper" spkg?

Dima, could you give it a shot on Mac OS so that we we put it as positive review?
As far as I'm cocnerned, everything looks fine.
