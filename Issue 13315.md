The `sage.gsl.interpolation.Spline` class does not recompute the spline when the interpolation points are changed:


```
sage: S = spline([(1,1), (2,3), (4,5), (5, 4)]); S
[(1, 1), (2, 3), (4, 5), (5, 4)]
sage: S(4.1)
4.953437500000001
sage: del S[1]; S
[(1, 1), (4, 5), (5, 4)]
sage: S(4.1)
4.953437500000001
sage: S.append((4, 100)); S
[(1, 1), (4, 5), (5, 4), (4, 100)]
sage: S(4.1)
4.953437500000001
```

which is just a rounding issue. The rest of the documentation has 16 numbers after the decimal.

Also I think you should use single backticks to get math mode and double backticks for inline code in the documentation, and use the automatic trac link `:trac:'13519'` where the single quotes are backticks (since I don't know how to get the escape to work here) instead of !#13519 on line 131.

Hey Travis, nice catch. I've uploaded a new version of the patch, where I've made the following changes: 

1. I didn't have the rounding issue on my machine, but to make things more robust I've replaced the last few digits of each repeating decimal expansion by an ellipsis. 
2. I've incorporated the automatic links to trac and the formatting for math mode and inline code. I've also made this change elsewhere in the file, so the resulting patch is a little larger than the previous one, but all the new changes just concern formatting.

Let me know if you have any further suggestions for changes.
