Changing keywords from "" to "random_fail".

The lines with `: not found` at the end are where in a normal install I can see this line: ` /bin/sh ../libtool   --mode=install /usr/bin/install -c   libpynac.la '/home/ralf/sage/local/lib'`, so presumably this has something to do with `libtool`?

I think the `: not found` comes from the `find` command getting its argument(s) from a backtick expansion, but that the expansion does not yield file names but lines of a script. The script looks like the content of the `install-libLTLIBRARIES` target code starting from its 3rd line. Something like this should not happen(tm), and even more, not sporadically.

In summary I think this is a rare problem with GNU make. At least there were no recent Pynac changes that can even potentially trigger such behaviour.

Does this happen on one particular system or several systems?

It seems to me indeed a strange problem with either `make` or `sh`. Somehow the shell commands are totally misparsed. First of all, since we get an error message for every individual line, the backslash-newline escaping doesn't work. Then it also seems like the whole line is interpreted as 1 command: the shell is literally trying to run the single program `if test -f $p; then \` instead of parsing it as code.

So far I've only observed it once.

What about the 

```
make[4]: Entering directory `/home/buildbot/slave/sage_git/build/local/var/tmp/sage/build/pynac-0.7.4/src/ginac'
make[5]: Entering directory `/home/buildbot/slave/sage_git/build/local/var/tmp/sage/build/pynac-0.7.4/src/ginac'
```

It seems that there are two parallel make processes in the ginac subdirectory; If one is writing the install-libLTLIBRARIES script while the other is executing it the observed error  could easily happen.

What normally seems to happen is that make "puts a child on the chain" to remake the target (output snippet from `make -d`):

```
   Finished prerequisites of target file 'install-libLTLIBRARIES'.
  Must remake target 'install-libLTLIBRARIES'.
make[2]: Entering directory '/home/ralf/sage/pynac/ginac'
Putting child 0x23c1f50 (install-libLTLIBRARIES) PID 29581 on the chain.
Live child 0x23c1f50 (install-libLTLIBRARIES) PID 29581 
 /usr/bin/mkdir -p '/usr/local/lib64'
 /bin/sh ../libtool   --mode=install /usr/bin/install -c   libpynac.la '/usr/local/lib64'
```
