This is definitely a fix, but is it the correct fix? The `PolynomialSequence` does not seem to pickle immutability like I think it should:

```
sage: theta.__reduce__()[1][3]['__im_gens']
[y, x]
sage: S = theta.__reduce__()[1][3]['__im_gens']
sage: type(S)
<class 'sage.rings.polynomial.multi_polynomial_sequence.PolynomialSequence_generic'>
sage: S.is_immutable()
True
sage: loads(dumps(S)).is_immutable()
False
```

Contrast:

```
sage: S.__reduce__()
(<function PolynomialSequence at 0x7f62c7ef2c80>,
 (Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y over Rational Field, ((y, x),)))
sage: Sequence([1,2,3,4]).__reduce__()
(<function _reconstructor at 0x7f64198a5aa0>,
 (<class 'sage.structure.sequence.Sequence_generic'>,
  <type 'sage.structure.sage_object.SageObject'>,
  <sage.structure.sage_object.SageObject object at 0x7f62b02dc0b0>),
 {'_Sequence_generic__cr': False,
  '_Sequence_generic__cr_str': False,
  '_Sequence_generic__hash': None,
  '_Sequence_generic__universe': Integer Ring,
  '_is_immutable': False})
```

What are your thoughts about instead adjusting the pickling of `PolynomialSequence`?

I agree with you, Travis.

I pushed a fix for the pickling of `PolynomialSequence`. I'm not sure I've done it correctly (in particular, this class redefines `__getattr__`, I don't know why); please review :-)
