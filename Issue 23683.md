This should be ready to go. This refactors the comparison of ideals in multi-variate polynomial rings. Comparison is now meaning "for containment" in all cases.

Besides, it tries to avoid computing Grobner bases, by first comparing the generators.

Please review.

Rather than comparing gens as a list, I would compare them as sets. That way, reordering of gens doesn't require a GB computation, e.g.:

```
sage: R.<x,y> = ZZ[]
sage: I = R.ideal([x^2, x*y - y^2 + 2])
sage: Ip = R.ideal([x*y - y^2 + 2, x^2])
sage: I.gens()
[x^2, x*y - y^2 + 2]
sage: Ip.gens()
[x*y - y^2 + 2, x^2]
sage: I == Ip   # Avoid GB here
True
```


Also, what is the rationale for this change:

* The changes in scheme_morphisms and dynamical systems could probably be made independently now, even if at some point they were intertwined with the main issue here.

* the precise change you talk about was made so that one could replace comparison of domains (in dynamical systems) with a call to is_endomorphism.
