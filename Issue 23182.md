The semantics of both Python types and Cython types have changed a lot since `is_extension_type()` was first written. In order to make it more clear why `is_extension_type()` is used, I suggest to replace it by more specific function.

In this ticket, I implement a new function `can_assign_class(obj)` to determine whether `obj.__class__` can be assigned to.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/23419

I think we should hide `_underlying_class` from the public interface (well, specifically tab-completion).

Also, why the change in the test order?

```diff
-            if not issubclass(self.__class__, Sets_parent_class) and not is_extension_type(self.__class__):
+            if can_assign_class(self) and not issubclass(self.__class__, Sets_parent_class):
```

(I don't object, but I am curious if there is a reason.)

Efficiency. Checking `can_assign_class` is very fast, so it's good to do that first.
