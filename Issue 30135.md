as observed in #30360, 

```
sage: K3.<a> = NumberField(x^3+x^2+1, latex_name=['alpha'])                                                                         
sage: K3.latex_variable_names()                                                                                                     
['a']
sage: K3.latex_variable_name()                                                                                                      
'alpha'
```

We fix this by changing the attribute `__latex_variable_name`, only used in `NumberField_generic`, to the widely used `_latex_names`.


We also deprecate the method `latex_variable_name`, which is also only used in `sage.rings.number_field`, changing its uses to `latex_variable_names`.
