This patch breaks the doctests of the function! So we need to edit those doctests. But...

You said on #10497:
> Though if I remember correctly the french lines have been removed recently in an unrelated patch by David Coudert `:-D`

Well, this patch is at least not merged in 5.0.rc1, since the French lines in the docstring are still there - if I am to edit the doctests, I should know where that patch is, so I don't conflict with it. But because the patch is unrelated, I can't search for it - do you remember which patch it is? (Here is an example of why one should keep unrelated changes out of patches! :P)

Oh, right !

These changes have been made in #12743 (thank you David for reminding me ! `:-D`), and will be merged into Sage-5.1-beta0.

Patch updated !

Oh, good, it doesn't conflict with these lines at all :) Passes full doctests as well. Positive review!
