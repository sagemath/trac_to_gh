What's up with this change, is it intentional?

No, it is not, there should be no differences in the working tree between the current spkg and the new one (the only change should be the in the repository). I'll look into what I did wrong.

Ok fixed. To resolve this ticket I introduce two commits: one to merge the unused head, and the second to revert any changes brought about by the merge (which is just the diff that you show).
