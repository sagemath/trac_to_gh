I've heard that once upon a time there was a bot that created trac issues based on github PRs. Apparently the bot was lost.

I found https://github.com/trac-hacks/trac-github which has the feature to "update the local git mirror used by Trac after each push to [GitHub](GitHub), and notify the new changesets to Trac;". Sounds like this is exactly what would be needed to allow PRs from github.
I couldn't find anything on how to install trac plugins here on sage.

Is this functionality that we want? There are several warnings about how the sage github repo doesn't accept PRs and to instead use trac.

The bot to turn pull requests to the SageMath repo at GitHub
into Trac tickets once existed.

In a [2014-08 sage-devel discussion](https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/5d9NfgZJDmw/m/mrchAwmwB-0J), Robert described:

> All pull requests on github turn into tickets, so this easy web
> interface flow works now.

The bot stopped working around mid 2015.

If you really want to do this I would recommend looking at the gitlab hook in the Trac plugin (ironically still hosted on GH though I would prefer to move it): https://github.com/sagemath/sage_trac_plugin/blob/master/sage_trac/gitlab.py

Most of this could be refactored to abstract out the [GitLab](GitLab) and [GitHub](GitHub) API differences.  Personally I am not motivated to do it though.
