Keywords: submodule

Currently, submodules do not inherit grading from its ambient.


```
sage: M = ModulesWithBasis(QQ).Graded().example()
sage: M(Partition((4,2,1,1,1,1))).degree()
10
sage: N = M.submodule([M(Partition((4,2,1,1,1,1)))], category=GradedModulesWithBasis(QQ))
sage: n = N.basis()
sage: n[0].degree()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
AttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)
...
AttributeError: 'SubmoduleWithBasis_with_category' object has no attribute 'degree_on_basis'
```


Ideally, the enhancement works for 'degree' and 'maximal degree'. It should also work for arbitrary layers of submoduling.

The current behavior is correct because there is no guarantee that an *arbitrary* submodule is spanned by homogeneous elements. For a simple example, take the submodule spanned by `f = 1 + x` in the polynomial ring with the natural degree grading. (There are more pathological examples for the counterarguments I can see for this.)

Now we could do something where we check to see if the spanning elements are homogeneous and then use the ambient grading. This then likely has a solution at the category level by creating the category of subobjects of graded modules with basis and graded modules (with basis). (Note as I argue above, this is a strict subcategory of subobjects of graded modules with basis.) This might be slightly subtle as, in principle, by saying an object is graded, you are suppose to specify what graded structure you want. Thus doing it automatically is perhaps not quite mathematically valid.

This has the advantage of being explicit about the grading structure you want (the inherited one), not having to be very careful about adding the new category, and will likely be faster. It also means we don't have to add checks for homogeneity when someone might not want/need it.

For your immediate computational purposes, you can monkey patch in a degree by

```python
def degree(self):
    return self.lift().degree()
```

Note, as mentioned above, you have told the object that it is a graded module without specifying what the graded structure is. So this is a reasonable hack until a more long-term solution is implemented.

The situation for filtered modules is perhaps easier as we do not need to contend with homogeneity issues.

Would it make sense to use 'maximal_degree' for the grading for the submodule by default?

I am still -1 on having by default a submodule inherit a grading. There is no reason to slow down code to test for homogeneity. If you want to inherit a grading, it should be a separate method (which returns a separate (sub)class). I would be *very* upset if I couldn't build a submodule of a graded module of nonhomogeneous elements as this is a natural thing to do.

You have a contradiction: the category has a default grading and a special method saying inherit the grading. This is telling you that the category should *not* have the default grading. Let me again say that you need to create a separate *class* for the graded module and for filtered modules you can do this at the category level.

Note that formal power series is still a *filtered* module. For filtered modules, there is a unique way to do this because for any `x` there is a *unique* minimal (or maximal for a descending filteration) index `i` such that `x \in S_i`. Contrast this with the graded case.

I think we should also override the `submodule` implementation for `FilteredModulesWithBasis` to make the category filtered by default since this is unambiguous.

You can pass it the correct category in that case. The default category for `submodule` is `ModulesWithBasis(R).Suobjects()`. These might make for good convenience methods, but we get a bit of a combinatorial explosion when we want different objects/categories (e.g., rings, Hopf algebras, etc.) that is already handled by the categories themselves (or at least those where the generic implementations are sufficient).

As long as there is either no homogeneity enforced when the category is not `GradedModulesWithBasis(R).Subobjects()`, then this shouldn't be a problem. In fact, if we do override `GradedModulesWithBasis(R).submodule()`, we can return the filtered category when given inhomogeneous elements.

I am sure there are depending on how explicit you want. `Hom` would be an essential case, other examples could be the `radical` of a Hopf algebra (it looses the Hopf part, there are others like this) or `invariant_module` (loses the ring structure if the action is not by automorphisms), and `submodule` has always allowed this:

Free module generated by {0} over Rational Field

 and Category of vector spaces with basis over Rational Field
 and Category of subobjects of sets

It is indirectly there by the center construction via `submodule` as the category needs to be passed.

Currently, but we would change this default, right?

OK, perhaps a way to think about this is that the word `submodule` indicates in what sense the resulting object is generated, not in what category it lies. 

So if the object generated as a submodule happens to be a graded submodule (in the sense of the functorial construction of `GradedModulesWithBasis(R).Subobjects()`), we put it in that category.

Now what if `self` is a `GradedAlgebraWithBasis(R)` and we call `submodule` on it, if the result happens to be a graded subalgebra (in the sense of its functorial construction), would we also be allowed to put it in that category?

Only for those cases that it makes sense for:

- Submodules of filtered modules are naturally filtered.
- Possibly submodules of graded modules generated by homogeneous elements are naturally graded.

Yes to both. That's what I am now proposing, which was one of Louis's earlier suggestions.

Definitely if no category is specified. I am not sure it is worth the code complexity and CPU cycles to verify the user has given us good input by checking the passed category is a subcategory and the homogeneity.

Great!

In this doctest:

```
If ``category`` is specified, then it does not give any extra
+            structure to the submodule (we can think of this as applying
+            the forgetful functor)::
+

+                sage: SM.category()
+                Join of Category of finite dimensional modules with basis over Rational Field
+                 and Category of vector spaces with basis over Rational Field
+                 and Category of subobjects of sets
+                sage: FM = E.submodule([x + 1, x*y - x*y*z], category=ModulesWithBasis(QQ))

+                Join of Category of finite dimensional modules with basis over Rational Field
+                 and Category of vector spaces with basis over Rational Field

+
```


it looks like the category is not quite right yet. Apart from the confusion with "Join of ... finite-dimensional modules, vector spaces" that is unrelated to this ticket, shouldn't it be at least in the category of subobjects of modules?

The subobjects of modules is the join of subobjects of sets and vector spaces. We just do not have that specific category defined (hence the join of those two).

I fixed the bug, which came down to not getting the correct type for the generator input to `submodule`.

Most of the other doctests are trivial updating. I think there are some new doctests added since beta1 (which is what I am currently using to work on this branch) to update. I still need to do that, which I probably won't do until tomorrow. However, two notable changes:

- I believe the change in `modules_with_basis.py` was needed from a doctest copy/paste that was not fully updated. I think that kind of input is an abuse and the user should explicitly change the ring of the element as there is no, a priori, relation between the two modules.
- The change of the base ring of `Sym` in `matrix_space.py` is because I was getting an unable-to-resolve-MRO issue that I could not reproduce in a more isolated example:
  {{{
TypeError: Cannot create a consistent method resolution order (MRO) for bases
 VectorSpaces.subcategory_class, GradedModules.subcategory_class
  }}}
  This doesn't change the content of that doctest, but allows us to continue to sidestep this MRO resolution issue (see, e.g., #22962).
