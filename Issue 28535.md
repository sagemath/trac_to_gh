# Issue 28535: Kneading sequences for the doubling map

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28772

Original creator: jdoyle

Original creation time: 2019-11-19 17:28:28

Keywords: sd104, mandelbrot

Given an angle theta in RR/ZZ, the _kneading sequence_ of theta is a binary string that gives information about the dynamics of theta under the doubling map. These combinatorial kneading sequences are useful for understanding dynamics near the roots of hyperbolic components of the Mandelbrot set.

LGTM. I resolved the merge conflict and made a few minor edits. This is not my ticket, but it has been sitting for a month and I am working on other functions in the same file (see #28923), so I would like to see this closed.

Fixed an error that was reported by pyflakes. (`DynamicalSystem` was imported twice.) Please review again.

There is a (minor) merge conflict with #28557. I resolved the conflict and will upload the PR after I have tested it.
