this is from the latest alpha2 (commit a960857c7d8e5ea7c4d4c2958e38ec52778d85d9)

Patches still need to be sorted out.

OK, can be tested now. All our patches got upstreamed, so they are gone now.

Neither arb 2.16 nor 2.17 work with this version of Flint.

One gets

One apparently may use arb patch: https://github.com/fredrik-johansson/arb/commit/d3d9983231e0f034e86a1e75761627eb8213b704.patch - trying this with arb 2.17.0 now.

Comment by fredrik.johansson created at 2020-05-21 13:42:33

Yes, there will be an immediate new Arb release. The current git master ought to work.

there are doctest errors (I made https://github.com/dimpase/arb/releases/tag/2.17.1, and removed all the arb patches)

OK, I ended up using arb patch: â€‹https://github.com/fredrik-johansson/arb/commit/d3d9983231e0f034e86a1e75761627eb8213b704.patch
with arb 2.16.0 (the arb version in Sage now), and get one flint-related regression (a segfault)

```

experiments tell that precision  needs to be at least 25 for this example to run, i.e. this works:

```
sage: monsky_washnitzer.matrix_of_frobenius_hyperelliptic(x^5 - 2*x + 3, 5, 25)
```

But this works:

```
sage: R.<x> = QQ['x']
sage: C=HyperellipticCurve(x^5 - 2*x + 3)
sage: A,f=monsky_washnitzer.matrix_of_frobenius_hyperelliptic(C,5,3)
sage: A
[            4*5 + O(5^3)       5 + 2*5^2 + O(5^3) 2 + 3*5 + 2*5^2 + O(5^3)     2 + 5 + 5^2 + O(5^3)]
[      3*5 + 5^2 + O(5^3)             3*5 + O(5^3)             4*5 + O(5^3)         2 + 5^2 + O(5^3)]
[    4*5 + 4*5^2 + O(5^3)     3*5 + 2*5^2 + O(5^3)       5 + 3*5^2 + O(5^3)     2*5 + 2*5^2 + O(5^3)]
[            5^2 + O(5^3)       5 + 4*5^2 + O(5^3)     4*5 + 3*5^2 + O(5^3)             2*5 + O(5^3)]
```


So, apparently, some initialisation is missing, if C is created on the fly.

This is reproducible on the ticket branch, on Fedora 30 and on Debian 10.
This works:

```
sage: R.<x> = QQ['x']
sage: C=HyperellipticCurve(x^5 - 2*x + 3)
sage: A,f=monsky_washnitzer.matrix_of_frobenius_hyperelliptic(C,5,3)
sage: A
```

but

```
sage: R.<x> = QQ['x']
sage: A,f = monsky_washnitzer.matrix_of_frobenius_hyperelliptic(x^5 - 2*x + 3, 5, 3)
```

segfaults.

Comment by fredrik.johansson created at 2020-05-22 12:42:41

Dima, thanks for reporting the Arb doctest failures.

The slight regressions in accuracy for elliptic_pi, elliptic_pi_inc and elliptic_rj are due to using a different algorithm to compute the R_J function for certain complex parameters. The new algorithm is a bit slower and less accurate, but unlike the old algorithm always gives the right branch. These doctest results just need to be updated.

Unfortunately, the new algorithm doesn't work when phi is an inexact multiple of pi/2, leading to the NaN values. There is a workaround: acb_elliptic_pi_inc takes a pi flag to multiply the argument by pi exactly, so if you add a pi flag to the Sage wrapper and pass in phi=0.5 with pi=True in the doctest, it should give the expected result.

It's theoretically possible to fix these regressions, and I will open an Arb issue for it, but I'm not keen to spend time on it any time soon.

The other two examples look correct: converting an Arb number to an MPFR now rounds according to MPFR semantics (including rounding to infinity) instead of abort()ing when the exponents are out of range for MPFR.

Comment by dimpase created at 2020-05-22 15:50:57

This works too:

```
sage: sage: R.<x> = QQ['x']
....: sage: C=HyperellipticCurve(x^5 - 2*x + 7)
....: sage: A,f = monsky_washnitzer.matrix_of_frobenius_hyperelliptic(x^5-2*x+3, 5, 3)
```

That is, apparently, some kind of Flint initialisation needs to happen before
the latter function can be called.

here it is one step closer to the bug:

```

with Flint 2.5.2, it prints

```

as it should.

and one more step further - basically, creating HyperellipticCurve over Z mod 625
does not work:

```
sage: R.<x> = QQ['x']
sage: Q=x^5 - 2*x + 3
sage: HyperellipticCurve(Q.change_ring(Integers(5**4)))

OK, so this seems to be a basic `Polynomial_zmod_flint` problem:

```
sage: R.<x> = QQ['x']
sage: Q=x^5 - 2*x + 3
sage: Qm=Q.change_ring(Integers(5**4))
sage: F=4*Qm
sage: F.gcd(F.derivative())
Flint exception (Impossible inverse):
    Cannot invert modulo 5*0
-------------------------
boom...
```


(this happily returns `1` with Flint 2.5.2)

So this is not really a specific p-adic problem at all.

Changing status from needs_work to needs_review.

Probably one would need to revise the handling of GCDs of polynomials in general, but this is for another ticket, I guess.

Why is this done in a header, not in `./configure` ?

using `--enable-flint-devel` in configure doesn't help, by the way.

Let's take care of e_antic on a follow-up ticket.


---

Comment by @kliem created at 2020-06-06 18:27:05

I don't like this. It breaks `normaliz`. Yes, it is only an `optional` package, but that is basically downgrading it to `experimental`. Isn't it?

Or is the fix already pretty much done? The order of things makes sense (first upgrade flint and then fix optional packages it breaks) but I would like that the fix is available (and ideally is even merged in the same beta).


---

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2020-06-06 18:31:43

Of course we must fix it before the next release, but not everything can be done within one beta. We need to do LOTS of package upgrades!


---

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2020-06-06 18:34:46

In particular, a big Normaliz update is coming. Not sure if Winfried is already testing with the new FLINT release?


---

Comment by Winfried created at 2020-06-07 08:58:03

I had not noticed that Flint 2.6.0 is available. Therefore it is not installed with Normaliz 3.8.5 that was just released (not a big release). 

As soon as possible, I will test Flint 2.6.0. I need the backport to the 0 series of e-antic.

Indeed, broken again with DESTDIR, in https://github.com/wbhart/flint2/blob/v2.6.0/Makefile.in#L216:

```
	$(AT)if [ "$(OS)" = "Darwin" ] && [ "$(FLINT_SHARED)" -eq "1" ]; then \

Appears to work for me. Also the normaliz doesn't make any problems (at least all doctests in geometry pass and it did install cleanly with flint 2.6.0).

The patch is not required for e-antic. Without the patch the `fmpq_poly_add_fmpq` from flint is broken. But this function does not seem to be used anywhere in sage.

Comment by Winfried created at 2020-06-08 11:31:43

I have tried to build Normaliz natively with Flint 2.6.0. 

Then compiling e-antic fails with 



```
configure: WARNING: arb.h: present but cannot be compiled
configure: WARNING: arb.h:     check for missing prerequisite headers?
configure: WARNING: arb.h: see the Autoconf documentation
configure: WARNING: arb.h:     section "Present But Cannot Be Compiled"

```



O.K. So we try to rebuild arb 2.17. This fails with



```

Comment by dimpase created at 2020-06-08 12:03:21

Unpatched arb 2.16 and 2.17 do not work with flint 2.6.0. You need a patch - e.g. for arb 2.16 it is included in the branch of this ticket (IIRC the same patch will work for 2.17 too).

Comment by Winfried created at 2020-06-09 07:24:50

I will update Normaliz to Flint 2.6.0 as soon as arb and e-antic are in complete harmony with it. I hope for some increase in performance, but that is not so urgent.

Looking good now. I'd be ready to set it to positive review, but we need another reviewer for the changes that I added.


---

Comment by Winfried created at 2020-06-14 15:28:13

I have updated Normaliz on GitHub/master to Flint 2.6.0/arb 2.18.0/e-antic 0.1.7. This required no change in the Normaliz code, as expected. The only visible change in the tests is that the floating point approximations to number field elements have one more decimal digit.

The version number is now 3.8.6. Note that the source file structure has been changed considerably: every cpp file is now comiled in a translation unit of its own. Moreover, some small files have been merged and some cpp files have been inserted into h files.

If it should be helpful,  I can make a new Normaliz release the next days.

Comment by Winfried created at 2020-06-14 16:12:29

It seems that PyNormaliz has a problem with the new version. Therefore please wait until further notice.

The problem was in Normaliz itself. Should be fixed now. The PyNormaliz tests go through. PyNormaliz 2.11 has not been changed.

The `arb` ticket has been closed but this branch doesn't upgrade `arb`. It includes a patch for the current shipped `arb` but it doesn't revbump the `arb` package which means that the patch is only applied to fresh builds and not to incremental upgrades.

At the minimum I think this branch needs to include a revbump for `arb`, but since we obsoleted the `arb` ticket I would favor upgrade `arb` in this ticket too.

As this ticket updates a dependency of arb, it will rebuild arb regardless of the presense of revbump (or at least it should - it it doesn't it's a bug in the build system)

These summary statistics don't mean much because they do not distinguish sporadic errors (from the unreliable computing platform) from actual failures - one needs to look at the details.
If you want, I can walk you through on how to read these runs...

I'm working on getting multi-variate polynomials running with the new flint code.

I expect to be opening a dependent ticket for that soon.

In the meantime, every time I type 'make build' on this branch (without any local mods), it rebuilds sage.rings.polynomial.pbori.  Every time.  Takes about 60 seconds, too.

Any ideas why it keeps rebuilding pbori?

Sounds like there is something wrong with the Cython dependencies. You could investigate this by setting a breakpoint or printing data in `sage_setup.command.sage_build_cython.sage_build_cython.create_extension`

an experiment with flint 2.6.3, which is a package on Gentoo, built with cmake, reveals that this breaks its recognition, as `HAVE_GC` may be undefined (it is just not there if  GC is not "found" in some sense.

To build the current version of this branch (commit 01271cb) on Ubuntu I had to `apt install libgmp-dev`.

I don't think that's listed as a build requirement.

I attached a log file.

There's really not much to see - a bunch of failed downloads because flint 2.6.3 isn't in any of the Sage mirrors yet, then a compile failure because it couldn't find "gmp.h", which I resolved with `apt install libgmp-dev`.

`./configure` has `--enable-download-from-upstream-url` option, which use would allow an automatic download from the url  in `checksums.ini`of the package.

> then a compile failure because it couldn't find "gmp.h", which I resolved with `apt install libgmp-dev`.

look at what `./configure` tries to tell at the end of its run - there should be a list of system packages to install to make one's life easier.
On Debian like 90% of Sage's (non-python) libs, as well as Python itself, etc etc, are unvendored, see #27330

I had to re-run configure after installing libgmp-dev, and I didn't keep the old log, but I don't remember any glaring complaints.  Furthermore, I found this in the (new) config.log:

   configure:37965: result: gmp-6.1.2:                                   using system package; SPKG will not be installed

I infer from this that a SPKG is available and should have been used by the original build.

I don't know enough about Sage packaging to know how a SPKG gmp should be used by flint.

How did you start the build?

I only can see this happening on an unconfigured tree if one does not start by
running `./configure`, but rather by doing something like `./sage -p flint` (which indeed does not check dependencies)

After `git checkout`, I ran `./bootstrap`, then `./configure`, then `MAKE="make -j8" make`.
