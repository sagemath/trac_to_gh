The change to `src/sage/groups/matrix_gps/named_group.py` looks really dubious. It seems that a `super()` call would be a better idea here, something like

```
return super(UniqueRepresentation, self).__eq__(other)
```

There is some other similar code in the patch, I haven't looked in detail.

In any case, you can replace `....__richcmp__(..., op_EQ)` by `....__eq__(...)`. This is because ``@`richcmp_method` automatically also defines the standard rich comparison methods like `__eq__`.

There are two such cases, for named matrix groups and for named permutation groups. I think that we want them to compare equal to some group that has the same generators, but is not itself given a name. This forces to bypass the `UniqueRepresentation` comparison. I do not understand what your proposal with super is doing, sorry.

Well, the current code assumes that `UniqueRepresentation` has no `__richcmp__` method, so the `__richcmp__` method is found in some matrix group base class. But this is going to break if we ever implement `__richcmp__` either in `UniqueRepresentation` or `NamedMatrixGroup_generic`.

With `super(UniqueRepresentation, self)`, we explicitly say that we want the `__richcmp__` method from whatever class comes after `UniqueRepresentation` in the Method Resolution Order (MRO). So the behaviour is the same, but it's a lot more robust.

hmm, this seems to break some things..

I believe this breaks some of the current behavior:

```
return super(UniqueRepresentation, self).__eq__(other)
```

As I understand the old version, it compares generator by generator. You are almost correct about the comparison, but not quite. The old code compares equal two groups `G == Gp` if `Gp` has the same generators but is created as a subgroup of a different group than `G` (including if either one is not considered as a subgroup). So your change removes this equality, in addition to groups with different names but same generators, as being `True` as it just falls back on the `UniqueRepresentation` behavior (well, technically `WithEqualityById`).

However, because it only overrides `__eq__`, you can also get equal and not-equal groups:

```
sage: G = groups.matrix.GL(4,2)
sage: H = MatrixGroup(G.gens())
sage: G == H
True
sage: G != H
True
```

So I think the best way forward is to change `UniqueRepresentation` to `CachedRepresentation` and implement `__richcmp__`.

ok, here is another try.

I had to re-introduce `op_EQ` at some point to avoid infinite loops.

I changed `UniqueRepresentation` to `CachedRepresentation` for named matrix groups.

green bot, please review


---

Comment by tscrim created at 2017-07-09 06:12:28

Since it is a cached representation, I think the first thing that should be checked is `if self is other:` similar to the permutation group case. Also, could you add a test for the behavior in comment:11?

done, and launched my patchbot

I think that bot is morally green (with a strange report though)
