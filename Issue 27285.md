There remains an issue about normalisation, plus more doctests needed.

As the Sage-8.8 release milestone is pending, we should delete the sage-8.8 milestone for tickets that are not actively being worked on or that still require significant work to move forward.  If you feel that this ticket should be included in the next Sage release at the soonest please set its milestone to the next release milestone (sage-8.9).

Changing keywords from "" to "knot".

I don't understand the line


```
M = M // 2
```


in your code. If I uncomment it I'm getting the correct result.


BTW: Wouldn't it by useful, to introduce a second option to obtain the _Conway polynomial_ via the _Homfly polynomial_ for cross check purpose?



```
sage: B = BraidGroup(3)
sage: L41 = Link(B([1, -2, 1, -2]))
sage: h41 = L41.homfly_polynomial(normalization='az'); h41
L^2 - M^2 - 1 + L^-2
sage: c41 = L41.conway_polynomial(); c41
1 - t^2
sage: t, = c41.variables()
sage:  hc41 = h41(1,t); hc41
1 - t^2
sage: hc41 == c41
True
```



Since now we have Puiseux series available the _Homfly polynomial_ can also easily be used for cross checks with _Alexander_ and _Jones polynomials_:



```
sage: a41 = L41.alexander_polynomial(); a41
-t^-1 + 3 - t
sage: j41 = L41.jones_polynomial(); j41
t^2 - t - 1/t + 1/t^2 + 1

sage: P.<t> = PuiseuxSeriesRing(ZZ)
sage: ha41 = h41(1,t^(-1/2) -t^(1/2)); ha41
-t^-1 + 3 - t
sage: ha41.laurent_series().laurent_polynomial() == a41
True

sage: hj41 = h41(~t,t^(-1/2) -t^(1/2)); hj41
t^-2 - t^-1 + 1 - t + t^2
sage: hjp41 = hj41.laurent_series().laurent_polynomial()
sage: L = hjp41.parent()
sage: hjp41 == L(j41)
True

```


As soon as we have Puiseux polynomials available, an option to use it would be a nice enhancement here, too.

Frederic, I still think that the line of code I posted in my previous comment (from June 2020) should be removed. After removing it the cross check against all of KnotInfo's Conway polynomials passes.


```
sage: B = BraidGroup(3)
....: L = Link(B([1, -2, 1, -2]))
....: L.conway_polynomial()
-t^2 + 1
sage: R = _.parent()
sage: kicps = {k:R(k[k.items.conway_polynomial].replace('z', 't')) for k in KnotInfo}
sage: len(kicps)
7166
sage: %time all(k.link().conway_polynomial() == kicps[k] for k in KnotInfo)
CPU times: user 6min 25s, sys: 270 ms, total: 6min 26s
Wall time: 6min 26s
True
```


I push a corresponding fix and in addition add some doctests. If you agree with it you may give it a positive review.

oh, by the way please fix the syntax in the second meth role here:

Sebastian Oehms (October 2020, add get_knotinfo() and meth:isisotopic
