# Issue 28450: Demote scons to experimental

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28687

Original creator: jhpalmieri

Original creation time: 2019-11-01 20:47:25

`scons` fails to build because of Python 3 incompatibilities. It is possible that upgrading scons would fix this, but someone else would have to take responsibility for that.

Note: we are using version 1.2.0, dating from December 2018. The current version is 3.1.1, from August 2019.
