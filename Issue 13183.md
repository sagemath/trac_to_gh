Plotting currently fails when plotting a symbolic function that evaluates to complex values:


```
sage: def evalf_func(self,x,parent):
....:     return parent(I*x)
....: 
sage: f = function('f', evalf_func=evalf_func)
sage: plot(abs(f(x)),0,5)
verbose 0 (2392: plot.py, generate_plot_points) WARNING: When plotting, failed to evaluate function at 199 points.
verbose 0 (2392: plot.py, generate_plot_points) Last error message: 'unable to simplify to float approximation'
```


This is because `plot` uses `fast_float`, and `fast_float` cannot deal with the intermediate complex value.

The attached patch first changes these things:

* it adds a method to `class Function` that allows one to see what output range is to be expected for a given input range. By default, it will return a complex field.
* it overrides this method for builtin functions, which return floats for float input
* this is then used by `fast_float` to throw an exception if complex values are to be expected

This exception will cause `plot` to fall back to `fast_callable` instead of `fast_float`. However, `fast_callable` needs patching too:

* it now uses the `_evalf_` method when available instead of just `__call__`. Otherwise, `plot` will try to coerce the result to `float`, which also cannot deal with complex intermediate values.

An alternative to this step would be to fix `float` coercion, which I haven't looked into.

Hello,

I don't understand your example. You define `f` to take complex values, how do you want to plot it as a real function? Could you be more explicit about the problem you intend to solve ? What kind of picture you would like to obtain with such input?

Note that for that purpose, there is yet `complex_plot`

```
{{{
sage: def evalf_func(self,x,parent=None):

sage: complex_plot(f, (-1,1), (-1,1)).show()

Thanks for looking at this!

Replying to [comment:9 vdelecroix]:
> I don't understand your example. You define `f` to take complex values, how do you want to plot it as a real function?

My example was

```
sage: plot(abs(f(x)),0,5)
```

Note the `abs`.

Now the point is that

```
sage: abs(f(3))
abs(f(3))
sage: float(abs(f(3)))
3.0
```

both work, but plotting doesn't:

```
plot(abs(f(x)),x,0,10)
verbose 0 (2430: plot.py, generate_plot_points) WARNING: When plotting, failed to evaluate function at 199 points.
verbose 0 (2430: plot.py, generate_plot_points) Last error message: 'unable to simplify to float approximation'
```

The reason is that there is an optimization to use `fast_callable` for calculating plot points. The current implementation assumes that all intermediate values are floats, whereas we can still make a real plot when the argument to abs is complex. This patch should fix that.

Is this any clearer? It would be great if you could test/review the patch!

I also think this is a significant issue; you can't even plot functions like `abs(log(x))` properly. tkluck, it would be great if you could look at my patch and if you think it's a better solution review it.

Hmm, these doctests look strange to me anyway.

```
parent!=None
```

should be 

```
parent is not None
```

I think.  The failures are actually probably features, not bugs, since `f` and `g` are symbolic functions, which are now not automatically evaluated, if that makes sense...

If you agree that this is proper behavior, then we might as well change them.  Also, the plot one is definitely useful.
