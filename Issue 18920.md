Replying to [comment:4 ncohen]:
> tickets must be peer reviewed.

Interesting. Is it really that _tickets_ must be peer-reviewed or is it sufficient that _commits_ are peer-reviewed? Because Vincent really did write that commit (as part of a different ticket, which got stuck), so I'm reviewing it.

Besides, what does it even mean for a _ticket_ to be peer-reviewed? Really, we are reviewing contributions to Sage, which means _commits_.

Vincent, do you agree with authoring this commit? In that case, I can give positive_review.

I looked at the ticket, saw you push a commit, set the ticket to `needs_review`, set it yourself to `positive_review`.
