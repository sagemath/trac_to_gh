This will allow us to enable cythonize the sage library out of place in the future (see https://github.com/cython/cython/pull/202). This will make it much easier to clean up sage and much nicer greping through the sage library source.

Mercurial supports renaming files: no need to delete `sage/libs/eclsig.c` and create `sage/libs/eclsig.h`, you can do

```
hg mv sage/libs/eclsig.c sage/libs/eclsig.h
```

Apart from the Mercurial issue, this patch looks good.
