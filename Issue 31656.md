CC:  @slel

I was browsing https://github.com/sagemath/sage/actions and noticed a lot of

```
sage -t --random-seed=0 src/sage/misc/sageinspect.py
    Timed out
```

in many logs of **Run SAGE_ROOT/tox.ini**

I prepared a solution for that in «u/gh-sheerluck/sageinspect_timed_out» branch

before:

```
sage -t --long --random-seed=0 src/sage/misc/sageinspect.py
    [340 tests, 158.98 s]
```

after:

```
sage -t --long --random-seed=0 src/sage/misc/sageinspect.py
    [340 tests, 34.82 s]
```


Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31893
