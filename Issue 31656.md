# Issue 31656: fix for "sageinspect.py: Timed out"

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31893

Original creator: @sheerluck

Original creation time: 2021-06-01 13:50:22

CC:  slelievre

I was browsing https://github.com/sagemath/sage/actions and noticed a lot of

```
sage -t --random-seed=0 src/sage/misc/sageinspect.py
    Timed out
```

in many logs of **Run SAGE_ROOT/tox.ini**

I prepared a solution for that in «u/gh-sheerluck/sageinspect_timed_out» branch

before:

```
sage -t --long --random-seed=0 src/sage/misc/sageinspect.py
    [340 tests, 158.98 s]
```

after:

```
sage -t --long --random-seed=0 src/sage/misc/sageinspect.py
    [340 tests, 34.82 s]
```

seriously, guys, every time you run https://github.com/username/sage/actions/ without this branch merged in `develop`, one little kitten dies somewhere :-(
Please merge this branch in `develop` as soon as it is possible.
