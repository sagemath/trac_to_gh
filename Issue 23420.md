# Issue 23420: Improve Expression member function documentation

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/23657

Original creator: rws

This 1. moves the current `expression.pyx` document head to `relation.pyx` and 2. adds a structured index to `expression.pyx` member functions.

I really do not like (manual) tables of methods (which are not functions in the strict sense, i.e., you should use `:meth:` instead of `:func:`). However, I am willing to set a positive review if you use the automated table as done for `graph.py`.

Great work in graph.py. I might sort the methods in a different ticket. Having an index at all is of immediate importance.

However, we would depend on #23670 because `expression.pyx` will give the error described there.
