Test timeout frequently and not reproducably on the buildbot. It would be so much nicer if one would be able to see where the process was stuck...

```
+        This method is only called if there is something wrong with the
+        worker. Under normal circumstances, the worker is supported to
+        exit by himself after finishing.
```

"supported"? Do you mean "supposed"?

Feel free to set this to positive review if the tests pass (and if you are happy with the fix proposed by fbissey.)

Speaking of typos:

```
+        worker. Under normal circumstances, the worker is supposed to
+        exit by himself after finishing.
```

Now, I am French, and I make this mistake often, to ascribe neutral gender to male gender.  `himself` -> `itself`

Apart from that I don't really have any objection in principle to this ticket, I'd love to have backtrace on those hanging process. Whether it will be useful is another question that cannot be answered without trying.
