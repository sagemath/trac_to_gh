I can read this and check if I understand the documentation.

Patch seems good. Only few spaces missing, like `def __init__(self,value)` should be `def __init__(self, value)`.

No positive review yet, as I am compiling this with old and slow computer.

Maybe, but note that this ticket isn't called "fix every small mistake in the `sage_object.pyx` documentation".

`:=)` Don't worry, they are not obstacle to review. I just noticed them on the lines you have touched. And I like to nitpick sometimes.
