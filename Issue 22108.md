This follows in from #22343 which is a dependency.  We implement Billeray's algorithm for finding the set of reducible primes for an elliptic curve without CM over a number field.  This is based on an implementation by Ciaran Schembri for a masters' project at Warwick.

I started putting Cremona's code for Billerey's algorithm into appropriate places in Sage.  I cleaned it up a bit and addes some documentations.  

Things left to do or fix:
* add documentation
* only works if the curve has integral discriminant
* incorporate into isogeny finding for EC's over number fields
* more examples, especially over larger fields
* timings against other methods
* probably more . . .

I have rearranged the code quite a bit.  The technical parts of Billerey I though were better kept separate and not as methods of the elliptic curve class itself, so I put them in gal_reps_number_field.py.  (Alternatives were a new file, or on isogeny_class.py.)   In isogeny_class.py I also refactored the code to produce a finite set of primes, separating out the cm case, and allowing the user a choice of 3 algorithms, Billerey, Larson or 'heuristic', the latter being non-rigorous, just testing all primes up a to a given bound to see if they passthe necessary local conditions.  This is never the default and the docstring makes it clear that the output is not guaranteed complete.

This leaves a much simplified method reducible_primes() in the elliptic curves class itself, while the isogeny class code uses the new function to find the reducible primes, with Billerey the default algorithm.

I could put in more examples if desired.  I have not done systematic timing tests, but note that until the work done on another ticket Larson's method could not handle fields of degree 5 and up at all.

While writing this I realised that I have not yet provided the possibility for E.isogeny_class() to use a non-default algorithm, and will add that, but I'll leave the ticket at "needs review" so that patchbots get working on it.
