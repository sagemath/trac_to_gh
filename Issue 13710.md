Not at all, it is just that we did not customize the win32 makefile correctly before.
Whence the need to install zlib and zlib-devel (or Cygwin equivalents, not sure of the name now) because our own zlib was lacking shared objects.

If you really want it can be related in the sense that in the end the problem is that shared objects are not installed (even though in the autotools case they are not even built).

we should switch from ash to dash, at least that's what Cygwin people were saying [already in 2009](http://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2009-07/msg00367.html).

Next time state the obvious problem at once instead of linking to a not so obvious for anyone log...
Especially when it seems that all objects are rebuilt there and the problematic libz.a is repackaged correctly.

And I don't usually look into the src folder, too bad this one comes from a test build and is not vanilla.
