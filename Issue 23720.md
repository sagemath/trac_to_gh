# Issue 23720: gmpy2 causes doctest failures

The current version of `gmpy2` has issues, in particular doctest failures like

```

Changing priority from major to blocker.

Changing component from packages: experimental to packages: optional.

Why is gmpy2 involved here!?

Is this independent of whether gmp or mpir is used?

What do you mean with "this"?

I mean the doctest failure, is your install using gmp or mpir. Or is this something that does not matter?

I'm using mpir, but the failure is caused by gmpy2. So I still don't really understand your question.

Luckily, this is also fixed in gmpy2 version 2.X

Well gmpy2 is a python interface that can use both mpir or gmp as back end. And we already know that `2<sup>(2</sup>63-2)` causes different errors depending on wether one uses gmp or mpir. I dont know much about the inner workings of gmpy2 so maybe my question does not make sense to you because you know more about the inner workings of gmpy2 then I do, but with my current knowledge I wouldn't be surprised if memory management works differently depending whether mpir or gmp is used as backend, and this therefore deserves testing both with mpir and gmp.

I don't see the point of testing this on GMP (though it would not hurt). `gmpy2` was "wrongly" setting a custom allocation scheme in GMP (or MPIR). Moreover the fix proposed is the way it is in  development versions of gmpy2.

Note that without this ticked, but with gmp and gmpy2 there is just the expected gmp error:

I do get the error reported in this ticket with just mpir. So there is difference between using gmp and mpir. I am now testing everything with this ticket applied

Ok this ticket passes the `2<sup>(2</sup>63-2)` test both with mpir and gmp for my on OS X 0.12.4 . I do not understand the exact change and its ramification, but it seems that Vincent does so I leave it up to him to give positive review.

GMP/MPIR allows for custom memory allocation function (in replacement for `malloc`/`realloc`/`free`). `gmpy2` was changing them by default which is not a reasonable policy.

Changing status from needs_review to positive_review.
