I'm using mpir, but the failure is caused by gmpy2. So I still don't really understand your question.

I don't see the point of testing this on GMP (though it would not hurt). `gmpy2` was "wrongly" setting a custom allocation scheme in GMP (or MPIR). Moreover the fix proposed is the way it is in  development versions of gmpy2.
