# Issue 19935: Matroid Basis Axiom Test has a bug

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/20172

Original creator: Stefan

Original creation time: 2016-03-07 00:12:14

CC:  yomcat

Keywords: matroids, BasisExchangeMatroid, BasisMatroid, axiom, is_valid

As reported by Charles Wang on the sage-matroid list:


```
sage: M=Matroid(groundset='1234',bases=['12','13','23','34'])
sage: M.is_valid()  # Should return False
True
```


The fix is easy and forthcoming.

To be honest, I didn't test this against the current version of Sage, but it's a very basic fix so it shouldn't give any trouble.
