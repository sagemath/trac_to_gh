Keywords: legal, IANAL

I'm working on #3905 and want to use `integer.pyx` as a showcase on how to use AUTHORs tags and copyright. Unfortunately, the file only has William as copyright holder although many people touched it a lot. 

So I did something *nasty* and added a bunch of copyright notices. I don't know if I'm legally allowed to do that so I looking for consent/dissent by the the authors. 

Feel free to shoot this one down, I'll have to look for a different example then.

Ha ha that's fine with me. (I love it: "IANAL" is a keyword. Now I can successfully search for IANAL on trac.)

Patch looks good to me. I see nothing problematic about you adding copyright statements in this case.

Cheers,

Michael
