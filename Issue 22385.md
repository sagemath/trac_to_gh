Keywords: lattice polytope

The `.is_lattice_polytope()` method states that it requires the polyhedron object to be compact, but it still returns `True` if it is not.


```

sage: P1 = Polyhedron(vertices = [[1, 0], [0, 1]], rays = [[1, 1]])
sage: P1.is_compact()
False
sage: P1.is_lattice_polytope??
Signature: P1.is_lattice_polytope()
Source:   
    def is_lattice_polytope(self):
        r"""
        Return whether the polyhedron is a lattice polytope.

        OUTPUT:

        ``True`` if the polyhedron is compact and has only integral
        vertices, ``False`` otherwise.

        EXAMPLES::

            sage: polytopes.cross_polytope(3).is_lattice_polytope()
            True
            sage: polytopes.regular_polygon(5).is_lattice_polytope()
            False
        """
        return True
File:      ~SAGE_ROOT/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/geometry/polyhedron/base_ZZ.py
Type:      instancemethod
sage: P1.is_lattice_polytope()
True

```
