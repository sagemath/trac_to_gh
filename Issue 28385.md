```
With a Python 3 patchbot, there are doctest failures in three files:

```
sage -t --long src/sage/repl/attach.py  # 4 doctests failed
sage -t --long src/sage/libs/singular/function.pyx  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t --long src/sage/numerical/backends/generic_backend.pyx  # 2 doctests failed
```

This can be replicated by hand. Install the patchbot, run Python, and do

```
>>> from sage_patchbot.patchbot import Patchbot
>>> P = Patchbot({'sage_root': '/path/to/SAGE_ROOT'})
>>> P.config['parallelism'] = 4 # to speed things up
>>> P.test_a_ticket(0)
```

The patchbot will do a lot of stuff and then print the command being executed:

```
/path/to/SAGE_ROOT/sage -tp 10  --all --long
```

Then it runs `os.system('/path/to/SAGE_ROOT/sage -tp 10  --all --long')`, and the errors should arise. Confusingly, this does not lead to errors:

```
>>> import os
>>> os.system('/path/to/SAGE_ROOT/sage -tp 10  --all --long')
```

So something particular to the patchbot is leading to these errors.

The problem is that it would allow some doctests to pass that should fail. From the file:

```python
    sage: with open(src, 'w') as f:
    ....:     _ = f.write('# first line\n')
    ....:     _ = f.write('# second line\n')
    ....:     _ = f.write('raise ValueError("third")   # this should appear in the source snippet\n')
    ....:     _ = f.write('# fourth line\n')
```

Then this passes, as it should:

```python
    sage: load_attach_mode(attach_debug=True)
    sage: attach(src)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
        exec(code, globals)
      File ".../foobar.sage....py", line ..., in <module>
        raise ValueError("third")   # this should appear in the source snippet
    ValueError: third
```

But this also passes: note that the second to last line is different:

```python
    sage: load_attach_mode(attach_debug=True)
    sage: attach(src)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
        exec(code, globals)
      File ".../foobar.sage....py", line ..., in <module>
        raise ValueError("third")   # this is gibberish
    ValueError: third
```

I guess this is what is meant by "We need to manually print the traceback because ..."

Here is the report from my Ubuntu 18.04 computer:

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage -t --long --warn-long 53.0 src/sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_rational_flint.pyx  # 1 doctest failed

In other words, all the doctests discussed here are passed! The only failure is that discussed in #28334.

So +1 for the positive review.
