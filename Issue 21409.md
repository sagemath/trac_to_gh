CC:  @tscrim @fchapoton

This patch will slightly modify instructions for docstrings.

I would like to have even more pre-specified formats for some classes of functions. For example should Boolean-valued `is_something()` function be "Return `True` if...", "Test whether" or something else? Also we have an arbitrary decision to use `algorithm=` instead of `implementation=`, `method=` etc.

But as a first part, what you think about these changes?


Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/21646

Sohehow "Use `algorithm` if there are several algorithms or backend programs to select from." sounds odd to me. It left me wondering what else I could use or what is the meaning of this sentence. Compare to "- - describes the function or method's effect as a command - - *not* as a description - -"

by

  This is a list of some keyword arguments that many functions and methods take.
  For consistency, you should use the keywords from the list below with the meaning
