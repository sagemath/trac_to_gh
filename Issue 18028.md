# Issue 18028: Axioms for semigroups: L,R,J,H-trivial, aperiodic

Issue created by migration from Trac.

This ticket defines the usual Green axioms for semigroups, and provides stubs for the corresponding categories. This is a first step toward #18001.

I am setting it to needs review to get the patchbot to pick it up.

It would be good for the new files to have the standard copyright template: http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#headings-of-sage-library-code-files.

Patchbot report has also come in and states errors in

```
sage -t --long src/sage/categories/semigroups.py  # 5 doctests failed
```

along with docbuilding issues.

Thanks Travis for having a look. The patchbot should go green now, and I have finished cleaning things up.

Up for review for real now!

Some comments:

- Do we want these to be axioms since these properties for subcategories do not make as much sense (e.g., for groups, L-trivial = R-trivial = J-trivial = category consisting only of the trivial group, correct?)
- Typo "preoder".
- Do we want to spend some time trying to beautiful axiom printing (i.e., "J-trivial" instead of "jtrivial")?
- I would like to see the defining properties to the category level documentation, not only in the subcategory methods.

Hi Travis,

Thanks for the review.

Replying to [comment:13 tscrim]:

We want them to be axioms to interact nicely with each other: there
will be many interesting combinations between the Finite / X-trivial /
Unital axioms (and more will come, like Regular, ...). In fact
implementing those was one of my original motivation for implementing
axioms in Sage :-)

Indeed `Groups().XTrivial()` is, well, trivial, so that's boring.  But
this is only polluting the namespace of the Groups() category, not the
groups themselves, so that's a minimal annoyance.

Thanks for catching. Fixed!

This would be cute, indeed. I'll have a quick look if it's trivial to
do. Otherwise, we can leave it for later; that will be easy to change
anyway.

I agree that documentation at the category level would be highly
desirable. But I don't want to duplicate manually the documentation.
That's a general problem that requires a general solution by having a
nice automatically generated default documentation for categories with
axioms. See also the related:

   http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/16363

In the mean time the subcategory methods are the most appropriate
location for the doc, since this makes it accessible for all
subcategories by `XXX.Jtrivial?`

I think we should also add that an inverse H-trivial monoids implies J-trivial.

Considering there is exactly 1 X-trivial group (up to isomorphism), there won't be any additional pollution from `Parent/ElementMethods` either. So I agree, minimal annoyance.

Let me know.

Yes, but only when we will have the "inverse" axiom in the sense of
local inverses in semigroups. Our current Inverse axiom is about
having a global inverse (it's indeed annoying that we have this naming
conflict, but there is nothing much we can do about it).

Of course an R-trivial monoid with a global inverse is J/H trivial,
but that's not super interesting :-)

I made a quick fix, so that JTrivial is displayed as j trivial and not
jtrivial; it only slightly better, but requires no special casing and
makes for a more consistent implementation of uncamelcasing.

It's been discussed several times that axioms like AdditiveAssociative
would be better displayed as `additive-associative`, to raise
ambiguities in expressions such as:


```
    Category of associative additive commutative additive associative additive unital distributive magmas and additive magmas
```


This would make the `j trivial` into `j-trivial` as a by-product
without any special casing. However this is a relatively invasive
change (it will require updating a bunch of doctests"), so I vote for
doing this in a separate ticket.

Do you agree that this is good enough for now?

I'm somewhat leaning towards having the implication for the global inverse, but considering the category of X-trivial groups is, well, trivial, I don't feel strongly about this. So if you don't feel like doing it, then you can set this to a positive review.

Yes, I believe this should be on a separate ticket.
