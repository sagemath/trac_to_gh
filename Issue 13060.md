As an example, I attached the result of using this patch on the following plot::

```
sage: L = RootSystem(['A',2,1]).weight_space()
sage: P = L.plot(size=[[-1..1],[-1..1]],alcovewalks=[[0,2,0,1,2,1,2,0,2,1]]); P
```


I had to tweak a tiny bit the latex, for tikz crashes with an arithmetic error when given the option `color={rgb: red,0;green,0;blue,0`}. Otherwise, I guess that using

```
sage: view(P)
```

would have worked.

Anyway, it would be best to use named colors instead, and not to repeat opacity=1 all the time.

Some minor comments:
1. Is it necessary or useful to add `_latex` method to `GraphicsPrimitive` and override that from the `arc`, `line`, etc? I think this method is used only in `Graphics` so that only one `\begin{tikzpicture}` is used, right? Since the classes `Arc`, `Line`, etc are not exposed hence it doesn't seem to matter whether the method is named `latex` or `_latex`. I am not sure which is the correct approach here, so I am just curious.
2. Should it return an empty string from `Graphics` if there are no objects in it? Again, I am just wondering because I am not sure which behavior is more appropriate. Currently, this patch results in the following behavior:

```
sage: G = Graphics()
sage: latex(G)
\begin{tikzpicture}

\end{tikzpicture}
sage: len(G)
0
```

3. The check for `None` should be done by using `is` or `is not`, according to [this PEP](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#programming-recommendations).

> Some minor comments:
> 1. Is it necessary or useful to add `_latex` method to `GraphicsPrimitive` and override that from the `arc`, `line`, etc? I think this method is used only in `Graphics` so that only one `\begin{tikzpicture}` is used, right? Since the classes `Arc`, `Line`, etc are not exposed hence it doesn't seem to matter whether the method is named `latex` or `_latex`.

In any cases, all the methods should be named _latex_, for consistency with SageObject. At this point, I don't see a use for having _latex_ in GraphicsPrimitive, since there is already a default (admittedly pretty useless in this case) implementation in SageObject. 

> 2. Should it return an empty string from `Graphics` if there are no objects in it? Again, I am just wondering because I am not sure which behavior is more appropriate. Currently, this patch results in the following behavior:
> {{{
> sage: G = Graphics()

That's sounds reasonable; let's not introduce a special case.

A plot of a function produces unexciting results:

```
sage: p = plot(sin(x), (0, 2*pi))
sage: latex(p)
\begin{tikzpicture}
\draw [color={rgb: red,0;green,0;blue,1}, line width=1pt, opacity=1] (0.0,0.0) -- (0.0199042066897,0.0199028924494);

In some ways, this is already handled by matplotlib's PGF export, but I think it would still be good to have a native (and more compact) version of the graphics objects (in particular, so it doesn't go through `show`, need to create a temp file, and come with all of the "standard" plot things).
