Keywords: elliptic curves

eclib has changed a lot since the last upgrade, mostly in parts which do not affect Sage much, but there are exceptions, for example the handling of bounds in saturation for elliptic curves over Q (see #10840).

I plan to make a new version of the spkg and will post a link here when done.

What's `ldconfig` supposed to do?  The line in SPKG.txt

```
Add a line in spkg-install to run ldconfig

isn't very clear :-)

Anyway, the build fails on my Gentoo Linux system because I don't have `ldconfig`:

I hope we can leave this as it is (or similar).  If not, I would just remove the shared libraries (which were an addition to eclib not put in by me).

If we can leave the ldconfig in, please return this to Positive Review!

I found a race condition in the eclib installer:
at various places you have things like

```
chmod og+r *
```


The problem is that some temporary file might be caught by the "*" which is removed by the time `chmod` tries to access it.  It is hard to reproduce, but the following happened once:

I believe the easiest solution is to prepend a "-" to the make command which means: ignore errors.  Concretely: replace

```
chmod og+r *
```

by

```
-chmod og+r *
```

(of course, similarly for other "chmod" invocations)

Unrelated: why do you have "/bin/rm" at several places as opposed to simply "rm"?

Oh misery, I'm a mathematician and should never have got into software distribution.  All these Makefiles originated as my own files in my own directories on my own computers building my programs for me.

I can fix the chmod thing.  I can see no reason now why they are there anyway.

I think I put /bin/rm because I have rm aliassed to "rm -i" in my .bashrc.  Sometimes I put in rm -f instead, and sometimes /bin/rm -f.  So I am not consistent.  Tough.

As for the ld stuff: you call it "my" src/makefile but this file was created by some people who first made an spkg out of my code, so don't blame me.  I don't understand shared libraries and am not going to learn now, so if people want eclib to work on other systems they will have to supply their own fix.

As I found out to my cost once, that sort of thing can be very dangerous, as ".." (i.e. the parent directory) is included in '*' too. So:


```
$ chown -R drkirkby *
```


made all files owned by me, including those of the parent directory, and all its sub-directories.

Note Solaris can be built using both the GNU and Sun linkers, so one needs to ensure the right flags for each. The assumption in Sage is that the first linker in the path is the one used for the compiler. That's not really very good, but that's how it is. 

The GNU linker options -shared and -soname, would need to be changed if the Sun linker is used on Solaris to -G and -h respectively, but left unchanged if the GNU linker was used. 

The '--as-needed' option can possibly be omitted on Solaris. I'd be a bit careful of using it on any platform actually. This page

http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/qa/asneeded.xml

suggests it can be problematic and is not supported on gentoo.

It still fails on OpenSolaris because there is no `ldconfig`, with the same error message as [http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/10993#comment:17](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/10993#comment:17)

Possible solution: replace the relevant code by

```sh
if [ "$UNAME" = "Darwin" ]; then
    cp -p lib/*.dylib "$SAGE_LOCAL"/lib/
elif [ "$UNAME" = "CYGWIN" ]; then
    cp -p lib/*.dll "$SAGE_LOCAL"/lib/
else
    cp -p lib/*.so "$SAGE_LOCAL"/lib/
fi
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo >&2 "Error copying over libraries"
    exit 1
fi

# On some systems (on Linux at least), we need to run ldconfig.
# This will fail gracefully if there is no ldconfig.
PATH="$PATH:/sbin" ldconfig -n "$SAGE_LOCAL/lib" 2>/dev/null
```

In each of the 4 subdirectories it's important to make the lib target since these 4 libs (+headers) are what's needed to use the package.  Each lib target has sub-targets headers & objs where the latter are the compiled .o files which are made into a lib file using ar and ranlib.

Secondly, in each of the four there are some targets which make runnable programs, either test programs (target test) or useful ones (target progs).  Some of the latter look a bit like test files and vice versa;  the test ones are also built with "make check" which runs them on prepared inputs and compares the output, just as with a doctest in Sage.  Some of these progs are installed by Sage into SAGE_ROOT/local/bin, and the most important of those is mwrank (under qrank).

Bear in mind that these makefiles are not just for Sage, but for other users of eclib  (including and possible restricted entirely to: me!) so any changes to what is compiled and where things are put will create difficulties for me (but not serious ones, if there is a good reason).

Looking at the new Makefile you started, you'll also need to handle make progs, check, lib at least.  And if you tell me what to do I can help...

The delay in getting to make the spkg was reconfiguring my build so that the includes now end up in a separate eclib subdirectory of the installdir/include (e.g. $SAGE_LOCAL/include), but that is done now in the 2012-04-14 version.

Is the problem with that div function the only one on gcc-4.7?

I think I grabbed that (according to the directory name in the tarball); seems like you created a symbolic link from the -04-04 to the -04-14.

It's rather a Solaris bug than related to GCC 4.7.0.  (I successfully built the "current" spkg in Sage with GCC 4.7.0, although not on Solaris.)  See also my recent comments at #12751.

But it's in general a bad idea to put functions with such commonly used names into the global namespace; don't know whether eclib (meanwhile) uses namespaces at all...

I didn't, but the Warwick webserver has this way of error-correcting URLs.

I also ran into this with my restrict() functions which had to be renamed.  No, eclib does not yet have its own namespaces.  One day....  I already see that in the code I call my div() functions mostly as ::div() because of some similar clash, but have not before had a complaint about the function declaration.

I just did a quick build on Ubuntu 10.04.4 LTS x86_64 with (my own build of) GCC 4.7.0, without setting any `CFLAGS` or `CXXFLAGS`; `make check` apparently passed without errors.

Only noticed that eclib's `configure` apparently doesn't yet check whether the NTL and PARI installations passed to it really work; I used the ones of some Sage 5.0.beta10 installation I also compiled with GCC 4.7.0, but accidentally passed `--with-*=$SAGE_ROOT` instead of `--with-*=$SAGE_ROOT/local` in the first place.  While `configure` succeeded with that, the compilation of course later failed, because `<NTL/foo>` couldn't be included.

There should IMHO also be a `--with-gmp=...` option.

Yeah, C++ didn't have namespaces (but neither templates) in 1990... ;-)

There's a new eclib-2012-04-15.tar.gz which fixes the problem with the div() function, could you check that?

Took ages to build (on a Sun Blade 2500), but `make check` passed without errors.

FWIW, also builds with Clang 3.0 on Ubuntu 12.04 x86_64, but some tests fail (`tperiods` from the qcurves checks; further checks aren't performed after that, apparently, so maybe more could fail).

I found that one of our machines has clang and so I am compiling on that now.  I just prepended CXX=clang to the ./configure line, as I am not sure if more than that is needed.  I will report back.

OK, fixed: the code now compiles without warning with clang and test pass (for me).  There were a few minor compiler warnings, which I dealt with (though only one was a real error and that was in some code no longer used).  

For the record, here's the issue which caused the check to fail.   In the file tests/tperiods.cc, I read in the coefficients of an elliptic curve and construct the curve from it with a flag set to say to construct the associated minimal model; and that was not being done.  The old line

```
Curvedata CD(Curvedata(ai,v),1);
```

first constructs an instance of type Curvedata from a vector of rationals called ai with an additional reference parameter v which is undefined on input but holds a bigint scaling factor on output, then passes that Curvedata object back to a different Curvedata constructor whose first argument is a Curvedata object and second argument is an int flag to indicate whether or not to convert to a minimal model.  I have replaced this with two lines

```
Curvedata CDin(ai,v); // v holds scaling factor
Curvedata CD(CDin,1); // 1 for minimise
```

where the temporary object CDin which I never use is now declared explicitly.  Something was clearly going wrong with the temporary object, but who knows what.  I would say that this is a compiler error, but do not wish to get into any arguments about it -- the code now works with clang and gcc, while before it only worked with clang.

There's a new tarball at http://homepages.warwick.ac.uk/staff/J.E.Cremona/ftp/progs/eclib-2012-04-16.tar.gz

One final comment:  building with clang took an *extremely* long time compared with gcc, so I really hope that I never have to use it again!

Excellent.

Re speed: mine's running 

```
jec@selmer%clang --version
clang version 3.0 (trunk 129441)
Target: x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
Thread model: posix
```

and "time make -j10" gives

```
real	7m20.983s
user	55m43.301s
sys	0m39.662s

so something's not right...

Regarding a line like

```
echo "Now running eclib's test suite..." 
```

in spkg-check: note that the sage-spkg script already does the following, if spkg-check exists:

```
echo "Running the test suite for $PKG_NAME..."
```

So I think the `echo` command in spkg-check is redundant.

Well, maybe `sage-spkg`'s message is redundant... ;-)

I do that in every `spkg-check`, since `sage-spkg`'s message isn't always appropriate (since it runs `spkg-check`, not the test suite; `spkg-check` might do other things before), one might miss it, and it uses the filename of the spkg rather than the package's name.

My p0 also builds and passes the test suite on Solaris (SPARC, 32-bit, GCC 4.7.0).

Unfortunately beta13 (i.e., some spkgs) currently doesn't build on Solaris, so I couldn't run other tests yet.

To day I saw that for conductor 235200, there are 754 classes, so the ocdes go up to 3 letters (cremona_letter_code(754)='bda'.  So your remarks have already been useful!

PS This ticket is still tagged "need review"

Thanks for the reminder.  I don't recall right now whether I've even looked at your latest spkg.

But I meanwhile managed to build all of Sage 5.0.beta13 (with a couple of replacement spkgs and some manual intervention) on Solaris SPARC (skynet machine mark2), unfortunately yet only with one of your new spkgs, some p0.

Don't know whether it's related -- with that I reproducibly get a timeout in `sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_rational_field.py`; the last output (hopefully, since we still don't flush buffers) I see is [**EDITED**]:

```
...
1109 tests in 128 items.
1109 passed and 0 failed.
Test passed.
```


Need to investigate further, which will take some time...

----

**EDIT:** [Just reran the test while writing.]

Ooops, while Sage reports the process timed out and got killed, with `--verbose` I notice that it's still running (and actually performing more tests, finally succeeding -- see above), so I probably should have increased `SAGE_TIMEOUT_LONG` (to more than half an hour) ... :-)

So will only have to check your latest spkg...

I am tempted to leave it as it is for now, apart from Volker's warning.  I was certainly confusing the NULL return value with the empty string, and it had that nasty effect on the stringstream.  It's amazing that there does not seem to be a proper C++ string version of getenv().  Please don't wait for yet another upstream code fix before making a decision on this.  This function is not used by code currently wrapped in Sage...

Like this:

```c++
#include <cstdlib>
#include <iostream>

using std::getenv;

const char *getenv(const char *var_name, const char *default_value)
{
  const char *val = getenv(var_name);

  return val ? val : default_value;
}

int main(void)
{
  std::cout << "getenv(\"FOO\"): " << getenv("FOO") << std::endl;
  std::cout.clear();
  std::cout << std::endl;
  std::cout << "getenv(\"FOO\", \"bar\"): " << getenv("FOO", "bar") << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```

which yields

```
getenv("FOO"): 
getenv("FOO", "bar"): bar
```

Don't know whether that's a regression, but some tests take **really** long (as mentioned), at least on mark2:

Yet another upstream update?

Note that the link *target* in the description is still `.../eclib-20120421.spkg`, perhaps just some copy-paste accident (cf. [http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/10993?action=diff&version=149](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/10993?action=diff&version=149)).

It's a tiny bug fix in something not used in Sage, and as the target has moved to 5.1 I thought I would change the spkg.  Sorry if that causes more work in testing.

I'm finding it very hard to edit trac tickets since the version was changed, especially on a netbook while travelling.  I only see one place on the ticket where the spkg name is given, in the Description, and I changed that.  If there's another one somewhere (why would there be two?) and you can change it to match, please do.

No, but in the description we currently again have a link target different to its name:

```
'''spkg''':  [http://homepages.warwick.ac.uk/staff/J.E.Cremona/ftp/progs/eclib-20120421.spkg //homepages.warwick.ac.uk/staff/J.E.Cremona/ftp/progs/eclib-20120428.spkg]
```


It's sufficient to just use

```
'''spkg''':  [http://homepages.warwick.ac.uk/staff/J.E.Cremona/ftp/progs/eclib-20120428.spkg]

```

(where the brackets are optional if you don't specify an [alternate] name for the link, but I always use them).

Made that change, although technically the new spkg would need new review.
