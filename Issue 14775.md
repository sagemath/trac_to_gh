# Issue 14775: unexpected (questionmark style) output string of RIF

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/15012

Keywords: RIF, output string, questionmark

The (first) output of

```
sage: RIF(1.332,1.334), RIF(1.332,1.334).str(style='brackets')
(1.34?, '[1.3320000000000000 .. 1.3340000000000001]')
```

is not intuitive, since the digits `1.33` are correct. Therefore one would expect `1.33?` as resulting output string.
