Unless somebody thinks they can make "sage -upgrade" bulletproof, which I have no clue how to do, this gets deprecated.

AFAIK this was shot down several times, shall we close the ticket or do you want another vote on [sage-devel]?

The proposal on sage-devel was to remove `-upgrade`, but I think renaming it would be fine.

Cheers,

William opened #3944 with a patch, so I am closing this as a dupe.

Cheers,
