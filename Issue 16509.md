CC:  @dkrenn

The doctests output should look like the Sage commandline output, which it currently does not quite. Differences include:
* Dictionaries will be sorted by key, makes output more reproducable
* Sets are printed as `{1,2}` instead of `set([1,2])`
* Empty set is `set()` instead of `set([])`
* Types are `<Foo at 0x...>` instead of `<Foo object at 0x...>`

Other changes:
* Normal tracebacks can now be distinguished from tracebacks in `__repr__` (IPython extension):

```
sage: f(*args)
<repr(<sage.interfaces.gap.GapElement at 0x...>) failed: ValueError: The session in which this object was defined is no longer running.>
```
* Plots now print themselves in doctest mode:

```
sage: A.plot()
Graphics object consisting of 1 graphics primitive
```
