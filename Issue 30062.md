Changing keywords from "" to "jupyter threejs jsmol mathjax".

I can confirm this fix allows the notebook to run and both Three.js and JSMol function as expected. If it is ready for review, then it can be set to positive so it gets into the next beta.

Thanks. Somewhat related, can anyone help with the plot3d issue at:

Joshua, can you replicate the plot3d error in the Ask Sage question? Happening on a version of Ubuntu.

Heya! 20.04 bricked my Ubuntu machine, and I've been too stubborn to rollback as of yet. I tried the example in the AskSage question with my WSL installation of Ubuntu 18.04 and was unable to reproduce the reported problem. The plot showed up just fine. I'll try again once I either get my upgrade woes sorted out or (very) begrudgingly rollback.

I confirm that the example in the AskSage question works fine with Sage 9.1 on my Ubuntu 18.04 machine (same version of Ubuntu than the OP).
