Heya! 20.04 bricked my Ubuntu machine, and I've been too stubborn to rollback as of yet. I tried the example in the AskSage question with my WSL installation of Ubuntu 18.04 and was unable to reproduce the reported problem. The plot showed up just fine.

I confirm that the example in the AskSage question works fine with Sage 9.1 on my Ubuntu 18.04 machine (same version of Ubuntu than the OP).
