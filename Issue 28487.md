Here's a first version.

I wanted to have a `linear_transformation` method for a while... That was a good timing to add it.

What happens when the linear transformation moves the polyhedron outside of the fields the backend can handle? Can you add such a doctest?

Can you just initialize the new parent like this?

```
new_parent = par.base_extend(linear_transf.base_ring(), ambient_dim=new_dim)
```


This should automatically keep the backend if possible, but change it, if not possible.

This does not work, when the matrix consists of floats.

Please apply the change I suggested, which fixes this, and add a doctest with floats.

However, this still does not work with sqrt5 for example, even with backend `field` or `normaliz`.

This is because coercion of parents does not work in this case. I'm trying to figure out what's going on there.

I added #28770 as a dependency, because it would be nice to have doctest with a square root of something or so.

If you think this is unnecessary, feel free to remove it again.

Three more things.

- `is_zero` catches too many matrices. A 2-by-2 zero-matrix should not change ambient dimension, if it acts on a Polyhedron in ambient dim 2. if it acts on a polyhedron of dimension 3 it should throw an error.
- (Optional) Are you happy with the error message thrown, if the dimension of the matrix does not fit? If not you should take care of it.
- Currently, you implemented left action (and I don't know, what a right action should be). You should probably check, whether `self_on_left` is `False`.

I applied those small changes as suggested above.

The matrix acts on the right now, by action of the transpose on the left.
