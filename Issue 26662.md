On OS X Mojave, it is possible to have Xcode installed but to have no directory `/usr/include`. The configure check from #26286 finds zlib somewhere, but the Python build does not: Python reports that it has built without zlib support. Without zlib, pip will not build.

I believe that on this machine, I once ran

```

as advised at #26713, and then I believe a subsequent Xcode upgrade removed `/usr/include`. That upgrade apparently left the files necessary to build Sage.

Proper, i.e. only known to Xcode? I don't know. It's not really a zlib problem, it's an Apple bug, if you ask me. They really, really want you to do everything via Xcode.

Once again, on the machine with this problem, do you have `/usr/include` at all? 

I guess it might be that you need to run that `open /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/Packages/macOS_SDK_headers_for_macOS_10.14.pkg` etc. after you upgraded XCode, as the latter could have left everything in a slightly out of sync state.

If this does not help then we need to find out whether it's that you actually have non-functioning zlib installation before you start building python, or it's a python issue

Thanks. In the log there not even an attempt to build Python's zlib extension, probably meaning that a pre-build check is failing (such as something that checks for headers somewhere...)

By the way, could you check whether zlib extension is built for the Python3?
(and if not, how is it failing)
There is a sea of difference between Python2 and 3 in regard of how configuration is done, so it could be a bug of sorts in Python2.

Another question is where that zlib.h is found by spkg-configure.m4
Could you search for zlib.h files on the system (I guess, in XCode tree in /Develop*)?

In Python2/3 configure.ac, one sees that OSX is treated in a special way:

```
dnl Check if system zlib has *Copy() functions
dnl
dnl On MacOSX the linker will search for dylibs on the entire linker path
dnl before searching for static libraries. setup.py adds -Wl,-search_paths_firs
t
dnl to revert to a more traditional unix behaviour and make it possible to
dnl override the system libz with a local static library of libz. Temporarily
dnl add that flag to our CFLAGS as well to ensure that we check the version
dnl of libz that will be used by setup.py.
dnl The -L/usr/local/lib is needed as wel to get the same compilation
dnl environment as setup.py (and leaving it out can cause configure to use the
dnl wrong version of the library)

        _CUR_CFLAGS="${CFLAGS}"
        _CUR_LDFLAGS="${LDFLAGS}"
        CFLAGS="${CFLAGS} -Wl,-search_paths_first"
        LDFLAGS="${LDFLAGS} -Wl,-search_paths_first -L/usr/local/lib"

AC_CHECK_LIB(z, inflateCopy, AC_DEFINE(HAVE_ZLIB_COPY, 1, [Define if the zlib library has inflateCopy]))

Darwin/*)
        CFLAGS="${_CUR_CFLAGS}"
        LDFLAGS="${_CUR_LDFLAGS}"
        ;;
esac
```

One may wonder whether it could pick up wrong old zlib from /usr/local, say, and then fail on testing it being recent enough).

By right, Python should have a configure option to tell it where zlib is, and do not fool around the system looking for one...

Same for Python 3. As you note in your later comment, `zlib` is treated differently on OS X in `configure.ac` and in `Modules/Setup.dist`.

> Another question is where that zlib.h is found by spkg-configure.m4
> Could you search for zlib.h files on the system (I guess, in XCode tree in /Develop*)?

`$ locate zlib.h` prints the following (along with some matches for files containing "zlib.h", like "nazlib.htf", which I have omitted):

```
/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/AppleTVOS.platform/Developer/SDKs/AppleTVOS.sdk/usr/include/zlib.h

```

Perhaps the relevant ones are

```

I did actually know that second part, which is what led me to ask the question in the first place.

If I run `make distclean; make`, I see this in the Python 2 and 3 log files:

```
Testing importing of various modules...
ctypes module imported OK
math module imported OK
hashlib module imported OK
crypt module imported OK
readline module imported OK

```

The "real[TAB][time]" string is typically only printed when the installation is complete. Oh, I see, it's running `spkg-build` and `spkg-install` and reporting timings for each. That's a little confusing. The first one should say "Successfully ran spkg-build" at the end.

Assuming that mixing system's zlib and Sage's zlib is not a good idea, note that
zlib is a dependence (1st or 2nd order) of several other libraries: boost, cbc, glpk, libpng, brial,
freetype, giac, libgd, matplotlib, python2/3, etc

Its pretty much on every unix-like OS, including OSX. The only thing that OSX lacks here is a sane way to distribute software that is not an self-contained opaque application bundle.

And the sane way is to let the users explicitly pick their dependencies, not rummage around and see if we can randomly find something that isn't part of the OS/distribution. It should just be a matter of `./configure CPPFLAGS=-I/the/location/include LDFLAGS=-L/the/location/lib`

Not really; on FreeBSD most, but not all, libraries are in /usr/local, rather than in /usr

On Solaris things are just all over the place...

Sanity on OSX is lacking in more than one place, just see above on many incarnations of zlib.h...

But /usr/local may be a part of OS/distribution, e.g. Homebrew puts everything in 
/usr/local, and FreeBSD has most things in /usr/local...
Similarly, /sw used to be the place where Fink put all its stuff, IIRC.

And as you say, Conda can be put in /bar/foo, so it would suffice to replace /usr by
/bar/foo, not fiddle around with every spkg separately.

Even better, Conda comes with pkg-config, so one could use appropriate autoconf macros, right?

If it isn't found in any of the default prefixes it searches (`/usr/local`, `/usr`, `/opt/local`, `/sw`) then it shouldn't detect any zlib at all.

In the meantime, you can configure Sage like


```
./configure --without-zlib

This is clearly counter-intuitive but the `--without-zlib` flag comes from the `AX_CHECK_ZLIB` macro and will just prevent it from trying to detect zlib, so it will fail to detect and thus install the spkg.  You can give that a try.

Also, I've been meaning to update the `SAGE_SPKG_CONFIGURE` to add configure flags for explicitly forcing SPGKs/disabling checks for the system lib.  But for this case `--without-zlib` ought already to work.

Strangely, no sign of header check...
Also, that `-L/usr/local/lib` is worrying - don't you by any chance have a copy of zlib in `/usr/local` ?

And no attempt to build `zlib` extension in `logs/pkg/python2-2.7.15.p0.log`.

A python bug? It's really hard to see why `zlib` extension wasn't even tried to be built...

No. Not in `/usr/local/include`, and `find /usr/local -name zlib.h -print` returns nothing. There's only this:

OK, so the only role of `./configure` is to write out the approprite `#define` in the generated header.

From reading setup.py it looks as if a reasonable attempt is made on OSX to locate the headers in OSX SDK directories, but I cannot guess which of the several checks in this code fragment fails.

I don't see how not installing the headers is normal, unless you want to abandon classic command-line workflow and do everything via Xcode.

No change.

I also tried

```

```

which changed the return value of `macosx_sdk_root` to that directory, but the zlib extension still wasn't bult.

Knowing Apple that's probably what they want you to do.  Why, after all, would you be using Apple products except if you want to use software written specifically for Apple with Apple's toolchain :)

You can also set `PYTHONCONFIGURE=...` to add additional configure flags for configuring Python, if indeed that helps at all.

what we see in comment 11 above is that `spkg-configure.m4` already succeeds without even trying to look into any of /usr, /usr/local, etc.

"just" removing `build/pkgs/zlib/spkg-configure.m4` means that **anything** that depends upon `zlib` must be built as well. 

Besides, I have a draft patch for Python(s) ready (this is diff to CPython master, thus probably needs a rebase for other Pythons)

there are executables that certainly may use whatever zlib, so apologies for not being
precise here, but still this leaves

libpng, iconv, libpng, glpk, cbc, and all of its dependent libraries, such as freetype, libgd, etc.

And it rules out using system-wide Python (this is far from being ready, but in principle not much should prevent one to build Sage in a virtual environment of a system-provided Python).

With this patch, Python 2 and 3 both fail to build for me (this is on the machine with no `/usr/include` and for which I've been having to build Sage's zlib; to test this, I didn't build Sage's zlib).

The problem seems to be the new line `import subprocess` in `setup.py`. I actually don't know how `setup.py` is supposed to work: how much of Python's functionality can you expect to be working when it is called?

OK, I must say I misunderstood the issue a bit - that's why on Python bug tracker I posted a patch which simply triggers building of `_posixsubprocess` and a bunch of other modules (some of them needed for just testing).

Ned Deily wrote on the BPO issue that he's working on a potential fix but didn't really explain his approach; absent that I can look into it.  I think something like Dima's patch would work, but it should be run at `./configure` time.  Just need to check for the `xcrun` program and use it if so; if it doesn't exist (e.g. on older OSX) it's fine, because there the issue is not relevant anyways.

Patching Python 3 to do this is easy,
Erik's suggestion on https://bugs.python.org/issue36231 really makes it 
a 1-line addition to Python's `configure.ac` and 2 more lines to `setup.py`,
but backporting this to Python 2 is not straightforward, as it has more brain-dead `setup.py`,
which seems to requires manual adjustments to a bunch of module configurations.

IMO this is kinda weak, albeit harmless for the time being (though the line added to `spkg-configure.m4` should at least have had a comment, but at least we can `git blame` it easily...). I think Python should be patched instead.
