# Issue 31499: ManifoldSubset: New methods declare_equal, equal_subsets, equal_subset_family

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31736

Two subsets are equal if they are subsets of each other.

We add methods `equal_subsets`, `equal_subset_family`; and a method `declare_equal` to make two or more subsets equal.

We modify the method `subset_poset` and `superset_poset` to quotient out by equality.

Shouldn't we have

```diff
    def equal_subset_family(self):
-        return ManifoldSubsetFiniteFamily(self.supersets())
+        return ManifoldSubsetFiniteFamily(self.equal_subsets())
```

Another comment: your name should appear in the `AUTHORS` field of `src/sage/manifolds/subset.py`, and possibly in other files, like `src/sage/manifolds/topological_submanifold.py`; such a field should also be added to `src/sage/manifolds/family.py`.

(I used `git blame -w --date=format:%Y src/sage/manifolds/manifold.py | sort -k2` to determine what copyright years to add.)
