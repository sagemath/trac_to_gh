Ooch. This patch implements a method with a nasty name. With this one can create  hexagonal grids on the torus, and have some acceptable drawing.

It also modifies the embedding of ToroidalGrid2dGraph, as some edges did not appear on the drawing.

Hi Nathann,

I looked at the patch and found the modified layout of `ToroidalGrid2dGraph` better.

For a hexagonal grid graph, can you give some reference with the definition you are using? Your graph is 6-regular while several other definitions are 3-regular. For example, see article 1203.0666v1, section 5,  from arXiv.org, or [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/HexagonalGrid.html](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/HexagonalGrid.html). I am confused ;-)

That's rather true... After trying to find an intermediate solution, I ended up renaming the function. It makes more sense like that `:-)`

I hope that everything is running smoothly on your side ! I am now back from asia and I work in Paris `:-)`

Hello,

I was about to write a small review patch to add:
- a space between i and \in (same for j) since otherwise i and in are glued when asking for the doc of the function. 
- to write ``((i+1)%n_1, (j+1)%n_2`` so add (). 
But then I found a problem in the method as well as for `ToroidalGrid2dGraph`, `Grid2dGraph`, and certainly others: I'm able to call `graphs.Toroidal6RegularGrid2dGraph(-1,2)` without warnings! O_o

For which values of n1 and n2 are these methods defined? So far, I'm able to produce a graph that is not 6-regular.

David.

Oh, right. Well, I added what you asked, in this new function and also in Grid2dGraph `:-)`

That's much better now.

Thanks ! I'm reimplementing something to compute the girth with static_sparse_graph, because of the conversations on sage-devel these days `:-)`

It's good to write a piece of code knowing it will not have to be changed later `:-)`

The documentation doesn't build correctly:

```

and

```

Gloops. LaTeX does not like "%" much, and there was a "::" where it should not be. Sorry about that, I just fixed it !

Are you sure you uploaded the right patch?
