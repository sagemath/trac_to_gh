# Issue 27820: Adding precision in computing the generators of the period lattice of an elliptic curve.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28057

Original creator: menosgeze

Original creation time: 2019-06-25 20:01:43

Keywords: Elliptic Curves, period lattice, generators, basis

For example

```
EllipticCurve('11a').period_lattice().gens()
```

returns the generators but does not allow the parameter "precision." The command `gens()` calls the command `basis()` that allows the user to compute with arbitrary precision. I want to add this parameter to `gens()`.
