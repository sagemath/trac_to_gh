This file is meant specifically for the Sage notebook, so I don't consider it a problem that there are `sagenb` imports (more than one actually).

Given that SageNB is deprecated, maybe a better way forward would be to deprecate this whole file.

can we make this tiny change nevertheless ?

I am going to defer to Jeroen on this.

Is there a good way to just skip all the doctests in a file?    I feel like there was but I don't remember the exact spelling.  Then we could just do that (along with an appropriate module-level deprecation warning).

Jeroen, maybe we can do that tiny change and keep the deprecating for later ?

Jeroen does not seem to be available. Can somebody else please review this very simple ticket ?

Looks good to me. If you also want to make the change (suggested by pyflakes)

```diff
diff --git a/src/sage/interacts/debugger.py b/src/sage/interacts/debugger.py
index dd9bd70691..9a26c993f2 100644
--- a/src/sage/interacts/debugger.py
+++ b/src/sage/interacts/debugger.py
@@ -81,7 +81,6 @@ class Debug(object):
         """
         import inspect
         import sys

         try:
             tb = sys.last_traceback
             #we strip off the 5 outermost frames, since those relate only to
```

I would be happy with that, too.

I will leave it up to you to decide whether to make that change. In any case, you can set it to positive review on my behalf. (I don't want to do that now, in case you want to make further changes, because Volker doesn't like changes made after a ticket has a positive review.)

ok, thx a lot. I am not doing anything more, just setting to positive.
