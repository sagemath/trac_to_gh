Testing for surjectivity of a free module homorphism is probably just fine for vector spaces, but seems to be broken for modules.


```
sage: V = ZZ^2
sage: m = matrix(ZZ, [[1,2],[0,2]])
sage: phi = V.hom(m, V)
sage: phi.lift(vector(ZZ, [0, 1]))
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)

/sage/dev/devel/sage-main/<ipython console> in <module>()

/sage/dev/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sage/modules/free_module_morphism.pyc in lift(self, x)
    375             t = self.domain().linear_combination_of_basis(C)
    376         except TypeError:
--> 377             raise ValueError, "element is not in the image"
    378         assert self(t) == x
    379         return t

ValueError: element is not in the image
sage: phi.is_surjective()
True
```


Patch coming up.

Passes all long tests for me on 4.7.1.alpha3 and patchbot is green-lighting it at the moment.

Attachment

Version 2 patch tests if a morphism is surjective with the `.is_submodule()` method.  Slower, I guess, but a greater chance of being correct.  An example from mmarco has been added to illustrate the non-unique echelon basis for the image.  The necessity of these changes is detailed on #11579 (and perhaps, see #11553).

Looks good to me.
