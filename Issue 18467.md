# Issue 18467: Fix two sphinx cross references in geometry/cone.py

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/18704

Original creator: mjo

Original creation time: 2015-06-15 00:58:19

Running `sage -docbuild` with `--warn-links` reports two errors on geometry/cone.py. One is a link to `frozenset` that Sphinx doesn't know how to resolve (I guess we can't link to python builtins), and the other is an outdated reference to a `ray_basis` method.
