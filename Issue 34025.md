While working on this ticket, I experienced `./configure --enable-editable`, which is the default now. I needed to search the whole `src/doc` directory and subdirectories, but then since the `src` tree was cluttered with lots of build artifacts, the search would take much more time. Hence I did `./configure --disable-editable` to go back to the "normal" state of the `src` tree. From my experience, I doubt if the new default is really good for developers...

It may need some time to get used to it coming from longstanding Sage practice, but editable builds are the standard way to develop in the Python world

Would it be possible to only display the toc in the pdf? In my opinion, they just duplicate information that is already displayed in the right column.

They are duplicated but often a short version of the full toc on the right column, and hence they are still useful. So I think it is not worth the effort to try to find a way to show them only in the pdf.
