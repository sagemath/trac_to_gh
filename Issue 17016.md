# Issue 17016: Bug in explain_construction for Brouwer-van Rees

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/17253

Easy:

That can be solved by removing the build function `brouwer_van_rees_with_one_truncated_column` that we do not need anymore, and calling `wilson_construction` directly. The branch also fixes a bug in `wilson_construction` when `OA=None`, i.e. only the non-Brouwer case was handled.
