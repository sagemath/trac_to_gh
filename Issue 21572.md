To be honest, I don't really understand the purpose of your latest change. You are achieving exactly the same thing with more complicated code...

I'm not strictly against your change, I just don't see which problem it solves.

My code can be cleanly split between `PariInstance` and the (supposed) `SagePariInstance` subclass. Yours couldn't.
