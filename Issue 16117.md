Just a first draftish commit which let at least access the functionality from sage (but you have to create the `Hom` (without printing it), and then ask the `Hom` for the morphism (passing the `algorithm` keyword).

Still needs:
* documentation,
* tests,
* a better interface,
* do we want an `algorithm` and/or an `implementation` keyword?
* thoughts about what should be done in `Hom` to compute all embeddings (currently uses `factor` IIRC).

It might also be nice to fix #16162 (and enhance it to properly refactor factorization over ffs).
