A better fix for upstream is probably to set `threadsizemax` to a good multiple of `parisize`.

Is there a public repo of giac where to follow the code? A place to report bugs or make PR? I still have to apply a few more patches for the voidlinux pkg, it would be nice if those could be upstreamed (please ping me for more info).

That would have been nice if it was that simple. I'll have a go on linux with internal fltk to see what happens later this afternoon.

This is a bit silly but easy to overlook when not paying attention. 

`@`parisse your trick to ship fltk internally has a serious shortcomings. From `configure.ac`

```
	dnl force FLTK static compilation if FLTK not present
	AC_CHECK_HEADERS(FL/Fl.H,[],[tar xfj fltk-1.3.8-source.tar.bz2 ; cd fltk-1.3.8 && ./configure --disable-shared && make && cd .. && CXXFLAGS="$CXXFLAGS -I../fltk-1.3.8" && LDFLAGS="$LDFLAGS -L../fltk-1.3.8/lib"] ) 
	dnl X11, check for opengl, fltk
	AC_CHECK_LIB(X11,main)
	AC_CHECK_LIB(Xinerama, main)
	AC_CHECK_LIB(fontconfig, main)
	AC_CHECK_LIB(Xft, main)
	AC_CHECK_LIB(Xext, main)
	AC_CHECK_LIB(Xrender, main)
	AC_CHECK_LIB(fltk_gl, main)
	AC_CHECK_LIB(fltk, main)
	if test "$HAVE_LIBFLTK" = "1"; then
	   AC_DEFINE([HAVE_LIBFLVW],1, [Now defined if fltk is available])
	fi
	AC_CHECK_LIB(z,main)
	AC_CHECK_HEADERS(png.h, AC_CHECK_LIB(png,main))
	AC_CHECK_LIB(jpeg, main)
	AC_CHECK_LIB(fltk_images, main)
	FLTK_LIBS="$LIBS $X_LIBS"
	AC_SUBST(FLTK_LIBS)
```

At the end of the day I found that `config.h` was listing `HAVE_LIBFLTK` as undefined, which in turn means that inclusion of fltk headers in `Xcas1.cc`, where we see the failure is not happening because there is still a guard `ifdef HAVE_LIBFLTK` - which should go if fltk is mandatory (and it really is).

But let's figure why it happens. So, inspection of `config.log`

```
configure:21818: checking for main in -lfltk
configure:21840: g++ -std=c++14 -o conftest -g -O2 -I../fltk-1.3.8   -L../fltk-1.3.8/lib conftest.cpp -lfltk  -lXrender -lXext -lXft -lfontconfig -lXinerama -lX11 -lGL -lcurl -lglpk -lao -ldl -lpng16 -lm -lecm -lmpfi -lmpfr -lgmp  >&5
/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/12/../../../../x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/bin/ld: cannot find -lfltk
```

Well, `-I../fltk-1.3.8` and `-L../fltk-1.3.8/lib` will work very well once you go to the subfolder `src`, but it doesn't from the top level source directory from which `configure` is run. In effect, you probably want to replace `../fltk-1.3.8` by something that does `${srcdir}/fltk-1.3.8` which would be an absolute path that would be right in both cases.

On Linux, needs `libX11` at a minimum as far as I can tell.

GUI stuff is for xcas. libgiac itself is free from gui stuff. If we could do a lib only build and not use pexpect at all we could achieve that goal.

1.9.0.29 is out - it doesn't fix the flaws that I pointed out in configure.ac to find a vendored fltk. But in this version `--disable-fltk` works. So, we can have a headless install without any dependencies on X11.

Why not make the default with GUI enabled and use the environment variable for server installs?

I'm making changes to configure.ac, thanks for pointing to the broken path to fltk-1.3.8 while configure runs, I'm modifying to
AC_CHECK_HEADERS(FL/Fl.H,[],[tar xfj fltk-1.3.8-source.tar.bz2 ; cd fltk-1.3.8 && ./configure --disable-shared && make && cd .. && CXXFLAGS="$CXXFLAGS -I../fltk-1.3.8 -I./fltk-1.3.8" && LDFLAGS="$LDFLAGS -L../fltk-1.3.8/lib -L./fltk-1.3.8/lib"] )

Do not forget the extra checks from comment:35 for `Xcursor` and `Xfixes`. If fltk finds them at configure time they will be needed to link xcas as well. Also note that you do not need to change `CXXFLAGS` because you do no test for headers again. Only `LDFLAGS` needs adjusting.

I'm not aware of a use case for the GUI within Sage; maybe you can explain what functionality it would give to Sage users?
