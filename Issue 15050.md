I've made some review tweaks: some mild formatting, some micro-optimizations, adding doctests. If you're happy with my changes, then positive review.

Wow.

Wow.

Thank you *SO* much for reviewing that. And for adding the definition, sorry for having forgotten !

Thaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaanks ! And also for this `product(X,repeat=5)` that I didn't know.

I will bug Dima with #15288 now. Seems almost doable `:-D`
