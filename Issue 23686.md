In #20191 the `cases` function is introduced. This ticket should interface it with SymPy's piecewise (both directions) and test with:

```
        sage: _ = var('y, z')
        sage: (x^y - z).integrate(y)
        -y*z + x^y/log(x)
        sage: (x^y - z).integrate(y, algorithm="sympy")  # see Trac #14694
        -y*z + cases(((log(x) == 0, y), (1, x^y/log(x))))
```
