# Issue 4327: Root systems plots

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/4327

Original creator: nthiery

Original creation time: 2008-10-20 08:40:33

Assignee: mhansen

CC:  sage-combinat alubovsky

Port from MuPAD-Combinat the plotting facilities for (affine) root systems.

This will require in particular the port of:
 - row/column annihilator
 - a,acheck,c coeffs
 - translation factors

I find this ticket is completely integrated inside #4326

I remember that i did this job. So feel free to merge/destroy/erase this ticket. I don't know the current way to dealt with such ticket...

Comment by nthiery created at 2009-07-30 13:45:17

Actually, there is still room for improvement to the current plots. So let's keep this open. I'll just update the description.

Hello,

Here is a patch which realize the  porting of what was done in MuPAD... I tried to do my best but this patch really need a strong English language review. For anybody interssinting in reviewing, commenting, or anything... here are some pointers :

Hellooooooooooo !!

Nicolas M. ThiÃ©ry : that's the ticket that should have been set to `needs_review` ages ago and never was. It would be nice to have this into Sage, if only to be able to print beautifu Sage-combinat posters with fancy pictures inside.

So, the test pass, but the startup module complains about the new module that is imported on startup. I'll try with a lazy import tomorrow. I leave it as needs review, as the review of all the rest can continue!

Hmm, I just had a look, but am not sure how to handle this. Lazy importing works just fine for the code, but then:

```
    sage: sage.combinat.root_system.plot?
```


fails, whereas I think we want to support this natural way to access
this tutorial.

The seemingly natural solution would be to lazy import the full module. However:

```
sage: sage.misc.lazy_import.lazy_import('sage.combinat.root_system', 'plot')
sage: type(plot)
sage.misc.lazy_import.LazyImport
sage: plot
/opt/sage/sage : ligne 135 :  6989 Erreur de segmentation  (core dumped) "$SAGE_ROOT/spkg/bin/sage" "$@"
Process SAGE exited abnormally with code 139
```


I'll post on Sage-devel on this topic. In the mean time the rest of
the review can continue!

If we can't get a good solution shortly, I am at this point in favor
of sticking to a non lazy import in order to allow for accessing the
tutorial as above, even if the price is to import (yet another) new
module in Sage.

Cheers,
                         Nicolas

The updated patch implements wireframe drawing for 3D alcoves, and specifying a color as None to disable certain pieces. It also fixes a couple typos here and there in the doc.

Hey Nicolas<sup>2</sup>,

Does this conflict with #2023, and if so, which patch do you want to have the dependency?

Thanks,

Travis


---

Comment by nthiery created at 2013-04-13 20:31:53

It could possibly conflict. Both patches should get soon into Sage, and I already had a good look at #2023. So once we have had that little discussion with Dan, we should just get it in. And then #4327 which is already based on it anyway.

Uploaded a new version (double checked by Travis) fixing one of the long doctest failure on 5.10. It was caused by the new matplotlib that emits a warning for arrows of length 0:

```
sage: arrow([1,1],[1,1])

```


The other failure is due to some doctests being ignored. See:

Hi Travis,

The updated patch fixes the doc so that later on doctests won't be
ignored, and update the number of ignored doctests in the mean time.

All long tests passed.

Ah shoot, sorry about that. The docstrings for this method was missing its starting 'r', and which caused a `\a` in it to be misinterpreted as a non UTF-8 character.

The newly updated patch fixes this. While I was at it, it fixes half a dozen other missing 'r' in other methods introduced by this patch.

Since the change is trivial, I am allowing myself to put it back to positive review.

For the record, here is the diff between the two patches:

Assuming that you checked that the PDF documentation does build, that's okay.

The `plot_expose()` function should be a method of plot objects. Its definitely useful outside of root lattices. See #14640
