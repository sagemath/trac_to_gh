Some autoconf macro is trying to use `rm -f` when it should be using `rm -rf`, leading to these harmless error messages:

```
checking for ZMQ version >= 4.2.5... yes
rm: conftest.dir: is a directory
rm: conftest_venv: is a directory
configure: will use system package and not install SPKG zeromq
```
