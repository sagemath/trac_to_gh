Instead of `uint32_t n, uint32_t ** p_vertices`, could you try to pass `short_digraph g, ` instead. 
Then, inside the method, you can add shortcuts to `n` and `p_vertices`.

It's not a trivial change, since you will certainly have to report it inside `distances_all_pairs.pyx`, but in the end it will be a better code, and consistent with other methods. Thanks.

Sure I will write a comment in distances_all_pairs.pyx code that `Simple_BFS` is shifted.

I have my final exam on 26th April after that I will be more active. \\
Update you as soon as possible.

I have updated the `Simple_BFS`, now it will take `short_digraph g` instead of `n` and `p_vertices` but it's leading to change the definitions of \\ 
1. `c_eccentricity_bounding` \\ 
2. `diameter_lower_bound_2sweep` \\
3. `diameter_iFUB` \\ 

In which `c_eccentricity_bounding` create `short_digraph g` of `G` so no problem with it but `diameter_lower_bound_2sweep` and `diameter_iFUB` functions take input in terms of `n` and `p_vertices`.

So what do you suggest me to do? go ahead and do necessary changes(may `diameter_lower_bound_2sweep` and `diameter_iFUB` will have future dependencies)?

Completed necessary changes and able to generate executable file i.e `sage`.
Comments are updated only in `Simple_BFS` function. \\
`diameter_lower_bound_multi_sweep` defination is also changed.

Let me know anymore changes required and is comment `g (short_digraph) -- The input graph.` is enough? if yes than shall I update same for remaining functions?

More precisely, it makes no sense to *declare* an inline function. You have two choices for using inline

- *define* it in a pxd, so that they are available from other Cython modules with standard cimport
- *define* it in a pyx, in which case it is only internal to the file

Both situations are in use in Sage.
