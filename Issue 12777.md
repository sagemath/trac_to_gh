This patch relates to the ` is_congruence() ` method of arithmetic subgroups of SL2Z (described in terms of permutations, cf. ` sage.modular.arithgroup.arithgroup_perm`). For even subgroups (containing -1), there is a very fast algorithm due to Tim Hsu, but for odd subgroups we were using a much, much slower brute-force algorithm.

My student Thomas Hamilton checked in his MMath thesis that Hsu's algorithm also works for odd subgroups with minor modifications. This patch implements this generalized Hsu algorithm, resulting in a speedup of about three orders of magnitude in all the examples I tried.

I would prefer to keep both implementations (naive one vs checking relations with default to the latter one of course ;-). Then you may add a dedicated test comparing the results in `sage.modular.arithgroup.tests`. Otherwise the new implementation is well documented and everything works.

Is your result available to read ? A dissertation is a legitimate reference, but one may want to read it.

Why did you remove the reference of the article of Alexey G. Gorinov ? I do not claim that it is not a good idea but just that it was not the purpose of the ticket.

Dear Vincent,

Nice to hear from you; sorry it's taken me so long to look at this in turn...

- I didn't remove the reference to Gorinov. I just moved it a little higher in the list so the references were listed in alphabetical order.

- Hamilton's dissertation isn't available publicly anywhere, sadly; Warwick doesn't maintain an archive of MMath dissertations, although it does for MSc and PhD degrees. If you want to check the result, I have a copy I can send to you personally, if you like.

- I'm not quite sure what you're suggesting re keeping both algorithms. At the moment we have one (fast) algorithm for even subgroups only, and another (much slower) algorithm for odd subgroups. It seems silly to distinguish needlessly between even/odd -- would you be happier with a setup where we have both algorithms available for both types of subgroups (with the fast one the default, of course)?

Hi,

Replying to [comment:5 davidloeffler]:
> - I didn't remove the reference to Gorinov. I just moved it a little higher in the list so the references were listed in alphabetical order.

My mistake.
 
> - Hamilton's dissertation isn't available publicly anywhere, sadly; Warwick doesn't maintain an archive of MMath dissertations, although it does for MSc and PhD degrees. If you want to check the result, I have a copy I can send to you personally, if you like.

I would appreciate a copy but this is not the point. If you mention the Math dissertation as a reference for the algorithm it should be available for anyone. What about arXiv ?

> - I'm not quite sure what you're suggesting re keeping both algorithms. At the moment we have one (fast) algorithm for even subgroups only, and another (much slower) algorithm for odd subgroups.

You are right. It would be better to keep the fast algorithm only and to implement the naive test within the `Test` class and check that the answers coincide.

Dear Vincent,

Hamilton gave his permission for the work to be put on the Arxiv, so here's a new patch that references the Arxiv preprint. There is also a test in "tests.py" which compares `is_congruence` against `congruence_closure`, and a slight tweak to the congruence subgroup initialization code that makes the test run a little faster.

Best regards, David

Do you know why `L.order()` returns a Python int and not an Sage Integer? It looks like a bug to me as for example
