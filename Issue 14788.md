# Issue 14788: automatically injected function does not work with desolve

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/15025

Original creator: dkrenn

Original creation time: 2013-08-09 09:49:57

Keywords: desolve function

The following does not work:

```
sage: x = var('x')
sage: f = function('y', x)
sage: desolve(diff(y,x)-y == 0,y)
Traceback (click to the left of this block for traceback)
...
TypeError
```

altough `y` is automatically injected to the gobal namespace.

This is because `y` is of the wrong type:

```
sage: f, type(f)
(y(x), sage.symbolic.expression.Expression)
sage: y, type(y)
(y, sage.symbolic.function_factory.NewSymbolicFunction)                                      
```

It works with `f`:

```
sage: desolve(diff(f,x)-f == 0,f)                                                            
c*e^x
```


This is confusing, especially, since in the docstring of `function` under "Note" you can find

>  The new function is both returned and automatically injected into the global namespace.                                                                                  

Therefore, it is not absurd to assume that this automatically injected variable is the one I want to use, i.e. the one you would get by `y = function('y', x)` (similar to the `var`-command).

(If this is behavior of `function` is (really) on purpose, then at least the error message of `desolve` should be more clearifying and give a hint.)

It seems what gets injected and what gets returned is always an issue. On top level,

```
x = var('x')
```

is redundant: `var('x')` already injects the binding. On the other hand,

```
t = SR.var('t')
```

is not redundant because the methods on `SR` do not have injection side effects.

Looking at the side-effect free methods:

```
sage: from sage.symbolic.function_factory import function as new_function
sage: new_function('g')
g
sage: new_function('g',x)
g(x)
sage: type(new_function('g'))
sage.symbolic.function_factory.NewSymbolicFunction
sage: type(new_function('g',x))
sage.symbolic.expression.Expression
```

you see the design problem: The routine that constructs new symbolic functions creates entirely different objects depending on the arguments given.

A `NewSymbolicFunction` is really a different kind of object: it goes into the "operator" slot of symbolic expressions:

```
sage: (y(x)).operator()
y
sage: (2*x).operator()
<function operator.mul>
```

I understand how the shorthand `new_function('f',x)` was  considered convenient, but it really muddles the interface and it's only one character shorter than the unambiguous `new_function('f')(x)`.

The confusion is compounded by the top-level `function` which does inject the function into the global namespace as well, but both `function('f')` and `function('f',x)` inject the same thing into the global namespace: the NewSymbolicFunction. It has to do that because after typing either, one would expect f(x) to work. But it does raise the expectation that after declaring `function('f',x)`, the system would somehow know that even the bare function `f` has something to do with `x`. It doesn't:

```
sage: var('t')
t
sage: function('f',t)
f(t)
sage: f.number_of_arguments()
0
sage: f.variables()
()
sage: f.default_variable()
x
```

You would get the same results from `function('f')`.

For the problem at hand in this ticket: The problem is that `desolve` really wants a symbolic expression, and that there's no good way of turning a bare function into a symbolic expression: It might try 

```
f( *(f.default_variable() for i in range(f.number_of_arguments())))
```

but you'll quickly see why that's a senseless try.

*IN SHORT:*
 - The interface for `function` leads to wrong expectations by the user
 - The writer of the documentation of `function` was equally confused
 - `desolve` should return a more informative error message when the given argument cannot be turned into a symbolic expression.

A similar problem was just hit on [this ask question](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/25641/typeerror-in-creating-ode-variable/).

The bug is about wrong variable injection (the value injected into the Python variable does not correspond to the returned value, while it is claimed), not about `desolve`:


```
sage: z = function('y', x)
sage: y
y
sage: z
y(x)
sage: y == z
False
sage: type(y)
<class 'sage.symbolic.function_factory.NewSymbolicFunction'>
sage: type(z)
<type 'sage.symbolic.expression.Expression'>
```


Besides fixing this bug, i have nothing against removing automatic variable injection from Sage (which seems to concern only `var()` and `function()`), since it creates a lot of confusion between symbolic and Python variables among new users, for example we can see a lot of `var('n') ; n=2` on ask.sagemath.org, as if `var()` was a kind of variable declaration.

As for the `NewSymbolicFunction` vs `Expression` issue depending on the arguments of `function()`, our options are: 
- create two distinct Python functions for the two situations,
- deprecate the use of `function('y', x)`,
- do not touch anything and provide a better documentation in the `function()` function.

I like the second one since it goes towards better consistency. But, as for removing the ugly `var()` (or even the ugly `RR` that breaks the `RDF`, `RIF`, `RLF` naming scheme and causes meaningless discussions about whether `Infinity` or `NaN` belong to it), i expect not everyone to agree, even if this would help newcomers to grasp Sage's logic.

See also #17447, #14270

FWIW, in Sympy `Function` creates an `UndefinedFunction` which is clear enough, and you get simply

```
In [2]: f = Function('f',x)
...
TypeError: __new__() takes exactly 2 arguments (3 given)
```

I think it's a duplicate of #17701 (ready for review). True?
