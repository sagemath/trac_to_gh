# Issue 25905: docbuild, inventory builder: don't say that it is the html builder

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/26142

Original creator: jhpalmieri

Original creation time: 2018-08-27 18:37:25

Change the messages printed by the inventory building part of the docbuild, so that it says "inventory" instead of "HTML".

The docbuilding process prints message like this:

```
[arithgrou] The HTML pages are in local/share/doc/sage/inventory/en/reference/arithgroup.
```

No HTML pages are being written: mainly a file `objects.inv` is being written. So let's change the message.
