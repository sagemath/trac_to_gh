Keywords: number fields, splitting of primes

For number fields, the method `completely_split_primes` may be incomplete.

## Example

```python
  K.<a> = QuadraticField(17)
  K.completely_split_primes(20)
  [13, 19]
```


However,

```python
  K.<a> = QuadraticField(17)
  K.ideal(2).factor()
  (Fractional ideal (-1/2*a - 3/2)) * (Fractional ideal (-1/2*a + 3/2))
```


The reason is that the factorization of the defining polynomial mod p does 
not always give the correct answer.
It does in all but finitely many cases, the exception being primes that divide
the index of ZZ[a] in the ring of integers of K.

A possible solution would be to use the function 
`K.ideal(p).factor()` and determine the length
of the splitting (at least for those finitely many primes
in case we can easily determine those primes).
