Normally `_sig` returns a triple, where the last value is `epsilon`. However, we need to handle the highest weight element differently, and currently, we have:

```
sage: B = crystals.infinity.Multisegments(2)
sage: b = B.highest_weight_vector()
sage: b._sig(1)
(None, None)
sage: b.epsilon(1) # boom
```
