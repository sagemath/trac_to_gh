Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/23568

Original creator: enadeau

Original creation time: 2017-08-01 20:39:25

CC:  saliola

Keywords: words, suffix tree, factorization

Implement Lempel-Ziv computation for suffix tree and use it to improve the Crochemore factorization for words.

Add alias so the user can use either LZ_composition or crochemor_factorization to get the results.

The code looks good. Here are two organization remarks.

If you really want `LZ_decomposition` as an alias you would better do

```
class A:
    def f(self):
       ...

    g = f
```

That way the documentation appears identical on both methods.

In the documentation you should respect spaces around equality sign: `A = B` and not `A=B`.

Last tiny remark. As you can read in the [developer manual](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#the-docstring-of-a-function-content) the documentation should start with a _one line description_. Then you can have an extended description , INPUT/OUTPUT blocks, etc.
