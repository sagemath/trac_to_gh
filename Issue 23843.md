# Issue 23843: Indexing for symbolic expressions

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: rws

Original creation time: 2017-10-20 14:55:19

Any expression has a number `>=0` of operands. For convenience this ticket implements indexing `ex[i]` as a shortcut for calling `ex.operands[i]`.

I think now it's superfluous because `ex.op()` does the same and it's short enough.
