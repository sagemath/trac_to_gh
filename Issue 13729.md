# Issue 13729: BuiltinFunction.__call__ is unnecessarily slow

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/13933

This was discovered when looking at #12615. Basically, foo(x) eventually calls x.foo() if it exists, but only after doing a lot of symbolic work (resulting in an order of magnitude slowdown for that example).

Any reason why this isn't a good idea?

In principle it is a good idea. I did something similar in attachment:trac_1173-move_call.patch:ticket:1173.

Putting this in the `Function` class is overkill. User defined symbolic functions also inherit from that class. People might be very surprised if all symbolic functions magically tried to call methods of the same name before doing anything else. `BuiltinFunction` is the right place for this, as that is supposed to be the base class for all functions we define in the Sage library.

I agree that extracting the original parent can be delayed. The `alt_name` parameter is also a good idea.

Shall I adapt my patch? or are you going to revise yours?

Looks like our patches crossed mid-air... I just posted a patch that moves the `__call__` up.

Note that using the 3-arg getattr is better than catching an AttributeError both for performance and so we don't mask an error during the call.

Yep, you posted your patch while I was writing this comment.

I rebased your patch on my `move_call.patch` from #1173, but we can just apply yours.

Here are the timings for `sgn()`:


```
sage: load /home/burcin/sage/sign_fn.py
sage: sf = SignFunc()
sage: %timeit sf(5) 
625 loops, best of 3: 378 ns per loop
sage: %timeit sgn(5)                   
625 loops, best of 3: 3.49 Âµs per loop
```


Contents of the file `sign_fn.py`:


```
from sage.symbolic.function import BuiltinFunction

class SignFunc(BuiltinFunction):
    def __init__(self):
        BuiltinFunction.__init__(self, "sign")
```


The `_alt_name` code path is still taking up valuable time. It would be better to settle what name we use in the constructor and only try one option. If `alt_name` is set, we use that, otherwise, we use `name`.

There are a couple of doctest failures in `sage/functions` due to precision changes.

Added attachment that fixes some doctests, in each case the returned result has been changed to be of the same parent as the input.

So... is this needs work? Just trying to clarify what the situation is here.

I fixed the failed doctest and removed the old-style line continuations. Let's not let the perfect be the enemy of the good here. I disagree that the altname taking up time is a big issue--getting rid of this functionality is a much larger (and backwards incompatible) change, and for those functions without an alt name (most of them) the overhead is a single pointer comparison.

I would be likely to agree with this sentiment.  Burcin, are you okay with Robert's main patch in that case, as it seems?  Then we can just look at the doctests and make sure that was all of the fixes.

I'm not clear on what would be backwards-incompatible, though?


---

Comment by robertwb created at 2013-06-13 16:19:02

It's backwards incompatible because if some objects (defined within or outside of Sage) define sgn() and others define sign(), removing this aliasing would cause one or the other break. 

If we decide to go this route, I think it should be a separate ticket than this performance enhancement.

Okay, you're not saying that anything in _this_ ticket is breaking anything.  I didn't think so...

Hi guys!  This seems to have either
 * exposed inadequate case-checking in trig.py, or
 * contained a bug for functions which are `BuiltinFunction`s but used to be directly evaluated using `Function`'s `__call__` method, as opposed to the one now in `BuiltinFunction` (which used to only be used for `GinacFunction`).
Can one of you take a look at comment:31:ticket:13246 to help us ascertain which one it is?   Thanks!
