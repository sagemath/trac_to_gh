What about the doctest I suggested to add ? Do you have a simple example of something that was broken but now works ?

I am a little surprised this is a bug. It is definitely bad form (so this change should be done), but I don't see how it would lead to a bug.

ok, given the nature of the ticket, I will let it enter without a doctest
