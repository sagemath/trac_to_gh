The module `sage.plot.plot3d.texture` defines a `Texture_class` class, and a `Texture` function that acts as its alternate constructor, along with an `is_Texture` function, Ã  la the old scheme used elsewhere in Sage.

As discussed elsewhere (e.g. in #12824) the `is_Texture` function should be deprecated.  The `Texture` function and `Texture_class` class can be merged into a single `Texture` class with use of a `__classcall__` method.

I do think the use of `__classcall__` is a bit overkill here, since it's basically just doing some argument pre-processing that could probably just as well be done in the `__init__`.  I thought maybe it would also cache some textures but apparently it doesn't even do that.

That said, this branch preserves the existing functionality, and I think in a better way than having a separate `Texture_class` and `Texture` factory function.

Moving tickets from the Sage 8.8 milestone that have been actively worked on in the last six months to the next release milestone (optimistically).

Batch modifying tickets that will likely not be ready for 9.1, based on a review of the ticket title, branch/review status, and last modification date.
