If you try to create a non-associative algebra, the default attempt at a base ring coercion will fail:


```
sage: from sage.categories.magmatic_algebras import MagmaticAlgebras
sage: cat = MagmaticAlgebras(QQ).WithBasis().Unital()
sage: F = CombinatorialFreeModule(QQ, (1,), category=cat)
...
ValueError: Free module generated by {1} over Rational Field is not in Category of rings
```


OK. We can fix this by disabling that coercion with a magic attribute. But if we also define an element constructor that doesn't do base ring coercion,


```
sage: class Foo(CombinatorialFreeModule):
....:     _no_generic_basering_coercion = True
....:     def _element_constructor_(self,x):
....:         if x in self:
....:             return x
....:         else:
....:             raise ValueError
```


Then when we try to create a random_element(), boom:


```
sage: from sage.categories.magmatic_algebras import MagmaticAlgebras
sage: C = MagmaticAlgebras(QQ).WithBasis().Unital()
sage: F = Foo(QQ,(1,),category=C)
sage: F.random_element()
...
ValueError:
```


The crash happens at the use of self(0) in the ModulesWithBasis random_element() method. Normally it's not a problem because the default element constructor has a special case for int(0), but (a) that doesn't work if you override it; and (b) using self.zero() works better in all cases anyway.

There's another issue with this function: it doesn't check to see if the basis is empty before trying to use it.
