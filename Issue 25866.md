Keywords: finite fields, polynomial quotient ring

Towers of finite fields are hard to work with because they lose most of the nice functionality of simple extensions of prime finite fields and are also much slower.

Therefore it would be useful to have a method that turns a tower into a simple extension. More generally there should be a function `simple_model(base=None)` on polynomial quotient rings that returns an isomorphic simple extension of `base` together with isomorphisms. `base` should default to the prime subfield.

Initially this would only be implemented for trivial extensions and towers of finite fields.

See #25976 for a followup and https://github.com/MCLF/mclf/issues/103 for some context.

Without proper support for morphisms with base_morphisms, the output is slightly ugly:

```
sage: k = GF(2)
sage: R.<a> = k[]
sage: l.<a> = k.extension(a^3 + a^2 + 1)
sage: l.absolute_field()

   From: Finite Field in a of size 2^3
   To:   Finite Field in z3 of size 2^3
   Defn:   Ring morphism:
           From: Finite Field in a of size 2^3
           To:   Univariate Polynomial Ring in a over Finite Field of size 2 (using GF2X)
           Defn: a |--> a
         then
           Ring morphism:
           From: Univariate Polynomial Ring in a over Finite Field of size 2 (using GF2X)
           To:   Univariate Polynomial Ring in a over Finite Field in z3 of size 2^3

                   To:   Finite Field in z3 of size 2^3
                   Defn:   Identity endomorphism of Finite Field of size 2
                         then
                           Ring morphism:
                           From: Finite Field of size 2
                           To:   Finite Field in z3 of size 2^3
                           Defn: 1 |--> 1
         then
           Ring morphism:
           From: Univariate Polynomial Ring in a over Finite Field in z3 of size 2^3
           To:   Finite Field in z3 of size 2^3
           Defn: a |--> z3^2 + 1, Ring morphism:
   From: Finite Field in z3 of size 2^3
   To:   Finite Field in a of size 2^3
   Defn: z3 |--> a^2 + a)
```


Unfortunately, this does not work yet if we add another extension on top:

```
sage: R.<b> = l[]
sage: m.<b> = l.extension(b^2 + b + a)
sage: m.absolute_field()
AttributeError: no attribute absolute_field
```


The problem is that even though `m` is in the category of finite fields, it does not inherit the parent methods for some reason.

It only gets worse for larger towers:

```
sage: R.<b> = l[]
sage: m.<b> = l.extension(b^2 + b + a)
sage: m.is_field() # refines category
sage: m.absolute_field()

Changing keywords from "finite fields, polynomial quotient ring" to "finite fields, polynomial quotient ring, padicBordeaux".

https://gitlab.com/sagemath/sage/-/merge_requests/33 implements this in a more general way it seems.

So what's been done here is probably irrelevant.
