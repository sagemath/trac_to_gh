The test never should have been added in #27749 in the first place. It's an upstream bug. Now this test is copy/pasted in THREE places:

  * The upstream test suite
  * The sage test suite
  * spkg-configure.m4 for the affected package

Are we going to do this three times for every bug in every math library?

#27749 is done and dusted. The current ticket makes sure the system pari/gp is not buggy. 
We probably could have just as well checked the version of pari...

Isuru, by the way, this bug is present in the current Conda's pari 2.11.2.

Note that PARI 2.13.0 is out; upgrading
to that new version is tracked at #30801.

Looking good and seems to work (tested on `ubuntu-bionic-standard` and `ubuntu-groovy-standard`)

Thanks for the heads up. I update the pari package in conda to 2.11.4
