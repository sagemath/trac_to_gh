We can accomplish the same thing through a configuration option, as long as we also silence some docbuilding warnings.

We want Sage's doctest blocks (and most other literal blocks) to be typeset as Python console code. Setting the default highlighting language to `pycon` does this, and it means that we can then not use the highlighting patch for Sphinx.

Currently in Sage, there are some blocks which are not highlighted correctly. See [this page](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/modules/sage/modules/tutorial_free_modules.html): in the first block (containing `CombinatorialFreeModule?`), the prompt "sage:" is not highlighted. With the proposed change, that block will still not be highlighted the way we want, and in fact it will produce a warning:

```
WARNING: Could not lex literal_block as "pycon". Highlighting skipped.
```

We have set up the docbuilding process so that warnings stop it, so we also need to silence this warning.

There are no doubt some blocks in the Sage code which should not be highlighted using `pycon`, but as things stand in current Sage, Sphinx already tries to highlight them using the `default` lexer, which basically means `python3` with a graceful failure if it can't parse it as Python 3: see [the Sphinx docs](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/configuration.html#confval-highlight_language). Once we set the highlighting language to something other than `default`, we lose the graceful failure, and so we have to silence the warnings.

In my spot-checking, the current non-Python console blocks fail their highlighting and so have no highlighting at all, and that behavior continues with this branch. At some point we could try to modify those blocks: something like

```
Here is a block::

.. highlight:: rest

    stuff
```

But that can be on another ticket.
