Two overrides necessary to make `load('http://rlmiller.org/de_codes/get_code.php?id=16_08')` work - result of using #21065

Two trivial PEP8 things:

```diff
-register_unpickle_override(
-    'sage.rings.ring', 'unpickle_FiniteField_prm', unpickle_FiniteField_prm)
+register_unpickle_override('sage.rings.ring', 'unpickle_FiniteField_prm',
+                           unpickle_FiniteField_prm)
```

and

```diff
-register_unpickle_override(
-    'sage.rings.finite_field_prime_modn', 'FiniteField_prime_modn',
-    FiniteField_prime_modn)
+register_unpickle_override('sage.rings.finite_field_prime_modn',
+                           'FiniteField_prime_modn', FiniteField_prime_modn)
```

Otherwise LGTM.

Thanks for taking a look! I am a bit confused about PEP8, it seems to me that I am using one of the acceptable formats with hanging indent: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#indentation

Ah, right, that is acceptable. I've just been using the first and thought that was the (marginally?) more preferred way. Thanks.
