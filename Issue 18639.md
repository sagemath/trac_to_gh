Some issues:
- You should return a tuple instead of a list, so `(6, [9, 5, 8, 4, 6, 0, 7, 3, 1, 2])` instead of `[6, [9, 5, 8, 4, 6, 0, 7, 3, 1, 2]]`.
- I don't know how to do, but it would be nice to see `bandwidth_heuristics` in the html output of the bandwidth module.
- Not working with trivial graphs

Hello!

> - You should return a tuple instead of a list, so `(6, [9, 5, 8, 4, 6, 0, 7, 3, 1, 2])` instead of `[6, [9, 5, 8, 4, 6, 0, 7, 3, 1, 2]]`.

Done!

Probably we need to use types.FunctionType, as we used types.MethodType when we were working with the dominator tree. However, I have troubles finding the right command (and I have very little experience with these routines). Nathann, can you help us?

> - Not working with trivial graphs

Done, and added a doctest!

```

Note that you can simple write `return bandwidth, [int_to_vertex[result[i]] for i in range(n)]` and it will return a tuple. 

I did the following test and it's working ;)

```
sage: G = Graph(loops=True, multiedges=True)
sage: G.add_edge(0,0,'a')
sage: G.add_edge(0,0,'b')
sage: G.edges()
[(0, 0, 'a'), (0, 0, 'b')]
sage: bandwidth_heuristics(G)
(0, [0])
sage: bandwidth_heuristics(G, algorithm='king')
(0, [0])
```


Let see if Nathann has a good trick for adding the algorithm to the documentation of the bandwidth module.

Hello Michele,

It seems that the easiest solution is to add an index of the methods as done for `vertex_separation` and to point directly to the description of the method in the `boost_graph` module.

Volker,

The develop branch we use is 6.8, and ticket #18868 is not in it. Consequently, and unless we are doing something wrong with git, we don't have any merge conflict (see below [1]).

However, I'm not able to merge ticket #18868 on top of the current develop branch (see below [2])!


So, can I set this ticket to positive review ?

Best,
David.

I have merged with beta0, and I solved a conflict in bandwidth file. I have tested the whole graph part of the library, and all tests were passed.

Hope now the conflict is solved!
