The thread http://lists.apple.com/archives/unix-porting/2006/Aug/msg00022.html started years ago by Justin C. Walker on how to build Singular on OS X (for Sage!) brought some more insights.

If one uses "g++ -dynamiclib ..." instead of "libtool -dynamic ..." (note the "lib" at the ending of "-dynamiclib", this seems to superspecial for g++ instead of just gcc on Mac OS X) to build libsingular.dylib, then together with the changes I already wrote in #6470, the modified 3.1.0.4 singular spkg from #6362 (as included in Sage-4.1.rc0) seems finally to (build and also to) work on OS X.

But one not only needs to adapt "src.Singular.Makefile.in" which is already in the patch directory, but also add some "src.Singular.config.in" there and even "src.Singular.config" because although the Makefile is created from Makefile.in in the install process, config is *not* updated from config.in. This will take some more time, and testing also for the PPC Darwin target. I see if can do that soon and upload a new spkg for review, but probably not in the next days.

Can someone please point me to the most recent 3-1-0-4 SPKG I should start working on? I am visiting the Singular group right now so I have them within reach for the week.

The last "official" Singular 3-1-0-4 spkg was the one included in Sage-4.1.rc0. Since I couldn't find a still working link, I uploaded it here: http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/weberg/spkg/singular-3-1-0-4-20090703.spkg.

However, this is "work in progress", the last changes were done in a quick and hackish way, e.g. altering directly the files under /src/ inside the spkg. The remaining work would be to:
1. clean this up, e.g. create new files under /patch/, make sage-install copy these over, update mercurial repository, ...
2. make (and test) these changes also for MacPPC

Sorry, I didn't get around doing this yet, so you'll have to look into the half-cooked new spkg and search for the "newest" files via modification time. If you have questions, please ask.

It seems Georg's fix to replace `-dynamic` with `-dynamiclib` is not universally valid (i.e. on bsd.math it wouldn't compile with his change applied)

aginiewicz can you send me a patch with your GCC 4.4 patches, your server is down and I can't track down your changes.

Martin,

I currently only have GCC 4.4 on my laptop and on a rather slow machine at the office.  If you need access to it, I can make an account for you there.

Anyway, the new spkg builds fine for me.  I am running tests now.
