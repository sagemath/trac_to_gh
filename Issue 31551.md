# Issue 31551: Parallel computing is acting weird

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31788

Original creator: @galashin

Original creation time: 2021-05-07 08:55:01

Here is some sample parallel code taken from [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/19699363):


```
from multiprocessing import Pool
def myfunc(x):
    return [i for i in range(x)]

A = []
def mycallback(x):
    print('mycallback is called with {}'.format(x))
    A.extend(x)

pool=Pool()
r = pool.map_async(myfunc, (1,2), callback=mycallback)
r.wait()
print(A)
```


In usual python, it outputs

```
mycallback is called with [[0], [0, 1]]
[[0], [0, 1]]
```

In Sage-python (e.g. cocalc.com), it outputs

```
[]
```

SageMath version 9.3.rc5 gives same result as python.
