CC:  @tobiasdiez @jhpalmieri @kiwifb @dimpase

Just loading `src/setup.py` already pulls in Cython, `numpy`, and `pkgconfig` via `sage_setup`, so these distributions would have to be declared as `[build_system] requires` in `src/pyproject.toml` (ex `setup_requires`)

By moving some computations from import-time to runtime, we get rid of this dependency on `pkgconfig`, `numpy`.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/30580

This is from `src/sage_setup/command/sage_build_cython.py`:
{{{
# Work around GCC-4.8 bug which miscompiles some sig_on() statements:
# * http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/14460

# * http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=56982
if subprocess.call("""$CC --version | grep -i 'gcc.* 4[.]8' >/dev/null """, shell=True) == 0:
    extra_compile_args.append('-fno-tree-copyrename')
}}}
This gives an (ignored) error when `CC` is not set -- this defect is not new in this ticket.
