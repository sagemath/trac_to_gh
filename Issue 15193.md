Why use a sage specific cycache directory? Why not something like `~/.cycache`? (IMHO, Cython should use a default directory if `Cython.Compiler.Main.default_options['cache'] is True`).

Also, I think it should be togglable by an environment variable, say `DISABLE_CYCACHE`, in case someone doesn't want to use (e.g. for testing purposes/cython development purposes).

The ccache spkg also uses `$DOT_SAGE/ccache`. 

With this patch you can disable caching by passing an invalid directory. Ugly but yet another undocumented environment variable isn't that great either.

Supporting boolean `Cython.Compiler.Main.default_options['cache']` and/or using `os.makedirs()` instead of `mkdir` are just Cython enhancement requests, maybe you want to post that to the Cython trac?

That's not actually true. Sage doesn't set the `ccache` directory.
