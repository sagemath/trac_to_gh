Posting this example, so I won't forget:

An example for simpliness and simpliciality could look like this:

```
sage: for i in Combinations(6,3):
....:     x.append(list(Integer(j in i) for j in range(6)))
....: P = Polyhedron(vertices=x)
....: C = CombinatorialPolyhedron(P)
....: C.simpliness()
4
....: C.simpliciality()
2
....: C.dimension()
5
```

One can replace `6` by `n` and this will alter `4` to `n-2` and `5` to `n-1`.

(This example is taken from lecture notes from GÃ¼nter M. Ziegler.)

In `simplicity` method: 
* I suggest to change the definition of `k-simple`. Using the definition you give, one needs to know `P/F`.

```diff
-        A polytope `P` is `k`-simple, if for every face `F`
-        of codimension `k` the polytope `P/F` is simple.
+        A polytope `P` is `k`-simple, if every `(d-1-k)`-face
+        is contained in `k+1` facets of `P` for `1 <= k <= d-1`.
```




* coface instead of face:

```diff
            if face_iter.n_atom_rep() == d + 1:
-                # The current face is a simplex.
+                # The current coface is a simplex.
                face_iter.ignore_supfaces()
```


* Since you are dealing with cofaces, maybe you need to do the following change

```diff
-        cdef FaceIterator face_iter = self._face_iter(True, -2)
+        cdef FaceIterator coface_iter = self._face_iter(True, -2)
```
