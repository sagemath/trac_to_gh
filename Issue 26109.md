I should say that I don't like `thematic_tutorials/functional_programming.rst`: I think we should be suggesting that people use list comprehensions and `for` loops instead of `map` and `reduce`. That certainly seems to be the direction Python is going, especially since `reduce` is no longer a built in function in Python 3. But I didn't want to rewrite that document right now. Should I open up another ticket for that rewrite?

Yes, a rewrite should be a second ticket. Python3 still supports a number of functional programming operations/paradigms, but all are returning views (AFAIK). We probably want someone who does functional programming (e.g., a lisp programmer) to do the bulk of the rewrite.
