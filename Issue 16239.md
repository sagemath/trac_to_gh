In the construction of Stinson book the `BIBD(25,4,1)` comes from a difference family so we can just add it to the database. Moreover the function `PBD_4_5_8_9_12` previously failed for `v=4,5,7,8,9,12` where the trivial answer `[range(v)]` just fits.

Good to go ! I wondered about that though... Do we care ? Should we check that the set of block sizes contains integer > 1 ?

Actually, it would make more sense to have `is_pairwise_balanced_design` in `designs_pyx.pyx`... and testing that blocks are non-empty certainly needed! What do you want do be added to that ticket?

I will add a commit in a second to check this, before we move it to another file.

In the meantime could you check the doc of #16461 ? It does not build on my computer and Volker will set it back to needs_work.

What do we do with the PBD with v=1 or v=0 and many sets of size 0,1 ?
