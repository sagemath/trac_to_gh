A topic of interest for number theorists working in arithmetic dynamics is the tree that is formed by pre-images of a point under iteration of a dynamical system. In particular, the action of the so-called arboreal Galois group on these trees is an area of recent study. We provide functionality for computing and displaying these nth-preimage trees.
