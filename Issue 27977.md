A topic of interest for number theorists working in arithmetic dynamics is the tree that is formed by pre-images of a point under iteration of a dynamical system. In particular, the action of the so-called arboreal Galois group on these trees is an area of recent study. We provide functionality for computing and displaying these nth-preimage trees.

Not entirely sure how to format documentation for the helper function since its input is virtually identical to the actual function. Seems a bit redundant to basically just copy and paste everything.
