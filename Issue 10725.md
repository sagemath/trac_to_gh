Nothing to complain about here, except long lines like on #10781. Same remark `:-)`

(very pretty layout, by the way !)

Same remark as on #10781. Glad you liked the layout! I was, rather, afraid it would be seen more as pretentious or silly, haha.

Since the hyperlink to the MathWorld and Wikipedia articles are not meant to be refered to from a different place, you should make links with _two_ trailing underscores.  See [http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html#embedded-uris](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html#embedded-uris)

Same comment as on #10781. Well, except with MathWorld replaced with MathWorld, I guess :)
