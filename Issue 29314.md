From sage-devel thread

```
B = [[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10],
 [1, 2, 3, 7, 10, 11],
 [1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 10],
 [1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 10],
 [1, 2, 5, 6, 10, 11],
 [1, 2, 7, 8, 9, 10],
 [2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 10],
 [2, 3, 4, 9, 10, 11],
 [2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 11],
 [2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10],
 [2, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11],
 [2, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11]]
C = B + [[1..11]]
I1 = IncidenceStructure([1..11],B)
I2 = IncidenceStructure([1..11],C)
A1 = I1.automorphism_group()
A2 = I2.automorphism_group()
A1.order()==A2.order()
```

returs false - the group orders are 96 and 32, rather than equal.
This still is correct (same group) in Sage 8.9 with Python 2, but wrong in 9.1.rc0 as well as in 9.0 (with Python 3).

Can it not be possible that the case is like a particular nuance? because as reported by the user in Sage-Devel, the results were accurate for the other test cases?
p.s : Just an observation, nevertheless, it needs to be fixed

it is indeed a corner case, as the "full" block, as added in C, is not usual. If you want to fix this, look at the code of IncidenceStructure and check that the automorphism group of the incidence graph constructed there is not correct, for some reason.

I could reproduce the bug with version 9.1.rc0 under Python 2 and on a stable 8.1, too. So it seemes, that it is older than 8.9 but disappeared for a while.

I think this bug is located in `search_tree` (`sage.groups.perm_gps.partn_ref.refinement_graphs`) since with optional package `bliss` installed it is not reproducible.

Samuel, does #30637 fail with `bliss`, as well?

are correct. As well, wihout bliss,

```
sage: I2.dual().automorphism_group().order()

48
```

which is consistent with 96/2=48 (there are two points, 2  and 10, which are in all the blocks, so there is an order two automorhism (2,10) fixing all blocks).
