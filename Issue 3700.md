# Issue 3700: [with spkg, needs review] Solaris: Fix ntl build issue

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/3700

Currently we skip the setup on Solaris which completely breaks ntl on Solaris. The spkg at

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mabshoff/release-cycles-3.0.6/alpha1/ntl-5.4.2.p4.spkg

fixes that.

Cheers,

Michael
