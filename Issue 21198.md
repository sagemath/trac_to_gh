Minor doc formatting:

```diff
-        - ``letter1`` - a letter in the alphabet
+        - ``letter1`` -- a letter in the alphabet
```

Once that is changed, you can set a positive review on my behalf.

ok, done. Thanks a lot Travis.

I am just slightly worried by the fact that I did not do a proper
deprecation, and may have broken things for intensive users of words. Of course, this is rather harmless, as most users will just use the standard default increasing alphabetical order, for which nothing has changed.

Let me set this to positive review. If somebody object, please react now.
