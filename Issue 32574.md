Why use `Parent` instead of `ParentWithGens`?

I'm actually wondering why we call some low level init instead of just relying on `Algebra.__init__`?

In brief, `ParentWithGens` is part of the "old-coercion-framework", which is still used a lot, in particular in number fields and commutative rings. This is supposed to be deprecated, but removing that is a daunting task.

I see. However what is confusing me is that we are still inheriting from `Algebra`:


```
class QuaternionAlgebra_abstract(Algebra):
```


If this is correct, we should initialize `Algebra`. If this is not correct, we should just straight inherit from `Parent`.
