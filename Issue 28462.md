Usually we don't attach tarballs to the ticket but give a link in the summary. As a distro person I would much prefer an upstream link to the tarball.

This was what we did a few months ago on #28007. Where else would I put this file?

I guess if you don't have anywhere else to host it, that's OK. After inspection I take the tarball directly from the sage mirror which means it is not currently available anywhere else. Technically, you could create that tarball and upload it as a binary assets in your github release. I do that for brial.

LGTM. I've tested it on [this notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/egourgoulhon/SageMathTest/blob/master/Worksheets/sage_reference_threejs.ipynb).
Thanks for the upgrade!
