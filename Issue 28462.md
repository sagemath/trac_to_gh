Usually we don't attach tarballs to the ticket but give a link in the summary. As a distro person I would much prefer an upstream link to the tarball.

I guess if you don't have anywhere else to host it, that's OK. After inspection I take the tarball directly from the sage mirror which means it is not currently available anywhere else. Technically, you could create that tarball and upload it as a binary assets in your github release. I do that for brial.
