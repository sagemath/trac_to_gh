```
sage: M = matrix([[1, 2], [3, 4.4]])
sage: P = M.parent()
sage: P
Full MatrixSpace of 2 by 2 dense matrices over Real Field with 53 bits of precision
sage: P.is_exact()
True
```

Doesn't work yet because somehow `Parent.is_exact` wins

Any concrete class wins by design. You have to remove it (or modify it) to make it go up to the category implementation.

Should every parent actually have an `is_exact` method? Its docstring refers to rings

IMO, they should not as it doesn't make sense for every parent. It is just more of a historical point when nearly everything in Sage was a ring IIRC. I think we are basically okay removing it, but a sage-devel post might be warranted.
