Any concrete class wins by design. You have to remove it (or modify it) to make it go up to the category implementation.

IMO, they should not as it doesn't make sense for every parent. It is just more of a historical point when nearly everything in Sage was a ring IIRC. I think we are basically okay removing it, but a sage-devel post might be warranted.
