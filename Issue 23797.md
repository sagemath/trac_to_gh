What's wrong with `QQ(string)`? Are we going to disallow that?

well, this screams (in the experimental python3 build that nobody seems to care about) that bytes is expected and str is given. I am just trying to move forward to more serious issues.

Maybe the call QQ('string') will need to be fixed, but not now and here.

Replying to [comment:4 chapoton]:

Then just fix it in your experimental branch instead of an official Sage Trac ticket.

This I did for sure. But the change is so small that I assumed it would meet no objection.

In `lie_algebras/all.py`, could we change

```
from .import examples as lie_algebras
```

to

```
from . import examples as lie_algebras
```

Why don't other instances of `QQ(str)` fail? There are some for example in `rings/rational.pyx`.

I don't mind the QQ changes on this ticket, since it is not changing any doctests and not changing any functionality of Sage, just changing how a few rational numbers are initialized in the Sage code.

Thanks.

This ticket is part of the effort to make sage start when built with python3. It turns out that one of these QQ(string) was sitting on the road. It does not pretend to fix anything else.

Ready to go, if patchbots say green ?
