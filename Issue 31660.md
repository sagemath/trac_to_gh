Yes, let's work on finishing #32324 next. Thank you both very much for your hard work on this.

I pushed one trivial fix to take care of an unneeded import from pyflakes. I am allowing myself to set this to a positive review since the clean patchbot, and I double-checked with my last commit locally.

Sorry to jump in with some naive questions and comments,
feel free to ignore. Or to set back to positive review
and to open a follow-up ticket instead.

These class names mix camel case and underscores:

```
CoefficientStream_add
CoefficientStream_cauchy_product
CoefficientStream_sub
CoefficientStream_composition
CoefficientStream_lmul
CoefficientStream_rmul
CoefficientStream_neg
CoefficientStream_cauchy_inverse
CoefficientStream_map_coefficients
CoefficientStream_zero
CoefficientStream_exact
CoefficientStream_uninitialized
CoefficientStream_shift
```

Is that usual? Naively I would have expected:

```
CoefficientStreamAdd
CoefficientStreamCauchyProduct
CoefficientStreamSub
CoefficientStreamComposition
CoefficientStreamLmul
CoefficientStreamRmul
CoefficientStreamNeg
CoefficientStreamCauchyInverse
CoefficientStreamMapCoefficients
CoefficientStreamZero
CoefficientStreamExact
CoefficientStreamUninitialized
CoefficientStreamShift
```


I'm sure it's just my ignorance and you'll point me
to other examples.

Could names be shortened by using Stream
instead of CoefficientStream?

Change which L is capitalised:

```diff
-The coefficient stream can be used to build up a Lazy laurent series::
+The coefficient stream can be used to build up a lazy Laurent series::
```


Unclear syntax:


```
Two coefficient streams can be composed (depending on whether it exists)::
```


Typo:


```diff
         The default is to always return ``False`` as it
-        cannot be decided or they are equal.
+        cannot be decided whether they are equal.
```


In comments, use sentences with initial capital
and final period, and regular indentation
(with additional minor rephrasing suggestions).


```diff
             # We cannot pickle a generator object, so we remove it and
-            #   the cache from the pickle information.
+            # the cache from the pickle information.
```



```diff
         # We do not insist that the last entry of initial_coefficients
-        #   is different from constant in case comparisons can be
-        #   expensive such as in the symbolic ring
+        # is different from constant in case comparisons can be
+        # expensive such as in the symbolic ring.
```



```diff
-            # the constant part makes no contribution to the negative
-            # we need this for the case so self._neg_powers[0][n] => 0
+            # The constant part makes no contribution to the negative.
+            # We need this for the case so self._neg_powers[0][n] => 0.
```



```diff
-        v = self._approximate_order  # shorthand name
+        v = self._approximate_order  # shorthand name for this "order" or "valuation"
-        n = 0  # Counts the number of places from the order
+        n = 0  # shift from the "order" position
         yield self._ainv
+        # Note that first entry of the cache will correspond to z^v
+        # The first entry of the cache is the coefficient of z^v
```



```diff
-        # We don't hash the function in case that happens to not be hashable
+        # We don't hash the function as it might not be hashable.
```


In examples blocks, end introductory sentences with `::` or `. ::`
but not `.::` (as I think that would render as ".:" -- please check).


```diff
-generating functions for sequences arising in combinatorics.::
+generating functions for sequences arising in combinatorics.::
```



```diff
-that are needed are computed.::
+that are needed are computed. ::
```



```diff
-coefficient are computed.::
+coefficient are computed. ::
```


Typos.


```diff
-    Two sequences can be subracted::
+    Two sequences can be subtracted::
```



```diff
-explcitly
+explicitly
```


Incorrect capitalisation (several occurrences):


```diff
-        Dense Implementation::
+        Dense implementation::
```



```diff
-        Sparse Implementation::
+        Sparse implementation::
```


Capitalise Laurent and end with period:


```diff
-                # One of the lazy laurent series is not known to eventually be constant
+                # One of the lazy Laurent series is not known to eventually be constant.
```


Rephrase:


```diff
-        # the product is exact if and only if both of the factors are
-        # exact, and one has eventually 0 coefficients:
+        # The product is exact if and only if both factors are exact
+        # and one of the factors has eventually 0 coefficients:
         #   (p + a x^d/(1-x))(q + b x^e/(1-x))
         #   = p q + (a x^d q + b x^e p)/(1-x) + a b x^(d+e)/(1-x)^2
```


Rephrase and fix typo in "coeffcients"


```
-            # (a x^d q)/(1-x) has constant a q(1), and the initial
-            # values are the cumulative sums of the coeffcients of q
+            # The series `(a * x^d * q) / (1 - x)` has constant term
+            # `a * q(1)`, and initial values the cumulative sums
+            # of the coefficients of `q`.
```


In several docstrings, "if" should be "whether", e.g.


```diff
+        Return if ``self`` is sparse or not.
+        Return whether ``self`` is sparse.
```

invalid escape sequences, and codespell

Comments on your changes:

In the test `L(0).map_coefficients(lambda c: c + 1)`, we should actually check the resulting stream is `Stream_zero`.

We should also better handle `truncate` and `__pow__` (with the special `0^0` returning `1`).


```diff
-return - other
+return -other
```

Running that argument further, `Stream_exact` and `Stream_inexact` could be seen as an implementation detail. All the user sees is the element of the lazy Laurent series. It is the developers that see more (as they need to).

Here we are actually wanting to test something about the implementation. Plus `Stream_zero` is a very special object because it is the only thing that will have a non-integer (approximate) order.

I don't think we should test `foo(L(0)) is L.zero()` as we cannot (nor should) presume there is a unique `zero` instance. Although this would be highly desirable.

Yes, that would be the test I would want to run here.

I have done the requested change.  The remainder of this comment is only for our personal enjoyment:

I think that there is quite a fundamental - and in fact user-visible - difference between `Stream_exact` and `Stream_inexact`.  It is user visible, since the big-O term is missing from the output.  It is fundamental, because we can decide equality.

I agree with your argument that `Stream_zero` is a very special object because of its infinite order.

I'm not sure whether you will hate me for this :-)

I think we should change the order of the optional arguments.  Currently, we have:

```
    def _element_constructor_(self, x=None, valuation=None, constant=None, degree=None):
```

I think

```
    def _element_constructor_(self, x=None, valuation=None, degree=None, constant=None):
```

would be more logical.  As I mentioned on #32309, we should also give the user the possibility to be explicit whether the argument is supposed to be interpreted as a polynomial or a function that yields the coefficients.  It appears to me, that the least disruptive way is

```
    def _element_constructor_(self, x=None, valuation=None, degree=None, constant=None, coefficients=None):
```


Note that the original code does only allows a single value as argument to the element constructor, which then returns a constant series.

Should we insist that valuation is an integer?

We currently test that it is not `None`, but I think it would be better to test `in ZZ`.  Of course, that won't help with silliness of `True`, but `isinstance(valuation, Integer)` seems a bit strict to me.

I'm afraid we should also do something about `series`.  The old signature was:

```
 series(coefficient, valuation, constant=None)

    Return a lazy Laurent series.

    INPUT:

        coefficient – Python function that computes coefficients

        valuation – integer; approximate valuation of the series

        constant – either None or pair of an element of the base ring and an integer
```

Currently, the signature is

```
    def series(self, coefficient, valuation, constant=None, degree=None):
```

which is confusing.

Should we make it 

```
    def series(self, coefficient, valuation, degree=None, constant=None):
```

and allow `degree` to be a pair `(constant, degree)` or

```
    def series(self, coefficient, valuation, constant=None):
```

?

(perhaps it would be better to deprecate this method anyway)

We still don't have a good replacement for what the `series` method does. However, I agree with changing the signature and allowing the pair input. I also did the same if someone does `constant=(a,b)`.
