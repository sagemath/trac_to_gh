The code in `UnitalAlgebras.ParentMethods.__init_extra__` to determine a coercion from the base ring to the algebra is quite obscure (and probably buggy). Moreover, it doesn't work on Python 3.

Since properly cleaning this up didn't work, I instead refactor the code, adding plenty of comments to explain what is happening.

This is a pure refactoring: no functionality is changed.

Original ticket description kept for reference:

This code

```
            try:
                has_custom_conversion = self.category().parent_class.from_base_ring.__func__ is not self.from_base_ring.__func__
            except AttributeError:
                # Sometimes from_base_ring is a lazy attribute
                has_custom_conversion = True
```
is trying to determine whether `from_base_ring` comes from the category or not. However, in the case of a lazy attribute it wrongly sets `has_custom_conversion = True` without checking equality, even if the lazy attribute comes from the category.

Now there are two ways to solve this:

1. Keep (and document) the current behaviour, namely that the `has_custom_conversion = True` branch is always taken if `from_base_ring` is a lazy attribute.

2. Fix the bug and set `has_custom_conversion = False` if `from_base_ring` is a non-custom lazy attribute. Unfortunately, this leads to further breakage:

Regardless of this bug, the code to do this check can be improved. The reason why the `__func__` access is needed in the first place is because we are trying to compare an *unbound* method with a *bound* method. If we have unbound methods on both sides of the equality, it can be simplified and fixed.

So use `six.get_unbound_function` on both sides.  The function name is a bit of a mouthful, but it's very accurate and unambiguous as to what it does...

Another way to spell it is `the_func = getattr(the_method, '__func__', the_method)` but it's a little less obvious what the intent is of that.

Hi Jeroen!

I have just been through the new version. It is now much much clearer what the current logic does; thanks a lot! The logic is still crappy and way too complicated. but it's indeed very reasonable to split the work in two stages (in this ticket: fixing the Python 3 issue + clarifying the current logic; in a later ticket:fix/improve the logic).

Positive review on my side.

Just one question: while rewriting the code, did you do some additional manual tests to check how things worked? Or were the current doctests sufficient? In the former case, in case you still have your manual tests under hand, could you add them to the doctests?

Thanks again,
