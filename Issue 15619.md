Complementary to finite sequences, implement infinite sequences associated with `category InfiniteEnumeratedSets`, as elements of parent `InfiniteSequenceRing`. This ring class should be abstract, with subclass `GeneratedSequence`, itself as a template to forthcoming subclasses, for example `CFiniteSequenceRing` (#15714), `PFiniteSequenceRing` (), `AutomaticSequenceRing` (#13542).

You should have a look into `sage.combinat.words`... there already his some stuff about finite/infinite sequences (though from a combinatorial point of view).

This ticket may be obsolete mainly because of #15852 which first had a different (and grander) direction. Now it's just to move `Sequence` out of `categories`.
