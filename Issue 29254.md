# Issue 29254: gp2c spkg-configure.m4 cleanup

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29491

Thanks to some other improvements, the spkg-configure check for gp2c can be cleaned up a bit:

* We can use DEPCHECK instead of manually checking if the pari SPKG will be installed
* We don't need to suggest to the user that she install gp2c from the system

And there's one huge annoyance that I need to fix but I'm not sure how yet:

* The `find /usr -name pari.cfg` call takes forever, because it searches through a million files.

Can we collect a list of places that pari.cfg is installed by the pari system package? I think we should just loop through them all. Gentoo is `/usr/share/pari/pari.cfg`, so I have that one. I still need to know where pari.cfg winds up on,

* Debian
* Fedora
* Arch
* Conda
* Homebrew

Then I can turn that `find` into a loop (I know this will be something weird on Conda, the spkg-configure in reality uses a relative path).

On Conda, it's `<PREFIX>/lib/pari/pari.cfg`. (`gp` executable is `<PREFIX>/bin/gp`)

On Debian, it's at `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/pari/pari.cfg` for `x86_64`

Thanks, I added the i386, arm64, and sparc debian arches from https://wiki.debian.org/Multiarch/Tuples as well. (It would be easy to add more if more than zero users are observed.)

`dpkg-architecture -qDEB_BUILD_MULTIARCH` will give you the native debian architecture.

At least we're testing some of them -- see tox.ini

Ok, I added the whole list of "released" arch tuples. Are we testing any systems that use something other than those? (Some are obvious, but I can't guess what tuple e.g. arm32v5 in tox.ini corresponds to.)

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2020-04-09 23:53:31

I don't know the details about the various ARM arch variants beyond what I have gathered in tox.ini


---

Comment by mjo created at 2020-04-09 23:55:28

On second thought, I can just write a shell script to mimic `dpkg-architecture -qDEB_BUILD_MULTIARCH` while I test, and use that if it produces non-null output.

And it looks like the homebrew recipe does nothing special with it, so it winds up in the sysdatadir, whose default is `$prefix/lib/pari`.

I can't promise that it works, but it's a lot faster.

Tests ran at https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/actions/runs/74977564

Failures see e.g. https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/575982350

```
Checking whether SageMath should install SPKG gp2c...
checking whether any of pari is installed as or will be installed as SPKG... yes; install gp2c as well
configure: no suitable system package found for SPKG gp2c
configure: gp prefix is .
configure: error: unable to locate pari.cfg
```


Whatever is happening in this test, it should definitely not terminate configure with an error...

To build the gp2c SPKG, we need to know where pari.cfg (installed by pari) lives. If not, you'll just get a build failure later on.

The nonexistent failure/success/whatever branch of SAGE_SPKG_DEPCHECK was being ignored, who would've thought. I wonder how many times I've copy/pasted that broken code...

Still failing. https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/577560337

Really shouldn't be using AC_MSG_ERROR at all here.
If gp2c spkg-configure can't find the needed bits of pari, then we have to build our own pari.

Forgot to `git add` before `git commit --amend`, ugh.

The existing check already fails if it can't find pari.cfg, it just takes longer. We've already decided to use the system pari at this point, and I'm not sure we can retroactively decide not to (what about all of the other packages that have already run DEPCHECK?). In any case, failures should be extremely rare, and when they do happen, we should add the new location to the list rather than silently rebuilding pari for people who probably don't even want gp2c. Related: is there some way to detect if --enable-gp2c was passed? We shouldn't have to run this code at all, by default.

Ah ok, I did not remember that gp2c is an optional package. That makes it more complicated. I have a similar problem with nauty vs. libnauty in #27952.

Unfortunately at this point the SAGE_SPKG_ENABLE calls are emitted after the SAGE_SPKG_CONFIGURE_* calls.
This could be changed easily, of course. Related: #29363

I have this change on the (unfinished) branch of #29054

I have created #29498 (Do not check for system packages of disabled optional packages) for this

This looks fine and seems to work well on Debian (https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/actions/runs/78581820).

Follow-up = #32359

gp2c is optional, so in some cases it is ok...
