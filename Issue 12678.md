Keywords: cyclotomic field

With the current coercion between cyclotomic fields, we get an non-commutative coercion diagram:


```
sage: CF1 = CyclotomicField(5)
sage: CF2 = CyclotomicField(5,embedding = (4 * CLF.pi() * CLF.gen() / 5).exp())
sage: CC(CF1.gen()-CF2.gen())
0
sage: CC(CF1.gen()) - CC(CF2.gen())                     
1.11803398874989 + 0.363271264002680*I
```
