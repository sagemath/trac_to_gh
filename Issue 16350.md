Keywords: sgn, evaluation

```
sage: M = sgn((3/2),hold=True); M.n()
...
TypeError: cannot evaluate symbolic expression numerically
```
The original problem is now resolved, it was reported in http://ask.sagemath.org/question/8535/problem-with-sign-sgn-and-n/ by Louis Cypher:

```
sage: M = sgn(cos(3/2))
sage: M.n()
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

TypeError: cannot evaluate symbolic expression numerically
```
kcrisman:

Problem seems to be that in `M.n??` we see that it's looking for `is_a_numeric(x._gobj)` but apparently that fails, as does the constant, so it thinks we are looking at evaluating `sgn(cos(x))` instead of `sgn(cos(3/2))`.

Actually all functions in `generalized.py` show this problem. Moreover, the `cos` can be left out:

```
sage: M = sgn((3/2),hold=True); M.n()

TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

```
All the generalized functions have this code in `_eval_()` and I believe the bug to be there:

```
        try:
            approx_x = ComplexIntervalField()(x)
            if bool(approx_x.imag() == 0):      # x is real
                if bool(approx_x.real() == 0):  # x is zero
                    return ...
                else:
                    return ...
            else:
                return ...            # x is complex
        except Exception:                     # x is symbolic
            pass

But now you create a `gen_eval()` method for everyone of those, why is that better?

No, I still do not see the reason for a new class.

To finally answer this, no, it will still trigger the exception with `M = sgn((3/2),hold=True); M.n()` and with `M = sgn(cos(3/2)); M.n()`.

The branch merges cleanly with develop (green link) so it should have worked after `git merge develop` on your machine. However, I've done it for you in the branch now, so you can simply check out.

Doctests pass. `dirac_delta`, `heaviside`, `unit_step` and `sign` function as expected for real arguments.

`kronecker_delta` returns an unexpected error for real arguments:

```

Looks like its trying to evaluate arguments as complex numbers.

And for future reference, is it expected practice for people to merge the current develop branch before pushing to Trac? Or is it a matter of how the branch is assembled, especially for older tickets, and I just need to pay attention to what gets pulled?

There should be as few merge commits as possible but you can't always adhere to that.

As author, you of course need to merge if what you uploaded before doesn't with develop (red link on ticket). But as you saw, there was a branch that was so old that it could no longer be compiled so I needed to merge it too. Note that as a reviewer you do not need to do `git trac checkout 12345; git merge develop` to get an up-to-date version of an older branch (that still merges cleanly). You can also branch from develop and pull changes: `git checkout -b tmp; git trac pull 12345`. This way your local Sage is not changed to the version of the branch and only the specific branch changes need to be compiled in.

So, to answer, in principle you need not merge the current develop branch before pushing as long as the branch merges cleanly with develop. A good reason to do it nevertheless would be that you want to make sure your changes pass tests (which are always done by patchbot or the RM with develop). What you want to pay attention to as reviewer OTOH is the age of the last merge commit (or the first commit if none) and rather pull (see above) than checkout if older than say 18 months.

I rewrote it all and pushed a new branch (this is also a way to get rid of merge commits). There was danger of infinite loops (see #12121). It also resolved the `kronecker` issue. Please review.
