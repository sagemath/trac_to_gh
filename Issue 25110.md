Experimental package for the HOL Light theorem prover (http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jrh13/hol-light/)

Assuming distribution package for OCaml is available. Tested on Homebrew, which has version 4.06.1.

Adding package `camlp5`. The package available in Homebrew does not seem to work for HOL light, probably because it has not been built in strict mode (https://github.com/jrh13/hol-light/blob/master/README)

```
(cd upstream && wget https://github.com/camlp5/camlp5/archive/rel705.tar.gz -O camlp5-7.05.tar.gz )
```

Adding package `hol-light`. Upstream () has no releases. For now we pull directly from their git. Alternatively, could use Debian's `.orig.tar.gz` (https://packages.debian.org/stretch/hol-light) as our upstream.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/25347

Just a comment on the installer scripts: you should use the `sdh_...` functions (grep for `sdh_make_install` for example).

I don't really like how you pull from git at install time. Better just make a proper package from the git repo. For `script` packages, there is no dependency or version checking.

And even if you do want to pull from git, this is really bad:

```
if [ -n "${FORMAL_INEQS_COMMIT}" ]; then
    git checkout ${FORMAL_INEQS_COMMIT}
else
    git pull --ff-only
fi
```
You really should fix a commit, not just pull whatever is on the master branch.

(NOTE: for experimental packages, you can do whatever you want. So take these comments as advice, not as a requirement)

Thanks for the comments; yes, these are very preliminary scripts and before I would set this ticket to review, it would be replaced by using a tarball.
