With

```
sage: f(x) = floor(x)
sage: g(x) = ceil(x)
sage: h(x) = factorial(x)
```

any of the following

```
sage: f(pi)._numerical_approx()
sage: g(pi)._numerical_approx()
sage: h(5)._numerical_approx()
```

will result in 

```
src/sage/symbolic/expression.pyx in sage.symbolic.expression.Expression._numerical_approx (build/cythonized/sage/symbolic/expression.cpp:27487)()
   4888         # in pynac
   4889         if is_a_numeric(x._gobj):
-> 4890             res = py_object_from_numeric(x._gobj)
   4891         elif  is_a_constant(x._gobj):
   4892             res = x.pyobject()

TypeError: cannot evaluate symbolic expression numerically
```
