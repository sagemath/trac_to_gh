How to build sage with python3:

```
make configure
./configure --with-python=3
make
```
Beware that the second step above should be redone after every `make distclean`.

---

For progress on making all doctests pass, see #26212 and #28298

In order to support python 3.7, the following needs to be fixed:

1. #15510 - upgrade to a newer version of setuptools
2. #15511 - upgrade to a newer version of rpy2
3. #15512 - upgrade to a newer version of sympy
4. #14854 - upgrade to a newer version of pycrypto
5. #15532 - upgrade to a newer version of networkx
6. #15537 - fix csage to work with python3
7. #15539 - switch from using PIL to Pillow
8. #15540 - trivial python3 fixes to a few spkgs
9. #15541 - fix sage-location and sage-download-file for python3
10. #15593 - remove sqlalchemy
11. #17591 - remove gdmodule
12. #15620 - Stop using `StandardError`
13. #15755 - upgrade cython to version 0.20.1
14. #15807 - upgrade mpmath to version 0.18
15. #15980 - meta-ticket for python3 compatibility of the sage library (stage 1)
16. #16052 - meta-ticket for python3 compatibility of the sage library (stage 2)
17. #17854 - remove c_lib
18. #18437 - fix polybori and python 3
19. #18537 - fix Pynac at least building against python 3
20. #17607 - add python 3 package
21. #27024 - make sagetex python3 compatible

Possibly relevant timeline from [PEP 373](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0373/):

Being the last of the 2.x series, 2.7 will have an extended period of maintenance. The current plan is to support it for at least 10 years from the initial 2.7 release. This means there will be bugfix releases until 2020.

There was also a autotools approach at #15594, which I think could be returned to (it was closed as won't fix in favor of distutils).

Pynac doesn't really support Python 3 (it builds against Python 3, but it is almost certainly broken, since it can only really be tested when sage can be built against Python 3).

Changed ticket title since we're now targeting Python 3.6 at a minimum (though most of the Python 3 work could probably go back to older Python 3's since everything is still compatible with Python 2.7).

I recently ran the doctests on my python3 branch (which contains many fixes not in develop yet, though I've yet to incorporate all the existing open tickets for python3 which might lead to more improvements).  I got roughly 540 failing modules.

Out of curiosity I thought I'd try a little experiment and ran the test log through the following:

```
$ sort logs/ptest.log | uniq -c | sort -nr
```

This just gives the text that appears most frequently in the test output.  Obviously the top examples are generic things like "6461     Traceback (most recent call last):"

But beyond that there are some interesting things that might help prioritize things to fix (and maybe some of these are already fixed in open tickets).  The top 20 error messages this brings up (excluding `NameError`s) are:

* `470     TypeError: unhashable type: 'NCPolynomialIdeal'`
* `360     TypeError: unhashable type: 'HyperellipticCurve_g2_rational_field_with_category'`
* `229     TypeError: expected bytes, str found`
* `196     TypeError: object of type 'map' has no len()`
* `176     TypeError: 'dict_values' object does not support indexing`
* `176     AttributeError: attribute '__dict__' of 'type' objects is not writable` (this one I know is #24786, so I'm going to try merging that into my python3 branch and see what that helps)
* `122     TypeError: '>' not supported between instances of 'float' and 'NoneType'`
* `115     TypeError: unhashable type: 'HyperellipticCurve_padic_field_with_category'`
* `104     AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'items'`
* `94     TypeError: sequence item 0: expected str instance, bytes found`
* `90     TypeError: unhashable type: 'ChowGroup_class_with_category'`
* `72     TypeError: <class 'sage.schemes.hyperelliptic_curves.hyperelliptic_g2_rational_field.HyperellipticCurve_g2_rational_field_with_category'> is not hashable and does not implement `_cache_`key()`
* `58     ValueError: Polyomino must be non empty`
* `58     TypeError: 'dict_keys' object is not subscriptable`
* `46     KeyError: ((<class 'sage.algebras.lie_algebras.classical_lie_algebra.LieAlgebraChevalleyBasis'>, Rational Field, ['A', 2]), ())`
* `45     TypeError: must be str, not bytes`
* `44     AttributeError: 'function' object has no attribute '__func__'`
* `44     AttributeError: 'dict' object has no attribute 'iteritems'`
* `40     KeyError: ((0, False), ())`
* `39     IndexError: tuple index out of range`

Of course, from this experiment there's often no easy way to see what the context is to these errors, an some of them might just occur hundreds of times in one module and not have a wide-reaching effect.  But it's worth looking into.  Grepping the test log for individual error messages helps give a better idea of where they might come from.

Another potentially interesting heuristic, though I haven't tested how effective this is yet is something like:

```
$ grep 'doctest.*failed' logs/ptest.log | sort -k 5 -nr | head -20
```

showing me the modules with the most failures.

On my latest python3 branch (which has all the currently open python3 tickets merged in, as well as some other fixes) I have:

```
sage -t src/sage/misc/explain_pickle.py  # 71 doctests failed
sage -t src/sage/calculus/riemann.pyx  # 67 doctests failed
sage -t src/sage/libs/lcalc/lcalc_Lfunction.pyx  # 58 doctests failed

sage -t src/sage/combinat/finite_state_machine.py  # 32 doctests failed
sage -t src/sage/rings/polynomial/real_roots.pyx  # 29 doctests failed
sage -t src/sage/coding/source_coding/huffman.py  # 26 doctests failed
sage -t src/sage/combinat/diagram_algebras.py  # 25 doctests failed
sage -t src/sage/matroids/matroid.pyx  # 23 doctests failed
sage -t src/sage/combinat/rigged_configurations/kr_tableaux.py  # 23 doctests failed
sage -t src/sage/combinat/cluster_algebra_quiver/cluster_seed.py  # 22 doctests failed
sage -t src/sage/graphs/graph.py  # 20 doctests failed
```

With the exception of "explain_pickle" which is kind of a special case (and one I'm not sure what to do with), my guess is that modules with many failing tests indicate something that is deeply broken enough which, if fixed, might have far reaching consequences both within that module itself, and other modules that depend on it. 

Of course this isn't always going to be the case--sometimes the failures might be very localized.  But this gives some idea of where the most effort is needed.

But I am guessing that it is not seen in vanilla sage because I apply the following patch

vanilla never shows the problem because it uses `GAP_ROOT_DIR`, which I find an hindrance as it presuppose a way of installing `gap`, the alternate code that comes after works well enough - at least with python2. But obviously not with python3.

Any suggestions on fixing this?

What are we going to do with animation support on Python 3?
It seems it is broken - the only (non-console, not sure about console though) possibility seems to be via jupyter+j(s)mol, and this
has not moved far: https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/1872

See also the recent where people complain about broken animation on 8.9.

yes, the sage-devel thread discusses mostly sagenb, but the question is how to do the job in jupyter instead, and this appears to be a blocker, as this is a serious regression.

Disclaimer: I do not know how to do animations in Sage. If someone who knows looked into this, it would be great.
