```
jq = j_invariant_qexp(10) 
jqsub = jq.substitute(q = e^(-2*pi))
```
This used to work (Sage 4.8).  It ought to return an approximation to 1728 (this is useful behaviour...). E.g.

```
n(jqsub)

1727.99999999999
```
But now it raises...

```
ValueError: Can only substitute elements of positive valuation
```

The change was made in #3979.  Until Sage 5.4, substitution into power series was incorrectly implemented in many ways.  In particular, it was possible to substitute a non-zero scalar into a series only specified up to a given precision, but this cannot make sense. 

In your case, 

```
sage: jq = j_invariant_qexp(10)
sage: jq.truncate(10)(exp(-2*pi)).n(100)
1727.9999999999882175423506871
```
gives the answer you want.  But its meaning depends on assuming (correctly) that the infinitely many unspecified terms can be ignored (to within 10<sup>-10</sup>).  

In general, writing, say,

```
f = x + x^2 + O(x^3)
```
tells us nothing about how `f(2)` should be defined, or whether `6` might be a reasonable approximation.

Thanks, that clears things up for me.  Probably I should have gone to the discussion list before opening a ticket (if so, I apologize).  But before we close the ticket, can we clarify what way the user should accomplish the intended calculation?  How can one approximate the j-invariant for various tau in the upper half plane?  This is something Sage ought to allow someone to do, in some fashion, so if isn't possible, then maybe this ticket should be changed to a requested feature.  But if this discussion ought to be carried out elsewhere (like ask.sagemath.org), please let me know.

For numerical computations, `elliptic_j` will do:

```
sage: elliptic_j(I)
1728.00000000000
```
and the precision can be increased as in

```
sage: elliptic_j(sqrt(-1).n(128))
1728.0000000000000000000000000000000000
```
or

```
sage: tau = (1 + sqrt(-163))/2
sage: elliptic_j(tau.n(100))
-2.6253741264076799999999999999e17 + 1.3012822400356849057448214481e-12*I
sage: (-elliptic_j(tau.n(100)).real().round())^(1/3)
640320
```

The request is of course a reasonable one. Sometimes all you have is a finite approximation, and evaluating that will be the best you'll get. The trick is to get rid of the `O(..)` term, which you can do with `truncate`:

```
sage: jq = j_invariant_qexp(10)
sage: jq.truncate(100)(e^(-2*pi)).n()
1727.99999999999
```
