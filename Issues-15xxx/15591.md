```
sage: T = TropicalSemiring(QQ)
sage: sum([T(1), T(1), T(2)])
0
sage: T.sum([T(1), T(1), T(2)])
1
```
I'm not sure if this is caused by #15163 and I don't have time to check :/

Could you write that BIG WARNING MESSAGE along with a warning to not trust existing code unless it has been checked for tropical safety? (There's also the ``TT(0)`` and ``TT(1)`` issue.) Thanks a lot.
