A few places in Sage have `except` clauses like

```
except ValueError, TypeError:
```
but this is interpreted by Python as

```
except ValueError as TypeError:
```
while it should be

```
except (ValueError, TypeError):
```

Is it clear in cases like this:

```
5181	 	                    except AttributeError, TypeError:
```
that the `TypeError` never occurs?

I thought about this but I couldn't see any way how `alpha.galois_conjugates(QQbar)` could produce a `TypeError`. Note that

```
except AttributeError, TypeError:
```
and

```
except AttributeError:
```
really do the same thing, so I'm not changing the functionality of this line of code.
