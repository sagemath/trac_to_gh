A few places in Sage have `except` clauses like

```
except ValueError, TypeError:
```
but this is interpreted by Python as

```
except ValueError as TypeError:
```
while it should be

```
except (ValueError, TypeError):
```

Is it clear in cases like this:

```
5181	 	                    except AttributeError, TypeError:
```
that the `TypeError` never occurs?

I thought about this but I couldn't see any way how `alpha.galois_conjugates(QQbar)` could produce a `TypeError`. Note that

```
except AttributeError, TypeError:
```
and

```
except AttributeError:
```
really do the same thing, so I'm not changing the functionality of this line of code.

It is true that the code is functionally unchanged. But the way it is written makes me think that the original author intended to catch both `AttributeError` and `TypeError`. This clearly won't be caught in doctests since it has probably never been doctested when, if at all, `TypeError` is caught.

Anyway, it has been over two years since the code is present and no one has complained. So, a positive review then. :)
