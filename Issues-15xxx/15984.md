This fixer changes code like `type(x) == T)` and `while 1:` and it introduces the `sorted()` function where appropriate.

These changes are optional, but they improve style and may provide a small performance gain.

Changes according to `lib2to3/fixes/fix_idioms.py`:

```
* Change some type comparisons to isinstance() calls:
    type(x) == T -> isinstance(x, T)
    type(x) is T -> isinstance(x, T)
    type(x) != T -> not isinstance(x, T)
    type(x) is not T -> not isinstance(x, T)

* Change "while 1:" into "while True:".

* Change both
    v = list(EXPR)
    v.sort()
    foo(v)

and the more general
    v = EXPR
    v.sort()
    foo(v)

into
    v = sorted(EXPR)
    foo(v)
```

There are 151 modules (py and pyx combined) which have at least one of `== None` or `!= None`. 


The change makes sense as (by far) most modules use `is None` or `is not None`.

But as this change is already pretty large I would prefer to see this change in a separate ticket/branch.

I generated 151 patched py and pyx files. 3 pyx files gave doctest failures. And I got merge conflicts with this branch.

Therefor I set this ticket to "positive review" (as suggested above).

I will open a separate ticket for `== None` and generate fresh patches when this ticket is merged in a beta or release.
