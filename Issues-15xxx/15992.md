2to3 changed 4 affected .py modules.

I have not found a way to identify the relevant backtick usages (too many backticks in comments and doc-test):
* .pyx modules may be affected. But cython is said to be Python 3 enabled, so that should be no problem.
* If there backticks in doc-tests they will be found during tests in a Python 3 environment.
