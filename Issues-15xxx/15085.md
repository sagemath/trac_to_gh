Hey Frederic,

I'm reworking the implementation a bit to get some improvements. Quick (stupid) question before finishing my review however, the resulting coordinates are suppose to lie in a tropical space, correct? If so, I want to change it so that the result is a list of elements in `TropicalSemiring` and computations are done in there as well. Edit: also, your patch will need a proper commit message.

Best,

Travis

Hello Travis,

thanks for working on that

Well, the result is just a list of elements in ZZ (mathematically)

We can either put them in ZZ or in the tropical version of ZZ, if you prefer. The main point should be speed, in my humble opinion.

I did all of the computations as `int`'s and returned the result in the tropical ZZ in my review patch. Here are the timings with various options:

With my review patch:

```
sage: B = BraidGroup(3)
sage: b = B([-2, -2, -1, -1, 2, 2, 1, 1])
sage: %timeit b.tropical_coordinates()
1000 loops, best of 3: 151 us per loop
sage: %timeit b.tropical_coordinates()
1000 loops, best of 3: 138 us per loop
```
Before my review patch:

```
sage: %timeit b.tropical_coordinates()
1000 loops, best of 3: 160 us per loop
sage: %timeit b.tropical_coordinates()
1000 loops, best of 3: 174 us per loop
```
With review patch but not converting to (tropical) ZZ, instead leaving them as `int`'s:

```
sage: %timeit b.tropical_coordinates()
10000 loops, best of 3: 81.1 us per loop
sage: %timeit b.tropical_coordinates()
1000 loops, best of 3: 80.4 us per loop
```
With review patch but converting them into honest ZZ elements:

```
sage: %timeit b.tropical_coordinates()
1000 loops, best of 3: 98.9 us per loop
sage: %timeit b.tropical_coordinates()
10000 loops, best of 3: 107 us per loop
```

Personally I prefer to have them in tropical ZZ since that is what the function name indicates, but I don't have a strong opinion on this, so it's whatever you choose.

Hello,

thanks for the review. Everything looks good to me. You can set a positive review if you want to.

One minor point (that maybe you can correct) is that it is better not to put whitespace before or after a parenthesis, as this is not recommended by the pep8 standard.

Frédéric
