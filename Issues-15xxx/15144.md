**Issues with code:**

1. The is_arithmetic function is broken:

```
sage: S = BinaryRecurrenceSequence(1,1,1,2)
sage: S.is_arithmetic()
True
sage: [S(i) for i in xrange(10)]
[1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
```

2. There is some issue with the caching in the period function:

```
sage: S = BinaryRecurrenceSequence(2, -1)
sage: S.period(9)
9
sage: S.period(3)
1
sage: S = BinaryRecurrenceSequence(2, -1) # but re-initialize to clear cache, and we get the right answer...
sage: S.period(3)
3
```

3. The pthpowers function performs sub-optimally when Bound is small compared to p.

**Issues with documentation:**

1. References don't print in the PDF manual.

2. In the BinaryRecurrenceSequence class, order of input listed in documentation does not match order of input expected by __init__. Also, missing underscores on u0 and u1 cause funny PDF output.

3. In is_degenerate, the documentation claims u_n = au_{n-1} - bu_{n+1}, which is wrong. Also, please insert a comment saying what aa and bb are; and also a remark that \alpha, \beta are (b \pm A)/2. Again, missing underscores on u0 and u1 cause funny PDF output.

4. In is_geometric, the documentation says u_n = a * u_{n-1} or u_n = b * u_{n-2}, but this isn't what the code checks. Also "sage: S = BinaryRecurrenceSequence(2,0,1,2)" is written twice.

5. In is_quasigeometric, there are missing backslashes before alpha and beta. Also, throughout the file, quasigeomtric is sometimes spelled quadigeomtric.

6. In period function, there is only one - after ``m`` in INPUT section, which causes funny output in PDF documentation. Also, there needs to be a note that the answer is cached (c.f. above issue with code).

6. In pthpowers function, "check" should be "checked", and "U_n" should be "u_n". Also, comments claim the code continues after 5 rounds of increasing modulus, but the code checks if it increased 7 times?

7. _is_p_power_mod function: e confused with 3 in 3rd comment.

Fixed all issues, except the first documentation issue (which isn't actually an issue; you must have not built the pdf correctly).

Looks good now:

1. All issues raised above have been fixed satisfactorily. In particular:


```
sage: S = BinaryRecurrenceSequence(1,1,1,2)
sage: S.is_arithmetic()
False
```


```
sage: S = BinaryRecurrenceSequence(2, -1)
sage: S.period(9)
9
sage: S.period(3)
3
```

2. Doctests pass, with full coverage.

3. PDF and HTML reference manuals build fine.
