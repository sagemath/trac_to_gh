```
find . -iname "*.py*" | while read l; do sed -i -e '{N;N; s/\([^:]\): *\(\n *\n *sage:\)/\1::\2/}' "$l"; done

Do you have conflicts when you apply your branch ? That would be weird, for I don't have any. Do you run "git pull" or "git fetch" ? I just fetch it, then do a checkout.

I am not sure I am able to do that (got lost in whether to merge or not, which way to merge, and so on). And I have nobody nearby to explain that to me.

Is it correct to
* checkout to the branch u/chapoton/trac15065 
* git merge develop
* solve the conflicts and commit
* push the result here to replace u/chapoton/trac15065 

I have done that, but I prefer to ask before I push.
