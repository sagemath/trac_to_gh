Hellooooooo Frederic ! What would you think of running the following line in Sage's folder ? It does what you did, for all files it finds `:-P`

```
find . -iname "*.py*" | while read l; do sed -i -e '{N;N; s/\([^:]\): *\(\n *\n *sage:\)/\1::\2/}' "$l"; done

Building the doc, however, is veeeeeeery noisy as you said, but I am not very worried about that. I guess it's just the usual Sphinx screams, happening whenever some files are removed or added. Either way I don't think that your branch causes it. As per the red branch name, I'm not sure that it is our fault either. It's not like the git workflow has been used for a very long time, soo... I guess we should just review this ticket as if nothing happened, even though we may have to rebase it later on. \n\nDo you have conflicts when you apply your branch ? That would be weird, for I don't have any. Do you run \"git pull\" or \"git fetch\" ? I just fetch it, then do a checkout.\n\nNathann",

Helloooooooooooo !!

Well, I just applied your updated branch on my git version of Sage and there was nothing I could complain about. Building the doc, however, is veeeeeeery noisy as you said, but I am not very worried about that. I guess it's just the usual Sphinx screams, happening whenever some files are removed or added. Either way I don't think that your branch causes it. As per the red branch name, I'm not sure that it is our fault either. It's not like the git workflow has been used for a very long time, soo... I guess we should just review this ticket as if nothing happened, even though we may have to rebase it later on. 

Do you have conflicts when you apply your branch ? That would be weird, for I don't have any. Do you run "git pull" or "git fetch" ? I just fetch it, then do a checkout.

I am not sure I am able to do that (got lost in whether to merge or not, which way to merge, and so on). And I have nobody nearby to explain that to me.

Is it correct to
* checkout to the branch u/chapoton/trac15065 
* git merge develop
* solve the conflicts and commit
* push the result here to replace u/chapoton/trac15065 

I have done that, but I prefer to ask before I push.
