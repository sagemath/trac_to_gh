```
PPL 1.0 uses some libm long double functions (floorl, frexpl) as soon as it detects the long double type is available and looks functional.
Unfortunately the Cygwin's libm does not provide such function, and we do not build Cephes on Cygwin.

The easy solution is to use plain double precision in place of the extended ones (with a std:: prefix, as PPL also defines its own floor function).
This is what is implemented in 1.1.pre* releases of ppl available at http://bugseng.com/products/ppl/download/ftp/snapshots/.

There was a similar report archived at http://www.cs.unipr.it/pipermail/ppl-devel/2012-September/018538.html.

A straight update to ppl-1.1pre9 solves the issue.
(I've not run any of the PPL or Sage testsuites yet.)

Would it make sense to update to such a release?
Or should we backport the needed patches?
I have no idea how stable the PPL prereleases are.
Maybe Volker who is the spkg maintainer according to SPKG.txt has a better idea of the stability of such releases?

As you can see in the ticket description, it is a public release, available at http://bugseng.com/external/ppl/download/ftp/

Note though that it seems only one "snapshot" is available at a given time, so when a new one is released, the previous one will disapppear.
And it does not seem trivial to get the right commit from the PPL git server (no recent branches or tags), though it seems that for some time the (pre)release version are "tagged" with a "Version number bumped" commit message, e.g. http://www.cs.unipr.it/git/gitweb.cgi?p=ppl/ppl.git;a=commit;h=f1487c86784d0b54d566502957b8ae5993bf32b8

That should do the trick from what I saw in the build system files ...
