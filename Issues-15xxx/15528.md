This patch adds a class for rewriting systems for finitely presented groups. Rewriting systems can be used (when the Knuth-Bendix algorithms finishes in finite time) to get reduced forms of the elements of the group, the same way that groebner basis can be used to get normal forms of elements of polynomial rings modulo ideals.

This class is just a wrapper of corresponding GAP functions.

Examples:

```
sage: F.<a,b> = FreeGroup()
sage: G=F / [a*b/a/b]
sage: k = G.rewriting_system()
sage: k
Knuth Bendix Rewriting System for Monoid( [ a, A, b, B ], ... ) with
rules
[ [ a*A, <identity ...> ], [ A*a, <identity ...> ], [ b*B,
<identity ...> ], [ B*b, <identity ...> ], [ a*b*A*B,
<identity ...> ] ]
sage: k.reduce(a*b*a*b)
(a*b)^2
sage: k.make_confluent()
sage: k
Knuth Bendix Rewriting System for Monoid( [ a, A, b, B ], ... ) with
rules
[ [ a*A, <identity ...> ], [ A*a, <identity ...> ], [ b*B,
<identity ...> ], [ B*b, <identity ...> ], [ B*A, A*B ], [
b*A, A*b ], [ B*a, a*B ], [ b*a, a*b ] ]
sage: k.reduce(a*b*a*b)
a^2*b^2
```
