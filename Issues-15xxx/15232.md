Polynomial rings whose elements are not extension classes currently don't pass the TestSuite:

```
sage: K.<x> = FunctionField(QQ)
sage: R.<y> = K[]
sage: TestSuite(R).run()
  Failure in _test_category:
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "/dev/shm/sage/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/misc/sage_unittest.py", line 282, in run
      test_method(tester = tester)
    File "element.pyx", line 511, in sage.structure.element.Element._test_category (sage/structure/element.c:5084)
    File "/dev/shm/sage/local/lib/python/unittest/case.py", line 424, in assertTrue
      raise self.failureException(msg)
  AssertionError: False is not true
  ------------------------------------------------------------
  The following tests failed: _test_category
Failure in _test_elements
The following tests failed: _test_elements
```

The problem is that polynomials do not use `element_class` to construct their elements but a `_polyonmial_class` which does not use the `ElementMethods` of the category.
