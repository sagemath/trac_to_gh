As promised on #15278, this ticket adds an 'immutable' keyword to the constructors of `Graph/Digraph`, and in 'copy()' too.

While I was at it, I tried to clean a bit the 'copy()' method, which now systematically checks its input. It should deal with every situation `:-P`

And I think I will have to clean the constructors of `Graph/Digraph` too at some point.

Argggggg `T_T`

Well right now I'm trying to read a spanish book (even though I don't speak a word of it)... At least I don't put their weird reversed question marks in the code `:-PPP`

Yepyepyep, sounds right.

```diff
     If the ``data_structure`` is equal to ``"static_sparse"``, then an
     immutable graph results. Note that this does not use the NetworkX data
     structure::
 
-          sage: G_imm = Graph(g, data_structure="static_sparse")

           sage: G_imm == H_imm == G == H

Hence, the text is about data_structure, but you remove it from the test.
