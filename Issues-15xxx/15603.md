As promised on #15278, this ticket adds an 'immutable' keyword to the constructors of `Graph/Digraph`, and in 'copy()' too.

While I was at it, I tried to clean a bit the 'copy()' method, which now systematically checks its input. It should deal with every situation `:-P`

And I think I will have to clean the constructors of `Graph/Digraph` too at some point.

The commit looks good, except for the spaces in front of colons and question marks... Do you add this space in your smileys, too? ` :- ?` ` ; -)`

I think we agreed that we'll use a *new* ticket to fix sage.combinat's hack with `_immutable=True` and our counter-hack with type-checking immutability. Of course, I first want to see if the tests pass before giving a positive review.

Argggggg `T_T`

```diff
     If the ``data_structure`` is equal to ``"static_sparse"``, then an

Hence, the text is about data_structure, but you remove it from the test.
