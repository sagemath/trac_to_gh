As promised on #15278, this ticket adds an 'immutable' keyword to the constructors of `Graph/Digraph`, and in 'copy()' too.

While I was at it, I tried to clean a bit the 'copy()' method, which now systematically checks its input. It should deal with every situation `:-P`

And I think I will have to clean the constructors of `Graph/Digraph` too at some point.
