As promised on #15278, this ticket adds an 'immutable' keyword to the constructors of `Graph/Digraph`, and in 'copy()' too.

While I was at it, I tried to clean a bit the 'copy()' method, which now systematically checks its input. It should deal with every situation `:-P`

And I think I will have to clean the constructors of `Graph/Digraph` too at some point.

Things that need to be done (in a review commit): In some place you explain the `immutable=...` optional argument, but in the example you use `data_structure=...` only. In some other place, you do this change:

```diff
     If the ``data_structure`` is equal to ``"static_sparse"``, then an
     immutable graph results. Note that this does not use the NetworkX data
     structure::
 
-          sage: G_imm = Graph(g, data_structure="static_sparse")

           sage: G_imm == H_imm == G == H
           True

Hence, the text is about data_structure, but you remove it from the test.
