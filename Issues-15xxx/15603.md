As promised on #15278, this ticket adds an 'immutable' keyword to the constructors of `Graph/Digraph`, and in 'copy()' too.

While I was at it, I tried to clean a bit the 'copy()' method, which now systematically checks its input. It should deal with every situation `:-P`

And I think I will have to clean the constructors of `Graph/Digraph` too at some point.

Things that need to be done (in a review commit): In some place you explain the `immutable=...` optional argument, but in the example you use `data_structure=...` only. In some other place, you do this change:

```diff
     If the ``data_structure`` is equal to ``"static_sparse"``, then an

     structure::

           sage: G_imm == H_imm == G == H

Hence, the text is about data_structure, but you remove it from the test.
