This code is a veeeery lazy implementation of a very lazy algorithm to compute the treewidth of a graph. It can be greatly improved in at least two places.

If it is to be improved later, this implementation will probably remain useful anyway, as we try to always keep many of them alive, just to check whether they all return sound results. Hence it's not so bad if it is a bit wasteful `:-P`

And well. It's great to have this, too `:-P`

Hello,

Since I have not yet started to use git (yes, I'm lazy too), it will take some time before I will be able to review this patch.

However, I have a first remark: you should not add the function to graph.py, but to some treewidth.py or treewidth.pyx file into the `graph_decompositions` directory. This is just to gather methods.

David.

Hello,

After a really long time, I finally have some time to review patchs.

I have successfully rebased this patch with current develop version (6.3.beta8), compiled and executed the code. I have not yet tried to build the documentation.

I have a few remarks:
1. The description of outputs is incomplete. A call to `G.treewidth()` returns the treewidth.
2. You should add examples/tests such as:

```
sage: graphs.PetersenGraph().treewidth(k=2)
False
sage: graphs.PetersenGraph().treewidth(k=6)
True

sage: graphs.Grid2DGraph(2,5).treewidth()
2
sage: graphs.Grid2DGraph(3,5).treewidth()
3
sage: graphs.PetersenGraph().treewidth(certificate=True).is_tree()
True

sage: graphs.PetersenGraph().treewidth(k=3,certificate=True)
False
sage: graphs.PetersenGraph().treewidth(k=4,certificate=True)
Graph on 7 vertices
```


3. It could be useful to add simple tests such as `if G.is_tree(): return 1` or `if G.is_clique(): return G.order()-1`. 


4. How can I double check the results?? The results are correct for all the graphs I have tried and for which I know the treewidth. This could of course be done later, e.g., when a tree_decomposition module will be created with alternative methods. 

5. Typos:
- tree-decompostion itself -> tree-decomposition itself

Wow ! I am glad to see something happen on this ticket. I even forgot it was in `needs_review`... `:-P`

Right. Fixed.

This I did not do for two reasons:

1) In order to deal with a specific kind of input graph you do not only need to know the treewidth but also to input a decomposition directly in the code, in case the user asks for the treedecomposition itself. It is not complicated to do in those cases indeed, but it means adding a lot of lines for easy cases. I don't mind particularly, but it makes it less appealing, and there is also 2)

2) Somehow those two cases are partially handled already, as when `k=None` the implementation uses the max clique as a lower bound on the treewidth. So its first guess on the treewidth of these two instances is already right, and it will not waste so much time on this input.

Tell me what you think !

> 4. How can I double check the results?? The results are correct for all the graphs I have tried and for which I know the treewidth. This could of course be done later, e.g., when a tree_decomposition module will be created with alternative methods. 

Ahahahah. Well, yes, I guess that the only way to check the output for harder instances is to read the code 1000 times, and to try to add more implementations. There is so much litterature about treewidth problem that we must have several algorithms to compute it !

> - tree-decompostion itself -> tree-decomposition itself

Done.

Thanks for your work on that !
