### Modules needing work
Based on some grepping results, the following modules appear to contain a class that implements `__div__` but not `__truediv__` (the latter should be preferred in all cases):

The new semantics can be enabled in Python 2 with <code>from \`__future__\` import division</code>.

This will require checking where to replace `/` by `//`

Changes according to `libfuturize/fixes/division.py`:

```
Add
from __future__ import division
```

This ticket is tracked as a dependency of meta-ticket ticket:15980.

To test what remains to be done, one can use:

```
export PYTHONIOENCODING="utf-8"
source ./local/bin/sage-env
python -Qnew ./local/bin/sage-runtests --all
```

The first attempt went like this: `futurize -w -f division src/`.

This added <code>from \`__future__\` import division</code> to 411 py modules. 

Running the doctests `./sage -t -p --all` gave billions of lines of doctest failures ... - I had to cancel the run. 

But this result should not have come as a surprise because I had not fixed anything yet ...

The task is to identify those `/` and `/=` that operate solely on ints and longs and then change them to `//` and `//=`.

The Python source distribution has a script `Tools/scripts/finddiv.py` which has identified similar 416 py modules as the above programs (it performs clearly better as a simple grep since it tokenizes the code). It also outputs those 2625 lines that contain the / and /= operators - but for **all** types of operands (the analysis is purely syntactical).

There is another script `Tools/scripts/fixdiv.py` that uses the output of 

`python -Qwarnall yourscripts 2>the-warnings` to create a simple (commented) patch file for those division operators that only deal with ints and longs. This is possible since it uses the type information obtained by running the Python programs. 
This should be much more useful!

But currently I am stuck:
* I don't know how to pass the option `-Qwarnall` to the Python interpreter when running the doctests
* and the warning output screws up the doctests.
It may be possible to use the `warnings` module to write the warnings to a file instead if stderr (by replacing `warnings.showwarning()` with a custom function).

I finally manage to run the doctests with the Python command line option `-3`. This is how I did it:

```

Hi Wilfried,
in #16371 I changed some `/` to `//`, maybe you can review it.

BTW: how you got the summary of `stdout` and `stderr`?

Replying to [wluebbe](#comment%3A1):
> But currently I am stuck:
> * I don't know how to pass the option `-Qwarnall` to the Python interpreter when running the doctests


Could you try the following:

From a terminal, run `sage -sh`

From this shell, run:

```
export PYTHONIOENCODING="utf-8"
python -Qwarnall $(which sage-runtests) <options>
```

Where `<options>` is something like `--all --long` (depending on the options you are using for doctesting) ?
