<a id='comment:1'></a>Hey Amri,

Here's my initial work, but something isn't correct. I think what's going wrong is when I'm trying to do the log portion... I'm still looking into it.

Best,

Travis

<a id='comment:11'></a>I have made a new branch at `u/chapoton/15187` where I try to use the correct formulas.

But I think that the naive approach is doomed to fail, as we probably need to compute
inside the tensor product of r copies of `Sym`.
