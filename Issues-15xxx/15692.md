```
In #15278, the hash of graphs was turned into a `@cached_method`. If a cached method is pickled, then the cached value is pickled as well. In the case of a hash value, this is not always what we want, since the hash value might depend on the memory address of an object, or worse: The hash function might change in future implementations.

That's to say: If you save object O now, together with hash value 123, and later load it, then hash(O) will still be 123, even if a newly constructed object P with O==P might have hash(P)==456, because of a change in the hash function.

This obviously is a problem. There is something called `sage.misc.cachefunc.ClearCacheOnPickle`, but I don't know if this would really help in this case. Also, this would clear *all* cache values at once. Also, I don't know if it works for cached methods that do not take arguments (beside `self`).

I suggest that we should instead have an optional parameter for `sage.misc.cachefunc.CachedMethodCallerNoArgs` that determines whether or not the cached value is preserved, and use it on graphs (and future applications of cached method on `__hash__`).

Depends on #16337

In #15149 it was proposed that caches should be 'opt-in and not opt-out' ([#15149 comment:6](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/15149#comment:6)). Imho most caches are not used for things that are horribly expensive to compute, they are just too expensive to be computed again all the time.

Would somebody mind if I implemented it that way, i.e., the default for a cache would be that it is not pickled?

Hello,


In `_cached_function_unpickle` instead of 

```
for k,v in cache:
    ret.cache[k] = v
```
you can simply do `ret.cache.update(cache)`. Moreover, in that function you should document the argument `cache`.

I think that disabling the cache by default on pickle is a good improvement. However, the class `ClearCacheOnPickle` that you remove in your branch had several purposes: clear the cache on pickle but also on copy. Your version keep the cache on copy and that might not be appropriate for classes that used `ClearCacheOnPickle`.

Trying to implement this, I realized that the point of the `ClearCacheOnPickle` on these classes was certainly not to clear *all* caches on copy.
Also, `ClearCacheOnPickle` is broken, since it replaces any cache dictionary with an actual `dict` , i.e., it would  replace a weak dictionary with a regular one.)

I guess there was in each case some cached method which should not be pickled (or probably copied.)
So it is probably better to look at the actual occurences and fix the copying there instead of just hacking a "drop some caches" `__copy__` method which probably does too much and might even break if we change the cached methods next time around.

The classes which carry `ClearCacheOnPickle` are:
* `ToricVariety_field` where it was added in `0be2c23d` with the comment "Do not pickle caches of toric varieties". So it could be alright if we still copied them.
* `WeilGroup_gens` where it was added when the class did not provide the functionality to clear caches on copy. So it might be alright to copy them.
* `AmbientSpace` and `RootSpace` where it is not clear why it was added exactly. Maybe Nicolas could clarify this (author of the commit which added it.)

Btw. the lengthy discussion in #11115 (this is where the clear caches on copy was introduced) does not make any mention of "copy".
