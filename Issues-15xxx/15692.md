# Issue 15692: Value of cached methods should not always be pickled

In #15278, the hash of graphs was turned into a ``@`cached_method`. If a cached method is pickled, then the cached value is pickled as well. In the case of a hash value, this is not always what we want, since the hash value might depend on the memory address of an object, or worse: The hash function might change in future implementations.

That's to say: If you save object O now, together with hash value 123, and later load it, then hash(O) will still be 123, even if a newly constructed object P with O==P might have hash(P)==456, because of a change in the hash function.

This obviously is a problem. There is something called `sage.misc.cachefunc.ClearCacheOnPickle`, but I don't know if this would really help in this case. Also, this would clear *all* cache values at once. Also, I don't know if it works for cached methods that do not take arguments (beside `self`).

I suggest that we should instead have an optional parameter for `sage.misc.cachefunc.CachedMethodCallerNoArgs` that determines whether or not the cached value is preserved, and use it on graphs (and future applications of cached method on `__hash__`).

<a id='comment:16'></a>Hello,


In `_cached_function_unpickle` instead of 

```
for k,v in cache:
    ret.cache[k] = v
```
you can simply do `ret.cache.update(cache)`. Moreover, in that function you should document the argument `cache`.

I think that disabling the cache by default on pickle is a good improvement. However, the class `ClearCacheOnPickle` that you remove in your branch had several purposes: clear the cache on pickle but also on copy. Your version keep the cache on copy and that might not be appropriate for classes that used `ClearCacheOnPickle`.

I guess not. And if you really want to, it is always possible to fill the cache manually.

(I'm pretty sure that `__getstate__` should call its super unless one really knows what one is doing. A bigger problem is that `__getstate__` is only a convention that the standard `__reduce__` uses. I'm sure there are classes that implement their own `__reduce__` far below the point where you'd be thinking of injecting your `__getstate__`)

On #15207 there is some discussion of some possible infrastructure for managing these things. Perhaps it's relevant for your case?

>I could also implement `__copy__` there which is muss less likely to be overwritten but still the problem is the same.


I would recommend leaving `__copy__` out of it. That has nothing to do with the pickling/serialization protocol. It provides a "cheap" way of replicating a mutable structure (note that for immutable structures, `__copy__` routinely returns `self`, because immutability implies) so that mutations of one do not affect the other.

Mutable structures need to take care that they invalidate caches already (when mutated). I would say that a default behaviour where `copy` creates a new object with the same caches would be appropriate. The default behaviour of "copy" is to copy the instance dict, which largely establishes this.

If this is not appropriate behaviour, it seems to me that the class has rather special needs and hence should provide its own `__copy__`.

**EDIT:** I see that `ClearCacheOnPickle` gets its `copy` behaviour because under certain circumstances, `copy(...)` will revert to calling `__getstate__`. So I would expect that this would continue to be the case.  Since the "clear cache on copy" is a bit of a side-effect of the implementation of `ClearCacheOnPickle` I would try and see if just changing the copy behaviour gives acceptable results. If not then providing a custom `__copy__` on just the class that originally inherited from `ClearCacheOnPickle` would do the trick.

<a id='comment:25'></a>Trying to implement this, I realized that the point of the `ClearCacheOnPickle` on these classes was certainly not to clear *all* caches on copy.
Also, `ClearCacheOnPickle` is broken, since it replaces any cache dictionary with an actual `dict` , i.e., it would  replace a weak dictionary with a regular one.)

I guess there was in each case some cached method which should not be pickled (or probably copied.)
So it is probably better to look at the actual occurences and fix the copying there instead of just hacking a "drop some caches" `__copy__` method which probably does too much and might even break if we change the cached methods next time around.

The classes which carry `ClearCacheOnPickle` are:
* `ToricVariety_field` where it was added in `0be2c23d` with the comment "Do not pickle caches of toric varieties". So it could be alright if we still copied them.
* `WeilGroup_gens` where it was added when the class did not provide the functionality to clear caches on copy. So it might be alright to copy them.
* `AmbientSpace` and `RootSpace` where it is not clear why it was added exactly. Maybe Nicolas could clarify this (author of the commit which added it.)

Btw. the lengthy discussion in #11115 (this is where the clear caches on copy was introduced) does not make any mention of "copy".
