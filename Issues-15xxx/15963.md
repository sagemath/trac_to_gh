In some circumstances, it might be desirable to prohibit merging of states
in finite state machine simplification, e.g., if there is some extra distinction between states
that is not captured in outgoing transitions. Therefore, the notion of "color" of a state
is introduced such that states of different colors are never merged.

The following behaviour is undesired (docstrings says that
colors are tuples of the colors of the constituent states,
but this is not the case and leads to problems in
Automaton.determinisation):

```
sage: A = Automaton([[0, 0, 0]], initial_states=[0])
sage: B = A.product_FiniteStateMachine(A,
....:                                  lambda t1, t2: (0, None))
sage: B.states()[0].color
[None, None]
sage: B.determinisation()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'
sage: A = Automaton([[0, 0, 0]], initial_states=[0])
sage: B = A.composition(A, algorithm='explorative')
sage: B.states()[0].color
[None, None]
sage: B.determinisation()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'
```
I pushed commits correcting this and adding two more docstrings to emphasize that colors have to be hashable in order to be able to use Automaton.determinisation.
