This got much longer than I expected it to be because there are three "classical" involution on each of NSym and QSym and each can be computed on various bases. I ended up implementing only two of the involutions (star=rho and psi), leaving out omega (which is just a rescaled antipode) for part II.

The patch also speeds up NSym's Verschiebung on certain bases, fixes some doc, moves a reference, and changes various invocations of `Composition(spam)` to `Compositions()(spam)` for speed reasons (when `spam` really is just a list). Could a `_Compositions` (akin to `_Partitions`) be of use?

Hey Darij,

Here's the patch converted to a branch, along with some additional changes of mine which should net some (perhaps small) speedups (I didn't run any benchmarks, but attribute lookup is suppose to be faster than function calls). Specifically I changed `Compositions()(spam)` to `self._basis_keys(spam)` where appropriate. If you're happy with my changes, then you can set this to positive review.

Best,

Travis

Hi Travis,

thanks a lot! I don't have git-sage running on this machine and I haven't had time to check all of your changes so far, but I can confirm that `_basis_keys` is the right way to go here. BUT please don't use `Composition([])`:

```
sage: %timeit S._basis_keys([])
100000 loops, best of 3: 6.38 us per loop
sage: %timeit Compositions()([])
100000 loops, best of 3: 9 us per loop
sage: %timeit Composition([])
100000 loops, best of 3: 11 us per loop
```
Generally, `Composition(something)` does some slow and dirty ducktyping and should be avoided whenever possible in code.
