`Poset.lt(x,y)` also wonder whether `x>y` and nobody asked it to.

Before:

```
sage: P = Posets.BooleanLattice(4)
sage: %timeit [P.le(i, j) for i in P for j in P]
1000 loops, best of 3: 847 us per loop
```
After:

```
sage: P = Posets.BooleanLattice(4)
sage: %timeit [P.le(i, j) for i in P for j in P]
1000 loops, best of 3: 1.13 ms per loop
```

There is probably something inefficient about `shortest_path` that was done better with the breadth-first iterator?

Arggggggg. Stupid me. Not only did I forget that breadth-first search was an iterator, but I somehow read the code and convinced myself that it called shortest_path somewhere, hence that I was better off calling it directly.

I will give it another look and if I can't do anything better than the current implementation (which is very likely) then I will remove this stupid change. Thanks for checking !!!
