Before:

```
sage: P = Posets.BooleanLattice(4)
sage: %timeit [P.le(i, j) for i in P for j in P]
1000 loops, best of 3: 847 us per loop
```
After:

```
sage: P = Posets.BooleanLattice(4)
sage: %timeit [P.le(i, j) for i in P for j in P]
1000 loops, best of 3: 1.13 ms per loop
```

There is probably something inefficient about `shortest_path` that was done better with the breadth-first iterator?

Sorry for that. I just updated the last commit without this stupid change. Thanks for saving my skin `:-P`

This can be made a bit more efficient later, when Posets will use static graph backend instead of the current immutable one. Not by a lot though `:-)`
