For this to go into Sage we need the permission by the following people (mentioned in the Copyrights) to distribute their contributions under GPLv2+:

* Robert Bradshaw
* Franco Saliola
* Sébastien Labbé
* Arnaud Bergeron
* Amy Glen

I added them in CC. It would be great if you could just state that you accept the license change.
