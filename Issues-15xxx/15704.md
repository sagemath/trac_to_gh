The point is that MY computations are never long because of the add/remove edge functions. I should pay more attention `T_T`

Before

```
sage: g = graphs.RandomGNP(1500,.4)
sage: edges = g.edges(labels=False)
sage: %time Graph(edges)
CPU times: user 2.50 s, sys: 0.03 s, total: 2.52 s
Wall time: 2.55 s
Graph on 1500 vertices
sage: h = Graph()
sage: %time h.add_edges(edges)
CPU times: user 4.90 s, sys: 0.02 s, total: 4.92 s
Wall time: 4.93 s
```

After

```
sage: g = graphs.RandomGNP(1500,.4)
sage: edges = g.edges(labels=False)
sage: %time Graph(edges)
CPU times: user 2.12 s, sys: 0.02 s, total: 2.14 s
Wall time: 2.16 s
Graph on 1500 vertices
sage: h = Graph()
sage: %time h.add_edges(edges)
CPU times: user 1.48 s, sys: 0.02 s, total: 1.50 s
Wall time: 1.52 s
```

I think you should have something documenting what happens with the old "bad" behavior.  I assume it raises a well-formed error that tells people exactly what to do?

Also, it's not clear from the diff whether there are now no examples of adding edges with 2-tuples, which I assume is still supported.

Yo !

Well, it raises the same error as `u,v=1`. To be honest I was afraid of adding a try/catch around the loop for the exception is a `ValueError`, and I don't it to catch a `ValueError` in `_backend.add_edge` if there is one.

```
sage: g = Graph()                
sage: g.add_edges([(0,1),(0,1,1)])
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-4-edffa551e119> in <module>()
----> 1 g.add_edges([(Integer(0),Integer(1)),(Integer(0),Integer(1),Integer(1))])

/home/ncohen/.Sage/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/graphs/generic_graph.pyc in add_edges(self, edges)
   8970         else:
   8971             self._backend.add_edge(e0[0], e0[1], None, self._directed)
-> 8972             for u,v in it:
   8973                 self._backend.add_edge(u, v, None, self._directed)
   8974 

ValueError: too many values to unpack
```

I hope it will be explicit enough for the users, and that they will notice they feed the loop with heterogeneous data.

As for testing `add_edges()` with only pairs, not only it is still supported but I think most calls to this function only feed pairs `:-P`

I added a commit.

Hi Nathann,

my branch: u/vdelecroix/15704

I simplified the `add_edges`. That way we can use the old syntax and is not much slower (as calling `len` is very cheap). What do you think?

Here they are. Your version

```
sage: g = graphs.RandomGNP(1500,.4)
sage: edges = g.edges(labels=False)
sage: h = Graph()
sage: %time h.add_edges(edges)
CPU times: user 2.21 s, sys: 32 ms, total: 2.24 s
Wall time: 2.23 s
```
mine

```
sage: g = graphs.RandomGNP(1500,.4)
sage: edges = g.edges(labels=False)
sage: h = Graph()
sage: %time h.add_edges(edges)
CPU times: user 2.48 s, sys: 32 ms, total: 2.51 s
Wall time: 2.51 s
