Add methods floor(), ceil(), trunc(), and round() to the implementation of real algebraic numbers. Also implement trunc() for rational numbers, both for consistency and to be able to use it in the code for algebraic numbers.

ORIGINAL BUG DESCRIPTION:

From google spreadsheet which no one reads `X-(`

It happens that an algebraic number minus itself `(b-b)` is not printed as 0, but something like `0.?e-18`. Usually it is not a big problem, because `b - b == 0` evaluates to `True`. But interestingly `floor(b-b)` is sometimes 0, sometimes a symbolic expression, so weird things can happen.

```
sage: a = QQbar((-1)^(1/4)).real()
sage: floor(a-a) + a

Since you do call `_rational_` early in the loop, you can be sure that you either detect critical integer or half-integer values, or there is some finite difference between the value of self and the nearest critical distance, so a finite number of added precision steps will be enough to make the decision.

I guess I should have thought two more minutes before pressing Submit. Since you do call `_rational_` early in the loop, you can be sure that you either detect critical integer or half-integer values, or there is some finite difference between the value of self and the nearest critical distance, so a finite number of added precision steps will be enough to make the decision. Now things look pretty good to me.

If you are referring to my statement in [comment:3](#comment%3A3), then let me clarify that I definitely did not review this ticket. The patch looked good to me and it worked well for me. But I am unfamiliar with the `AA` code, so I did not perform a full review.

If the patch looks ok to you, then please feel free to set it to positive review.
