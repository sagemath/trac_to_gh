Add methods floor(), ceil(), trunc(), and round() to the implementation of real algebraic numbers. Also implement trunc() for rational numbers, both for consistency and to be able to use it in the code for algebraic numbers.

ORIGINAL BUG DESCRIPTION:

From google spreadsheet which no one reads `X-(`

It happens that an algebraic number minus itself `(b-b)` is not printed as 0, but something like `0.?e-18`. Usually it is not a big problem, because `b - b == 0` evaluates to `True`. But interestingly `floor(b-b)` is sometimes 0, sometimes a symbolic expression, so weird things can happen.

```

 From google spreadsheet which no one reads `X-(`
 
 It happens that an algebraic number minus itself `(b-b)` is not printed as 0, but something like `0.?e-18`. Usually it is not a big problem, because `b - b == 0` evaluates to `True`. But interestingly `floor(b-b)` is sometimes 0, sometimes a symbolic expression, so weird things can happen.

The diff here on trac looks broken, but after merging develop my local changes look fine. The general approach looks sound. I wonder whether we should support different rounding modes, the way rational numbers do. But one can always add that in a later commit.

Had a look at the code, not sure whether I'd officially call this a review. The diff here on trac looks broken, but after merging develop my local changes look fine. The general approach looks sound.
