```
The now-current freetype library has problems with newer fonts. This forbids its uses in some applications on machines having system fonts not supported by this version.

This was diagnosed on sage's R (see [this thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-support/FnTEcpfg6wE)) by Volker Braun.

A stopgap measure is to upgrade freetype to a more forgiving version of freetype, hence this ticket.

The current freetype tarball hits a snag in libpng, because it uses setjmp for exception handling, which triggers a compiler error due to this settinng up been made twice. So a small patch to the current libpng is part of this branch.  

New tarball: http://download.savannah.gnu.org/releases/freetype/freetype-2.5.2.tar.bz2

Depends on #15539

freetype 2.5.2 installs flawlessly IFF libpng12 is patched to avoid a test for setting up error catching via setjmp in libpng12 (which freetype 2.5.2 does anyway).

The resulting sage passes make ptestlong and is able to draw a curve (from sage -R in console). So I think that this ticket is ready for review.

Since it installs a newer version of a standard package and paches another onte, I think that it should be reviewed on various system (at least Mac OS X and/or Cygwin, which seem to be the most difficult cases) before clearing it.

I have two problems with this branch :

1) I seem to be unable to get this code back on an sage tree on another machine :

```
sage -dev checkout --ticket 15561
sage -dev diff
```
gives me an empty diff...

2) I added a new freetype tarball in upstream and deleted the previous one. None of this appears in the branch, at least as displayed on the trac page.

I'll have to beg some help on sage-support...

Ahiii ! That's the snag in libpng that triggered me to patch pngconf.h. How can i check that this patch has been applied ? This error (horror ?) originates in a code section that I #defined around...

Edit, Dec 25 : I see *another* build problem with PIL and freetype. but I could diagnose it only by creating a new sage tree and git'ing !#15661 directly : adding #15561 to an already compiled tree does not force recompilation of PIL.

The problem : 

```
[ ... ]

gcc -fno-strict-aliasing -g -O2 -DNDEBUG -g -fwrapv -O3 -Wall -fPIC -I/home/charpent/sagebis/sage/local/include/freetype2 -IlibImaging -I/home/charpent/sagebis/sage/local/include -I/usr/include -I/home/charpent/sagebis/sage/local/include/python2.7 -c _imagingft.c -o build/temp.linux-x86_64-2.7/_imagingft.o
_imagingft.c:68:31: fatal error: freetype/fterrors.h: Aucun fichier ou dossier de ce type
 #include <freetype/fterrors.h>
                               ^
compilation terminated.
error: command 'gcc' failed with exit status 1

[ ... ]
```
This happens twice (PIL attemps compilation with and without Tkinter support). This is caused by the fact that the directory containing freetype headers is no longer local/include/freetype but local/include/freetype2.

Since Pillow is now accepted in the next sage, my plan is :

* start a new tree
* fetch the Pillow branch (for rebase ?)
* fetch !#15561 and adjust it.

Your thoughts ?

Ouch ! Freetype depends on libpng, but libpng needs to be patched *first*, which means it can't be patched by freetype's branch, if I understand that correctly. The only way out I see is :

1. create a new branch patching libpng in a ticket #xx

If that race is actually the problem then you only have to add the dependency to `build/deps`. Then libpng will be built first (and patched as part of its build process), and then freetype will be built afterward. I think I'm missing the problem here, but in any case that should work (TM).

Okay. I did that, pushed the commit and updated status to "needs review". I'm curious about the buildbot's behaviour...

Edit, a bit later : the resulting tree passes the '(make distclean ; make )' test in an enviroment where MAKE is "make -j8". So it *can* be built in a parallel setting.
