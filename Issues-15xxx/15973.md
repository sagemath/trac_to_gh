Dima on [this sage-release thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/sage-release/6Vh55hF7UXk/cITCg5T83EkJ) gives the correct solution - to add -DHAVE_SYS_ERRLIST to the CFLAGS.

There is another problem with an unknown `-no_pie` flag as well which is passed to the linker, which on 10.4 and 10.5 is not supported - see [this Macports bug report](http://trac.macports.org/ticket/34064).

I didn't give a proper solution, I gave a hack. A proper solution would be to change `configure.in` appropriately, and/or  to run autoconf etc on OSX 10.4 to generate configure.

Same applies to `-no_pie`, I guess.

Presumably, though I have the same trouble there.   And probably running autoconf on a bunch of different machines isn't a real solution, though maybe I'm misunderstanding this.

Awesome.  

So... why is there no GAP source code browser, and no public bug report list?  RWTH can't be that protective of it...
