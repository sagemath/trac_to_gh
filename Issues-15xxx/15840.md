Hi Daniel,

Thanks for your patch!

Your code didn't work on expressions such as 1/sÂ² (with that particular variable name). I think I fixed it.

I am still not too happy about the following:

```
sage: var('s')
sage: (x^s).residue(x,0)
0
```
but it's not clear to me what the code should do in such cases.

Also, I wonder if we shouldn't prefer a syntax such as `expr.residue(x==a)` for consistency with `series()`.
