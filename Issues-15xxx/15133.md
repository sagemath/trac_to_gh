Here is a post-receive hook that updates the "Commit" field on trac. 

Installation instructions:
* copy the attached [attachment:post-receive-hook.py] to `hooks/post-receive`
* Add an action to trac to change the status from positive_review back to needs_review. In `trac.ini`:
  {{{
[ticket-workflow]
back_to_review = positive_review -> needs_review
back_to_review.name = resubmit to review
back_to_review.permissions = TICKET_MODIFY
    }}}
* Add a trac user that makes the changes, e.g. username = `git`. Put the username/password in the post-receive script in `TRAC_URL_LOGIN`.
