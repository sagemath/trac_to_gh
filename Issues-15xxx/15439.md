From `sage/combinat/matrices/latin.py`:

```
def isotopism(p):
    """
    Returns a Permutation object that represents an isotopism (for
    rows, columns or symbols of a partial latin square). Since matrices
    in Sage are indexed from 0, this function translates +1 to agree
    with the Permutation class. We also handle
    PermutationGroupElements.
[...]
                x = x * isotopism(p[i])
[...]
```
This uses the syntax `a * b` for the product of two permutations. This syntax is bad because its semantics depends on the state of a global variable (`mult` in `Permutation.global_options()`), which decides which of the factors is to be applied first when multiplying two permutations. I don't know if it matters for this particular method, but such things have been causing subtle bugs in two other places, so this should be looked at (unfortunately I don't know much about Latin squares; Nathann?). Even if the result doesn't depend on the order of multiplication, it is better to use the `_left_to_right_multiply_on_left` and `_left_to_right_multiply_on_right` methods of class `sage.combinat.permutation.Permutation` for speed reasons (they don't waste time looking up the state of that global variable).

Hellooooooooooooooo !!!!

1) I did not know what an isotopism was either, and it looks like we could add a link toward the following Wikipedia page if we patch this file : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_square#Equivalence_classes_of_Latin_squares

2) "Morally", this '*' can be any of the two actions, as it should only apply to permutations with disjoint supports : this part of the function builds a permutation from a 'cycles notation', i.e. `'(1,2,3)(4,5)'`. It builds a permutation for each cycle and multiplies the results, so both actions should be fine.

3) Morally, this part of the code is made for disjoint cycles notations, but nothing actually checks that.

4) This code has *NOTHING* to do there. Its only purpose is to accept any kind of permutation input on 0..n-1 and to output a permutation on 1..n. It's like this code should appear in the constructor of `Permutations`, with a flag `translate_from_0n_to_1n=True`

5) Having something like `Permutations.global_options` which redefines the meaning of `'*'` is ***__criminal__***. 

  a) How the hell can such a thing be implemented when there is a ticket like this one, which PROVES that some parts of Sage's code use the '*' on multiplications, and that those functions could return WRONG RESULTS when this flag is changed ? 

  b) And how can such a thing can be implemented WITHOUT MAKING SURE that no '*' can appear again on permutation code in Sage ?

Hi Nathann,

Replying to [@nathanncohen](#comment%3A1):

> 4) This code has *NOTHING* to do there. Its only purpose is to accept any kind of permutation input on 0..n-1 and to output a permutation on 1..n. It's like this code should appear in the constructor of `Permutations`, with a flag `translate_from_0n_to_1n=True`

Good point. I'm not sure if I want to add a `translate_from_0n_to_1n` variable to the `Permutation` constructor (that constructor is already quite complex, and it gets called a hell lot). But maybe we should add a function to `sage/combinat/permutation.py` which constructs a permutation from its "left shift by 1"?

> 1) I did not know what an isotopism was either, and it looks like we could add a link toward the following Wikipedia page if we patch this file : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_square#Equivalence_classes_of_Latin_squares

+1 for the link. It just doesn't have much to do with the `isotopism` method; it probably should be in the `apply_isotopism` docstring.

> 2) "Morally", this '*' can be any of the two actions, as it should only apply to permutations with disjoint supports : this part of the function builds a permutation from a 'cycles notation', i.e. `'(1,2,3)(4,5)'`. It builds a permutation for each cycle and multiplies the results, so both actions should be fine.

OK, good point -- it seems that the `isotopism` method is indeed meant to take disjoint cycles, whence the order is irrelevant. But I'm saying "seems" because to me, too, it's far from clear from the docstring. If we can confirm than this is what's meant, it should be rather easy to avoid the use of `*` and probably even gain some speed this way.

> 3) Morally, this part of the code is made for disjoint cycles notations, but nothing actually checks that.

I honestly ask the question, I personally always used permutations like function composition, and all that happens with this left/right action is beyond me `:-P`

For quite a long time I believed that everyone agreed `pq` would mean "first do `q`, then `p`", apart from maybe some 19th century British authors (who would be unreadable anyway). But it turned out that the opposite convention is still around in Britain :(

> 5) Having something like `Permutations.global_options` which redefines the meaning of `'*'` is ***__criminal__***.

The `global_options` constructor is just a new way to handle these global variables, but the global variable determining order of multiplication is not new. I guess it's nuclear waste from the olden days of Sage.

In #15174 it surfaced that with `Permutations.global_options(mult) == 'l2r'`, the Hecke algebra (a deformation of the symmetric group algebra) would have its multiplication opposite of that of the symmetric group algebra, whereas with `Permutations.global_options(mult) == 'r2l'` it would not be an algebra at all (associativity would not hold). I believe this has been around for ages. You've gotta love our codebase...

Yoooooooooooo !!

  1) We will do it some day

  2) It's a good idea but it makes existing code slower (#14019 is in this case, though wrong results are actually returned in the meantime)

  3) I have to ask XXXX, which never happens

So, well. Even though the only sensible thing would be to support at least both 0..n-1 and 1..n (why not LABELLED permutations btw ? Like PermutationGroupElement already does ?). Even though the slightly less sensible thing would be to give this up but to be able to relabel them from the constructor, I think I can't hope for anything better than having a relabeling function that I could import and use manually.

Right, right.

Oh, I'm pretty sure that this is what is meant there. Of course nothing checks it (we are in the combinat/ folder after all) but it was done in the very same way in the constructor of permutations before #13742.

Nightmares. Nightmares. Why don't we have "permutations acting on right" and "permutations acting on the left" then ? And get rid of a flag that might break dozens of functions without anybody knowing ?

<div id="comment:4" align="right">Comment 4</div>

Hello ! I tried twice to update the constructor of `Permutation` to add a `shift_input_by_one=False` flag, but each time it convinced me that it was bad work. Plus I don't think that this is the good way out -- the good way out is to have permutations on arbitrary objects.

Hence I did not touch permutation.py. Err, I just changed a few calls to `all()` to prevent them from building a long useless list of `[False, False, False, False]`. And I wrote the doc of this isotopism thing, and avoided this `*` on multiplications.

But honestly, I think you have no way to ensure that nobody will ever use this `*` in Sage code without worrying over this multiplication order.

Hmmmmmm... The git history looks rather painful indeed `:-P`

Why this "pre-empting" patch ? And I didn't know anything about meld, though git merge does the job for me at the moment... `:-P`

Do you want to torture this branch further or can we set it to `positive_review` ? `:-PPPPP`

Ahahahah. No, I don't think that there is. That's one of the big problems with git. Perhaps this will make people review patches quicker, who knows ? Perhaps they will be merged faster, too. I even wonder if we will still have releases, or if a "git pull" will do the job `:-)`

If you like the new branch, please set the ticket to `positive_review`.

Thaaaaaaaaaaaaanks !
