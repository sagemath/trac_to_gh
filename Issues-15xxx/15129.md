If we want to automatically update the "Commit" field then we have to be able to identify the ticket given the "Branch". Here is a quick trac plugin to search for "Branch", returning only exact matches. Both via webui and trac xmlrpc.

Install trac_plugin_search_branch.py​ into trac, e.g. upload via web console.

Also, it would be nice if the "Commit" field would ellipsize itself since it tends to be a long non-breakable string. We should add something like

```
	text-overflow: ellipsis;
	overflow: hidden;
```
to the `h_commit` CSS. See this ticket for an example.
