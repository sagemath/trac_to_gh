```
Currently, a core does not hash its parameter, so having a dict with the two keys

```
sage: A = Core([2],4)
sage: B = Core([2],5)
sage: hash(A) == hash(B)
True
```
fails to work.

It is a requirement that if two objects compare `==` then they must have the same hash:

```
sage: A = Core([2],4)
sage: B = Core([2],5)
sage: A == B
True
sage: hash(A) == hash(B)
False
```
So if we want different hashes, then they must not compare `==`.

Yes, Christian, please make two cores with different `k` unequal and I will set a positive review again!

Okay, the problem is that people use

```
sage: C == []
```
for a core `C` elsewhere in the code. And this cannot work out if we want to make the hash (and thus the equality) dependent on the additional parameter.

Travis (or someone else), could you take over and solve this issue how ever you think it is appropriate (including to decide that we do not want this ticket to be merged)?

Cheers, Christian
