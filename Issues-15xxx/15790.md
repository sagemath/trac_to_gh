**[Update]** Due to #13442, the purpose of this ticket changed slightly. It provides two functionalities:

1. A generic implementation for the GCD of two polynomials over a UFD;
2. A `gcd` method for sparse polynomials which allows to choose between the `generic` implementation, or using the implementation for `dense` polynomials. Default is generally `generic`, but for polynomial over `ZZ` it is `dense`. This is due to the very fast implementations available in Flint and NTL.

These implementations solve the problem mentioned in the first version of this ticket, that remains below for information.

**[Old description, not relevant anymore]**

The GCD of two sparse polynomials over `ZZ` is not computed. If the polynomials are in dense representation or if they are in sparse representation but defined over `QQ`, there is no problem.

<a id='comment:1'>**Comment 1:**</a>
For `PolynomialRing(ZZ,'x',sparse=false)`, one of FLINT or NTL is used (FLINT by default). 

For `PolynomialRing(QQ,'x',sparse=true)`, the `gcd` computation is based on `quo_rem`. This is not possible over the integer since `quo_rem` works for polynomials over a field. 

There are several possible solutions: 
1. Coerce the polynomials to `PolynomialRing(QQ,'x',sparse=true)`; compute their GCD `g`, the LCM `l` of the denominators of the coefficients of `g`, and return `l*g`.
2. Coerce the polynomials to `PolynomialRing(ZZ,'x',sparse=false)`; compute their GCD and return the result in sparse representation with a second coercion.
3. Implement a *pseudo-division* algorithm (//cf.// Cohen GTM 138 Algorithm 3.1.2) and a GCD algorithm based on the sub-resultant (//cf.// Cohen GTM 138 Algorithm 3.3.1).

Solution 3 seems cleaner but does not give especially efficient results since the algorithms described in Cohen GTM 138 have complexity polynomial in the degree of the input polynomial. Actually, computing the GCD of two sparse polynomial is NP-hard ![1] so no better solution than converting to the dense representation is likely to exist. To my mind, Solution 2 is then the best one. 

Yet, I am new to Sage so comments are welcome!

I've implemented the `gcd` method in the class `Polynomial` using the pseudo-division algorithm, as well as a method `gcd` in `Polynomial_generic_sparse` which allows to choose the algorithm between `"pseudo-division"`, `"dense"` or `"fraction_field"`. 

Needs review!

One remaining limitation is the absence of `quo_rem` method in `Polynomial_generic_sparse`. I created a specific ticket #16544 for this.

Do you have a heuristic for determining when one algorithm is faster than another (when the base ring is `ZZ`)? It doesn't have to be a particularly good one, but considering the time differences you're getting, it seems like we should have some automatic choice of algorithm.

I don't have one. Based on the comments on https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/6qhW90dgd1k, I add the possibility¹ for the "dense" algorithm to use NTL instead of FLINT. After some tests, I chose a heuristic for using NTL rather than FLINT (basically, FLINT is faster for low-degree polynomials and *not-too-sparse* ones). Then the "dense" algorithm is almost always faster than "pseudo-division" but for some very specific examples (I haven't been able to build other ones): `gcd(x<sup>N-1,x</sup>M-1)` with both `N` and `M` pretty large. An the ratio is not hundreds anymore, but approx. 10. 

¹ Actually, no choice for the user but only an automatic switch.

<a id='comment:24'>**Comment 24:**</a>
In the two latest commits, I propose the following changes:

1. Instead of having a fallback algorithm in the method `Polynomial.gcd` which tests whether the base ring in a unique factorization domain, this algorithm is moved to the category `UniqueFactorizationDomains`.
2. I simplified the method `Polynomial_generic_sparse.gcd`: There remain only two possibilities (out of three), namely the one previously called `pseudo-division` (renamed `generic`, since it uses the generic code) and the `dense` version, which may in some cases be faster, for instance over `ZZ`. I removed the `fraction_field` option which does not make much sense I think.

At the same time, I also take [Frédéric's comment](#comment%3A21) into account.
