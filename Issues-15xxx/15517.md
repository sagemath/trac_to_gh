Running `make` inside a Sage shell doesn't really work well, because `sage-env` isn't resourced during the build. This breaks upgrading if new packages are installed in the upgrade which require environment variable changes. Most of the old work-arounds in `spkg/install` removed in #14715 existed precisely for this reason.

Now that nothing can upgrade **to** Sage 6.0, we should make sure that upgrading **from** Sage 6.0 doesn't suffer this problem.
