Running `make` inside a Sage shell doesn't really work well, because `sage-env` isn't resourced during the build. This breaks upgrading if new packages are installed in the upgrade which require environment variable changes. Most of the old work-arounds in `spkg/install` removed in #14715 existed precisely for this reason.

Now that nothing can upgrade **to** Sage 6.0, we should make sure that upgrading **from** Sage 6.0 doesn't suffer this problem.

Why are you always upgrading to the current development version, unless otherwise specified? IMO this is a user feature, developers will just be using git directly, so I would argue that it should update to the latest released version by default (which is more or less what the old one was doing -- it just checked if you were on either a released tag, or the release branch).

There is no release branch yet. Has there been any decision on using (master, release) or (beta, master) or some variation of it? 

In any case, all we have to make sure NOW is that we can update 6.0 to a future version that fixes the update script...

Sure. One other thing that I just noticed before I can hand off a positive review, is using origin as the remove server name. Why not just specify the actual repository, since we have no idea where origin would point to (if anywhere)? (i.e. `$SAGE_REPO_ANONYMOUS`)

About origin, I thought about it. But if origin does not point at our repository then you must have changed it yourself after checking out Sage. The update script shouldn't try to outsmart the user.
