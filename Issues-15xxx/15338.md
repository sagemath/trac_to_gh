With the latest versions of Sage, I'm unable to build the doc in parallel because it seems that Cywgin/Windows fails to load two different dlls with the same name.

More precisely the problem occured with function.pyx both in sage/symbolic and sage/libs/singular.

Changing the name of one of this files solved the problem.

Is this still an issue? Given that @embray never mentioned this, I would guess not.
