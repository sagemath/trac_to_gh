From google spreadsheet which no one reads `X-(`

```
sage: sum(lcm(10,x), x, 1, 10)  # Incorrect
550

sage: sum([lcm(10,i) for i in xrange(1,11)])  # Correct
320
```

<div id="comment:2" align="right">comment:2</div>

Here is the problem, presumably (`lcm` not being symbolic in this way):

```
sage: lcm(10,x)
10*x
```
We can all be Gauss with this.

```
sage: sum(lcm(1,x),x,1,100)
5050
```
The solution is to make sure that `lcm(a,b)` does something symbolic, or throws an error, when we feed it symbolic entries.  Is there already a ticket for this, perhaps?
