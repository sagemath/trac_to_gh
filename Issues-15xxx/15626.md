The Abort class is a great idea and very well implemented.  It would never have occurred to me to implement the early abort this way, and it has led me to think about other situations where a similar strategy might be useful!  The examples are good.

All tests in sage/rings pass.  For some reason when I tested the whole of Sage built with this branch I got various doctest errors in sage/crypto but I cannot believe that it has anything to do with these changes, so they are not stopping me giving it a positive review.  Now I am looking forward to looking at the elliptic curve division field code!
