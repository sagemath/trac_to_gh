The following bug was causing errors in the product of Schur functions.  The bug in the product was resolved in #15397 by changing the product to use lrcalc rather than symmetrica.  The bug in symmetrica still exists.

```
sage: s = SymmetricFunctions(QQ).s()
sage: symmetrica.mult_schur_schur(s[122,1],s[2,1])
2*s[1]
sage: symmetrica.mult_schur_schur(s[123],s[2,1])
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)
...
ValueError: [0, 0, ..., 0, 122, 2, 1] is not an element of Partitions
sage: symmetrica.mult_schur_schur(s[125],s[3])

enter a to abort with core dump, g to go, f to supress
s to supress further error text, r to retry,  e to explain, else stop
ERROR: newtrans:stackoverflow?:

This is an upstream bug that no longer affects Sage (since lrcalc is now used):

https://gitlab.com/sagemath/symmetrica/issues/11

As a result, I think we can close this here. If someone knows how to fix the bug in symmetrica, please send a pull request.
