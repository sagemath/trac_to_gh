That is, allow for some syntax so that one can construct a matrix like

```
sage: matrix([[0,0,0],[1,0,0],[0,1,0]])
[0 0 0]
[1 0 0]
[0 1 0]
```
using some variant on the diagonal matrix syntax.  Apparently Matlab has this facility - see [this ask.sagemath question](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/3206/create-a-tridiagonal-matrix).
