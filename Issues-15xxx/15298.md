We have two copies upon startup:

```
sage: import gc
sage: Ks=[K for K in gc.get_objects() if
....: isinstance(K,sage.rings.number_field.number_field.NumberField_quadratic)]
sage: [latex(k.0) for k in Ks]
[i, \sqrt{-1}]
```
I suspect they are coming from
`symbolic/pynac.pyx:2046 (in init_pynac_I)`

```
    K = QuadraticField(-1, 'I', embedding=CC.gen(), latex_name='i')
```
and from `rings/qqbar.py:7699 (in _init_qqbar)`

```
    QQbar_I_nf = QuadraticField(-1, 'I', embedding=CC.gen())
```
Should we perhaps both give them the same latex name so that these can be the same field?

<a id='comment:1'></a>A preliminary test shows that changing rings/qqbar.py:7699 to

```
QQbar_I_nf = QuadraticField(-1, 'I', embedding=CC.gen(), latex_name='i')
```
works fine and ensures that there's only one field created upon startup.
Note that:

```
sage: latex(QQbar.0)
\text{\texttt{1*I}}
```
so it looks like the latex printing will not be affected by this change either.
