If you do the following:

A=AlternatingSignMatrices(3)

A.lattice().plot()

you get an error, but 

A.lattice() says it is a finite lattice with 7 elements, as it ought to be. 

The error says we need to implement the sort algorithm for AlternatingSignMatrices.

Added __le__, __ge__, __lt__, and __gt__ methods to AlternatingSignMatrix. Adding these fixed the implementation of the sort algorithm and allowed the alternating sign matrix lattice to plot.
