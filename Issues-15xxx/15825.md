This is yet another bilinear operation on the ring of symmetric functions. It governs the tensor product in Deligne's category Rep(S_t).

The branch also implements the t-completion of a partition (also related to this category) and improves (IMHO) on the method that turns partitions into Dyck paths (just because it caught my eye).
