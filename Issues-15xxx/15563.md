OK. I thought it would be more likely that `\mathbbb` is a typo for `\mathbb`, not for `\mathbf`.

You could also use `\Bold`. From the developer's guide:

```
The Sage LaTeX style is to typeset standard rings and fields like the integers 
and the real numbers using the locally-defined macro \\Bold, as in \\Bold{Z} 
for the integers.
```
Projective space isn't a standard ring or field, so this style doesn't quite apply, but it's an option.

As far as current usage in Sage:

```
sage: len(search_src('Bold{P}', interact=False).strip().split('\n'))
1
sage: len(search_src('mathbf{P}', interact=False).strip().split('\n'))
10
sage: len(search_src('mathbb{P}', interact=False).strip().split('\n'))
132
```
So `\mathbb{P}` is the most popular choice, for what that's worth.

The documentation builds fine with this branch and the one from #15562.

By the way:

```
sage: len(search_src('mathbb P', interact=False).strip().split('\n'))
1
sage: len(search_src('mathbf P', interact=False).strip().split('\n'))
7
sage: len(search_src('Bold P', interact=False).strip().split('\n'))
1
```
So, 18 bold votes against 133 blackboard votes. Should we try to generally replace `mathbf` by `mathbb` when it is about the projective line, while we are at it? Apart from this question, it is a positive review.
