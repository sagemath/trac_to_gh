Sorryyyyyyyyy `T_T`

I forgot the first (and easiest) part of this theorem : the sum of all integers must be even. There even was a "S" variable equal to this sum that wasn't even ever used in the code `T_T`

Open your sagenb notebook and on the top right you will see "Report a problem". That goes to a google form. And the bug report gets collected in [this google spreadsheet](https://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=pCwvGVwSMxTzT6E2xNdo5fA) (which no one reads).
