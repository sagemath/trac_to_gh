```
To be Python 2 compatible all affected modules need a <code>from \`__future__\` import print_function</code>.

`lib2to3/fixes/fix_import.py` does not add these !__future!__ imports.

Therefore we intend to use an enhanced fixer from `https://pypi.python.org/pypi/future/0.11.3`.

Changes according to `libfuturize/fixes/fix_print_with_import.py`:

```
Change:
    'print'          into 'print()'
    'print ...'      into 'print(...)'
    'print ... ,'    into 'print(..., end=" ")'
    'print >>x, ...' into 'print(..., file=x)'
No changes are applied if print_function is imported from __future__
-------- 
Turns any print statements into functions and adds this import line:
    from __future__ import print_function
at the top to retain compatibility with Python 2.6+.
```

This ticket is tracked as a dependency of meta-ticket ticket:15980.

<div id="comment:1" align="right">comment:1</div>

In Sage there are currently only 4 py modules with an <code>from \`__future__\` import print_function</code>.

From the [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#print):
  Note: This function <the print() function> is not normally available as a built-in since the name print is
  recognized as the print statement. To disable the statement and use the print() function, 
  use this future statement at the top of your module:
  "from !__future!__ import print_function".
  *New in version 2.6.*

There are about 50 py modules that contain uses of the print statement that look like a function call (i.e. having parenthesis). In some cases 2to3 will wrap an additional pair of parenthesis around it. But as the following snippet shows this should be neither in Py2.7 nor in Py3.3 a problem:

```
Python 2.7.5+ (default, Feb 27 2014, 19:37:08) 

>>> print "text"
text
>>> print"text"
text
>>> print("text")
text
>>> print(("text"))
text

>>> from __future__ import print_function
>>> print"text"
  File "<stdin>", line 1
    print"text"
              ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
>>> print "text"
  File "<stdin>", line 1
    print "text"
               ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
>>> print("text")
text
>>> print(("text"))
text
>>> 
```

A discussion in ticket:13255 lead to the idea to NOT include <code>from \`__future__\` import print_function</code> at the top of modules but to wrap a pair of parenthesis around the parameter(s) of the *print statement*. This should also satisfy the *print function* of Python 3.

For testing the completeness <code>from \`__future__\` import print_function</code> might be added to some module that is (almost) universally imported.

Are there any drawbacks?

This will give unexpected results with a trailing comma, or a redirected output. If either these cases appear in a file (and I'm almost positive the first does appear in the sage library), I see no way to get around importing future for these modules.

I took the following approach: 
1. Run `futurize -f print_with_import.py`.
   This changed about 200 py modules.
2. Run the doctests.
   There were failures in about 480 .py/.rst-files. The file with the failures had almost 40.000 lines.
3. I started (slowly) to fix the doctests by wrapping the print parameters in parenthesis.
But the I began to doubt whether this is the right thing to do:
* Doctests are not only about *test* but also about *documentation*!
* William Stein made a case (https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/r-85whQZGhY/72FfjeFt6Z4J) for enabling the preparser to change print statements to print functions as required.
Now I think it would better to 
* First enable the preparser to change the print statement syntax into the function syntax whenever "print" refers to '<built-in function print>' (which is the case in Py3 but also in Py2 when <code>from \`__future__\` import print_function</code> is in effect).
* Then add parenthesis to the print statements in the py modules (adding <code>from \`__future__\` import</code> is optional).
* If required (because of ">>>file" or a trailing comma) use the new function syntax with <code>from \`__future__\` import print_function</code>.
* Doctest should by changed if and when considered reasonable.

The hope was that the majority of changes would also be valid statement syntax (just an extra pair of parenthesis). See ticket:13255 for such an approach.

There were about 200 changed py modules. 


Thereof about 20 had lines with `end=" "`. Some could be eliminated with a little refactoring. 

14 modules needed `import print_function`. This lead usually 40 doctest failures as the parenthesis caused the parameters to be printed as tuples (which was not the expected output). A fix would be simple.

But in `src/sage/modular/etaproducts.py` and in `src/sage/modular/all.py` (which contained the only `file=` the `import print_function` caused 2545 doctest failures in about 500 modules!!! I still cannot explain this differing behavior.

**To long didn't read:**
I consider this experiment failed! 


If the goal is one **robust** common Python 2 / 3 code base (which I assume!) then all modules should have the <code>from \`__future__\` import print_function</code>. This would require a  preparser that can add the parenthesis in the doctests on the fly or -as a fallback- add the parenthesis to the doctest source.
