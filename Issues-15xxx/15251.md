The attached patch makes some minor changes to the Steenrod algebra code:

- changes a few docstrings and comments
- one bug fix (to make `SteenrodAlgebra(2, 'wood')` raise a more meaningful error) with doctest
- cache the function `arnonC_basis` for a speed improvement. Before:

```
sage: %time B = SteenrodAlgebra(basis='arnon_c').basis(20)
CPU times: user 2.44 s, sys: 0.17 s, total: 2.60 s
Wall time: 2.51 s
sage: %time B = SteenrodAlgebra(basis='arnon_c').basis(100) # takes a loooong time
```
 After:

```
sage: %time B = SteenrodAlgebra(basis='arnon_c').basis(20)
CPU times: user 0.01 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.01 s
Wall time: 0.01 s
sage: %time B = SteenrodAlgebra(basis='arnon_c').basis(100)
CPU times: user 0.57 s, sys: 0.10 s, total: 0.67 s
Wall time: 0.60 s
```

I tested this patch against 6.2.beta8 and got this error in `steenrod_algebra_misc.py`

```
Failed example:
    get_basis_name('wood', 2)
Expected:
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    ValueError: wood is not a recognized basis at the prime 2.
Got:
    <BLANKLINE>
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/waste/cn/sage-6.2.beta8/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/doctest/forker.py", line 480, in _run
        self.execute(example, compiled, test.globs)
      File "/waste/cn/sage-6.2.beta8/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/doctest/forker.py", line 839, in execute
        exec compiled in globs
      File "<doctest sage.algebras.steenrod.steenrod_algebra_misc.get_basis_name[6]>", line 1, in <module>
        get_basis_name('wood', Integer(2))
      File "/waste/cn/sage-6.2.beta8/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/algebras/steenrod/steenrod_algebra_misc.py", line 166, in get_basis_name
        return result
    UnboundLocalError: local variable 'result' referenced before assignment
```

The problem is the block

```
    elif p == 2 and basis.find('wood') >= 0:
        if basis.find('y') >= 0:
            result = 'woody'
        elif basis.find('z') >= 0:
            result = 'woodz'
```
This does neither set `result` nor raise an error.

Unfortunately, I get lots of strange compilation errors when I run `sage -b` which must be totally unrelated to your fixes. I'll return to the ticket when I've figured out why my installation(s) seem to be broken...
