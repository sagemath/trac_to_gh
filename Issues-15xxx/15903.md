```
var('x y')
P = contour_plot(x^2+y^2==1,(x,-1,1),(y,-1,1),plot_points=150, contours=(0,0), fill=False, cmap=["blue"],legend_label='test')
print P.legend()
P.legend(True)
print P.legend()
print P[0].options()['legend_label']
show(P)
```
We see that legends aren't set.

In fact, [the mpl contour api](http://matplotlib.org/api/pyplot_api.html#matplotlib.pyplot.contour) seems to confirm that we shouldn't be trying to label contour plots with legends. (Which makes sense, since they have their own labeling mechanism).  However, for implicit plots, this might cause a problem.  A workaround like at the bottom of [this example](http://matplotlib.org/examples/pylab_examples/contourf_hatching.html) 

```
artists, labels = cs.legend_elements()
plt.legend(artists, labels, handleheight=2)
```
which extracts the labels from the contour legend and then puts them into the usual legend might be a solution.
