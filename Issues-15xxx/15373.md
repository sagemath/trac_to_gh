The indentation is still wrong. It should be:

```
    def global_height(self, prec=None):
        r"""
        Returns the absolute logarithmic height of this rational integer.

        INPUT:

        - ``prec`` (int) -- desired floating point precision (default:
          default RealField precision).

        OUTPUT:

        (real) The absolute logarithmic height of this rational integer.

        ALGORITHM:

        The height of the integer `n` is `\log |n|`.

        EXAMPLES::

            sage: ZZ(5).global_height()
            1.60943791243410
            sage: ZZ(-5).global_height(prec=100)
            1.6094379124341003746007593332
            # This is log(5):
            sage: exp(_)
            5.0000000000000000000000000000

I get the following error with the patch...

```
