The indentation is still wrong. It should be:

```
    def global_height(self, prec=None):
        r"""
        Returns the absolute logarithmic height of this rational integer.

        INPUT:

        - ``prec`` (int) -- desired floating point precision (default:
          default RealField precision).

        OUTPUT:

        (real) The absolute logarithmic height of this rational integer.

        ALGORITHM:

        The height of the integer `n` is `\log |n|`.

        EXAMPLES::

            sage: ZZ(5).global_height()
            1.60943791243410
            sage: ZZ(-5).global_height(prec=100)
            1.6094379124341003746007593332
            # This is log(5):
            sage: exp(_)

I get the following error with the patch...

```
sage -t --long integer.pyx
**********************************************************************
File "integer.pyx", line 4150, in sage.rings.integer.Integer.global_height
Failed example:
    ZZ(-5).global_height(prec=100)
Expected:
    1.6094379124341003746007593332
    # This is log(5):
Got:
    1.6094379124341003746007593332
**********************************************************************
1 item had failures:
   1 of   4 in sage.rings.integer.Integer.global_height
    [916 tests, 1 failure, 5.69 s]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Total time for all tests: 6.0 seconds

```

It's the only error I get, but I don't see why it appears. Since the two values it prints (expected and got) are the same.
