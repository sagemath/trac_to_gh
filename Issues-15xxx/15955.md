The lattice project from GSoC 2012 was never merged for some reason. As far as I can tell no reason was given on public mailing lists. Perhaps part of the reason is that the author ignored Sage's version control. 

The project is described here:

Branch/Commit: **[u/malb/lattices](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/tree/u/malb/lattices) @ [7af2600](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/7af2600b32b291dcd4918a739a7abdeac3dd47f2)**
