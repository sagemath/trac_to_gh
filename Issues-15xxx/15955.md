The lattice project from GSoC 2012 was never merged for some reason. As far as I can tell no reason was given on public mailing lists. Perhaps part of the reason is that the author ignored Sage's version control. 

The project is described here:

    http://gsoc-sage-lattices.blogspot.co.uk/

**Branch:** [u/malb/lattices](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/tree/u/malb/lattices)

This ticket was abandoned in favour of #15976. The Sage GSoc 2012 did not offer enough to warrant the trouble of importing it. However, the voronoi cell implementation of this ticket was imported into #15976.
