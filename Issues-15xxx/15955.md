The lattice project from GSoC 2012 was never merged for some reason. As far as I can tell no reason was given on public mailing lists. Perhaps part of the reason is that the author ignored Sage's version control.

This ticket was abandoned in favour of #15976. The Sage GSoc 2012 did not offer enough to warrant the trouble of importing it. However, the voronoi cell implementation of this ticket was imported into #15976.
