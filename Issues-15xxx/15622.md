```
Now 

```
sage: Graph(graphs.PetersenGraph(), immutable=True).relabel({})
...
ValueError: Thou shalt not relabel an immutable graph
```

Before, the following happened 

```
sage: Graph(graphs.PetersenGraph(), data_structure="static_sparse").relabel({})
...
AttributeError: 'StaticSparseBackend' object has no attribute 'vertex_ints'
```

This is actually another bug, as there should be a `vertex_ints` variable in static sparse graphs. But that's another problem to be addressed in another ticket `:-P`
