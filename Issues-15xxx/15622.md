```
Now 

```
sage: Graph(graphs.PetersenGraph(), immutable=True).relabel({})
...
ValueError: Thou shalt not relabel an immutable graph
```

Before, the following happened 

```
sage: Graph(graphs.PetersenGraph(), data_structure="static_sparse").relabel({})
...
AttributeError: 'StaticSparseBackend' object has no attribute 'vertex_ints'
```

This is actually another bug, as there should be a `vertex_ints` variable in static sparse graphs. But that's another problem to be addressed in another ticket `:-P`

WTF??????

When I do the obvious and change `StaticSparseCGraph` into `StaticSparseBackend`, I get

```
Failed example:
    g.relabel([],True)
Expected:
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    ValueError: Thou shalt not remove a vertex from an immutable graph
Got:
    <BLANKLINE>
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/home/king/Sage/git/sage/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/doctest/forker.py", line 480, in _run

```
Where does the blankline come from? And why is there no blankline when doing the test interactively?
