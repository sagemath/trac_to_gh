While there is some functionality for cartesian products of projective space in Toric Varieties, it does not mesh well with the functionality of Projective Space. This ticket is to implement a general notion of cartesian products of projective space building off of the projective space functionality.

My main interest in this is dynamical systems on products of projective space and subvarieties of products of projective space.

After some more looking, the biggest difference is that I've based everything off of projective_space functionality. I really do prefer that approach (this makes affine patches, morphisms, etc. much easier to work with) and I don't think it will have much, if any, affect on how you've done complete intersections.

Here is what I'd like to do in an ideal world:

- take your first commit and basically move it into my branch. However, I'd still like to build off of projective space. I can integrate any of your additional functionality and merge the differences in our approaches.

- then you could have your ticket be just the complete intersection portion with this ticket as a dependency. You'll probably have to make a few minor adjustments, but I don't think it will be too much.

As I said above, I'm also open to other suggestions.

A couple of issues....
The following need better error messages

```
PP.<x0,x1,y0,y1> = ProductProjectiveSpaces([1,1],QQ)
H = Hom(PP,PP)
f = H([x0*x1*y1^3,x0*x1*y1*y0^2])
```

```
Proj.<x0,x1,y0,y1> = ProductProjectiveSpaces(1,QQ)
```
One should not be able to define a product with only one projective space

```
Prod.<x0,x1> = ProductProjectiveSpaces([1],QQ)
Prod
```
Have an extra input for the gens of the new PS, following error highlights why:

```
PP=ProductProjectiveSpaces([1,2],QQ,'u')
PP.segre_embedding()
```
Not as big a deal, but when return_embedding == True, it should return only the embedding instead of a tuple

```
PP=ProductProjectiveSpaces([1,2],QQ,'u')
PP.affine_patch([1,0],True) 
```

Saw some small spacing issues scattered throughout the documentation as well, make sure to go back and double check
