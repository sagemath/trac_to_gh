While there is some functionality for cartesian products of projective space in Toric Varieties, it does not mesh well with the functionality of Projective Space. This ticket is to implement a general notion of cartesian products of projective space building off of the projective space functionality.

My main interest in this is dynamical systems on products of projective space and subvarieties of products of projective space.

The arithmetic in a multiply graded ring only depends on the ring structure, so in that respect nothing extra is necessary. You just need to interpret the results properly, i.e., that the ideal
(x-y,u-v) in k[x,y,u,v] describes a point in P1xP1 and not a line in P3. I guess knowing you're working with bihomogeneously generated ideals might affect your choice of term ordering if you need to compute groebner bases.

Basically what I expect is that it's possible to use/adapt the toric variety framework for dynamic purposes as well. I haven't looked into it myself. I'm just sharing my experience that in cases where I needed products of projective varieties, I found using multiple gradings initially daunting but eventually not bad at all and much more convenient and efficient.

hmm...yes I looked through your branch some and it seems like most of our basic premises are the same in how we are implementing the products although I seem to be using the underlying structures from projective_space a little bit more. However, the two branches do seem reasonably compatible.

I have no issue with your naming conventions and separate directory, but I'm not sure the best way to go about merging these two sets of changes. You have more experience on the workflow side of things, so I'm happy to entertain suggestions.

After some more looking, the biggest difference is that I've based everything off of projective_space functionality. I really do prefer that approach (this makes affine patches, morphisms, etc. much easier to work with) and I don't think it will have much, if any, affect on how you've done complete intersections.

Here is what I'd like to do in an ideal world:

- take your first commit and basically move it into my branch. However, I'd still like to build off of projective space. I can integrate any of your additional functionality and merge the differences in our approaches.

- then you could have your ticket be just the complete intersection portion with this ticket as a dependency. You'll probably have to make a few minor adjustments, but I don't think it will be too much.

As I said above, I'm also open to other suggestions.

A couple of issues....
The following need better error messages

```
PP.<x0,x1,y0,y1> = ProductProjectiveSpaces([1,1],QQ)
H = Hom(PP,PP)
f = H([x0*x1*y1^3,x0*x1*y1*y0^2])
```

```
Proj.<x0,x1,y0,y1> = ProductProjectiveSpaces(1,QQ)
```
One should not be able to define a product with only one projective space

```
Prod.<x0,x1> = ProductProjectiveSpaces([1],QQ)
Prod
```
Have an extra input for the gens of the new PS, following error highlights why:

```
PP=ProductProjectiveSpaces([1,2],QQ,'u')
PP.segre_embedding()
```
Not as big a deal, but when return_embedding == True, it should return only the embedding instead of a tuple

```
PP=ProductProjectiveSpaces([1,2],QQ,'u')
PP.affine_patch([1,0],True) 
```

Saw some small spacing issues scattered throughout the documentation as well, make sure to go back and double check
