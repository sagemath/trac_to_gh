```
There is no reason to rebuild the `sage` and `csage` targets all the time in `build/Makefile`, since those are included in `./sage -b` anyway.

Those targets still need to be in the `Makefile` for the initial installation, but then we can use the standard `$(INST)/sage` mechanism for that.

This apparently fails on older shells, e.g. redhawk (full log: http://build.sagemath.org/sage/builders/%20%20fast%20UW%20redhawk%20%28Ubuntu%2010.04%20x86_64%29%20full/builds/8/steps/compile_1/logs/stdio). Here I restarted the failed build. There was no csage log created, for the record:

Error building Sage.

The following package(s) may have failed to build:

The build directory may contain configuration files and other potentially
helpful information. WARNING: if you now run 'make' again, the build
directory will, by default, be deleted. Set the environment variable
SAGE_KEEP_BUILT_SPKGS to 'yes' to prevent this.

make: *** [build] Error 1
buildbot@redhawk build$ ./sage -sh

Starting subshell with Sage environment variables set.  Don't forget
to exit when you are done.  Beware:
 * Do not do anything with other copies of Sage on your system.
 * Do not use this for installing Sage packages using "sage -i" or for
   running "make" at Sage's root directory.  These should be done
   outside the Sage shell.

Bypassing shell configuration files...

Can I somehow access the failed build?

Did any other ticket modify `sage-env`?
