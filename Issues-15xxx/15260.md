<a id='comment:1'>Comment 1:</a>
The reason is that for rationals (and apparently more generally for `FieldElement`), we have

```
    def __floordiv__(self, other):
        return self / other
```

where it should be

```
    def __floordiv__(self, other):
        return floor(self / other)
```

I will do a patch once i have compiled a more recent version of Sage

What is fun is that

```
sage: RDF(0.5)//2
0.25

sage: RR(0.5)//2
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for //: 'sage.rings.real_mpfr.RealLiteral' and 'sage.rings.real_mpfr.RealNumber'
```

The condition `if not other != 0:` looks weird. For real interval fields, why not using `other.contains_zero()` which is both easier to understand and faster ?

I do not understand the ad-hoc coercion that is made for `RealNumber` where the precision of `self` takes predecence over the one of `other`.

Concerning `FieldElement` it is very dangerous to return the usual division, since it will silently fail when the field in a subset of the reals for which we did not define a `__floordiv__` method:

```
sage: RLF(5) // 2
2.5000000000000000?
sage: AA(5) // 2
5/2
```

What about trying `(self/other).floor()` and raising a `NotImplementedError` if the method does not exist ?

That's outside the scope of this ticket, but something like that could be done in a new ticket or as part of #2034.

<a id='comment:25'>Comment 25:</a>
I do not agree with your semantic of `__floordiv__`. Within Sage `//` is meant for *internal division* (i.e. quotient of the euclidean division):

```
sage: x = polygen(ZZ)
sage: p1 = (x+1)*(x+2)
sage: p1 // (x+1)
x + 2
sage: _.parent()
Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Integer Ring
sage: sage: p1 / (x+1)
x + 2
sage: sage: _.parent()
Fraction Field of Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Integer Ring
```

Inside `RR` or `RDF` I am not sure what would be the point of `//`. This is a prefectly valid euclidean division `5 = 2 x 2.5 + 0`.

It's consistent with Python's `__floordiv__` for `float`, so this what we should do according to the "principle of least surprise".

The sage-devel thread is in favor of throwing an exception. Really code shouldn't rely on `QQ.__floordiv__` as it is ambiguous and likely to cause difficult-to-see errors.

In my opinion, `QQ` and `float` are very different things so I see no reason why their `__floordiv__` methods should be similar.

I do not see any such consensus in the sage-devel thread! You are the only one proposing to raise an exception... William says that it is a reasonable option, as is Jeroen's proposal.

See #21745 for modifying only QQ.

Actually I think that a good (partial) specification would be:
- `//` and `%` should always be consistent when implemented
- in non-trivial euclidean rings `a // b` and `a % b` should stand for the remainder and quotient of euclidean division (eg `ZZ`, `QQ[x]`). In these cases, it would just be aliases of `a.quo_rem(b)[0]` and `a.quo_rem(b)[1]`.
- for subset of the reals it should be the natural extension of integer euclidean division as proposed in [this thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/PfMop0nyiL0) (see also #21745 and #21747 for a concrete proposal)

Would make sense to me and would also be better from the coercion point of view. However in Sage we use to convert exact integer results to integer as in

```
sage: type((2.5).floor())
<type 'sage.rings.integer.Integer'>
```

Note that Python is sloppy about the output type

```
>>> type(2.0 // 1.0)
float
>>> type(fractions.Fraction(2,1) // fractions.Fraction(1,1))
int
```
(but `fractions` is not so much a standard)
