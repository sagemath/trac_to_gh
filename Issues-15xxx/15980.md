This ticket tracks a number of other tickets that relate to various tasks to prepare Sage code for Python 3.


The following table lists those fixers from [2to3](http://docs.python.org/2.7/library/2to3.html?highlight=2to3#) that are applicable for stage 1.

//stage 1// includes those 2to3 fixers that produce code which can run on Python 2.7 (possibly using some [from `__future__` import ...](http://docs.python.org/2.7/library/__future__.html?highlight=__future__#__future__) or [from future_builtins import ...](http://docs.python.org/2.7/library/future_builtins.html?highlight=future#future_builtins)). The code will usually not run on Python 3.

//stage 2// has those 2to3 fixers (and possibly others) that produce code which can run on Python 3 (more precisely Python 3.3+). The code can run on Python 2 only with the support of imported "compatibility" libraries. Stage 2 is now meta-ticket #16052.

After completion of stage 1 and 2 Sage should have a single, common code base for Python 2.7 and Python 3.3+.

Hi Wilfried,

There is currently a meta-ticket pertaining to supporting Python 3.3 for the Sage distribution, which includes making various changes to the build system and upgrading various dependencies (see #15530). I've added this meta-ticket to that meta-ticket and changed the summary of this one to better reflect that it is specifically referring to the sage library.

I'm a little confused on your distinction between stage 1 and stage 2. What exactly are things that go into stage 2 but not into stage 1?

I don't see anywhere in this list issues with renamed/reorganized libraries like urllib or StringIO, maybe this is part of the compatibility library that you mention as part of stage 2? Also, probably the biggest issue with Python 3 support is the requirement for rich comparison, which again wasn't mentioned in here.

Hi Andrew,

Thanks for linking the ticket:15530 and improving the ticket's title.

As for stage 2 I guess I should soon open the respective meta-ticket.

Some reasons for assigning tasks to stage 2:
* The code can run on Python 2 only with the support of imported "compatibility" libraries. [copied from description]
  Maybe we have to check the licenses of the used compatibility libraries.
* The tasks are usually more complicated. The approach may not be obvious or uncontroversial.
* To make progress we need a Python 3.3 test environment for them (can ticket:15530 help?).

And yes, the issues to mention belong to stage 2.

Hopefully the tasks assigned to stage 1 turn out (relatively) easy :-)
