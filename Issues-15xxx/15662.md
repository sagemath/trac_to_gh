Yo !

Wikipedia says "a zeta function", and you cite a paper saying that there are many zeta functions defined on graph. Why shouldn't this method be renamed to `ihara_zeta_function` instead ?

Besides, I don't understand what you do with the edges of your graph : why do you inverse the first and second coordinate ? (you cannot even assume that the vertices are integers when you write code for graphs. So if you want to ensure that they are sorted in some way ....)

Hello,

1) I am not quite sure about the name indeed. I would say that this is usually called the zeta function of a graph. But there are variants, some of them called weighted zeta functions. I think keeping the name starting with zeta is good for TAB completion.

2) The algorithm needs to duplicate every edge, by orienting the original one in a chosen direction, and the new one in the other direction. I take as orientation the one given by self.edges(). I then use the shift by the number of edges as the bijection between original edges and their duplicate-reverse.

3) Some people had needed that function and used another way to do it : see http://mathoverflow.net/questions/122682/ihara-zeta-function-graph-theory-coefficients-using-a-line-graph

Hmmmmm... Well, if the terminology isn't even set, should it become a Graph method ? I am trying to keep my graph functions out of the graph class when I believe that their are not of very wide use.

When you type "zeta function graphs" in Google (http://goo.gl/SM8aLb) the first result I get is the following :
http://math.ucsd.edu/~aterras/snowbird.pdf

Which hints that there may be quite a lot of Zeta functions defined on graphs. And they do mention the one you implement, saying that it may be weighted too. What about `.zeta_ihara` if you want the name to begin with `zeta` ?

Oh. Well, I still do not understand what your two loops exactly do, but it looks like you are computing a bit too much. It feels like you are interested in the edges which share a vertex, except when they represent the same edge.

Hey, aren't you just computing the adjacency matrix of the line graph, which can be obtained by `G.line_graph().adjacency_matrix()` ?

Okay I read the Mathoverflow thread a bit, and I think that the shortest way for you is to do this :

```
labeled_g = Graph()
labeled_g.add_edges([(u,v,i) for i,(u,v) in enumerate(g.edges(labels=False))]) # faster than giving the edges when the graph is being built. Don't ask.
for v in labeled_g:
    for vv,u,i in labeled_g.edges_incident(v):
        if v != vv: raise RuntimeError("Should Not Happen")
        # do what you have to, now that you know the labels of your edges.
```

Helloooooooo Frederic !

Thank you for this patch. I personally find it clearer, and at least it should be faster. I also added a small commit to this patch (sorry, I just cannot not remove a 'if' when I see a way `:-P`).

I still have a few questions : is it really the *inverse* of the Ihara function (as the documentation claims) or is that a mistake ?
- If it is can you fix it in the docstring and in the function index at the top of the file
- If not, shouldn't it appear in the function's name too ?

I cannot check from the Wikipedia page that the polynomial you implemented is indeed what it should be. Of course this is mainly because I don't get a word of what this polynomial represents, but I would like to check the correction anyway `^^;`
Could you help me a bit with that ? `:-P`

Thaaaaaaaaanks !

Nathann

Hello Nathann,

thanks for your interest and your help.

I have added to the doc one more reference where you can find the exact definition I am using.

You can also look at slide 9/10 in http://math.ucsd.edu/~aterras/ihara%20zeta%20and%20QC.pdf for the definition in short

You can also find examples of values in there : http://www.ams.org/journals/bull/2014-51-01/S0273-0979-2013-01426-5/S0273-0979-2013-01426-5.pdf
