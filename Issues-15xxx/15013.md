LGTM.   I don't see any problems with this; it's also safe since it doesn't touch code, just docs. 

Improving what is listed in the reference manual for logic is a good idea, since it is currently spartan, but this should be in another ticket.

There are problems building the documentation:

The correct syntax is (note the use of a single vs. double colons)
