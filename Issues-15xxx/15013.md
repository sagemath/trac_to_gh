LGTM.   I don't see any problems with this; it's also safe since it doesn't touch code, just docs. 

Improving what is listed in the reference manual for logic is a good idea, since it is currently spartan, but this should be in another ticket.

The third patch listed in the attachments, trac_15013_logic_docstrings.patch, is the only patch that should be integrated into sage for this ticket.  The first two patches are the patches for the two dependencies for this ticket, #14951 and #14952, which I put here for the convenience of the reviewer.

To reduce confusion, I think it is better not to do that. The "Dependencies" field should be sufficient. I removed those other patches which do not belong to this ticket.

There are problems building the documentation:

```
dochtml.log:[logic    ] /mazur/release/merger/sage-5.12.beta4/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/logic/booleval.py:docstring of sage.logic.booleval:9: WARNING: Literal block expected; none found.

```
The correct syntax is (note the use of a single vs. double colons)

```
EXAMPLES:

Some explantory text::
