LGTM.   I don't see any problems with this; it's also safe since it doesn't touch code, just docs. 

Improving what is listed in the reference manual for logic is a good idea, since it is currently spartan, but this should be in another ticket.

The first two patches are the patches for the two dependencies for this ticket, #14951 and #14952, which I put here for the convenience of the reviewer.

Replying to [pmscurek](#comment%3A5):
> The first two patches are the patches for the two dependencies for this ticket, #14951 and #14952, which I put here for the convenience of the reviewer.

To reduce confusion, I think it is better not to do that. The "Dependencies" field should be sufficient. I removed those other patches which do not belong to this ticket.

There are problems building the documentation:

```

The correct syntax is (note the use of a single vs. double colons)
