Maybe we could make add another not so useful sage specific env variable to optionally not poison the proxy variables?
Something like `SAGE_LEAVE_MY_HTTP_PROXY_ALONE_I_KNOW_WHAT_IM_DOING_AND_I_WONT_COMPLAIN_ON_SAGEDEVEL_OR_MAKE_THE_BUILDBOTS_FAIL` or |SAGE_DONT_POISON_HTTP_PROXY` set to no by default or `SAGE_HTTP_PROXY` set to yes by default.

Thinking a little bit about this, I don't think it would be really useful or a good idea because IMHO it is bad if a build/install script decides to randomly download new stuff when I run it.

I trust you checked it actually prevent the spurious download of nose.

Apart of that, it looks ok.
