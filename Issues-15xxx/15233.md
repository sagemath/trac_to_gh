I hope that folding the patches worked... Please see the new patch.

I changed those citations to [auto-numbered footnotes](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html#auto-numbered-footnotes). The benefit is that both `q_binomial` and `gaussian_binomial` have the full docstring. A proper solution would be a way to specify aliases (maybe with functools.wraps?) for any object.

Thanks for reinstating the redirection.
