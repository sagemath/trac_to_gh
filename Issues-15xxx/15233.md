As the title says, we do the following in the attached patch:

* Implement `q_multinomial`.
* A new "Birkhoff formula" for `q_subgroups_of_abelian_group` that is usually faster than the formula of Delsarte due to cancellations and use of `q_binomial`.
* Some cleanup: Whitespace issues, replacing `p` with `q` and trivial naming of `gaussian_binomial` and `gaussian_multinomial`.

Apply:

* [attachment:trac_15233-q_analogues-rebased-ts.patch]

Yes, I do agree to your changes. Proof reading is a never ending job, and it caused me to find few extra documentation fixes (see the new patch). If they are OK by you, positive review it is.

Replying to [tscrim](#comment%3A10):
> I remember that now... I think you should just revert the alias to an explicit redirecting function call (and fold all of the patches together).


I hope that folding the patches worked... Please see the new patch.

I changed those citations to [auto-numbered footnotes](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html#auto-numbered-footnotes). The benefit is that both `q_binomial` and `gaussian_binomial` have the full docstring. A proper solution would be a way to specify aliases (maybe with functools.wraps?) for any object.

I had to do a very minor rebase as there were underscores in `Gaussian_biniomal_coefficient` for me. I believe you don't have #14861 applied.

Thanks for reinstating the redirection.
