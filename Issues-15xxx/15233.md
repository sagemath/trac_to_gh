As the title says, we do the following in the attached patch:

* Implement `q_multinomial`.
* A new "Birkhoff formula" for `q_subgroups_of_abelian_group` that is usually faster than the formula of Delsarte due to cancellations and use of `q_binomial`.
* Some cleanup: Whitespace issues, replacing `p` with `q` and trivial naming of `gaussian_binomial` and `gaussian_multinomial`.

Apply:

Depends on #14861

Oh, that what happened in [#14496 comment:24](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/14496#comment:24). We can fix that "locally", but is there a "global" ticket for the duplicate citation bug? I did not find one.

I had to do a very minor rebase as there were underscores in `Gaussian_biniomal_coefficient` for me. I believe you don't have #14861 applied.
