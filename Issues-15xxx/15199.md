With patch #14871 the `blocks_and_cuts_tree` of a biconnected graph (e.g., a PetersenGraph) is an empty graph. This one line patch forces to have at least one vertex per block.

It is weird to me to return an empty tree when the graph is biconnected. Also I propose to force adding vertices of type B. But if you think it makes more sense to return an empty tree, then we can forget this patch.
