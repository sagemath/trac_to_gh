```
The current implementation of `quo_rem` for p-adic polynomials does not guarantee a remainder with degree less than that of the divisor:

```
sage: R.<x> = Qp(3)[]
sage: x.quo_rem(x)
((1 + O(3^20)), (O(3^20))*x)
```
These leading zero coefficients cause problems, e.g., in #13662.

Depends on #14482
Depends on #15191
