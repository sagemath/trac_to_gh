This ticket is for making it easy to have symbolic functions automatically evaluate on inexact input. This is already the behaviour of most symbolic functions and as such it would be good to have a standard way of implementing it.

This ticket modifies `Function._eval_default` to accept an arbitrary number of arguments. To have the numeric evaluation work, `_eval_default` can be assigned to `_eval_`, or it can be called from within `_eval_` and, if it returns `None`, leaves opportunity for exact simplification. For example,

```
sage: from sage.symbolic.function import BuiltinFunction
sage: class Test(BuiltinFunction):
....:     def __init__(self):
....:         BuiltinFunction.__init__(self, 'test', nargs=1)
....:     def _evalf_(self, x, parent):
....:         return 0.5
....:     def _eval_(self, x):
....:         y = self._eval_default(x)
....:         if y:
....:             return y
....:         else:
....:             return 3
sage: test = Test()
sage: test(1.3)
0.500000000000000
sage: test(pi)
3
```

Benjamin, I CC'ed you since it appears that you implemented this for many symbolic functions. What do you think of this approach?

The reason why I added `AttributeError` to the `except` in `test_relation` is because this is necessary to make comparisons work with some of the hyperbolic functions. Before it worked because they wouldn't evaluate automatically with `CIF` input, but they should since it's inexact.

Good idea!

My initial impression is that your patch looks good, but I don't have time right now to do a thorough review. 

The only immediate change I would suggest is to separate the changes to `hyperbolic.py` and `expression.py` into a different ticket and patch. It's annoying, I know, but it's better to separate issues in the long run.
