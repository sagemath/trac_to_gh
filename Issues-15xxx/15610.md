Currently there is a hidden function `_division_field` in gal_rep, that computes, for an elliptic curve over Q, the number field where all the p-torsion points are rational. This function should be made visible. One might also think about it for arbirary (number) fields.

Related to this is the proposed change #11905 to the function `_splitting_field` in the same file and the changes on #11271.

Keywords: elliptic curves, division field, torsion points, galois representation
