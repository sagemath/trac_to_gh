Hi Travis--

It's a bit of a hack, but what about using -1 for infinity in the Coxeter matrix?  

cheers,

I don't like the symbolic ring either, but I wan't quite sure before about how to make it work with the UCF. I'm thinking we could peel off the necessary portion of your addon patch in #14816 and put it with the Coxeter group code.

> And how do you interact with #14816 (and also with #9290) ?


I didn't notice #9290, so shall we move the Coxeter group code there? I also haven't thought completely through yet how I want to interact with #14816 and Weyl groups of root systems.

1) the following does not work:

sage: G = RightAngledArtinGroup(graphs.EmptyGraph())

it should either fail more gracefully or succeed.

2) there is a typo "creaing"

3) maybe the string representation could use the string repr of the graph ? maybe instead of just the number of vertices ?

I'm not sure. `FinitelyPresentedGroup` is a Gap group, this is implementation is pure python/Sage, and I don't know how to mix the two. There should be methods to construct the corresponding FP group, as well as the ability to pass this to Gap (as a FP group).

Grrr...boarder cases; I'll fix this after I see what would be the most consistent behavior.

>  2) there is a typo "creaing"


Will fix.

> 3) maybe the string representation could use the string repr of the graph ? maybe instead of just the number of vertices ?


That would be better; will change.
