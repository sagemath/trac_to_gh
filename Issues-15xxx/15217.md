For full C++ support we need to call `cython -cplus`. This is currently not done:

```
cython("""
#clang c++
cdef extern from "linbox/element/gmp-rational.h" namespace "LinBox":
    cdef cppclass GMPRationalElement:
        GMPRationalElement(int)
cdef GMPRationalElement* i = new GMPRationalElement(1)
""")
```
results in 

```
Error compiling Cython file:

This correctly uses C++ now. (The example still fails for a difference reason: it needs C++11 now).
