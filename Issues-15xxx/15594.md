The source distribution will obviously have the autotools-generated output, but for those who are directly cloning the sage repository, they would need autotools (as is standard for most projects), or we would need to make autotools a standardish package (akin to gcc).

Integrating the prereq package runs into the same issue.

Thanks! One more thing I just spotted:

```

```
.sconsign.dblite is a file generated by scons, now that we are ditching it, it shouldn't be present. I am guessing you are trying to cover the upgrade path. Is it necessary for us to provide this target. Furthermore, I do not see when it is called. So we have a target to clean some old scons rubbish but it doesn't look like it is run automatically. If it was always run I could see some value but if it is voluntary people may just as well use rm.

Well, it's a *hidden* file... ;-)

(And we could run `make clean-local` from a script.)
