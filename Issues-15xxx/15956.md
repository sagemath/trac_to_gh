The `WeakValueDictionary` behaves differently from regular dicts for unhashable keys:

 ```
 sage: {}[[]]
 TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'
 sage: sage.misc.weak_dict.WeakValueDictionary()[[]]
 KeyError: []
 ```

This is because http://docs.python.org/2/c-api/dict.html#PyDict_GetItem does not throw a `TypeError`.

The proposed fix is very elegant and minimal, but it does noticeably affect a code path that deserves to be very fast: testing that a key does *not* occur in the dictionary. Timings:

```
%cpaste
cython("""
def test(N,D):
    cdef long n=N
    for i in range(n):
        1 in D
""")
--
```

```
sage: D=sage.misc.weak_dict.WeakValueDictionary()
sage: D[2]=ZZ
sage: timeit("test(10^7,D)")
5 loops, best of 3: 122 ms per loop
//with the extra hash call:
5 loops, best of 3: 151 ms per loop
sage: D[1]=ZZ
sage: timeit("test(10^7,D)")
5 loops, best of 3: 466 ms per loop
//this of course times the same with the extra hash call
```
Compared with a normal dictionary:

```
sage: N={}
sage: N[2]=ZZ
sage: timeit("test(10^7,N)")
5 loops, best of 3: 90.6 ms per loop
sage: N[1]=ZZ
sage: timeit("test(10^7,N)")
5 loops, best of 3: 377 ms per loop
```
The change from 122ms to 151ms is an increase of 25% in time taken (and this is for integers, which hash extremely quickly. I've also tried it with a string key '1', where I got 101ms vs. 127ms, so a penalty of around 30ms/10^7 seems to be expected).

Of course, it's nice if `sage.misc.weak_dict.WeakValueDictionary` is a perfect drop-in replacement for `weakref.WeakValueDictionary`, but having better performance at the expense of different edge-case error reporting (and it's just reporting "key not here" in cases where that's actually true, and where some other dictionaries raise "key not hashable", so it's hard to think of an edge case where that seriously affects legitimate program logic) shouldn't just be dismissed.

We could of course patch python and backport `PyDict_GetItemWithError` and get a proper fix, without performance degradation.

For the current proposal, I'd like to see some real-world motivation to bring the error reporting in line with other dictionaries before I'd consider significantly degrading performance.

A further problem with the current proposal: it only fixes one symptom. The nastier example [http://hg.python.org/cpython/file/5cab0ada97b2/Objects/dictobject.c#l1046](http://hg.python.org/cpython/file/5cab0ada97b2/Objects/dictobject.c#l1046) (stack overflow during key comparison) isn't addressed by verifying that the key hashes. Going all the way with the `PyDict_GetItemWithError` solution (or equivalent) would also solve that.
