Why make a special case for `self < 0`? This is bad:

```
sage: RIF(-1/2,-1/3).unique_round()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

If an interval doesn't have a unique round, a larger interval certainly should not have a unique round.

Since `RIF(-1/2).unique_round()` should give `-1`.

Sure, but then why don't implement `unique_round()` like `unique_floor()`?
