<div id="comment:0"></div>

The following code should return False:

```
sage: M = Matroid(ring=GF(5), reduced_matrix=[[1,0,3],[0,1,1],[1,1,0]])
sage: N = Matroid(ring=GF(5), reduced_matrix=[[1,0,1],[0,1,1],[1,1,0]])
sage: M.is_field_isomorphic(N)
True
```

Indeed:

```
sage: any(M.is_field_isomorphism(N, p) for p in Permutations(range(6)))
False
```

The cause is a recursive call gone wrong in set_system.pyx.

Otherwise, I'm still learning this whole process. Apparently the Branch link being colored red is a bad thing (it was green when I first uploaded this)...
