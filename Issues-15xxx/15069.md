```
The following happens both with Sage's `MonoDict` and with Python's `weakref.WeakKeyDictionary`:

```
from sage.structure.coerce_dict import MonoDict
M = MonoDict(11)

class A: pass
a = A()
prev = a

for i in range(1000):
    newA = A()
    M[prev] = newA
    prev = newA

len(M)
del a
Exception RuntimeError: 'maximum recursion depth exceeded while calling a Python object' in <sage.structure.coerce_dict.MonoDictEraser object at 0x5a13788> ignored
```
Replace `M = MonoDict(11)` by `M = weakref.WeakKeyDictionary()`, and you get essentially the same error:

```
sage: del a
Exception RuntimeError: 'maximum recursion depth exceeded while calling a Python object' in <function remove at 0x5f9d578> ignored
```

However, a `weakref.WeakValueDictionary` seems safe:

```
sage: class A: pass
sage: M = weakref.WeakValueDictionary()
sage: a = A()
....: prev = a
....: for i in range(1000):
....:     newA = A()
....:     M[newA] = prev
....:     prev = newA
....:     
sage: len(M)
1000
sage: del a
sage: len(M)
0
```
even though the recursive deletion of dictionary items seems similar.

Aim of this ticket: Make it so that the erasers of `MonoDict` and `TripleDict` are not recursively called and thus the dreaded 'maximum recursion depth exceeded ... ignored' finally vanishes.

Comments 97--102 at #10963 provide some ideas how to solve the problem.

Actually I originally thought that the solution is easy: When the eraser of a `MonoDict` key is called, the to-be-deleted value shall be assigned to a temporary variable and thus be prevented from being deleted while the corresponding items from the bucket of the `MonoDict` are deleted; the value can only be deleted (causing a new invocation of the eraser) when the original call to the eraser is done and the temporary variable vanishes.

Inserting print statements shows that in unpatched Sage the eraser calls are nested, which explains the "recursion depth exceeded". And in fact, the trick with the temporary variable has the effect that the eraser calls are now neatly ordered and not nested. And now comes the punch-line: The "recursion depth exceeded" error does *not* vanish!!!

The comments at #10963 seem to show that the error behaves different if the class A in the example from the ticket description is a Python or a Cython class. But there is a recursion depth problem in either case.

I see that the n-th element created (the first one is `a`) is the "last but n"-th element for which `__del__` is called. This comes as a surprise. One should think that `del a` first makes `a` disappear, which then triggers a call to the "eraser" callback, which then makes M[a] disappear, which triggers the next "eraser" callback.

Its still better than before, so if you want to run with this workaround then that is fine with me.

In the worst case we will get an explicit recursion error, some
objects won't get deleted, and the calculation will proceed safely,
right?

If yes, then I agree it's not yet perfect but safe enough to go
ahead. Thanks Simon!

I don't feel quite qualified for the fine technical details. Volker,
if you give me a green light, I am happy finishing the rest of the
review.
