The code for `LinearMatroid.is_field_equivalent` will call `LinearMatroid._is_field_isomorphism` without ensuring that `self` and `other` are different objects. The latter function assumes (by design) that they are. The current implementation happens to give the right answer, but this could change when `LinearMatroid._is_field_isomorphism` changes its algorithm.

Solution: if `self is other`, just return True.
