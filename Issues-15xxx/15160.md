Hello, sorry for my version of Sage but I think nothing has move for enabling matrices and linear algebra in general for general rings (these using the category framework and not using the class RingElement).

The mercurial patch attached on this ticket did break the multiplication between matrix and vector. This is not the right way to fix that. I don't know how to fix that, this go far beyond my knowledge with the category framework, coercions, actions... 

On cocalc and my (old) version of Sage (sorry one more time), I still have things that the following tests... For that reason, I did locally implement an horrible hack to invert matrix with unitary determinant.

```

You could try these short examples on the current Sage version. Same error appear with the following :

```

sage: M = MatrixSpace(SF, 4)

```

All these kind of tests can be read in the very old bugged patch.

Hope this could help.

This topic is closed to representation theory of the symmetric group (linear algebra on some strange ring).

Since I did not contribute to Sage these last... two years (perhaps). I am not aware of the list of algebraic construction for which this bug pop. I am really afraid the list can be very large.

I did work on basis changes of the coinvariant of the symmetric group (Schubert polynomials, Harmonic polynomials, Descents Monomials, Monomials under staircase, Higher Specht Polynomials). This topic is closed to representation theory of the symmetric group (linear algebra on some strange ring). All my basis changes (binomial(5, 2) different) are matrices with unital determinant that Sage can't inverse. Oh, In fact Sage can do that for sure (all good algorithms are inside for that...), but I really don't know how to fix it. I did try but I did not succeed... 

I will compile an up to date version of Sage this night to check the bug is still here...

Ok, I know have a 8.1 and things seems now better...

I did check on my small set of exotic rings (they don't all come from the combinat crew, Steenrod come from number theorists I guess...)

It seems to me that very basic stuff work fine :
for M a matrix and V a vector and c a ring coefficient
- M*V, V*M, c*M, M*c, c*V, V*c all works fine (I did not manage to build a vector for Non Commutative Symmetric Functions but this probably don't come from matrix code...)
- .charpoly() also works fine
- .commutator() always works
- Some Tracebacks for adjoint, echelonize, inverse, rank and kernel...

I did run that (I create a vector with the first column of the identity matrix, I did not use the vector( ...data... ) function)

```
def test_ring(R):
    o = R.one()
    z = R.zero()
    try:
        Id2 = Matrix([[o, z], [z, o]])
    except:
        print(R, "Error creating a matrix")
        return None
    try:
        V = Id2.column(0)
    except:
        print(R, "Error creating a vector")
        return None
    c = R.an_element()
    try:
        if(V*c != c*V):
            print(R, "Bug in mul on coef*vector")
    except:
        print(R, "Error in mul on coef*vector")
    try:
        if(Id2*c != c*Id2):
            print(R, "Bug in mul on coef*matrix")
    except:
        print(R, "Error in mul on coef*matrix")
    try:
        if(Id2*V != V*Id2):
            print(R, "Bug in mul on matrix*vector")
    except:
        print(R, "Error in mul on matrix*vector")
    try:
        P = Id2.charpoly()
    except:
        print(R, "Error in computation of charpoly")
    try:
        P = Id2.adjoint()
    except:
        print(R, "Error in computation of adjoint")        
    try:
        P = Id2.commutator(Id2)
    except:
        print(R, "Error in computation of commutator")
    try:
        P = Id2.echelonize()
    except:
        print(R, "Error in computation of echelonize")
    try:
        P = Id2.inverse()
    except:
        print(R, "Error in computation of inverse")
    try:
        P = Id2.rank()
    except:
        print(R, "Error in computation of rank")
    try:
        P = Id2.kernel()
    except:
        print(R, "Error in computation of kernel")
```
and I did get:

```
(Symmetric Functions over Rational Field, 'Error in computation of adjoint')
(Symmetric Functions over Rational Field, 'Error in computation of echelonize')
(Symmetric Functions over Rational Field, 'Error in computation of inverse')

```

So It seems to me that error appears when using any algo using a division in coefficient ring... So this ticket should just enable the possibility of doing silently divisions by unital elements of the coefficient ring without searching for fraction_field, is_field or whatever. This remains me the method `divide_knowing_divisible_by` of sage integers. If you have a multiple, you don't want as answer a rational.

Feel free to reformulate/update/correct the ticket description. My English is pretty horrible and I don't use often the right words.
