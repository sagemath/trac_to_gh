Hello, sorry for my version of Sage but I think nothing has move for enabling matrices and linear algebra in general for general rings (these using the category framework and not using the class RingElement).

The mercurial patch attached on this ticket did break the multiplication between matrix and vector. This is not the right way to fix that. I don't know how to fix that, this go far beyond my knowledge with the category framework, coercions, actions... 

On cocalc and my (old) version of Sage (sorry one more time), I still have things that the following tests... For that reason, I did locally implement an horrible hack to invert matrix with unitary determinant.

You could try these short examples on the current Sage version. Same error appear with the following :

```

sage: M = MatrixSpace(SF, 4)

All these kind of tests can be read in the very old bugged patch.

Hope this could help.

nborie: I understand your last comments, but my impression was that the ticket was talking also about much more elementary stuff than inverting matrices.

For example, one of the "goals" stated is "Try to modify `MatrixSpace` and `Matrix` such that all basic operation can be done with special rings". It would be good to have an example of something that doesn't work for this "goal".

Ok, I know have a 8.1 and things seems now better...

I did check on my small set of exotic rings (they don't all come from the combinat crew, Steenrod come from number theorists I guess...)

It seems to me that very basic stuff work fine :
for M a matrix and V a vector and c a ring coefficient
- M*V, V*M, c*M, M*c, c*V, V*c all works fine (I did not manage to build a vector for Non Commutative Symmetric Functions but this probably don't come from matrix code...)
- .charpoly() also works fine
- .commutator() always works
- Some Tracebacks for adjoint, echelonize, inverse, rank and kernel...

I did run that (I create a vector with the first column of the identity matrix, I did not use the vector( ...data... ) function)

```
def test_ring(R):
    o = R.one()
    z = R.zero()
    try:
        Id2 = Matrix([[o, z], [z, o]])
    except:
        print(R, "Error creating a matrix")
        return None
    try:
        V = Id2.column(0)
    except:
        print(R, "Error creating a vector")
        return None
    c = R.an_element()
    try:
        if(V*c != c*V):
            print(R, "Bug in mul on coef*vector")
    except:
        print(R, "Error in mul on coef*vector")
    try:
        if(Id2*c != c*Id2):
            print(R, "Bug in mul on coef*matrix")
    except:
        print(R, "Error in mul on coef*matrix")
    try:
        if(Id2*V != V*Id2):
            print(R, "Bug in mul on matrix*vector")
    except:
        print(R, "Error in mul on matrix*vector")
    try:
        P = Id2.charpoly()
    except:
        print(R, "Error in computation of charpoly")
    try:
        P = Id2.adjoint()
    except:
        print(R, "Error in computation of adjoint")        
    try:
        P = Id2.commutator(Id2)
    except:
        print(R, "Error in computation of commutator")
    try:
        P = Id2.echelonize()
    except:
        print(R, "Error in computation of echelonize")
    try:
        P = Id2.inverse()
    except:
        print(R, "Error in computation of inverse")
    try:
        P = Id2.rank()
    except:
        print(R, "Error in computation of rank")
    try:
        P = Id2.kernel()
    except:
        print(R, "Error in computation of kernel")
```
and I did get:

So It seems to me that error appears when using any algo using a division in coefficient ring... So this ticket should just enable the possibility of doing silently divisions by unital elements of the coefficient ring without searching for fraction_field, is_field or whatever. This remains me the method `divide_knowing_divisible_by` of sage integers. If you have a multiple, you don't want as answer a rational.

After, the problem stays very technical since, for speed issues, we don't want to overload all divisions. Can it be done softly ? Is Implementing a new method `inverse_knowing_invertible` or `inverse_no_division` (just inverse the det) something sufficient ? I don't know enough about matrix code to give a good opinion. I just remember that my very old patch did allows to invert matrices with unital determinant but it did break everything everywhere (My old path did break the scalar multiplication of Sage FreeModule for example)...
 
Feel free to reformulate/update/correct the ticket description. My English is pretty horrible and I don't use often the right words.
