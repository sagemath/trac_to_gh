Hello Harald,

FYI - The http://www.sagemath.org/pdf/en/prep/prep_tutorial.pdf link
gives a "404 Error: page not found" message.  I accessed this link
from here: http://www.sagemath.org/doc/index.html.  It appears that
the correct URL should be
http://www.sagemath.org/pdf/en/prep/prep_tutorials.pdf (i.e. tutorials
plural).

Cheers,
Gary
