parametric_plot takes a pair of functions that it will evaluate for various values of the plotting parameter (to produce the x and y coordinates of the plot).  Sometimes it would be more convenient and more efficient to take a single function returning a pair of values: for example when a lot of precomputation has to be done from the parameter so that computing x alone or y alone is just as complicated as computing (x,y).  Currently this does not seem to be possible.
