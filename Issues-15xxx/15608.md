There are several open tickets relating to issues with the simon_two_descent function for elliptic curves over Q and over number fields, which call Denis Simon's GP scripts, as well as a similar number of closed tickets.  To help keep track of these, this ticket serves only to be a catalogue of these open tickets in order to better coordinate work on them.

    #5153 bug in simon_two_descent for elliptic curves [fixed]

    #9322 long time in simon_two_descent for elliptic curves [fixed]

    #10735 Simon 2-descent only returns an upper bound on the 2-Selmer rank [positive review (documentation), upstream]

    #10745 bug in elliptic curve gens() [positive review]

    #11005 Update Simon's GP scripts [fixed]

    #15809 Compile Denis Simon's scripts with gp2c [new]

    #13593 tighter upper bound on elliptic curve rank [fixed]

    #15483 Simon 2-descent gives `RuntimeError` for an elliptic curve over a quadratic field [fixed (workaround), upstream]

    #16022 simon_two_descent sometimes gives wrong answers [fixed, upstream]

Upstream are the ones with bugs in the script that were reported to the author.
