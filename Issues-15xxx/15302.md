I've put them into the optional directory, but I doubt that's correct. Should they be in the corresponding upstream directories? (And create a new directory there, if it doesn't exist?)

I'm also wondering about having different versions there, as it is right now in many of these directories.

(Sorry about my questions, but I don't know about the mechanics behind these new directories.)

This is correct (I've just done this for these packages).

> I'm also wondering about having different versions there, as it is right now in many of these directories.

We already are hosting multiple versions of standard packages (e.g. r, pari), and I see no reason why we couldn't host multiple versions of optional packages either.
