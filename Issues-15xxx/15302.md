I've put them into the optional directory, but I doubt that's correct. Should they be in the corresponding upstream directories? (And create a new directory there, if it doesn't exist?)

I'm also wondering about having different versions there, as it is right now in many of these directories.

(Sorry about my questions, but I don't know about the mechanics behind these new directories.)

This is correct (I've just done this for these packages).

We already are hosting multiple versions of standard packages (e.g. r, pari), and I see no reason why we couldn't host multiple versions of optional packages either.
