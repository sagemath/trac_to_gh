<a id='comment:3'></a>Note that it should not be used.
I tried to craft a minimally modified dylib Makefile.
No idea if it has any chance to work.
And I forgot to fill in the branch name so you may not have been aware of that...

Anyway I agree that autotoolizing might be a good idea.
That's what MinGW and Cygwin do.
It's just it was more complicated to setup, test quickly.
