The **category `Sequence`** is deprecated since 2009 (commit `619aa0fa`). If I understand it correctly, the **class `Sequence`** should instead have the category `FiniteEnumeratedSets` (implying later implementation of `InfiniteSequence`).

This ticket is for removing the **category `Sequence`**. It depends on #15852.

Depends on #15852

Component: **categories**
