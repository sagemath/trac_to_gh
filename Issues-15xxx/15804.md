This ticket is a split of #8558 for easier review and merging.

Add a lift_centered method to ntl_mod_p elements and a generic function.

If p  is an integer mod n, returns r congruent to p mod n such that -n/2 < r <= n/2

It also deprecates the use of centerlift for lift_centered. The discussion is in #8558


Keywords: modular arithmetic, centered lift

```
K.<x,y,z> = QQ[]
I = Ideal(x*y,x*z,y*z)
R = K.quotient_ring(I)
f = R((x+y+z)**2)
lift_centered(f)
