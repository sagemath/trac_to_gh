One can calculate factorials of RIF-Elements with

```
sage: factorial(RIF(2.3,5.7))
1.?e3
```
but calling it by

```
sage: (RIF(2.3,5.7)).factorial()
Traceback (click to the left of this block for traceback)
...
AttributeError: 'sage.rings.real_mpfi.RealIntervalFieldElement' object
has no attribute 'factorial'
```
does not work. This is in contrast to `.log()`, `.sqrt()`, etc., where it works.


**Keywords:** factorial RIF RealIntervalField calling inconsistent beginner

Okay I get it the implementation fails for  this 

sage: factorial(RIF(2.3))

2.683437381955768?

sage: gamma(RIF(2.3))

1.166711905198161?

so if the gamma is incremented that sets the factorial function.

Any comments on this would be helpful.

I have been looking at the different fields. Except for `ZZ` and `SR`, none of them have `factorial()` method defined. If indeed this method is introduced, it should be introduced in many places where it makes sense (e.g. `CC`, `RR`, `RDF`, `QQ`, etc), if only to redirect to the generic function call `factorial(self)`; like

```
def factorial(self):
    return sage.functions.other.factorial(self)
```

About your implementation: there is no need to call `RIF`. The addition already returns an element of RIF. I am saying this just for any future modifications you make to the functions; in some cases (but not this factorial function) it can make improvements :)

```
sage: a = RIF(2.5, 4.5)
sage: a+1     
1.?e1
sage: %timeit RIF(a+1)
100000 loops, best of 3: 7.54 us per loop
sage: %timeit a+1     
100000 loops, best of 3: 4.75 us per loop
```
For the factorial function itself, speed wise there is no difference since the gamma function is much slower than this `RIF` call!

```
sage: %timeit (a+1).gamma()
1000 loops, best of 3: 240 us per loop
sage: %timeit RIF(a+1).gamma()
1000 loops, best of 3: 243 us per loop
```

Hmm...IMHO this is not ideal. It should be the other way around, i.e., the general `factorial`-function should check if the element has `.factorial` and executes it. Only if not, it comes up with solution on its own. (I have not checked the current implementations; its just came in my mind by thinking about it).

This being my first patch I still do not have the in depth knowledge of placing of various methods and classes. I am still not getting the part that is being discussed , is it that the main factorial function should check for whether the element has .factorial and do the necessary and if not available it is left to its own. I may be completely wrong but if they could be some comments on my understanding it would be of great help. Thanks.

What dkrenn mentioned is to add the following to the `factorial()` call in `sage/functions/other.py`

```
try:
    number.factorial()
except AttributeError:
    <do the rest>
```
instead of what I wrote in [comment:11](#comment%3A11). But don't try to modify the main factorial function right now. It is unclear to me at least what is the right thing to do here.

Well, as that's still unclear it would not hurt to implement at least the `RIF` member function. I rebased the branch on 6.2.beta7.

Please open a ticket for the refactoring of `functions/other.py:factorial()` if you think it necessary.

Thanks for opening the new ticket. This ticket is also an enhancement to `RIF`. And the implementation here is not complete because the same change should happen to, for example, `CIF`. Even after the current ticket, we still have inconsistent behavior depending on whether the element is in `RIF` or `RR` or `ZZ`, etc.

For example, suppose you run a long program or sequence of functions where the output happens to become an element of `QQ`:

```
sage: a = QQ(2)  # suppose "a" is got as an output of a function
sage: a.factorial()
...
AttributeError: 'sage.rings.rational.Rational' object has no attribute 'factorial'

sage: a = ZZ(2)  # for another input to the function, output is an element of ZZ
sage: a.factorial()
2
```
From the end user point of view, the behavior is very inconsistent and depends on whether after all the computations you get back an element from `QQ` or `ZZ`. This needs to be fixed more generally, and this is why I said I wasn't ready to give it positive review in [comment:11](#comment%3A11)

My question was: should we fix all these different fields just by patching them one by one, OR is there a general way to fix all the fields at one go?

The author has resolved one of these and this deserves a positive review. It shows that there was a need for it in RIF. We don't know about the others. Many thanks for bringing up the big picture.

Let me finally remind you of this note in the development manuals:

“The perfect is the enemy of the good”

The point of the review is to ensure that the Sage code guidelines are followed and that the the implementation is mathematically correct. Please refrain from aditional feature requests or open-ended discussion about alternative implementations. If you want the patch written differently, your suggestion should be a clear and actionable request.

The whole point of my argument was to highlight that we should not introduce more inconsistency, if possible. I agree that the ticket fixes this for `RIF`; primarily because the author happened to use it and discovered one place where it is inconsistent with the behavior of other functions.

I have taught a course with Sage, and I have seen students struggle with the way things are implemented. The pain points were not whether something is slow or incorrect - it was mostly about the fact that the behavior varied wildly depending on what field the students were working on. Now, try to explain to non-computer science students why things work different in reals, integers, and rationals, what is the difference between a symbolic expression and a symbolic function, etc.

As developers, we have got used to the way certain things work, and we tend to automatically write code that behaves properly. If you really want to find more such inconsistencies, then ask a person who is unfamiliar with Sage and observe what they write, and how they expect some newly written code to behave.

> If you want the patch written differently, your suggestion should be a clear and actionable request.

I was quite clear in stating that I sought the opinion of someone knowledgeable about the `factorial` implementation. I didn't implement that function and I do not know why it is implemented the way it is.

Replying to [@jdemeyer](#comment%3A24):

No problem. Add yourself in. Just put in your real name and not your login.

Edit: By "Add yourself in" I mean, to make the "Author" field look like "<your name>, Jeroen Demeyer".
