Before

```
sage: g=Graph(graphs.PetersenGraph(),immutable=True)
sage: g == loads(dumps(g))
...
TypeError: __cinit__() takes exactly 1 positional argument (0 given)
```

After

```
sage: g=Graph(graphs.PetersenGraph(),immutable=True)
sage: g == loads(dumps(g))
True
```

What do you think about the following way to pickle generic graphs?

```
    def __reduce__(self):
        # copy the dict
        D = dict(self.__dict__.iteritems())
        # remove something that may not be picklable
        try:
            del D['_backend']
        except KeyError:
            pass
        return type(self), (self.edges(),), D
```
Is this elegant enough for you? Additional bait: We may even remove the existing `__reduce__` methods of the other backends `;-)`

Some little timing:

Your way of pickling:

```
sage: G = graphs.PetersenGraph()
sage: g = G.copy(data_structure='static_sparse')
sage: %timeit h = loads(dumps(g))
1000 loops, best of 3: 1.11 ms per loop
```

My way of pickling:

```
sage: G = graphs.PetersenGraph()
sage: g = G.copy(data_structure='static_sparse')
sage: %timeit h = loads(dumps(g))
1000 loops, best of 3: 493 us per loop

Right. This is in fact a strong argument for implementing the pickling in the way you did. All these optional arguments of `(Di)Graph.__init__` are a mess.

> Honestly, I don't think pickling really needs any amount of efficient code.


That's a valid point, too. Efficient pickling mainly plays a role if *copying* is implemented by pickling, since this may happen interactively and frequently. But we have a separate and hopefully efficient implementation of `__copy__`, and thus `__reduce__` is really only involved when people want to store a poset (and hence, an immutable graph, and thus, a static sparse backend) into a file.

Correct. Sometimes generic code just works, but in some cases `__reduce__` needs to be provided. Wonderful that Python is object oriented and lets us do such things...

Here or on a different ticket?

OK. So, I'll review your pickling approach, and in the meantime you point me to your branch for "making posets use immutable graphs", so that I can test the promotion bug.

For example (this is the doctest of my not-posted commit):

```
sage: uc = [[2,3], [], [1], [1], [1], [3,4]]
sage: D = DiGraph(dict([[i,uc[i]] for i in range(len(uc))]))
sage: G = Graph(dict([[i,uc[i]] for i in range(len(uc))]))
sage: from sage.graphs.base.static_sparse_backend import StaticSparseBackend
sage: d = StaticSparseBackend(D)
sage: g = StaticSparseBackend(G)
sage: list(d.iterator_edges(d.iterator_verts(None), False))
[(0, 2), (0, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4)]
sage: list(g.iterator_edges(g.iterator_verts(None), False))
[(0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)]

If I recall correctly, in the "good old days" (before we had posets), the doctest coverage script was checking in each file whether it contains a "loads(dumps(bla)) == bla" test. So, people did want to pickle stuff even before some guy came up with category testsuites.

By the way, if you want that static graphs aren't just tested via posets, then you should provide a category of graphs! Its testsuite would automatically test whether pickling works `:-p`.

Ahahahah. Over my dead body. I have been debugging code for two full evenings because people decided I should only implement picklable graphs, and this is because I try to fix combinat's hack of immutable posets. And that's not even the end of it. So let's make that clear : over my dead body `:-P`

And there are still broken doctests in the combinat/poset/ folder now. I just updated the u/ncohen/tmp branch with this commit.

Argggggggg sorry. I just noticed that there is a problem with this code. It does not handle multiple edges and loops correctly.

I HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATE THESE THINGS.

```
sage: g = Graph(multiedges = True)
sage: g.add_edges(graphs.PetersenGraph().edges())
sage: g.add_edges(graphs.PetersenGraph().edges())
sage: gi = g.copy(immutable=True)
sage: loads(dumps(gi))
Multi-graph on 10 vertices
sage: loads(dumps(gi)) == gi
False
sage: gi.size()             
30
sage: loads(dumps(gi)).size()
15
```

I will add a commit to this one within 10 minutes. Need to write it first `>_<`
