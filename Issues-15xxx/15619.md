Before

```
sage: g=Graph(graphs.PetersenGraph(),immutable=True)
sage: g == loads(dumps(g))
...
TypeError: __cinit__() takes exactly 1 positional argument (0 given)
```

After

```
sage: g=Graph(graphs.PetersenGraph(),immutable=True)
sage: g == loads(dumps(g))
True
```

What do you think about the following way to pickle generic graphs?

```
    def __reduce__(self):
        # copy the dict
        D = dict(self.__dict__.iteritems())
        # remove something that may not be picklable
        try:
            del D['_backend']
        except KeyError:
            pass
        return type(self), (self.edges(),), D
```
Is this elegant enough for you? Additional bait: We may even remove the existing `__reduce__` methods of the other backends `;-)`

Some little timing:

Your way of pickling:

```
sage: G = graphs.PetersenGraph()
sage: g = G.copy(data_structure='static_sparse')
sage: %timeit h = loads(dumps(g))
1000 loops, best of 3: 1.11 ms per loop
```

My way of pickling:

```
sage: G = graphs.PetersenGraph()
sage: g = G.copy(data_structure='static_sparse')
sage: %timeit h = loads(dumps(g))
1000 loops, best of 3: 493 us per loop
```

So as we are just implementing it to make the testsuite happy, and unless you want to mess with all this code just because of that, let's use it. It's short and it works. It's bad code of course, because pickling is bad work. It's a generic way to store data, that should work regardless of what the data is. It's like XML. Saving data is not something that should be done without *knowing* what the data is. If you want to write generic code for this, it will end up being bad code.\n\nAnyway. The only problem I would like to see solved is to have Posets use a static data structure. That would make them both faster and lighter. And I think something should be done about the time complexity of the `Graph`/`DiGraph` constructor too.\n\nLet's move on. Can you help me with this promotion bug ? I have no idea of how it should be solved, and it seems to be the last step before having the Posets use a static backend.\n\nNathann",

Honestly, I don't think pickling really needs any amount of efficient code. So as we are just implementing it to make the testsuite happy, and unless you want to mess with all this code just because of that, let's use it. It's short and it works. It's bad code of course, because pickling is bad work. It's a generic way to store data, that should work regardless of what the data is. It's like XML. Saving data is not something that should be done without *knowing* what the data is. If you want to write generic code for this, it will end up being bad code.

Anyway. The only problem I would like to see solved is to have Posets use a static data structure. That would make them both faster and lighter. And I think something should be done about the time complexity of the `Graph`/`DiGraph` constructor too.

Let's move on. Can you help me with this promotion bug ? I have no idea of how it should be solved, and it seems to be the last step before having the Posets use a static backend.

For example (this is the doctest of my not-posted commit):

```
sage: uc = [[2,3], [], [1], [1], [1], [3,4]]
sage: D = DiGraph(dict([[i,uc[i]] for i in range(len(uc))]))
sage: G = Graph(dict([[i,uc[i]] for i in range(len(uc))]))
sage: from sage.graphs.base.static_sparse_backend import StaticSparseBackend
sage: d = StaticSparseBackend(D)
sage: g = StaticSparseBackend(G)
sage: list(d.iterator_edges(d.iterator_verts(None), False))
[(0, 2), (0, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4)]
sage: list(g.iterator_edges(g.iterator_verts(None), False))
[(0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)]

If I recall correctly, in the "good old days" (before we had posets), the doctest coverage script was checking in each file whether it contains a "loads(dumps(bla)) == bla" test. So, people did want to pickle stuff even before some guy came up with category testsuites.

By the way, if you want that static graphs aren't just tested via posets, then you should provide a category of graphs! Its testsuite would automatically test whether pickling works `:-p`.

Ahahahah. Over my dead body. I have been debugging code for two full evenings because people decided I should only implement picklable graphs, and this is because I try to fix combinat's hack of immutable posets. And that's not even the end of it. So let's make that clear : over my dead body `:-P`

And there are still broken doctests in the combinat/poset/ folder now. I just updated the u/ncohen/tmp branch with this commit.

Ouch. But you take care of this in #15622, right?

Apart from this: All doctests pass, and the code looks fine to me. In a review commit, I'll add some tests for issues we discussed here.

Argggggggg sorry. I just noticed that there is a problem with this code. It does not handle multiple edges and loops correctly.

I HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATE THESE THINGS.

```
sage: g = Graph(multiedges = True)
sage: g.add_edges(graphs.PetersenGraph().edges())
sage: g.add_edges(graphs.PetersenGraph().edges())
sage: gi = g.copy(immutable=True)
sage: loads(dumps(gi))
Multi-graph on 10 vertices
sage: loads(dumps(gi)) == gi
False
sage: gi.size()             
30
sage: loads(dumps(gi)).size()
15
```

I will add a commit to this one within 10 minutes. Need to write it first `>_<`
