This is fairly unlikely but occasionally comes up on the buildbot:

```
sage -t --long src/sage/homology/simplicial_complex.py
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/homology/simplicial_complex.py", line 2236, in sage.homology.simplicial_complex.SimplicialComplex.is_cohen_macaulay
Failed example:
    S.is_cohen_macaulay(ncpus=3)
Expected:
    False
Got:
    [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/home/buildbot/build/sage/snapperkob/sage_git/dot_sage/temp/snapperkob/10634/dir_n0BDmn/10759.out'
    False
```

This is because a race condition in `@parallel`. This is a parallel generator which forks processes, each process handling one item of the generator. The output of each finished process is stored as pickle in a working directory and then `yield`ed by the main process.

When the generator is closed (for example, the generator is used as argument to `all()` and a `False` condition is found), the following happens in a `finally` block:

1. The working directory is removed.

2. The remaining processes are killed.

This is a race condition because it can happen that a subprocess finishes between these steps. Then that process wants to write its output in the deleted directory. The fix is obvious: first kill the processes, then delete the directory.

Depends on #22462

Maybe, but that's not fixing the problem, just hiding it.

If you want to "fix" the problem but not hide it, just add `# known bug`.

at least it would be good to know what part of the code in question writes temp files with extension .out
(In my admittedly limited experience with parallel code I never saw slaves doing any file I/O; if they do they ought to clean up after themselves, otherwise there is not telling as to what will happen)

As a rule, I get it on a gentoo linux laptop, running on a 4-core Intel i7, and the usual ext4 file systems on an SSD.

I almost always get this problem when running `MAKE='make -j8' make ptestlong` on a Ubuntu 16.04, with 8 cpus, with file system ext4.

I am now running `make testlong` in serially to see the difference.
