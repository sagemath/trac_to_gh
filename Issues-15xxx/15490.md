There are two current issues. There is a typo: `n` instead of `period`.

Also, it would be nice to verify that the roots are actually giving preperiodic points of the correct period as a doctest.

Line 553-556 are duplicated and should be removed.

Line 539, 557 need a space around the =.

Since there are two attachments you should add an 'apply' block to the description.
