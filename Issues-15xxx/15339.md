This used to be true on Windows 7+ at least, same problem for any exe whose name contains patch/install/update...

As this one happens during gf2x building process and Windows is particularly picky about timestamps of the exe and the corresponding manifest file, this will not be completely trivial to fix.
i.e. we have to patch gf2x build system (or convince them to change the exe name... I'll report there shortly).

Strange, it now fails for me on Windows 7 64 bits under Cygwin32, but is ok under Cygwin64...
And I re checked Travis log and there was no problem even if he was under Windows ? 64 bits under Cygwin32 !!!
