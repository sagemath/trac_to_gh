This used to be true on Windows 7+ at least, same problem for any exe whose name contains patch/install/update...

As this one happens during gf2x building process and Windows is particularly picky about timestamps of the exe and the corresponding manifest file, this will not be completely trivial to fix.
i.e. we have to patch gf2x build system (or convince them to change the exe name... I'll report there shortly).
