There have been a lot of changes to eclib since the version 2012-08-30 in Sage-6.0.  A lot of these are minor improvements and small bugfixes not all relevant to Sage.  There is a new optional dependency on Flint (requiring Flint >=2.3) and an optional dependency on boost to parallelise some code not currently wrapped in Sage (a contribution by Warwick MSc student Marcus Mo).  For details see https://github.com/JohnCremona/eclib.

Very few changes will be needed to the `spkg-install` script, and the ECLIB dependency in build/deps will have FLINT added as a  new dependency.  There may be some cosmetic adjustments to doctest outputs necessary.

I'll look into all this...   but gmp (or mpir) definitely is an indirect dependency (try ldd local/lib/libec.so   or ldd local/bin/mwrank) but it is hidden in the sense that I explicitly use NTL and FLINT which themselves use gmp.   Because of this I was told some time last year I should remove gmp from eclib's official dependency list, which I did but the install script did not change accordginly.

Peronally I think it is more useful to people if the dependencies are list of packages which need to be installed before building eclib, but I suppose if I really meant that I would need to include a lot more system libraries etc so that would be silly.

I will fix it!  But I would like to find out why the doctest output is not deterministic first.

Since the output differs by torsion points, mathematically it's still correct (see also my reviewer patch).

It's hard to say what's best. Personally, I would vote to keep the GMP/MPIR dependency explicit and keep the `--with-gmp` option as before. But for Sage it doesn't really matter, you just need to make `spkg-install` and upstream consistent.

I'll set to "needs review" again when I have done my own testing.

OK, ready for review again.  The last commit was necessary not because I had forgotten, but because I did actually change the upstream tarball.  The one on sagemath is the right one -- note that I did change the version from 20140126 to 20140128 too.

I built this ok with SAGE_CHECK=yes and also ran all doctests including the long ones.

The self-test which eclib runs does not work perfectly when done with a lot of parallel threads owing (I presume) to race conditions.  I had errors with MAKE set to "make -j50" but none without the -j50 tag.  I think this was true before, so hope it will not be seen as a problem.

Are you open to bug reports about that? I have had a quick look and the problem seems to be that most programs are actually built *twice* in `make check` (check the logs, you will see for example `tmrank` is built twice, which can obviously be a race condition if that happens twice at the same time).

I have had a quick look and the problem seems to be that most programs are actually built *twice* in `make check` (check the logs, you will see for example `tmrank` is built twice, which can obviously be a race condition if that happens twice at the same time).

Of course I am open to bug reports!   It's up to you whether you think they are reasons not to include this version in Sage.  But if easily fixed, now would be a good time to fix them.

I know of no reason ahy any test program should be built twice.  If I delete etsts/tmrank and type "make tmrank" I see this:

```
/bin/bash ../libtool --tag=CXX   --mode=link g++  -g -O2 -L/usr/local/lib   -L/usr/lib  -o tmrank tmrank.o  ../libsrc/libec.la -lflint -lpari -lntl -lboost_system-mt -lboost_thread 
libtool: link: g++ -g -O2 -o .libs/tmrank tmrank.o  -L/usr/local/lib -L/usr/lib ../libsrc/.libs/libec.so -lflint -lpari /usr/local/lib/libntl.so -lboost_system-mt -lboost_thread -Wl,-rpath -Wl,/home/jec/eclib-parallel/lib
```
but surely that is only one build?

Apart from building, some of the tests will only work properly if the are run in the correct sequence since one writes a temporary files which another needs to read.  So far this has worked ok, but it would be possible to change the target `check_g0n` in tests/Makefile.am to forece them to run in order.  That would be easy, in fact.  None of the other check targets have this defect.
