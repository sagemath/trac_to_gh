This is a [documented](http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html#xrange) restriction on `xrange` and sage's code will only run into it in situations where the full iterator would never be exhausted (implementation uses `xrange(icount)`). Compare:

```
sage: for _ in xsrange(Integer(2^63-10), Integer(2^63)): pass #no problem
sage: for _ in xrange(Integer(2^63-10), Integer(2^63)): pass
OverflowError: Python int too large to convert to C long
```
so the question is really whether `xsrange` should also be usable to create (effectively) infinite arithmetic progressions. Incidentally, `xrange` and `xsrange` model different kinds of objects: `xrange` implements `__getitem__` and `__iter__` but not `next`, so it's really just modelling a finite arithmetic progression as (something close to) a list, whereas `xsrange` is a generator expression, i.e., an iterator:

```
sage: xrange(2^63-1)[2^33]
8589934592
sage: xsrange(2^63-1)[2^33]
TypeError: 'generator' object has no attribute '__getitem__'
```
