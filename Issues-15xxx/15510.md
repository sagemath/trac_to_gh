I think that `spkg-install` should probably have the boilerplate code

```bash

   echo "SAGE_LOCAL undefined ... exiting";
   echo "Maybe run 'sage -sh'?"
   exit 1

I get lots of test failures (probably whenever importing somethnig)

```
File "src/doc/en/prep/Quickstarts/Interact.rst", line 31, in doc.en.prep.Quickstarts.Interact
Failed example:
    plot(x^2,(x,-3,3))
Expected nothing
Got:
    doctest:974: UserWarning: /home/release/.python-eggs is writable by group/others and vulnerable to attack when used with get_resource_filename. Consider a more secure location (set with .set_extraction_path or the PYTHON_EGG_CACHE environment variable).
```
My home directory is (why does setuptools even create that directory?)

```
$ ll -d ~/.python-eggs
drwxrwxr-x. 1 release release 78 Feb  1 23:22 /home/release/.python-eggs
```
so it is entirely intentional that it is group writeable.
