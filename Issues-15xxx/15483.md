[See #15608 for a list of open simon_two_descent tickets]

The following tries to do 2-descent on an elliptic curve over a quadratic field:

```
K.<s>=QuadraticField(229)
c4=2173-235*(1-s)/2
c6=-124369+15988*(1-s)/2
E=EllipticCurve([-c4/48,-c6/864])
E.simon_two_descent()
```
It fails with a `RuntimeError`:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
RuntimeError: 
  ***   at top-level: ans=bnfellrank(K,[0,0,0,
  ***                     ^--------------------

  ***   ^--------------------

  ***   [1];if(DEBUGLEVEL_el
  ***   ^--------------------
  ***   array index (1) out of allowed range [none].
An error occurred while running Simon's 2-descent program
```
The problem is apparently that the square root of `norm(zc)` (which is indeed a square) is not computed due to a precision bug; see [comment:7](#comment%3A7) below.

There are many similar bug reports with separate trac tickets.  I have no idea if this is a new bug or not.  Anyway, the version Sage has of DS's scripts are not the most recent one so there is no point in reporting this back to him unless you check that it happens with the scripts on his web page and you email him without mentioning Sage, otherwise he will just assume that the problem lies with Sage (which is possible).

Several of us spend hours or even days in 2011 sage Days (more than one) working on this sort of thing and gave up.  We were trying to do more, namely rewrite the interface so that it can use a gp2c-compiled version of the scripts.  One day I'll have another go at that.

Meanwhile, this entry is to make sure that no-one wastes any time at all looking into the versions of the scripts which Sage currently includes;  you should test against the current versions.

I searched for other tickets related to Simon's code and did not find reports of this particular problem.  We should first upgrade to the latest version of his script and then see which of the various problems listed at #11041 persist.  I added this ticket to that list for easier reference.

Lorenzini reported me a similar bug and I had a look. I now believe that this is a bug in Simon's script as I can reproduce it outside sage. I used the version of his file dated 06/04/2011, which is the newest I found on the web, while sage has one dated the 25/03/2009. So besides that bug, the file needs to be updated anyway. I tried both in sage's gp (2.5.5) and the current alpha (2.6.1).

I send an email to Denis and see if and how fast we can hope for a solution of this. Otherwise, I may at least update the script, later.

Lorenzini's example is a bit simpler:

```
R.<t> = QQ[]
L.<g> = NumberField(t^3 - 9*t^2 + 13*t - 4)
E1 = EllipticCurve(L,[1-g*(g-1),-g^2*(g-1),-g^2*(g-1),0,0])
E1.rank()
```

The basic problem seems to be that PARI is too optimistic about the resulting precision when adding real numbers:

If you want to do it, go ahead, but to be honest, it seems a bit pointless to me at the moment.

Although I agreed above that the increase from 10 to 38 in the precision check was just a hack, there is actually a reason for the 38.  (The following assumes a 64-bit word length.)
