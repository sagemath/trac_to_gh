Some Graph functions are not made to handle non-simple graphs, i.e. graphs containing loops or multiple edges. This ticket adds necessary exceptions from place to place, hoping no error remains ignored.

The exception advises the user to remove loops/multiple edges from his graph and try again (and to update the function if he thinks that not supporting non-simple graphs is a mistake) `:-P`

This has been reported on sage-support fairly recently [1], and thousands of times before. Past time to deal with those wrong answers `:-/`

Looks like `DiGraph.is_directed_acylic` actually has no problems with loops. The exception broke a doctest in `rings/semirings/non_negative_integer_semiring.py`.

Fixed !
