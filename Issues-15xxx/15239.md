Here's a corrected test indicating the problem:

```
sage: X = toric_varieties.WP([1,4,2,3], names='z0 z1 z2 z3')
sage: X.inject_variables()
Defining z0, z1, z2, z3
sage: g0 =z1^3 + z2^6 +z3^4
sage: g = g0-2*z3^2*z0^6+z2*z0^10+z0^12
sage: hyp = X.subscheme([g])
sage: hyp.is_nondegenerate() # Should return False per Hamm
True
```

so that it wraps at 79 characters (even though here 72 is preferred)

```
sage: F = z0^2*z1^2*z2^2 + z1^2*z2^2*z3^2 + z0^2*z2^2*z4^2\

and the other two lines in the documentation that are too long, I'll give it a positive review.
