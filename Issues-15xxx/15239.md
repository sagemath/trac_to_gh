Nondegeneracy is a weaker version of smoothness, that is actually comparatively easy to implement (relative to the existing `is_smooth`). This branch implements the non-degeneracy check.

Compare Example 3.2.5 of Helmut A. Hamm, "Differential forms and Hodge numbers for toric complete intersections" ( http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.1826 ).  That example gives a hypersurface that is not non-degenerate.  It's worked out in a patch, but I think the following test with a homogeneous polynomial is equivalent:

```

X = toric_varieties.WP([1,4,2,3], names='z0 z1 z2 z3')

X.inject_variables()

g0 =z1^3 + z2^6 +z3^4

g = g0-2*z2^3*z0^6+z2*z0^10+z0^12

hyp = X.subscheme([g])
```


Right now, hyp.is_nondegenerate() returns True, but Hamm says it should return False.  The problem may be that the current code only checks at top-dimensional cones, rather than checking at all cones in the fan?

To add some urgency to this, Edgar Costa, David Harvey, and I are working on computing zeta functions of nondegenerate hypersurfaces using p-adic cohomology, so we would find this routine very useful.

I don't really know how polytopes work in Sage, but it certainly looks like the code iterates over cones of all dimensions in the fan. Maybe there's a problem with the test for individual cones?

Here's a corrected test indicating the problem:

```
sage: X = toric_varieties.WP([1,4,2,3], names='z0 z1 z2 z3')
sage: X.inject_variables()
Defining z0, z1, z2, z3
sage: g0 =z1^3 + z2^6 +z3^4
sage: g = g0-2*z3^2*z0^6+z2*z0^10+z0^12
sage: hyp = X.subscheme([g])
sage: hyp.is_nondegenerate() # Should return False per Hamm
True
```

There are also some subtleties surrounding the underlying mathematical concept. In particular, I would also take issue with this doctest:

```
sage: P1 = toric_varieties.P1()
sage: X = toric_varieties.P2_112().cartesian_product(P1)
sage: X.inject_variables()
Defining z0, z1, z2, z3, z4
sage: Y = X.subscheme([z4])    # = P2_112 x {point}
sage: Y.is_nondegenerate()
True
```
As far as I understand, nondegeneracy is only defined when you have a local complete intersection, and then the condition is that the intersection with each stratifying torus should be transversal. That's stronger than saying that the intersection should be lci, as in this example: the intersection of a smooth variety with itself is smooth but not transversal.

This looks good.  If you change:

```
sage: F = z0^2*z1^2*z2^2 + z1^2*z2^2*z3^2 + z0^2*z2^2*z4^2 + z2^2*z3^2*z4^2 +\
....: t*z0*z1*z2*z3*z4*z5 + z0^2*z1^2*z5^2 + z1^2*z3^2*z5^2 +\
....: z0^2*z4^2*z5^2 + z3^2*z4^2*z5^2
```

so that it wraps at 79 characters (even though here 72 is preferred)

```
sage: F = z0^2*z1^2*z2^2 + z1^2*z2^2*z3^2 + z0^2*z2^2*z4^2\
....: + z2^2*z3^2*z4^2 + t*z0*z1*z2*z3*z4*z5 + z0^2*z1^2*z5^2\
....: + z1^2*z3^2*z5^2 + z0^2*z4^2*z5^2 + z3^2*z4^2*z5^2
```

and the other two lines in the documentation that are too long, I'll give it a positive review.
