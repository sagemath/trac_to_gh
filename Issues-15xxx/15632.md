Hello!

I recently needed to decide whether some large graphs contain the Petersen graph P. As it turned out the task was time consuming since almost none of the graphs contained P.

My original graphs had many vertices of degree 1 and 2 but apparently subgraph_search does not make use of this. The above optimization was a big improvement for this scenario

```
def subgraph_search_wrapper(G, H):
    G2 = G.copy()
    d = min(H.degree())
    while min(G2.degree()) < d:
       G2.delete_vertices([v for v in G2 if G2.degree(v) < c])
    return G2.subgraph_search(H)
```

as an example

```
sage: %timeit G.subgraph_search(H)
1 loops, best of 3: 41.9 s per loop
sage: %timeit subgraph_search_wrapper(G, H)
10 loops, best of 3: 78 ms per loop
```

While I think the above optimization is valid I believe there has to be a more proper way to implement it (perhaps in generic_graph.pyx?) hence I leave this here for further discussion by you guys.

Best,

Jernej

You can use the k-core of G instead, with k=min(H.degree()). So the pre-processing could be like:

```
 k = min(H.degree())
 if k>min(G.degree()):
    cores = G.cores(with_labels=True)
    G2 = G.subgraph([u for u in cores if cores[u]>=k])
 else:
    G2 = G
 return G2.subgraph_search(H)
```

Hellooooooo !

David's suggestion is the right one for your problem.

I have to add that I would be glad to improve some algorithms in Sage, but that I can only do this if I am allowed to. In particular, it would be quite nice if somebody could review #14589, for it *can* definitely help to improve the performances of algorithms like `subgraph_search`.
