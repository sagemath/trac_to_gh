According to Peter Bruin, a possible fix is to use pari:

*Well, it should also be fixed for a RealField of higher precision.  An easy solution for that is to use PARI, which uses a numerically more stable algorithm (Gaussian elimination, choosing pivots of maximal absolute value; I don't know about proven error bounds).  Example:*

```
sage: A._pari_().matdet()
16801.7979988279  # same as when doing the computation over QQ
```
*Sage's determinant() already uses PARI over Z/nZ for n less than the machine word size; it would be trivial to adapt it to work also over the reals.*

According to Dima, the fix should be:

''Is the default choice of the algorithm the right one?
One can see that ''

```
sage: A.determinant(algorithm="hessenberg")
16801.7979988558
```
*is quite good...  *

''
Sage computes det() by computing charpoly(0), too... The division-free algorithm is obviously meant for more general setting of rings, not fields. I don't know why it was made default here, perhaps just an oversight.''
