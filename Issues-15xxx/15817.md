Using a new algorithm from the hells, I try to check my results with the current implementation of Moliens series... And I fall on this

```
sage: G = PermutationGroup([[(1,2,3,4)]])
sage: S4 = SymmetricGroup(4)
sage: secondary_enumeration_polynomial(G)
q^5 + 2*q^4 + q^3 + q^2 + 1
sage: G.molien_series() / S4.molien_series()
x^5 + 2*x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + 1
sage: G = PermutationGroup([[(1,2)],[(3,4)]])
sage: secondary_enumeration_polynomial(G)
q^4 + q^3 + 2*q^2 + q + 1
sage: G.molien_series() / S4.molien_series()
-x^5 - x^3 + x^2 + 1
```

`secondary_enumeration_polynomial` is my new function (which I hope, compute the degree of secondary invariants polynomial associated to the symmetric polynomial as primary invariants)... The quotient of the two series MUST BE a polynomial with positive coefficients since the theory says that for any subgroup `G` of `S_n`, the ring of invariant under the action of `G` is a free module over the ring of symmetric polynomials.

I am also very sorry to not taking care of this bug but :
- I really don't know the pieces of Gap which are used to compute moliens_series (or I don't understand the source code of the method in other words...)
- My another approach is for sure not so efficient compare to that Gap probably provide and depends on very large pieces of personal and drafty code I only wrote for personal research.

<a id='comment:6'></a>Thanks you for this pointer, that's probably a nice first point to investigate.

I also admit on my side that I am not on the way to fix that. Also, this ticket is not a defect on my point of view (Yeah, I wrongly opened it...) since :
* One can re-status this ticket to enhancement since one can want to add the Moliens series for non transitive group. That would constitute a new enhancement.
* The documentation (when you write it before opening ticket, as I should do!!!!!!!) tells clearly :

```
Returns the Molien series of a transitive permutation group.
```
So, the only things one can do to prevent dummy user to open ticket is to add a check that make the call explicitly crashing. I worngly opened this ticket since that works :

```
sage: G = PermutationGroup([[(1,2)],[(3,4)]])
sage: G.molien_series()
1/(-x^5 + x^4 + 2*x^3 - 2*x^2 - x + 1)
```
Perhaps a check making that would be fine :

```
sage: G = PermutationGroup([[(1,2)],[(3,4)]])
sage: G.molien_series()
Traceback :
...
Valuerror : G = (bla bla bla) must be a transitive group. (please implement me if you can for the general case ...)
```

<a id='comment:9'></a>Hello,

I am terribly sorry but I REALLY NEED more sage days to review that. For the math review, I am OK with the fix but my computer is in a state (severals gcc version in concurrence...) in which I do not manage to build sage from source. I manage to upgrade a Sage 6.2.beta7 to Sage 6.3 but a git trac checkout 15817 make this upgrade broken... I need to visit Florent and Nicolas to get help with git and sage (or perhaps I need to reinstall a clear Linux system...). Sorry.

Here is 3 typical tests (quotient of Moliens series by the Hilbert series of the ring of symmetric polynomials) which I engage myself to be true math results :

```
sage: load("invariants.py")
sage: G = PermutationGroup([[(1,2,3)], [(5,6)]])
sage: secondary_enumeration_polynomial(G)
q^14 + 2*q^13 + 4*q^12 + 7*q^11 + 10*q^10 + 13*q^9 + 15*q^8 + 16*q^7 + 15*q^6 + 13*q^5 + 10*q^4 + 7*q^3 + 4*q^2 + 2*q + 1
sage: G = PermutationGroup([[(1,2,3)], [(2,3,4)], [(5,6)]])
sage: secondary_enumeration_polynomial(G)
q^14 + q^13 + 2*q^12 + 2*q^11 + 3*q^10 + 2*q^9 + 3*q^8 + 2*q^7 + 3*q^6 + 2*q^5 + 3*q^4 + 2*q^3 + 2*q^2 + q + 1
sage: G = PermutationGroup([[(5,)]])
sage: secondary_enumeration_polynomial(G)
q^10 + 4*q^9 + 9*q^8 + 15*q^7 + 20*q^6 + 22*q^5 + 20*q^4 + 15*q^3 + 9*q^2 + 4*q + 1
```

I will stay around but if someone can REALLY try the branch on a working sage install, it will be better.

Yes, I think that is why the last code was restricted to transitive group. Anyway, the Moliens series is WELL defined for a finite group of matrices. So, for the trivial group, it depends how you see it as a group of matrices.

Here, my PermutationGroup([This is the Trac macro ** that was inherited from the migration called with arguments (5,))](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#-macro)) forces to see it as a subgroup of the symmetric group of order 5 and my result correspond exactly to the q analogue of n! for n=5 (which give the dimension degree by degree of the co-invariant of S_5)

```
sage: G = PermutationGroup ([[(5,)]])
sage: secondary_enumeration_polynomial(G)
q^10 + 4*q^9 + 9*q^8 + 15*q^7 + 20*q^6 + 22*q^5 + 20*q^4 + 15*q^3 + 9*q^2 + 4*q + 1
sage: from sage.combinat.q_analogues import q_factorial
sage: q_factorial(5)
q^10 + 4*q^9 + 9*q^8 + 15*q^7 + 20*q^6 + 22*q^5 + 20*q^4 + 15*q^3 + 9*q^2 + 4*q + 1
```

My last one example should be check with

```
sage: G = PermutationGroup([[(5,)]])
sage: G.degree()
5
sage: G.molien_series() / SymmetricGroup(5).molien_series()
.....
```

If I remember correctly, there are some other place in Sage in which fixed point did produce problems.
