This adds methods to `partition.py` and `skew_partition.py` that take a partition to its corresponding poset. The user can choose the orientation of the poset from currently 4 geographical ones (if anyone knows some more -- let me know).

Depends on #15350

I agree that there is a natural correspondance between a tableau (or more generally filling) and a poset. So having a poset method in tableaux definitely makes sense.

Here the process is more about getting from a partition to a tableaux (or filling) using some filling scheme, and then asking for the poset. It would be natural for the invokation to reflect that:

```
    sage: P = Partition(...)
    sage: P.tableau(orientation).poset()          # or P.filling(orientation)
```

If you believe a shorthand for the above really brings something to the user, please find something more explicit than just `poset`.

In general: I am super glad of all the work you are both puting into Sage, and all the progress that comes from the pair of you crossreviewing. But please keep in mind that we will have to maintain the code in the long run; so think *really, really* hard about good user interface and conciseness.

Thanks guys! Keep it up!

Hi Nicholas,

what exactly should the `poset()` method on tableaux do? The way I understand the situation, the poset really comes from the *diagram*. I could imagine relabelling it according to the entries in a permutation tableau, but that's not the way I was thinking about it. If I correctly understand your proposal, my `P.poset(orientation="SE")` would be something like `P.superstandard_tableau().poset()` in your syntax, which is quite roundabout in my opinion since the superstandard tableau (the tableau in which you put 1, 2, ..., |P| just row by row) is a red herring to my construction (it could just as well be the co-superstandard one, where you proceed column by column; it is certainly not canonical). But TBH the main reason why I don't want to change things right now is that I want `tableaux.py` to be redone by myself or someone else (IIRC we have discussed this long ago, and I'd be happy to discuss this again, though I probably can't meet your demands on speed and MuPAD-combinat code reuse -- my goals are more about getting `skew_tableau` closer to `tableaux`'s feature completeness, and about implementing plane partitions and some variations of my own) and I'm not very keen on using the current implementation where it isn't absolutely necessary.

Best regards,\\
Darij

    "body": "<div id=\"comment:8\" align=\"right\">comment:8</div>\n\nOOPS, I was stupid: With your convention, `P.poset()` would not be `P.superstandard_tableau().poset()` but rather something like `P.tautological_tableau().poset()`, where `tautological_tableau()` puts the pair of the coordinates of each cell into that cell (another function that probably needs to be made). For this method to generalize to arbitrary tableaux, though, one would have to check that all entries are pairwise distinct, which is a waste of time (OK, so a `check` variable?). But to be honest, I'd very much prefer to have this method defined on partitions first and later maybe add it to tableaux as well. If I were to search for it, I would definitely not have started by constructing a tableau out of `p`...",

OOPS, I was stupid: With your convention, `P.poset()` would not be `P.superstandard_tableau().poset()` but rather something like `P.tautological_tableau().poset()`, where `tautological_tableau()` puts the pair of the coordinates of each cell into that cell (another function that probably needs to be made). For this method to generalize to arbitrary tableaux, though, one would have to check that all entries are pairwise distinct, which is a waste of time (OK, so a `check` variable?). But to be honest, I'd very much prefer to have this method defined on partitions first and later maybe add it to tableaux as well. If I were to search for it, I would definitely not have started by constructing a tableau out of `p`...

Hi Darij,

I think Nicolas' point is that it is more natural to define posets associated to tableaux than partitions. The partition poset that you implemented could then be easily obtained from that. You could use

```
sage: t = Tableau([[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7]])
sage: t.cells_containing(1)
[(0, 0)]
```
to label the cells by their coordinates. In Sage we should have general purpose methods rather than very specific methods. If I understand correctly, this is his point!

Anne

PS: I do not understand your comment that all entries are pairwise distinct. Cells inside a tableau/partition are always all distinct.

Ok, I had missed the fact that the poset you created was indexed by the cells (i,j). That's a reasonable reason to put at least a shorthand in partition. 

I let you chose the final design and timeline (for this ticket or later) for the best, knowing that:

- Having a method on standard fillings that build the poset would be generally useful

- Having a method on partitions building a standard filling containing the coordinates of the cells could be useful elsewhere.

- The cost of checking that all entries of a filling are distinct and hashable is really negligible compared to that of building a poset.

- I for myself would not have looked for such a method in Partition in the first place :-)

- The name "poset", for a partition, is not explicit enough. I would need to read the documentation to know which poset this is about.

Cheers,

About the DRYness, what exactly would you factor out? What do you mean by "indexing" rows and columns?

About the `orientation` keyword, I can replace it by two booleans `left_is_bigger` and `top_is_bigger`. What do you think about it? (Haven't done this change so far.)

Oh, now I see the misunderstanding; I thought the option was about the
indexing of the cells, ... Which indeed was stupid (same poset). Never
mind.

To make your code DRY, you could build two lists horizontal_covers and
vertical_covers, then, depending on the options, map a reverse on them:

```
if ...:
    horizontal_covers = [ (j,i) for (i,j) in horizontal_covers ]
if ...:
    vertical_covers = [ (j,i) for (i,j) in vertical_covers ]
```


> About the `orientation` keyword, I can replace it by two booleans
> `left_is_bigger` and `top_is_bigger`. What do you think about it?
> (Haven't done this change so far.)

For consistency, I would tend to favor non boolean options like
horiz="left" / "right" (we have a bunch of them e.g. in the Coxeter
code). But I don't have great suggestions for the option names
themselves.

Cheers,
                      Nicolas

I'd say: too early of an optimization. Especially since the above
timing is actually pretty ridiculous: wtf, 1 ms to build a trivial
poset? I very much hope this will be improved a lot in the future; but
that's a different story. Btw: %timeit is does not measure things well
for objects with unique representation, or in general whenever there
is a cache involved.

At this point, just focus on expressive and duplication free code. Use
covers if it's easier. I know you can find a solution :-)

I agree. My point was more about separation of concerns (up/down,
left/right). In any cases, there is no clear cut solution and I just
meant to hint at possible directions. I let you take the final
judgment call!

Attachment: **[trac_15428-partition-posets-dg.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket15428/trac_15428-partition-posets-dg.patch.gz)**

I've replaced NW by SE in the doc.

About %timeit not seeing the advantages of UniqueRepresentation: I kind of expected it, but I don't really know how to measure the timing right (I asked something similar on sage-devel a week ago). Maybe this:

```
sage: %timeit [Poset({1: [2,3], 2: [4,5], 5: [6,7,8]}) for i in range(12)]
1 loops, best of 3: 15.5 ms per loop
sage: %timeit [Poset([[1,2],[1,3],[2,4],[2,5],[5,6],[5,7],[5,8]]) for i in range(12)]
10 loops, best of 3: 21.2 ms per loop
```
I think that even when we speed up `Poset.__init__` -- *particularly* when we speed it up -- the difference between a dictionary and a list input will become more noticeable. I'm pretty sure that the dictionary is the form that makes it easier to compute the poset because lookup is faster. Or not?

I don't think that separating the `orientation` variable is really separation of concerns -- there is much more similarities between SE and NW than between SE and NE (for example).

The conversion from a list to a dictionary is orders of magnitude
faster than the creation of a poset:

```
sage: l = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,4],[2,5],[5,6],[5,7],[5,8]]
sage: %timeit dict(l)
100000 loops, best of 3: 3.76 us per loop
```

So, don't worry about this at this point.

Fair enough :-)
