In the iterator for generating standard tableaux the lexicographically last tableau is re-recomputed every time the iterator yields. Taking this out leads to a small speed improvements when generating moderately large sets of tableaux:

The following table shows the timings for

```
    sage: for n in range(5,15):
    ....:     timeit("StandardTableaux(n)[:];",number=6)
```
before and after the patch:

| **n**  |    **Before**    | **After** |
|:--------|:------------------:|:-----------:|
| 5|    6.2ms|  5.4ms|
| 6|   14.0ms| 12.4ms|
| 7|   43.3ms| 40.5ms|
| 8|    151ms|  140ms|
| 9|    558ms|  509ms|
|10|    2.14s|  1.97s|
|11|    8.56s|  7.82s|
|12|    35.4s| 34.55s|
|13|  161.57s|145.11s|
|14|  711.13s|633.93s|
These timings were done on my laptop, a macbook pro running sage 6.0. (Actually, the last two sets were done with just one timing:)
