The patch coming with this ticket is a multidimensional numerical integrator, which uses calls to the Cuba library (http://www.feynarts.de/cuba/), or in case of 1-dim integrals, it defaults to the GSL numerical_integral. 

The attached code also has an option to try to reduce the dimensionality of the integral by first trying a (multithreaded) symbolic evaluation. 

To make the integral evaluation fast, the code first makes an honest effort to compile the integrand (either using _fast_float_ or cython, depending on the input).

The code can output verbose information on all intermediate steps (including the resulting cython code to be compiled; results from the symbolic preprocessing, etc.), which tries to make the evaluation as transparent as possible. This should allow both for debugging, as well as for optimizing the input integrand in slow-to-converge cases.

For most cases I tested it, this implementation is faster than Mathematica's NIntegrate thanks to Cuba and the included symbolic preprocessor.

Note that the patch requires the Cuba library to be installed for Sage. So, I am attaching Cuba as a spkg package with this ticket as well. That spkg package needs to be installed first before building sage with the patch.

LGPL is fine.

If you want to touch cuba's build system at all, it would be nice to
transition to libtool / automake. There shouldn't be any hand-crafted
`makefile.in`, it should be autogenerated from `Makefile.am`. Its
basically impossible to generate shared libaries by hand. I'm pretty
sure your `makefile.in` won't work on OSX and Solaris. But for
starters, you tould just use the cuba static library (static libraries
suck, but we could leave enabling shared libraries for the future...)

The code should go into `sage.libs.cuba`, either a separate directory
or just `sage/libs/cuba.pyx`. Don't add a copy of the cuba header to
the Sage library, include the installed header (see `make install`). 

The Sage library code is supposed to make at least an attempt to keep
lines at <= 80 chars. Its acceptable to have longer lines, but only if
it is necessary to improve readability. E.g. comments and docstrings
very rarely have any excuse to be longer than that. In emacs reflowing
a paragraph of text is Meta-q (Alt + 'q'), e.g.

Also, PEP8 spacing would be nice.

Line breaks in the doctest should use the new syntax `....:`:

```
    sage: foo(123,
    ....:     456)
```

The `multidim_integration` function is 1000+ lines long. It really
needs to be refactored into subroutines of reasonable size. 

Use `SR.symbol()` for temporary variables whose name you don't care about.

The whole functionality to compile a symbolic expression into C code
is nice but unrelated to cuba. It should be moved elsewhere (probably
somewhere in `sage.ext`). It is also sufficiently independed as a task
that it could be a separate ticket, you could first implement cuba
with `fast_float` and later add the C/cython callable as an optimization.

Maybe at some point I'd think about extending that part of the code into a separate utility, but it will not happen now. However, I agree that that piece of the code can be moved to a separate function within the cuba lib. So, I did that, but again, only within the cuba lib. Also, note that of the original 1000+ lines of multidim_integration, 600 are in fact documentation; and the majority of the remaining 400 lines are simply sanity checks and printing debugging information, which should be pretty self-explanatory ...

Hello all,

Thank you so much for your prompt comments! I hope I address them at least so-so below. I updated the attached patch and spkg files accordingly.

As sort of an excuse, I wanted to say that actually this is my first python (and Sage) code ever, so bear with me ... Here it goes point by point.

1. Now, about modularity. Yes, it would be nice if compiling into C can be made automatic for any task (for people who do not want to bother with cython), but I don't think I am up for that task.

However, I agree that that piece of the code can be moved to a separate function within the cuba lib. So, I did that, but again, only within the cuba lib. Also, note that of the original 1000+ lines of multidim_integration, 600 are in fact documentation; and the majority of the remaining 400 lines are simply sanity checks and printing debugging information, which should be pretty self-explanatory ... I'd hope... But ok, I still split the code :)


2. Nathann Cohen suggested that I should add .rst documentation. I tried adding that in doc/en/reference, but hg says those changes are ignored. Suggestions?


Cheers!

As an interface that is presentable to the end-user I would propose

```
sage: integral.symbolic(...)
sage: integral.numerical(...)
sage: integral.multidim(...)
sage: integral.multidim_numerical(...)
sage: integral(...)   # auto-guess
```
The cuba library interface shouldn't do any symbolic integration. That is not only unrelated, most numerical options also don't make sense for symbolic integration.

* `fast_callable` should be used instead of the older `fast_float`.

* The C source code generation should be factored out and doctested separately.

* library code shoudn't use `sage_eval`. 

* Catch-all `except:` statements are not allowed -- could be `KeyboardInterrupt`, for example.

* Docstrings in Python should be imperative: "Return foo" instead of "Returns foo".

Let me for now address only your first comment, since the rest are secondary issues.

I completely agree with you that such a split of the interface must eventually happen. However, at the practical level, I do not think it is within the range of my current sage abilities or that I have enough motivation to do it. Here is why:

I've had way too many issues with integrate() to even start thinking about a multidimensional symbolic integrator. Here is a laundry list of problems I've faced in case anybody cares to take up the problem:

1. If there are parameters in the integral then there is no easy way to pass answers to maxima, when it starts asking "Is <expression> positive, negative or zero?", when <expression> is some mess (which usually implies that using assume() to fix it won't work), which for multidimensional integrals is what you usually get in my experience. If there are no parameters, then all you care about is getting some number -- so, there is not much point in the analytical answer itself (in my opinion of course).

2. In many cases I tried (after transforming to the unit cube), maxima gives back an answer only once I avoid the boundaries of the interval and use the principal value of the integral. But to avoid them I need to introduce an epsilon,i.e. a parameter -- which brings me back to point 1 above.

3. sympy.integrate is actually in many cases much nicer (in my opinion), giving back piecewise answers, having a somewhat better handle on special functions such as Ci(x), etc. But sage doesn't support the piecewise answers; and SR(sympy.Ci(x)) gives an error, even though sage has Ci(x). E.g. try this: integrate(cos(x)/x,x,algorithm='sympy')

4. If the analytical integral is not doable, then the question remains what should the symbolic result be. Just the first function ``multidim_analytical_integration_unit_cube`` returns? Or all of its results as a list? And handling anything but constant intervals (as over the unit cube in the current implementation) becomes somewhat of a mess, unless you transform your intervals to the unit cube. But in that latter case, simple integrands with simple (but non-numeric) integration intervals very often become horrible messes when transformed to the unit cube, which even Mathematica can't handle.

So, really, the current ``multidim_analytical_integration_unit_cube`` is the best I can hope for for now. And as a comparison, Mathematica also has such a SymbolicProcessing option for its NIntegrate, which (at least at the user level) has nothing to do with doing multidimensional integrals with Integrate. 

So, maybe a compromise would be simply to hide ``multidim_analytical_integration_unit_cube`` with an underscore and not advertise it at all to the end-user? Let me know what you think.

I don't have a good answer to symbolic integration, as you say symbolic multi-dimensional integration is usually a mess unless there is some symmetry to exploit. 

As for 4), you can have un-evaluated symbolic expressions:

```
sage: x.add(x, hold=True)
x + x
sage: sage.symbolic.integration.integral.indefinite_integral(x, x, hold=True)
integrate(x, x)
```

So my suggestion is (and thats what I meant to say initially) to just focus on the numerical integration and interfacing with cuba here. Anything else can go to a separate ticket. We don't even have to think too much about a user-interface yet, which is what you have done anyways in the current version where you have to explicitly `import from sage.libs.cuba`.

Thank you for all the useful comments, Volker!

Below are my modifications in response to your comments.

Best,
Svetlin



* `fast_callable` should be used instead of the older `fast_float`.

-- Done.

* The C source code generation should be factored out and doctested
 separately.

-- moved to new file: cython_compilation.pyx and tested.

* Dynamically loaded modules should be wrapped in some object (maybe
 `CythonCallable`) and unloaded when finished (i.e. destroyed). Otherwise
 its leaking memory...

-- There are no dynamically loaded modules in the code (at least as far as I understand the definition). I moved all of them to top level so that loading modules does not slow down the code.

* library code shoudn't use `sage_eval`.

-- switched to eval

* Catch-all `except:` statements are not allowed -- could be
 `KeyboardInterrupt`, for example.

-- fixed. Removed most try statements, which I realized I only needed in the code development. 

* Docstrings in Python should be imperative: "Return foo" instead of
  "Returns foo".

-- fixed.

* Ok, it wasn't clear to me that the symbolic preprocessing is that
  important. It is still unrelated to cuba, so how about moving it to
  `sage.libs.cuba.symbolic_preprocessing.py` or something like that?
  Otherwise it makes it just harder to debug and read the `cuba.pyx` file.
 
-- Thanks! Moved to new file: symbolic_preprocessing.pyx. Added underscore in front of ``_multidim_analytical_integration_unit_cube``.

* Similar for C/Cython source code generation.

-- Moved to new file: cython_compilation.pyx 

* It also would be nice to split up `multidim_integration` some more. For
  example, the entire `if (symbolic)` block would be much better as a
  separate function: Makes `multidim_integration` shorter and easier to read
  if you don't have to juggle with temporary variables `funcS`, `newvars`.
  E.g.

 ```
    if symbolic:
        try:
            return multidim_integration_symbolic(...)
        except SymbolicTimeout:
            pass
  ```

-- Cleaned that part of the code a lot. Temp vars were actually left over cruft, which I removed. Now that piece of the code just checks whether integrand is constant and returns; or not, and continues.


Also, made additional minor tweaks and fixed a bug I had introduced at some point for Python function integrands, and for which I was missing an important test.

+1 for having Monte-Carlo integration in Sage. 

I recently needed this functionality, and resorted to using the [Cubature package](http://ab-initio.mit.edu/wiki/index.php/Cubature); Python bindings [exist](https://github.com/saullocastro/cubature), and I found the interface quite nice. I guess the difficult part would be to rewrite [cubature.py](https://github.com/saullocastro/cubature/blob/master/cubature/cubature.py#L23) for Sage..
