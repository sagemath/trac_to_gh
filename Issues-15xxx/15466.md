<a id='comment:4'></a>Hi Nathann, thanks for starting this (or should that be thaaaaaaaaaaaanks!:).

I found a few more depreciated [sic] functions to remove in the words subdirectory and I moved a few import statements of `deprecation` so that they are now immediately above the function call. This will help ensure that there are no stray `deprecation` import statements left when the corresponding soon-to-be-depreciated code is removed. Finally, I killed off some documentation for some functions that are removed by this patch.

If you are happy with my changes let's make this a positive review. I've bumped the version number to 6 since we're using git.

[ps I have checked all of the doctsts in sage/combinat. I do get a doctext failure in `root_system/coxeter_group.py` but I get the same failure in master, so I think it has nothing to do with this ticket.]

GoodGoodGood !

Argggg ! Nice job spotting that `;-)`

By the way : these days I use the --warn-links flag when building the doc. It tells you whenever some links are made toward non-existent functions. I guess it will be useful to spot things like that in the future, when this --warn-links will be a default, though right now there are too many broken lins in Sage to make it the default `:-)`

> If you are happy with my changes let's make this a positive review. I've bumped the version number to 6 since we're using git.


The tests passed while I was reading the patch. Good to go, thanks `:-)`

> [ps I have checked all of the doctsts in sage/combinat. I do get a doctext failure in `root_system/coxeter_group.py` but I get the same failure in master, so I think it has nothing to do with this ticket.]


Hmmmmm.. I don't get this error. Though at some point Volker told me that I should run "make" again in Sage's directory to update the spkg which may have changed since. Do give it a try when you don't need to use Sage for a while (it will recompile a lot of things). I used to have a couple of broken doctests, and it solved it !

Thank you again, and positive review to this patch ! `;-)`
