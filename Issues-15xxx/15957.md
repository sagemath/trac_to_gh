Follow up to #12661.

One can set `SAGE_MP_LIBRARY` to choose between GMP and MPIR when issueing `make`.

You are completely right, thanks!

> I am not sure we can fix minor differences in behavior.

Ok, I still don't like keeping around doctests that are know to fail, but I don't want to let the issue block this ticket.

> We can choose different tests in some case but the expected failure will be hard to replace.

What about something like

```
sage: try: 2^(2^63-2)
....: except MemoryError, RuntimeError: true
```
?

And does anyone understand if the output of the failing test in `sage/tests/book_stein_modform.py` is correct?

I guess the doctests issues (except for the memory one) are gone now that MPIR behaves just like GMP, see #15015.

If I rebase the ticket, would anyone be kind enough to review it?
Maybe I'll just simplify the ticket discarding the black magic to be able to change the MP lib you use.
Then you just choose which one you use the first time you build Sage and live with it.
Just like with SAGE_DEBUG.
