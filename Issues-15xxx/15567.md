Currently `Alphabet(oo, 'x')` returns `None`. This fixes that, along with some other improvements so that `Alphabet(NN, 'x')` also works as expected. This also uses the `name` argument in `(Lazy)Family` to override the name of the function for cleaner print statements.

Hello !

I don't know how this "names" argument is used at all, but its current behaviour is the following :

```
sage: build_alphabet(oo,'x')[4]                      
'x4'
sage: build_alphabet(range(40),'x')[4]
4
```

Which is not very consistent. While playing with it I found something else which totally scares me :

```
sage: build_alphabet(oo,'x')          
Lazy family (x(i))_{i in Non negative integers}
sage: build_alphabet(oo,'x')[:4]
'xslice(None, 4, None)'
sage: print list(build_alphabet(oo,'x')[:4])
['x', 's', 'l', 'i', 'c', 'e', '(', 'N', 'o', 'n', 'e', ',', ' ', '4', ',', ' ', 'N', 'o', 'n', 'e', ')']
```

While I expected to get the list of the first 4 elements. And I really do not know what to make with that `O_o`

Anyway, I think that the `build_alphabet` function could use a "INPUT" section explaining its parameters, and in particular the "names" field. Which, in the context of `build_alphabet(oo,'x')` would be better renamed to "prefix", as it adds this string to all members of the family.

It would be nice to say what exactlyl this function is supposed to return.

About the modifications to `Family` : 
* would it be possible to add to the documentation of "hidden_keys" an explanation of what exactly it does ? Does it mean that the hidden keys are "skipped", i.e. removed from "indices" ?
* the explanation of what `hidden_function` is isn't very clear either `O_o`

The fact that the "name" argument does nothing for finite lists should be made clear I guess. I mean, what is it useful for exactly ? Lazy Families only ?

```
sage: Family([0,0,0],function=lambda x:x,name="e")
Finite family {0: 0}
```

By the way, perhaps there should be in Sage something called "named function" somewhere `:-)`

This is also inconsistent input types (one is a "number", the other is a set). However the other could raise an error as invalid input as opposed to being silently ignored.

This is an issue with `Family` in that it is directly passing a string representation of the input of `__getitem__()` without any safety checks (for speed). It's outside the scope of what I want to do in this ticket and has a landmine of "you've picked a specific ordering of the indices that may not be canonical".

> Anyway, I think that the `build_alphabet` function could use a "INPUT" section explaining its parameters, and in particular the "names" field. Which, in the context of `build_alphabet(oo,'x')` would be better renamed to "prefix", as it adds this string to all members of the family.

I'll add it. Since "names" not (really) used anywhere else, I'll change it.

> About the modifications to `Family` : 
> * would it be possible to add to the documentation of "hidden_keys" an explanation of what exactly it does ? Does it mean that the hidden keys are "skipped", i.e. removed from "indices" ?

It means they are valid keys (indices) of the Family that are hidden.

> * the explanation of what `hidden_function` is isn't very clear either `O_o`

Then neither should be the one for `function` (or does it make sense if I change the `a` to a `the` in `hidden_function`?).

> The fact that the "name" argument does nothing for finite lists should be made clear I guess. I mean, what is it useful for exactly?

So lazy familys display nicely (espically when using lambda functions).

Hellooooooooo !!

Oh ? Well, if the second input is not supported so be it. Could you say in the docstring of Family what kind of input is expected, then ?

> This is an issue with `Family` in that it is directly passing a string representation of the input of `__getitem__()` without any safety checks (for speed). It's outside the scope of what I want to do in this ticket and has a landmine of "you've picked a specific ordering of the indices that may not be canonical".

Well there has to be a bug somewhere, this container is returning something totally crazy when one uses a basic list operation on it `O_o`

I don't even understand how the string representation can get to replace the content itself `O_o`

> It means they are valid keys (indices) of the Family that are hidden.

And what does hidden mean ? That they are skipped when one list the elements, or that they do not appear in the string representation `__repr__` of the object ?... As it is, I don't get what this argument actually does.

> So lazy familys display nicely (espically when using lambda functions).

Okay. Could you then say so in the docstring ? "name" only has an effect when the input defines a lambda function, if that's the explanation ?

Please keep "names" as an argument. I included it for future compatibility with the free monoid in sage.monoids.free_monoid (which should be merge with FiniteWords). Nevertheless, I think I made it wrong as what I wanted was

```
sage: build_alphabet(3, ['a', 'b', 'c'])
{'a', 'b', 'c'}
sage: build_alphabet(3, 'x')
{'x0', 'x1', 'x2'}
```
and the first syntax currently does not work...

Hello.

I'm sorry but this doc has to be rewritten. What the hell does that even mean ?

```
Definition: Alphabet(data=None, names=None, name=None)
Docstring:
   Return an object representing an ordered alphabet.

   INPUT:

   * "data" -- the data to build the alphabet

   * "names" -- the letters, names, or prefix

   * "name" -- the name of a specific named alphabet
```

Two arguments, one named 'name' and the other one 'names'. 'data' is "the data to build the alphabet". And the explanation of what 'names' is (i.e. : the letters) makes one think that the 'data to build the alphabet is NOT the letters. What the hell does it all mean ?

Plus none of the examples of Alphabet? actually use Alphabet. Because that is called `build_alphabet`.

```
sage: build_alphabet(5,['a','b', 'c '])
...
ValueError: not possible
```

Plus it would really help to have an explanation of what 'hidden' means in the definition of `hidden_keys` and `hidden_functIon` (the 'i' is missing).

Nathann, you write the documentation then (as a review commit).

There is no class `Alphabet`; it just is an alias (or you can think of it as a facade) for `build_alphabet`.

Hello !

> Nathann, you write the documentation then (as a review commit).

I have absolutely no clue of what this function does. That's the problem. Show the documentation above to anybody you meet, and ask him to deduce what the function returns. If he gets it I am wrong, otherwise it needs to be rewritten.

> There is no class `Alphabet`; it just is an alias (or you can think of it as a facade) for `build_alphabet`. Also IMO, the examples are worth a 1000 words trying to explain all possible combinations in the docstring for the variables. 

Come on. It must be possible to write properly what the arguments actually mean `O_o`

> From Webster: "Hidden (adjective): not seen or known, being out of sight or not readily apparent". So they are keys and a function on the keys which are not seen or are out of sight.

Thank you very much. Knowing what "hidden" means actually help.

Hey Travis, what do you think I am doing here ? Why would I come add comments to this ticket just to make it more painful for you ?
I honestly do not understand what "hidden" means in this context. No way. Does it mean that the letters are ignored ? That they just aren't displayed but that they are still stored somewhere ? Does this parameter have any actual use or should it be removed ?

That's what I want to find out. I have no idea what it does at the moment.

> Furthermore, they are a few harmless merges of the `develop` branch in the history, but I don't want to wait an hour+ to switch between branches and test something in Sage. 

There are 4 commits with unclear commit messages, and these four commits are as useful as none, as in the branch I  uploaded. And I never had to recompile anything, I do not understand why you bring this up. 

> In fact, on most projects I've seen, the git history consists of many very small commits and can be called "messy".

How do they review stuff if each commit is meaningless ? `O_o`

Switch between branches which are not up to the latest development version (something like `6.1.beta1`), and almost all of the cython files will be rebuilt because some low-level `.pxi` or `.pxd` file is changed.

> How do they review stuff if each commit is meaningless ? `O_o`

The sum of the parts. The history is only there to see what changed where and when and by whom.

Your way of doing things only suppresses the commit message that's put on trac, there is still the merge in the git history. However I'm not for rewriting history on a branch on a ticket.

I've fixed the errors I found, standardized the exception messages, and did some other cleanup of documentation in `family.py`.

I swap the arguments to be consistent with `PolynomialRing` and because it makes it more user-friendly (at least less requirement of the user to look at the doc).

As I believe you are aware, `name` is not used as a `prefix`, so we let it be (and if you meant `names`, then see Vincent's request).

I don't exactly think `Alphabet` should be in the global namespace since it's not a class, but it doesn't bother me leaving it around since it is a natural (historical) guess/entry point (and if you want to deprecate it, please do so on another ticket).

Best,

Travis

I do not understand. Why would it suppress the commit message put on trac ? Trac is perfectly able to display two commits at once ?.. `O_o`
And there is absolutely no history rewriting going on. I am just telling you how I avoid compiling commits based on old beta releases, which seemed to be a problem for you.

> I've fixed the errors I found, standardized the exception messages, and did some other cleanup of documentation in `family.py`.

I see.

> I swap the arguments to be consistent with `PolynomialRing` and because it makes it more user-friendly (at least less requirement of the user to look at the doc).

I think that's a terrible behaviour.

> As I believe you are aware, `name` is not used as a `prefix`, so we let it be (and if you meant `names`, then see Vincent's request).

I meant 'names', of course.

Well.

At least now there is some doc in this function.

> I don't exactly think `Alphabet` should be in the global namespace since it's not a class, but it doesn't bother me leaving it around since it is a natural (historical) guess/entry point (and if you want to deprecate it, please do so on another ticket).

I actually thought of deprecating "build_alphabet". Looks like a bad think to put in the global namespace.

Okay, positive review to that, and those methods are a bit better now than they were when we began this patch `:-P`

You've called "git merge", which creates a merge commit. Or are you running a `git rebase` somewhere? My problem comes from branches that I have before the next beta version comes along, are you suggesting that I delete these branches, then re-pull all of them using of the above?
