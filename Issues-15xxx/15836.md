The following produces an error:

```
from sage.matroids.advanced import *
M=Basismatroid(groundset=[], rank =0)
for C in M.circuits(): print C
```
Also, len(M.circuits()) is reported to be 1, whereas len(M.cocircuits()) is 0 and the latter is not malformed.
  
It is a bit of a theological issue, but I think we agree that the matroid on zero elements has circuits nor cocircuits:
 in general a matroid of rank 0 on k elements has k circuits and no cocircuits.
 
So I want to make sure that M.circuits() returns that empty SetSystem (easy enough) but I also want to find out how it is possible that the SetSystem becomes malformed in this case.

The error no longer occurs because of ground set size checks added. 

On an unrelated note, I noticed that if one gives bad input e.g. asking for size 9 independent sets of (ground set size 8) vamos matroid: 

```
from sage.matroids.advanced import *
M = BasisMatroid(matroids.named_matroids.Vamos())
len(M.independent_r_sets(9))
```

creates a segfault. There is a check in code for negative numbers passed but not for positive numbers strictly greater than ground set size. I suppose making the code stupid-proof would be a different ticket by itself.
