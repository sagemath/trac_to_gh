Running `./sage` once fixes this problem but the following always fails:

```
./sage --nodotsage -t src/sage/misc/ascii_art.py
```

You don't test the ipython profile creation any better by running the entire testsuite with `--nodotsage`. Command line switches must be tested via doctests, anything after the review is too late. The release manager role is not a second reviewer for every ticket, that does not scale.

I didn't write the description, but I think that `--nodoctest` could safely be removed from the second line. Delete the directory `.sage/ipython-1.2.1/` and try the doctest. It fails for me.

As far as reviewing goes, this should have been caught at #14713 (by the reviewer running tests with `--nodotsage`, for example -- it should have been caught before it got to the release manager). Or both you and I should have done a better job at #14188 when the `load_config_file` method was introduced (without any doctests). Anyway, I'm open to any suggestions about how to doctest this.

Replying to [vbraun](#comment%3A9):
> So you are saying that it fails without `--nodotsage` before starting sage the first time? This is not what the description says.

Fixed that.

> Command line switches must be tested via doctests

Testing *everything* with `--nodotsage` doubles the doctest time, testing everything as a user which doesn't have write access to `SAGE_ROOT` isn't even possible in doctests.

> The release manager role is not a second reviewer for every ticket, that does not scale.

In which sense does it "not scale"? I did that and it worked for me perfectly, there are very few tickets which would fail this test. The release manager already is a second reviewer, given that something like 10% of all positively reviewed tickets simply fail when tested on the buildbots (maybe less now that docbuild errors are caught earlier).
