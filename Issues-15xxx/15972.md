Running `./sage` once fixes this problem but the following always fails:

```
./sage --nodotsage -t src/sage/misc/ascii_art.py
```

Fixed that.

> Command line switches must be tested via doctests

Testing *everything* with `--nodotsage` doubles the doctest time, testing everything as a user which doesn't have write access to `SAGE_ROOT` isn't even possible in doctests.

> The release manager role is not a second reviewer for every ticket, that does not scale.

In which sense does it "not scale"? I did that and it worked for me perfectly, there are very few tickets which would fail this test. The release manager already is a second reviewer, given that something like 10% of all positively reviewed tickets simply fail when tested on the buildbots (maybe less now that docbuild errors are caught earlier).
