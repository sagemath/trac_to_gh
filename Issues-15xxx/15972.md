```

Running `./sage` once fixes this problem but the following always fails:

```
./sage --nodotsage -t src/sage/misc/ascii_art.py
```

Tests that combinations of commandline parameters work belong into doctests, not in a special buildbot config.

Once they've run Sage once, it creates their IPython config directory, so the error doesn't occur any more (when running vanilla `./sage -t FILE`). If they run `./sage --nodotsage -t src/sage/misc/ascii_art.py`, though, then the error reappears, because there is no existing IPython config directory when you run with `--nodotsage`.\n\nWhat Jeroen is saying is that all doctests should pass when you run with `--nodotsage` (or with a different user, etc.); it's not specific to this particular error. I suppose we could put a test like `./sage --nodotsage -t SOME/FILE` in `tests/cmdline.py`, but that seems a little odd to me.",

<a id='comment:8'>Comment 8:</a>
If a user has never run Sage before, they will see this error when doing `./sage -t src/sage/misc/ascii_art.py`. Once they've run Sage once, it creates their IPython config directory, so the error doesn't occur any more (when running vanilla `./sage -t FILE`). If they run `./sage --nodotsage -t src/sage/misc/ascii_art.py`, though, then the error reappears, because there is no existing IPython config directory when you run with `--nodotsage`.

What Jeroen is saying is that all doctests should pass when you run with `--nodotsage` (or with a different user, etc.); it's not specific to this particular error. I suppose we could put a test like `./sage --nodotsage -t SOME/FILE` in `tests/cmdline.py`, but that seems a little odd to me.

Fixed that.

> Command line switches must be tested via doctests

Testing *everything* with `--nodotsage` doubles the doctest time, testing everything as a user which doesn't have write access to `SAGE_ROOT` isn't even possible in doctests.

> The release manager role is not a second reviewer for every ticket, that does not scale.

In which sense does it "not scale"? I did that and it worked for me perfectly, there are very few tickets which would fail this test. The release manager already is a second reviewer, given that something like 10% of all positively reviewed tickets simply fail when tested on the buildbots (maybe less now that docbuild errors are caught earlier).
