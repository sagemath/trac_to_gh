Aren't you afraid of the fact that `c[i]` is not `c_i` but `c_{i+1}` ? Don't you think it's dangerous ?

you've mixed up the ticket number: look, the last commit line above says

```
​1555dc7	trac #15854: consistency between code and doc, and None in bi and ci

Ahahahah. Well, I don't think that the dev scripts are based on the commit messages, but I fixed that, just in case `:-P`

I think that the dev script is mostly worried over the fact that I rewrote history. That's why you should probably find a way to delete that branch from your local repository again before running your checkout command.

By the way, how is it going in Oxford ? Do you finally have an office and everything ?

Cheers from Brussels,
