Well. Not exactly "all" `:-P`

I did this quite quite often in the graph code, in order to avoid having to create three functions for every feature : one which returns True/False, one which returns a certificate, and a hidden one which returns both. Besides it is weird to call a function which is meant to return a certificate when you do not even know if the graph is distance-regular or not, and there is a risk that users would call BOTH functions (first boolean check THEN certificate) and so compute everythin twice.

OK, I see, that's what happened: indeed, I changed docs (except the docs for the return value, just forgot these - that's why there was one more commit) in the first commit, 
as well as the order of the things returned in `return`.  For the sake of code readability it would be great to change the code too, indeed. Do you want me to do this, or you prefer to do this yourself?

I think that the dev script is mostly worried over the fact that I rewrote history. That's why you should probably find a way to delete that branch from your local repository again before running your checkout command.

By the way, how is it going in Oxford ? Do you finally have an office and everything ?
