As reported in [1] `is_distance_regular` is SOooooooo awfully wrong that the definition it uses is ... just wrong. I'm sorry for that `:-/`

The current patch fixes it.

Aren't you afraid of the fact that `c[i]` is not `c_i` but `c_{i+1}` ? Don't you think it's dangerous ?

`c[i]` is more of a function of `i` than anything else (same applied to `b`).  You would not insist on `1/x` returning `None` for `x=0`, would you?

I guess your code names the stuff inconsistently, i.e. the meanings of b and c are swapped, compared with your docstrings.

OK, I see, that's what happened: indeed, I changed docs (except the docs for the return value, just forgot these - that's why there was one more commit) in the first commit, 
as well as the order of the things returned in `return`.  For the sake of code readability it would be great to change the code too, indeed. Do you want me to do this, or you prefer to do this yourself?

you've mixed up the ticket number: look, the last commit line above says

```
​1555dc7	trac #15854: consistency between code and doc, and None in bi and ci
```
but we are doing #15864 ! No wonder I can't check out a sh*t, no matter what I try...

Ahahahah. Well, I don't think that the dev scripts are based on the commit messages, but I fixed that, just in case `:-P`

I think that the dev script is mostly worried over the fact that I rewrote history. That's why you should probably find a way to delete that branch from your local repository again before running your checkout command.

By the way, how is it going in Oxford ? Do you finally have an office and everything ?

Cheers from Brussels,
