After resolving the conflicts there are various doctest failures:

```
sage -t --long src/sage/rings/padics/padic_base_leaves.py  # 3 doctests failed
sage -t --long src/sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_ring.py  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t --long src/doc/en/thematic_tutorials/coercion_and_categories.rst  # 3 doctests failed
sage -t --long src/doc/en/thematic_tutorials/tutorial-objects-and-classes.rst  # 2 doctests failed
```
Some of these are due to the testsuite running `euclidean_degree()` on random elements; these may be zero, which causes

```
NotImplementedError: euclidean degree not defined for the zero element
```
