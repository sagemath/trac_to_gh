```

```
sage: x.series(x==1,10).coefficient(x-1,0)
x
```
which is wrong. It should be `1`, which can be seen by 

```
sage: x.series(x==1,10)
1 + 1*(x - 1)
```

We also have wrong results here:

```
sage: x.series(x==1,10).coefficient(x-1,1)
0
sage: x.series(x==1,10).coefficient(x-1)
0
```

Keywords: **symbolic, series, coefficient, wrong**

<a id='comment:3'>Comment 3:</a>
Also `coefficient` can only deal with monomials: 

```
sage: (x-1).coefficient(x-1)
0
```
Different ticket?
