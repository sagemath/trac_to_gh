Implement an interface to Guillaume Quintin's Reed-Solomon decoding C library

http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/~quintin/decoding/

Tasks:
- Build an spkg (not started; for now: run `sage -sh`, and `make / make install` within the `decoding` sources)

- Implement a module sage.libs.decoding (or some more specific name!);
  see the git branch for a seed.

**CC:**  @defeo quintin jpflori

**Keywords:** coding theory, decoding

In my opinion, this should go inside `sage.coding` and should be integrated with the `decode` method of `LinearCode` from `sage.coding.linear_code`.

Some newer complete decoders have been implemented during GSOC in #14973.
