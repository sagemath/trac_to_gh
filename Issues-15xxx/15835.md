Try the following (Mac OS X Mavericks, Sage 6.11 Master Branch):

```
A = Matrix(IntegerModRing(2),[[1,0,2],[1,0,1]]) 
A.smith_form() 
```

You get the error:

This error does not appear for calculations over the integers mod 3

With the advice from https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/7F5xUQFcfXE, I went ahead and created what looks like a patch (to me, anyway):

Inside the smith_form() function in matrix2.pyx:

We have: `mm = t.submatrix(1,1)` on line 12413.

The sub matrix function takes five parameters (self, starting row, starting col, # sub matrix rows, # sub matrix columns). From observation, the 1,1 is the starting row/col respectively. Somehow the function is unable to determine ncols and nrows when using the integers mod 2, but after some trial and error I discovered a potential patch:

```
submatrix_rows = t.rows -1
submatrix_cols = t.cols - 1
mm = t.submatrix(1,1, submatrix_rows, submatrix,cols)
```
The above modification gives the same answers as all the examples in the source code. I tested a couple of other things:

```
Mod 3 Example:
A = Matrix(Integers(3),[[1,0,2],[1,0,1],[1,1,1]])
[1 0 0]  [1 0 0]  [1 0 1]
[0 1 0]  [2 0 1]  [0 1 1]
[0 0 1], [1 2 0], [0 0 1]
```
(same for mod 3 in current master and modified version)

Example mod 2 (not computable in current version of Sage - checked with hand computation - good luck checking it!) -

```
sage: C = Matrix(IntegerModRing(2),[[1,0,1,0],[1,1,0,0],[0,1,1,0],[1,0,0,1],[0,0,1,1],[0,1,0,1]])
sage: C.smith_form()
(
[1 0 0 0]  [1 0 0 0 0 0]           
[0 1 0 0]  [1 1 0 0 0 0]           
[0 0 1 0]  [1 0 0 1 0 0]  [1 0 1 1]
[0 0 0 0]  [1 1 1 0 0 0]  [0 1 1 1]
[0 0 0 0]  [1 0 0 1 1 0]  [0 0 1 1]
[0 0 0 0], [0 1 0 1 0 1], [0 0 0 1]
)
sage: t,u,v=C.smith_form()
sage: u.inverse()
[1 0 0 0 0 0]
[1 1 0 0 0 0]
[0 1 0 1 0 0]
[1 0 1 0 0 0]
[0 0 1 0 1 0]
[0 1 1 0 0 1]
```

An indentation error was created in 9db7f90 when a space was deleted before `def __reduce__(self):`

I tried to put the space back, but only discovered that there is still a lot I don't understand about using git.

Once this is done, all that remains is to provide a doctest showing that the problem is solved.

I gotchya fwclarke.

For the dockets, is taking the sub-matrix of an identity matrix (integers mod 2) sufficient?

Replying to [andrewsilver](#comment%3A13):
> For the dockets, is taking the sub-matrix of an identity matrix (integers mod 2) sufficient?


You must have the same spellchecker as me!

Yes something like

```
sage: A = identity_matrix(GF(2), 6)
sage: A.submatrix(3, 2)
[0 1 0 0]
[0 0 1 0]
[0 0 0 1]
```
would do.  And, as there also needs to be a doctest for the case of higher degree finite fields of characteristic 2, perhaps

```
sage: F8.<a> = GF(8)
sage: A = matrix(4, 4, [a^i for i in range(16)])
sage: A.submatrix(2, 1)
[    a^2   a + 1 a^2 + a]
[a^2 + 1       1       a]
```
Of course there should be a doctest for `smith_form` too.
