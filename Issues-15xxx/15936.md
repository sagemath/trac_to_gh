Some experiment shows that this is possible to reduce the size of all cached
function by changing the seldom attribute `__module__` to a property. This
reduce in particular the size of the `CachedMethodCallerNoArgs` which is
used in a lot of places. One probably can do even better...

Depends on #15931
