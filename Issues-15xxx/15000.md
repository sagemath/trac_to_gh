```
plot(exp(-x)+0.123, (10,40))
```
gives a plot, where the numbers on the y-axis vary between `1.23e-1` and `1.23e-1`, which means five times the same number.

The same happens with

```
list_plot([(k,exp(-k)+0.123) for k in [10..40]])
```
If you want more, you can have it on the x-axis, too, e.g. with

```
plot(exp(-x)+0.123, (0.10001, 0.10002))
```
Note that in the previous example the numbers on the y-axis are `1.028e` which is not a good notation, but this is already #7964.  

Keywords: plot list_plot axis numbers labels
