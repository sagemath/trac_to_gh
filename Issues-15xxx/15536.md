Nicolas said it's fine being in `GradedHopfAlgebrasWithBasis` since `Sym` does admit a graded basis, even if the given basis itself is not graded.

------------------------------------------------------------
The following tests failed: _test_antipode
```
The problem is that the counit is still defined as the constant coefficient, but that's only true for graded bases. Concrete example:

```
sage: o[2].counit()
0
sage: s(o[2]).counit()
-1
```

The same issue would be happening with antipode and degree_negation if not for the fact that the o and sp bases happen to be graded w.r.t. the induced ZZ/2ZZ-grading.

Yep, but that's technically a fault with the generic symmetric function code, not the category (which I think does it via coercion by default). Fixed.

> The same issue would be happening with antipode and degree_negation if not for the fact that the o and sp bases happen to be graded w.r.t. the induced ZZ/2ZZ-grading.


Again, not the category, but it's nice to know these things.

<a id='comment:31'></a>Lets look carefully:

```
sage: o[2].is_homogeneous()
True
sage: s(o[2]).is_homogeneous()
False
sage: o.an_element().degree_zero_coefficient()
2
sage: s(o.an_element()).degree_zero_coefficient()
-1
```
`degree_negation` seems to work fine but that is special for these bases (and would not say work for the odd-symplectic basis or irreducible S_n character basis).  It would be better if on filtered bases that these methods were done by coercion.

         return [self.base().Realizations(),
                 cat.Commutative().WithBasis(),
-                cat.Graded().Realizations()]
+                cat.Commutative().Graded().Realizations()]
```
This is what it should be, but because everything commutative will come from the `cat.Commutative().WithBasis()`, I think we are okay for now.

I really would like to push this ticket in and later reach in and fix the category-refinement/MRO/C3 issues on a separate ticket.
