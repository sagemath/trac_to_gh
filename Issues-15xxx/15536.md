Darij (or anyone else who wants to review this),

Nicolas said it's fine being in `GradedHopfAlgebrasWithBasis` since `Sym` does admit a graded basis, even if the given basis itself is not graded.

I fear Nicolas is wrong here:

```
sage: o = Sym.o()
sage: TestSuite(o).run()
Failure in _test_antipode:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/darij/gitsage/sage-5.13.beta1/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/misc/sage_unittest.py", line 282, in run

    tester.assert_(SI(x) == self.counit(x) * self.one())
  File "/home/darij/gitsage/sage-5.13.beta1/local/lib/python/unittest/case.py", line 424, in assertTrue
    raise self.failureException(msg)
AssertionError: False is not true
------------------------------------------------------------
The following tests failed: _test_antipode
```
The problem is that the counit is still defined as the constant coefficient, but that's only true for graded bases. Concrete example:

```
sage: o[2].counit()
0
sage: s(o[2]).counit()
-1
```

The same issue would be happening with antipode and degree_negation if not for the fact that the o and sp bases happen to be graded w.r.t. the induced ZZ/2ZZ-grading.

Yep, but that's technically a fault with the generic symmetric function code, not the category (which I think does it via coercion by default). Fixed.

> The same issue would be happening with antipode and degree_negation if not for the fact that the o and sp bases happen to be graded w.r.t. the induced ZZ/2ZZ-grading.

Again, not the category, but it's nice to know these things.

Travis, thanks for pointing this out to me.  The `st` basis in ticket #19327 is very similar and since the group of permutation matrices are orthogonal matrices, it will be that `o(lambda)` has a positive `st` expansion.

There is an explicit formula for the change of basis from `sp` and `o` to Schur basis (that is almost exactly the same as the `_s_to_sp_on_basis` and `_s_to_o_on_basis` that you have implemented, it just alternates in sign by degree and the set of partitions you sum over are transposed).

I would say that is okay because the COB morphism is as filtered algebras, so we can't expect homogeneous components to go to homogeneous components. However this should still work for top-degree homogeneous components.

So do you want me to do some surgery on the category of Sym bases and make 2 basis categories, one for the filtered and one for the graded? We could then have some generic code for the filtered that uses coercion for those methods that implicitly rely on the basis being graded.

Okay, I've done some reworking of things at the category level, including adding a `counit_by_coercion` for realizations.

However I get MRO issues when dealing with the finite fields that I don't know how to deal with. I've convinced myself that the categories are almost correct; I want to make this change

```diff
         cat = HopfAlgebras(self.base().base_ring())
         return [self.base().Realizations(),
                 cat.Commutative().WithBasis(),
-                cat.Graded().Realizations()]
+                cat.Commutative().Graded().Realizations()]
```
But if I do that, I get `KeyError: (225536, 70)` from the c3 controlled!

So I don't know what to do at this point. Nicolas, Simon, do you have any ideas?

I wonder if the problem stems from this line in `__classcall_private__` of `Modules`:

```
if base_ring in _Fields or (isinstance(base_ring, Category)
                            and base_ring.is_subcategory(_Fields)):
```
or this line in `extra_super_categories` of `FilteredAlgebras`:

```
if base_ring in Fields:
```
and that one/both of these triggers the category refinement and breaks the MRO, which was in the process of being constructed when these were called.

```
sage: R = Integers(7)
sage: R.category()
Join of Category of finite commutative rings and Category of subquotients of monoids and Category of quotients of semigroups and Category of finite enumerated sets
sage: HopfAlgebras(R)
Category of hopf algebras over Ring of integers modulo 7
sage: R.category()
Join of Category of finite fields and Category of subquotients of monoids and Category of quotients of semigroups
```
Yet this still doesn't explain why this works for NCSF. I think that might be a key in figuring out what is going wrong.

<div id="comment:45" align="right">comment:45</div>

However, I don't think that is the right solution. `:/` The check is reasonable and necessary.

Granted, my current proposal is a major hack, but I don't think too many people will be creating many instances of Sym over various large finite fields (and there are more computationally intensive parts necessary for working with Sym). I'm tired of trying to deal with this here, so I just checked if the base ring was a field before any categories get created.

There is also another issue with C3 in that I get a `KeyError` if I make this change:

```diff
         cat = HopfAlgebras(self.base().base_ring())
         return [self.base().Realizations(),
                 cat.Commutative().WithBasis(),
-                cat.Graded().Realizations()]
+                cat.Commutative().Graded().Realizations()]
```
This is what it should be, but because everything commutative will come from the `cat.Commutative().WithBasis()`, I think we are okay for now.

I really would like to push this ticket in and later reach in and fix the category-refinement/MRO/C3 issues on a separate ticket.
