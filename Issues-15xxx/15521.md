Following the discussion on Sage-devel [1], default LP variables will become "real" instead of nonnegative as it is the case at the moment.

The aim is to have 4 types available through `new_variable()` : binary, integer, nonnegative, and real. Right now, nonnegative does not exist, and "real" represents nonnegative variables.

What this ticket does:

- A warning has to be displayed when `new_variable()` is called without arguments, as the default behaviour will change. Users are advised to add `nonnegative=True` instead.

- A warning has to be displayed when `new_variable(real=True)` is called, for it represents nonnegative variables at the moment and will represent real variables later. Users are advised to switch to `nonnegative=True` instead.

Huh? Are we back to the hg-like patch quilt? How come "#15489 is not applied" when I check this one out?

> Huh? Are we back to the hg-like patch quilt? How come "#15489 is not applied" when I check this one out? 

git does not manage dependencies based on branch names. This "branch" does not depend on branch "15489". The first commit of this branch depends on the last commit of branch 15489 when it was created, but since that time I fixed the problem by adding another commit at the end of branch 15489, which is totally unrelated to this branch.

Thus, when you apply this branch, only the commits that actually depend on it are applied. Not the commit that were added later on that branch. Then again, git does not do anything based on branch names. Commit is the only thing that it sees.

> EDIT: I don't see how to make this consistent without a manual rebase: if I "apply" #15489 by checking it out, this "application" will be reversed upon checking out this ticket, isn't it?

Indeed. If you want both, what you should do is :
1) checkout #15489
2) pull #15521

Pull is equivalent to "fetch + merge". So it will merge this branch atop of #15489. This way everything that is currently in #15489 will coexist with everything which is in #15521. This is what Volker does when he builds a release : he pulls patches one after the other starting from the previous release.

Note that there is a "clean" way out : I can checkout this branch, pull #15489 (which will merge with this branch all commits from #15489 which are not already part of it) then update this branch with it. It's just that my Sage is compiling at the moment and I can't do it right now, so if you are satisfied with this explanation... `:-P`

this is what I get if I try this at branch 15489:

```

$ git merge 15521

Auto-merging src/sage/graphs/generic_graph.py

Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.

looks like an automatic clean merge won't fly...
