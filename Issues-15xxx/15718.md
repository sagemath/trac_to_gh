+1!

For the record: this will require calling
sage.misc.structure.getattr_from_other_class, to emulate the parent
being an instance of the category's parent class.

Yes!

Still, some magic will be needed to bind each such method to the
object and call it (by default Python refuses to bind a method of a
class to a non-instance of that class); that's were
`getattr_from_other_class` (or some subpiece thereof) will come into
play.

Do we need to bind it? We just want to *call* it.

Such as:

You'll have to be careful how you formulate that: `cdef` classes can have methods too (some custom cython object of course) and their unbound versions specifically call themselves "method" and have no `__func__` attribute. They are callable, though, further suggesting one should probably check if the attribute is callable and if not, see if there is a `__func__` attribute that is callable (or some safe permutation of this that performs better)

Famous last words... I've seen many cases happen in sage where little design issues (which, at the time perpetrated seemed perfectly reasonable) lead to weird, unforseen and silent failures. The problem this ticket is trying to fix is one of them.

Well, anything can be assigned to attributes in principle, regardless of whether something is a python class or not. Should we ever migrate to Python 3 then there are no unbound instancemethods at all: they are just plain functions there.

So I'd say:
* check if `__init_extra__.im_func` exists (this indicates an `instancemethod` object). If so, perhaps check if `__init_extra__.im_self` is None (unbound method). If it does, then call `im_func`.
* otherwise, just call `__init_extra__`.
It's hardly more coding work and should be far more robust.

            ....:     def _mul_(self, other):
            ....:         return self.parent()(self.n*other.n)
            ....:     def _add_(self, other):
            ....:         return self.parent()(self.n+other.n)
            ....:     def _lmul_(self, other):
            ....:         return self.parent()(self.n*other)
            sage: class P(Parent):
            ....:     Element = E
            sage: p = P(base=ZZ, category=Algebras(ZZ))
            sage: p.has_coerce_map_from(ZZ)
            False
```
I found that `UnitalAlgebras.ParentMethods.__init_extra__` is called. However, it is claimed that the (absence of a) coerce map from ZZ has already been cached, which means that the clearly existing coercion via multiplication with `p.one()` is not registered.

At what point is a coercion from ZZ requested *before* calling `__init_extra__`?

Shoot! One needs to do

```

            ....:         return self.parent().element_class(self.parent(),self.n*other)

since `self.parent()(something)` apparently tries to find a coercion from `something.parent()` to `self.parent()`.

sage -t src/sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_quotient_ring_element.py  # 6 doctests failed
```
Sorry, I am currently unable to continue work on this. I suppose the solution is to either change the point at which `Parent.__init__` is called (since it tests whether `self.one()` works and multiplication works, it needs to be done rather late), or to indicate that there is a custom coercion that is better than the default coerce map (which is what I did in the case of multivariate polynomial rings).

I couldn't resist working on it.

In some cases, the problem is that a parent has not been given a base(ring), however it is initialised in the category of unital algebras, which means that it *has* a base(ring).

Should we perhaps modify `CategoryObject.__init__`, which currently just defines `self._base` and then initialises the category? It could additionally define a base for the parent, if the given category has a base.

Now things should work.

Changes:
- For letterplace rings, one has to call the parent init later, so that the conversions that occur in `__init_extra__` work.
- In pushout.py, there is one test where a class is defined as a subclass of a parent-class-with-category. By consequence, an instance of that class is not correctly category-initialised.
- I just realise that I forgot some fixes for tests in homset.py. Here is problematic what I mentioned above: The base ring is not given, but the category has a base ring, and because of the missing base ring, `__init_extra__` fails. Fixing it now...
