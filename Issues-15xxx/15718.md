+1!

For the record: this will require calling
sage.misc.structure.getattr_from_other_class, to emulate the parent
being an instance of the category's parent class.

Yes!

Still, some magic will be needed to bind each such method to the
object and call it (by default Python refuses to bind a method of a
class to a non-instance of that class); that's were
`getattr_from_other_class` (or some subpiece thereof) will come into
play.

Do we need to bind it? We just want to *call* it.

Such as:

sage: C = Algebras(ZZ).parent_class
sage: C.__init_extra__.__func__(R)
```

You'll have to be careful how you formulate that: `cdef` classes can have methods too (some custom cython object of course) and their unbound versions specifically call themselves "method" and have no `__func__` attribute. They are callable, though, further suggesting one should probably check if the attribute is callable and if not, see if there is a __func__ attribute that is callable (or some safe permutation of this that performs better)

Famous last words... I've seen many cases happen in sage where little design issues (which, at the time perpetrated seemed perfectly reasonable) lead to weird, unforseen and silent failures. The problem this ticket is trying to fix is one of them.

Note that the idea is to go up `self.__class__.mro()` on the one hand, and `self.category().parent_class.mro()`, on the other hand. The former is no problem, since self is an instance of its class and thus we don't need the `__func__` attribute.

Well, anything can be assigned to attributes in principle, regardless of whether something is a python class or not. Should we ever migrate to Python 3 then there are no unbound instancemethods at all: they are just plain functions there.

So I'd say:
* check if `__init_extra__.im_func` exists (this indicates an `instancemethod` object). If so, perhaps check if `__init_extra__.im_self` is None (unbound method). If it does, then call `im_func`.
* otherwise, just call `__init_extra__`.
It's hardly more coding work and should be far more robust.

<a id='comment:18'></a>Very strange. The following does not work, even in Python:

```

            sage: p = P(base=ZZ, category=Algebras(ZZ))
            sage: p.has_coerce_map_from(ZZ)
            False
```
I found that `UnitalAlgebras.ParentMethods.__init_extra__` is called. However, it is claimed that the (absence of a) coerce map from ZZ has already been cached, which means that the clearly existing coercion via multiplication with `p.one()` is not registered.

At what point is a coercion from ZZ requested *before* calling `__init_extra__`?

In some cases, the problem is that a parent has not been given a base(ring), however it is initialised in the category of unital algebras, which means that it *has* a base(ring).

Should we perhaps modify `CategoryObject.__init__`, which currently just defines `self._base` and then initialises the category? It could additionally define a base for the parent, if the given category has a base.
