Up to now, the functions `sig_on()` and friends were redefined as `_pari_sig_on()` for use in `sage/libs/pari.pyx`. This is a hack and should be fixed by providing (and exporting) proper `pari_sig_on()` macros.

This ticket doesn't claim to fix all problems with PARI error handling, but at least it should improve the situation.

Also fix #10126.

This looks good to me.  I was just thinking about this and had a very similar patch in mind (but with different names than `pari_sig_on()/pari_sig_off()`, which I still find slightly misleading).

I will run doctests and then give this a positive review - conditional on passing the tests of course, but not on the names for the macros. 8-)

Would `pari_catch_sig_on()`, `pari_catch_sig_off()` be a good compromise?

Yes, I think that is a very good solution.  A bit longer, but more descriptive.
