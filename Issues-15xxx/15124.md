Up to now, the functions `sig_on()` and friends were redefined as `_pari_sig_on()` for use in `sage/libs/pari.pyx`. This is a hack and should be fixed by providing (and exporting) proper `pari_sig_on()` macros.

This ticket doesn't claim to fix all problems with PARI error handling, but at least it should improve the situation.

Also fix #10126.

Would `pari_catch_sig_on()`, `pari_catch_sig_off()` be a good compromise?

Yes, I think that is a very good solution.  A bit longer, but more descriptive.
