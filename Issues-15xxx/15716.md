The following doesn't work.

```
~/Installations/sage» sage --dev needs-review --comment "This is a simple one line change. Couldn't resist. :)"
usage: sage-dev [-h] subcommand ...
sage-dev: error: unrecognized arguments: is a simple one line change. Couldn't resist. :)
~/Installations/sage [2] » sage --dev needs-review --comment="This is a simple one line change. Couldn't resist. :)" 
usage: sage-dev [-h] subcommand ...
sage-dev: error: unrecognized arguments: is a simple one line change. Couldn't resist. :)
```
Works fine without `--comment` (had an error in password :-/)

```
~/Installations/sage [2] » sage --dev needs-review
Trac password: 
Invalid username/password
Trac username: ppurka 
#  Your trac username has been written to a configuration file for future sessions. To reset your username, use
#  "dev.trac.reset_username()".
Trac password: 
You can save your password in a configuration file. However, this file might be readable by privileged users on this
system.
Save password in file? [yes/No]
