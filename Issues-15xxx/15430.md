Why use a sage specific cycache directory? Why not something like `~/.cycache`? (IMHO, Cython should use a default directory if `Cython.Compiler.Main.default_options['cache'] is True`).

Also, I think it should be togglable by an environment variable, say `DISABLE_CYCACHE`, in case someone doesn't want to use (e.g. for testing purposes/cython development purposes).

With this patch you can disable caching by passing an invalid directory. Ugly but yet another undocumented environment variable isn't that great either.
