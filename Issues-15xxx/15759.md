```
This ticket adds the following features to cached methods to make them
behave more like usual methods:

- `__name__` and `__module__` attributes
- calling them as functions / methods bound on a class:

    ```
    class Foo:
        @cached_method
        def f(self):
            ...

    sage: instance = Foo()
    sage: Foo.f(instance) is instance.f()
    sage: Foo.__dict__['f'](instance) is instance(f)
    ```


This makes them compatible with, e.g., deprecated_function_alias:

```
class Foo:
    @cached_method
    def f(self):
        ...
    bar = deprecated_function_alias(12963, f)
```
