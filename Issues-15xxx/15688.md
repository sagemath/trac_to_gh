```
In sage 5.8 the multiplication matrix*vector does not give the correct answer when the vector has to be coerced.

Example:

F=GF(3571);

m=matrix(F,[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1]);

w=vector(QQ,[89843/2, 555841/2, 754633/2, 211553, 152186, 286953, 70867, 109089, 156622, 341523, 319195, 109233, 277852, 232951, 244697, 325034, 295611]);

print m*w,m*w.change_ring(F)

The problem is this:

```
sage: parent(m*w)
Ambient free module of rank 1 over Ring of integers modulo 1
```
which is just the action that gets discovered by sage: 

```
c=get_coercion_model()
sage: l=c.discover_action(parent(m),parent(w),operator.mul)
sage: l.codomain()
Ambient free module of rank 1 over Ring of integers modulo 1
```
(sage uses the term action rather liberally. I think normally a left action would have right domain equal to its codomain)

The problem is of course that if you want to find a ring to which both QQ and GF(p) have a homomorphism, then the trivial ring is the only option. There is a *conversion* from QQ to GF(p), which is used by `w.change_ring`, but no *coercion*. It would be nice if we could raise an error in this case rather than return a useless answer.

Note that

```
sage: c.discover_action(GF(3),QQ,operator.mul) == None
True
```
so somewhere the matrix action discovery tries too hard.
