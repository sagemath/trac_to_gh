In sage 5.8 the multiplication matrix*vector does not give the correct answer when the vector has to be coerced.

Example:

F=GF(3571);

m=matrix(F,[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1]);

w=vector(QQ,[89843/2, 555841/2, 754633/2, 211553, 152186, 286953, 70867, 109089, 156622, 341523, 319195, 109233, 277852, 232951, 244697, 325034, 295611]);

print m*w,m*w.change_ring(F)

The problem is this:

```
sage: parent(m*w)
Ambient free module of rank 1 over Ring of integers modulo 1
```
which is just the action that gets discovered by sage: 

```
c=get_coercion_model()
sage: l=c.discover_action(parent(m),parent(w),operator.mul)
sage: l.codomain()
Ambient free module of rank 1 over Ring of integers modulo 1
```
(sage uses the term action rather liberally. I think normally a left action would have right domain equal to its codomain)

The problem is of course that if you want to find a ring to which both QQ and GF(p) have a homomorphism, then the trivial ring is the only option. There is a *conversion* from QQ to GF(p), which is used by `w.change_ring`, but no *coercion*. It would be nice if we could raise an error in this case rather than return a useless answer.

Note that

```
sage: c.discover_action(GF(3),QQ,operator.mul) == None
True
```
so somewhere the matrix action discovery tries too hard.

Now the computation fails. Is that the expected behaviour?

The reason is that there is no sensible common parent of QQ to GF(q). Simply because 1/q is not invertible in GF(q). So there is no sensible coercion. Just conversion.

I get. 
TypeError: unsupported operand parent(s) for *: 'Full MatrixSpace of 1 by 17 dense matrices over Finite Field of size 3571' and 'Vector space of dimension 17 over Rational Field'

Certainly, this seems ok. Lets close this.
