We have the following:

```
sage: C = CartesianProduct(PositiveIntegers(), [1,2,3])
sage: C.cardinality()
+Infinity
sage: F = Family(C, lambda x: x)
sage: F.cardinality()
Throws a TypeError
```

The problem is that the `cardinality()` tries to run `len()` on an infinite set, which throws a `TypeError`. Fixes this by also catching type errors.

Hmmm... It fixes the bug indeed, but why wouldn't we do the opposite and first try to call `.set.cardinality()` and on `AttributeError` run the `len` version ? Is this a speed problem ?

Its hard for me to say. If it typically gets python objects like `list`, then it will be faster. If it's expecting objects with a `cardinality()` method, then it's the reverse.

Nicolas, which do you think should be attempted first (note that this is for `LazyFamily`)?

Best,

Okay okay, if it's about comparing the different use-cases then let's merge this patch first then think about that.

Especially if obtaining an answer takes three days `:-P`
