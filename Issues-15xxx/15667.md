The upshot is that when computing the order of a point on an elliptic curve whose cardinality has not yet been computed, there are cases where that cardinality could be computed very quickly first, which would be much faster than using BSGS methods for the order.  Specifically, this is the case for curves with j-invariants 0 and 1728 over any finite field.

From the mailing list contribution by Victor Miller:

Consider the following:

```
def NextProgression(n,a,q):
    p = next_prime(n)
    while (p%q) != a:
        p = next_prime(p+1)
    return p
```

```
def Test(n,compute=False):
    p = NextProgression(n,2,3)
    print "found prime=",p
    F.<u> = GF(p^2)
    print "Found field"
    E = EllipticCurve(F,[0,1])
    if compute:
        NN = E.order()
        print "Found Elliptic Curve of order ",NN
    P = E.random_point()
    Q = E.random_point()
    print "Found points"
    nP = P.order()
    print "Found order of P"
    nQ = Q.order()
    print "Found order of Q"
    N = lcm(nP,nQ)
    return E,P,Q,N
```

```
time E,P,Q,n = Test(2^25)
 
found prime= 33554501
Found field
Found points
Found order of P
Found order of Q
Time: CPU 10.52 s, Wall: 10.77 s
```

compared with

```
time E,P,Q,n = Test(2^25,compute=True)
 
found prime= 33554501
Found field
Found Elliptic Curve of order  1125904604468004
Found points
Found order of P
Found order of Q
Time: CPU 0.17 s, Wall: 0.18 s
```

I fixed this: there was indeed a bug in the case j=0=1728 over `GF(3^d)` with d even.  I went back to my student's MSc thesis (unpublished). A doctest has been added for this, and I did test the entire library ;)

Please re-review.  If you like I can put the MSc dissertation somewhere, though the write-up is not quite of publishable quality.

I'll review it, I was rewriting down the changes of variables (and ending up with different changes though the result should hopefully be the same).
I'll be interested in seeing the thesis to double check computations.

And maybe it would be worth adding a little more doctests for such special elliptic curves.
(Or maybe test random curves with such j-invariants over small finite fields and compare directly with cardinality_exhaustive.)

Hum, I forgot that 4 == 1, I indeed get the same formulas.
I've checked a bunch of curves and it looks fine.

I also checked all tests pass this time...

Thanks.  See

http://homepages.warwick.ac.uk/staff/J.E.Cremona/theses/KT-MSc.pdf

I though I had done lots of random and systematic tests when I first wrote this, but clearly I did not do it properly.  I think it was just a case of switching two cases over, probably caused by mynotation and Kimi's being different.
