```
sage: Qx = PolynomialRing(QQ, 'x,y').fraction_field()
sage: Qx
Fraction Field of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y over Rational Field
sage: x,y = Qx.gens()
sage: s = (2*(x+1)) / (2*(y+2))
s
sage: s
(2*x + 2)/(2*y + 4)
```

Note, however, that it reduces the integers if the fraction is a constant:

```
sage: s = (2*(y+2)) / (2*(y+2))
sage: s
1
```

I don't know if it's a bug strictly speaking (the result returned isn't false, and it compares equal with the cancelled version), but it's a major annoyance to me because seeing this behaviour I'm no longer sure if I can trust Sage to cancel out nonconstant polynomials reliably.

This has been fixed for univariate rational functions as of version 9.5.beta9.

This problem does not exist in the version as it stands in the developement branch. 

as per my command line: 


`sage: Qx = PolynomialRing(QQ, 'x').fraction_field()`

`sage: x = Qx.gen()`

`sage: s = (2*x + 2) / (2*x + 4)`

`sage: s`

`(x + 1)/(x + 2)`



I suppose this ticket can be closed.
