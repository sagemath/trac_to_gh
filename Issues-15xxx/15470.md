```
sage: Qx = PolynomialRing(QQ, 'x,y').fraction_field()
sage: Qx
Fraction Field of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y over Rational Field
sage: x,y = Qx.gens()
sage: s = (2*(x+1)) / (2*(y+2))
s
sage: s
(2*x + 2)/(2*y + 4)
```

Note, however, that it reduces the integers if the fraction is a constant:

```
sage: s = (2*(y+2)) / (2*(y+2))
sage: s
1
```

I don't know if it's a bug strictly speaking (the result returned isn't false, and it compares equal with the cancelled version), but it's a major annoyance to me because seeing this behaviour I'm no longer sure if I can trust Sage to cancel out nonconstant polynomials reliably.

This has been fixed for univariate rational functions as of version 9.5.beta9.

<a id='comment:6'>Comment 6:</a>
This problem does not exist in the version as it stands in the developement branch. 

as per my command line: 


`sage: Qx = PolynomialRing(QQ, 'x').fraction_field()`

`sage: x = Qx.gen()`

`sage: s = (2*x + 2) / (2*x + 4)`

`sage: s`

`(x + 1)/(x + 2)`



I suppose this ticket can be closed.
