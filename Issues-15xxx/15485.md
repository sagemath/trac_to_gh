Hi,

I thought maybe it was not to much work to learn what fusion algebras are, but this seems more work then expected. So here some non mathematical comments.


1. in the class docstring it might be good to list the INPUT:  heading before all the mathematical explanation going on (but after the only senctence description of this class). This is something you want to be able to see at a quick glance if you sort of know how to use this class but forgot what the exact input was.
2. The examples in the __init__ function should be in a TESTS: section instead
3. Is there a reason you don't subclass `sage.algebras.finite_dimensional_algebras.finite_dimensional_algebra.FiniteDimensionalAlgebra` Otherwise, if this gives problems, you should at least make it behave more like a FiniteDimensionalAlgebra, by making a function that computes the underlying FiniteDimensionalAlgebra and delegates the most important function to the abstract underlying algebra to make it behave like a FiniteDimensionalAlgebra in order for users to have a consistent user experience.
4. This raises an error:

```
sage: F(F.monomial(0))*F(F.monomial(1))
```
5. While this works

```
sage: F.gens()[0] * F.gens()[1]
F[Lambda[2]]
```
5. It would be nice to have a method `gen` like FreeModule(QQ,42) has (although admittedly this is a shortcoming of CombinatorialFreeModule) I just found this out in testing this ticket.

All the same, thank you for taking a look at the ticket.

> 1. in the class docstring it might be good to list the INPUT:  heading before all the mathematical explanation going on (but after the only senctence description of this class). This is something you want to be able to see at a quick glance if you sort of know how to use this class but forgot what the exact input was.


I disagree with this as I feel it is better to define your objects for people. If you need to look at the inputs, it takes 3 seconds to scroll to find the `INPUT:` block. Also, I think Sage more consistently has things this way.

This really doesn't matter, but done.

Yes, there are many. Most importantly, it would mean we have to construct the entire multiplication table upon initialization rather than on-demand, which could be **very** expensive. Also, `FiniteDimensionalAlgebra` is a more concrete implementation than `CombinatorialFreeModule` and does not have the same feature set in terms of indexing of the basis.

As it should. `monomial` wants something of the index set (although this is not checked currently for speed reasons and Python's "consenting adults" philosophy). While `0` could be considered in the index set, `1` definitely is not.

I completely disagree because `gens` (and hence `gen`) is ambiguous, and hence, should generally be avoided. In particular, the generators as a what? See #15381 and #17768.

In this case, there is not a good way to determine what generates it as an algebra, so the generators as an R-algebra are the same as those as a free R-module. Yet, in this case, there is no natural order on the generators because there is no natural order on the indexing set.
