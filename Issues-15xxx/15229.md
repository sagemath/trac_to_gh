On [sage-devel](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/IeIeHsnNIf4), some discussion on `IntegerModRing` and its relation to categories took place. I would summarize the discussion and its consequences as follows:

- It should be possible for the user to indicate that the modulus of an `IntegerModRing` is prime, so that the ring is a field, without Sage performing a primality test. However (not part of the discussion) `GF(n)` does a primality test (actually it factors n---is this really needed?). So, the user can not simply use `GF(n)` if n is a huge number that the user knows to be a prime number.
- It was suggested that the user can instead do `IntegerModRing(n, category=Fields())`. This feature was asked for in #8562 and implemented in #9138.
- `.is_field()` should do a primality test, unless it is already known that the ring is a field. It has been suggested in the discussion on sage-devel to let `.is_field()` change the category of the ring. At the time of the discussion, this did not seem possible, but in #11900 this feature has been added.

By #11900, refinement of category happens when it is tested whether the `IntegerModRing` is a field by `R in Fields()`. However, there is some inconsistency:

```
sage: S = IntegerModRing(5)
sage: S.category()
Join of Category of commutative rings and Category of subquotients of monoids and Category of quotients of semigroups and Category of finite enumerated sets
sage: S in Fields()
True
sage: S.category()
Join of Category of fields and Category of subquotients of monoids and Category of quotients of semigroups and Category of finite enumerated sets
sage: R = IntegerModRing(5, Fields())
sage: R.category()
Join of Category of fields and Category of subquotients of monoids and Category of quotients of semigroups
```
I think we would want that `R` and `S` are in the same category after the category refinement of `S`.

So, the **first aim** of this ticket is to make the categories consistent.

Secondly, comparison of `IntegerModRing` includes comparison of types. Originally, this has been introduced since one wanted `GF(p)` and `IntegerModRing(p)` evaluate differently. However, changing the category changes the type, and thus changes the ==-equivalence class. I think this must not happen. Hence, the **second aim** of this ticket is to make == independent of the category, while still letting `GF(p)` and `IntegerModRing(p, category=Fields())` evaluate unequal.

Thirdly, in the discussion on sage-devel, it was suggested to refine the category of R when `R.is_field()` returns true. Currently, refinement only happens when `R in Fields()` returns true. So, the **third aim** of this ticket to do the refinement as suggested.

John, do you think it would make sense to set `proof=None` by default, and pass it to `is_prime()`? In this way, the "default arithmetic proof flag" would still be used by default, but it would be possible to override it.

If one did

```
R = IntegerModRing(5, category=Fields())
```
then `R.is_field()` would *still* do a primality test.

Question: Shouldn't `R.is_field()` trust the user and first check whether `R.category()` is a subclass of `Fields()` before doing an expensive test?

The following seems reasonable to me:

```
def is_field(self, proof=None):
    if not proof:
        if self.category().is_subcategory(Fields()):
            return True
    is_prime = self.order().is_prime(proof=proof)
    if is_prime:
        self._refine_category_(Fields())
    return is_prime
```

That's probably OK because the factorization routine in question is quick in recognizing perfect powers and primes. Calling a generic factorization algorithm to find out what prime power we're dealing with is bad, of course.

<a id='comment:6'></a>
As I point out on [[#15223 comment:18](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/15223#comment:18)], if we do (in a fresh sage session)

```
sage: R=IntegerModRing(19)
sage: C1=R.category()
sage: R in Fields()
sage: C2=R.category()
```
we have C1 is not C2. But if we run that same code again, we do find that C1 is C2. That's the normal result from `R` being a globally unique object and the conclusion one must draw is that `R.category()` is *not* an important attribute. Otherwise, the call `R in Fields()` would significantly modify global state, which means that a simple sanity check of input in a library routine somewhere could really foul up computations elsewhere!

So why would one care to specify the category upon construction if the thing doesn't matter? Worse, presently specifying `category` upon construction can cause multiple copies to exist. This implies that the category DOES matter, and hence should not be changed on global copies.

Another solution to forcing category refinement then would be

```
R.is_field(proof=True) #primality proof
R.is_field(proof=False) #only probable prime power check
R.is_field(proof=None) #no check at all
```
where the spelling of `None` is up for discussion. Perhaps it should be `"I_know_I_can_screw_up_this_sage_session_with_this_never_mind_the_consequences_of_pickling_this"`.

So I think we can't have both automatic category refinement on global objects (indicating categories are not important for equality/identity) and category specification upon construction (which raises the expectation that they are and presently actually makes that the case).

The consequence of automatic category refinement is that you can't actually control the category that you get back even if you specify it: you might get back an answer in a finer category if that refinement happened to have been made before. Quoting from #15223 again:

```
sage: A1=IntegerModRing(19,category=Rings())
sage: A1.category()
Join of Category of commutative rings and Category of subquotients of monoids and Category of quotients of semigroups
sage: A1 in Fields()
True
sage: A2=IntegerModRing(19,category=Rings())
sage: A2.category()
Join of Category of subquotients of monoids and Category of quotients of semigroups and Category of fields
```

Concerning making non-identical parents equal, e.g., if we were to have

```
sage: R1=IntegerModRing(19)
sage: R2=IntegerModRing(19,distinguishing_flag)
sage: R1 == R2, R1 is R2
(True, False)
```
Then

```
sage: P1=PolynomialRing(R1,'x')
sage: P2=PolynomialRing(R2,'x')
```
wreaks havoc: Since the construction parameters of P1 and P2 are equal, we'll have `P1 is P2`, so the `P2.base_ring()` will actually be `R1`, not `R2`. This can lead to horrible surprises. I think we had some really convincing examples of that at some point, but I can't find the reference right now.

That's related with one of the question I raised in #15223:

```
Would we like that there is precisely one instance of an integer mod ring for a given modulus, that is automatically updated if the user later provides more information?
```

Isn't GAP using a similar approach? It creates one object, and then its behaviour may change, when one learns more about it.

Hence, in this scenario, we would like that `IntegerModRing` (which is a factory) does not use the `category` argument for caching, but still passes it to the quotient ring.

I guess this is again a question to the number theorists (hence, John...): Would we like the following behaviour (not implemented yet)?

```
sage: R = IntegerModRing(5)
sage: R.category().is_subcategory(Fields())
False
sage: S = IntegerModRing(5, category=Fields())
sage: S is R    # currently False!
True
sage: R.category().is_subcategory(Fields())  # would currently only hold for S.category()
True
```

We would have a unique instance of `IntegerModRing(5)`, and this unique instance would be refined, the more we learn about it, respectively the more the user tells us about it.

> Another solution to forcing category refinement then would be

> ```
> R.is_field(proof=True) #primality proof
> R.is_field(proof=False) #only probable prime power check
> R.is_field(proof=None) #no check at all

I wouldn't like that `proof=False` did more tests than `proof=None`.

> So I think we can't have both automatic category refinement on global objects (indicating categories are not important for equality/identity) and category specification upon construction (which raises the expectation that they are and presently actually makes that the case).


We can! Namely, if the additional argument is ignored for the cache, but is still used to refine the existing object.

If we decide to ignore the additional argument for the cache and only use it to refine the unique global object, then this is a *desired* consequence. But phrased like "you can't actually make Sage forget what it found out about the category of the quotient ring".

Perhaps it would make sense then to introduce a method `Parent._unset_category(self)`, that would change the class of `self` to `self.__class__.__base__` (I tested: This would actually be possible) and set the cdef `._category` attribute to None?

Using such method, it would be possible to revert the changes, if the user was wrong in assuming that the modulus was prime. For example:

```
sage: R = IntegerModRing(15, category=Fields()) # 15 is odd, and hence it is prime
sage: R in Fields()
True
sage: R.is_field()
True
sage: R.is_field(proof=True)    # Ooops, there are odd numbers that aren't prime
False
sage: R._unset_category()
sage: R._init_category_(<put appropriate category here>)
```
And then, R would be in the same state as with originally defining `R = IntegerModRing(15)`.

Perhaps erasing of wrong assumptions on primality can automatically be done in `R.is_field(proof=True)`?

My "category eraser" works. With it, one can do the following:

```
        Let us create a parent in the category of rings::

            sage: class MyParent(Parent):
            ....:     def __init__(self):
            ....:         Parent.__init__(self, category=Rings())
            ....:
            sage: P = MyParent()
            sage: P.category()
            Category of rings

        Of course, its category is initialised::

            sage: P._is_category_initialized()
            True

        We may now refine the category to the category to the
        category of fields. Note that this changes the class::

            sage: C = type(P)
            sage: C == MyParent
            False
            sage: P._refine_category_(Fields())
            sage: P.category()
            Category of fields
            sage: C == type(P)
            False

        Now we notice that the category refinement was a mistake.
        Hence, we undo category initialisation totally::

            sage: P._unset_category()
            sage: P._is_category_initialized()
            False
            sage: type(P) == MyParent
            True

        And finally, we initialise the parent again in the original
        category, i.e., the category of rings, finding that the
        class of the parent is brought back to what it was after
        the original category initialisation::

            sage: P._init_category_(Rings())
            sage: type(P) == C
            True
```
Question (e.g. to Nicolas):

Do we want to have such a category eraser? Then, refining the category of a quotient ring would not hurt so much, because it could easily be reverted when one finds that the refinement was a mistake.

Yes, of course.

All these `_refine_category_` and `_unset_category` methods start with an underscore for a reason: You should only use them if you know what you are doing. And similarly, with the `category=Fields()` option of `IntegerModRing`, you should be ready to bear the consequences of any misuse.

You can see it in this way: If you are in the fourth line of your example, then you are in a total mess. Unsetting the category might help you to clean some mess after the mess was created, but it wouldn't be appropriate to expect that it can clean *everything*.

However, being able to clean *some* mess is still better than nothing.

So, this might actually be an argument of using the `R.is_bla()` methods, rather than relying on `R in CategoryOfBla()`.

It might, but in my view an invalid one: I think we established that `R in ...` was faster (once initialized) because we end up co-opting python's highly efficient mro implementation. So I think it's more a argument to ensure the category stays sane.

Coming back to the `category=` keyword. The documentation would be something along the lines of

```
   category = C : Ensure that the object returned lies in a refinement
       of C. Note that the returned object may lie in a strict
       refinement. Additionally, note that, due to the fact that the
       object returned is globally unique, the object returned 
       may be identical to the result of independent constructions.
       These would naturally now also have a refined category.
```
By the time the doc looks like that, do you still think that's the best API to allow specifying that a quotient ring is a field upon construction?

Do you have a rationale to expose something that complex in the construction interface if the same can be accomplished using `_refine_category_` afterwards?

Good point. If one has a potentially dangerous functionality, then it makes sense to hide it from the occasional user by making it underscore---and it may be a bad idea to make this "forbidden magic" available in the constructor.

To my rehabilitation: I introduced the `category` keyword because it was formulated as "todo" in the docs, and it was formulated as "todo" because of the mentioned discussion on sage-devel.

The question to the number theorists is: Is the `category` keyword actually used somewhere? If it is, then one might replace it by `_refine_category_`, so that the `category` keyword can be removed.

And the question to all of us is:

Testing `R in Fields()` may rely on a probabilistic primality test. Thus, it might be that `R in Fields()` and `R.is_field()` give the wrong answer and hence the category is automatically refined incorrectly. Do we want that `R.is_field(proof=True)` reverts the category refinement, if it finds that R is in fact not a field?

If we use something like
[Baillie-PSW](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baillie-PSW_primality_test)
it shouldn't just revert the category, it should also file for $620 to be donated to the Sage foundation. Probabilistic primality tests are *really* good.

I guess at some point we should post a question/poll on either sage-devel or sage-nt. But before doing so, we should discuss here what exactly to ask. Here, I try to give arguments for several approaches to solve our problem.

It was requested in the old sage-devel discussion that the user should be able to indicate that a certain modulus is prime, so that the integer mod ring is mathematically a field. The question is mainly: *How* should be indicated that it is a field, and *what consequences* should providing this information imply?

__How?__

It could be by an optional argument, but what exactly should be provided?

- "category=...": Most parent's constructors now have an optional `category` argument. So, it seems consistent with other parts of Sage to offer the same argument to integer mod rings.

- "is_field=False/True": All what we requested was a way to indicate whether the ring is a field or not. So, we just need a bool, and there is no need to allow an arbitrary fully fledged category in the constructor. On the other hand, there might be future applications which make use of categories beyond "is field/is not field".

Alternatively, one could indicate the "field-ness" only *after* initialisation. Hence:

- There should be *no* optional argument to `IntegerModRing`. Instead, the user has the possibility to do `R._refine_category_(Fields())` after initialisation, perhaps wrapped into a method `.use_as_field()`.

__Consequences__

Mathematically, there is only *one* quotient ring `ZZ/nZZ`. But what shall happen computationally?

One could argue that it might make sense to computationally have two versions of the same ring, namely one version that knows it is a field, and another one that does not know it. Or perhaps we find constructions which equip certain quotient rings with other fancy structures (say, Hopf algebra or so). Then it might make sense to have a third version of the same ring, knowing that it is a Hopf algebra.

Or one could argue that the ring either is a field or it is *not*, and it either has a Hopf algebra structure or it has not. From this point of view, there should be a unique instance of this ring, and additional structures (field, Hopf algebras) are all accumulated in this single instance.

So, it is not clear whether an optional argument provided to the `IntegerModRing` factory should be ignored in the cache or not.

A potential argument against accumulating information in a globally unique instance is: Globally unique instances should be immutable. But what exactly does "immutable" mean? It means: It will not change its hash and its equivalence class with respect to cmp (because this is what is used to construct a set or dictionary).

Thus, in any case, we have a bug to fix, because `_refine_category_` changes the class of the instance, and the class is currently having an impact in `__cmp__`.

__Safety__

As you have pointed out, providing the wrong category on purpose may result in a serious mess. You argued that this means we must not allow full freedom in choosing the category. But I think we should acknowledge that Python has a rather permissive policy: We must not be over-protective.

So, it might be good to have an "eraser" such as `_unset_category()`, but of course such an eraser will impossibly be able to fix all bad consequences of choosing a wrong category.

**__Proposal__**

These are my personal preferences; in some cases my preference is actually not clear...

- Keep the optional argument "`category`", to be consistent with the rest of Sage.
- Use the category to speed-up `is_field()`, unless "proof=True` is requested.
- Keep refining the category if `R.is_field()` or `R in Fields()` succeeds with some primality check.
- As you said, a wrong primality test would be a great discovery. And bad consequences of a wrong primality test are quite likely to be not easily fixable. Hence, I think it would not make sense to automatically fix the category, if `R.is_field(proof=True)` finds that R is not a field.
- **Fix:** Since the category can be refined, but the object must be immutable, `__cmp__` must be invariant under a change of category. This would also be consistent with the current bidirectional coercion maps between integer mod rings.
- I am undecided whether there should be a globally unique quotient ring for a given modulus, accumulating information, or one should keep having different instances evaluating equal.

All the above is achieved with the current commit and its ancestors. A warning is printed, that also asks to inform the developers, in the case that a probabilistic primality test has failed.

I made a poll here at SD53: Would you think that there should be a unique instance of `ZZ/nZZ` that accumulates information, or should one have one instance that was told that it is a field (perhaps erroneously) and another instance that does not know about it?

It seems that all but two people said that one should have a unique instance, whose category is updated when one learns more on it or when the user provides more information on it.

I am not totally sure, but perhaps Jean-Pierre can chime in: What has been the argument of having distinct instances?

I also talked with Andrey, and he said (in my own summary): If the user *explicitly* provides certain wrong data on a ring (such as `IntegerModRing(15, category=Fields())`) and then later wants to construct the same ring without the wrong data, then it would not make sense to return a new instance of the ring. Namely, after `IntegerModRing(15, category=Fields())` is done, the whole Sage session is compromised, and it would not help to have a second non-broken ring.

(note correction in bold).
For reasons I explain below, I'm not so sure using `category=...` is actually consistent with other uses in sage. Most category settings/changes *should* and ''do' affect equality and should result in distinct objects. This is not the case for the "is_field" case.

I suspect many people would consider that bothersome. It does better convey it is a *mutation* of something that (possibly) already exists, though, making it clearer that it may modify global state.

Different situation! There's extra data (or perhaps you forget some data) so, for one thing, the homomorphisms on the object in that category are different.

> Or one could argue that the ring either is a field or it is *not*, and it either has a Hopf algebra structure or it has not. 


Being a field is indeed a property of a ring. To make a ring into a Hopf algebra you have to specify extra information. Even if there may be only one way to specify that extra information, this usually affects the category.

I don't mind if it's there and it might be useful for debugging, but it won't actually help recover. It's just too hard to see what the ramifications of even a temporary lapse in consistency in the category settings does.

Is it consistent? How does `category` get used in other cases? Do we have uses analogous to `IntegersMod(17,category=AbelianGroups())`? In that cases the specified category IS important.

The relation of `Fields`, `IntegralDomains` etc. to `Rings` is a bit special: The concept of homomorphism doesn't change, which is why the category refinement can happen automatically. So these are very limited category changes that are indeed "insignificant". Most other category changes are significant (because they arise from applying some forgetful functor or fixing some extra (arbitrary?) data.

If other uses of `category` are or a different type, we should definitely *not* try to be consistent with it for special `is_field` case.

Of course, we do want to be consistent with other ring quotient constructors, where testing primality or maximality of the ideal we mod out by might be even more involved.

We cannot do the latter if we want to be able to construct UniqueRepresentation parents with coefficients in these non-unique-but-equal bases: constructing a polynomial ring over one might return a polynomial ring over the other, which violates all kinds of assumptions in the coercion framework.

In the new commit I just pushed, I drop the "category" argument and replace it by "is_field". Note that old pickles using the category argument should still be unpicklable, but perhaps someone can test.

Moreover, I made `ZZ/nZZ` globally unique. Rationale: Being a field is a property that a ring either has or has not. Hence, it makes no sense to have different instances, one knowing that it is a field and the other not knowing. The unique instance is updated when one learns more on it, one way (primality test) or the other (user info).

You say somewhere below that my example of a Hopf algebra structure is not good, because one could not say that this structure is a property of the ring, since it is an *additional* structure. Indeed this convinces me, and in this case, one should create a sub-class of `IntegerModRing_generic`.

Note that `IntegerModRing` is just a factory. Hence, while `IntegerModRing_generic.__init__`  should *of course* have a "category" argument (to be consistent with all base classes!), the factory does not need "category".

In the current branch, doing `IntegerModRing(p, is_field=True)` will put the result into the category of fields, either taking an existing non-field version of the ring from the cache, or creating a new instance.

Well, meanwhile there are only two possible values. Something like "join of Category of commutative rings, finite enumerated sets and (sub?)quotients of rings", and the same thing with "fields" instead of commutative rings.

The current `__cmp__` removes the category information totally, which would of course be a mistake for sub-classes that are more than just "field" or "not field" (as in my Hopf algebra example). Hence, `__cmp__` should be overridden on the subclasses.

Pickling `Problem/Question`:

Suppose that R is an integer mod ring, originally created *not* in the category of fields. Suppose that later we find out that it is in fact a field. Suppose that even later we save R to a file, and load this file into a new Sage session.

Do we want that the reloaded version of R is immediately initialised as a field?

With the current commit, the following would happen.

```
sage: R = IntegerModRing(7)
sage: R.category().is_subcategory(Fields())
False
sage: R.is_field()
True
sage: R.category().is_subcategory(Fields())
True
sage: save(R, 'tmp')
```
Quit sage and start a new session

```
sage: R = load('tmp.sobj')
sage: R.category().is_subcategory(Fields())
False
sage: R.is_field.cache
{}
```

So, the "field" information, that might have been obtained by a quite expensive primality test, has been completely lost.

Do we want that pickles remember the field-ness?

With the current commit, one can do

```
sage: R = IntegerModRing(7)
sage: save(R, 'tmpR')
sage: R.category().is_subcategory(Fields())
False
sage: R in Fields()
True
sage: R.category().is_subcategory(Fields())
True
sage: save(R, 'tmpRcat')
```
and then in a new Sage session

```
sage: R = load('tmpR.sobj')
sage: R.category().is_subcategory(Fields())
False
sage: F = load('tmpRcat.sobj')
sage: F is R
True
sage: R.category().is_subcategory(Fields())
True
```
or, in another new Sage session

```
sage: F = load('tmpRcat.sobj')
sage: F.category().is_subcategory(Fields())
True
sage: R = load('tmpR.sobj')
sage: R is F
True
sage: R.category().is_subcategory(Fields())
True
```

So, we still have a globally unique integer mod ring, even after unpickling a ring and a field version of the same integer mod ring. And the information found in the pickle will be used to update the unique integer mod ring.

The cached data are not preserved in the pickle, but I hope we can do without it. I make it "needs review" now.

Incidentally, if an InterModRing were to be part of a cycle in which it's important to know that it's a field, setstate may be too late to avoid triggering the primality test. So perhaps you should just pickle the `is_field` as part of the construction parameters if it's true. A `{'is_field':True}` kwargs won't create cycles.

There's of course the issue that unpickling the dictionary is almost certainly more expensive than doing the primality test for smallish moduli. In fact, if you look at what

```
sage: R = IntegerModRing(7)
sage: R.is_field(proof=False)
True
sage: R.__dict__
{'_IntegerModRing_generic__factored_order': None,
 '_IntegerModRing_generic__factored_unit_order': None,
 '_IntegerModRing_generic__order': 7,
 '_IntegerModRing_generic__unit_group_exponent': None,
 '_QuotientRing_nc__I': Principal ideal (7) of Integer Ring,
 '_QuotientRing_nc__R': Integer Ring,
 '__reduce_ex__': <bound method ?.generic_factory_reduce of Ring of integers modulo 7>,
 '_cache__is_field': {((False,), ()): True},
 '_pyx_order': <sage.rings.finite_rings.integer_mod.NativeIntStruct at 0xbba9c8c>,
 'is_field': Cached version of <function is_field at 0x926dd4c>}
sage: R.is_field.cache is R._cache__is_field
True
```

Now we update the `__dict__` by something that would come up when unpickling an old instance of the same ring that had called `R.is_field()` instead of `R.is_field(proof=False)`. The effect would be:

```
sage: R.__dict__.update([('_cache__is_field', {((None,), ()):True})])
```
and, as I have promised, the cache of `is_field` is detached from the dictionary that is in `__dict__`:

```
sage: R.is_field.cache is R._cache__is_field
False
```

Hence, if we now do

```
sage: R.is_field(proof=True)
True
```
(which might be a particular expensive computation, as we do proof=True), and if we then pickle R, then the pickle would *not* store the result of the computations we had with proof=False and proof=True, but only the one without providing the proof argument. Reason:

```
sage: R._cache__is_field
{((None,), ()): True}
```

Do you see the problem now?

> So if the pickled ring had no cached value for `is_field`, the value doesn't get clobbered.


Correct.

> If the existing and the pickled version both have cached values stored, but they are conflicting then it's a mess anyway.


No, they are *not* conflicting in my example above. They simply are caches for different values of an optional argument.

This is what the current branch does. If the category gets updated either by providing the new optional argument `is_field=True` in the `IntegerModRing` factory, or by calling `R.is_field()` (which will also be called if you do `R in Fields()`), then the construction parameters used for pickling are updated.

I agree with the latter bit, but I don't see what's wrong then. We're probably misunderstanding. The code I proposed does set attributes Do you mean we should copy `d` before we pop from it?.

In principle, `__setstate__` should just do with the dictionary:

```
for key,value in d:
    setattr(self,key,value)
```
If we do that, we don't need any extra machinery. However, the observation is that for attributes that live in `self.__dict__`, an update is faster. However, slot attributes that for pickling reasons get put into `d` should not afterwards still be added to `__dict__`. Access to them is shadowed by slots anyway. So, by the time you do `self.__dict__.update(d)` you should make sure that attributes that are stored in slots have been scrubbed from `d`. I don't think it's usually a disaster to also have them in `self.__dict__`, but it's pointless and messy and it's not what the object looked like before pickling.

Thanks for explaining the caching problem. What we'd need is a merge of of the cache dictionary and that's hard to arrange. This problem will arise with all cachedmethods on unique objects. So regardless of cyclicity, pickling (unique) objects with cached methods is a bit broken anyway: restoring a pickle can delete information on an existing object. This only occurs for methods that take arguments, but unfortunately it includes optional arguments such as `proof=`.

While writing `@cachedmethod` for structural data seems like a convenient trick, I think we're increasingly finding that its implementation causes trouble that would likely not arise from manually implemented caching strategies (just test and assign an attribute). Perhaps we should stop advocating "you should just use `@`cachedmethod".

`CachedMethodNoArgs` is fine, but there a `lazy_attribute` is usually a tiny bit more efficient.

Come to think of it, the way cachedmethod stores its cache makes the problem more readily apparent, but the problem is more general.

The problem we're running into is basically the usual "merge conflict resolution". Our unique objects are supposed to be immutable, but they still have some stuff on them that can change/be refined during the lifetime. One would assume the "refinements" are ordered (perhaps form a lattice?), so given two different states of refinement there should be a common state that is a refinement of either, and that would be the appropriate state to be in after merging. Can we think of a low-cost framework to encode such info? If the "refining" state consists of a dict that grows more more entries, then the appropriate merge is indeed to merge the dictionaries (the fact that it's refinement should mean that if keys occur in both, then the values should agree)

In cases where the variable state is not ordered by "refinement" I doubt we can do anything, but in those cases, I suspect that our object really cannot be considered "immutable" and hence the thing shouldn't be unique.

So one way would be to have a list of attributes that are to be "merged" rather than be overwritten in __setstate__. Then the instantiation of `@`cachedmethod could include registering the relevant attribute for the setstate.

This could be similarly implemented to the "initialize upon construction" attributes in the RichPickle draft on #15207.

I think such a protocol should be implemented on `CachedRepresentation` since that introduces the trouble. That would be the place to try and resolve the ensuing pickling problems.

It also means that classes that inherit from `CachedRepresentation` and implement a `__setstate__` should either follow the protocol themselves or comply by calling the setstate of CachedRepresentation in an appropriate manner.

Hi!

Lots of discussion here :-)

The current consensus makes full sense to me up to one detail. My
personal preference would be to keep using the "category" argument to
specify that the parent is a field.

I am using this idiom all the time to e.g. specify that my monoids are
finite/commutative/J-Trivial/...  And also, sometimes, to add actual
structure to a parent by implementing it in the category that I pass
to it. That might be a bit borderline, but it's super practical :-)

In a perfect world, where we would have a clean support for full
subcategories, it would be nice to have, for any parent class P, the
property that P(..., category=As()) and P(..., category=Bs()) are
identical if and only if As() and Bs() are two full subcategories of
the same category. Of course, axioms can help in this direction, but
we probably don't have a complete enough infrastructure to implement
this generically.

But maybe, as a step toward this, we can at this point implement this
behavior by hand in the special cases that deserve it like
IntegerModRing?

In any cases, keep up the good work!

Cheers,
                                  Nicolas

So, would you think we should make it so that `IntegerModRing` understands both `is_field=True` and `category=Fields()`, namely with `IntegerModRing(p, is_field=True) is IntegerModRing(p, category=Fields())`?

BTW, I don't understand the errors that the patchbot is reporting. They seem unrelated...

What solution do you have in mind to model the equivalence classes of category arguments that need to be considered for "global unique instance" lookup?

Also, how do you determine which inputs for "category" are valid? Isn't that just going to be a list of "allowed" values? In that case, the equivalence classes are easy: you just group the "allowed" list. Note that we've found above that these category equivalence classes need to be closed under refinements that could possibly occur.

That's not a completely insane thought: e.g. for non-commutative groebner basis your could have as axioms: finite dimensional, finite, commutative, nozerodivisors, ... ).


I think the above discussion gives good arguments why the *factory* for integer mod rings should not allow general freedom in the choice of a category: The factory needs to ensure uniqueness of instances. Some choices of a category play well with uniqueness: You want full sub-categories, and you want that containment in the sub-category does not rely on additional data (a ring intrinsically either is or is not a field). But other categories *should* result in a non-equal copy of the ring; for example, a Hopf algebra structure is not an intrinsic property and should thus not use a globally unique copy of a ring.

Hence, the constructor of `IntegerModRing_generic` (or what's the name of the class?) should (and already does) of course accept a `category` argument. But here, we talk about the factory that manages quotients of the integer ring.

I say: The factory should make it possible that the user asserts that the resulting ring is in fact a field, to avoid expensive primality tests. However, if you want to prescribe any fancy category for the resulting ring, you should either refine the category after the ring has been returned by the factory, or you should create a new factory (for quotient rings providing a fancy Hopf algebra structure) that is orthogonal to the `IntegerModRing` factory.

In any case: Are there open questions from the discussion? AFAIK, the current branch addresses all questions. What is missing for a review?

I had a look and am mostly happy with this ticket, though I might still prefer to let coexisted different instances of Z/nZ.
Anyway I know how to hack the cache so I can live with the current solution.

Two minor typos:
* `an integer 1`
* `21` is hardcoded in an error message.
