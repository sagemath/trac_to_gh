When SAGE_FAT_BINARY is set we should pick a generic value for hwdir.
We should also use --libdir so that gf2x works ok on OpenSuse and similar systems.

The other point is I was too lazy to check if the system was actually 32 or 64 bits in spkg-install.

I agree, and that's what I defended upstream, but Emmanuel didn't hear it that way...

In fact, if SSE2 is enabled, then we don't even need to replace the symlinks.

Apart from the feedback from upstream which does not want to provide a build system with an option to disable optimizations which would build an SSE2 lib but without further optimizations on x86_64, but just one which would simply point to the generic32/64 folders (so no assembly at all whatever the platform) when enabled.

The other issue is that I did not feel the need to add a bunch of code to spkg-install tyo detect if the system targeted is 32/64 bits, x86 or sparc or whatever, and then pass the correct value to the "hwdir" var (let's say x86, x86_64 and so on depending on the system, which is what I asked for upstream but got as a response: "we'll pass generic32/64 and nothing more depending on the bit length"), when passing unconditionnaly "--disable-sse2 --disable-pclmul" would more or less do the trick (except for the fact it broke the build on x86_64...).
Indeed this would really fit in the upstream autotools project, not within our spkg-install script.
But you nearly convinced me to submit that upstream....

Nice.
I'll push that upstream, but how "official" is this document?
In fact when upstream told me SSE2 was not required I was not sure what and where the official ABI could be...

Hum, the about page:

Sure, I'll bump the discussion there, pointing to the exact page you spotted and hopefully their position will shift.
I'll also directly provide a patch to implement what I (and apprently you) would like to see in.

Because it seemed to me it was the case.
I thought of:
* Solaris/Linux on sparc* where the default is 32 bit (as per what gcc does) unless SAGE64 is passed (by the way the current filtering might be wrong on Solaris on top of x86_64...).
* ARM (only 32 bit at the moment, but not even really officially supported anyway).
* Cygwin should only be x86/x86_64 (does Windows even run on something else?) so is taken care of.
* Darwin on PPC[!64]/PowerPC (and even PPC64 in fact) which is only supported 32 bit by Sage.
* non-Darwin ppc64 (let's say POWER? system) are 64 bits.
* don"t really know on what FreeBSD can run on, but it's not officially supported, and x86/x86_64.

Hum, I forgot (linux) itanium which happens to be 64 bit (only I'd say?)...

All that to say, that my original point was to avoid to develop an overly complicated test script which shouldn't really belong within the install script imho.

On a side note, would you consider updateing the autotools spkg and gitify it?

I'm currently crafting a proper patch, and while at it I'll aslo include the fixes for SSE2 checks.

Because:
* it's more work,
* it's a pain to maintain as it will be additional code within spkg-install (unless I introduce empty chunks touching these Makefiles in the same patch file touching acinclude.m4 but it feels hackish),
* I'm lazy :)

I'm confused because it seems that you're solving the same problem twice:
1. You supply the `hwdir` option to configure
2. You supply the `--disable-hardware-specific-code` option to configure

Wouldn't either of these two work by itself?

A more serious issue is that you should not assume that SSE2 code can be *compiled* properly, the compiler and assembler need to support it. Hardware support and software support are orthogonal. On `x86_64`, you may assume hardware support but you still need `CHECK_SSE2_SUPPORT()` to check for software support.

Not right now.
With "--disable-hardware-specific-code" you only use the generic32, generic64 targets.
With only hwdir set, the configure script still checks whether SSE2 and pclmul are supported and can add the corresponding flags to CFLAGS.

I agree with the hardware/software dichotomy.
The problem is that the CHECK_SSE2_SUPPORT macro does not only checks for SSE2 support but can add things to CFLAGS (for example on 32 bits where -msse2 is needed)... so we cannot just call it unconditionally and that's why it is not called upstream when "--disable-hardware-specific-code" is passed, and the upstream choice to only use generic32/64 seems the right one.

If we want to use the x86_64 hwdir (with sse2) for sage generic builds, we should still pass "--disable-hardware-specific-code" to ensure pclmul is not used, nor sse2 on x86, but still call CHECK_SSE2_SUPPORT() on x86_64 and if that succeeds, set hwdir to x86_64.

The other solution is to modify the symlinks as before so that the x86_64 does not require sse2 (but could still use plain assembly).

Hummm, this patch is upstream (see commit numbers in SPKG.txt, 162 ands 167 IIRC). 
Only the x86_64 part which assumes SSE2 support is mine.

Oops, I mistakenly changed the branch name.

About the patch order: I'd say your patch is the last one so configure.ac will have a more recent timestamp than configure which is what we want to avoid, isn't it? (ok in real life I don't know what granularity timestamps have, so if it is one second, timestamps should be the same).

Your branch fails on ppc64.
In fact mine does as well in a similar way but only when SAGE_FAT_BINARY=yes..
Apparently the tuning process tries to build sse2 code.

And this won't work if the compiler does not support SSE2:

```
++ CHECK_SSE2_SUPPORT()
++ if test x$enable_hardware_specific_code = xyes; then
++ CHECK_PCLMUL_SUPPORT()
++ fi
++ if test x$gf2x_cv_cc_supports_pclmul != xyes ; then
+ hwdir=x86_64
```
because the x86_64 dir cannot be used without sse2 support (and that's why you could and still can not build on x86_64 with --disable-sse2).

A better and more flexible solution could be to decorrelate the sse2/pclmul tests and the definitions of HAVE_*_SUPPORT.
Just as 

```
AM_CONDITIONAL([GF2X_PCLMUL_AVAILABLE],[test "x$gf2x_cv_cc_supports_pclmul" != xno])
```
which is in configure.ac, the following which is in acinclude.m4 within the SSE2 support macro could be in configure.ac.

```
 if test "$gf2x_cv_cc_supports_sse2" != "no" ;then
  AC_DEFINE([HAVE_SSE2_SUPPORT],[1],[Define if sse-2 code as present in the source tree is supported by the compiler])
 fi

Not quite: $gf2x_cv_cc_supports_sse2 can be "requires -msse2", and $gf2x_cv_cc_supports_pclmul can be "requires -mpclmul".

Seems more sane to me to run CHECK_SSE2_SUPPORT and CHECK_PCLMUL_SUPPORT always, so that the case  where gf2x_cv_cc_supports_sse2/pclmul is undefined does not occur, with enable_sse2=no and enable_pclmul=no as appropriate.

By seperating enabling of sse2/pclmul support from checking for support, configure can now run CHECK_(SSE2|PCLMUL)_SUPPORT always, avoiding the case where $gfx_cv_cc_support_(sse|pclmul) is not defined.

It's not so easy to see what the last commit actually does and unfortunately I have no time to play around applying different sets of patches to the src we distribute, diff the result and play with strange archs, compilers.

So my question is: what dirs will be used on x86_64 when the compiler support emitting sse2 instructions and when it does not and when the blabla-hardware-blabla flag is passed?

With --enable-hardware-specific-code (the default), it depends on whether code with sse2/pclmul can be **compiled and executed**.

|cpu   |execute sse2 |execute pclmul |dir          |
|:------:|:-------------:|:---------------:|:-------------:|
|x86_64  |yes            |yes              |x86_64_pclmul  |
|x86_64  |no             |yes              |x86_64_pclmul  |
|x86_64  |yes            |no               |x86_64         |
|x86_64  |no             |no               |generic64      |

With --disable-hardware-specific-code: generic64.

Hmm, according to the discussion above that latter should be x86_64 instead of generic64, right? I'll fiddle with this some more.

I'm thinking of having the options --enable-sse2 and --enable-pclmul with values "no"/"hostcpu"/"native"/"yes", with as default the value of --enable-hardware-specific-code which would itself defaults to "native". Value "hostcpu" would enable minimally for this $host_cpu (for x86_64 this would be sse2 yes and pclmul no). Value "native" would try to compile and execute. Having calculated the final values for --enable-sse2 and --enable-pclmul, sse2 and pclmul would be enabled based on these values. Configure would error out if the compiler lacks support.

The default directory would be selected based on $host_cpu and whether sse2 and pclmul are enabled. When the directory is forced, insufficient sse2/pclmul might be enabled and configure would error out.

That's basically upstream choice: use generic when the hardware flag is passed.
From my discussion with Emmanuel, it's basically because they don't care.
I (and Jeroen?) found it disappointing because the x86_64 spec includes sse2 and quickly and easily came up with our patches which on x86_64 tested if the compiler supports sse2 and if so use the x86_64 folder.
(Note that this folder uses sse2 instruction, so you cannot use it if the compiler does not support sse2.)
