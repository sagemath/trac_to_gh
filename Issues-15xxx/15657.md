I've changed `create_key` into `key` to match with python's `sorted` (and it makes more sense to me). I've also moved a good part of the doc up to our current standards.

Here are some timings:

With patch:

```
sage: @cached_function
....: def foo():
....:     return 5
....: 
sage: %timeit foo()
1000000 loops, best of 3: 343 ns per loop

sage: class Foo:
....:     @cached_method
....:     def bar(self):
....:         return 5
....:     
sage: F = Foo()
sage: %timeit F.bar()
1000000 loops, best of 3: 235 ns per loop

sage: class FooArgs:
....:     @cached_method
....:     def bar(self, x):
....:         return x
....:     
sage: FA = FooArgs()
sage: %timeit FA.bar(5)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.55 µs per loop
```
Before:

```
sage: %timeit foo()
1000000 loops, best of 3: 335 ns per loop

sage: %timeit F.bar()
1000000 loops, best of 3: 250 ns per loop

sage: %timeit FA.bar(5)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.47 µs per loop
```
So there does not appear to be any (statistically) significant speed regression (I did multiple runs of each as well).

If you're happy with my changes, then positive review.

PS - I also added the key option for the cache to file.

Hello guys !!

With designs I would like to have some new parameter for cached methods, but I wonder if it would be a good idea of slow something that we want to be fast...

Here is the thing : I would like to only cache the return values corresponding to "some" inputs of the cached function. More precisely, if some parameter is set to True I want to cache the result, otherwise I don't want to.

Do you know if it can be useful to you, or if it can be obtained by a trick with the current features of cached methods ?

Thaaaaaaanks !

Nathann
