```
In the documentation of the constructor of PolynomialRing you find:

```
    There are four ways to call the polynomial ring constructor:

    1. ``PolynomialRing(base_ring, name,    sparse=False)``
    2. ``PolynomialRing(base_ring, names,   order='degrevlex')``
    3. ``PolynomialRing(base_ring, name, n, order='degrevlex')``
    4. ``PolynomialRing(base_ring, n, name, order='degrevlex')``
    5. ``PolynomialRing(base_ring, n, var_array=var_array, order='degrevlex')``
```
It says "four ways", but five are listed.

Keywords: **polynomial ring**
