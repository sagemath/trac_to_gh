The patch attached makes various minuscule improvements to `sage/combinat/partition.py`, `sage/combinat/skew_partition.py`, `sage/combinat/partition_tuple.py` and `sage/combinat/sf/` (mostly to the docstrings), and implements the following:
* the Dyson crank of a partition;
* the Frobenius (also apparently first considered by Stanley) rank of a skew partition;
* border Schur functions (another Stanley thing).
