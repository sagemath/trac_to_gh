Here are two isomorphic hyperelliptic curves:

```
sage: HyperellipticCurve(x^6+x-1).points()
[(0 : 1 : 0),
 (1 : 6 : 1),
 (1 : 1 : 1),
 (2 : 4 : 1),
 (2 : 3 : 1),
 (4 : 5 : 1),
 (4 : 2 : 1)]
sage: HyperellipticCurve(-x^6+x^5+1).points()
[(0 : 1 : 0),
 (0 : 6 : 1),
 (0 : 1 : 1),
 (1 : 6 : 1),
 (1 : 1 : 1),
 (2 : 5 : 1),
 (2 : 2 : 1),
 (4 : 4 : 1),
 (4 : 3 : 1)]
```
The isomorphism is `(x,y) |-> (1/x,y/x^3)`. They don't have the same number of points because of singularities at infinity. But by "hyperelliptic curve", one really means the desingularized curve. So the function "points" should return points on the desingularized curve.

<a id='comment:3'></a>Sorry, but this won't fly. You'll have to implement weighted projective planes for that to work. The problem quickly becomes obvious when you look at the defining ideal:

```
sage: _.<x>=QQ[]
sage: C=HyperellipticCurve(x^6+x+1)
sage: I=C.defining_ideal()
sage: F=I.0
sage: F
-x0^6 + x1^2*x2^4 - x0*x2^5 - x2^6
sage: F(1,1,0)
-1
sage: F(0,1,0)
0
```
It's obviously a bad idea to return as "points" on a hyperelliptic curve some points where the generator of the reported defining ideal doesn't vanish!

It may not be so bad to implement weighted projective planes. We can already define the relevant weights (I have no idea whether they're efficient, but frankly, the projective coordinate ring of a hyperelliptic curve doesn't need to be very efficient. It's mainly there for decoration):

```
sage: P.<x,y,z> = PolynomialRing(QQ, 3, order=TermOrder('wdegrevlex',(1,3,1)))
sage: G=x^6+z^6-y^2
sage: G.is_homogeneous()
True
sage: G.degree()
6
sage: J=P.ideal(G)
sage: R=P.quotient(J)
sage: R(x^6)-R(z^6)
ybar^2 - 2*zbar^6
```

Unfortunately, sage doesn't seem to be aware that R inherits a grading from P, but I guess presently, sage never does.

Also note that `wdegrevlex` might not be entirely the most appropriate order, since eliminating `y` as much as possible is probably the best approach.

We can make that work with

```
sage: P.<y,x,z> = PolynomialRing(QQ, 3, order=TermOrder('wdegrevlex',(3,1,1)))
sage: G=x^6+z^6-y^2
sage: R=P.quotient(J)
sage: R(y^2)
xbar^6 + zbar^6
```
but putting the `y` in front is probably more trouble than it's worth.

I looked at polynomial rings and projective spaces for a while, then found that there is a long way to go before we have weighted projective spaces in Sage. But I did not see that `is_homogeneous()` and `degree` are already working, so maybe I was pessimistic.

One more pessimistic remark though: elliptic curves over the p-adics inherit from hyperelliptic curves, so switching to weighed projective space with weights (1, g+1, 1) for all hyperelliptic curves will lead to trouble.

Anyway, note that many changes in the patch must happen also with weighted projective spaces, this patch just does it now, rather than waiting.

Of course the fake points at infinity in this patch are an ugly hack, but using a singular model gives mathematically incorrect answers (as in #11980), and implementing the whole weighted projective spaces thing takes time. So which is the lesser of three evils?

Yes, if we're going to give our curves by projective models then elliptic curves should probably be given by a cubic model in ordinary projective space. That means that the common stuff between p-adic hyperelliptic curves and p-adic elliptic curves needs to be factored out into an object/interface that does not care about projective models.

> Of course the fake points at infinity in this patch are an ugly hack,


No, they are just wrong!

> but using a singular model gives mathematically incorrect answers (as in #11980),


But in those cases the answers can be made correct by rephrasing them in terms of "birational" rather than "isomorphic" and if necessary in terms of "places of degree 1" rather than points.

> and implementing the whole weighted projective spaces thing takes time. So which is the lesser of three evils?


reporting points that don't lie on the projective model advertised is definitely the worst of the three in my view. Having a model where there's no 1-1 correspondence between the degree 1 places and the (possibly singular) rational points is perhaps inconvenient, but not intrinsically wrong. Eventually having both agree is of course what we should strive for.

What kind of functionality for places of function fields does Sage have right now? It is definitely good to have for general curves. But for hyperelliptic curves we should still switch to weighted projective spaces at some point anyway.

<a id='comment:9'></a>FYI, we did a little of work on zeta functions of hyperelliptic curves at Sage Days 53 and (when merged) you'll get "the zeta function of the complete nonsingular curve in the birationality class of this curve" or "the zeta function of the function field of this curve" which is what you really want.
See #15148 and #11980.

We did not really make special attention to the docstrings, so this should still be done here.
