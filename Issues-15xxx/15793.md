Here is an example

```
    sage: S = species.SetSpecies()
    sage: S^3
    Sum of (Set species) and (Product of (Set species) and (Set species))
```
I'd rather have:

```
    Product of (Set species) and (Product of (Set species) and (Set species))
```
The problem was that the binary exponentiation algorithms was reducing using
`operator.add` instead of `operator.mul` !!!

Hello,

here is a review patch. I have not yet run the tests.

Nota Bene: I think it is better to base on the latest develop instead of the latest release.
