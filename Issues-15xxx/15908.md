guava must be explicitly loaded before the corresponding GAP functions are invoked.
The patch fixes this. There are still two test failures (see #14979) in the guava-related `codes/linear_code.py`, but this is not obvious and should be left to #14979.

this must be the last GAP update. What does your gap_console() print? In my case:

```
sage: gap_console()
 ┌───────┐   GAP, Version 4.7.4 of 20-Feb-2014 (free software, GPL)
 │  GAP  │   http://www.gap-system.org
 └───────┘   Architecture: x86_64-apple-darwin10.8.0-gcc-default64
 Libs used:  gmp, readline
 Loading the library and packages ...
 Packages:   Alnuth 3.0.0, AutPGrp 1.5, CTblLib 1.2.2, FactInt 1.5.3, GAPDoc 1.5.1, LAGUNA 3.6.3, Polycyclic 2.11
 Try '?help' for help. See also  '?copyright' and  '?authors'
gap> 
```
so no guava loaded, even after `gap_packages` spkg are installed.
