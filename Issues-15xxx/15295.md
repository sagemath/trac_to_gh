The following code should not throw an error:

```
sage: R.<x,y> = ZZ['x','y']
sage: Q = R.quotient([x^2 - y + 1, y^3 + 3 * x - 7])
sage: M = LinearMatroid(ring=Q, reduced_matrix=Matrix([[1,0,1],[0,1,1]]))
sage: M.has_line_minor(3)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
NotImplementedError:
```

Easy solution: add NotImplementedError to the except clause in the code.

<div id="comment:4" align="right">comment:4</div>

Added that exception clause. Now the same example raises another NotImplementedError, but one that gives more information. Essentially, computing ratios in that given ring Q is not possible, which is a problem in LinearMatroid._line_ratios().

So what is the policy here? Should has_line_minor() test if computing inverses is possible before handing the problem down?
