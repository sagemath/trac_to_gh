It seems to be a problem to compute Hecke eigenvalues for Modular Symbol subspaces at integers dividing the level N unless the eigenvalue for the Hecke operator at N is computed first.
I have verified this problem for sage versions between 5.8 and 5.12.beta.

Example

```
sage: M=ModularSymbols(5,6,sign=1)
sage: S=M.decomposition()
sage: f=S[0]
sage: f.eigenvalue(10)
IndexError                                Traceback (most recent call last)
...
IndexError: n must be a positive integer
sage: f.eigenvalue(5)
25
sage: f.eigenvalue(10)
50
```
