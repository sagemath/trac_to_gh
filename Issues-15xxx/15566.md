Ahahahah. You wrote that yourself `:-P`

Okay, so this patch can go and I can try to fix #15564. With other things from the doc. I now use this --warn-links option that Florent exposed, and I would like it to become Sage's default for the doc. But in the meantime we have plenty of links to fix `:-P`
