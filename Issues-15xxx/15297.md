Keywords: cluster algebras random_fail

The following is an unlikely but occasional error on the buildbot (on "mod"), see http://build.sagemath.org/sage/builders/%20fast%20UW%20mod%20%28Ubuntu%208-64%29%20incremental/builds/0/steps/shell_3/logs/stdio

The problem seems to be that the pickle hasn't been flushed to disc before trying to read it, e.g. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1746825/python-valueerror-insecure-string-pickle
