Sage can't guarantee that `p == q` implies `hash(p) == hash(q)`, but it is not unreasonable to strive to make this work in case `p,q` belong to the same ring or field.

This ticket deals with Fields of Fractions. The proposed solution from this post appears to do the trick:
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/TOp_5LCBBR4

Example:

```
sage: R.<x> = ZZ['x']
sage: F = R.fraction_field()
sage: p = 1/(1-x)
sage: q = (-1)/(x-1)
sage: p == q
True
sage: hash(p) == hash(q)
False
```
