CC:  @JohnCremona @pjbruin

Keywords: descent, rank, elliptic curve, relative number field

Currently the following fails:

```
sage: x = QQ['x'].gen()
sage: F.<a> = QuadraticField(5)
sage: K.<b> = F.extension(x^2-3)
sage: E = EllipticCurve(K,[0,0,0,b,1])
sage: E.rank()
```

This is because the sage function wrapping around Denis Simon's two-descent script does not consider relative number fields.

I propose an easy fix for it.

Looks good and passes all tests.  The new doctest does take a long time (4 minutes), but that is probably hard to avoid.  Two comments:
- use your real name for the "Authors" field
- the documentation line starting with "An example with" should be indented
After fixing those, feel free to set this to positive review.

Please try to find a shorter doctest!  Even when tagged with "long time" 4 minutes is going to add quite a lot to the testing time.

But thanks for doing this, anyway.

This long example, and the special `lim1` and `limtriv` in your last commit, make it sound like a good moment to look into #9322, which should generally speed up `simon_two_descent()` by changing the parameters.

The old example would be more than twice as fast with Simon's default parameters:

```
sage: %timeit -n 1 -r 1 E.rank(lim1=2,lim3=4,limtriv=2)
1 loops, best of 1: 1min 42s per loop
```
So indeed fixing #9322 would help.

Another thing: `E.torsion_subgroup()` fails as well, I've opened ticket #16011 for it.
