For cryptanalysis of classical ciphers, natural language-specific data like digram, trigram frequencies, indices of coincidence, and specific alphabets are needed. This ticket is collective for

* implementation of data structure holding the data
* inclusion of same static data for at least one natural language

Suggest to use `NaturalLanguage`.

Some code to use could be Jon Hanke's http://www.wordpress.jonhanke.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/crypto_routines.txt
