Your problem seems to be that `init.sage` is evaluated before Sage is started. A workaround might be to use a `.py` file starting with `from sage.all import *`

I appear to have a fix upstream; comments welcome there.  Somehow the change in #14523 in the definition of `attach` from 

```
    import preparser 
        for filename in files: 
        preparser.load(filename, globals(), attach=True) 
```
to

```
    try:
        ipy = get_ipython()
    except NameError:
        ipy = None
    global attached
    for filename in files:
        if ipy:
            code = load_wrap(filename, attach=True)
            ipy.run_cell(code)
        else:
            load(filename, globals(), attach=True)
```
did this.  Probably that should really be fixed in Sage, but I don't want to mess around with two fixes.

Can anyone think of why either adding that global (which one would think wouldn't clobber `all` globals, such as `Integer`?) or having the command-line code would be a problem?  Really, neither one should in principle cause a problem.  But it does.
