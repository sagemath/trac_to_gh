I want to write a class that stores matroids and their direct minor relations, and 
- actively maintains the property that the set of matroids is minor-closed 
- keeps the minor-relations up to date with the actual set of matroids in the set

The first layer of user methods should include  .add(), .delete(), `__contains__` , has_minor, enumeration of (co)extensions etc. Membership testing should benefit from the fact that the minor-relations are known.

The second layer should support the generation of matroids such that all their proper minors are already in the collection, so that the class may be used to compute excluded minors for a given property.

For a start, I want to work with (Basis)Matroid + ordinary isomorphism. I think it is best to give linear matroids + field isomorphism a separate treatment.
