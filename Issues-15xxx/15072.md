sage --version hangs in sage-5.12.beta1 on MacOS. It still works with sage-5.11.

The sage script uses 

```
sed -n -e 's/.*\(Sage Version.*Date: [0-9-]*\).*/\1/p' ./sage-banner
```
which hangs. This is probably caused by #14733.

This causes the sage-combinat script to fail.

Apply [attachment: trac_15072_OSX_sed_workaround.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket15072/trac_15072_OSX_sed_workaround.patch.gz) to the SAGE_ROOT repo.

I would use `LC_ALL` since that overrides `LC_CTYPE` (in case both are set). The following still hangs:

```
LC_CTYPE=C LC_ALL=en_US sed -n -e 's/.*\(Sage Version.*Date: [0-9-]*\).*/\1/p' ./sage-banner

I hope OSX doesn't set `LC_ALL` by default, that would be even more WTF. I would put it into the category of settings that ought to break things since you explicitly asked for it to be broken. 

In any case, I switched to overriding `LC_ALL` and don't refer to 10.8 any more.
