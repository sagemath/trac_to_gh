sage --version hangs in sage-5.12.beta1 on MacOS. It still works with sage-5.11.

The sage script uses 

```
sed -n -e 's/.*\(Sage Version.*Date: [0-9-]*\).*/\1/p' ./sage-banner
```
which hangs. This is probably caused by #14733.

This causes the sage-combinat script to fail.

Apply [attachment:trac_15072_OSX_sed_workaround.patch] to the SAGE_ROOT repo.

**Reviewer:** Jeroen Demeyer

**Author:** Volker Braun

**Merged:** sage-5.12.beta4

I would use `LC_ALL` since that overrides `LC_CTYPE` (in case both are set). The following still hangs:

```
LC_CTYPE=C LC_ALL=en_US sed -n -e 's/.*\(Sage Version.*Date: [0-9-]*\).*/\1/p' ./sage-banner
