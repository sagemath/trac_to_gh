Consider the following scenario:

```
$ cd /tmp
$ mkdir U
$ chmod 770 U
$ cd U
$ touch test.py
$ umask 022
$ sage -t test.py # this fails as expected
$ umask 002
$ sage -t test.py # this fails, but succeeds on non-OSX systems or other directories besides /tmp
```
Since OS X always sets the group of files in `/tmp` to `wheel`, this doesn' work.

This scenario is encountered whenever a user works in a directory that is owned and writeable by a group that is not the primary group of the user (and hence not the GID of sage when the user runs it).

<a id='comment:4'></a>I can confirm that the exact script executed on OSX outside /tmp does seem to work. Nonetheless, the original reporter of the problem (who is scmancuso?) seems to have a problem outside /tmp. I think he is running into exactly the same problem as with `/tmp`:
- Having a directory writeable by `wheel` is basically safe: people with `wheel` permission are sort of `root` anyway.
- In his situation, he considers `RESEARCH_GROUP` to be safe. He is probably a member of that group, but it's not his primary group.

The code only considers groups "safe" if the gid of the group equals the gid of the group-writeable current directory. I think this example shows that this is too restrictive and it is unnecessarily onerous to require the user in this situation to make the "sage" process "setgrp" to `RESEARCH_GROUP`

To illustrate the problem, let's assume that `everyone` (despite the name) is a "trusted" group to which I belong and for which I intentionally want to make the directory writeable:

```
$ mkdir U       #now the group of U is my primary gid.
$ chmod 770 U
$ umask 002
$ cd U
$ touch test.py
$ ../sage -t test.py
THIS WORKS
$ chgrp everyone . #this is a group I am a member of, but it's not my primary gid
$ ../sage -t test.py
RuntimeError: refusing to run doctests from the current directory '/scratch/nbruin/U' since untrusted users could put files in this directory, making it unsafe to run Sage code from
```
I think we simply don't have enough information to decide which groups are "safe" and which are not. In absence of a file that we can use as a model of the acceptable permissions, using "umask" is a possible substitute (although a bit of a misuse), but using the process GID as a substitute of the required GID of the current directory is simply not a good substitute. People don't have enough control over their primary GID and they can have good reasons to consider non-primary groups safe.

Yes, that would solve the problem, but it's not clear to me that that is truly more secure than just ignoring the process group altogether. Imagine:

```
$ id
uid=...(me) gid=...(wheel) groups=...(wheel),...(www_devel),...(unwashed_masses)
$ ls -dl .
drwxrwx--x wheel unwashed_masses [...] ./
$ umask 002
$ sage -t module.py
```
This user `me` has write permission anywhere where all members of `unwashed_masses` have write permission, but `me` has many more privileges as well. A longer `getgroups()` indicates a MORE privileged UID, so normally one would think one should be LESS liberal in executing code under that UID. Considering all the groups returned by `getgroups()` as trusted when `umask 002` is in effect would have exactly the opposite effect.

Trust relations in security are often asymmetric and unfortunately it doesn't seem POSIX provides a way to obtain the information in the direction we are interested in (I don't think that information is formalized in the system).

I am fine with doing the `getgroups()` check, because it is an improvement in terms of usability over what we have now and I think in most scenarios it will allow things that should be allowed.

It is a little less permissive than just not considering groups at all upon `umask 002`, so it may seem a little more secure, but I have trouble defining/justifying the security model it would be following, and programming the `getgroups()` thing is quite a bit more work. 

Therefore, my default would be just dropping the `getgid() != parent_stat.st_gid`.
