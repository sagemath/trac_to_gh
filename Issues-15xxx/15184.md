There is a problem where cached function report problematic file information. Consider

```
sage: M=IntegerModRing(7)
sage: edit(M.is_finite) #no problem
sage: edit(M.is_field)
IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/sage/rings/finite_rings/integer_mod_ring.py'
```
Indeed sage doesn't find the appropriate source file:

```
sage: from sage.misc.sageinspect import sage_getfile
sage: sage_getfile(M.is_finite)
'/usr/local/sage/5.10/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/rings/finite_rings/integer_mod_ring.py'
sage: sage_getfile(M.is_field)
'/sage/rings/finite_rings/integer_mod_ring.py'
```
The code that makes this happen is `sage/misc/cachefunc.pyx`, line 621:

```python
            if sourcelines is not None:
                from sage.env import SAGE_SRC, SAGE_LIB
                filename = sage_getfile(f)
                # The following is a heuristics to get
                # the file name of the cached function
                # or method
                if filename.startswith(SAGE_SRC):
                    filename = filename[len(SAGE_SRC):]
                elif filename.startswith(SAGE_LIB):
                    filename = filename[len(SAGE_LIB):]
                file_info = "File: %s (starting at line %d)\n"%(filename,sourcelines[1])
                doc = file_info+(f.func_doc or '')
```
As you can see, the code actively strips away the part that should really still be there. This change was made on #13432. Would it be very wrong to just do nothing with the filename here and simply report whatever gets reported on the original file?

Proposed doctest:

```
sage: M=IntegerModRing(7)
sage: from sage.misc.sageinspect import sage_getfile
sage: os.path.exists(sage_getfile(M.is_finite))
True
sage: os.path.exists(sage_getfile(M.is_field)) #this presently fails
True

```

<div id="comment:1" align="right">comment:1</div>

The logic above seems like a SAGE_ROOT-less translation of the code introduced on #11115, but I think something went wrong with a "leading slash" problem:

```
sage: sage.env.SAGE_LIB
'/usr/local/sage/5.10/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages'
sage: sage_getfile(M.is_field.f)
'/usr/local/sage/5.10/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/rings/finite_rings/integer_mod_ring.py'
sage: sage_getfile(M.is_field)
'/sage/rings/finite_rings/integer_mod_ring.py'
sage: sage.env.SAGE_LIB=sage.env.SAGE_LIB+'/'
sage: sage_getfile(M.is_field)
'/usr/local/sage/5.10/devel/sage/sage/rings/finite_rings/integer_mod_ring.py'
```
so it seems that if `_sage_doc_` ensures it returns a *relative* filename, then `sage_getfile` will prefix the appropriate path, but if it returns an *absolute* path (which happens if we snap off 'SAGE_LIB' but not its slash separator) then of course it won't.

Are we sure that the connecting slash is never there? Then we can just do `filename = filename[len(SAGE_LIB)+1:]`. Otherwise, perhaps we should do

```
                if filename.startswith(SAGE_SRC):
                    filename = filename[len(SAGE_SRC):]
                    if filename.startswith('/'):
                        filename = filename[1:]
                elif filename.startswith(SAGE_LIB):
                    filename = filename[len(SAGE_LIB):]
                    if filename.startswith('/'):
                        filename = filename[1:]
```
By the way, is

```
            try:
                sourcelines = sage_getsourcelines(f)
            except IOError:
                sourcelines = None
```
really the best way of checking that the file reported by `sage_getfile(f)` exists? We could just do a

```
try:
    open(sage_getfile(f),'r')
    file_exists=True
except IOError:
    file_exists=False
```
which should be cheaper than actually rummaging through the entire file. The only thing we use later on is the starting line, and in many cases that would be available from elsewhere (e.g., the docstring), so we wouldn't need to actually read the source file.

I think the current code is fragile, in particular if soft links are used (os.path.realpath might be needed at some point). os.path.exists might also come in handy.

The proposed fix expects the path separator "/", which should be os.path.pathsep.

So, there is enough reason to use os.path, rather than re-inventing its functionality in a non-portable way.

I agree with that. However, I don't really see why we need to fondle the path anyway. We're getting the path that would be generated by `sage_getfile` on the original function. How can we improve on that?

Python does not provide the file information in the doc string, but Cython does. And what would Cython do?

```
sage: CachedFunction.__doc__
"File: sage/misc/cachefunc.pyx (starting at line 452)\n\n
...
```

I guess we try to mimmick this behaviour. Note, however, that we mildly fail:

```
sage: P.<x,y> = QQ[]
sage: I = P*x   
sage: from sage.misc.sageinspect import _sage_getdoc_unformatted
sage: _sage_getdoc_unformatted(I.groebner_basis)
"File: /sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_ideal.py (starting at line 3507)
...
```
So, there is the additional "/" in the beginning of the file location. But in any case, Cython does not give the full path, and thus it should be a good idea that Sage doesn't, either.

By the way, something that I'm perhaps not to blame for should be changed, too: `sage.misc.cachefunc.FileCache` uses '/' as separator.

Sounds good! And thank you that you did not attach a git branch. Hence, there is a chance that I will actually review it soon. Hopefully some people at Sage Days in Oxford will explain how to work with git. It currently seems plainly broken to me.

> Note that this may be a good motivation to refactor sageinspect a little, so that getting "source file and line" is a little cheaper in many cases.

How?

> Getting just a docstring should be fairly cheap (and usually should not involve reading source files), 

Yes, the docstring itself would be easy. But in order to comply with Cython, it was decided to put file information into the doc string.

> and here we're usually triggering a full fetch of the source code, only to throw it away.

What do you mean by "here"?

> The reason is that sage_getsourcelines has a lot of logic that also applies to just fetching (file,lineno), but that logic is not available separately.

Is there code duplication? Or do you just suggest to make the code more modular?

I guess it doesn't hurt to have the path normalization in, but it might not be necessary for the common prefix checking, at least not at far as trailing slashes are concerned:

```
sage: P="/a/b/c/d/e/f"
sage: Q="/a/b/c/"
sage: os.path.commonprefix([P,Q])
'/a/b/c/'
sage: Qn=os.path.normpath(Q)
sage: Qn
'/a/b/c'
sage: os.path.commonprefix([P,Qn])
'/a/b/c'
sage: os.path.relpath(P,Q)
'd/e/f'
sage: os.path.relpath(P,Qn)
'd/e/f'
sage: os.path.commonprefix([P,Q]) == Q
True
sage: os.path.commonprefix([P,Qn]) == Qn
True
```
Of course we do have:

```
sage: Q="/a/b/../b/c/"
sage: os.path.commonprefix([P,Q])
'/a/b/'
sage: os.path.commonprefix([P,Q]) == Q
False
sage: Qn=os.path.normpath(Q)
sage: Qn
'/a/b/c'
sage: os.path.commonprefix([P,Qn]) == Qn
True
```
so we should make sure that `SAGE_LIB` and `SAGE_SRC` are normalized at some point.

I don't think they need to be made "real path"s. If people have `ln -s /usr/local /usr/global` and they refer to files via both paths, they deserve that the system doesn't recognize them as identical. Of course, if sage decides to "real path" something, then it should do that, (probably SAGE_ROOT), once, and derive all its paths from that. Certainly at this point we should just trust what we get.

Doing the change manually...

I think it is a clear improvement. I am waiting for the test suite, to be on the safe side.

Do you agree with my review commit? Do you think the co_filename and co_firstlineno thingy should be taken care of here, or elsewhere?

For the buildbot failure, from looking at the log there are tests which fail in

```
sage -t src/sage/modular/modform/numerical.py  # 2 doctests failed
sage -t src/sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_element.pyx  # 2 doctests failed
sage -t src/sage/rings/real_double.pyx  # 2 doctests failed
```
due to the results falling outside of the tolerance (so should not be affected by this ticket, plus I only use the buildbot/patchbot as possible failures, i.e. it can give false negatives).

Also please forgive my nitpicking, but would you be willing to change

```
        test that #15184 is fixed::
```
into

```
        Test that :trac:`15184` is fixed::
