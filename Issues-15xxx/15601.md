Add a class `PowerSeries_pari` for power series based on PARI's `t_SER` type.  At least if the base ring is a finite field, this is much faster than the existing implementation based on NTL polynomials.

Keywords: pari series performance

<a id='comment:3'></a>The current branch enables the new power series class if the base field is of type `FiniteField_pari_ffelt`, since it yields a noticeable improvement at least in that case.

Here is a more or less random example with power series over a PARI finite field.

Setup:

```
sage: F.<a> = FiniteField(29^10)
sage: v = [F.random_element() for i in range(100)]
sage: w = [F.random_element() for i in range(100)]
sage: R.<x> = PowerSeriesRing(F, implementation=....)
sage: f = R(v, 100); g = R(w, 100)
```
Timings (with `-c -r 1`, in milliseconds):

```
           pari     poly
R(v, 100)  0.252    23.6
f.list()   0.460    6.28
f + g      0.0328   0.204
f * g      6.24     6.64
~f         6.84     29.6
f^2        3.2      6.44
```

This was adapted from `power_series_poly.pyx`.  I would prefer to solve this using

```
poly = self.polynomial()[n]
```

def __init__(self, parent, f=0, prec=infinity, check=True)
```
is missing an `INPUT:` block. Moreover, it seems that the argument `check` makes *functional* changes to `__init__` and I don't know if that is supposed to be like that.

I suggest to rename `check=True` to `value_from_pari=False` and replace `if not check and isinstance(f, pari_gen):` by `if value_from_pari:`.

**EDIT**: maybe it's better to move this code completely out of `__init__` and make a new classmethod `def construct_from_pari()` which bypasses `__init__` completely.

It is very old code from

Thanks.  I see that the deprecated function alias is almost 2 years old, so removing it is fine.

Just out of curiosity: did you have a particular reason for changing `"""` to `r"""` in some docstrings?  As far as I know this is only needed if the docstring contains backslashes that should be left alone.
