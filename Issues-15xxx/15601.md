Add a class `PowerSeries_pari` for power series based on PARI's `t_SER` type.  At least if the base ring is a finite field, this is much faster than the existing implementation based on NTL polynomials.

<a id='comment:3'></a>The current branch enables the new power series class if the base field is of type `FiniteField_pari_ffelt`, since it yields a noticeable improvement at least in that case.

Here is a more or less random example with power series over a PARI finite field.

Setup:

```
sage: F.<a> = FiniteField(29^10)
sage: v = [F.random_element() for i in range(100)]
sage: w = [F.random_element() for i in range(100)]
sage: R.<x> = PowerSeriesRing(F, implementation=....)
sage: f = R(v, 100); g = R(w, 100)
```
Timings (with `-c -r 1`, in milliseconds):

```
           pari     poly
R(v, 100)  0.252    23.6
f.list()   0.460    6.28
f + g      0.0328   0.204
f * g      6.24     6.64
~f         6.84     29.6
f^2        3.2      6.44
```

<a id='comment:22'></a>1. Replace `PY_TYPE_CHECK` by `isinstance`.

2. Is this still relevant?

```
# Substitution of p-adic numbers in power series is
# currently not implemented in PARI (2.5.5).
```

3. This looks fishy:

```
if isinstance(n, slice):
    # get values from slice object
    start = n.start if n.start is not None else 0
    stop = self._prec if n.stop is None else n.stop
    if stop is infinity:
        stop = self.polynomial().degree() + 1
    step = 1 if n.step is None else n.step

    # find corresponding polynomial
    poly = self.polynomial()[start:stop]
    if step is not None:
        coeffs = poly.padded_list(stop)
        for i in range(start, stop):
            if (i - start) % step:
                coeffs[i] = 0
        poly = self._parent._poly_ring()(coeffs)
```
I think you can (more or less) replace all the above code by

```
coeffs = self.padded_list()[n]
poly = self._parent._poly_ring()(coeffs)
```

This was adapted from `power_series_poly.pyx`.  I would prefer to solve this using

```
poly = self.polynomial()[n]
```
to also handle negative `start`/`stop`/`step` correctly.  Unfortunately, the `__getitem__()` methods of polynomials do not yet implement `f[start:stop:step]` with `step != 1`.

is missing an `INPUT:` block. Moreover, it seems that the argument `check` makes *functional* changes to `__init__` and I don't know if that is supposed to be like that.

I suggest to rename `check=True` to `value_from_pari=False` and replace `if not check and isinstance(f, pari_gen):` by `if value_from_pari:`.

**EDIT**: maybe it's better to move this code completely out of `__init__` and make a new classmethod `def construct_from_pari()` which bypasses `__init__` completely.

Interesting question. Looking at the code, it seems to be the same as ordinary division.

It is very old code from

Thanks.  I see that the deprecated function alias is almost 2 years old, so removing it is fine.

Just out of curiosity: did you have a particular reason for changing `"""` to `r"""` in some docstrings?  As far as I know this is only needed if the docstring contains backslashes that should be left alone.

Either it was more of a habit (i.e., I didn't notice I did it) or I was being paranoid about things.
