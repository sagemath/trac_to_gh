The Murnaghan-Nakayama formula is a recursive formula for  a character value of the symmetric group (for the statement, look at the second paragraph of Mark Wildon's answer http://mathoverflow.net/a/134620/9672 on mathoverflow, or Theorem 2.4.7 in *Representation Theory of the Symmetric Group* by James and Kerber).

Some additional comments:

I don't see the point of making these static methods attached to `Partition`. That is not the natural place I would look for them. Furthermore, `get_chi` is a very non-descriptive name and needs to be changed. Actually, these might best as a normal method attached to `SkewPartition` (with a redirect in `Partition` with the skew being the empty partition).

I agree with Dima that the `get_chi_recursive` should not be public since it is essentially an internal function.

The `ALGORITHM:` block is over-indented (this is because it only (as it should) has one colon).

Do not return `None` if there is a check failure; raise an error message as intended.

Why are the keys for `refDict` strings and not the data as a tuple?

Please follow Python naming conventions (`lower_case` variable names). Also, try to avoid the extra blanklines.

Thanks for the comment.

Working on all issues Dima and tscrim mentioned. I have a few questions though.

1. Are all the docstring rules the same for internal function? (i.e. Do I just copy/paste the entire docstring for the current get_chi_recursive())?
2. The reason why I use static is 
    i. it seems unnatural to call something like lda.get_chi(mu, alpha). And user will have to make Partition Object first before they can call the function. 
    iii. I do not rely on any methods from Partition/Skewed-Partition Object and I cannot figure out how to extract the underlying list from a Partition Object (.get_part() does not look like a nice option...)
3. By redirecting, you mean on the docstring or make a redirect in function call? Please teach me how to do if you mean docstring.
