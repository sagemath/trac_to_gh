[Maxima uses CL FORMAT function wrongly](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/oRpkswzpK38/rNVbVN2RyEcJ), resulting in outputting wrong number of digits for floats (one extra), and 
contradicting its own manual on fpprintprec. In particular it outputs too many digits on ix86 and ix86_64, which got in Sage's doctests. As a result, doctests fail on ARM.

The fixes are to convert the results into `RealField(prec)`, with appropriate `prec` 
(at least 54, or sometimes more). This ticket also fixes ARM-specific numerical noise stemming 
from various other upstream problems, such as `eglibc` loss of precision in `lgamma`.

No : I mean if some poor user types "help(Gamma)" and gets explained in the examples to type "RealField(54)(Gamma(6))", then that is bad.

I propose to let the computation be just "Gamma(6)" and add a tolerance comment to check the answer ("# abs tol 1e-11"). That way we have a good doc and a correct test, hence a nice doctest.

How about putting what you suggest into the Examples section, and things like `RealField(54)(Gamma(6))` into the Tests section
(latter with a proper comment, explaining what's going on)?

It seems to me that converting to a `RealField` is not only (possibly confusing) noise for the reader; it could also hide potential future precision bugs.

Is there any chance that the Maxima bug will get fixed soon?

Also, maybe I misunderstand, but what makes conversion of floats into a `RealField` with *higher* precision suppress numerical noise (mentioned in the ticket description)?

all I know about this is in the thread cited in the ticket description.

probably it should be classified as "numerical noise", but as "precision/formatting/rounding bugs". And the latter are Maxima, and perhaps also the ECL's interpretation of a particular case of undefined behaviour.   Hmm, perhaps it's also some specifically Sage problem:

```
sage: .4980113944988315
0.498011394498831
sage: .49801139449883150
0.498011394498832 
```
Conversion into `RealField(54)` appears to fix this discrepancy (I don't know why).

```
sage: RealField(54)(.49801139449883150)
0.498011394498832
sage: RealField(54)(.4980113944988315)
0.498011394498832
```

By the way, Python behaves differently, but still confusing :

```
$ python
Python 2.7.5 (default, Aug 25 2013, 00:04:04) 
[GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 5.0 (clang-500.0.68)] on darwin

```
In particular that `55` at the end being printed as `53`, and rounding `56` at the end as `60`, but keeping `55` as just `55`.

One reason against just putting ellipses is that this is a sure way to hide this problem forever...

Part of the subtlety is that the real number whose decimal expansion is `.4980113944988315000000...` does not have a finite binary expansion:

```
sage: a=.4980113944988315
sage: a.prec()
53
sage: a.str(base=2)
'0.011111110111110110101100101111000110100001100111111010'
sage: b=.49801139449883150
sage: b.prec()
54
sage: b.str(base=2)
'0.0111111101111101101011001011110001101000011001111110101'
sage: c=.498011394498831500000000000
sage: c.str(base=2)
'0.0111111101111101101011001011110001101000011001111110100111111111110011011100001100100101'
```
At least this is consistent with normal rounding rules.

There is another subtlety, namely that `a` is a `RealLiteral` and remembers its decimal expansion, which demonstrates its effect when you convert `a` into a field with higher precision.  (See also [sort:date/sage-devel/c2Ih4uglTgQ/siUeEa4fz64J this sage-devel discussion](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/sage-devel/RealLiteral).) Instead of extending by 0, it gives the same binary expansion as `c`:

```
type(a)
<type 'sage.rings.real_mpfr.RealLiteral'>
sage: RealField(c.prec())(a).str(base=2)
'0.0111111101111101101011001011110001101000011001111110100111111111110011011100001100100101'
```
Now I don't know if this is what behind your observation; at least the output of `elliptic_e()` seems to be a `RealNumber`, not a `RealLiteral`.

> One reason against just putting ellipses is that this is a sure way to hide this problem forever...

Yes, but I'd say the same holds for the `RealField(prec)(0.123)` solution...  I tend towards `# abs tol`/`# rel tol` as the least invasive solution, although that could also hide precision bugs.

on different platforms Maxima's `elliptic_e()` outputs different number of digits.

```
Maxima on ARM:
(%i1) elliptic_e(0.5, 0.1);
(%o1)                          .4980113944988315

as compared to x86_64:
(%i1) elliptic_e(0.5, 0.1);
(%o1)                         .49801139449883153 
```

(and Maxima with different Lisps does different things on the same platform, too - in some case just 14 digits...)

Actually, as you mention, on `x86_64` the number of digits is too big for `RealField(53)`. I have no idea whether this is handled gracefully by Sage, or not.

> Yes, but I'd say the same holds for the `RealField(prec)(0.123)` solution...  I tend towards `# abs tol`/`# rel tol` as the least invasive solution, although that could also hide precision bugs.

Could it be solved by setting Maxima's `fpprintprec` option to the correct value depending on the platform?  I think `RealField(53)` prints numbers with 15 significant digits.  In Maxima with ECL on x86_64 (`sage --maxima`), I get

```
(%i19) fpprintprec: 13;
(%o19)                                13
(%i20) elliptic_e(0.5, 0.1);
(%o20)                          .49801139449883
(%i21) fpprintprec: 14;
(%o21)                                14
(%i22) elliptic_e(0.5, 0.1);
(%o22)                         .498011394498832
(%i23) fpprintprec: 15;
(%o23)                                15
(%i24) elliptic_e(0.5, 0.1);
(%o24)                         .4980113944988315
(%i25) fpprintprec: 16;
(%o25)                                16
(%i26) elliptic_e(0.5, 0.1);
(%o26)                        .49801139449883153
```
so `fpprintprec` should presumably be set to 14.  Maybe we could do something like first setting `fpprintprec` to 15, count with how many digits Maxima prints `1/3.0`, and then adjusting `fpprintprec` by how much this differs from 15.

This seems to correctly set the `fpprintprec`; on my x86_64 system it leads to lots of doctest failures where the number of digits printed is now one less than before.

how do you get this output?
Is it printed by Sage, or by Maxima, or by ECL?

For me ECL prints something like

```
>> (float (/ (expt 10. 3) 3))                   
333.33334
```
even though

```
>> (float-precision (float (/ (expt 10. 3) 3)))
24
```

Attachment: **[maxfpprintprec.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket15921/maxfpprintprec.patch.gz)**

On both ARM and x86_64, the only noticeable effect of setting `maxfpprintprec: 21` (see [attachment: maxfpprintprec.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket15921/maxfpprintprec.patch.gz)) is that Maxima now prints floating point numbers in (-1, 1) starting with `(-)0.` instead of just `(-).`.  This is of course fairly limited, but still nice.  In a stand-alone Maxima compiled with GCL or SBCL, it actually yields one extra digit of accuracy (meaning that the last digit is in general wrong, but it not rounded away and thereby corrupting the previous digit).  I could not find an example where this happens on ECL, so that Sage would benefit from it.

It seems that we still need a separate fix for the following doctest failures on ARM (note that the last two are identical, so we could remove the first one):

I wonder about the `# For ARM: rel tol 2e-15` tag.
How does it work? Or is this just a comment?

I did timings of tests on ARM and added `#long time` to these above certain thresholds.

It's not 100% clear what changes you propose. Can you do a reviewer's git branch (or a patch)?

Or is this just a comment? \n\nThe `rel tol 2e-15` is a magic marker telling the doctest framework not to complain about numerical errors smaller than this tolerance; see [Special markup to influence tests](http://sagemath.org/doc/developer/coding_basics.html#special-markup-to-influence-tests).  The comment \"for ARM\" is just a comment to clarify that the error can be this large on ARM.  Normally the relative error in basic functions like the gamma function should be roughly bounded by 2e-16 (since this is approximately 2<sup>-52</sup> and doubles have 53 bits of precision) and hence be invisible when printing with 16 decimal digits of precision.\n\n> > \n> > I'm happy with the other changes you made, even though they don't really seem to be related to ARM, Maxima or precision.

The `rel tol 2e-15` is a magic marker telling the doctest framework not to complain about numerical errors smaller than this tolerance; see [Special markup to influence tests](http://sagemath.org/doc/developer/coding_basics.html#special-markup-to-influence-tests).  The comment "for ARM" is just a comment to clarify that the error can be this large on ARM.  Normally the relative error in basic functions like the gamma function should be roughly bounded by 2e-16 (since this is approximately 2<sup>-52</sup> and doubles have 53 bits of precision) and hence be invisible when printing with 16 decimal digits of precision.

I wonder why it takes so long on ARM; when testing `show_default()` on an x86_64 it only seems to take 316 microseconds for the first time (`%timeit -n 1 -r 1 show_default()`) and an average of 11.4 microseconds when running it many times.

OK, coming soon.

Here is a reviewer branch, let me know if you think this is a good approach.

I am actually not too happy with making these error tolerances too large in the case of the gamma function; I would say this is such an elementary function that it should really be correct up to the last one or two bit.  Hence it would also be reasonable to decide that these are really bugs in whichever library this is implemented in on ARM, and hence should keep giving doctest failures on ARM.

The problem is that then it is hard to run patchbots on an ARM system, as they will always return failures...

If I understand correctly (from your comments on this tickets and [here](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/eglibc/+bug/713985)) the failure arises because of a bad eglibc implementation of `lgamma` (log gamma), so it should really be fixed upstream.

Now I just noticed on [http://www.eglibc.org/](http://www.eglibc.org/) that eglibc is no longer maintained.  Is it recommended to use the normal glibc on ARM nowadays, and does the bug also exist there?

I don't think a change in upstream will help us.  Besides, I see printing too many digits as a feature in this case, since printing 17 decimal digits guarantees exact conversion of floats with 53 bits of precision.

What explains the difference between ARM and x86_64 in the cases of interest for us is just floating point noise.  There are only two Maxima-related affected doctests.  The first one is

```
sage: from sage.functions.bessel import _Bessel
sage: _Bessel(20,algorithm='maxima')(5.0)
27.70330052128944e-12   # ARM
27.703300521289436e-12  # x86_64
```
In this case, the number of digits does differ, but the correct answer is 2.770330052128941687...e-11, so the last 1-2 digits are wrong in both cases.

Another issue here is that this example has two digits before the decimal point, instead of one.  This is apparently an ECL issue, since Maxima on GCL or SBCL only prints one digit before the point.

The second relevant doctest is

```
elliptic_e(0.5, 0.1)
0.498011394498831  # ARM
0.498011394498832  # x86_64

Here the number of digits is the same, and the correct answer is 0.49801139449883153311546...

So I think for these two doctests we should just specify a tolerance.

> As for the eglibc issue, I'm in favor of increasing the tolerance there. At the end of the day that seems to be a valid implementation choice as for how to implement tgamma, and 2 ulp isn't the end of the world.

For the gamma(10) doctest the relative error is roughly 1.3e-15 (9 ulp).  OK, it isn't the end of the world, and it doesn't seem to increase for larger arguments, but one would expect the gamma function to have a smaller error (which is the case for other architectures, according to the glibc Info manual).

perhaps I should clarify the issue that is behind the gamma-function related things.
One can have the same C code for x86_64 and for ARM which will produce different FP results, if one uses the `long double` type.
The latter is 16 bytes on x86_64, but only 8 bytes on ARM. I'm 99% sure this is the problem behind the eglibc issue.

Agree. In general we should probably err on the lenient side for RDF evaluation, its a speed vs. accuracy tradeoff.
