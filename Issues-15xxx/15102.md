The sage python library includes gmp.h, but gmp.h (on Sage (the distribution)) is actually mpir.h. On other platforms things might look different.

Its probably best to use gmp_or_mpir.h provided by csage (part of #14726), to avoid confusion.

(There is no item "python-sage" in the Component dropdown. Hope "misc" is ok.)

What's wrong with just keeping `<gmp.h>`? MPIR will install its header also as `<gmp.h>`, so you get the "correct" header no matter where GMP or MPIR was installed.

I agree with Jeroen, we should close this ticket as invalid/won't fix.

On top of that, we can now build Sage on top of gmp and mpir indifferently.
