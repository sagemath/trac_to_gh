The following opens jmol with a black window:

```
sage: polytopes.n_cube(3).plot()
```
This is a regression caused by #14358, which removed the script file to launch jmol.

I'm not entirely sure this is the right fix, does it work when Java is not available?

On the other hand, it seems that command-line viewing without Java never worked.

We could change the default viewer to tachyon when Java is not available, but perhaps on a new ticket.
