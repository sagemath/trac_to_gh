The following opens jmol with a black window:

```
sage: polytopes.n_cube(3).plot()
```
This is a regression caused by #14358, which removed the script file to launch jmol.

On the other hand, it seems that command-line viewing without Java never worked.

We could change the default viewer to tachyon when Java is not available, but perhaps on a new ticket.
