Faber-Manes-Viray published an algorithm to compute the automorphism group of a morphism of P1, "Computing conjugating sets and automorphism groups of rational functions."

Translate their code to work with the existing frame work of dynamics in Sage.

We've modified (and documented) the FMV automorphism group algorithms to fit into the implementations in Sage for morphisms of projective space. There are a fair number of changes to the original code, but the algorithms are unchanged.

Reviewed code and came up with a list of minor changes and some issues with the functionality:

- Add comment before use of Subset stating that unordered subset selection works for QQ
- In the rational fixed points function, add example demonstrating the iso_type parameter
- Elaborate on the set W referenced from ln 134 onwards in comments
- ln 126, 259, change ZZ to F
- ln 237, 253, 269, change K(s) to s when appending
- ln 287: 'We have proved that to In [FMV] it is proven that'
- ln 332: remove "an automorphism of P^1"
- ln 385: B=copy(A)
- ln 394: remove 'multiplicative'
- remove 'get_orders'. Change 'PGL_order' to be 'order' and have it call 'PGL_repn'. Fix ln 775 where 'getorders' is called (don't forget to sort by order)
- import 'CRT' -> 'from sage.rings.arith import CRT'
- ln 464: Integers in not imported
- ln 498: describe 'moduli' as integer prime powers
- in CRT_automorphisms: define M (see CRT_helper ln 430). Output also includes M
- 'd' is not needed
- 'CRT_automorphisms' can pass an empty list ot CRT_helper if there are no degree 'd' automorphisms. If it does encounter an empty list it needs to not pass it (or its moduli) to CRT_helper.open (maybe not since the map is injective)
- ln 521: 'automorphim'
- ln 534: ending comma not needed. add defaults. add that automorphisms are matrices. Deleted commented out code
- ln 532: 'M' is an integer (product of prime powers)
- ln 563: comment explaining 'scalar*a - (scalar*a/M).round()*M' instead of (scalar*a).lift()
- ln 568: condense 'if' use max(abs(aa),abs(bb),abs(cc),abs(dd)), from previous change don't need absolute value.
- ln 664: comment about del needs to start at the end not to have issues
 
automorphism_group_QQ_CRT
- defaults for keywords
- OUTPUT: remove 'as linear fraction transformations'
- line 735: h=h/(gcd(h,h.derivative())), Actually do this as done on line 1260
- line 738: points -> point
- line 766 Q -> QQ
- line 772: not needed comment line
- line 788-789: A or [B and (C1 or C2)], missing []
- line 797: QQ
- line 805: extra line
- line 815: extra line
- line 827: QQ
- line 178, 851, 852: k in never incremented
- CRT does not seem to actually be used very well. It checks all lifts for one prime (which sine the reduction map is injective should find all the maps). This is highly inefficient when the height bound is high.
 
automorphism_group_FF
- remove authors part to top of file
- algoritm -> use citation
- default for return_functions
- examples, add keywords
- line 920 938, 941 extra line
 
- line 948: determines
- line 949 yy has wrong number quotes
- 972: no need for y
- 983: X is not used
- 1006: use sigma not ssigma, delete 1045
- 1057: just use poly_ring not R
- 1052-1053: why scaling to have constant term of numerator be 1
- 1059-60 could use poly constructor R(ff), R(gg)
- 1131: use citation
