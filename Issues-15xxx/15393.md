Faber-Manes-Viray published an algorithm to compute the automorphism group of a morphism of P1, "Computing conjugating sets and automorphism groups of rational functions."

Translate their code to work with the existing frame work of dynamics in Sage.

<a id='comment:11'>**Comment 11:**</a>
Reviewed code and came up with a list of minor changes and some issues with the functionality:

- Add comment before use of Subset stating that unordered subset selection works for QQ
- In the rational fixed points function, add example demonstrating the iso_type parameter
- Elaborate on the set W referenced from ln 134 onwards in comments
- ln 126, 259, change ZZ to F

- 'd' is not needed
- 'CRT_automorphisms' can pass an empty list ot CRT_helper if there are no degree 'd' automorphisms. If it does encounter an empty list it needs to not pass it (or its moduli) to CRT_helper.open (maybe not since the map is injective)
- ln 521: 'automorphim'
- ln 534: ending comma not needed. add defaults. add that automorphisms are matrices. Deleted commented out code
- ln 532: 'M' is an integer (product of prime powers)
- ln 563: comment explaining 'scalar*a - (scalar*a/M).round()*M' instead of (scalar*a).lift()
- ln 568: condense 'if' use max(abs(aa),abs(bb),abs(cc),abs(dd)), from previous change don't need absolute value.
- ln 664: comment about del needs to start at the end not to have issues
