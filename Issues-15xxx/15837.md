If `T` is a Tachyon object and `P` is a Graphics3d object, `T + P` could return a Tachyon object, or some object subclassed from Tachyon, by extracting the tachyon string of `P` and combining it with that of `T`.  This would make it possible to convert Graphics3d objects to Tachyon objects by adding them to an empty tachyon scene.
