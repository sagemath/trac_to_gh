This tickets implements a thematic tutorial about the different representations of real numbers in Sage, and when it is convenient to use them.

The doc is not yet finished, but should be quite soon.

You missed in your list `sage.rings.complex_mpc.MPComplexField(prec)` (that is using `mpc_t` from [the mpc library](http://www.multiprecision.org/index.php?prog=mpc).

And I think that it would be good to list the upstream libraries (gmp, mpfr, mpir, arb, mpc, etc) and describe their data structures (`mpz_t`, `mpq_t`, `mpfr_t`, etc).

And in your table at the begining you do not mention `RealLazyField` (`RLF`). Is that on purpose?

I agree, the problem is that the syntax for independent rst tutorial is not the same as for Sage thematic tutorial. Since we will have a workshop on experimental mathematics soon that might get some feedback by participants, let us plan the branch to the end of the month, so that there is no versionning issue.

As far as i understand, this interface is not used within Sage, since a custom representation with two MPFR is used instead. I am not sure whether it is for historical reasons, or if the Sage own implementation is faster, or what. Do you know the differences/advantages/drawbacks with Sage custom implementation ? It could be nice to explain that in the section about complex numbers, but i am not sure it should enter the table at the beginning.

Thanks for the suggestion, i will add a column about "Upstream libraries" in the table.

> and describe their data structures (`mpz_t`, `mpq_t`, `mpfr_t`, etc).


I fear that it is too much "under the hood" compared of the rest of the tutorial, since the end user is not supposed to touch that (or maybe i am wrong). While the main question of the tutorial is "which representation to use for which purpose", we could make a dedicated section about "how to use them low-level", but i do not want to mix that with the simpler examples, not to fear the newcomer.

Yes, it was on purpose, like the real litterals, it is a "transitional field", but not something the user is supposed to define. This explains a dedicated section. Note that i did not mention cyclotomic fields either. I am not sure if the table is supposed to be exhaustive or if it should show the main representations.

Yes and no. I think that it would make sense to have a section "how to use C-functions on real numbers". That can also be a "more advanced" tutorial on real numbers. That would also be the occasion to clean the various implementations.

Indeed, but from a technical perspective I think that RLF is actually something that should be used in constructions. For example, the QQ-module generated by 1 and pi should be something like

```
sage: QQ + QQ*pi
```
Or even more useful, number field + uniform random element in [0,1], etc.
