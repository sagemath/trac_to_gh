```
The attempt to create an embedded number field morphisms for non-embedded number fields currently fails (and should of course fail).

```
sage: L.<i> = NumberField(x^2 + 1)
sage: K = NumberField(L(i/2+3).minpoly(), names=('i0',), embedding=L(i/2+3))
sage: from sage.rings.number_field import number_field_morphisms
sage: number_field_morphisms.EmbeddedNumberFieldMorphism(R, self)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
RuntimeError: maximum recursion depth exceeded in __instancecheck__
```
However, instead of running into an infinite recursion, a quick and simple `ValueError` (or perhaps `TypeError`) should be raised.

Hi Simon,

I'm trying to review this ticket, but there are a couple of things I don't understand:
* why can't `EmbeddedNumberFieldMorphism` try using the algebraic closure by itself?
* even if it really can't, is the giant `except` clause on line 6194 of `number_field.py` necessary?
* shouldn't

  ```python
              Lemb = Lemb.codomain() # number_field_morphisms.pyx:187
              while Lemb.coerce_embedding() is not None:
                  Lemb = Lemb.coerce_embedding().codomain()
                  ambient_field = pushout(Kemb, Lemb)
  ```
  read

  ```python
              Lemb = Lemb.codomain()
              while Lemb.coerce_embedding() is not None:
                  Lemb = Lemb.coerce_embedding().codomain()
              ambient_field = pushout(Kemb, Lemb)
  ```
  ?

Sorry if these are stupid questions, I'm still trying to learn how this all works!

My attempt at simplifying the code based on these remarks is at `u/mmezzarobba/embedded_NF_morphisms`.

Any remark on this Simon?

If you're too busy, I'll just have a look for myself and try to take some action to get this merged.

Sorry, I don't recall, and at the moment I am too much occupied with other things.

Yes, unless I wanted to see if the pushout exists in each step (catching the error if it does not exist).

So do I (now) ;-)

I'm ok with Marc changes.

My only concern is that it might be the case that previously catched errors are not anymore, only ValueError are.
Not sure how it could break the coercion system as before such errors would just lead to returning nothing and now errors might be raised.

I've just added some doc about which ambient field is tried by default.

If nobody feels concerned as I do about the uncatched errors (maybe the coercion framework already deals with them in a correct way, it just too late to try to remember about that), the let's get this merged.

Hmm, `CDF` is actually tried *before* the algebraic closure of the pushout, contrary to what the description you wrote suggests. (That's what Simon's patch was doing, and I tried to leave the results of successful calls unchanged in mine.) I think we should either swap the corresponding items in the docstring, or try the algebraic closure first if this order makes more sense.

Since no one seems to know in what scenarios these except clauses are supposed to be used (and the patches + tickets they come from do not make it clear to me), I thought we could remove them for now and add them back later, with tests triggering them, if necessary. But please feel free to change back the code to catch more exceptions if you disagree.

Oops, in fact, I took back the description with what I built on top of the original Simon branch, and there I tried CDF last.
It seemed to make more sense to me to test it after the algebraic closure which a priori is smaller.
So I'd be in favor of changing the current behavior and not the doc.

I agree with that plan.
