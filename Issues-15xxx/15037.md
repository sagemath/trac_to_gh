When you give the `ModularFormsRing` constructor invalid input, it returns a badly formed error message, as follows:

```
sage: ModularFormsRing(3.4)                                      
...
ValueError: Group (=%s) should be a congruence subgroup
sage: ModularFormsRing(Gamma0(2), base_ring=PolynomialRing(ZZ,x))
...
ValueError: Base ring (=%s) should be QQ, ZZ or a finite prime field
```
