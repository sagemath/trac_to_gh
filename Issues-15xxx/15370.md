Currently the sage_mode spkg assumes that the `SAGE_DATA` is defined. This was deprecated in #13123, and will be removed in sage-6.0 (the git version).

I believe proper place to install the sage-mode is under `SAGE_LOCAL/share/emacs/site-lisp/sage-mode`.

<a id='comment:1'></a>There is a new spkg up at https://bitbucket.org/gvol/sage-mode/downloads/sage_mode-0.10.spkg

It should work with both git and non-git versions of sage.
