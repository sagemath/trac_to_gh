Add a patch from Paul Zimmermann which significantly speeds up MPC multiplication (although it is still noticably slower than `ComplexField` which is based on MPFR).

I have added a new function `mpfr_fmma` (and its companion `mpfr_fmms`) in the development version of MPFR. This function is now used in the development version of MPC. Those functions should be faster than the patch used in this ticket. Please could someone update the timings with those new functions?

1. Get the development (svn) version of MPFR.
2. Get the development (git) version of MPC, and check that configure finds `mpfr_fmma` and it is used in `mpc_mul`.
3. Rebuild Sage with those version of MPFR and MPC.

PS: the 1.74ms for ComplexField in 1024 bits looks dubious to me, if you compare to 0.77ms for 360 bits. What is the command used for those timings?

Jeroen, please could you redo the timings with the new `mpfr_fmma` from the development version of MPFR (as indicated in comment [comment:11]), and publish the code you used in the description so that we can reproduce your timings?
