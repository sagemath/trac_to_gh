In Sage 5.11:

```
sage: from sage.structure.proof.proof import get_flag
sage: get_flag?
Type:       function
String Form:<function get_flag at 0x17e0398>
File:       /home/zimmerma/Downloads/sage-5.11/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/structure/proof/proof.py
Definition: get_flag(t=None, subsystem=None)
Docstring:
   Used for easily determining the correct proof flag to use.

   EXAMPLES:
      sage: from sage.structure.proof.proof import get_flag sage:
      get_flag(False) False sage: get_flag(True) True sage: get_flag()
      True sage: proof.all(False) sage: get_flag() False
```
Clearly the example part is corrupted.

This ticket aims to fix globally similar problems in the whole library.

I think that the issue is not, for the most part, people producing incorrectly formatted docstrings, but rather docstrings dating from the pre-Sphinx days which used the old style of

```
EXAMPLE:
    sage: ...
```
So maybe a better option is to change the `sphinxify` function (which I think is responsible for producing these formatted docstrings) to replace "EXAMPLE(S?):\n text" with "EXAMPLES::\n\n text". That change should be an easy regexp operation and should fix most of these problems.

This makes sense from a developer's point of view, but the current state of affairs could be very confusing to users. Fixing it, at the expense of confusing developers, seems like a worthwhile trade. 

Here's a patch. We could add a warning ("Warning: old-style docstring detected") or something like that.
