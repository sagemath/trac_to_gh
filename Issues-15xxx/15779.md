I guess the optional spkg `database_sloane_oeis-2005-12.spkg` could be removed.

The package contains a `sloane-oeis.bz2` which expands to a 20.165.423 Bytes file `sloane-oeis`. This file has 113134 records (apparently sorted by "OEIS lexicographic order"):

```
A000004 ,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
A112316 ,0,0,0 ...
```

On the other hand the module `\src\sage\databases\sloane.py` downloads a current file `http://oeis.org/stripped.gz` (17.971.650 Bytes). 

This expands to a 45.252.744 Bytes file with 236976 records (including the 4 header records):

```

# OEIS End-User License: http://oeis.org/LICENSE

A000002 ...
```

sloane.py also downloads `http://oeis.org/names.gz` with (8.330.058.251 Bytes (expanded 20.853.789 Bytes) and some same number of records as strippd.gz:

```
# OEIS Sequence Names (http://oeis.org/names.gz)

# OEIS End-User License: http://oeis.org/LICENSE
A000001 Number of groups of order n.
A000002 ...
```
`stripped` contains more than double the number of sequence records compared to `sloane-oeis`. Often the sequences have additional elements. The new file may also contain corrected errors ...

Comparing the sequences of the outdated spkg with the current list of sequences there are `about 2.000 sequences with errors`. 
This is without counting those that only acquired some new initial elements (like 0, 1, -1, or 2) or those that grew longer.

The spkg should clearly to be removed!
