It's pretty obvious that there is a problem.  This was reported in the thread:

   https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-cloud/8NgkWfTbU78

There is an easy 1-line fix, which is to replace the line

```
if os.access (filename, os.X_OK) and not os.path.isdir(f):
```
with

```
if os.access (filename, os.X_OK) and not os.path.isdir(filename):
```

at the beginning of the "which" function.

So, are we going to update `package-version.txt`?

The changelog entry in `SPKG.txt` refers to `.p6`, but we could also just delete the whole changelog (later?).

In the latter case, should `package-version.txt` still refer to `.p5`? ;-)

But here we actually change a patch to `pexpect`, so...
