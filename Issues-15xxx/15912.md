Assume a student who, in a mood of serendipity, plays with Sage. While both pari and Sage use on the order of 10ms to compute the divisors of 20!:

```
? divisors(20!)

sage: divisors(Integer(20).factorial())
```

the actual time for screen output is much different, where I would estimate pari with less than 100ms but Sage with about 2.5 sec in a terminal on a 3GHz machine. The list has 41040 entries. Sage seems to buffer the stuff somewhere before actual output, and this appears to take a lot of CPU.

You can imagine what happens with 30! where both Sage and pari need 1-2 sec for computation. I had to interrupt Sage after a minute to see this backtrace:

It seems ipython's behaviour is different if I say in ipython:

```
print range(10**6)       # case 1, fraction of a second, output in ONE line

range(10**6)             # case 2, ten seconds, 10^6 lines
```
and the difference is not due to the actual output, but presumably the formatting of the one-value-per-line output.

So, at least people wanting to catch a big output can work around the issue by saying `print` or giving the command.

```
sage: %pprint
Pretty printing has been turned OFF
```
