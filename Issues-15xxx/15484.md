<a id='comment:32'></a>Hi Travis,

I'm still going through and adding more to the documentation, but some things (including some corrections) may be better completed by you.  (I have the arXiv versions of Molev's references that you've listed, but I do not have a copy of the book you referenced.)  For example:

- You've implemented the method `defining_polynomial`, but I cannot find that in my references.  Moreover, in the references I do have, the notation you've used for the defining polynomial seems to be reserved for matrices whose entries are power series.

- I think there is an antipode method missing from the main `Yangian` class (and the `counit_on_basis` method, according to the documentation, returns the antipode).  

- Add definitions for the coproduct, counit, and antipode.  I added the coproduct definition already for the `Yangian` class.

- Can/should the Yang R-matrix also be added to this module?

This is the level `\ell` version, so they become polynomials instead of power series.

No, that is because I could not implement the antipode as it is defined in terms of an inverse matrix of power series. There is a ticket (I don't remember the number offhand) that gives a default implementation of the antipode in connected graded Hopf algebras.

In the `counit_on_basis`, that is a typo from copy/pasting.

> - Add definitions for the coproduct, counit, and antipode.  I added the coproduct definition already for the `Yangian` class.


Let me know when you're done with your changed, and I can add them.

> - Can/should the Yang R-matrix also be added to this module?


It would make for a good follow-up.
