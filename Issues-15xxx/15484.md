<a id='comment:24'></a>Andrew, no problem.

Darij, I've added some references. A good reference is the MNO94 arXiv version.

This is the level `\ell` version, so they become polynomials instead of power series.

> - I think there is an antipode method missing from the main `Yangian` class (and the `counit_on_basis` method, according to the documentation, returns the antipode).  


No, that is because I could not implement the antipode as it is defined in terms of an inverse matrix of power series. There is a ticket (I don't remember the number offhand) that gives a default implementation of the antipode in connected graded Hopf algebras.

In the `counit_on_basis`, that is a typo from copy/pasting.

> - Add definitions for the coproduct, counit, and antipode.  I added the coproduct definition already for the `Yangian` class.


Let me know when you're done with your changed, and I can add them.

> - Can/should the Yang R-matrix also be added to this module?


It would make for a good follow-up.
