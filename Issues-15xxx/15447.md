It would be nice to be able to call PARI closures from Sage.  Currently, calling a PARI object assumes that it is a polynomial:

```
sage: T = pari('n->n+1')
sage: T.type()
't_CLOSURE'
sage: T(3)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
PariError: incorrect type in poleval
```
With the patch, one gets the expected answer:

```
T(3)
4
```

Keywords: pari closure

<a id='comment:13'></a>PARI allows default values for arguments; without the arity check one can do

```
sage: f = pari('(x, y=3) -> x/y')
sage: f(2)
2/3
```
On the other hand, omitting the arity check altogether is not an option since passing too many arguments gives unexpected results (and moreover a look at the source code of `closure_callgenvec` suggests that this could lead to memory corruption):

```
sage: f(1,2,3,4,5)
4/5
```
Figuring out the default values from the `t_CLOSURE` doesn't seem worth the trouble, leaving two reasonable options:
- either don't bother supporting PARI default values
- or check for `nargs <= arity` and allow PARI to substitute default values, including its convention to set any unspecified arguments to 0
I don't have a strong preference.
