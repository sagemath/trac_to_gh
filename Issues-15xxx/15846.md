```
The series expansion of the zeta function around its singularity at `s=1` is incorrect. Within Sage, we have

```
sage: zeta(x).series(x==1,2)
(Infinity) + (zetaderiv(1, 1))*(x - 1) + Order((x - 1)^2)
```

when in fact, we should have

```
sage: zeta(x).series(x==1, 1)
1*(x - 1)^(-1) + (euler_gamma + log(2) + log(pi) + 2*zetaderiv(1, 0)) + Order(x - 1)
```

(see http://dlmf.nist.gov/25.2.E4 for the expansion like it is supposed to be.)

Depends on #18237

I *think* I may have tracked down the reason for this back to SymPy. There, we have

```
>>> from sympy import zeta, gamma
>>> from sympy.abc import x
>>> gamma(x).series(x, x0=0, n=1)
1/x - EulerGamma + O(x)
```

that is, expanding the gamma function at a pole works. However, for the zeta function:

```
>>> zeta(x).series(x, x0=1, n=1)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
sympy.core.function.PoleError: Cannot expand zeta(_x + 1) around 0
```

This could be fixed by implementing `_eval_nseries` directly for `zeta` (which can be found at `local/lib/python/site-packages/sympy/functions/sepecial/zeta_functions.py`) intelligently enough such that the pole at s=1 is handled. Unfortunately, I think there has to be a discussion first how to handle the coefficients in this expansion (cf. http://dlmf.nist.gov/25.2#E4).

Well, although there definitely is that problem in SymPy, the erronous expansion in sage seems to originate from Ginac:

(zeta(1))+(zetaderiv(1,1))*x+Order(x^2)
```

This is exactly the output as in sage itself.

The zeta function does not seem to be very popular in that matter. ;-)

Neither with Maxima, which is invoked via `taylor`:

```
sage: taylor(zeta(x),x,1,1)
...

Could you please add the exact output you expect from `series` to the ticket description?

I managed to find a fix for the problem in GiNaC, which should -- more or less -- directly translate into a fix for Pynac, which Sage uses as a substitute for GiNaC.

When using zeta's functional equation http://dlmf.nist.gov/25.4.E2 for the series expansion around `s=1`, then within GiNaC, I obtain the expression now stated in the description.

For a follow-up ticket, it would probably be nice to tell sage that `zetaderiv(0,1)` is equal to `-log(sqrt(2*pi))`, as it simplifies the expansion to the more likeable form 

```
sage: zeta(x).series(x==1, 1)
1*(-1+x)^(-1)+(euler_gamma)+Order(-1+x)
```

Maxima probably has a similar problem like SymPy, GiNaC et al.; I guess we should report the issue there as well?

I just compiled sage with the patch added to pynac, and now I get

```
sage: zeta(x).series(x==1, 1)
1*(x - 1)^(-1) + (euler_gamma + log(2) + log(pi) + 2*zetaderiv(1, 0)) + Order(x - 1)
```

Seems to work. :-)

So, in order to get this ticket resolved and have the fix in Sage, what is the best way to proceed from here? I'd certainly like to commit the changes to your github mirror -- but what happens then?

Well, as of yet I have done nothing, really (except for fixing this thing locally). ;-)
But I guess I could also submit my changes there, the official GiNaC version also has the same problem w.r.t. the expansion of zeta. (However, the version on git wouldn't compile for me yesterday, so for fixing this I initially used the tarball on their website...)
