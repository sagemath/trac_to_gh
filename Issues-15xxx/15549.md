Clean up the construction of PARI objects by inlining some functions and initialising the `_refers_to` dictionary only when necessary.

Before:

```
sage: %timeit -r 1 pari(0)
1000000 loops, best of 1: 1.02 us per loop
```
After:

```
sage: %timeit -r 1 pari(0)
1000000 loops, best of 1: 875 ns per loop
```

Also modify gen.__init__() to raise an error instead of creating a gen object wrapping NULL.

That was a typo; I don't know why I didn't simply copy-paste this...
