# Issue 15423: Add auto-rebasing mechanism for Cygwin

As explained in the old description, it is often necessary when building Sage on Cygwin to *rebase* its DLLs.  This is the process of updating the default base addresses in memory at which a list of DLLs are loaded, such that none of those DLLs overlap each other in memory (in the normal case that they do overlap, Windows relocates them, but this frequently leads to fork errors in Cygwin).

This ticket solves the problem by running the `sage-rebase.sh` script as part of the `sage-spkg` script at the end of every package installation.  It also runs `sage-rebase.sh` after `make sagelib` for the same reason.  Although running it after installing each package is generally unnecessary, *sometimes* it is necessary.  For example, after installing Python, it's necessary to rebase to ensure that Python works, as it will be used later in the build process.  Since rebasing doesn't actually add much overhead in terms of time, it's fine to just do it always (on Cygwin).

Note that this also uses `sage-rebase.sh` versus `sage-rebaseall.sh`.  The difference is that the former only updates DLLs in Sage itself (i.e. under `$SAGE_LOCAL`) whereas the latter also rebases all DLLs in the Cygwin installation.  Because of this, the latter cannot be run from inside Cygwin--all Cygwin processes must be stopped first.  Obviously this would be too disruptive to the normal Sage build process, so we don't do that.  It's also unnecessary.  As long as `rebaseall` is run once after installing Cygwin and all build dependencies, it will build a database of known DLLs and their base addresses and sizes, which can be referenced when rebasing new DLLs.  Since building Sage doesn't affect any of the Cygwin system DLLs there's no need to rerun `rebaseall` during a build of Sage.

Fixing this is necessary for unattended Sage builds to succeed--otherwise the build will fail several times and require manual rebasing before proceeding.

### Old Description
With Sage 5.12 (plus a few updated spkg, all of them available on trac), building Sage on Cygwin(32) is no harder than on Linux except for the need of rebasing a few times during the build process.
This could be automated in the following way
* try to build
* if that fails and we're on Cygwin,
* grep the failing logs for error messages cuased by fork issues
* if all erros are caused by fork issues:
  * rebase (using the oblivious option which can be run from bash, I think the script we included some time ago are ok),
  * go back to step one
* if not fails as usual

Having this would open the way to a buildbot or a patchbot for Cygwin.

I've found it simpler (and I have a patch) to just always rebase after every package build.  It doesn't actually add much noticeable overhead.  One thing I might want to do before pushing my patch is also make it so the `--quiet` flag can be passed through to rebase, since otherwise this sometimes generates a bit of noise that isn't helpful.

I would say this is almost necessary for Cygwin builds; especially in an automated context like running the patchbot.

The difference is that the former only updates DLLs in Sage itself (i.e. under `$SAGE_LOCAL`) whereas the latter also rebases all DLLs in the Cygwin installation.  Because of this, the latter cannot be run from inside Cygwin--all Cygwin processes must be stopped first.  Obviously this would be too disruptive to the normal Sage build process, so we don't do that.  It's also unnecessary.  As long as `rebaseall` is run once after installing Cygwin and all build dependencies, it will build a database of known DLLs and their base addresses and sizes, which can be referenced when rebasing new DLLs.  Since building Sage doesn't affect any of the Cygwin system DLLs there's no need to rerun `rebaseall` during a build of Sage.
+
+Fixing this is necessary for unattended Sage builds to succeed--otherwise the build will fail several times and require manual rebasing before proceeding.
+
+### Old Description
 With Sage 5.12 (plus a few updated spkg, all of them available on trac), building Sage on Cygwin(32) is no harder than on Linux except for the need of rebasing a few times during the build process.
 This could be automated in the following way
 * try to build

In `src/Makefile.in`, is this really needed for the rebase script to work?

```
    (cd $(srcdir)                                       \
     && export SAGE_ROOT=/doesnotexist                          \
           SAGE_SRC=/doesnotexist                           \
           SAGE_SRC_ROOT=/doesnotexist                          \
           SAGE_DOC_SRC=/doesnotexist                           \
           SAGE_BUILD_DIR=/doesnotexist                         \
           SAGE_PKGS=$(abs_top_srcdir)/build/pkgs                   \
           SAGE_CYTHONIZED=$(abs_builddir)/build/cythonized             \
```

If not, it would be cleaner to write the rebase script on a new line instead of continuing with `&&`.

Minor comment which you might as well fix: you don't need the parentheses `(cd ... && ...)`. Those just create an extra subprocess for no reason.
