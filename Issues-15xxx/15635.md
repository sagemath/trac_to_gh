<div id="comment:25" align="right">comment:25</div>

Here's some comments after taking a look:

- I'm not sure about using `<` to denote the pre-Lie product in Sage, as python does something subtle, but very natural, with triple comparisons:

```
sage: A = FreePreLieAlgebra(QQ,'x,y')
sage: A.gens()
Family (B[x[]], B[,[]], B[y[]])
sage: x,a,y = A.gens()
sage: x < x < x
B[x[x[]]]
sage: (x < x) < x
B[x[x[], x[]]] + B[x[x[x[]]]]
sage: x < (x < x)
B[x[x[x[]]]]
sage: x < x and x < x   # This is equivalent to x < x < x
B[x[x[]]]
```
Instead I think you should let `*` denote the pre-Lie product and have the free pre-Lie algebra be in `MagmaticAlgebras` (perhaps `.Unital()`?). Thus rename `pre_Lie_product_on_basis` to `product_on_basis`.

- You shouldn't need `_coerce_impl` since the default when `_coerce_map_from_` returns `True` is to go through `_element_constructor_`.

- I think you should not use the `__ngens` idiom, but instead use the more explicit `len(self.algebra_generators())` or `self.algebra_generators().cardinality()`.

- For the `return Family(self._alphabet, lambda a: self.term(self.basis().keys()(a)))` should be consistently ordered...

Thanks Travis for your comments. I have done something for the first three, but I do not
understand the last one.

I removed the shortcut `<` alltogether. Using `*` is almost as good.

I removed `coerced_impl` and it still works.

I used `len(self.algebra_generators())`.

Thanks! The last one was that line was commented out with a line above it saying about `Family` not returning a consistent ordering, which is not correct as I understand it.

I plan to do a full review over this weekend.

I made some review changes:

- I added `algebras.FreePreLie` and made this the standard entry point.
- I moved the main explanation doc from the module level to the class. I also made some minor tweaks to the doc overall.
- I also renamed the file by removing the `s` as this is the standard in Sage AFAIK.
- I changed the output of `algebra_generators` as per my previous point. The ordering should be consistent as this was something we changed awhile ago.
- Subsequently, I changed around some things so that it works with infinite generating sets.
- I changed the `some_elements` and implemented an `an_element` method.

If you're happy with my changes, then you can set a positive review.

PS/EDIT - It would be nice to have the trees with specified labels, as this would allow the generic implementation of `an_element` and removing of the `_alphabet` parameter (well, pushing it down a level).

Thanks a lot for your work on that ticket. I have not yet got time to look at your changes seriously.

**I do not quite agree**. Most people would not call them algebras, because they are NOT associative

> - I moved the main explanation doc from the module level to the class. I also made some minor tweaks to the doc overall.

> - I also renamed the file by removing the `s` as this is the standard in Sage AFAIK.

No problem with removing s

> - I changed the output of `algebra_generators` as per my previous point. The ordering should be consistent as this was something we changed awhile ago.
> - Subsequently, I changed around some things so that it works with infinite generating sets.

Great !

> - I changed the `some_elements` and implemented an `an_element` method.
> 
> If you're happy with my changes, then you can set a positive review.

The first point is problematic in my opinion.

> PS/EDIT - It would be nice to have the trees with specified labels, as this would allow the generic implementation of `an_element` and removing of the `_alphabet` parameter (well, pushing it down a level).

yes, I agree !

Thanks for fixing the module list (I didn't have time until this afternoon to come back to this).

I understand your point, but what would people call them, non-associative algebras? The one of the current thoughts is to rename `MagmaticAlgebras` to `Algebras` and add axioms like "associative" (#15043). Also, what do you say about [Jordan algebras](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_algebra) being in the catalog?

Irregardless of nomenclature, I would say that having this as a global entry point doesn't harm anyone as the name is clear (and there's no danger of confusion), it is documented that it not associative, it makes it discoverable, and `FreePreLieAlgebra` in the global namespace IMO adds some clutter.

Another option would be to create a (stub) category for pre-Lie algebras, werhich might be bett for the long term, and have a method `free` similar to:

```
sage: Groups().free(names='x,y,z')
Free Group on generators {x, y, z}
```
(and something similar should probably be done for associative unital algebras).

* Jordan algebras are not in the catalog, as far as I can see (6.7.beta4)

* if J is a Jordan algebra, then `J in Algebras` returns False

So I really think that the catalog 'algebras' should be kept for associative algebras.

Maybe this should be discussed on sage-devel or sage-combinat-devel ?

> * if J is a Jordan algebra, then `J in Algebras` returns False

Hmm...this would definitely create an mild inconsistency in the current state with `Algebras` being associative and unital (at least in the global namespace; for imports, I would say the implementor should be aware of what assumptions are being made).

This is now https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/uXN5619Fg54.

Given the discussion on sage-devel, would you be okay with letting this stay in the algebras catalog?
