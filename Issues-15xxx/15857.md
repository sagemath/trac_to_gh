Jereon gives official permission to change the license statement on his code.

Included in this ticket should be fixing the official copyright statement in the developer's manual.

I decision was made years ago fairly unanimously by the Sage developers to make the core library GPLv2+.   You make a compelling argument, and I think it's very reasonable to revisit the decision today.  However, since it's a decision with potentially serious implications, it would be best to post a vote on sage-devel about this, and if the majority decision is to switch to GPLv3+, then still have a time period before we actually make the switch.   What do you think?

Does that mean you give your clear permissions to allow us to change your contributions to the sage library from GPLv3+ to GPLv2+ and update the statement in the reference manual?
