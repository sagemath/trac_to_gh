I decision was made years ago fairly unanimously by the Sage developers to make the core library GPLv2+.   You make a compelling argument, and I think it's very reasonable to revisit the decision today.  However, since it's a decision with potentially serious implications, it would be best to post a vote on sage-devel about this, and if the majority decision is to switch to GPLv3+, then still have a time period before we actually make the switch.   What do you think?
