GSL distributions are used in the creation of random matrices, so they need to be seeded with an integer from Sage's random number generators in order to make the results predictably random.  Then the random matrices will be reproducible for doctests (#10122) and for WeBWorK homework exercises provided by AskSage with a random seed from the WeBWorK system.  Symptomatic of the current state is:

```
sage: from sage.matrix.constructor import random_rref_matrix
sage: MS = MatrixSpace(QQ, 5, 8)

sage: set_random_seed(666)
sage: first = [random_rref_matrix(MS, 4) for _ in range(10)]

sage: set_random_seed(666)
sage: second = [random_rref_matrix(MS, 4) for _ in range(10)]

sage: first == second
False
```

Do not merge this ticket as-is.  #15887 fixes the underlying issue with GSL. (Jason thinks this ticket should either be closed, or just the doctests should be put into the library, but not the code changes.)
