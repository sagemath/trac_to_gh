Add more groups accessible through `groups.presentation.` tab completion. This patch finishes off all named groups of order 15 or less, but not all groups associated with a universal name are implemented. The goal of this functionality is to make group presentations a topic more accessible to undergraduate students.

Depends on #14813 and #14791 for the named finitely presented groups infrastructure, and #14913 for computations with fp groups.

It doesn't seem like you're using `wrap_FpGroup`, so could you remove that from the imports? Looks good to me otherwise. Thanks.
