I like everything about your changes except the following.  (I had actually thought about doing this but figured I'd not want to cause merge issues and also save for another ticket - but hey, here you've done it!)

```
-            # verify that this operation does not modify the passed dictionary (#6622)
+            Verify that this operation does not modify the passed dictionary (:trac:`6622`)::

```
This is fine, but needs to be dedented.  Note how it's exactly at the same indentation level as the immediately following doctest.
