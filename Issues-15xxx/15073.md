Gloops `:-P`

Well, thank for for fixing that. But shouldn't you rename the file to `.p1` instead ? I honestly don't know, I just assumed that "no number" behaves like `.p0` `:-)`

(And if this turns out to be the right thing to do, you would unfortunately have to update the SPKG.txt file again too... `^^;`)
