There seems to be some bug in the HTML generation... The docstring of the function `RandomGNP` in the file "sage/graphs/generators/random.py" contains

```

```

Calling `./sage --docbuild reference html` creates some output with unequal and wide spacing (file: "doc/output/html/en/reference/graphs/sage/graphs/graph_generators.html"). 

**Update**: As mentioned in the comments this behaviour is alright but the reference names should not be numbers.

On the other hand, if a simple list (entries starting with "-") is used instead of a proper reference list (entries starting with "..") then the square brackets like "[1]" do not have any function and one cannot use them as reference links in the text (e.g. "[1]_"). Hence, for a simple list, numbers in square brackets might be left out.

---

- This patch changes reference names in `sage/graphs` from numbers to proper names if they are used by reference links. 

- It also revises the docstrings of the `cluster*` functions in "generic_graph.py" (as suggested in the comments).

- Furthermore, it do not seem to be standard that the execution flag of `*.py` files is set. Hence, they are removed from "sage/graphs/generators/families.py" and "sage/graphs/graph_generators.py".

---

Just a side note: If only a docstring of a file in "sage/graphs/generators/" is changed and `./sage -b` is run, then `./sage --docbuild reference html` does *not* recognize the docstring change. My workaround is to make a modification to "sage/graphs/graph_generators.py" each time to trigger the necessity of a rebuild of the html reference.

I see. Hence, the proper way to state a reference is by using ".." and a proper reference name in square brackets. I am attaching a patch that corrects all reference sections under `sage/graphs` that have reference links to them.

Just noted that for
`RandomGNP` of `sage/graphs/graph_generators_pyx.pyx`,
`RandomGNP` of `sage/graphs/generators/random.py`,
`RandomDirectedGNP` of `sage/graphs/digraph_generators.py`,
the first two references are the same. I will leave it like that...

The usage of "-" seems to create a list with bullets. Hence, it might be only acceptable if none of the entries in the reference section are used by a reference link... I will also leave such lists as they are (though the numbers with square brackets seem to be of not much benefit).

Helloooooooooooo !!

Well, it all seems right. Could I ask you to do a couple of modifications though ? I'm sorry to ask that but I now have a Git version of Sage, and I don't think I could easily produce a diff patch to be applied on top of your mercurial patch, considering that some folders have been renamed in the git version of Sage `^^;`

There are two things, actually :

* `c_i = triangles_i / (k_i\*(k_i-1)/2)` appears three times in `generic_graph.py`, and it would be much prettied if it were `c_i = \text{triangles}_i / \binom {k_i} 2` instead

* `T = 3\*triangles/triads` should be LaTeX code, i.e. <code>\`T = 3\times \text{triangles}/\text{triads}\`</code>

Sorry for that ! Looks like it is my fault, by the way `^^;`

I have rewritten the docstrings of `cluster_triangles, clustering_average, cluster_transitivity, clustering_coeff`. Hope that listing a reference (here: NetworkX documentation) only once for 4 methods is okay. Otherwise one needs to change each instance of the reference... What do you think?

References should be defined once and referenced as often as necessary. If the reference is not specific to the method but referred to in other methods as well then it should probably be defined in the module docstring and not in one of the methods.
