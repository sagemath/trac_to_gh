There seems to be some bug in the HTML generation... The docstring of the function `RandomGNP` in the file "sage/graphs/generators/random.py" contains

```

```

Calling `./sage --docbuild reference html` creates some output with unequal and wide spacing (file: "doc/output/html/en/reference/graphs/sage/graphs/graph_generators.html"). 

**Update**: As mentioned in the comments this behaviour is alright but the reference names should not be numbers.

On the other hand, if a simple list (entries starting with "-") is used instead of a proper reference list (entries starting with "..") then the square brackets like "[1]" do not have any function and one cannot use them as reference links in the text (e.g. "[1]_"). Hence, for a simple list, numbers in square brackets might be left out.

---

- This patch changes reference names in `sage/graphs` from numbers to proper names if they are used by reference links. 

- It also revises the docstrings of the `cluster*` functions in "generic_graph.py" (as suggested in the comments).

- Furthermore, it do not seem to be standard that the execution flag of `*.py` files is set. Hence, they are removed from "sage/graphs/generators/families.py" and "sage/graphs/graph_generators.py".

---

Just a side note: If only a docstring of a file in "sage/graphs/generators/" is changed and `./sage -b` is run, then `./sage --docbuild reference html` does *not* recognize the docstring change. My workaround is to make a modification to "sage/graphs/graph_generators.py" each time to trigger the necessity of a rebuild of the html reference.

I see. Hence, the proper way to state a reference is by using ".." and a proper reference name in square brackets. I am attaching a patch that corrects all reference sections under `sage/graphs` that have reference links to them.

Just noted that for
`RandomGNP` of `sage/graphs/graph_generators_pyx.pyx`,
`RandomGNP` of `sage/graphs/generators/random.py`,
`RandomDirectedGNP` of `sage/graphs/digraph_generators.py`,
the first two references are the same. I will leave it like that...

The usage of "-" seems to create a list with bullets. Hence, it might be only acceptable if none of the entries in the reference section are used by a reference link... I will also leave such lists as they are (though the numbers with square brackets seem to be of not much benefit).

Helloooooooooooo !!

Well, it all seems right. Could I ask you to do a couple of modifications though ? I'm sorry to ask that but I now have a Git version of Sage, and I don't think I could easily produce a diff patch to be applied on top of your mercurial patch, considering that some folders have been renamed in the git version of Sage `^^;`

There are two things, actually :

* `c_i = triangles_i / (k_i\*(k_i-1)/2)` appears three times in `generic_graph.py`, and it would be much prettied if it were `c_i = \text{triangles}_i / \binom {k_i} 2` instead

* `T = 3\*triangles/triads` should be LaTeX code, i.e. ``T = 3\times \text{triangles}/\text{triads}``

Sorry for that ! Looks like it is my fault, by the way `^^;`

Nathann
