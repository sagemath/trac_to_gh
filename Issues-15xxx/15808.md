There was a pyflakes warning about a missing definition. I made a correction in a function call for that reason.

Also made a few pep8 changes.

Do you have a reference for the following manipulations?

```python
if minimal_equation.degree() == 5:
    minimal_disc *= minimal_equation[5]**2
# Multiply with suitable power of 2 of the form 2^(2*(d-1) - 12)
b = 2 * (minimal_equation.degree() - 1)
k = QQ((12 - minimal_disc.valuation(2), b)).ceil()
minimal_disc >>= 12 - b*k
minimal_disc = ZZ(minimal_disc)
```
Is the power of 2 in fact important, given that this is supposed to output the minimal discriminant away from 2?

They are based on looking at the PARI source code. But I must admit that I don't understand everything 100% clearly.

The line

```
if minimal_equation.degree() == 5:
    minimal_disc *= minimal_equation[5]**2
```
is based on

```
  RgX_to_6(polr, &a0,&a1,&a2,&a3,&a4,&a5,&a6);
  I.j10 = !signe(a0)? mulii(sqri(a1), ZX_disc(polr)): ZX_disc(polr);
```

The factor `2^(-12)` comes from

```
I.j10 = gmul2n(I.j10,-12);
```
and the multiplication by `2^(2*(d-1))` comes from

```
dd = polval(polr,gen_2) & (~1); /* = 2 floor(val/2) */
polr = gmul2n(polr, -dd);
```
which multiplies the whole polynomial by a power of 4.
Multiplying a polynomial of degree `d` by a constant `c` multiplies the discriminant by `c^(d-1)`.

> Is the power of 2 in fact important?

I have no idea. I tried to reproduce as best as possible the output of the old `genus2reduction` program. That is also the reason why I emulated the `raw()` method and wrote to `divisors_to_string()` function: to check for myself if the new output was the same as the old output. Modulo some small details, this seems indeed to be the case.

After thinking about this some more, perhaps my code is correct but it depends on the interpretation of "Minimal Discriminant (away from 2)". If you interpret it as "smallest positive integer which occurs as discriminant of a model of the given curve over Z[1/2]", then my code might be correct.

Possibly, but I would be surprised if this definition coincides with the one used by the original `genus2reduction` program.  Anyway, I don't think it makes sense to spend too much time on finding a nice definition for "minimal discriminant away from 2", so any power of 2 in the "minimal discriminant away from 2" is fine with me.
