This should be supported by the top-level `Makefile`:

```
$ make -j4
```

The branch on this ticket implements this for sub-`make`s. For uses of `$MAKE` outside of `make` itself (like building the Sage documentation or Sage library), the value of `-j` given to `make` cannot be determined so this cannot work.
