In particular, sage is incapable of computing the discriminant of this *quadratic* polynomial! I'll shortly post a patch that catches this error and uses the sylvester matrix instead.

Does this help, even though it's singular here and not pari? `RIF` does the same. I haven't worked out yet which resultants get computed by pari and which by singular.

This example still fails with the patch applied.  There seems to be a different problem here, namely that the class of that polynomial inherits from `Polynomial_singular_repr`, even though the base field does not have a conversion to Singular.  The same error occurs when you replace `PowerSeriesRing` by `LaurentSeriesRing` in the original example.

`polynomial_element_generic.Polynomial_generic_field` inherits from `polynomial_singular_interface.Polynomial_singular_repr`. That inheritance was introduced in [35bb3ea](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/35bb3ea22b07ee4477ce70906a4aa7439cdf7bd6) from 2007.

That commit only changed the order of the superclasses; the inheritance was there before.

I agree that it is strange for polynomials over arbitrary fields to inherit from that class.  An alternative would be to "manually" prescribe this inheritance for polynomials over fields that support conversion to Singular, but that doesn't sound very attractive.  Another alternative would be to move `resultant()` to a more generic polynomial class that first tries to use Singular and uses a generic Python implementation in case that fails.

An alternative would be to \"manually\" prescribe this inheritance for polynomials over fields that support conversion to Singular, but that doesn't sound very attractive.\n\n\nI see how [the constructor of PolynomialRing_field](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/blob/master/src/sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_ring.py?id=6.2.rc1#n1467) checks for singular support and sets the `_has_singular` property accordingly. We could use that place to change `element_class` in a suitable way. But if we wanted to handle this using different classes, we'd add one more point to the already dense network of generic vs. special, domain vs. field, sparse vs. dense. Not sure I like that either.\n\n> Another alternative would be to move `resultant()` to a more generic polynomial class that first tries to use Singular and uses a generic Python implementation in case that fails.\n\n\nSounds good. As a first step, we could change [Polynomial_singular_repr](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/blob/master/src/sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_singular_interface.py?id=6.2.rc1#n372) to check `self.parent()._has_singular` and call `super` if that isn't set. We could then make sure that [Polynomial.resultant](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/blob/master/src/sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_element.pyx?id=6.2.rc1#n4798) falls back to `sylvester_matrix` if PARI doesn't work. Although I don't know yet for which rings PARI *will* work. Messy business\u2026",

Replying to [pbruin](#comment%3A10):
> That commit only changed the order of the superclasses; the inheritance was there before.


Thanks, I missed that fact.

> I agree that it is strange for polynomials over arbitrary fields to inherit from that class.  An alternative would be to "manually" prescribe this inheritance for polynomials over fields that support conversion to Singular, but that doesn't sound very attractive.


I see how [the constructor of PolynomialRing_field](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/blob/master/src/sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_ring.py?id=6.2.rc1#n1467) checks for singular support and sets the `_has_singular` property accordingly. We could use that place to change `element_class` in a suitable way. But if we wanted to handle this using different classes, we'd add one more point to the already dense network of generic vs. special, domain vs. field, sparse vs. dense. Not sure I like that either.

> Another alternative would be to move `resultant()` to a more generic polynomial class that first tries to use Singular and uses a generic Python implementation in case that fails.


Sounds good. As a first step, we could change [Polynomial_singular_repr](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/blob/master/src/sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_singular_interface.py?id=6.2.rc1#n372) to check `self.parent()._has_singular` and call `super` if that isn't set. We could then make sure that [Polynomial.resultant](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/blob/master/src/sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_element.pyx?id=6.2.rc1#n4798) falls back to `sylvester_matrix` if PARI doesn't work. Although I don't know yet for which rings PARI *will* work. Messy business…

I wonder whether the docs for `resultant` regarding “Implemented using PARI’s polresultant function.” should get adjusted. On the other hand, I doubt that detailing the possible choices of algorithm is worth the effort.

> (Note in particular that you are supposed to run all doctests; things can really break in unexpected places.)


Did so, and found #16285 in the process. But that's reproducible without your change, so not your fault.

Shouldn't running the testsuite be handled by patchbot? Or hasn't that been migrated to the git workflow yet?
