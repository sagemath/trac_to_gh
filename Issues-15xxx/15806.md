Integrable representations of Kac-Moody Lie algebras are parametrized by dominant weights. They satisfy a character formula which is a straightforward generalization of the Weyl character formula. See Kac, Infinite-dimensional Lie algebras, Chapter 10. The weight multiplicities may be computed using the Freudenthal multiplicity formula, and Kass, Moody, Patera and Slansky (KMPS) in their book Affine Lie algebras, weight multiplicities, modular characteristics and branching rules (1990) gave tables of these for affine Lie algebras. We may duplicate their tables of modular characteristics, weight multiplicities and branching rules using Sage.

This patch creates a class for integrable representations of untwisted affine Lie algebras.

```
sage: Lambda = RootSystem(['A',3,1]).weight_lattice(extended=true).fundamental_weights()
sage: IntegrableRepresentation(Lambda[1]+Lambda[2]+Lambda[3]).print_strings()
3*Lambda[2] - delta: 3 21 107 450 1638 5367 16194 45687 121876 310056 757056 1783324

Lambda[0] + 2*Lambda[3]: 2 18 99 430 1593 5274 16005 45324 121200 308829 754884 1779570
Lambda[0] + 2*Lambda[1]: 2 18 99 430 1593 5274 16005 45324 121200 308829 754884 1779570
```

This creates the representation of `A_3^{(1)}` with highest weight `Lambda[1]+Lambda[2]+Lambda[3]`. It then computes the five dominant maximal weights and the corresponding weight strings. Every weight multiplicity occurs in one of these strings, and by results of Kac and Peterson, they are the Fourier coefficients of modular forms. The code is reasonably fast and I've tested it up to rank 8, comparing the output with the tables of KMPS.

Only untwisted affine Cartan types are implemented in this patch. A number of other methods such as the modular characteristic are available as methods of the class. We can do the branching rules as follows:

```
sage: Lambda = RootSystem(['D',4,1]).weight_lattice(extended=true).fundamental_weights()
sage: v = IntegrableRepresentation(Lambda[2])
sage: v.cartan_type().dynkin_diagram()
    O 4

Hey Dan,

I don't know how much of #14901 you might be able to use, but if you want to use parts of it here, let me know and I can split off the necessary portions.

Also I'd like to see the general Kac-Moody case if it's not too much more work.

Best,

Travis

I agree that it is very desirable to have the general KM case. Can your code compute the multiplicities of the imaginary roots?

There's currently the extended weight space:

```
sage: P = RootSystem(['A', 3, 1]).weight_space(extended=True)
sage: P.basis()
Finite family {0: Lambda[0], 1: Lambda[1], 2: Lambda[2], 3: Lambda[3], 'delta': delta}
sage: P.simple_root(2).scalar(P.simple_coroot(1))
-1
sage: P.simple_root(2).scalar(P.simple_coroot(2))
2
sage: P.simple_root(2).scalar(P.null_coroot())
0
sage: P.basis()['delta'].scalar(P.simple_coroot(0))
0
sage: P.basis()['delta'].scalar(P.simple_coroot(3))
0
sage: P.basis()['delta'].scalar(P.null_coroot())
0
```
and that doesn't that work?

In principle, my code can compute multiplicities of imaginary root space of the KM algebra (once I fix the finitely-presented Lie algebras).

I'm going to hack away at it a bit more tonight to see what other optimizations I might be able to get out of this.

Continuing from previous comment:

Proposition 12.6 describes the dominant maximal weights as follows. They depend only on two things: the level `k` (currently implemented as `self.level()` and a coset of the weight lattice in the root lattice (called the class in KMPS). So different representations with the same level and class will have the same number of dominant maximal weights, and the same number of strings.

The weight lattice P has the classical weight lattice P0 of codimension two. It is obtained from P0 by adjoining Lambda[0] and the nullroot delta. The projection of the dominant maximal weights onto P0 has a simple description. Let F be the fundamental alcove, and let `k F` be the dilation of F by the level. So it is bounded by the innequalities `alphacheck[i] >= 0` for i nonzero, and `alphacheck[0] <= k`, where `alphacheck[0]` is the negative of the highest classical root.

Then the projections of the dominant maximal roots into P0 are just the elements of `k F` that are in the right coset of the root lattice. If these are known, then I don't think it will be difficult to recover the dominant maximal roots. I believe that only the method `dominant_maximal` needs to be reimplemented.

<div id="comment:33" align="right">Comment 33</div>

Here's some code which to get all weights in the `lvl`-dilated dominant chamber:

```
sage: P = RootSystem(['A',4,1]).weight_lattice(extended=True)
sage: La = P.fundamental_weights()
sage: lvl = 3
sage: def next_level(wt):
    return [wt + la for la in La if (wt+la).level() < lvl]
....: 
sage: R = RecursivelyEnumeratedSet([P.zero()], next_level)
sage: list(R)
[0,
 Lambda[2],
 Lambda[4],
 Lambda[1],
 Lambda[3],
 Lambda[0],
 Lambda[3] + Lambda[4],
 2*Lambda[0],
 Lambda[2] + Lambda[4],
 2*Lambda[1],
 Lambda[2] + Lambda[3],
 Lambda[1] + Lambda[2],
 Lambda[1] + Lambda[3],
 Lambda[1] + Lambda[4],
 2*Lambda[2],
 Lambda[0] + Lambda[4],
 Lambda[0] + Lambda[1],
 Lambda[0] + Lambda[3],
 Lambda[0] + Lambda[2],
 2*Lambda[4],
 2*Lambda[3]]
```
if you just want the classical fundamental weights, then do:

```
sage: La = [P.fundamental_weight(i) for i in P.index_set() if i != 0]
sage: R = RecursivelyEnumeratedSet([P.zero()], next_level)
sage: list(R)
[0,
 Lambda[2],
 Lambda[4],
 Lambda[1],
 Lambda[3],
 Lambda[3] + Lambda[4],
 Lambda[2] + Lambda[4],
 2*Lambda[1],
 Lambda[2] + Lambda[3],
 Lambda[1] + Lambda[2],
 Lambda[1] + Lambda[3],
 Lambda[1] + Lambda[4],
 2*Lambda[2],
 2*Lambda[4],
 2*Lambda[3]]
```
I'm not sure how to check if it's in the right coset off-hand.

> I'm not sure how to check if it's in the right coset off-hand.

This is how I think it goes. Add a multiple of Lambda[0] to give it the right level.
Then apply `from_weight`. If it does not give integers, discard. Then subtract the
smallest multiple of delta that makes `(Lambda+rho|Lambda+rho)-(mu+rho|mu+rho)`
positive.

I will try to implement this using `RecursivelyEnumeratedSet` as you suggest.

I added the branching rule from `["X", r, 1]` to ["X", r].

There is one branching rule for every node in the extended Dynkin diagram. The rule corresponding to the affine node was not too hard to add, so I added it.

I added doctests to get full coverage, along with some other tweaks and fixes that I wanted to do. I changed the string representation to remove the "the" to follow Sage's conventions:

```
sage: ZZ
Integer Ring
sage: QQ
Rational Field
```
I also changed the output of `strings` to be a `dict` and implemented `print_strings` to have the formatted printing of the strings you previously had. I also removed the `rho` and `null_root` methods since you can get those from the weight lattice (where they are cached).

However, what notation do you want for the representation, as I believe are using V<sub>\Lambda</sub> and B(\Lambda)?

Not sure I understand the question.

The following takes a long time but is sort of cool:

```
sage: Lambda = RootSystem("E8~").weight_lattice(extended=true).fundamental_weights()
sage: gdim = [x.degree() for x in IntegrableRepresentation(Lambda[0]).branch(depth=4)]
sage: gdim
[1, 248, 4124, 34752, 213126]
sage: oeis(gdim)
0: A007245: McKay-Thompson series of class 3C for the Monster group.

In the example from [comment:57](#comment%3A57) the coefficients are actually those from the cube root of j.

```
sage: R.<q>=PowerSeriesRing(QQ)
sage: j = j_invariant_qexp(5); j
q^-1 + 744 + 196884*q + 21493760*q^2 + 864299970*q^3 + 20245856256*q^4 + O(q^5)

Laurent Series Ring in q over Rational Field

```

Playing around with oeis gives occasional interpretations of characters and string functions.

```
sage: Lambda = RootSystem("A1~").weight_lattice(extended=true).fundamental_weights()
sage: V = IntegrableRepresentation(Lambda[0])
sage: [x.degree() for x in V.branch(depth=10)]
[1, 3, 4, 7, 13, 19, 29, 43, 62, 90, 126]
sage: oeis(_)
0: A029552: Expansion of phi(x) / f(-x) in powers of x where phi(), f() are Ramanujan 
theta functions.
sage: V.string(Lambda[0])
[1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 15, 22, 30, 42, 56]
sage: oeis(_)
0: A000041: a(n) = number of partitions of n (the partition numbers).
```
Kac and Peterson showed in general that the string functions and characters have modular interpretation

In #20686, I will mark `TestSuite(V).run()` as `# known bug` because `IntegrableRepresentation` does not properly implement everything needed for its category. For example, it does not implement `zero()`.

These problems were not seen before simply because the category tests were not run. #20686 ensures that the correct tests are run, but then they fail for `IntegrableRepresentation`.
