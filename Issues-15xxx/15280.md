Currently computing the normal form of a lattice polytope of non-zero codimension throws an exception since PALP doesn't cover it. However, the PALP algorithm can easily be extended to cover these cases, as suggested for example in Section 3.2 of http://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/~kasprzyk/research/pdf/normal_form.pdf .
The idea is to simply restrict to the sublattice spanned by vertices of the polytope, compute the normal form there and embed it back into the original ambient space.

In addition I've included affine_normal_form and find_isomorphism, which compute the affine normal form of a lattice polytope and isomorphisms between lattice polytopes, respectively.

Okay, I just made another patch based on the new master branch. I then pushed it here and used -f in order to ignore the previously pushed commits, i.e. I executed git push -f --set-upstream trac HEAD:u/jkeitel/normal_form_codimension

The branch seems to be pushed, that's fine, but there was in error in the trac hooks: 

```
X11 forwarding request failed on channel 0
Counting objects: 16, done.
Delta compression using up to 8 threads.
Compressing objects: 100% (8/8), done.
Writing objects: 100% (8/8), 2.35 KiB, done.

remote: Trac #15280: Commit changed to 4b42b4.

remote:     commit += '\n'.join(self.log_table(newref, limit=FORCED_COMMITS))
remote: UnboundLocalError: local variable 'commit' referenced before assignment To ssh://git@trac.sagemath.org:2222/sage.git

  + 8d4c117...4b42b4a HEAD -> u/jkeitel/normal_form_codimension (forced update)

Branch normal_form_codimension set up to track remote branch u/jkeitel/normal_form_codimension from trac.
```
Afterwards I had to set the commit by hand. That's clearly not part of this ticket, but it might still be something to fix.

Cheers, Jan

I'm putting this to needs_work because #13525 is changing the same methods and one of the two will need to be a dependency of the other.

LatticePolytope now has methods affine_normal_form and find_isomorphism that allows finding isomorphisms between polytopes that are related to each other by an affine transformation, even if the embedding spaces are different.
At the moment I'm using LatticeEuclideanGroupElement, a class that seemed only to be intended for LatticePolytope_PPL for the affine maps. Is there a better alternative? I need affine maps between different dimensional vector spaces.
Also, the maps may be over QQ and while I've written a short hack to extend LatticeEuclideanGroupElement to do that, that's probably not the best solution.

This definitely needs some close attention while rebasing, as I am looking at the first four differences and they are
- Format of the constructor call which is not really used anywhere in Sage, so why should it be here???
- `return` after another `return`
- `_desc` popping which should not be there since there is no more `_desc`
- Resurrection of old convoluted code for the number of facets instead of the new one-liner.

Jan, it would be better also to try to take advantage of the switch rather than just making things work:

```
vertices = matrix(QQ, self.vertices_pc().column_matrix().transpose())
```
can be written more naturally as

```
vertices = matrix(QQ, self.vertices_pc().matrix())
```
which is shorter and does not require double transposition of a cached matrix. Or perhaps as

```
vertices = self.vertices_pc().matrix().change_ring(QQ)
```
Sorry for annoying rebasing, but in the long run it should be nice to have uniform behaviour for polytopes and cones/fans.

Inspired by Nathan / Volker arguments about filters for cached functions: I didn't quite liked how `normal_form` was changed in #13525 to accept parameters that make it return different output types. It used to be straightforward

```
@cached_method
normal_form(self)
```
and with this ticket it gets more and more complicated, which makes it unclear how (and whether) it should be cached. I also found it annoying that this conditional output propagates down to helper functions.

So how about this:
- Drop arguments to helper functions so that their output is stable and if something has to be done to it, the caller does not have to parse argument to decompose and recompose the output appropriately. Am I right that permutation/transformation don't cost much time to compute in addition to normal form? Certainly permutations are trivial when read from the PALP output.
- Perhaps only the default-algorithm normal form has to be cached: with all the associated data, but only once and during each call `normal_form` will drop unnecessary pieces?

Another option is to make `normal_form` always return everything, but given the name I think `normal_form()` should return just the normal form and nothing else or it gets confusing. Besides, while I agree that it is nice to have extra data, I used normal form a lot by itself, so it is useful on its own.

If the transformation is computed in the same way no matter what algorithm has been used, then probably it can be computed directly in `normal_form` if necessary.

On the bright side, since these details do not affect user interface, there is no worry about deprecations and waiting.

Here are some timings, showing that the effect of computing the permutations can in fact be largely neglected:

```
sage: o = lattice_polytope.cross_polytope(2)
sage: %timeit o._palp_native_normal_form(permutation=False)
10 loops, best of 3: 43.8 ms per loop
sage: %timeit o._palp_native_normal_form(permutation=True)
10 loops, best of 3: 43.9 ms per loop
sage: %timeit o._palp_modified_normal_form(permutation=False)
10 loops, best of 3: 36 ms per loop
sage: %timeit o._palp_modified_normal_form(permutation=True)
10 loops, best of 3: 36.1 ms per loop
sage: %timeit o._normal_form_full_dimensional(permutation=False)
10 loops, best of 3: 8.91 ms per loop
sage: %timeit o._normal_form_full_dimensional(permutation=True)
10 loops, best of 3: 9.12 ms per loop
```

However, the same tests show (again) that our python implementations from #13525 are really, really slow:

```
sage: o = lattice_polytope.cross_polytope(4)
sage: %timeit o._palp_native_normal_form(permutation=False)
1 loops, best of 3: 33.7 s per loop
sage: %timeit o._palp_native_normal_form(permutation=True)
1 loops, best of 3: 33.6 s per loop
sage: %timeit o._palp_modified_normal_form(permutation=False)
1 loops, best of 3: 1.4 s per loop
sage: %timeit o._palp_modified_normal_form(permutation=True)
1 loops, best of 3: 1.38 s per loop
sage: %timeit o._normal_form_full_dimensional(permutation=False)
10 loops, best of 3: 11.2 ms per loop
sage: %timeit o._normal_form_full_dimensional(permutation=True)
10 loops, best of 3: 11.5 ms per loop
```

The following isn't really relevant for this ticket, but the reason that they are so slow are the calls to GAP:

Maybe that could be improved at some point. In any case, I'll now remove the permutation flag.

Of course, the diamond is very simple and it may be different for other polytopes, but then again you usually want to do something beyond normal form computation and that something is likely to take much more time.
