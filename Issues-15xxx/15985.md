```
Python 3 accepts only absolute imports and explicit relative imports. 
To be Python 2 compatible all affected modules need <code>from \`__future__\` import absolute_import</code>.

`lib2to3/fixes/fix_import.py` does not add this `__future__` import.

Therefore we intend to use an enhanced fixer from `https://pypi.python.org/pypi/future/0.11.3`.

The latest development version also handles imports of pyx modules.

Changes according to `libfuturize/fixes/fix_absolute_imports.py`:

```
If spam is being imported from the local directory, this import:
    from spam import eggs
becomes:
    from .spam import eggs

and this import:
    import spam
becomes:
    from . import spam
```

This ticket is tracked as a dependency of meta-ticket ticket:15980.

Can I read this proposal as:

Do the (absolute) imports as `import sage.somewhere.amodule as am` and then use it as `am.a_function(a_parm)`.

Perhaps the module could recommend its "standard" abbreviation (here `am`). Such a convention might help while reading code that uses the module.
