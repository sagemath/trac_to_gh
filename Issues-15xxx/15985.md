```
Python 3 accepts only absolute imports and explicit relative imports. 
To be Python 2 compatible all affected modules need `from __future__ import absolute_import`.

`lib2to3/fixes/fix_import.py` does not add this __future__ import.

Therefore we intend to use an enhanced fixer from `https://pypi.python.org/pypi/future/0.11.3`.

The latest development version also handles imports of pyx modules.

Changes according to `libfuturize/fixes/fix_absolute_imports.py`:

```
If spam is being imported from the local directory, this import:
    from spam import eggs
becomes:
    from .spam import eggs

and this import:
    import spam
becomes:
    from . import spam
```

This ticket is tracked as a dependency of meta-ticket ticket:15980.

<a id='comment:10'></a>As your numbers indicate (and from my personal experience), there is definitely an unofficial convention to use absolute from..import statements in the sage library, i.e. `from sage.foo import bar`; however this is one of (if not the main) culprit behind the circular import issues of the Sage library. A lot of the circular import issues could be resolved by just importing a module, and not particular attributes of the module (i.e. using `import sage.foo` or `import sage.foo as bar` and using `sage.foo.baz`/`bar.baz` instead of `from sage.foo import baz`).

How did you determine that this is the "last step"? In other words, how did you determine which modules need to be fixed?

There are still plenty of `.py` and `.pyx` files which do not have `from __future__ import absolute_import`.
