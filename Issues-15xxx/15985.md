```
Python 3 accepts only absolute imports and explicit relative imports. 
To be Python 2 compatible all affected modules need `from __future__ import absolute_import`.

`lib2to3/fixes/fix_import.py` does not add this __future__ import.

Therefore we intend to use an enhanced fixer from `https://pypi.python.org/pypi/future/0.11.3`.

The latest development version also handles imports of pyx modules.

Changes according to `libfuturize/fixes/fix_absolute_imports.py`:

```
If spam is being imported from the local directory, this import:
    from spam import eggs
becomes:
    from .spam import eggs

and this import:
    import spam
becomes:
    from . import spam
```

This ticket is tracked as a dependency of meta-ticket ticket:15980.

So it looks like the issue that you are getting into is the wonder that is affectionately referred to as Sage's import hell :).

Looking at the traceback, it looks like the issue is a circular import that mysteriously works right now: `sage.rings.rational` imports something from `sage.rings.fast_arith` which imports something from `sage.rings.integer_ring` which imports something from `sage.rings.rational_field` which imports `sage.rings.rational`.

This is one of the big reasons why Sage is not truly usable as a python library, because the order in which you import Sage is incredibly delicate, and seems to magically work (and as you can see from this patch which shouldn't change anything, it truly is magical). There hasn't been much effort to fix this, but I would say that getting Python 3 working is a pretty big motivator.

|-------------------|--------|
|lines with "import"| 26,3231|
|- thereof lines with "from sage"| 19,581|
|- thereof lines with "import sage"| 1,650|
|leaving lines with imports from Python

(and 1 explicit relative import :-)|| about 5,000||

Questions:
* Is there agreement in the Sage community that absolute import is the way to go?
* Can it help with the above `ImportError`? And similar ones?
* Other benefits or drawbacks?

Can I read this proposal as:

Do the (absolute) imports as `import sage.somewhere.amodule as am` and then use it as `am.a_function(a_parm)`.

Perhaps the module could recommend its "standard" abbreviation (here `am`). Such a convention might help while reading code that uses the module.

Here is the very small last step. Hopefully the doctests will pass.

For the reviewer: to check, see that (after #21036 is closed)

`futurize -w -f absolute_import src/sage`

does nothing.

How did you determine that this is the "last step"? In other words, how did you determine which modules need to be fixed?

There are still plenty of `.py` and `.pyx` files which do not have `from __future__ import absolute_import`.
