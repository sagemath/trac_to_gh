That would be nice, but when some new patch causes minor output changes, what tends to happen is that the author of the patch modifies the files in `src/sage/tests/` directly, and we port the changes to the book aftwerwards. Of course, it would be better to notify us so that we make the change in the book and provide a patch based on what sagetex outputs. But I don't think it would be very nice to ask people to do thatâ€”especially given that we are not always responsive!  (Doing it "right" will get easier with the switch to git, however.)

That being said, I will see if I can prepare a patch that re-syncs the files in the sage tree with the output of sagetex.
