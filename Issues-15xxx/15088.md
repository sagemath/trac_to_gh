Currently, Sage believes that the valuation of the zero Laurent series is zero (although it is infinite):

```
sage: R.<x> = LaurentSeriesRing(QQ)
sage: zero = R(0)
sage: zero.valuation()
0
```

The attached patch fixes this bug.

It seems to be fixed with the latest version of the patch.

Nevertheless, it would be nice if somebody knowing `sage.schemes.elliptic_curves` and `sage.schemes.hyperelliptic_curves` better than me could double check.
