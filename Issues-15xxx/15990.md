```
Only the modern syntax like `raise E(V)` and `raise E(V).with_traceback(T)` is accepted by Python 3.

Almost all cases change `raise E, V` to `raise E(V)` where V is a string.

**TODO**: 
* Clarify why the cases `with_traceback` were omitted in `libfuturize/fixes/raise.py`. (Perhaps this belongs to *stage 2*?)

Changes according to `lib2to3/fixes/fix_raise.py`:

```
raise         -> raise
raise E       -> raise E
raise E, V    -> raise E(V)
raise E, V, T -> raise E(V).with_traceback(T)
raise E, None, T -> raise E.with_traceback(T)

raise (((E, E'), E''), E'''), V -> raise E(V)
raise "foo", V, T               -> warns about string exceptions

CAVEATS:
   "raise E, V" will be incorrectly translated if V is an exception
   instance. The correct Python 3 idiom is
       raise E from V
   but since we can't detect instance-hood by syntax alone and since
   any client code would have to be changed as well, we don't automate
   this.
```

In more than 500 py modules the raise statement was (simply) changed to the new syntax.

All doctest succeeded but one (see attachment):

```
./sage -t -p --all --logfile=logs/ptestlong-15990l-2.log
...
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage -t src/sage/doctest/forker.py  # 1 doctest failed
```

I have no idea why ...

It looks like it is just a bug in the doctest (it is testing the debugger, so the actual source code ends up being in the output to check).

Otherwise, looks good. (Hopefully this will get merged ASAP before it there are a ton of conflicts again).

Hi Andrew, I am 20 minutes late with the same fix. Thanks!
Fix resolves the above failure (tested OK!).

But my doctest `./sage -tp 4 --all --long >logs/sage-ptestlong-raise-0` had another failure:

```
File "src/sage/interfaces/expect.py", line 1017, in sage.interfaces.expect.Expect._expect_expr
Failed example:
    print sage0.eval("dummy=gp.eval('0'); alarm(1); gp._expect_expr('1')")  # long time
Expected:
    Control-C pressed.  Interrupting PARI/GP interpreter. Please wait a few seconds...
    ...
    AlarmInterrupt:
Got:
    Control-C pressed.  Interrupting PARI/GP interpreter. Please wait a few seconds...

    /home/wluebbe/sage-6.2.beta6/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/interfaces/expect.pyc in _expect_expr(self, expr, timeout)
       1050                 else:
       1051                     break
    -> 1052             raise KeyboardInterrupt(msg)
       1053 
       1054     def _sendstr(self, str):
    <BLANKLINE>
    KeyboardInterrupt:
**********************************************************************
```
The expectation `AlarmInterrupt:` was added by Jeroen in ticket:13311.

Am I the only one to see this failure?
