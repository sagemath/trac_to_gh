```
Only the modern syntax like `raise E(V)` and `raise E(V).with_traceback(T)` is accepted by Python 3.

Almost all cases change `raise E, V` to `raise E(V)` where V is a string.

**TODO**: 
* Clarify why the cases `with_traceback` were omitted in `libfuturize/fixes/raise.py`. (Perhaps this belongs to *stage 2*?)

Changes according to `lib2to3/fixes/fix_raise.py`:

```
raise         -> raise
raise E       -> raise E
raise E, V    -> raise E(V)
raise E, V, T -> raise E(V).with_traceback(T)
raise E, None, T -> raise E.with_traceback(T)

raise (((E, E'), E''), E'''), V -> raise E(V)
raise "foo", V, T               -> warns about string exceptions

CAVEATS:
   "raise E, V" will be incorrectly translated if V is an exception
   instance. The correct Python 3 idiom is
       raise E from V
   but since we can't detect instance-hood by syntax alone and since
   any client code would have to be changed as well, we don't automate
   this.
```

In more than 500 py modules the raise statement was (simply) changed to the new syntax.

All doctest succeeded but one (see attachment):

```
./sage -t -p --all --logfile=logs/ptestlong-15990l-2.log
...
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage -t src/sage/doctest/forker.py  # 1 doctest failed
```

I have no idea why ...

Hi Andrew, I am 20 minutes late with the same fix. Thanks!
Fix resolves the above failure (tested OK!).

But my doctest `./sage -tp 4 --all --long >logs/sage-ptestlong-raise-0` had another failure:

```
File "src/sage/interfaces/expect.py", line 1017, in sage.interfaces.expect.Expect._expect_expr
Failed example:
    print sage0.eval("dummy=gp.eval('0'); alarm(1); gp._expect_expr('1')")  # long time
Expected:
    Control-C pressed.  Interrupting PARI/GP interpreter. Please wait a few seconds...
    ...
    AlarmInterrupt:
Got:
    Control-C pressed.  Interrupting PARI/GP interpreter. Please wait a few seconds...

    -> 1052             raise KeyboardInterrupt(msg)

       1054     def _sendstr(self, str):
    <BLANKLINE>
    KeyboardInterrupt:

```
The expectation `AlarmInterrupt:` was added by Jeroen in ticket:13311.

Am I the only one to see this failure?
