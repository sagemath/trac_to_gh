I happen to think there is a valid reason to insert this easter egg: it might earn Sage a mention in a future xkcd comic, which would be excellent marketing. I can even imagine a "Droste effect" where one of the characters uses Sage, mistypes the xgcd command and sees... him/herself.

My one complaint is the use of an NSFW doctest. Surely we can be less immature than that! (This reminds me of the discovery of "B00B135" in some shipped Microsoft code. Not helpful.)
