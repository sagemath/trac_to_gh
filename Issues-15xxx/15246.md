Reassigning a ticket to "won't fix" *and* giving the positive review by the same person is bad form. I happen to think it's a fun easter egg. Xkcd often does have relevant and highly quotable mathematics-related cartoons.

Ok.

Sorry for misbehaving.

I still think that this has nothing to do here, and that kids should go and play elsewhere.

I happen to think there is a valid reason to insert this easter egg: it might earn Sage a mention in a future xkcd comic, which would be excellent marketing. I can even imagine a "Droste effect" where one of the characters uses Sage, mistypes the xgcd command and sees... him/herself.

My one complaint is the use of an NSFW doctest. Surely we can be less immature than that! (This reminds me of the discovery of "B00B135" in some shipped Microsoft code. Not helpful.)

1. Please remove the alt text as requested by Kedlaya.

2. **Never** use a bare `except:`, always use `except Exception:` or even better, catch a specific exception.

3. Can you avoid the `finally: file.close()` using a `with:` statement?
