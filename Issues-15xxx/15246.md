However before this the question: should this ticket be "won't fix" or should it be given a mile stone again in order to get merged still has to be settled. Right now there only seems to be one person that thinks that this should be "won't fix". So I would say we should give it a mile stone again.

1. Please remove the alt text as requested by Kedlaya.

2. **Never** use a bare `except:`, always use `except Exception:` or even better, catch a specific exception.

3. Can you avoid the `finally: file.close()` using a `with:` statement?
