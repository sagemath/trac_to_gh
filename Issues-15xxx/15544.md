Since we have switched to Git and have this spkg/upsteam directory, it is also indexed it like the other mirrored files. This means, there is a metalink and and torrent file (webseeds only!) for each file. We could use `aria2c` as a nice command-line utility to download the file from all the mirrors with included verification.

E.g.
`/spkg/upstream/ipython/ipython-0.13.2.tar.bz2`
has corresponding files: 
`/spkg/upstream/ipython/meta/ipython-0.13.2.tar.bz2.metalink|.torrent`

The logic should be like this:


    if aria2c exists:
     if corresponding metalink file exists:
      aria2c ...
    else:
     continue with curl, wget, ...

The only complication is, that it doesn't download to stdout. That must be wrapped somehow with a temporary file.
