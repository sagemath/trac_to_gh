It has nothing to do with `ipython` because `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/ipython` is only one of the many scripts which are rewritten by `sage-location`.

Perhaps you should explain why the "hack" in `sage-location` should be removed.

Every hack should be removed. Expecially the ones that implement things that can be achieved easily without hacks.

Hacks are often misleading and complicate issues. Getting rid of them needs more work, but this ticket is meant to just handle this particular case, I came across.

The whole story is: a doctest checks the first line in `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/ipython`. This doctest will certainly fail, if ipython has been disabled (toplevel build system, #14796).

Depends what you mean. The path-rewriting is needed to be able to relocate the Sage install tree.

Let me repeat this: By special-casing `ipython` you are achieving absolutely nothing: the "hack" in `sage-location` still exists and you're just fooling the doctest.

A proper fix for the "hack" would fix all Python scripts, not just this one. What's the point of this special case?

What i mean is, there is no point in requiring the mechanism for `ipython`. Most (maybe not all) cases are like this.

> Let me repeat this: By special-casing `ipython` you are achieving absolutely nothing: the "hack" in `sage-location` still exists and you're just fooling the doctest.


there's a proper doctest in #15146, that does not rely on a wrong ipython installation.

> A proper fix for the "hack" would fix all Python scripts, not just this one. 


Yes.

> What's the point of this special case?


I cannot fix all at once. But before the line has been merged, I will certainly not paste it into the other `spkg-install` files.

You just gave a very good argument for keeping the `sage-location` "hack": it **does** rewrite all the paths at once without trouble. What's wrong with that?

This is pretty similar to the problem about static atlas libraries (#15045): Its always better to not break/complicate things for *all* users just because one CPU/platform is broken/limitied/buggy.

> I think you still need to explain what the problem is that this ticket is trying to fix, I really don't understand it.


Here we go, a more formal argument. read http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulation_(object-oriented_programming). There is a file that takes care of the contents of a package (`spkg-install`). Nothing beyond that is required. Other routines/programs that mess wich package contents, like `sage-location` does, violate encapsulation. Encapsulation, in general, is useful to keep things comprehensible and simple.
