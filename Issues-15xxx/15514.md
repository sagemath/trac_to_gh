Hey! 

I am trying to learn git by trying to make a change to this patch.

So far I did 

```
git trac checkout 15514
```

which apparently created a new branch but I don't see it. Do you happen to know where can I access that branch so that I can actually push some changes here?

Best,

Jernej

I can't really help. I do not use the "git trac" commands.

I would say that this checkout command creates a branch, that you now have to modify what you want in the code and create a commit, then that you have to push it ... But really I do not know what the "git trac" commands do.

Without the git trac commands the following should work:

git checkout -b my_new_branch develop # creates a new branch where develop is
\# Do your changes to Sage
git commit -a # turn all your change into a commit (the equivalent of a hg patch)
git push trac HEAD:u/azi/adding_option_for_computing_a_total_dominating_set

Excellent ! Well, it all looks good except your optimization for the objective function.

1) Really, you are solving a NP-Hard problem and you are saving on a list ? `:-P`

2) Actually, this code is slower than the previous one:

```
sage: p = MixedIntegerLinearProgram()
sage: b = p.new_variable(binary=True)
sage: %timeit sum(b[x] for x in range(1000))
10 loops, best of 3: 77.1 ms per loop
sage: %timeit p.sum(b[x] for x in range(1000))
1000 loops, best of 3: 1.09 ms per loop
```

This is because a "sum of LP variables" is a "linearfunction" object, and that adding to it another LP variable creates a second linearfunction object, which is mostly a copy of the previous one. Thus, `b[0]+b[1]+....+b[n]` creates `n` linearfunction objects and has a quadratic complexity.

That's why `p.sum` was created: as p.sum is dedicated to linearfunctions, it handles the, in the best way, without creating useless intermediate objects.

Nathann

P.S. : If you fix this in a third commit, you will haev commits which undo what the previous commits do. It is actually possibly, using git, to merge them all into one (called "squash" in git slang).

Two ways:

1) Look at "git rebase -i"

2) If you run "git reset HEAD~1", the last commit is "destroyed" and the changes it contains become "unstaged" chages. This, together with "git commit --amend" is another way to merge the commits.

Ahahah. Well, in that case with the cost of adding all constraints to the LP this objective function may only be 1% of the total. And I am not talking of solving the actual thing ! `:-P`

It seems to be the same as before. And there is this comment about Petersen's graph which is not followed by an example.

Hello !

Well, it seems good to me. Except that this `scream if not simple` is only justified when `total=True`. And in this case, it is only a problem when you have loops (multiple edges are okay). Could you change it into `_scream_if_not_simple(allow_multiple_edges=True, allow_loops=not total)` ?
