Let's say I want to create my own number objects and I want be able to compare my objects with regular number types.

```python
class SpecialNumber():
    def __init__(self, number):
        self.number = number
    def __lt__(self, other):
        return self.number < other
    def __gt__(self, other):
        return self.number > other
```
When comparing an int and a SpecialNumber, and SpecialNumber is on the left, everything works well, because SpecialNumber's comparison operators are called. However, when the SpecialNumber is on the right, it fail, i.e.:

```python
sage: a = SpecialNumber(3)
sage: a > 2
True
sage: 2 < a
False
```

The exact same code in pure python would return True, because there is no `__lt__` method to call on an int that works, so instead `a > 2` is tried which returns True.

Whereas Sage, after not being able to call the `__lt__` method of the Integer object, tries coercion right away without trying to evaluate `a > 2`. Since there is no coercion, it checks if the types of the two objects are the same or something like that, and since not, it returns false. I think the right behavior would be check first if `a > 2` can be evaluated, and try to coerce only after that.

How about `a<2`, `2<a` then? Do you want the same there? That would give an infinite recursion.

In python, the meaning of comparison is in the hands of the left hand side. In general, you shouldn't expect any consistency when applying comparisons between unrelated objects. If you want to cooperate with sage objects, you'll probably have to support coercion.

This is not entirely true. From http://stackoverflow.com/questions/878943/why-return-notimplemented-instead-of-raising-notimplementederror (the same thing works for other comparison operators):

 "`NotImplemented` signals to the runtime that it should ask someone else to satisfy the operation.

If it doesn't, then the runtime will fall back to the built-in behavior (which is based on identity for == and !=)."

For instance, if Sage could override this built-in behavior and try coercion instead, that would save us from infinite recursion.

Which you can confirm by inserting a print message in the relevant `__gt__`. It indeed seems that if, in evaluation of `a<b`, it happens that `a.__lt__(b)` returns `NotImplemented`, then the next thing tried is `b.__gt__(a)`. On second reading (or perhaps just correct reading) this *is* as documented:

"""
There are no swapped-argument versions of these methods (to be used when the left argument does not support the operation but the right argument does); rather, __lt__() and __gt__() are each other’s reflection, __le__() and __ge__() are each other’s reflection, and __eq__() and __ne__() are their own reflection.
"""

So indeed, if sage were a little more liberal in returning `NotImplemented` your approach could work.

The problem is that parts of sage are quite intent on having all objects comparable, meaning that the sage implementations try quite hard to return `True` or `False` rather than `NotImplemented`. So changing this will be pretty hard.
