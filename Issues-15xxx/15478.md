Ticket #13214 introduced the `.is_identity()` method. The implementation only treats parents with finite number of `gens`, but it assumes that the base has no non-trivial automorphisms.

This gives unexpected results:

```
sage: K.<z> = GF(4)
sage: phi = End(K)([z^2])
sage: R.<t> = K[]
sage: psi = End(R)(phi)
sage: psi
Ring endomorphism of Univariate Polynomial Ring in t over Finite Field in z of size 2^2
  Defn: Induced from base ring by
        Ring endomorphism of Finite Field in z of size 2^2
          Defn: z |--> z + 1
sage: psi.is_identity()
True
```

To prevent any misunderstanding: I agree that your change is safe, but I have the feeling that it only hides the problem instead of fixing it at the source.

Here is one, directly adapted from the docstring of `SetMorphism`.

```
sage: from sage.categories.morphism import SetMorphism
sage: f = SetMorphism(Hom(QQ, QQ, Sets()), numerator)
sage: f.is_identity()
True
```

I agree that there are issues with morphisms (not) believing they are the identity because of the generic implementation in `Morphism` assuming objects in Sage are defined by their generating sets.

However I feel like that is out of the scope of this ticket. To me, this change is not really hiding the problem as this is essentially a wrapper class, but instead fixes one part of the problem, in that it wasn't passing data along as it should.

> sage: f.is_identity()

For that example, there isn't an induced base ring morphism, so IMO it's a separate issue from this ticket.

```
sage: f.__class__.__mro__
(<type 'sage.categories.morphism.SetMorphism'>,
 <type 'sage.categories.morphism.Morphism'>,
 <type 'sage.categories.map.Map'>,
 <type 'sage.structure.element.Element'>,
 <type 'sage.structure.sage_object.SageObject'>,
 <type 'object'>)
```
However, that is not to say it isn't a bug deserving its own ticket. As I mentioned above, the problem (for this example) is that we are not considering *Q* as field, but as a set. So I think the generic code should be moved to some `Morphism_im_gens` base class (or perhaps `RingHomomorphism_im_gens`?) and for a general `Morphism` raise a `NotImplementedError`, but on a separate ticket.
