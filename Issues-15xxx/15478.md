Ticket #13214 introduced the `.is_identity()` method. The implementation only treats parents with finite number of `gens`, but it assumes that the base has no non-trivial automorphisms.

This gives unexpected results:

```
sage: K.<z> = GF(4)
sage: phi = End(K)([z^2])
sage: R.<t> = K[]
sage: psi = End(R)(phi)
sage: psi
Ring endomorphism of Univariate Polynomial Ring in t over Finite Field in z of size 2^2
  Defn: Induced from base ring by
        Ring endomorphism of Finite Field in z of size 2^2
          Defn: z |--> z + 1
sage: psi.is_identity()
True
```

Here is one, directly adapted from the docstring of `SetMorphism`.

```
sage: from sage.categories.morphism import SetMorphism
sage: f = SetMorphism(Hom(QQ, QQ, Sets()), numerator)
sage: f.is_identity()
True

I agree that there are issues with morphisms (not) believing they are the identity because of the generic implementation in `Morphism` assuming objects in Sage are defined by their generating sets.

However I feel like that is out of the scope of this ticket. To me, this change is not really hiding the problem as this is essentially a wrapper class, but instead fixes one part of the problem, in that it wasn't passing data along as it should.

For that example, there isn't an induced base ring morphism, so IMO it's a separate issue from this ticket.

```
sage: f.__class__.__mro__
(<type 'sage.categories.morphism.SetMorphism'>,
 <type 'sage.categories.morphism.Morphism'>,
 <type 'sage.categories.map.Map'>,
 <type 'sage.structure.element.Element'>,
 <type 'sage.structure.sage_object.SageObject'>,
 <type 'object'>)
```
However, that is not to say it isn't a bug deserving its own ticket. As I mentioned above, the problem (for this example) is that we are not considering *Q* as field, but as a set. So I think the generic code should be moved to some `Morphism_im_gens` base class (or perhaps `RingHomomorphism_im_gens`?) and for a general `Morphism` raise a `NotImplementedError`, but on a separate ticket.
