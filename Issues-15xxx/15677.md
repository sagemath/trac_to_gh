CC:  @kcrisman @dimpase @tscrim

Keywords: cygwin libtool

This includes:
* libpng (running autorconf -fiv updates it correctly),
* freetype (running ./autogen.sh updates it correctly),
* gd (running autorconf -fiv updates it correctly).

Some of these packages may also be outdated so an upgrade might solves the issue.
