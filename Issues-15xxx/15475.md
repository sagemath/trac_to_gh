This branch activates two combinat doctests which were disabled due to unexplainable bugs that were fixed in #10963:

```
            The following doctest is disabled pending :trac:`10963`::

                sage: s = SymmetricFunctions(Zmod(14)).s() # not tested
                sage: s.is_integral_domain() # not tested
                False
```
and

```
                    sage: def descent_test(n):
                    ....:     DA = DescentAlgebra(QQ, n)

                    sage: all( descent_test(i) for i in range(6) ) # not tested

                .. TODO::

                    Once :trac:`10963` is in, remove the first "not tested" above,
                    and replace the second one by "long time".

Also, a few typos in the c3_controlled doc are fixed.

OK, here is a minimal(?) way to cause the bug. Copy this code:

```
def descent_test(n):
    DA = DescentAlgebra(QQ, n)
    DAD = DA.D()
    DAB = DA.B()
    DAD([])
    for I in Compositions(n):
        DAD(DAB[I])

def maintest():
    descent_test(3)
    descent_test(4) # you need both 3 and 4, IN THIS ORDER, to break it!
    SGA4 = SymmetricGroupAlgebra(QQ, 4)
    DAB = DescentAlgebra(QQ, 4).B()
    x = DAB[4]
    SGA4(x)
```

into a .py file and attach it. Run maintest(). You will get an error:

```
TypeError: do not know how to make x (= B[4]) an element of self (=Symmetric group algebra of order 4 over Rational Field)
```
Afterwards, try doing

```
sage: SGA4 = SymmetricGroupAlgebra(QQ, 4)
sage: D4 = DescentAlgebra(QQ, 4).D()
sage: SGA4.has_coerce_map_from(D4)
```
You get `False`, although in a virgin session it would be `True`. So it looks like either we have problems with UniqueRepresentation and coercion, or the coercion graph has become too confusing for Sage to find a way (#15303?).

How do I debug a failed coercion? Is there a method that shows me a local coercion graph?

Also, I am no longer sure if the sfa.py issue has really been fixed or if #10963 has just kicked the can further down the road. Is there a sanity check for coercion graphs?

Hmm; what is `_coercions_used` and what is it good for? Why can't we just remove it?

EDIT: On the other hand, commenting out `self._coercions_used = True` in parent.pyx does not fix the error. But why do we have this kind of flag anyway? How on earth do we want to know if all coercions from/to a given objects are already known? Why on earth do we want this information?

I've figured it out. The issue is that because we are not holding a strong reference to `SGA4`, it is being garbage collected, but `DAB` has not been. As such, the new coercion map does not get recreated, so the new `SGA4` doesn't know about the (dynamically created) coercion:

```
sage: SGA4 = SymmetricGroupAlgebra(QQ, 4); DAB = DescentAlgebra(QQ, 4).B()
sage: del SGA4
sage: import gc
sage: gc.collect()
599 # Some number, not important
sage: SGA4 = SymmetricGroupAlgebra(QQ, 4) # Now recreate it
sage: x = DAB[4]; SGA4(x)
```
If you remove the `del SGA4`, it always works. I think the doctest runner is much more liberal about garbage collection which is why the test we had *almost* always failed.

Therefore I've fixed this by making the descent algebra hold a *strong* reference to the SGA (which it probably should irregardless).

This is now #16532.

I've changed it to use `_coerce_map_from_` as this was the most robust with #15303 not being done (although I had to explicitly do the function composition). Thanks for clarifying.

OUCH. I just realized that I forgot to reenable the symmetric functions doctest, and not unexpectedly it is still broken. OK, this thing must be unrelated to #10963 after all. Simon, can you make sense of this?

I'm pretty sure it's related to the category refinement that occurs for `Zmod(13)`:

```
sage: SymmetricFunctions(Zmod(14))
Symmetric Functions over Ring of integers modulo 14
sage: SymmetricFunctions(Zmod(12)) # This isn't needed to reproduce the error
Symmetric Functions over Ring of integers modulo 12
sage: SymmetricFunctions(Zmod(13))
   # Boom
sage: Rp = Zmod(13)
sage: Rp.category()
Join of Category of finite commutative rings and Category of subquotients of monoids and Category of quotients of semigroups
sage: Rp in Fields()
True
sage: Rp.category()
Join of Category of finite fields and Category of subquotients of monoids and Category of quotients of semigroups
sage: SymmetricFunctions(Rp)
Symmetric Functions over Ring of integers modulo 13
```
(You can remove the `Rp.category()` and it will still work.) Compare this with

```
sage: SymmetricFunctions(Zmod(12))
Symmetric Functions over Ring of integers modulo 12
sage: SymmetricFunctions(GF(13))
Symmetric Functions over Finite Field of size 13
```

However, in a fresh Sage:

```
sage: Rp = Zmod(13)
sage: SymmetricFunctions(Rp)
Symmetric Functions over Ring of integers modulo 13
sage: Rp.category()
Join of Category of finite fields and Category of subquotients of monoids and Category of quotients of semigroups
```

This might be useful info (also in a fresh Sage):

```
sage: GradedHopfAlgebras(Zmod(14))

sage: Rp = Zmod(13)

That's good news! #15229 might actually be a fix for the root cause, not a workaround:

```
sage: SymmetricFunctions(Zmod(14))
Symmetric Functions over Ring of integers modulo 14
sage: Zmod(13) in Fields() # if not for this "check", then the following would break
True
sage: SymmetricFunctions(Zmod(13))
Symmetric Functions over Ring of integers modulo 13
```

and, for #11979:

```
sage: from sage.algebras.divided_power_algebra import UnivariateDividedPowerAlgebra
sage: A = UnivariateDividedPowerAlgebra(Zmod(9)); A
The divided power algebra over Ring of integers modulo 9
sage: Zmod(5) in Fields() # if not for this "check", then the following would break
True
sage: A = UnivariateDividedPowerAlgebra(Zmod(5)); A
The divided power algebra over Ring of integers modulo 5
```

So my guess would be that category refinement doesn't like it when a category changes in the midst of it, and the category of Zmod(n) does change when Zmod(n) is tested for fieldness:

```
sage: Zmod(17).category()
Join of Category of finite commutative rings and Category of subquotients of monoids and Category of quotients of semigroups
sage: Zmod(17) in Fields()
True
sage: Zmod(17).category()
Join of Category of finite fields and Category of subquotients of monoids and Category of quotients of semigroups
```

With #15229 fixing this, I think we can hope to see the end of this issue.

Is this pattern, where an object lazily starts off with a broad category and then refines in when the user checks for properties, common in Sage? Should we get rid of that or tweak the code to allow it? If we are to allow it, we would probably need to establish a hierarchy of categories or classes such that refining a category of some object can only trigger refinements of categories of lower-class objects in its process, and said refinements should be made sure not to interfere or run races with each other?

EDIT: I also wanted to add that this whole tradeoff between "allow several instances of ZZ/nZZ with different properties, and try to somehow ensure that they behave like they are equal, e.g., providing automatic coercion between their polynomial rings" and "force all instances of ZZ/nZZ to be identical, at the cost of having to update and mutate this single instance long after it is created, and try to somehow ensure that these mutations do not break consistency" reminds me a lot of the constructivity problem of Voevodsky's univalent foundations. Looks like equality is the trickiest thing to formalize...

```
sage: len(Zmod(5).categories())

Either this lazy discovery of categories has to be removed, or the category refinement and MRO routines must be hardened against it.
