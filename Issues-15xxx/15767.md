<a id='comment:60'></a>Hi Jeroen,

What's the status of this?
Are there still hundreds of failing stuff?
With the forced pushes its not that easy to see how the situtation evolves.
And I've not tested it yet.

Whatsoever, thanks for the hard work.

It's almost ready. The announcement of the PARI-2.7 release candidate gave me a good reason to finish this ticket. Sage doctests found many (10 or so) bugs in PARI, all of which have been fixed upstream.

The forced pushes are the most convenient way to develop this, otherwise I would have 100 commits and several merges in between. I will now look into the remaining doctest failures.

No, this ticket does not change `spkg-install`. So you should make the changes you propose either on #16017 or on a new ticket.

The parameter `lim1` for Simon's 2-descent program needs to be adjusted (default is 2, minimal value for which a point is found is now apparently 5):

Actually the same can be done much more efficiently using `lim3` instead (with `lim1` it needlessly increases the search bound for quartics that are not everywhere locally soluble):
