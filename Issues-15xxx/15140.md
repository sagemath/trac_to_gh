Everything is in the title.

This will solve http://ask.sagemath.org/question/2954/problem-with-abeliangroupcayley_graph

I made this ticket depend on #10963 (which will be merged a priori soon) to have the nice axioms syntax, but it's not a strong dependency.

I've added a general `semigroup_generators` for all monoids, which returns the monoid generators and the unit (and assuming finitely generated). I've also defined a `monoid_generators` for finite groups in `FiniteGroups` instead of an `if` statement as a followup to #16725.

Yoooooooooo !!

No problem for those tickets, I more or less understand what is going on ! `:-)`

It looks good but I have two questions:

1) Is there any reason why AbelianGroup does not appear in `groups.<tab>` ?

2) When is the code from `Groups.ParentMethods.monoid_generators` being used ? You removed a couple of lines as this case is handled by the new `FiniteGroups.ParentMethods.monoid_generators`, but then the code of the first method claims that it raises an exception when self is not a `FiniteEnumeratedSet`. Couldn't this method be removed too ? I actually do not understand in which situation that fonction worked without using the "if/return" that you removed.

Probably because someone missed it when doing the initial groups catalog. Add it to `groups.misc.<tab>` here?

> 2) When is the code from `Groups.ParentMethods.monoid_generators` being used ?

Well, here or in another ticket. It just takes one lie anyway.

Yes, but when will the code of `Groups.ParentMethods.monoid_generators` be used, if not for finite group ? With you patch all `FiniteGroups` have their own implementation now, but which kind of group is not a `FiniteGroup` but is a `FiniteEnumeratedSet` ?

Done here.

Sorry `T_T`

Hello again !

Sorry for the delay, it took longer than expected: I checked the doctests in groups/ and I saw that one was broken, so I had to start a "ptestlong" to find out if there were others. I added a commit at public/15140 that fixes them.

Positive review to your code, and as I added a commit it is your turn to review it and change the ticket's status.

Thanks !

Nathann
