In #13615 there were major enhancements to the ability to compute isogenies of low degree for elliptic curves.  A small bug was found after the ticket was closed and the patched merged into 5.13.beta0:

```
sage: K.<i> = NumberField(x^2+1)                                                                         
sage: E = EllipticCurve(K,[-2*i-1,0])                                                                   
sage: E.isogenies_prime_degree(17)
...

ValueError: The polynomial does not define a finite subgroup of the elliptic curve.
```
while in fact this curve does have 2 17-isogenies:

```
sage: from sage.schemes.elliptic_curves.isogeny_small_degree import isogenies_prime_degree_general
sage: isogenies_prime_degree_general(E,17) # rather slow
[Isogeny of degree 17 from Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 = x^3 + (-2*i-1)*x over Number Field in i with defining polynomial x^2 + 1 to Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 = x^3 + (-82*i-641)*x over Number Field in i with defining polynomial x^2 + 1,
 Isogeny of degree 17 from Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 = x^3 + (-2*i-1)*x over Number Field in i with defining polynomial x^2 + 1 to Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 = x^3 + (-562*i+319)*x over Number Field in i with defining polynomial x^2 + 1]
```

This was found by Warwick undergraduate Warren Moore.

This problem can be fixed as follows:  in line 1770 of isogeny_small_degree.py replace -27*c4 by -27*c4/1296 (or -c4/48) twice.
