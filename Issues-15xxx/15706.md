The `Graph/DiGraph` constructor are scary to look at, and waste a lot of computations in order to guess whether the user wants loops or multiple edges. In order to reduce this number of tests and make those functions more efficient, we can change the default and force the user to specify explicitly what they want to obtain.

Note that this is not a bad idea on its own, for graphs which allow multiple edges/loops behave differently with respect to the `add_edge` function, and by specifying this explicitly the user is forced to be aware of what is going to happen next.

After many small patches like that, it may become possible to simplify a lot of things in those huge constructors. But first, deprecation for one year `T_T`

Well... Again, all graph books usually begin by saying that all graphs considered are simple, i.e. no loops nor multiple edges. There is such a thing as "multigraph", too. And I really don't like this behaviour:

```
sage: G=Graph([(1,2),(1,2),(1,1)]); G.edges()
[(1, 1, None), (1, 2, None), (1, 2, None)]
sage: G=Graph(); G.add_edge(1,2); G.add_edge(1,2); G.add_edge(1,1); G.edges()
[(1, 2, None)]
```

Somehow the current behaviour of `add_edge` depends on non-explicit information, and considers simple graphs as the default. I would feel better if everybody got used to state clearly what they want to work with and dealt with the consequences. A guy who wants to build multigraphs and initializes them from a list of edges will experience seriously inconsistent behaviour depending on whether the initial information contains multiple edges and/or loops !

Well, I don't consider no one cares when it's only on a ticket.  Only the seriously obsessed (like me?) just look at random tickets without invitation ;-)  And stuff that is actually important often languishes for years.

I think the problem is that while some people like me are lazy and will put in double edges but don't mean it, the most likely thing when people put in extra edges is that they want them.

True, but I really worry of those who create many graphs, most of which have multiple edges, and all of a sudden create one from data which (by chance) corresponds to a simple graph. There is a danger of wrong results later on.

> I don't feel competent to resolve this question - and definitely not *all* graph things assume all are simple.


?

Well no, we have stuff that works for both, and stuff that works for simple graphs.. "recently" I added a function called "scream if not simple" that is used in several places in the graph code, as really some functions that should not be called on non-simple graphs were not checked at all. It is a bit better, but this constructor thing remains a problem, especially when the behaviour of the constructor and the behaviour of `add_edge` is not the same.

Nonononono, it is possible ! You can do `G.allow_multiple_edges(True)`, but then you have to *know* that you need to do that.

> Is there at least an error thrown?


I don't understand what you are talking about, so I will answer the two possibilities:

1) For .density() yes an error is thrown:

```
sage: Graph([(1,2),(1,2)]).density()
...
TypeError: Density is not well-defined for multigraphs.
```

2) For functions that use `scream_if_not_simple` too:

```
sage: Graph([(1,2),(1,2)]).is_split()
...
ValueError: This method is not known to work on graphs with multiedges. Perhaps this method can be updated to handle them, but in the meantime if you want to use it please disallow multiedges using allow_multiple_edges().
```

3) No error is thrown when you want to add an edge to a (simple) graph that already has it:

```
sage: g = Graph([(0,1)])
sage: g.edges()
[(0, 1, None)]
sage: g.add_edge(0,1)
sage: g.edges()
[(0, 1, None)]
```

I believe that this is what should happen, but of course it can be a problem if you have created a simple graph by mistake, which can happen with this automatic detection.

> > Is there at least an error thrown?

> I don't understand what you are talking about,
I said that when I thought it was impossible to convert to multigraphs.

That said, this current behavior you mention is troubling.

```
sage: g = Graph([(0,1)])
sage: g.edges()
[(0, 1, None)]
sage: g.add_edge(0,1)
sage: g.edges()
[(0, 1, None)]
```
Ideally, this should raise a warning (once per session, like a deprecation) that you should change to a multigraph, and after the deprecation period it would still raise the warning but now *force* it to be a multigraph.

As I mentioned before, I'm not a heavy graph theory user (though I do use it) so I think would be better to at least see whether any opinions existed on sage-devel - cc:ing one person who may have an opinion (?).

Not necessarily. I work on simple graphs only, and I use this from time to time. When I add an edge which is already there <do nothing> is what I expect.

Currently, users may not even know if their graph is simple or may contain multiedges, that's what I think is the problem.

I changed dicts to lists ? Can you tell me where ?

The dictionary notation is only cryptic when you want "edge-labelled multigraphs". When you want simple graphs, it is rather simple: associate to each vertex the list of its neighbors.

To answer your question a bit more completely: I hope that Sage (the code, not the doctests) contains no occurrence of `Graph(list_of_edges)`, for this is slower than `g=Graph();g.add_edges(list_of_edges)`. This is also the point of this ticket: making both equally fast.

No, you changed lists to dicts, e.g. 

```diff
-        sage: G=DiGraph([[0,0],[0,0],[0,0],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]])
-        sage: H=DiGraph([[0,0],[0,0],[0,0],[0,0],[1,1],[1,1]])

+        sage: H=DiGraph({0:[0,0,0,0],1:[1,1]})
```
and some similar, which is okay, but also

```diff
-            sage: DiGraph([(1, 2, 0), (1,2,1)])
+            sage: DiGraph({1:{2:[0,1]}})
```

Oh sorrysorry, I thought that you were speaking of Sage's code.

Ahaha. Well, indeed, "multigraph with labelled edges". It is the most awful thing we handle I believe `:-P`

This being said, it is "the right data structure" in terms of elementary operations. Though hard to read. By the way, it can give you an idea of why I hate multiple edges and loops. It makes everything more complicated, and none of the additional complexities is very interesting from the theoretical point of view. It is just more work and more corner-cases `:-P`
