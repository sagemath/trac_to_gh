Of course this question is not just about crystals, but could apply to groups, posets, ...

Anyway, just food for thought for after this ticket.

How about we link them all to the category? For example, currently I do

```
sage: crystals.Tableaux(['A',2], shape=[2,1])
```
Instead we make this use the category:

```
sage: Crystals.Tableaux(['A',2], shape=[2,1])
```
We should be able to do

```
from sage.combinat.crystals.catalog import *
```
in the crystals category to do this. Although doing things this way, we could easily have things lost among the category methods. So I'm not convinced this is the best direction to go.

Also I'm somewhat of the opinion that categories should be grouped together as well via `categories.Crystals` and such and not be in the global namespace. Therefore leaving `crystals.*` as the only entry point. IDK, I'm okay with 2 entry points too...

Agreed! This is why, in my attempted notation, I had put this in an
attribute `Crystals.catalog`. But it's not super convincing
either.

I agree that there definitely should be far less categories in the
global name space, and #10963 will help much in this
direction. However, for the well known ones like Sets, Fields, Groups,
Posets, Crystals, ... I find that the category is a natural entry
point to explore the functionalities implemented in Sage about a given
topic, because it has more semantic attached to it than with a mere
module like `groups`.

On a related matter, it would be a cool feature, when given a
category, to recover all parents in this category. E.g.:

```
    sage: affine_crystals = Crystals().Affine().implementations()
    sage: affine_crystals.K<tab>
    KirillovReshetikhinCrystal
    ...
```

Florent had implemented a proof-of-concept, recovering automatically
the information from a database build from the Sage TestSuite's. But
this would take some more work.

> IDK, I'm okay with 2 entry points too...


That will certainly do for now :-)

Using #14275 makes deprecating things from the global namespace so much easier.

Hey man.

I felt a bit trap when I noticed, after having spent quite some time reading the diff, that the ticket did not only change what it claims....

Anyway.

I agree with everything I can understand (and "git diff --word-diff" really is useful for tickets like that), but there are five things that I cannot review:

- The "model" changes to `/src/sage/combinat/crystals/highest_weight_crystals.py`

- This change

```
-        if self.cartan_type().is_affine():
+        if not self.cartan_type().is_finite():
```

- This one

```
-        return other.__lt__(self)
+        return self._list.__gt__(other._list)
```

- The definition of `KirillovReshetikhin` in catalog.py (and I don't think that it is the right place to define it)

- Same for `RiggedConfigurations` in `catalog_kirillov_reshetikhin.py` though the code is trivial>

I do not understand what it does, and though I thought I could review a ticket that implements a crystal catalogs, I can't review these parts.

Soooo well. You can either remove them and I can set this ticket to positive review, or someone else will do it.

There are broken doc links reported by `sage -docbuild reference/combinat --warn-links html`. And I also add a commit to your branch to fix a typo and a "double deprecation".

Hey Nathann,

Replying to [ncohen](#comment%3A12):
> I felt a bit trap when I noticed, after having spent quite some time reading the diff, that the ticket did not only change what it claims....


Well, there were things that I wanted to touch up while I was making sweeping changes.

> I agree with everything I can understand (and "git diff --word-diff" really is useful for tickets like that), but there are five things that I cannot review:
> 
> - The "model" changes to `/src/sage/combinat/crystals/highest_weight_crystals.py`

For reference: this is for better (future?) support for LS paths over other indefinite types (ex. hyperbolic).

> - This one
> 
> ```diff
> -        return other.__lt__(self)
> +        return self._list.__gt__(other._list)

After some though, I felt it was better to revert this.

> - The definition of `KirillovReshetikhin` in catalog.py (and I don't think that it is the right place to define it)


This is the right place because it's just a function which redirects to the correct class (in different files). IMO it's stupid (and potentially confusing) to put it in `kirillov_reshetikhin.py` just to import it into the catalog.

> - Same for `RiggedConfigurations` in `catalog_kirillov_reshetikhin.py` though the code is trivial>


Here this should be here even more so because I want to reinforce that we only want to construct the rigged configurations of a single KR crystal (not as a tensor product thereof).

> I do not understand what it does, and though I thought I could review a ticket that implements a crystal catalogs, I can't review these parts.


Thank you for your review thus far.

> There are broken doc links reported by `sage -docbuild reference/combinat --warn-links html`. And I also add a commit to your branch to fix a typo and a "double deprecation".


I've done what I can about them.

Best,

Travis

Helloooooo Anne !

Well, actually "git diff --word-diff --color" helped me a lot there: it understands that the difference is mostly line breaks, and so if a LAAAARGE paragraph was split into many lines and a small modification is made somewhere at the same time (here, a modification to a latex formula) then the diff only displays the change to the latex formula, and you basically don't see the line breaks. That's cool.

With GIT, it would have been better for the review to store all those modifications in a specific commit, but this branch already has a lot of commits and it makes it hard to review commit by commit.

But I reviewed all this already. If you can check what I was not qualified to check above, as well as check that the classification of the constructors in the crystals.<tab> object makes sense, then this ticket can go.

Do you know the option "git add -p" ? This thing is fantastic ! In cases like that, you can make all the changes you need to a file, and then split it into different thematic commits.

Then they can become different tickets or just stay different commits... But it lets you pick which changes (from the same file) you want to include in the next commit, and that's cool. You can do all those changes and decide later how you sort them.

Won't you ever need some Sage code to call this function ? In this case it would mean a "from sage.....crystals.catalog import KirillovReshetikhin", which is a bit weird. It happens very often in the graph constructor that we need to call other constructors. But well, if there is no "smart" code in there after all, do as you wish.

I first thought that "being a crystal" would reflect on the code, and that it would inherit from some crystal class or parent or whatever. But I really do not understand anything about crystals :-P

Anne,

Those line break changes made it easier for me to read (especially in my approximately 90 character wide window). Also the 80 character max width is a pseudo-standard.

What are the KR models?

Well, I think, it is a really bad idea to incorporate line break in this patch!

I'm using `crystals.KirillovReshetikhin` as an entry point for the user on the front-end. All of the models from `crystals.kirillov_reshetikhin.<tab>` take a Cartan type, an `r`, and an `s` as input.

The KR models are:

- Kashiwara Nakashima tableaux - the class `KirillovReshetikhinCrystal` and is the default model for `crystal.KirillovReshetikhin`
- Kirillov Reshetikhin tableaux - the class `KirillovReshetikhinTableaux`
- Rigged configurartions - using `RiggedConfigurations` of a single factor
- LS paths - using `KirillovReshetikhinCrystalFromLSPaths`

I've fixed the doctest failures in the latest push.

Best,

Travis

It is seems a little weird that KirillovReshetikhin does not appear in the list, but that\n` sage.combinat.crystals.catalog.KirillovReshetikhin(cartan_type, r, s, model='KN')` appears as documentation on the catalogue site (under subcatalogs). It would be better if it appeared when clicking on KR crystals.\n\nSo much for now since all this first needs to be fixed.\n\nAnne",

Hi Travis,

Here are some further comments:

* The following

```
+The Littelmann path model also lends itself as a model for to level zero
+crystals which are bi-infinite. To cut out a slice of these crystals, one
+can use the direction option in subcrystal::
```
is not a sentence. Perhaps drop the "to"?

* When I type

```

* What is the difference between `crystals.KirillovReshetikhin` and `crystals.kirillov_reshetikhin`? Since tab completion does not work, it is hard to see from the command line. I suppose `crystals.kirillov_reshetikhin` is another subcatalog? It is seems a little weird that KirillovReshetikhin does not appear in the list, but that
` sage.combinat.crystals.catalog.KirillovReshetikhin(cartan_type, r, s, model='KN')` appears as documentation on the catalogue site (under subcatalogs). It would be better if it appeared when clicking on KR crystals.

So much for now since all this first needs to be fixed.

Hi Travis,

Here are a couple more comments on this ticket:

* There seem to be some crystals missing in the list `src/doc/output/html/en/reference/combinat/sage/combinat/crystals/catalog.html`. For example Littelmann paths and the affine factorization crystal are not there. Also, would it be possible to order the entries alphabetically?

* The list in `src/doc/output/html/en/reference/combinat/crystals.html` is almost the same, but more crystals are actually displayed. It would be best if the two lists could easily be kept in sync.

Best,

Anne

Hey Anne,

Replying to [aschilling](#comment%3A40):
> * There seem to be some crystals missing in the list `src/doc/output/html/en/reference/combinat/sage/combinat/crystals/catalog.html`. For example Littelmann paths and the affine factorization crystal are not there. Also, would it be possible to order the entries alphabetically?


Done and done (before I had it organized more by type).

> * The list in `src/doc/output/html/en/reference/combinat/crystals.html` is almost the same, but more crystals are actually displayed. It would be best if the two lists could easily be kept in sync.


They are always going to be somewhat out of sync because in the catalog is a list of what classes (and factory functions) of crystals that are currently in Sage, whereas the `crystals.html` is a list of modules (files) which contain the crystal implementations. (Also I don't think we have any mechanisms for automatically having things lists synced in the doc.)

Best,

Travis

Anyway, just as a food for thought, I wanted to mention that I was surprised at first to have\n\n```\n    crystals.Letters\n```\nrather than\n\n```\n    crystals.CrystalOfLetters\n```\n\nThe latter is nicer if you want to do `from crystals import *`. But maybe the point is that you don't want to do that and just always `crystals....`, and then it's less redundant.\n\nLet's see how this is done in the other catalogs.

Hi!

Sorry, I haven't been been following up on this ticket, so that's probably too late. Anyway, just as a food for thought, I wanted to mention that I was surprised at first to have

```
    crystals.Letters
```
rather than

```
    crystals.CrystalOfLetters
```

The latter is nicer if you want to do `from crystals import *`. But maybe the point is that you don't want to do that and just always `crystals....`, and then it's less redundant.

Let's see how this is done in the other catalogs. Hmm, we have `graphs.ChvatalGraph`, but `groups.permutation.Dihedral`. Not super consistent ...

Cheers,
                                       Nicolas

Hi Nicolas,

We thought that 

```
crystals.CrystalOfLetters
```
was redundant. Since it is pretty short, I think I/we will just use
`crystals. ...` in the future.

As always, it is better to make sense than to be consistent. The Graph thing is an error. We should .... deprecated those 100+ functions and remove the final "Graph" ?... Scary `T_T`
