The method partial_fraction_decomposition() does not work correctly. 

Compare this 

```
sage: p = 2*x; q = x^2 + 6*x +9; r = p/q 
sage: r.partial_fraction() 
Out[2]: 2/(x + 3) - 6/(x + 3)^2 
```

with

```
sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: p = 2*x; q = x^2 + 6*x +9; r = p/q
sage: r.partial_fraction_decomposition()
Out[5]: (0, [2*x/(x^2 + 6*x + 9)])
```

But while trying to fix the issue I realized that I am a bit confused:
* Is partial fraction decomposition really defined over the field of fractions of any integral domain R? (I agree that it is when R is a PID, but what about other cases?)
* In any case, isn't its *computation* going to require a Euclidean domain?
* But in the Euclidean case, the stronger partial fraction decomposition pong asks for is always defined, isn't it?
* What is the correct way to define methods that apply to all elements of the field of fractions of a *Euclidean* domain? Conversely, should there be a category of quotient fields over an integral (as opposed to Euclidean) domain in Sage at all?...
