I have just been hit by a similar problem:

```
sage: R = LaurentPolynomialRing(ZZ, 'x')
sage: T = PolynomialRing(ZZ, 'x')
sage: R.gen() + T.gen()
2*x
sage: R.gen() + FractionField(T).gen()
BOOM !
```

Two comments, not a review (I fear I have no idea what spooky action at a distance these changes might cause):

- In `hall_algebra.py`, please change not just the doctests but the whole WARNING they're in. They should be a regular example, not a WARNING.

- Could you maybe document `converter`? I know it's an internal function, but I want to understand what it does and why.

`@`David:
I was thinking to something like

```
sage: FractionField(LaurentPolynomialRing(QQ,'x'))
Fraction Field of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x over Rational Field
```
but, yes, this can be considered as superfluous.

`@`Darij, yes, I agree that one should change the doc in hall_algebra in a better way. I was hoping that somebody more knowledgeable than me about this part of sage would do that.
