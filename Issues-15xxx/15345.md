<a id='comment:24'></a>`@`David:
I was thinking to something like

```
sage: FractionField(LaurentPolynomialRing(QQ,'x'))
Fraction Field of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x over Rational Field
```
but, yes, this can be considered as superfluous.

`@`Darij, yes, I agree that one should change the doc in hall_algebra in a better way. I was hoping that somebody more knowledgeable than me about this part of sage would do that.
