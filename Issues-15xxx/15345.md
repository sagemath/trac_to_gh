Two comments, not a review (I fear I have no idea what spooky action at a distance these changes might cause):

- In `hall_algebra.py`, please change not just the doctests but the whole WARNING they're in. They should be a regular example, not a WARNING.

- Could you maybe document `converter`? I know it's an internal function, but I want to understand what it does and why.

Okay, I've fixed up the Hall algebra documentation. I've changed `to_fraction()` into `_fraction_pair()` since this is only suppose to be used for the coercion (so it's hidden) and IMO it more accurately reflects what is being returned. If you're happy with my changes, then up to someone not likely what we're doing on sage-devel, it's a positive review from me.
