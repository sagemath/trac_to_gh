Relevant piece of the code:

```
        if as_dual_of is None:
            self.dual_side = False
            self.dual = RootSystem(self._cartan_type.dual(), as_dual_of=self);
            # still fails for CartanType G2xA1
            try:
                self.dual = RootSystem(self._cartan_type.dual(), as_dual_of=self);
            except StandardError:
                pass
```
The definition of `self.dual` is done twice, one time in a try clause, one time outside. I don't know if the breaking of non-crystallographic root systems is intentional or not (might be it is because there doesn't seem to be much functionality implemented for that), but it certainly slows down things.

It would be interesting to know why/how it went wrong. The patch is from #5794, 4 years ago.

Interestingly, the patch [attachment: trac_5794-exceptional.patch:ticket:5794](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket15279/2ba91a145b2fe5fbd55102716450f435.gz) on Trac is correct, it does remove the duplicate line. However, the patch which is merged (revision `-r13366` in Mercurial) has a different commit message (`trac_5794-exceptional.patch modified for combinat server`) and does *not* remove that line. I can only hope that the "combinat server" doesn't make these mistakes any more.

Why would one need to rebase less with the new workflow? A merge conflict is a merge conflict, and the new workflow is not going to change that.

Granted, there will be as many merges as before; but unlike what we had with our patch queues those will be 3-way merges, so there will be better support from the revision control system, with less error-prone manual operations.

Cheers,

I am CCing Daniel Bump and Mike Hansen; maybe they can shed more light on the question what exactly ended up merged from #5794.

So these seem to be the #5794-related commits in the log (thank you, Jeroen, for the help with getting it):

```

I can tell that

changeset 13469 == trac_5794-long-time-nt.patch (modulo fuzz)

and

changeset 13368 == trac_5794-reviewer-nt.patch.

Furthermore,

changeset 13367 differs from trac_5794-more-exceptional.patch only in having `is_irreducible` and `is_reducible` in lieu of `is_atomic` and `is_compound`.

The difference between changeset 13366 and trac_5794-exceptional.patch is more substantial, and is what caused the bug in the present ticket. Someone else should look into the diff to check if this is the only issue caused!

The difference between changeset 13365 and trac_5794-continued.patch is again only in irreducible-vs-atomic and reducible-vs-compound.

Changeset 13364 is not an attachment on #5794 and all it does is replacing some "reducible" by "compound" resp. "irreducible" by "atomic".

Changeset 13363 ("this temporary patch to be taken down when root system and 5794 patches stabilize.") seems not to be from the #5794 attachments either, and I don't really understand what it does. I don't know if anyone has ever "taken it down" or reverted its edits.

Changeset 13362 has noticeable differences from trac_5794-revised.patch and maybe someone should look into that.
