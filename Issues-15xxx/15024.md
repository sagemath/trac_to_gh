Possibly not a bug with *this* ticket but in Maxima (actually I think it's in our exponential integral), a branch cut difference between us and Mma in the integral:

```
sage: f(x) = Ei(-I*x) - 6*gamma(-1, I*x) - 15*gamma(-2, I*x) - 15*gamma(-3, I*x)
sage: f(3)
Ei(-3*I) - 6*gamma(-1, 3*I) - 15*gamma(-2, 3*I) - 15*gamma(-3, 3*I)
sage: f(3.)
-0.529089163583971 - 3.36665821311941*I
sage: g(x) = e^(-i*x)/x^3*(i*x^2+5*x-5*i)
sage: g(3.)
```
Also, the spherical Hankels don't make it into the top matter in the reference page - a very brief mention should suffice.

[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bessel_function#Spherical_Bessel_functions:_jn.2C_yn) and [DLMF](http://dlmf.nist.gov/10.51) agree that the derivative formulas for the various spherical functions only apply if the index is an integer.  I'm not sure how this connects to [W|A](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=derivative+of+spherical+bessel+j)'s solution to that.

Also

```
sage: integrate(spherical_bessel_J(1,x)^2,(x,0,oo))
1/6*pi
sage: integrate(spherical_bessel_Y(1,x)^2,(x,0,oo))
-1/6*pi
```
is just too cool not to include.

This is very nicely put together and other than these comments mostly needs just pseudo-random testing that mpmath or whoever doesn't have any weird error spots.  'Needs work' for updating updating documentation, otherwise 'needs info' for the other points raised.

Symbolic `floor`currently accepts `hold=True`, as does `ceil`. Why is the ticket still dependent on #12121?

Also, in investigating inaccuracies in plotting spherical Bessel functions for arguments less than one I came across this error:

```
sage: spherical_bessel_J(3,.1)
0.951851972086556*l - 5
```

This was supposedly fixed in#2494 but it's back. Will it be fixed when this ticket is merged?

I'd be happy to review this as soon as it's ready to go.

You're right. That somehow changed in the meantime.

I resolved merge conflicts and, based on beta6, I get

```

Doctests all pass. Documentation builds and has multiple preexisting issues, but that should be on a separate ticket.

Random numeric testing of new Hankel functions is accurate. Both functions plot. Symbolics behave as expected.

Per #20496 we are now supposed to escape abbreviated first names in references. There are three instances in the current branch that don't do that. If you fix those then I think it's ready to go.

There are changes in here I was planning to make, so I'm glad I read your list of open symbolics tickets beforehand!

In principle I could have introduced any possible change with it, so yes. But it is easy to check this, either per eyeball by skimming the diff again, or automatically (I just tried this the first time ever):

```
git diff develop >diff1
git co 821c307        (the commit before the merge)
git diff 7.3.beta6 >diff2
diff -u diff2 diff1
```
The output of the last diff should not contain lines that start with `++/+-/-+/--`. This way I found I somehow introduced some `orig` files into the branch so I'll delete those files. But as introducing and removing these files create completely unnecessary data I'll upload a new branch with an improved merge commit.
