For some reason Sage has spherical Hankel functions but not regular ones. This patch adds Hankel functions and makes spherical Hankel and Bessel functions symbolic, as well as adding arbitrary-precision numeric evaluation.

Depends on #18257

Please review. As to which category Hankel functions are in, if not "bessel", I would propose this hierarchy for orientation: special functions--->holonomic functions--->Bessel functions

Possibly not a bug with *this* ticket but in Maxima (actually I think it's in our exponential integral), a branch cut difference between us and Mma in the integral:

```
sage: f(x) = Ei(-I*x) - 6*gamma(-1, I*x) - 15*gamma(-2, I*x) - 15*gamma(-3, I*x)
sage: f(3)
Ei(-3*I) - 6*gamma(-1, 3*I) - 15*gamma(-2, 3*I) - 15*gamma(-3, 3*I)
sage: f(3.)
-0.529089163583971 - 3.36665821311941*I
sage: g(x) = e^(-i*x)/x^3*(i*x^2+5*x-5*i)
sage: g(3.)
```
Also, the spherical Hankels don't make it into the top matter in the reference page - a very brief mention should suffice.

[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bessel_function#Spherical_Bessel_functions:_jn.2C_yn) and [DLMF](http://dlmf.nist.gov/10.51) agree that the derivative formulas for the various spherical functions only apply if the index is an integer.  I'm not sure how this connects to [W|A](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=derivative+of+spherical+bessel+j)'s solution to that.

Also

```
sage: integrate(spherical_bessel_J(1,x)^2,(x,0,oo))
1/6*pi
sage: integrate(spherical_bessel_Y(1,x)^2,(x,0,oo))
-1/6*pi
```
is just too cool not to include.

This is very nicely put together and other than these comments mostly needs just pseudo-random testing that mpmath or whoever doesn't have any weird error spots.  'Needs work' for updating updating documentation, otherwise 'needs info' for the other points raised.

The failing doctest is because with this ticket the expression returned by `random_expr(20, nvars=2)` suddenly contains the nonsymbolic `floor` function which triggers the fail via

```

Symbolic `floor`currently accepts `hold=True`, as does `ceil`. Why is the ticket still dependent on #12121?

Also, in investigating inaccuracies in plotting spherical Bessel functions for arguments less than one I came across this error:

```
sage: spherical_bessel_J(3,.1)
0.951851972086556*l - 5
```

This was supposedly fixed in#2494 but it's back. Will it be fixed when this ticket is merged?

I'd be happy to review this as soon as it's ready to go.

I resolved merge conflicts and, based on beta6, I get

Unfortunately I'm now seeing changes to `airy.py` and `jacobi.py` that are not appropriate to this ticket. Please fix that.

When running doctests I get the message

```
ImportError: cannot import name meval
```

Similar error when trying to build documentation. Sage crashes on startup, with message in crash log:

```
---> 56 from sage.functions.special import meval
...
ImportError: cannot import name meval
```

Doctests all pass. Documentation builds and has multiple preexisting issues, but that should be on a separate ticket.

Random numeric testing of new Hankel functions is accurate. Both functions plot. Symbolics behave as expected.

Per #20496 we are now supposed to escape abbreviated first names in references. There are three instances in the current branch that don't do that. If you fix those then I think it's ready to go.

There are changes in here I was planning to make, so I'm glad I read your list of open symbolics tickets beforehand!

Positive review after cosmetic changes but there is now a merge conflict with 7.3.beta7.

Do I need to review again after conflict is resolved? What's the protocol on this?

In principle I could have introduced any possible change with it, so yes. But it is easy to check this, either per eyeball by skimming the diff again, or automatically (I just tried this the first time ever):

```
git diff develop >diff1
git co 821c307        (the commit before the merge)
git diff 7.3.beta6 >diff2
diff -u diff2 diff1
```
The output of the last diff should not contain lines that start with `++/+-/-+/--`. This way I found I somehow introduced some `orig` files into the branch so I'll delete those files. But as introducing and removing these files create completely unnecessary data I'll upload a new branch with an improved merge commit.
