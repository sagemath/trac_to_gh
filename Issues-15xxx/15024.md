Also

```

sage: integrate(spherical_bessel_Y(1,x)^2,(x,0,oo))

This is very nicely put together and other than these comments mostly needs just pseudo-random testing that mpmath or whoever doesn't have any weird error spots.  'Needs work' for updating updating documentation, otherwise 'needs info' for the other points raised.

In principle I could have introduced any possible change with it, so yes. But it is easy to check this, either per eyeball by skimming the diff again, or automatically (I just tried this the first time ever):

```
git diff develop >diff1
git co 821c307        (the commit before the merge)
git diff 7.3.beta6 >diff2
diff -u diff2 diff1
```
The output of the last diff should not contain lines that start with `++/+-/-+/--`. This way I found I somehow introduced some `orig` files into the branch so I'll delete those files. But as introducing and removing these files create completely unnecessary data I'll upload a new branch with an improved merge commit.
