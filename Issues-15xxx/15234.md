I am introdicing a method `sage.structure.parent.Parent._unset_category()` that changes the class into the "category-free" base class and resets the `._category` cdef attribute to None.

In this way, it is possible to redo a wrong initialisation or refinement of category.

The idea for creating this method arose in #15229: It is possible to do `R = IntegerModRing(15, category=Fields())`, and then `R` will believe that it is a field, and will actually be initialised in a sub-category of `Fields()`. With the new method, it would be possible to revert the wrong category initialisation and re-initialise it correctly.

Disclaimer:

- I do not think that we should *automatically* apply this method, e.g., if `R.is_field(proof=True)` finds out that the modulus actually isn't prime. Its use should be reserved to expert users.
- It is certainly impossible to erase all bad consequences of an originally wrong choice of a category. E.g., if one wrongly initialises/refines some ring R in the category of integral domains, then one can construct the fraction field, and after `R._unset_category()` the wrong fraction field would still exist, and would still be accessible from `R`. Hence, unsetting the category may help to cope with some mistakes, but it can of course not be a global eraser.
