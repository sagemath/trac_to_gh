Nothing in `sage.homology` makes use of the Parent/Element framework. But it would be nice to be able to work with chains and use normal syntax for addition and multiplication by scalars. The aim of this ticket is to adapt chain complexes. The analogous project for cell complexes will be left for a future ticket. 

Next to code cleanup, I also added ascii art support:

```
sage: C = ChainComplex([matrix(QQ, 3, 1), matrix(ZZ, 4, 3)])
sage: C
Chain complex with at most 3 nonzero terms over Rational Field
sage: %display ascii_art
sage: C
            [0 0 0]                
            [0 0 0]       [0]      
            [0 0 0]       [0]      
            [0 0 0]       [0]      
 0 <-- C_2 <-------- C_1 <---- C_0 <-- 0 
sage: C.an_element()
   d_2  [  9]  d_1  [-1/2]  d_0        d_-1  
0 <---- [ -1] <---- [   1] <---- [-1] <----- 0
        [1/5]       [   1]           
        [2/7]

<a id='comment:13'></a>Hey Volker and John,

I've worked in all of John's documentation changes and made a few of my own (plus rebased to the latest version of Sage). I don't think we should deprecate `torsion_list()` as it's not doing any harm and someone might find (or be finding) it useful. If you're happy with my changes, then I think we can set this to positive review.

Best,
