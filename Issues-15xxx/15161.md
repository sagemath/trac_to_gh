Nothing in `sage.homology` makes use of the Parent/Element framework. But it would be nice to be able to work with chains and use normal syntax for addition and multiplication by scalars. The aim of this ticket is to adapt chain complexes. The analogous project for cell complexes will be left for a future ticket. 

Next to code cleanup, I also added ascii art support:

```
sage: C = ChainComplex([matrix(QQ, 3, 1), matrix(ZZ, 4, 3)])
sage: C
Chain complex with at most 3 nonzero terms over Rational Field
sage: %display ascii_art
sage: C
            [0 0 0]                
            [0 0 0]       [0]      
            [0 0 0]       [0]      
            [0 0 0]       [0]      
 0 <-- C_2 <-------- C_1 <---- C_0 <-- 0 
sage: C.an_element()
   d_2  [  9]  d_1  [-1/2]  d_0        d_-1  
0 <---- [ -1] <---- [   1] <---- [-1] <----- 0
        [1/5]       [   1]           
        [2/7]                        
```

 Nothing in `sage.homology` makes use of the Parent/Element framework. But it would be nice to be able to work with chains and use normal syntax for addition and multiplication by scalars. The aim of this ticket is to adapt chain complexes. The analogous project for cell complexes will be left for a future ticket.

Since it is useful to see the coordinate expression of a chain that is supported only in a single degree (e.g. homology generators) they are printed differently: 

```
sage: D = ChainComplex({0: matrix(ZZ, 2, 2, [1,0,0,2])})
sage: D()
Trivial chain
sage: D({0:[2, 3]})
Chain(0:(2, 3))
sage: D({0:[2, 3], 1:[4, 5]})
Chain with 2 nonzero terms over Integer Ring
sage: z = D({1:[0,1]})
sage: z.is_boundary()
False
sage: (2*z).is_boundary()
True

Starting this week, using git should be relatively simple. If you download the current master from github (say) then installation should just work. See http://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/QuickStartSageGit

The developer scripts should also work as in http://sagemath.github.io/git-developer-guide/walk_through.html:

```
sage -dev checkout --ticket 15161
```
gets you the source code. Then make/test as usual. To see all source code changes relative to the master branch, use

```
sage -dev diff --base master
```

* I just merged in the current master so this ticket contains the dev scripts, too.

* The changeset browser in trac still needs some love...

Hey Volker and John,

I've worked in all of John's documentation changes and made a few of my own (plus rebased to the latest version of Sage). I don't think we should deprecate `torsion_list()` as it's not doing any harm and someone might find (or be finding) it useful. If you're happy with my changes, then I think we can set this to positive review.

Best,

Travis
