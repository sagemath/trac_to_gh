This ticket removes the dependency of sage.misc.superseded upon
sage.rings.integer_ring.is_IntegerRing which was used for type
checking. This allows for using the functions in this module in code
that is imported early upon Sage startup, in particular in category
code.

By the way, this removes an unneeded test (the ticket number cannot be None).

Ah, thanks for the pointer to __index__! That's exactly what I was
looking for. In a first version, I was using int(), but then "10963"
was accepted.

I left `_check_trac_number` though, since someone had taken the
time to write a nice error message, and a .__index__ AttributeError is
not super informative in this case.

Oh, big improvement: now the number must be bigger than 1 :-)

Cheers,

I just checked out your change, and am happy with them. Thanks!

So I guess that's a positive review assuming the patchpot goes green.

Is it really a race condition? I think it's just a plain bug. Changing the branch doesn't automatically add a "new commits" message.
