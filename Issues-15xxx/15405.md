Looks great. One comment is that the 'ice' boundary conditions are also called 'domain wall' boundary conditions. I added that to the documentation, and if you are happy with it, you may change to positive review.

One additional comment is that I noticed that if you type in 
SixVertexModel(3,2,boundary_conditions='ice')
it would give you the 3x3 square ice configurations. It would probably be better if it returned [] since there are no 3x2 6V configurations with domain wall boundary conditions, so if you could make that change, that would be great.
