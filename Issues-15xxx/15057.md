Actually, I didn't include the conversions for the exponential integrals and `lambert_w`. Patch for that coming up.

Here are the functions in Sage that are not in SymPy as far as I can tell. I haven't checked the ones in `sage/rings/arith.py` yet, and of course there are tons of combinatorial functions.

* Dickman's function (`dickman_rho` in Sage)
* Heaviside step function and unit step function (`heaviside` and `unit_step` in Sage; they only seem to differ in that `heaviside` is undefined at 0)
* Inverse Jacobi functions (`inverse_jacobi` in Sage)
* Jacobi amplitude function (to be added in #14996 as `jacobi_am`)
* Spherical Bessel and spherical Hankel functions (`spherical_bessel_J`, `spherical_bessel_Y`, `spherical_hankel1`, and `spherical_hankel2` in Sage)
* Symmetric zeta function (`zeta_symmetric` in Sage)
* Derivatives of the zeta function (`zetaderiv` in Sage)

Note that some SymPy conversions are going to be added in pending tickets that transition functions to use Sage's `BuiltinFunction` instead of being simple Maxima wrappers. For example, #15046 and #14996.
