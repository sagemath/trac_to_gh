I've pushed some review changes which gives a (marginal) bit of optimization for level 1 (since typically higher levels fail in the first `for` loop):

```
sage: ct = CartanType(['A',6,2])
sage: La = ct.root_system().weight_space().basis()
sage: LS = CrystalOfProjectedLevelZeroLSPaths(La[1]+La[2])
sage: %timeit LS.is_perfect()
1 loops, best of 3: 3.22 s per loop
```
Before:

```
sage: %timeit LS.is_perfect()
1 loops, best of 3: 3.32 s per loop
```

I've also marked a few tests as `# long time` since they took at least 10 seconds on my computer (with 2 threads). (I've left the `weyl_group_representation()` alone because it's really starting Gap that's taking the time.)

If you're happy with my changes, then it's a positive review.

Best,

Travis

I wasn't sure if you wanted this to be a public branch or not and I was trying to follow the (tentative) conventions we laid out at Sage Days.

> Also, when I pull your new branch, then the diff to master is enormous. It contains many other changes.


I made it based on `develop`, not `master`.

Hi Travis,

Yes, it is a public branch (as you can see since it starts with /public/....). I think we should stick with the first name and base it off master as I had done!
I will try to port your changes over.
