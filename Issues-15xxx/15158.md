Replying to [@kcrisman](#comment%3A2):

OK, I'll try.

> But I think you mean the function tested in the function changed (correctly) in #13686.

The functions `r_version` and `version` in `r.py` are affected, also `source` and `_source`, this seems unrelated to #13686.

> There is a good reason to test this function; it's a function in Sage, so it needs to be doctested. 

The return values depend on the R version that is called.
For example newer R has additional `L` in the source. So in total, four doctests fail.

With this patch
[http://trac.sagemath.org/changeset?new=628d5afab70880b7b7a24d3417d7ff996dbb816c&base=728e542453259b59b7e012f382e141652671d425&old=c29a7554ab4cfd9f0d17a8a242558db5b820b12a#file36](http://trac.sagemath.org/changeset?new=628d5afab70880b7b7a24d3417d7ff996dbb816c&base=728e542453259b59b7e012f382e141652671d425&old=c29a7554ab4cfd9f0d17a8a242558db5b820b12a#file36)
they pass (how can I point to a commit from here?).

> Perhaps there is a nice clever way to test this without allowing just any old output like `((25,1,3), 'R version -3.2.x')` 

If R is version -3.2.x, and `version` returns that, everything works correctly, doesn't it?

> but that would need to be done.

It's difficult to tell which version is present without a `version` call... In which way would the other tests pass, if R is a wrong one?

> so we shouldn't remove the function.  If that's not what you're implying, my apologies in advance.

No, I dont want to remove the checks, just allow the extra `L` and be a bit more tolerant about the version number.
