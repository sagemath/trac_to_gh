Sage fails to build on OSX 10.9.

Issues:

1. scipy doesn't play nicely with the new accelerate framework headers
2. R depends on CoreData which uses non-standard sqlite3 modules (and this affects us since we set `*_LIBRARY_PATH` and install a custom copy of sqlite3)
3. g++ and 10.9's cdefs.h header are currently incompatible, leading to a broken libstc++
4. accelerate framework no longer pretends to be atlas for linking purposes

---

To Apply:

1. Apply [attachment:trac15433.patch] to the Sage Library repository
2. [gcc-4.7.3.p1.spkg](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/ohanar/spkgs/gcc-4.7.3.p1.spkg)
3. [sqlite-3.7.17.p1.spkg](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/spkg/sqlite-3.7.17.p1.spkg)

As for the polybori issue, I'm not experiencing it anymore and I don't know what fixed it for me. I was going to setup a 10.9 VM, but unfortunately Apple refuses to let me download 10.9 on the machine I'm currently using -- however, I should be able to get a copy sometime in the few days.

I will update spkgs/add mercurial patches if we can fix this in time for 5.13, but for now it is much easier for me to work off of the git version.

Assuming you have git installed and in your path, you can do

```
$ git clone git://trac.sagemath.org/sage.git -b u/ohanar/10.9-port
```
to make a clone of the git repository, or if you already have a clone, you can do 

```
$ git fetch git://trac.sagemath.org/sage.git u/ohanar/10.9-port
$ git checkout -b u/ohanar/10.9-port FETCH_HEAD
```
from within the repository.

Looks like more or less the same problem as polybori. That said, symmetrica was updated in 5.13.beta2, so you may want to see if you still experience the issue with a more recent beta.

<a id='comment:27'></a>REMARKS:

* In build/pkgs/gcc/spkg-install and build/pkgs/sqlite/spkg-install ¶, change "OSX 10.9" to "OS X 10.9".   Also "posed" --> "posted".

* If trac #12627 gets in (which it should if rebased), then this would be deleted:

```
 if test -x "$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/sqlite3" && [ "$1" = '-sqlite3' -o "$1" = '--sqlite3' ]; then 
```

I am for having #12627 merged, since I can easily imagine users, scripts, workflows, whatever that have "sage --sqlite3" in them, and would be broken by the above change.

Modulo testing (on 10.4, 10.5, 10.6, 10.7, 10.8, 10.9), and the above comment regarding #12627, I think this patch looks excellent.
