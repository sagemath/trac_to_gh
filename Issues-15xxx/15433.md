Sage fails to build on OSX 10.9.

Issues:

1. scipy doesn't play nicely with the new accelerate framework headers
2. R depends on CoreData which uses non-standard sqlite3 modules (and this affects us since we set `*_LIBRARY_PATH` and install a custom copy of sqlite3)
3. g++ and 10.9's cdefs.h header are currently incompatible, leading to a broken libstc++
4. accelerate framework no longer pretends to be atlas for linking purposes

---

To Apply:

1. Apply [attachment:trac15433.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket15433/trac15433.patch) to the Sage Library repository
2. [gcc-4.7.3.p1.spkg](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/ohanar/spkgs/gcc-4.7.3.p1.spkg)
3. [sqlite-3.7.17.p1.spkg](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/spkg/sqlite-3.7.17.p1.spkg)
4. [scipy-0.12.0.p1.spkg](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/ohanar/spkgs/scipy-0.12.0.p1.spkg)

The attached branch should fix everything except for the polybori issue. This should be checked on older OSX versions, since I've made some changes that are not 10.9 specific (I've checked these changes against bsd.math, and they work fine there).

As for the polybori issue, I'm not experiencing it anymore and I don't know what fixed it for me. I was going to setup a 10.9 VM, but unfortunately Apple refuses to let me download 10.9 on the machine I'm currently using -- however, I should be able to get a copy sometime in the few days.

I will update spkgs/add mercurial patches if we can fix this in time for 5.13, but for now it is much easier for me to work off of the git version.

Assuming you have git installed and in your path, you can do

```
$ git clone git://trac.sagemath.org/sage.git -b u/ohanar/10.9-port
```
to make a clone of the git repository, or if you already have a clone, you can do 

```
$ git fetch git://trac.sagemath.org/sage.git u/ohanar/10.9-port
$ git checkout -b u/ohanar/10.9-port FETCH_HEAD
```
from within the repository.

Looks like more or less the same problem as polybori. That said, symmetrica was updated in 5.13.beta2, so you may want to see if you still experience the issue with a more recent beta.

I don't know how the new build system works, but if you modify a file like `build/pkgs/gcc/spkg-install`, for example, should you also modify `build/pkgs/gcc/package-version.txt` so that the new version gets built? I have a version of Sage/git from early October, and when I cloned this branch and ran `make`, gcc was not rebuilt — it didn't even try, the log file was not modified — while scipy, for example, just returned the message `Package scipy-0.12.0.p0 is already installed.`

Building the whole thing from scratch worked well, though, and all tests passed.

Regarding the patch to gcc/spkg-install, for consistency's sake among other things, would it be a good idea to check the OS X version number the same way it's done in prereqs? That is, <code>DARWIN_VERSION=\`uname -r | cut '-d.' -f1\`</code>?

> Would it be a good idea on OS X to create a symlink at `local/bin/sqlite3` pointing to `/usr/bin/sqlite3` (or whatever the output of `command -v sqlite3` is)? Then `sage --sqlite3` would still work.

See trac #12627 which would fix this.

As I noted at #12627, that ticket is somewhat controversial, and I'm not sure it's a good idea to get it merged soon. Something much more targeted, like making a symlink for sqlite3 only on OS X, seems more palatable.

REMARKS:

* In build/pkgs/gcc/spkg-install and build/pkgs/sqlite/spkg-install ¶, change "OSX 10.9" to "OS X 10.9".   Also "posed" --> "posted".

* If trac #12627 gets in (which it should if rebased), then this would be deleted:

```
 if test -x "$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/sqlite3" && [ "$1" = '-sqlite3' -o "$1" = '--sqlite3' ]; then 
```

I am for having #12627 merged, since I can easily imagine users, scripts, workflows, whatever that have "sage --sqlite3" in them, and would be broken by the above change.

Modulo testing (on 10.4, 10.5, 10.6, 10.7, 10.8, 10.9), and the above comment regarding #12627, I think this patch looks excellent.
