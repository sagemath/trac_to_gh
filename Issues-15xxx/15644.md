See [this ask.sagemath question](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/3378/).

```
sage: X = [var('x%d' % i) for i in range(20)]
sage: R = PolynomialRing(QQ, 'x', 11)
sage: R.ideal(x0).groebner_fan()
RuntimeError: Ring variables cannot contain each other as prefixes
```
Presumably this is because of some other software that has this limitation which computes the fan?  I hope I'm understanding the post correctly.
