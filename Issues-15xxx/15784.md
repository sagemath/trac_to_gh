The **dict.has_key()** is not supported in Python 3.0, in favor of the `key in d` idiom which was introduced in 2.2. [Formal deprecation](http://docs.pythonsprints.com/python3_porting/py-porting.html#replacing-dict-has-key) of **dict.has_key()** began in 2.6.

Hey André I am willing to review this as I am in debt for the review of the patch bomb that brought python 2.7 in sage. Did you use a script to automate this or was it a long labor in between between grep?
