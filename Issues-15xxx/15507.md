On Sage-devel [1], Christian reported an humiliating error message :

```
sage: graphs.PathGraph(70000).diameter()       
...
ValueError: The graph backend contains more than 65535 nodes
```

This is because Sage's "static_sparse_graphs" are stored on `unsigned short` fields (and thus to 65536 vertices), and though this is a meaningful limitation for Sage's code to compute the "all pairs shortest path" (the distance between all pairs of vertices, i.e. a n<sup>2</sup> matrix of integers), it does not make any sense to refuse to compute the diameter of such graphs.

Soooooooooo this patch changes these "unsigned short" to 32-bits unsigned integers (and note more, because that already doubles the memory requires), which is also good to have when Simon is about to use the same data structure for combinatorial graphs, which can be huge.

I have to mention that this does not make "diameter" answer very fast either on instances with more than 65536 vertices `:-/`

```
sage: %time graphs.PathGraph(70000).diameter()
CPU times: user 132.41 s, sys: 0.16 s, total: 132.57 s
Wall time: 133.42 s
69999
```

But at least we can build them `T_T`

What this patch does:
* change the type of the static_sparse_graph data structure from ushort to uint32_t, as well as the functions that use it
* change the `all_pairs_shortest_path_BFS` function to first compute the distance on a `int *` array of length `n`. The values are then copied into the `n^2` matrix of `ushort` if necessary. That's a loss of time, but it's either this or rewriting two versions of the function `:-/`
* remove a useless `degree` variable in the same function
* Some simplifications from place to place in the code

Out of curiosity: why do you now use `public/ticketnumber` after using `u/ncohen/ticketnumber` before?

I cannot judge if you created any problems anywhere in the code, but I guess you know what you are doing...

I just ran the doctest on all of graphs, and the only error I see is `AttributeError in doctesting framework` which is also there without having your changes applied.

I didn't see any new doctest for the code testing the diameter for something bigger, line the line graph of 70000 vertices. Don't you think it would be nice to have such an example in the code?

Cheers, Christian

Because I don't like it that people have to create their own branch to add a commit. Most of the time it's only typos or non-controversial stuff, so well, let's keep it simple and write on the same branches. I don't link this permission stuff anyway.

> I just ran the doctest on all of graphs, and the only error I see is `AttributeError in doctesting framework` which is also there without having your changes applied.


Hmmmmmm... Perhaps you should report that somewhere, the git version should be the "official" version quite soon.

> I didn't see any new doctest for the code testing the diameter for something bigger, line the line graph of 70000 vertices. Don't you think it would be nice to have such an example in the code?
