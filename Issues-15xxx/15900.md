The TeX directory structure (TDS) reserves "generic" for macro files that do "not rely on any particular format" (cf. `http://tug.org/tds/tds.html#Macros`). This does certainly not apply to sagetex, which is clearly a latex package. Therefore, `local/share/texmf/tex/generic/sagetex` should be moved to `local/share/texmf/tex/latex/sagetex` and the documentation should be adapted to reflect this fact.

Apart from violating the TDS, this is also annoying: on my system, a prepackaged version of sagetex.sty comes with the package texlive-latex-extra (version 2009-10ubuntu1). While outdated, it is installed in a TDS compliant location (`/usr/share/texmf-texlive/tex/latex/sagetex/sagetex.sty`).

The standard search path for _latex_ is (removed non-pertinent items and
inserted line breaks as separators)

```
$kpsepath -n latex tex |tr ':' '\n'
  .
  /home/[...]/texmf/tex/latex//
  !!/usr/local/share/texmf/tex/latex//
  !!/usr/share/texmf/tex/latex//
  /home/[...]/texmf/tex/generic//
  !!/usr/share/texmf/tex/generic//
```

which means that the systems version of sagetex.sty is given
precedence over that in my homedirectory resulting from
`cp -R SAGE_ROOT/local/share/texmf/tex TEXMFHOME`
as recommended by
`http://www.sagemath.org/doc/installation/sagetex.html`

I'd like to push a git branch correcting the problem, but sagetex seems to be developed outside the sage git respository?

It would be really nice to see sagetex fully inside the sage repository (so also on trac, which is IMHO mirrored on github).
