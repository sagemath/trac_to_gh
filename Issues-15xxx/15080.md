It seems that Python will fall back to narrow curses if necessary. But if the distribution provides a wide curses then it will be preferred over the narrow one. On my Fedora 19 install, this leads to (with the old ncurses spkg):

Just a few random remarks: why use [This is the Trac macro * * that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros# -macro) rather than plain [ ] for testing?
Could you mention the ticket number in SPKG.txt?
I know it may seem overkill but it always nice to have all info available at once...
