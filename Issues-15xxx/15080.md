Just a few random remarks: why use [This is the Trac macro * * that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros# -macro) rather than plain [ ] for testing?
Could you mention the ticket number in SPKG.txt?
I know it may seem overkill but it always nice to have all info available at once...

IMHO we should delete the duplicate changelog keeping as soon as we have a working git version. Its just a stupid waste of developer time.
