sage: max(RIF(2,3), RIF(1,4)).endpoints()
(2.00000000000000, 3.00000000000000)
```

We should check that all python builtin functions are overwritten for `RealIntervalField` (or work consistently by default).

The first problem is I think a problem of the builtin max in Python (which never fails).

For the second problem, you should use floor and not int. But anyway, there is a bug in the function as x_interval.upper().floor() may fail with a `ValueError` if the upper is infinity (line 582 and 583 in sage/functions/other.py). I guess one should fix floor at that point.

Good luck!

We cannot fix this (that is just how Python's `max()` works):

```
sage: max(RIF(2,3), RIF(1,4)).endpoints()
(2.00000000000000, 3.00000000000000)
```
but this works:

```
sage: RIF(2,3).max(RIF(1,4)).endpoints()
(2.00000000000000, 4.00000000000000)
