As reported for example by leif on #11687, the flag `-fno-strict-aliasing` should always be added when compiling Cython code. Normally, this flag is added but it disappears when the user has manually set `CFLAGS` (even if set to `""`).

Looks like one of the oldest thing we have in sage-on-gentoo ebuilds. Except we don't patch setup.py to achieve it. That's one thing I can remove if this goes in. Positive from me.
