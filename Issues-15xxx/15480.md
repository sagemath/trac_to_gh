Right now equality between sets of words only compares the alphabets:

```
sage: Words(3, 10) == Words(3,900)
True
sage: Words(2, finite=False) == Words(2)    
True
sage: Words(2) == Words(2,30)           
True
sage: Words(10,0) == Words(20,0)                                                                                                                                                   
False
sage: WordPaths('abcd') == Words("abcd",3)
True
```

I am not proud of this patch's code, but I see NO other way to fix all these incorrect answers without rewriting the class hierarchy. The fact that a class of finite words is an instance (i.e. it inherits) from a class of infinite words makes it really hard to implement `O_o`

```
sage: isinstance(Words(4,30), type(Words(3)))
True
```

You cannot be sure, when implementing the `__eq__` method of `Words_all`, that self really represents an infinite class of words.

Besides, the old code reads:

```
        if isinstance(other, Words_all):
            return self.alphabet() == other.alphabet()
        else:
            return NotImplemented
```

I haven't been able to guess when `not (type(self) is type(other))` does not mean that the two classes should not be reported as equal.
Though the old code seems to imply that this can happen.

If this can happen we need to add a doctest somewhere.

I am not familiar with the git process of reviewing a patch... Is it easy or difficult to learn? Is Sage ready for including git patches? I will have time to learn the git process in January or February.

Unfortunately because of sage's depreciation policy we can't just remove `paths.py`, even if this is the *right* thing to do. 

I was going to suggest that we instead remove the doc tests of the form

```
sage: Words("abcd") == WordPaths("abcd")
True
```
Without these we could have a more natural looking equality test.

Unfortunately, with this "more natural" equiality test there are now multiple doctest failures in finite_word.py and in word_generators.py. So this is not a good solution. I have not drilled down to find out why these doctests fail because this does not happen with Nathann's patch. So, as unnatural as the code looks, it is perhaps the best way to go.

<a id='comment:12'></a>I've pushed a new commit which adds a warning message to the documentation of `Words_all` about extending the class and potential problems with `__eq__` and elsewhere. 

All doctests pass in sage/combinat so assuming that the patchbot is happy I give this a positive review.
