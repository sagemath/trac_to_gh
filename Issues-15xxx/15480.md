Right now equality between sets of words only compares the alphabets:

```
sage: Words(3, 10) == Words(3,900)
True
sage: Words(2, finite=False) == Words(2)    
True
sage: Words(2) == Words(2,30)           
True
sage: Words(10,0) == Words(20,0)                                                                                                                                                   
False
sage: WordPaths('abcd') == Words("abcd",3)
True
```

I am not proud of this patch's code, but I see NO other way to fix all these incorrect answers without rewriting the class hierarchy. The fact that a class of finite words is an instance (i.e. it inherits) from a class of infinite words makes it really hard to implement `O_o`

```
sage: isinstance(Words(4,30), type(Words(3)))
True
```

You cannot be sure, when implementing the `__eq__` method of `Words_all`, that self really represents an infinite class of words.

Besides, the old code reads:

```
        if isinstance(other, Words_all):
            return self.alphabet() == other.alphabet()
        else:
            return NotImplemented
```

I haven't been able to guess when `not (type(self) is type(other))` does not mean that the two classes should not be reported as equal.
Though the old code seems to imply that this can happen.

If this can happen we need to add a doctest somewhere.

Oh. I see. That's for 

```
sage: Words("abcd") == WordPaths("abcd")
True
```

Then for this case I will keep the old behaviour.

Ready for review ! This is only hacks, but it fixes the wrong results `:-/`

I was just looking at this and I agree it's a mess. I thought that you might be able to get away with just

```python
        if self.cardinality()!=other.cardinality():
            return False
        if self.cardinality()==1:
            return True
        if self.alphabet() != other.alphabet():
            return False
        return type(self)==type(other)
```
but this does not catch 

```
sage: Words("abcd") == WordPaths("abcd")
True
```
As I don't really play with these things it is not clear to me that these two should be equal. 

Is this really correct?

I did not know the existence of WordPaths either before this patch, but I think this has been done on purpose for there are 4 doctests in the `__eq__` function that test this kind of equalities. So it's not just a result of the code, it seems to be somebody wanted to get there. But that's just guessing.

As per the cardinality test I tried to avoid calling `self.cardinality()` twice. I was wondering if this could be costly from time to time, but it's defintely prettier without this caching, so if you think it's overkill let's rewrite it as you did as I cannot produce an word where `.cardinality()` takes time.

Unfortunately because of sage's depreciation policy we can't just remove `paths.py`, even if this is the *right* thing to do. 

I was going to suggest that we instead remove the doc tests of the form

```
sage: Words("abcd") == WordPaths("abcd")
True
```
Without these we could have a more natural looking equality test.

Unfortunately, with this "more natural" equiality test there are now multiple doctest failures in finite_word.py and in word_generators.py. So this is not a good solution. I have not drilled down to find out why these doctests fail because this does not happen with Nathann's patch. So, as unnatural as the code looks, it is perhaps the best way to go.

I've pushed a new commit which adds a warning message to the documentation of `Words_all` about extending the class and potential problems with `__eq__` and elsewhere. 

All doctests pass in sage/combinat so assuming that the patchbot is happy I give this a positive review.
