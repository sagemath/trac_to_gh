When I run tests, I often remain with spurious gap processes in the background. For example running

```
sage -t /src/sage/combinat/root_system/coxeter_group.py
```
I end up with

```
84121- gap          98.0  07:30.09 1/1  0    14   30     155M   240K   156M   266M   1099M  84121 1     running  501  40753
```
This is on a MacOS 10.6.8 with coxeter3 installed.
