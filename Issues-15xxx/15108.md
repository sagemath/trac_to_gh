Keywords: base extend hyperelliptic curve sd53

```

sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
sage: H = HyperellipticCurve(x^5+x+1)
sage: E = EllipticCurve([0,0,0,1,1])
sage: E.change_ring(RR)
Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 = x^3 + 1.00000000000000*x + 1.00000000000000 over Real Field with 53 bits of precision
sage: E.base_extend(RR)
Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 = x^3 + 1.00000000000000*x + 1.00000000000000 over Real Field with 53 bits of precision
sage: H.change_ring(RR)
Hyperelliptic Curve over Real Field with 53 bits of precision defined by y^2 = x^5 + x + 1.00000000000000
sage: H.base_extend(RR)
Closed subscheme of Projective Space of dimension 2 over Real Field with 53 bits of precision defined by:
  -x0^5 + x1^2*x2^3 - x0*x2^4 - x2^5
```

The last output should be a hyperelliptic curve object too.
