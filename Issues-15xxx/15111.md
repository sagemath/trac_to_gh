The following test fails with one of the tests getting segmentation fault:

```
$ sage -t --long sage/modular/modform/find_generators.py
```
The error message can come in two forms. I am attaching both. The error can be created more directly by:

```
sage: ModularFormsRing(Gamma0(3)).modular_forms_of_weight(80).cuspidal_submodule().q_expansion_basis()
```
I am using sage version 5.11, compiled from source, in Ubuntu on a x86-64 machine.

**Keywords:** segfault doctest
