If you have a RealField or ComplexField NaN value and attempt to compute log, the fact that NaN is considered < 0 results in RealField.log calling ComplexField.log, but then ComplexField.log calls RealField.log again, but again on the values NaN for the absolute value. This results in an infinite loop. Example code for the code: 

x = RealField()(NaN)
x.log() # Results in infinite loop

This patch fixes the log function in RealField and ComplexField to return NaN if fed a number which is NaN (in either the real or the imaginary coordinate).

<a id='comment:3'></a>A couple things

1) the patch needs a commit message

2) the patch name should be trac_15388_<description>.patch

3) Please add a doctest to each log function to demonstrate the fix

4) lines 2063, 2064 which are commented out look like they can just be removed as they add no value to the code
