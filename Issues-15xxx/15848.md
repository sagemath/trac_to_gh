Previously, non-deterministic transducers could not be simplified via
Moore's algorithm.  In fact, the old code was already able to do that,
but an error was thrown nevertheless.  This check has been moved to
minimization of Automata, because it is still required
there.

Otherwise, the docstrings have been adapted to explain this
generalization.

Finally, the old docstring of `_minimization_Moore_` erroneously claimed to 
run Brzozowski's algorithm, which is now corrected.
