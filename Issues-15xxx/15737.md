The following produces a error

```
E = EllipticCurve([-100,0])
s = E.sha()
s.an_padic(13)
```

The error comes from the an_padic asking for only the first constant coefficient of the p-adic L-series. But it does not harm to compute the next one too. (This arises only when a twist is involved, otherwise the the modular symbol at 0 is called directly.)

Keywords: padic l-functions

Would it be possible to solve the problem instead by fixing the `series` method of `pAdicLSeriesOrdinary`, and similarly of `pAdicLSeriesSupersingular`, rather than the call to it?  I mean something like this:

This would also make the following work:

Looks good, just one more small thing: in the case where *E* is supersingular at *p*, `prec=1` and `eta != 0`, you have the line

```
padic_prec = [[20,20]]
```
(the `padic_prec` is simply 20 in the analogous ordinary case.)
Is this correct?  It seems to cause errors of the following kind:

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve("17a1")
sage: L = E.padic_lseries(3)
sage: L.series(4,prec=1,eta=1)
...
TypeError: unable to coerce <type 'list'> to an integer
```
