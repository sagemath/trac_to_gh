The following produces a error

```
E = EllipticCurve([-100,0])
s = E.sha()
s.an_padic(13)
```

The error comes from the an_padic asking for only the first constant coefficient of the p-adic L-series. But it does not harm to compute the next one too. (This arises only when a twist is involved, otherwise the the modular symbol at 0 is called directly.)

Keywords: **padic l-functions**

The constant term of the p-adic L-function is a multiple of m(0)=L(E,1)/Omega where m is the modular symbol attached to E. Whatever n is, the constant term is always correct (up to the precision with which alpha was computed). So in some sense no-one should want to compute the constant term with a p-adic L-function as one can do it without.

But I think prec=1 could be a acceptable entry and then we should return just the constant term (as a powerseries with O(T) ) but avoiding all summation computations. Then I can go back to sha and leave it as it was. That would be a better solution, not only fixing the bug, but also improving the code.

I will try to do this over the next days.

Looks good, just one more small thing: in the case where *E* is supersingular at *p*, `prec=1` and `eta != 0`, you have the line

```
padic_prec = [[20,20]]
```
(the `padic_prec` is simply 20 in the analogous ordinary case.)
Is this correct?  It seems to cause errors of the following kind:

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve("17a1")
sage: L = E.padic_lseries(3)
sage: L.series(4,prec=1,eta=1)
...
TypeError: unable to coerce <type 'list'> to an integer
```
