The following produces a error

```
E = EllipticCurve([-100,0])
s = E.sha()
s.an_padic(13)
```

The error comes from the an_padic asking for only the first constant coefficient of the p-adic L-series. But it does not harm to compute the next one too. (This arises only when a twist is involved, otherwise the the modular symbol at 0 is called directly.)

Keywords: padic l-functions
