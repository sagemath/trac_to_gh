```
In "The Sage Manuals" in the Developer's Guide there should be mentioned how Links are inserted in the Documentation.

Easy:

```
A link http://www.tar.get is created.
```
More advanced:

```
We have the link `title <http://www.tar.get>`_.
```
The latter has the advantage (beside adding a title if you like) that a full stop or a comma can be added after the link without a space. Probably, this should also be mentioned.

Further, use this new knowledge to remove the space-full-stop at line 296 of `sage_manuals.rst`

Keywords: **documentation, Sage Manuals, links, rest**

hello,

I have made a few changes. The only notable one is to use a more neutral example of http adress (not a commercial one).

If you agree with my changes, you can set this ticket to positive review on my behalf.
