This is a polynomial in several variables, useful in the study of Feynman diagrams.

Done using a determinant (like in the matrix-tree theorem)

Also implements cycle_basis for graphs with multiple edges

and add an 'output' parameter to 'cycle_basis', 'is_tree' and 'is_forest'

Component: **graph theory**

Keywords: **symanzik polynomial**

Author: **Frédéric Chapoton**

Hello Frederic !

I think you could replace your "quasitree_to_cycle" function by a call to `Graph.is_forest(certificate=True)`. Could you also merge all these patches into one ? It would make it a bit easier to review `^^;`

Hello Nathann,

thanks for the suggestion. But `is_forest` does not work correctly on graphs with multiple edges:

```

sage: G=graphs.CycleGraph(6)
sage: G.is_forest()
False
sage: G.is_forest(certificate=True)
(False, [5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0])
sage: G = Graph([(1,2,'a'),(1,2,'b')])
sage: G.is_forest(certificate=True)
sage: G.is_forest()
False
```
and moreover I need the cycle as a sequence of signed edges.

Hello Nathann,

I have now made good use of the `is_tree` function.

Would you prefer if I put my auxiliary function inside the new method ? I do not see how to avoid it completely. I need to choose an arbitray orientation of the graph, and for this I am using the way the edges are given by a pair (i,j). Then I need to know how every cycle is oriented, some arrows being in the wrong direction.

Is this really necessary to smash all my commits (not patches) into one ? I would prefer not to.

Hellooooooooo !

Your auxiliary method will not be in your final patch, that's for sure, because even if it were actually useful for your code it has no general use and has nothing to do has a Graph function.

I have now added some code to cycle_basis

But one cannot reconstruct a cycle from its support in a graph with multiple edges, so I cannot use that, unless I change the output of cycle_basis to a list of edges.

When you tell me you want more explanations, do you mean
* here in trac
* as comments in the code
* in the doc of the code ?

Well, the best way would be to add a flag to `cycle_basis` to ask precisely this : how should the output be given ? While saying that of course the "vertex" output cannot be used if the graph has multiple edges.

I would personally like it very much if you could answer the questions I ask here with real words and not only with git commits. Then, the problem is the following : the code is clearly not documented properly, as I cannot understand what it does, and I can swear this review costed me a lot of time already.

I would like to understand clearly the orientation that you pick, and all steps that you use to build the matrix, then to compute the coefficients. Besides, this should be written somewhere, in the docstring or as comments in the code.

I knew. Git can also be used directly to output such things. But it does not help at all either when every commits contradicts the previous ones. Several commits can be very useful when each of the commit does some meaningful task, that actually helps the review. Commiting the mistakes one makes while writing the patch does not.

Hello

Thank you Nathann for spending time on this, and sorry for not answering well-enough.

I have now added a 'output' keyword to 'cycle_basis', 'is_tree' and 'is_forest'.

Still I am not satisfied, because when output is set to 'edge', the cycle is not returned as a list of triples (vertex,vertex,label), but as a list of pairs [vertex,vertex]. It cannot therefore be recognized as an edge, i.e does not belongs to G.edges().

I will try later to correct that.

Hmmmmm... It was actually slightly more complicated than that. This, and supper in between.

Technically : 
* networkx refuses to work on a graph that allows multiple edges, even if it does not contain any
* `cycle_basis` now handles disconnected graphs

Aaaaaaaaand I found a bug with those cursed multiple edges again :

```
sage: g = Graph({0:{1:[1,1]}}, multiedges=True)
sage: g.edges()
[(0, 1, 1), (0, 1, 1)]
sage: (2*g).edges()
[(0, 1, 1), (2, 3, 1)]
```

I hate these things...

Anyway, branch updated. Tell me what you think !
