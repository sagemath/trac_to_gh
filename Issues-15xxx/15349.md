The attached patch provides a `values()` method for lazy families. While not very useful in the infinite case, it helps avoiding things like this:

```

AttributeError: 'LazyFamily_with_category' object has no attribute 'values'
```

(The `gens` method on combinatorial free modules was introduced in #13214, and returns `tuple(self.basis().values())`, so the error appears every time a basis is a lazy family rather than a regular finite family, even if the lazy family is finite!) Of course, the symmetric group algebra has a more economical generating set than this, but I assume other combinatorial free modules still profit from this.

(That said, I never understood how to tell from inside code whether `gens()` returns an algebra generating set or a module generating set... Can anyone enlighten me on that?)

Someone please assure me whether the keys of a lazy(!) family can be assumed ordered. They seem to be stored as a `set`, which I never fully understood. If their order is system-dependent, that should probably be said in the doc of the `values()` method.

The patch also removes some warnings which were made over 4 years ago (#5538).

I think it's CombinatorialFreeModule that should be fixed to not use `.values()` but instead

```
    return tuple(self.basis())
```

By the way, this gens method would fit better in the ModulesWithBasis category (with a sanity check that it's not infinite dimensional), or better in ModulesWithBasis.FiniteDimensional (note: check for potential conflicts with #11111).

Hi Darij!

Unless we later find a compelling use case, I'd say for now it's just a temporary workaround; so keep it around for yourself, or even push it in the "queue" (or whatever will happen to it); but for now I would not get this change in Sage unless it's really needed for some other ticket. 

Cheers,
                           Nicolas

Hi Nicolas,

thanks for looking into it. I'll change status to "new" then.\\
I probably am not going to do anything about ModulesWithBasis myself, but I'd welcome any improvements on that class.

Best regards,\\
Darij
