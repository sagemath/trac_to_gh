This patch brings some little speedups on tableaux and skew tableaux, in particular copying over the #15269 fixes to `skew_tableau.py`. It also modifies the semantics of the `to_chain` function so as to allow an optional `max_entry` parameter (which makes it return a chain of a given length -- useful if one is considering semistandard tableaux with ceiling higher than the highest entry). Furthermore it moves the `attacking_pairs` method from `tableau.py` to `partition.py`, and deprecates it in `tableau.py`. In the only place where this method is used, it is factored in for speed reasons.

Ready for review.

The `restriction_shape` method has been introduced in `tableau.py` because it is at least twice faster than `restrict(i).shape()` (probably due to the hackery with exceptions in the latter) and the shape of the restriction seems to be used more often than the restriction itself. The `restriction_outer_shape` method in `skew_tableau.py` is arguably less useful (it is only about 20% faster than `restrict(i).outer_shape()` in the cases I checked) and I will remove it if you think it clutters up stuff.

Some of the doc bugs fixed here are due to me *oops*.

Hey Darij,

Here's a review patch which does:

- some docstring tweaks,
- adds a method `restriction_shape()` to `skew_tableau.py` (which how it's done is [much] faster than the direct implementation I tried),
- and does some minor speedup to the creation of `SkewPartition`.

Before:

```
sage: %timeit skp = SkewPartition([[3,2,1],[2,1]])
10000 loops, best of 3: 184 us per loop
sage: %timeit skp = SkewPartition([[3,2,1],[2,1]])
1000 loops, best of 3: 178 us per loop
```
With patch:

```
sage: %timeit skp = SkewPartition([[3,2,1],[2,1]])
10000 loops, best of 3: 115 us per loop
sage: %timeit skp = SkewPartition([[3,2,1],[2,1]])
1000 loops, best of 3: 112 us per loop
```

If you're happy with my changes, then you can go ahead and set this to positive review.

Best,

Travis
