After typing

```
sage: f = x^2+1
sage: R.<i> = ZZ.extension(f)
```
I expect variable `i` to be the element of `R` named `'i'`. However, it is not. It is the element 1.

This is due to the generators of an order in Sage being its //module// generators (as noted by `EquationOrder?`):

```
sage: R.gens()
[1, i]
```

We fix this by redefining `_first_ngens()` (which is what the preparser uses to implement the `R.<x> =` syntax) to use `_defining_names()`, which we override for orders.

Is it really the syntactic sugar that poses problem? It seems that `inject_variables()` is the problem.

```python
sage: f = x^2+1
sage: R = ZZ.extension(f,'i')
sage: R.inject_variables()
Defining i
sage: i
1
```

The problem seems to come from the fact that `R.variable_names()` is `('i',)` while `R.gens()` is `[1,i]`, and a `zip` is called on these two objects, resulting in `[('i',1)]`.

That's not a major problem. For `R.<x> =` to work, it suffices to change the `_first_ngens()` method (without deprecation).

We could then add a boolean argument `ring` to `gens()`, defaulting to `False` (deprecated) which returns the *ring* generator (i.e. new-style `gens()`) if `ring=True`.

No need for a new method, there is already `basis()` which does exactly that (currently `gens()` simply calls `basis()`).

Just a comment:  not every order is monogenic, so it is not so clear what gens() should return in general if not module generators, though of course this particular construction will always produce a monogenic order.

Back to the original task I was trying, it is a pity if there is not a simple one-liner to define a ring of the form Z[a] from a polynomial (min poly of a) and simultaneously assigne the value a to a variable called a.

I don't really like unconditionally preferring `ring_generators()` in such a general place as `_first_n_gens()` is. Perhaps this should be something like `defining_generators()` instead of `ring_generators()`. This would be set when defining something by generators, and always refer to the generators from the definition. That said, s/ring/defining/ can be done later, so out of pragmatism I'm not against the current approach.

However, the current approach with `ring_generators()` doesn't always work as expected, which could be considered be a separate bug (namely lack of prepopulating ring_generators if defining something by ring generators). For instance

```
K.<i> = NumberField(x^2+1)
O = K.order(-i+1)
gens = O.ring_generators()
if gens == [-i+1]:
  print "O.<a> = K.order(-i+1) would work as expected"
else:
  print "O.<a> = K.order(-i+1) would make a equal to %r, not as -i+1 as expected." % gens[0]
```
prints

```
O.<a> = K.order(-i+1) would make a equal to i, not as -i+1 as expected.
```
on https://sagecell.sagemath.org/.

What do you think? Which `?_gens` should generally be used and should populating `?_gens` with the defining generators be separate bugs?

That's a bit harder to solve since there currently is no way to recover the `-i+1` used to create the order. We would need to change `def order(...)` to store the given generators.

If you want this to work:

```
sage: K.<i> = NumberField(x^2+1)
sage: O.<a> = K.order(-i+1)
sage: a
-i + 1
```
you'll need to drop unique representation for orders: currently, the following two return the exact same object:

```
sage: O1 = K.order(-i+1)
sage: O2 = K.order(-i)
sage: O1 is O2
True
```
You cannot have `O1.defining_generators()` and `O2.defining_generators()` be different if `O1` is the same object as `O2`. So this cannot be fixed without making major changes.

Well, it all boils down to the difference between "equal" and "isomorphic" which is really a difference in how we use mathematics and not in mathematics itself.

In your example with `K1` and `K2`, one could argue that those fields are not equal because there is no canonical (again, this is not a mathematically well-defined term) isomorphism.

For orders on the other hand, it makes a lot of sense to see orders as subsets of a number field. Then obviously two orders are equal if they are the same subset of the number field. That's the view that Sage uses. I admit that it's all quite subtle.

Regardless, I don't think that this should hold back this ticket. I'm sure that many people have stumbled on the bug on this ticket, so let's just fix it. It also makes it possible to implement #7545. We can still look at further subtleties later.

My point about wanting `O.<foo> = K.order(-i+1)` to work is moot, because `.order` doesn't take a names argument, so that the syntactic sugar doesn't work in this case anyway.

As far as I can tell these patches indeed fix `R.<a> = EquationOrder(f)` and `R.<a> = ZZ.extension(f)`, where `f` is a polynomial. Also AFAICT, this is by virtue of `NumberField` using `1, a, a^2, ...` as basis, and other things normalizing to that basis.

I tried for instance the following to make sure `ring_generators` could not be distracted:

```
from sage.rings.number_field.order import AbsoluteOrder
K.<i> = NumberField(x^2+1)
V, from_v, to_v = K.vector_space()
O = AbsoluteOrder(K, span([to_v(1), to_v(-i)], ZZ))
print O.ring_generators() == [i]  # True, so the ring generator is i, not -i.
```

However, these patches do not fix the case of `R<several letters> = ...`. For instance

```
O.<a,b> = EquationOrder([x^2+1, x^2+2])
print O.ring_generators()
```
prints `[-b*a - 1, -3*a + 2*b]` which for this patch to work should be `[a,b]`. (Incidentally, that first and confusing line is used in the docstring of `EquationOrder`. Can you get rid of that, or comment on its unexpected consequences for variables `a` and `b`?)

Changing `defining_generators` is indeed dangerous. Perhaps there could be `defining_generators.set(...)` that would
* populate the cache if it has no value,
* do nothing if the cache and the argument agree,
* populate the cache with an invalid value when the argument and the cache disagree.
The invalid value would make a call to `defining_generators` raise an exception. Also, how does the cache behaving with pickling? Does a cache override get saved?

Finally, does it make sense to define `defining_generators` in `category_object.pyx` as simply `gens()`, and put the override to `ring_generators` in `class Order`?

Pain, pain, pain. I think it's okay to pragmatically go with this approach now.

Some speculation, since my ideas keep changing about this: Perhaps the preparser should translate `a.<b> = c(d)` to `a,(b,) = c._call_and_also_return_names(d, names=('b',))`. Then `_call_and_also_return_names` gets responsible for calling `c` and making sure the returned generators are the right ones. When `c` is a function, this can be implemented using a decorator, or next to `c` itself. For classes `c`, `_call_and_also_return_names` can be a class method of `CategoryObject` which calls instantiates an object and calls `_first_n_gens` on it. This would also circumvent the hack of prepopulating and having to change the cache of `defining_generators`.

I see no reason for this additional layer of complexity. I don't know of any cached function in Sage which does this and I don't see why `defining_generators` would need it.

Yes, it gets pickled although this might be changed in #15692.

I don't really see why. Currently, `Order` is the only class with `ring_generators` but if a new class comes around implementing `ring_generators`, I guess (but this is really guessing) that it would make sense to use it as defining generators.

It seems weird if the return value of `.defining_generators` changes during an object's life. If the value gets set only once during an object's life-time (and survives pickling), then not having this additional complexity is okay. The proposal above is merely to enforce that the value does not get changed accidentally.

> > Finally, does it make sense to define `defining_generators` in `category_object.pyx` as simply `gens()`, and put the override to `ring_generators` in `class Order`?

So all other rings with generators use `gens()` for their ring generators? Why is `Order` different, especially given that there also is `basis()`?

For instance

```
R.<i> = ZZ.extension(x^2+1)
S.<x> = QQ[]

A.<a> = QQ.extension(x^2-3)
B.<b> = ZZ.extension(x^2-3)
C.<c> = R.extension(x^2-3)
D.<d> = S.extension(x^2-3)

print A.gens(), B.gens(), C.gens(), D.gens()
```
prints `(a,) [1, b] (c,) (d,)` with B.gens() being the odd one out.

I don't see how the value could get changed accidentally. And like I said: there are many cached functions in Sage, what makes this one so special?

Very good question. Unfortunately, because of the deprecation policy, we cannot just change `gens()`.

The docstring says "This is cached, so we can manually set the result if required". As such, it seems intended for the cache to contain a value that would not be the result of executing the function. (Otherwise you would not need to set it manually.) This is against the idea of a cache as an optimization that speeds up a function call by remembering the previous result.


Does the [docstring change](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/af007674767ddfd652c10fb2bd79799377dc9ffb) of `RelativeOrder.basis` affect the community's ability to change this function's behavior? It previously seemed to me that it could start returning a basis relative to the base order at any time.

Why is it okay to change `gens_dict`, but not `gens` itself?

Hack: What about reordering the result of `gens()` (or probably `basis`?) such that desired generators form a prefix? Then the syntactic sugar would work because it uses only the first `n` items.

Disregarding the change to `gen_dict()`, this makes sense to me. I would on first sight argue that `defining_generators` should not be defined for an order that has not been defined by generators, but since this is a private method used only by `R.<...>` (disregarding `gen_dict`), which moreover throws an exception if the elements are not in the order, I think it's fine here.

Taking `gen_dict()` back into the picture, I'm not so happy with its elements not necessarily generating the order anymore (as a module, or as a ring), as there is nothing in the name `gen_dict` that suggests this would not be the case. For instance

```
K.<a> = QuadraticField(-163)
R = K.ring_of_integers()
dict_gens_values = [R(x) for x in K.gens()]
S = K.order(dict_gens_values)
print S.index_in(R)
```
prints 2 instead of the expected 1.

Tangentially, `NumberField.ring_of_integers` should pass its arguments to `self.maximal_order`, in the same way that `NumberField.OK` does. (For the deprecation policy, this is probably not currently feasible, but we can deprecate non-empty arguments.) As a side-effect, this prohibits the syntax `R.<w> = K.ring_of_integers()`, in the same that `R.<w> = K.order(...)` is prohibited (which made one of my earlier points moot). This also makes the following impossible, where `w` does not become the expected generator:

```
K.<a> = QuadraticField(-163)
R.<w> = K.ring_of_integers()
w = a # Since I'm not running the version with the patch.
print K.order(w).index_in(R)  # R.<w> suggests this prints 1, but it actually prints 2.
```

I don't see why `R.<w>` *suggests* that `K.order(w) == K.ring_of_integers()`. I *do* agree that `ring_of_integers`, `OK` and `maximal_order` should all behave exactly the same.

Well, `gens_dict()` is used to extract all "variable names" (that is what the docstring says and that is how it is used in practice). Perhaps the name `gens_dict()` is badly chosen, but I would not change that now. Maybe a better name would have been `variables_dict()` or `named_elements()` or something.

If you see it this way, using `_defining_generators()` is a better choice than `gens()`.

What do you expect `w` to become in `R.<w> =`, if not a generator of `R`?

Some comments on the docstring of `_defining_names`:

* There is a test for orders, which have this method overridden, so I think it would be better to move this test.
* I'm not sure about the example "For vector spaces and free modules, we get a basis", given that submodules normalize the basis they are given as input, so that `_defining_names` does not necessarily return the basis that the submodule was defined with. For instance

  ```
V = ZZ^3
vectors = [(0,1,0), (1,3/2,0)]
M = V.span(vectors)
print M.basis()
  ```
  prints

  ```
[
(1, 1/2, 0),
(0, 1, 0)
]
  ```
  Could you mention something like this as a caveat for this method? Or perhaps get rid of this example, given that this method really only is interesting for things defined by some explicitly named elements?
* Please get rid of "generator" and perhaps mention the `names` argument used by `R.<...> =`


Otherwise, this all looks good to me.

There are already two tests for orders in `order.py`, so I don't think we need to add an additional test. I think the test in `category_object.pyx` is useful to refer to this ticket and the general discussion of `_defining_names()`.
