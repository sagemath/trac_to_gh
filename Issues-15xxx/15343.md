When importing a .rst worksheet in the notebook, the `:math:` role is not recognized. Conversely, `rst2pdf` does not understants the ` notation nor the $ notation for latex formulas, hence it is currenlty not possible to create a .rst file which can be both used as a worksheet and a pdf file.

It could be nice if the notebook (and any part of sage that uses rst) could understand the `:math:` role. I am not sure whether it is related to #13323.
