In `Graphics3d.save` sage creates a png file and then uses PIL to convert it to whatever format was requested.  But the check for whether to save another format is broken and so sage always creates a second file, even if it's just converting from png to png.

The reason for this is a broken check for the file extension:

`if ext != 'png'` should instead be `if ext != '.png'` since `ext` begins with a dot!

<a id='comment:2'></a>(new to system, so please forgive)

on line 1290 :

```
if ext == 'png'
``` 

on line 1298 :

```
if ext != 'png'
``` 

so both instances of strcmp parameters are ill formed. I would like to change both of these in my commit.
