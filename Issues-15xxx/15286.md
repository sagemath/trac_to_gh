This patch creates a file `latin_squares.py` in combinat/designs/, and implements several constructions of mutually orthogonal latin squares, as found in Douglas Stinson's book "Combinatorial Designs: Constructions and Analysis".

Hi,

Why this is not included to sage.combinat.matrix.latin_squares ? If you do not want to merge, you could at least make a reference.

- The first line in the documentation is too large (146 columns).
- line 112: "(cite theorem)" is not enough for the `ValueError` message
- optimization line 123: replace l == [] by not l
- could you put the references lines 117 and 140 that are in comments and I would like better to see them in the documentation

I will have a look at the mathematics next.

Helloooooo !!

> Why this is not included to sage.combinat.matrix.latin_squares ? If you do not want to merge, you could at least make a reference.

Because I did not know that this module existed when I wrote this one. "fortunately" they are unrelated : the `sage.combinat.matrix.latin_squares` module deals with operations specific to a given latin square, while this module builds "mutually orthogonal latin squares". I added a comment to the top of the file.

> - The first line in the documentation is too large (146 columns).

Fixed.

> - line 112: "(cite theorem)" is not enough for the `ValueError` message

`T_T`

Sorry 'bout that. It is fixed. I thought this theorem has a name, but it is just a nameless one in the references I have, so I just replaced this text by `There exist at most n-1 MOLS of size n.`. And I added a doctest.

> - optimization line 123: replace l == [] by not l

Fixed. Assuming it was `p == []`.

> - could you put the references lines 117 and 140 that are in comments and I would like better to see them in the documentation

I do not understand your sentence very well `O_o`
This being said, [Stinson2004] does appear in the documentation.

> I will have a look at the mathematics next.

Thaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaanks. I'm very very thankful fo that, 'cause I love all this designs code and there does not seem to be many design lovers among Sage's devs' `^^;`

Hellooooooooo !!

> As far as I understand, when you raise the ValueError at line 162, it means that the code does not exist. Not that the entries are not consistent, right ? (I guess this is the purpose of your Warning in the documentation). I would then prefer a NotImplementedError.

Well, it means that we have no idea whether it exists or not, and in particular that Sage cannot built it. I don't really think it matters, but I can change it if you want.

For instance, this paper was published not very long ago :
http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jcd.21384/abstract;jsessionid=6D04BFDDEA53369FE1ACDF6839FB7BD5.f01t01

So you can see what these MOLS mean : some guys are actually fighting to know the maximum order of MOLS of a given size.

> Could you give the definition of your product (in the doc) ? Note that there is also a different product in sage.combinat.matrices.latin_square called `direct_product` and needs four latin squares as entries.

`O_o`

Well, the product I use is also called a direct product in Stinson's book. Only his actually takes two latin squares of sizes `n,m` and returns a latin square of size `nxm`, which makes infinitely more sense than taking `4` squares as input with disjoints sets of symbols and concatenating them in a larger matrix. Sigh.. Combinat code..

Anyway. Done, too.

Yeah, that's one of the problems with git.. If you just checkout an old patch, you recompile everything. Well, at least now your Sage is up to date `^^;`

Yo !

Well, I was able to read the doc when I wrote this patch but I cannot build it at the moment.

```
[combinat ] building [html]: targets for 247 source files that are out of date
[combinat ] updating environment: [config changed] 255 added, 0 changed, 0 removed
[combinat ] Sphinx error:
[combinat ] 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xe2 in position 939: ordinal not in range(128)
Build finished. The built documents can be found in /home/ncohen/.Sage/src/doc/output/html/en/reference/combinat
```

This, however, is not this ticket's branch but... beta4. I get the same bug with this ticket's branch. So it has to be fixed.

Hi there,

I finally was able to build the doc !

The branch cleanly merges on 6.2.beta4. I implemented a are_mutually_orthogonal_latin_squares. It is very naive but provide a small check to your function (if there is a better way tell me !). See `u/vdelecroix/15286`

I am happy with all what you did.
