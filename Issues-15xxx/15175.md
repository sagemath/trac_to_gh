I have discovered weird behaviour while debugging a doctest in
dynamic_class.py. A minimal example looks like this:

```
$ ./sage -t src/sage/structure/dynamic_class.py
[..]
passed!
[..]
$ touch local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/structure/dynamic_class.py
$ ./sage -t src/sage/structure/dynamic_class.py
[..]
    inspect.getfile(Foo2)
Expected:
    '.../sage/structure/dynamic_class.pyc'
Got:
    '.../local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/structure/dynamic_class.py'
[..]
```

The reason is, that py_compile.compile() produces bytecode different
from what a python call silently creates (other than that, there `_seems_`
to be no difference).

Now in general, there is nothing wrong with silently generated pyc
files, so imo there shouldn't be a problem in this case.

The simplest solution would be just expecting

```
    '.../sage/structure/dynamic_class.py...',
```
instead, as this will not only pass the test, but also documents the randomness.
Is there anything else within the sage library that relies on one or the
other outcome of a getfile call?

<div id="comment:1" align="right">Comment 1</div>

There's `edit` that relies on looked up files, but it seems to not care about whether a `py` or a `pyc` gets returned.

Note, by the way, that changing anything in `local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/` is a really bad idea: those changes just get overwritten the next time the sage library is "installed" (built).

Replying to [@nbruin](#comment%3A1):
> There's `edit` that relies on looked up files, but it seems to not care about whether a `py` or a `pyc` gets returned.

So, the doctest should neither, right?

> Note, by the way, that changing anything in `local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/` is a really bad idea: those changes just get overwritten the next time the sage library is "installed" (built).

I am aware of that, this was meant to conveniently demonstrate the inconsistency.
