From the Python docs (http://docs.python.org/2/reference/datamodel.html):

//Changed in version 2.6: The double-underscore attributes !__closure!__, !__code!__, !__defaults!__, and !__globals!__ were introduced as aliases for the corresponding func_* attributes for forwards compatibility with Python 3.//

!__dict!__, !__doc!__ and !__name!__ were already available earlier.

Looking at the code with `hasattr` it should probably be manually refactored, keeping in mind that the `__XX__` are always available as alias for the `func_XX`.

Would you agree?

Actually this looks like a bug fix -- the previous version wouldn't work on Python functions/methods defined in Cython code (well they really just duck-type Python functions), since Cython doesn't include the `func_*` aliases.

The doctests just need updating to reflect the bug fix.

I did a rebase on develop to test with a fresh 6.2.beta6.

```
MAKE='make -j4' make
./sage -tp 4 --all --long >logs/sage-ptestlong-develop
All tests passed!
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Total time for all tests: 2379.2 seconds
#####
git fetch trac u/ohanar/remove_func_star:u/ohanar/remove_func_star
git co u/ohanar/remove_func_star
git co -b u/wluebbe/ticket/15983
git rebase develop
#####
./sage -b
./sage -tp 4 --all --long >logs/sage-ptestlong-15983
All tests passed!
```

My questions (as still being pretty new to Sage): 
* Is it OK to build and test as above?
* When is it necessary to do `make clean; make lib-clean; make` instead of `./sage -b`?

Replying to [wluebbe](#comment%3A14):
> I did a rebase on develop to test with a fresh 6.2.beta6.


In general, you should probably merge in the latest beta rather than rebase (this is a change from how sage use to do things to match standard git practices). That said, extra merges are unnecessary, so you should try to avoid making merges unless there is a merge conflict or an issue is only popping up on a more recent version of sage.

> My questions (as still being pretty new to Sage): 
> * Is it OK to build and test as above?


Yes, although part of a review is to look at the changes in the code and make sure you agree with them.

> * When is it necessary to do `make clean; make lib-clean; make` instead of `./sage -b`?


Use `make` if there have been upgraded packages in the distribution (so between most betas/releases), you can use `./sage -b` if the only changes between the last time you built have been to the sage library (useful if you are working on a feature branch that only touches the sage library).

Thanks for the explanation!

Next time I will try a merge when there is a merge conflict.
