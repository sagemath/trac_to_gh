` sage: CartanType(ZZ) ` 

hangs.

I suggest creating a new sage category for Cartan types
so that there is a graceful way to "type check"
something that should be a Cartan type.
Within this framework one could more explicitly codify "direct product",
"dual", "relabelled" Cartan types.

I actually get a now:

However, it is more of a fluke because `ZZ` has a well-defined `len` that doesn't just iterate over the object. However, I agree on the general premise; it is necessarily the job of the constructor to police every type of input.
