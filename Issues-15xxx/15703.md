This is a follow up to #9290.

* Experiment with the infrastructure scales and benchmark 

* CoxeterGraph, see #16126
  - Create a class similar to DynkinDiagram
    Starter: an edge-labeled graph.
  - Edge labels: m_{i,j}, possibly with number <-1 for oo
  - method dynkin_diagram() which builds the cartan matrix for the geometric representation
    Starter: just make this a function

* Update DynkinDiagram to support non crystallographic case:
  - Add an argument base_ring to the constructor
  - Add a method base_ring
  - Make add_edge honor this method when automatically adding edges
  - Update cartan_matrix() to use the base_ring
  - Add a method _test_base_ring that checks that all edge labels are
    indeed in this base ring
  - Implement is_crystallographic testing if the base ring is ZZ
  - Add an argument symmetric=False to the constructor, and make
    add_edge and symmetrizer use it.
  - Add a method _test_dynkin_diagram that tests that the Dynkin
    diagram indeed defines a proper root system. See in particular
    cartan_matrix.is_generalized_cartan_matrix.
  - adapt column() and row() method to give the labels in the base ring

  * Update CartanMatrix, see #17798
  - Add a base ring argument to the constructor
  - Update is_crystallographic
  - Update is_affine
  - Update is_finite
  - Update is_generalized_cartan_matrix

* CartanType
  - Possibly update to accept appropriate data to build a CoxeterGraph (e.g. a matrix)
  - Add a base_ring method?
  - Decide on the semantic of is_crystallographic (symmetrizable or
    not?), and if possibly add an is_... method to decide whether the
    entries are integral or not.
  - Provide a dynkin_diagram method that builds the Dynkin diagram
    from the Coxeter diagram when available
  - Test: H_3 and friends should have a working dynkin_diagram method

* RootSystem
  - Decide on the meaning of root_lattice: either disable it in the
    non integral case, or have it be the span of the roots over the
    smallest available ring.

* RootLatticeRealizations:
  - Feed this to RootSystem, and check that the root space and weight
    space are built properly.
  - Rename the weyl_group method to reflection_group, with an alias
    from weyl_group; update the setting of the category.
  - Define a new projection "transversal" to visualise root systems (and find a right name for it)
  - Long run: stuff specific to the crystallographic case, starting
    with this weyl_group method, should go in
    RootLatticeRealizations.Crystallographic. That's for a follow up
    ticket on using axioms for root systems; but let's not depend on
    #10963 right now.

* RootSpace (for this ticket or some follow up):
  - Define the inner product
  - adapt the is_positive_root to make it work for any base ring
  - Signature of the bilinear form

* CoxeterMatrixGroup and WeylGroup:
  - Refactor WeylGroup to make it a subclass of CoxeterMatrixGroup,
    and lift as many features as possible from WeylGroup to
    CoxeterMatrixGroup.
  - Check that, with a proper Dynkin diagram, the conversion to GAP
    issue does not appear
  - Now or later: we probably want the Weyl group elements to be
    represented by Sage matrices, but keep a handle to the
    corresponding Gap group. Currently one has to make a choice
    between MatrixGroup_generic and MatrixGroup_gap.

* Plotting:
  - add a family_of_points method in the projections to be used by the "transversal projection"

* Update WeylGroups:
  - inversions: use the "root_lattice" by default?


Tests:

```
  sage: C = CoxeterDiagram(...)           # good name? or CartanDatum(coxeter_matrix=...) [1] ? or?
  sage: L = RootSystem(C).root_space()
  sage: W = L.reflection_group()
  sage: W = CoxeterGroup(['H',3])
  sage: W.domain()
```
Sage Days 57 in Cernay will be a good occasion to work on this.

Follow ups: #16087

[1]: Generally speaking, it's planned to rename CartanType to CartanDatum.
