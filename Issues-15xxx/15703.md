This is a follow up to #9290.

* Experiment with the infrastructure scales and benchmark 

* CoxeterGraph, see #16126
  - Create a class similar to DynkinDiagram
    Starter: an edge-labeled graph.
  - Edge labels: m_{i,j}, possibly with number <-1 for oo
  - method dynkin_diagram() which builds the cartan matrix for the geometric representation
    Starter: just make this a function

* Update DynkinDiagram to support non crystallographic case:
  - Add an argument base_ring to the constructor
  - Add a method base_ring
  - Make add_edge honor this method when automatically adding edges
  - Update cartan_matrix() to use the base_ring
  - Add a method _test_base_ring that checks that all edge labels are
    indeed in this base ring
  - Implement is_crystallographic testing if the base ring is ZZ
  - Add an argument symmetric=False to the constructor, and make
    add_edge and symmetrizer use it.
  - Add a method _test_dynkin_diagram that tests that the Dynkin
    diagram indeed defines a proper root system. See in particular
    cartan_matrix.is_generalized_cartan_matrix.
  - adapt column() and row() method to give the labels in the base ring

  * Update CartanMatrix, see #17798
  - Add a base ring argument to the constructor
  - Update is_crystallographic
  - Update is_affine
  - Update is_finite
  - Update is_generalized_cartan_matrix

* CartanType
  - Possibly update to accept appropriate data to build a CoxeterGraph (e.g. a matrix)
  - Add a base_ring method?
  - Decide on the semantic of is_crystallographic (symmetrizable or
    not?), and if possibly add an is_... method to decide whether the
    entries are integral or not.
  - Provide a dynkin_diagram method that builds the Dynkin diagram
    from the Coxeter diagram when available
  - Test: H_3 and friends should have a working dynkin_diagram method

* RootSystem
  - Decide on the meaning of root_lattice: either disable it in the
    non integral case, or have it be the span of the roots over the
    smallest available ring.

* RootLatticeRealizations:
  - Feed this to RootSystem, and check that the root space and weight
    space are built properly.
  - Rename the weyl_group method to reflection_group, with an alias
    from weyl_group; update the setting of the category.
  - Define a new projection "transversal" to visualise root systems (and find a right name for it)
  - Long run: stuff specific to the crystallographic case, starting
    with this weyl_group method, should go in
    RootLatticeRealizations.Crystallographic. That's for a follow up
    ticket on using axioms for root systems; but let's not depend on
    #10963 right now.

* RootSpace (for this ticket or some follow up):
  - Define the inner product
  - adapt the is_positive_root to make it work for any base ring
  - Signature of the bilinear form

* CoxeterMatrixGroup and WeylGroup:
  - Refactor WeylGroup to make it a subclass of CoxeterMatrixGroup,
    and lift as many features as possible from WeylGroup to
    CoxeterMatrixGroup.
  - Check that, with a proper Dynkin diagram, the conversion to GAP
    issue does not appear
  - Now or later: we probably want the Weyl group elements to be
    represented by Sage matrices, but keep a handle to the
    corresponding Gap group. Currently one has to make a choice
    between MatrixGroup_generic and MatrixGroup_gap.

* Plotting:
  - add a family_of_points method in the projections to be used by the "transversal projection"

* Update WeylGroups:
  - inversions: use the "root_lattice" by default?


Tests:

```
  sage: C = CoxeterDiagram(...)           # good name? or CartanDatum(coxeter_matrix=...) [1] ? or?
  sage: L = RootSystem(C).root_space()
  sage: W = L.reflection_group()
  sage: W = CoxeterGroup(['H',3])
  sage: W.domain()
```
Sage Days 57 in Cernay will be a good occasion to work on this.

Follow ups: #16087

[1]: Generally speaking, it's planned to rename CartanType to CartanDatum.

-  Here is a goal picture (benchmark.png) given by the Coxeter matrix [[1,oo,2,5],[oo,1,6,2],[2,6,1,-1.1],[5,2,-1.1,1]]. It represents the limit roots of the elements of infinite order of length 3 and 4, and their orbits under the actions of elements of length smaller or equal to 5. There are 12212 drawn limits. (Not showing 66 limit roots that created approximation errors coming from a "to be looked at" usage of solve in my code). With a homemade implementation, it took 42 seconds to do the computations of everything from scratch and also the computation of the tetrahedron and the light cone.
