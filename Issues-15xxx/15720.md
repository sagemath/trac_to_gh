From Martin Raum sage-devel:

When we have a power series of infinite precision then why not print an additional `O(x^oo)`, that is `$O(x^{\infty})$`. That would, indeed, help to distinguish infinite precision power series from polynomials. It only requires a minor change in `_repr_` and `_latex_`, I suppose.

I think this is a bad idea.  I believe that, as far as is possible, Sage output should reflect standard, contemporary mathematical notation.  And I'm not sure anyone uses this notation.

Alternatively, patch the documentation to note that missing bigoh output is considered meaning infinite precision.
