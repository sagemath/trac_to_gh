From Martin Raum sage-devel:

When we have a power series of infinite precision then why not print an additional `O(x^oo)`, that is `$O(x^{\infty})$`. That would, indeed, help to distinguish infinite precision power series from polynomials. It only requires a minor change in `_repr_` and `_latex_`, I suppose.

I think this is a bad idea.  I believe that, as far as is possible, Sage output should reflect standard, contemporary mathematical notation.  And I'm not sure anyone uses this notation.

Replying to [fwclarke](#comment%3A2):

Alternatively, patch the documentation to note that missing bigoh output is considered meaning infinite precision.
