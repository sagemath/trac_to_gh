In #14615, lazy attributes became cythoned. For technical reasons, there is a Cython class doing fast stuff in the background (_lazy_attribute), but the thing that is really used is a Python class lazy_attribute inheriting from the Cython class.

The mock init method of the Cython class tried to state that only wrappers of this class should be instantiated. Unfortunately, it does not raise an error, but tries to raise the value `NotImplemented`. This is fixed in my patch.
