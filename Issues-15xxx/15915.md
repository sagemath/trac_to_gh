Hence the name. However, for that I needed to do #15976 first. I plan to go back to the samplers over the lattices once both tickets\nare merged (and I can rely on them).\n\n> Have you consider implementing other samplers? if you are looking for speed \n> Knuth-Yao is quite impressive, and if you are looking for a time-memory tradeoff the > discrete Ziggurat algorithm is nice.

I'm happy to implement more samplers, might as well be comprehensive. I was also thinking about extending the logtable approach to arbitrary Gaussian parameters sigma.\n\nAs for the interface, I guess I should check the two algorithms you mentioned above to see what would need to be generalised. If other parameters are needed in the future I can simply add another constructor which accepts those parameters, that was my thinking anyway.\n\n> I was wondering about the source of randomness.

Moreover, there are huge differences in \n> speed between the standard random c function and a secure random function, thus, for \n> testing efficiency of Gaussian samplers it is crucial to have the flexibility to \n> choose your source of randomness. For this reason, in some implementation we did, we \n> had the source of randomness as a parameter. Perhaps, you'd like to consider doing \n> that.\n\nI currently have two versions, one using GMP's randstate and one using libc. GMP should give cryptographically strong pseudorandom numbers. In my experience the difference in running time is - as you write - pretty much down to how long it takes to sample random numbers, so I figured I offer one with a good random number generator and one with a fast which is good enough for testing.",

My idea was to include the discrete Gaussian sampler over lattices (+ cosets)
into this implementation. Hence the name. However, for that I needed to do #15976 first. I plan to go back to the samplers over the lattices once both tickets
are merged (and I can rely on them).

I haven't thought about Knuth-Yao or Ziggurat, do you have any good references at hand? I'm happy to implement more samplers, might as well be comprehensive. I was also thinking about extending the logtable approach to arbitrary Gaussian parameters sigma.

As for the interface, I guess I should check the two algorithms you mentioned above to see what would need to be generalised. If other parameters are needed in the future I can simply add another constructor which accepts those parameters, that was my thinking anyway.

I currently have two versions, one using GMP's randstate and one using libc. GMP should give cryptographically strong pseudorandom numbers. In my experience the difference in running time is - as you write - pretty much down to how long it takes to sample random numbers, so I figured I offer one with a good random number generator and one with a fast which is good enough for testing.

Some comments/questions:

In the `fmpz_poly` linkage: What is the except -2 good for? Do these flint methods return -2 on error? Shouldn't you use sig_on()/sig_off() rather?

What is the reason for the following in `Polynomial_integer_dense_flint`?

```
- elif not isinstance(x, list):
-    x = [x] # constant polynomials
+ else:
+    try:
+       x = list(x)
+    except TypeError:
+       x = [x] # constant polynomials
```

In `polynomial_quotient_ring.py`, why don't you use `r"""` so you can write `\ZZ`? Also, there are now a lot of unicode characters; even though you put an encoding in the header, my vim does not understand these characters (strangely) and they also confused the patchbot.

I stopped reading at `dgs.h`. Would you mind relicensing this as GPLv2+? Should such things not be in an SPKG? I wonder if the amount of documentation is sufficient for including it directly in Sage and also if anybody can really review this (I cannot review that part I'm afraid.)

It seems you were working off the wrong branch. Your branch has 

   `polynomial_quotient_integer_dense_flint.pyx`

in it, which it shouldn't ... oh, looks like I pushed to the wrong branch at some point. Sorry, I'll fix that.

It's the standard signature of `clement_*` functions used by polynomial templates. Specifiying -2 there allows to throw exceptions in C functions. This code wasn't meant to be in this ticket, though, see above. My apologies. The code in question belonged to #16574 but has been removed.

This code wasn't meant to be in this ticket, my apologoies. It belongs in #16574. It allows `R(tuple(x))` and `R(vector(x))` to go through. 

> In `polynomial_quotient_ring.py`, why don't you use `r"""` so you can write `\ZZ`? 

I could do that, I find the other notation more straight-forward, is there a particular reason why one is preferable to the other?

> Also, there are now a lot of unicode characters; even though you put an encoding in the header, my vim does not understand these characters (strangely) and they also confused the patchbot.

I can remove them but that'd make the code less readable IMHO.
 
> I stopped reading at `dgs.h`. Would you mind relicensing this as GPLv2+? 

I have no strong feelings either way, what would be the advantage? I am quite happy with the code being BSD, it's not very sophisticated and BSD licensing it allows anyone to use it.

> Should such things not be in an SPKG? 

The C code really does only one thing, so an SPKG would be a bit of an overkill. Also, SPKG's take votes and extra bureaucracy. I'd like to avoid that, it's hard enough to get this stuff reviewed.

> I wonder if the amount of documentation is sufficient for including it directly in Sage and also if anybody can really review this (I cannot review that part I'm afraid.)

Daniel Cabarcas reviewed the C part. I can add more documentation.

This was a left-over, removed.
 
> * `self->c_r = 0.0;` after an abort() in line 114 and 130 of dgs_gaus_dp.c?

Removed.

On what kind of machine is this on? I cannot reproduce it on either 64 or 32 bit Linux.

I can reproduce those and am currenly testing a fix (some default value was machine dependent).

I should have fixed the 32-bit issues. 

I would guess these additional patches **need review** again as they are not mere documentation/doctest fixes, but changes to the code.

I set the ticket to **needs info** because the first doctest failure is still unaccounted for (see above).

The name `DiscreteGaussianIntegerSampler` might be a bit confusing to some people: at first reading it seems you're sampling from the Gaussian integers (which are discrete).

Wouldn't `DiscreteGaussianDistributionSampler` be a more descriptive name? I get the impression that Discrete Gaussian Distribution is normally used for the distributions on the integers you're referring to.

The fact that you truncate at `tau*sigma` also seems to disqualify this from legitimately being called "sampling from a discrete gaussian distribution", but I hope this is standard abuse of terminology in the field (and the difference is hard to see).

It also suggests that if the rejection rate is high (it would be for larger values of `tau`) it might be worth sampling from a binomial distribution with adapted rejection rates.

The name was chosen to allow for samplers over lattices and polynomial rings as well: `DiscreteGaussianLatticeSampler` and `DiscreteGaussianPolynomialSampler`.

I can change it to `DiscreteGaussianDistributionIntegerSampler` or something if I get a commitment that this change is reviewed in a timely fashion. This patch has had a hard time getting reviewed so I am not opening it up again lightly.

> The fact that you truncate at `tau*sigma` also seems to disqualify this from legitimately being called "sampling from a discrete gaussian distribution", but I hope this is standard abuse of terminology in the field (and the difference is hard to see).

The difference is hard to see due to the tail bound. Roughly: Pr[x <- D | |x| > C*sigma] <= 2/(C sqrt(2*pi)) * exp(-C<sup>2</sup>/2). This is also the standard approach in the literature.

> It also suggests that if the rejection rate is high (it would be for larger values of `tau`) it might be worth sampling from a binomial distribution with adapted rejection rates. The shape should be much closer to your desired distribution and hence should lead to a much lower rejection rate. It depends a bit on whether the new rejection probabilities are sufficiently easy to compute to be worth it.

Sampling from other distributions has been considered in the literature. The "sigma2+logtable" algorithm is a result of such an investigation in:
