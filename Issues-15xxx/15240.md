The goals of this ticket are:
* make the code of `LatticePolytope` less interdependent for easier maintenance and backend switch;
* use `PointCollection` container internally to unify it with other classes for toric geometry (`Cone` and `Fan`);
* deprecate current methods returning points as matrices so that their output can be changed in the future.

One of the easiest to discover change is the deprecation of the polytope-from-matrix constructor:

```
sage: LatticePolytope(identity_matrix(3))
/home/novoselt/sage.git/src/bin/sage-ipython:1: DeprecationWarning: constructing lattice polytopes from matrices is deprecated!
See http://trac.sagemath.org/15240 for details.
  #!/usr/bin/env python
2-d lattice polytope in 3-d lattice M
```
To get the same result without the deprecation warning one has to do

```
sage: LatticePolytope(identity_matrix(3).columns())
```

In most cases users had to pack points into a column matrix and then
call the lattice polytope constructor. Now they can just omit the packing step.

Note that matrices will eventually be accepted again as valid input
since they are "iterables of iterables", but **rows** of a matrix will
be viewed as points, not **columns**.

What about "desc"? I'd like to print polytopes similar to cones/fans: "3-d lattice polytope in 4-d lattice N", perhaps with "lattice" replaced by "reflexive" automatically and with the index for 2- and 3-d cases. Should then "desc" be gone and those who really want can use Sage standard "rename"?

`projective_space` and `octahedron(2)` better disappear as well, not sure how did I come up with "octa" for vertices other than 8!

Sounds good!

> What about "desc"?

+1

> Also, I am not sure what the output of "normal_form" should be - keeping it as a matrix does not seem a good choice.


A matrix isn't totally strange, after all the normal form is a version of hermite normal form together with permutation of vertices.

If you want to return it as another `LatticePolytope` then the constructor should keep the vertices in the specified order. The ambient lattice should be the same as the lattice of the original polytope, imho.

> `projective_space` and `octahedron(2)` better disappear as well, not sure how did I come up with "octa" for vertices other than 8!


Should probably be `cross_polytope` ;-)

I always want to preserve order, especially when the input consists of vertices rather than spanning points ;-) The issue with the same lattice as the original one is that normal forms of equivalent polytopes in different lattices will compare as different, which seems a bit counterintuitive with respect to index, i.e. with my default lattice choice we would have for any 2- or 3-d reflexive polytope

```
sage: p.normal_form() == ReflexivePolytope(p.dim(), p.index())
True
```
On the other hand starting with a polytope in N and getting as its normal form something in M isn't great either... So maybe a matrix is the way to go. Perhaps with vertices as rows rather than columns?

Speaking of `index` - are you OK with the name or something like `db_index` would be better? I definitely find it very useful, but the meaning of `index` for morphisms and cones is completely different and there are "more mathematical" indices associated to polytopes, like Gorenstein one.

Do you mind editing the ticket description so that users can easily find what's the current alternative to constructing lattice polytopes from a matrix?

Thanks!
