This is weird and bad:

```
sage: x = polygen(ZpFM(3,10))
sage: p = ((x-1)^50 + x)._pari_init_()
sage: %time pari(p).poldisc()
CPU times: user 52.73 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 52.73 s
Wall time: 52.82 s
2*3 + 3^4 + 2*3^6 + 3^7 + 2*3^8 + 2*3^9 + O(3^10)
sage: pari.allocatemem(2<<20)
PARI stack size set to 2097152 bytes
sage: %time pari(p).poldisc()

We could *detect* the problem by adding some code to `gerepile...()` to count the number of garbage collections. We could for example give a warning if more than N happen per second (for a suitable value of N).
