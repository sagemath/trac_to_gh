This is weird and bad:

```
sage: x = polygen(ZpFM(3,10))
sage: p = ((x-1)^50 + x)._pari_init_()
sage: %time pari(p).poldisc()
CPU times: user 52.73 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 52.73 s
Wall time: 52.82 s
2*3 + 3^4 + 2*3^6 + 3^7 + 2*3^8 + 2*3^9 + O(3^10)
sage: pari.allocatemem(2<<20)
PARI stack size set to 2097152 bytes
sage: %time pari(p).poldisc()
CPU times: user 0.08 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.08 s
Wall time: 0.08 s
2*3 + 3^4 + 2*3^6 + 3^7 + 2*3^8 + 2*3^9 + O(3^10)
```

I'm fine with this change.  I'm not yet familiar with reviewing SPKG changes using the new directory layout.  Why is SPKG.txt deleted in this commit?

More generally, are there other places in Sage where we should be more aggressive about increasing the Pari stack size?
