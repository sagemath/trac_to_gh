This should do the trick for `WeakValueDictionary`. Merge #15367 to get the same benefit for `MonoDict` and `TripleDict`.

Code that verifies the problem has been solved:

```
sage: class A: pass
sage: from sage.misc.weak_dict import WeakValueDictionary
sage: a=A(); prev=a;
sage: M=WeakValueDictionary()
sage: for i in range(10^3+10): newA = A(); M[newA] = prev; prev = newA
sage: del a
```
This used to fail, but with the code on this branch it works.

OK, so, it is a bug in the plugins.

And now I am really confused.

In #15432, you introduce a weak reference from the callback to the weak value dictionary. Namely, on #15432, you point out that when passing the weak value dictionary to the callback via a closure then there are examples requiring many garbage collections to clear a weak value dictionary.

Now, you revert this change. Can you explain why you did so? Doesn't this re-introduce the problem that you fixed in #15432? If not: Why not? And why did you merge #15432 into this branch? What is left from #15432 in the HEAD of this branch?

I figured that this was the new way to express a "dependency" on another ticket. It results in the branch I would have ended up with if I had started this ticket based on the branch there.

Then perhaps I was misreading what trac showed me as diff.

I now took #15432, merged with master, and compare it with the branch from here, merged with master.

These are the differences I see with `git diff ticket/15432 ticket/15506`:

- You put certain to-be-deleted things into tuples, in order to use Python's trashcan.
- You *remove* the `_IterationContext` and replace it by cdef methods. So, instead of a context, you have `try: self._enter_iter() ... finally: self._exit_iter()`. I suppose that's for speed.

So, are these the changes I have to review here?

Best regards,
Simon
