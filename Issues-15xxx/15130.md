I've tripped over this multiple times, too. This is due to circular imports in the matroid code. For example:

```

Depending on initialization order, importing matroids can fail. So if you delete `doc/output` and then run `make doc`, it works. But if some docs have been cached then the import order changes and *BOOM*. This is really bad. Python lets you get away with circular imports to some extend, but not forever. 

The matroid guys should linearize their imports, thats the only long-term solution.

Btw, here is a quick tutorial to debug this. Use the `-v` switch to display imports as they happen:

```
sage -python -v
>>> from sage.all import *
>>> from sage.matroids.basis_exchange_matroid import BasisExchangeMatroid
dlopen("/home/vbraun/Code/sage.git/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/matroids/basis_exchange_matroid.so", 2);
dlopen("/home/vbraun/Code/sage.git/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/matroids/matroid.so", 2);
dlopen("/home/vbraun/Code/sage.git/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/matroids/set_system.so", 2);
import sage.matroids.set_system # dynamically loaded from /home/vbraun/Code/sage.git/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/matroids/set_system.so
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "basis_exchange_matroid.pyx", line 1, in init sage.matroids.basis_exchange_matroid (sage/matroids/basis_exchange_matroid.c:20420)
  File "basis_exchange_matroid.pxd", line 8, in init sage.matroids.matroid (sage/matroids/matroid.c:33184)
AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'BasisExchangeMatroid'
```
So matroid imports from basis_exchange_matroid and vice versa. Which is bad. Circular imports are no magic, they just require Python to work with half-initialized module dicts. So while basis_exchange_matroid is loading, the `BasisExchangeMatroid` is not in the module namespace.

Let me explain the reason for those circular imports.

We have an abstract class Matroid with default implementations for nearly every method. For some of those, we return a subclass such as MinorMatroid or DualMatroid; for others (like is_isomorphic()) we convert to a BasisMatroid and use its implementation.

The class BasisMatroid is a subclass of BasisExchangeMatroid, which subclasses Matroid.

If you know of a way to get this functionality without circular imports, I'm all ears!

Obviously, the file containing the base must never import the derived at module level. 

You can import the derived class at method scope. Those imports are resolved only when you call the method.

On the other hand, this is more of a developer issue than an end-user issue, so I think it's not that urgent.
