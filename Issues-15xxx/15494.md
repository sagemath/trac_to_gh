From the documentation (`Graph.get_boundary?` or `Graph.set_boundary?`) there is just no way to know what it does. So because of that probably nobody uses it. Or they guessed the purpose in some way I can't guess myself.

Then there are things like linear-time operations in functions like `.delete_vertex` (noticed by #15278).

```
self._boundary = [v for v in self._boundary if v != vertex]
```

Sooooooooo unless somebody complains and is willing to write some documentation for this parameter, I think it'd be nice to deprecate then remove it.

Hello Nathann,

you should replace all the new `doctest:1:` (or any other number) by `doctest:...:` because the numbers will change all the time.
