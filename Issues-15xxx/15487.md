[This sage-support post](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/sage-support/lpqzCOja6kg/lWVdmInFa8gJ) points out that our error message isn't very helpful when trying to use matrices in symbolic expressions.

```
sage: P=x^2                                       
sage: P(x=4)                                      
16
sage: M=matrix([(1, -3, -1),(0, 1, 1),(-1, 2, 1)])
sage: P(x=M)                           
<boom that doesn't tell you do use polynomial rings>
```
Let's improve this.  If we can even get this to work properly (no boom) that would be even better.

There's really no reason not to fix this if we can.  It seems to really be a coercion question.
