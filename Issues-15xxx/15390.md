Based on #14990 we implement root computations in the algebraic closure of finite fields.

It should be nice to also adapt eigenvectors... (but we need before algebraic conjugates)

Currently finite subfields of an algebraic closure can not talk to each other (see in particular #16509). But hopefully, it is possible to compute roots without it!

Hello,

Needs review!

I will not do eigenspaces since it needs the implementation of algebraic conjugates... for another ticket.

It is rather independent of that ticket. As soon as you make work the embeddings of finite fields into algebraic closures, then there will be nothing to change in my code to make the roots and eigenvalues work.

EDIT: For the algebraic closure itself... I will have a look.

Ok. I had a look and the reason is because the inclusions are only implemented between the subfields:

```
sage: K = GF(5).algebraic_closure()
sage: K2, phi2 = K.subfield(2)
sage: K4, phi4 = K.subfield(4)
sage: z2 = K2.gen()
sage: K4(z2)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: unable to coerce from a finite field other than the prime subfield
```
But the following works

```
sage: f24 = K.inclusion(2,4)
sage: f24(K2.gen())
z4^3 + z4^2 + z4 + 3
```

I will at least fix the `_roots_univariate_polynomial` using the inclusion morphism.

Since you are computing a factorization to get the roots, wouldn't it make more sense to go the other way around?. That is, write a complicated method that computes the factorization, and then just call it to get the roots.

It seems that what you ar doing is computing the factorization to get the roots, and then use the roots to compute the factorization.

Hey

The two things are equivalent in an algebraically closed field, right? And from the coding point of view, it is more natural the other way around. If you look at the part of the code which actually does the computation, I do not see where it looks more like a factorisation rather than a computation of roots

```
roots = [] # a list of pair (root,multiplicity)
for g,m in P(new_coeffs).factor():
    if g.degree() == 1:
        r = phi(-g.constant_coefficient())
        roots.append((r,m))
    else:
        ll = l * g.degree()
        psi = self.inclusion(l, ll)
        FF, pphi = self.subfield(ll)
        gg = PolynomialRing(FF, 'x')(map(psi, g))
        for r,_ in gg.roots(): # note: we know that multiplicity is 1
                roots.append((pphi(r),m))
```

If you have an alternative proposition, propose it, but I really do not see what you mean. The only `factor` which appears above is over the field where are defined the coefficients.

I do not prefer it this way, I just do not see how to do the other way around. If you know and think it is better, please provide a branch.

> Just check the commas (some of them don't have a space after, but they should).

Why do they should?! These are just coding conventions and I do prefer
`for i,j,k in my_list` rather than `for i, j, k in my_list`. But as you saw I did it.
