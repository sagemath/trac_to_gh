Aha. This is about a function that returns

```
        from sage.graphs.graph import Graph
        G = Graph(self.hasse_diagram())
        return G
```
I suppose this should be

```
        from sage.graphs.graph import Graph
        return Graph(self.hasse_diagram(), immutable=True)
```
instead. The fact that the doctest is about hash shows that we want an immutable graph.

In a second commit, I re-introduced it. Well, the joy of git. I don't dare to amend the merge commit and rather add an ugly second commit on top of a wrong first commit `:-P`

At least one of the failing doctests is now working. So, needs review again, and since I am the reviewer, I suppose I can revert to positive review as soon as `make ptest` passes for me!
