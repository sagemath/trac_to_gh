I don't follow.  Even if a branch has several tickets it ends up closing, each individual commit should surely be connected (if only morally) to a given ticket?  If a ticket is closed as not valid because a later one subsumes it, that is fine - the later one is the ticket.  If this isn't possible in the new workflow, at the very least one could go back to the (quite successful, at the time) policy of asking everyone to put the ticket # in the commit message.  This seems very reasonable and we already did it.

And now `git trac` becomes almost necessary, which is sort of unfortunate.

This is even more confusing.  In fact, it's commit 15d89e9.

I get that there is this nonlinear structure.  But that means the ticket #s are more important, not less, because `git log` is pretty useless for trying to figure order out (bisecting) and it would be nice not to have to be a git expert to find out what caused a problem.

Anyway, you also shouldn't have to be a git expert - or to have to guess about `git trac find` since [the developer guide section on git trac doesn't have it](http://sagemath.org/doc/developer/git_trac.html#chapter-git-trac) - in order to guess the ticket.

Nor to guess the version of Sage a given 'ticket' is merged in!  Since Jeroen automated these things, I can't see why it is so horrible to try them again... but I suppose I don't have much chance of prevailing here.

Yes, but you can only tell for sure after everything is merged. E.g. you make a commit, then discover that ticket is duplicate of another one. Or you might start writing code without a ticket open at all, and only later decide to contribute it.
