See this [sage-devel discussion](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/Gnw389Bd-0k/bqprN5AxtK8J).

Sage has a very nice feature where it tries to not print all entries of a large matrix:

```
sage: A=matrix(20,20,[2]*400)
sage: A
20 x 20 dense matrix over Integer Ring (type 'print A.str()' to see all of the entries)
```
But, as you see, Sage has to do some magic to know that `A` refers to the matrix in question. Indeed, in other situations it won't find a useful name:

```
sage: B=A
sage: A
20 x 20 dense matrix over Integer Ring (type 'print obj.str()' to see all of the entries)
```
The process of finding a name consists of trawling through all "globals" dictionaries on the call stack. This is an incredibly expensive operation which also breaks python's programming model: reverse lookups of bindings are not part of the language specification.

The main concern here is that string representations may not actually make it to an output stream: they may be part of a (perhaps poorly constructed) exception message that gets caught. Fixing the exception message may not be an option, since some of these happen internally in python. TO illustrate the dramatic effect, consider:

```
sage: def t(depth,N,n):
....:         if depth:
....:                 return t(depth-1,N,n)
....:         else:
....:                 G = matrix([[2 for u in range(N)] for v in range(N)])
....:                 for i in range(n):
....:                         _=repr(G)
```
Trying it with a flat call stack is already showing that the repr of a 20x20 matrix is much more expensive to produce than for a 19x19 matrix (a factor 80):

```             
sage: timeit('t(0,19,10)')
125 loops, best of 3: 2.14 ms per loop
sage: timeit('t(0,20,10)')
5 loops, best of 3: 172 ms per loop
```
With a deep call stack this gets even more pronounced:

```
sage: sage: timeit('t(100,19,10)') 
125 loops, best of 3: 2.22 ms per loop
sage: timeit('t(100,20,10)') 
5 loops, best of 3: 5.45 s per loop
```

Most of the doctest failures outside of `matrix0.pyx` are of the form

```
Expected:
    Vector space of degree 20 and dimension 20 over Rational Field
    Basis matrix:
    20 x 20 dense matrix over Rational Field
Got:
    Vector space of degree 20 and dimension 20 over Rational Field
    Basis matrix:
    20 x 20 dense matrix over Rational Field (type '<matrix>.str()' to see all of the entries)
```
which suggests that not including a message about `.str()` may be more appropriate.

**A wild thought:** If people feel saying something about `.str()` is really necessary for output printed by the IPython REPL or notebook output, perhaps we should put in a hook on those to do a name lookup in `globals` there. In that case, we'd still get

```
sage: A = <large matrix>
sage: A
* x * matrix over * (type 'print A.str()' to see all entries)
```
but this would happen because TOP LEVEL recognizes it's printing a string representation that may not fully reflect the value. Certainly, TOP LEVEL looking in globals() wouldn't be so bad, AND it wouldn't need to look in stack frames to find what globals dictionary is appropriate.

My 2 cents.

1. I like that large matrices do not get printed entirely without being requested explicitly.
2. Even with a helpful message, I see students who wonder why they do not get the whole matrix.  So I would rather not see the bare output

```
20 x 20 dense matrix over Rational Field
```
3.  I think it is less important to see the actual name of the matrix parroted in the output (the source of the inefficiency here).  So something like the following would be sufficient in my eyes, if it was easier to code/maintain:

```
20 x 20 dense matrix over Rational Field (use the '.str()' method to see all of the entries)
```

Thanks for cleaning this up.

I think that's appropriate.\n- Since the print hook of the interface is the routine that appends the message, a straight print statement never included the tip either\n- If the value itself is a matrix then the tip is included according to the rules that applied before.\n\nI think this is preferable to the old behaviour because\n- we're losing the inefficiency in most string productions\n- the tip is often annoying in list printing. That matrices are abbreviated in a list environment is understandable, I think. People will naturally try to look at the matrix itself if they are interested in the value.\n- we're still getting the tip in most cases where it's likely to be useful.\n\nWe can implement Beezer's static suggestion in the displayhook, which will be more efficient (although that is not so important) and more appropriate. In that case we would get:\n\n```\nsage: L=[matrix(20,20,[2]*400)]\nsage: L\n[20 x 20 dense matrix over Integer Ring]\nsage: L[0]\n20 x 20 dense matrix over Integer Ring (use the '.str()' method to see the entries)\nsage: A=L[0]\nsage: L[0]\n20 x 20 dense matrix over Integer Ring (use the '.str()' method to see the entries)\nsage: print L[0]\n20 x 20 dense matrix over Integer Ring\n```\n\nI think this is the best solution, because:\n- It provides a useful tip consistently in a minimal case: when a matrix value is returned that gets printed in abbreviated form.\n- It provides a tip that's always correct, regardless of what bindings exist (and indeed, what bindings exist is immaterial for the problem that the user is facing)\n- We won't be digging around in the globals or the call stack without explicitly being asked to do so.\n\nSo should we go for that then?\n\nIncidentally, I think `.str()` is an awful name for this method. The fact that `str(M)` and `M.str()` do similar but different things is a horrible trap. Also, `.str` and `.__str__` are too similar to both exist but be different. I don't have a direct alternative in mind, nor the inclination to follow through on the horrible deprecation process that would be required to remove this wart, though.",

Thanks for the feedback.

**UNPATCHED BEHAVIOUR:**

```
sage: L=[matrix(20,20,[2]*400)]
sage: L
[20 x 20 dense matrix over Integer Ring]
sage: A=L[0]
sage: L
[20 x 20 dense matrix over Integer Ring (type 'print A.str()' to see all of the entries)]
sage: B=L[0]
sage: L
[20 x 20 dense matrix over Integer Ring (type 'print obj.str()' to see all of the entries)]
```
where you can see:
- No printing tip if no direct binding is found
- Printing of an explicit name if a unique direct binding is found
- Printing of a generic `obj` name designator if more than one direct binding was found.

This all with an excessively verbose:

```
sage: L=[matrix(20,20,[2]*400)]*10
sage: A=L[0]
sage: L
[20 x 20 dense matrix over Integer Ring (type 'print A.str()' to see all of the entries),

 20 x 20 dense matrix over Integer Ring (type 'print A.str()' to see all of the entries)]
```

**WITH THE PATCH:**

```
sage: L=[matrix(20,20,[2]*400)]
sage: L
[20 x 20 dense matrix over Integer Ring]
sage: A=L[0]
sage: print A
20 x 20 dense matrix over Integer Ring
sage: A
20 x 20 dense matrix over Integer Ring (type 'print A.str()' to see all of the entries)
sage: L
[20 x 20 dense matrix over Integer Ring]
sage: L[0]
20 x 20 dense matrix over Integer Ring (type 'print A.str()' to see all of the entries)
sage: B=L[0]
sage: L
[20 x 20 dense matrix over Integer Ring]
sage: L[0]
20 x 20 dense matrix over Integer Ring (type 'print obj.str()' to see all of the entries)
```

Thus:
- If the value returned is not a matrix itself (but for instance, a list with matrices in it), no tip is printed. I think that's appropriate.
- Since the print hook of the interface is the routine that appends the message, a straight print statement never included the tip either
- If the value itself is a matrix then the tip is included according to the rules that applied before.

I think this is preferable to the old behaviour because
- we're losing the inefficiency in most string productions
- the tip is often annoying in list printing. That matrices are abbreviated in a list environment is understandable, I think. People will naturally try to look at the matrix itself if they are interested in the value.
- we're still getting the tip in most cases where it's likely to be useful.

We can implement Beezer's static suggestion in the displayhook, which will be more efficient (although that is not so important) and more appropriate. In that case we would get:

```
sage: L=[matrix(20,20,[2]*400)]
sage: L
[20 x 20 dense matrix over Integer Ring]
sage: L[0]
20 x 20 dense matrix over Integer Ring (use the '.str()' method to see the entries)
sage: A=L[0]
sage: L[0]
20 x 20 dense matrix over Integer Ring (use the '.str()' method to see the entries)
sage: print L[0]
20 x 20 dense matrix over Integer Ring
```

I think this is the best solution, because:
- It provides a useful tip consistently in a minimal case: when a matrix value is returned that gets printed in abbreviated form.
- It provides a tip that's always correct, regardless of what bindings exist (and indeed, what bindings exist is immaterial for the problem that the user is facing)
- We won't be digging around in the globals or the call stack without explicitly being asked to do so.

So should we go for that then?

Incidentally, I think `.str()` is an awful name for this method. The fact that `str(M)` and `M.str()` do similar but different things is a horrible trap. Also, `.str` and `.__str__` are too similar to both exist but be different. I don't have a direct alternative in mind, nor the inclination to follow through on the horrible deprecation process that would be required to remove this wart, though.

There is. This was carefully argued, see comment [comment:8]. I'll repeat the (slightly modified) example here for your convenience:

```
sage: L=[matrix(20,20,[2]*400) for i in range(3)]
sage: L
[20 x 20 dense matrix over Integer Ring,
20 x 20 dense matrix over Integer Ring,
20 x 20 dense matrix over Integer Ring]
```
It's annoying and not useful to include the '.str()' message with each of these.

The rest of the examples gives an idea of the balance that is struck by handling the message in displayhook, which Rob and I decided on as the most desirable behaviour.

```
sage: L[0]
20 x 20 dense matrix over Integer Ring (use the '.str()' method to see the entries)
sage: A=L[0]
sage: L[0]
20 x 20 dense matrix over Integer Ring (use the '.str()' method to see the entries)
sage: print L[0]
20 x 20 dense matrix over Integer Ring
```

Setting back to "needs review"--Volker, would you set it back to positive if this satisfies your concern? If you want the annoying message all the time, go for it, but you'll be changing a LOT more doctests. This behaviour turned out to be much closer to what we already had.

If you want to achieve that, how about introducing a special method `_repr_help()`, say, whose output will be appended in the displayhook if that object is the top-level output. That would give us an extensible mechanism and keep the declaration of the representation in the matrix module. 


I agree that refactoring is worth doing if we have more cases (and will be easy). Currently, the only objects this would appy to would be matrices and lists, and we can't reach into lists to implement the protocol there. For now we'd be designing and implementing a protocol to use *once*.

(Conceptually, it is `DisplayHook` that should provide the hint: the object is simply giving a compact representation. It's not its task to provide help. The top-level interface is the right place to decide to provide help. Once we have more than one object requiring this, it starts making sense to implement this by letting the `DisplayHook` ask the object for a "more helpful" string representation.)

I don't think you based your branch on the branch from comment [comment:27]. I had to move the

```
from sage.matrix.matrix import is_Matrix
```
to inside `simple_format_obj` because otherwise Sage won't start for me: the IPython crash report has a long traceback, showing that somewhere along the line, that import statement fails because the name `ZZ` isn't available (yet).

This problem only arises with interactive use (and I guess in doctests that test sage via an expect interface and hence running with IPython). It would be surprising, but not impossible, if you're not experiencing this problem (in which case import resolutions aren't deterministic), but the fact that the problematic situation can arise means we need to fix it. The relevant (two line) change is at the bottom of [https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/d41816c57ede520353ed24ea9534c1219137d295](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/d41816c57ede520353ed24ea9534c1219137d295).

Good point. That's probably an easier solution (at least to write and understand) And it resolves completely on the first execution.
