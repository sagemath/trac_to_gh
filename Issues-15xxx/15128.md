Add a method called structure_description to permutation groups that wraps the educational GAP method StructureDescription. There is also an option for LaTeX formatted string.

The full GAP documentation for this method is at [http://www.gap-system.org/Manuals/doc/ref/chap39_mj.html#X87BF1B887C91CA2E](http://www.gap-system.org/Manuals/doc/ref/chap39_mj.html#X87BF1B887C91CA2E)

This requires the small groups library which is optional due to licensing problems. The doctests need to be marked as `# optional - database_gap`, I think.

Hellooooooooo !!

I converted this patch to a git patch, and appended some modifications for the doc. I also added a couple of line to handle the latex version of the different outputs as given on http://www.gap-system.org/Manuals/doc/ref/chap39.html. You can set the patch to `positive_review` if you agree with these modifications `:-)`
