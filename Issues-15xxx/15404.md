```
As written currently, the coprime_integers(n) method in the Integer class uses gcd naively:

```
    def coprime_integers(self, m):
        ...
        v = []
        for n in range(1,m):
            if self.gcd(n) == 1:
                v.append(Integer(n))
        return v
```

This method should be rewritten to use sieving to speed things up.

New patch replaces previous patch. The method now uses naive gcd if both self and m are < 1000, since this seems to be faster.

Some timings. Old code:

```
sage: %timeit 100.coprime_integers(100)
10000 loops, best of 3: 44.5 us per loop
sage: %timeit 101.coprime_integers(101)
10000 loops, best of 3: 52.6 us per loop
sage: %timeit 1000.coprime_integers(1000)
1000 loops, best of 3: 529 us per loop
sage: %timeit (10^6+12).coprime_integers(10^6+12)
1 loops, best of 3: 603 ms per loop
sage: %timeit (next_prime(10^6)).coprime_integers(10^6)
1 loops, best of 3: 795 ms per loop
sage: %timeit (10^8+512).coprime_integers(10^5)
10 loops, best of 3: 55.9 ms per loop
sage: %timeit (10^8+512).coprime_integers(10^7)
1 loops, best of 3: 5.61 s per loop
```

New code (without naive method for small inputs):

```
sage: %timeit 100.coprime_integers(100)
10000 loops, best of 3: 145 us per loop
sage: %timeit 101.coprime_integers(101)
10000 loops, best of 3: 139 us per loop
sage: %timeit 1000.coprime_integers(1000)
1000 loops, best of 3: 510 us per loop
sage: %timeit (10^6+12).coprime_integers(10^6+12)
1 loops, best of 3: 373 ms per loop
sage: %timeit (next_prime(10^6)).coprime_integers(10^6)
1 loops, best of 3: 383 ms per loop
sage: %timeit (10^8+512).coprime_integers(10^5)
10 loops, best of 3: 39.8 ms per loop
sage: %timeit (10^8+512).coprime_integers(10^7)
1 loops, best of 3: 3.98 s per loop
#MemoryError for m=10^8
```

The new code should be faster when self has few prime factors, but both old and new code scale with m, the bound to which integers coprime to self are returned, since we need to fit that many sage integers in memory.

I've written a new implementation that fixes some problems with the old and speeds it up:

* It now handles the case that `self = 0` or negative and that `m` is too large or negative gracefully
* It uses `trial_division()` rather than `prime_divisors()`, which will be faster and deals with the case that `self` has prime factors larger than `m` better.
* It uses bit fiddling rather than a list of booleans.

Just my 2 cents: `mpz_divexact_ui` is expected to be faster than `mpz_fdiv_q`, and `mpz_sgn` instead of comparing to zero.
Also as you have `plong` available (why not unsigned?), it's probably better to use `mpz_cmp_si` and `mpz_divisible_ui_p`.

All this is nitpicking though.

Hum, 

```sage
p = slf.trial_division(mlong, mpz_get_si(p.value)+1)
ilong = plong = mpz_get_ui(p.value)
```
this might be problematic if `p` is set to `slf` and doesn't fit in a long.

If moreover `plong` end up being `1`, the `while mpz_divisible_ui_p(slf.value, plong):` loop will be infinite.

That can't happen since `trial_division` only goes up to the bound `mlong`.
