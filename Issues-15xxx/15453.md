In `devel/sage/sage/matrix/matrix_integer_dense.pyx`, wrap IML calls in `_solve_iml()` in `sig_on()`/`sig_off()`.

The patch also changes the exception type for non-square matrices from `ArithmeticError` to `ValueError`, since that's just a limitation of the implementation, it's not a mathematical obstruction.
