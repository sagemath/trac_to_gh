Some members were removed from the `types` module in Python 3. 
Replace the deprecated members by their modern equivalents.

```
  'BooleanType' : 'bool',
  'BufferType' : 'memoryview',
  'ClassType' : 'type',
  'ComplexType' : 'complex',
  'DictType': 'dict',
  'DictionaryType' : 'dict',
  'EllipsisType' : 'type(Ellipsis)',
  'FloatType': 'float',
  'IntType': 'int',
  'ListType': 'list',
  'LongType': 'int',
  'ObjectType' : 'object',
  'NoneType': 'type(None)',
  'NotImplementedType' : 'type(NotImplemented)',
  'SliceType' : 'slice',

<a id='comment:2'>Comment 2:</a>
There is a Python ticket [2to3 doesn't convert 'types.InstanceType' to 'object'](http://bugs.python.org/issue8206).

The recommendation seems to be

```
or add

try:
  from types import InstanceType
except ImportError:
  InstanceType = object

to the top of the module; this would then work for both 2.x and 3.x (assuming that replacing InstanceType with object is actually correct in the code in question).
```

It needs work on the failing doctests.

The failing tests seem all to be concerned with *old style classes*. Python 3 has only *new style classes*. 

Maybe there are no more old style classes in Sage - and those tests might be removed??

Is there somebody familiar with `src/sage/misc/explain_pickle.py` who can comment?

There are plenty of old style classes in Sage. A lot of the codebase is ancient and has not received much attention in years. I don't know the module at all, so I can't really help here.
