There is a Python ticket [2to3 doesn't convert 'types.InstanceType' to 'object'](http://bugs.python.org/issue8206).

The recommendation seems to be

```
or add

try:
  from types import InstanceType
except ImportError:
  InstanceType = object

to the top of the module; this would then work for both 2.x and 3.x (assuming that replacing InstanceType with object is actually correct in the code in question).
```

It needs work on the failing doctests.

The failing tests seem all to be concerned with //old style classes//. Python 3 has only //new style classes//. 

Maybe there are no more old style classes in Sage - and those tests might be removed??

Is there somebody familiar with `src/sage/misc/explain_pickle.py` who can comment?
