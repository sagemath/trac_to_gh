A TypeError occurring in the callback function `sage.combinat.finite_state_machine.FiniteStateMachine.add_from_transition_function`
is incorrectly caught and leads to a misleading ValueError.
   
Old behaviour:

   ```
   sage: def transition(state, where):
   sage: ...    return (vector([0,0]),1)
   sage: Transducer(transition, input_alphabet=[0], initial_states=[0])
   Traceback (click to the left of this block for traceback)
   ...
   ValueError: The callback function for add_from_transition is expected to
   return a pair (new_state, output_label) or a list of such pairs. For the
   state 0 and the input letter 0, it however returned [((0, 0), 1)], which
   is not acceptable.
   ```
   
New behaviour:

   ``` 
   sage: def transition(state, where):
   sage: ...    return (vector([0,0]),1)
   sage: Transducer(transition, input_alphabet=[0], initial_states=[0])
   Traceback (click to the left of this block for traceback)
   ...
   TypeError: mutable vectors are unhashable
   ```
