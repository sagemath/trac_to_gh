One consequence is to allow Cython's OpenMP facilities, see #12690.

While we're at it, do lots of clean-up of signal/error handling after #9640 and friends:
- use `sig_error()` for NTL and libGAP
- remove the old `_sig_on` macros which are deprecated since 3 years

Follow-up at #15543: update documentation
