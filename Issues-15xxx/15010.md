Make the var parameter of `Rational.minpoly()` default to `'x'`, for consistency with `NumberFieldElement.minpoly()`. (This is important since `is_NumberField(QQ) == True`.)

I'm wondering if `minpoly()` shouldn't actually just be moved to `FieldElement`. Thoughts?

<a id='comment:2'></a>I don't know why this is tagged "needs review" when there is no patch.

I would support changing

```
   def minpoly(self, var):
```
to

```
   def minpoly(self, var='x'):
```
for consistency with number fields.

How would it work to move this to FieldElement?   To be well-defined you would have to know a subfield over which the element was algebraic, and that will not always exist.

So let's just make the trivial change here (and add a doctest of course).
