As prompted by http://ask.sagemath.org/question/3410, this ticket is meant for discussion to improve the documentation of the `constraint_generation` option of MixedIntegerLinearProgramming.

From the ref: http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/numerical/sage/numerical/mip.html:

> constraint_generation – whether to require the returned solver to support constraint generation (excludes Coin). False by default.


From the source: https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/master/src/sage/numerical/backends/generic_backend.pyx#L983:

>  - `constraint_generation` (boolean) -- whether the solver returned is to be used for constraint/variable generation. As the interface with Coin does not support constraint/variable generation, setting `constraint_generation` to `False` ensures that the backend to Coin is not returned when `solver = None`. This is set to `False` by default.


First issue: in the source the phrase “setting `constraint_generation` to `False` ensures that the backend to Coin is not returned when `solver = None`” seems incorrect, as setting `constraint_generation` to `False` is meant to *allow* selection of Coin.

Second issue: upon first reading the ref and source documentation, I understood that Coin would not be selected if `constraint_generation` were set to `True`, but not what was exactly meant by ‘constraint generation’ in the context of the module. I thought it would enable passing a constraint generator. Now I understand that constraint generation means: after a first call `solve()`, one or more constraints is added to the solved instance, and then `solve()` is called again. Perhaps the documentation should be changed to make this clearer.

Of course. Perhaps we keep this ticket open after issue 1 is fixed to allow me to provide the changed lines if I get around to it in the future.

You forced my hand:

https://github.com/equaeghe/sage/compare/patch-2

Do I create pull requests for these, or what is the preferred workflow?

Hellooooooo !!

> You forced my hand:


Ahahah. Well, wasn't the only alternative for me to rewrite a doc that I already find clear ? `:-P`

> Do I create pull requests for these, or what is the preferred workflow?


Well, depending how you are used to git, the workflow is more or less simple :
- Get the Trac server to know your public ssh key
- Modify Sage's source code, and upload the commits as a branch
- Change the "branch" field of this ticket if it is not done automatically.

It is all explained there [1], and I can help with any specific question you have if it isn't clear. And we will update the developper's documentation if something isn't clear, too `^^;`

By the way, your changes as I see them are not correct : When `constraint_generation` is set to `False`, it may very well be that the solver returned does supports constraint generation. That will actually happen whenever Coin is not installed on the machine.

And I don't know if it is a good idea to mention Coin explicitly in the docstring, for there may come a time when another solver that does not support `constraint_generation` may be made available in Sage, and it's quite likely we will forget to update the documentation when the code is changed... But well `:-P`

Hellooooooooo !!

As I said earlier, you cannot say that a solver returned when calling `constraint_generation=False` does not support constraint generation. You can only say that it does support constraint generation when `constraint_generation` is set to `True`. Also, as far as I know you can only add constraints, not modify them.

Ok.

Hmm, what exactly doesn't CBC support: adding constraints and resolving of course, but what about removing constraints, changing variable bounds, changing the objective?

My use of LP is pretty simple : I add constraints and solve them. Sometimes, I then add constraints and solve them another time. What I can swear is that I cannot so the following with Coin, and that they told me it was not supported.\n\nRemoving constraints or modifying them is what I consider a \"fancy use\" of LP already.

I don't know exactly. My use of LP is pretty simple : I add constraints and solve them. Sometimes, I then add constraints and solve them another time. What I can swear is that I cannot so the following with Coin, and that they told me it was not supported.

Removing constraints or modifying them is what I consider a "fancy use" of LP already. I mean, these things are meant to solve sets of equations, they are not text editors `:-P`

Well, to give you a more serious answer I don't know, and I think the answer is in their documentation. Though if you cannot add constraints you probably can't change them either, for then to "add" constraints you could add empty constraints when the LP is built, and modify them into real constraints to "mimic" constraint generation. And if they do not support it they probably have a technical problem that prevents them from doing it.

I've made a modification much like the one you suggest, but in the `constraint_generation` documentation

>But I don't know what a guy specifying both a solver and a value to `constraint_generation` would expect `O_o`


Well, currently, as far as I can tell from the code, the selected solver is used. Only if `solver=None` is the constraint_generation parameter taken into account. The current reformulation is compatible with this.
