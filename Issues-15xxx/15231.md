Hi Volker,

I had a look at the patch and changed a couple of things:
- Docstring: 'If the divisor is ample then this is an embedding.' - Is that really true? An ample toric divisor is very ample iff the toric variety is smooth or its dimension <=2, see e.g. Cox 6.1.10.
- I think it would be a good idea if the method Kodaira_map() checked that the line bundle corresponding to the divisor has at least a section, otherwise one receives exception that one cannot create `P^-1`. That is of course due to the same, but more confusing, at least to me.
- The optional parameter names was not working.

Would you be okay with that? I don't know whether I raised the correct kind of exception. If everything is okay, then it's a positive review from me.

Best,
Jan
