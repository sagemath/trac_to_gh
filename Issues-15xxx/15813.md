The optional spkg cunningham_tables-1.0 has no tickets, and is now available since sage-4.3.1. It is remarkably small.

According to #7240, it was voted to be included as standard. The newest version would be http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/roed/cunningham_tables-2.2.spkg

It however uses the obsolete SAGE_DATA, so a fixed version of the SPKG is attached. Also, in #7240 David Roe uploaded a patch that provides access to the tables. This is the first commit visible here. It however misses and changes some things.

Needed for #7240.
