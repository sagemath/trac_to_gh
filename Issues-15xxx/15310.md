This ticket implements Wilson's construction of transversal designs (which are equivalent to OA and MOLS) as found in Douglas Stinson's book.

The implementation of the construction is not a very technical problem though it requires several parameters that are not obvious when the user asks for a transversal design of parameters `k,n`. A function `find_wilson_decomposition` thus tries to guess those parameters, and needs for that to know the values of `k,n` for which Sage knows how to build a transversal design.

It can then try all possibilities, and use Wilson's construction as efficiently as possible !

Nevertheless, you can can speed up **a lot** the function `find_wilson_decomposition` using the fact that if a TD(k,n) exists then we have the inequality `k <= n+1`.

<a id='comment:15'></a>Hi Nathann,

I am not sure I would be able to do the full review. Nevertheless, you can can speed up **a lot** the function `find_wilson_decomposition` using the fact that if a TD(k,n) exists then we have the inequality `k <= n+1`. Here is a sample version of what can be done:

```
def find_wilson_decomposition(k,n):
    # we can start from k-1 since we need a TD(k+1,t)
    for t in range(max(1,k-1),n-1):
        u = n%t
        # We ensure that 1<=u and
        # u <= k-2 since we need a TD(k,u)
        if u == 0 or u <= k-2:
            continue

        m = n//t

        # k < m+2 since we need a TD(k,m)
        if k >= m+2:
            break

        if (transversal_design(k  ,m  , availability=True) and

    return False
```

You can check that there is no stupid call to `find_wilson_decomposition` with the following

```
sage: from sage.combinat.designs.orthogonal_arrays import find_wilson_decomposition
sage: find_wilson_decomposition(7,71)
(7, 8, 8, 7)
sage: find_wilson_decomposition.get_cache() # get the list of cached values
...
```

<a id='comment:24'></a>Hi Nathann,

Brett Stevens is in sabatical in Bordeaux and explains me in full details the Wilson construction. Good news: I have enough background to starts seriously the review.

1) There is a much simpler construction than the Wilson one, often called the Kronecker product, which from a TD(k,t) and a TD(k,n) builds a TD(k,nt) (this is basically the case u=0 in Wilson construction). We found that Wilson construction does not apply to a TD(3,6) but the Kronecker product does! Do you prefer opening a new ticket or including it in this one?

2) The programming design with TD calling OA is very bad. In OA there is a nice `EmptySetError` which has an important mathematical meaning. But if you ask for a transversal design you get instead a `NotImplementedError` which is much less informative

```
sage: designs.orthogonal_array(6,3)   # this is great
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
EmptySetError: No Orthogonal Array exists when k>=n+t
sage: designs.transversal_design(6,3)  # this is bad
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
NotImplementedError: I don't know how to build this Transversal Design!
```
In the ideal world, Sage would only return a design or raise an `EmptySetError` with a meaningful message mentionning a theorem. And I learned from Brett that there exist several situations where we know mathematically that a TD(k,n) does not exist. When `availability=True` it would be nice to get a troolean: True (means yes), False (means no), Unknown in `sage.misc.unknown` (means I do not know). And then, you might change the name `availability` to `existence`.

3) The loop where you test the Wilson construction is 2.86 seconds on my (dual core) computer. I am not sure it deserves a `# long time`.

4) Could you mention the following reference as a todo
- AUTHOR = Colbourn, Charles J. and Dinitz, Jeffrey H.
- TITLE = Making the MOLS table
- BOOKTITLE = Computational and constructive design theory
- SERIES = Math. Appl.
- VOLUME = 368
- PAGES = 67--134
- PUBLISHER = Kluwer Acad. Publ., Dordrecht
- YEAR = 1996
They have a slightly improved Wilson construction for u=1, 2 that requires less material (ie not four full smaller TDs)... and hence gives more cases where the construction applies.

Cheers,
Vincent

<a id='comment:25'></a>Yo !

> Brett Stevens is in sabatical in Bordeaux and explains me in full details the Wilson  construction. Good news: I have enough background to starts seriously the review.


Ahahaha. Well you must have more background that I have then, I am jealous `:-P`

> 1) There is a much simpler construction than the Wilson one, often called the Kronecker product, which from a TD(k,t) and a TD(k,n) builds a TD(k,nt) (this is basically the case u=0 in Wilson construction). We found that Wilson construction does not apply to a TD(3,6) but the Kronecker product does! Do you prefer opening a new ticket or including it in this one?


I would say open a new ticket because this ticket does not only implement Wilson's construction, it also adds some "availability" flags to constructors and thus this ticket is a dependency for several others. Hence if we implement it in another ticket the other ones can be reviewed in the meantime.

I also got word from Julian Abel that the Wilson Decomposition I implemented was not the best one, and that some variants may be useful. I copy/paste what he told me here (he probably will not mind)

```
I note from  your list of  known MOLS that you've used Wilson's theorem with 1 truncated group, but not more.  The next most important variants are
where there are (1) 2 truncated groups (2) 1 spike block or 1 truncated group and a spike. These variants are as follows:

Theorem 1: If  there are k+2 MOLS(t),    and k MOLS(s) for s=g, g+1, g+2, u_1, u_2,  where 0 \leq u_1, u_2 \leq t, then there are k MOLS(gt + u_1 + u_2).
Theorem 2: If  there are k+x MOLS(t),     and k MOLS(s) for s=g, g+1, g+x,  g+x,  where 0  \leq u_1,   u_2 \leq t, x> 0 then there are k MOLS(gt +  x).
Theorem 3: If  there are k+x+1 MOLS(t),  and k MOLS(s) for s=g, g+1, g+2, g+x, u_1,  where 0 \ leq  u_1  \leq t, x > 0, then there are k MOLS(gt + x + u_1).

For instance, Th. 1 gives 6 MOLS for v=106 = 7. 13 + 7 + 8.  Theorem 2 gives 7 MOLS(v) for v=155 = 8.19 + 3. And Theorem 3 gives 6 MOLS(v) for v=148= 7.19 + 6 + 9.
```

He also pointed me toward references where I can read those constructions, but I have not begun this step yet and he told me it would be hard to read. Still, it has to be done.

> 2) The programming design with TD calling OA is very bad. In OA there is a nice `EmptySetError` which has an important mathematical meaning. But if you ask for a transversal design you get instead a `NotImplementedError` which is much less informative


How is that a result of TD calling OA ?

> In the ideal world, Sage would only return a design or raise an `EmptySetError` with a meaningful message mentionning a theorem. And I learned from Brett that there exist several situations where we know mathematically that a TD(k,n) does not exist. When `availability=True` it would be nice to get a troolean: True (means yes), False (means no), Unknown in `sage.misc.unknown` (means I do not know). 


Well. No problem if "if Unknown" is equivalent to "if False". 

> And then, you might change the name `availability` to `existence`.


Could we do that on top of #12267 ? I would prefer those patches to be merged like that, and then we can update stuff. Otherwise it means fixing many conflicts with the stuff above, but I agree that it is a good idea.

> 3) The loop where you test the Wilson construction is 2.86 seconds on my (dual core) computer. I am not sure it deserves a `# long time`.


Well, I usually set `#long ` even for 2 seconds. Most tests are faster than that, andyou can have many "2 seconds" tests. I don't mind adding/removing flags like that,  but you can also add a commit if you like.

Actually, the product construction is what you are doing in #16227. You can see it as a particular case of Wilson construction.

I would better say not calling OA appropriately. line 79

```
    elif orthogonal_array(k,n, check = False, availability = True):
       ...
```
I still found that having half of the implementation in TD and half of the implementation in OA is very confusing.

It is. You do not know your troolean algebra !?

Make sense. I will open a ticket for that.

Oh. And you want to transfer the "False" answer which means "that stuff does not exist" as an exception ? Then do you mind if we do that in the ticket which will change "availability" to "existence" ? It would be easier to not fix many conflicts in many patches. But it is a good idea and it will be implemented, be sure I don't say this because I don't want to do it. It *is* a good idea.

To me it should raise an Exception. You just cannot trust these things to do what they should.

Hmmm... Not now please, I will probably have more questions to ask him and right now we are exchanging email about a construction of MOLS that I cannot reproduce. I implemented quite a lot of specific constructions of MOLS/OA during the last days. Besides #16241 #16236 and #16235 I have the following ready :

```

With regards to the product construction, I think that when Wilson's construction is passed $u=0$ then it should not check that TD$(k+1,t)$, TD$(k,u)$, TD$(k,m+1)$ exist at all.

I am waiting for sage to compile, then I will get the new commit and look more closely at the code.

Here are some additional thoughts that apply to the whole TD/OA enterprise rather than just this patch (If I should be discussing these things somewhere else because they are more general comments then please let me know and point me to where to have this discussion)

- (anticipating ticket #16231) the OA/TD/MOLS object should have a single internal format and then constructor operations to output other equivalent objects.  I think OA is the most general since it can have arbitrary $t$ (Which TD does not) and arbitrary $\lambda$ (which MOLS cannot have), etc.  I think all internal operations should be done on OAs; that is all constructions are as OAs.  Then the object should be able to output a TD or MOLS as alternatives.

This is an important issue I started to discuss with Nathann in #15431... and I am in favour of implementing all the code with OA conventions.

There is a lot of work needing to be done, and this work is implementing constructions, any kind of constructions, in any formalism you like. We can merge everything later if we need. But really what we need right now are constructions, and nothing else.

> Cool: look at ticket #16272. I will add those references to the description. If you have other non-existence theorems please post them on #16272.


Yep, non-existence results are good and the Unknown truth value really helps here. We could also implement something funny : if a guy ever needs to say in a paper that "this design exists", we could have Sage return some information on the path used by the constructions.

I mean. We can say where the basic constructions come from (we have the references), and we can also say how the recursive constructions are applied. Sooooo what we have is a way to say that this design can be obtained by applying this or that constructions in this way,using the following elementary blocks whose existence has been proved there and there. Really, we can do that `:-)`

But that's nice things for later. What we need to do is beat the Handbook's MOLS table while providing the actual MOLS. That would be something we could boast about `:-P`

True. But on the other hand
- it is very hard to see what belongs to the OA/TD/MOLS and in few times it will be hard to understand what happens to your input
- the `EmptySetError` raised in OA would also makes sense inside the TD. It is better to do trivial check on the input before digging for a construction. So if we want efficient code, we will have to copy paste all sanity checks

I think it would make more sense to merge the two tickets simultaneously. Would you mind if we move the changes you introduced in #16227 in this one (I can even do that by myself).

Since when are such things called serious ? `:-P` 

Besides I implemented one months after the other, so if you do not mind... :-P

This is already done, as Sage will automatically use the product construction to see if such a design exists. When you call `designs.orthogonal_array(...)` the TD product construction will be called from time to time.

Yepyep, we can make the designs be optional parameters indeed ...

Really I don't mind but I am writing construction code and there is a lot of work to do. If you want features like that, would you mind implementing them ? It is not a lot of work, you just have to add optional parameters in Wilson's construction equal to None, and if they are set to None Sage will find the designs itself otherwise it will use those that are provided.

Right now I am just trying to implement what I need to create more TD/OA/MOLS, and we will have all the time in the world to create fancy features when it will be in `:-P`

I am two constructions away from having implemented all explicit construction of length <= 80 that the Handbook provides, but they are tricky ones. Then this step will be done too, and we will have to implement the variants of Wilson's theorem.
