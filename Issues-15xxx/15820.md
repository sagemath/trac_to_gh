#12630 has introduced tools to compute with quiver algebras and quiver representations. It is all Python code, paths being internally stored by lists of labelled edges of digraphs.

The aim of this ticket is to provide an efficient implementation of lists of bounded integers, with concatenation. This can be used to implement paths of a quiver more efficiently, but can also have different applications (say, elements of free groups, or other applications in sage-combinat).

There are various possible more or less obvious data formats:

1. Store a path as `char*` or `unsigned int*`, hence, as a list of integers, each integer corresponding to one edge of the quiver. `char*` would bound the total number of edges of the quiver to 256 (which might be too small), whereas `unsigned int*` might consume to much memory.
2. Store a path as `char*`, each integer corresponding to an outgoing edge of a vertex. Hence, the total number of edges may be arbitrary, we only have a local bound of 128 on the number of outgoing edges---this hopefully is enough (it certainly is enough for me).
3. As in 1., but the representation is compressed: If we have less than 128 edges, then one byte can represent a pair of edges, and a single 32- or 64-bit int could store even longer sequences of edges.
4. As in 2., but the representation is compressed: If each vertex has less than 8 outgoing edges, then a byte can represent a pair and a single 32-bit word can represent a 10-tuple of edges (if I did not miscalculate).

In 2. and 4. (and probably in 1. and 3. as well) we should explicitly store the start and end point of the path. The length should probably be stored as well.

In my applications, the following operations on paths are needed to be fast: Concatenation, hash/comparison, testing whether a path p starts with a path q, and less important whether a path p contains a path q.

Concatenation is particularly easy in 1. and 2. (just concatenation of lists, which is achieved by memcopy). It is a bit more difficult in 3. and 4., where the bytes of the second factor need to be shifted to get the compressed data seamless.

Hash and comparison are easy in all four formats, but of course best speed would be obtained in 4., simply since the amount of data that needs to be processed is smaller than in 1.-3.

In all four proposed data formats, it is easy to test whether path p starts with path q. Again, having the data stored in as little memory as possible will speed things up.

It is easy in 1. to test whether path p *contains* path q (as a subpath that is not necessarily an initial segment), whereas this becomes a bit more difficult in 2.-4.

What format would you suggest? Perhaps it makes sense to have some initial implementations of all four, and then compare directly.

I'd say:
- Some implementation without limitations (the one from the previous ticket I guess)
- Whichever of 1-4 that covers your needs (256 edges for Gr√∂bner bases
  calculations this should be already quite big, right?)
- As much as possible of the code shared between all implementations to make it easy to add new ones if deemed useful.

But that's just my 2 cents ... I don't have specific experience!

Hi Nicolas,

Replying to [nthiery](#comment%3A2):
> - Some implementation without limitations (the one from the previous ticket I guess)


An implementation which represents edges by `unsigned long long` can be considered "unlimited".

> - Whichever of 1-4 that covers your needs (256 edges for Gr√∂bner bases
>   calculations this should be already quite big, right?)


Yes, but I want a general code.

> - As much as possible of the code shared between all implementations to make it easy to add new ones if deemed useful.


Actually, on the level of paths, the implementations come in pairs: The compressed representations differ from the non-compressed---at the end of the day, we just have different ways of representing sequences of integers. Only when it comes to interpreting a sequence of integers as a path in a quiver will we have further differences: Does "[1,2]" mean "start with arrow 1 of the quiver and continue with arrow 2 of the quiver", or does it mean "travel along the outgoing arrow 1 of the vertex we are currently located at, and then continue with outgoing arrow 2 of the vertex we just arrived at".

Currently, I prefer a compressed representation by `unsigned long long*`. Rationale:
- This will work even for extremely large quivers---the only restriction is, that the number of edges can be represented as an `unsigned long long` (a larger quiver won't fit into computer's memory anyway).
- For small quivers, even paths of length 10 will easily fit into a single `unsigned long long`. That's quite efficient, both memory- and speed-wise.

A bit later I will post experimental code (not yet talking about quiver paths but about sequences of integers) giving some evidence on efficiency. And then we can still see how we interpret the integer sequences: Having a global or a local list of arrows?

    "body": "<a id='comment:4'></a>\nI have attached a toy (or proof-of-concept) implementation; see [attachment:path_test.pyx]. In a *real* implementation in\ncompressed representation, it would be the job of a `PathSemigroup` to find\nout how many edges fit into one word. And of course, in the toy implementation\nI am not trying to translate an integer sequence into the string\nrepresentation of an element of the path semigroup.\n\nWhat implementation would you suggest to use in \"reality\"? Is there another implementation of \"sequences of bounded integers\" that you would recommend? And would you enumerate the arrows of a quiver locally (i.e., only number the outgoing edges at each vertex) or globally? The former will result in better compression, but would make it more difficult to test for paths p,q whether there are paths r,s with `p==r*q*s`.\n\nNow for the timings, and sorry for the long post...\n\nHere, I am timing concatenation, hash, comparison, comparing initial\nsegments.

<a id='comment:4'></a>
I have attached a toy (or proof-of-concept) implementation; see [attachment:path_test.pyx]. In a *real* implementation in
compressed representation, it would be the job of a `PathSemigroup` to find
out how many edges fit into one word. And of course, in the toy implementation
I am not trying to translate an integer sequence into the string
representation of an element of the path semigroup.

What implementation would you suggest to use in "reality"? Is there another implementation of "sequences of bounded integers" that you would recommend? And would you enumerate the arrows of a quiver locally (i.e., only number the outgoing edges at each vertex) or globally? The former will result in better compression, but would make it more difficult to test for paths p,q whether there are paths r,s with `p==r*q*s`.

Now for the timings, and sorry for the long post...

Here, I am timing concatenation, hash, comparison, comparing initial
segments. In all examples, we use the following paths of various sizes.

```
p5 = Path(ZZ, 5, range(5), 1, 1)
p25 = Path(ZZ, 25, range(25), 1, 1)
p50 = Path(ZZ, 50, range(50), 1, 1)
p100 = Path(ZZ, 100, range(100), 1, 1)
p1000 = Path(ZZ, 1000, range(1000), 1, 1)
q5 = Path(ZZ, 5, range(1,6), 1, 1)
q25 = Path(ZZ, 25, range(1,26), 1, 1)
q50 = Path(ZZ, 50, range(1,51), 1, 1)
q100 = Path(ZZ, 100, range(1,101), 1, 1)
q1000 = Path(ZZ, 1000, range(1,1001), 1, 1)
r5 = Path(ZZ, 5, range(1,5)+[0], 1, 1)
r25 = Path(ZZ, 25, range(1,25)+[0], 1, 1)
r50 = Path(ZZ, 50, range(1,50)+[0], 1, 1)
r100 = Path(ZZ, 100, range(1,100)+[0], 1, 1)
r1000 = Path(ZZ, 1000, range(1,1000)+[0], 1, 1)
s5 = Path(ZZ, 5, range(5), 1, 1)
s25 = Path(ZZ, 25, range(25), 1, 1)
s50 = Path(ZZ, 50, range(50), 1, 1)
s100 = Path(ZZ, 100, range(100), 1, 1)
s1000 = Path(ZZ, 1000, range(1000), 1, 1)
```

We are doing the following tests.

Concatenation:

```
%timeit p5*q5
%timeit p5*q25
%timeit p25*q25
%timeit p25*q50
%timeit p50*q50
%timeit p50*q100
%timeit p100*q100
%timeit p100*q1000
%timeit p1000*q1000
```

Hash:

```
%timeit hash(p5)
%timeit hash(p25)
%timeit hash(p50)
%timeit hash(p100)
%timeit hash(p1000)
```

Comparison:
1. equal

```
%timeit p5==s5
%timeit p25==s25
%timeit p50==s50
%timeit p100==s100
%timeit p1000==s1000
```
2. obviously different (first item differs)

```
%timeit p5==r5
%timeit p25==r25
%timeit p50==r50
%timeit p100==r100
%timeit p1000==r1000
```
3. less obviously different (only the last item differs)

```
%timeit q5==r5
%timeit q25==r25
%timeit q50==r50
%timeit q100==r100
%timeit q1000==r1000
```

Startswith:

```
%timeit q1000.startswith(q100)  # it does start with
%timeit q1000.startswith(r100)  # it doesn't start with
```

**__Compressed integer lists__**

Here, we define `Path=Path_v2` (see [attachment:path_test.pyx]), and do

```
sage: SizeManager.set_edge_number(27)
```
so that there is a total of only 27 edges (resp. 27 is the maximal number of
outgoing arrows on a vertex). In particular, all integers in the sequences
below are taken "mod 27". Since 27 has length 5 bits, a compressed
representation using `unsigned char*` won't make sense. Hence, I am only
testing long and short.

I have fixed the problems in [attachment:path_test.pyx].

It was:
1. bitshift by a wrong offset, and
2. the bits that aren't used (e.g., the last 4 bits of an uint64_t when storing 12 arrows of size 5 bits) should be kept blank.

The latter involves an additional bitwise "and". So, probably the timings will slightly deteriorate.

I have replaced [attachment:path_test.pyx] again, adding two more implementations.

Do you have further suggestions on storage of lists of bounded integers? If you haven't, then I'll try to assess the timings stated in the various comments, according to what I expect to be useful in my applications.

Here are details on the two new implementations:

In `Path_v3`, I use Sage's `Integer` class as bit list. Sounds crazy, but it works rather well. I assume that bitshifts and comparison (and that's what we are using here) are internally written in assembler, and for us, the additional benefit is that we do not need to take care about the size of blocks (8 bit? 32 bit? 64 bit? 128 bit?) in which we store stuff---`Integer` does it for us. Perhaps the timings could be improved further by using the underlying c-library (GMP's `mpz_t`) directly.

In `Path_v4`, I provide a slightly simplified version of `Path_v2`: The data is compressed, but so that the chunks used to store one arrow fit seamlessly into a memory block. Hence, when we use 64-bit blocks, and have 27 arrows, then `Path_v2` would store the arrows in chunks of 5 bit (hence, it can store 12 arrows in one memory block, leaving 4 bit empty), whereas `Path_v4` would store the arrows in chunks of 8 bit (hence, it can only store 8 arrows in one memory block, but since this fits neatly into one memory block, the code can be simplified).

The timings for `Path_v3`:

Hmmmmmmm... Well, looks like the last one is the best, even though it is a bit slow for hashing. If the sizeof a block is a power of two it should be quite good, don't you think ?

This being said, perhaps  it should be implemented like the bitset stuff, in a algebraic-free file, to store sequences of integers as you said.

How do you define your hashing function and your comparison function, by the way ?

What do you mean by "the last one"? Using GMP's `mpz_t`directly, which is `Path_v5` in the attachment? Or the improved "semicompressed" version of `uint64_t*` (storing chunks of size `2^n` rather then in the smallest possible chunk size), which is `Path_v4`?

> If the sizeof a block is a power of two it should be quite good, don't you think ?


Should be. My own summary of the timings above would be this. We have 6 benchmarks, and in the following list I am giving for each benchmark a small, a medium and a large example. In the end, `+` or `-` indicate whether the respective implementation did well/poorly in the three examples.

1. Concatenation

```

```

2. Hash

GMP          mpz_t: 159 ns 266 ns  1.93 us
```

3. == for equal paths

5. == for "difficult" unequal paths

```
                     5       100      1000
Uncompressed long : 1.65 us   22 us    213 us   ---
Uncompressed short: 1.15 us   12.8 us  140 us

GMP          mpz_t:  448 ns    457 ns   470 ns  +++
```

6. startswith (here we only have one example size, one where the answer is True, and one where the answer is False)

```
                     yes      no
Uncompressed long :  325 ns  311 ns
Uncompressed short:  336 ns  325 ns
Uncompressed char :  324 ns  315 ns

Compressed   short:  272 ns  256 ns  +
Semicompr.   long :  263 ns  232 ns  ++
Integer           : 2.46 us 2.45 us  --
GMP          mpz_t:  673 ns  657 ns
```

So, I don't think there is a clear winner in the competition.

Yes, it would make sense.

> How do you define your hashing function and your comparison function, by the way ?


Depends on the implementation. Of course, when I use `Integer` or `mpz_t`, I am using the hash function provided by GMP. When I implement a `block*`, where `block` is either `char`, `uint32_t` or `uint64_t`, I am using some hash function for lists that I found in the internet a while ago (I don't recall where). It is as follows:

```python
    def __hash__(self):
        cdef block h
        cdef block* ptr
        h = <block>(self.start^(self.end<<16)^(self._len))
        ptr = <block *>self.data
        cdef size_t i
        h ^= FNV_offset
        for i from 0<=i<self._len:
            h ^= ptr[i]
            h *= FNV_prime
        if h==-1:
            return -2
        return h
```
where `FNV_prime` and `FNV_offset` depend on the architecture. I am surprised that this is faster than GMP's hash function.

So, using tuples is best for concatenation of short paths, but that's the only case where it is not too slow.

Well, given the outcomes I guess it mostly depends on your own practical applications ?... `:-)`

I also wonder (because I hate them) how much time is spent dealing with parents. But all your implementations have to go through that at the moment so it does not change your comparisons.

Well, I am back to work at long long last. With a computer AND a screen. And in Brussels, which counts for the good mood `:-P`

Have fuuuuuuuuuuuuuun !

Hi Nathann,

Replying to [ncohen](#comment%3A19):
> I also wonder (because I hate them) how much time is spent dealing with parents.


Well, at some point parents *have* to come into play, namely when I want to implement not just sequences of bounded integers, but elements of the path semigroup of a quiver.

The strategical question is: Should the data defining a path be stored in an attribute of that path (the attribute would be an instance of `BoundedIntegerSequence`), or should the path itself be an instance of `BoundedIntegerSequence`? In the former case, it would be perfectly fine to have sequences of bounded integers parent-less; but I worry about an overhead of accessing the attribute. In the latter case, `BoundedIntegerSequence` should already be a sub-class of `sage.structure.element.Element` (and have a parent), since Cython does not allow multiple inheritance.

I tend to the latter solution also for a different reason: Instances of `BoundedIntegerSequence` have to know the bound for their elements, because the data storage depends on that bound. For efficiency (see attachment), several other constants are derived from that bound, and used in the algorithms.

Should each instance of `BoundedIntegerSequence` know about all these bounds? Or should there be a common parent for all sequences of integers that are bounded by a number B?

I tend to the latter. If you assign *several* ints (the afore-mentioned constants) to an instance of `BoundedIntegerSequence`, it will likely be more time consuming (during initialisation) than to store just a single data (namely the parent).

That said, looking up the constants via the parent would be more time-consuming than looking up constants that are stored directly in the element.

Difficult....

Hellooooo Simon !

Hmmmm... All this is important to settle before implementing those BoundedIntegerSequences objects somewhere indeed.

What I thought you intended was to write a very low-level data structure somewhere in the misc/ folder. The kind of stuff that one does not use by mistake, the kind of stuff that ones does not use without reading the manual first. So I thought it would not exactly check its input, trusting blindly the developer and being as efficient as possible.

Then, I thought you would have a higher-level algebraic stuff with parents colors and blinking lights that would check their input indeed, and be what we want a user-friendly object to be.

But I actually have only one question: I don't know how you intend to use all this in the end, but I got the impression that several functions may have to generate a LOT of paths in order to compute some small data, and throw all the paths away once the computations have ended. Do you want do create high-level objects in those functions or not ?

If you don't, then perhaps you would be better with only low-level objects that you know how to use, which would not have to waste time (if time is actually wasted) on high-level problems.

And so I thought that you high-level objects would have a variable which would be this low-level object, etc, etc... 

What do you have in mind ?

Nathann

Hi Nathann,

Replying to [ncohen](#comment%3A21):
> What I thought you intended was to write a very low-level data structure somewhere in the misc/ folder.


I somehow do.

> The kind of stuff that one does not use by mistake,


Why? It should be a replacement for tuples (thus, low-level), but it should *ideally* be (close to) a drop-in replacement (thus, it doesn't matter whether one uses it by mistake).

> Then, I thought you would have a higher-level algebraic stuff with parents colors and blinking lights that would check their input indeed, and be what we want a user-friendly object to be.


Again *ideally*: Blinking colours should only be added when one really implements paths in quivers.

> But I actually have only one question: I don't know how you intend to use all this in the end, but I got the impression that several functions may have to generate a LOT of paths in order to compute some small data, and throw all the paths away once the computations have ended. Do you want do create high-level objects in those functions or not ?


Good point. So, you mean that these functions should actually *not* create fully-fledged quiver paths, but should just operate on instances of `BoundedIntegerSequence`, and only in the end interpret them as paths, when the battle smoke has vanished.

> And so I thought that you high-level objects would have a variable which would be this low-level object, etc, etc... 


Yes, probably that's better.

So, perhaps I should really do `cdef class BoundedIntegerSequence(tuple)` rather than `cdef class BoundedIntegerSequence(MonoidElement)`.

But then, what to do with all these internally used constants that are needed even for the low-level functionality of `BoundedIntegerSequence`? Would you prefer to compute and store these constants 10000 times when creating 10000 sequences of integers bounded by `B`? Or would you prefer to compute and store these constants only once, namely in a parent that hosts all sequences of integers with a fixed bound?

Or do you have a third solution for storing/accessing these constants efficiently?

By analogy to `Sequence_generic` (which inherits from `list`):

```
sage: S = Sequence([1,2,3])
sage: type(S)
<class 'sage.structure.sequence.Sequence_generic'>
sage: type(S).mro()
[sage.structure.sequence.Sequence_generic,
 sage.structure.sage_object.SageObject,
 list,
 object]
```

No, that's a different situation.

Sure, `O(B)` could be written in C as well. But why not making it a parent, when all what we do is letting each sequence have a pointer to `O(B)`?

No. We have

```c
cdef Integer NumberArrows
cdef Integer IntegerMask
cdef size_t ArrowBitSize, BigArrowBitSize
cdef block* bitmask = NULL
cdef block DataMask, BitMask
cdef size_t ArrowsPerBlock, BigArrowsPerBlock

For example, `ModBAPB` is used to replace `n%BigArrowsPerBlock` by a bit-wise `and`, which is noticeably faster.

Depending on the implementation...

Do I understand correctly: You suggest that we should *not* provide a class `BoundedIntegerSequence` that can be used interactively in Sage, but you suggest that we should just provide a couple of functions that operate on C structures (say, `mpz_t` or `usigned long*`) and can only be used in Cython code?

No problem. I just want to know if people see the need to have a Cython implementation of sequences of bounded integers, for use in Python.

Making it something like a container rather than a fully fledged parent would be an option, from my perspective.

I just had a look at `ClonableElement`, and one immediate thought is: Why are C-pointers allocated in `__init__`? That's clearly the purpose of `__cinit__`, in particular if said C-pointers are freed in `__dealloc__`.

Do we want to have sequences of bounded integers for use in Python? Then one possible way would be:

- have some inline cdef functions that operate on certain (templated?) C data structures
- use these in a sub-class of `ClonableElement` (so that we can have sequences of bounded integers used in python)
- use these in a `Path` class, to be used in path semigroups.

Well, if it is a template the code is only implemented once. And it will generate several data structures at compile time indeed, but each of them will have a hardcoded constant, and  you only implement one.

That's what I had in mind, but you make decisions here, pick what you like.

It's a bit how bitsets are implemented. A C data structure, and an object wrapper on top of it. Or C Graphs, with a data structure on top of it. It is how Permutations should be implemented, too `:-P`

Well, you have a C object that you use when you want performance, and when you don't care you use the higher-level implementations.

Well, I like this plan. What do you think ? Does it displease you in any way ?

> No problem. I just want to know if people see the need to have a Cython implementation of sequences of bounded integers, for use in Python.


I do not see how I could use it in my code at the moment, but I like the idea of having such a data structure somewhere, ready to be used.

Right, that's what I have looked at, and think makes sense here. Up to the constants.

Apparently I am not used to templated code...

I was somehow thinking that you suggested to keep the bitlength of the upper bound for the integers as the *only* parameter, which means that you would need to compute all the other things either for each operation or (when storing it as attribute of the sequences) for each sequence.

Part of the question is: Do we want to use gmp as backend? Or do we want to (re-)implement operations on densely packed `long*` by ourselves? Given the timings, gmp *is* an option.

Anyway, I'll have a look at the stackoverflow discussion. Thank you for the pointer!

The next question then is how to access the code from Cython. I've done this with C, but not C++.

Hi Nathann,

wouldn't the following be close to templates?

In Cython:

```
cimport cython

ctypedef fused str_or_int:
    str
    int

cpdef str_or_int times_two(str_or_int var):
    return var+var

def show_me():
    cdef str a = 'a'
    cdef int b = 3
    print 'str', times_two(a)
    print 'int', times_two(b)
```
and this results in

```
sage: show_me()
str aa
int 6
```

Or perhaps a better example, showing that the fused type is used to choose code at compile time: Put the following into a cell of the notebook

```
%cython
cimport cython

ctypedef fused str_or_int:
    str
    int
cpdef str_or_int times_two(str_or_int var):
    if str_or_int is int:
        return var*2
    else:
        return var+var
def test():
    cdef int a = 3
    cdef str b = 'b'
    a = times_two(a)
    b = times_two(b)
```
and look at the resulting code. The line `a = times_two(a)` becomes

```
 __pyx_v_a = __pyx_fuse_1__pyx_f_68_home_king__sage_sage_notebook_sagenb_home_admin_2_code_sage4_spyx_0_times_two(__pyx_v_a, 0);
```
whereas `b = times_two(b)` becomes

```
__pyx_t_1 = __pyx_fuse_0__pyx_f_68_home_king__sage_sage_notebook_sagenb_home_admin_2_code_sage4_spyx_0_times_two(__pyx_v_b, 0);
```
and one can check that Cython created two different C-functions `__pyx_fuse_0...` and `__pyx_fuse_1...` for the two possible (type-dependent!) versions of `times_two`.

And here an example showing that it pays off, speed-wise:

In a .pyx file:

```
cimport cython

ctypedef fused str_or_int:
    str
    int

cpdef str_or_int times_two(str_or_int var):
    if str_or_int is int:
        return var+var
    else:
        return var+var

cpdef untyped_times_two(var):
    return var+var

cpdef int int_times_two(int var):
    return var+var

cpdef str str_times_two(str var):
    return var+var

def test1():
    cdef int a = 3
    cdef str b = 'b'
    a = times_two(a)
    b = times_two(b)

def test2():
    cdef int a = 3
    cdef str b = 'b'
    a = untyped_times_two(a)
    b = untyped_times_two(b)

def test3():
    cdef int a = 3
    cdef str b = 'b'
    a = int_times_two(a)
    b = str_times_two(b)
```
Attach the .pyx file to Sage, and get this:

```
age: %attach /home/king/Sage/work/templates/test.pyx
Compiling /home/king/Sage/work/templates/test.pyx...
sage: %timeit test1()
10000000 loops, best of 3: 159 ns per loop
sage: %timeit test2()
1000000 loops, best of 3: 199 ns per loop
sage: %timeit test3()
10000000 loops, best of 3: 168 ns per loop
```

EDIT: I have replaced the original example by something fairer, where it says `var+var` everywhere, but in the templated version Cython can choose the c-implementation of `var+var` at compile time, whereas it can't (and hence loses time when running the code) in the untemplated version.

EDIT 2: The new example also shows that choosing a specialised implementation manually is not faster than Cython using templates.

Hi Nathann,

Replying to [ncohen](#comment%3A41):
> HMmmmmm... Does it make any difference ? gcc should resolve those "if" at compile-time, so if Cython creates two version of the function with an "if" inside depending on the type, gcc should not include it in the final binary as the constants involved can be defined at compile-time.


Yes, it is indeed resolved at compile time. Two c-functions are created, and only the part of the code relevant for the respective code branch appears in the c-function.

In other words, I now plan to create cdef functions like this:

```python
ctypedef seq_t:
    first_implementation
    second_implementation

cdef seq_t concat(seq_t x, seq_t y):
    if seq_t is first_implementation:
        <do stuff for 1st implementation>
    else:
        <do stuff for 2nd implementation>
```
and then, in other modules (perhaps also in `src/sage/combinat/words/word_datatypes.pyx`?), one could uniformly call `concat(a,b)`, provided that the type of `a` and `b` are known at compile time (or write `concat[first_implementation](a,b)` explicitly).

I think that such Cython code will be sufficiently nice to read, and the resulting C-code will be sufficiently fast.

> Anyway, that's a good news ! `:-D`


Indeed!

Hmmm. Meanwhile I am a bit less positive about fused types. Let `seq_t` be a fused type for different implementations.

- Fused types can not be used in iterators. I.e., the following is refused:

  ```
  def iter_seq(seq_t S):
      for <bla>:
          <do something>
          yield x
  ```
- Fused types can not be used as attributes of cdef classes. I.e., the following is refused:

  ```
  cdef class BoundedIntSeq:
      cdef seq_t seq
      def __mul__(self, other):
          <do type check>
          cdef seq_t out = concat_seq(self.seq, other.seq)
          <create and return new instance of BoundedIntSeq using "out">
  ```

Hence, it seems that one needs to create two separate iterators, and it also seems that one needs code duplication. I.e., when `impl1` and `impl2` are two specialisations of the fused type `seq_t`, then one has to have

```
cdef class BoundedIntSeq_impl1:
    cdef impl1 seq
    def __mul__(self, other):
        ...
        cdef impl1 out = concat_seq(self.seq, other.seq)
cdef class BoundedIntSeq_impl2:
    cdef impl2 seq
    def __mul__(self, other):
        ...
        cdef impl2 out = concat_seq(self.seq, other.seq)
```
This mainly amounts to cut-and-paste, but is ugly!

I think I'll ask on cython-users if there are known ideas to solve this more elegantly.

Some variation on the theme: One can create fused types from two cdef classes, and then one can work with specialisations of functions as follows:

```python

ctypedef fused str_or_int:
    str
    int

# make the function do different things on different types,
# to better see the difference
cpdef str_or_int times_two(str_or_int var):
    if str_or_int is int:
        return var+var
    else:
        return var+'+'+var

# forward declaration of cdef classes and their fusion
cdef class Bar_int
cdef class Bar_str
cdef fused Bar:
    Bar_int
    Bar_str

# a function that can be specialised to either of the two extension classes
def twice(Bar self):
    # and inside, we specialised a function depending
    # on the type of an attribute --- at compile time!!
    return type(self)(times_two(self.data))

cdef class Bar_str:
    cdef str data
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
    def __repr__(self):
        return self.data
    # First possibility: Use the "templated" function as a method
    twice_ = twice[Bar_str]
    # second possibility: Wrap the "templated" function
    cpdef Bar_str twice__(self):
        return twice(self)

# The same, with the other Specialisation of <Bar>
cdef class Bar_int:
    cdef int data
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
    def __repr__(self):
        return "int(%d)"%self.data
    twice_ = twice[Bar_int]
    cpdef Bar_int twice__(self):
        return twice(self)
```
Time-wise, we see that wrapping the "templated" function is slower than using it as an attribute:

```
sage: b1 = Bar_str('abc')
sage: b1.twice_()
abc+abc
sage: b1.twice__()
abc+abc
sage: %timeit b1.twice_()
1000000 loops, best of 3: 759 ns per loop
sage: %timeit b1.twice__()
100000 loops, best of 3: 13.7 ¬µs per loop
sage: b2 = Bar_int(5)
sage: b2.twice_()

__Summary and further comments__

- We can reduce the code duplication to something like this:

  ```
  <define templated function foo_ depending on a fused type Bar with specialisations Bar1, Bar2,...>
  cdef class Bar1:
      foo = foo_[Bar1]
  cdef class Bar2:
      foo = foo_[Bar2]
  ...
  ```
  I hope this level of copy-and-paste can be afforded. At least, it gives good speed.
- In my tests I found the following:
  - It is impossible to make `foo_` a cpdef function. Otherwise, the assignment `foo = foo_` fails with the statement that `foo_` can not be turned into a Python type.
  - It is impossible to chose the same name for the templated function and for the method it is turned into. Doing

    ```
    class Bar1:
        foo_ = foo_
    ```
    results in an error saying that `Bar1` has not attribute `foo_`.
  - With the syntax above, both `twice_` and `twice__` have been put into the class' `__dict__`. I did not succeed to turn it into the equivalent of a cdef method.

I have pushed a branch with an initial implementation of bounded integer sequences. I took care of error handling: I think you will find that those GMP commands that may result in a memory error are wrapped in sig_on()/sig_off(), and the cdef boilerplate functions do propagate errors. In fact, in some of my tests, I was hitting Ctrl-C, and it worked.

The rest of this post is about benchmarks. I compare against Python tuples---which is of course ambitious, and you will find that not in all situations tuples are slower than bounded integer sequences. However, one should see it positively: The bounded integer sequences implemented here have features very similar to tuples, and there *are* operations for which they are a lot faster than tuples. It all depends on the length and the bound of the sequence. That's why I think that it is a reasonable contribution. And to make it faster (without Python classes), one can still use the cdef boilerplate functions. Generally, it seems that long bounded integer sequences are faster than long tuples, but short tuples are faster than short sequences. For hash, bounded integer sequences are pretty good, but they suck in accessing items, or in slicing with step different from 1.

In contrast to tuples, bounded integer sequences also provide fairly quick tests for whether a sequences starts with a given sequence, or whether a sequence contains a certain sub-sequence. This is a feature I took from strings.

sage: timeit("x=[y for y in T0]", number=1000000)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 783 ns per loop
sage: timeit("x=[y for y in T1]", number=1000000)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.48 ¬µs per loop
sage: timeit("x=[y for y in T2]", number=100000)
100000 loops, best of 3: 4.3 ¬µs per loop
sage: timeit("x=[y for y in T3]", number=1000)
1000 loops, best of 3: 245 ¬µs per loop
sage: timeit("x=[y for y in S0]", number=1000000)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 2.38 ¬µs per loop
sage: timeit("x=[y for y in S1]", number=100000)
100000 loops, best of 3: 4.1 ¬µs per loop
sage: timeit("x=[y for y in S2]", number=100000)
100000 loops, best of 3: 10.1 ¬µs per loop
sage: timeit("x=[y for y in S3]", number=1000)
1000 loops, best of 3: 1.79 ms per loop
```

__Slicing__

Bounded integer sequences are immutable and hence copied by identity. But let us do slicing, dropping the last item:

```
sage: timeit("x=T3[:-1]", number=100000)
100000 loops, best of 3: 19.5 ¬µs per loop
sage: timeit("x=S3[:-1]", number=100000)
100000 loops, best of 3: 3.48 ¬µs per loop
```
Slicing with `step!=1` is much slower, though:

```
sage: timeit("x=T3[:-1:2]", number=100000)
100000 loops, best of 3: 11.7 ¬µs per loop
sage: timeit("x=S3[:-1:2]", number=1000)
1000 loops, best of 3: 2.23 ms per loop
```
Perhaps I should mark it "TODO"...

__Accessing single items__

Short sequences

```
sage: timeit("x=T0[1]", number=1000000)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 361 ns per loop
sage: timeit("x=T0[4]", number=1000000)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 373 ns per loop
sage: timeit("x=S0[1]", number=1000000)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 959 ns per loop
sage: timeit("x=S0[4]", number=1000000)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 960 ns per loop
```
Large sequences (time also depends on the bound for the integer sequence!)

```
sage: timeit("x=T3[1]", number=1000000)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 359 ns per loop
sage: timeit("x=T3[4500]", number=1000000)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 382 ns per loop
sage: timeit("x=S3[1]", number=1000000)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.97 ¬µs per loop
sage: timeit("x=S3[4500]", number=1000000)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.49 ¬µs per loop
```

__Comparison__

Note that comparison of bounded integer sequences works different from comparison of tuples or lists, as detailed in the documentation.

We compare sequences that are equal but non-identical, that differ in early items, or that differ in late items.

```
sage: L0x = [randint(0,7) for i in range(5)]
sage: L1x = [randint(0,15) for i in range(15)]
sage: L2x = [randint(0,31) for i in range(50)]
sage: L3x = [randint(0,31) for i in range(5000)]  # verified that they differ from L0,L1,L2,L3
sage: T0x = tuple(L0x); T1x = tuple(L1x); T2x = tuple(L2x); T3x = tuple(L3x)
sage: S0x = BoundedIntegerSequence(8, L0x)
sage: S1x = BoundedIntegerSequence(16, L1x)
sage: S2x = BoundedIntegerSequence(32, L2x)
sage: S3x = BoundedIntegerSequence(32, L3x)
sage: T0y = tuple(L0); T1y = tuple(L1); T2y = tuple(L2); T3y = tuple(L3)
sage: S1y = BoundedIntegerSequence(8, L1)
sage: S2y = BoundedIntegerSequence(32, L2)
sage: S3y = BoundedIntegerSequence(32, L3)
sage: S1y==S1!=S1x, S1y is not S1
(True, True)
```
Early differences:

sage: T0z2 = T0+T0x
sage: T1z1 = T1+T1
sage: T1z2 = T1+T1x
sage: T2z1 = T2+T2

sage: timeit("S3z1==S3z2", number=100000)
100000 loops, best of 3: 578 ns per loop
```

__Hash__

This is the only operation for which bounded integer sequences seem to be consistently faster than tuples:

```
sage: timeit("hash(T0)", number=100000)
100000 loops, best of 3: 179 ns per loop
sage: timeit("hash(T0)", number=1000000)

sage: timeit("hash(T3)", number=100000)
100000 loops, best of 3: 45.3 ¬µs per loop

sage: timeit("hash(S3)", number=1000000)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 8.97 ¬µs per loop
```

__Concatenation__

```
sage: timeit("T0+T0", number=1000000)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 200 ns per loop

sage: timeit("S3+S3", number=1000000)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 2.17 ¬µs per loop
```

__Subsequences__

Recall the definition of `S0z1` etc. We find:

```
sage: S0z2.startswith(S0)
True
sage: S0z2.startswith(S0x)
False
sage: S0x in S0z2
True
sage: timeit("S0z2.startswith(S0)", number=1000000)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 239 ns per loop

sage: timeit("S3x in S3z2", number=1000)
1000 loops, best of 3: 3.57 ms per loop
```
I wonder if the latter could be improved. Another "TODO"...

- Gr√∂bner bases for modules over path algebra quotients.
- In particular, an implementation of the non-commutative version of Faug√®re's F5 algorithm that I have described in my latest article.
- Compute minimal generating sets for modules over so-called "basic algebras" (that's a special type of path algebra quotients), which is possible with the non-commutative F5, as shown in my latest article.
- Use all this to compute minimal projective resolutions of basic algebras, but please be faster than what we currently do in our optional group cohomology spkg. Currently, we use a method of David Green for computing the minimal resolutions; but F5 should be more efficient---theoretically...

That said: I guess it would make sense to adopt bounded integer sequences in appropriate parts of sage.combinat.words, but I leave this to others.

Hellooooooo Simon !

Sorry but I only began to read your code and now I should really go get some
sleep. I paste my current notes here in the meantime, but I am a long way from a
proper review job.

- bounded integer sequence, biseq. What about "integer sequence" ? All integers
  are "bounded" on a computer. Why add this "bounded" everywhere ? biseq -> iseq
  ?

- `# Bitsize of "data"` --> bitsize of the whole sequence

- itembitsize --> necessarily a power of 2 ?

- `#cdef inline void dealloc_biseq(biseq_t S)` : why there if commented ?

- `list2biseq` (and others) -> `list_to_biseq` ?

- Comments on the function definitions --> Move it to the function's doc, even
  if it is their only content ?

- Could you write some doc, even if it is just one line, for cdef functions ? A
  bit like what we have for bitsets ? Something like

```
cdef biseq_t* allocate_biseq(size_t l, unsigned long int itemsize):
     """
     Allocates a sequences of l integers stored on itemsize bits each.
     """
```

- I just figured out that you may have wanted to keep this list of functions
  above with short descriptions as an 'index' of what the file does. If so, it
  would be cool to do it in the html doc instead ! It is nice to have
  documentation for C functions even if you have to do it by hand.. An example
  there :
  http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/graphs/sage/graphs/base/static_sparse_graph.html

- list2biseq --> I wondered why this function wouldn't return a new biseq buil
  from a list instead of modifying an existing one.... Performance issue ? Is
  that critical in some cases ?

What about \"integer sequence\" ?\n\n\nNot good, because...\n\n>  All integers are \"bounded\" on a computer. Why add this \"bounded\" everywhere ? biseq -> iseq\n\n\n... the computer's integer bound is chosen when you buy the machine, but not when you create the sequence.\n\nThe point is that each \"bounded integer sequence\" has a bound `B` that can be *chosen upon initialisation* so that any item of the sequence is smaller than `B`.\n\n> - `# Bitsize of \"data\"` --> bitsize of the whole sequence\n\n\nOK.\n \n> - itembitsize --> necessarily a power of 2 ?\n\n\nNo. Here, it is really \"bit\" size. So, the number tells how many bits will be reserved to store one item. Hence, the bound `B` above is a power of two, namely `2^itembitsize`.\n\n> - `#cdef inline void dealloc_biseq(biseq_t S)` : why there if commented ?\n\n\nBecause I forgot to remove it.\n\n> - `list2biseq` (and others) -> `list_to_biseq` ?\n\n\nAcceptable.\n\n> - Comments on the function definitions --> Move it to the function's doc, even\n>   if it is their only content ?\n> - Could you write some doc, even if it is just one line, for cdef functions ? \n\n\nI wouldn't remove the comments from the pxd file, but certainly some documentation should be added to the cdef functions in the pyx file. I wonder if this should be by comments in the code or by a doc string. After all, the doc string will not be visible (cdef functions won't appear in the docs, as they can not imported).\n\n> - I just figured out that you may have wanted to keep this list of functions\n>   above with short descriptions as an 'index' of what the file does.

Performance issue ? Is\n>   that critical in some cases ?\n\n\nThis is motivated by my usage in the `BoundedIntegerSequence` wrapper. As usual, there is `__cinit__` which does memory allocations (as much as I know, it is recommended to not do this kind of things in `__init__`). Hence, when `__init__` is called (and I think filling data into the allocated memory is the job of `__init__`, not of `__cinit__`), then the integer sequence already is allocated, and just needs to be filled.",

> - bounded integer sequence, biseq. What about "integer sequence" ?


Not good, because...

>  All integers are "bounded" on a computer. Why add this "bounded" everywhere ? biseq -> iseq


... the computer's integer bound is chosen when you buy the machine, but not when you create the sequence.

The point is that each "bounded integer sequence" has a bound `B` that can be *chosen upon initialisation* so that any item of the sequence is smaller than `B`.

> - `# Bitsize of "data"` --> bitsize of the whole sequence


OK.
 
> - itembitsize --> necessarily a power of 2 ?


No. Here, it is really "bit" size. So, the number tells how many bits will be reserved to store one item. Hence, the bound `B` above is a power of two, namely `2^itembitsize`.

> - `#cdef inline void dealloc_biseq(biseq_t S)` : why there if commented ?


Because I forgot to remove it.

Acceptable.

I wouldn't remove the comments from the pxd file, but certainly some documentation should be added to the cdef functions in the pyx file. I wonder if this should be by comments in the code or by a doc string. After all, the doc string will not be visible (cdef functions won't appear in the docs, as they can not imported).

You mean: "This file provides the following boilerplate functions, that you can cimport for usage in Cython code: ..."?

This is motivated by my usage in the `BoundedIntegerSequence` wrapper. As usual, there is `__cinit__` which does memory allocations (as much as I know, it is recommended to not do this kind of things in `__init__`). Hence, when `__init__` is called (and I think filling data into the allocated memory is the job of `__init__`, not of `__cinit__`), then the integer sequence already is allocated, and just needs to be filled.

I'm not saying I see one, only that, as far as I understand, automatic memory management is the main advantage of `mpz_t` over `mpn_*` when you are dealing with nonnegative integers (hence my first question).

I have documented the cdef functions, and I have implemented pickling. Again (at least for long sequence), this is faster than for ordinary tuples:

```
sage: from sage.misc.bounded_integer_sequences import BoundedIntegerSequence
sage: L = [randint(0,26) for i in range(5000)]
sage: S = BoundedIntegerSequence(32, L)
sage: %timeit loads(dumps(S))
1000 loops, best of 3: 407 ¬µs per loop
sage: T = tuple(S)
sage: %timeit loads(dumps(T))
100 loops, best of 3: 2.02 ms per loop
```

I hope there is a nice example for `mpn_*` somewhere.

    "body": "<a id='comment:71'></a>\nUsing the `mpn_*` function was a very good idea. Some basic operations are a lot faster now. Here I am repeating (and slightly extending) my earlier benchmarks for those operations that have changed in the recent commits:\n\n__The test bed__\n\n```\nsage: from sage.misc.bounded_integer_sequences import BoundedIntegerSequence\nsage: L0 = [randint(0,7) for i in range(5)]\nsage: L1 = [randint(0,15) for i in range(15)]\nsage: L2 = [randint(0,31) for i in range(50)]\nsage: L3 = [randint(0,31) for i in range(5000)]\nsage: T0 = tuple(L0); T1 = tuple(L1); T2 = tuple(L2); T3 = tuple(L3)\nsage: S0 = BoundedIntegerSequence(8, L0)\nsage: S1 = BoundedIntegerSequence(16, L1)\nsage: S2 = BoundedIntegerSequence(32, L2)\nsage: S3 = BoundedIntegerSequence(32, L3)\n```\n\n__Conversion list -> tuple/sequence__\n\n```\nsage: %timeit x = tuple(L0)\n1000000 loops, best of 3: 307 ns per loop\nsage: %timeit x = tuple(L1)\n1000000 loops, best of 3: 369 ns per loop\nsage: %timeit x = tuple(L2)\n1000000 loops, best of 3: 534 ns per loop\nsage: %timeit x = tuple(L3)\n10000 loops, best of 3: 19.6 \u00b5s per loop\nsage: %timeit x = BoundedIntegerSequence(8, L0)\n1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.34 \u00b5s per loop\nsage: %timeit x = BoundedIntegerSequence(16, L1)\n1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.57 \u00b5s per loop\nsage: %timeit x = BoundedIntegerSequence(32, L2)\n100000 loops, best of 3: 2.06 \u00b5s per loop\nsage: %timeit x = BoundedIntegerSequence(32, L3)\n10000 loops, best of 3: 76.7 \u00b5s per loop\n```\nConversion to a tuple seems to be roughly 4 times faster. But I don't think this will be critical (at least not in my own applications...)\n\n__Conversion tuple/sequence -> list__\n\n```\nsage: %timeit x = list(T0)\n1000000 loops, best of 3: 537 ns per loop\nsage: %timeit x = list(T1)\n1000000 loops, best of 3: 624 ns per loop\nsage: %timeit x = list(T2)\n1000000 loops, best of 3: 752 ns per loop\nsage: %timeit x = list(T3)\n100000 loops, best of 3: 22.6 \u00b5s per loop\nsage: %timeit x = list(S0)\n1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.58 \u00b5s per loop\nsage: %timeit x = list(S1)\n100000 loops, best of 3: 2.06 \u00b5s per loop\nsage: %timeit x = list(S2)\n100000 loops, best of 3: 4.19 \u00b5s per loop\nsage: %timeit x = list(S3)\n1000 loops, best of 3: 253 \u00b5s per loop\nsage: %timeit x = S0.list()\n1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.05 \u00b5s per loop\nsage: %timeit x = S1.list()\n1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.87 \u00b5s per loop\nsage: %timeit x = S2.list()\n100000 loops, best of 3: 4.95 \u00b5s per loop\nsage: %timeit x = S3.list()\n1000 loops, best of 3: 306 \u00b5s per loop\n```\nThe gap between lists and sequences strongly depends on the bound of the sequence, which is not much of a surprise.

Using the `mpn_*` function was a very good idea. Some basic operations are a lot faster now. Here I am repeating (and slightly extending) my earlier benchmarks for those operations that have changed in the recent commits:

__The test bed__

```
sage: from sage.misc.bounded_integer_sequences import BoundedIntegerSequence
sage: L0 = [randint(0,7) for i in range(5)]
sage: L1 = [randint(0,15) for i in range(15)]
sage: L2 = [randint(0,31) for i in range(50)]
sage: L3 = [randint(0,31) for i in range(5000)]
sage: T0 = tuple(L0); T1 = tuple(L1); T2 = tuple(L2); T3 = tuple(L3)
sage: S0 = BoundedIntegerSequence(8, L0)
sage: S1 = BoundedIntegerSequence(16, L1)
sage: S2 = BoundedIntegerSequence(32, L2)
sage: S3 = BoundedIntegerSequence(32, L3)
```

__Conversion list -> tuple/sequence__

```
sage: %timeit x = tuple(L0)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 307 ns per loop
sage: %timeit x = tuple(L1)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 369 ns per loop
sage: %timeit x = tuple(L2)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 534 ns per loop
sage: %timeit x = tuple(L3)
10000 loops, best of 3: 19.6 ¬µs per loop
sage: %timeit x = BoundedIntegerSequence(8, L0)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.34 ¬µs per loop
sage: %timeit x = BoundedIntegerSequence(16, L1)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.57 ¬µs per loop
sage: %timeit x = BoundedIntegerSequence(32, L2)
100000 loops, best of 3: 2.06 ¬µs per loop
sage: %timeit x = BoundedIntegerSequence(32, L3)
10000 loops, best of 3: 76.7 ¬µs per loop
```
Conversion to a tuple seems to be roughly 4 times faster. But I don't think this will be critical (at least not in my own applications...)

__Conversion tuple/sequence -> list__

```
sage: %timeit x = list(T0)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 537 ns per loop
sage: %timeit x = list(T1)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 624 ns per loop
sage: %timeit x = list(T2)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 752 ns per loop
sage: %timeit x = list(T3)
100000 loops, best of 3: 22.6 ¬µs per loop
sage: %timeit x = list(S0)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.58 ¬µs per loop
sage: %timeit x = list(S1)
100000 loops, best of 3: 2.06 ¬µs per loop
sage: %timeit x = list(S2)
100000 loops, best of 3: 4.19 ¬µs per loop
sage: %timeit x = list(S3)
1000 loops, best of 3: 253 ¬µs per loop
sage: %timeit x = S0.list()
1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.05 ¬µs per loop
sage: %timeit x = S1.list()
1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.87 ¬µs per loop
sage: %timeit x = S2.list()
100000 loops, best of 3: 4.95 ¬µs per loop
sage: %timeit x = S3.list()
1000 loops, best of 3: 306 ¬µs per loop
```
The gap between lists and sequences strongly depends on the bound of the sequence, which is not much of a surprise. Anyway, it is faster than before.

__Slicing__

For step 1, short tuples are faster than short sequences, but long sequences are faster than long tuples:

```
sage: timeit("x=T0[:-1]", number=100000)
100000 loops, best of 3: 479 ns per loop
sage: timeit("x=T1[:-1]", number=100000)
100000 loops, best of 3: 548 ns per loop
sage: timeit("x=T2[:-1]", number=100000)
100000 loops, best of 3: 773 ns per loop
sage: timeit("x=T3[:-1]", number=100000)
100000 loops, best of 3: 19.6 ¬µs per loop
sage: timeit("x=S0[:-1]", number=100000)
100000 loops, best of 3: 1.75 ¬µs per loop
sage: timeit("x=S1[:-1]", number=100000)
100000 loops, best of 3: 1.8 ¬µs per loop
sage: timeit("x=S2[:-1]", number=100000)
100000 loops, best of 3: 1.77 ¬µs per loop
sage: timeit("x=S3[:-1]", number=100000)
100000 loops, best of 3: 2.4 ¬µs per loop
```
As before, a step different from 1 is bad for sequences. However, there is an improvement compared with the previous timings:

```
sage: timeit("x=T2[:-1:2]", number=100000)
100000 loops, best of 3: 944 ns per loop
sage: timeit("x=T3[:-1:2]", number=100000)
100000 loops, best of 3: 11.8 ¬µs per loop
sage: timeit("x=S2[:-1:2]", number=10000)
10000 loops, best of 3: 2.7 ¬µs per loop
sage: timeit("x=S3[:-1:2]", number=10000)
10000 loops, best of 3: 52.2 ¬µs per loop
```

__Accessing single items__

Bounded integer sequences can now compete with tuples, both short and long!

```
sage: timeit("x=T0[1]", number=1000000)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 349 ns per loop
sage: timeit("x=T0[4]", number=1000000)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 351 ns per loop
sage: timeit("x=S0[1]", number=1000000)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 354 ns per loop
sage: timeit("x=S0[4]", number=1000000)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 355 ns per loop
sage: timeit("x=T3[1]", number=1000000)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 346 ns per loop
sage: timeit("x=T3[4500]", number=1000000)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 347 ns per loop
sage: timeit("x=S3[1]", number=1000000)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 350 ns per loop
sage: timeit("x=S3[4500]", number=1000000)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 370 ns per loop
```

(True, True)
sage: S0z1 = S0+S0

```

Needs review, I think!

My first guess is that this comes from using `sage_malloc` in some places, i.e., I should zero the memory first.

Now I can explain what goes wrong in above example.

GMP has its limbs, and I have my sequence items. In the example, each item consumes 5 bit, but each limb comprises 32 bit. As it happens, the last bit of my last item is 0, and the last limb *only* stores this single zero bit. Hence, when I ask GMP to do high-level operations (which makes sense for concatenation, I wouldn't like to do it low-level), GMP tries to be clever and drops the last limb, since it is zero. But when I transform the result to a list, I want to access the last bit. But since the last bit is not in a limb any longer, it belongs to non-allocated memory. Hence, randomly, the last bit can be 0 or 1, which explains why in the example above the difference between the correct and the wrong last item is 16.

So, what I should do: When transforming a sequence to a string or list (or when iterating), I should check whether I am running outside of GMP's limbs. Alternatively, I should provide a bit 1 right behind of my last item, so that GMP will not drop the last limb (as I forced it to be non-zero).

Then, we need 35 bit to store the sequence.\n- At least on my machine, a GMP limb comprises 32 bit. Hence, the above sequence fits into two limbs, we only use three bit of the second limb.\n- Choose the last item of the sequence such that it fits into 2 bit. Then, the three bit stored in the second limb are zero.\n- Now, do an operation that involves a `mpz_*` function to create a new bounded integer sequence, *only* adding trailing zeroes. This currently is in concatenation and slicing. This may result in GMP cutting off the trailing zeroes.\n\nWhen we then do operations involving `mpn_*` functions, it is needed to take care of the cut off bits (and treat them as zero). My current private branch (not pushed yet) involves several tests that are failing with the branch currently attached here, but succeed in my current branch.\n\nStill failing is this:\n\n```\n            sage: X = BoundedIntegerSequence(21, [4,1,6,2,7,2,3])\n            sage: S = BoundedIntegerSequence(21, [0,0,0,0,0,0,0])\n            sage: loads(dumps(X+S))\n            <4, 1, 6, 2, 7, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0>\n            sage: loads(dumps(X+S)) == X+S\n            True\n            sage: T = BoundedIntegerSequence(21, [0,4,0,1,0,6,0,2,0,7,0,2,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0])\n            sage: T[3::2]==(X+S)[1:]\n            True\n            sage: T[3::2] in X+S\n            False     # should return True!\n```\n\nEDIT: Recall that providing bound 21 will internally changed into the next power of two, hence, 32.",

<a id='comment:80'></a>
Current status is a struggle with sub-sequence recognition in the presence of trailing zeroes.

Here is the type of examples that I propose:
- Use a sequence of length 7 with a bound of 32. Then, we need 35 bit to store the sequence.
- At least on my machine, a GMP limb comprises 32 bit. Hence, the above sequence fits into two limbs, we only use three bit of the second limb.
- Choose the last item of the sequence such that it fits into 2 bit. Then, the three bit stored in the second limb are zero.
- Now, do an operation that involves a `mpz_*` function to create a new bounded integer sequence, *only* adding trailing zeroes. This currently is in concatenation and slicing. This may result in GMP cutting off the trailing zeroes.

When we then do operations involving `mpn_*` functions, it is needed to take care of the cut off bits (and treat them as zero). My current private branch (not pushed yet) involves several tests that are failing with the branch currently attached here, but succeed in my current branch.

Still failing is this:

```
            sage: X = BoundedIntegerSequence(21, [4,1,6,2,7,2,3])
            sage: S = BoundedIntegerSequence(21, [0,0,0,0,0,0,0])
            sage: loads(dumps(X+S))
            <4, 1, 6, 2, 7, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0>
            sage: loads(dumps(X+S)) == X+S
            True
            sage: T = BoundedIntegerSequence(21, [0,4,0,1,0,6,0,2,0,7,0,2,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0])
            sage: T[3::2]==(X+S)[1:]
            True
            sage: T[3::2] in X+S
            False     # should return True!
```

EDIT: Recall that providing bound 21 will internally changed into the next power of two, hence, 32.

1000000 loops, best of 3: 216 ns per loop  # was 213 ns
sage: timeit("S3x in S3z2", number=1000)
1000 loops, best of 3: 2.33 ms per loop    # was 2.41 ms
```

So, overall, I think that the timings are still decent and it makes sense to use bounded integer sequences as replacement of tuples in some applications.

The problem is fixed. I inserted comments into the code that hopefully explain what happens in the subsequence containment test.

Doctests pass (including a new test that has previously failed), hence, it needs review again!

Since I cannot reproduce the problem myself, could you please help me by providing some internal data? Perhaps there are different architectures (32bit or 64bit, big or little endian) at work?

Please add the following as a method of `BoundedIntegerSequence`:

```python
    def inspect(self):
        cdef __mpz_struct seq
        seq = deref(<__mpz_struct*>self.data.data)
        print "bitsize",self.data.bitsize
        print "itembitsize",self.data.itembitsize
        print "mask_item", Integer(self.data.mask_item).binary()
        print "length", self.data.length
        print "GMP size", seq._mp_size
        print "GMP alloc", seq._mp_alloc
        print '.'.join([Integer(seq._mp_d[limb]).binary().rjust(mp_bits_per_limb,'0') for limb in range(seq._mp_size-1,-1,-1)])
```
With this, I get

```

Another interesting point is that the single limb used to store `S[1::2]` resp. `S[-1::-2]` on your machine is full of junk bits.

Anyway, what surprises me is the following: Up to know, all problems arose because of a misfit where two limbs meet. But here, for the first time, we have errors occurring in a *single* limb.

Hooray, I can reproduce the problem on my machine, with a different example!

The key is (as on your machine) to create a sequence that fits inside a single limb, an then slice:

```
sage: S = BoundedIntegerSequence(8, [4,1,6,2,7,2,5,5,2])
sage: S
<4, 1, 6, 2, 7, 2, 5, 5, 2>
sage: S[1::2]
<1, 6, 7, 7>
sage: S[-1::-2]
<2, 5, 7, 6, 7>
```
The sequence above is of length 9, with items fitting into 3 bit. Hence, 27 bit are used, whereas one limb comprises 32 bits.

So, stuff for debugging!

Hmm. Using, for example,

```python
    cdef mp_limb_t tmp_limb[1]
```
instead of

```python
    cdef mp_limb_t *tmp_limb
    tmp_limb = <mp_limb_t*>sage_malloc(sizeof(mp_limb_t))
```
compiles, but then it seems that the `mpn_*` functions do not correctly put values into the arrays, when I give them `tmp_limb` as argument.

Question to C/Cython experts: Is `tmp_limb` not just of type `<mp_limb_t*>` when I define `cdef mp_limb_t tmp_limb[1]`?

The stress test is really valuable. I found several small problems concerning corner cases. And, as I have announced, I have reworked the code so that only "proper" pointers rather than stupid references to local variables are passed around.

There remain problems, though. In the doctests, I have commented out the stresstest, because there are STILL crashes. This time, `mpz_clear` sometimes doesn't work. My wild guess is that at some point I write out of bounds when using `mpn_*`-functions.

In the new commit, I added assertions to make sure that I am not writing into non-allocated memory. So, the code should now be water proof in that regard.

All tests pass, including the "stress test". So, it can be reviewed now!

Question to the reviewer: Can the assertions be removed? After all, what is being asserted is just that some variables are correctly computed, but this can in principle be checked by reading the code. Or are assertions (even in relatively tight loops) cheap enough?

If you run `Python` with the option `-O`, all the assert calls are ignored. 
Something similar should be doable, at compile time of course, for Cython.

Most programming languages support this to encourage developpers to never remove asserts. We really should have this feature in Sage. A good starting point would be to have `sage -O` call `Python -O`.

The middle one is almost certainly an error, the other two don't look too good either.

Do I understand correctly: It means that `contains_biseq` could read and `concat_biseq` could write stuff in non-allocated memory?

Sigh. Could be that I even don't see where 1), 2) and 3) are in the valgrind log...

Concerning the invalid read of size 8 by `__gmpn_rshift`: I think I recall that at some point I wanted to avoid considering cases and thus allowed to rshift memory that partially is uninitialised, since after the shift I would only access the bytes that were allocated. Probably this is improper and should be fixed.

If it's an "invalid read of size 8" and "0 bytes after a block" in mpn_copyi, chances are it's not a bug. GMP/MPIR will sometimes read 16 aligned bytes at a time when there are just 8 bytes left to copy, on certain architectures where this is safe. This might be the case in mpn_rshift too.

If you're absolutely sure that your code should be correct there, you could try compiling MPIR with assembly optimizations disabled and see if the error goes away. Or easier, temporarily replace the mpn_rshift in your code with a plain C implementation (e.g. the one in mpn/generic/rshift.c in MPIR).

The "Conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised value" is absolutely a bug.

Replying to [vbraun](#comment%3A145):

Hmm. The conditional jump occurs in line 2828 of the c-file, but this is:

```
  /* "sage/misc/bounded_integer_sequences.pyx":398
 *             n += S1.itembitsize
 *     mpz_clear(tmp)
 *     return -1             # <<<<<<<<<<<<<<
 * 
 * cdef int index_biseq(biseq_t S, int item, size_t start) except -2:
 */   #### Here is 2828
  __pyx_r = -1;
  goto __pyx_L0;
```
Hm. Volker, could you provide the location of the conditional jump that is giving you the warning?

I had a chat with Nathann today. He asked me about the data structure used by GMP, which is mainly `long*` (aka "limb"), plus some information on the number of limbs used and the number of limbs allocated. `long*` is also used by `sage.misc.bitset`.

What I am implementing here is in fact quite similar to bitsets (one item of a bounded integer sequence corresponds to a chunk of bits, but otherwise it is the same). So, he suggested to not duplicate code, but make mutual use.

I have looked at the bitset code in the past, but apparently it was long before I implemented bounded integer sequences: Now I realize that much of what I do here is actually done in `sage.misc.bitset`!

Suggestion: I'll add to `sage.misc.bitset` what is not already there, and then `sage.misc.bounded_integer_sequence` will not provide all the boilerplate code, but only provide the Python layer to comfortably use bounded integer sequences.

By suggestion of Nathann, I am now reusing part of the existing code from `sage.misc.bitset`. Main advantage is the fact that (in contrast to the `mpz_*` functions) leading zeros will not be silently removed, which means that I could avoid many special cases.

Hopefully Nathann will find the new version of the code a lot less frightening than the old version...

Needs review again, and soonish I will update the timings that have occasionally been mentioned in comments above.

pickling) with the new code version (I am testing on the same laptop, thus,
hopefully a comparison makes sense):

--> All but the last became faster, which is excellent for my applications, as
I am using subsequence containment tests fairly often.

Additional timings for pickling, comparing Python lists with bounded integer
sequences:

```
sage: %timeit loads(dumps(L0))
10000 loops, best of 3: 39.5 ¬µs per loop
sage: %timeit loads(dumps(L1))
10000 loops, best of 3: 43.9 ¬µs per loop
sage: %timeit loads(dumps(L2))
10000 loops, best of 3: 65.5 ¬µs per loop
sage: %timeit loads(dumps(L3))
100 loops, best of 3: 2.13 ms per loop
sage: %timeit loads(dumps(S0))
10000 loops, best of 3: 68.7 ¬µs per loop
sage: %timeit loads(dumps(S1))
10000 loops, best of 3: 72.1 ¬µs per loop
sage: %timeit loads(dumps(S2))
10000 loops, best of 3: 87 ¬µs per loop
sage: %timeit loads(dumps(S3))
1000 loops, best of 3: 1.06 ms per loop
```
--> Pickling of short bounded integer sequences has an overhead, but longer
sequences are pickled faster, due to the more compact representation.

I think that one can say that the new code version results in an overall performance gain,
and I suppose it is less frightening now.

`mp_bits_per_limb` is not available from there, hence, I still import it from gmp.h.

For now I will not introduce a new `sage.data_structures`.

It makes no sense to first introduce a new module on this ticket and then make a new ticket to immediately move that new module somewhere else (requiring changing import statements and everything). If it were an existing module, things would be different.

The problem with `src/sage/misc` is that it contains a lot of various things. Usually "misc" is used when something doesn't belong to any other category. But it's clear that there are a lot of modules defining data structures in `misc` (but also other stuff like `temporary_file`). I think it makes sense to group these in `src/sage/data_structures` (or another name, whatever) instead of dumping everything in `misc`.

Except that the new ticket is not just about moving `sage.misc.bounded_integer_sequences` to `sage.data_structures.bounded_integer_sequences`, but moves a whole lot more.

On THIS ticket, it does not make sense to dooe the big move from `sage.misc` to `sage.data_structures`, since this ticket is about introducing bounded integer sequences

The problem is that `mp_bits_per_limb` is about the number of bits in `mp_limb_t`, not the number of bits in `int`. And using `int` for indices is inconsistent with Python which uses `Py_ssize_t` (which should be the same as `mp_size_t`).

I would say: when in doubt between `mp_size_t` and `mp_bitcnt_t`, use `mp_size_t`.

When in doubt between `int` and anything else: use the anything else.

You mean, in particular, that I should *not* use it for an index? Hence, if I want to refer to bit number `b` in limb number `l`, then both `b` and `l` should be `mp_size_t`? Currently, I try to consistently use `mp_bitcnt_t` for `b` and `mp_size_t` for `l`.

There may be a problem with either `int` or `mp_limb_signed_t`: If the bound for the integer sequence is very large, then a single item would fill a whole `mp_limb_t`. However, this would not fit into a *signed* int/limb.

So, at the moment, it seems to me that `ctypedef mp_limb_t biseq_item_t` is preferred. Since the `__repr__` method is not time-critical, I suggest to do the transformation from `mp_limb_t` to a nicely printed type there.

Add that the items in the sequence are non-negative integers and that `itembitsize` is in `[1 .. GMP_LIMB_BITS]` (assuming both these statements are true).

And I guess that `mask_item` equals `limb_lower_bits_up(itembitsize)`, where `limb_lower_bits_up` is the function defined in `src/sage/misc/bitset.pxi`.

It could be that you just spotted a bug (corner case). I define it as `((<mp_limb_t>1)<<itembitsize)-1`, which is `limb_lower_bits_down`. And that's to say: If the itembitsize is mp_bits_per_limb (which should be allowed), then the mask is 0, but it should be all bits 1.

Trying to construct a test to see if it really is a bug...

In fact, it does not check overflow of the arguments.

Overflow checking of the arguments should happen in *calling* the function, not in the function itself.

Also note that Cython always does overflow checking when converting from Python types to C types, but not by default between C types.

`BoundedIntegerSequence.__iter__` and `biseq_to_list` would probably become
slower. Currently, one limb is shifted with mpn_rshift, and then all items in
this limb are extracted by `>>` in this single limb, before mpn_rshifting the
next limb. If I understand correctly, you are planning to replace this by
`biseq_getitem`, which means that you mpn_rshift a limb and extract the first
item of it, then mpn_rshift the same limb again for the second item.

I suppose repeated use of mpn_rshift is slower than a single mpn_rshift
followed by repeated single-limb-`>>`.

Perhaps we should consider to change the hash function for bitsets (see the comments for the hash of bounded integer sequences that you removed). But I suppose this should not be done on this ticket.

My summary:
- We have different functions that assume that the given sequences have equivalent bounds. In most cases, the assumption is not checked, with exception of the one assert that you introduced. I vote for removing the assert.
- I don't think iteration should use `biseq_getitem` to extract items one by one. Instead, the current idea ("shift enough data so that one limb is full and extract items from this single limb") should be preserved.
- I like your change to `biseq_getitem`, where you avoid using `mpn_rshift` for just one/two limbs. I think the same change could be done in `biseq_slice` in the case `step!=1`, and also in iteration.

Other than that, your changes seem fine to me. I suggest to do the "replacement of one/two limb shifts", unless you beat me to it.

sage: timeit('list(B)')
125 loops, best of 3: 1.73 ms per loop

sage: timeit('B.list()')
625 loops, best of 3: 1.1 ms per loop
sage: timeit('list(B)')
125 loops, best of 3: 1.91 ms per loop
```

2. With 88e5ecaa30a54cfadbfe4fc1c0ee6d1840041ee8:

As you can see, I implemented `biseq_getitem()` much faster than that, so I doubt there is still a slowdown for using repeated calls to `biseq_getitem()`.

I am going to leave this ticket alone for at least a few days.

I do think there is still a lot of improvement, mainly simplification:
1. Implement `biseq_setitem()` and use that in a lot of places.
2. Implement `mpn_equal_bits_shifted()` to compare bit patterns efficiently for equality and use this for `biseq_max_overlap` and `biseq_contains`.

`BoundedIntegerSequence` was (originally) thought of as being immutable (it is hashable). Hence, so far, I only see application in `biseq_init_list` and `biseq_slice`. OK, that's something...

More generally: if you have `cdef` or `cpdef` functions returning nothing and you don't require exception handling, then using `void` as return type is more efficient (without it, the functions return the Python value `None`).

Sure. But you did `item_limb = item` without testing whether `item > bound`, which means that item_limb could end up *below* the bound. Hence, you'd have the random truncation that you wanted to avoid.

Not true because the assignment `item_limb = item` is a Python -> C conversion which is always checked:

```
--> Became perhaps slower.

What does that all mean?

For my applications not very much, actually, because what I care about is not
initialisation from lists and direct item access and not slices with step
different from one, but I do care about:
- Testing for subsequence containment, comparison and hash
- Slicing with step one
- Concatenation.

So, I leave it up to you whether clarity of code is more important than the
above slow-down...

I have implemented `mpn_equal_bits_shifted`. I do *not* use `mpn_rshift`
followed be `mpn_cmp`, since this would mean to touch each limb twice (once
for shifting, once for comparison), even if the difference occurs early in the
sequence. Of course, using such function simplifies the code of
`biseq_contains` and `biseq_max_overlap` considerably.

Here I redo the containment tests from [comment:157](#comment%3A157), giving timings with the new
code and (in brackets) with the previous code (I would not directly compare
with [comment:157](#comment%3A157), since the previous code differs too much from the code back
at [comment:157](#comment%3A157)).

```

So, there is a very clear improvement, and this time it concerns a function
that I use very extensively in my applications.

Jeroen, I think that with the new commit I addressed all of your concerns,
hence, for now I will move on to the follow-up tickets (i.e., cythoned quiver
paths and the non-commutative F5 algorithm that is not on trac yet).

Problem: We would need a bitset primitive that shifts a *part* of a bitset S. Currently, `bitset_rshift` shifts all of S, not just a part of S.

I see four ways to proceed:
- Write a new primitive `bitset_rshift_subset`, which means code duplication
- Add an optional argument to `bitset_rshift`, which means that all places using this function must be changed.
- Change `bitset_rshift` so that no assumption on the size of source and target are needed: We just shift the minimum of the number of limbs that is available in the source and of the number of limbs that fits into the target.
- Do not use bitset primitives in `biseq_slice`.

In the new commits I addressed (I hope) all issues that we discussed yesterday
and today.

Timings without the new commits:

```
sage: from sage.data_structures.bounded_integer_sequences import BoundedIntegerSequence
sage: B = BoundedIntegerSequence(27, [8, 8, 26, 18, 18, 8, 22, 4, 17, 22, 22, 7, 12, 4, 1, 7, 21, 7, 10, 10])
sage: %timeit B.list()
1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.64 ¬µs per loop
sage: %timeit list(B)
100000 loops, best of 3: 2.57 ¬µs per loop
sage: %timeit B[2:-2]
1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.13 ¬µs per loop
sage: L = [randint(0,7) for _ in range(1000)]
sage: %timeit B = BoundedIntegerSequence(8, L)
100000 loops, best of 3: 13 ¬µs per loop
sage: B = BoundedIntegerSequence(8, L)
sage: %timeit B.list()
10000 loops, best of 3: 31.5 ¬µs per loop
sage: %timeit list(B)
10000 loops, best of 3: 55 ¬µs per loop
sage: %timeit B[3:800]
1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.26 ¬µs per loop
```

And with the new commit:

```
sage: from sage.data_structures.bounded_integer_sequences import BoundedIntegerSequence
sage: B = BoundedIntegerSequence(27, [8, 8, 26, 18, 18, 8, 22, 4, 17, 22, 22, 7, 12, 4, 1, 7, 21, 7, 10, 10])
sage: %timeit B.list()
1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.6 ¬µs per loop
sage: %timeit list(B)
100000 loops, best of 3: 2.62 ¬µs per loop
sage: %timeit B[2:-2]
1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.12 ¬µs per loop
sage: L = [randint(0,7) for _ in range(1000)]
sage: %timeit B = BoundedIntegerSequence(8, L)
100000 loops, best of 3: 11.5 ¬µs per loop
sage: B = BoundedIntegerSequence(8, L)
sage: %timeit B.list()
10000 loops, best of 3: 30.8 ¬µs per loop
sage: %timeit list(B)
10000 loops, best of 3: 64.9 ¬µs per loop
sage: %timeit B[3:800]
1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.27 ¬µs per loop
```

Apparently, creation from a list became faster, iteration over a long
list became 10% slower (but in my appliations, I do not iterate over the items
of a bounded integer sequence, hence, I don't care about the slow-down), and
everything else did not change significantly.

And the code became clearer, which is a plus. I hope you'll find that my
changes to `bitset_rshift` and `bitset_lshift` make sense.

If the result of the shift would exceed the size of ``r``, then it

```
There are no assumptions on the sizes of ``a`` and ``r``.
Bits which are shifted outside of the resulting bitset are discarded.

Modulo this comment about `biseq_init_slice`, I think the public biseq interface looks good.

I have not looked at all the changes of the last few days and I don't feel like doing that now. I do plan to review this ticket in some time with a fresh look (of course, other reviewers are always welcome). In any case, I think the current branch works well enough that you can use it for your other tickets.

Dear Jeroen,

thank you for reviewing!

Replying to [jdemeyer](#comment%3A350):
> We are still missing `sig_*` functions to allow interrupts. But I prefer for you to review my changes before adding those.


- You changed the location of the (old) function `bitset_fix`. Why? Won't that increase the likelihood of a merge conflict?

- When reading the function name `biseq_reverse_contains`, I'd expect that it either checks for containment of a reverse subsequence, or it checks for containment of a subsequence starting at the end of the supersequence. Both is not the case. What this function determines is an overlap of the end of first and the beginning of the second argument. That said, I don't think the new function name is worse than the old.

The other changes seem at least reasonable, some are needed. Thanks for spotting it.

In any case, there will be a merge conflict with the next follow-up ticket. But I guess it can hardly be avoided. I think we can now take care of signal handling.

And one thing is not correct in the description of `biseq_reverse_contains`:

```
  Return ``i`` such that the bounded integer sequence ``S1`` starts with
  the sequence ``S2[i:]``, where ``start <= i < S2.length``, or return
  ``-1`` if no such ``i`` exists.
```
If you apply the function (whatever it is named) to `<2,3,2,3,1>` and `<1,2,3,2,3>` (I just notice that you also exchanged the r√¥les of `S1` and `S2`!), then I want it to yield the *maximal* overlap: It should return 1, not 3. That's not clear from the new description.

By the way: Note that I've formulated error messages such as `ValueError: BoundedIntegerSequence.index(x): x(=32) not in sequence` by taking tuples as good example:

```

Your error message is more similar to what is done for lists:

But that's not more than a side-note. I accept your change.

Because I think the new location is better than the old one, it seemed out of place in the list of functions to generate limb patterns.

Well, every change increases the likelihood of a merge conflict...
But I don't know of any other tickets changing bitset code, so it won't be that bad.

Well, the thing that bothered me most about the old `biseq_max_overlap` function was the implicit start index of 1, which is unexpected (why 1?) and couldn't be changed (unlike `biseq_contains`).

I changed the names and ordering of the arguments to make it more clear that `biseq_contains` and `biseq_reverse_contains` are in fact very similar: the first finds `i` such that `S1[i:]` starts with `S2`, the second finds `i` such that `S1` starts with `S2[i:]`.

I'm certainly open for changes, I just would like the functions to be as intuitive as possible for people *not knowing about your application of quiver algebras*. For example, the word "overlap" doesn't mean anything to me when you talk just about sequences of integers.

Here I disagree. If I have two lists A and B, then the statement "A overlaps with B" makes immediate sense to me. The only open question is whether "A overlaps with B" means that the overlap of the two lists is supposed to be at the end of A or at the end of B.

I think it's a bad idea.

Look at the following (now removed) code from you:

```
if other.startswith(self):
    return self
cdef mp_size_t i = biseq_max_overlap(self.data, other.data)
```
Note that the case `i == 0` of `biseq_max_overlap(B, A)` corresponds to `biseq_startswith(A, B)`. An unexpected reordering in my opinion.

In my proposal, the three functions `biseq_startswith`, `biseq_contains` and `biseq_reverse_contains` (whatever the name) all check whether some part of `S1` starts with some part of `S2`. The only thing that changes is which parts of `S1` and `S2` are considered.

Since yesterday evening, I tried for about 20 times to push my changes (implementing interrupt stuff). But it doesn't work. Any idea why?

As usual, the error message is not very helpful:

```

Is that a problem on my side, or on trac?

Unfortunately it does NOT test that bounded integer sequence operations are interruptible. I tested a couple of times, and the exception always occurs in the randint function.

I also tested a bit more and the exception indeed happens most often in `randint()` but also sometimes in other places.

Should we add tests in the spirit of this:

Indeed there is an obvious overlap. If I understand correctly, #17013 uses `char *` as underlying data structure, which means they are restricted to an alphabet of length at most 255. I have experimented with a similar implementation, too, but found that an implementation based on gmp gives better speed than what I was able to obtain with `char*`.
