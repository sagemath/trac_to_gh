As [originally reported](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-devel/LmO_-WcvqJk/discussion) on sage-devel, error and warning messages during documentation build have to be improved.

Either the actual line number in the source file or some context has to be shown instead of an offset in an unknown docstring.

Printing a message in the very end of the output about encountered errors and warnings also would be helpful, although not as crucial.

Keywords: **sd53**

Component: **documentation**
