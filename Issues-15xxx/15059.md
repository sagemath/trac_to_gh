Fixed. The patch was uploaded twice due to connection issues; it's one and the same file nevertheless.

The issue at hand was that the `__call__` method of class `MPowerSeries` (elements of multivariate power series rings) calls the `subs` method of polynomials, but this method behaves somewhat unpredictably as concerning the parent of its output: If the input is a constant polynomial, it does not change the base ring (even if the substitution should send polynomials from ZZ to polynomials from ZZ/5ZZ):

```
sage: K.<x,y> = PolynomialRing(ZZ)
sage: T.<u,v> = PolynomialRing(Integers(5))
sage: parent(x.subs(x=u, y=v))
Multivariate Polynomial Ring in u, v over Ring of integers modulo 5
sage: parent(K.one().subs(x=u, y=v))
Integer Ring
```

Note that this issue only appears with multivariate polynomials. Univariate ones substitute fine.

Is my fix misguided in that it fixes the symptom rather than the cause?
