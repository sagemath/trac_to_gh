Currently, if a cached method or function is created, an instance of `sage.misc.function_mangling.ArgumentFixer` is created as well. But this is only needed when the cached function/method is actually called.

With this patch, the `ArgumentFixer` is either created when it is needed to normalise arguments (i.e., when the function is called), or when a `CachedMethodCaller` is bound to an instance. The latter is because different `CachedMethodCaller`s bound to different instances share the `ArgumentFixer` with the `CachedMethod` that is bound to the class of the instances. Hence, it is reasonable to avoid creating the same `ArgumentFixer` repeatedly.

Without the patch, more than 500 `ArgumentFixer`s are created during startup of Sage. This is expensive, because one needs to determine the argspec of the cached functions/methods (this may even involve reading source code!!). With the patch, only 6 `ArgumentFixer`s are created.

It seems to me that I observe a decrease of startup time of 4 or 5 percent with my patch, but I'd like to know whether the patchbots confirm this.

Startup time is not everything, I think we should also test that there is no big regression in *calling* a cached method.

With the patch:

```
sage: @cached_function
....: def f(a,b=1):
....:     return 1
....: 
sage: class C:
....:     @cached_method
....:     def a(self):
....:         return 1
....:     @cached_method
....:     def b(self, a,b=1,*args,**kwds):
....:         return 2
....:     
sage: c = C()
sage: %timeit f(1)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 916 ns per loop
sage: %timeit f(1,2)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 984 ns per loop
sage: %timeit f(a=1,b=2)
100000 loops, best of 3: 2.56 us per loop
sage: %timeit c.b(1,x=4)
100000 loops, best of 3: 2.8 us per loop
sage: %timeit c.b(1,4)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 886 ns per loop
```

Without the patch:

```
sage: c = C()
sage: %timeit f(1)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 922 ns per loop
sage: %timeit f(1,2)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 975 ns per loop
sage: %timeit f(a=1,b=2)
100000 loops, best of 3: 2.42 us per loop
sage: %timeit c.b(1,x=4)
100000 loops, best of 3: 2.86 us per loop
sage: %timeit c.b(1,4)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 991 ns per loop
```

I think this is fine. So, if the startup time would really improve by a couple percent, it would be a good progress.

Unfortunately, the patchbot does not confirm what I saw when I've run `sage -startuptime` a couple of times with and without the patch. Anyway, I think the approach of this patch is still valid.

Hey Simon,

Here are my timings with patch (same setup):

```
sage: %timeit f(1)
100000 loops, best of 3: 1.37 us per loop
sage: %timeit f(1,2)
100000 loops, best of 3: 1.5 us per loop
sage: %timeit f(a=1,b=2)
100000 loops, best of 3: 3.73 us per loop
sage: %timeit c.b(1,x=4)
100000 loops, best of 3: 4 us per loop
sage: %timeit c.b(1,4)
100000 loops, best of 3: 1.67 us per loop
```
and without:

```
sage: %timeit f(1)
100000 loops, best of 3: 1.44 us per loop
sage: %timeit f(1,2)
100000 loops, best of 3: 1.55 us per loop
sage: %timeit f(a=1,b=2)
100000 loops, best of 3: 3.79 us per loop
sage: %timeit c.b(1,x=4)
100000 loops, best of 3: 4.02 us per loop
sage: %timeit c.b(1,4)
100000 loops, best of 3: 1.64 us per loop
```
So I don't see any (statically) significant speed regression, nor do I expect a couple of simple C-level if statements to slow anything down. I also get a modest startup-time improvement of about 5%, so I'm happy with this patch.

Best,

Travis
