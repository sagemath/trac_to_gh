Hmmmmmmmm.... `O_o`

Actually I wonder if those methods shouldn't be deprecated first, as those who used them may not know where they moved... `O_o`

I used ``deprecated_callable_import`` in #14499, isn't it what should be used there too ?

What do you mean ?

These functions are not deprecated, it's their import in the global namespace that is.

By the way, even after these patch, some of them will still be imported in the global namespace, and a follow-up ticket will be needed. I prefer to proceed step-by-step.
