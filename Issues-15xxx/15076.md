Oh I see ! But then why don't we just remove the deprecated version of the functions too ? It looks like the deprecated functions are not in the namespace anymore, but that they are still defined -- and deprecated somewhere `O_o` ?

What do you mean ?

These functions are not deprecated, it's their import in the global namespace that is.

By the way, even after these patch, some of them will still be imported in the global namespace, and a follow-up ticket will be needed. I prefer to proceed step-by-step.

Oh. Well, what I wondered is which part of the code deprecated the version of these `is_*` functions that appears in the global namespace. I wondered why this code would not be removed by the current patch.

But I just noticed that it was actually a global piece of code, which deprecated all these `is_*` functions together, and thus is not to be removed by this patch.

Anyway : all is good, and this patch can go. My excuses for the delay `;-)`
