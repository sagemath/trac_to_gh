The build system #14796 works better with some minor tweaks to some spkg-install scripts.

- with idempotence, "keepbuilt" starts to make sense
- without hardwired paths, compiling with packages disabled (=fallback to system) works
- with environment in `$SAGE_ETC/env.d/*`, run time environment is more flexible
- with a list of files that belong to a package, unstaging is easy.
- setting write permissions for copied files allows cleanup, even if the source files are not writable

these changes are minimal (for each package) and are intended to not break the old build system. This is a series of individual patches. Opening up ~100 tickets doesn't seem appropriate.
