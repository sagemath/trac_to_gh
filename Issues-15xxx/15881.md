For a long time now, Sage graphs have often been drawn with loops cut off.  This is because the axes are decided based on the positions of the vertices, without accounting for loops.  This idea fixes it:

```
def loop_graph_plot(g, **options):
    p=g.graphplot()
    loopsize=p._options['loop_size']
    q=p.plot()
    r=q.get_axes_range()
    q.set_axes_range(xmin=r['xmin']-loopsize,xmax=r['xmax']+loopsize,ymin=r['ymin']-2*loopsize)
    return q

g = Graph({1:[0,1]})
show(loop_graph_plot(g))
```

I think the relevant changes should be made in `sage/graphs/graph_plot.py`.

Thanks to Leslie Hogben for pointing this out (among others over the years).

I did several trials (e.g., adding loops to a 2 by 2 grid) and don't see any cut off on loops.

If no-one can reproduce the issue, may be we can close this ticket.
