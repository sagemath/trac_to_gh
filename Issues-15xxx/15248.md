Sounds good so far. Now let's do this all again, in the same session:

RuntimeError: There is a bug in the coercion code in Sage.
Both x (=1) and y (=x) are supposed to have identical parents but they don't.
In fact, x has parent 'Lazy Power Series Ring over Rational Field'
whereas y has parent 'Lazy Power Series Ring over Rational Field'
Original elements 1 (parent Lazy Power Series Ring over Rational Field) and x (parent Lazy Power Series Ring over Rational Field) and maps
<type 'NoneType'> None
<type 'sage.categories.morphism.CallMorphism'> Call morphism:
  From: Lazy Power Series Ring over Rational Field
  To:   Lazy Power Series Ring over Rational Field
```

This error does not persist if I set M to be `Matrix(R, [[x, x], [x, x]])` instead, so the coercion of 1 from integers to lazy power series seems to trigger the issue.

Classic example of constructing "unique" objects over "non-identical-but-equal" bases. Excellent find! It's well-known this is bound to give problems, but I'm not sure we had such a clear example yet.

```
sage: R.<x>=LazyPowerSeriesRing(QQ)
sage: S.<x>=LazyPowerSeriesRing(QQ)
sage: R is S
False
sage: R == S
True
```

```
sage: MR=MatrixSpace(R,2,2)
sage: MS=MatrixSpace(S,2,2)
sage: MR is MS
True
```
Since `R==S`, the construction of `MS` will return MR again. So `MS` has `R` as a base, not `S`:

```
sage: MS.base() is R, MS.base() is S
(True, False)
```
After this it's unavoidable:

```
sage: S.0 + R.0
RuntimeError: There is a bug in the coercion code in Sage.
Both x (=x) and y (=x) are supposed to have identical parents but they don't.
```
and you're hitting a more insidious form with

```
sage: MR(R.0)
[x 0]
[0 x]
sage: MS(S.0)
RuntimeError: There is a bug in the coercion code in Sage.
```
