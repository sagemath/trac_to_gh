This is a follow-up to the ticket #15050. Apart from the methods changed in #15050, there are five more methods of ToricVariety_field, namely

`Todd_class, Chern_class, Chern_character, Kaehler_cone, Mori_cone`

which use private variables for caching and procedure errors when pickled.
This fix follows the same logic as #15050 and rewrites the caching using the decorator cached_method.

So the better solution is: provide `CPRFanoToricVariety_field_with_category` with a reduce method that ensures that attributes such as `_dimension_relative` (probably all attributes required for computing a hash) get initialized in the construction phase and leave the rest of the dictionary to be initialized at the `setstate` phase.

As you can see from these example, this is required for proper pickling anyway because you would want

```
loads(dumps(variety.Todd_class()))
```
to work and it's not clear to me that clearing caches is going to resolve that issue.

Whether you want to strip the dictionary offerered by `reduce` for pickling of caches is a separate question.

Replying to [vbraun](#comment%3A4):
> In theory, I would agree that one needs to implement `__reduce__` (basically, for all classes that inherit from UniqueRepresentation). 


In fact, `UniqueRepresentation` should be particularly easy to pickle: the weak cache that gets used to see if objects already exist has the parameters used to instantiate them already cached as a key! If the objects in there have sane pickling themselves (and they should, because they're hashable, and hence fairly immutable, so their important properties haven't changed since they have been created, so any potentially circular stuff can go into setstate), a reasonable set of pickling parameters is already there! It may be worthwhile to see if `UniqueRepresentation` could offer a default `reduce` that gets a little towards that concept.

**EDIT:** And in fact, `CachedRepresentation` already implements this! See `sage/structure/unique_representation.py, line 560:

```
    def __classcall__(cls, *args, **options):
...
        if instance.__class__.__reduce__ == CachedRepresentation.__reduce__:
            instance._reduction = (cls, args, options)
...
    def __reduce__(self):
        return (unreduce, self._reduction)
``` 
So it's already doing that. It also means that the default pickling is throwing away the dictionary, which may be a bit rough.

By the way, toric varieties don't inherit from UniqueRepresentation.
Their cohomology rings do, though, so you're probably running into this issue because toric varieties get hashed there (and in similar constructions).

> 1. It is really hard to doctest. Not only must you restore all the data for the hash, but if there is a hash collision then you also need all the data for `__cmp__()`. 


If our design decisions are being affected by whether something is hard to doctest then we really have cart and horse in the wrong order.
Let's see. `ToricVariety_field` has these creation parameters:

```
fan, coordinate_names, coordinate_indices, base_field
```
You got to be able to decide equality based on these.
The last 3 should definitely not introduce circularities in their construction phases. Let's look at `fan`:

```
cones, rays, lattice
```
Again, those should be the only parameters involved in the construction phase of a fan. The rest can go into setstate.
I don't know exactly what things you need to define `cones, rays, lattice`, but it seems like those should also be strictly non-circularly constructible (any caches you might want to pickle can go into `setstate`).

> 2. In practice, Python doesn't support circular `__reduce__` so we'll end up just triggering that bug.


And every time you're getting that (and we'd hope we run into an error report, because the silent failures are really painful), it's an indication that you got your `construction/setstate` balance wrong.

Given that the very nature of Python (and any normal programming language), any circular reference is always inserted by *modifying* and existing object(*). That's what `setstate` in pickling is for.

(*) There's of course Simon's example

```
class circ(object):
    def __init__(self,i)"
        self.i=i
        self.d={self:1}
```
which indeed seems like circularity-upon-construction, but the key here is that no circular input data is needed to complete the construction.

I think this is actually an important issue: pickling is really valuable, especially because of the ever increasing importance on parallel processing, which tends to require interprocess communication. I don't think what we need to do is complicated or a lot of work. It's just that people need to get some experience and examples in what to do.

I'd happily write a patch, on this ticket, but the git branch stuff is beyond me.

Probably something like the following on `CPRFanoToricVariety_field` already does the trick:

```
    def __getnewargs__(self):
        return (self._Delta_polar,self._fan,self._coordinate_points,self.__point_to_ray,
                self._names,<whatever you need to get coordinate indices>,self._base_ring)
```
and indeed, you're going to need one of those for pretty much every `__init__` you write...

In a way, the problem comes from `CategoryObject`, where `__hash__` is defined in terms of `repr`, so in a way that's where pickling is broken. So perhaps we should have a `__getnewargs__(self)` there, a la:

```
    def __getnewargs__(self):
        return self._initargs
```
in which case of course we also need something along the lines of

```
    def __init__(self,*args,**kwargs):
        self._initargs=args
        self._initkwargs=kwargs ##we may need a custom reduce here: how do we deal with kwargs otherise?
```
CategoryObject already has custom `__getstate__` and `__setstate__`. It's just that its pickle process doesn't seem to have been written with in mind that `__hash__` might be needed prior to `__setstate__` executing. Incidentally, `CategoryObject` caches the hash value, so if we have the following reduce method on `CategoryObject` we might skirt at least the premature hash problem:

```
  def __reduce__(self):
    return <constructor>,(type(self.C),...,self.hash(),),self.__dict__
```
where `<constructor>` is some factory that reconstructs the object (essentially via an empty `__new__`) but then, in addition, sets `self._hash`.

I don't think this ticket itself needs work, but that we need more info on how to solve the problem properly. If we can tackle it on `CategoryObject` we may not need to do anything on `ToricVariety`.

The only thing in ToricVariety that refers back to itself are caches, if it weren't for that it would be perfectly safe to pickle it by its dict. I don't think its a good solution to have everybody write a custom pickling just to manually exclude caches. 

Also, all the changes in the attached branch are desirable anyways, so we should include them. Any further discussion of general frameworks for pickling should go elsewhere (perhaps #15156).
