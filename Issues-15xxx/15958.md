There is a bug in the implementation of the product in partition algebras.

```
sage: A = PartitionAlgebra(1,17)
sage: g = SetPartitionsAk(1).list()
sage: a = A[g[1]]
sage: a
P[{{-1}, {1}}]
sage: a*a
P[{{-1}, {1}}]
```

This should return

```
17*P[{{-1}, {1}}]
```

First of all, bugs fixed should be doctested to ensure that they don't reappear when someone later copies bad code (or for other reasons). Second, there is no good reason to check for `len(part_list) > 0` after a call to `part_list[0]`; that test should have been removed rather than corrected. (By the way, this was already inside an `if len(part_list) > 0` clause...) Finally, the code is (for some reason) duplicated in `partition_algebra.py`; I don't have the time to track down the reasons of this duplication, but I've fixed the bug over there as well.\n\nBad news is that someone else will have to review this ticket now. :)",
