Neither OSX nor Sage ship with fontconfig, but it is sometimes picked up from third-party distributions (leading to compile failures). Disable on OSX by default.

Note that upstream changed from "gd" to "libgd", we should probably update (but on another ticket).

The building was this time success with the proposed change.

Please, see the log which came to the terminal with many warnings, however not relevant to this ticket:
https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/62073194/install_terminal.log
I think these warnings are coming from bad practices used in third-party packages.

Please, see the autogenerated log which confirms that there were no errors in building Sage with the change proposed by Volker Braun:
