Neither OSX nor Sage ship with fontconfig, but it is sometimes picked up from third-party distributions (leading to compile failures). Disable on OSX by default.

Note that upstream changed from "gd" to "libgd", we should probably update (but on another ticket).

<a id='comment:6'>Comment 6:</a>
The building was this time success with the proposed change.

Please, see the log which came to the terminal with many warnings, however not relevant to this ticket:
https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/62073194/install_terminal.log
I think these warnings are coming from bad practices used in third-party packages.

Please, see the autogenerated log which confirms that there were no errors in building Sage with the change proposed by Volker Braun:
