<a id='comment:6'></a>The building was this time success with the proposed change.

Please, see the log which came to the terminal with many warnings, however not relevant to this ticket:
https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/62073194/install_terminal.log
I think these warnings are coming from bad practices used in third-party packages.
