A quick search found http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=14997 which looks of interest.
I'll try lowering the optimization level.

Obviously, we need a lot more information in the ticket description, in particular Solaris version, gcc version, full build log of ncurses... because it works on some Solaris/SPARC systems.

Can we simply disable the "Ada" part of ncurses, that is almost certainly not needed.

Disabling ada by passing --without-ada solves this, but it fails when building the wide version of ncurses (enabled by #15080):

I see: when the wide version is built, -DXOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED is passed again (don't know yet from where though).

So getting a narrow version by disabling ada is easy.
Not sure about the wide version yet, nor if that's even possible.

I've reported the two problems upstream.
Thomas is very reactive and I'm sure it will be fixed in a few days, so we could just package the dev release then (and that would also fix the ncurses issue from #15317).

Still packaging an spkg for testing in between (without the #15317 fix).
