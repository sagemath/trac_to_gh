A quick search found http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=14997 which looks of interest.
I'll try lowering the optimization level.

Obviously, we need a lot more information in the ticket description, in particular Solaris version, gcc version, full build log of ncurses... because it works on some Solaris/SPARC systems.

Can we simply disable the "Ada" part of ncurses, that is almost certainly not needed.

Disabling ada by passing --without-ada solves this, but it fails when building the wide version of ncurses (enabled by #15080):

I guess the "/usr/include/stdlib.h" might be the problem.
I think I already had problems on this machine with Singular including stuff from /usr/include and stumbling upon an old version of GCC which was problematic/incompatible.

I see: when the wide version is built, -DXOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED is passed again (don't know yet from where though).

So getting a narrow version by disabling ada is easy.
Not sure about the wide version yet, nor if that's even possible.

Not sure where my post went, but here was the solution I used:
in case wide characters have to be used, _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED should be added to CFLAGS (so that gcc gets it) and not to CPPFLAGS (or g++ will get it).

I've reported the two problems upstream.
Thomas is very reactive and I'm sure it will be fixed in a few days, so we could just package the dev release then (and that would also fix the ncurses issue from #15317).

Still packaging an spkg for testing in between (without the #15317 fix).
