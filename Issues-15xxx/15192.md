Currently, residue fields have no `is_unit`:

```
sage: K.<z> = CyclotomicField(7)
sage: P = K.factor(17)[0][0]
sage: ff = K.residue_field(P)
sage: a = ff(z)
sage: a.is_unit()
NotImplementedError
```

They are fields but the implementation from `Fields.ElementMethods` is not used because the generic ring class defines a trivial `is_unit()` already. This ticket moves that method to the category of rings which gives a working `is_unit()` for residue fields.

I think there is a more fundamental problem: in your example,

```
sage: isinstance(a, FieldElement)
False
```
The class `FieldElement` does have an `is_unit()` method that does the right thing, but evidently it is not used because of this.

That's scary.

> Finite field elements should be made to inherit from field elements!

I agree. I wonder if there is a reason why they don't?

In any case, should `Ring` really define `is_unit`? Isn't the idea that elements figure these things out depending on their parent, i.e., whether they are a unit depends on the parent. Putting this into the category framework seems to be the right thing. (Notice that `is_unit` was already there for `Fields()`). So is there any benefit of such an implementation in `Ring`? Don't all rings live in the category of `Rings()` now?

That is clear; talking about elements doesn't even make much sense without mentioning parent sets.  But there isn't really any 'figuring out' to be done here: if the element knows that it is a field element, then it knows that being a unit is equivalent to being non-zero.

I don't agree, for the same reason why I wrote the comment at [#13441 comment:20](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/13441#comment:20).  Parents describe relations between elements; e.g. a ring is a set whose elements satisfy certain axioms.  Categories are on a higher level; they describe relations between objects, and it shouldn't matter too much what the elements of these objects are, or even if the objects are sets at all.

Whether an element is unit depends on relations satisfied *within* its parent, not on  relations between the parent and *other* parents.  In other words, the category its parent is in should not play any role.  It is true that some categories (like the category of rings) *are* in a sense defined by relations between the *elements* of objects, but exploiting this to influence the behaviour of elements is confusing two different levels of abstraction, in my opinion.

Hence, I don't see a good mathematical reason for putting methods in `Ring.ElementMethods` instead of `RingElement`.  I can see why one would want a `Category` to have `ObjectMethods` (which are now called `ParentMethods`) and perhaps `MorphismMethods` (which only exist in a doctest).  With `ElementMethods`, however, I somehow get the feeling that the authors of the category framework are aiming for world domination!

Yes, but `FieldElement` still has its own `is_unit()`.  I would expect that `RingElement` should have one, too, and that these are the correct locations for these methods, rather than `*.ElementMethods`.

> So is there any benefit of such an implementation in `Ring`? Don't all rings live in the category of `Rings()` now?

Maybe, but I don't think this is a good argument for using the category framework here.  I think the benefit of putting ring element methods in `RingElement` is that it simply seems the most logical place.

Sorry for the long sermon; this might have been more appropriate for a sage-devel discussion...

Sure, I'd be happy if more people gave their opinion on this, and if someone who knows more about the category framework (maybe one of the authors) could explain the reason for `ElementMethods`.

I can post a message to sage-devel, but won't have a lot of time to write more.
