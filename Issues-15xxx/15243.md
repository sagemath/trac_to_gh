As shown by #14476, it is annoying that the following depends on the hardware:

```
sage: K.<t> = NumberField(x^4 - x^3 - 3*x^2 - x + 1)
sage: [K.uniformizer(P) for P,e in factor(K.ideal(5))]
```

Moreover, the algorithm for `K.uniformizer()` seems inefficient: instead of calling `idealappr()`, we can simply use the second component of the `pari_prime()` structure. Experiments show that this yields equal results for 32-bit and 64-bit machines (but there is no guarantee).

I am pretty confident in that but will check.  The machine is at home though, and I no longer have a 32-bit desktop in my office, so cannot do it before this evening.

It's certainly getting harder to test 32-bit builds these days!
