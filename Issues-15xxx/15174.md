This patch does the following:

* Open up a way to circumvent the (in the opinion of several people) broken multiplication of permutations (see #14885 and https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/sage-devel/permutations/sage-devel/tAAb42Edh9o/T-htA50IOZEJ ). To remind, the issue is twofold: first, the default order in which Sage multiplies permutations is rather unusual to anyone not from the English school of notation; second, the order depends on a global variable which can be changed at runtime, which makes it unpredictable and a pain to rely on. I don't address the first of these issues in my patch, but I ameliorate the second one: There are now global-independent methods `left_action_product` and `right_action_product` on permutations (these are just aliases for the already existing methods `_left_to_right_multiply_on_left` and `_left_to_right_multiply_on_right`, but are now documented and non-underscored; besides I hope that my names are clearer), and more importantly on symmetric group algebras (these are not just aliases anymore; the only multiplication method which we used to have on symmetric group algebras depended on the global). These can be used instead of the badly predictable `*` operator (they're even a bit faster by virtue of not branching on the global variable).

* Improve documentation at a few places in `combinat/permutation.py` and `combinat/symmetric_group_algebra.py`. These are minor fixes, but constitute most of the size of the patch.

* Add methods related to the Reiner-Saliola-Welker conjectures: The number of noninversions of a permutation; the antipode of the symmetric group algebra; the Reiner-Saliola-Welker shuffling operators (as elements of symmetric group algebras); and some elements which can be used to factor the latter.

More work done, mostly on the permutohedron order docstrings. I was surprised to learn that "permutohedron order" is the French name for the weak order; this answers my question why the weak order isn't in Sage (it is, under this name...).

The patch is ready for review.

Hey Darij,

Here's a review patch which does a few changes and docstring touchups. More specifically:

* I reworked the documentation for `left/right_action_product`,
* added a `noninversions()` methods, and
* changed `noninv()` to `number_of_noninversions()` since it is ambiguous (to me).

If you agree with my changes, you can go ahead and set this to a positive review.

Best,

Hi Travis,

thanks a lot for reviewing this!

I'm unsure about this:

```
         This is usually denoted by either ``self * lp`` or ``lp * self``
         depending on the conventions used by the author. If permutations
         are to act on numbers from the left in an associative way, the
-        correct notation for this is ``self * lp``. If permutations are
-        to act on numbers from the right in an associatve way, the
-        correct notation for this is ``lp * self``.
+        correct notation for this is ``self * lp``. If permutations are to
+        act on positions from the left in an associative way, the correct
+        notation for this is ``lp * self``.
```
What do you mean by "act on positions"? Something like "pi sends psi to pi \circ psi^(-1)"? But then we would have to add an ^{-1}... IMHO my original docstring was clearer. I don't understand the "More specifically" explanation either...

Also, the docstring of `noninversions` might use an `r"""`. I'm not near a functioning hg installation right now, or I'd do that myself.

  Best regards,\\
  Darij

Hey Darij,

There are two ways one permutation can act on another, by position  (or by index) and by value (or by number as you put it). Acting on the right by one is equal to acting on the left by the other and can be seen from the permutation matrix multiplication (see Section 1.4 in Artin's *Algebra* for example). My "More specifically" block was trying to explain these two different approaches and could likely use improvement. (I'm used to my permutations acting by position.)

Your docstring ended up confusing me since the name of the method is (for example) `left_action_multiply` and it's talking about left and right actions by number. I think we should do the mantra: "Here is how we define the left action". Additionally what I was trying to change was to give justification as to why the other notation would be used and get the same result.

I'll change the docstring of `noninversions` once we settle on the above.

Also since the "invalid state" errors are in an `else:` block, they never get called unless there is an internal error. In other terms, it's not actively testing for anything. I'd be fine changing them to `assert` statements, but that would be a cosmetic change.

Best,

Travis

Hi Travis,

what do you think about this? Note that I have removed the "More specifically" paragraphs because I couldn't really understand them, but I think I'm as specific as possible now.

I couldn't resist adding a docstring to the Hecke algebra class after noticing that it, too, would break if a nonstandard order of multiplication was chosen (this, too, is fixed now). Sorry for the feature creep! In other news, this patch probably kills all but 2-3 spots in the source where the `mult` global option on `Permutations` is inappropriately used. I'll open further tickets for the rest.

The change of "integral" to "integers" is due to the fact that "integral" means "integral over ZZ" for some people. I was probably over-careful here.

Hey Darij,

Replying to [@darijgr](#comment:14):
> I didn't want to talk of the multiplication as being an action itself (I talked of the multiplication playing nicely with the action on integers, which is a simpler thing), since IMHO that would only add to the confusion. But if you can explain it nicely, I think it would be a good addition. Can you make a little review patch for this?

Sure.

> Good point; I'll do it later today (I hope). Meanwhile do you agree with my last patch? (I'd like to qfold everything we have done so far on the ticket.)

Yes, everything looked good in it. Please fold it all together.

Best,

Travis

I still don't get your note about products of permutations. Particularly the second paragraph:

```
 	382	        In more detail using one-line notation, if we have two permutations 
 	383	        `p \cdot q` and multiplying on the right by numbers, then the 
 	384	        resulting permutation is determined for any fixed `j` by sending 
 	385	        `p_j = q_i \mapsto q_{i+1}` for some (unique) `i` where we take the 
 	386	        indices cyclicly (i.e. `n + 1 \equiv 1`). If we consider this as 
 	387	        multiplying on the left by position, we determine the resulting 
 	388	        permutation by `q_{p_i} \mapsto q_{p_{i+1}}` over all `i` (again 
 	389	        taking the indices cyclically).
```

Sorry, but I don't have much of a clue what you mean here :/ What is the `q_i \mapsto q_{i+1}` thing about? Are your permutations supposed to be cycles written in cycle form?

Also, "surpressed" should be "suppressed". The rest of the edits is definitely good.
