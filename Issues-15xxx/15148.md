Harvey's hypellfrob program is shipped with Sage but was not actually used to count points on hyperelliptic curves.

This ticket intends to fix that (and add several other minor improvements).

When you only want the number of rational points (and not the complete zeta function) you can use a (g times) lower precision. In this case you shouldn't use .frobenius_polynomial but ._frobenius_matrix and compute the trace of this matrix.

It is not necessary to exclude the case n>2g, but in this case (and already for n>=g) it is probably better to use .frobenius_polynomial and compute the number of points by expanding a power series (as we discussed in Rennes).

So: 

1) for n<g use ._frobenius_matrix to compute matrix F and compute the traces of F, ... ,F^n.

2) for n>=g use .frobenius_polynomial and compute the coefficients of the log of the zeta function.

Would you like to change this, or can I give it a try? (I'm at SAGE days this week, trying to do something useful)
