I have chosen to implement the distribution independent build system with autotools. It turns out that two changes considerably simplify issues.

- change the suffix for .pyx files that are intended to be compiled to c++ code. automake derives the build rules from this suffix, not from meta information.
- don't use `lib[a-z]*.pyx` as the filenames for cython code. libtool will confuse the resulting plugins with shared libraries.

These changes are pretty small and can be tested/reviewed/merged independently.

this thread is relevant, but it's mostly about cython bug 655 (=writing out dependencies for builds involving cython).

this ticket patches cython (4 lines) to fix a different issue. commit `@`74c837c makes `cythonize` work on files with arbitrary extensions. and thus work after appending x to files containing cython code meant to be translated to c++. for sage, this patch is meant to facilitate a transition from distutils to a (make based) build system. it's simply allowing them to coexist (and is not required after a transition).

i expect that cython developers will merge this patch (or some variant), if they see flexibility as improvement (e.g. like Robert has merged the patch that unhardwires the debugger output path, https://github.com/cython/cython/pull/247). alternatives may exist of course, i didn't find them...
