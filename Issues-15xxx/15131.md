This ticket implements the Hazewinkel Lambda basis of QSym -- one of the multiplicative (in an appropriate sense) bases of QSym defined over any ring.

It also fixes a misbehavior of the shuffle product class, in which the following would throw an error:

```
sage: from sage.combinat.words.shuffle_product import ShuffleProduct_w1w2
sage: ShuffleProduct_w1w2(Compositions(2)([1,1]), Composition([1])).list()                 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)
...
ValueError: [1, 1, 1] not in Compositions of 2
```
The fix might not be optimal but at least it does the trick.

*Note:* You can call the Hazewinkel Lambda basis using `QuasiSymmetricFunctions(base_ring).HazewinkelLambda()`. I have not included it in the `inject_shorthands()` methods to not pollute the memory with its cache when it is not needed.

Hey Darij,

This needs a (very) trivial rebase over #13505. Here are also some things from glancing over the patch file:

- Could you move the documentation for the basis from the `__init__()` into the class doc and just put a `TestSuite(HWL).run()` test for the `__init__()`?
- `__init_extra__()` needs doctests.
- The `EXAMPLES::` block on line 2280 has an extra colon.
- In `shuffle_product.py` line 141, same thing with the `TESTS::` block.

I'll do the full review once these are taken care of. Thanks for the continued work on (Q)Sym.

Thanks,

Travis
