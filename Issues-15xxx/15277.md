Currently we have:

```
sage: CM = CartanMatrix([[2,-1,0,0],[-3,2,-2,-2],[0,-1,2,-1],[0,-1,-1,2]])
sage: CM
[ 2 -1  0  0]
[-3  2 -2 -2]
[ 0 -1  2 -1]
[ 0 -1 -1  2]
sage: CM.dynkin_diagram().edges()
[(0, 1, 3),
 (0, 2, 0),
 (0, 3, 0),
 (1, 0, 1),
 (1, 2, 1),
 (1, 3, 1),
 (2, 0, 0),
 (2, 1, 2),
 (2, 3, 1),
 (3, 0, 0),
 (3, 1, 2),
 (3, 2, 1)]
```
The edges with the label of 0 should not be included.

Sounds good!

While we are at it, what about using the following idiom:

```
    for (i,j) in M.nonzero_positions():
        ...
```

Granted, exploiting sparseness here is essentially an eye candy:
we are not really likely to compute the dynkin diagrams of many large sparse cartan matrices where this would actually do a difference timewise. But still an eye candy :-)

Hello,

Looks good to me. I have added a small review patch.

1) removing an unused import of sgn

2) computing the value of ct, where it was needed

3) removing the variable n

If you agree with these details (found with pyflakes), you can set positive review
