As per Burcin, with the option of the `algorithm` keyword for `_evalf_` in #12289,

```
ATM, if you implement different backends, you need to write a lot of
boilerplate code in _evalf_() to parse the algorithm argument, do the
right thing if it is not given etc. Can we have a default _evalf_
method, which dispatches to _evalf_<system>_ methods if they exist and
raise error if not? Perhaps we can also figure out how to annotate
these methods to indicate if they support arbitrary precision
evaluation or not.
```

    if hasattr(self, '_evalf_scipy_') and (some_condition_on_parent_and_algorithm):

1. Does this mean you would find any mechanism doing recognition of implemented algorithms or call dispatch that exists apart from your hardcoded solution dangerous/superfluous/..?
2. What is your opinion regarding such a mechanism dealing with `eval` (i.e., non-fp) algorithms? This concerns #17489, with possible implementation in #17531. (This may be fast in `__call__`, with only a dictionary lookup.)
