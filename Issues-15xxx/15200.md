As per Burcin, with the option of the `algorithm` keyword for `_evalf_` in #12289,

```
ATM, if you implement different backends, you need to write a lot of
boilerplate code in _evalf_() to parse the algorithm argument, do the
right thing if it is not given etc. Can we have a default _evalf_
method, which dispatches to _evalf_<system>_ methods if they exist and
raise error if not? Perhaps we can also figure out how to annotate
these methods to indicate if they support arbitrary precision
evaluation or not.
```

I think the best solution would be to hardcode a set of common algorithm/parent choices like:

```python
def _evalf_(self, *args, parent=None, algorithm=None):
    if hasattr(self, '_evalf_scipy_') and (some_condition_on_parent_and_algorithm):
        return parent(self._evalf_scipy_(*args))
    if hasattr(self, '_evalf_mpmath_') and (some_condition_on_parent_and_algorithm):
        return parent(self._evalf_mpmath_(*args))
    [...]
    return self._evalf_default_(*args, parent=parent, algorithm=algorithm)

I would propose to use this only for `_evalf_` but possibly extend `_evalf_` to non-fp arguments. See also the discussion about `NumberTheoreticFunction` (whatever the name) in #17489.
