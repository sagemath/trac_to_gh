As per Burcin, with the option of the `algorithm` keyword for `_evalf_` in #12289,

```
ATM, if you implement different backends, you need to write a lot of
boilerplate code in _evalf_() to parse the algorithm argument, do the
right thing if it is not given etc. Can we have a default _evalf_
method, which dispatches to _evalf_<system>_ methods if they exist and
raise error if not? Perhaps we can also figure out how to annotate
these methods to indicate if they support arbitrary precision
evaluation or not.

This patch works for `BuiltinFunction`. Unfortunately it breaks `GinacFunction` (since they often don't define an `_evalf_` method, they don't overwrite the `_evalf_` in the base class) and gives an error as in #14743 on startup:

```
Exception AttributeError: "'builtin_function_or_method' object has no attribute 'func_code'" in 'sage.symbolic.function.SymbolicFunction._hash_' ignored
```

I think the best solution would be to hardcode a set of common algorithm/parent choices like:

```python
def _evalf_(self, *args, parent=None, algorithm=None):
    if hasattr(self, '_evalf_scipy_') and (some_condition_on_parent_and_algorithm):
        return parent(self._evalf_scipy_(*args))
    if hasattr(self, '_evalf_mpmath_') and (some_condition_on_parent_and_algorithm):
        return parent(self._evalf_mpmath_(*args))
    [...]
    return self._evalf_default_(*args, parent=parent, algorithm=algorithm)
```

1. Does this mean you would find any mechanism doing recognition of implemented algorithms or call dispatch that exists apart from your hardcoded solution dangerous/superfluous/..?
2. What is your opinion regarding such a mechanism dealing with `eval` (i.e., non-fp) algorithms? This concerns #17489, with possible implementation in #17531. (This may be fast in `__call__`, with only a dictionary lookup.)
