<boilerplate>
As detailed in #14885, it is not healthy for code to rely on the `__mul__` operation on permutations, since this operation depends on the `Permutations().global_options()['mul']` variable which can change at runtime. It is better to use the `left_action_product` and `right_action_product` methods introduced in #15174 (formerly known as `_left_to_right_multiply_on_left` and `_left_to_right_multiply_on_right`).
</boilerplate>

The branch I'll attach later today sets out to solve this issue in `sage/groups/braid.py`. In all methods whose result depends on the `mult` global variable, the user can now set a local variable `mult` to override the global one, and this is explicited in the docstrings. (Also, some speedups have been achieved, most noticeably in the `permutation()` method which now runs about 8 times faster since permutations are being composed by list operations rather than multiplied as permutations.)

**WARNING:** Please read the TODO part I left in the comments to the sourcecode of the `_left_normal_form_perm_` method. I am not sure of my fix there and would prefer someone who knows what this method does to look over it (and document the method while at that).

sage: %timeit B5([1,-2,1]).permutation()
1000 loops, best of 3: 619 us per loop
sage: %timeit B5([1,-4,2,-3,2,1,2]).permutation()
1000 loops, best of 3: 1.13 ms per loop
sage: %timeit B5([1,2,4,1,-3,-1,2,1,-3]).permutation()
1000 loops, best of 3: 1.38 ms per loop
sage: %timeit B5.one().left_normal_form()
1000000 loops, best of 3: 266 ns per loop

sage: %timeit B5([1,-4,2,-3,2,1,2]).left_normal_form()
100 loops, best of 3: 6.67 ms per loop
sage: %timeit B5([1,2,4,1,-3,-1,2,1,-3]).left_normal_form()

1000 loops, best of 3: 381 us per loop
sage: %timeit B5._permutation_braid_Tietze(Permutation([5,4,3,2,1]))
1000 loops, best of 3: 1.1 ms per loop
```

after:

```
sage: B5 = BraidGroup(5)
sage: %timeit B5.one().permutation()
10000 loops, best of 3: 44.6 us per loop
sage: %timeit B5([1,-2,1]).permutation()
1000 loops, best of 3: 349 us per loop
sage: %timeit B5([1,-4,2,-3,2,1,2]).permutation()

sage: %timeit B5.one().left_normal_form()
1000000 loops, best of 3: 418 ns per loop
sage: %timeit B5([1,-2,1]).left_normal_form()
100 loops, best of 3: 2.16 ms per loop
sage: %timeit B5([1,-4,2,-3,2,1,2]).left_normal_form()
100 loops, best of 3: 5.06 ms per loop
sage: %timeit B5([1,2,4,1,-3,-1,2,1,-3]).left_normal_form()
100 loops, best of 3: 6.29 ms per loop
sage: %timeit B5._permutation_braid_Tietze(Permutation([1,2,3,4,5]))
10000 loops, best of 3: 46.6 us per loop
sage: %timeit B5._permutation_braid_Tietze(Permutation([3,1,4,2,5]))
10000 loops, best of 3: 50.9 us per loop
sage: %timeit B5._permutation_braid_Tietze(Permutation([5,4,3,2,1]))
10000 loops, best of 3: 58.8 us per loop
```

If you are wondering why `B5.one().permutation()` is taking that long... well, it used to give the identity permutation in the `0`-th symmetric group; now it gives that in the `5`-th symmetric group. I think the latter makes more sense.
