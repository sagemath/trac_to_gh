1000000 loops, best of 3: 418 ns per loop
sage: %timeit B5([1,-2,1]).left_normal_form()
100 loops, best of 3: 2.16 ms per loop
sage: %timeit B5([1,-4,2,-3,2,1,2]).left_normal_form()
100 loops, best of 3: 5.06 ms per loop
sage: %timeit B5([1,2,4,1,-3,-1,2,1,-3]).left_normal_form()
100 loops, best of 3: 6.29 ms per loop
sage: %timeit B5._permutation_braid_Tietze(Permutation([1,2,3,4,5]))
10000 loops, best of 3: 46.6 us per loop
sage: %timeit B5._permutation_braid_Tietze(Permutation([3,1,4,2,5]))
10000 loops, best of 3: 50.9 us per loop
sage: %timeit B5._permutation_braid_Tietze(Permutation([5,4,3,2,1]))
10000 loops, best of 3: 58.8 us per loop
```

If you are wondering why `B5.one().permutation()` is taking that long... well, it used to give the identity permutation in the `0`-th symmetric group; now it gives that in the `5`-th symmetric group. I think the latter makes more sense.
