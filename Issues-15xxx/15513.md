Implement generic (univariate?) polynomial factorization algorithms
over ground fields obtained through standard constructions.

Rationale: factorization is a fundamental building block of computer
algebra. Students and colleagues are stumbling over this over on this
missing feature while playing with not so exotic fields built from
standard ones.

Here is for example a translation in Sage of my old favorite demo in
MuPAD illustrating constructions and generic algorithms:

```
    sage: Qx.<x> = QQ[]
    sage: Qxz.<z> = Qx.fraction_field()[]
    sage: F.<z> = Qxz.quo(z^2-x)
    sage: P.<u> = F[]
    sage: z*u   * z
    x*u
    sage: (u^2 - x^3).factor()     # Should return (u + x z) (u - x z)
    *NotImplementedError*
```

TODO: review the literature, what's already implemented, and what
could be; provide examples in each case. Split the ticket as
appropriate.

# Factorization over a transcendental extension F(x)

Assuming one can factor (univariate) polynomials over F, implement
factorization for (univariate) polynomials over F(z).


# Factorization over an algebraic extension F(a)

Assuming one can factor (univariate) polynomials over F, implement
factorization for (univariate) polynomials over F(a).

Taken from the MuPAD library:

```
  faclib::algfactor(a,flag) factors the polynomial a in F(alpha)[z]
  or tests it for irreducibility only, depending on flag 
  
  Input: a is a bivariate polynomial in z and alpha, 
         flag: TRUE or FALSE
  Output: if flag <> FALSE then list of factors of a
          if flag is FALSE then TRUE if a is irreducible
				FALSE if a is reducible

  Reference: Geddes et al, Algorithms for Computer Algebra, algorithm
  AlgebraicFactorization page 383
```

# Factorization over polynomial rings F[...]

```
    sage: K.<x0,x1> = QQ[]
    sage: R.<x> = K[]
    sage: factor(x^2 - (x0+x1)*x)
    NotImplementedError
```

# Special case: bivariate polynomials

```
  factorization of bivariate polynomials over a field F
             or of univariate polynomials over F[y]

  The algorithm implemented in faclib::FACTOR is based on Hensel lifting
  and short vector computation. It works for the factorization of an
  univariate polynomial over F[y][x] over any ring y. 
  Reference: von zur Gathen, Hensel and Newton Methods in Valuation Rings, Math.Comp.
		166(1984), pp. 637-661.
  The complexity is O(n^6 m^2 + n log q) operations in F_q when
  F=F_q, and where n = deg(f,x) and m = deg(f,y).
```

# Some old data points

For the record, there has been progress lately, with factorization
implemented in more situations. Here are examples that used to fail
with Sage 5.8 and work with Sage 6.4:

```
    sage: Px.<x> = QQ[]
    sage: Qx = Px.fraction_field()
    sage: Qxz = Qx['z']
    sage: z = Qxz.gen()
    sage: (z^2-x).factor()
```

+Implement a generic implementation of univariate polynomial

+Rationale: factorization is a fundamental building block of computer

+    x*u
+    sage: (u^2 - x^3).factor()     # Should return (u + x z) (u - x z)
+    *NotImplementedError*
+```
+
+It would be nice to further support base rings which themselves
+support factorization:
+
+```
+    sage: K.<x0,x1> = QQ[]
+    sage: R.<x> = K[]
+    sage: factor(x^2 - (x0+x1)*x)

+
+```
+    sage: Px.<x> = QQ[]
+    sage: Qx = Px.fraction_field()

Replying to [@jdemeyer](#comment%3A19):
> This is still way too general. I think the two examples you mention really should be 2 tickets, and those tickets should be just about those examples, nothing too general.

I agree we could split a second ticket for factorization over a ring. But for fields I don't see how it is too general: as far as I know, there exist generic algorithms that cover all cases.

Tracking progress, and keeping a trace of history. For example, people may stumble on similar issues with various versions of Sage and want to report it. And learn from the ticket "nice, my special case is now fixed, but I should be careful because not all cases are".

And honestly I don't see, with the new layout, what disadvantage there can be of having this information.

Anyway, I am bailing out of this discussion. It's not my area, I have tried to bring in as much useful information I could, if you know better how to lay it out so that the job gets done, go ahead.

I have very strong doubts about this. Factorization algorithms over `CC`, over `QQ` and over `GF(q)` are very different, so I don't see how one algorithm could work in all cases.

There are generic algorithms for factorization of multi-variate polynomials, assuming you can do uni-variate factorization. Perhaps that's what you had in mind?
