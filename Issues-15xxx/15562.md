Oops, I confused two tickets. #14912 does not change cachefunc.pyx.

Anyway, if you tell me how to build the pdf documentation, I can soon give a positive review (the doc fix is straight forward and of course correct, but nonetheless I should see the actual pdf).

`\RequirePackage{ifthen}` does not result in an error when I put it into a TeX file.
