This is a followup to #8392 which will do the following:

- Undeprecate the `robinson_schensted()` method for permutations.
- Add a `robinson_schensted()` method for words and integer matrices and anything else that should be accepted as input into RSK.
- Improve the documentation on the RSK function.

Hi Travis,

Please change the following:

- In the documentation of robinson-schensted in finite_words it says

```
   Return the pair of semistandard tableaux obtained by running the
   Robinson-Schensted algorithm on ``self``.
```
However, the recording tableau in this case is always standard and not semistandard!

- Please add some tests to show that RSK and its inverse are indeed inverses. Make a comment in the documentation about the unusual input conventions which prevents RSK_inverse(RSK(..)) to be the identity!

Happy birthday!

Anne

Hey Anne,

Done. I also changed the output from EG insertion to a list which is how reduced words are represented.

Thank you in advance; my birthday is tomorrow (well, at least tomorrow in most of North America).
