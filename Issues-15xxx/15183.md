```
Currently, ``IntegerModRing`` refines its category if asked for membership in ``Fields()``:

```
sage: M = IntegerModRing(3)
sage: M.category()
Join of Category of commutative rings ...
sage: M in Fields()
True
sage: M.category()
Join of Category of fields ...
```

The same does not happen for ``IntegralDomains()``:

```
sage: M = IntegerModRing(5)
sage: M.category()
Join of Category of commutative rings ...
sage: M in IntegralDomains()
False
sage: M.category()
Join of Category of commutative rings ...
```

The changes on this ticket copy the logic from fields over to integral domains.

Depends on #14482

The main problem for me is that it uses git, and as much as I know, the "master" branch in the trac-git version of Sage does not pass tests.

Hence, I currently have no version of Sage which I could use to test your changes. And besides, my knowledge of git is too little to really understand what has changed and what happened in a dependency.

In any case, are you really sure that `IntegralDomains()` needs the refinement? The reason for introducing the refinement in testing containment in `Fields()` was the fact that `Fields.__contains__` does some pretty custom things, that are really slow, unless the objects's category is properly initialised.

But `IntegralDomains` has no custom implementation of `__contains__`. So, could you elaborate a bit more on the reason of your suggestion?

I see.

> Hence, I currently have no version of Sage which I could use to test your changes. And besides, my knowledge of git is too little to really understand what has changed and what happened in a dependency.

You could use `./sage --dev diff --base=dependencies` to see the changes introduced on the ticket itself. (with a recent version of #14482, like the one on this ticket, i.e., do `sage -b` before using this command)

> In any case, are you really sure that `IntegralDomains()` needs the refinement? The reason for introducing the refinement in testing containment in `Fields()` was the fact that `Fields.__contains__` does some pretty custom things, that are really slow, unless the objects's category is properly initialised. Hence, the idea was to "cache" the result of the slow test by refining the category, so that next time the slow test will be avoided.

What does `Fields.__contains__` do? It calls `.is_field()` which might be expensive (e.g. in the case Z/nZ). Integral domains should do the same, call `.is_integral_domain()` which is as expensive.

> But `IntegralDomains` has no custom implementation of `__contains__`. So, could you elaborate a bit more on the reason of your suggestion?

I believe that's why the check `IntegerModRing(2) in IntegralDomains()` failed, right?

No, it calls `sage.rings.ring._is_Field`, and this is where `.is_field()` might be called and the refinement might happen.

Am I correct that this would pull into my "public/sage-git/master" branch, but would not affect the other branch called "master"?

I am sure that one branch was obtained from github and the other from trac, and it is a shame that it can't clearly (at least to my understanding) tell which is which.

Category refinement involves changing the **class** of an object after creation, and actually after **usage**! Python lets you do those things, but really it is a dangerous hack.\n\nWe have seen cases in which the hash of a parent depends on the class of the parent. Hence, if a category refinement happens after (or while) using a parent P as key of a dictionary, it used to be possible that P was put in the wrong hash bucket of the dictionary. Fortunately, someone (I think it was Volker) added a security layer, so that now changing the class results in an error if it changes the hash.\n\nBut apart from hash, one often sees the following in `__cmp__` methods:\n\n```python\ndef __cmp__(self, other):\n    c = cmp(type(self),type(other))\n    if c:\n        return c\n    return cmp(<data for self>,<data for other>)\n```\nHence, if you add category refinement, comparison could break: Imagine you originally had `cmp(self,other)==0` and then did `self in IntegralDomains()` (triggering a category refinement) but didn't `other in IntegralDomains()`. Now, ask `cmp(self,other)`: The result will *not* be zero any more!\n\nMathematically, a category refinement should be fine, and one may think that the category framework is designed to be stable against category refinement (\"if you refine the category of P, then P may inherit different methods from the category framework than before, but these new methods will fit better.\"). However, some of these methods do caching. Hence, if P originally belongs to category C1 and it got some method `meth()` which did some caching, and then you refine P's category to be C2, so that P now inherits a *different* version of `meth()` that uses a different cache, then you have a mess.\n\nOne could argue that it is a bug if you *do* get a mess upon category refinement. But perhaps it is wise to not consciously ask for trouble...\n\n> and on the other hand Fields already do it.\n\nYes, I know, I have to take the full blame...\n\nBut the situation was different than the situation here!\n\nWhen I introduced category refinement for fields, `Fields.__contains__` used to be custom since a long time. This custom method was very very slow, but the default `__contains__` method couldn't be used unless all parents' categories were fully initialised. But then, the initialisation took too much time. Hence, I went for a compromise: Keep initialisation fast, and accept that the *first* `Fields()` containment test is slow; but in case of success, make sure that all further containment test will be quick.\n\nI was motivated by a concrete example that was important to a \"powerful\" Sage sub-community (you know, elliptic curves and so on): This example became way too slow after implementing the category framework for all rings. Reason: Initialisation of these rings took way too long, since for each ring it was needed to test whether the modulus is a prime number. Guided by this example (and a similar example for matrix spaces) I found that a \"lazy\" category initialisation can avoid certain severe regressions.\n\nHowever, here, things are different: As much as I understand, the suggestion is to let `IntegralDomains()` have a custom `__contains__` method, just because `Fields()` has a custom `__contains__` method too. But since `Category_singleton.__contains__` is very very fast, it should not be overridden by a custom `__contains__` without a very very good and compelling reason. It could actually be that some examples will become *slower* when the containment test will regress.\n\nPut differently: I haven't seen any concrete \"real world\" example that shows that we need lazy category initialisation for (some) integral domains. Without such example, I'd say we should better not open Pandora's box again.",

Replying to [@nathanncohen](#comment:23):
> Okay guys, it looks like Nicolas says that category containment should *not* refine the category,

For good reason! Category refinement involves changing the **class** of an object after creation, and actually after **usage**! Python lets you do those things, but really it is a dangerous hack.

We have seen cases in which the hash of a parent depends on the class of the parent. Hence, if a category refinement happens after (or while) using a parent P as key of a dictionary, it used to be possible that P was put in the wrong hash bucket of the dictionary. Fortunately, someone (I think it was Volker) added a security layer, so that now changing the class results in an error if it changes the hash.

But apart from hash, one often sees the following in `__cmp__` methods:

```python
def __cmp__(self, other):
    c = cmp(type(self),type(other))
    if c:
        return c
    return cmp(<data for self>,<data for other>)
```
Hence, if you add category refinement, comparison could break: Imagine you originally had `cmp(self,other)==0` and then did `self in IntegralDomains()` (triggering a category refinement) but didn't `other in IntegralDomains()`. Now, ask `cmp(self,other)`: The result will *not* be zero any more!

Mathematically, a category refinement should be fine, and one may think that the category framework is designed to be stable against category refinement ("if you refine the category of P, then P may inherit different methods from the category framework than before, but these new methods will fit better."). However, some of these methods do caching. Hence, if P originally belongs to category C1 and it got some method `meth()` which did some caching, and then you refine P's category to be C2, so that P now inherits a *different* version of `meth()` that uses a different cache, then you have a mess.

One could argue that it is a bug if you *do* get a mess upon category refinement. But perhaps it is wise to not consciously ask for trouble...

> and on the other hand Fields already do it.

Yes, I know, I have to take the full blame...

But the situation was different than the situation here!

When I introduced category refinement for fields, `Fields.__contains__` used to be custom since a long time. This custom method was very very slow, but the default `__contains__` method couldn't be used unless all parents' categories were fully initialised. But then, the initialisation took too much time. Hence, I went for a compromise: Keep initialisation fast, and accept that the *first* `Fields()` containment test is slow; but in case of success, make sure that all further containment test will be quick.

I was motivated by a concrete example that was important to a "powerful" Sage sub-community (you know, elliptic curves and so on): This example became way too slow after implementing the category framework for all rings. Reason: Initialisation of these rings took way too long, since for each ring it was needed to test whether the modulus is a prime number. Guided by this example (and a similar example for matrix spaces) I found that a "lazy" category initialisation can avoid certain severe regressions.

However, here, things are different: As much as I understand, the suggestion is to let `IntegralDomains()` have a custom `__contains__` method, just because `Fields()` has a custom `__contains__` method too. But since `Category_singleton.__contains__` is very very fast, it should not be overridden by a custom `__contains__` without a very very good and compelling reason. It could actually be that some examples will become *slower* when the containment test will regress.

Put differently: I haven't seen any concrete "real world" example that shows that we need lazy category initialisation for (some) integral domains. Without such example, I'd say we should better not open Pandora's box again.

Simon made a good point. I did this for consistency with Fields. I see now that it is better not to introduce this change.
