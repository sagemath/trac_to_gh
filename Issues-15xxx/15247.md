Since some while, we have `sage.categories.category_singleton.Category_singleton`. A singleton is a class that allows the creation of exactly one instance (of any subclass). The technical implementa
tion of `Category_singleton` is roughly like this: In some static `__classcall__`, test that the given class is a direct subclass of `Category_singleton`; then create a (the) instance of the class;
then set the override the classcall of this class and of the class of the instance (which might be a subclass) by a constant function returning the instance.

I suggest to provide this construction scheme generally, in `sage.misc.fast_methods.SingletonClass`. The idea is: If one write a class inheriting from `SingletonClass` then one does not need to think about caching the unique instance or writing a fast hash or writing fast comparison, since this will all be inherited from `SingletonClass`.

I suggest to use it at least on the rational field, which currently has a custom cache, and its hash method is written in Python.

With the branch that I am going to add, I get

```
sage: %timeit RationalField()
1000000 loops, best of 3: 269 ns per loop
sage: %timeit hash(QQ)
10000000 loops, best of 3: 134 ns per loop
sage: %timeit QQ==ZZ
10000000 loops, best of 3: 144 ns per loop
```

With vanilla sage-5.12.b5, it is a lot slower:

```
sage: %timeit RationalField()
10000 loops, best of 3: 82.4 us per loop
sage: %timeit hash(QQ)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 496 ns per loop
sage: %timeit QQ==ZZ
1000000 loops, best of 3: 878 ns per loop
```

There were several hash tests to fix. In all cases, I stopped comparing against a particular number, because
1. the number depends on the architecture (32- versus 64-bit)
2. the number does not show how the hash function works
3. one should test the result of `hash` against the hash function of the class being tested---otherwise (and this happened in at least three examples) one might test an instance of the wrong class.

The tests should work now.

I would say this is okay as you can always override `__eq__` as necessary, and python's default is to do equality check by id.

> * I don't like having the same explanations and/or tests repeated in several docstrings. I tried to remove redundancies in c5acb88a and 949b7b2aa. But feel free to revert these commits if you disagree!

I moved the pickling test to the class-level doc in order to make it more visible.

I think they were typos.

I've also made some other misc review changes. However I have a question, should this be in `sage/misc` or in `sage/structure` since it feels more like a structural piece of Sage? Otherwise I'm happy with the current state of things (and found similar speedups).

Well, at some point I should perhaps look at the code/doc again...

> I've also made some other misc review changes. However I have a question, should this be in `sage/misc` or in `sage/structure` since it feels more like a structural piece of Sage?

At #15820 we had a similar discussion, and Nicolas has convinced me with the following: If the structure being implemented is Sage-specific (examples: elements, parents) then it goes into sage.structure. If the structure being implemented would make sense outside of Sage, then it goes into sage.misc (examples: classcall metaclass, sequences of bounded integers as in #15820).

And I'd say that a singleton baseclass makes sense outside of Sage, hence, should go into sage.misc.

I just had a look at 0d78737, and it looks good to me.

I would have two semi-unrelated suggestions though:

- Maybe rename the class to `Singleton` rather than `SingletonClass`: then the name of the class will describe, as is usual, what its instances are, rather than the class itself.

- For the test that is modified in 0d78737: make the inheritance explicit by creating a subclasss rather than trigerring such an inheritance through a call to _refine_category.

Thanks!

Cheers,
                                  Nicolas
