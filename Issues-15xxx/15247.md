Since some while, we have `sage.categories.category_singleton.Category_singleton`. A singleton is a class that allows the creation of exactly one instance (of any subclass). The technical implementa
tion of `Category_singleton` is roughly like this: In some static `__classcall__`, test that the given class is a direct subclass of `Category_singleton`; then create a (the) instance of the class;
then set the override the classcall of this class and of the class of the instance (which might be a subclass) by a constant function returning the instance.

I suggest to provide this construction scheme generally, in `sage.misc.fast_methods.SingletonClass`. The idea is: If one write a class inheriting from `SingletonClass` then one does not need to think about caching the unique instance or writing a fast hash or writing fast comparison, since this will all be inherited from `SingletonClass`.

I suggest to use it at least on the rational field, which currently has a custom cache, and its hash method is written in Python.

With the branch that I am going to add, I get

```
sage: %timeit RationalField()
1000000 loops, best of 3: 269 ns per loop
sage: %timeit hash(QQ)
10000000 loops, best of 3: 134 ns per loop
sage: %timeit QQ==ZZ
10000000 loops, best of 3: 144 ns per loop
```

With vanilla sage-5.12.b5, it is a lot slower:

```
sage: %timeit RationalField()
10000 loops, best of 3: 82.4 us per loop
sage: %timeit hash(QQ)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 496 ns per loop
sage: %timeit QQ==ZZ
1000000 loops, best of 3: 878 ns per loop
```

There were several hash tests to fix. In all cases, I stopped comparing against a particular number, because
1. the number depends on the architecture (32- versus 64-bit)
2. the number does not show how the hash function works
3. one should test the result of `hash` against the hash function of the class being tested---otherwise (and this happened in at least three examples) one might test an instance of the wrong class.

The tests should work now.

Perhaps Simon can comment at some point, but here are my thoughts.

I would say this is okay as you can always override `__eq__` as necessary, and python's default is to do equality check by id.

> * I don't like having the same explanations and/or tests repeated in several docstrings. I tried to remove redundancies in c5acb88a and 949b7b2aa. But feel free to revert these commits if you disagree!

I moved the pickling test to the class-level doc in order to make it more visible.

I think they were typos.

I've also made some other misc review changes. However I have a question, should this be in `sage/misc` or in `sage/structure` since it feels more like a structural piece of Sage? Otherwise I'm happy with the current state of things (and found similar speedups).

Well, at some point I should perhaps look at the code/doc again...

> I've also made some other misc review changes. However I have a question, should this be in `sage/misc` or in `sage/structure` since it feels more like a structural piece of Sage?

At #15820 we had a similar discussion, and Nicolas has convinced me with the following: If the structure being implemented is Sage-specific (examples: elements, parents) then it goes into sage.structure. If the structure being implemented would make sense outside of Sage, then it goes into sage.misc (examples: classcall metaclass, sequences of bounded integers as in #15820).

And I'd say that a singleton baseclass makes sense outside of Sage, hence, should go into sage.misc.

I just had a look at 0d78737, and it looks good to me.

I would have two semi-unrelated suggestions though:

- Maybe rename the class to `Singleton` rather than `SingletonClass`: then the name of the class will describe, as is usual, what its instances are, rather than the class itself.

- For the test that is modified in 0d78737: make the inheritance explicit by creating a subclasss rather than trigerring such an inheritance through a call to _refine_category.

Thanks!

Cheers,
                                  Nicolas
