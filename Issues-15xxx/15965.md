```
Matrices over the integers have an `insert_row` method:

```
sage: A = matrix([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
sage: A.insert_row(A.nrows(), [6, 7])
[1 2]
[3 4]
[6 7]
```
Matrices over fields seem to lack such a method:

```
sage: B = A.change_ring(QQ)
sage: C = A.change_ring(GF(11))
```
Matrices `B` and `C` have no `insert_row` method,
contrary to `A`.

Neither of `A`, `B`, `C` have an `insert_column` method.
