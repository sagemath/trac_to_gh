This is a simple update and conversion to git which doesn't require the new build system.

autotools is worthless without executables named $program-$version. take any autogenerated makefile and look out for `AUTOMAKE=.*` or `ACLOCAL=.*`. these are used whenever autogenerated files need to be refreshed.

please readd my patch that provides those executables (or switch to a sane build process that correctly uses --program-suffix as intended upstream).

(yes 14804 is not required. note that 14804 is *not* a new build system but helper scripts that will also enhance the old one.)

thanks

That's far from true, I have used this package many times. Perhaps the exacutables you mention are indeed needed for `automake` rules, but "worthless" is certainly not the right word.

> please readd my patch that provides those executables

I'm certainly not going to add your exact patch as it has some comments which sound offending (I assume the comment `next time RTFM` in `autofoo` is addressed at me). If you want to add comments, better make them say something useful such that people can understand the purpose of the code.

More to the point: I think those version numbers are surely also needed for `aclocal` (and perhaps only for `automake` and `aclocal`?) and it seems your patch doesn't add those.

TL;DR: stop offending people, stop thinking your opinion is the One and Only Truth. Then people will be more willing to work with your patches.

recreating Makefiles is done via `automake` rules. worthless is a bit underrating, but it shouldn't require sage-autotools-environment-variable-expert-knowledge to get something simple done.

it took me two days to figure out and fix the autotools package, just for the sake of testing my demo on boxen. i was pretty pissed about the time wasted.

yes. it would be better to rewrite the autotools package. i almost had when i found the spkg :|

The new package works fine.
Just one question: why was the history in SPKG.Txt removed?
Ok, it's not so useful, but...

And I won't go through the flamewar here, I just want an uptodate, working, gitified autotools pkgs whic can be used to (be able to) produce (minimal) patches for sage dev.
Anything else can be postponed to a follow-up ticket.

I agree with Volker that having the same information in multiple places (version numbers, history) will lead to mistakes. For example, my Mercurial-era release management script checked that the version number in `SPKG.txt` matched the actual version number. You should see how many times that failed...

Old `SPKG.txt` history can still be retrieved using the usual `git` tools.

if it turns out to make sense. i am unsure. i consider the package far too complex and nonstandard (wrt to how other packages work and wrt how autotools packages work on other platforms). perhaps it should better be replaced by simpler packages with simpler build rules...

maybe time will tell. but don't wait for me.

"just timestamps"... timestamps of what? There isn't a single file who's timestamp could be used. Using multiple files (or all files under `build/pkgs/$PKG`) makes the implementation harder...
