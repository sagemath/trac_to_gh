<a id='comment:17'></a>autotools is worthless without executables named $program-$version. take any autogenerated makefile and look out for `AUTOMAKE=.*` or `ACLOCAL=.*`. these are used whenever autogenerated files need to be refreshed.

please readd my patch that provides those executables (or switch to a sane build process that correctly uses --program-suffix as intended upstream).

(yes 14804 is not required. note that 14804 is *not* a new build system but helper scripts that will also enhance the old one.)

thanks

That's far from true, I have used this package many times. Perhaps the exacutables you mention are indeed needed for `automake` rules, but "worthless" is certainly not the right word.

> please readd my patch that provides those executables

I'm certainly not going to add your exact patch as it has some comments which sound offending (I assume the comment `next time RTFM` in `autofoo` is addressed at me). If you want to add comments, better make them say something useful such that people can understand the purpose of the code.

More to the point: I think those version numbers are surely also needed for `aclocal` (and perhaps only for `automake` and `aclocal`?) and it seems your patch doesn't add those.

TL;DR: stop offending people, stop thinking your opinion is the One and Only Truth. Then people will be more willing to work with your patches.

recreating Makefiles is done via `automake` rules. worthless is a bit underrating, but it shouldn't require sage-autotools-environment-variable-expert-knowledge to get something simple done.

it took me two days to figure out and fix the autotools package, just for the sake of testing my demo on boxen. i was pretty pissed about the time wasted.

yes. it would be better to rewrite the autotools package. i almost had when i found the spkg :|

<a id='comment:20'></a>The new package works fine.
Just one question: why was the history in SPKG.Txt removed?
Ok, it's not so useful, but...

And I won't go through the flamewar here, I just want an uptodate, working, gitified autotools pkgs whic can be used to (be able to) produce (minimal) patches for sage dev.
Anything else can be postponed to a follow-up ticket.

I agree with Volker that having the same information in multiple places (version numbers, history) will lead to mistakes. For example, my Mercurial-era release management script checked that the version number in `SPKG.txt` matched the actual version number. You should see how many times that failed... If the information is not there, then it cannot be wrong.

Old `SPKG.txt` history can still be retrieved using the usual `git` tools.
