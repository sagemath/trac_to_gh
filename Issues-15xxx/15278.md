At #14806, an immutable graph backend has been introduced. However, the resulting graphs are not known to be immutable.

```
sage: g = graphs.CompleteGraph(400)
sage: gi = Graph(g,data_structure="static_sparse")
sage: hash(gi)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: graphs are mutable, and thus not hashable
```
So, when the immutable graph backend is used, then the `._immutable` attribute should be set to True.

But hang on: Does using the immutable graph backend really result in immutable graphs? I.e., would it really be impossible to change the `==`- and `cmp`-classes of a graph by "official" methods such as "`add_vertex()`"? And is the current equality testing really what we want to test?

Currently, `__eq__()` starts like this:

```
        # inputs must be (di)graphs:
        if not isinstance(other, GenericGraph):
            raise TypeError("cannot compare graph to non-graph (%s)"%str(other))
        from sage.graphs.all import Graph
        g1_is_graph = isinstance(self, Graph) # otherwise, DiGraph
        g2_is_graph = isinstance(other, Graph) # otherwise, DiGraph

        if (g1_is_graph != g2_is_graph):
            return False
        if self.allows_multiple_edges() != other.allows_multiple_edges():
            return False
        if self.allows_loops() != other.allows_loops():
            return False
        if self.order() != other.order():
            return False
        if self.size() != other.size():
            return False
        if any(x not in other for x in self):
            return False
        if self._weighted != other._weighted:
            return False
```

1. Is it really a good idea to raise an error when testing equality of a graph with a non-graph? Most likely not!
2. For sure, a graph that *has* multiple edges can not be equal to a graph that does not have multiple edges. But should it really matter whether a graph *allows* multiple edges when it actually doesn't *have* multiple edges?
3. Similarly for `.allows_loops()`.
4. Should `._weighted` be totally removed? Note the following comment in the documentation of the `.weighted()` method: "edge weightings can still exist for (di)graphs `G` where `G.weighted()` is `False`". Ouch.

Note the following annoying example from the docs of `.weighted()`:

```
            sage: G = Graph({0:{1:'a'}}, sparse=True)
            sage: H = Graph({0:{1:'b'}}, sparse=True)
            sage: G == H
            True

        Now one is weighted and the other is not, and thus the graphs are
        not equal::

            sage: G.weighted(True)
            sage: H.weighted()
            False
            sage: G == H
            False
```
So, calling the method `weighted` with an argument changes the `==`-class, even though I guess most mathematicians would agree that `G` has not changed at all. And this would actually be the case even if `G` was using the immutable graph backend!!!

The aim of this ticket is to sort these things out. To the very least, graphs using the immutable graph backend should not be allowed to change their `==`-class by calling `G.weighted(True)`.

Concerning "weighted": What exactly is the semantics? Is it the case that a weighted graph has positive integral edge weights, that could be taken as the multiplicity of this edge? But then, do we want that a weighted graph is equal to a multigraph with the corresponding multiplicity of edges?

In any case, the hash is currently broken, since it does not take into account weightedness, but equality check does.

It seems to me that the following is the easiest way to go:
- We keep equality test as it currently is. Here, I am being egoistic: As long as the edge labels and the multiplicity of edges count in equality testing, I simply don't care whether _weighted counts or not. I just need immutable graphs with an unbroken hash.
- In order to fix the hash, it must take into account precisely the data that are used in `__eq__`.
- We want that graphs using the immutable graph backend are immutable in the sense stated above. Hence, we must disallow `G.weighted(True/False)` if `G` is supposed to be immutable. Hence, `G.weighted` should check for the `G._immutable` flag. Similarly, we must proceed with all other non-underscore methods that could potentially change the ==-class of `G`.
- In particular, we want that that `G._immutable` is set when the immutable backend is in use.

Replying to [SimonKing](#comment%3A2):
> - In order to fix the hash, it must take into account precisely the data that are used in `__eq__`.


Perhaps I am over-eager at this point. The hash is *not* broken. Being broken means that two graphs that evaluate equal have distinct hash values. But this can currently not happen. So, it's fine.

Therefore I modify the "easiest way to go":
- We keep equality test as it currently is. Here, I am being egoistic: As long as the edge labels and the multiplicity of edges count in equality testing, I simply don't care whether _weighted counts or not. I just need immutable graphs *with a fast hash*.
- We want that graphs using the immutable graph backend are immutable in the sense stated above. Hence, we must disallow G.weighted(True/False) if G is supposed to be immutable. Hence, G.weighted should check for the G._immutable flag. Similarly, we must proceed with all other non-underscore methods that could potentially change the ==-class of G. 
- In particular, we want that that G._immutable is set when the immutable backend is in use. 
- The hash will of course keep raising an error if `G._immutable` does not evaluate to True. However, we would not like that the hash of an immutable graph is re-computed, since this is too slow. Hence, we should use `@cached_method` on the `__hash__`. We thus use #12601.

Do you agree on using #12601?

I have uploaded a preliminary "patch" (or branch, actually). The existing tests pass.

What it already does:
- If a graph is immutable then the `__copy__` method returns the graph---unless of course optional arguments are passed to the `__copy__` method. This is standard behaviour for immutable things, IIRC.
- If `.weighted(...)` is used to modify an immutable graph, then an error is raised.
- The `__hash__` became a cached method

So far, I am not setting the `._immutable` flag for the immutable graph backend. I did not add tests for the new code. And I did not verify that all "official" methods will be unable to alter an immutable graph (so far, I only fixed `.weighted()`). This shall be done in the next commits.

  there is actually a technical problem there I just noticed : the
  `get_edge_label` function behaves differently according to the value of
  `allow_multiple_edges()`. It returns either a label, or a list of labels. And
  that complicates things.

  ```
  sage: g = graphs.PetersenGraph()
  sage: print g.edge_label(0,1)
  None
  sage: g.allow_multiple_edges(True)
  sage: print g.edge_label(0,1)
  [None]
  ```

  (I hate labels and multiple edges)

  Besides, testing whether the graph containts multiple edges is currently a bit
  costly. I think we actually go over all edges, and test it.

* About `.weighted()` : looks like the meaning of "weighted" is only used in
  `spanning_tree.pyx`. And I'd say that this can easily be replaced by an
  additional argument to the methods (as it is already the case in many others,
  like `flow` of `traveling_salesman_problem`)

* I believe (note sure, never used it) that `.weighted()` only indicates whether
  the labels on the edges are to be understood as weights. That's all. Multiple
  edges are handled by the backend, and each edge can have a different label,
  it's unrelated.

* I don't see any problem with using #12601. Do you see one ?

* `copy(gi)` takes a lot of time : indeed, returning `self` makes sense. If one

Back at questions on the static graph backend...

In `__eq__`, the following data play a role:
- `.allows_multiple_edges()`
- `.allows_loops()`
- `.order()`
- `.size()`
- `._weighted`
- vertex and edge labels, and of course start and endpoints of the edges.

For immutability, it is thus essential that these methods do not change the answers after applying non-underscore methods.
- `._weighted` may be changed by the `.weighted(new)` method, which I thus made respectful against mutability. So, that is settled.
- The methods mentioned above call the backend, namely: 
  1. `._backend.multiple_edges(None)
  2. `._backend.loops(None)`
  3. `._backend.num_verts()`
  4. `._backend.num_edges(self._directed)`

So, my question boils down to this, Nathann: Is it possible for the static backend that the return value of the above methods 1.--4. changes, if the user is only using non-underscore methods on the graph? If it is not possible, then the `__eq__` classes won't change when using the static graph backend, and I am happy.

The hash only takes into account the tuple of vertices and edges (which includes their labels). You have already confirmed that this is fine with the static backend.

It will probably be fine to keep them in `__eq__`, as they simply ask for the backend's opinion, and the static backend hopefully has no changeable mind.

OK, but removing ".weighted()" from `__eq__` could be done later, I believe.
 
> * I don't see any problem with using #12601. Do you see one ?


Nope.

With the decorator, an error would be raised whenever `.weighted()` is called on a mutable graph. However, `.weighted` only mutates the graph if it has an argument. `G.weighted()` will not change `G`, but will only tell whether `G` is weighted or not. I am not using the decorator in order to preserve this behaviour.
 
Best regards,

Simon

Nope. `multiple_edges` and `loops` will give you the list of multiple edges and loops, and that cannot change if the adjacencies do not change, so that's ok. Aaaaand the same goes with the number of vertices and edges, so you're fine !

Replying to [SimonKing](#comment%3A20):

It is ! My mistake ! And it is fixed by #15491, which removes the ten characters that shouldn't have been there `^^;`

I think we need to take care of another detail:

If the static graph backend is used, then `self.delete_vertex(vertex)` and similar mutating methods will result in an error raised by the backend.

However, the problem is that the backend is only called in the very end, after doing damage to attributes that the graph takes care of in addition to the backend:

```python
        if in_order:
            vertex = self.vertices()[vertex]
        if vertex not in self:
            raise RuntimeError("Vertex (%s) not in the graph."%str(vertex))

        attributes_to_update = ('_pos', '_assoc', '_embedding')
        for attr in attributes_to_update:
            if hasattr(self, attr) and getattr(self, attr) is not None:
                getattr(self, attr).pop(vertex, None)
        self._boundary = [v for v in self._boundary if v != vertex]

        self._backend.del_vertex(vertex)
```
Shouldn't this better be

```python
        if in_order:
            vertex = self.vertices()[vertex]
        if vertex not in self:
            raise RuntimeError("Vertex (%s) not in the graph."%str(vertex))

        self._backend.del_vertex(vertex)
        attributes_to_update = ('_pos', '_assoc', '_embedding')
        for attr in attributes_to_update:
            if hasattr(self, attr) and getattr(self, attr) is not None:
                getattr(self, attr).pop(vertex, None)
        self._boundary = [v for v in self._boundary if v != vertex]
```

That's to say, would it be enough to have

With the current commit, all tests should pass, changing (di)graphs using the static backend requires some criminal energy, they have a hash, and it is documented.

The `ValueError` you are mentioning is not part of the `add_vertex` method of the static backend, by the way:

```
sage: G = graphs.PetersenGraph()
sage: G_imm = DiGraph(G, data_structure="static_sparse")
sage: G_imm._backend.add_vertex.__module__
'sage.graphs.base.c_graph'
sage: G_imm._backend.__module__
'sage.graphs.base.static_sparse_backend'
```

EDIT: Here is the mro:

```
sage: G_imm._backend.__class__.mro()
[sage.graphs.base.static_sparse_backend.StaticSparseBackend,
 sage.graphs.base.c_graph.CGraphBackend,
 sage.graphs.base.graph_backends.GenericGraphBackend,
 sage.structure.sage_object.SageObject,
 object]
```

Since the topic of this ticket is "hash and equality for graphs" and since we now have a way (by saying `data_structure="static_sparse"` when creating the graph) to produce immutable hashable graphs that evaluate equal to the corresponding mutable graphs, I'd say we should postpone the improvement of error messages. Hence: Needs review.

I don't even have a clue what you mean by "this". You have provided a "static" backend that is almost enough to produce immutable graphs. To really make them immutable (in the sense stated repeatedly), it was needed to allow `G.weighted()` but disallow `G.weighted(new_value)` on immutable graphs, since the latter would mutate the graph. And if something is immutable then it makes sense to provide it with a hash---which in the case of graphs means to provide the `._immutable` attribute---and to make the hash faster (by using work on `@`cached_method that has already been done in #12601).

So, that's what this ticket is about. Or is there anything I forgot?

And my next aim is to continue work on #12630. There, it is useful to have hashable (immutable) (di)graphs that can be used as cache keys.

Gosh, I'm going to hate these git dependencies.

Some remarks, though :
- In `.copy()`, you add a line before everything else to handle your case. Couldn't you add a line after the second "if" block, the one after which we know for sure that `data_structure` has been defined, saying "if data_structure == "static_sparse" and hasattr(self,'_immutable')" then return self ? By the way, is an object considered mutable if it HAS a ._immutable variable equal to False ?

- Why wouldn't we add (later) a "immutable" flag to the constructor and to "copy" ? It would be nice to call `Graph(graphs.PetersenGraph(),immutable=True)` ? `O_o`

- What about an exception message for `_hash_` that would give the hint that hashable graphs can be built ? Something like "This graph is mutable, and thus not hashable. To make it mutable, read the doc of Graph.copy."
  I personnally don't mind much, it's more for your crowd... They may think that it can't be done and leave.

Oh. And it's cool, the multiple edges problem and loops are handled by the backend too. Well, thus making graphs immutable looks rather shorter than I first thought `:-)`

I am working on it.

> By the way, is an object considered mutable if it HAS a ._immutable variable equal to False ?


Hmm. Would this be possible? I think a graph should be considered immutable if and only if the static backend is used---or rather if and only if *some* static backend is used: Perhaps there will be more static backends in future.

So, instead of relying on an attribute `._immutable` that the user could mess with, one could test for the type of the backend when we need to know whether a graph is immutable.

Problem: If I am not mistaken, people currently *do* mess with the attribute `._immutable`, if I am not mistaken.

Would it be feasible to try to remove the `._immutable` attribute (and testing the type of the backend instead), see how much fails, and fix the failing code by using "proper" immutable graphs?

Would a flag in the "copy" function be supported by Python?

Yes. Only problem: We would then need to decide what to do if "immutable=False" and "backend="static_sparse" is simultaneously used.

OK.

Ahahah. Well, not really.. In a merge commit you have sometimes to settle conflicts manually, adding any amount of code you like, and this code needs to be reviewed too. And I have absolutely no understanding of this part of the code `:-P`

And for some reason I thought when I made this comment that it was the case, though I can't find it back again `O_o`

Yes yes indeed, that's what Nicolas told me they did at the moment, and that's what Python uses too know whether it should consider the object as mutable or not. I just wondered if it checked whether the variable existed, or whether the variable was set to True too. 

> Would it be feasible to try to remove the `._immutable` attribute (and testing the type of the backend instead), see how much fails, and fix the failing code by using "proper" immutable graphs?


Hmmmm, I thought that Python really needed this `_immutable` variable somewhere `O_o`

Well not in `.__copy__` but in `.copy()` no problem I guess.

I usually settle this by setting the keywords to "None" by default, instead of True/False. Then if the user manually sets two keywords to contradicting values, either ignore one of the two or scream, as usual. I'll do that in another patch when this one will be reviewed, it will be an easier syntax.

Now we talk about three things. I was talking about Python's (or Sage's?) `copy()` function, which dispatches to `__copy__` or to pickling, depending on what's available. You talk about the `.__copy__()` method, which exists for graphs, and the `.copy()` method, which is set to `__copy__` for graphs.

The `copy()` *function* does not use any argument except the object that is being copied. For that reason, I think the `__copy__` method *should* not accept any arguments except `self`. But currently, the `.__copy__()` method of graphs uses a plethora of optional arguments.

Instead, I suggest that one should introduce a separate `.copy()` method: Here, it is no problem to add arguments. In particular, you can use such method to create a mutable copy resp. an immutable copy of an immutable resp. a mutable (di)graph. And it would be available in the docs (unlike `.__copy__()`).

On the other hand (thinking after writing, as usual...): The optional arguments of `__copy__` are not used, but when one defines `copy=__copy__` then the method and its documentation do appear in the docs and can be used by people. Hm. In the end, it might be better to keep it.

But one question on copying needs to be addressed: I think in some places in Sage, `copy(X)` returns `X` if `X` is immutable, but in other places in Sage, `copy(X)` always returns a *mutable* copy of `X`, regardless whether `X` is mutable or not. What would you prefer for graphs?

In any case, I should add a test showing what happens with copies of immutable graphs.

> I usually settle this by setting the keywords to "None" by default, instead of True/False. Then if the user manually sets two keywords to contradicting values, either ignore one of the two or scream, as usual. I'll do that in another patch when this one will be reviewed, it will be an easier syntax.


Do I understand correctly: You say I shouldn't try to add the "nicer" syntax now, since you would take care of it in a review patch/other ticket?

From my perspective, this behaviour would be fine. But I also see this:

```
sage: M = matrix([[1,2,3],[4,5,6]])
sage: M.set_immutable()
sage: M.is_immutable()
True
sage: m = copy(M)
sage: m.is_immutable()
False
```
There is one crucial difference, though: A mutable matrix can be made immutable, by `M.set_immutable()`. But a mutable graph can (currently?) not easily be made immutable, since mutability crucially relies on the backend, which is not the case for matrices.

Anyway, I don't think that there is a commonly accepted standard in Sage. Since we have no `G.set_immutable()` method for graphs, I guess it is better to have
- `copy(G)` has the same backend as G. In particular, mutability is copied. And if it is immutable, then we should have `G is copy(G)`.
- If one wants an immutable/mutable copy of a mutable/immutable graph G, then it should be done either by `Graph(G,backend='...')` or `G.copy(backend='...')` respectively with a to-be-implemented `mutable=True/False` keyword.

Helloooooo !!

I'm sorry but this ticket has to be rebased. I created #15603 which is based on this ticket and the patchbot reports a lot of broken doctests, which seems to happen as soon as one merges this ticket with `6.1.beta2`. And I have no clue how this patch can have any effect on that code `O_o`

Here are the doctests that are reported to be broken on #15603

```
sage -t --long src/sage/combinat/posets/posets.py  # 37 doctests failed
sage -t --long src/sage/graphs/base/c_graph.pyx  # 3 doctests failed
sage -t --long src/sage/misc/c3_controlled.pyx  # 8 doctests failed
sage -t --long src/sage/combinat/posets/hasse_diagram.py  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t --long src/sage/combinat/posets/linear_extensions.py  # 78 doctests failed
```

The exceptions caused to `c_graph.pyx` seem to be my doing, though. Everything else looks related to linear extensions.

Hmmmm... Well, I'd think that it is a Poset-related ticket, since all the linear_extension stuff seems to break. And well, it looks like I am responsible for the Poset stuff that got merged since 6.0:

```
~/sage/combinat$ git log --oneline --merges d --author Release ^6.0 .

```

```
~/sage/combinat$ git log --oneline --merges d --author Release ^6.0 posets/
5dc0fb6 Trac #15332: Poset.lt computes too much
4254523 Trac #15330: Poset.is_chain is wrong
092c6f9 Trac #15313: is_linear_extension on posets is rather liberal
ee684c1 Trac #15340: Bug in chord_and_tangent
```

(`d` is my `develop` branch).

But #15322 only simplifies code, and #15330 is a bugfix. Actually, I don't even understand how any of that could be related to the specific feature you implemented. Nobody should be calling that code. It may be related to #15313, who knows ? It is a bugfix too. `Poset.is_linear_extension([1,2,3,4])` could return True even if 4 is not contained in the Poset, and the patch fixes it `:-/`
And #15340 looks totally unrelated.

Or go the middle way: In `__hash__` and in the self-mutating methods, we should rely on the flag, but in `__copy__` we should be more careful, and should only return `self` if it is truely immutable.

Namely, it seems currently used to create the copy of a mock-immutable graph to mutate the copy, and thus we must return a *proper* copy rather than just self in this case.

Oh. I see. Hacks.

Well, that makes sense indeed. Looks like a proof that we shouldn't rely on this `_immutable` flag. Especially when none of us knows who exactly uses it `:-P`

Is there an usual "is_immutable" function in immutable objects ? Perhaps we should do this. This function would check the actual backend, and return its answer accordingly.

This being said, checking the backend does not exactly mean that all other properties of graphs are "protected", like the embedding and everything.

Hmmm...

Okay, I just read your latest post : the point is that this ._immutable flag is a hack. Shouldn't we just make their code use the new backend, so that their code is not hacked anymore ? Right now they claim their graphs are immutable, though they aren't. Seems like the way to go, isn't it ?

That's why *both* the flag and the type of the backend are checked before returning "self" as a copy.

I only see one place where `combinat` uses `bla._immutable = True`:

```
src/sage/combinat/posets/posets.py:        G._immutable = True
```
So, perhaps it would not be too much of a problem to change this to using the static sparse backend. But then, we also need to identify where stuff is copied.

Meanwhile I see at what point the copy is taken: It is

```python
    def transitive_reduction(self):
        r"""
        Returns a transitive reduction of a graph. The original graph is
        not modified.

        A transitive reduction H of G has a path from x to y if and only if
        there was a path from x to y in G. Deleting any edge of H destroys
        this property. A transitive reduction is not unique in general. A
        transitive reduction has the same transitive closure as the
        original graph.

        A transitive reduction of a complete graph is a tree. A transitive
        reduction of a tree is itself.

        EXAMPLES::

            sage: g=graphs.PathGraph(4)
            sage: g.transitive_reduction()==g
            True
            sage: g=graphs.CompleteGraph(5)
            sage: edges = g.transitive_reduction().edges(); len(edges)
            4
            sage: g=DiGraph({0:[1,2], 1:[2,3,4,5], 2:[4,5]})
            sage: g.transitive_reduction().size()
            5
        """
        from copy import copy
        from sage.rings.infinity import Infinity
        G = copy(self)
        for e in self.edge_iterator():
            # Try deleting the edge, see if we still have a path
            # between the vertices.
            G.delete_edge(e)
            if G.distance(e[0],e[1])==Infinity:
                # oops, we shouldn't have deleted it
                G.add_edge(e)
        return G
```
Hence, it seems that we indeed want a mutable copy here. And perhaps it isn't *their* mess after all, as this method is broken for all truely immutable graphs.

Ahahaha. Well, given that there are no immutable graphs in Sage at the moment, this function can't really be said to be broken `:-D`

They needed immutable graphs and didn't want to implement them, i.e. to deal with this kind of things. So well, that's our job now and we have to find out when they need immutable graphs and when they don't `:-P`

This copy has to be flagged with "immutable=False" (but that's only available in my patch) or with a specific data structure.

So let's finish this patch with your fix, I'll give it a positive review once it passes the tests. Then there is my patch that enables "copy" (that I will have to rebase), then on top of it there will be a patch to use immutable graphs in posets as they should be.

Aaaaaaaand now I have to go eat `T_T`

Fixed the syntax error, and checked that the failing test passes.

So, with the last two commits, we counter-hacked the hack with the `._immutable` attribute. Next step will be to make #15603 ready (can you merge the missing commits from here into #15603, please?), and in a third step, we will properly remove the hack and perhaps the counter-hack too.

I fear that there may be nasty surprises hiding, though. For instance, I'm rather convinced that the static backend will produce a HUGE slowdown in their code, because right now distance computations (which translates as comparison in posets) is done by some code specific to the sparse backend. And thus does not exist for the static backend. So this will have to be written too. And then it should be much faster `;-)`

Well. What's the difference with implementing it in the ticket that will use it as the default backend for posets ? Nobody will use it in the meantime, and if you want to get technical it's not related to "hash and equality for graphs" either.

And this patch will be in `needs_review` in a couple of days at most anyway. It may be so this very evening if I can get around that bug i told you about `:-P`

Good point. But I think it isn't in the "poset" ticket either". Would you mind if I created a new ticket "pickling of immutable graphs", that will end up to be a dependency for the poset ticket?
