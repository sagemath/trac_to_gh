In Sage 5.12:

```
sage: e=log(1/2*sqrt(2)*(sqrt(2) + 1)) + log(1/2*sqrt(2)*(sqrt(2) - 1))
sage: e.simplify_full()
-log(2)
sage: (2*e).simplify_full()
2*log(1/2*sqrt(2)*(sqrt(2) + 1)) + 2*log(1/2*sqrt(2)*(sqrt(2) - 1))
```
In Sage 5.9 the last command gave instead:

```
sage: (2*e).simplify_full().simplify_full()
2*log(sqrt(2) - 1) + 2*log(sqrt(2) + 1) - 2*log(2)
```
This is related to #10983.

I assume this stems from #12737?  Just guessing.

Indeed, in 5.12:

```
sage: (2*e).simplify_radical()
-2*log(2) + 2*log(sqrt(2) + 1) + 2*log(sqrt(2) - 1)
```
(Note the slight Pynac-related, unimportant, reordering.)

If I recall correctly, Paul was one of the bigger voices behind removing `simplify_radical` from full simplification, so hopefully #10983 can just change their doctest here.

<div id="comment:3" align="right">comment:3</div>

replacing `simplify_full` by `simplify_radical` indeed solves the two issues we have in #10983, and it is clearer.

I thus propose to close that ticket.
