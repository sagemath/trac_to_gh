This is due to improper use of `imshow`, I think.  This was reported at [this ask.sagemath question](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/3115/density-plot-aspect-ratio).  See [these](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13384653/imshow-extent-and-aspect) [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10540929/figure-of-imshow-is-too-small) [questions](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7965743/python-matplotlib-setting-aspect-ratio/7969475#7969475) for various approaches to setting this.  Essentially, we may need to have some custom way to pass on fig size and aspect ratio to matrix and density plots (which use imshow).

This is the same as it was earlier! The aspect ratio is set to `self.aspect_ratio()` if it is `None` (c.f. the patch). And the latter returns `"automatic"` by default. So, if matrix and density plots have not been setting the aspect ratio to one explicitly, then they *are* running with `"automatic"` aspect ratio.

So, IMHO, for the plots where the aspect ratio is explicitly set to 1 by `@options`, it remains 1. And for the plots where it is not automatically set, `"automatic"` was already the default, so we are not changing anything here.

I realize that the problem showed up in the weird plots. My interpretation of it is this - if we set the aspect ratio to automatic before the plot, then matplotlib has no idea of the kind of data it is about to get. I don't know what it does internally. But if we set it after the plot then matplotlib has the data and now it can set the plot parameters appropriately.

Ideally, matplotlib should "keep in mind" that the aspect ratio is automatic and needs to be readjusted after the plot.

About density plots: I think mpl is doing "the right thing" when aspect is set to auto. This is not a geometrical object, so I think there we should not have aspect 1 in all cases.

About matrix plots: In this case, I think we should interpret an unset aspect ratio as `"equal"` aspect ratio. This is already set explicitly in the code currently but this should be handled better. The current patch affects the matrix plots and the images are no longer square.

Other functions where aspect ratio is not set:

* `arrow` - `FancyArrowPatch` from mpl has no aspect option
* `bezier_path` - `Path` from mpl has no aspect option
* `complex_plot` - the aspect ratio is not set in our code, and I think it is best left as automatic
* `plot_field` - I don't see an aspect option in quiver of mpl
* `step` - IMHO, there is no need for aspect ratio here
* `text.py` - I think there is no need for aspect ratio here, and `text` in mpl has no such option either.

So, the only thing this patch affects are the matrix plots, and I think there the code should explicitly set the aspect ratio, i.e., we should introduce either `@options(aspect_ratio=1)` or `@options(aspect_ratio="equal")` in the definition of `matrix_plot`.
