For binary builds / system-wide installs and perhaps tarballs we should not require the git repository. This ticket fixes two doctests for that use case.

That is, to remove the development functionality you can now 
* delete `SAGE_SRC/sage/dev`
* delete `SAGE_ROOT/.git`
and all doctests still pass
