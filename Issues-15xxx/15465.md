For binary builds / system-wide installs and perhaps tarballs we should not require the git repository. This ticket fixes two doctests for that use case.

That is, to remove the development functionality you can now 
* delete `SAGE_SRC/sage/dev`
* delete `SAGE_ROOT/.git`
and all doctests still pass

The idea is to delete the `src/sage/dev` directory if development is not possible (e.g. because of file permissions). Just not importing `dev` is not a solution as the dev doctests are still around (and will all fail).
