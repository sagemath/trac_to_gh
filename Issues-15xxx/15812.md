<a id='comment:9'>**Comment 9:**</a>
Ah, I thought maybe that had been clarified recently.  Glad I wasn't dreaming it.

Another thing found in a few places:

```
Initials conditions are optional.
```
Maybe "initial"?

And:

```
Higher ordered, 
```
Probably is "higher order".

Do you want "laplace" capitalized?
