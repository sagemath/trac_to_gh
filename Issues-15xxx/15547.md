```
Right now, the tikz method for the projection of a 2d polytope in 3d relies on the dimension of the projection and not the dimension of the actual polytope. This is incompatible with the way that the tikz method works in this case. Moreover, the drawing of back-edges of 3d-polytopes (in 3d) is broken.

The first error can be reproduced:

```
    sage: P = Polyhedron(vertices=[[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,1]])
    sage: P.ambient_dim()
    3
    sage: P.dim()
    2
    sage: PProj = P.projection()
    sage: PProj.polyhedron_ambient_dim
    3
    sage: PProj.dimension
    3
```

To fix the issue, I believe one should add an attribute "polyhedron_dim" to the projection to know what the dimension of the polyhedron actually is. Something like:

```
    sage: PProj.polyhedron_dim
    2
```

Then the tikz method will use this attribute to decide which algorithm to apply.

The second problem is an indexing issue in the creation of potential back edges. There is a trivial fix to that.

The doc of _init_from_2d and _init_from_3d should also mention that it is possible to have lower dimensional polytopes.

I uploaded a patch.

The problem is now solved and I added two examples to test the bug on back edges of 3d polytopes and the drawing of 2d-polytopes embedded in 3d.

On this patch, the examples of projections have to be solved... (tests do not pass)

-Using the new tikz feature, (see http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/12083) there is a problem when drawing polygons embedded in 3d. The error can be reproduced:
+Right now, the tikz method for the projection of a 2d polytope in 3d relies on the dimension of the projection and not the dimension of the actual polytope. This is incompatible with the way that the tikz method works in this case. Moreover, the drawing of back-edges of 3d-polytopes (in 3d) is broken.
