The following will break the matroid M:

```
sage: M = matroids.named_matroids.Fano()
sage: len(M.dependent_r_sets(3))
7
sage: L = M.groundset_list()
sage: x = L.pop()
sage: list(M.dependent_r_sets(3))
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
IndexError: list index out of range
```

Solution 1: BasisExchangeMatroid.groundset_list() should return a copy of self._E
Solution 2: BasisExchangeMatroid._E should be a tuple instead of a list.

I think Solution 2 is the preferred one, but it should be tested for speed.

Additional suggestion: update the docstrings of groundset() and groundset_list() in BasisExchangeMatroid so they refer to each other.

I implemented solution 2, and changed BasisExchangeMatroid._E to a tuple instead of a list. It was my beginner's error not to use the immutable tuple here in the first place. 

I did not notice any effects on the efficiency of the code.
