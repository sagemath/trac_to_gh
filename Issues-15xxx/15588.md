- Bring coverage to 100%; a missing doctest for `extension()`.
- Use `cached_method` instead of a custom cache.
- Fix docstring formatting.
- Make it python3 compliant (at least as far as I know).

All of these are good things to do.

Ahahaahah. Funny. I barely know what all these functions do, though I was always able to check that the code was equivalent to what it was previously. Sooooooo it's all good.

Even though we don't agree on style issues. It looks like you prefer to have many "if/return, if/return,if/return" while I prefer "elif/return", and for some reason you don't like "else" at all.

Ahahaah. Anyway, it's good to go, thank you for that !

And I have to read this awful thing soon, for I can't go on having to complain each time the categories are involved.
http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/categories/sage/categories/primer.html

I feel like I should do more. I should study it very intently, in order to be able to explain with the right vocabulary WHY everything related to categories/parents/elements should be removed from Sage `:-P`

Besides, this example for your docstring is reaaaaaaaallllyyy scary :

I just get annoyed when there's something like:

```
if cond:
    special/small case
    return foo
else:
    a long code block
    return foobar
```
and I just try to be consistent with that overall. Plus the extra indents can play hell on my sanity when going from 5 indents to 1 (or was it 6 or 4... `:P`). Okay, I'll stop ranting.

I think Simon's "implementing a new parent" (or something like that) tutorial is a better starting point.
