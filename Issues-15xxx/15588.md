```
- Bring coverage to 100%; a missing doctest for `extension()`.
- Use `cached_method` instead of a custom cache.
- Fix docstring formatting.
- Make it python3 compliant (at least as far as I know).

All of these are good things to do.

Depends on #15369

Ahahaahah. Funny. I barely know what all these functions do, though I was always able to check that the code was equivalent to what it was previously. Sooooooo it's all good.

Even though we don't agree on style issues. It looks like you prefer to have many "if/return, if/return,if/return" while I prefer "elif/return", and for some reason you don't like "else" at all.

Ahahaah. Anyway, it's good to go, thank you for that !

And I have to read this awful thing soon, for I can't go on having to complain each time the categories are involved.
http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/categories/sage/categories/primer.html

I feel like I should do more. I should study it very intently, in order to be able to explain with the right vocabulary WHY everything related to categories/parents/elements should be removed from Sage `:-P`

Besides, this example for your docstring is reaaaaaaaallllyyy scary :

```
        sage: F19 = IntegerModRing(19, category = Fields())                                                                                                                                    
        sage: F19.category().is_subcategory(Fields())

I just get annoyed when there's something like:

```
if cond:
    special/small case
    return foo
else:
    a long code block
    return foobar
```
and I just try to be consistent with that overall. Plus the extra indents can play hell on my sanity when going from 5 indents to 1 (or was it 6 or 4... `:P`). Okay, I'll stop ranting.

Thank you for doing the review!

I think Simon's "implementing a new parent" (or something like that) tutorial is a better starting point.

> Besides, this example for your docstring is reaaaaaaaallllyyy scary :

It has to do with refining the category and doing primality checks that one may not want todo when constructing the object. There's a topic on sage-devel and a ticket on this as I recall. For example, do you know if `ZZ / 10000000000000069 ZZ` is a field? It is in fact, and now that you do know it, you can do things like you would with other fields. That's basically what that docstring is about.

> Anyway. I tried to pay very close attention, and all I could spot in your commit is that I would have written <code>\`GF(p) -> Z/pZ\`</code> instead of <code> \`\`GF(p) -> Z/pZ\`\`</code>. Which I guess is only style again `:-P`

I just made it verbatim, but since it's not seen in the built doc (in fact, almost noone will ever see that), I didn't put much thought into it. Feel free to change it.

Thanks again Nathann,

Travis

You may be annoyed by that style, but I am annoyed by people rewriting code for no other reason than it suits their own personal style. When it's newly added code, it makes sense to have a good consistent style. But I don't think you should rewrite existing code into a particular style.
