ValueError: Calling floor() on infinity or NaN
```
The problem is that in this case `x_interval.upper()` is infinite at line 581 of sage/functions/other.py:

```
sage: RealIntervalField(53)(x)
[1.2500000000000000 .. +infinity]
```
A simple change to deal with this possibility should fix it.

The new code seems to work well.  But unfortunately I'm unable to test this fully because I can't currently rebuild sage.  A few comments:
* It would be good practice to use `xrange` rather than `range`
* The `unique_floor` method for Real Interval Field elements can be used to simplify the code. Thus that the key part could read:

```
    for bits in xrange(53, maximum_bits, 100):
        try:
            return RealIntervalField(bits)(x).unique_floor()
        except ValueError:
            continue
```
* Corresponding changes should be made for the `ceil` function.
* Doctests will, of course, be needed.

Thnaks for your comments.

Replying to [fwclarke](#comment%3A3):
> * It would be good practice to use `xrange` rather than `range`

I wasn't too sure about that as the correponding range will always be very short, but why not.

> * The `unique_floor` method for Real Interval Field elements can be used to simplify the code.

Good point, thanks!

> * Corresponding changes should be made for the `ceil` function.

Sure. And we should make sure that `round()` does the right thing too.

I would also be tempted to double the precision each time the comparison is inconclusive, instead of increasing it by a fixed amount (at least for large values of `bits`). In many cases, the complexity of `RealIntervalField(bits)(x)` will be roughly linear in `bits`, so the total running time wrt the necessary precision would drop from essentially quadratic to essentially linear. What do you think?

I agree, but it would prevent a user wasting time by giving a ridiculously large value to `maximum_bits`.

Yes.

Sounds convincing, but I'm no expert on interval arithmetic.

Ok, this updates the above fix so that it merges with a recent sage.

It also incorporates the review suggestions.

Both `ceil` and `floor` have `FIXME:` notes saying to move the guts of `__call__` to `_eval_`.  I'm willing to do that if it is only a cosmetic change, but I have next to no idea about what is going on with the dispatching.

OK, I think I've figured out why no one has moved the code from `__call__` to `_eval`.  If we do the replacement (returning None if we cannot simplify) then if we call `ceil` or `floor` with a nonnumeric argument then `BuiltinFunction.__call__` delegates to `Function.__call__` which coerces its result to an expression as follows

```
        return new_Expression_from_GEx(SR, res)
```   

So the result of `floor` or `ceil` is an expression (that consists of just an integer.) 

At first glance, this seems harmless enough, but for to coerce an expression into an integer we call `floor` or `ceil`, and that wont work if `floor` or `ceil` is not returning an integer then we don't accomplish much.  Although the `Expression` object has an `is_integer` method, it does not seem to have any way of getting that integer other than calling `floor` or `ceil`.

Just to complete the picture:

Replying to [@deinst](#comment%3A12):
>... Although the `Expression` object has an `is_integer` method, it does not seem to have any way of getting that integer other than calling `floor` or `ceil`.

`is_integer` calls Pynac and performs a call to `ex::info(info_flags::integer)` which is virtual so you have methods named `info()` for all subclasses of `basic`, see http://www.ginac.de/tutorial/#The-class-hierarchy. In fact, only `add`, `mul`, and `numeric` have any handling of that flag, the relevant code is here:

* https://github.com/pynac/pynac/blob/master/ginac/add.cpp#L263
* https://github.com/pynac/pynac/blob/master/ginac/mul.cpp#L469
* https://github.com/pynac/pynac/blob/master/ginac/numeric.cpp#L1101

The last calls back Sage's function `symbolic/pynac.pyx:cdef public bint py_is_integer()` which is

```
   return isinstance(x, int) or isinstance(x, long) or isinstance(x, Integer) or \
           (isinstance(x, Element) and
            ((<Element>x)._parent.is_exact() or (<Element>x)._parent == ring.SR) and
            (x in ZZ))
```

After a bit of thought, it seemed like the best thing to do would be to move the guts to `_eval_` and replace `__call__` with something like

```
    def __call__(self, *args, **kwds):
        res = super(Function_floor, self).__call__(*args, **kwds)

        # Convert to Integer if the output was of type "int" and any of
        # the inputs was a Sage Element
        if isinstance(res, Expression) and res.is_integer():
            return res.pyobject()
        else:
            return res
```

This should please everyone that expects floor to return an integer type instead of an expression type, while having the functionality routed in the standard way.  Unforturnately, we now run into coersion problems on the other end, people are calling `floor` with values that `BuiltinFunction` cannot handle.  For example, in `prime_pi.py` there is a doctest

```
            sage: prime_pi._eval_(str(-2^100))
```

Which ends up taking `floor(str(-2^100))`.  This works in the current implementation, as `str(-2^100)` can be coerced to an element of `RealIntervalField`, but if we route the call through `BuiltinFunction.__call__` it dies because `str(-2^100)` cannot be coerced to an element of `SR` (this somewhat surprises me).

The obvious answer would be to add some coersion at the front of `Function_floor.__call__`, but I don't know how far we should take treating `floor` and `ceil` as functions needing special care and handling.

There is still the problem of a potential infinite loop in the recursive call

```
                return floor(SR(x).full_simplify().canonicalize_radical())
```

I don't know of any `Expression`s that evaluate to integers, but that `maxima` cannot simplify, but I'd be surprised if they don't exist.  I'm still rummaging about on the border of `pynac` to figure out how to stop the recursion.  If nothing else I can use the substitute trick, but that seems too kludgy.
