I'm having problems with this ticket, it works on an incremental build but not in a full rebuild. Dies in conway polynomials: http://build.sagemath.org/sage/builders/%20%20fast%20Volker%20Desktop%20%28Fedora%2019%20x86_64%29%20full/builds/5/steps/compile_1/logs/conway

python distutils requires a lot of overhead in file lists, which is bad. but wildcards are worse.

this ticket does not improve anything. better leave it like that (YMMV).

Replying to [robertwb](#comment%3A15):
> Would you propose enumerating the .py files somewhere as an enhancement? 


yes.

when i implemented the make/autotools based build system (#15039), i started off with wildcards (which are not a portability issue, since GNU make is a requirement in various other places). only later, i considered integrity/sanity more important than having random files processed/installed/distributed. so I switched over to explicit lists.

unlike distutils, autotools provides some integrity checks ('distcheck') out of the box, i didn't want to miss them. i cant help to note that enhancing/replacing distutils would be far superior to getting rid of the existing file lists.

autotools (in combination with GNU make) works with wildcards, but it will not end up smarter than distutils with wildcards. reliable introspection should not be used to decide which files belong to a project.

sage (the library) has tests for every implemented function, no matter how trivisl it is. not checking whether all files are present does not seem to fit. if you are not convinced, go ahead and delete the lists.
