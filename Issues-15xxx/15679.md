It seems ld on Cygwin64 does not look for .so extension and so fails to find libsingular.so.
Indeed Singular is ill configured on Cygwin64.

This also disables omGetBacktrace on Cygwin64 as it seems to be broken.

The fixes here are jsut temporary as Singular4 build system is quite different anyway.

Ah.  I didn't understand that a commit could be listed under two tickets.  Having found the commit, I think I just searched for tickets in which you were an author and the summary contained singular.

I see now that the problem I had has been picked up in sage-release.  Sorry for bothering you.
