From a doctest in `qqbar.py`:

```
sage: x = polygen(AA)
sage: %time QQbar.polynomial_root(x^5 - x - 1, CIF(RIF(0.1, 0.2), RIF(1.0, 1.1))).imag().exactify()
CPU times: user 28.33 s, sys: 0.02 s, total: 28.35 s
Wall time: 28.38 s
sage: pari.allocatemem(1<<30)
PARI stack size set to 1073741824 bytes
sage: %time QQbar.polynomial_root(x^5 - x - 1, CIF(RIF(0.1, 0.2), RIF(1.0, 1.1))).imag().exactify()
CPU times: user 2.70 s, sys: 0.15 s, total: 2.85 s
Wall time: 2.84 s
```
