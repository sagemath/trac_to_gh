The changes and cleanups (thanks!) look good to me.

Can you also put the warning in one additional place - the docstring for the class `MixedIntegerLinearProgram`? Since this is only documentation changes, I think with the additional change, it is good to go.

You are right - but should there  be a "warning" in a tutorial? I think it should be a usual statement.

Ok. Looks good to me.

One paragraph (line 135...) has 80-87 characters long lines. Not a big deal for me. I think your emacs setting has 85 chars not 80. You can update the ticket if you want with reflowed lines.

`T_T`

I knew something was weird. The doctests passed on my computer, and I was wondering if there was something new with the deprecation warnings, like they are "only shown once" in the first doctests of each file and never again. It all passed.

I guess it was a bug and all functions need to be fixed, which seems natural. I am recompiling the commit over beta1 and I will check it again. Hoping that the doctests fail on my computer, this time `:-P`
