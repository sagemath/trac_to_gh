As the title says. It has been reported once again. We make this assumption because ALL lp solvers that we use make the same, but it does not mean everybody knows it `T_T`

Can you also put the warning in one additional place - the docstring for the class `MixedIntegerLinearProgram`? Since this is only documentation changes, I think with the additional change, it is good to go.

Great and fast work.  But...  sorry, not loud enough.  

If you look at [the LP tutorial](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/thematic_tutorials/linear_programming.html), there is no indication of this (other than a parenthetical "for instance when you want some variables to be negative") - and that is where people will end with current SEO results.

Remember, this is for people coming to LP who are not in all likelihood crazy graaaaaph theorists or in operations research, and who (like me, though I am not a complete novice to using LPs) will not at all suspect this problem.

And we all know that students only look for worked examples in order to do their homework, so why should it be any different with working people in the mathematical sciences?  :-)

You are right - but should there  be a "warning" in a tutorial? I think it should be a usual statement.

The MIP mentions it in the introductory part and then Nathann has already fixed it for the MILP part. Is there anywhere else in MIP that you have in mind?
