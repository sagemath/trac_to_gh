As the title says. It has been reported once again. We make this assumption because ALL lp solvers that we use make the same, but it does not mean everybody knows it `T_T`

Great and fast work.  But...  sorry, not loud enough.  

If you look at [the LP tutorial](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/thematic_tutorials/linear_programming.html), there is no indication of this (other than a parenthetical "for instance when you want some variables to be negative") - and that is where people will end with current SEO results.

And we all know that students only look for worked examples in order to do their homework, so why should it be any different with working people in the mathematical sciences?  :-)

You are right - but should there  be a "warning" in a tutorial? I think it should be a usual statement.
