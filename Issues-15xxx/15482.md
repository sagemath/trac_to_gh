As the title says. It has been reported once again. We make this assumption because ALL lp solvers that we use make the same, but it does not mean everybody knows it `T_T`

The changes and cleanups (thanks!) look good to me.

Can you also put the warning in one additional place - the docstring for the class `MixedIntegerLinearProgram`? Since this is only documentation changes, I think with the additional change, it is good to go.

You are right - but should there  be a "warning" in a tutorial? I think it should be a usual statement.

The MIP mentions it in the introductory part and then Nathann has already fixed it for the MILP part. Is there anywhere else in MIP that you have in mind?

I knew something was weird. The doctests passed on my computer, and I was wondering if there was something new with the deprecation warnings, like they are "only shown once" in the first doctests of each file and never again. It all passed.

I guess it was a bug and all functions need to be fixed, which seems natural. I am recompiling the commit over beta1 and I will check it again. Hoping that the doctests fail on my computer, this time `:-P`
