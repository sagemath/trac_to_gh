The upcoming inclusion of ore_algebra will provide the means for a PFiniteSequence class. Nevertheless a lightweight implementation of CFiniteSequence has its place in Sage, and it is available now.

The interface:
* constructed from generating function or recurrence
* guessed from sequence
* provides gf, recurrence, sequence, so practically a conversion between all three
* other: textual description of recurrence, sequence iterator

Possible extensions, not implemented: output of egf, power sum closed form

<div id="comment:13" align="right">Comment 13</div>

Some more comments:
* Your code is apparently limited to sequences with integer or rational coefficients. IMHO it would be best to handle C-finite sequences over arbitrary rings (or perhaps integral domains?). If you don't want to do that, the scope of the code should be clearly documented and there should be a few checks in suitable places<sup>[1]</sup>.
* How about making CFiniteSequences Elements of a proper Parent? Sure, it is not absolutely essential at this point, but that's something we will certainly want in the long run—C-finite sequences [over a given ring] form a ring!—, and designing a suitable interface from the start would save the trouble of deprecating the current one later on!
* If you do implement a "ring of C-Finite sequences over ...", I'd suggest moving it outside of combinat (perhaps to a new package `sage.rings.sequences`?).

[1] Currently, the following examples all behave differently:

```
sage: R.<x> = RR[]; fibo = CFiniteSequence(x/(1-x-x^2)); fibo[10]
55
sage: R.<x> = GF(3)[]; fibo = CFiniteSequence(x/(1-x-x^2)); fibo[10]
...
ValueError: Cannot convert to CFiniteSequence.
sage: R.<x> = CC[]; fibo = CFiniteSequence(x/(1-x-x^2)); fibo[10]
...
TypeError: Unable to coerce 0.000000000000000 (<type 'sage.rings.complex_number.ComplexNumber'>) to Rational
```
Their behaviour is not entirely unreasonable, but it only makes sense if you know that `CFiniteSequence` is going to try converting the input to a rational fraction over `QQ`.

I refrained from creating a specific parent, as the ring is isomorphic to Laurent polynomial fractions. I specifically allowed `ZZ` and `QQ`. So C-finite sequences return their parent as `Fraction Field of Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Rational Field`.

Two guessing algorithms are implemented, Berlekamp-Massey and LLL (faster,default).

An improvement in clarity could be to replace the internal implementation via vanilla polyniomals by Laurent polyniomals (#11726).

I think the math is pretty standard, though I know of no paper about the isomorphism. If I knew algebra better I would write a paper.

I don't think that's how sage objects are supposed to behave! I'd expect the result of `1+s` not do depend on the order. Moreover, I'd expect that things like `1.0+s` or `s+s'` where `s'` is another type of sequence can be made to work in the long run even if they don't all work yet.

Hi,

I just came across this code and I'm willing to review/fix whatever is left cause I would really like to see that into Sage! 

I do agree with the comments on the parent. I find it really weird that the parent is the fraction field. Look at this:


```
sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
sage: fibo = CFiniteSequence(x/(1-x-x^2))
sage: f = x/(1-x-x^2)
sage: f == fibo
True
sage: fibo == f
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
AttributeError: 'FractionFieldElement_1poly_field' object has no attribute 'ogf'
```

Actually, do we really need the CFiniteSequence to extend FractionFieldElement? What method do we use from FractionFieldElement? It seems to me that even if a sequence is represented by a fraction, they are two complete different objects.

You're welcome. This was my early attempt at parenting Sage objects, so there is no particular reason for any oddities. Meanwhile I found that the `guess` algorithm `"sage"` is less general than `"pari"` so you might want to change the default, too. I'll gladly review any additions you make.

<div id="comment:43" align="right">Comment 43</div>

I have changed the architecture so that C-Finite Sequences are no longer sub classes of fraction field elements. Instead, they just store the ogf and belong to their own ring with a proper parent and everything.

I think the new implementation is much cleaner and it's addressing the issues that had been raised before: the behavior and coercions are much more consistent.

Also, it actually makes things easy for the user as you can write directly


```
sage: CFiniteSequence(1+x)
Finite sequence [1, 1], offset = 0
```

even if `x` is a symbolic variable, it gets transformed into a proper fraction field element and the result still has the right parent and everything.

Someone can start reviewing my changes, rws I guess and also mmezzarobba (or whoever wants to look at it). 

I still haven't recompiled the doc but I will do shortly.
