[This ask.sagemath question](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/3212/) points out that although `ymin` and `ymax` appear at various points in the documentation (I'll point out [here](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/plotting/sage/plot/plot.html#sage.plot.plot.plot)), they are not actually mentioned as arguments to `show`!  That should be fixed, since we are trying to be pretty comprehensive otherwise.

Among other things, the fact that you can overwrite these parameters, as in [this question](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/1242/), should be addressed in a few places.  While we're at it, we might as well add a specific example in the plot doc showing two graphs, one with and one without these parameters...
