```
plot(1-4*x^2,.49999,.50001,tick_formatter=.00001.n(digits=7))
```
triggers the "if getting something in SR for a formatter then make sure both LaTeX" branch of the `Graphics.matplotlib` code and somehow that breaks with errors like

```

ValueError: 
\text{\texttt{{-}8e{-}05}}
^
Unknown symbol: \ttext (at char 0), (line:1, col:1)
```
so that mpl, in trying to typeset `-8e^-5` somehow decides to prepend yet another text thing on it.

**Status:** new
