Hello,

here is a review patch.

It looks good to me and you can set to positive review if you want.

One suggestion : maybe Y-Delta and Delta-Y transformations can be useful to have as general methods ? in another ticket ?

by the way, can you name your branch public/something when you modify somebody else's branch ? This way if I have things to change later we don't keep changing the branch name and we can work on the same.
