[This ask.sagemath question](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/3152) points out that 

```
sage: k,n = var('k,n')
sage: f(x,k) = sum((2/n)*(sin(n*x)*(-1)^(n+1)), n, 1, k)
sage: f(x,2)
-2*sum((-1)^n*sin(n*x)/n, n, 1, 2)
```
while

```
sage: f(x)=(2/n)*(sin(n*x)*(-1)^(n+1))
sage: sum(f, n, 1, 2) #using summation function
-sin(2*x) + 2*sin(x)
```
User twch found this workaround

```
sage: var('n')
sage: def g(x,k):
sage:    return sum((2/n)*(sin(n*x)*(-1)^(n+1)), n, 1, k)
sage: print g(x,2)
-sin(2*x) + 2*sin(x)
```
but I agree with him/her that we should look into how to fix this.

The essential problem is that when Maxima does not simplify a sum, we don't have any mechanism (currently) to get it to "just print out all the numbers".  Which of course may not be very nice when `k` is big, but presumably should be allowed to be done by users.

---

By the way, the way to do this in Maxima is as follows:

```

(%i1) f: -2*'sum((-1)^n*sin(n*x)/n,n,1,2);
                                2
                               ====       n
                               \     (- 1)  sin(n x)
(%o1)                      - 2  >    ---------------
                               /            n
                               ====
                               n = 1

(%i8) f, nouns;
                                 sin(2 x)
(%o8)                       - 2 (-------- - sin(x))
                                    2
```
so setting `nouns:true` just for this would work, but I can never figure out how to do this from within Sage - see #10955.

Possibly related: #9424

Naturally, this is orthogonal to the main issue, but I think it should be in a different ticket unless it's very obvious it's okay.

As to the main question, I think my only question is whether this should definitely be incorporated in `simplify_full`.  Can anyone think of a reason *not* to do so?  I'm straining my brain to be creative here - for instance, if it should make a really really really long expression which isn't "simpler"?  I can't find it but there was some Maxima comment about the massive length of some such expressions.  My druthers would be to keep this separate from `simplify_full` for now, though I understand the reasons *for* doing it!

This is just a conflict from having two branches modify `simplify_full` at the same time. You can rebase this one on top of "develop" now and I think it'll be fine. To avoid conflicts, I would,

* Copy/paste the `expand_sum` method somewhere
* reset --hard your branch to match "develop"
* Add back the `expand_sum` method
* Update `simplify_full` and its docstring
* Recommit

I'm sure there's a smarter way to do the copy/paste step, but it works.

In the examples, `n` and `k` are complex, and it doesn't make any sense to sum from, say, zero a complex number. But if anything, the bug there is that `sum()` allows you to give it non-integer limits.

The Maxima docs aren't too clear about what `simplify_sum` does, so it's hard to say whether or not it's safe when the summand contains complex variables. We can try it and see what happens. Since it's hidden beneath `simplify_full` we could always go back and remove it if it causes problems.

Sorry, I meant the log bit.  Wait, was that already in develop?  I merged develop into this branch locally, should have been up-to-date.

Okay, so let's make that a dependency for this so that rws can rebase to that.  Sorry, Ralf, that's not your fault - good thing I ran all the tests!  And I *thought* I had recalled removing that simplification from `simplify_full`.

I get more confused the more I look at this. Ralf's branch in ticket #17556 had mine as a parent, so my commits should have gone in along with his. After switching my branches around a few times, I see them now in develop.

If you `git checkout develop` and then `git pull`, do you see them there? (You can do `git log` then hit forward-slash to search.) If they were there to begin with, there should have been a merge conflict with this branch. But those two simplify doctests shouldn't be failing unless you wound up with a chimera.

Yes.  Though I usually pull from trac not origin.  But in any case the branch I was working with for this ticket also has that already in it.  Yet on that branch I get

```
sage: z = log(3*x)+log(2*x)
sage: z.simplify_full()
log(6*x^2)
```
I don't understand either. And

```
$ git merge develop
Already up-to-date.

Disagree. I remember too that at some time I removed it before doing a local commit. But in ​17dda26 I seem to have added the log involuntarily nevertheless. That's why it's in this ticket branch and I'll remove it now. Then Michael seemed to assume that a different cause happened and based #17731 on that. So it's really me that has to apologize.

I think it's OK to have it in `simplify_full`. It's really annoying to have a sum of integers like,

```
sage: f(n=8)
sum(abs(-k^2 + 8), k, 1, 8)

with no way to get it down to a single number. (You can copy/paste the sum back in, but that may not be an option.) It's also a lot to ask of our users to know every method on the Expression class, but everyone knows `simplify_full`.

If it causes problems, we can remove it. Or if it makes some expressions a lot uglier, there's the hack I used in `simplify_rectform`:

```
if complexity_measure(simplified_expr) < complexity_measure(self):
    return simplified_expr
else:

I think it will be fine though.
