In the first call since the unit group has not yet been computed and cached, a fundamental torsion unit is computed idrectly (using pari).  In the second case it is obtained from the cached unit group, but should have value() applied to convert from an abstract element of the unit group to an actual number field element.

John,

The patch doesn't seem to eliminate the other inconsistency: between `-1/2*a + 1/2` and `1/2*a + 1/2`.  For when `primitive_root_of_unity` is called before `unit_group` it selects the primitive with the shortest string representation.  On the other hand, `UnitGroup.__init__` just uses the element given by Pari's `nfrootsof1`.  There are clearly a variety of ways to sort this out.

Fair comment, but once you have computed the unit group it's quite important to go with its generators or discrete logs get confused.  The shortest-string business (which I wrote, though I cannot quite remember the issue which led me to) is less important.  But what was really needed was not to have the root of unity displaying on the lmfdb.org page of a number field as "u0"!

<a id='comment:8'>Comment 8:</a>
Here's a strange thing.  If I apply the patch (to 5.11), build and test, everything is fine.  But if I restart Sage and type

```
sage: K = QuadraticField(-3)
sage: K.primitive_root_of_unity()1/2*a + 1/2
```
I get

```
1/2*a + 1/2
```
rather than the

```
-1/2*a + 1/2
```
in the doctest.

Now if edit the doctest to read

```
            sage: K = QuadraticField(-3, 'b')
            sage: K.primitive_root_of_unity()
            -1/2*b + 1/2
            sage: UK = K.unit_group()
            sage: K.primitive_root_of_unity()
            -1/2*b + 1/2
```
rebuild and test I get

```
Failed example:
    K.primitive_root_of_unity()
Expected:
    -1/2*b + 1/2
Got:
    1/2*b + 1/2
```
The reason that there is no failure when the generator has the default name `'a'` is caused by the fact that the unit group of this field has already been computed in a doctest for the `S_units` method.  Thus as written the doctest is not testing that the problem has been fixed, since both instances of `K.primitive_root_of_unity()` use the same code.

Since the primitive root of unity is computed using PARI in both cases (either as part of full unit group or using `nfrootsof1`), wouldn't the problem be solved by simply returning whatever is answered by PARI? That is, don't try to find the generator with shortest string representation.

 In the first call since the unit group has not yet been computed and cached, a fundamental torsion unit is computed idrectly (using pari).  In the second case it is obtained from the cached unit group, but should have value() applied to convert from an abstract element of the unit group to an actual number field element.

For reference, let me add that PARI never guaranteed that the result of `nfrootsof1` corresponds to the "torsion unit" computed as part of the class group. However, in practice the units often did correspond.

It seems that PARI-2.9.1 has made this worse with far less cases where the units are the same.
