Hello,

this patch speeds up neighbor iterator method when the original graph is not directed. The speed up is achieved by removing unnecessary set conversions in the graph backend.
(as seen on a figure in ticket [http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/13730](http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/13730).)

Before:

```
sage: G = graphs.RandomBarabasiAlbert(1000,2)
sage: %timeit E = [(u,v) for u in G for v in G.neighbor_iterator(u)]
100 loops, best of 3: 7.8 ms per loop

```

After:

```
sage: G = graphs.RandomBarabasiAlbert(1000,2)
sage: %timeit E = [(u,v) for u in G for v in G.neighbor_iterator(u)]
100 loops, best of 3: 3.58 ms per loop

```

Hello!

I have discussed this with slani, reviewed it and tested it. I think the patch is good to go and would like to give it a positive review, but I give you (Nathann) the last word on this!

What do you think?

Well `O_O`

I was worried that removing this "iter(set(" would create problems with multiple edges, but the code from sparse_graph already avoids that... `:-P`

I would say "good to go", while crossing my fingers with the hope that no code which is not doctested will be reported as broken in a couple of weeks `:-P`

Did you run the tests on the whole Sage library ? Some guys create weird graphs outside of the graph/ folder, and there may be changes to make there too.

Yes, we've made sure that at least the default backend does not return duplicated neighbors in case of multiple edges.

I've now also ran the tests on the whole library. A bunch of things fails but none appears to be relate to the change of this patch :-)

Hello!

I rebased this patch to sage-5.12.beta3 and it passes all graph tests.

Best,

Uros

P.S.
It's also works for hamiltonian cycle test.

```
sage: g = graphs.JohnsonGraph(7, 3)
sage: %timeit g.is_hamiltonian()
10 loops, best of 3: 50.9 ms per loop
```

Well... Of course it was still hanging on my computer, and a couple of hours later I now have a patch fixing the `traveling_salesman` method which had a problem with those f.... non-integer vertices `>_<`

If you agree with this additional patch you can set the ticket to `positive_review`.
