I accidentally misunderstood one of the two definitions of Suter slides in his paper and claimed in the docstring that it would conflict with the other. My apologies for that!

I've also modified the doc of `dominated_partitions` to reflect what the code does. Could have done it the other way round but this sounds more natural.

This branch merges cleanly with my other partitions.py branch (#15428).
