I accidentally misunderstood one of the two definitions of Suter slides in his paper and claimed in the docstring that it would conflict with the other. My apologies for that!

I've also modified the doc of `dominated_partitions` to reflect what the code does. Could have done it the other way round but this sounds more natural.

This branch merges cleanly with my other partitions.py branch (#15428).

Hey Darij,

I made some review changes that make the doc a little more reading IMO. If you're happy with my changes, then you can set a positive review.

Best,

Hey Darij,

I couldn't find any other places in `partition.py` where `l` was used except where it is code formatted to reflect the input variable.
