I haven't had a chance to look at the algorithm yet, but I browsed through the code in the patch and there a couple things.

1) Instead of adding .n.patch for each new version, unless the new version is drastically different simply replace the previous patch with the new one.

2) add a comment "apply patch.name" to specify which patch should be applied

Actually in the code:

3)Replace the 'assert' which are raising AssertionError, with a 'raise' statement and something more meaning full like TypeError or ValueError

4) The monomials() function takes as input the ring it is creating the monomials over. This seems like it should be a member function of the appropriate polynomial ring class instead of a stand-alone function (assuming it isn't already implemented).

5) I'm still debating whether I think macalauy_resultant should also be a member function of some polynomial ring. I'm inclined to say it should be (since resultant() is) but I'm open to arguments against.

6) It appears you can pass in a bunch of polynomials from all different polynomial rings and it won't detect the problem (you just get the parent of the first flist element).

That's all for now. I still need actually look at the algorithm...

ok. I looked at the algorithm today and it looks fine. I also ran some tests comparing against the `primes_of_bad_reduction` function for projective morphisms and the results match (well, at least the primes match).

In additional to my previous comments, I have two suggestions to make this faster and one other comment

1) It seems like you could combine these two loops:
* for mon in mon_d:
* for f in newflist:

2) It also seems like you could always just work with the vector of exponents instead of converting back and forth to monomials with mon_d; i.e. don't use mon_d at all, just use degs.

3) You have a monomials() function, yet you don't use it in the main macaulay_resultant function. Although with (2) you don't need it anyway. You may however want to use some kind of iterator instead of making lists of monomials since you don't need to keep them around after you've used it. I'm sure `WeightedIntegerVectors` has an iterator of some kind.

It would be nice if there were a few comments in the code for `macaulay_resultant` so that it is easier to follow.

The doctest failure is simply a typo. You have "equal to number" instead of "equal number".

Actually, polynomial rings *are* equipped to work with exponent vectors in place of monomials. You can get a coefficient with

```
R.<x,y,z>=PolynomialRing(QQ)
f=2*x^3 + 3*x*y*z + 4*y^3 + 5*y^2+z
f[[0,3,0]]
```

You should also look back up at comment 6 again as issues (3)-(6) still need to be addressed.

The docbuild issue was from making duplicate references. You only need to declare the references once. I fixed that and some minor formatting/doc issues.

As for testing: The functionality is working successfully, but there are two issues to address:

1) the `assert` statements need to be switched to `raiseerror` so that is raises the appropriate error on failure (not just asserterror)

2) I think the speed can be greatly improved on average by changing the way the matrix is built. Currently, all possible monomials are generated and then each entry in the matrix is filled in by checking the coefficient of that monomial in the polynomials. Since I would expect 'most' polynomials to be sparse, it should be more efficient to start with a matrix of all 0s and fill in only those entries corresponding to appropriate monomials in the polynomials.
