TypeError: Argument 'self' has incorrect type (expected sage.libs.pari.gen.gen, got int)
```

We should probably also implement modular `__pow__` and fix a few other operators with the same problem.

The patchbot is complaining about a failed merge, but it can't be too bad, since the branch displays as merging cleanly.  I'm happy with the code changes and give it a positive review, subject to tests passing.
