`sage.rings.qqbar.ANRoot._interval_fast()` creates new interval fields by `type(self._interval.parent())(prec)`, thus bypassing the cache provided by `RealIntervalField()`. Computations with algebraic numbers sometimes need gigabytes of memory to store these parents and the associated coercion structures.

Before (6.2.beta5):

```
sage: set_random_seed(42)
sage: m = get_memory_usage()
sage: %time l = list(QQbar.random_element(poly_degree=3) == 0 for i in range(4000))
CPU times: user 10.7 s, sys: 24 ms, total: 10.7 s
Wall time: 10.7 s
sage: get_memory_usage(m)
7.77734375
```
With patch:

```
sage: set_random_seed(42)
sage: m = get_memory_usage()
sage: %time l = list(QQbar.random_element(poly_degree=3) == 0 for i in range(4000))
CPU times: user 10.5 s, sys: 40 ms, total: 10.5 s
Wall time: 10.5 s
sage: get_memory_usage(m)
0.34375
```

Keywords: **memory, qqbar**

I just tried your example with version 0.1 of ore_algebra (from the RISC homepage), but got an error:

```
sage: rec.generalized_series_solutions(1, infolevel=5)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

----> 1 rec.generalized_series_solutions(Integer(1), infolevel=Integer(5))

TypeError: generalized_series_solutions() got an unexpected keyword argument 'infolevel'
```
Maybe you did use a more recent version of ore_algebra?

It could be that I used the git version, yes. Does it work without `infolevel`?

You are right, my example did not work with ore_algebra 0.1 (I used a development version that does not seem to be publicly available yet).

Hi Marc,

To mention a trac ticket, use :trac:`15493` instead of #15493. That way, there is a nice hyperlink in the documentation!

Once that done, it is ready for positive review.
