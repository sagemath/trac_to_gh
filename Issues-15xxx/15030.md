Switch the `plot` command to use `fast_callable` instead of `fast_float`. This will make commands like `plot(abs(log(x)), x)` work.

Did you check to see what the performance implications of your patch are? I assume that `fast_float` is faster than `fast_callable`, but that is not based on any data.

I think it's because `plot` (look at the function `generate_plot_points` in `sage.plot.plot`) generates float points, and

```
sage: exp(1e5r)
OverflowError: math range error
```

Maybe it should generate RealNumber points instead (I guess they should also be faster than floats for many functions, because MPFR functions are functions are fast)? In any case, that doesn't affect this ticket.

Hmm.. so, you are changing only the plots for symbolic expressions. This patch makes the symbolic expression plots about five times slower.

```
sage: timeit('plot(abs(log(x)), (x, -20, 20))') # with patch
25 loops, best of 3: 18.5 ms per loop

sage: timeit('plot(abs(log(x)), (x, -20, 20))') # without patch
125 loops, best of 3: 3.58 ms per loop
```

What do you think of the following change which introduces only a factor of two slowdown? The main problem seems to be that the fast float stuff does not handle complex numbers, and so we can explicitly specify the domain as CDF. I am not sure what is the default domain.

```
+        from sage.ext.fast_callable import fast_callable
+        from sage.rings.all import CDF
+        return fast_callable(self, vars=vars, expect_one_var=True,
+                             domain=CDF)
```

The timeit results are as follows:

```
sage: timeit('plot(abs(log(x)), (x, -20, 20))')
125 loops, best of 3: 6 ms per loop
```
A few doctests in `expression.pyx` fail, but they can be fixed (by changing their output).

```
so, in my opinion, there is only a slowdown where the original behaviour was incorrect. It is not correct to say "This patch makes the symbolic expression plots about five times slower."

I rebased the patch on 6.2.beta7. LGTM and tests fine in `plot/` and `symbolic/`.

Also, anyone know how this impacts 3d plots?

> Also, anyone know how this impacts 3d plots?

I believe this has no impact on 3d plots. 3d plots from 2d objects goes via `.plot3d()` methods which usually just take the already generated data points. 3d plots created directly are not affected by this patch.
