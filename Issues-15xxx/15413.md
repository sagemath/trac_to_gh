In the notebook:

```
    sage: sys = 1

    sage: sys
    <module 'sys' (built-in)>
```


Discovered by Alexandre Charlin, while he was playing with an example of the book «Calcul Mathématique avec Sage» involving a system of equation that was stored under the name `sys` (see also sage.combinat.tutorial).
