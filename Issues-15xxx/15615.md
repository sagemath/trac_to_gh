Not sure why but it seems the tarballs we shipped did not make the git transition.
The ATLAS-lib dir is also outdated.
Please use the tarball at:
* http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jpflori/upstream/atlas-3.10.1.20140128.tar.bz2

Yes, we also have to generate the autotools project an d put it in.
I'm not so found of not tracking and putting the archdefs tarballs into the ATLAS tarball as there is no easy way to generate them as for the autotools project, or getting them somewhere upstream as for the lapack tarball.

Putting them into our git repo doesn't make it easier to obtain the archdefs either, it jut puts binary crap into our repo. If anything, it makes it worse for non-Sage users to get the archdefs.

Ok, now the archef tarballs are within the "upstream" tarball.
I've taken the opportunity to add a Solaris archdef tarball.
I've slightly reworked the atlas related scripts.
Please review.

Changing the tarball without the version (excluding the patchlevel) is not supported ATM, I think. We cache files in the upstream/ dir as `package-versionwithoutpatchlevel.tar.gz`, so this ticket would break builds for everybody who has the old tarball cached.

Either combine with an upstream version bump or wait until the build system can handle this case.

Apart from that, positive review ;-)
