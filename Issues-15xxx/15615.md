Not sure why but it seems the tarballs we shipped did not make the git transition.
The ATLAS-lib dir is also outdated.

Yes, we also have to generate the autotools project an d put it in.
I'm not so found of not tracking and putting the archdefs tarballs into the ATLAS tarball as there is no easy way to generate them as for the autotools project, or getting them somewhere upstream as for the lapack tarball.
