With 5.13.beta2 I get the following

Using ? on other objects has the same effect.

The problem seems to be that Sage picks up my systems ncurses instead of sage-5.13.beta2/local/lib/libncurses.so.

I don't have a wide version of ncurses in sage-5.13.beta2/local/lib, so it might be that #15080 would fix my problems.
