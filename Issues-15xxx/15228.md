The documentation of `graphs.LjubljanaGraph` claims that the default embedding is obtained from the Heawood graph, while the Heawood embedding is actually the second (and non-default) embedding.

This trivial patch just fixes the typo.

So, I did `git checkout u/ncohen/15228`, then saw that you have interchanged the `if` and the `elif`, I fixed that, committed the changes, and then tried to push. But then, I got

Do you have a simple explanation, or should I post that on `sage-devel`?
