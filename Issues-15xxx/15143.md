This ticket does the following:

- Creates a class for all set partitions.
- Allows equality between different set partitions of different parents.
- Implements a total ordering on set partitions based upon ordering the parts.
- Implements a fully consistent string representation.
- Adds multiple methods, including accessing the base set for the set partition.

Here is a started review. Before I continue, I'd like you to address some questions:

- Your `__mul__` method gives the same result as the existing `inf` method, but seems to be faster at arriving there. Better to reimplement the latter as an alias for the former? If you do so, the docstrings should probably be merged.

- I don't understand the docstring of `ordered_set_partition_action`, nor do I understand the definition given in [LM2011] (but I have not really tried). Maybe you can improve it still? What are `A_{i_1`}, `A_{i_2`} etc.?

- I have replaced the docstring and the implementation of `is_atomic` to something that matches the definition of "atomic" in the context of multiplicative generators of NCSym. I hope this is what you really meant. First, the empty set partition is no longer atomic; second, [[1, 4], [2], [3]] is now atomic despite max(2) < min(3) because there is a max(1, 4) to spoil the game.

- I have removed the part about set compositions in the docstring of `__mul__` because the method only appears on the SetPartition class.

- I see you have changed the parent of all set partitions to not include the base set. I am not saying this is wrong; just letting you know that I cannot fully test the consequences of this change and so my review will be somewhat incomplete even when it is finished.

I'll expand on the docstring.

Let's see if we can close a small can of worms. Well, since `1` usually isn't considered as a generator of a unital algebra, it's okay that the empty set partition is not atomic. I'm assuming that similarly `1` is not considered a primitive of a Hopf algebra.

I made sure to put in some tests for things like equality and for the `is_less_than` and `is_strict_refinement` methods when comparing objects with different parents. Doing it this way will net a (very) small speedup in creation since we don't have to find the right parent by taking the union of sets (I didn't measure). It also made me feel more secure in my implementation of `NCSym`.

I'll post the new version of the patch tomorrow.

I started testing parts of this patch and found a minor bug that the partition type isn't checked.

```

Partition algebras are HUGE; I definitely wouldn't want to see them slowed down by input sanitizing.

I'd be happy if you could see if there is something gained by omitting the check, and if so, making the variable work. But I must admit you have sped up the generation of a set partition by a factor of about 2 (compared to pre-#15143) already, so the net effect is a positive one even if the check is left in.\n\nI still don't understand the doc of `ordered_set_partition_action`.

Thanks for the fixes. In other news, I am now sufficiently convinced of the superiority of `__mul__` that I'm replacing `inf` by an alias to `__mul__`:

```
sage: %timeit SetPartition([[1,3],[2,6,5]]).__mul__(SetPartition([[1,2],[3],[6]]))

I think the `check` variable does nothing when one generates a set partition. I'd be happy if you could see if there is something gained by omitting the check, and if so, making the variable work. But I must admit you have sped up the generation of a set partition by a factor of about 2 (compared to pre-#15143) already, so the net effect is a positive one even if the check is left in.

I still don't understand the doc of `ordered_set_partition_action`. What is unclear to me is this:

```
        `A_{ \{ i_1, i_2, \ldots, i_k \} }` denote the sub-partition
        `\{A_{i_1}, A_{i_2}, \ldots, A_{i_k}\}`.
```

Other than this method, I'll call this review done. Unfortunately, I'm out of leeway now as far as free time is concerned, and someone else will likely have to review the NCSym patch.

Hey Darij,

Hopefully this example will clarify, consider `A = {{1, 4}, {3}, {2,5}}`, then `A_{1,3} = {{1, 4}, {2, 5}}` and `A_{1} = {{1, 4}}` (I've omiting the `\` and subscript `{}` for readability). The check is currently extraneous, but I'll pass it along to the constructor.

Hey Mike,

Alright, and I'll add some more documentation specifying that we are using the terminology for partitions for `size` and `length`.

I'll post a new version later tonight.

Thanks,

Travis

Hey Darij and Mike,

Here's a patch with all of the changes folded in, along with:

- changed `weight` to `size`,
- additions to the `SetPartition` class's documentation about the terminology,
- tweaks to the `ordered_set_partition_action()` method's docstring (in my old version, the condition should have been `r <= |A|` and there was some abuse of variables).

If you're happy with my tweaks, then it's positive_review time.

Thanks,

Travis

Hi Travis,

You don't want s to be an "ordered set partition (i.e., set composition) of `[r]` where `r\leq k`"; you want it to be an ordered set partition of a SUBSET of `[k]` (which may and may not be an initial interval). See this doctest:

```
t = OrderedSetPartition([[2], [3,4]])
```
where it is not an initial interval. Generally, your r's should be k's.

I'm fine with the rest of your changes. Once you've fixed the ordered set partition action docstring, you can set this to positive_review as far as I am concerned. Sorry that I can't help with zabrocki's doctest failure as I'm not near sage right now.
