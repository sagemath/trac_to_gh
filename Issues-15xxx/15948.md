This patch adds marked Dynkin diagrams and marked Cartan types. See http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/15948#comment:18 for details.

This convenient notation is used quite often in a certain subbranch of differential geometry, see e.g. http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.1307, and in Lie superalgebras, where markings denote the parity  of indices.

Moreover, there are two small bugfixes:

1. Documentation is misleading about our convention for arrows in Dynkin diagrams. We do follow Bourbaki convention for graphics (which is apparently the same as in Kac), but not the convention for the underlying Cartan matrix.
2. Dynkin diagrams for D and E series contain a special character in the node name of tikzpicture which TeX doesn't like.

I believe it is useful to have the ability to cross out particular nodes for Dynkin diagrams (I believe the same/similar convention is used for Lie superalgebras to denote even/odd indices).

However I think the `node_label` is redundant to the `label` and you are assuming your indexing set is `1, 2, ..., n`, often which it is not. Similarly, I'm planning to make Dynkin diagrams more immutable (#15739), so I'd rather have it return a new `DynkinDiagram` when changing the crossed out nodes. One last point from a quick look-through, for comparisons with `None` you should do:

```
if x is None:
    pass

if x is not None:
    pass
```

I'll check against Kac tonight. Dan and Nicolas might have some more comments as well.

Best,

Travis

Hi Vít!

Thanks for your work on this. I agree with Travis. Furthermore the current implementation introduces quite some duplication, inside the type-specific latex methods and inbetween them. I guess this duplication could be avoided by factoring out a method, say `_latex_node(node, x,y)` that would handle the writing of the latex string for the node (label, crossing out, ...), and then make the type-specific latex methods use it. What do you think?

Cheers,
                                      Nicolas

The labels which are implemented so far are intended for people who doesn't want to use Bourbaki convention. I think, this feature is not very well documented. My labels are purely a decoration of nodes, which can be used i.e. to denote a homogeneous vector bundle over $G/P$. So I guess the correct thing to do here is to change `node_labels[i]` to `node_labels[label(i)]`, right?

As for immutability issue, will it be OK, if I just add crossed_nodes and node_labels to the constructor and get rid of the setters?

If you feel the `label` is not well documented, then you should document it better. However the best thing to do would be to override the Dynkin diagram's relabel as

```python
def relabel(self, relabeling):
    return DynkinDiagram(self._cartan_type.relabel(relabeling))
```
This would result in:

```
sage: D = DynkinDiagram(['A',4,1])
sage: DL = DynkinDiagram(D._cartan_type.relabel([2,-1,-2,-3,4])) # This would be D.relabel([2,-1,-2,-3,4])
sage: DL
2
O-----------+
O---O---O---O
-1   -2   -3   4
A4~ relabelled by {0: 2, 1: -1, 2: -2, 3: -3, 4: 4}
sage: latex(_)
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.5]
\draw (-1,0) node[anchor=east] {$A_{4}^{(1)} \text{ relabelled by } \left\{0 : 2, 1 : -1, 2 : -2, 3 : -3, 4 : 4\right\}$};
\draw (0 cm,0) -- (6 cm,0);
\draw (0 cm,0) -- (3.0 cm, 1.2 cm);
\draw (3.0 cm, 1.2 cm) -- (6 cm, 0);
\draw[fill=white] (0 cm, 0) circle (.25cm) node[below=4pt]{$-1$};
\draw[fill=white] (2 cm, 0) circle (.25cm) node[below=4pt]{$-2$};
\draw[fill=white] (4 cm, 0) circle (.25cm) node[below=4pt]{$-3$};
\draw[fill=white] (6 cm, 0) circle (.25cm) node[below=4pt]{$4$};
\draw[fill=white] (3.0 cm, 1.2 cm) circle (.25cm) node[anchor=south east]{$2$};
\end{tikzpicture}
```
I agree that we should add the following semantic to `CartanType`:
|           |
|           |

```
sage: CartanType(['A',2], labels=[-1,-2])
```
(or perhaps `label` or `labeling` or...) and for `crossed_nodes`. Yet we should also have an additional method which allows us to set the crossed nodes.

I feel like we should add `type_crossed.py` which keeps/prints this data and uses the same mechanic that the relabeled Cartan types use. Nicolas, do you agree?

Furthermore, I don't like the current state of your printing method. Your iteration of the string is wrong because your assuming your labeling is nice (i.e. `[0, 1, ..., k]`). However that is somewhat moot because I think you should only have one method for printing the individual nodes, as per Nicolas' suggestion, because it is overkill (it's basically just a for loop).

Thanks for your work on this,

There are two problems. First that I do not understand current labeling mechanism properly (code nor use cases -- does anybode use `label` at all?) and second that the semantics here are really different. My `node_labels` represent some other object that has a priori nothing to do with how we label the basis of our Cartan algebra. In reality these `node_labels` denote a highest weight of the Levi part of a standard parabolic subalgebra and thus it should really be a mapping that assigns natural numbers to labels. So perhaps `node_labels` should really be a dictionary with keys `label(i) for i in self.index_set()`  What about this?

```python
def set_node_labels(self, node_labels):
    if isinstance(node_labels, list):
        self.node_labels = {i : node_labels[label(i)-1] for i in self.index_set()}
    else:
         self.node_labels = node_labels
```

As with `label` I am not sure what is the use case here. What is wrong with CartanType having labels, node_labels and crossed out nodes as instance variables?

OK. I've fixed some bugs and now the patch doesn't cause any breakage and works in fulfilling my needs. 

There is still some work to be done. Namely:

1. Modify `repr` so that it prints also node_labels and crossed nodes. (I don't see a point in doing ascii graphics; two simple prints after the current output should do just fine.)
2. Add doctests illustrating the new funcionality.
3. Get rid of setters and move thiese features  to `__init__` in order to help`DynkinDiagram` become immutable.

Is there an interest in getting this patch into sage? Are there some remaining issues that I missed?

Would it help to refactor node_labels` and `crossed_nodes` into dictionaries as I suggested in comment 11?

Okay, done with the refactor and creating the `type_marked`. I couldn't get your latex to work, so I just implemented a custom help for the marks (cross outs). It's now setup so it's easy enough to add additional functionality if anyone wants it.

I've also done some fixing up of the way we print the Dynkin diagram ascii art, so with labels up to length 3 (almost 4 really), it looks nice. I refactored `type_dual` and `type_relabeled` to inherit from a common class `CartanType_decorator` which acts as a decorator class and redirects most methods to the base Cartan type. I've set the (implicit) order of the decorators as

```
dual <- relabelled <- marked
```
where the first one was what was there previously. I also gave a `relabel` method to Dynkin diagrams and Cartan matrices. I think that's all, but I might be forgetting something. If we're happy with my changes, then it's a positive review.

Great!

Is this feature discoverable by a user? Shouldn't we add some examples to `CartanType`'s docstring? 

You've missed the bugfix for docstring regarding our convention for Dynkin diagrams (see commit 74c6d23eb28fd192b70e2219030d6ad60fcb9f0f).

> I've also done some fixing up of the way we print the Dynkin diagram ascii art, so with labels up to length 3 (almost 4 really), it looks nice. I refactored `type_dual` and `type_relabeled` to inherit from a common class `CartanType_decorator` which acts as a decorator class and redirects most methods to the base Cartan type. I've set the (implicit) order of the decorators as

Yes via `marked_nodes`. However we should add something to the doc of `CartanType` (I thought I did, but I guess not).

IMO we should do this in a follow-up ticket as this one has a lot going on to begin with. However it should be easy enough to do by adding a class/file similar to `type_marked.py` and another method to the base `CartanType_abstract` class.

While you are at it, there is a small typo in `type_marked.py`: substitute `latex_relabel` by `latex_marked` in in the docstring.

Hey Vit,

Sorry for falling behind on this.

For the Dynkin diagram documentation, I reread it and agree that the word *convention* could be misleading. I've tweaked that sentence, so how do you feel about it now?

I've also fixed the merge conflicts and the typo. If everything is okay, then we can set this to positive review (as a cross review) and get onto the followups.

Best,

Travis

Hi,
 sorry, I was on vacation. 

The sentence is much better now, but I think it would not harm to add another one ensuring the user that the (graphical representation of the) Dynkin diagram itself is the same as in Bourbaki. But maybe it's superfluous... Does Kac have the same diagrams as Bourbaki? If so, then adding more explanations to the docstring might actually lead to more confusion. :)

Thanks for keeping this branch alive!

I've tried to doctest this on cloud.sagemath.org and it behaves rather strangely. The parallel doctests (e.g. ./sage -tp 12 src/sage/combinat/root_system/) run just fine but when I try to doctest a single file such as ./sage -t src/sage/combinat/root_system/cartan_type.py it spews

```
7 items had failures:
   1 of   2 in sage.combinat.root_system.cartan_type.CartanType_abstract._ascii_art_node
   1 of   2 in sage.combinat.root_system.cartan_type.CartanType_abstract._latex_draw_node
   1 of   2 in sage.combinat.root_system.cartan_type.CartanType_abstract.marked_nodes
   1 of   5 in sage.combinat.root_system.cartan_type.CartanType_affine._ascii_art_node
   1 of   4 in sage.combinat.root_system.cartan_type.CartanType_affine._latex_draw_node

   2 of   3 in sage.combinat.root_system.cartan_type.CartanType_crystallographic.index_set_bipartition
    [432 tests, 8 failures, 1.89 s]
```
with errors such as

```
    AttributeError: 'CartanType_with_superclass' object has no attribute '_ascii_art_node'
```
I guess I must be doing something wrong.
