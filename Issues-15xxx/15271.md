Calling pretty_print_default in a terminal fails:

Perhaps calling pretty_print_default doesn't make much sense in the terminal, but it's used in the emacs interface to be able to display typeset output.

I think doctests pass because the doctesting framework sets sys.displayhook to something else, namely `sage.misc.displayhook.DisplayHook(sys.displayhook)`.  I think the regression was introduced in #15168, and so I have cc'ed the people involved there in case they want to weigh in on how this should be fixed.
