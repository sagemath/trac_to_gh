This is fixed but needs a doctest:

I encountered this bug:

```
sage: y = function('y', x)
sage: desolve(diff(y, x) == sqrt(abs(y)), dvar=y, ivar=x)
c + x
```

This is wrong. Maxima's `ode2` just leaves it as `'integrate(1/sqrt(abs(y)),y) = x+%c`, so there's probably a bug involved in converting to and from Maxima.

Sage now spits out the integral equation with the actual integral solution plugged in: `sqrt(-y(x))*(sgn(y(x)) - 1) + (sgn(y(x)) + 1)*sqrt(y(x)) == _C + x` so I guess this was fixed upstream without a bug report from here.

Nice work with the "right" invocation of `function` as well.

Here is a dumb question.  When the `:trac:` syntax begins a sentence, we get stuff like

which is (in principle) not proper English capitalization.  Obviously this is not a matter of huge mathematical importance, but it doesn't look quite right nonetheless.
