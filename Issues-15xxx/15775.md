This is fixed but needs a doctest:

I encountered this bug:

```
sage: y = function('y', x)
sage: desolve(diff(y, x) == sqrt(abs(y)), dvar=y, ivar=x)
c + x
```

This is wrong. Maxima's `ode2` just leaves it as `'integrate(1/sqrt(abs(y)),y) = x+%c`, so there's probably a bug involved in converting to and from Maxima.

Nice work with the "right" invocation of `function` as well.

Here is a dumb question.  When the `:trac:` syntax begins a sentence, we get stuff like
> trac ticket #9961 fixed (allow assumptions on the dependent variable in desolve):


which is (in principle) not proper English capitalization.  Obviously this is not a matter of huge mathematical importance, but it doesn't look quite right nonetheless.  I'm not suggesting holding up this ticket based on this, but I'm wondering what your thoughts are on this.  In particular, I don't know whether it would be possible for Sphinx to "guess" whether one was at the beginning of a sentence.  We could put in the developer guide a directive not to put this at the beginning of a sentence, but that also seems sort of silly.  Thoughts?
