ATLAS still doesn't build on our potential ARM buildbot. The first patch is for non-utf8 output in

```
vbraun@node3eth0:~$ gfortran --version
GNU Fortran (Ubuntu/Linaro 4.7.2-2ubuntu1) 4.7.2
Copyright � 2012 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
```
But it still doesn't build and fails with

```
/usr/bin/ld: error: xctest uses VFP register arguments, /tmp/ccOJQZXW.o does not
/usr/bin/ld: failed to merge target specific data of file /tmp/ccOJQZXW.o
collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
```

i.e. `mfloat` is always set to `soft`. But on this machine (and on more and more modern ARM chips, I gather) it is `hard`. So this is why, I guess, you get that error.
I suppose a proper detection of `mfloat-abi` should be added, unless upstream already did so.
