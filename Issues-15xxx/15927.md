I've started this discussion on #10963 and that's also where the fix should probably be done (if only to avoid some ugly mergery), but since it's a separate issue I'm opening a new ticket for it.

The Sage categories primer (`src/sage/categories/primer.py`) says that, when you specify a category,

```
``C.super_categories()`` *must* return a list of categories, namely
the *immediate* super categories of `C`.
```

I asked whether this means that it is FORBIDDEN to provide non-immediate supercategories (i.e., categories which are redundant because they are forced by transitivity using the rest of the list). If so, it means that creating a category is harder than the tutorial implies, because not only does one have to ensure that one has added all new relations to the poset of categories, but one also must get rid of all the old relations that have become redundant through the new relations created.

I have done some tests. Apparently there *is* some need for irredundancy:

```

    def super_categories(self):
        return [Groups(), Groups(), Groups()]
....:

The C3 algorithm doesn't like this, and I kind of understand it. I have pushed some documentation about it onto the #10963 branch.

It remains to be seen whether

1) we want to change this behavior. (Is there a situation in which some category takes another category's `super_categories` list and appends more stuff to it without checking if that stuff is already in it? If so, it needs to be changed.)

2) there are some issues with indirect redundancy as well (which then really have to be fixed).
