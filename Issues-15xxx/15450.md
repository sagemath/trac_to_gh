Thanks a lot, Travis. I will also try to find time to have a look at #11726.

I have also touched Laurent polynomials in #15843, by the way.

Replying to [chapoton](#comment%3A6):
> Thanks a lot, Travis.


Not a problem, it was something sorely lacking and easy to review.

> I will also try to find time to have a look at #11726.


Great.

> I have also touched Laurent polynomials in #15843, by the way.


I caught that. I'll add both this and #15843 as dependencies for #11726.
