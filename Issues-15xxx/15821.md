<div id="comment:3" align="right">comment:3</div>

The error traceback points to this code in `sage.structure.parent.Parent._generic_convert_map`:

```python
   cpdef _generic_convert_map(self, S):
        import coerce_maps
        if self._convert_method_name is not None:
            # handle methods like _integer_
            if PY_TYPE_CHECK(S, type):
                element_constructor = S
            elif PY_TYPE_CHECK(S, Parent):
                element_constructor = (<Parent>S)._element_constructor
                if not PY_TYPE_CHECK(element_constructor, type):
                    # if element_constructor is not an actual class, get the element class
                    element_constructor = type(S.an_element())
            else:
                element_constructor = None
            if element_constructor is not None and hasattr(element_constructor, self._convert_method_name):
                return coerce_maps.NamedConvertMap(S, self, self._convert_method_name)
...
```
So, this old code expects that `self._element_constructor` is a type, or otherwise it tries to determine the type of an element.

Today, `_element_constructor_` rather than `_element_constructor` is used, but it is not a type (it is a method).

And looking further down into the code, we find that the element constructor actually is not really used: All what we do with it is to ask

```
hasattr(element_constructor, self._convert_method_name)
```

The point is: `self._convert_method_name` is None in our case! But if there is no `_convert_method_name` then we really don't need the element constructor (as a type) in the code.

Hence, my first guess is that we should first test whether `self._convert_method_name` is None, and immediately skip that code block if it is.

Done.

You can not close a ticket, since you are not release manager. But each ticket needs a positive review before the release manager will close it---even if the ticket is "empty" and the milestone is "duplicate/invalid/wontfix".
