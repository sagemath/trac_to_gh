Currently, to construct a category of algebras, we need to specify the
base ring:

```
    sage: Algebras(QQ)
```

A side effect is that the construction of e.g. `GF(p)['x']` for a
lot of `p`'s in number theoretic calculations triggers the
construction of many parallel hierarchies of categories.

This is a waste because in most situations only the category of the
base ring is relevant. In particular, the generic code provided to
parents/elements/... only depends on the latter.

The purpose of this ticket is to allow for only specifying the
category of the base ring, as in:

```
    sage: Algebras(Fields())
```
with

```
    sage: Algebras(QQ)
```
constructing a subcategory of the former. Then go trough the code,
decide in each case whether we want to use `Algebras(QQ)` or
`Algebras(Fields())`, and update the doctests accordingly. In most
case, the latter idiom will be preferable, unless we need some
operation on the category itself.

This would fix the regression noted on #15792 and made worse by
#10963.

Further features for this ticket or follow-up tickets would be to:

- make `Modules(...)` into a covariant functorial
  constructions. This would give a proper framework for the feature
  `Modules(QQ)` -> `VectorSpaces(QQ)` instead of having to
  tackle it with a special hack.

- implement a `PolynomialRings(...)`  covariant functorial
  construction.

As commented on #10963, I see some questions to be addressed.

If I understand correctly, we sometimes do want to specify the base ring/field, and Volker says that this should be by a "mixin" category (lets call it `FixedBaseRing(...)`) that simply is joined with the non-specific category, say, `Algebras(Fields())`.

First complication: We not only have base rings, but (for bimodules) left and right base rings. Should this be reflected in the "FixedBaseBla" categories as well?

And another complication: We want to have categories expressing the fact that a field (not just a ring) is acting on the objects, and then want to compute the join. Is there an easy programmatic way to let an error be raised when someone tries to compute the join "Algebras(Fields()) & FixedBaseRing(ZZ)"?

Or more precisely, it would accept both kinds of input.

Yup. And later in the category of "polynomial rings over a quotient field."

> Since the parent and element classes only depend on the category of the base ring (by the current implementation), a category refinement would probably not be needed.


Yes.

> But *if* needed, it would amount to take the join with the category "`FixedBaseField(QQ)`, perhaps with super-categories "`FixedBaseRing(QQ)`".


Yes, though I would write it as taking the join with Algebras(QQ).

> Additional technical problem: We not only have base rings, but (for bimodules) left and right base rings. Should this be reflected in the "`FixedBaseBla`" categories as well?


We will want to accept both:

```
    Bimodules(Fields(), Fields())
```
and

```
    Bimodules(QQ, QQ)
```

In a first step, I would not bother about mixed calls likes `Bimodules(QQ, Fields)`/

> And another complication: We want to have categories expressing the fact that a field (not just a ring) is acting on the objects, and then want to compute the join. Is there an easy programmatic way to let an error be raised when someone tries to compute the join "`Algebras(Fields()) & FixedBaseRing(ZZ)`"?


I don't see a trivial way to do it at this point. It certainly would
be a nice feature to bark upon such constructions, but not having it
is not really worst than the current situation where we have:

```
sage: Algebras(QQ) & Algebras(GF(3))
Join of Category of algebras over Finite Field of size 3 and Category of algebras over Rational Field
```

So this issue should not prevent us to proceed even if we don't find a good way out.

OK, that's the other possibility: Rather than having a separate mix-in category `FixedBaseRing(...)`, we would allow both `Algebras(Fields())` and `Algebras(QQ)`.

I have already done some experiments in that direction. We certainly want `Algebras(R.category())` among the super-categories of `Algebras(R)`. But if `C` is a category, do we want that `Algebras(D)` is among the super-categories of `Algebras(C)`, for all `D` in `C.super_categories()`?

When I tried it yesterday, Nicolas' bounded C3 algorithm barked at me. Reason (if I recall correctly, I can't use my laptop right now): We want that `Algebras(QQ)` and `Algebras(QQ.category()` have the same parent and element classes, hence, `_make_named_class_key` returns the same, and thus they also share the cmp-key used in the C3 algorithm. But the C3 algorithm expects that the items on the given lists (here: the list of all super categories) have distinct keys.

One possible approach to solve that problem: The strict super-categories of a category with fixed base ring should *all* be categories with unspecified base rings. Hence, `Algebras(R)` should not have the super-categories `Rings()` and `Modules(R)`, but `Algebras(R.category())`.

This sounds reasonable. A variant would be, for a category over base
ring C, to set `C(R).parent_class` explicitly to
`C(R.category()).parent_class`, bypassing the
`_make_named_class_key` business since it won't really be needed
anymore anyway (and similarly for the element class and so on).

I'd say that we certainly want `Algebras(R)` to be a subcategory
of `Modules(R)`, as tested by `is_subcategory`. But we could
imagine doing like for joins, and *not* put `Modules(R)` in
`Algebras(R).<all_>super_categories()`.

In fact, maybe `Algebras(R)` should really be a join category:
that of `Algebras(Fields()) & Modules(R)`.

<ramble> Here Modules(R) would play a role similar to the category
with axiom `C().A()` associated to the category `C` defining
the axiom `A`. We would not have the option to define the analogue
of a ``category with axioms`` for a subcategory, but at this point I
don't foresee a use for it either.</ramble>

I think `_make_named_class_key` would still be make sense: We need to distinguish the element and parent classes of `Algebras(Fields())` from `Algebras(Rings())`, but probably not from `Algebras(QuotientFields())`. And in particular (when following your suggestion below) we would still want that `Modules(GF(5))` and `Modules(GF(7))` have the same parent and element classes.

Yes, but then one needs a category `FixedBase(R)` to be joined with! And I think that's not so nice, as pointed out in[comment:1](#comment%3A1). Or so I thought. But:

Hmmm. Yes, in that case one wouldn't need an ugly `FixedBase(R)` category...

Well, that's what I commented on at #10963: I was playing with the idea of an axiom `WithFixedBase`, accepting an argument, but Volker has cut the argument short `;-)`.

That would be for free if we make Algebras a functorial construction:
if a category, say `QuotientFields()`, says nothing about algebras
over itself, then `Algebras(QuotientFields())` will actually
return `Algebras(Fields())`.

> And in particular (when following your suggestion below) we would still want that `Modules(GF(5))` and `Modules(GF(7))` have the same parent and element classes.


Right, if we go the join way, we will need to handle the base case of
Modules and have a make_named_class_key mechanism there.

Hi!

I started to work on this. We can now do:

```
    sage: Algebras(Fields())
    Category of algebras over Category of fields
```

(TODO: would be nicer as Category of algebras over fields)

and by default, polynomial rings are created in such categories:

```
    sage: QQ['x'].category()
    Join of Category of euclidean domains and Category of commutative algebras over Category of quotient fields
```
All tests pass in the sage/rings/polynomial.


Here are the new timing for Simon's benchmark about creating lots of
polynomial rings:

With Sage 5.0.1:

```
sage: %time test()
CPU times: user 7.38 s, sys: 0.08 s, total: 7.46 s
Wall time: 7.48 s
```
With develop (6.2.beta7):

```
sage: %time test()
CPU times: user 9.31 s, sys: 125 ms, total: 9.44 s
Wall time: 9.47 s
```
With #10963:

```
sage: %time test()
CPU times: user 17.6 s, sys: 288 ms, total: 17.9 s
Wall time: 17.8 s
```
With #10963 and this ticket:

```
sage: def test():
....:     for p in prime_range(10000):
....:         P = GF(p)['t','x','z']
sage: %time test()
CPU times: user 2.99 s, sys: 127 ms, total: 3.11 s
Wall time: 3.03 s
```

Sounds like the time-performance issue for polynomials is indeed fixed for polynomials :-)

Now, on to matrices!

For the record: I just checked, and with the current version of this
ticket on top of #10963, this runs with constant memory footprint and
about constant time per iteration.

1344
```

With vanilla 6.2.beta6 (no systematic full category initialization for matrices):

```
CPU times: user 2.89 s, sys: 33.6 ms, total: 2.92 s
Wall time: 2.88 s
sage: sage: sage: gc.collect()
5032
sage: sage: sage: gc.collect()
704
```

Hence #15801 as is seems to be going a long way toward fixing this
issue. It's still non negligibly slower than develop on this very
tight loop (and apparently more objects get
allocated/deallocated). But in exchange we are back to systematic full
category initialization which I believe is much nicer to the user.

What do you think?

On to the elliptic curve benchmarks.

Cheers,
                              Nicolas

On the benchmark from #11900, I get significantly the same timing with develop and #10963+#15801:

```
sage: E = J0(46).endomorphism_ring()
sage: %time g = E.gens()
CPU times: user 3.63 s, sys: 94.9 ms, total: 3.73 s
Wall time: 3.90 s    #develop     
Wall time: 3.98 s    #10963
Wall time: 3.86 s    #10963+#15801   
```
This, despite the additional full category initialization.

Yup. And at some point we will want weaker things like `Algebras(SemiRings())` and so on.

> Also I think we should not loose support for having the category of algebras over a fixed base ring.


I agree with that, though more if we want to manipulate the category
"mathematically". From a code perspective point of view, since #11900,
the provided abstract classes only depends on the category of the base
ring, and this has not been a limitation so far.

> For example, given two representations `V`, `W` of a group algebra `RG` over `R`, the morphisms from `V` to `W` as `RG`-modules is (significantly) smaller than the morphisms as `R`-modules. Currently our set of morphisms depends on the category, which if we keep the current setup, would give that `Hom(V, W, Modules(RG)) is Hom(V, W, Modules(R))` (well, maybe only `==`).

Well, as you say, we have two distinct categories:

```
    sage: Modules(Rings())

    sage: Modules(GroupAlgebras(Rings()))

```
so we are fine, aren't we?

Cheers,

> Until I make a group ring over a group ring.


What about:

```
    Modules(Groups().Algebras(Groups().Algebras()))
```

> Actually, maybe a less contrived example of modules over `S = R[a,b] / J` where `R = ZZ[x,y] / I` for some ideals `I, J`. There should be more morphisms as `R` modules than as `S` modules. I think this could be a general issue anytime we try to do extension of scalars (or I'm being completely paranoid).


One thing is that each module M in Sage has a distinguished "base ring".
<digression>
In particular, M can't be in `Modules(R)` and in `Modules(S)`
simultaneously; this can be seen as a limitation of the current
category framework; no other CAS found a good solution to that
though
</digression>

So, if I have two modules M and N, Hom(M,N) actually depends on this
distinguished base ring (they should have the same!).

If I build M and N as R-modules, and M' and N' as S-modules, the fact
that they all belong to the same category only means that the code to
handle and compute the homsets will be the same, not that the homsets
Hom(M,N) and Hom(M',N') themselves will be the same.

Cheers,
                             Nicolas

For now the group algebra construction still uses categories over base
rings. But yes, that's what would happen otherwise.

Cool, thanks! Please proofread my proofreading :-)

I have merged the latest #10963 since I was not sure it would not conflict with my changes.

Running all doctests now with the little tweak from #15919.

I've fixed it by implementing a `_Hom_()` for `Modules` (see commit ac91ed0). This might be more of a hack solution, but it works.

Ah, yes, that could one way to handle it. Thanks!

Sorry for the silence. I have been toying with a variant of it,
putting a similar test in the Homset constructor. I don't know which
one is best. Yours is more local context-wise (it only affects
modules); mine is more local code wise.

However while doing this I stumbled on another issue, which is that
now `X in category` is not necessarily equivalent to
`X.category().is_subcategory(category)`. This is ok theoretically,
but there is at least one spot in the code, namely in Hom, where this
has to be fixed, which in turn opens a can of pickling worms.
Hopefully I'll have a proposal later tonight.

Cheers,
                            Nicolas

I pushed my proposal to #16275.

Thanks to the use of ``X in category`` for sanity checks in Hom, we
can still handle things like:

```
    Hom(ZZ['x'], ZZ['x'], Modules(ZZ))
```

even if ``ZZ['x']`` is now in the category of ``Modules(Rings())``
(which is not a subcategory of ``Modules(ZZ)``).

I'll work tomorrow on double checking everything once #16275 is merged
in this ticket. I might end up preferring my hack rather than the
`_Hom_` hack, because the whole `_Hom_` protocol is not quite
satisfactory, and I'd rather avoid it when we can.

What do you think?

Ok.

No strong opinion either way, but yes, I would lean in this direction
since we don't have yet a proper category hierarchy for
representations. So in the mean time, it makes sense to reserve
`Modules(K)` for what we have used it so far: doing linear algebra
over K, ...

If it makes it easier to switch, so much the better :-)

For the git error, IIRC you need a recent version of git for all tests to pass, and doing
`sage -i git` should do the job.

Are you sure that you use your system-wide `git` when you run the tests in sage.dev? Anyway, my system-wide git does know about `git pull`---only Sage's git doesn't know.
