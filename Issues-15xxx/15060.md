If my understanding of good terminology is correct, this should not be the case (see http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/too+simple+to+be+simple ). Note that `Graph({}).is_tree()` correctly returns `False`.

`O_o`

What is wrong with "a graph is connected if any two vertices are linked by a path" ? An empty graph can be partitionned in connected component, i.e. only one : itself.

> If you are saying it's theology, can't we rather output an error instead of claiming it is "True"?


I would love it to be `"ValueError: We don't know whether an empty graph is connected. We discussed it, and just never agreed on anything"`

It would make it a very practical issue rather than a theoretical one, and emphasize that definitions are mostly what people agree on `:-P`

The same should hold for `Graph({}).is_tree()` of course `:-P`

You will also see at a lot of places that a graph is connected if and only if any two vertices are linked by a path.

> So... what do the various standard texts say about this?  Maybe they are silent on the question?


Because there are moments when you want them to be connected, other when you don't want them to be. I just had a look at Diestel's book (page 2, http://www.math.uni-hamburg.de/home/diestel/books/graph.theory/preview/Ch1.pdf) :

"For the empty graph (\emptyset,\emptyset) we simply write \emptyset. A graph of order 0 or 1 is called trivial. Sometimes, e.g. to start an induction, trivial graphs can be useful; at other times they form silly counterexamples and become a nuisance. To avoid cluttering the text with non-triviality conditions, we shall mostly trat the trivial graphs, and particularly the empty graph \emptyset with generous disregard."

After which he defines connectedness by : "A non-empty graph G is called connected if [..]".

> Perhaps it is better to *document* that we follow a certain convention (probably the more obvious one, in this case),


We also disagree on the most obvious one I guess `:-P`
We had another battle like that about whether the complete graph and the empty graph are strongly regular. I was decided that they weren't because there is a theorem saying that strongly regular graphs have exactly 3 eigenvalues `:-PPPP`
(needless to say I don't agree with that `:-P`)

> and then in documentation for anything about connected components point it out again.  If we really have to.  


Come on.. Nobody reads these things before finding a bug in the code, everybody assumes that his own definition of connectivity is right. To me any definition is a mistake.

> I don't quite see why there are infinitely many decompositions,


He claims that you can add as many empty graphs to a "connected subgraphs decomposition" as soon as you assume the empty graph to be connected.

> since the empty graph does not have any connected components (which is not quite the same as a connected graph) - or perhaps I err in thinking a component has to be non-empty.


Well, if you add nonempty to the definition of connected components decomposition then everything is fine.

> Naturally, this is all just deciding on a definition.  But it's not quite the same as 1 not being a prime number (and note Conway's argument that 1 and -1 *do* count, but as prime *powers*, not "primes", whatever those are - perhaps something analogous could work with sets or graphs, who knows).


It's a word play. It's theology `:-P`

The truth is that we could take any definition and explain at length why it's the best way to see it. And usually it is to make our favorite theorems work for the empty graph too `:-P`

We should just raise an exception when an empty graph is created : `ThisThingDoesNotExistException : it's safer to deny the existence of the empty graph. It really creates a lot of problems if you don't` `:-P`

Otherwise the notion of a connected component seems less useful.  But I suppose it's all a matter of one's favorite definition, as we all seem to agree.

I think that leaving it as it is, with a brief comment we can point to when people complain, is easiest.

After all, changing this could also lead to unintended consequences in other code that assumed implicitly that this worked.  I suppose it's also an API change in some ways.",

<a id='comment:11'></a>> > As a non graph-theorist... I was wondering whether the empty graph should be a connected graph with zero connected components.  Though one of the definitions on that math.SX question suggested one connected component is the definition of connected.

Well, yes, that was the definition that I (and you) had in mind.  Just because I'm not a graph theorist doesn't mean I'm not fairly conversant with graph theory ;-)

> Because there are moments when you want them to be connected, other when you don't want them to be. I just had a look at Diestel's book (page 2, http://www.math.uni-hamburg.de/home/diestel/books/graph.theory/preview/Ch1.pdf) :

> "For the empty graph (\emptyset,\emptyset) we simply write \emptyset. A graph of order 0 or 1 is called trivial. Sometimes, e.g. to start an induction, trivial graphs can be useful; at other times they form silly counterexamples and become a nuisance. To avoid cluttering the text with non-triviality conditions, we shall mostly trat the trivial graphs, and particularly the empty graph \emptyset with generous disregard."


That sounds like a good approach, but one that doesn't work for computers :(

> > since the empty graph does not have any connected components (which is not quite the same as a connected graph) - or perhaps I err in thinking a component has to be non-empty.

Right, that's what I meant.  Otherwise the notion of a connected component seems less useful.  But I suppose it's all a matter of one's favorite definition, as we all seem to agree.  Is the theorem what defines connectedness, or is the definition what leads to the theorem?  That's sort of what's going on here.

Well, have fun resolving this!  I think that leaving it as it is, with a brief comment we can point to when people complain, is easiest.  If it really is a bug at #14529, that is different, but it probably just means that patch needs some slight adjustment.  After all, changing this could also lead to unintended consequences in other code that assumed implicitly that this worked.  I suppose it's also an API change in some ways.

Does it ? Well, what do you think of this "WeHaveNoIdeaException" ? Do you think it's not a good way out ?

Yepyep, it can be fixed with a `if G.order() == 0`.

<a id='comment:20'></a>I just thought, what about dropping the definition for graph connectedness at all.
and introduce three different cases instead:

- a graph has 0 components
- a graph has exactly 1 component
- a graph has 2 or more components

At least we are able to count ;-)


I think If we cannot handle special cases consistently even in theory, we will never ever be able to implement it without getting tons of worms...
