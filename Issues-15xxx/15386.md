From https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-support/dwR4kuBmiQo :

```
n = var('n')
assume(n>0)
series = -(3*n^2 + 1)*(-1)^n/sqrt(n^5 + 8*n^3 + 8)
limit(series, n=infinity)
38/25*pi^2*und
```
...when the limit is clearly zero.

The problem seems related to the `n^2` in the numerator:

```
sage: series = -(1)*(-1)^n/sqrt(n^5 + 8*n^3 + 8)
sage: limit(series, n=infinity)
0
sage: series = (n^2)*(-1)^n/sqrt(n^5 + 8*n^3 + 8)
sage: limit(series, n=infinity)
-38/75*pi^2*und
```

This seems to be an upstream problem with Maxima (see the sage-support thread).

What I meant by "basing a commit on another ticket" is what is described in the section "Branching out" on the page you linked to.  When you create a branch, it will be based on the current branch, unless you specify an alternative base (with `git branch NAME BASE` or `git checkout -b NAME BASE`, where `NAME` is the name of the new branch and `BASE` the existing branch on which the new one should be based).  This can only take a single dependency into account; if there are multiple dependencies you still have to add them with `git merge` after creating the branch.

Good point.  It's probably confusing for the patchbot as well...

Ah, I see.  So rather than just making all of these tickets part of the same local branch on my computer, I should have
* imported the Maxima branch
* created a new branch based on that for ticket A
* finished that
* gone back to the Maxima branch
* created a new branch for the next ticket B
* done that
* and so forth
Is that right?  And that would have avoided some of the merges too.  Maybe.
