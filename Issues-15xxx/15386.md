From https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-support/dwR4kuBmiQo :

```
n = var('n')
assume(n>0)
series = -(3*n^2 + 1)*(-1)^n/sqrt(n^5 + 8*n^3 + 8)
limit(series, n=infinity)
38/25*pi^2*und
```
...when the limit is clearly zero.

The problem seems related to the `n^2` in the numerator:

```
sage: series = -(1)*(-1)^n/sqrt(n^5 + 8*n^3 + 8)
sage: limit(series, n=infinity)
0
sage: series = (n^2)*(-1)^n/sqrt(n^5 + 8*n^3 + 8)
sage: limit(series, n=infinity)
-38/75*pi^2*und
```

This seems to be an upstream problem with Maxima (see the sage-support thread).

Depends on #13973
Depends on #11894

That's all we [the reviewers] need to know (and we can also do `git diff <base_branch>` too).

LGTM.

In hindsight you could have based the commit on #11894 (which includes the other dependencies), or even on #13973 (since #11894 and #13712 only make changes in a different file than your patch).  A "minimalist" solution would be to make the change on a clean development branch and to test with #13973 merged, but not to push this merge commit.  As I see it, the tickets in the "dependencies" field do not necessarily have to be merged into the branch for this ticket.

It is practically inevitable that many Trac tickets end up with more dependencies (and merge commits) than strictly necessary, so let's not worry about that too much.  I agree with Travis's positive review.

What I meant by "basing a commit on another ticket" is what is described in the section "Branching out" on the page you linked to.  When you create a branch, it will be based on the current branch, unless you specify an alternative base (with `git branch NAME BASE` or `git checkout -b NAME BASE`, where `NAME` is the name of the new branch and `BASE` the existing branch on which the new one should be based).

Ah, I see.  So rather than just making all of these tickets part of the same local branch on my computer, I should have
* imported the Maxima branch
* created a new branch based on that for ticket A
* finished that
* gone back to the Maxima branch
* created a new branch for the next ticket B
* done that
* and so forth
Is that right?  And that would have avoided some of the merges too.  Maybe.
