This should instead return 4 (the sum of the entries of the composition c31). This bug appears only interactively; in methods sum() is fine.

The reason why this bug happens in this particular situation is that `sum` is defined as a `@`staticmethod in the `Composition` class. This method is not supposed to be called on a particular composition (it is a `@`staticmethod after all!), but nevertheless makes `hasattr(expression, 'sum')` return True when `expression` is a composition. Something should be done about it.
