The last part of the new changelog entry in `ell_wp.py` is no longer accurate.  Besides that, positive review.

(Maybe the additional change proposed in[comment:9](#comment%3A9) isn't the best one; perhaps there are elliptic curves where more coefficients of the series are well defined, in which case a `NotImplementedError` is better than an algorithm-independent `ValueError`.)

I have no idea, I don't know the mathematics well enough.
