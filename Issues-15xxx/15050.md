Analysis:
* There is a circular reference between the ToricVariety and the CohomologyRing. 
* The unpickler therefore must work with half-constructed objects and only later fill in the attributes.
* The CohomologyRing inherits from UniqueRepresentation, so it will try to look in the unique representation cache
* For that, we need `__hash__()` of the toric variety which is provided by CategoryObject
* The hash depends on `__repr__()` which accesses attributes of the toric variety that are not yet filled in.

Hi Volker, hi Andrey,

while this patch fixes the issue with the CohomologyRing, there are several other internally cached objects that give rise to the same problem, namely those generated after calling

```
Todd_class, Chern_class, Chern_character, Kaehler_cone, Mori_cone
```
These bugs can be fixed analogously to what you did for the methods above (tried it sucessfully on my local version), but I'm not sure how to get git to make a new patch. (Hopefully that'll change in three weeks in Oxford.)

Cheers,
Jan
