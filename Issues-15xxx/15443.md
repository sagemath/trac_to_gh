ecm uses different seeds all the time, for example 

```
echo 179424673 | /home/vbraun/Code/sage/local/bin/ecm -I 1 -c 1000000000 -cofdec -one 8.0
```
produces a different output every time.

---

Occasionally, ecm.py does a lot more factorizations and then eventually times out. Using strace, I see that, for example, the following is run when it eventually times out;

```
echo 251951573867253012259144010843 | /home/vbraun/Code/sage/local/bin/ecm -I 1 -c 1000000000 -cofdec -one 8.0
```
Note that the command is rather slow (requires hundreds of trial steps) and that this prime (251951573867253012259144010843) is usually not used as an ecm input. So occasionally (but unlikely) one of the previous computations must yield this number as candidate and then factoring it takes a really long time.

In fact, the problematic doctest is factoring `(2^197 + 1)/3`. Usually, this yields from ecm:

```
Factor found in step 2: 197002597249
Found probable prime factor of 12 digits: 197002597249
Composite cofactor 339872432034468861533158743041639097889948066859 has 48 digits
```
But randomly (and rather unlikely):

```
Factor found in step 2: 265748496095531068869578877937
Found composite factor of 30 digits: 265748496095531068869578877937
Probable prime cofactor 251951573867253012259144010843 has 30 digits
```
So this is the origin of the prime 251951573867253012259144010843, which is then subsequently factored (but apparently very slowly).

So it seems that the "Found input number N" output doesn't imply that it is probably prime. Some documentation would have been nice, too. Though that leaves the question: how should we decide to give up? If the number is actually prime then it always ends in "Found input number N", so we can't just repeat until we find a factor. The readme says

```
5 - if no factor is found, either increase D by 5 digits and go to 0, or use 
    another factorization method (MPQS, NFS)
```
but doesn't give any probability estimate in that case. Also, one of the factors in question is only 17 digits so the B1-values tried should have been just fine.

I'd expect it to be available somewhere, yes, at the very least in PARI/GP. Baillie-PSW seems to be particularly bullet-proof (in the physics sense), with no known pseudo-primes. Finding a counterexample could raise some money for the sage foundation.

Implementation accessible in sage:

```
sage: pari(N).ispseudoprime()
```

(so, presently, no-one is aware of a particular composite value of N for which this returns true, although I suspect no-one would conjecture such values don't exist)

To be clearer, you mean you run the probable primality test on what ECM.factor() returns and only stop if all factors pass?
So in the previous failing tests from [comment:9](#comment%3A9), it will continue testing other curves when we were unlucky and ECM returned the composite input number?

Groumpf, or rather if it does not pass probable primality at first, you only stop when the number of returned factors is strictly greater than one?
If you went for that, [comment:23](#comment%3A23) will be solved, but not [comment:9](#comment%3A9).
So another question, is it still possible to call ECM without that additional probable primality test?

From my point of view, we should just accept the fact that ECM sometimes returns the full composite number (just as it will return factors which are composite), but document it and modify the doctests.

Maybe you want to read the `factor()` method. First primality test, if that fails run ecm until it finds a factor. Repeat until you get a prime factorization.

There is already a method `find_factor()` that just runs the ECM output and may or may not return a factor. But that is a) annoying to doctest and b) not very user-friendly.
