Basically, 

```
Sage uses divisors(n) for the number (usually denoted d(n)) of divisors of n and sigma(n,k) for the sum of the kth powers of the divisors of n (so divisors(n) and sigma(n,0) are the same). For example:
```

```
Sage uses divisors(n) for the list of (positive) divisors of n and sigma(n,k) for the sum of the kth powers of the divisors of n (so sum(divisors(n)) and sigma(n,0) are the same). For example:
