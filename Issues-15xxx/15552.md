The function `enumerate_totallyreal_fields_prim` is supposed to return, according to its description,

```
   OUTPUT:

   the list of fields with entries "[d,f]", where "d" is the
   discriminant and "f" is a defining polynomial, sorted by
   discriminant.
```
Let us look at an output:

```
sage: E = enumerate_totallyreal_fields_prim(2, 10); E
[[5, x^2 - x - 1], [8, x^2 - 2]]
sage: E[0][1].parent()
Interface to the PARI C library
```
We notice from here that the polynomial does not actually belong to the polynomial ring of `QQ`. In fact, there is no nice way to directly get the polynomial, as in an element of `PolynomialRing(QQ)` from `E[0][1]`, which can be then used to construct the number field.

The only way to do this is this lengthy and tedious procedure:

```
sage: Ecoef = [QQ(_) for _ in E[0][1].list()]
sage: x = polygen(QQ)
sage: Epol = sum(x**i * _ for i,_ in enumerate(Ecoef)) 
sage: Epol, Epol.parent()
(x^2 - x - 1, Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Rational Field)
```

The output of the function itself should give back elements of the polynomial ring, instead of giving us elements which are simply output of pari.

---

Additionally,

1. the first entry of each list should belong to Sage's `Integer` ring instead of being just a python `int`.
2. the functions `enumerate_totallyreal_fields_all` and `enumerate_totallyreal_fields_rel` should get the same fix.

Yes, this should certainly be changed.  And it would also be better if the integer returned was a Sage `Integer`.  At the moment `E[0][0].factor()` fails.

Indeed.

This is also a problem with all the other `enumerate_totallyreal_*` functions.

<a id='comment:6'></a>The patches do not deal with the trivial `n=1` case of`enumerate_totallyreal_fields_prim`.  However, the code for this trivial case has *never* worked.  It needs to be moved earlier, before the line

```
    T = tr_data(n_int,B,a)
```
which causes an error when `n==1` (because of a call to `hermite_constant(0)`).  Similar remarks apply to `enumerate_totallyreal_fields_rel` when `m=1`.

There are many other problems with these functions: 
* poor documentation (e.g., the meaning of the four integers `counts` which are output when `return_seqs=True` is not explained); 
* other features not standard in Sage (e.g., built-in file output); 
* too few doctests; 
* over-dependence on PARI (e.g., the following works, as in the doctest:

```
sage: enumerate_totallyreal_fields_rel(NumberField(x^2 - 2, 't'), 2, 2000)
[[1600, x^4 - 6*x^2 + 4, xF^2 + xF - 1]]
```
but

```
sage: enumerate_totallyreal_fields_rel(NumberField(x^2 - 2, 'a'), 2, 2000)
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
PariError: incorrect type in gsigne
```
In Sage, unlike PARI, the names of variable/generators should not matter.)

But I suppose these are for a different ticket.

I see that with `verbose=True` a brief description, but not one that I can fully understand, is given of the four counts.

I would suggest making just the minimal changes required to allow Sage output and to cover the trivial cases and leaving it to someone who understands the algorithm (which I don't) to do the rewrite needed to modernise the functions.

<a id='comment:11'></a>This is still not completely ready for review -- need to verify that the outputs are fine. But you can look into the changes if you want.

I am actually not confident that the functions give the output corresponding to the documentation! The statements that we get with `verbose=True` do not match the output (for example the discriminant bound). I guess we can just fix the output here and leave the actual program to someone who knows this stuff inside out.

Here is a sample run after my patches.

```
sage: ZZx = ZZ['x']
sage: F.<t> = NumberField(x^2-2)
sage: enumerate_totallyreal_fields_rel(F, 2, 2000, verbose=True) # m=2
