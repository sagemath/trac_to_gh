The function `enumerate_totallyreal_fields_prim` is supposed to return, according to its description,

```
   OUTPUT:

   the list of fields with entries "[d,f]", where "d" is the
   discriminant and "f" is a defining polynomial, sorted by
   discriminant.
```
Let us look at an output:

```
sage: E = enumerate_totallyreal_fields_prim(2, 10); E
[[5, x^2 - x - 1], [8, x^2 - 2]]
sage: E[0][1].parent()
Interface to the PARI C library
```
We notice from here that the polynomial does not actually belong to the polynomial ring of `QQ`. In fact, there is no nice way to directly get the polynomial, as in an element of `PolynomialRing(QQ)` from `E[0][1]`, which can be then used to construct the number field.

The only way to do this is this lengthy and tedious procedure:

```
sage: Ecoef = [QQ(_) for _ in E[0][1].list()]
sage: x = polygen(QQ)
sage: Epol = sum(x**i * _ for i,_ in enumerate(Ecoef)) 
sage: Epol, Epol.parent()
(x^2 - x - 1, Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Rational Field)
```

The output of the function itself should give back elements of the polynomial ring, instead of giving us elements which are simply output of pari.

---

Additionally,

1. the first entry of each list should belong to Sage's `Integer` ring instead of being just a python `int`.
2. the functions `enumerate_totallyreal_fields_all` and `enumerate_totallyreal_fields_rel` should get the same fix.

Yes, this should certainly be changed.  And it would also be better if the integer returned was a Sage `Integer`.  At the moment `E[0][0].factor()` fails.

Indeed.

This is also a problem with all the other `enumerate_totallyreal_*` functions.

Adding some patches to fix this. I introduce a new keyword that can be
set to False to give Sage objects. By default, the new keyword does not
change the current behavior of these functions. This is needed because the
functions are used internally, and possibly by others to.

The patches do not deal with the trivial `n=1` case of`enumerate_totallyreal_fields_prim`.  However, the code for this trivial case has *never* worked.  It needs to be moved earlier, before the line

```
    T = tr_data(n_int,B,a)
```
which causes an error when `n==1` (because of a call to `hermite_constant(0)`).  Similar remarks apply to `enumerate_totallyreal_fields_rel` when `m=1`.

There are many other problems with these functions: 
* poor documentation (e.g., the meaning of the four integers `counts` which are output when `return_seqs=True` is not explained); 
* other features not standard in Sage (e.g., built-in file output); 
* too few doctests; 
* over-dependence on PARI (e.g., the following works, as in the doctest:

```
sage: enumerate_totallyreal_fields_rel(NumberField(x^2 - 2, 't'), 2, 2000)
[[1600, x^4 - 6*x^2 + 4, xF^2 + xF - 1]]
```
but

```
sage: enumerate_totallyreal_fields_rel(NumberField(x^2 - 2, 'a'), 2, 2000)
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
PariError: incorrect type in gsigne
```
In Sage, unlike PARI, the names of variable/generators should not matter.)

But I suppose these are for a different ticket.

Number theory is not my area at all. I just fixed what I could! I will have to ask a friend or colleague to understand the output.

If you have a ready explanation for the variables/output, please go ahead and add them to the documentation. These functions themselves are very old and poorly documented, as you have noticed.

I see that with `verbose=True` a brief description, but not one that I can fully understand, is given of the four counts.

I would suggest making just the minimal changes required to allow Sage output and to cover the trivial cases and leaving it to someone who understands the algorithm (which I don't) to do the rewrite needed to modernise the functions.

This is still not completely ready for review -- need to verify that the outputs are fine. But you can look into the changes if you want.

I am actually not confident that the functions give the output corresponding to the documentation! The statements that we get with `verbose=True` do not match the output (for example the discriminant bound). I guess we can just fix the output here and leave the actual program to someone who knows this stuff inside out.

Here is a sample run after my patches.

```

sage: F.<t> = NumberField(x^2-2)
sage: enumerate_totallyreal_fields_rel(F, 2, 2000, verbose=True) # m=2

==> [-1, t + 1, 1] has discriminant 2624 > B
==> [-2, 1, 1] is not absolutely irreducible
==> [-1, t, 1] has discriminant 2304 > B
==> [t - 1, t, 1] is not squarefree
==> [-t - 1, t, 1] is not squarefree
==> [-2, 0, 1] is not squarefree
