Implementation of a combinatorial object called interval-poset which represent an interval of the Tamari lattice. In particular, it is linked to Dyck paths and binary trees. 

I have implemented all the basic methods. I still have other methods (composition, involution) but I leave them for some later ticket because this one is quite big.

Summary:

- adding the classes TamariIntervalPoset and TamariIntervalPosets with a lot of simple and useful combinatorics on it (iteration, size of the interval, maximal chain, ...)
- adding methods in Dyck paths and Binary trees to get Tamari intervals

Hello,

I have made many small changes to put the code into the pep8 standard. And also corrected a few typos, and changed the name of `size` method into `cardinality`, with a better way to compute the formula.

Thank's a lot! I had to fix the cardinality because the new (better) method that you implemented did not work for n=0. 

Everything looks fine to me. Do you think it needs more review? Darj, do you want to have a look?

Well, I have not really done a review, but just had a quick look. It still needs more attention, I think. Some things to do:

1) In your correction, it should be n == 0 instead of n==0 (pep8 standard...)

2) These new objects should rather not be imported in the global namespace.

I haven't reviewed it, but just some notes:

- Yes, please don't import the new module into global namespace. This seems like a case for lazy import, if not less (what about `Posets.TamariIntervalPoset`?).

- I suspect `greater than ``self``` should be `greater or equal to ``self```.

- I want more doc and possibly more references. What is a Tamari interval? (I am talking about intervals in the Tamari order, not about the general "Tamari interval-posets" which you define nicely. I kind-of know the answer in the case of trees, but I wouldn't be surprised if there are nonstandard choices to make.)

- The way you are using "vertex parent", it seems that "vertex ancestor" would be more appropriate. Is this standard notation?

- "contained into" should be "contained in". (There is a line break between "contained" and "into" where this error occurs, in case you want to find/replace.)

- `t \leq t2` should be `t \leq t_2` in LaTeX mode.

- Is it necessary to define a method called `cardinality` which computes something different from the cardinality of the poset? I would call it something like `interval_cardinality` instead...

- Please don't be shy and link to the arXiv number of your paper:

```
:arxiv:`1212.0751v1`
```

As you see I'm nitpicking, and the patch doesn't seem to have serious issues from a quick glance at it. If you want me to review it, I can do so, just let me know.

Yes I agree it shouldn't be in the global name space. I'm trying to figure a solution where it can still be found quite easily. Posets don't seem to be the right place, it is not directly a poset object and is mostly not linked to the poset theory.

Where is that? I can't find it.

> - I want more doc and possibly more references. What is a Tamari interval? (I am talking about intervals in the Tamari order, not about the general "Tamari interval-posets" which you define nicely. I kind-of know the answer in the case of trees, but I wouldn't be surprised if there are nonstandard choices to make.)


I have added a few ref and explanation. A Tamari interval is just a couple comparable elements in the Lattice, the way you represent elements (Trees, Dyck paths, whatever) does not matter.

What method are you referring to exactly? I understand a parent to be the unique direct ancestor of a node in a tree, in this sense, ancestor is not working (as it can be a level 2 or 3 ancestor).

Ok fixed.

fixed

You're right, I changd it to `interval_cardinality` which is clearer.

Done

It would be great if you were reviewing it. I'm aware that it's quite some work, so do as you feel. Frederic already knows the object themselves as we have worked on them a bit. Your opinion would be very valuable as you're not familiar with the subject (especially on the doc). I'm the only one really who knows about these stuff and one of the purpose of this patch is to make it available, understandable and usable by everyone else. 

Anyway, I have pushed most of the changes you suggested. (I haven't changed the global import yet)

Only minor changes so far (I was busy fixing my own git errors most of the time...).

I think we should merge #14498 into this branch, shouldn't we? I'm referring to one of the methods from #14498 for its doc. (Namely, for the definition of the Tamari order on trees. By the way, does that definition play well with the one you are using?)

I have revamped your references as they were too short and conflicting with some existing ones ("Cha" is way too common for an identifier).

This is probably a stupid question a more careful look at the code would answer, but where do I find a method to turn a Tamari interval-poset into a poset? While you have redefined some poset-theoretical methods, there are still many more in the Poset class.

I've added an arXiv identifier to the Chapoton reference. If you are aware of the paper being more up-to-date than the arXiv preprint, please remove it again.

If I remember correctly, the Tamari lattice projects onto the Bruhat poset (one of the two, I never remember which); are there any methods for this?

> I think we should merge #14498 into this branch, shouldn't we? I'm referring to one of the methods from #14498 for its doc. (Namely, for the definition of the Tamari order on trees. By the way, does that definition play well with the one you are using?)


We should merge nly if there is a conflict.. Is there any? And if you're asking if the definition of the Tamari order is the same: yes of course. And I added a method on the binary tree class to get an interval-poset.

Thank you

> This is probably a stupid question a more careful look at the code would answer, but where do I find a method to turn a Tamari interval-poset into a poset? While you have redefined some poset-theoretical methods, there are still many more in the Poset class.


This was no stupid question. The poset was stored in ``self._poset`` but I have added a ``poset()`` method which makes it more visible.

The ``linear_extensions`` method return permutations which are linear extensions of the interval-poset. They form indeed an interval of the right weak order. There are also the two methos ``max_linear_extention`` and ``min_linear_extention`` which return both ends of the right weak order interval. Tell me if you think there should be more or better documented methods.

Sorry, just a sign of life from me. Semester's starting and I probably won't have much time until next weekend, so if anyone feels like beating me to this, please do! In the meantime:

- You were right about vertex parents; my apologies for the confusion.

- The docstring for `decreasing_cover_relations` appears to be a copy of that for `increasing_cover_relations`.

- Also a typo: "pemutation".

One little step made, including fixes for the issues noticed above.

Here:

```
    Interval-posets of size `n` are in bijection with intervals of
    the Tamari lattice of binary trees of size `n`.
```
I'd prefer a precise reference to a docstring describing this bijection, or to a paper giving it. Could you do this? Thanks a lot.

Hi Darj,

I've checked your edits and yes you've got the description right! Thank you also for implementing the complement. I've added some docs and tests into it (to understand what it does in terms of the lattice itself).

Also, I've added two new methods to check if an interval is initial/final.

Sorry for the delays :/ I'm trying to get this done.

There is some reversal of permutations lurking somewhere in either the code or the theory:

```
sage: p = Permutation([2,4,1,6,5,3])
sage: t = p.binary_search_tree(); t
2[1[., .], 4[3[., .], 6[5[., .], .]]]
sage: i = t.tamari_interval(t); i
The tamari interval of size 6 induced by relations [(1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6), (6, 4), (5, 4), (4, 2), (3, 2)]
sage: lins = i.linear_extensions()
sage: list(lins)
[[5, 6, 3, 4, 1, 2],
 [5, 6, 3, 1, 4, 2],
 [5, 6, 1, 3, 4, 2],
 [5, 3, 6, 4, 1, 2],
 [5, 3, 6, 1, 4, 2],
 [5, 3, 1, 6, 4, 2],
 [5, 1, 6, 3, 4, 2],
 [5, 1, 3, 6, 4, 2],
 [3, 5, 6, 4, 1, 2],
 [3, 5, 6, 1, 4, 2],
 [3, 5, 1, 6, 4, 2],
 [3, 1, 5, 6, 4, 2],
 [1, 5, 6, 3, 4, 2],
 [1, 5, 3, 6, 4, 2],
 [1, 3, 5, 6, 4, 2]]
```

Actually, the problem seems to be in the trees code, and it's a bug because it contradicts the doc:

```
sage: p = Permutation([2,4,1,6,5,3])
sage: b = p.binary_search_tree()
sage: [Permutation(a).binary_search_tree() for a in b.sylvester_class()]
[1[., 3[2[., .], 5[4[., .], 6[., .]]]],
 3[1[., 2[., .]], 5[4[., .], 6[., .]]],
 3[1[., 2[., .]], 5[4[., .], 6[., .]]],
 3[1[., 2[., .]], 5[4[., .], 6[., .]]],
 3[1[., 2[., .]], 5[4[., .], 6[., .]]],
 1[., 5[3[2[., .], 4[., .]], 6[., .]]],
 5[1[., 3[2[., .], 4[., .]]], 6[., .]],
 5[3[1[., 2[., .]], 4[., .]], 6[., .]],
 5[3[1[., 2[., .]], 4[., .]], 6[., .]],
 5[3[1[., 2[., .]], 4[., .]], 6[., .]],
 1[., 5[3[2[., .], 4[., .]], 6[., .]]],
 5[1[., 3[2[., .], 4[., .]]], 6[., .]],
 5[1[., 3[2[., .], 4[., .]]], 6[., .]],
 5[3[1[., 2[., .]], 4[., .]], 6[., .]],
 5[3[1[., 2[., .]], 4[., .]], 6[., .]]]
sage: [Permutation(reversed(a)).binary_search_tree() for a in b.sylvester_class()]
[2[1[., .], 4[3[., .], 6[5[., .], .]]],
 2[1[., .], 4[3[., .], 6[5[., .], .]]],
 2[1[., .], 4[3[., .], 6[5[., .], .]]],
 2[1[., .], 4[3[., .], 6[5[., .], .]]],
 2[1[., .], 4[3[., .], 6[5[., .], .]]],
 2[1[., .], 4[3[., .], 6[5[., .], .]]],
 2[1[., .], 4[3[., .], 6[5[., .], .]]],
 2[1[., .], 4[3[., .], 6[5[., .], .]]],
 2[1[., .], 4[3[., .], 6[5[., .], .]]],
 2[1[., .], 4[3[., .], 6[5[., .], .]]],
 2[1[., .], 4[3[., .], 6[5[., .], .]]],
 2[1[., .], 4[3[., .], 6[5[., .], .]]],
 2[1[., .], 4[3[., .], 6[5[., .], .]]],
 2[1[., .], 4[3[., .], 6[5[., .], .]]],
 2[1[., .], 4[3[., .], 6[5[., .], .]]]]
```

What do we do about it? (I'm really hoping this doesn't reflect a conflict in literature.)

EDIT: could it be that what you call a binary search tree of a permutation p is `p.binary_search_tree(left_to_right=False)`? That should be easy to document.

Nice code, which is fun to read and understand!

I haven't finished the review yet, but I will very soon. I will have to leave the following jobs to someone else (Frederic, Viviane?):

```

- OOP (such as the proper use of __init__ and __classcall_private__ etc.);

- reviewing my code.

Also... what is a pilo?

Basically done.

What remains:

```
- LaTeX method and options code (not sure how much of a review
  these need anyway);
- OOP (such as the proper use of __init__ and
  __classcall_private__ etc.);
- properly lazifying the imports (the obvious thing breaks
  doctests and I don't know what to do about it);
- specifying whether "maximal" in `maximal_chain_intervals`
  means "longest" or "inclusion-maximal", and checking that
  this is indeed satisfied (I wasn't able to prove this);
- reviewing my code.

Ok, so following the discussion with Darj and Travis. 

We proved the so called "longest chain algorithm" that I had implemented using a new statistic that we called "Tamari inversions". I put a short version of the proof in the doc itself (because I don't think there is any ref for this), we are working on this with Darj right now. If ever we write a paper with the proof in it, we will add the reference!

Also, I reviewed Darj's insertion method to check if it was working and it seemed fine.
