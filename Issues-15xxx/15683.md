Implementation of a combinatorial object called interval-poset which represent an interval of the Tamari lattice. In particular, it is linked to Dyck paths and binary trees. 

I have implemented all the basic methods. I still have other methods (composition, involution) but I leave them for some later ticket because this one is quite big.

Summary:

- adding the classes TamariIntervalPoset and TamariIntervalPosets with a lot of simple and useful combinatorics on it (iteration, size of the interval, maximal chain, ...)
- adding methods in Dyck paths and Binary trees to get Tamari intervals

I have made many small changes to put the code into the pep8 standard. And also corrected a few typos, and changed the name of `size` method into `cardinality`, with a better way to compute the formula.

Yes I agree it shouldn't be in the global name space. I'm trying to figure a solution where it can still be found quite easily. Posets don't seem to be the right place, it is not directly a poset object and is mostly not linked to the poset theory.

Where is that? I can't find it.

I have added a few ref and explanation. A Tamari interval is just a couple comparable elements in the Lattice, the way you represent elements (Trees, Dyck paths, whatever) does not matter.

> - The way you are using "vertex parent", it seems that "vertex ancestor" would be more appropriate. Is this standard notation?


What method are you referring to exactly? I understand a parent to be the unique direct ancestor of a node in a tree, in this sense, ancestor is not working (as it can be a level 2 or 3 ancestor).

> - "contained into" should be "contained in". (There is a line break between "contained" and "into" where this error occurs, in case you want to find/replace.)


Ok fixed.

> - `t \leq t2` should be `t \leq t_2` in LaTeX mode.


fixed
 
> - Is it necessary to define a method called `cardinality` which computes something different from the cardinality of the poset? I would call it something like `interval_cardinality` instead...


You're right, I changd it to `interval_cardinality` which is clearer.

Done

It would be great if you were reviewing it. I'm aware that it's quite some work, so do as you feel. Frederic already knows the object themselves as we have worked on them a bit. Your opinion would be very valuable as you're not familiar with the subject (especially on the doc). I'm the only one really who knows about these stuff and one of the purpose of this patch is to make it available, understandable and usable by everyone else. 

Anyway, I have pushed most of the changes you suggested. (I haven't changed the global import yet)

This was no stupid question. The poset was stored in ``self._poset`` but I have added a ``poset()`` method which makes it more visible.

The ``linear_extensions`` method return permutations which are linear extensions of the interval-poset. They form indeed an interval of the right weak order. There are also the two methos ``max_linear_extention`` and ``min_linear_extention`` which return both ends of the right weak order interval. Tell me if you think there should be more or better documented methods.

I'd prefer a precise reference to a docstring describing this bijection, or to a paper giving it. Could you do this? Thanks a lot.

<a id='comment:28'></a>Hi Darj,

I've checked your edits and yes you've got the description right! Thank you also for implementing the complement. I've added some docs and tests into it (to understand what it does in terms of the lattice itself).

Also, I've added two new methods to check if an interval is initial/final.

<a id='comment:29'></a>Sorry for the delays :/ I'm trying to get this done.

There is some reversal of permutations lurking somewhere in either the code or the theory:

```
sage: p = Permutation([2,4,1,6,5,3])
sage: t = p.binary_search_tree(); t
2[1[., .], 4[3[., .], 6[5[., .], .]]]
sage: i = t.tamari_interval(t); i
The tamari interval of size 6 induced by relations [(1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6), (6, 4), (5, 4), (4, 2), (3, 2)]
sage: lins = i.linear_extensions()
sage: list(lins)
[[5, 6, 3, 4, 1, 2],
 [5, 6, 3, 1, 4, 2],
 [5, 6, 1, 3, 4, 2],
 [5, 3, 6, 4, 1, 2],
 [5, 3, 6, 1, 4, 2],
 [5, 3, 1, 6, 4, 2],
 [5, 1, 6, 3, 4, 2],
 [5, 1, 3, 6, 4, 2],
 [3, 5, 6, 4, 1, 2],
 [3, 5, 6, 1, 4, 2],
 [3, 5, 1, 6, 4, 2],
 [3, 1, 5, 6, 4, 2],
 [1, 5, 6, 3, 4, 2],
 [1, 5, 3, 6, 4, 2],
 [1, 3, 5, 6, 4, 2]]
```

Actually, the problem seems to be in the trees code, and it's a bug because it contradicts the doc:

```
sage: p = Permutation([2,4,1,6,5,3])
sage: b = p.binary_search_tree()
sage: [Permutation(a).binary_search_tree() for a in b.sylvester_class()]
[1[., 3[2[., .], 5[4[., .], 6[., .]]]],
 3[1[., 2[., .]], 5[4[., .], 6[., .]]],
 3[1[., 2[., .]], 5[4[., .], 6[., .]]],
 3[1[., 2[., .]], 5[4[., .], 6[., .]]],
 3[1[., 2[., .]], 5[4[., .], 6[., .]]],
 1[., 5[3[2[., .], 4[., .]], 6[., .]]],
 5[1[., 3[2[., .], 4[., .]]], 6[., .]],
 5[3[1[., 2[., .]], 4[., .]], 6[., .]],
 5[3[1[., 2[., .]], 4[., .]], 6[., .]],
 5[3[1[., 2[., .]], 4[., .]], 6[., .]],
 1[., 5[3[2[., .], 4[., .]], 6[., .]]],
 5[1[., 3[2[., .], 4[., .]]], 6[., .]],
 5[1[., 3[2[., .], 4[., .]]], 6[., .]],
 5[3[1[., 2[., .]], 4[., .]], 6[., .]],
 5[3[1[., 2[., .]], 4[., .]], 6[., .]]]
sage: [Permutation(reversed(a)).binary_search_tree() for a in b.sylvester_class()]
[2[1[., .], 4[3[., .], 6[5[., .], .]]],
 2[1[., .], 4[3[., .], 6[5[., .], .]]],
 2[1[., .], 4[3[., .], 6[5[., .], .]]],
 2[1[., .], 4[3[., .], 6[5[., .], .]]],
 2[1[., .], 4[3[., .], 6[5[., .], .]]],
 2[1[., .], 4[3[., .], 6[5[., .], .]]],
 2[1[., .], 4[3[., .], 6[5[., .], .]]],
 2[1[., .], 4[3[., .], 6[5[., .], .]]],
 2[1[., .], 4[3[., .], 6[5[., .], .]]],
 2[1[., .], 4[3[., .], 6[5[., .], .]]],
 2[1[., .], 4[3[., .], 6[5[., .], .]]],
 2[1[., .], 4[3[., .], 6[5[., .], .]]],
 2[1[., .], 4[3[., .], 6[5[., .], .]]],
 2[1[., .], 4[3[., .], 6[5[., .], .]]],
 2[1[., .], 4[3[., .], 6[5[., .], .]]]]
```

What do we do about it? (I'm really hoping this doesn't reflect a conflict in literature.)

EDIT: could it be that what you call a binary search tree of a permutation p is `p.binary_search_tree(left_to_right=False)`? That should be easy to document.

<a id='comment:37'></a>Nice code, which is fun to read and understand!

I haven't finished the review yet, but I will very soon. I will have to leave the following jobs to someone else (Frederic, Viviane?):

```
- LaTeX method and options code (not sure how much of a review these need anyway);
- OOP (such as the proper use of __init__ and __classcall_private__ etc.);
- properly lazifying the imports (the obvious thing breaks doctests and I don't know what to do about it);
- reviewing my code.
```

Also... what is a pilo?

<a id='comment:72'></a>If you are using texlive:

```
tlmgr install titlesec
```
On !Redhat/Fedora

```
yum install texlive-titlesec
```
There is a number of other packages that are required, they can be installed analogously.
