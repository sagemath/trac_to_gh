Implementation of a combinatorial object called interval-poset which represent an interval of the Tamari lattice. In particular, it is linked to Dyck paths and binary trees. 

I have implemented all the basic methods. I still have other methods (composition, involution) but I leave them for some later ticket because this one is quite big.

Summary:

- adding the classes TamariIntervalPoset and TamariIntervalPosets with a lot of simple and useful combinatorics on it (iteration, size of the interval, maximal chain, ...)
- adding methods in Dyck paths and Binary trees to get Tamari intervals

I have made many small changes to put the code into the pep8 standard. And also corrected a few typos, and changed the name of `size` method into `cardinality`, with a better way to compute the formula.

Yes I agree it shouldn't be in the global name space. I'm trying to figure a solution where it can still be found quite easily. Posets don't seem to be the right place, it is not directly a poset object and is mostly not linked to the poset theory.

Where is that? I can't find it.

Ok fixed.

fixed

You're right, I changd it to `interval_cardinality` which is clearer.

Done

It would be great if you were reviewing it. I'm aware that it's quite some work, so do as you feel. Frederic already knows the object themselves as we have worked on them a bit. Your opinion would be very valuable as you're not familiar with the subject (especially on the doc). I'm the only one really who knows about these stuff and one of the purpose of this patch is to make it available, understandable and usable by everyone else. 

Anyway, I have pushed most of the changes you suggested. (I haven't changed the global import yet)

<a id='comment:16'></a>Only minor changes so far (I was busy fixing my own git errors most of the time...).

I think we should merge #14498 into this branch, shouldn't we? I'm referring to one of the methods from #14498 for its doc. (Namely, for the definition of the Tamari order on trees. By the way, does that definition play well with the one you are using?)

I have revamped your references as they were too short and conflicting with some existing ones ("Cha" is way too common for an identifier).

This is probably a stupid question a more careful look at the code would answer, but where do I find a method to turn a Tamari interval-poset into a poset? While you have redefined some poset-theoretical methods, there are still many more in the Poset class.

I've added an arXiv identifier to the Chapoton reference. If you are aware of the paper being more up-to-date than the arXiv preprint, please remove it again.

If I remember correctly, the Tamari lattice projects onto the Bruhat poset (one of the two, I never remember which); are there any methods for this?

Thank you

This was no stupid question. The poset was stored in ``self._poset`` but I have added a ``poset()`` method which makes it more visible.

The ``linear_extensions`` method return permutations which are linear extensions of the interval-poset. They form indeed an interval of the right weak order. There are also the two methos ``max_linear_extention`` and ``min_linear_extention`` which return both ends of the right weak order interval. Tell me if you think there should be more or better documented methods.

<a id='comment:23'></a>One little step made, including fixes for the issues noticed above.

Here:

```
    Interval-posets of size `n` are in bijection with intervals of
    the Tamari lattice of binary trees of size `n`.
```
I'd prefer a precise reference to a docstring describing this bijection, or to a paper giving it. Could you do this? Thanks a lot.

<a id='comment:29'></a>Sorry for the delays :/ I'm trying to get this done.

There is some reversal of permutations lurking somewhere in either the code or the theory:

```
sage: p = Permutation([2,4,1,6,5,3])
sage: t = p.binary_search_tree(); t
2[1[., .], 4[3[., .], 6[5[., .], .]]]
sage: i = t.tamari_interval(t); i
The tamari interval of size 6 induced by relations [(1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6), (6, 4), (5, 4), (4, 2), (3, 2)]
sage: lins = i.linear_extensions()
sage: list(lins)
[[5, 6, 3, 4, 1, 2],
 [5, 6, 3, 1, 4, 2],
 [5, 6, 1, 3, 4, 2],
 [5, 3, 6, 4, 1, 2],
 [5, 3, 6, 1, 4, 2],
 [5, 3, 1, 6, 4, 2],
 [5, 1, 6, 3, 4, 2],
 [5, 1, 3, 6, 4, 2],
 [3, 5, 6, 4, 1, 2],
 [3, 5, 6, 1, 4, 2],
 [3, 5, 1, 6, 4, 2],
 [3, 1, 5, 6, 4, 2],
 [1, 5, 6, 3, 4, 2],
 [1, 5, 3, 6, 4, 2],
 [1, 3, 5, 6, 4, 2]]
```

Actually, the problem seems to be in the trees code, and it's a bug because it contradicts the doc:

```
sage: p = Permutation([2,4,1,6,5,3])
sage: b = p.binary_search_tree()
sage: [Permutation(a).binary_search_tree() for a in b.sylvester_class()]

sage: [Permutation(reversed(a)).binary_search_tree() for a in b.sylvester_class()]
[2[1[., .], 4[3[., .], 6[5[., .], .]]],
 2[1[., .], 4[3[., .], 6[5[., .], .]]],
 2[1[., .], 4[3[., .], 6[5[., .], .]]],
 2[1[., .], 4[3[., .], 6[5[., .], .]]],
 2[1[., .], 4[3[., .], 6[5[., .], .]]],
 2[1[., .], 4[3[., .], 6[5[., .], .]]],

 2[1[., .], 4[3[., .], 6[5[., .], .]]],
 2[1[., .], 4[3[., .], 6[5[., .], .]]],
 2[1[., .], 4[3[., .], 6[5[., .], .]]],

 2[1[., .], 4[3[., .], 6[5[., .], .]]],
 2[1[., .], 4[3[., .], 6[5[., .], .]]]]
```

What do we do about it? (I'm really hoping this doesn't reflect a conflict in literature.)

EDIT: could it be that what you call a binary search tree of a permutation p is `p.binary_search_tree(left_to_right=False)`? That should be easy to document.

I haven't finished the review yet, but I will very soon. I will have to leave the following jobs to someone else (Frederic, Viviane?):

```
- LaTeX method and options code (not sure how much of a review these need anyway);
- OOP (such as the proper use of __init__ and __classcall_private__ etc.);
- properly lazifying the imports (the obvious thing breaks doctests and I don't know what to do about it);
- reviewing my code.
