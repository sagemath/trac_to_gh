Well in #15539 we decided to (at least for now) stick with the current naming convention where the subdirectories of build/pkgs are all lower-case. 

But regardless of that, we should use the tarball name from the `checksums.ini` file and not blindly try combinations of basename + extension. So even if we, in the future, decide to rename the directories under build/pkgs we should still merge this ticket.

Btw: why didn't the dev-script notice that Jereon changed the commit field just before I set the ticket to positive review?

It's reinventing part of the `sage-spkg` wheel, my solution instead directly uses `sage-spkg` to copy the files.
