Well in #15539 we decided to (at least for now) stick with the current naming convention where the subdirectories of build/pkgs are all lower-case. 

But regardless of that, we should use the tarball name from the `checksums.ini` file and not blindly try combinations of basename + extension. So even if we, in the future, decide to rename the directories under build/pkgs we should still merge this ticket.

I didn't see anything bad about Volker's solution. But I have to have a look at Jereon's changes.

Btw: why didn't the dev-script notice that Jereon changed the commit field just before I set the ticket to positive review?

It's reinventing part of the `sage-spkg` wheel, my solution instead directly uses `sage-spkg` to copy the files.

That absolutely makes sense. Unfortunately, I won't have time to look at this until the second week of January. So if Volker has a look at Jereon's changes, he can consider his part of the patch as positively reviewed. That's all I can do for the moment.
