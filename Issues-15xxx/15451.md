```
We have

```
sage: (4-x^2)/(3-sqrt(x^2+5)).limit(x=2)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ZeroDivisionError: Symbolic division by zero
```
but

```
sage: limit((4-x^2)/(3-sqrt(x^2+5)), x=2)
6
```
Those two should give the same result (at least the docstring of `x.limit` says `See "sage.calculus.calculus.limit"`, so it has the appearence that the same functions are called).
