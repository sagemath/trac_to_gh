See #14962.  We have to either fix the newest version checking in brian or (better) get rid of it completely.

This would be an ideal time to upgrade brian to a new version and use the patch file instead of the py file for the one fix that is in it.

<a id='comment:1'></a>Here's my current diff.  I won't have time to upgrade and test today, but hopefully tomorrow.  Note that 

```
$ diff -Naur src/brian/units.py patches/units.py
```
actually returns a lot of whitespace changes so this is better from that standpoint as well.

I may have to change the `p1` to something else or change the patch file slightly.
