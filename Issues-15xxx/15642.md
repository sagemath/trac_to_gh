This ticket rewrites the `sage-download-file` script in pure Python. It is, first of all, a drop-in replacement of the current script. But it is now also aware of our tarballs, so you can just write e.g.

```
sage-download-file sympy-0.7.4.tar.gz
```
and it will download that tarball from the fastest mirror and verify its checksum.

?  Before the breakage, setting `SAGE_SERVER` to e.g. `http://mirror.switch.ch/mirror/sagemath/` worked, for example with `sage --optional` and -- long time ago -- with `sage --upgrade`.

The worst decision was to hardcode package metadata (solely!) into specific Sage releases, while that data doesn't even show whether a package is optional, experimental, or whatever.  (It's pretty easy to *create* \"old-style\" packages from that though... ;-) )\n\nIn my opinion the main reason we should (still) support real spkgs is that anybody can easily create and offer such self-contained packages to others, and installing and using them doesn't artificially depend on the Sage version.

I'm all against that.  The worst decision was to hardcode package metadata (solely!) into specific Sage releases, while that data doesn't even show whether a package is optional, experimental, or whatever.  (It's pretty easy to *create* "old-style" packages from that though... ;-) )

In my opinion the main reason we should (still) support real spkgs is that anybody can easily create and offer such self-contained packages to others, and installing and using them doesn't artificially depend on the Sage version.  (Whether they'll work of course depends on a couple of things.)

They're also often much more convenient for testing.

Perhaps with the exception of left-over old-style standard packages, I don't see a problem.

Replying to [@haraldschilly](#comment%3A73):
> Since I'm CCed: There is currently a move of the whole infrastructure going on. Before that I tried to keep everything compatible with the original system from a long time ago. That's no longer possible. Long story short: the website and the binary-files need to be untangled and that means there are no longer chains of symlink-aliases. Hence, don't use the `/mirror` subdirectory of the website and I hope the essence of this ticket is to get rid of this old dependence. The only mirror related aspect is the `mirror_list` file for the base URLs.

Well, the Sage scripts never used the `mirror/` folder.  The problematic part here is the structure below the base URL; `spkg/` was changed to `packages` on sagemath.org, but the mirrors all have the classical structure (plus `upstream/` below `spkg/`).

The new thing on this ticket is also that we now use [http://www.sagemath.org/mirror_list](http://www.sagemath.org/mirror_list) (currently hardcoded) again, which is periodically generated by a script on the server (or at least used to be).

Harald, also note Jeroen's comment I quoted [above](#comment%3A72).

Meanwhile, it's not just standard packages, but also optional packages, of which (only) some now have the "new style", i.e., the data of newer ones is hardcoded into the Sage releases, while obsolete "old-style" packages remain in `spkg/optional/list` (and `spkg/optional/`).

`./sage --optional` shows some examples of optional packages which became standard:

```
Optional packages:

...
git-1.7.12.2.p0 ........................ installed version: 2.3.0
...
pyzmq-2.1.11.p1 ........................ installed version: 14.3.0
...
zeromq-3.2.0.p0 ........................ installed version: 4.0.5
```

There are other still optional packages where `sage -i ...` would install newer versions than listed by `sage --optional` because the "local metadata" (`$SAGE_ROOT/build/pkgs/<package>/package-version.txt`) differs from what `spkg/optional/list` gives.  (Same issue as with our current standard packages.)

A more funny one is TOPCOM:

`./sage -i TOPCOM` installs the "legacy" spkg, while `./sage -i topcom` installs the "new-style" spkg.  (The package versions are currently still the same though, modulo a `.p0` for the "new-style" one.)

**Note for other reviewers:**  So far I'm ok with the changes/corrections made, but haven't yet tested thoroughly enough (I think).

While I don't like completely changing the previously *generic* character of `sage-download-file` (nor removing the "shell fallback" with e.g. `wget` or `curl` if Python isn't available or functional), I strongly doubt we could convince the author or the RM to change that back to how it was.

FTP support (probably with Python3) and e.g. usage of a static mirror list (perhaps to be shipped with Sage) is something for follow-up tickets; the broken behaviour of `sage-list-packages` is (or will be) dealt with at #16759, which depends on *this* ticket.




W.r.t. the threat of losing sagemath.org for downloads:  [According to William](http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.mathematics.sage.devel/79645), *"soon" is not **that** soon*.

Uhm, to reduce that confusion a little bit: The source of this inconsistency is that right now most of the old infrastructure is still running, including the currently "old" website. I would suggest to wait until the "new" website is operational. Then, any bugs in scripts relying on the website will be obvious (and fixes to the new website visible immediately).

The reason why this is a bit slow is, because there are many links assuming certain subdirectories (for documentation and e.g. /mirror/) and my time is limited. I could report back once the DNS entry has switched to the new page.

PS: "new" just means, that there are minor changes like an additional mirror, publications etc. The current "old" website is an older fork of the website with some other patches. Hence this diverged and there is no need to support the old one any more.
