This ticket rewrites the `sage-download-file` script in pure Python. It is, first of all, a drop-in replacement of the current script. But it is now also aware of our tarballs, so you can just write e.g.

```
sage-download-file sympy-0.7.4.tar.gz
```
and it will download that tarball from the fastest mirror and verify its checksum.

Per the discussion on sage-devel, Python is a requirement. Sooner or later Sage won't build without Python with or without this ticket.

Sure, but why break building on systems without Python on this ticket? It is absolutely trivial to keep supporting without Python for now (just keep the shell part of the script). It seems you're breaking stuff for no reason.

I don't recall that discussion...

Let me repeat what I said above:

Why break building on systems without Python on this ticket? It is absolutely trivial to keep support for building without Python for now (just keep the shell part of the script). It seems you're breaking stuff for no reason. I don't mind breaking building without Python if there is a good reason, but not breaking just for the sake of it.

The downloading script still needs to be called from sage-spkg, when that is finished we must merge this ticket asap.

Should we fix this here, since we now touch `sage-list-packages` anyway?

Harald, also note Jeroen's comment I quoted [above](#comment%3A72).

Meanwhile, it's not just standard packages, but also optional packages, of which (only) some now have the "new style", i.e., the data of newer ones is hardcoded into the Sage releases, while obsolete "old-style" packages remain in `spkg/optional/list` (and `spkg/optional/`).

`./sage --optional` shows some examples of optional packages which became standard:

```
Optional packages:

...
git-1.7.12.2.p0 ........................ installed version: 2.3.0
...
pyzmq-2.1.11.p1 ........................ installed version: 14.3.0
...
zeromq-3.2.0.p0 ........................ installed version: 4.0.5
```

There are other still optional packages where `sage -i ...` would install newer versions than listed by `sage --optional` because the "local metadata" (`$SAGE_ROOT/build/pkgs/<package>/package-version.txt`) differs from what `spkg/optional/list` gives.  (Same issue as with our current standard packages.)

A more funny one is TOPCOM:

`./sage -i TOPCOM` installs the "legacy" spkg, while `./sage -i topcom` installs the "new-style" spkg.  (The package versions are currently still the same though, modulo a `.p0` for the "new-style" one.)

**Note for other reviewers:**  So far I'm ok with the changes/corrections made, but haven't yet tested thoroughly enough (I think).

While I don't like completely changing the previously *generic* character of `sage-download-file` (nor removing the "shell fallback" with e.g. `wget` or `curl` if Python isn't available or functional), I strongly doubt we could convince the author or the RM to change that back to how it was.

FTP support (probably with Python3) and e.g. usage of a static mirror list (perhaps to be shipped with Sage) is something for follow-up tickets; the broken behaviour of `sage-list-packages` is (or will be) dealt with at #16759, which depends on *this* ticket.




W.r.t. the threat of losing sagemath.org for downloads:  [According to William](http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.mathematics.sage.devel/79645), *"soon" is not **that** soon*.

Uhm, to reduce that confusion a little bit: The source of this inconsistency is that right now most of the old infrastructure is still running, including the currently "old" website. I would suggest to wait until the "new" website is operational. Then, any bugs in scripts relying on the website will be obvious (and fixes to the new website visible immediately).

The reason why this is a bit slow is, because there are many links assuming certain subdirectories (for documentation and e.g. /mirror/) and my time is limited. I could report back once the DNS entry has switched to the new page.

PS: "new" just means, that there are minor changes like an additional mirror, publications etc. The current "old" website is an older fork of the website with some other patches. Hence this diverged and there is no need to support the old one any more.

Could we already test the new one (using its unofficial address) w.r.t. download stuff / package (and mirror) lists?

Provided the mirrors can still sync...




In principle we could already include a snapshot of `mirror_list` into the git tree (in `$SAGE_ROOT/`?  in more human-readable form?).  The dynamic one should rather be located in `$SAGE_ROOT/local/var/{lib,tmp}/sage/`, say, not `$SAGE_DIST_FILES/` (defaults to `$SAGE_ROOT/upstream/`).
