This is a sequel to #15174. The purpose of this ticket is to get rid of all uses of the `PermutationOptions['mult']` global variable which determines how the product of two permutations is defined. Getting rid of the variable itself (#14885) will be tougher.

Specifically, my branch does the following:

- All methods related to the seminormal form in `sage/combinat/symmetric_group_algebra.py` now no longer rely on `PermutationOptions['mult']`. Instead, the ones among them that used to have their result depend on `'mult'` now take an optional keyword `'mult'` (defaulting to `l2r`, not to the global setting -- not sure if this is good?).

- The exposed seminormal-form methods now are documented. The documentation might look weird and might also be wrong at times, since my acquaintance with the seminormal form is half a day old (sorry, Andrew, for procrastinating on this!!) and since the methods were obviously written with British multiplication in mind (`pq` = first `p` then `q`) whereas I'm using continental multiplication (`pq` = first `q` then `p`). I hope someone experienced can review this, because adding wrong documentation isn't actually an improvement...

- Descent algebra documentation has been corrected at a few points. The errors were my own and were due to me not knowing that Sage uses British multiplication. (Ceterum censeo, the continental convention is still the right one.)

- A few minor speedups and doc improvements on the permutation code.

Thanks a lot for the review! Looks like we're mostly done with the permutation order then.

`@`darij Sorry, I haven't looked at this (or your query on MO), and I doubt that I will have time to do this any time soon. 

I just tried reading quickly through the latest patch but I didn't see anything related to how the `mult` variable interacts with the seminormal form. All I noticed was the unusual choice of reference:) My guess is that if I looked at this code properly then I'd probably want to rewrite it from scratch as I seem to remember that the seminormal form code in sage is far more computationally intensive than it needs to be (working with the seminormal form is very different from working with the primitive idempotents whereas last time I looked at this code it confused these two problems). 

If everyone else is happy with the changes then I suggest you just give it a positive review rather than waiting for me to have time to look at it properly.

Hi Darij,

To work with the seminormal form you don't need to compute the idempotents at all. Rather you just need a basis `{ v_t }` together with an implementation of the action

```
s_r v_t = 1/\rho_r(t)v_t + (1+\rho_r(t))/\rho_r(t) v_{s_r t},
```
where `\pho_r(t)=c_{r+1}(t)-c_r(t)` is the axial distance from `r` to `r+1` inside the tableau `t`. Here I use the convention that `v_{s_r t}=0` if `s_rt` is not standard.

Of course, there are many other equivalent ways to write down the seminormal form, but this is my favourite version because it is very symmetric and it is defined over the rationals.

The action of the idempotents on this basis of the semisimple Specht is easy: 

```
F_s v_t=\delta_[st} v_t}}}
This follows because `L_r v_t = c_r(t)v_t`, for all `r`. 

It is only when you need to work with the idempotents `F_t`, given explicitly as elements of the group algebra, that you ever need to use these formulas.

Andrew

Hey Darij,

Your changes LGTM.

We'd want it's own class so it can be a proper parent. Thus we could do coercions and multiplications with that basis. Think like how Sym works, but perhaps we wouldn't use the multiple realizations framework since there is a natural basis (IMO, but I'm not anywhere close an expert in this field).

Perhaps we should open up a follow-up ticket which does that, and follow Andrew's favorite construction?

To both, do you think there is any more work to be done here?

Thank you a lot, Travis!

I guess there are now two things to do:

- a parent for the seminormal basis of QSn, and

- an implementation of the seminormal basis of a single QSn-module.

We might want to open two separate tickets... (Tom Denton should be cc'ed on the second.)
