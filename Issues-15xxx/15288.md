End of a loong queue of patches, here it is ! The constructions for BIBD with k=4 as found in Douglas Stinson's book "Combinatorial Designs: Constructions and Analysis", which uses the constructions given in #15286 (Latin Squares) and #15287 (Orthogonal Arrays).

This patch creates a file named bibd.py in `combinat/design/` for the BIBD we already know how to build and the future ones (I will make sure of that `:-P`)

Depends on #15287

Done. But honestly you are just enforcing your own subjective point of view there, and I do not like what I am doing.

It is very nice if for you a BIBD is a Incidence Structure, but for me this thing is a collection of set. That's all. I could also return a complete graph along with a collection of subgraphs to show that a BIBD is a decomposition of a complete graph into smaller ones, and this does not make any sense at all. For me a BIBD is a collection of sets, and if you want some specific additional structure on top of it you are quite free to set it yourself.

Besides this `IncidenceStructure` class spends its lifetime sorting stuff I never asked to sort, and copying stuff around for no reason. That's for the loss of computational time resulting for enforcing a subjective point of view.

In the end, I just end up calling `.blocks()` every time I build a BIBD, and I don't see why I should pay cycles to `IncidenceStructure` in exchange for that.

I am enforcing consistency, as I indicated quite clearly, I hope.
The thing I complained about is akin to `graphs.blah()` returning a list of edges instead of a `Graph`.

You are enforcing consistency because consistency is a way to enforce what you like. If I tell you that `designs.steiner_quadruple_systems` returns tuples then you will tell me (as before) that "It's not because I did something wrong once that I should be allowed to do it again".

Dear, dear consistency `:-P`

Yep. Exactly like here, and for the same reason.

> well, this just means that `IncidenceStructure` class is in need of an improvement; perhaps it should get several backends just as `Graph` has.

Changes nothing. All backends have a cost, all of them mean duplicating stuff uselessly, and none of them is as "simple and understandable" as a list. If you want a data structure to do something specific, pick the data structure that you like. I don't think we should pick a specific data structure over another one, and so I prefer to return the most basic types. The types that the functions actually work with.

Do you understand the meaning of the word `consistency`? Just wondering...

I don't have time to control all the code you produce for consistency, sorry. But, indeed, I am of opinion that `designs.*` must all return the stuff from the same class. And I am sure the majority on sage-devel would support me on this, if you think that I am not sufficient authority for you.

But `graphs.*` do not do this, and `designs.*` do. Some have to give, and it's certainly `designs.*`.

If you want a data structure to do something specific, pick the data structure that you like. I don't think we should pick a specific data structure over another one, and so I prefer to return the most basic types. The types that the functions actually work with. No copy, easy-to-understand data.

No, this design (more precisely, absence of one) is crap, it throws away the fact that list in question is a list of blocks of BIBD.
It's perfectly OK to have it in your private code, but not in a library code.

E.g. the fact that it is not an immutable list is inviting errors.
Another thing, one might wonder what the parameters of the design are. 
Surely one can have a function to compute them, but it can also be implemented by storing the parameters upon the creation.
Same for automorphism groups.

I did not check who wrote `IncidenceStructure` structure class. Does it matter? It could have been you...

Do you see that your way of looking at things will add useless copies everywhere ? Copies, and sorting, and equality tests, all for no new feature, but only for "good code administration" ? Do you see the cost of this, and the total lack of gain in the process ?

The code will be slower. For nothing. What's so good in "consistency" that we have to pay all this ?

Not when one creates the design by giving it the parameters. But they can recompute them afterwards, I fixed the function recently.

You are all crazy with your caches everywhere, immutable structures and so. You waste computations. Consider the developers as responsible beings, and you will stop having to copy/cache stuff when nobody asks you as if you wanted to protect them from themselves. They know what they are doing.

a user can go through `designs.*` and call functions, like 

You can change the sets of a block design without changing the name. Actually, with  your strandards the design of `BlockDesign` is pretty bad, for `.blocks()` does not return a copy of the blocks but the  blocks themselves, so I wondered at some point if it was safe  to  do that.

`ProjectivePlaneDesign()` is written by you, isn't it? And it does return `IncidenceStructure`. Needless to say, `ProjectivePlaneDesign()` is a BIBD. You simply do not have a good argument to justify why in different cases you return different classes.

`O_O`

Hey, let's make them all return lists of Sets if you don't mind ! `:-D`

This function returns `IncidenceStructure` because I copy/pasted from projective geometry design, but really I  could not care less about Incidence Structure. I just  never  used  those functions in any way. I just want the sets `:-P`

I've modified the description of the ticket to point to the "right" branch and commit. Hope I didn't screw this too badly...

Just `git push trac HEAD:public/15288` should have done it. But this is fine, too.

I don't see how this could work - unless I don't create my own branch. 
I did as described in `Git the hard way`:

```
git fetch trac public/15288
get checkout -b typofix15288 FETCH_HEAD
... editing the file...
git commit -a
git push --set-upstream trac HEAD:public/typofix15288` 
```
And trac server was not impressed :-)

I thought that the reason for this is some kind of lack of permissions to commit to a branch that is not my own... Anyhow, it's not clear from the description in the docs. Especially it's unclear under what conditions the manual changing of the branch and commit fields are not needed.

Everybody can write to branches named `public/...`

Trac can't possibly know that `public/typofix15288` is supposed to be on this ticket, which is why you had to manually update the ticket.
