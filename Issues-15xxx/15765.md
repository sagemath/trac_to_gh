The PARI package in Sage contains two databases (`galdata` and `seadata-small`). These should be separated and the packaging simplified.

**Upstream** (all these are simply repacked/renamed upstream tarballs):
- [http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/spkg/pari-2.5.5b.tar.bz2](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/spkg/pari-2.5.5b.tar.bz2)

- [http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/spkg/pari_seadata_small-20090618.tar.bz2](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/spkg/pari_seadata_small-20090618.tar.bz2)

But less so, since the probability of merge conflicts (I just resolved one) increases the longer that this branch does not get merged. And other people who want to work on PARI might not know about this ticket.
