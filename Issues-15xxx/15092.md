The GSL distributions do not appear to be plugged into Sage's overall random number generation schemes.    To wit,

```
sage: import sage.gsl.probability_distribution as pd
sage: dist = pd.RealDistribution("beta",[1.6,4.3])
sage: set_random_seed(666)
sage: dist.get_random_element()
0.113044138917
sage: set_random_seed(666)
sage: dist.get_random_element()
0.588362633297
```

It would be a big help for doctesting, if the Sage seed was utilized.  For example, see changes necessary on #15090.

Interfaces in `misc/randstate.pyx` could be a place to start.  There is some good background available at:  http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/misc/sage/misc/randstate.html
