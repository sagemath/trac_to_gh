```
The following substitution does not work:

```
sage: function('f', latex_name = 'blub')
f
sage: eq = solve((ln(f(x))==x).diff(x), f(x))[0]
sage: eq
f(x) == D[0](f)(x)
sage: eq.subs(f(x) == 42)
f(x) == D[0](f)(x)
```
Note that

```
sage: bool(eq.lhs() == f(x))
True
sage: id(eq.lhs()), id(f(x))
(119698064, 119698064)
```

When removing `latex_name`, everything works fine:

```
sage: function('f')
f
sage: eq = solve((ln(f(x))==x).diff(x), f(x))[0]
sage: eq.subs(f(x) == 42)
42 == D[0](f)(x)
```

**Keywords:** substitute, function, solve, latex_name
