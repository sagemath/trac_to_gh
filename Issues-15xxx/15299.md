This seems to be due to inappropriate use of Python floats instead of more precise real numbers. After the patch:

While working on this, we found an upstream PARI bug: the precision for `exponential_integal_1()` was not as good as it could be.

The root number is the sign of the functional equation so is +1 for even analytic rank and -1 for odd.  This function computes the first derivative.  *In practice* this is something one would only want to do if the 0'th derivative was already known to be 0, in which case the code you quote would be OK since if the value is 0 and the order is even then the order is at least 2 so the first derivative is exactly 0.  But of course this function then lies in wait for the user who decides they want the first derivative's value even when the value is nonzero (as for 11a1).  The trouble is that (1) Formulas for the r'th derivative which are implemented are *only* valid under the assumption that all previous derivatives are 0;  and of course (2) proving the earlier derivatives are exactly 0 is usually impossible with current theory.

Where does that leave this deriv_at1 function?  At the very least it should come with a huge warning about all this.  And it really should return 0 when the root number is +1 unless the user has made an explicit assumption (assume_order_of_vanishing_is_positive=True, say) and otherwise raise a NotImplemented error (or attempt to prove that L(1)=0).

Corrected the error computation for `at1()`. I believe this is rigorous now:

```
        for n in xrange(1,k+1):
            term = (zpow * an[n])/n
            zpow *= z
            L += term
            # 8n+1 is the relative error in half-ulps to compute term.
            # For addition, multiplication, division, sqrt, this is
            # bounded by the number of operations. exp(x) multiplies the
            # relative error by abs(x) and adds 1 half-ulp. The relative
            # error for -2*pi/sqrtN is 3 half-ulps. Assuming that
            # 2*pi/sqrtN <= 2, the relative error for z is 7 half-ulps.
            # This implies a relative error of 8n-1 half-ulps for zpow.
            # Adding 2 for the computation of term gives:

I agree, it was more an observation that we could in principle use `L1_vanishes()` here than a proposal to actually do it.

There is a formula for the *r*-th derivative which is valid when all lower derivatives vanish.  As far as I know, only for the 0-th derivative is there a known way to prove that it vanishes by a numerical computation.  For parity reasons (the root number), this means that if the order of vanishing is 0, 1 or 2, then we can prove this.  If the order of vanishing is 3, then in general we don't know how to prove that it is not 1.

This means that if and when the formula mentioned above is implemented, we won't be able to verify the condition "all lower derivatives are 0" when *r* is at least 3.  Hence we should probably not insist on verifying it when *r* = 1.
