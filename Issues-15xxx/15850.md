Previously, when inserting a transition which is already present, this
was simply ignored. By providing a hook `on_duplicate_transition`, user
defined behaviour is now possible. As examples, three functions are
provided (the default ignore, maintaining the previous behaviour;
raise error or add input label). The latter may be used to model a
Markov chain where the input labels are interpreted als transition
probabilities.

<a id='comment:3'></a>In [#15078, comment 19](http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/15078#comment:19), slabbe recommended having distinct classes `FiniteStateMachine`, `Transducer`, `Automaton`.

Therefore, I think it to be appropriate to briefly explain why I used a hook in this instance instead of having a new class `MarkovChain`:

- first, I think that it gives us more flexibility to customize the behaviour slightly
- second, having a class `MarkovChain` would probably require us to check whether the sum of the input weights of the transitions leaving a state adds up to 1. This would be quite cumbersome and inefficient. This checking is dealt with in #15961 (depending on this ticket).

Sorry, I do not really understand your comment. What should be collected in `duplicate_transaction.raise_error`?
