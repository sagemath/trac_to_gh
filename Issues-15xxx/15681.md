Travis noticed in #15669 that immutable graphs were nameless. That's terrible.

```
sage: graphs.PetersenGraph()                      
Petersen graph: Graph on 10 vertices
sage: Graph(graphs.PetersenGraph(),immutable=True)
Graph on 10 vertices
```

This patch fixes it. So doing, we now store the `name` attribute in the Python graph itself and not in the backend, where it does not really belong. This thing is for storing the graph data, not fancy attributes !

New behaviour :

```
sage: graphs.PetersenGraph()
Petersen graph: Graph on 10 vertices
sage: Graph(graphs.PetersenGraph(),immutable=True)
Petersen graph: Graph on 10 vertices
```

This patch is based upon #15623, because God made it that we will have to pay the Poset's `._immutable` hack until #15623 is merged `:-P`
