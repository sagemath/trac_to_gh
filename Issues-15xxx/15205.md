As reported by Thierry Monteil :

```
sage: graphs.PetersenGraph().dominating_set(solver="Coin",verbose=2)
ImportError: /home/ncohen/.Sage/local/lib/libCoinUtils.so.3: undefined symbol: dgetrf_
```

Looks like `dgetrf` is defined in LAPACK. I added it to the dependencies and it now works. No idea why it changed, and in particular I'll be quite happy to see all optional packages automatically tested at each release `:-P`

This solves the problem. I like the removal of one line in `generic_backend.pyx` so that this file is rebuilt, hence taking the modification into account ;) Thanks for maintaining this package and +1 for having optional packages automatically tested as the other parts of Sage.
