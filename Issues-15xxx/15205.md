Here are the issues that haven't been deal with in #15164:

* I don't understand why the internal product is implemented in `ncsf_qsym/generic_basis_code.py` rather than `ncsf_qsym/ncsf.py`. Isn't `generic_basis_code.py` for methods shared between QSym and NSym? There is no internal product on QSym.

[*Update:* This is not a real issue. The code isn't in the wrong class, it's just in a slightly unexpected module.]

* This here is a doctest which has been around before me:

```
                sage: N = NonCommutativeSymmetricFunctions(QQ)
                sage: S = N.complete()
                sage: S.internal_product
                Generic endomorphism of Non-Commutative Symmetric Functions over the Rational Field in the Complete basis
```
The output makes no sense: The internal product is not an endomorphism of anything. I understand it is implemented in some weirdly curried form, but then its target should be a Hom space.

[*Update:* From a conversation with Travis, this is wrong, but probably not worth fixing at the current stage.]

* I was trying to overshadow the `verschiebung` function I implemented on a generic NSym basis by a specific implementation on the ribbon basis. So I've added it under `class ElementMethods:` in the `class Ribbon`. But it doesn't get precedence over the generic implementation at runtime! What am I doing wrong?

[*Update:* It should be `class Element(CombinatorialFreeModule.Element):` rather than `class ElementMethods:`. At least verschiebung works now. I'll post that patch soon; right now an unrelated bug has to be fixed first.]

Hey Darij,

So then what do you want to do on this ticket, fix the internal product? I believe you took care of the Verschiebung on #15476, correct?

Best,

Travis

Hi Travis!

I don't really plan to do anything on the ticket, and I don't think there is anything to be done on it either. I was keeping it around as a mental note to myself to make an NSym II patch once #15476 is merged and the coercion bugs are dead; by now it seems less and less likely to see the latter happen anytime soon, though. I can just as well use my mailbox for that, though.

Greets and happy new year,\\
Darij
