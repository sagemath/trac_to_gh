Errors in the documentation should cause the `doc` makefile targets to fail, but they do not.

Ideally we would check in "make doc", but incremental builds often lead to sphinx failures. To reliably check for errors we must delete the previous output. So if you do that in "make doc" then there is no makefile target for incremental builds.

I hope you're not proposing that `make [p]test[long]` would delete all doc output and rebuild all docs from scratch. That would add a significant amount of time to doctesting.

```
Incremental documentation builds sometimes cause spurious 
error messages. To be certain that these are real errors, 
run "make doc-clean" first if you had not done so already.

Next, we should also make "sage -t FILE" build the docs for that file ;)

looks good to me!

The `--warn-links` mode (Sphinx's `nitpicky` mode) could be customized by monkey patching `_warn_missing_reference`. But that is only really useful unless somebody also would clean up broken links in the docs. So that is for another ticket, if anybody volunteers ;-)
