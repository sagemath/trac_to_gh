Speaking of which: I would vote for including the tikz-graph and tikz-berge style file in the Sage distribution, in particular so that latex runs from Sage would find them. Each time I tried to install them myself, it was a pain (including finding them) ...

They are very small, and this would improve quite some the user experience.

What do you think?
