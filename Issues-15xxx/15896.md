Here is the problem:

```
sage: x,y=polygen(QQ,'x,y')
sage: x.integral(x)
1/2*x^2
sage: x.integral(x).parent()
Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y over Rational Field
sage: x.integral(x)+y
BOOM
```

Euh, well, bon, ok.

I have changed my own bad code (which was mixing different sorts of multivariate polynomials) to something with more cython, which is staying in the singular multivariate polynomials.
