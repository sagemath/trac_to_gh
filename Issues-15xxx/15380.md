This is just something I wrote while learning how to use triangular module morphisms. Nothing really changed apart from some asserts replaced by ValueErrors (far from systematically...) and some unneeded declarations and imports removed; however, the doc is IMHO more readable now and the doctests cover some less-obvious cases.
