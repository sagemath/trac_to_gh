sage: R.<y> = ZZ[]
sage: y.diff()
Traceback (click to the left of this block for traceback)
...
AttributeError:
'sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_integer_dense_flint.Polynomial_integer\
_dense_flint' object has no attribute 'diff'
```
does not work. Neither does `y.differentiate()`. You can only do the desired operation with

```
sage: y.derivative()
1
```

In the symbolic ring all of the above is allowed:

```
sage: var('z')
z
sage: z.diff()
1
sage: z.differentiate()
1
sage: z.derivative()
1
```

For consistency aliases `.diff()` and `.differentiate()` should be added to all polynomial rings.
