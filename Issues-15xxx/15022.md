This function creates the adjacency graph associated to a triangulation of a point configuration.  Such a graph has one node for each top-dimensional simplex in the triangulation.  Two nodes are joined by an edge if the corresponding simplices intersect in a simplex of codimension 1.

Looks like your function could be replaced with 

```
def adjacency_graph(self):
    vertices = map(Set,list(self))
    return Graph((vertices,
                  lambda x,y: len(x-y)==1))
```

You also need to add a space after "sage: " in your example, and you should ensure that your new method passes doctests before uploading the patch. Here's how you try that :

```
sage -b && sage -t element.py
```

To build and check the html documentation, you can do

```
sage -b && sage -docbuild reference/geometry html
```

Have fun ! `:-)`

Helloooooo !!

I had forgotten to tell you about the 80 characters maximum length for lines (it's not a veeeeeeeeeery hard rule but we try to stick to it whenever possible), so I wrote a small reviewer's patch to apply on top of yours. If you agree with it, you can then set this ticket to `positive_review` !

I also remove spaces at the end of some lines (we try to avoid that too), and added a pointer toward another graph that one may want to obtain from a triangulation, in the method's documentation.

Oh, and I also changed the indentation of your AUTHORS block, as it was not displayed correctly in the html doc.

I think that it is ready to go now `:-)`

Have fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuunnn !!

Nathann
