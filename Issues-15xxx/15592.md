This is a heavily refactored version of the code Tom and I used in studying birational rowmotion and showed around in Bures-sur-Yvette. It is missing some of the hacky research-related methods but the main features are there.

Hey Darij,

I've fixed up the doc and changed the arg `alphabet` to `prefix` in `birational_free_labelling()`. I tried to implement `birational_toggles()` and `birational_rowmotion()` using a `reduce`, but this didn't net any speedup. Somewhat surprisingly to me, this actually slowed it down slightly, even with avoiding the extra `lambda` calls by swapping the order of the arguments in `birational_toggle()`.

Anyways, if you're happy with my changes, then it's a positive review.

Best,

Travis

Are you fine with the last fixes I just made? (I added a reference to an abstract which was just put online today and which, weirdly, has some content the main paper does not.)

Thanks for the catch. Am I right to assume that this

```
            existing elements of `P` and `1`. Now, a `\mathbf{K}`*-labelling
            of* `P` will mean any function from `\widehat{P}` to `\mathbf{K}`.
```
should be this:

```
            existing elements of `P` and `1`. Now, a *`\mathbf{K}`-labelling
            of* `P` will mean any function from `\widehat{P}` to `\mathbf{K}`.

Sorry, the bug was on a different line. Apparently Sphinx doesn't like italics beginning or ending in the middle of a word, and I had `*pro*motion`.

I guess it's positive_review due to the insignificance of the edits.
