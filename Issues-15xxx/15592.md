This is a heavily refactored version of the code Tom and I used in studying birational rowmotion and showed around in Bures-sur-Yvette. It is missing some of the hacky research-related methods but the main features are there.

Hey Darij,

I've fixed up the doc and changed the arg `alphabet` to `prefix` in `birational_free_labelling()`. I tried to implement `birational_toggles()` and `birational_rowmotion()` using a `reduce`, but this didn't net any speedup. Somewhat surprisingly to me, this actually slowed it down slightly, even with avoiding the extra `lambda` calls by swapping the order of the arguments in `birational_toggle()`.

Anyways, if you're happy with my changes, then it's a positive review.

Best,

Travis
