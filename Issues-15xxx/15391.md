Hi Maria, The code looks good. A couple of the doc tests failed, though. After you edit the permutation.py file, you can run the doc tests by typing from the command line:
sage -bt permutation.py

(the -b builds sage and the -t runs the doc tests in the file you specify)

Hi Maria,

I was just looking at it now too. Yes, you should switch to your local branch and pull the changes from the trac server. I believe the commands are:

git fetch origin

pull --ff-only

After you pull, you can look at the new code, but if you want to test the features in Sage, you need to build sage:

sage -bt permutation.py

But for me, it's taking a long time to build, probably because it's upgrading to a new beta version. (Is this to be expected, Travis?)

Anyway, once you're happy with it, you can set it to positive review.

I got annoyed by this and merged the latest beta version into all my branches.
