Hi Maria, The code looks good. A couple of the doc tests failed, though. After you edit the permutation.py file, you can run the doc tests by typing from the command line:
sage -bt permutation.py

(the -b builds sage and the -t runs the doc tests in the file you specify)

This rebuilds sage with your code inserted and runs the doc tests. I fixed the syntax on your doc tests so that they work and pushed the changes to trac. You can see the diff by clicking on (commits) in the branch field above. Or you can pull the changes to your local machine to test them out. If you are happy with my changes, you may set the ticket to positive review.

Hi Maria,

nice work. If you're fine with my changes, set this to positive_review. Unfortunately, a (trivial, I hope) conflict resolution might become necessary once my #15174 is merged into Sage.

I've updated it to the latest `5.13.beta3`, simplified the logic and made some additional tweaks. I'm happy with it, so it's up to someone else to check my changes and set a positive review.

Hi all,

Sorry, I'm new to this.  How do I see the changed file all in one place?  Do I pull something from the repository?  I just want to check it over before setting it to positive review.  Thanks for all your tweaks!

Hi Maria,

I was just looking at it now too. Yes, you should switch to your local branch and pull the changes from the trac server. I believe the commands are:

git fetch origin

pull --ff-only

After you pull, you can look at the new code, but if you want to test the features in Sage, you need to build sage:

sage -bt permutation.py

But for me, it's taking a long time to build, probably because it's upgrading to a new beta version. (Is this to be expected, Travis?)

Anyway, once you're happy with it, you can set it to positive review.
