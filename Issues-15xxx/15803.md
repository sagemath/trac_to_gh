This ticket is a split of #8558 to simplify reviewing and partial merging.

Currently, gcd of polynomials over absolute number fields uses euclidean algorithm. This patch changes that and makes the gcd using internal pari routines. This is not optimal for high degree number fields. See #8558 for an improvement.

Keywords: gcd, number field, univariate polynomial, pari
