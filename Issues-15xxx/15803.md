This ticket is a split of #8558 to simplify reviewing and partial merging.

Currently, gcd of polynomials over absolute number fields uses euclidean algorithm. This patch changes that and makes the gcd using internal pari routines. This is not optimal for high degree number fields. See #8558 for an improvement.

Keywords: **gcd, number field, univariate polynomial, pari**

Looks good to me and gives a measurable (though not dramatic) speedup in the few unscientific tests that I've done.

The reviewer patch makes one simplification in the case where one of the degrees is 0: if I'm not mistaken, we may assume that `self.parent() is other.parent()` thanks to `@coerce_binop`.  Other than that, just some formatting fixes, typos etc.  If you agree with my changes, it's a positive review.
