`knapsack` can be passed a list of arbitrary tuples (not just pairs), as in

```
sage: knapsack( [(1,2,'spam'), (1.5,1,'a'), (0.5,3,'lot')], max=2)
[5.0, [(1, 2, 'spam'), (0.500000000000000, 3, 'lot')]]
```

This is useful if one wants to attach data to a knapsack problem, however it
is undocumented in the docstring. This ticket adds the relevant documentation.
