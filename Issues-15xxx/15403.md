`knapsack` can be passed a list of arbitrary tuples (not just pairs), as in

```
sage: knapsack( [(1,2,'spam'), (1.5,1,'a'), (0.5,3,'lot')], max=2)
[5.0, [(1, 2, 'spam'), (0.500000000000000, 3, 'lot')]]
```

This is useful if one wants to attach data to a knapsack problem, however it
is undocumented in the docstring. This ticket adds the relevant documentation.

Hellooooooo !!

I rephrased the first of the two explanations, what do you think ? It is in branch u/ncohen/15403. If you agree with it, you can merge it into yours and set the ticket to positive review. Aaaaaaaaaaaaaannddd I will probably create another ticket to clean up a bit the documentation of this knapsack module, as a couple of bad things happen in there (like a copy/pasted definition, links that can be rewritten, etc) `;-)`

Thaaaaanks !
