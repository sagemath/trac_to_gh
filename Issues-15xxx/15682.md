This was already mentioned in http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/10820 (comments 10 and 11), but no ticket was opened.
Note: The problem was also mentioned by jpflori in http://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/ExoticPorts.

A fix is to copy the 3 lines for armv7l in spkg-install (lines 84 to 86) and c/7/6/.  
Since I am new to Trac and git it may take me some time to create the fix :-/
