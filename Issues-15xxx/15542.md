This is not correct:

```
sage: Reals(200)(RR(1.0e-20))
1.0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000e-20
```
since `RR(1.0e-20)` is actually equal to 6646139978924579Â·2<sup>-119</sup>, and indeed:

```
sage: Reals(200)(RR(1.0e-20).exact_rational())
9.9999999999999994515327145420957165172950370278739244710772e-21
```

Also note that the following related examples work:

```
sage: Reals(200)(RDF(1.0e-20))
9.9999999999999994515327145420957165172950370278739244710772e-21

At least the behaviour is intentional, so it's by definition not a bug. Perhaps it's a bad design decision. But if you want to argue for that, please do it on `sage-devel`, not this ticket.

then it should be documented somewhere. Where?

Also:

```
sage: a=RealField(53)(1.0e-20)
sage: a.exact_rational?
...
   Returns the exact rational representation of this floating-point number.
```
thus either `a` is **exactly** `10^(-20)`, and then `exact_rational` should return that
value, or it is not, and `Reals(200)(a.exact_rational())` should return `6646139978924579/664613997892457936451903530140172288`

Replying to [@mezzarobba](#comment%3A6):
> `1.0e-20` should be preparsed to something else than an element of `RR`!

To clarify, I don't really care whether `Reals(200)(1.0e-20)` yields `1.0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000e-20` or `9.9999999999999994515327145420957165172950370278739244710772e-21`. I find `RealLiteral`s confusing, but the way `Reals(200)(1.0e-20)` works is not a bug by itself.

The way `Reals(200)(RR(1.0e-20))` works is a more serious problem, however. In other words, unless we simply get rid of  `RealLiteral`s (as Paul just suggested on sage-devel), they should be elements of some ad hoc that coerces into real fields (or perhaps even of `QQ`), not of real fields themselves!
