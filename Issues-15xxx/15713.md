Some basic stuff in Sage should *just work* without the user having to bother with whether they are using the right field. Creating matrices is really easy, and so should the basic operations on the matrices.

This ticket is about linear algebra. Things like eigenvalues, eigenvectors, solve, determinant, echelon forms, etc., should give the correct answer. Period. The user should not be left guessing whether the answer *could* have been "correct" if the field was changed.

Make other tickets dealing with such issues a dependency of this one.
