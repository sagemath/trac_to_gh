Not yet. IMHO the "make [p]test[long]" commands should error out if there is a problem building the documentation. Trying to catch it on the buildbot is way too late in the whole process. Since our doc builder is a bit fickle that would involve doing a full rebuild, I think. Still relatively fast compared to doctesting. In any case, further discussion on this should go into another ticket.

No, `make doc` should error out, doctests have nothing to do with this.

Better late than never...

Checking it on the buildbot is trivial:

```
if grep -e 'Segmentation fault' -e SEVERE -e ERROR -e '^make.*Error' -e 'Exception occurred' -e 'Sphinx error' logs/dochtml.log logs/docpdf.log
then
    exit 1
fi

if grep -e WARNING logs/dochtml.log
then
    exit 1
fi
```
(The pdf check must be done only on systems with LaTeX and dvipng installed, but that should be the case for all buildbot slaves)

Of course. But better check it in a stupid way and too late instead of no checking at all.

Your comment is a reply to my question to you, sooooo, I hope it is OK that my reply to your counter-question is a bunch of counter-counter-questions.

Mainly I want to know what you (as the author) have to say about the purpose of this method.

Is this method supposed to be called by people? Or is it an auxiliary method that should only be called internally, i.e., called from other methods that only work for simple graphs? The name suggests to me that the latter is the case, but I think you know better than I what the purpose of this method is.

I think a method that is supposed to be called by people should be named ".is_simple()", and it shouldn't scream but return True resp. False. Of course, regardless of its name, the method must have a docstring and tests.

Can you argue why this method is more than just an internally used method? If it is more than that, then I wouldn't mind at all to keep it in the docs. Otherwise, I would mind a little bit, but not much.

<a id='comment:17'></a>Hey guys, what's the hurry ? This ticket has been open 7 days ago (and for the first 4 days I had no computer to work with) and we can fix what it inside in something like 20 minutes `:-P`

Anyway: this function is only for internal use, that's why I did not add it to the index. Let's remove it. I will do so in a split second, and fix whatever needs to be fixed for the other graphs errors. BRB !
