Not yet. IMHO the "make [p]test[long]" commands should error out if there is a problem building the documentation. Trying to catch it on the buildbot is way too late in the whole process. Since our doc builder is a bit fickle that would involve doing a full rebuild, I think. Still relatively fast compared to doctesting.

No, `make doc` should error out, doctests have nothing to do with this.

Better late than never...

Checking it on the buildbot is trivial:

```
if grep -e 'Segmentation fault' -e SEVERE -e ERROR -e '^make.*Error' -e 'Exception occurred' -e 'Sphinx error' logs/dochtml.log logs/docpdf.log
then
    exit 1
fi

if grep -e WARNING logs/dochtml.log
then
    exit 1
fi
```
(The pdf check must be done only on systems with LaTeX and dvipng installed, but that should be the case for all buildbot slaves)

The error concerning `_scream_if_not_simple` seems easy to explain. "Grep" says:

```
src/sage/graphs/generic_graph.py:    .. autofunction:: _scream_if_not_simple
```
So, a function on module level is supposed to be included in the documentation. But in fact, `_scream_if_not_simple` is a method of the class `GenericGraph`. I don't know if
`.. autofunction:: GenericGraph._scream_if_not_simple` is the correct syntax.

Anyway, Nathann: Do we want to read about `_scream_if_not_simple` in the reference manual?

Your comment is a reply to my question to you, sooooo, I hope it is OK that my reply to your counter-question is a bunch of counter-counter-questions.

Mainly I want to know what you (as the author) have to say about the purpose of this method.

Is this method supposed to be called by people? Or is it an auxiliary method that should only be called internally, i.e., called from other methods that only work for simple graphs? The name suggests to me that the latter is the case, but I think you know better than I what the purpose of this method is.

I think a method that is supposed to be called by people should be named ".is_simple()", and it shouldn't scream but return True resp. False. Of course, regardless of its name, the method must have a docstring and tests.

Can you argue why this method is more than just an internally used method? If it is more than that, then I wouldn't mind at all to keep it in the docs. Otherwise, I would mind a little bit, but not much.

In order to make this ticket move, can we just remove `_scream_if_not_simple` completely from the documentation?

Simon King asked some good questions, but those really should not hold up this ticket. Nathann can still open a new ticket to add `_scream_if_not_simple` to the documentation.
