When not working with regular crystals, one gets an infinite recursion when calling `phi`:

```
sage: B = CrystalOfTableaux(['A',2], shape=[2,1])
sage: La = RootSystem(['A',2]).ambient_space().fundamental_weights()
sage: T = TensorProductOfCrystals(TCrystal(['A',2], La[1]+La[2]), B)
sage: t = T.an_element()
sage: t.phi(1)
```
