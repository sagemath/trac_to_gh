`QQbar` and `AA` are very slow, to the point of often being unusable. There are many reasons to that (see #18333), including computations being triggered when they shouldn't, internal operations that construct elements of large degree, and incomplete of caching in some places. Yet the most visible issue by far is that, each time a new extension is constructed internally, we try to optimize its representation using PARI's `polredbest()`. This is bad, since `polredbest()` can easily take days for moderately large extensions, and only made worse by other issues that lead to lots of large extensions being created.

The reasons I can see to call `polredbest()` are:
* to limit the creation of isomorphic number fields (but with no guarantee that we'll avoid it completely),
* to speed up subsequent computations in these number fields,
* and perhaps also, in simple cases, to make the elements more readable.
None of these is worth letting simple computations hang forever.

This ticket restricts the optimization step using `polredbest()` to cases where (based on the size of the defining polynomial) it can be expected to finish in reasonable time.

I asked Karim Belabas. Here is what I understand of his answer:
* the cost of `polredbest` for a polynomial of degree `n` with coefficients of bit size `B` is roughly `n^5 B^2`;
* the best it can do is to reduce the cost of subsequent computations in the extension by a factor of roughly `B^2`;
* it is essentially never worth calling it on polynomials of moderately large degree;
* ...except before performing very expensive operations (typically `bnfinit()`) on the extension, when there is reason to expect that it will find a defining polynomial of very small height.

On a related note, I noticed that `QQbar` often calls `polredbest` on polynomials of the form `p(x^k)` where `k` can be pretty large. Karim suggested that the Pari function `rnfpolredbest` could be useful in this case.

I agree that dropping that function seems a reasonable approach to the problem at hand. In particular, if we follow the idea from #17886 then operations within a single number field would become even rarer, so the benefit of a reduced basis would be less as well.

As a middle ground, it might be possible to do the reduction lazily, once it looks as if there would be a sufficient number of operations performed in the same number field to justify the time spent for this computation. But since implementing this could be a major effort, I'm not really suggesting this approach, just mentioning it as an idea if there is too much objection to dropping the reduction altogether.

Here is one example which doesn't complete in over 6 hours, due to the call to `polredbest`. I had this as the motivating example for #17896 which looks like a duplicate of this one here.

```
sage: x,y = polygens(QQ,"x,y")
sage: p1 = x^5 + 6*x^4 - 42*x^3 - 142*x^2 + 467*x + 422
sage: p2 = p1(x=(x-1)^2)
sage: p3 = p2(x=x*y).resultant(p2,x).univariate_polynomial()
sage: p4, = [f[0] for f in p3.factor() if f[0].degree() == 80]
sage: ival = CIF((0.77, 0.78), (-0.08, -0.07))
sage: z, = [r for r in p4.roots(QQbar, False) if r in ival]
sage: %time z.exactify()
```

-Zero-tests in `QQbar` and `AA` are very slow—slower than can be reasonably expected of exact computations with algebraic numbers IMHO.
+`QQbar` and `AA` are very slow, to the point of often being unusable. There are many reasons to that (see #18333), including computations being triggered when they shouldn't, internal operations that construct elements of large degree, and incomplete of caching in some places. Yet the most visible issue by far is that, each time a new extension is constructed internally, we try to optimize its representation using PARI's `polredbest()`. This is bad, since `polredbest()` can easily take days for moderately large extensions, and only made worse by other issues that lead to lots of large extensions being created.
 
-On some examples, it turns out that 80% or more of the time is spent calling PARI's `polredbest`. The current implementation apparently calls `polredbest` each time exact computations in a new extension are required, which can be pretty expensive. It does so in the hope of finding a "nice" primitive element whose use will speed up subsequent computations (and perhaps also make the descriptions of the elements slightly more readable?), but otherwise my understanding is that this step is completely optional.
+The reasons I can see to call `polredbest()` are:
+* to limit the creation of isomorphic number fields (but with no guarantee that we'll avoid it completely),
+* to speed up subsequent computations in these number fields,
+* and perhaps also, in simple cases, to make the elements more readable.
+None of these is worth letting simple computations hang forever.

As we realized with Pascal Molin, this is related in particular to #26898. What used to happen is that hashing an algebraic number α would trigger the exact computation, not just of α itself, but of the *real and imaginary parts* of α *+ β* for some β ∈ ℚ[i]...
