Sage 5.11:

```
sage: kronecker_delta??
...
        Kronecker delta is a symmetric function. We keep arguments sorted to
        ensure that (k_d(m, n) - k_d(n, m) cancels automatically::
```
There is an extra open parenthesis above.

Note: this is a sample new ticket I will use for the Sage coding sprints at Euroscipy 2013 on
Sunday 25, August. Please don't modify it (but you can comment).
