Currently, the two implementations of k-charge do not give the same answer:

```
sage: T = WeakTableaux(4,[4,3,2,1],[2,2,2,2,1,1],representation='bounded')
sage: for t in T:
    print t.k_charge(), t.k_charge(algorithm='J')
....:
9 10
10 10
8 8
9 9
10 10
8 9
11 11
```
Comparing against the expansion of Hall-Littlewood symmetric functions in terms of k-Schur functions, it seems that the I-implementation is correct

```
sage: Sym = SymmetricFunctions(QQ['t'])
sage: Qp = Sym.hall_littlewood().Qp()
sage: ks = Sym.kschur(4)
sage: ks(Qp[2,2,2,2,1,1])[Partition([4,3,2,1])]
t^11 + 2*t^10 + 2*t^9 + 2*t^8
```

Compared to the book http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3569 pg. 84
the bug seems to be in the method _height_of_restricted_subword in k_tableau.py.

Proposition 3.15 on p. 84 of [our book](https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~anne/FQ2012/book-released-September2012.pdf) states that the k-charge with the two algorithms are equal.  Am I correct to assume that since you opened a ticket that the error is in the algorithm and not in that proposition?

To clarify

```
sage: T = WeakTableau([[1, 1, 2, 3], [2, 4, 4], [3, 6], [5]],4,representation='bounded')
sage: T.k_charge()
9
sage: T.k_charge(algorithm='J')
10

Yes, I think the implementation that Avi and Nate did is not quite correct. If you look at the second standard subword of your example above, then the program computes the height of the restricted subword incorrectly for the letter r=3.
