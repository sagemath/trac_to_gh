Currently, the two implementations of k-charge do not give the same answer:

```
sage: T = WeakTableaux(4,[4,3,2,1],[2,2,2,2,1,1],representation='bounded')
sage: for t in T:
    print t.k_charge(), t.k_charge(algorithm='J')
....:
9 10
10 10
8 8
9 9
10 10
8 9
11 11
```
Comparing against the expansion of Hall-Littlewood symmetric functions in terms of k-Schur functions, it seems that the I-implementation is correct

```
sage: Sym = SymmetricFunctions(QQ['t'])
sage: Qp = Sym.hall_littlewood().Qp()
sage: ks = Sym.kschur(4)
sage: ks(Qp[2,2,2,2,1,1])[Partition([4,3,2,1])]
t^11 + 2*t^10 + 2*t^9 + 2*t^8
```

Compared to the book http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3569 pg. 84
the bug seems to be in the method _height_of_restricted_subword in k_tableau.py.

Proposition 3.15 on p. 84 of [our book](https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~anne/FQ2012/book-released-September2012.pdf) states that the k-charge with the two algorithms are equal.  Am I correct to assume that since you opened a ticket that the error is in the algorithm and not in that proposition?

To clarify

```
sage: T = WeakTableau([[1, 1, 2, 3], [2, 4, 4], [3, 6], [5]],4,representation='bounded')
sage: T.k_charge()
9
sage: T.k_charge(algorithm='J')

I ran the following code for k=3 and 4 and now the two implementations seem to agree:

```
sage: for n in range(10):
    for la in Partitions(n,max_part=k):
        for mu in Partitions(n,max_part=k):
            T = WeakTableaux(k,la,mu,representation='bounded')
            if not all(t.k_charge() == t.k_charge(algorithm="J") for t in T):
