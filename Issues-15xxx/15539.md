They weren't even the standard binary environment variables, and they relied on experimental spkgs.

> Good riddance, did you "steal" the setup.py patch from somewhere else?


It's a patch that I submitted upstream (was originally based on the development branch - hence broken, but now fixed).

> Gentoo has a similar one.
> I think the only missing from that ticket is the removal of pil itself.


I see no reason to delete PIL -- it can just be an optional/experiment spkg.

I think it would make more sense to remove `build/pkgs/pil/`: we don't have any files in `build/pkgs` for other optional/experimental packages, do we? I actually don't know how optional packages are implemented: still as spkgs? Is that going to change?

I would also vote for a lowercase "p".

<a id='comment:19'></a>I think that the naming convention must still be the old SPKG naming rule: only lowercase letters, numbers, and underscores. I personally wouldn't object to changing this convention, but that needs to be discussed on sage-devel, not here.

If we end up changing it, then because of the brain-dead way the standard OS X file system treats upper and lower case, I think we can never have two packages whose name only differs in capitalization. So then we should have commands like `sage -i PKG_NAME` ignore case, to make `sage -i Pillow` and `sage -i pillow` (for example) perform the same function.

Maybe it doesn't have to do with the OSX filesystem (although, maybe python's urllib stuff builds to be case-insensitive on a case-insensitive filesystem).

No, I purposely deleted it to test, and it indeed downloaded a new tarball.
