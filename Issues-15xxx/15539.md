They weren't even the standard binary environment variables, and they relied on experimental spkgs.

> Good riddance, did you "steal" the setup.py patch from somewhere else?

It's a patch that I submitted upstream (was originally based on the development branch - hence broken, but now fixed).

> Gentoo has a similar one.
> I think the only missing from that ticket is the removal of pil itself.

I see no reason to delete PIL -- it can just be an optional/experiment spkg.

I see no reason to keep something that is, for all purpose, dead. But the point is minor

I would be in favor of having everything lower case, otherwise it'll be annoying to type on the commandline `build/pkgs/PyCrypto` etc... But then its not a big deal if you insist on capital letters for Pillow ;-)

I think it would make more sense to remove `build/pkgs/pil/`: we don't have any files in `build/pkgs` for other optional/experimental packages, do we? I actually don't know how optional packages are implemented: still as spkgs? Is that going to change?

I would also vote for a lowercase "p".

Maybe it doesn't have to do with the OSX filesystem (although, maybe python's urllib stuff builds to be case-insensitive on a case-insensitive filesystem).
