HMmmmmmmm `O_o`

By the way, shouldn't Hadamard matrices be in the design/ folder ? `O_o`

I am changing a lot of things in those files these days and the patches are still waiting for review, but it's rather some design-related stuff to me !

What do you think ?

It's one big eye, and a smaller one. It represents doubt and background thinking process `:-P`

I first thought that this would patch would be incompatible with one of my design patches (Gosh, I think I must have a chain of 5 patches depending on each other `:-/`) but fortunately #14950 has been dealt with some time ago. AAAAAAnd there is a `designs.HadamardDesign` function already, so there is no need to do that `:-)`

By the way, would you feel like reviewing any of #15107 #15285 #15286 #15287 #15288  or #15310 ? `:-P`
I even (GREAT) wrote some code that has to go after those, but the situations is quite scary already `:-P`
