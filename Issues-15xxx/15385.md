HMmmmmmmm `O_o`

By the way, shouldn't Hadamard matrices be in the design/ folder ? `O_o`

I am changing a lot of things in those files these days and the patches are still waiting for review, but it's rather some design-related stuff to me !

What do you think ?

I even (GREAT) wrote some code that has to go after those, but the situations is quite scary already `:-P`
