[LattE (Lattice point Enumeration) Integrale](https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~latte/) is a suite of C/C++ programs that solves  the problems of counting lattice points in and integration over convex polytopes, implementing e.g. Barvinok's algorithm for counting.

To integrate it into Sage properly, an interface needs to be created, but the first step is to make the source code installable, as executables/headers etc.

This is done in this [spkg](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/dima/packages/latte_int-1.6.spkg).
It has `spkg-check` script, which can be used to check the installation.

<a id='comment:10'></a>Hi!

At Sage Days 60, a user asked me about the status of LattE integration. So I tried installing the LattE package. I first checked I had all the dependencies mentioned in the SPKG.txt (GMP (MPIR), 4ti2, NTL, cddlib):

```
sage -i
Currently installed packages:
...
4ti2-1.6.2
mpir-2.6.0.p4
ntl-6.1.0.p0
cddlib-094g.p0
...
```
The compilation failed complaining about a missing GMP dependency:

```
sage -i latte_int
...
checking for GMP >= 3.1.1... configure: error: GMP not found!
GMP version 3.1.1 or greater is required for LattE to compile. Please
make sure GMP is installed and specify its location with the option
--with-gmp=<prefix> when running configure.
```
Suggestions? Should I open a new ticket?

For the record, out of curiosity, I tried

```
mistral-~>sage -i gmp
Found local metadata for gmp-5.1.3
Attempting to download package gmp-5.1.3
>>> Trying to download http://www.sagemath.org/packages/upstream/gmp/gmp-5.1.3.tar.bz2
[Traceback (most recent call last):

    fp = self.open(url, data)
  File "/opt/sage-git/local/lib/python/urllib.py", line 208, in open
    return getattr(self, name)(url)
  File "/opt/sage-git/local/lib/python/urllib.py", line 359, in open_http
    return self.http_error(url, fp, errcode, errmsg, headers)
  File "/opt/sage-git/local/lib/python/urllib.py", line 376, in http_error
    return self.http_error_default(url, fp, errcode, errmsg, headers)
  File "<stdin>", line 17, in http_error_default
IOError: [Errno 404] Not Found: '//www.sagemath.org/packages/upstream/gmp/gmp-5.1.3.tar.bz2'
Error: failed to download package gmp-5.1.3
```
but this is probably just outdated stuff since gmp is listed in none of the package lists (std/opt/exp).

Thanks!

  Nicolas

It works for me on Sage 6.4.beta0.
Probably your Sage install is slightly nuked...
