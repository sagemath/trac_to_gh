Somebody asked on `AskSage` how to compute the faces of a graph. And well, one wouldn't think of looking for `trace_faces`, to let's rename it `:-P`

This ticket also renames (with a deprecated alias) the method `check_embedding_validity` and `check_pos_validity` to `_check_embedding_validity` and `_check_pos_validity`. These things are internal things and should stay internal.

A few minor things:

- The alignment of the <code>\`\`embedding\`\`</code> input bullet-point is off by a space (lines 3729-3734).
- Instead of `doctest:1: message` could you change it to the more robust `doctest:...: message`?
- Could you use `Return` instead of `Returns` on line 3721?
- I believe the error messages should be formatted as `ValueError("lower case with no period")`.

Otherwise looks good. Thanks.
