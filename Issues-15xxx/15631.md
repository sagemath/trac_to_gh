This is because the singular pexpect interface has subtle bugs. The easy fix is to rewrite it with disabled terminal echo.

Annoyingly, the pexpect stuff in Sage is built around terminal echo: everything up to the first return is presumed echo and ignored. So I had to revert to a hack...

Question: as far as pexpect interface goes, singular is pretty vanilla if I'm not mistaken. That makes me think that whatever approach you have taken to make no-echo work with singular might apply more generally. Would it be doable to include the new way of handling "noecho" in our pexpect wrapper and select it with another flag to be set on startup? Then the code could be reused for other interfaces too.

I've added a `terminal_echo=<bool>` optional keyword argument to `Expect`, this saves some code but makes the `_eval_line` method even more ugly.... oh well.
