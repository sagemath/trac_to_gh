This is to allow for 'textbook style' of derivatives - something like \partial!^!{2}/\partial xy\,f(x, y), instead of D[0,1](f)(x,y) for a more readable output, especially in LaTeX in the notebook environment. I imagine it working like this:

```
sage: var('x y z'); f = function('f', x, y, z)
sage: from sage.symbolic.pynac import textbook_style_deriv 
sage: textbook_style_deriv(True) 
sage: f.diff(x,z,y,z) 
D^4/Dxyzz f(x, y, z) 
sage: latex(f.diff(x,z,y,z)) 
\frac{\partial^4}{\partial\,xyzz}f(x, y, z) 
sage: textbook_style_deriv(False) 
sage: f.diff(x,z,y,z) 
D[0, 1, 2, 2](f)(x, y, z)
```

I think this has been proposed before. The problem is that there is not enough information available to use Leibniz notation. Consider the following examples and decide 

```
sage: var("x,y,u,v")
sage: function('f')
sage: ddf=f(x,y).diff(x,y).operator()
sage: ddf(x^2+y^2,x-y)   ## 1
D[0, 1](f)(x^2 + y^2, x - y)
sage: ddf(v,u)           ## 2
D[0, 1](f)(v, u)
sage: ddf(x,x^2+y)           ## 3
D[0, 1](f)(x, x^2+y)
```
I think Maple uses Leibniz notation if it applies (i.e., all parameters are distinct pure variables) and reverts to operator (Euler?) notation otherwise; also indexed by parameter position rather than name.

Dear All, I have added a newer patch with an additional switch that allows for omitting the arguments of a function: 

```
var('x y z'); f = function('f', x, y, z)
f.diff(x,z,y,z)
D[0, 1, 2, 2](f)(x, y, z)
from sage.symbolic.pynac import omit_function_args
omit_function_args(True)
D[0, 1, 2, 2](f)

Not a good idea. How do you tell apart the two following extremely different objects:

```
sage: sage.symbolic.operators.FDerivativeOperator(f,[0,1,2,2])
D[0, 1, 2, 2](f)
sage: f(x,y,z).diff(x,z,y,z)
D[0, 1, 2, 2](f)(x, y, z)
```
The standard printing reflects exactly their relation: The second is obtained by evaluating the first at `(x,y,z)`.

I think having a printing option that does something along the lines of

```
if (isinstance(expr.operator(), sage.symbolic.operators.FDerivativeOperator) and
        are_all_distinct_pure_variables(expr.operands())):
    return "diff(%s%s,%s)"%(
        expr.operator().function(),
        tuple(expr.operands()),
        tuple( v.operands()[i] for i in v.operator().parameter_set())
else:
    return <normal string rep>
```
would be reasonable. That's the same approach maple seems to take.

I think this can be closed as "invalid/fixed/obsolete". This is how it works nowadays:

```
sage: var('x,y,z')                                                                                                          
(x, y, z)
sage: function('f')                                                                                                         
f
sage: f(x,y,z).diff(x,z,y,z)                                                                                                
diff(f(x, y, z), x, y, z, z)
```
