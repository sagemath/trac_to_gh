CC:  @ohanar jpflori

This fixes a hash failure due to the Cython upgrade #15755

Note: I'm curently not testing every ticket on 32-bit since we don't have a buildslave that can do it in a reasonable amount of time.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/15863

Can you confirm then that doctests do not pass with #15755 and they do pass with #15863?

> Also, there is nothing wrong with returning `long` for hashes on obsolete platforms imho.

Who says it only happens on "obsolete" platforms?

It works on LP64. Nobody in their right mind is going to use 32-bit or Windows 64 for scientific computations nowadays.
