Can you confirm then that doctests do not pass with #15755 and they do pass with #15863?

> Also, there is nothing wrong with returning `long` for hashes on obsolete platforms imho.

Who says it only happens on "obsolete" platforms?

Yes.

It works on LP64. Nobody in their right mind is going to use 32-bit or Windows 64 for scientific computations nowadays.
