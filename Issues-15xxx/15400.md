Actions of 2x2 matrices on binary quadratic forms don't work:

```
sage: Q = BinaryQF([1,2,3]); Q
x^2 + 2*x*y + 3*y^2
sage: A = matrix(QQ,2,2,[1,2,3,4])
sage: R.<x,y> = QQ[]
sage: Q(x+2*y,3*x+4*y)
34*x^2 + 96*x*y + 68*y^2
sage: Q.matrix_action_left(A)
17*x^2 + 74*x*y + 81*y^2
```

Are you sure your example shouldn't use the right action?

```
sage: Q.matrix_action_right(A)
34*x^2 + 96*x*y + 68*y^2
