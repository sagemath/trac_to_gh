At [this ask.sagemath question](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/3499/looong-computation-by-desolve_rk4), the following issue came up.

```
    sage: desolve_rk4(f(t,y), y, ivar=t, ics=[0,-4], end_points=[0,.4])
    [[0, -4],
     [0.1, -6.44026308551],
     [0.2, -18.4360863753],
     [0.3, -9638.98851821],
     [0.4, -2.29907718472e+44]]
```
works, but 

```
    sage: desolve_rk4(f(t,y), y, ivar=t, ics=[0,-4], end_points=[0,.5])
    TypeError: unable to make sense of Maxima expression '[[0,-4],[0.1,-6.440263085506939],[0.2,-18.436086375306434],[.30000000000000004,-9638.988518207414],[0.4,-229907718471530700000000000000000000000000000.],[0.5,-.000000000000000.000000000000000]]' in Sage
```
and indeed `-.000000000000000.000000000000000` makes no sense inside of Sage.  I'm not sure what it's supposed to mean in Maxima, either!

Here is the problem, in Maxima.

```
    (%i1) rk(6+y-y^2,y,-4,[t,0,.5,.1]);
    (%o1) [[0, - 4], [0.1, - 6.440263085506939], [0.2, - 18.436086375306434], 
    [.30000000000000004, - 9638.988518207414], [0.4, - 2.2990771847153071e+44], 
    [0.5, - .000000000000000e+4932]]
```

I'm not sure exactly what is going on in Sage here, because

```
sage: a = maxima('- 2.2990771847153071e+44')
sage: a._sage_()
-2.29907718472e+44
sage: b = maxima(' - .000000000000000e+4932')
sage: b._sage_()
0.0
```
so it must be something about how these are translated.

Does this help?

```
sage: E=maxima_calculus('rk(6+y-y^2,y,-4,[t,0,.5,.1])')
sage: E.ecl()
<ECL: ((MLIST SIMP) ((MLIST SIMP) 0 -4) ((MLIST SIMP) 0.1 -6.440263085506939)
 ((MLIST SIMP) 0.2 -18.436086375306434)
 ((MLIST SIMP) 0.30000000000000004 -9638.988518207414)
 ((MLIST SIMP) 0.4 -2.299077184715307e44)
 ((MLIST SIMP) 0.5 #.ext::double-float-negative-infinity))>
```
it seems to be ECL's own IEEE negative infinity, which seems to get handled a little strange by maxima.
