This should surely be renamed to "Update to MPIR 2.6.1" when the official version get released (no idea when...).

On top of that the current MPIR 2.6.0 fails to properly build on Cygwin when CXX support is not enabled.
Therefore it is not possible/easy to build GCC on Cygwin.
That is because of a dirty hack in the autotools stuff already present in GMP before MPIR was forked.
This is also fixed in the current git version.

Otherwise we'd probably have to close it as *won't fix*. :-)

Current upstream tarball: http://mpir.org/mpir-2.7.0-alpha4.tar.bz2


Still needs to be tested on Darwin PowerPC I think.  (moufang?  Does it still live?)

And probably also Macs with more recent versions of Xcode.

I think that would be convenient for testing, and there are still some issues on Cygwin* JP knows about.

By the way, note that the latest changes in the alpha4 tarball aren't yet committed on github (it's still at alpha3).

I happens I did and almost have an almost completely working out of the box cygwin64 branch.
I just have to cherry-pick commits and push them to different branches on trac.

A few comments/questions:

* Do we lose the Clang / XCode 5 patch?  (I did have other `clang` patches elsewhere, also just preventing `configure` to fail for no real reason.)

* Sun compiler patch (probably less important)?

* What is `patch ... || continue` supposed to achieve?  (The `if [ $? -ne 0 ]` afterwards gets useless.)

When there is no patch at all I guess.
Not sure naymore.

The CXXFLAGS issue should be fixed in MPIR (maybe not alpha4, but in git master).

Ah, thought of something like that.  But it should be

```sh
for foo in bar*; do
    [ -r "$foo" ] || continue   # ignore non-readable / non-existent files
    process "$foo"
    if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
        # processing $foo failed, err out

<a id='comment:27'></a>
In `spkg-install`, I also changed

```
echo "Checking what CFLAGS MPIR would use if they were empty..."
(unset CFLAGS CPPFLAGS CXXFLAGS && ./configure $MPIR_CONFIGURE) &>configure-empty.log
```
to

```
echo "Configuring MPIR with empty CFLAGS to determine the defaults:"
(unset CFLAGS CPPFLAGS CXXFLAGS && ./configure $MPIR_CONFIGURE)
```

I think it's better to display the first `configure` run, in case it needs to be debugged or just to show the user that Sage isn't stuck.
