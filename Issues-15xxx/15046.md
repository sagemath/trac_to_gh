I'd like to look at this - can you confirm that you are giving positive review to Eviatar's original changes?  If so, I think I only need to give this one more good look and try out some more numerical things to confirm it's ready to go.

By the way, I note some inconsistency (probably due to my relative unfamiliarity with elliptic integrals).  I see

```
This returns the value of the "incomplete elliptic integral of the
    second kind"
```
in two places, `EllipticE` and `EllipticEU`.  Since [the Maxima manual](http://maxima.sourceforge.net/docs/manual/maxima_16.html#Item_003a-elliptic_005feu) clarifies the relationship, we should too.  Indeed, there is a bunch of stuff in here which assumes familiarity with syntax for the Jacobi functions `dn` or `sn` or the rest which should be clarified.
