By the way, I note some inconsistency (probably due to my relative unfamiliarity with elliptic integrals).  I see

```
This returns the value of the "incomplete elliptic integral of the

```
in two places, `EllipticE` and `EllipticEU`.  Since [the Maxima manual](http://maxima.sourceforge.net/docs/manual/maxima_16.html#Item_003a-elliptic_005feu) clarifies the relationship, we should too.
