The `seed` keyword seems to be ignored/ineffective when used to initialize a GSL probability distribution.  However the `.set_seed()` method seems to behave better.  So the logic to use a seed must be there, so maybe the problem is not too serious.

I have not investigated further (scope, or explanation).  I do not think this is related to #9770, though it looks similar.

Had to fix one other doctest, which was previously passing only because of the bug fixed here.  Patch passes all tests, etc on 5.11.

Lots of places where this module could use some love.
