We can't take the complement of an immutable graph:

```
sage: Gamma = graphs.PathGraph(5).copy(immutable=True)
sage: Gamma.complement()
NotImplementedError
```
which is because `copy(Gamma)` doesn't return a mutable copy.

Done and NR. Although making an immutable copy destroys the name of the graph, so a slightly different question is do we want that behavior.

O_o

Destroys the name of the graph ? Why ? Well if it does I guess it's a bug, isn't it ? `O_o`

Besides : shouldn't the complement of an immutable graph be immutable ?

There are so many functions that will react oddly to immutable graphs....

> Ah, I see. I also understand why you want to keep the same layout as the original graph too.


Yep. It's just unfortunate for this graph `^^;`

I agree that it is a bug:

```
sage: G = graphs.PathGraph(5)
sage: G
Path Graph: Graph on 5 vertices
sage: G.copy()
Path Graph: Graph on 5 vertices
sage: G.copy(immutable=True)
Graph on 5 vertices
```

> Besides : shouldn't the complement of an immutable graph be immutable ?


What's the "canonical" way to check if a graph `G` is immutable? `hasattr(G, '_immutable') and G._immutable`?
 
> There are so many functions that will react oddly to immutable graphs....


We'll just keep fixing them as we come across them I guess.

Hmmmmmmm.... Well, we have been using `if hasattr(G, '_immutable', False):` several times now, even if I don't like it. But my main reason for not liking it is that the Poset backend have this variable set while they are not immutable, and #15623 will fix it anyway... So perhaps we can do that indeed.
