```
We can't take the complement of an immutable graph:

```
sage: Gamma = graphs.PathGraph(5).copy(immutable=True)
sage: Gamma.complement()
NotImplementedError
```
which is because `copy(Gamma)` doesn't return a mutable copy.


Depends on #15681

Hello Travis !

Well, I guess you can fix this one yourself ! You should just add a `immutable=True` to the call of `copy` in this method. Besides, your second example of code is not really a bug. `GC` is what it should be, but if you plot the complement of a graph with the same layout as for the original graph, it so happens that the edges are all horizontal too. You can add a `layout="spring"` to `plot()` to emphasize it.

Done and NR. Although making an immutable copy destroys the name of the graph, so a slightly different question is do we want that behavior.

Hello !

> Done and NR. Although making an immutable copy destroys the name of the graph, so a slightly different question is do we want that behavior.

O_o

Destroys the name of the graph ? Why ? Well if it does I guess it's a bug, isn't it ? `O_o`

Besides : shouldn't the complement of an immutable graph be immutable ?

There are so many functions that will react oddly to immutable graphs....

> Ah, I see. I also understand why you want to keep the same layout as the original graph too.

Yep. It's just unfortunate for this graph `^^;`

I agree that it is a bug:

```
sage: G = graphs.PathGraph(5)
sage: G
Path Graph: Graph on 5 vertices
sage: G.copy()
Path Graph: Graph on 5 vertices
sage: G.copy(immutable=True)
Graph on 5 vertices
```

> Besides : shouldn't the complement of an immutable graph be immutable ?

What's the "canonical" way to check if a graph `G` is immutable? `hasattr(G, '_immutable') and G._immutable`?
 
> There are so many functions that will react oddly to immutable graphs....

We'll just keep fixing them as we come across them I guess.

Hmmmmmmm.... Well, we have been using `if hasattr(G, '_immutable', False):` several times now, even if I don't like it. But my main reason for not liking it is that the Poset backend have this variable set while they are not immutable, and #15623 will fix it anyway... So perhaps we can do that indeed.

Okay, the names issue is actually something with the graph constructor:

```
sage: P = graphs.PetersenGraph()
sage: P
Petersen graph: Graph on 10 vertices
sage: Graph(P)
Petersen graph: Graph on 10 vertices
sage: Graph(P, immutable=False)
Petersen graph: Graph on 10 vertices
sage: Graph(P, immutable=True)
Graph on 10 vertices
sage: Graph(P, immutable=True, name="Petersen graph") # This is the bad one
Graph on 10 vertices
sage: Graph(_, immutable=False, name="Petersen graph")
Petersen graph: Graph on 10 vertices
```

Nathann, you're likely to know best how to fix that, do you think you could do it?
