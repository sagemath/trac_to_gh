From the [google notebook bug reports](https://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=pCwvGVwSMxTzT6E2xNdo5fA)

This hangs and cannot be interrupted:

```
sage: F.<a>=CyclotomicField(49); G = F['z,w'].fraction_field(); 1/G(a^28 + a^23 - 1)
```

The problem depends on the value that we are dividing by: `1/G(a^28 + a^23 + 1)` works and returns the correct value.

Ticket #15717 fixes the "cannot be interrupted" part of the bug.

CC:  doyle@math.dartmouth.edu jakobkroeker

Status: new

Dependencies: #14333

<a id='comment:13'></a>Agreed, it actually doesn't hang, just takes an extraordinary large amount of time:

```
sage: %time F.<a>=CyclotomicField(49); G = F['z,w'].fraction_field(); 1/G(a^28 + a^23 + 1)
CPU times: user 0.02 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.02 s
Wall time: 0.02 s
```

```
sage: %time F.<a>=CyclotomicField(49); G = F['z,w'].fraction_field(); 1/G(a^28 + a^23 - 1)
CPU times: user 11.64 s, sys: 0.06 s, total: 11.70 s
Wall time: 11.72 s
```

Needs a test and then a review?
