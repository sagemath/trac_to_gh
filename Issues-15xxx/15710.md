From the [google notebook bug reports](https://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=pCwvGVwSMxTzT6E2xNdo5fA)

This hangs and cannot be interrupted:

```
sage: F.<a>=CyclotomicField(49); G = F['z,w'].fraction_field(); 1/G(a^28 + a^23 - 1)
```

The problem depends on the value that we are dividing by: `1/G(a^28 + a^23 + 1)` works and returns the correct value.

Ticket #15717 fixes the "cannot be interrupted" part of the bug.

CC:  doyle@math.dartmouth.edu jakobkroeker

Status: new

Dependencies: #14333
