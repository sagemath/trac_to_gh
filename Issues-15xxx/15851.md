Coin does not properly initialise variables before solving,
leading to get_variables() segfaulting if it is called before
solving. The fix is to check that the pointer returned is not
NULL.

other backends return 0, and IMHO it's nice to have this consistent...

I would like to control the type of returned value in Cython. I guess 0.0 might be float
rather than double. I suppose making it return the same type always is a good idea, allowing
for faster compiled code.
