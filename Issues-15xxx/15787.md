Following the conversation on sage-release [1]. It looks like the files libptcblas and libptf77blas are not actually required by Atlas. And debian does not contain them anyway.

Just for the record:

Sage's current ATLAS package (3.10.1.20140210) also installs, besides `.la` files, the following ones not mentioned in the documentation:

* lib**pt**lapack.*   (also optional when using `SAGE_ATLAS_LIB`)

* `libsatlas`[`.so`]

* `libtatlas`[`.so`]

Don't know what the second and third are for; in contrast to the other shared libraries, those aren't versioned.
