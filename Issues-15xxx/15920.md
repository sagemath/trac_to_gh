These two changes looks fine. However, there is a third place that should be done in parallel.

`periodic_points=self.lift_to_rational_periodic(pos_points,B)`

in self.rational_periodic_points()


Also, it is convention not to use [CamelCase](CamelCase) variables names. (i.e. parallelData, possiblePeriods should be not have the capital in them).

I'm also marking 15966 as a dependency since without the cleanup of the child process these create too many child process to function well.

I'm getting some weird errors when I run the possible_periods over and over again (even on the same function). It seems to be somewhat random which error and whether or not an error occurs). I may or may not have corrupted my sage, but I don't want to leave this positive_review until I resolve it.

Errors like

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: number of arguments does not match number of variables in parent
```
and

```
 Traceback (most recent call last):
  ....
TypeError: unsupported operand parent(s) for '*': 'Finite Field of size 2' and 'Finite Field of size 13'
