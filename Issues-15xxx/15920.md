<a id='comment:9'></a>These two changes looks fine. However, there is a third place that should be done in parallel.

`periodic_points=self.lift_to_rational_periodic(pos_points,B)`

in self.rational_periodic_points()


Also, it is convention not to use [CamelCase](CamelCase) variables names. (i.e. parallelData, possiblePeriods should be not have the capital in them).

I'm also marking 15966 as a dependency since without the cleanup of the child process these create too many child process to function well.
