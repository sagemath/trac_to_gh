Currently when Sage is built, every dll produced from cython module is present twice in SAGE_ROOT (the exact location depends on hg or git version).
See https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/zlyuxWIcERQ/cLPRt2nufr4J

On cygwin, this completely pollutes the address space as only one of this two files is actually needed at runtime (not the on in build/lib.cygwin.../) and may lead to fork failures.
