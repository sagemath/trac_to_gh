This is a followup to #15161, fixing some problems which arose from the changes there. In particular, if CHomP was installed, then the changes at #15161 led to some doctest failures. These have mostly been corrected, except for failures as in #12607 and also that CHomP seems to be broken on my machine, so it is not computing homology groups correctly. I think we should put off actually fixing CHomP to #15202.
