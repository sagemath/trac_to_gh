As pointed by Paul Zimmerman inticket: ticket:11802#comment:16#comment:11802, the Lucas sequence which has been finally sped up and generalized in #11802, needs serious refactoring:

1) it makes no sense to have a `slow_lucas` and a `fast_lucas` function. The philosophy in Sage is to use `algorithm='recurrence'` or `algorithm='matrix_exponentiation'` instead (for example).

2) I don't see why the case Q<>1 could not be implemented either by the recurrence or the matrix
exponentiation.

3) instead of separate functions for ZZ and IntegerModRing(n), it would be nicer to have a single function with an option `ring=ZZ` (default) and `ring=IntegerModRing(15)`.

<a id='comment:1'></a>1) was partially done in #11802 where `slow_lucas()` was deprecated for (the more general) `BinaryRecurrenceSequence`. (`fast_lucas()` is [deprecated and] now called `lucas_q1()`).

However something else that might be useful is a class attribute in `BinaryRecurrenceSequence` called `lucas()` or `lucas_sequence()`, which takes the usual Lucas sequence input and converts it into the appropriate `BinaryRecurrenceSequence` input.

+1 for 3) with perhaps a minor variation: call the argument something like `mod` which takes an integer or `None` and creates the corresponding ring.

Overall I think what's best is one function which has the `algorithm` and `mod` arguments and possibly redirects to these subroutines depending upon the input.

Best,

Travis

I proposed `ring` in analogy to the `roots` function. I'm not sure `mod` is general enough,
for example one might want to use `ring=RIF` if one wants to compute the first digits of the 1000th Lucas number.

<a id='comment:7'></a>Actually, both `lucas_number1` and `lucas_number2` are broken:

```
sage: lucas_number1(100000,1,-1)
  File "<string>", line 1
    <integer 259Ellipsis875 (Integer(20899) digits)>
    ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```
Both are 2.5x slower than the general `CFiniteSequence` (#15714), so could now easily replaced by that. Using `lucas` fails at the moment with

```
sage: lucas(10,1,-1)[0]

which is a bit odd because there is no reason why it shouldn't work.
