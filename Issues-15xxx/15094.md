The patch does the following:

- Implement the internal coproduct on QSym, the ring of quasi-symmetric functions. (There is no reasonable internal product on QSym.)

- Implement the Frobenius=Adams endomorphisms on QSym. (There seems to be no Verschiebung.)

- Add a method that computes the lambda-ring operations at the monomial basis elements. This will be very useful later when we implement Hazewinkel's polynomial basis.

- Fix errors in the docstrings in `sage/combinat/ncsf_qsym/qsym.py`. The fundamental basis was defined incorrectly. The coproduct was claimed to be inherited from the polynomial ring (which was wrong). The finitely-many-variables case was moved from the beginning to the end of the introduction because it is not implemented in Sage. Shuffles were replaced by stuffles in the definition of the product on the monomial basis.

There are some obvious ways to go from here (corresponding changes on NSym, the Hazewinkel basis, possibly optimizing the dual immaculates etc.) but I am done for now.

The #14775 dependency is only because of a reference in the docstrings.

I cannot figure out why some of the doc strings do not appear in the documentation files (e.g. anything in `Bases.ElementMethods`).

Hi Darij,
I've finished reviewing this patch.  I have an additional handful of minor doc changes (which are harder to track down because they don't appear in the html file).

I added the dependency of #13505 because it modifies qsym.py and this patch will come after and so needs to be rebased.  Can you fold the patches and rebase against it (and #14101)?  I will upload a new version in a minute.

The reason why the documentation does not appear is that `class QuasiSymmetricFunctions -> class Bases -> class ElementMethods` is nested too far and there is a bug that prevents the documentation from being compiled.  Nicolas and others are working on a patch in #9107 to make the documentation in nested classes appear.

The strangest thing I found in the documentation is that the word `itself` was replaced by `itQuasiSymmetricFunctions`.  I cannot explain that.

Thanks for the update. Commenting as I'm reading through it:

Sorry for the trac syntax in the docstrings; that was stupid of me.

I've changed

```
	                This example demonstrates the non-commutativity of the internal 
	                coproduct::
```
into

```
                This is confirmed by the following Sage computation (incidentally
                demonstrating the non-cocommutativity of the internal
                coproduct)::
```

In contexts like

```
Element methods of the ``Monomial`` basis of ``QuasiSymmetricFunctions.``
```
the period should be outside of the verbatim mode.

I added a link to Gessel's paper in the reference list.

Replaced "degree of the power series" by "total degree of the power series".

"the product by the realization within the polynomial ring" replaced by "the product on the realization within the ring of power series".

The next paragraph now reads

```
    There is a coproduct on `\mathrm{QSym}` as well, which in the Monomial 
    basis acts by cutting the composition into a left half and a right
    half. The coproduct is not co-commutative::
```
