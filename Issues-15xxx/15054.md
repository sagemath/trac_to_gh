<a id='comment:12'></a>If you just want to see what is contained in this branch (whose last commit is 0a4240c) without seeing what is included in beta0 (whose commit is 3735dfd) you can do 

```
git log 0a4240c ^3735dfd --oneline
```

If you also want to ignore what was contained in the dependency #15049 (whose last commit was 3025cca) you can do 

```
