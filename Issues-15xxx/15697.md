Just for the record:

`configure` is still slightly broken w.r.t. `CC` and `CFLAGS`, since the "hack" currently ignores the setting of `CPP` (and instead tries `/lib/cpp` with `CPPFLAGS` first, which may not work, resulting in empty `CC` and `CFLAGS` settings from `gmp.h`, such that finally `gcc` is used, which may of course also fail).

I'll *one day*<sup>TM</sup> report this upstream.

I don't exactly recall what went wrong, but `configure` gave me something like

```
checking for CC and CFLAGS in gmp.h ... yes CC= CFLAGS=
```

and finally `gcc` was used (instead of `$CC`, while the same setting was recorded in `gmp.h`).

Ah, the problem arises when *none of* `/lib/cpp gcc cc c99` work (with `$CPPFLAGS`), since then `GMP_CC` and `GMP_CFLAGS` will remain **empty**, and / but

```sh
test "x$GMP_CFLAGS" = "x__GMP_CFLAGS" -o "x$GMP_CC" = "x__GMP_CC"
```
yields `false`, and

```sh
      AC_MSG_RESULT(yes [CC=$GMP_CC CFLAGS=$GMP_CFLAGS])
```
is executed, but **not** what follows (since `test -n "$GMP_CC$GMP_CFLAGS"` yields `false`):

```sh
   # Check for validity of CC and CFLAGS obtained from gmp.h
   if test -n "$GMP_CC$GMP_CFLAGS" ; then
      AC_MSG_CHECKING(for CC=$GMP_CC and CFLAGS=$GMP_CFLAGS)
      echo "int main (void) { return 0; }" > conftest.c
      if $GMP_CC $GMP_CFLAGS -o conftest conftest.c 2> /dev/null ; then
         AC_MSG_RESULT(yes)
         CC=$GMP_CC
         CFLAGS=$GMP_CFLAGS
      else
         AC_MSG_RESULT(no)

It brings things a bit closer to mpfr and adds `$CPP` to the list of possible
preprocessors.

If yes, I can push it to the mpc trunk.

Thanks in advance,

Andreas

Replied off-trac:

```
...
Should work for me (will test later),
but $cpp should be quoted in 'case $cpp in ...',
and $CPP in the 'for' statement.

You could also go with

    for cpp in "$CPP" cpp "gcc -E" /lib/cpp "cc -E" "c99 -E"

and drop adding '-E' below.
...
```

<a id='comment:24'>Comment 24:</a>
The GMP `CC` / `CFLAGS` issue with `cpp` (or rather `CPPFLAGS` not working with the ones from the list) is now [fixed upstream](https://gforge.inria.fr/scm/viewvc.php?view=rev&root=mpc&revision=1451) (MPC 1.1 branch); cf. [https://gforge.inria.fr/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=17410&group_id=131&atid=607](https://gforge.inria.fr/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=17410&group_id=131&atid=607).

I'll perhaps open a follow-up ticket including that upstream patch, but it's a minor issue anyway (which apparently only hits *me* on occasion).
