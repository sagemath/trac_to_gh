Similar to #16583, we should fix the declarations for `mpz_t` (and related types). This also involves fixing:
* various bad usages of `mpz_t` (it was `ctypedef`'ed as `void*`, meaning you could do with it what you wanted and Cython wouldn't complain)
* changing many functions to pass an `mpz_t` instead of an `mpz_t*`. For example the NTL interface functions `mpz_to_ZZ` and `ZZ_to_mpz` and the `pow_computer` functions from p-adics.
