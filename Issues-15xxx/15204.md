I suspected that this is related to the observed test failure on eno/skynet (#15440) but it is actually not. But its better than what we have so we should ship it.

Haven't been active in sage for a bit. I needed to back off a little bit. I have to agree that looks much nicer and you added a nice looking doctest.

The patch to use ecl_set_option looks good, but the doctest patch looks very wrong : it doesn't check that ECL-in-sage doesn't use SIGCHLD, but rather that SIGCHLD isn't used at all!

I don't understand what you are trying to say. It tests both that neither Sage nor ECL set a SIGCHLD handler, i.e. that it remains NULL.
