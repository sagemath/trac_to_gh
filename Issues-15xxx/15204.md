Current gap expects a particular method of `_n()` which is provided by `CyclotomicField` but not by others, in particular `UniversalCyclotomicField`. 

```
sage: libgap.E(3).sage(ring=UniversalCyclotomicField())
AttributeError: 'UniversalCyclotomicField_with_category' object has no attribute '_n'
```
This ticket fixes this by catching this exception and converting through the `CyclotomicField`.

Hello Travis :)

Now that we are trusted again, I am afraid there is no longer any patchbot around for the mercurial tickets. At least the only active one (except my own one) seems to work only on git tickets.

I will try to find time to run my patchbot on this ticket. It takes me around 90m per ticket... Maybe you could run a patchbot too ?

Frederic
