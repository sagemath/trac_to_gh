The `class Sequence` is difficult to place in the categories, as the discussion in this ticket shows. Rather, it has its place as programming utility, probably in `misc`. Thus, it needs not have a parent nor a category, nor mathematical operations like +, ... This ticket will deprecate/remove the corresponding methods.

Previous description:

The **category `Sequence`** is deprecated since 2009 (commit `619aa0fa`). If I understand it correctly, the **class `Sequence`** should instead have a parent from the category `Sets`.

The ticket that will remove category `Sequence` depends on this.

<a id='comment:4'></a>While having the category of sequences also being the parent is a definite abuse IMO, I don't like the proposed change since:

- it returns a class rather than an instance, and
- it isn't a container for only finite sequences.

So I would rather see a new class as you propose here with this ticket. Let's do things properly, and the parent shouldn't be too big or complicated either. This parent will also be in the category of `Sets` or `InfiniteEnumeratedSets` depending on if the base object is enumerable or not.

Also what's the ticket that removes the `Sequences` category? I'd almost say do that here as well.

In my understanding a sequence is always enumerable, it may not be finite, or it may not be mutable. The present `class Sequence` is finite and can optionally be immutable so the right category would be `FiniteEnumeratedSets` instead of `Sets`.

Yes the infinite version is desirable but please not in this ticket, too.

<a id='comment:9'></a>Let's have another attempt at this.

A string (or word) over Σ is any finite sequence of symbols from Σ (which is finite too). The set of all finite strings over some fixed alphabet Σ forms a monoid with string concatenation as the operation. This monoid is denoted Σ∗ and is called the free monoid over Σ. (Taken from Wikipedia)

That this is not far off is seen in `combinat/words/word.py`. So it seems that the set of finite sequences over finite sets is a monoid, and this is at least more specialized than a set.

Are there monoids with an infinite number of generators?

<a id='comment:14'></a>I am finally looking at this ticket. Thanks for taking care of long deprecated stuff!

The documentation of `Sequence` states «A mutable list of elements with a common guaranteed universe, which can be set immutable».

I interpret that as a data structure for an homogeneous collection of objects, homogeneous in that they share a common universe. This sounds much more like a programming utility than a model for a mathematical concept.

So I would tend to not try imposing a mathematical structure onto it: a sequence needs not have a parent nor a category, nor mathematical operations like +, ... Let's indeed deprecate/remove the corresponding methods.

On the other hand, one could triple check that `Sequence` fits nicely in Python's collection Abstract Base Classes [1]. This is a good start:

```
sage: S = Sequence([QQ, RR])
sage: isinstance(S, collections.MutableSequence)
True
```
There would remain to check that all methods indeed fit the specifications.

Cheers,
                                       Nicolas

<a id='comment:19'></a>Hi,

In a recent discussion where we were trying to clarify the role of the various Sage modules, we kind of converged toward the following:

```
- Sage-agnostic data structure -> sage.misc
- Specific purpose data structure (e.g. graph backend) -> sage.graph
- Data structure that inherits from, e.g., Element -> sage.structure
```

Here sequence does not inherit from Element/Parent/..., but it's directly tied to those. So `sage.structure` sound like a reasonable spot for Sequence.

Failed example:
