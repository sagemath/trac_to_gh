Sage's elliptic_j function does not behave similarly to the other standard or special functions: it tries to numerically evaluate instead of building a symbolic expression:

```
sage: elliptic_j(I)
1728.00000000000
sage: elliptic_j(x)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
...
TypeError: Cannot evaluate symbolic expression to a numeric value.
```

This is very weird: it means, for example, that plot(real(elliptic_j(x+I)), (x,0,1)) will fail (instead, one must use plot(lambda t: real(elliptic_j(t+I)), (0,1)))
