Singular fails with the most recent version of Xcode (downloaded 12 March 2014), with the error

```
ld: symbol dyld_stub_binding_helper not found, normally in crt1.o/dylib1.o/bundle1.o for architecture x86_64
fatal error: libtool: internal link edit command failed
```
One fix is to remove the line

```
export MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.4
```
from `spkg-install`, and use the value of `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` from `sage-env`. This needs testing on a variety of OS X machines.

you need to bump the version to force a recompilation. No need to bump it if it fixes a problem building on a particular architecture as you wouldn't have been able to build that version on that computer previously.

Why do we set `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` at all, isn't that only required for building portable binaries (i.e. if SAGE_FAT_BINARY=yes`)? 

We don't have a 10.4 buildbot at this point (Jeroen's box doesn't have git).

The tarball includes git but the buildbot uses git directly to get the sources and changesets. So it is a requirement for running the buildbot slave.

> Please do; I think that 10.5 definitely is still in some pipelines.  I am going to try this on my computer but it will take some time to get going with it because I haven't tried to use git, or even compile Sage on it since 5.10.

Since all I had to do was remove those two lines in a file already accessible in the tarball (I have to say, that new directory layout makes it easier to do that) I just changed that.  I'm having some unrelated issues making (checksum issue for bzip2) but hopefully eventually that will be resolved.
