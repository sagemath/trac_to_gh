Singular fails with the most recent version of Xcode (downloaded 12 March 2014), with the error

```
ld: symbol dyld_stub_binding_helper not found, normally in crt1.o/dylib1.o/bundle1.o for architecture x86_64
fatal error: libtool: internal link edit command failed
```
One fix is to remove the line

```
export MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.4
```
from `spkg-install`, and use the value of `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` from `sage-env`. This needs testing on a variety of OS X machines.

By the way, do I need to bump the package version number if I'm only changing `spkg-install`?

you need to bump the version to force a recompilation. No need to bump it if it fixes a problem building on a particular architecture as you wouldn't have been able to build that version on that computer previously.

Why do we set `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` at all, isn't that only required for building portable binaries (i.e. if SAGE_FAT_BINARY=yes`)? 

We don't have a 10.4 buildbot at this point (Jeroen's box doesn't have git).
