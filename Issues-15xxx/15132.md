It seemed to me yesterday that all the examples were present in some form in the other files. You can run something like

```
$ cd SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/sage/matrix
$ grep -C10 'def __copy__' *.py*
```
to see some of the doctests. The last test in the `copy()` method is actually a bit strange and so I have copied that code into the `matrix_generic_dense.pyx` file. The [attachment:trac_15132-remove_matrix_copy.patch patch] has been accordingly updated.
