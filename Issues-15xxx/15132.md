Yes, this is probably a good idea at this point!  I'll try to run this - I had troubled upgrading so I'll need to do a new version of Sage.  Patchbot seems to not be saying anything yet.

It seemed to me yesterday that all the examples were present in some form in the other files. You can run something like

```
$ cd SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/sage/matrix
$ grep -C10 'def __copy__' *.py*
```
to see some of the doctests. The last test in the `copy()` method is actually a bit strange and so I have copied that code into the `matrix_generic_dense.pyx` file. The [patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket15132/trac_15132-remove_matrix_copy.patch.gz) has been accordingly updated.
