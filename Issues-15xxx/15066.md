Apparently pymongo uses a getattr hack that claims to have all and every method implemented, and then fails flat on its face when you actually try. This breaks the new displayhook.

Note that this error will just appear if you (implicitly) call the displayhook. Pymongo is working just fine, only the implicit printing is broken:

You get it like this:

```
sage -sh
<different prompt> easy_install -U pymongo
(exit)
```

I am using it for a project which uses Sage as a backend to a big number theory database, see http://www.lmfdb.org/ and the readme at https://github.com/LMFDB/lmfdb/wiki/GettingGoing .
