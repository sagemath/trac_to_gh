Currently IntegerVectors_nk inherits the generic `rank()` implementation for its parent; it's a very generic method that generates all its members and checks for equality. I needed a faster implementation in my code, so I wrote a specialized version that uses an ad-hoc algorithm (nothing fancy, essentially it's just adding up a bunch of binomials).

I plan to upload the code using git and the standard dev tools. I'm a new contributor, so it could take me a while to set everything up and commit code -- I am currently in the process of building a dev version for the first time.

Hellooooooooooooooo Federico !

Well, I don't know what you went through, but the patch looks nice in the end `;-)`

It's a cool improvement, and it is well documented and tested. I have only one thing to add :

```
sage: IV = IntegerVectors(4,5) 
sage: IV.rank((0,0,4,0,0)) 
55
sage: IV.rank((0,1,-1,4,0))
55
```

That's because you check manually whether the given vector belongs to `IV` instead of using the `__contains__` method, i.e. `x in self`.

The problem with this `x in self` is that it also computes the sum of the vector, and that you will compute it a second time in your function because you need it too. But that may not be soooo troublesome anyway, it's not that costly. Especially compared with the current implementation.

Could you fix that ? Also, could you replace 
<code>- \`\`x\`\` - any sequence with sum(x) == n and len(x) == k</code> i
n the docstring with that ?
<code>- \`\`x\`\` - any sequence with \`\`sum(x) == n\`\` and \`\`len(x) == k\`\`</code>

This way it will all appear properly in the html documentation. Which you can obtain with `sage -b && sage -docbuild reference/combinat html`

Thanks !

Nathann

Thanks for taking a look at the patch. You are correct about the negative entries, good catch; I'll fix it.

Actually there is another point I was considering. The members of `IntegerVectors` are lists; what should we do when another sequence type such a tuple is passed to `rank()`?

The implementation in the current patch returns the same result for any sequence type, however using `__contains__` would require them to be lists or else it would throw an error.

`Combinations.rank()` throws `TypeError` when passed a tuple; `Derangements.rank()` returns nothing (no error thrown).

This is an issue of strict type correctness vs. user convenience. For instance, you inadvertently used a tuple in your example in the previous comment. `:)`
It is ultimately a developer decision; please let me know what I should return in case a tuple is entered and I shall code it.

Hmmmmmmm....

Well, I think that it would make sense anyway to only return the rank of objects on which `__contains__` return True. But indeed tuples make sense too. Well, why don't we also allow tuples in `__contains__` ? It doesn't look that crazy `:-)`

> `Combinations.rank()` throws `TypeError` when passed a tuple; `Derangements.rank()` returns nothing (no error thrown).

I hate this code. This has to be *FIXED*. I will create a ticket for that and add you in Cc (it should only take a couple of seconds to review).

What has to be known about this code is that it is inconsistent in many places, and that we should never feel forced to respect what is done elsewhere, for I learned it was mistakes most of the time `:-P`

I think rank should throw a `ValueError` when `__contains__` returns `False` on the input. What's your opinion ? Returning nothing is just plain bad programming.

> This is an issue of strict type correctness vs. user convenience. For instance, you inadvertently used a tuple in your example in the previous comment. `:)`

Well, I really feel that what should be called there is `__contains__`, and that we should play with what `__contains__` allow if it is not convenient. But let's be consistent with ourselves for a start.

Please code it this way only if it makes sense to you. Otherwise let's talk about it. And I will write this quick patch for the other problem you found.

Have fuuuuuuuuuuuuun !

I asked a question on sage-combinat-devel about this .rank function that returns nothing.

Turns out it is a deliberate choice.

I agree with you on all respects (except maybe that I think that for most sequences the generic inherited `rank` implementation is still better than no implementation, but that's a minor unrelated issue).
"Return NULL or raise an exception on failure" is an old programming style debate, but I agree that it should be more Pythonic to raise an exception.

As for the choice of sequences, also in my view it would be good not to force a specific one on the user, at least in methods that take them as inputs, but that's a different and broader issue.

Anyway, I have applied your suggested changes (testing for membership with `x in self`, and that formatting correction in the docs).
