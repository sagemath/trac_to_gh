I propose a method to create (unlabelled) trees conveniently.

One enters a sequence of hexadecimal numbers, and this is converted into a rooted tree.

Hey Frederic,

Could you move `from_hexcode` to `AbstractTree` so the `parent` arg becomes `self`? IMO this way it is more discoverable and OOP.

Also (more of a pet-peeve of mine, so you can ignore this), I don't like `else:` statements following

```
if condition:
    ...
    return foo
```
(or an sequence of `elif`'s) since it is unnecessary indentation.

Thanks,

Travis

Humm, this does not seem possible, because there is no class AbstractTrees (with an s at the end)

Indeed, it does not seem reasonable to put that into the class AbstractTree, because it would mean one has to build a tree before one can build another one..

Ah, my bad. I thought there was a common parent class.

Looks good to me. Thanks.
