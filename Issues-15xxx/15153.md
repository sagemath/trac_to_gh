At the moment two toric varieties are taken to be equal if *their fans are the same, names of variables are the same and stored in the same order,          and base fields are the same*, independent of whether they have the same embedding morphism or not.

What does that imply? Since ToricDivisorGroup inherits from UniqueRepresentation, two toric varieties that only differ in their embedding will share the same ToricDivisorGroup object and therefore a ToricDivisor created by a variety will reference the variety that first created its ToricDivisorGroup object, independent of whether that's correct or not.

As a consequence, we have the following behavior:

```
sage: P2 = toric_varieties.P(2)
sage: variety1 = P2.affine_patch(2)
sage: variety2 = ToricVariety(variety1.fan())
sage: variety1 == variety2
True
sage: div1 = variety1.divisor(Cone([(1,0)]))
sage: div2 = variety2.divisor(Cone([(1,0)]))
sage: div1.scheme().embedding_morphism()
Scheme morphism:
  From: 2-d affine toric variety
  To:   2-d CPR-Fano toric variety covered by 3 affine patches
  Defn: Defined on coordinates by sending [z0 : z1] to
        [z0 : z1 : 1]
sage: div2.scheme().embedding_morphism() # should produce an exception
Scheme morphism:
  From: 2-d affine toric variety
  To:   2-d CPR-Fano toric variety covered by 3 affine patches
  Defn: Defined on coordinates by sending [z0 : z1] to
        [z0 : z1 : 1]
sage: div2.scheme() is variety2
False
sage: div2.scheme() is variety1
True
```
While this set-up might seem highly artificial, in the context of toric fibrations in #12892 one naturally gets fiber varieties that only differ in their embedding.

Unless there are arguments against it, I therefore suggest to extend `ToricVariety_field.__cmp__` to include the embedding morphism.

Depends on #12892

To always compare embeddings varieties without embedding should be aware of there existence, in which case it really seems to me that they are of the same class, but with different values of attributes.

Adjusting `_repr_` is a great idea!

An argument `embedding_morphism` in the constructor of `ToricVariety,CPRFanoToricVariety` and replace all accesses to `._embedding_morphism` by creating new varieties.\n2. A distinction between cases with and without embedding in `_repr_`.\n\nHowever, I am still not sure how to deal with the comparison of two varieties with embedding. I suppose one really only wants to morphisms to be equal if they have equal domains and codomains. As mentioned above, however, this leads to an infinite recursion loop. Should one implement some sort of comparison method for the morphisms that does not check equality of domains or is there another more elegant way around this problem?",

Okay, if I understand correctly, then regardless of how it is implemented, one would want to have
1. An argument `embedding_morphism` in the constructor of `ToricVariety,CPRFanoToricVariety` and replace all accesses to `._embedding_morphism` by creating new varieties.
2. A distinction between cases with and without embedding in `_repr_`.

However, I am still not sure how to deal with the comparison of two varieties with embedding. I suppose one really only wants to morphisms to be equal if they have equal domains and codomains. As mentioned above, however, this leads to an infinite recursion loop. Should one implement some sort of comparison method for the morphisms that does not check equality of domains or is there another more elegant way around this problem?

My problems with extra classes just for the sake of embedding:
* need to have these extra classes for every flavour (toric, affine toric, CPRFano, maybe others later) - not difficult, but annoying;
* anything that constructs a new toric variety should properly handle the class - of course, this may have to be done anyway to properly handle embedding attribute;
* more serious: comparison of varieties without embedding is unclear to me: if `X` is just a variety and `Y` is the same but embedded (and realized by an extra class), then `cmp(X, Y)` will call `X.__cmp__(Y)`. This should just compare varieties by themselves and they are equal. On the other hand `Y.__cmp__(X)` will take into account embeddings, so they are not equal, which is bad. To fix it, the first method already should be aware of the embedding and take it into account.

Note that `==` in general for toric framework means "Sage-equal" (and in fact should be the same as `is` if varieties are made unique). This more or less was how this ticket appeared - this sense is not handled correctly and it breaks technical things. If one wants more mathematical equality, probably the correct way is to call already existing (or not?-) `is_isomorphic`, which clearly should not take into account embedding.

A possible solution to recursion is to not call embedding comparison/equality in `__cmp__` of toric varieties, but rather check that domains/codomains are the same in our internal sense and then check the defining map of the embedding to be the same, i.e. its data apart from domain/codomain. This should make it possible to compare embedding morphisms directly too.

Maybe a couple of things right away:
- I couldn't figure out how to use super to initialize both `EmbeddedToricVariety_Mixin, ToricVariety_field` in the constructor of `ToricVarietyWithEmbedding_field` and analogously for the Fano case.
- Another problem with super: I could not replace `ToricVariety_field.__cmp__(self, right)` by some construction like `super(self.__class__, self)` in `EmbeddedToricVariety_Mixin` despite comments and help from Volker. (Apparently I don't properly understand how multiple inheritance works in python)
- variety.affine_patch(i) now returns patches whose embedding morphisms are given by Morphisms defined through FanMorphisms instead of polynomal ones, but one can of course get the old representation via `patch.embedding_morphism().as_polynomial_map()`

Also, the morphisms in #12892 will need to implement short `__cmp__` methods just as I did for the two morphism classes in the above patch.

Many thanks already!

Hi,

I've now included the toric morphisms introduced by #12892 and implemented comparison methods for them. I realize that my git usage wasn't that great - many commits and an unnecessary merge. Won't happen again!

I'd still appreciate comments on the patch.
