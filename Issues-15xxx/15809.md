After merging Simon's scripts into one script, they are turned into C code by `gp2c`, which is then compiled into the Sage <-> PARI library interface.

Using them is exactly the same as using other PARI functions:

```
sage: EllipticCurve("389a1")._pari_().ellrank()
[2, 2, [[1/16, -9/64], [5/4, 5/8]]]
```

The focus of this ticket is really on making a general mechanism, not so much on Simon's scripts (in particular, `simon_two_descent` has not been changed). It should be very easy to add new scripts in the future.
