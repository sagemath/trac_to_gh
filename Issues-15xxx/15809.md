After merging Simon's scripts into one script, they are turned into C code by `gp2c`, which is then compiled into the Sage <-> PARI library interface.

Using them is exactly the same as using other PARI functions:

```
sage: EllipticCurve("389a1")._pari_().ellrank()
[2, 2, [[1/16, -9/64], [5/4, 5/8]]]
```

The focus of this ticket is really on making a general mechanism, not so much on Simon's scripts (in particular, `simon_two_descent` has not been changed). It should be very easy to add new scripts in the future.

Obviously needs to be reworked insofar as how the build steps fit in, but looks like a good idea otherwise.  It would also be good to incorporate Tim Dokchitser's script `src/ext/pari/dokchitser/computel.gp`.  This would probably enable rewriting `sage.lfunctions.dokchitser` to use the pari interface instead of gp+pexpect; see #22718.

I might take a stab at this if Jeroen doesn't get a chance first.
