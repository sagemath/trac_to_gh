Yamanouchi Words

A right (respectively left) Yamanouchi word on a completely ordered
alphabet, for instance [1,2,...,n], is a word math such that any
right (respectively left) factor of math contains more entries math
than math. For example, the word [2, 3, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1] is
a right Yamanouchi one.

The evaluation of a word math encodes the number of occurrences of
each letter of math. In the case of Yamanouchi words, the
evaluation is a partition. For example, the word [2, 3, 2, 2, 1, 3,
1, 2, 1, 1] has evaluation [4, 4, 2].

Yamanouchi words can be useful in the computation of
Littlewood-Richardson coefficients `c_{\lambda, \mu}^\nu`.
According to the Littlewood-Richardson
rule, `c_{\lambda, \mu}^\nu` is the number of skew tableaux
of shape `\nu / \lambda` and evaluation `\mu`,
whose row readings are Yamanouchi words.

(added by #1685 but no code was ever written for that file)

The "math" looks like the text has been copypasted from some website; this is embarassing...

It looks like it was added in #1685 with no content, as if it was going to have code to be used in computing LR coefficients. I'm tempted to remove it as there currently is no code, but it would be nice to have a simple generator for all Yamanouchi words.

Nicolas, Anne, Darij, do any of you currently have code to generate Yamanouci words (without appealing to the crystals code)? I have an idea about how to do it and could whip something up in a few hours if you think it's worthwhile to have.
