Maxima fails to regard some expressions as equal:

```
sage: value_1 = 1-golden_ratio
sage: value_2 = -golden_ratio^(-1)
sage: bool(value_1 == value_2)
True
sage: bool(value_1^x != value_2^x)
True
```
while

```
sage: bool(((x+1)^2)^y == (x^2+2*x+1)^y)
True
sage: sin(0,hold=True)^x == 0^x
sin(0)^x == 0^x
sage: bool(sin(0,hold=True)^x == 0^x)
True
```

Previous description:

I tried to define Fibonacci sequence using golden ratio in two ways, using values:

```
sage: value_1 = 1-golden_ratio
sage: value_2 = -golden_ratio^(-1)
sage: bool(value_1 == value_2)
true
```
(gives true, so two definitions, F1 and F2 below should be equal, even though they are not according to Sage)

```
sage: F1(k) = (golden_ratio^k-(value_1)^(k))/sqrt(5)
sage: F2(k) = (golden_ratio^k-(value_2)^(k))/sqrt(5)
sage: bool(F1(k) != F2(k))
true
```
When simplified everything seems to be equal at least for first 10 or 1000 elements:

```
sage: [(F1(j)-F2(j)).full_simplify() for j in range(10)]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```

Anyway, now to the error: limit for F1 gives wrong result:

```
sage: limit(F1(k+1)/F1(k), k=oo)
0
```
and for F2 works OK:

```
sage: limit(F2(k+1)/F2(k), k=oo)
1/2*sqrt(5) + 1/2
```

I've tested it with Sage 5.12 and 5.11, with same result. This can be as simple as some thing with how golden ratio is handled, or something far more involved maybe?

I don't know when it happened, but in 6.4.1 the limit works:

```
sage: limit(F1(k+1)/F1(k), k=oo)
1/2*sqrt(5) + 1/2
```

but the comparison

```
sage: F1(k) = (golden_ratio^k-(value_1)^(k))/sqrt(5)
sage: F2(k) = (golden_ratio^k-(value_2)^(k))/sqrt(5)
sage: bool(F1(k) != F2(k))
true
```

is still wrong. Slightly minified example:

```
sage: value_1 = 1-golden_ratio
sage: value_2 = -golden_ratio^(-1)
sage: bool(value_1 == value_2)
True
sage: bool(value_1^x != value_2^x)
True
```
