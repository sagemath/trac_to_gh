Just found this while experimenting with my own semirings:

```
sage: T = TropicalSemiring(QQ)       
sage: T.infinity() ** 2
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-28-b94a4a077331> in <module>()
----> 1 T.infinity() ** Integer(2)

TypeError: unsupported operand parent(s) for '*': 'Integer Ring' and '<type 'NoneType'>'
```

Here is a way to solve this (sage/rings/semirings/tropical_semiring.pyx):

```
    def __pow__(base, exp, dummy):
        """
        Return ``self`` to ``exp``.

        EXAMPLES::

            sage: T = TropicalSemiring(QQ)
            sage: elt = T(2)
            sage: elt**3
            6
            sage: elt**-2
            -4
            sage: elt**(3/7)
            6/7
            sage: elt**0
            0

            sage: elt = T.infinity()
            sage: elt**0
            0
            sage: elt**(1/2)
            +infinity
            sage: elt*33
            +infinity
        """
        cdef TropicalSemiringElement self, x
        self = base
        if self._val is None:
            if exp > 0:
                return self
            elif exp == 0:
                return self.parent().one()
            raise ZeroDivisionError("Tropical division by infinity")
        x = self._new()
        x._val = exp*self._val
        return x
```

Is this good? (I cannot upload branches from here -- "fatal: remote error: access denied or repository not exported: /sage.git")

Something weird is happening: the branch shows as already merged?

Anyway, the branches public/combinat/15822 and public/combinat/15822new are identical and both contain the fix I proposed + a few minor edits to the docstring. If you can give them a pos_rev that'd be great!
