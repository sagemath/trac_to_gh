For some reason, i get a segfault when i try to system-wide graphviz from sage, and the current experimental spkg fails to install, so i updated it. It now installs on my systems and works ok.

<a id='comment:2'></a>Hello !

Well, the spkg works (even though I expected it to be a bzip2 file instead of a gzip file), but how exactly can this spkg be used through  Sage so that I may test it ?

It creates a text file called output, and tries to call "dot" on it. But it fails, and creates an empty file output.jpg

With this new version, it creates the file output.jpg as expected.

Once you have the file output created, you can try to call dot manually on it:

```
$ sage -sh

Starting subshell with Sage environment variables set.  Don't forget
to exit when you are done.  Beware:
 * Do not do anything with other copies of Sage on your system.
 * Do not use this for installing Sage packages using "sage -i" or for
   running "make" at Sage's root directory.  These should be done
   outside the Sage shell.

Bypassing shell configuration files...

Note: SAGE_ROOT=/home/mmarco/sagedevel/sage
(sage-sh) mmarco@localhost:sage$ dot -Tjpg output -o output.jpg
segmentation fault
```


But with the spkg installed, it just creates the output.jpg file as expected.
