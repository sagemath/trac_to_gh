REFEREE:

- this branch is a mess, including stuff involving deleting info.plists and stuff.  Make a completely new clean branch.

- The complicated-looking algorithm that I had implemented, which this patch deletes, is very, very efficient.  Since it is correct in the case when they're coprime, keep it in that case, and only use your (probably very) slow algorithm in the other case.  And put a note in that the other one might be slow (or is slow -- based on a benchmark with big p,e)... and somebody will make it fast someday.
