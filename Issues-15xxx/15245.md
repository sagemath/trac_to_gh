I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw we don't have the Pfaffian implemented in Sage.

Attached is an implementation that computes it over any ring in the combinatorial way using perfect matchings. This is probably not an optimal algorithm (and I feel like a lot could already be gained by improving up the PerfectMatchings(n) iterator without even changing the algorithm) but it's enough for my combinatorial needs.

Other than this, the patch makes perfect matchings iterable (no, they weren't) and improves some docstrings related to rook polynomials. The #14117 dependency is because both patches edit matrix2.py and would probably cause some fuzz.

Hey Darij,

A few things I'd like to see changed:

- Could you call `self.is_skew_symmetric()` instead of implementing your own test?
- Instead of doing things such as `3x3` in the examples block, could you put it in full latex <code>\`3 \times 3\`</code>?
- For the `algorithm` input, I'd rather see something like

```
- ``algorithm`` -- string, the algorithm to use; currently the following
  algorithms have been implemented:

  * ``'definition'`` - using the definition given by perfect matchings
```
  or a variant with a better name for the algorithm.

Also since this file is so big and often subject to changes, it would be better to not include as many whitespace changes.

Thanks,

Travis

Hi Travis,

thanks once again for the reviews! I fixed all of your issues apart from not using `is_skew_symmetric()` because that method doesn't check diagonal entries to be 0 (it only checks them to satisfy x = -x, which is not the same in characteristic 2):

```
sage: M = Matrix(Zmod(2), [[0,1],[1,1]])
sage: M.is_skew_symmetric()
True
```
If you ask me, this is a bug, but I don't want to grasp into yet another hornet's nest. But thanks for having me look at my check code again; it contained an ugly indentation error...

I was pretty sure that matrix algorithms are the least busy part of the code, given how long #14117 took to be reviewed. In hindsight I shouldn't have done unrelated docstring fixes, but the rook stuff was just pretty close and caught my eyes.

Best regards,

Darij

I think that's the definition of skew symmetric/antisymmetric: that A<sup>T</sup>=-A. It just happens to be the case that the concepts "symmetric" and "antisymmetric" coincide in characteristic 2.

In other words: skew symmetric matrices don't have to have 0 on their diagonal. Note that the terminology comes from bilinear forms, where alternating means (v,v)=0, antisymmetric means (v,w)=-(w,v) and symmetric means (v,w)=(w,v). "alternating" is not "antisymmetric" in characteristic 2.

Hey Darij,

Sorry for letting this slip away.

For the skew-symmetric, how about instead calling `is_skew_symmetric()` and then checking that the diagonal entries are 0 with

```
all(d == 0 for d in self.diagonal())
```
One more minor thing: the `AUTHORS:` block shouldn't be indented.

Best,

Travis

If that matters people can always implement both.

uh ...

```
sage: GF(2).characteristic() !=2
False
sage: ZZ.characteristic() != 2
True

No, that's not the correct check. In ZZ and (ZZ/6ZZ), 2 is not invertible and yet skew symmetric is the same as alternating.

You could check whether 1+1==0, but that's more expensive.
