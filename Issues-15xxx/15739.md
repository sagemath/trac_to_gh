So we don't get behavior like this:

```
sage: d = DynkinDiagram(['B',3])
sage: d.edges()
[(1, 2, 1), (2, 1, 1), (2, 3, 2), (3, 2, 1)]
sage: d
O---O=>=O
1   2   3
B3
sage: d.delete_edge(1,2)
sage: d.edges()
[(2, 1, 1), (2, 3, 2), (3, 2, 1)]
sage: d    # This iswrong
O---O=>=O
1   2   3
B3
sage: CartanMatrix(d)   # So is this
[ 2 -1  0]
[ 0  2 -1]
[ 0 -2  2]
```
