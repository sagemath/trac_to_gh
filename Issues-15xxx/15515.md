The function `graphics_filename()` in `sage/misc/temporary_file.py` was created for the notebook. When used in other places, it is unsafe (race condition + creates predicatable filenames) and can clutter the current working directory with files. Therefore, we should use `tmp_filename()` in `graphics_filename()` except when `EMBEDDED_MODE` is `True`. This also simplifies the logic in various `show()` methods.

Rebased this. Funny, I was coding something along the same lines at the moment, before [#16533 comment:34](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/16533#comment:34) made me aware of this ticket here.

[My own modifications](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commits/u/gagern/feature/graphics_filename-passthrough) (which I have just modified to build on this here) also move some other tasks into that function, namely passing a caller-provided filename back (either unaltered or with added suffix) unless it is `None`. That way, one can simply do `graphics_filename(filename=filename)` without worrying whether the user specified a file name or not.

But since I might end up reviewing your commit, I probably should file my own as a separate ticket… I haven't looked at *all* your modifications yet, but I notice that [code in plot3d/base.pyx](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/blob/develop/src/sage/plot/plot3d/base.pyx?id=6.3.beta1#n1131) is still pretty broken with regard to `graphics_filename`: they call it to generate some name, then strip the original extension and add an assortment of other extensions. That's just asking for a name clash. And if `SAGE_TMP` would happen to be world writable (although I can't imagine how that might be), then a security relevant race condition would be very likely.

If I were to fix this, I would be using my own code for this. Jeroen, could we review one another's code for this?

I guess I'd also like to use this function (with my own additions) all over the place for animations. Doing that would fix #16608 as well, would be a useful basis for my next stab at #16533, and would make [005b83f](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/005b83f2379d786b88f9a6b194dd334c038ea8ca) from #16571 superfluous as well.
