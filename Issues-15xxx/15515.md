The function `graphics_filename()` in `sage/misc/temporary_file.py` was created for the notebook. When used in other places, it is unsafe (race condition + creates predicatable filenames) and can clutter the current working directory with files. Therefore, we should use `tmp_filename()` in `graphics_filename()` except when `EMBEDDED_MODE` is `True`. This also simplifies the logic in various `show()` methods.

That's just asking for a name clash. And if `SAGE_TMP` would happen to be world writable (although I can't imagine how that might be), then a security relevant race condition would be very likely.\n\nIf I were to fix this, I would be using my own code for this. Jeroen, could we review one another's code for this?\n\nI guess I'd also like to use this function (with my own additions) all over the place for animations. Doing that would fix #16608 as well, would be a useful basis for my next stab at #16533, and would make [005b83f](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/005b83f2379d786b88f9a6b194dd334c038ea8ca) from #16571 superfluous as well.\n\n---\nNew commits:\n|                                                                                                                                          |                                                                    |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|[b3e656b](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/b3e656b4507d9f6544e87641614836dc6275e929)|`graphics_filename: return a tmp_filename() if not in EMBEDDED_MODE`|",

Rebased this. Funny, I was coding something along the same lines at the moment, before[comment:34](#comment%3A34):ticket:16533 made me aware of this ticket here.

[My own modifications](http://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/log/?h=u/gagern/feature/graphics_filename-passthrough) (which I have just modified to build on this here) also move some other tasks into that function, namely passing a caller-provided filename back (either unaltered or with added suffix) unless it is `None`. That way, one can simply do `graphics_filename(filename=filename)` without worrying whether the user specified a file name or not.

But since I might end up reviewing your commit, I probably should file my own as a separate ticket… I haven't looked at *all* your modifications yet, but I notice that [code in plot3d/base.pyx](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/blob/master/src/sage/plot/plot3d/base.pyx?id=6.3.beta1#n1131) is still pretty broken with regard to `graphics_filename`: they call it to generate some name, then strip the original extension and add an assortment of other extensions. That's just asking for a name clash. And if `SAGE_TMP` would happen to be world writable (although I can't imagine how that might be), then a security relevant race condition would be very likely.

If I were to fix this, I would be using my own code for this. Jeroen, could we review one another's code for this?

I guess I'd also like to use this function (with my own additions) all over the place for animations. Doing that would fix #16608 as well, would be a useful basis for my next stab at #16533, and would make [005b83f](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/005b83f2379d786b88f9a6b194dd334c038ea8ca) from #16571 superfluous as well.
