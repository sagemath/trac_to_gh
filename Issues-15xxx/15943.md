Apparently you need to use git 
"the hard way" to let your local branch be pushed to a public branch on 
trac, and then you have to manually edit the branch field on trac to 
point to the public branch. 

I keep forgetting how to do this. Hence, I'd very much appreciate if someone 
could implement something like 

```
  sage -dev push --ticket=12345 --remote_branch=public/foo/bar 
```
to push to the specified public branch, and (as a convenience) update 
the information on the local branch, such that subsequently 

```
  sage -dev push 
and 
  git push 
```
will both push to the previously indicated public trac branch. 

And similarly, if the user has write permission to the branch (e.g., 
public branch) attached to a ticket, then 

```
  sage -dev push
```
should push *there* (and not to a new branch u/UserName/...).

This is no longer a problem. Just use `git trac`.
