Branching rules for Lie groups are mostly already implemented in `weyl_characters`. That is, if G is a Lie group and H a subgroup (maximal without loss of generality) we can compute the branching rule from `G => H` in most cases, always if G is of classical type, and sometimes if G is an exceptional group.

Before the patch, the following rules are not implemented. 

```
E6 => C4 , A2 , G2 , A2xG2
E7 => A2 , A1 , A1 , A1xF4 , G2xC3 , A1xG2 , A1xA1
E8 => G2xF4 , C2 , A1xA2 , A1 , A1 , A1
F4 => A1 , A1xG2
G2 => A1
```

With the patch, ALL of these are now implemented in Sage. After the patch, every
branching rule in the tables of McKay and Patera (Tables of dimensions, indices and branching rules for representations of simple Lie algebras) is available in Sage!

Here is a file that constructs the branching rule for every maximal subgroup of every simple Lie group of rank less than or equal to 8. This includes every case considered by McKay and Patera, and every exceptional group.

http://sporadic.stanford.edu/bump/branch-table.sage

The embeddings are described in the thematic tutorial. I've posted a copy of the patched tutorial and reference manual on sporadic.stanford.edu. The relevant sections are here:

http://sporadic.stanford.edu/thematic_tutorials/lie/branching_rules.html

http://sporadic.stanford.edu/reference/combinat/sage/combinat/root_system/weyl_characters.html

http://sporadic.stanford.edu/reference/combinat/sage/combinat/root_system/branching_rules.html

The patch makes a class BranchingRule for branching rules. Notable methods are a multiplication corresponding to composition, and a `describe()` method for branching rules which shows how simple roots and the affine root restrict. The multiplication gives a better method of concatenating branching rules. A projection method for composite types is given. The goals set out in Comment 6 are all achieved. The thematic tutorial is revised.

Since weyl_characters.py was getting huge, I split it, moving the branching rule material into a new file, branching_rules.py.

<a id='comment:6'>Comment 6:</a>
The principal changes for this ticket are listed above. This comment contains a list of other less important changes.

In both the thematic tutorial and the docstring, hand written rules are discussed. It is omitted to say that the rule should map the positive Weyl chamber into the positive Weyl chamber. The doc should be revised on this point. (It is not *necessary* for the rule to map dominant weights into the positive Weyl chamber but it is desirable.)

In thematic tutorial and docstring, we should explain how to branch `B_r => D_r` and `D_r => B_{r-1`}. This should
go in the section orthogonal-and-symplectic-subgroups-of-orthogonal-and-symplectic-groups of the thematic tutorial.
The r=4 case should be used as an example.

Some doctests in weyl_characters are marked "long time" with obsolete timing information. For example the doctest [F4(fw).branch(B3,rule="levi") for fw in F4.fundamental_weights()] is given with the timing information 36s. This takes less than a second on my laptop. These misleading timings should be removed.

Branching (rule="levi") from E6 to A5 currently returns an error message, but this branching rule should be implemented.

Branching from composite type needs work: for example, branching from AxB to A or B should be implemented.

-The patch makes a class BranchingRule for branching rules. Notable methods are a multiplication corresponding to composition, and a `describe()` method for branching rules which shows how simple roots and the affine root restrict. The multiplication gives a better method of concatenating branching rules. A projection method for composite types is given. The goals set out in Comment 6 are all achieved except for the one about the Levi branching rule `E6 => A5`. However the patch makes this easy to implement as follows:
-`branching_rule("E6","A5xA1",rule="extended")*branching_rule("A5xA1","A5","proj1")`

 The embeddings are described in the thematic tutorial. I've posted a copy of the patched tutorial and reference manual on sporadic.stanford.edu. The relevant sections are here:

 The patch makes a class BranchingRule for branching rules. Notable methods are a multiplication corresponding to composition, and a `describe()` method for branching rules which shows how simple roots and the affine root restrict. The multiplication gives a better method of concatenating branching rules. A projection method for composite types is given. The goals set out in Comment 6 are all achieved. The thematic tutorial is revised.

Is there an easy way to apply a `BranchingRule` to a representation (i.e. a `WeylCharacterRing.element_class`)? This seems like it would be one of the most common use cases:

```
sage: rule = branching_rule("A3", "C2", "symmetric")
sage: rep = WeylCharacterRing("A3")(1,0,0,0)
sage: rule.branch(rep)   # does not exist
sage: rep.branch(rule)   # does not work
sage: rule(rep)          # somewhat unexpected result
[0, 0]
```
The only thing I can come up with is the slightly awkward

```
sage: rep.branch(WeylCharacterRing(rule.Stype()), rule=rule)
C2(1,0)
```
The `BranchingRule.__call__` could check for the parent of the argument and simply return the branched representation.

Hopefully all branching rules to maximal subgroups are either implemented or
constructable as plethysms, but branching to a nonmaximal Levi may or may not
be implemented. For example, one of the G2 Levi's is implemented, the other not.
(Neither Levi is a maximal subgroup.)

I'll have to correct the documentation per your comment.

You do need to construct the `WeylCharacterRing` you are branching to. The following works.

```
sage: br = branching_rule("A3", "C2", "symmetric")
sage: [A3,C2] = [WeylCharacterRing(x,style="coroots") for x in ["A3","C2"]]
sage: rep=A3(1,0,0,0); rep
A3(1,0,0)
sage: rep.branch(C2, rule=br)
C2(1,0)
```

> sage: rule.branch(rep)   # does not exist

It does seem like an excellent idea for `branch` to also be a method of the branching rule and I'll try to implement that.
