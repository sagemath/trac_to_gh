I just see that there are more problems in the file code_bounds.py. For instance, something like `codesize_upper_bound(10,1,2)` raises an error because it looks for the minimum of the various bounds, but some of them (plotkin, elias) are not defined for these parameters. I think if `elias/plotkin_upper_bound(n, q, d)` isn't defined, it should return a trivial bound like `q^n` instead of an error.

Furthermore, is `RR(fact)==RR(int(fact))` the right way to check if the rational number `fact` is an integer?

While these things, like the original mistake in the `elias_upper_bound`, are easy to fix, I'm a little concerned with the order of arguments. Is there any reason to have for instance `hamming_upper_bound(n, q, d)`, but `q` and `d` switched in `delsarte_bound_hamming_space(n, d, q)` and `codesize_upper_bound(n, d, q)`?

In my opinion that's a perfect and unnecessary source for producing errors. However, making things consistent would break compatibility, so maybe the only way out is to keep the present functions, and use new names for those with consistent argument orders.

I prefer a true but trivial bound instead, so that one does not have to care about an allowed choice of parameters.

For `codesize_upper_bound`, I think it would be fine to return a trivial bound that should be valid in all ranges of the minimum distance. But not for the specific bounds such as `elias` or `plotkin` - those are really *undefined* for certain ranges of parameters.

In fact, the Elias bound should be valid till `d <= (q-1)/q * n`. The Plotkin should then take over from there since it needs `d > (q-1)/q * n`. So, there shouldn't be any range for which the trivial bound `q^n` is required. If it is being required, then the bounds need to be fixed.

Well, one way is to keep the current commands and put some warnings. Your suggestion however seems good. We can name some new functions and deprecate the old functions. The old functions can be removed after the deprecation period is over.
