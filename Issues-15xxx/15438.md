I think it should raise a `ValueError` instead. A trivial bound would give the incorrect impression that the bound is well defined for those parameters.

I agree that that is a really bad way to check for an integer. It should be `isinstance(fact, (ZZ, int, long))`.

I think the order of those commands should be fixed once and for all. And a `warning` printed for a year (that is the usual period for deprecation, but we can't deprecate anything here).

I prefer a true but trivial bound instead, so that one does not have to care about an allowed choice of parameters.

For `codesize_upper_bound`, I think it would be fine to return a trivial bound that should be valid in all ranges of the minimum distance. But not for the specific bounds such as `elias` or `plotkin` - those are really *undefined* for certain ranges of parameters.

In fact, the Elias bound should be valid till `d <= (q-1)/q * n`. The Plotkin should then take over from there since it needs `d > (q-1)/q * n`. So, there shouldn't be any range for which the trivial bound `q^n` is required. If it is being required, then the bounds need to be fixed.

Well, one way is to keep the current commands and put some warnings. Your suggestion however seems good. We can name some new functions and deprecate the old functions. The old functions can be removed after the deprecation period is over.
