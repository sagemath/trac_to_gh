This patch will implement two improvements to the k-Schur functions at t=1.  The first is a change to `_to_schur_on_basis` and the second is a change to how the product is calculated.  Both will improve the algorithm for doing these calculations by factoring out k-rectangles which are known to multiply by the rule `s_R*s^{(k)}_\lambda = s^{(k)}_{\lambda\cup R}`.  Currently `_to_schur_on_basis` is computed by determining the tableau in the k-atom of a given shape.  Factoring out maximal rectangles seems to reduce the computation by orders of magnitude for large examples.

Before:

```
sage: Sym = SymmetricFunctions(QQ); ks3 = Sym.kschur(3,1); s = Sym.s()
sage: timeit("s(ks3([3,3,3,2,2,1,1,1]))", number = 1, repeat = 1)
1 loops, best of 1: 7.43 s per loop
```

After:

```
sage: Sym = SymmetricFunctions(QQ); ks3 = Sym.kschur(3,1); s = Sym.s()
sage: timeit("s(ks3([3,3,3,2,2,1,1,1]))", number = 1, repeat = 1)
1 loops, best of 1: 55.5 ms per loop
```

This will also add a `scalar` method to the element class of bases of the k-bounded space.

Hi Mike,

I reviewed the changes and they look good to me! I posted a small review patch on the sage-combinat queue right after your patch. Please review and fold if appropriate and reupload here.

Best,

Anne

This patch is really great. The following took almost infinite on my machine before the patch:

```
sage: Sym = SymmetricFunctions(QQ); ks3 = Sym.kschur(3,1); s = Sym.s()
sage: ks3[3,3,3,2,2,1]*ks3[3,3,2,2,2]
```
With the patch we get

```
sage: Sym = SymmetricFunctions(QQ); ks3 = Sym.kschur(3,1); s = Sym.s()
sage: timeit("ks3[3,3,3,2,2,1]*ks3[3,3,2,2,2]", number=1, repeat=1)
1 loops, best of 1: 145 ms per loop
sage: ks3[3,3,3,2,2,1]*ks3[3,3,2,2,2]
ks3[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1] + ks3[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2]
```

All tests seem to pass!
