Interesting -- these were new to me, despite the paper being in my algebra folder...

What is the rationale behind replacing `sage.combinat.partition.Partitions()` by `_Partitions`? Speed? (And why only sometimes?)

EDIT: "permtutation", "excedences". Ok, the latter might need some explanation. Dictionaries say that "exceedences" and "exceedance" are both right, the latter form apparently being the standard one. Combinatorialists seem to use either "exceedance" or "excedance". Noone seems to use "excedence".

EDIT2: I find this ambiguous: ``i` is a descent and `i` is not an excedence or `i + 1` is,`.

This was something introduced in #13605 since the set of all partitions is used all over the place and the UniqueRepr. calls do have some effect on speed. Plus this means it's never garbage collected.

> EDIT: "permtutation", "excedences". Ok, the latter might need some explanation. Dictionaries say that "exceedences" and "exceedance" are both right, the latter form apparently being the standard one. Combinatorialists seem to use either "exceedance" or "excedance". Noone seems to use "excedence".

Hmmm...curious. I followed what is in `permutation.py`: the method `weak_excedences()`. Since this is just in the docstring, I think it'd be okay to use "excedance" to match the reference.

> EDIT2: I find this ambiguous: ``i` is a descent and `i` is not an excedence or `i + 1` is,`.

That was the least ambiguous way I could come up with. The parenthesis should be around the "or" but English syntax doesn't allow that. Oh, here's a thought:

<code>\`i\` is a descent, and given that \`i\` is not an excedance or \`i + 1\` is,</code>

And because I can't resist the (bad) pun: English is not a language decided around around logic.
