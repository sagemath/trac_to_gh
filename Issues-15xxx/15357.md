Add the following features to permutation group elements:

```
    def support(self):
        """
        Return the support of ``self`` that is the points that are not fixed.
        """

    def fixed_points(self): ?
        ...

    def cycle_type(self):
        """
        Return the cycle type of ``self``.
        """

```

Besides, for concistency with the `cycle_tuples` method, the `cycles` method could accept the option singleton. It's questionable whether we want to have those two very similar methods in the first place.

See also the discussion in #14319.
