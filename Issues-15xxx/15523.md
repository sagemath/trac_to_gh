Mostly add "precision" arguments to functions where they were missing. Also add some Cython optimizations. No user-visible changes (except an unrelated fix for the message of a `PariError` of type `syntaxer`).

With a terminal size of 80 columns, one doctest fails (PARI inserts a line break and the next line is filtered out because it does not contain "syntax error"):

```

Failed example:

Got:

That seems to be the easiest solution for now.  Is is possible/useful to do this only when doctesting?

Anyway, once we move to PARI >= 2.6, we can use the new function `pari_err2str()`, which should give us a nicer (terminal-independent) way to get the error message than parsing `stderr`.

Apart from that, positive review.
