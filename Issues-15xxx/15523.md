With a terminal size of 80 columns, one doctest fails (PARI inserts a line break and the next line is filtered out because it does not contain "syntax error"):

```
File "src/sage/libs/pari/gen_py.py", line 63, in sage.libs.pari.gen_py.pari
Failed example:
    pari(v)
Expected:
    Traceback (most recent call last):

Got:

That seems to be the easiest solution for now.  Is is possible/useful to do this only when doctesting?

Anyway, once we move to PARI >= 2.6, we can use the new function `pari_err2str()`, which should give us a nicer (terminal-independent) way to get the error message than parsing `stderr`.
