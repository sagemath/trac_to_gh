See my comment at #10963. We could simply create a lazy class attribute with an import statement inside. Proof of concept:

```
sage: def imported_lazy_class_attribute(module_name, cls_name):                         
....:     return lazy_class_attribute(lambda cls: getattr(__import__(module_name, {}, {}, [cls_name]),cls_name))
....: 
sage: class Test(object):
....:     Finite = imported_lazy_class_attribute('sage.categories.finite_permutation_groups', 'FinitePermutationGroups')
....:     
sage: Test.Finite
<class 'sage.categories.finite_permutation_groups.FinitePermutationGroups'>
```

Alternatively, since `LazyImport` has some `__get__`: We could make the lazy import *behave* as a class attribute, if it is used as attribute of a class (`__get__` knows whether it is used as attribute of a class.

Strange. Shouldn't `LazyImport` already act as a class attribute? After all, I see the following code:

```python
            if owner is None:
                if self._namespace and self._namespace[alias] is self:
                    self._namespace[alias] = self._object
            else:
                from inspect import getmro
                for cls in getmro(owner):
                    if cls.__dict__.get(alias, None) is self:
                        setattr(cls, alias, self._object)
                        break
```
This should actually do the trick.

The only (mild) problems I see:
1. Why is the `_get_object`, if it does what ostensibly is the job of `__get__`?
2. Why is the imported object put into the dict of a class, but not into the dict of an instance? `_get_object` can't do it, since it doesn't know the instance.

Hence, I am all for removing `_get_object`.
