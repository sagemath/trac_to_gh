As reported on #15278 :

```
sage: g=digraphs.RandomDirectedGNP(10,.3)
sage: gi=DiGraph(g,data_structure="static_sparse")
sage: print gi.size(), len(gi.edges())
68 34
```

Simplest bug eve : Sage was taught to return the wrong thing. The sum of all arcs in the digraph, plus the sum of all arcs in the reversed digraph. That's clearly more than necessary `:-P`

Sorryyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy !!

For a review, I need some information on `num_edges(self,directed)`.

- In the doc string, you start to tell us something:
  {{{
        INPUT:

        - ``directed`` (boolean) -- whether to consider the graph as directed or
          not (
  }}}
  Should there be some explanation after the opening bracket, or should the opening bracket be removed?
- You define `cdef unsigned int m` but don't use it. I guess this should be removed.
- In the case of an undirected graph whose number of directed edges are requested, you do `return int(cg.g.neighbors[cg.g.n]-cg.g.edges)`. Can you please explain why this is equal to twice the number of edges minus the number of loops? In `static_sparse_graph.pyx` I read
  {{{
    * ``neighbors`` (``unsigned short **``) -- this array has size `n+1`, and
      describes how the data of ``edges`` should be read : the neighbors of
      vertex `i` are the elements of ``edges`` addressed by
      ``neighbors[i]...neighbors[i+1]-1``. The element ``neighbors[n]``, which
      corresponds to no vertex (they are numbered from `0` to `n-1`) is present
      so that it remains easy to enumerate the neighbors of vertex `n-1` : the
      last of them is the element addressed by ``neighbors[n]-1``.
  }}}
  By combining both comments, I guess that `neighbors[n]` gives three times the number of edges minus the number of loops (so that `cg.g.neighbors[cg.g.n]-cg.g.edges` is two times the number of edges minus the number of loops, as requested), and thus the last neighbour of vertex `n-1` is three times the number of edges minus the number of loops minus one---but if that's the case then it should be stated somewhere.

Also there is trailing whitespace in error messages:

```
                raise NotImplementedError("Sorry, I have no idea what is expected "
                                          "in this situation. I don't think "
                                          "that it is well-defined either, "
                                          "especially for multigraphs.")
```
And I think the French rules of typography shouldn't be used in an English text. Hence, replace `bla : bla` by `bla: bla`. I guess this will be part of a review commit.

Sorry, I just notice that

```
                raise NotImplementedError("Sorry, I have no idea what is expected "
                                          "in this situation. I don't think "

                                          "especially for multigraphs.")
```
becomes

```
NotImplementedError: Sorry, I have no idea what is expected in this situation. I don't think that it is well-defined either, especially for multigraphs.
```
So, no trailing whitespace.

Yo !

> For a review, I need some information on `num_edges(self,directed)`.


Okay. Just to make things clear, I don't like this function, it was just part of the `sparse_graph` backend and so I implemented the very same for this new backend.

> - In the doc string, you start to tell us something:


I removed the `)`.

> - You define `cdef unsigned int m` but don't use it. I guess this should be removed.


Done.

> - In the case of an undirected graph whose number of directed edges are requested, you do `return int(cg.g.neighbors[cg.g.n]-cg.g.edges)`. Can you please explain why this is equal to twice the number of edges minus the number of loops?


`cg.g.edges` is not equal to the number of edges. It is a pointer toward the beginning of the `edges` array. `cg.g.edges` is actually equal to `cg.g.neighbors[0]`. I added a line of doc to emphasize it. I'm substracting pointers there, not integers.

Which trailing whitespace ? `O_o`
You mean the spaces just before the `"` ? If I remove them you will see "expectedin" and "thinkthat" when the message is displayed. I added a doctest to make this clear.

> And I think the French rules of typography shouldn't be used in an English text. Hence, replace `bla : bla` by `bla: bla`. I guess this will be part of a review commit.


There is no occurrence of " : " in this file, and to be honest I could not care less about the spaces between and after the ":". I am french, and most of the books I read are english. I don't care whether there is a " : " or ": ", I don't even notice the difference. My problem with spaces before/after ":" is that there are grammar nazis on both sides : the english complain when I put spaces, the french when I don't. Honestly do whatever you want with that. Though there again, I couldn't find any occurrence of " : " in that file.

I don't like it either, but I do like if equal graphs evaluate equal.

> `cg.g.edges` is not equal to the number of edges. It is a pointer toward the beginning of the `edges` array. `cg.g.edges` is actually equal to `cg.g.neighbors[0]`. I added a line of doc to emphasize it. I'm substracting pointers there, not integers.


Aha, I see. Pointers are mind bending.

Yes, I have not been aware that Python lets you do those things. I thought that

```
("h"
"e"
"l"
"l"
"o")
```
is a syntax error, but it results in 'hello'.

> I added a doctest to make this clear.


Good idea.

> There is no occurrence of " : " in this file,


There is one in the doc string that I cited.

> the english complain when I put spaces, the french when I don't.


I don't like imposing rules of one language to another language. There are stories of Germans named, e.g., "Müller", having problems with US cops, because the cops wouldn't even notice that there are dots over the "u" in the guy's passport, and would certainly not accept that the correct way to spell this German name on a keyboard without Umlaut is "Mueller" and not "Muller". Actually I hate myself for writing "Groebner" instead of "Gröbner" in Sage doc strings (but at least I don't write "Grobner").

Of course, errors can occur, specifically when writing text in a foreign language, and an extra space certainly is not a big drama (I am *not* calling you an imperialist : `:-P`). Since the above mentioned doc string is from `static_sparse_graph.pyx` and thus from a file that your commits don't touch, I'd say one shouldn't try to fix it here.
