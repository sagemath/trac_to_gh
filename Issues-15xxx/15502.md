From google spreadsheet which no one reads `X-(`

Plot two curves defined by two implicit equation using the function 
implicit_plot does not provide a satisfactory output.

I attach the text of the worksheet to reproduce it:

```
sage: x,y=var('x', 'y')
sage: i=implicit_plot(-1-(x^2+y^2)/(2*x-sqrt(x^2-3*y^2)), (x,-3,0), (y, -1.5,1.5))
sage: j=implicit_plot(-1-(x^2+y^2)/(2*x+sqrt(x^2-3*y^2)), (x,-3,0), (y, -1.5,1.5))
sage: i+j

sage: m=implicit_plot(-1-(1/3)*(2*x-sqrt(x^2-3*y^2)), (x,-3,0), (y, -1.5,1.5))
sage: n=implicit_plot(-1-(1/3)*(2*x+sqrt(x^2-3*y^2)), (x,-3,0), (y, -1.5,1.5))
sage: m+n

sage: o=implicit_plot(-1-(1/3)*(2*x-sqrt(x^2-3*y^2)), (x,-3,0), (y, -1.5,1.5))
sage: p=implicit_plot(-1-(1/3)*(2*x+sqrt(x^2-3*y^2)), (x,-3,0), (y, -1.5,1.5))+n
sage: o+p

```

Plot should appear continuous, but it actually appears incomplete/broken.

can this ticket be classified as wrong answer or not?

Nah, I think this is more to enhance - sometimes such plots are not so easy to generate.
