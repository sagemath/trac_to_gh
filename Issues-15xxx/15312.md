The following bug seems to appear on Macs only (linux machines do not seem to be effected).

To begin with, let's do a change of basis in a small degree:

```
    sage: p = SymmetricFunctions(QQ).powersum()
    sage: s = SymmetricFunctions(QQ).schur()
    sage: s(p[2,2])
    s[1, 1, 1, 1] - s[2, 1, 1] + 2*s[2, 2] - s[3, 1] + s[4]
```
Now let's do one in a larger degree:

```
    sage: time g = s(p([1]*47))
    Time: CPU 19.16 s, Wall: 20.91 s
```
Now let's do that first one again:

```
    sage: s(p[2,2])
    s[1, 1, 1, 1] - s[2, 1, 1] + 4571483302*s[2, 2] - s[3, 1] + s[4]
```
That's not the correct answer ! And the next time you ask Sage, it
gives different, still incorrect, answers:

```
    sage: s(p[2,2])
    s[1, 1, 1, 1] - s[2, 1, 1] + 4614252243*s[2, 2] - s[3, 1] + s[4]
    sage: s(p[2,2])
    s[1, 1, 1, 1] - s[2, 1, 1] + 4634718110*s[2, 2] - s[3, 1] + s[4]
    sage: s(p[2,2])
    s[1, 1, 1, 1] - s[2, 1, 1] + 4631047636*s[2, 2] - s[3, 1] + s[4]
```

In [this discussion](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-combinat-devel/fWMuS4R5M9Q/discussion) on sage-combinat-devel, Anne noticed that the problem is "not symmetrica per se, but some wrapper functions around symmetrica, as the following example shows":

```
sage: f = eval('symmetrica.t_POWSYM_SCHUR')
sage: f({Partition([2,2]):Integer(1)})
s[1, 1, 1, 1] - s[2, 1, 1] + 2*s[2, 2] - s[3, 1] + s[4]
sage: time g = f({Partition([1]*47):Integer(1)})
Time: CPU 13.03 s, Wall: 13.04 s
sage: f({Partition([2,2]):Integer(1)})
s[1, 1, 1, 1] - s[2, 1, 1] + 2*s[2, 2] - s[3, 1] + s[4]
sage: Sym = SymmetricFunctions(QQ)
sage: p = Sym.power()
sage: s = Sym.schur()
sage: s(p[2,2])
s[1, 1, 1, 1] - s[2, 1, 1] + 4631790164*s[2, 2] - s[3, 1] + s[4]
sage: f({Partition([2,2]):Integer(1)})
s[1, 1, 1, 1] - s[2, 1, 1] + 2*s[2, 2] - s[3, 1] + s[4]
```

And Travis commented that:

> When (random) big numbers appear like that, it almost always is an integer overflow. I suspect the communication with Symmetrica goes through the native integer. Is this correct? If so, then that's where I'd say the problem lies.


This is a bug which is carried over from #13413 .  When we realized that there are actually two bugs and one has been corrected, these tickets were split.

<a id='comment:4'></a>To help identify the problem I need to know precisely what steps trigger the error:

```
sage: from sage.libs.symmetrica.all import t_POWSYM_SCHUR as PS
sage: g = PS({Partition([1]*50):ZZ(1)})
sage: PS({Partition([1]*4):ZZ(1)})
s[1, 1, 1, 1] + 3*s[2, 1, 1] + 2*s[2, 2] + 3*s[3, 1] + s[4]
sage: PS({Partition([1]*4):QQ(1)})
s[1, 1, 1, 1] + 3*s[2, 1, 1] + 2*s[2, 2] + 508150636*s[3, 1] + s[4]
```
So it seems that POWSYM to SCHUR over the integers has no visible problems, but POWSYM to SCHUR over the rationals is having the overflow, but only after we've done a sufficiently large calculation (over the integers or rationals).

I'm having a hard time identifying the problem inside of the symmetrica package because if you create a c program with a command `scan(POW_SYM,a);` then it allows you to enter a power symmetric function with all kinds of coefficients, but none of them are rational.

<a id='comment:9'></a>I get the same sort of problem with the following test.c program.  This seems to show that the problem is with the 'freeall' and not with the fact that I reuse the `a` and `b` variables.  `ANFANG` is making a bunch of calls to `callocobject` for variables `a` through `h` and `ENDE` is doing a bunch of `freeall` calls for the same variables.

```

<a id='comment:17'></a>OK, the following just looks wrong to me and it is in `kuerzen_integer_integer` and this same issue seems to appear in several places.

```
    ggterg = ggt_i(S_B_UI(bruch),S_B_OI(bruch));

    if (ggterg == S_B_UI(bruch)) {
        freeself_bruch(bruch);
        M_I_I(S_B_OI(bruch) / ggterg,bruch);
        goto ende;
        }
```

It seems to say
(1) calculate the gcd of the numerator (`S_B_OI(bruch)`) and the denominator (`S_B_UI(bruch)`) (2) if the gcd is equal to the denominator then `freeself_bruch(bruch)` and then divide ... and at this point I scream '''wait! don't touch `S_B_OI(bruch)` because `bruch` is already free!

So I want to change this to the following:

```
    ggterg = ggt_i(S_B_UI(bruch),S_B_OI(bruch));

    if (ggterg == S_B_UI(bruch)) {
        tmp = S_B_OI(bruch);
        freeself_bruch(bruch);
        M_I_I(tmp / ggterg,bruch);
        goto ende;
        }
```

When I do this...guess what!?!?!  I don't seem to see the random integer in the output when I use the test.c from comment 13.  I think that this means I have found the bug.

<a id='comment:29'></a>1) The changes inside the spkg need to be committed (`hg commit`):

```
jdemeyer@boxen:~/spkg/symmetrica-2.0.p9$ hg status
M SPKG.txt
? patches/bruch.patch
```

2) The directory `src/` should be reverted to the **exact** contents it had before, including timestamps (in practice, simply remove `src/` and copy it from the previous spkg):

```
jdemeyer@boxen:~/spkg/symmetrica-2.0.p9$ ls -l src/b*
-rw-r--r-- 1 jdemeyer jdemeyer 23190 Dec  6  2007 src/bar.c
-rw-r--r-- 1 jdemeyer jdemeyer  3467 Dec  7  2007 src/bar.doc
-rw-r--r-- 1 jdemeyer jdemeyer 35117 Dec  6  2007 src/bi.c
-rw-r--r-- 1 jdemeyer jdemeyer   348 Dec  7  2007 src/bi.doc
-rw-r--r-- 1 jdemeyer jdemeyer 77748 Dec  6  2007 src/boe.c
-rw-r--r-- 1 jdemeyer jdemeyer  7150 Dec  7  2007 src/boe.doc
-rw-r--r-- 1 jdemeyer jdemeyer 59384 Oct 21 21:38 src/bruch.c
-rw-r--r-- 1 jdemeyer jdemeyer  2122 Dec  7  2007 src/bruch.doc
```

3) The spkg doesn't install, because of problems with the filenames inside `bruch.patch`:

```
$ ./sage -i http://garsia.math.yorku.ca/~zabrocki/symmetrica-2.0.p9.spkg
[...]
can't find file to patch at input line 3
Perhaps you used the wrong -p or --strip option?
