Thanks for the comments. I'm sorry I should have been more explicit about the source of the tarball.

The original source tarball is listed on the [upstream](http://www.lifl.fr/~bouillag/fes/) website you linked to. Under "Advanced use" it has a link:

"You can get the code in a [source tarball](https://bitbucket.org/fes/fes/get/master.tar.bz2)"

The link is to the bitbucket page for the source code, [https://bitbucket.org/fes/fes/get/master.tar.bz2](https://bitbucket.org/fes/fes/get/master.tar.bz2)
The md5sum is
`86a983de37eafa4c3110b1a640418023  master.tar.bz2`

However, I had to modify this tarball because it expands to a folder named `fes-fes-1229a4ec1e4e/`. Somehow Sage's package installer wasn't correctly renaming the expanded format and installation would fail.

So I renamed `fes-fes-1229a4ec1e4e/` to `libFES-0.2/` and re-compressed the file with
`tar -cjf libFES-0.2.tar.bz2 libFES-0.2`
The new md5sum is
`f895755c85ada462d77ab4d8e3fb4fd3  libFES-0.2.tar.bz2`
This is the file linked to on my SMC project in the ticket description.


As for the lines in the `spkg-install` file, if I remove

```
autoreconf -i -v
```

I get an error when trying to install the package:

```
./spkg-install: line 19: ./configure: No such file or directory
Error configuring libFES
```

Is it bad to run `autoreconf` in install file? Should I run this command and then re-compress the folder?

Yes, but it's not really said that this is "version 0.2". It looks like it's just a snapshot of the bitbucket repository. Unless you know for sure that this is really version 0.2, use a date `libfes-20140427` (the date of the files in the tarball) as version number. Do you feel like asking upstream about this?

Yes, because `autoreconf` is not installed on many systems.

No, the proper way to generate source tarball using autotools is to run `make dist`. So you should somehow get the correct source tarball, build it (in whatever way, using `autoreconf` if needed) on your own system, and run `make dist`. This command will generate a tarball which is meant to be used as source tarball.

Running `make dist` fails and I don't quite understand the error message:

I will email upstream (he was the original author of this ticket actually) and see if he knows how to fix this. Otherwise it will probably take me a few days to figure out this error. I thought since this was an optional and experimental package that requiring `autoreconf` was not so terrible.

The upstream autotools files are pretty broken, I will see what I can do.

I wasn't able to get `make distcheck` to pass when I applied your patch. Can you tell me if I am doing something wrong. I tried patching the tarball I attached and also with a totally new directory using the following code (this should be equivalent since the tarball attached should be the latest snapshot of upstream master):

```
git clone https://bitbucket.org/fes/fes.git
cd fes
wget http://trac.sagemath.org/raw-attachment/ticket/15209/libfes.patch
patch -p1 < libfes.patch
autoreconf -i -v
./configure
make
make distcheck

```

Thanks for looking into autotools for this!

I emailed upstream about this issue. I haven't heard back yet.
