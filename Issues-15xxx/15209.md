Thanks for the comments. I'm sorry I should have been more explicit about the source of the tarball.

The original source tarball is listed on the [upstream](http://www.lifl.fr/~bouillag/fes/) website you linked to. Under "Advanced use" it has a link:

"You can get the code in a [source tarball](https://bitbucket.org/fes/fes/get/master.tar.bz2)"

The link is to the bitbucket page for the source code, [https://bitbucket.org/fes/fes/get/master.tar.bz2](https://bitbucket.org/fes/fes/get/master.tar.bz2)
The md5sum is
`86a983de37eafa4c3110b1a640418023  master.tar.bz2`

However, I had to modify this tarball because it expands to a folder named `fes-fes-1229a4ec1e4e/`. Somehow Sage's package installer wasn't correctly renaming the expanded format and installation would fail.

So I renamed `fes-fes-1229a4ec1e4e/` to `libFES-0.2/` and re-compressed the file with
`tar -cjf libFES-0.2.tar.bz2 libFES-0.2`
The new md5sum is
`f895755c85ada462d77ab4d8e3fb4fd3  libFES-0.2.tar.bz2`
This is the file linked to on my SMC project in the ticket description.


As for the lines in the `spkg-install` file, if I remove

```
autoreconf -i -v
```

I get an error when trying to install the package:

```
./spkg-install: line 19: ./configure: No such file or directory
Error configuring libFES
```

Is it bad to run `autoreconf` in install file? Should I run this command and then re-compress the folder?

Running `make dist` fails and I don't quite understand the error message:

I will email upstream (he was the original author of this ticket actually) and see if he knows how to fix this. Otherwise it will probably take me a few days to figure out this error. I thought since this was an optional and experimental package that requiring `autoreconf` was not so terrible.

I wasn't able to get `make distcheck` to pass when I applied your patch. Can you tell me if I am doing something wrong. I tried patching the tarball I attached and also with a totally new directory using the following code (this should be equivalent since the tarball attached should be the latest snapshot of upstream master):

```
git clone https://bitbucket.org/fes/fes.git
cd fes
wget http://trac.sagemath.org/raw-attachment/ticket/15209/libfes.patch
patch -p1 < libfes.patch
autoreconf -i -v
./configure
make
make distcheck

```

Thanks for looking into autotools for this!

Here is the error, it looks like it is expecting some directory that isn't there or isn't being named properly? Also it does generate a tarball, but it's only 45 bytes:

If it helps, this is on running on a sage math cloud project. I'm not sure if there is some other tool that should be installed, but if there is I can ask William to install it for this.

I emailed upstream about this issue. I haven't heard back yet.
