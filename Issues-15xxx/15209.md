<a id='comment:17'></a>Good point on changing the name everywhere.

I used `./sage -grep "FES"` to find any other references. The only one I could find was in a polynomial function under rings/. That also referenced an old `install_package` function which when I ran Sage suggested using `sage -i libFES` so I changed that documentation as well.

Also I finally figured out that the functions that were being wrapped had several signature changes. Now they are how they should be and it passes all the tests.

<a id='comment:23'></a>Thanks for the comments. I'm sorry I should have been more explicit about the source of the tarball.

The original source tarball is listed on the [upstream](http://www.lifl.fr/~bouillag/fes/) website you linked to. Under "Advanced use" it has a link:

"You can get the code in a [source tarball](https://bitbucket.org/fes/fes/get/master.tar.bz2)"

The link is to the bitbucket page for the source code, [https://bitbucket.org/fes/fes/get/master.tar.bz2](https://bitbucket.org/fes/fes/get/master.tar.bz2)
The md5sum is
`86a983de37eafa4c3110b1a640418023  master.tar.bz2`

However, I had to modify this tarball because it expands to a folder named `fes-fes-1229a4ec1e4e/`. Somehow Sage's package installer wasn't correctly renaming the expanded format and installation would fail.

So I renamed `fes-fes-1229a4ec1e4e/` to `libFES-0.2/` and re-compressed the file with
`tar -cjf libFES-0.2.tar.bz2 libFES-0.2`
The new md5sum is
`f895755c85ada462d77ab4d8e3fb4fd3  libFES-0.2.tar.bz2`
This is the file linked to on my SMC project in the ticket description.


As for the lines in the `spkg-install` file, if I remove

```
autoreconf -i -v
```

I get an error when trying to install the package:

```
./spkg-install: line 19: ./configure: No such file or directory
Error configuring libFES
```

Is it bad to run `autoreconf` in install file? Should I run this command and then re-compress the folder?

Running `make dist` fails and I don't quite understand the error message:

```

I will email upstream (he was the original author of this ticket actually) and see if he knows how to fix this. Otherwise it will probably take me a few days to figure out this error. I thought since this was an optional and experimental package that requiring `autoreconf` was not so terrible.

The upstream autotools files are pretty broken, I will see what I can do.

I wasn't able to get `make distcheck` to pass when I applied your patch. Can you tell me if I am doing something wrong. I tried patching the tarball I attached and also with a totally new directory using the following code (this should be equivalent since the tarball attached should be the latest snapshot of upstream master):

```
git clone https://bitbucket.org/fes/fes.git
cd fes
wget http://trac.sagemath.org/raw-attachment/ticket/15209/libfes.patch
patch -p1 < libfes.patch
autoreconf -i -v
./configure
make
make distcheck

```

Thanks for looking into autotools for this!

Ideally, upstream should apply the autotools patches and release a source tarball with `make dist`.

Here is the error, it looks like it is expecting some directory that isn't there or isn't being named properly? Also it does generate a tarball, but it's only 45 bytes:

If it helps, this is on running on a sage math cloud project. I'm not sure if there is some other tool that should be installed, but if there is I can ask William to install it for this.

I emailed upstream about this issue. I haven't heard back yet.
