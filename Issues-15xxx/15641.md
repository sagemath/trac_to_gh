Instead of always fixing all checksums of files in `$SAGE_ROOT/upstream/*.tar*`, allow the tarballs to be specified via command-line arguments.

Also support the command `sha1sum` (which might be available when `shasum` is not).

Looks good ! All I did not understand it 

```
-            echo $tarball
+            echo >&2 $tarball
```

What is the meaning of this ?

It prints the content of `$tarball` to `stderr` instead of `stdout`.

`O_o`

Weird. Is that totally equivalent to `echo $tarball >&2` ? I thought the redirection was always at the end of the line `O_o`

The following are equivalent:

```
echo $tarball >&2
echo >&2 $tarball
```

For `echo` statements, I prefer the redirection in the beginning, since
it allows nice looking

```
echo >&2 "Hello Nathann,"
echo >&2 "how are you doing today?"
echo >&2 "Bye!"
```
which looks better than

```
echo "Hello Nathann," >&2
echo "how are you doing today?" >&2
echo "Bye!" >&2
```
