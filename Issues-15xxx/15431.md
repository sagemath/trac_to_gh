Hi Nathan,

Few remarks that would me help me for the review

* In the function  transversal_desing
  * the arguments are ordered k,n but in the definition n,k is used.
  * could you give the definition with t

* In the function orthogonal_arrays
  * you should defined what is a (k,n,t) orthogonal array.
  * the documentation says that only t=2 is available but it does not
    prevent you to define it in that generality.
  * I guess that if k >= n+t there is no (k,n,t) orthogonal array. Do
    you know that ? If this is true, please more explicit in the error
    rather than `NotImplementedError`: I don't know how to build this 
    orthogonal array!" I would prefer "`EmptySetError`: there exist no
    (k,n,t) orthogonal array with k >= n+t"

Hello !

I just answered all your comments in the code. About the last one : it is true that `k > n+1` is impossible when `t=2`, and this holds because of the equivalence with MOLS, but I don't see how you prove it for any larger `t` ?... As we only handle `t=2` in the code, I changed the error message in this  case.

I want to do many things with this design code, but being the only fan is a problem here : it is very hard to have these patches reviewed (thank you very much again for doing it !). The thing is that there are equivalences between TD,OA,MOLS, and that some constructions (like wilson's construction in #15310) are very powerful ways to generate new objects. So we must have an automatic way to check if Sage knows of to build an equivalent OA when  it has no construction for a specific MOLS, and conversely, and the same with TD. Thus in the end, I would love it  if the error message "Such  a design  does not exist" which is written  in the MOLS would automatically yield the same message on the Orthogonal Array side `:-)`

But I  would like to have Wilson's construction inside of Sage  first. And perhaps another product construction  I need for the BIBD with k=5. Ahahahah. Long road `:-)`

Anyway here is the commit,  and sorry for those missing definitions.

Nathann

Hi Nathann,

I am very happy with the `EmptySetError`. Could you raise it *before* the check t=2 ?

OA and TD are the same objects up to relabeling. More precisely, an OA is a TD with sets V1 = V2 = ... = Vn = [n] whereas you choose the convention V1 = [n], V2 = [n,2n], ... for the TD. I do not see the point of having two different functions... please tell me.

It seems that backtracking might be an approach to build TD when there are no other constructions. It might also be helpful to build all TD up to isomorphism. Do you know how hard would it be ?

Curiosity question: if you build a TD with k=n+t-1 do we know if for any two Si, Sj their intersection has t-1 elements ? (answering yes would help the backtracking)

Hellooooo !

I believe it is already the case in the branch.

Yep !

Well, I have two because I implemented all this while reading books and fishing for the theorems I needed. It is true that they are the same, and there is also a bijection between orthogonal arrays with `t=2` and mutually orthogonal latin squares. That's why I would like to "implement the theorem" that "There exists a TD iif there exists a OA iif there exists a MOLS", and make sure that if one of the three functions can build something then the two others can build the corresponding object.

Why a TD and a OA ? Well, because the books talk of both. Sometimes the same book talks of the two things, and sometimes you do not want to do this relabeling by yourself. They are the same objects (as well as MOLS) and so the code must not repeat itself, but the two objects exist in the book and so I think the two objects should exist here too.

As any construction of a MOLS or OA or TD can be translated into a construction of another of the three, it is technically possible to have only one main function, and two "translating" functions when needed.

I was not arguing about MOLS which for me looks really different. TD and OA are the very same up to a stupid relabeling. Please do not argue about MOLS, I want to leave them for now.

This is an argument for having two entry points but not having two places where to find the code.

> This is an argument for having two entry points but not having two places where to find the code.


Well... I saw a construction for a transversal design, I added it to the constructor of transversal designs. What is the problem with having two places with code, given that we will have some code in MOLS and in TD at the same time ?

I mention those MOLS again because I would have agreed with your if we only had TD and OA. It is too similar to have one which is not just a translating function for the other, but given that we are more or less forced to have two versions already, I do not see what would keep us from having a third one.

> I believe this was not easy, but my job is review. And it should be clear for anybody who reads the code why there are two different functions TD and OA. With the definition you gave in the documentation a OA *is* a TD.


As well as a MOLS.

Well, I have a product function for transversal designs to add as part of the general BIBD with k=5 construction. Not very long, and it can obviously be rewritten as a TD or a MOLS.

Really, as we are already forced to accept that code will be spread into at least two functins, MOLS and TD or OA, I just don't mind a third one, given that some code is written to make them communicate.

And in the end writing code for these objects gets easier : implement a TD if you want a TD, implement an OA if you want an OA, etc ...

Though perhaps I should tell you what I have in mind for these files : 

I do not like to have so many "if" in the functions.. Really, each "if" actually means "try this construction, and if it failed try this one, and if it failed try this one". As a result you have a lot of very different constructions in the same place, and it is hard to document them individually.

Besides, the code will get worse because of #15310, because I need to add an argument to TD/OA : "do not build the design, just tell me if you can do it". This is useful because Wilson's construction is recursive, and because you do not want to build stuff that you may not be able to use in the end.

This, in each of these "if" which try some construction, you also have to handle the case where you only want to return a boolean answer, or return the best MOLS you can build, stuff like that.

And it does get messy.

So what I thought is something like this : write three decorators

```
@mols_construction
@td_construction
@oa_construction
```

And when the `@`mols_construction is applied to a function F (defined anywhere in the file), then F is added to a global index of "mols constructions".

And then, the code of "MOLS(k,n)" becomes "For every constructor in the global list, give it a try and answer if it returns something useful".

As you can see, the TD6_12 is a function of its own, and it is only called in the constructor of TD. It's either this, or add the documentation of the different constructions in the doc of transversal_design, and that does not scale.

Which means that the two objects are not equivalent, which means that there is no problem anymore. What do you think ?

Hi Nathann,

A TD is a subset `\mathcal{S}` of transversals in `V_1 \times V_2 \times \ldots \times V_k` such that for any given t-tuple `v = (v_{i_1}, \ldots, v_{i_t})` inside `V_{i_1} \times V_{i_2} \times \ldots \times V_{i_t}` there exists a unique `S` in `\mathcal{S}` such that `v` is in `S`.
(note that necessarily `\mathcal{S}` has cardinality `n^t`).

In your implemetation, you chose `V_1 = [n]`, `V_2 = [n,2n]` etc. Actually, with the generalized definition above, you can think of an OA as a TD where  `V_i = [n]`. The correspondence is just stupid and you already wrote it in your code:

```
OA2TD = lambda OA: [[i*n+c for i,c in enumerate(l)] for l in OA]
TD2OA = lambda TD: [[(j-c)//i for j,c in enumerate(l)] for k in TD]
```

I propose to move **all** the code from TD into OA and have a stupid OA2TD which does the stuff if people prefer TD labelling. Even better, you can let the user specifies his/her preferred choice of sets V1, ..., Vk as parameters in the function OA. More precisely, you would write:

```
TD2OA = lambda OA,V: [[V[i][c] for i,c in enumerate(l)] for l in OA]
```

I am happy to do the change by myself if you agree.

2) In the definition of TD and OA (on both Wolfram and Wikipedia) there is an extra parameter lambda. It is lost in your definition. Why?

Hello Vincent !

Hey man, I am sorry but the definition of a TD is what it is. If Sage implements a mathematical object, it has to be what people expect. I know that the objects are equivalent, the theory knows that the objects are equivalent, but they are two objects with different names and different definitions.

Why on earth would it make any sense to implement different definitions just because it makes the code easier ? That's crazy ! And WILL lead to mistakes !

> The correspondence is just stupid and you already wrote it in your code:

No way. The definition of a TD in Sage will be the definition of a TD in Books/Wikipedia/Papers. 

> 2) In the definition of TD and OA (on both Wolfram and Wikipedia) there is an extra parameter lambda. It is lost in your definition. Why?


Because it is equal to 1 in all the designs, which is what people would expect. We can add it and raise an exception if anything different from 1 is given, or add in the documentation that it is assumed too be one (which, again, is what people would expect). I don't like to add parameters that cannot be changed, so I would prefer the second option.

Permutations on {0,1,2} and {a,b,c} are in **trivial** bijections while permutations and binary trees are in bijection but not in a trivial way.

Just put a word in the definition like "Sometimes there is a useless parameter lambda in definitions, it is always 1 here."

I hope not, for in a TD all groups are disjoint sets. If the users want different labels we can do that indeed, but really ...

I waste my health and my computer wastes cycles so that you algebraists can label the vertices of a graph with things which are not integers. Surely I can make graphs use integers only as vertices and you will deal with the relabeling yourselves ? They are in trivial bijection.

I will do so in a second. As soon as my "make" of Sage terminates.

As you wish. What about this ?

Well, it is the convention to have them disjoint, plus I used `\sqcup` instead of `\cup`, plus you can actually deduce that they are disjoint from the definition : if two groups intersect on one element, then a set which contain it cannot have cardinality k as it must intersect each group at most once, and there are k groups.

I added a "disjoint" somewhere in the definition to make it clearer.

> (e.g. if I am using is_transversal_design I want to know what I am testing).


Is there something unclear in the documentation of `is_transversal_design` ?

Let me mention that `\sqcup` does not mean that they are disjoint but that you take the [disjoint union](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint_union). The set `A \sqcup A` is perfectly valid and will have cardinality twice the one of `A`. So I would actually prefer a `\cup` if it is what you intended to do.

The documentation is much better in `is_transversal_design` because of the NOTE block. But there is nothing in `transversal_design`. Could you do a copy/paste or something.

(For me, it would be clearer for a TD to be a subset of `V1 x V2 x ... x Vk` but let us stick to conventions).

Okayyy, I updated the commit again to remove those `sq`.

Sage is such a wonderfully perfect software that all we have to do now is discuss the use of `sqcup` and `cup`. Everything else has been solved.

That's precisely why we have both TD and OA. Because you can easily intersect the sets of a TD, but you cannot intersect elements of `V1 x V2 x ... x Vk`.
