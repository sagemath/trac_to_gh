```
The following code raises an error

```
sage: p = graphs.CompleteGraph(2).plot()
sage: p.save('tmp.pdf')
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
AssertionError                            Traceback (most recent call last)
...
AssertionError: 
```

The error seems to be caused by edges, indeed

```
sage: p = graphs.CompleteGraph(1).plot()
sage: p.save('tmp.pdf')
```

works fine.

Depends on #14993

Interesting. Indeed a two vertex, zero edge graph also works fine:

```
sage: g = Graph(2)
sage: pic = g.plot()
sage: pic.save('two-verts.pdf')
```

Gosh ! They have quivers there too ? `O_O` 

Good news, though. Well, it means that we need to upgrade matplotlib now `:-)`
