Some graphs which were missing in #9136. And I don't want to miss another occasion to say that I hate topological graphs. 
Theirs embeddings are the ugliest things on earth. 
Nobody should study topological graphs. It has to be bad for karma.

* Horton Graph : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horton_graph
* Kittell Graph : http://mathworld.wolfram.com/KittellGraph.html
* Markstrom Graph : http://mathworld.wolfram.com/MarkstroemGraph.html
* Sousselier Graph : http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphe_de_Sousselier
* Poussin Graph : http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PoussinGraph.html
* Tutte Graph : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tutte_graph
* Wiener-Araya Graph : http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Wiener-ArayaGraph.html

Anyway... And we are almost done with the graphs from #9136 (short of Tutte's fragment, which I doubt to be of any use independent from Tutte's graph which this patch implements). Another patch on Snarks will follow, today or tomorrow.
