Some graphs which were missing in #9136. And I don't want to miss another occasion to say that I hate topological graphs. 
Theirs embeddings are the ugliest things on earth. 
Nobody should study topological graphs. It has to be bad for karma.

* Horton Graph : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horton_graph
* Kittell Graph : http://mathworld.wolfram.com/KittellGraph.html
* Markstrom Graph : http://mathworld.wolfram.com/MarkstroemGraph.html
* Sousselier Graph : http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphe_de_Sousselier
* Poussin Graph : http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PoussinGraph.html
* Tutte Graph : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tutte_graph
* Wiener-Araya Graph : http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Wiener-ArayaGraph.html

Anyway... And we are almost done with the graphs from #9136 (short of Tutte's fragment, which I doubt to be of any use independent from Tutte's graph which this patch implements). Another patch on Snarks will follow, today or tomorrow.

By the way, it seems that we do not have a is_hypohamiltonian method yet.

(namely the doc is not shown in a formatted way)

I suspect that the ö of Grötsch and of Markström may be involved.

Hmmmmm... I can't run the notebook on my git version of Sage, and my mercurial version of Sage works fine with the Grotsch graph.

This being said, if it comes from weird accents I guess that it counts as a notebook bug. Could you try writing a function in the notebook which uses a weird accent, and get its documentation next to see if it works ?
