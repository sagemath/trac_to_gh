sage: B = factor(prod(primes(200)))
sage: %timeit reduce(lambda f, g: f+g, B, ())

Your solution is clearly asymptotically faster in theory and practice, and I find it more elegant.  There is a non-negligible overhead for small cases, unfortunately, but adding a case distinction for this seems overkill.  A new patch is underway.
