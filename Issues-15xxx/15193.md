Various PARI functions, such as `Zn_issquare` (cf. #13596), accept an integer argument in factored form.  To profit from this, it is convenient to add a method `Factorization._pari_()` to convert a Sage `Factorization` to a PARI matrix.

Yes, for me it is faster for factorizations with at least (about) 10 factors. Some non-scientific timings:

```

100000 loops, best of 3: 1.86 us per loop
sage: B = factor(prod(primes(200)))
sage: %timeit reduce(lambda f, g: f+g, B, ())        
10000 loops, best of 3: 33.2 us per loop
sage: %timeit tuple(itertools.chain(*B))             
10000 loops, best of 3: 20.8 us per loop
