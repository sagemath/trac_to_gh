Yes, for me it is faster for factorizations with at least (about) 10 factors. Some non-scientific timings:

```
sage: import itertools
sage: A = factor(prod(primes(2)))
sage: %timeit reduce(lambda f, g: f+g, A, ())
1000000 loops, best of 3: 830 ns per loop
sage: %timeit tuple(itertools.chain(*A))     
100000 loops, best of 3: 2.26 us per loop
sage: %timeit tuple(itertools.chain.from_iterable(A))
100000 loops, best of 3: 1.86 us per loop
sage: B = factor(prod(primes(200)))
sage: %timeit reduce(lambda f, g: f+g, B, ())        
10000 loops, best of 3: 33.2 us per loop
sage: %timeit tuple(itertools.chain(*B))             
10000 loops, best of 3: 20.8 us per loop
sage: %timeit tuple(itertools.chain.from_iterable(B))
10000 loops, best of 3: 20.1 us per loop
sage: C = factor(prod(primes(2000)))
sage: %timeit reduce(lambda f, g: f+g, C, ())        
1000 loops, best of 3: 418 us per loop
sage: %timeit tuple(itertools.chain(*C))             
10000 loops, best of 3: 119 us per loop
sage: %timeit tuple(itertools.chain.from_iterable(C))

Your solution is clearly asymptotically faster in theory and practice, and I find it more elegant.  There is a non-negligible overhead for small cases, unfortunately, but adding a case distinction for this seems overkill.  A new patch is underway.
