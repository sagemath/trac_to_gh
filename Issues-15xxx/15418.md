```
In the notebook

```
%timeit
1+1
```
gives

```
2
CPU time: 0.00 s,  Wall time: 0.00 s
```
whereas

```
timeit("1+1")
```
gives

```
625 loops, best of 3: 806 ns per loop
```
as it should.

In contrast, at the sage command line we get

```
sage: timeit("1+1")
625 loops, best of 3: 886 ns per loop
sage: %timeit 1+1
1000000 loops, best of 3: 309 ns per loop
```

This is inconsistent, the notebook `%timeit` should also return something like `625 loops, best of 3: 806 ns per loop`.

Interesting.  You may also want to report this [upstream](https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb) as well, if it hasn't been already.
