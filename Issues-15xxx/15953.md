Thomas Feulner:

I am working on linear codes and I observed a high memory consumption when constructing codes of large length. I figured out that this problem already appears in the construction of vector spaces:

```
sage: F.<a> = GF(4)
sage: M = MatrixSpace(F, 8, 10000).random_element()
sage: V = VectorSpace(F, M.ncols())
sage: V.__dict__.keys()
['__reduce_ex__', '_element_class', '_gram_matrix', '_FreeModule_generic__rank', '_FreeModule_generic__is_sparse', '_FreeModule_generic__degree', '_FreeModule_generic__uses_ambient_inner_product']
sage: V.subspace(M)
Vector space of degree 10000 and dimension 8 over Finite Field in a of size 2^2
Basis matrix:
8 x 10000 dense matrix over Finite Field in a of size 2^2
sage: V.__dict__.keys()
['__reduce_ex__', '_element_class', '_gram_matrix', '_FreeModule_generic__rank', '_FreeModule_generic__is_sparse', '_FreeModule_generic__degree', '_FreeModule_ambient__basis', '_FreeModule_generic__uses_ambient_inner_product']
```

As you can see, the construction of the subspace adds a basis to V ==> sage stores 10000 dense vectors of length 10000!

Doing the same construction over other fields, say F=QQ, does not show this behavior. Is there any 
solution in sight for this?

The issue seems to be fixed now.
Calling 

```
V.basis()
```
still takes ages but I guess that is to be expected.

Indeed it is complicated to check. Your method would work today but if the way the basis is cached does change in the future we would not see it. Possible alternative:
- just compare the number of attributes,
- play with a vector space whose vector would have size ~500M so that the basis could not fit in memory (though patchbot are not run with memory limit).

I am not very much convinced by my propositions.
