```
The [documentation](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/constructions/linear_algebra.html)  for `.kernel()` have to be extended.

`.kernel()` (left and right) gives a vector space.

`.kernel().matrix()` provides a matrix whose rows are a basis of the vector space.

`.kernel().list()` for a kernel gives all vectors, which are all combinations of a basis.

See attached file for details.

Keywords: **kernel matrix**

<div id="comment:2" align="right">Comment 2</div>

As far as I understood, "kernel" returns a matrix space with a basis. Every element k in K.list() gives "0" vector (M*k).

However, there is no information in the documentation ([http://www.sagemath.org/doc/tutorial/tour_linalg.html](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/tutorial/tour_linalg.html)) regarding this.

`.kernel()` gives a vector space, not a matrix space.

`.matrix()` provides a matrix whose rows are a basis of the vector space.

`.list()` for a matrix might gives the rows, or something (unchecked).

"Every element k in K.list() gives "0" vector (M*k)."  As it should be.  But your ticket implies you think the converse should be true.  This would be impractical for matrices over an infinite ring.

Did you try listing the actual vectors of the kernel itself, not the matrix?  Not sure if that will behave as expected or not.  Perhaps so?

I guess that "K.list()" gives all linear combinations of the basis.
