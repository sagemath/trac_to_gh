```
The [documentation](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/constructions/linear_algebra.html)  for `.kernel()` have to be extended.

`.kernel()` (left and right) gives a vector space.

`.kernel().matrix()` provides a matrix whose rows are a basis of the vector space.

`.kernel().list()` for a kernel gives all vectors, which are all combinations of a basis.

See attached file for details.

Keywords: **kernel matrix**

Appears to me that your "extra" vector is already in the kernel as a linear combination of the basis vectors provided by Sage?  

```
sage: r = vector(GF(2), [1,1,1,1,1])  
sage: r*K

As far as I understood, "kernel" returns a matrix space with a basis. Every element k in K.list() gives "0" vector (M*k).

However, there is no information in the documentation ([http://www.sagemath.org/doc/tutorial/tour_linalg.html](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/tutorial/tour_linalg.html)) regarding this.

`.kernel()` gives a vector space, not a matrix space.

`.matrix()` provides a matrix whose rows are a basis of the vector space.

`.list()` for a matrix might gives the rows, or something (unchecked).

"Every element k in K.list() gives "0" vector (M*k)."  As it should be.  But your ticket implies you think the converse should be true.  This would be impractical for matrices over an infinite ring.

Did you try listing the actual vectors of the kernel itself, not the matrix?  Not sure if that will behave as expected or not.  Perhaps so?

I guess that "K.list()" gives all linear combinations of the basis.

No, thanks for clarification. In my opinion, someone has to update the documentation.

OK.  Would you like to modify the "description" field on this ticket to clarify exactly what was confusing, or in need of changes/additions?  Maybe "someone" will read this transcript someday and have a whack at it.

Thanks for the input,
Rob
