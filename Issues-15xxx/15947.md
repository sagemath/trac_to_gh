As a step towards removing the old parent with gens and using categories, we need to have `_rmul_` and `_lmul_` take any `Element`, not just `RingElement`.

The problem begins with `_rmul_()` and `_lmul_()` in (cython) matrices/vectors/etc. take a `RingElement` as an argument. The issue is that not all elements in rings inherit from `RingElement` (in fact, the category framework says we shouldn't have to do this). So the `_lmul_()` and `_rmul_()` error out and subsequently the attempt for coercion.

However, more and more I'm convincing myself that my proposal is not the way to do things unless we want `Element` to have a default `_mul_`. Yet we want to potentially let the categories give such an implementation. I'm not quite sure what the best course of action is. Thoughts?

The problem can be seen with the following:

```
sage: m = SymmetricFunctions(QQ).m()
sage: M = matrix(m, [[m[1], m[2]],[m[1,1], m[1]]])
sage: M
[   m[1]    m[2]]
[m[1, 1]    m[1]]
sage: m[1,1] * M
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

    204             import operator
--> 205             return get_coercion_model().bin_op(self, right, operator.mul)
    206 
    207 #        __imul__ = __mul__

/home/travis/sage/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/structure/coerce.so in sage.structure.coerce.CoercionModel_cache_maps.bin_op (sage/structure/coerce.c:8262)()

TypeError: unsupported operand parent(s) for '*': 'Symmetric Functions over Rational Field in the monomial basis' and 'Full MatrixSpace of 2 by 2 dense matrices over Symmetric Functions over Rational Field in the monomial basis'
```
So converting things to use `CombinatorialFreeModule` from old parents (in particular, `FreeAlgebra`) breaks things that use to work.

I do, and in fact at some point I tried to use more of the "good old" Cython base classes in the category framework.

One problem, if I recall correctly, is a bug in Cython (still not fixed if I recall correctly) that makes it possible to create a Python class C that inherits from two Cython base classes A, B, such that some methods of A trying to access cdef attributes of A get confused by cdef attributes of B. So, the Cython does not recognise that the class layouts are incompatible.

...
TypeError: unsupported operand parent(s) for '*': 'Free module generated by {'a', 'b', 'c'} over Rational Field' and 'Free module generated by {'a', 'b', 'c'} over Rational Field'
sage: h = SymmetricFunctions(QQ).h()
sage: m = matrix(h, [[h[2,1], h[3,2]], [h[1], h[1]]])
sage: h[2,1] * m
[h[2, 2, 1, 1] h[3, 2, 2, 1]]
[   h[2, 1, 1]    h[2, 1, 1]]
```
Although at some point we will need a category-based approach to this problem, but I don't see how to do so

Although I've come across an independent bug with 1x1 matrices:

```
sage: matrix(h, [[h[2,1]]])
...
AttributeError: 'tuple' object has no attribute 'parent'
```

I can post branches/commits of the various attempts I mentioned above too.

Replying to [SimonKing](#comment%3A13):
> I think you are right, "any object" would be too broad. 


That was not the reason: "any object" does not work since code often needs the parent of the second argument of `_lmul_` (and only an `Element` has a parent).

Unlike `_mul_`, it seems that the parents of the arguments of `_lmul_` and `_rmul_` are not defined.

> If you wanna implement an algebraic structure, you should at least inherit from `Element`.


True, but besides the point. How your algebraic structure is implemented does not say anything about the API of calling `_lmul_`.

I have an eventual goal in mind of merging all the various `*Element` classes which will then automatically solve this ticket too.
