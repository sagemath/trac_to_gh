This ticket implements filtered vector spaces and multi-filtered vector spaces (multiple filtrations of a single vector space). This is then used to implement Klyachko bundles. 

Mandatory fun example: There are 3 torus-equivariant deformations of the tangent bundle on the del Pezzo of degree 6:

```
sage: dP6 = toric_varieties.dP6()
sage: TX = dP6.sheaves.tangent_bundle()
sage: (TX * TX.dual()).cohomology(weight=(0,0), dim=True)
(1, 3, 0)
```
