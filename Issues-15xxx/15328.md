This ticket implements filtered vector spaces and multi-filtered vector spaces (multiple filtrations of a single vector space). This is then used to implement Klyachko bundles. 

Mandatory fun example: There are 3 torus-equivariant deformations of the tangent bundle on the del Pezzo of degree 6:

```
sage: dP6 = toric_varieties.dP6()
sage: TX = dP6.sheaves.tangent_bundle()
sage: (TX * TX.dual()).cohomology(weight=(0,0), dim=True)
(1, 3, 0)
```

<a id='comment:21'></a>There is no dot product in `tensor_operations.py`, only tensor products. Your fix was incorrect because of this (somewhat questionable) behavior of cartesian product:

```
sage: cartesian_product([[1,2], [3,4]])
The cartesian product of ({1, 2}, {3, 4})
sage: list(_)
[(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)]
```
vs.

```
sage: cartesian_product([vector([1,2]), vector([3,4])])
((1, 2), (3, 4))
```

This implementation is a good deal faster, in fact I wrote it because M2 was too slow.

I don't know of a better reference than Klyachko. Really its obvious, an equivariant bundle is determined by how the (finitely many, in the case of a toric variety) orbits fit together. The rest is just technical bookkeeping, and Klyachko writes down the details if you care for them.
