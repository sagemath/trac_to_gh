<a id='comment:3'></a>Hi,

Good work! There are some things that need to be changed and others that can be improved (not necessarily in this ticket but it might be a good idea to think about it). First of all about syntax and tests:

1) your tests do not work: if you do bdd_height(K,100) in a console the function bdd_height simply does not exists. You should put the line

```
from sage.rings.number_field.bdd_height import bdd_height
```
at the begining of the tests.

2) There are many syntax errors in the documentation:
- the lines must not be longer than 80 characters.
- the documentation of each function should start with a short sentence of one line. Then you can add some more documentation after a break line.
- the syntax for the block of examples is not good
- ...
For all that, you may have look at the Sage developer guide or even better at other files in the source code (like number_field.py)

3) for your functions there is no need of having an underscore. It is required to have "private" method into classes but it is not needed for functions.

4) the name of functions that are actually used by users should not be abreviated (unless it is as common as det for the determinant). I would prefer having bounded instead of bdd.

About algorithmic

5) Why did you choose 100 as default precision for your floating point numbers? It makes no sense. Either you use the default Sage value or you actually guarantee the result. Moreover you do computations using floating point numbers and then suddenly, at line 500, you switch to rational numbers! It seems to me that you use rational numbers for finding your integer points in the polytope. If you intend to use floating point approximation it makes more sense to use RDF (as there is an highly optimized search for integer points in polyhdera). Much more important, using floating point approximation is always dangerous as you get errors each time you do an operation. It is not a trouble if you have control on your quantities (for example you can safely invert a matrix in RDF as soon as A and A<sup>-1</sup> are reasonably small). So, if you want your result to be the good result (meaning that you have all the points and no more) then you should either take more care with floating point numbers or use proven arithmetic (like arithmetic interval, which is implemented in Sage or ball arithmetic etc). Using interval arithmetic is slow so it is not a good advice to use it here.

6) There are a lot of simplification that you can do. For example the lines 291-298

```
    # Create polyhedron from transformed vertices and find integer points inside
    int_points = Polyhedron(transformed_vertices, base_ring=QQ).integral_points()

    # Return these integer vectors as tuples
    int_point_tuples = []
    for vec in int_points:
        int_point_tuples.append(tuple(vec))
    return int_point_tuples
```
can be replaced by two (much faster) line

```
    # Return integer points in the polyhedron
    return map(tuple, Polyhedron(transformed_vertices, base_ring=QQ).integral_points())
```
And by the way, why do you need to convert the result into tuples?

7) It would make sense to have an iterator rather than an actual list (i.e. a method K.element_of_bounded_height_iterator(500) that returns an iterator and not a list). Most of the time, I guess that people want to use this method to test conjecture or such. So what they want is for each element in that list check some conjecture with that input. Have a look at [Tutorial: Programming in Python and Sage](http://sagemath.org/doc/thematic_tutorials/tutorial-programming-python.html).

<a id='comment:12'></a>Mostly minors issues, but there are a few of them.


Some general comments first

- there are many instances of lines with trailing white space that need to be removed.

- please merge in most recent beta as the branch on trac is weird and seems to be deleting all of number_field.py, although that is not what the downloaded branch does.

- put a REFERENCE block in one place, then reference in other places
 
- is the GRH parameter really needed as all it does is set the number_field(True/False) switch? I would rather see that controlled by the global switch and not the individual functions anyway. So, I'd remove the parameter and mention the switch in the documentation.

- why is lll lower case and GRH upper case?

---

for the numberfield.py file:

- doc test error in number_field.py. Seems the elements are out of order.

- using keywords for the parameters would be better so they can be specified independently.

- lll keyword is not used in the function 

- output - an iterator **of number field elements***

---

for the bdd_height.py file:

- It is standard to have some comments at the header to describe the purpose of the file/GNU licence/authors/etc.

- itertools.product - is the only itertools you use, so only import that one

- same with copy.copy

- same with real_mpfr.RealField

- the warning block is producing docbuild errors.

bdd_norm_pr_gens_iq:
- this is returning elements of K not ideals like the description says

- output - a dictionary **of principle ideals**, keyed by norm


bdd_height_iq:

- if bound is non-negative should always return 0, not empty list (current skips 0 if the bound is < 1).

bdd_norm_pr_ideal_gens:

- output - a dictionary of ???

- returns elements not ideals as doc specifies

integer_points_in_polytope:

- check docs for [-interval_radius,interval_radius]^r

- # long time (40 s) -- is a very long doc test - does it need to be quite this long or  would a short long test do the same thing

- if you're allowing real numbers for the matrix shouldn't you have the base_ring for the polyhedron be RR?

bdd_height:

- QQ to `QQ`, ``K`` to `K`. In general, things that need latex typesetting (i.e., math) should be put in single quotes

- missed 0 for heights < 1

- same for these long tests - 290s is a *very* long time, please evaluate whether such a long test is truly necessary.

- does the precision test by changing to QQ ever actually fail. I'm not sure why this is a precision test since any real number to some finite number of decimals places can be converted to a rational.

- 'principle ideals of bounded norm' are really generators of principle ideals

It certainly does fail if the precision is not good enough. The issue is that a fundamental unit can have an embedding with very very small absolute value; when we take log of that, RR may interpret this as log(0). If I recall correctly this is ok with RR, but when you try to coerce into QQ it raises an error.
