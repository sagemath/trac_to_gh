A quick search found http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=14997 which looks of interest.
I'll try lowering the optimization level.

Obviously, we need a lot more information in the ticket description, in particular Solaris version, gcc version, full build log of ncurses... because it works on some Solaris/SPARC systems.

Can we simply disable the "Ada" part of ncurses, that is almost certainly not needed.

Agree, just configure without ada (possibly none of the skynet machines has ada, which is why we haven't noticed before?)

I guess the "/usr/include/stdlib.h" might be the problem.
I think I already had problems on this machine with Singular including stuff from /usr/include and stumbling upon an old version of GCC which was problematic/incompatible.

I see: when the wide version is built, -DXOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED is passed again (don't know yet from where though).

So getting a narrow version by disabling ada is easy.
Not sure about the wide version yet, nor if that's even possible.

I've reported the two problems upstream.
Thomas is very reactive and I'm sure it will be fixed in a few days, so we could just package the dev release then (and that would also fix the ncurses issue from #15317).
