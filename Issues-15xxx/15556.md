There are two optional spkgs containing small and full version of the Stein-Watkins database of elliptic curves, namely database_stein_watkins_mini.p0.spkg (the small version, approximately 20mb) and stein-watkins-ecdb.p0.spkg (the huge version, approximately 2.7gb).

Both should be converted to the new git format for spkgs, at the same time making their names more consistent and completing their SPKG.txt information.  The interface in sage/databases/stein-watkins.py will need to be tested.

Done both.

The new package files have been uploaded to sagemath in /home/cremona:

```
-rw-r--r-- 1 cremona cremona   19935714 Dec 20 09:19 database_stein_watkins_mini-20131220.tar.bz2
-rw-r--r-- 1 cremona cremona 2784729140 Dec 20 10:48 database_stein_watkins-20131220.tar.bz2
```

Installing even the small one is not very quick, and the long one quite slow.  The optional doctests in sage/da\
tabases/stein_watkins.py will work with only the mini package; remember to add --optional=stein_watkins_databas\
e to the command line or you'll not be checking much!

Various details:
1. use `cp -R` instead of `cp -rf`
2. omit the version check (you're adding a check for version 6.x to a file which only exists in version 6.x)
3. replace `$SAGE_LOCAL/share` by `$SAGE_SHARE`
4. replace

```
if [ "x${SAGE_LOCAL}" = x ]; then
   echo "SAGE_LOCAL undefined ... exiting"
   echo "Maybe run 'sage -sh'?"
   exit 1
fi
```
by

```
if [ -z "$SAGE_SHARE" ]; then
    echo >&2 "SAGE_SHARE undefined ... exiting"
    echo >&2 "Maybe run 'sage --sh'?"
    exit 1

I don't see why. They are welcome to have an opinion, but I don't think we need to ask every upstream project how it should be included in Sage.

I checked and those changes are not included, the data is from 2003.
