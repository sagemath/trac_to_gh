<a id='comment:13'>Comment 13:</a>
The good/bad stuff is historical.

As far as non patch stuff in the patches directory, I had the feeling some other packages did that.

And my first concern here is that I tested the package a couple of days ago and:
* it does not build at first, stupid glibc version restriction as usual with valgrind...
* and it does not work properly, or at least did not for me: at least Sage now launches (not as reported in #14097 which I could reproduce when the ticket was active), but I cannot exit it...

I'm moving the suppression files to `$SAGE_EXTCODE/valgrind/sage.supp`, that way we can even use the system valgrind (which is also more likely to work with your version of glibc).
