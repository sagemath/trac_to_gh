If it doesn't work, fine, just let the build fail (one would hope that upstream gives a reasonable error message in this case). Too often, these kind of checks prevent building on systems which are perfectly fine.

<a id='comment:13'></a>The good/bad stuff is historical.

As far as non patch stuff in the patches directory, I had the feeling some other packages did that.

And my first concern here is that I tested the package a couple of days ago and:
* it does not build at first, stupid glibc version restriction as usual with valgrind...
* and it does not work properly, or at least did not for me: at least Sage now launches (not as reported in #14097 which I could reproduce when the ticket was active), but I cannot exit it...
