The new functions needs some doctests to check that the type is correct.

I am actually quite surprised by the inconsistency of the Sage implementation. `self.real` contains the number in the case of python's `complex` but it is a function in Sage's implementation. Do you know what is the reason behind the function in the Sage implementation?

```
sage: a = CC(1)     
sage: a.real
<function real>
sage: a = complex(1)
sage: a.real
1.0
```

*EDIT* Actually just shift the doctests to within the `__call__` functions.

Okay, I'll add the tests.

I think the reason for the functions is that it's converting from MPFR. It could be changed with the `@property` decorator so that `self.real` will work.
