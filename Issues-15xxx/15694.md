In #12768 a deprecation warning was introduced for the elliptic curve (over QQ) isogeny_class function together with the parameter `use_tuple` which defaults to True (old-style output), though using this value shows a deprecation warning.

We should switch the default to `use_tuple=False` and adjust the doctests accordingly.

I see no particular reason to remove the old-style (and current default) behaviour altogether, but in any case that would be for another ticket.

Brilliant. Thank you very much for doing this. I found the warning for a default value a very annoying thing.

All tests pass. The branch merges without problem into 6.1.rc0.
