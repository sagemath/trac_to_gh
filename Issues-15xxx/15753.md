Currently the abstract class BasisExchangeMatroid provides a method .isomorphic() to test if two matroids are isomorphic, but that method does not return an isomorphism, if one exist.

I want to add a function that does.

Made a first implementation by modifying the existing _is_isomorphic. It compiles and the doctests work. I will run a few tests before I put it up for review.

Hi, I noticed the following about the special cases for rank or corank 0 or 1 in basis_exchange_matroid.pyx and for rank 0 in basis_matroid.pyx. They return the identity map on the ground set of self rather than a map to the ground set of other. For example

```
sage: M = Matroid(matrix=Matrix(GF(2), [[1,1,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,0]]))
sage: N = Matroid(matrix=Matrix(GF(2), [[0,1,1],[0,1,0],[0,0,0]]))
sage: M.is_isomorphic(N)
True
sage: M.is_isomorphism(N, M.isomorphism(N))
False
```

```
sage: M = Matroid(groundset='abcde', bases=[[]])
sage: N = Matroid(groundset=range(5), bases=[[]])
sage: M.is_isomorphic(N)
True
sage: M.is_isomorphism(N, M.isomorphism(N))

ValueError: range of morphism does not contain groundset of other matroid.
```
For the rank/corank 0 case maybe the line

```
return {e:e for e in self.groundset()}
```
should be something like

```
return {list(self.groundset())[i]:list(other.groundset())[i] for i in range(len(self.groundset()))}
```
and for the rank 1 case

```
morphism = {list(M.groundset()-M.loops())[i]:list(N.groundset()-N.loops())[i] for i in range(len(M.groundset()-M.loops()))}
morphism2 = {list(M.loops())[i]:list(N.loops())[i] for i in range(len(M.loops()))}
morphism.update(morphism2)
return morphism
```

Given that `BasisExchangeMatroid` and `BasisMatroid` both inherit from `Matroid`, there is no point in adding `cpdef _isomorphism(self, other)` in the `.pxd` files for those.

Also, what's the advantage of making `isomorphism()` (without underscore) a `cpdef` method as opposed to just `def`?

OK, I'll remove these then.

> Also, what's the advantage of making `isomorphism()` (without underscore) a `cpdef` method as opposed to just `def`?


We did not really think about this. But is there a disadvantage? Cpdef just allows cdef child classes to override the function. While I don't see why anyone would want that,  why make it impossible? These are slow, high-level functions, so a little pointer testing at the start of the function won't affect overall efficiency. 

I wanted to upload a patch but today sage -b exits with: 
"src/convert.c:1:0: error: unknown value '10.10' of -mmacosx-version-min 
scons: * * * [src/convert.os] Error 1"

I guess my OSX version is too new. 

So feel free to make these changes, or wait until I find another way to test + upload a patch.

Two minor comments and a question:

* In BasisExchangeMatroid._is_isomorphic you changed four lines in the EXAMPLES section to remove BasisMatroid conversions. While today that doesn't matter, I would prefer to keep those to ensure that this file's version of the isomorphism test gets used, instead of some subclass's file.

* In Matroid._isomorphism you didn't indent the EXAMPLES block.

Fix those two things and the code gets a positive review from me.

One remark though: in Sage's graph class, there is a fairly common idiom to have an option in the test methods of the form `certificate=True/False`. When set to True, the function returns `(True, f)` if an isomorphism f is found, and `(False, )` otherwise. I'm not saying we should follow this here (isomorphism is important enough to be its own function), but we may want to consider it for other test methods.

To make sure that this file's version of the isomorphism test eventually gets used (and in particular, not BasisMatroid._is_isomorphic), I put back the BasisMatroid conversions for just one of each pair of matroids. 
 

> * In Matroid._isomorphism you didn't indent the EXAMPLES block.


I did so now.


> One remark though: in Sage's graph class, there is a fairly common idiom to have an option in the test methods of the form `certificate=True/False`. When set to True, the function returns `(True, f)` if an isomorphism f is found, and `(False, )` otherwise. I'm not saying we should follow this here (isomorphism is important enough to be its own function), but we may want to consider it for other test methods.


I'll keep it in mind.
