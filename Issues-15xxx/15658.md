There is a problem with the CPLEX backend for MixedIntegerLinearProgram. Namely the fact that one specifies a variable to be binary gets ignored. I couldn't find the bug in the code (it looks like it handles this well) hence I am posting it here.


```
sage: M = MixedIntegerLinearProgram(solver='CPLEX')
sage: A = M.new_variable(binary=True, dim=2)
sage: M.add_constraint(A[0][1]+A[0][2] == 2)
sage: M.solve()
0.0
sage: M.get_values(A)
{0: {1: 2.0, 2: 0.0}}
```

Best,

Jernej

I have quite a recent version (if not latest) of CPLEX. I'll check that out though.

The tests of course do not pass, for example...

```
File "sage-5.13-linux-64bit-ubuntu_12.04.3_lts-x86_64-Linux/devel/sage-main/sage/graphs/generic_graph.py", line 4075, in sage.graphs.generic_graph.GenericGraph.blocks_and_cuts_tree
Failed example:
    T.vertices()
Expected:
    [('B', (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9))]
Got:
    []

I am running 12.5.1.0 and he is talking about 12.6.. So I guess that will do it.
