There is a problem with the CPLEX backend for MixedIntegerLinearProgram. Namely the fact that one specifies a variable to be binary gets ignored. I couldn't find the bug in the code (it looks like it handles this well) hence I am posting it here.


```
sage: M = MixedIntegerLinearProgram(solver='CPLEX')
sage: A = M.new_variable(binary=True, dim=2)
sage: M.add_constraint(A[0][1]+A[0][2] == 2)
sage: M.solve()
0.0
sage: M.get_values(A)
{0: {1: 2.0, 2: 0.0}}
```

Best,

Jernej

None. Except that upgrading CPLEX seems to solve it. But please tell me : if you version of Cplex is broken too, do the doctests in graph/ really pass ? `O_o`

Given the number of binary ILP in there...

I have quite a recent version (if not latest) of CPLEX. I'll check that out though.

The tests of course do not pass, for example...
