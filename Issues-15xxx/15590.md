You need to rebuild sage (run "make"), because the scripts are loaded from `SAGE_ROOT/local/share/sage/ext/shell` and not from `SAGE_ROOT/src/ext/shell`.

I think if `$SHELL` is not set to bash then you either explicitly don't want bash features used or your OS is old/weird and its doubtful that bash works as it should. Where did you see the `SHELL=/bin/sh` environment?

While trying this out I noticed that OSX doesn't support `echo -e` to expand `\e`, this is now also fixed.

I saw `SHELL=/bin/sh` on one OS X 10.8 machine. It may have to do with how the sysadmins have set up that machine, but that's my shell there.

I'm trying again with the new version. Currently running `make`, which is taking a little while...

On a machine with `SHELL=/bin/bash`, it works well. On the machine with `SHELL=/bin/sh`, it is entering the appropriate case ("`bash)`"), but the bashrc file in `local/share/sage/ext/shell` is not loaded. If I replace `"$SHELL"` with <code>\`command -v bash\`</code>, it is loaded — this is in the line

```
set -- "$SHELL" --rcfile "$SAGE_EXTCODE/shell/bashrc" "$@"
```
In this case, it works, but not perfectly: the prompt comes out as

```

You don't have to use the sage shell at all. I never use it. But imho we should offer something nice for those that don't want to customize their own shell prompt. 

But to be on the safe side I think we should just fall back to something safe if SHELL is not set to /bin/bash.

I use a much shorter function in my zshrc to set up the git status, the
idea being that the shell should be fast in initialization and in returning
the prompt. So, the only command that is run is `git status` and everything
else is gleaned from that using shell operations. Also, I use `RPROMPT` so
that the left prompt is short. The `RPROMPT` disappears automatically once
the user starts typing too long commands.

```sh
function __check_git__() {
    local _s="$( git status 2>&1 )"
    [[ "${_s}" = "fatal:"* ]] && echo "" && return
    _s="$( echo "${_s}" | sed -e '/^#.*modified:.*(untracked content)$/d' )"
    local _g_s="$( echo "$_s" | sed -n -e '1s@^On branch @@p;q' )"

    if [[   "$_s" = *modified:*                 || \
            "$_s" = *"new file:"*               || \
            "$_s" = *"Your branch is behind"*   || \
            "$_s" = *deleted:*                  || \
            "$_s" = *renamed:*                     \
         ]]; then
        echo "[%20>...>%{$fg[red]%}$_g_s%{$fg[white]%}%>>]"
    elif [[ -n "$_g_s" ]]; then
        echo "[%20>...>%{$fg[green]%}$_g_s%{$fg[white]%}%>>]"
    else
        echo "%{$fg[yellow]%}[?]%{$fg[white]%}"
    fi
}

RPROMPT="%{$fg[white]%}•$(__check_git__)%{$fg[cyan]%}%n%{$fg[white]%}|%{$fg[green]%}%m%{$reset_color%}"
```

I rather like my PS1 the way it is; this should be optional at a minimum.

Ultimately I don't think we should be adding more internet bling bling into the sagemath codebase at this point. Anyone who wants this can enable it himself by following e.g.

  https://git-scm.com/book/uz/v2/Appendix-A%3A-Git-in-Other-Environments-Git-in-Bash

which is "trivial" to do and works in zsh as well.
