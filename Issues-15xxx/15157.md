```
The `degree_negation` method as I implemented it in #14775 would give a wrong result when given a symmetric function in a different basis:

```
sage: Sym = SymmetricFunctions(QQ)
sage: Sym.inject_shorthands()
/home/darij/sage-5.11.beta3/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/combinat/sf/sf.py:1197: RuntimeWarning: redefining global value `e`
  inject_variable(shorthand, getattr(self, shorthand)())
sage: h.antipode(e[3]) # WRONG
-h[1, 1, 1] + 2*h[2, 1] - h[3]
sage: h.antipode(h(e[3])) # correct
-h[3]
sage: h.degree_negation(e[3]) # WRONG
-h[3]
sage: h.degree_negation(h(e[3])) # correct
-h[1, 1, 1] + 2*h[2, 1] - h[3]
```

The attached patch fixes this (at no visible speed cost, I believe) and also improves some documentation (I replaced "automorphism" by "endomorphism" because those maps weren't always invertible).

Hey Darij,

Here's a small review patch which tweaks the doc (most important, it removes the second colon from your added `TESTS::` block). If you're happy with my changes, go ahead and set this to positive review.

Thanks,

Travis
