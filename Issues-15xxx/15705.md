The functions `PowerSeries.ogf()` and `egf()` are named wrong

The documentation states: *Returns the ordinary generating function associated to self.* But the function is a wrapper for the Pari function `serlaplace()` which actually converts to ordinary g.f. in the case of an exponential g.f.

Example: `1+x+x<sup>2+x</sup>3+x<sup>4+O(x</sup>5)` is generated both by `1/(1-x)+O(x^5)` or itself, but:

```
sage: R.<x> = PowerSeriesRing(ZZ)
sage: (1+x+x^2+x^3+x^4+O(x^5)).ogf()
1 + x + 2*x^2 + 6*x^3 + 24*x^4
```
which is clearly wrong given name and definition.

So, I hope you agree it's necessary if I rename `ogf()` to `egf_to_ogf()` and `egf()` to `ogf_to_egf()` and adapt the docs.

You should probably use `deprecated_function_alias`.

I just added a small commit on top of yours to fix two things:

1) The `ogf=...` and `egf=...` had a wrong indentation level

2) The `deprecated_function_alias` function was not imported

All tests pass. If you agree with my changes you can set the ticket to `positive_review`.
