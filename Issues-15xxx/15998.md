There isn't much of it (the function in question is a GAP wrapper), but I prefer it if functionality wouldn't disappear.

Also for the number of partitions of a particular length:

```
sage: P = Partitions(20, length=3); P
Partitions of the integer 20 satisfying constraints length=3
sage: P.cardinality()

Hellooooooo Darij ! I agree with what I see in your patch, but like Travis I would have tried to obtain this result through `Partitions(n, length=k).cardinality()`.

I personally hate objects, so I perfectly understand that you may not want to create all these things if you do not need it, but if you implement it like that there will be two ways to obtain the same thing, one of which you would not use yourself because it is too slow.

What would you think of creating this very short class whose cardinality method would be the function you add ?

Or even better: couldn't you create a cardinality method in the current "partitions" object, which would either check that "length" is the only argument and call your function in that case, and otherwise call the  inherited version of "cardinality" (which takes a lifetime anyway ?).

This way, no class to create.

By the way, it seems that this file contains code deprecated by 13072, which is more than 1 year old.

Have fuuuuuuuuun !

Nathann

Helloooooooooooooooooooooooooooo !!

Too bad. I was getting into your ZS1 algorithm which I had never read, and I ended up wondering if you really needed to re-implement it, i.e. if you could not remove this part of your patch `:-P`

You are writing an iterator over the partitions of n of length exactly k.

Do you agree with me if I say that it is equivalent to iterating over the partitions of n-k of length *at most* k ?

Because you already have a way to get all partitions of length at most k : ZS1 as it is currently implemented does it, doesn't it ? You just have to stop iterating when the partition has length >k.

So well, tell me what you think of it.

I have other comments :
- "Fast Algorithms for Generating Integer Partitons" should be in a REFERENCE block, and cited as we usually cite references (see sage: `Graph.modular_decomposition??`)
- You define Fubini numbers and link to their OEIS page. Could you link to this page too ? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordered_Bell_number
- In the doc of ZS1 there is a "partition type" : was "partition tuples" intended ?

Oh, and you can do this change too, sorry I forgot

```
-            lst = [self.n - self.k + 1] + [1 for _ in range(self.k-1)]
+            lst = [self.n - self.k + 1] + [1]*(self.k-1)
```

I was about to do it myself in a reviewer's patch, but this question over ZS1 spoiled everything.

I have to read this ZS1 algorithm though, it looks nice.

Thanks !

I am reading your code at the moment. I understood ZS1 and it is a nice algorithm ! Going through your modified version now, and I will probably add some comments I need.

Would you have anything against changing "the opposite of the lexicographic order" with "decreasing lexicographic order" ? At first I thought you were talking of the "co-lexicographic order". I know it was my fault, but "decreasing lexicographic order" would have saved me. What do you think ? Meanwhile I will be reading the code. I will send you a commit before leaving the lab this evening. Have fun `:-)`

Ahahahahaahah. Okay, thanks to trac I know how old my latest comment is, and I can claim that I spent the last 82 minutes looking at this very line :

```
while t > (k-h-1) * r:
```

I was totally sure that the `>` should be a `>=` or that there should be a +1 somewhere, but NO WAY, I made tests and it was right. AAaaaaaaand that's all because of this cursed line 

```
t = m - h + 1
```
Which I expected to be the sum of the elements to the right of `x[h]`, and which contained this cursed `+1`. Ahahaha. And of course because clearly in my head `m` was the length of the partition.... And not `m+1`.

AHAHahahahahahahaha. Crazy. I'm late now.

Anyway, your code is good, I added a couple of comments, I removed the one which wrongly claims that the function is recursive, and if you agree with my last commit you can set this ticket to `positive_review`.

Gosh.

Well. You know that x[h] is at least 3, and that everything to its right is a 1.

First, if the current partition is not of length k then you know that you can add a new entry, so for sure you can decrease the current value and move a +1 somewhere to the right

So the current partition has length exactly k.

If there IS some 1 to the right of x[h], then for sure you can decrease your current value and increase a value somewhere to the right, for they are not all equal to x[h]-1

So your current partition has length exactly k, and there is no 1 to the right of x[h].

Thus, you must decrease h until you see an element x[h'] which is at least x[h]+2

Ahahahah. Except if I made a mistake somewhere. But I DID look at this line for more than an hour :-P

By the way, it is totally impossible to type [] on a mac keyboard. I wonder how can anybody write code with their cursed keyboard.

Your changes are okay, so this patch goes in ! ;-)

I've implemented a hybrid algorithm which mostly does a bunch of special casing before passing it off to GAP. The one case where it definitively does something different is when `2k >= n`, where it is just equal to the number of partitions of size `n - k`. Also for `k = 2` where it's equal to `n // 2`.

Some timings:

```
sage: N = [20, 500, 156234]
sage: K = [5, 10, 15, 20, 250, 499, 500, 501, 80000]
sage: for n in N:
....:     for k in K:
....:         P = Partitions(n, length=k)
....:         print n,k
....:         %timeit P.cardinality()
....:         %timeit P.cardinality('gap')

```
The hybrid approach could probably be improved further for the special case of `3k >= n > 2k`, or up to a small multiple of `k`.

I also added another special case to the ZS1 algorithm for `k == 1`.

Let me rewrite better what I said above. We are looking for the largest value h sur that all elements to the right of x[h] can be replaced with things below x[h].\n\n\n1) If the current partition is not of length k, then you know for sure that your multiplicative equation is satisfied, so the current value of h is the value you want.\n\nProof: x[h] is at least 3, and all elements to the right of x[h] are at most one. Let us say that you have exactly L ones, and we know that you have at least one unused cell : thus L+1 <= (L+1)(x[h]-1), which is the opposite of your multiplicative equation, i.e. your code does not enter the loop in this situation.\n\n(We can now assume that the current partition has length exactly k)\n\n2) If there IS some 1 to the right of x[h] (note that this can be tested without multiplicative equation too), then the current value of h is the value you want\n\nProof: let us say that you have L ones to the right of x[h]. In this case those ones are a partition of L into integers <= 1, and it is of course possible to express a partition of t=L+1 into (less) integers <= 2 <= x[h]-1\n\n( We can now assume that your current partition has length exactly k, and there is no 1 to the right of x[h])\n\nIn this case, the least admissible value for h is the largest value h' such that x[h'] is at least x[h]+2\n\nNathann",

> Oh -- but it's only sufficient, not necessary, so I'd have to check the multiplicative equation in one branch nevertheless. 

Ahahahaahah.

Okay, last attempt to convince you that it is not only a sufficient condition. Let me rewrite better what I said above. We are looking for the largest value h sur that all elements to the right of x[h] can be replaced with things below x[h].


1) If the current partition is not of length k, then you know for sure that your multiplicative equation is satisfied, so the current value of h is the value you want.

Proof: x[h] is at least 3, and all elements to the right of x[h] are at most one. Let us say that you have exactly L ones, and we know that you have at least one unused cell : thus L+1 <= (L+1)(x[h]-1), which is the opposite of your multiplicative equation, i.e. your code does not enter the loop in this situation.

(We can now assume that the current partition has length exactly k)

2) If there IS some 1 to the right of x[h] (note that this can be tested without multiplicative equation too), then the current value of h is the value you want

Proof: let us say that you have L ones to the right of x[h]. In this case those ones are a partition of L into integers <= 1, and it is of course possible to express a partition of t=L+1 into (less) integers <= 2 <= x[h]-1

( We can now assume that your current partition has length exactly k, and there is no 1 to the right of x[h])

In this case, the least admissible value for h is the largest value h' such that x[h'] is at least x[h]+2

Hmmmm... Well, you already tested that x[h] was larger than two, it is the test that you have just before the loop in your code.

And you can test at the same time if there is space left for the partition to grow and  if there is a one to the right of x[h] : that's testing if h is equal to m `:-)`

If it is,you can skip the loop.

If it isn't,then you have  to decrease h in order to find this element larger than x[h]+2.

I  do not know which kind of speed difference this could make, but really given that you return Python lists I would say that it does not change much.

Oh, actually Marc Mezzarobba taught me a nice profiling trick that I would like to use right here to see if the most time consuming operation is this multiplication, let me check !!!

Okay, first most of the time is spent over-wrapping the result and not computing stuff. I love combinat code.

```
sage: sage: %time _=list(Partitions(100,length=8))
CPU times: user 20 s, sys: 56 ms, total: 20.1 s
Wall time: 19.9 s
sage: sage: %time _=list(ZS1_iterator_nk(100-8,8))
CPU times: user 796 ms, sys: 0 ns, total: 796 ms
Wall time: 797 ms
```

Ahem. Anyway `:-P`

And it seems to still be the case when you call `ZS1_iterator`, i.e. mostof the time is Python time.

Replacing all of the "yield the partition" with "yield x[h-1]" (so that it does not create lists all the time) gives...

Oh. I am not very sure of what I  read in the profiling, but it looks like having a Python list x instead of a C one has a cost : each time you read one of its elements, this element is a "python object" and not a C integer. So whatever you do with it is a python operation. 

I now use the C code which replaces this python list x with a C array... Okay, now the bottle neck seems the moments when the iterator yields a value, which has to be converted to a Python integer before being returned.

Ahahaha. And no multiplication has appeared yet unless I misread something.

Nice. 

It's funny to profile code `:-)`

Soooooooooooo there are two things to remember, I believe :

1) The optimization above would change nothing to the current code's speed

2) This code is combinat code, all its effort is made toward ONE objective : generating new objects, creating new classes, making use of metaclasscall

3) If you want MUCH better performances, call ZS1 directly

4) It seems that you can go very very far with this code if you do everything at C level. I mean, if someday you want to run serious computations this code is good, but what you should do is work on the Cython code directly and don't wait for it to return its data at Python level.

Wow.

Cool `:-)`

Well, I think I should go eat something now. Thank you very much for this code, and have a nice day ! `:-)`

There are two things that slow it down:

- checking to make sure it is a valid partition (something which I'd think you'd advocate), and
- striping trailing 0's (i.e. standardizing the data, which again I'd think you'd advocate).

As I recall, there's code out there that assumes that initialization of a partition always does these (one of these) two operations (both of which need to loop over each partition), so we can't refactor this away completely. I also don't like passing these (IMO stupid) 'check' arguments.

Here's my data:

The check of containment in `NN` is actually pretty good:

```
sage: f = int(5)
sage: %timeit f in ZZ
100000 loops, best of 3: 5.33 µs per loop
sage: %timeit f in NN
1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.95 µs per loop
```
Remember that Sage's preparser wraps a number as an `Integer`, so the following is unfair:

```
sage: %timeit 5 in ZZ # quick parent check
1000000 loops, best of 3: 476 ns per loop
sage: %timeit 5 in NN
100000 loops, best of 3: 2.04 µs per loop
```
I also tried my usual optimizing of using enumerate and `if not mu` for `len(mu) == 0` and it didn't seem to result in a noticeable speedup.

Also your test is unfair because we have to do extra processing on the result from iterator to get the actual partition we wanted.

So in the end, we'll have to sit down on a separate ticket and optimize partition creation someday, but not today.

However I'm not surprised you see the slowdown in using a list in python as opposed to C. Python is slow compared to C because of it's interpreted/weakly-typed/higher-level nature.

PS - Nathann, that's 4 things `:P`

Well, I advocate a great many things. In this case I would advocate to make those test optional, so that they can be disabled when needed, i.e. here.

What do you have against those `check` parameters ? Their point is precisely to avoid useless tests. How can they do any harm ? `O_o`

You mean add a +1 ? and a few extra cells ?
I can do that in C if you prefer. Do you bet that the time does not change ? `:-P`

We could just replace the "yield x[:m+1]" with a yield `[x[i]+1 for i in range(k)]` and we would be done `:-P`

hey man, once more I am not saying that it is badly written or anything. You just want to make everything too general, too abstract, and well, you pay it. Can't do without it. That's why I will always feel better playing with a `int * partition` than with a Sage object.

It's just funny that we were wondering how to avoid a multiplication while anything we can  save is lost 99999 times by the code above it.

> However I'm not surprised you see the slowdown in using a list in python as opposed to C. Python is slow compared to C because of it's interpreted/weakly-typed/higher-level nature.

Ahahahah. Yeah, you are right.... But I did not expect it at this moment. Must be why it's nice to actually profile code instead of think about it and optimize multiplications.

> PS - Nathann, that's 4 things `:P`

The problem with lists is that I write them top-to-bottom and that the numbers change from time to time while I write stuff `:-P`
