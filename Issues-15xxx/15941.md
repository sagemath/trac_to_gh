Occurs when elements are RealIntervalField intervals containing zero.

```
sage: matrix(((1,0),(0,1)))*vector((RIF(-1,1),RIF(-1,1)))
(0, 0)
sage: _ == vector((RIF(0), RIF(0)))
True
```

Seems likely this is due to applying a zero test that is not valid for interval terms.

It is not a coercion issue: the above behaves identically when the matrix elements are made explicitly RIF.
