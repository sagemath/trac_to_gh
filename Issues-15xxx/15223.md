Andrey told me about the following problem. When he implemented toric lattices, he inherited a `.construction()` method from general lattices. Consequence: If he tried to add elements of two different toric lattices, then Sage applied a pushout construction and added the two elements after pushing them to `ZZ^2`, which was not what he wanted.

His solution was, I think, the correct one: He overloaded the `.construction()` method, so that it now returns `None`.

Update: A similar problem also showed up in #30360.

Suggestion: Introduce a test of the `TestSuite` of a parent P, that will complain if P.construction() returns a pair `F, O` such that `F(O)!=P`.

I think this test should be put into ~~`sage.structure.parent.Parent`~~ (Update 9.2: `sage.categories.sets_cat`), because this is where `.construction()` is defined in the first place.

<div id="comment:1" align="right">comment:1</div>

I did not run the full test suite yet, but I already detected several bugs in `.construction()`. So, introducing this test really is a good idea.

Until now, I found:

1. Boolean polynomial rings:

   ```
   sage: P.<x0, x1, x2, x3> = BooleanPolynomialRing(4,order='degrevlex(2),degrevlex(2)')
   sage: P.construction()
   (MPoly[x0,x1,x2,x3], Finite Field of size 2)
   sage: F, O = P.construction()
   sage: F(O)
   Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x0, x1, x2, x3 over Finite Field of size 2
   sage: P
   Boolean PolynomialRing in x0, x1, x2, x3
   ```
   Suggested solution: A boolean polynomial ring is, after all, a quotient of a polynomial ring. So, it should be constructed as such, but the `QuotientFunctor` should be provided with an additional attribute making it notice that a boolean polynomial ring shall be returned.

2. Integer mod rings that are initialised in a non-default category:

   ```
   sage: P = IntegerModRing(19, category = Fields())
   sage: F,O = P.construction()
   sage: F(O)
   Ring of integers modulo 19
   sage: P
   Ring of integers modulo 19
   sage: F(O) == P
   False
   ```
   Why is this? Well, providing a different category changes the class of P (this is how the category framework works), and the `__cmp__` method of integer mod rings checks for the class. And the construction functor `F` is not aware of the category of `P`.

   Suggested solutions: Change `__cmp__` such that `F(O)` evaluates equal to `P`, even though `F(O)` is not in the category of fields, or alternatively make the construction functor aware of the category, so that `F(O)` actually *is* in the category of fields.

And I am to blame for a third problem, that is actually fairly similar to the second problem mentioned above. It is in my thematic tutorial on categories and coercion.

- I create a parent class inheriting from `UniqueRepresentation`.
- The parent class has a construction functor that keeps track of the "important" arguments needed to reconstruct the parent.
- I create one instance P of the parent class using an additional "unimportant" argument, namely a category.

Consequence: When trying to reconstruct P using the construction functor, the "unimportant" argument is missing, and hence `UniqueRepresentation` believes that a new instance needs to be created. After all, for `UniqueRepresentation`, *all* arguments are important parts of the cache key.

I have to think how to solve this.

I just added Nicolas to this ticket, since it relates not only with coercion (this is the component of this ticket) but also with categories.

In a nutshell: If P is a parent, then `P.construction()` should return None, or a pair F,O, where F is a construction functor and O is some object.

The contract is that `F(O)==P`. But nobody has checked this contract so far. The original aim of this ticket is to introduce a test.

While we are at it, I thought one could improve `QuotientFunctor`. First of all, it *must* allow to pass additional arguments to the quotient being constructed. For example, the construction functor for `IntegerModRing(19, category=Fields())` must know that the category is specialised. Similarly, the construction functor for `BooleanPolynomialRing(...)` must know that the result is not just a quotient of a polynomial ring, but has a special implementation.

And something else that I want to improve with the `QuotientFunctor`: Currently, it is a functor from Rings() to Rings(). But why?? Perhaps, at some point, we want to apply the `QuotientFunctor` in the context of groups!

Hence, I think it would make sense to be more precise when choosing the domain and codomain of the functor.

Today, I experimented with this idea: If Q is a quotient, and `F,O=Q.construction()`, then the quotient functor F should go from `O.category()` to `Q.category()`.

But when running the tests, it turns out that this is too narrow: Sometimes, we want to apply the quotient functor F to a ring over a *different* base ring.

This makes me think of the following: Would it make sense to introduce a method of categories `C.without_parameters()`, returning the join of all super-categories of C that are not instances of `CategoryWithParameters`?

For example, for `C = Category.join([EnumeratedSets(),Algebras(QQ)])`, `C.without_parameters()` would return `Join of Category of rings and Category of enumerated sets`.

Nicolas, do you think it would hurt to introduce such method here?

Isn't that going to be a problem?

```
sage: A=IntegerModRing(19, category=Fields())
sage: B=IntegerModRing(19)
sage: B in Fields()
True
```
After this isn't the category of `B` refined to fields? And doesn't that then mean that A and B are the same, and hence should be identical? But if UniqueRepresentation takes the category argument into account, they won't be identical.

This sounds like a good idea indeed! I would tend to put the test in
Sets (in the general trend that there is already too much stuff in
Parent; and maybe construction should be moved there, so as to make it
easier to overload it, e.g. in some categories).

It would make sense as well for the test to accept the case where
`construction` is an undefined abstract method. But maybe we don't
have a use case for now.

This does not seem directly related to this ticket. Could this easily

This seems like a sensible method; so if you have a use for it, go
ahead.

It is:

sage: A==B
False

True
```

No, it doesn't (to my surprise, I actually thought they *should* be recognised as equal now):

sage: A.category() == B.category()

```

No, it is not UniqueRepresentation:

```

I am not so sure about this. `.construction()` is one of the places where mathematics and implementation meet: On the one hand, `.construction()` returns a functor (or at least something that pretends to be a functor), which is a mathematical notion. On the other hand, the construction functors are quite clearly *also* responsible for choosing implementations. For example, the fact that the following pushout uses *dense* power series rings is entirely due to construction functors:

```
sage: Ps.<x> = PowerSeriesRing(QQ, sparse=True)
sage: Pd.<x> = PowerSeriesRing(ZZ, sparse=False)
sage: Pd['y'].has_coerce_map_from(Ps['y'])
False
sage: pushout(Ps['y'],Pd['y'])
Univariate Polynomial Ring in y over Power Series Ring in x over Rational Field
sage: pushout(Ps['y'],Pd['y']) == Ps['y']
False
```

But if it is (partially) about implementation, then I believe its place is not in `Sets.ParentMethods`.

Probably better. I am actually not sure if it would be a good idea to modify the quotient functor in that way.

Hi Simon,

I am not sure how to just take a part of your last commit, but you can do the following:
While you're on your current development branch, write git branch new_branch to start a new branch pointing to the current commit.
Then go back to the old branch via git checkout old_branch and either delete manually the changes you don't want to to have on that branch or go back to a previous commit via
git reset --hard first_few_digits_of_sha_to_revert_to
You can then recommit some of the changes or just start working from there again.

This probably doesn't do exactly what you want, but it might be a start.

Thank you!

I had already started before your answer came. That's to say, I have stored `git diff HEAD~ HEAD` into a file `tmp.patch`, then manually reverted the changes that I didn't like, did `git add <changed_files>` and `git commit --amend`. And now, I should be able to create a branch for a different ticket, and apply the relevant changes stored in `tmp.patch`.

Since I didn't push the "wrong" commit to trac (in particular, clearly no other branch on trac will use my wrong commit), I guess it is ok to do `git commit --amend`, although it changes SHA1.

That doesn't tell the entire story, though:

```
sage: type(IntegerModRing).mro()
[sage.rings.finite_rings.integer_mod_ring.IntegerModFactory,
 sage.structure.factory.UniqueFactory,
 sage.structure.sage_object.SageObject,
 object]
```
so perhaps the *object* isn't really UniqueRepresentation but the *system* tries to implement the semantics via a factory. So I think you're seeing exactly the problem I was afraid of:

```
sage: A1=IntegerModRing(19)
sage: A2=IntegerModRing(19)
sage: B1=IntegerModRing(19,category=Fields())
sage: B2=IntegerModRing(19,category=Fields())
sage: A1 is A2
True
sage: B1 is B2
True
sage: A1 in Fields()
True
sage: type(A1)
<class 'sage.rings.finite_rings.integer_mod_ring.IntegerModRing_generic_with_category'>
sage: type(B1)
<class 'sage.rings.finite_rings.integer_mod_ring.IntegerModRing_generic_with_category'>
sage: type(A1) == type(B1)
False
```
so after this we do have two functionally equivalent copies of the same ring: `A1,B1`, but they are not identical. Furthermore, their types are not identical or equal either, but it's hard to see what the difference is between them (note `A1.__cmp__` to see that this last `False` is the reason why `A1 != B1`.

Allowing categories to be refined on "global" (uniqueified) objects implies that the `category` argument needs to be ignored on lookup during the uniqueification. You can't really control the category anyway:

```
sage: A1=IntegerModRing(19,category=Rings())
sage: A1.category()
Join of Category of commutative rings and Category of subquotients of monoids and Category of quotients of semigroups
sage: A1 in Fields()
True
sage: A2=IntegerModRing(19,category=Rings())
sage: A2.category()
Join of Category of subquotients of monoids and Category of quotients of semigroups and Category of fields
```

Should specifying the category even be allowed anyway? What can be achieved by doing so? You can get horrible nonsense:

```
sage: A=IntegerModRing(16,category=Fields())
sage: P.<x>=A[]
sage: P in UniqueFactorizationDomains()
True
sage: (2*x+1)^8
1
```
Of course if you do this, you're just asking for the insanity. Normally everything is fine:

```
sage: B=IntegerModRing(16)
sage: Q.<x>=B[]
sage: Q in UniqueFactorizationDomains()
False
```
But it does mean that if `B` here were to be identical to `A`, then the first example would permanently poison the sage session with nonsense. So I'd think `IntegerModRing(16,category=Fields())` should produce an error.

And that's why I think it is a good idea that *all* given arguments, including the category, are taken into the cache key of the factory. That way, it won't matter if you put a non-field into the category of fields, because you are still able to create a "sane" version of the same ring.

I don't think so. And in any case, it should be on a different ticket.

Hm. But the more I think about it...:

In the `__cmp__` method of `IntegerModRing`, it is said:

```
        if type(other) is not type(self):   # so that GF(p) =/= Z/pZ
            return cmp(type(self), type(other))
        return cmp(self.__order, other.__order)
```

Note the comment: The aim is to let `GF(p)` and `Z/pZ` evaluate unequal. This gives rise to two questions:

1. Do we really want that they evaluate unequal?

   We have

   ```
   sage: GF(5).has_coerce_map_from(IntegerModRing(5))
   True
   sage: IntegerModRing(5).has_coerce_map_from(GF(5))
   False
   ```
   Since there is no coercion in both directions, the two rings can not be equal. So, I'd say `GF(5)!=IntegerModRing(5)` is correct, or at least consistent.

2. Do we really want that `IntegerModRing(5)` and `IntegerModRing(5,category=Fields())` evaluate unequal?

   This time, the coercions exist in both directions:

   ```
   sage: IntegerModRing(5).has_coerce_map_from(IntegerModRing(5, category=Fields()))
   True
   sage: IntegerModRing(5, category=Fields()).has_coerce_map_from(IntegerModRing(5))
   True
   ```
   Hence, we might want to let them evaluate equal.

I see the following options:

- Make it so that integer mod rings with the same modulus evaluate equal, regardless of their type and category. This would be in spite of the comment in the code of `__cmp__`.
- Change `__cmp__` so that integer mod rings evaluate equal if and only if there is a coercion in both directions. Hence, `GF(5)` and `ZZ.quo(5)` would evaluate unequal, but `IntegerModRing(5, category=...)` would all evaluate equal, independent of the category.
- Change `_coerce_map_from_`, so that there is a coercion in both directions if and only if the two integer mod rings evaluate equal. Hence, `IntegerModRing(5, category=...)` would all be distinct, for different categories.
- Do not allow to put in a "category" argument. But then, we might want to learn the rationale of introducing the argument in the first place. After all, if the modulus of integer mod ring R is a prime number, then asking `R in Fields()` will return true. So, if one knows during creation of the ring that the modulus is prime, one might use `GF(p)` instead of `IntegerModRing(p,category=Fields())`.

Further ways to go? In any case, there should be a new ticket.

How embarrassing!

I just used `git blame` to find out who introduced the use of a "category" argument for integer mod rings---and found that it was **I**, namely in #9138.

I hope #9138 gives a rationale...

`IntegerModRing` is not mentioned in the discussion of #9138. But in the patch, I found that providing the category as an additional argument used to be a "todo". Namely, before #9138, we had this:

```
sage: FF = IntegerModRing(17, category = Fields()) # todo: not implemented 
sage: FF.category()
Join of Category of fields and Category of finite enumerated sets
sage: TestSuite(FF).run()                          # todo: not implemented
```

So, this yields to the question: Why has it been a "todo"? Nicolas, did you added this "todo"?

It seems that it became "todo" in #8562. And there is a discussion [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/IeIeHsnNIf4). It seems indeed that in this discussion there was an agreement that
1. one should not do primality test when creating the `IntegerModRing`
2. calling `is_field()` will do a primality test, and it was even suggested to update the category to `Fields()`, which actually has been impossible at that time
3. it should be possible for the user to assert that the modulus is prime, *without* using `GF(n)`. And, by the way, note that `GF(n)` would by default do a factorisation of `n`, and I don't know if it is possible for the user to skip this.

What do I conclude from this?

- Given 3., I see why people want to work with `IntegerModRing(n,category=Fields())` instead of `GF(n)` when they know that the huge number n is prime.
- Given 2., it might make sense to call `_refine_category` in `is_field` (and not only by 'R in Fields()') when the primality test succeeds.
- Given the cited discussion, it seems that the existence of an optional `category` argument is good.
- Providing the category `Fields()` at creation time should have the same effect as refining the category to `Fields()`. Namely, at the moment, the categories of `IntegerModRing(5,category=Fields())` and `IntegerModRing(5)` after `... in Fields()` are different.

And I am stuck with the following questions:

- Should the choice of a category play a role in testing equality for integer mod rings?
- Would we like that there is precisely *one* instance of an integer mod ring for a given modulus, that is automatically updated if the user later provides more information? What I mean is this:

  ```
  sage: R = IntegerModRing(5)
  sage: R.category()
  Join of Category of commutative rings and Category of subquotients of monoids and Category of quotients of semigroups and Category of finite enumerated sets
  sage: S = IntegerModRing(5, category=Fields())
  sage: R is S
  True
  sage: R.category()
  Join of Category of fields and Category of subquotients of monoids and Category of quotients of semigroups and Category of finite enumerated sets
   ```

__Suggested way to proceed__

- I open a new ticket implementing the conclusions formulated above.
- Depending on your answers to my questions, I open another new ticket to address them.
- I make these one or two tickets a dependency for this ticket.

#15229 is ready for review (hint). I have merged #15229 into this branch, and rebased this branch, which was needed, as #15229 introduced a new convention for teaching to an integer mod ring that it is a field.

For me all tests pass. Hence, this one is ready for review, too!

The failures do not look deterministic. With the current state of your branch, all tests passed when I did `sage -t integer_mod_ring.py` for the first time. Then I tried again and repeatedly got:

But I'm unable to reproduce this behaviour from the sage command line.

I will run the tests again after rebuilding sage from scratch.

And I'm also unable to reproduce it when I first build `develop` from scratch, and then merge in your branch and do an incremental build.

Perhaps a bug of 5.12.x that was fixed since them and resurfaced randomly in my tests due to problems with incremental builds, then?

Ahahahaha! It looks like the same example (modulus 15) was used in a different example to demonstrate that one can erroneously claim that `IntegerModRing(15)` is a field, and it could be that by random order of executing the tests this false information was cached. To be on the safe side, we could empty the cache.

Concerning the error with residue fields:

```
sage: K.<z> = CyclotomicField(7)
sage: P = K.factor(17)[0][0]
sage: ff = K.residue_field(P)
sage: ff.construction()
(AlgebraicExtensionFunctor, Finite Field of size 17)
sage: F,R = _
sage: F(R)
Finite Field in zbar of size 17^6
sage: ff
Residue field in zbar of Fractional ideal (17)
sage: ff.order()
24137569
sage: F(R).order()
24137569
```

So, the construction of a residue field just yields a finite field, not a residue field. Either the algebraic extension functor needs information of whether it is a residue field or not, or we need a "residue field functor". I wouldn't like to see the latter, since it is clearly no functor. OK, it would also be possible to kill the construction of residue fields.

The algebraic extension functors already have a version to construct cyclotomic fields. It should be straight forward to make them deal with residue fields, too.

With the new commit, the construction of field extensions is fixed.

Problem was: Finite fields may have different implementations (givaro, pari_ffelt, ...), but this was ignored in the construction of the construction functor. Now, the implementation is tracked in the construction functor.

One complication: When we merge the construction functors, we need to choose among the implementations. I decided (for now) to always rely on the *default* implementation upon merging. 

__Rationale__

- The situation is not worse than before. Without the latest commit, applying the construction functor of a finite field would *always* use the default implementation. With the latest commit, applying the construction functor of a finite field F will use the implementation that was used for F. Only if a new construction functor is created by merging two functors (which may happen in the pushout construction), the default implementation will be used, 

- We can't rely on a custom implementation in the merged functor, since a custom implementation may not be available for a non-prime field, that could be the result of merging.

Im my opinion (some people might disagree), yes, you should, since it is very unlikely that anyone has based anything on the last state of your branch. There is no need to be religious about history rewrites, one just needs to avoid forcing people to do rebases.

To remove the merge commit, just do `git rebase HEAD^ --onto HEAD^^` on your branch (and then `git push -f` to push the modified branch to trac).

Thank you! Can you briefly explain to me the differences between `^HEAD`, `HEAD^` and `HEAD~`? I keep forgetting what is what.

The last two specify revisions (commits): `rev^k` is the `k`-th parent of `rev`; `rev~k` is the grand<sup>`k`</sup>-first-parent of `rev`; `rev^` and `rev~` are shorthands `rev^1` == `rev~1`.

`^rev` is something different: it is used to specify lower bounds of ranges of revisions. For example, `rev1 rev2 ^rev3` is the set of all ancestors of `rev1` or `rev2` that are not ancestors of `rev3`.

Uh, I said I had not really tested my patches, but I thought I had run the tests from the few most relevant files, sorry.

It is not clear to me on what kinds of objects this functor can be called with `residue != None`. It may be good enough for this ticket to take care of the cases that currently work...
