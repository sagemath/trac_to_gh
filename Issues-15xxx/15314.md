See this [ask.sagemath](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/3115/density-plot-aspect-ratio) question. It is a bug in Sage. The following example from there reproduces the bug:

```python
k = 1.381E-023
T = 300
q = 1.602E-019
var('ue')
De(ue) = ue*k*T/q
var('tau')
Le = (tau*10^-9*De)^(1/2)
D = density_plot(Le*10^4, (tau, 0, 3), (ue, 0, 500), cmap="jet")
D.show(aspect_ratio=0.05)
```
