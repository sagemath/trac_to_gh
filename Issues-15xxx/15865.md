If I have a fraction field, how do I find the ring whose fraction field it is? Note that, since a fraction field sometimes serves several base rings at the same time, this can mean:

- the base ring from which the fraction field was constructed (possibly thread-unsafe?);

- a "canonical" base ring for which the fraction field can be constructed;

- or anything inbetween.

I'm not sure which of these are feasible; I'd be happy with a method that returns me a polynomial ring if I apply it to the fraction field of said polynomial ring. There is the `_base` attribute which seems to give the base ring, but I'd prefer an exposed method.

I assume this also does the trick:

```
sage: g = FractionField(PolynomialRing(QQ, ['x']))
sage: parent(g.zero().numerator())
Rational Field
```
but it feels like a hack...

There's the somewhat unclearly named `base()` method:

```
sage: g = FractionField(QQ['x'])
sage: g.base()
Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Rational Field
sage: g.base_ring()
Rational Field
```

Thanks! What about adding some doc like this:

```
Return the base of ``self``.

This means a reasonable choice of a ring `R` such that
``self`` is the fraction field of ``self``. For instance,
if ``self`` is the fraction field of a polynomial ring,
then ``self.base()`` is said polynomial ring (as opposed
to ``self.base_ring()``, which is the base ring over
which the polynomial ring is defined).

.. WARNING::

    This might not be the ring *you* used to construct
    ``self``. For instance:

        sage: QQ.base() # not ZZ
        Rational Field
        sage: Frac(Frac(PolynomialRing(QQ, 'x'))).base()
        Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Rational Field
```

(Note that it is not the parent of self.zero().numerator()...)

Hmm....I think we maybe should have a more clearly named method such as `fraction_field_base()` for all fraction fields. Oh also I remembered:

```
sage: g = FractionField(QQ['x'])
sage: g.construction()
(FractionField, Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Rational Field)
```

Although on another ticket we decided to have the fraction field of Laurent polynomials be the fraction field of usual polynomials (I forget the number currently, but I can find it if you want).
