After downloading Sage 6.0 either from git or from the `.tar.gz` sdist tarball, the prereq tarball `prereq-1.2.tar.gz` is missing. This is a huge problem, because many checks are skipped because of this.

Integrating this was probably overlooked in the sage-git build system. I think the best solution is not have prereq as a tarball at all and simply integrate the *contents* of the former prereq tarball in the git repo.

Actually `prereq-1.2.tar.gz` should work if you drop it into the `upstream` directory, but since it was different, it didn't receive any of the extra treatment the other packages got.

I don't think there is a regression to be fixed there. It's true that `python setup.py` is run indeed because of my patch, but why is that a problem? I never liked the `[ -z "$$SAGE_INSTALL_FETCH_ONLY" ]` in `build/deps` and I want to remove that. The only reason I didn't do that on this ticket is to avoid potential merge conflicts. And reusing the `$(INST)/sage` build rule to copy the sources makes both `build/deps` and `sage-sdist` harder to understand for no good reason.

So my proposal is still to merge my patch as-is, but of course I'm listening to suggestions...

It requires that all of the sage libraries dependencies to already be built (otherwise it will bail). Before this branch, you could clone a sage repository, and without running `make`, you could run (without error) `sage -sdist`.

This was not true back in mercurial land, but then again, `sage-sdist` had to be a lot more complicated since there were a number of repositories to manage.

I think that the best solution to these issues are to include the package type (and dependencies) in the metadata of each individual package. Right now you have to do this psuedo-build to pull just the standard packages (since the only thing that records them as standard is that they are a dependency of sage in `build/deps`).

I would propose my additional commit for now (or some alternative to restore `sage -sdist` for freshly cloned repos), and open a new ticket to introduce the extra metadata.

Of course it fails, installing from `git` now requires a recent enough version of autotools (this is true for many projects, it's not the fault of Sage).

If you're bothered by this, you could drop the `git` builder on `mod` and only build from the source tarball (which doesn't require autotools).

Do we really need ac 2.63, which is only about 5 years old? 2.61 doesn't work? Also I don't see the new dependency being documented.

No objections in principle. But this tarball should not be treated like other "upstream" tarballs. I prefer a direct call to `sage-download-file`, without going through `sage-spkg` and checksum checking.

I think creating this tarball should be left to `sage --sdist`, I don't see the point of recreating it every time you run `autoconf`.

If we want to treat that tarball like all other tarballs then we need to commit its checksum *before* running `sage -sdist`. Also, for testing it would be nice to run the new tarball through the buildbot before releasing it. Of course that can be worked around by running `sage -sdist` twice but then thats hardly ideal. 

And while one could treat it completely different from the other tarballs, I don't see why we have to give up checksumming here.

Because checksumming is done is `sage-spkg` and this tarball wouldn't `sage-spkg`. And I would very much be against using `sage-spkg` for this, since it would be the upside-down world.

I don't understand what you're saying here. We need a script that
1. does not depend on configure output
2. downloads a tarball
but that script does not need to
1. check checksums
2. run `spkg-install`

I also really don't want to come up with an overkill solution for this. Personally, I'd be happy to simply say "if you want to build from `git`, make sure you have autotools installed". There's always the source tarball which doesn't require autotools and once you've built Sage, you could install the autotools package, or simply hope that an outdated `configure` script is still fine.

I thought you were using a private git repo for the buildbot? In that case, you could easily do the version bump only in your private repo. Alternatively, point `$SAGE_UPSTREAM` to a place you control.

My philosophy with the buildbot was to always test the **exact** source tarball that I would release. If you're testing first, then changing the version number, then `sdist`, something could go wrong in those last two steps and you would never notice.

And yes, there has been at least one bug which dependended on the length of the Sage version number, so it can happen.

Why not the following workflow:
1. In volker's private repo, bump the version number and merge various patches
2. Run `sage --sdist` to generate the configure tarball
3. Put the configure tarball in some accessible place
4. Run the buildbots on Volker's private repo
5. If tests pass, merge Volker's repo with the official repo.

(Ideally, I would argue there should also be a 4b. Run at least one buildbot on the source tarball instead of the git repo)

What alternative would you propose? You need to generate the configure tarball anyway before you can test it, regardless of any version bumps...

Since we don't put the version into `AC_INIT` we don't have to bump the tarball at all with each version. Not doing anything is always the easiest and least error-prone.

Just increment configure-n.tar, configure-(n+1).tar, ... each time you have to re-run autoconf (i.e. `make configure` / `autogen.sh`).

That's "fixed" in #15606, but it's not really important anyway.

> Not doing anything is always the easiest and least error-prone.

I disagree. Doing the same thing every time (i.e. always changing the version number) is always the easiest and least error-prone. Special cases are often the cause for errors.

> Just increment configure-n.tar, configure-(n+1).tar, ... each time you have to re-run autoconf (i.e. make configure / autogen.sh).

And how are you going to implement this auto-incrementing and keeping track of which number to use... this seems far more complicated than my proposal.

One could argue that the new version "starts" right after the old tag. The first commit after sage-6.1.beta4 belongs to sage-6.1.beta5, so I would find it logical that checking out that commit would give the new version number.

Given that the [Sage home page](http://www.sagemath.org/) only has links to the source and binary tarballs, I'd say the opposite is true.

> but I don't think there is a point in worrying too much about it.

Perhaps not, but this ticket could certainly break sdists. So if you don't want automated testing, you should at least try building from an sdist generated after this ticket.

Could it be a bug in your build scripts?

It seems you discovered a very old bug. `build/install` adds `SAGE_LOCAL/bin` to the `PATH`, but doesn't change `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`.

I guess disabling maintainer mode is only interesting when you actually run the automake-generated makefile. But we probably should, then. I'll put it in for now.

In any case, we should only run autotools from the bootstrap script. As long as we don't use the automake output there are no timestamp issues.

bootstrap shouldn't call make to do its business, usually it would run automake to generate the makefile. But we can also disentangle that later if you prefer.

AFAIK we do guarantee that "sage -f" works even before building Sage, so that you can install replacements for certain optional build-time dependencies (e.g. ccache). Not using that mechanism means that "make download" won't work, for example. Not to mention that it duplicates the sagemath upstream url, doesn't verify the checksum, etc. I don't necessarily care so much about using it, just wanted to make sure that you thought about the potential downsides of downloading the confball manually.

I was thinking of moving towards a more typical "configure + make" model. Then `./sage -f` should be guaranteed to work only *after* `./configure` but before `make`. What we actually want for optional packages would be something like

```
$ ./configure --enable-ccache --enable-build-gcc --enable-mirror=http://example.com/ --optional-packages=database_gap
$ make
```

Perhaps you are right. But I would indeed prefer to do that later, especially since #15606 changes the bootstrap process also.

I'd say: let's see how things evolve. I will not actively prevent `sage -f` from working.
