After downloading Sage 6.0 either from git or from the `.tar.gz` sdist tarball, the prereq tarball `prereq-1.2.tar.gz` is missing. This is a huge problem, because many checks are skipped because of this.

Integrating this was probably overlooked in the sage-git build system. I think the best solution is not have prereq as a tarball at all and simply integrate the *contents* of the former prereq tarball in the git repo.

My hope is to converge to a more standard build system, so having `./configure` at the top-level makes the most sense. And even if it confuses people, doing `./configure && make` like the usual packages still works.

It requires that all of the sage libraries dependencies to already be built (otherwise it will bail). Before this branch, you could clone a sage repository, and without running `make`, you could run (without error) `sage -sdist`.

This was not true back in mercurial land, but then again, `sage-sdist` had to be a lot more complicated since there were a number of repositories to manage.

I think that the best solution to these issues are to include the package type (and dependencies) in the metadata of each individual package. Right now you have to do this psuedo-build to pull just the standard packages (since the only thing that records them as standard is that they are a dependency of sage in `build/deps`).

I would propose my additional commit for now (or some alternative to restore `sage -sdist` for freshly cloned repos), and open a new ticket to introduce the extra metadata.

Of course it fails, installing from `git` now requires a recent enough version of autotools (this is true for many projects, it's not the fault of Sage).

If you're bothered by this, you could drop the `git` builder on `mod` and only build from the source tarball (which doesn't require autotools).

No objections in principle. But this tarball should not be treated like other "upstream" tarballs. I prefer a direct call to `sage-download-file`, without going through `sage-spkg` and checksum checking.

If we want to treat that tarball like all other tarballs then we need to commit its checksum *before* running `sage -sdist`. Also, for testing it would be nice to run the new tarball through the buildbot before releasing it. Of course that can be worked around by running `sage -sdist` twice but then thats hardly ideal. 

And while one could treat it completely different from the other tarballs, I don't see why we have to give up checksumming here.

Because checksumming is done is `sage-spkg` and this tarball wouldn't `sage-spkg`. And I would very much be against using `sage-spkg` for this, since it would be the upside-down world.

I don't understand what you're saying here. We need a script that
1. does not depend on configure output
2. downloads a tarball
but that script does not need to
1. check checksums
2. run `spkg-install`

I also really don't want to come up with an overkill solution for this. Personally, I'd be happy to simply say "if you want to build from `git`, make sure you have autotools installed". There's always the source tarball which doesn't require autotools and once you've built Sage, you could install the autotools package, or simply hope that an outdated `configure` script is still fine.

I thought you were using a private git repo for the buildbot? In that case, you could easily do the version bump only in your private repo. Alternatively, point `$SAGE_UPSTREAM` to a place you control.

My philosophy with the buildbot was to always test the **exact** source tarball that I would release. If you're testing first, then changing the version number, then `sdist`, something could go wrong in those last two steps and you would never notice.

Why not the following workflow:
1. In volker's private repo, bump the version number and merge various patches
2. Run `sage --sdist` to generate the configure tarball
3. Put the configure tarball in some accessible place
4. Run the buildbots on Volker's private repo
5. If tests pass, merge Volker's repo with the official repo.

(Ideally, I would argue there should also be a 4b. Run at least one buildbot on the source tarball instead of the git repo)

What alternative would you propose? You need to generate the configure tarball anyway before you can test it, regardless of any version bumps...

That's "fixed" in #15606, but it's not really important anyway.

> Not doing anything is always the easiest and least error-prone.

I disagree. Doing the same thing every time (i.e. always changing the version number) is always the easiest and least error-prone. Special cases are often the cause for errors.

> Just increment configure-n.tar, configure-(n+1).tar, ... each time you have to re-run autoconf (i.e. make configure / autogen.sh).

And how are you going to implement this auto-incrementing and keeping track of which number to use... this seems far more complicated than my proposal.

One could argue that the new version "starts" right after the old tag. The first commit after sage-6.1.beta4 belongs to sage-6.1.beta5, so I would find it logical that checking out that commit would give the new version number.

Given that the [Sage home page](http://www.sagemath.org/) only has links to the source and binary tarballs, I'd say the opposite is true.

Perhaps not, but this ticket could certainly break sdists. So if you don't want automated testing, you should at least try building from an sdist generated after this ticket.

AFAIK we do guarantee that "sage -f" works even before building Sage, so that you can install replacements for certain optional build-time dependencies (e.g. ccache).
