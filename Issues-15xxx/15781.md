<a id='comment:12'></a>No issues with the long test, but before I do more specialized testing there are number of things from looking through the code:

1) Fix preamble documentation to be for the helper and not generic projective space

2) Fix copyright date

3) in _fast_possible_periods:

- use a Reference block - see dynamtomic_polynomial (should be able to use the references from other files)

- examples should call _fast_possible_periods

- todo: typo return

- todo: add - more space efficient hash/pointtable

- use is_prime_finite_field

- move import to header of file

4) pass N+1 into into _normalize_coordinates to replace the len(point) calls

5) _mod_inv - description: Find the inverse of the number modulo the given prime.

6) Use the better version of the eigenvale computation (see 14219 lines 2608-2624)

7) also from 14219 

use

return sorted(periods)

instead of

periods=list(periods)
periods.sort()
return(periods)

8)enum points documentation:
Enumerate points in projective space over finite field with given prime and dimension.

<a id='comment:16'></a>The long test and my other functionality tests all pass, but there are two things. One minor, one major.

Minor: I think I was wrong about the reference block. The .pyx files seem to not be part of the docbuild, so I'm a little concerned about the REFERENCE block have possible issues later on. Perhaps that should be returned to the previous method.

Major: There is still a memory issue. The following example:

```
P.<x,y,z,u,v>=ProjectiveSpace(QQ,4)
H=Hom(P,P)
f=H([-38/45*x^2 + (2*y - 7/45*v)*x + (-1/2*y^2 - 1/2*v*y + v^2),-67/90*x^2 + (2*y + 157/90*v)*x - v*y,(-u - v)*z + (-13/30*u^2 + 13/30*v*u + v^2),-1/2*z^2 + (-u + 3/2*v)*z + (-1/3*u^2 + 4/3*v*u),v^2])
print f.possible_periods(prime_bound=[13,30])
```

runs just fine with 15780, but with 15781 very quickly runs out of memory (on my laptop allocated 3Gb). fyi, it take about 8min to complete the example on my laptop under 15780. The function _enum_points is what is consuming all the memory.

Probably something like `git rebase -i 6.2.rc0` (what you called rebases in history were probably merges) and then edit a lot of "pick" to be "squash" instead. If you can squash everything between the addition and the removal of the `.c` file, you'll have the easiest time. If you want to preserve some of the individual commits in between, you'll have to see if you can reorder them.

You'll basically be producing a "fresh" branch that introduces the commits you want to have in there and not the ones you don't. Of course, anybody who has based work on commits you're removing, will have merge conflicts with your new branch, so hopefully no-one did.
