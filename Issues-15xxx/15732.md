Here are some changes to show a (modal) dialog in the case that it's being run from a read-only file system e.g. disk image.

I also included some fixes to warnings.  So that's what those other changes are.

* What versions of OS X have you tested this on so far?  Does it rely on a newer Xcode?  (Just asking.)

It's a file the new Xcode uses to keep track of repositories.  Since we now use git and Xcode understands git, it got created.  Apparently it should be checked in to version control, so I did:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18340453/should-xccheckout-files-in-xcode5-be-ignored-under-vcs

But yes, it *should be* harmless.

> * What versions of OS X have you tested this on so far?  Does it rely on a newer Xcode?  (Just asking.)

I have only tested it on Mavericks, though I intentionally did **not** upgrade the Xcode project so it *should* work with any version of Xcode that it did before.
