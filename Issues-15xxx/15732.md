It's a file the new Xcode uses to keep track of repositories.  Since we now use git and Xcode understands git, it got created.  Apparently it should be checked in to version control, so I did:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18340453/should-xccheckout-files-in-xcode5-be-ignored-under-vcs

But yes, it *should be* harmless.

I have only tested it on Mavericks, though I intentionally did **not** upgrade the Xcode project so it *should* work with any version of Xcode that it did before.
