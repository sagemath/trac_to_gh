The file `sage/libs/pari/gen.pyx` is too big and contains too many different things.  For clarity and maintainability, it should be split into two parts:
- `gen.pyx` containing the class `gen`;
- `pari_instance.pyx` containing the class `PariInstance` and some utility functions;
More cleaning-up will be done in #15461.

I think this ticket is a typical "patchbomb" which should be avoided. In particular, the replacing of the global variables `t0`... and the re-organizing of the `.py(x)` files are both big changes which should be on different tickets. For the former, I already created #11868 for this.

I know.  The problem is that when I started this clean-up operation, it wasn't clear what the end result was going to look like.  I created this ticket -- and the list of separate issues -- only after reaching a state that worked again, and didn't know about #11868.

Is this because the `@cython.final` decorator on an extension type `T` currently does not forbid subtyping `T` in a different Cython module (so that methods can be called directly in the same module, but only via a vtab in a different module)?

If this is what you mean, could the overhead be avoided by making `new_gen()` and `clear_stack()` (which will be responsible for most of the cross-module calls) functions instead of methods?

Here is a new branch which moves `PariInstance` to a separate file and otherwise is close to minimal.

It is true that the Cython-generated code has some overhead in for the cross-module method calls.  I think it is very small, but I will try to do some timings.  Depending on the outcome, it might be reasonable to duplicate a small amount of code to avoid these cross-module calls.  I think it is better to do that as part of #15461, though.
