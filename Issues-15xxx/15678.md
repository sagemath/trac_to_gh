If the word "cygwin" occurs anywhere in their source code (and the configure has that whole section), they have no right to treat you like this.  Vewy wude.   And why wouldn't they want to support Cygwin?

Also, I don't understand why they don't have a web-browsable source.  Or actually, [they do](https://github.com/wch/r-source), but it's not apparently linked from the page...
