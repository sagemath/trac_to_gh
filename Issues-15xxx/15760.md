The `short_vector_list_up_to_length` method of quadratic forms uses GP but the interface is so badly done that the majority of the time is taken up by the Sage interface, and not by the actual computation. Still, even with the new implementation, most time is taken by the conversion from PARI to Sage vectors.

Timings before:

```
sage: qf = QuadraticForm(matrix(3, [2, 1, 1,  1, 2, 1,  1, 1, 2]))
sage: %timeit qf.short_vector_list_up_to_length(100)
1 loops, best of 3: 1.13 s per loop
sage: %timeit qf.short_vector_list_up_to_length(1000)
1 loops, best of 3: 6.74 s per loop
```

Timings after:

```
sage: qf = QuadraticForm(matrix(3, [2, 1, 1,  1, 2, 1,  1, 1, 2]))
sage: %timeit qf.short_vector_list_up_to_length(100)
10 loops, best of 3: 34.4 ms per loop
sage: %timeit qf.short_vector_list_up_to_length(1000)
1 loops, best of 3: 1.03 s per loop
```
