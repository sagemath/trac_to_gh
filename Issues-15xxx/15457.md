Replying to [@vbraun](#comment%3A17):
> IMHO it is bad to keep log files open for extended amounts of time. This is just going to cause problems (depending on the file system) if multiple processes try do do that. And before you say that there is only one cleaner process, the whole point of the logging is to have a log to prove that if things go south again. The Python logging module does not support multiple processes logging to the same file, for the record. But at least it flushes the output.

Having multiple processes append to the same file is indeed subject to race conditions on NFS (but almost everything with NFS has race conditions). However, this is independent of how many processes have the file open, I see no evidence that simply having a file open makes things worse.
