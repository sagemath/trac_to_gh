Complementary to finite sequences, implement infinite sequences associated with a category, and as elements of a suitable paren. This parent class should be abstract, with subclass `GeneratedSequence`, itself as a template to forthcoming subclasses, for example `CFiniteSequenceRing` (#15714), `PFiniteSequence...` (), `AutomaticSequence...` (#13542).
