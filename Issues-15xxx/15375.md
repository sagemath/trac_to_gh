We should add a line

`sage/combinat/root_system/extended_affine_weyl_group`

to `doc/en/reference/combinat/module_list.rst` to get the documentation
into the reference manual. However if we do this we get an error:

```
OSError: [combinat ] extended_affine_weyl_group.py:docstring of 
ExtendedAffineWeylGroup:11: 
ERROR: The "TOPIC" directive may not be used within topics or body elements.
```

I don't find TOPIC used very much in the sage documentation. I do find it used
in combinat/root_system/plot.py, which is a standalone tutorial. Maybe it
can't be used in a docstring. I hoped that changing TOPIC to RUBRIC would work, 
but I tried it and it doesn't.

I'm leaving the status "needs work" since the documentation needs to compile.

(Maybe the problem is the double colon after TOPIC. I don't have time to
try that now.)

Here are some comments on the patch. Mark, can you work on them so we can review them?

- There are several methods in `ExtendedAffineWeylGroup_Class` that do not have documentation or tests.

- I remember that we talked about this at Sage Days 64: can we get rid of `to_ambient` in all the various places?

- `fundamental_groups.py` also does not have full documentation coverage!

- Also

```
pyflakes extended_affine_weyl_group.py
extended_affine_weyl_group.py:940: undefined name 'Infinity'
```

- Many methods in `sage.groups.group_semidirect_product.py` have no documentation.

Best,

Anne

Please add what the INPUT is in the following methods in the extended_affine_weyl_group:

apply_simple_projection
coset_representative
face_data
action
translation_group_morphism
simple_reflection
bruhat_le

There are certain methods that occur multiple times with code that looks only
minimally different (for example in `has_descent` it looks like that only left and
right have changed). Could you explain why one needs the methods in each realization
separately rather than having one general one.

Same in src/sage/groups/group_exp.py. There are methods where some of the input needs to be explained.

Since certain methods are much more efficiently computed in certain realizations,
the generic implementation just consists of converting to the favorable

a direct algorithm is given for more than one realization. This is the case for :meth:has_descent.

Hi Mark,

I rebased your patch on top of sage-6.8.beta4. So please pull the changes before you keep editing!

I see this in the diff without a doc test and a comment:

```
diff --git a/src/sage/combinat/root_system/type_affine.py b/src/sage/combinat/root_system/type_affine.py

Can this be taken out?

When I tried the following, I got an error message

```

Do you want shorthands for all the realizations?

Similarly,

The rebasing weirdness is coming from someone else's code.

For shorthands, the realizations are created by the methods
PW0(), W0P(), WF(), FW(), PvW0(), and W0Pv().
Um, do you think this is insufficiently short?

Implementing generators is easy and I can add that.

You mean the method from_vector_notation? It looks like it belongs to
this patch, but it might be super old. Should we take it out?

Well, I just tried out methods that E.<tab> offered and many of them are not implemented.

That would be good!

Dan, could you also do a final review of this patch? I think it is getting close to being ready.

Hi Mark,

Does this address my original question about

```
sage: E=ExtendedAffineWeylGroup(['A',2,1])
sage: E.group_generators()
```
or are you fixing something else?

Shall we remove `from_vector_notation`?

Best,

Anne

Get rid of from_vector_notation.

Group generators are not relevant for E.
E is not an actual realization.

E.PW0() is a group and so on.

The list method is related to finiteness
(saying "x in G" makes sense if G is a finite group, and iterating over x in G
uses the list method). I somehow got on the wrong
branch and unfixed some stuff and had to refix it.

I would suggest to be consistent with what the category code asks for (in this case group_generators) since this method appears when one hits tab.completion! Otherwise it is confusing to the user.

Hi Mark!

I had a look at the fundamental group code. Thanks for the hard work!

Suggestions:

- Would it be possible to make the code more type-free, in particular
  the initialization? For example, it seems likely to break the
  current version if one uses a relabeled type BC.


- The logic for computing the special nodes would fit more naturally
  in Cartan types rather than here. Please implement that as a method
  `cartan_type.special_nodes()`.

  The special nodes form an orbit under the action of the automorphism
  group of the Dynkin diagram, right? If yes, then it would be enough
  to implement a generic method `CartanType_affine.special_nodes`,
  which would start from the special node as specified by
  `cartan_type.special_node()`, and take its orbit under the
  automorphism group of the Dynkin diagram. It's a small graph, so
  that's cheap enough.

- Maybe add a test that the Cartan type is indeed affine?

- Is the `_element_constructor_` needed at all?

- `lambda i: finite_action_dict[i]` -> `finite_action_dict.__getitem__`

- What about renaming `finite_action_dict`  to `reduced_words`?

- `om` -> `omega` (I believe that's what we use in the crystal code)

  in general, please avoid abbreviations, unless they correspond to
  standard one-letter mathematical notations.

- `..., finite = True)` -> `..., finite=True)`

- The code is currently assuming that the `0` is the "main" special
  node, right?  Please use `cartan_type.special_node()` instead.

- What about fusing the methods `family` and `group_generators`?
  `group_generators` should return a family anyway (unlike `gens`).

- If you put the group in `XXX.FinitelyGenerated()`, the list of
  elements will be recovered from the group generators (of course,
  here we have a more straightforward way of doing it, so that may, or
  not, be how we want to do this).

Thanks!

Nicolas, Thanks very much for your comments.

I need to know the reason behind using `cartan_type.special_node()`.

Let's call this the extra special node. For simplicity we assume untwisted
affine type. By deletion we obtain a subsystem of finite type.
If the extra special node is nonzero then the correct behavior is that
the "classical subsystem" should be a relabeling of the
appropriate standard classical subsystem
with 0 as one of the "finite" Dynkin nodes.
This nonstandard classical Dynkin node set will get propagated to
indices of simple roots and fundamental weights and to the
finite Weyl groups.  In particular we could see
t_{\omega_0^\vee} as a nontrivial translation element
and s_0 as an element of the finite Weyl group.
Do we really want this?

It's indeed nice to have 0 by default for the special node in the
canonical labeling of the Dynkin diagram, in order to follow the usual
conventions in the literature.

But other than that the code has been designed to be agnostic
w.r.t. the labels of the nodes of the Dynkin diagram. This gives the
user the flexibility to use his preferred labeling, without imposing a
given convention. Also it makes the code robust in potential use cases
like the following:

- The user inputs some Cartan matrix which turns out to be
  affine. There is no reason a priori that 0 will be a special node.
  (note: at some point we will need/want to implement the logic to
  recover some special node).

- We have a big KM Dynkin diagram, and we want to do some calculations
  involving a parabolic subgroup. Typically the corresponding Dynkin
  diagram is disconnected, and the calculation will boil down to the
  connected pieces. Those connected pieces could be affine Dynkin
  diagrams, but with labels like 3,4,5; still we might want to use
  it's fundamental group, etc ...

Cheers,
                               Nicolas

Good point. To avoid having both `__iter__` and `__list__` you can just do:

```
def __iter__(self):
    return iter(self.group_generators())
```

Note the use of `iter` rather than `for ... yield` (should be faster).

Also, default list method will already raise an error for you if the set is in `XXX.Infinite()`.

Thanks!

I think I am done messing with this ticket for now.
I added an explicit an_element method; the default one always gives the identity, which leads to less interesting example elements for doctests. So I did this and fixed the doctests.

Hi Mark!

I have glanced half way through the patch. It's a lot of hard work you
did; thanks! I'll try to go through the over half soon, but won't have
the time for a systematic review, so please someone!

Here are some thoughts that popped up; take them as they just are:
random food for thoughts. If something does not sound applicable, just
ignore it.

- `weyl_groups.py` line 420,453: any reason to remove the test for s2s1s2s1?
- `RootSystem(XXX.cartan_type())` -> `XXX.cartan_type().root_system()`

- `def to_ambient_space_morphism`: you can use
  `sage.misc.c3_controlled.identity`. Yeah, there is no reason why the
  identity function is defined in this module; but at least if we all
  use the same identity function it will be easier to refactor later
  on.

  Variants, if you want a morphism: `End(self).identity()` or `sage:
  self.coerce_map_from(self)`,

- `..warning` -> `.. WARNING`

- In `to_weight_space`: instead of going through a vector, one can use
  `.sum_of_terms([i,self.scalar(alpha[i])] for ...`

  This method is generic and would better be in `WeightSpaceRealizations`.

- `to_ambient`

- `special_nodes`: any reason not to use `return autos.orbit(self.special_node())` ?

- `Nicolas Thiery` -> `Nicolas M. Thiery` for consistency

- Doc of `ExtendedAffineWeylGroup`: use `.. MATH` for the math
  formulas on their own line.

- `... the following lattices:`; idem for `E` below.

- When natural, put the `::` at the end of the sentence.

- Line folding could be more consistent

- There are still quite a few of `ifs` depending on
  twisted/untwisted/GL; any chance to make this more generic?

  For example, to define the special translation covector can't we
  generically use something like `c[special_node] *
  _special_root.associated_coroot()`? I never remember from the top of
  my head whether it's `c` or one of its friends that should be used
  here, but we did things like this in the MacDo code.

  Note that at this point the initialization of
  `ExtendedAffineWeylGroup_class` will probably break on a relabelled
  type BC.

- Do we need the `special_nodes` method on the group and the
  fundamental group? Or could just have it on the cartan type?

- Strip new lines just before and just after the end of the
  documentation string.

- `classical_weyl` -> `classical`? or `classical_weyl_group`?
  I don't remember what we did in similar situations for crystals
  and the like, but please check for consistency.

- `classical_weyl_to_affine_morphism`: the name is misleading since
  the result is not a morphism. Could we have a name like
  `from_classical` or make this an element method `to_affine`?
  Same for the related methods.

- `cardinality` is already provided by `Sets().Infinite()`

- `group_generators` this could in principle go in
  `Groups().WithRealizations()`. If creating the latter just for this
  seems like overkill, you can just add a comment about this.

- `...Realizations.ParentMethods.one`: replacing `PW0` by
  `a_realization` the code would be generic and could go in `Magmas.Unital.Realizations`.

- `Returns` -> `Return`

- `coset_representative, is_grassmanian, ...`: this is the same logic
  as for a usual coxeter group, right? Could we avoid the duplication
  by having a common super category?

- `get_the_index` -> `leading_support`?

- `FundamentalGroup...one`: `0` -> `special_node`

- `an_element`: you can probably use `.last()` (haven't tested)

  - `action`: maybe `representation`? Elsewhere in Sage, `action` is
    usually a method that implements the action itself.

- `root_lattice_realizations`: `Algebras` is now imported twice.


Cheers,
                            Nicolas

I looked at the patchbot shortlogs for the first three machines reporting build failure. They all report the same error:

```
OSError: [combinat ] /home/worker/sage-patchbot/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/combinat/root_system/extended_affine_weyl_group.py:docstring of sage.combinat.root_system.extended_affine_weyl_group.ExtendedAffineWeylGroup_Class.WF_to_PW0_func:11: ERROR: Content block expected for the "WARNING" directive; none found.
```

I think the "Since this is used ..." at line 1068 needs to be indented. Other bots are reporting a doctest error in dev_tools.py. 

```

I suspect this is unrelated to this patch. It may be caused by #18553 which was merged three weeks ago and which touched sage.sets.real_set.py.

However I think the above docstring needs to be fixed and since Nicolas has some comments I'm changing the status back to needs_work.

What happened? It might happen that one cannot push if there is a change on the server that one has not pulled yet. Otherwise I would not know why this happens.

I get the following failure in sage/categories

```

I noticed that the dev_tools doctest that fails is fragile: if you call it from the command line it gives a different result than the doctest.

```

sage: from sage.misc.dev_tools import load_submodules
sage: load_submodules(sage.sets)
load sage.sets.cartesian_product... succeeded
load sage.sets.real_set... succeeded
load sage.sets.set_from_iterator... succeeded

```
Presumably this is because when the doctest is run, sage.sets.real_set has already been loaded.

Since the branch was recently changed to u/mshimo I think Mark is the only one who can make changes now. When it was u/public others could push changes, for example when Anne rebased it.

This is part of my misunderstanding of trac. 

I had trouble pushing to the u/public branch; it was forcing a merge
which was creating weird errors that didn't happen in my local branch.
That is why I made a new copy and put it in a new location, apparently unwittingly
making it nonpublic.

I would like to just clobber (replace) the old u/public branch
with the other one. Can I do that? Is it a bad idea?
I just know that my previous attempts to push to that branch, created weird nonrecognizable errors that were not my code's fault.

The alternative is to make a new public branch.

You should be able to push your local branch to a public one by saying

```
git branch <localname> --set-upstream-to origin/<newremotename>
```
where <newremotename> is something like public/15375 (pick a name different from the old public name just in case). Then you can copy the new branch name in the trac field on the ticket.

My current bet is that this ticket somehow forces
`sage.sets.cartesian_product` to be loaded upon Sage's startup. Hence,
when running `load_submodules(sage.sets)` it does not appear anymore
as the first entry, and instead the output starts with the next one
which turns out to be `sage.sets.real_set`.

If that's confirmed, a good approach would be to make sure that all
the affine Weyl group code is lazy imported. That's a good property to
have anyway.

Cheers,
                                      Nicolas

Mark's last commit did change to lazy import and did not fix the doctest.

I think this may not have to do with what is loaded on startup, but rather what is loaded during other tests coming earlier in the docstring. If this test is moved to the top of the docstring, it will give a different result. See !comment:107.

For me everything builds fine. I ran `sage -testall` and got the following failures

Any conjectures about the patchbot?

I presume that the patchbot merges the patch on top of the develop tip then tries to build. Is that correct? It looks from the log as if it actually tries to merge it with a branch called patchbot/base. There doesn't actually seem to be such a branch in the repository.

On my local computer, I merged in the latest development version sage-6.8.beta6 and everything merged fine. So I think something is wrong with the patchbot.

I am going to set positive review, since we all seem happy with the patch.

There is a huge file called !`doc/output/latex/en/reference/combinat/` and at line 165376 we have the following:

```

There are isomorphisms
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\begin{align*}
¬†¬†¬† W &\cong M \rtimes W_0 \cong W_0 \ltimes M \\
¬†¬†¬† E &\cong L \rtimes W_0 \cong W_0 \ltimes L
\end{align*}\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}\paragraph{Fundamental group of affine Dynkin automorphisms}

```

At this point pdflatex barfs.

As John had mentioned, you need to change:

```diff
-        \begin{align*}
+        \begin{aligned}
             W &\cong M \rtimes W_0 \cong W_0 \ltimes M \\
             E &\cong L \rtimes W_0 \cong W_0 \ltimes L
-        \end{align*}
+        \begin{aligned}
```
and

```diff
     .. MATH::
 
-        \begin{align*}
+        \begin{aligned}
         (g_1,h_1)(g_2,h_2) &= g_1 h_1 g_2 h_2 \\
         &= g_1 g_2 g_2^{-1} h_1 g_2 h_2 \\
         &= (g_1g_2, twist(g_2^{-1}, h_1) h_2)
-        \end{align*}
+        \end{aligned}
```
Also I believe this needs to be changed (there are 2 of theses):

```diff
     .. MATH::
 
-        g h g^{-1} &= \phi(g)(h).
+        g h g^{-1} = \phi(g)(h).
```
