The following produces an error:

```
from sage.matroids.set_system import SetSystem
S=SetSystem([],[])
S._isomorphism(S)
```
_equivalence() has a similar problem.

Hi Nathan, the SetSystem is just an internal datastucture. The end user only has access to them as an iterator over a set of sets, and we reserve the right to replace them with something that does the same job better or faster. But while we have them, they better not fail when they are empty :) Internally, we do use them to test for matroid isomorphism.

Of course it's easy enough to turn these SetSystems into Hypergraphs, since they behave as iterators.

```
M=matroids.named_matroids.NonFano()
H=Hypergraph(M.bases())
```
BTW there seems to be no way to get vertices that are not in some hyperedge into a Hypergraph.

Makes sense !

Well right now hypergraphs do absokutely nothing smart. Some coloring, and some plot with view(). But if some of us want to work on them it would be better to do the job only once ! I only wrote this because I needed it, but some isomorphism check would be nice indeed. Plus basic things like enumerating the vertices, as you say.
