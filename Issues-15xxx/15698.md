Original description was:

The following behaviour is not implemented, example:

```
  sage: R.<t> = QQ[]; A=1/(1-t)
  sage: A.expand(5)
  1+t+t^2+t^3+t^4+t^5+O(t^6)
  sage: A+O(t^6)
  1+t+t^2+t^3+t^4+t^5+O(t^6)
```
Add a parameter to specify the respective series variable (for derivation) then multivariate polynomial fractions can be handled. Result type being a power series. The pari function Ser() implements the same behaviour. Note: I would like to implement this.

<a id='comment:2'></a>The "canonical" syntax for this kind of conversion would be

```
sage: S = QQ[['t']]  # construct power series ring
sage: S(A)           # convert A into it, using default precision
sage: S(A, prec=6)   # or using specified precision
```
However, the last two lines currently fail with

```
TypeError: denominator must be a unit
```
The following does work:

```
sage: L=S.laurent_series_ring()
sage: L(A)
1 + t + t^2 + t^3 + t^4 + t^5 + t^6 + t^7 + t^8 + t^9 + t^10 + t^11 + t^12 + t^13 + t^14 + t^15 + t^16 + t^17 + t^18 + t^19 + O(t^20)
```
Unfortunately, this does not currently accept a precision argument.

I think the easiest solution for `S(A)` is to fix `PowerSeriesRing._element_constructor_()` to accept rational functions.

Anyway, pbruin's example works now. `A.expand()` is then no longer necessary. The only thing that still does not work is addition of power series to fraction, where coercion is needed. I'll leave that for now and ask for your review.

<a id='comment:15'></a>Ok, LGTM. I took the liberty of squashing your three patches and rebasing the whole on top of `develop`; please protest if you disagree.

I had a doubt about the fact of computing the quotient (possibly as a Laurent series) in all cases and then checking that it was in fact a power series, but at least it helps keeping the logic that decides whether the quotient fo two power series is a power series in a single place.
