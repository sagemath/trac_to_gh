Currently, a cached method will always be a wrapper of a function. It will bind a `CachedMethodCaller` to an instance. However, this `CachedMethodCaller` will *not* bind the wrapped function to the instance. But in some cases, we might want to make the function depend on the instance, see #12978, for example.

Therefore, I suggest to store the *bound* version of the wrapped function when binding a `CachedMethodCaller` to an instance. There might be a slight benefit timewise, too:

```
sage: def f(self, x): pass
sage: m = f.__get__(ZZ, type(ZZ))
sage: %timeit f(ZZ, 3)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 333 ns per loop
sage: %timeit m(3)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 320 ns per loop
```

I make #12601 a dependency, since it touches the same file.

Depends on #12601

I am only afraid that in the case of `CachedMethodCallerNoArgs`, implementing this feature might imply an inacceptable slowdown. But first experiments show that in the case of several arguments (`CachedMethodCaller`) things are fine.

This is now ready for review (and is a prerequisite for #12978).

The underlying idea: We wrap a function `f`, resulting in a cached method `CMf`. When binding `CMf` to an instance `inst` (which can be None), then a `CachedMethodCaller` or `CachedMethodCallerNoArgs` `CMCf` is returned, according to the number of arguments. Now, the old behaviour was that `CMCf` was holding a copy of `f`, and was calling it passing `inst` as the first argument.

Now, in #12978, I envision to wrap arbitrary objects `f`, in particular objects with a `__get__` method, so that `f` can be bound to `inst`---and obviously it is not `f` but `f bound to inst` what we want to call! As a side effect, we can distinguish cached bound methods of an instance, and cached unbound methods.

Outside of sage/misc/cachefunc.pyx, only little had to change. In fact, there have just been a few places in which the string representation of a cached method appears in a test---and the string representation has changed, because it is now `Cached version of <bound/unbound method...>` instead of `Cached version of <function ...>`.

The problem was in the `__call__` method of `CachedMethodCaller` in the case of a `CachedInParentMethod`: If we have a `CachedInParentMethod` then we need to tell the instance which the cached function needs to be called with.

Anyway, needs review again.
