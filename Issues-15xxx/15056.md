Currently, a cached method will always be a wrapper of a function. It will bind a `CachedMethodCaller` to an instance. However, this `CachedMethodCaller` will *not* bind the wrapped function to the instance. But in some cases, we might want to make the function depend on the instance, see #12978, for example.

Therefore, I suggest to store the *bound* version of the wrapped function when binding a `CachedMethodCaller` to an instance. There might be a slight benefit timewise, too:

```
sage: def f(self, x): pass
sage: m = f.__get__(ZZ, type(ZZ))
sage: %timeit f(ZZ, 3)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 333 ns per loop
sage: %timeit m(3)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 320 ns per loop
```

I make #12601 a dependency, since it touches the same file.

Outside of sage/misc/cachefunc.pyx, only little had to change. In fact, there have just been a few places in which the string representation of a cached method appears in a test---and the string representation has changed, because it is now `Cached version of <bound/unbound method...>` instead of `Cached version of <function ...>`.

<a id='comment:5'></a>Attachment [trac15056_bind_wrapped_method.patch](tarball://root/attachments/some-uuid/ticket15056/trac15056_bind_wrapped_method.patch) by @simon-king-jena created at 2013-08-18 17:45:50

The problem was in the `__call__` method of `CachedMethodCaller` in the case of a `CachedInParentMethod`: If we have a `CachedInParentMethod` then we need to tell the instance which the cached function needs to be called with.

Anyway, needs review again.
