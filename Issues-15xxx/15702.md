The starting point is `Installing GCC because a Fortran compiler is missing.`

After

```
[ -f ./libgcc_s.so.1 ]; then mv -f ./libgcc_s.so.1 ./libgcc_s.so.1.backup; else true; fi && mv ./libgcc_s.so.1.tmp ./libgcc_s.so.1 && (echo "/* GNU ld script"; echo "   Use the shared library, but some functions are only in"; echo "   the static library.  */"; echo "GROUP ( libgcc_s.so.1 libgcc.a )" ) > ./libgcc_s.so
```
there are LOTS of messages like

```
/usr/bin/ld: error: ./libgcc_s.so.1.tmp uses VFP register arguments, _negdi2_s.o does not
/usr/bin/ld: failed to merge target specific data of file _negdi2_s.o
/usr/bin/ld: error: ./libgcc_s.so.1.tmp uses VFP register arguments, _cmpdi2_s.o does not
/usr/bin/ld: failed to merge target specific data of file _cmpdi2_s.o
```

The problem seems be a conflict between hard and soft FP (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9753749/arm-compilation-error-vpf-registered-used-by-executable-not-object-file).

In http://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/ExoticPorts  jpflori also mentions hard floats.

The problem can of course easily circumvented by `apt-get install gcc g++ gfortran`. 

Side remark: Since building Sage from source on Raspberry Pi already takes almost 5 days with the three compilers pre-installed (compared to 1 hour on my 4 core i750 desktop) - building gcc may NOT be the recommended way ...

But to avoid a build error even on an exotic platform and if there is a simple fix ...

I don't remember if I built GCC or not.
I'd say no, for the same exact same reason you mentioned, it would already take far too much time.
(And, yes I was using hard floats, with Raspbian.)

I'll still have a look at your problem, but it seems strange that GCC is not smart enough to select soft/hard floats or even build multilib.
Could you post your full build log please?

Can you try recompiling using

```

```
(Only the value of GCC_CONFIGURE actually matters.)

If that's not enough, you could try

```
GCC_CONFIGURE="--with-fpu=vfp --with-float=hard" ./sage -i gcc
```

The next run was failing, too. To be clear, here is a snippet from my current spkg-install:

```
if [ "$SAGE_CHECK" = yes ]; then
    # Enable internal checks in GCC.  These checks do not affect the
    # binaries produced by GCC, but they do increase the compile time
    # of everything compiled with GCC.
    ###  GCC_CONFIGURE="$GCC_CONFIGURE --enable-checking=yes"
    ## GCC_CONFIGURE="--with-fpu=vpu" ./sage -i gcc
    GCC_CONFIGURE="--with-fpu=vpu --with-float=hard" ./sage -i gcc
fi
```

As I started the second run (after changing spkg-install) just by calling ./make again,
there were perhaps some left overs from the first run.

Therefore I am now doing a clean build with float=hard ...

PS.: The log-file is available for upload.

Strange, it seems you failed in the same spot.

In my tests:
* default failed
* passing only --with-fpu=vfp failed the same way (building libgcc_s.so in stage 1)
* passing both --with-fpu=vfp and -with-float=hard is still running, made it through stage 1 and is now in stage 2.

And you don't need to modify spkg-install. On top of that you removed some options from GCC_CONFIGURE (the checinkg stuff) and that is not taken into account as the snippet you modified is within a SAGE_CHECK=yes part (and thats unset by default).
You can just run the ocmmand I posted above.

After applying the patch on my RaspberryPi I could build gcc and then build the rest of Sage 6.0. `./sage -t -a` resulted in 97 timeouts (which is not too surprising :-) but no errors. - I cannot test the armv7 aspect.

But it is a positive review for resolving my original defect.
