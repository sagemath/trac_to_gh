```
sage: L = LazyPowerSeriesRing(QQ)
sage: x = L.gen()
sage: L.zero().coefficients(4)
[0, 0, 0, 0]
sage: x.coefficients(4)
[0, 1, 0, 0]
```
Correct so far...

```
sage: (L.zero() + x).coefficients(4)
[0, 0, 0, 0]
sage: (L.zero() - x).coefficients(4)
[0, 0, 0, 0]
```

But `x - L.zero()` and `x + L.zero()` return correct results.

See also #15248 for another lazy power series bug.

One problem is in series_order.py.  There, a very simple lattice (in fact, a total order) should be implemented: NonNegativeIntegers together with the two special values unknown and infinity.  unknown is the minimal element, infinity the maximal element.

Comparing unknown with another element works, comparing infinity with another element works, but comparing an integer with unknown does not work, because the comparison invoked is from Integer.

How should I create such a lattice really?

Great! I'm all set to dig into the species code too.  For a start, I looked through the tickets that are related to the lazy power series code and changed the keyword to LazyPowerSeries...

Did you see #10931?  I guess the patch won't apply anymore, but the philosophy should :-)
