The docbuilder turns documentation source into documentation. Currently, there is no notion of "installing the documentation", nor of VPATH builds. As soon as there will be, SAGE_DOC must point to the documentation, not the source code, but the source code location is still required to make some doctests pass.

I think it's best to introduce a variable `SAGE_DOC_SRC` that points to the documentation source code.
