After #12555:

```
sage: p = ZpFM(5)(5)
sage: ~p
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: cannot invert non-unit
sage: p^-1
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGFPE: An unhandled floating point exception occurred in Sage.
This probably occurred because a *compiled* component of Sage has a bug
in it and is not properly wrapped with sig_on(), sig_off().
Sage will now terminate.
