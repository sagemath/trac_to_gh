Implement various things for affine root systems:

- The symmetric form `( | )`.
- Methods for checking the short/long/imaginary roots.
- Modelling the positive roots roots in affine types.
- Basic untwisted types (so type A<sub>2n</sub><sup>(2)</sup> would give A<sub>2n</sub>).
- (Dual) Coxeter numbers for finite types.

<a id='comment:16'></a>Travis: do you mind updating the description of the ticket to give an overview of the changes?

Thanks!

<a id='comment:19'></a>The scalar product that was implemented is fundamental in Kac' book and for that alone this is an important patch.

I got one doctest failure in weight_space.py:

```
sage -t weight_space.py
**********************************************************************
File "weight_space.py", line 131, in sage.combinat.root_system.weight_space.WeightSpace
Failed example:
    for ct in CartanType.samples(crystallographic=True)+[CartanType(["A",2],["C",5,1])]:
          TestSuite(ct.root_system().weight_lattice()).run()
          TestSuite(ct.root_system().weight_space()).run()
Expected nothing
Got:
    Failure in _test_not_implemented_methods:
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    [snip]
    AssertionError: Not implemented method: _symmetric_form_matrix
```
In `cartan_type.py` you could delete the sentence on line 108 since you do implement Coxeter numbers!

For the positive roots, imaginary roots, etc. The user might like to know how to get a list of them. For *untwisted* types you can do this.

```
sage: PR=RootSystem(['A',3,1]).root_lattice().positive_real_roots()
sage: [PR.unrank(i) for i in [0..4]]
[alpha[1], alpha[2], alpha[3], alpha[1] + alpha[2], alpha[2] + alpha[3]]
```

Is there a more obvious way? And should something like this be in the doctest?

In the method basic_imaginary_roots the docstring still refers to simple imaginary roots (twice).

It would be good if there were pointers to Kac' book in some places. For example, in symmetric_form, the doc could have a pointer to Chapter 6. The Coxeter number method could have a pointer to Bourbaki, Lie Groups and Lie Algebras V.6.1.

The following breaks:

[RootSystem(['A',2,2]).root_lattice().positive_roots().unrank(x) for x in [0..10]]

It works for untwisted types. Is this a limitation of the patch or an unexpected failure?

If it is a limitation of the patch maybe it should be noted in the patch description. Also it
might be better to fail with a not implemented error than with:

```

BTW Sage reports this root system as Root lattice of the Root system of type ['C', 3, 1]^*

If I have my facts straight Macdonald introduced a classification of affine root systems in his
paper "Affine root systems and the Dedekind eta function" Inventiones 1972 but
Kac didn't follow Macdonald. He introduced his own classification. So we are
entering root systems in Kac' notation and they are getting converted automatically

I mention that I've personally found it a little confusing.
