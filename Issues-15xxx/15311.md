I'll fix that in the next day or so.

Ah, sorry I forgot the #15305 dependency which does this.

> - I prevented the coercion to the symmetric functions from appearing unless `q` is invertible. Is this unnecessarily restrictive? (The map does involve division by `q`.)


I believe it makes the scalar product agree with the HL scalar product... I saw something that this made the map "nice", but I don't think it was in [Schiffmann](http://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0611617v2.pdf).

> - Your scalar product functions had a `q` argument which seems pointless to me (the `q` is already an attribute of the parent, and I don't think you want to allow a different `q` in the scalar product -- if you do, you are doing it wrong). I removed it.


Fair enough.

> Nice work!


Thanks, and thank you for reviewing this! I'll post a new version with your changes folded in once I've fixed the coercion issue.

See you soon,

Travis

<a id='comment:7'></a>I was trying out new spellings of my names, and then copy/paste fun! XP

So I've folded in your review patch and made the following changes:

- Fixed a bug so computations work for prime powers (I forgot to pass `self._q` to `hall_polynomial()`). This uncovered another problem, that [univariate] Laurent polynomials don't divide like the should (see #11726), so I changed all of the tests to use the fraction field.
- Fixed the coercion.
- Made `HallAlgebra` lazily imported.
- Improved the doc and added some more doctests.

I didn't want to make this depend on #11726 since functionally it will work when Laurent polynomials do the division like they should (although it is *horrendously* slow with the current #11726 patch).
