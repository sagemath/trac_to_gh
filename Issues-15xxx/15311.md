Review patch uploaded. I've got only one issue I'd like you to fix (unless it's intention), and that's the fact that the Hall algebra doesn't coerce to the symmetric functions until you call the `HallAlgebraMonomials` basis (because only the latter basis activates the coercions).

Comments on my changes:

- Your patch contained some coercion fu in the coproduct method, where you took an element of the tensor square of one basis and coerced it into the tensor square of another. This doesn't work in the current version of Sage, not even with #10963 applied (therefore the failing doctests). I have replaced this by a manual implementation. Is this fixed on the combinat queue?

- I prevented the coercion to the symmetric functions from appearing unless `q` is invertible. Is this unnecessarily restrictive? (The map does involve division by `q`.)

- Your scalar product functions had a `q` argument which seems pointless to me (the `q` is already an attribute of the parent, and I don't think you want to allow a different `q` in the scalar product -- if you do, you are doing it wrong). I removed it.

Nice work!

I believe it makes the scalar product agree with the HL scalar product... I saw something that this made the map "nice", but I don't think it was in [Schiffmann](http://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0611617v2.pdf).

> - Your scalar product functions had a `q` argument which seems pointless to me (the `q` is already an attribute of the parent, and I don't think you want to allow a different `q` in the scalar product -- if you do, you are doing it wrong). I removed it.

Fair enough.

Thanks, and thank you for reviewing this! I'll post a new version with your changes folded in once I've fixed the coercion issue.

See you soon,

I was trying out new spellings of my names, and then copy/paste fun! XP

So I've folded in your review patch and made the following changes:

- Fixed a bug so computations work for prime powers (I forgot to pass `self._q` to `hall_polynomial()`). This uncovered another problem, that [univariate] Laurent polynomials don't divide like the should (see #11726), so I changed all of the tests to use the fraction field.
- Fixed the coercion.
- Made `HallAlgebra` lazily imported.
- Improved the doc and added some more doctests.

I didn't want to make this depend on #11726 since functionally it will work when Laurent polynomials do the division like they should (although it is *horrendously* slow with the current #11726 patch).
