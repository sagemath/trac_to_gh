I'd like to be able to do the following from within the directory of a spkg:

```
sage --spkg .   # current directory
```
but that doesn't work properly (it would create a file `..spkg`).

Therefore, I propose that

```
sage --spkg DIR
```
first does a `cd DIR/..` and then creates the package from there.

The attached patch also adds some additional checks, for example that a changelog entry exists in `SPKG.txt`.
