Currently I can check for linear dependence by

```
sage: V = QQ^4
sage: ld = lambda vecs: len(V.linear_dependence(ves) > 0
```
However this is relatively slow since it determines a basis of all such linear dependencies. Also it only works for vector spaces. A faster way to do a simple check is to construct a matrix of the vectors, echelonize the matrix, and see if any of the resulting rows are 0.

There might be even faster algorithms out there, but this is much faster than how I was doing it before:

```
sage: M = QQ^3
sage: vecs = [M([1,2,3]), M([4,5,6]), M([3,3,3])]
sage: %timeit len(M.linear_dependence(vecs)) > 0
100 loops, best of 3: 5.71 ms per loop

sage: %timeit M.are_linearly_dependent(vecs)
1000 loops, best of 3: 530 us per loop
```

When the base ring is, say, `ZZ`, `QQ`, or a polynomial ring, you may want to first compute the echelon form after specializing the variables and/or reducing modulo a small prime. But perhaps that's something for another ticket.

Hey Marc,

Thanks for reviewing this. Sorry I let this slip off my radar. I'm not knowledgeable enough to know what to do in regard to how to specialize and/or reduce. So I'm for another ticket unless you know what to do.

Thanks again,

Travis
