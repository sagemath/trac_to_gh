Currently I can check for linear dependence by

```
sage: V = QQ^4
sage: ld = lambda vecs: len(V.linear_dependence(ves) > 0
```
However this is relatively slow since it determines a basis of all such linear dependencies. Also it only works for vector spaces. A faster way to do a simple check is to construct a matrix of the vectors, echelonize the matrix, and see if any of the resulting rows are 0.

<a id='comment:1'>**Comment 1:**</a>
There might be even faster algorithms out there, but this is much faster than how I was doing it before:

```
sage: M = QQ^3
sage: vecs = [M([1,2,3]), M([4,5,6]), M([3,3,3])]
sage: %timeit len(M.linear_dependence(vecs)) > 0
100 loops, best of 3: 5.71 ms per loop

sage: %timeit M.are_linearly_dependent(vecs)
1000 loops, best of 3: 530 us per loop
```

Hey Marc,

Thanks for reviewing this. Sorry I let this slip off my radar. I'm not knowledgeable enough to know what to do in regard to how to specialize and/or reduce. So I'm for another ticket unless you know what to do.

Thanks again,

Travis
