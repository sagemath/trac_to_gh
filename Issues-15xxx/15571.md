This is fixed but needs a doctest:

Yet another example where symbolic expressions are abusively considered equivalent, even though `simplify()` has become a bit more careful.

```
sage: var('a,x')
(a, x)
sage: assume(a, 'complex')
sage: assume(x, 'complex')
sage: expr = a^(4*x) - (a^4)^x
sage: expr.is_zero()
True
sage: expr(a=I, x=1/2)
-2
```

<a id='comment:8'>Comment 8:</a>
Indeed, one doesn't have to do any assumption at all to get the 'false' now.

```
sage: sage: var('a,x')
(a, x)
sage: (a, x)
(a, x)
sage: sage: expr = a^(4*x) - (a^4)^x
sage: sage: expr.is_zero()
False
```

If you want to remove the second

```
+            sage: assume(a, 'complex')
+            sage: assume(x, 'complex')
```
and then the `forget()` which I think is all superfluous, that would be great, but it's fine this way too.
