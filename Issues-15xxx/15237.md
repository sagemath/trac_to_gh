It prints a very angry error message about not finding the graphviz binaries. The problem comes from dot2tex is installed, so `CrystalOfLetters` creates a `DiGraph` with the dot2tex option, but it fails to create it because it needs graphviz (for one reason or another). This fixes it by having the `DiGraph` not created until a less/greater than comparison is made.
