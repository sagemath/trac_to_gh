<a id='comment:2'></a>One thing for line 394; instead of "Beware" (or "Be aware"), I think this would be best formatted as

```
.. WARNING::

    The gcd depends on the base ring.
```
After this it will be a positive review.

Edit - one other thing, could you remove the comma `,` from line 449.

Best,

Also why did you choose not to use the `.. WARNING::` for the gcd dependency on the base ring?

A polynomial ring over a ring, gives the more intuitive result.
