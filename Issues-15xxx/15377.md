For some base rings (such as polynomial rings over a field), the output of the function may seem counter intuitive even though the gcd is correct. The documentation is inadequate to describe this situation.

One thing for line 394; instead of "Beware" (or "Be aware"), I think this would be best formatted as

```
.. WARNING::

    The gcd depends on the base ring.
```
After this it will be a positive review.

Edit - one other thing, could you remove the comma `,` from line 449.

Best,

Travis

It fixed the typo and clarified the functionality.

Examples do what they should.

doctest looks good.

I missed this the first go-around but you need to have a proper commit message.

Also why did you choose not to use the `.. WARNING::` for the gcd dependency on the base ring?

Last thing; I noticed (I edited my first comment) is that the comma here

```
A polynomial ring over a ring, gives the more intuitive result.
```
should be removed. Thanks!
