In a bialgebra, that is not obvious there exists *a_realization*
such that implements (easily) the product and the coproduct.

So I propose a coercion method that try to find automatically
a realization which has the implementation of the (co)product.

That point is obvious if we considere algebras or coalgebras... any structure with an unique operations. But with bialgebras, moreover with Hopf algebra, one has several operations and one is may be easier to define in some basis and one other in an other one.

> If not, the code should call the "best" realization to do the computations in by overwriting the respective `*_by_coercion()` in either the realization category or in the parent directly (sometimes [often] the change-of-basis is nontrivial as well).

That means: I want do my research without say... to compute in a basis of my new Hopf algebra, I don't want spend my time to tell to sage... I  don't have define a specific realization (`a_realization`) for my operations but if I want the product go to find this basis and the coproduct this one... No! I have implement product/coproduct whatever somewhere so do it!

Then if some code add in sage seems to be slow because of that! This code should specify go to this basis.

IMO the `coproduct_by_coercion()` method in this ticket should go in `Coalgebras`, in which `coproduct()` will need some tweaks since it seems to be assuming a basis.

This code don't have to be in coalgebras or magmas because, for these structures we obviously could define one realization with the unique operation of the structure.

That is fix

Replying to [pbruin](#comment%3A7):
Independently, Travis's[comment:4](#comment%3A4) also seems to mean this needs work.

I hope I have answered to that part.

it sounds like what this ticket is attempting to achieve was originally the goal.

I think this is something worth figuring out eventually, but for the sake of actually getting later features of CHA included in Sage, I'm fine with Travis's suggestion of making `a_realization` always return a product/coproduct/antipode method that's hard-coded to point to a realization where the method is actually defined, rather than having Sage automatically find a realization where the method is actually defined.
