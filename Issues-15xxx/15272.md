This patch adds method minimal_representatives and extends the functionality of bruhat_poset and bruhat_graphs.

Let W be a finite Weyl group and let W_S be the subgroup of W generated by reflections associated with a subset S of simple roots. Then the cosets W / W_S have unique representatives of minimal length which are ordered by the Bruhat order of W. Similarly for W_S \ W. These poset structures appear in many places, e.g. intersection cohomology of generalized flag varieties or nilpotent Lie algebra cohomology.

This patch adds a parameters index_set (= S), crossed_nodes and side (left / right).

The `has_key` is being deprecated (removed?) in python3 in favor of the `in` syntax (which I believe is faster...?). Also I agree with Darij since this loop is so small, I'd pull the `side == "right"` statement outside as:

```
if side == "right":
    for y in g:
        r = y*x.inverse()
    if x.length() < y.length() and r in ref:
        d[x][y] = r
else:
    for y in g:
        r = x.inverse()*y
    if x.length() < y.length() and r in ref:
        d[x][y] = r
```
