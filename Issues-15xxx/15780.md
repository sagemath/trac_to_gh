<a id='comment:5'></a>I haven't looked closely at functionality yet, but there are a few things that need to be fixed first.

1) There are several doctests that fail with this:

```
sage -t --long sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/lseries_ell.py  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t --long sage/schemes/plane_conics/con_field.py  # 3 doctests failed
sage -t --long sage/schemes/generic/morphism.py  # 3 doctests failed
```

It looks like most of these are because the `__call__` in generic\morphism first coerces the input point into the domain and the `__call__` in projective\morphism does not. Although the elliptic curve failure seems to be a precision issue.

2) The new functions must have appropriate documentation. See the developers guide for the appropriate format.

SCORE projective_morphism.py: 91.9% (34 of 37)

Missing documentation:
* line 182: def __call__(self, x, check=True)
* line 187: def _fast_eval(self, x, check=True)
* line 2625: def _fast_eval(self, x, check=True)

3) There are a number of Tab characters in projective_morphism.py

`sage -t --long sage/schemes/projective/projective_morphism.py  # Tab character found`

    "body": "<a id='comment:13'></a>initialization of the fast_polys should probably be done lazily, unless you can show it is always quick. There are many reasons to create morphisms/rational maps that do not involve evaluating them at points. For instance, you might want to take direct or inverse images of subvarieties. For doing that one does not evaluate the defining polynomials, but one does computations with the polynomials. It would be a shame to waste time on computing fast_polys in those cases.\n\nYou'd also have to experiment to see if doing this really is an improvement: what you're basically doing is representing the polynomials by predetermined straight-line programs, and using those programs regardless of the ring over which the evaluation point is defined. Different rings may benefit from different evaluation strategies. So there's something to be said for deferring the choice of evaluation algorithm until the ring in which this needs to happen is known. Of course, in many common cases the ring for the point is the same as the base ring of the polynomials. Then fast_eval probably does pretty well (also because no intermediate coercions are required).",

<a id='comment:13'></a>initialization of the fast_polys should probably be done lazily, unless you can show it is always quick. There are many reasons to create morphisms/rational maps that do not involve evaluating them at points. For instance, you might want to take direct or inverse images of subvarieties. For doing that one does not evaluate the defining polynomials, but one does computations with the polynomials. It would be a shame to waste time on computing fast_polys in those cases.

You'd also have to experiment to see if doing this really is an improvement: what you're basically doing is representing the polynomials by predetermined straight-line programs, and using those programs regardless of the ring over which the evaluation point is defined. Different rings may benefit from different evaluation strategies. So there's something to be said for deferring the choice of evaluation algorithm until the ring in which this needs to happen is known. Of course, in many common cases the ring for the point is the same as the base ring of the polynomials. Then fast_eval probably does pretty well (also because no intermediate coercions are required).

Whether 717 ms is a lot depends on what you compare it to. I'm finding (on 6.0):

```
sage: P5=ProjectiveSpace(Rationals(),5)
sage: R=P2.coordinate_ring()
sage: mon=[R({tuple(a):1}) for a in WeightedIntegerVectors(4,[1,1,1,1,1,1])]
sage: L=[sum(random_sublist(mon,0.1)) for j in [0..5]]
sage: %timeit P2.hom(L,P2)
10000 loops, best of 3: 63.3 us per loop
sage: %timeit [fast_callable(l) for l in L]
100 loops, best of 3: 1.94 ms per loop
```
as you see, creating the fast callables is *much* slower than creating the map. If you increase the polynomials in L (by increasing the degree of the monomials, for instance), the difference gets worse. I'd say that's enough time penalty to hold off on it unless you actually need the fast_callables.

Python is designed to let "try" be very fast. If an exception occurs there is a bit larger penalty but in this case it wouldn't be measurable compared to the `fast callable`.

instead? `max(GF(17)).lift()` happens to work at present, but it doesn't really make mathematical sense.

Also, if you really want to scrape the bottom on this, you should use balanced representatives, also on the coordinates when you fill them in. That would give you a larger range where you can use float.

What you'd really need is a `cdef ulong` domain. Then you could just evaluate with 64-bit integers, which would give you a much better bound than `2^27`.
