I haven't looked closely at functionality yet, but there are a few things that need to be fixed first.

1) There are several doctests that fail with this:

```
sage -t --long sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/lseries_ell.py  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t --long sage/schemes/plane_conics/con_field.py  # 3 doctests failed
sage -t --long sage/schemes/generic/morphism.py  # 3 doctests failed
```

It looks like most of these are because the `__call__` in generic\morphism first coerces the input point into the domain and the `__call__` in projective\morphism does not. Although the elliptic curve failure seems to be a precision issue.

2) The new functions must have appropriate documentation. See the developers guide for the appropriate format.

SCORE projective_morphism.py: 91.9% (34 of 37)

Missing documentation:
* line 182: def __call__(self, x, check=True)
* line 187: def _fast_eval(self, x, check=True)
* line 2625: def _fast_eval(self, x, check=True)

3) There are a number of Tab characters in projective_morphism.py

`sage -t --long sage/schemes/projective/projective_morphism.py  # Tab character found`

Had some trouble with the rebase, so had to force the push on the branch. I think everything is still correct.

Although there are a couple doctest failures that are still present

Whether 717 ms is a lot depends on what you compare it to. I'm finding (on 6.0):

```
sage: P5=ProjectiveSpace(Rationals(),5)
sage: R=P2.coordinate_ring()
sage: mon=[R({tuple(a):1}) for a in WeightedIntegerVectors(4,[1,1,1,1,1,1])]
sage: L=[sum(random_sublist(mon,0.1)) for j in [0..5]]
sage: %timeit P2.hom(L,P2)
10000 loops, best of 3: 63.3 us per loop
sage: %timeit [fast_callable(l) for l in L]
100 loops, best of 3: 1.94 ms per loop
```
as you see, creating the fast callables is *much* slower than creating the map. If you increase the polynomials in L (by increasing the degree of the monomials, for instance), the difference gets worse. I'd say that's enough time penalty to hold off on it unless you actually need the fast_callables.

Python is designed to let "try" be very fast. If an exception occurs there is a bit larger penalty but in this case it wouldn't be measurable compared to the `fast callable`.

The recommended way to store the fast_callable would be by accessing them through a `cached_method` or a `lazy_attribute`. See their docstrings for examples. Just don't go sticking `cached_method` decorators on methods arbitrarily. That's how we get memory leaks :-).

Functionality all tests out fine. A couple minor issues that need to be addressed

1) _fast_eval does not use the parameter 'check'. Simply remove (from both _fast_eval functions)

2) `@`lazy_attribute function needs the documentation string + an example

2b) in the `@`lazy_attribute. Put the 'prime' and 'degree' inside the 'if' block so they are only computed if they are needed.

3) There is an extra blank line in _fast_eval for finite fields that can be removed

4) I'd like to see a few more doctests in _fast_eval. Maybe
  a) Powerseries ring

  b) quotient ring

You can pull them from comment 8 above.

* justify constant `2**27` as bound on "no overflow in float" (you should use doubles).
* for the sake of defensive programming, would you use

```
max(abs(c.lift()) for c in coefficients)
```
instead? `max(GF(17)).lift()` happens to work at present, but it doesn't really make mathematical sense.

Also, if you really want to scrape the bottom on this, you should use balanced representatives, also on the coordinates when you fill them in. That would give you a larger range where you can use float.

What you'd really need is a `cdef ulong` domain. Then you could just evaluate with 64-bit integers, which would give you a much better bound than `2^27`.
