Something strange is happening with the command CyclotomicField and the order of the associated generator. Everything works very well for n which is different from 2 mod 4 but does not work for n =2 mod 4 as seen in the following lines.

This is right:

```
sage: K7.<s> = CyclotomicField(7)
sage: gap(K7)
CF(7)
sage: gap(s)
E(7)
sage: K7(_)
s
```
This is wrong

```
sage: K6.<s> = CyclotomicField(6)
sage: gap(K6)
CF(3)
sage: gap(s)    # this is wrong!
E(3)
sage: K6(_)     # coherent with above
s - 1
```
Note that the following works fine

```
sage: UCF = UniversalCyclotomicField()
sage: UCF(s)
-E(3)^2
sage: K6(_)
s
```
