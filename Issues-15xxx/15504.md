From google spreadsheet which no one reads `X-(`

```
sage: integrate(log(1+x)/x,x)
 log(x + 1)*log(-x) + polylog(2, x + 1)
sage: integrate(log(1+x)/x,x,0,1) 
 -1/6*pi^2 + I*pi*log(2) + polylog(2, 2)
```

Since `dilog(2) = -pi<sup>2/4+log(2)</sup>2/2-1/2*(log(2)+I*pi)^2` the result is simply `pi^2/12`.

For completeness, sympy has

```
In [1]: integrate(log(1+x)/x)
Out[1]: 
        ⎛      ⅈ⋅π⎞
-polylog⎝2, x⋅ℯ   ⎠

In [2]: integrate(log(1+x)/x,(x,0,1))
Out[2]: 
        ⎛    ⅈ⋅π⎞
-polylog⎝2, ℯ   ⎠
```
while Wolfram says `integral (log(1+x))/x dx = -Li_2(-x)+constant`.
The sympy solution will also only be available with sympy-0.7.8 because of a missing `polylog._sage_` method in earlier versions.

<div id="comment:9" align="right">comment:9</div>

as of v8.0.beta3, Maxima is correct:

```
sage: integrate(log(1+x)/x, x, 0, 1, algorithm='maxima')
-1/6*pi^2 + I*pi*log(2) + dilog(2)
sage: _.n()
0.822467033424113
sage: N(pi^2/12)
0.822467033424113
```

see [W|A](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=integrate(ln(1%2Bx)%2Fx,+x,+0,+1))

the imaginary part vanishes because of the identity `dilog(2) = -pi<sup>2/4+log(2)</sup>2/2-1/2*(log(2)+I*pi)^2`, which doesn't seem to be recognised.

- giac returns unevaluated 
- sympy returns the correct + reduced answer 

.. it's quite fun. in [that list in github](https://gist.github.com/mforets/e82a3de96a17bc80a4a22ad787bdd104) i started to evaluate the integral tickets with different algorithms.
