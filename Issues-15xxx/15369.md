Following the discussion at ​https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/tyAxhqxk3ZI/SuBg2Ukwwj4J3

There is currently no way to create a group representing `Z/nZ` easily. And the one acknowledged way to do that being `Integers(n)` (i.e. `IntegerModRing(n)`), this patch exposes it as `groups.misc.AdditiveCyclic`.

That's not what you're asking sage to do. You're asking for a finite abelian group, written additively, that happens to be cyclic of order 5. If you know your group is going to be cyclic, you'd probably be better off asking for a cyclic group explicitly.

So I'd agree with Volker that lists are more natural here. At the same time you're asking for conversion, which is supposed to make a best effort, so adding a special case wouldn't be out of the question, even if it's an ugly special case.

If there exists an Additive Cyclic group somewhere, I agree.

sage: V = VectorSpace(RR,1)

If you want want a cyclic group with nice map Z -> Z/nZ then just use `IntegerModRing`.

The notation that you propose can certainly be implemented, but its a confusing special case that can't work for a general Abelian group. So -1 from me, consistency is more important than saving two keystrokes.
