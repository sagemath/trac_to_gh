This takes a lot of time

```
sage: ascii_art(integral(exp(x + x^2)/(x+1), x))
```
because sympy is trying to solve the integral before drawing the ascii art. We actually don't want sympy to solve the integral, just draw.

It works even without passing `evaluate=False` to `sympify()`, but doing it does not hurt.
