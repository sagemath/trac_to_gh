This takes a lot of time

```
sage: ascii_art(integral(exp(x + x^2)/(x+1), x))
```
because sympy is trying to solve the integral before drawing the ascii art. We actually don't want sympy to solve the integral, just draw.

Depends on #15198

Converting sage integrals to sympy unevaluated `Integral`s instead of `integral` commands solves the problem and does not seem to break anything.

It works even without passing `evaluate=False` to `sympify()`, but doing it does not hurt. In fact, as far as I understand, we want conversions to sympy to do as little evaluation as possible in general. So I also rebased Travis' patch on top of `u/jpflori/ticket/15198` (to prevent a trivial merge conflict), and made `SympyConverter` use `evaluate=False` as well.
