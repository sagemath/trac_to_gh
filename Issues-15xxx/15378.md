Currently the following fails

```
sage: P.<x,y>=ProjectiveSpace(QQ,1)
sage: H=Hom(P,P)
sage: f=H([x^2 -29/16*y^2, y^2])
sage: f*f
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'SchemeMorphism_polynomial_projective_space_field' and 'SchemeMorphism_polynomial_projective_space_field'
```

We just propose a generic implementation.

I added the ref to the inheritance issue in #14711. It would be nice if we could have composition working independent of the inheritance structure correction. Accordingly, I put the inheritance back how it was and the composition seems to work fine with this implementation. I added one example to test failure, but that is all.

You wrote

```

```
first of all the right syntax is <code>:trac:\`14711\`</code> and secondly #14711 refers to a **closed** ticket.

Yes, I can fixed the syntax mistake.

As for it being a closed ticket. In trying to investigate this issue, the comment in the code was not very helpful. The closed ticket #14711 has a much longer description of the issue and is part of what is needed. If I'm not mistaken the other part is a python bug not tracked on trac.

```

sage: p = P((1,3))
sage: p

But I guess it is better to have the result of `f*g` with explicit polynomial coordinates.

```

as there might be some morphism other than polynomial that you may want to compose with polynomial ones. I was not able to build example though.

If I make your code

```
  return super(SchemeMorphism_polynomial, self)._composition_(other, homset)
```

Then I get

```
sage: A2.<x,y> = AffineSpace(QQ,2)
sage: H=End(A2)
sage: f=H([x^2+y^2,y^2/x])
sage: p= A2([1,2])

        then
          Generic endomorphism of Affine Space of dimension 2 over
Rational Field
```

However, I can't seem to actually apply the map

```
sage: p(Spec(QQ).an_element())
TypeError: Point on Spectrum of Rational Field defined by the Principal ideal (0) of Rational Field fails to convert into the map's domain Spectrum of Rational Field, but a `pushforward` method is not properly implemented
```

With your new example, I now get:

```

  To:   Affine Space of dimension 2 over Number Field in a with defining

<a id='comment:26'></a>
For Galois conjugation the point is that the ring homomorphism `f1` lacks a `inverse_image` for ideals.

There is something weird with the composition telling that it is the composition of two `Generic endomorphisms`.

And an other error

```
sage: Ai = A.Hom(A).identity()
sage: f = A.Hom(A)([x,y])
sage: Ai * f  # TypeError
sage: f * Ai  # TypeError
```
I opened #21160 for the above since it is distinct from what we are trying to do here...
