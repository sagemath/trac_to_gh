sage: R.<x> = PowerSeriesRing(ZZ)
sage: P.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: r=R([1,1,1,1])
sage: r
1 + x + x^2 + x^3
sage: P(r)
TypeError: unable to coerce <type 'sage.rings.power_series_poly.PowerSeries_poly'> to an integer
```

Sage power series can have zero bigoh term, and such series are identical to polynomials, so coercion should be no problem.

If we should allow zero bigoh in power series is another matter.
