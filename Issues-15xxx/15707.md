```
sage: R.<x> = PowerSeriesRing(ZZ)
sage: P.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: r=R([1,1,1,1])
sage: r
1 + x + x^2 + x^3
sage: P(r)
TypeError: unable to coerce <type 'sage.rings.power_series_poly.PowerSeries_poly'> to an integer
```

Sage power series can have zero bigoh term, and such series are identical to polynomials, so coercion should be no problem.

If we should allow zero bigoh in power series is another matter.

This should be fixed, probably also for series with finite precision, i.e. that do have an O(x<sup>n</sup>) term.  There is already the method `r.polynomial()` which returns exactly the desired result; we just have to tell `P(r)` to use this.
