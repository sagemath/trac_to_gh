Its probably not something that is reproducable on modern hardware, so progress upstream has been slow.

For now, I propose we just plow ahead and fall back to static libraries.

If static libraries always work, why don't we always only use static libraries?

Conversely, if static libraries don't always work, wouldn't this "fall back" cause other problems?

Because static libraries suck.

It won't cause other problems for now. If we want to use the upstream shared libraries (with a different naming convention than the static libraries) then we'll run into troubles. But by then we hopefully have found a way to not hardcode atlas/blas/lapack library names in the Sage build system.

If you want to work towards that goal, then the problem on this ticket must be fixed in a proper way anyway. I don't see how using shared libraries "sometimes" is closer to the stated goal than "never" using shared libraries.

I am particularly bothered that the choice is non-deterministic and difficult to predict, so Sage builds on the same machine will be substantially different (one with shared ATLAS and one with static ATLAS).

I think that just means more changes to undo later. And mind you the shared libraries build apparently fine on most systems, its just some AMD platforms where presumably the performance impact of holding mutexes is different.

Those "different ways" only were about tuning parameters and CPU instruction sets, right? Which is far less fundamental than static vs. dynamic libraries.

Imagine we go with your solution and in the future somebody decides to change the Sage build system or some package such that it only works for a dynamic ATLAS library.

If there is no observable difference between shared and static libraries, then why do you care so much about shared libraries?

For [atlas issue 907](http://sourceforge.net/p/math-atlas/support-requests/907/), the relevant code would be:

`ATLAS/tune/threads/tune_count.c:242`

```
      if (tmut < tldec*1.02)
      {
         printf("\nNO REAL ADVANTAGE TO ASSEMBLY, FORCING USE OF MUTEX\n");
         ATL_assert(!system("make iForceUseMutex"));
      }
```

Looking at 
`ATLAS/makes/Make.ttune:159`

```
iFind_atomic_arch :
        if $(MAKE) xprobe_atomic_amd64 ; then \
           cp $(myTHRdir)/ATL_*AtomicCount_arch.c . ; \
           cp $(myTHRdir)/ATL_ResetAtomicCount_amd64.S \
              ATL_ResetAtomicCount_arch.S ; \
           cp $(myTHRdir)/ATL_DecAtomicCount_amd64.S \
              ATL_DecAtomicCount_arch.S ; \
           rm $(BLDdir)/src/threads/atomic.inc ; \
           echo "aobj = ATL_SetAtomicCount_arch.o ATL_ResetAtomicCount_amd64.o ATL_DecAtomicCount_amd64.o ATL_FreeAtomicCount_arch.o" > $(BLDdir)/src/threads/atomic.inc ;
           .... lines elided ....
        fi
        - rm -f $(BLDdir)/src/threads/lib.grd
        $(MAKE) tlib

```
`ATLAS/makes/Make.ttune:205`

```
iForceUseMutex:
        rm $(BLDdir)/src/threads/atomic.inc
        echo "aobj = ATL_SetAtomicCount_mut.o ATL_ResetAtomicCount_mut.o ATL_DecAtomicCount_mut.o ATL_FreeAtomicCount_mut.o" > $(BLDdir)/src/threads/atomic.inc
```

The file `atomic.inc` is only touched in `Make.ttune`, always in the style above. The file is only used in `ATLAS/makes/Make.thr`, where it is included to get `aobj` defined, which is then included in `obj` to build a library.

I suspect the problem is that `make iForceUseMutex` doesn't actually rebuild the library, which does happen in `make iFind_atomic_arch`. So, when we do

```
iTune_atomic :
        if $(MAKE) mutcnt ; then \
           if $(MAKE) iFind_atomic_arch ; then \
              $(MAKE) xtune_count ; ./xtune_count -r 1000000 -o yes; \
           fi ; \
        else \
           $(MAKE) iFind_atomic_arch ; \
        fi
```
hich presumably runs the code in `tune_count.c`, we end up with a built library that has the architecture-specific bits in it, but an `aobj` that reflects otherwise. Probably, the make system runs into these things another time and then tries to include the same definitions another time in the library.

Perhaps just patch the system?

```diff
ATLAS/tune/threads/tune_count.c:244
-         printf("\nNO REAL ADVANTAGE TO ASSEMBLY, FORCING USE OF MUTEX\n");
-         ATL_assert(!system("make iForceUseMutex"));
+         printf("\nNO REAL ADVANTAGE TO ASSEMBLY, BUT WE LEAVE IT IN ANYWAY\n");
```
I think there is some hope that this will eliminate the (rare) build fails.

From what I remember the main problem is that ATLAS builds a (static) lib for tuning, and then just update it to get the final (static) library so it ends up including two objects files with the same symbols (because of the atoñic.inc ñagic which does notinclude the same pieces of code in tyhe tuning and in the final phases, and because old object files of the tuning phase are still lurking around when the final phase is going on).

It presumably does so because updating the static archive is faster than rebuilding everything from scratch.

So another solution would be to erase the static lib built for tuning (and the corresponding object files) when the tuning phase is finished and let everything be built again when the real building phase starts.

Replying to [nbruin](#comment%3A23):
> `ATLAS/tune/threads/tune_count.c:242`
> 
> ```
>       if (tmut < tldec*1.02)
>       {
>          printf("\nNO REAL ADVANTAGE TO ASSEMBLY, FORCING USE OF MUTEX\n");
>          ATL_assert(!system("make iForceUseMutex"));
>       }
> ```

So would it be a plan to
- check that this check is the culprit of (at least some) failure by patching it to be `tmut < tldec*1000` and verifying that on relevant hardware ALTAS now reliably fails to build
- patch atlas to NOT run `make iForceUseMutex` at this point and ship with that. Perhaps patch it as:

```
printf("\nASSEMBLY/MUTEX ratio is %d, but we'll stick with assembly anyway\n",tldec/tmut);
```
so that our logfiles at least tells us what the performance penalty is (well, there's none because ATLAS doesn't build dynamic libs without).

Congratulations on getting this fixed.

Just for the record: I think the mutex code can still get built on platforms where no assembly alternative is available. In that case, I don't think we should particularly expect conflicting symbols either, because there are no other implementations available that the mutex code can conflict with in that case.

This is why I figured it was best to patch the code that takes action depending on the tuning result and not the target in the makefile.

The comment in the SPKG.txt doesn't strictly contradict this, but I had to read the comment a second time to convince myself of that.

I have no idea what p4 is about but the change from p4 to p5 as posted on this ticket looks pretty reasonable. I haven't built or downloaded this new package, but other people have and it's a blocker, so a positive review helps things along.
