// ** int overflow(^), result may be wrong

```
The particular error in the ticket description would be fixed by letting the coercion (of the integer into the polynomial ring) go via the base field.  Actually, the coercion map itself suggests that this should already happen:

```
sage: f = R.coerce_map_from(ZZ); f
Composite map:
  From: Integer Ring
  To:   Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y over Finite Field of size 7
  Defn:   Natural morphism:
          From: Integer Ring
          To:   Finite Field of size 7
        then
          Polynomial base injection morphism:
          From: Finite Field of size 7
          To:   Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y over Finite Field of size 7
sage: f(2^31)
2
```
So the real problem here is that `R(2^31)` does not call `f` as it ought to (I think).
