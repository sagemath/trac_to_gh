The runtime of the Newforms function is unacceptable for large conductors.  To fix this, we speed up both the `DirichletGroup` constructor and the `zeta(n)` method of number fields by avoiding the computation of the group of all roots of unity or its order.

For a benchmark --- This reduces the runtime of Newforms(719, names='a') to 3--4 sec... from its previous value of over a day (interrupted before completion)!

Keywords: roots of unity dirichlet group

My comment above was not completely accurate; it was actually PARI's `nfinit()` that was taking forever.  This is called when constructing the Dirichlet group modulo *N* with values in the group of roots of unity of a number field *K*.  It turns out that by being a bit more careful about which roots of unity one asks for, one can avoid `nfinit()` and just look for roots of cyclotomic polynomials of degree dividing the degree of *K*.

I made a new patch for this approach, which is now doctesting.  If successful, we can see if it would be a suitable alternative fix.

As far as I can tell, this looks good. Disclaimer: I am not a number theorist.
All tests pass, the patchbot is happy, the NewForms test takes 3s.
I was worrying about some eventual regressions in timings.
But I have not been able to find any.
Let me put this in positive review.
