```
The runtime of the Newforms function is unacceptable for large conductors.  To fix this, we speed up both the `DirichletGroup` constructor and the `zeta(n)` method of number fields by avoiding the computation of the group of all roots of unity or its order.

For a benchmark --- This reduces the runtime of Newforms(719, names='a') to 3--4 sec... from its previous value of over a day (interrupted before completion)!

Depends on #15898
Depends on #15767

Keywords: **roots of unity dirichlet group**

Hmm, I did create a local branch to doctest this ticket, but it seems I was so convinced that this couldn't break anything that I didn't even check the branch out from Trac.  The failing doctest shows that the current patch removes the check for whether there are enough roots of unity.

My comment above was not completely accurate; it was actually PARI's `nfinit()` that was taking forever.

It turns out that by being a bit more careful about which roots of unity one asks for, one can avoid `nfinit()` and just look for roots of cyclotomic polynomials of degree dividing the degree of *K*.

I made a new patch for this approach, which is now doctesting.  If successful, we can see if it would be a suitable alternative fix.

As far as I can tell, this looks good. Disclaimer: I am not a number theorist.
All tests pass, the patchbot is happy, the NewForms test takes 3s.
I was worrying about some eventual regressions in timings.
But I have not been able to find any.
Let me put this in positive review.
