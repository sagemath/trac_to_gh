```
The runtime of the Newforms function is unacceptable for large conductors.  To fix this, we speed up both the `DirichletGroup` constructor and the `zeta(n)` method of number fields by avoiding the computation of the group of all roots of unity or its order.

For a benchmark --- This reduces the runtime of Newforms(719, names='a') to 3--4 sec... from its previous value of over a day (interrupted before completion)!

Keywords: roots of unity dirichlet group

I made a new patch for this approach, which is now doctesting.  If successful, we can see if it would be a suitable alternative fix.

As far as I can tell, this looks good. Disclaimer: I am not a number theorist.
All tests pass, the patchbot is happy, the NewForms test takes 3s.
I was worrying about some eventual regressions in timings.
But I have not been able to find any.
Let me put this in positive review.
