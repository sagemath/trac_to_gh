Talking about doc tests: They are not finished on my laptop, yet. But I already got one error:

```

So, the problem is just wrong line break.

And now the real problem starts, namely the reviewing problem: If I understood correctly, you did two commits (`Fix --new option for doctests.` and `Fix doctest doctest due to directory restructure.`) here. Has this doctest error been introduced by your two commits, or by a "dependency"---and what is a "dependency", anyway???

Fortunately there is "git blame". The doctest that is now failing was last edited by Volker, see #14266. But I suppose it used to *not* fail. Hence, I suppose that the reason for the failure is on a different ticket...

It fixes the tests caused by "sage --testall" Hopefully we haven't introduced more breakage since then...but these at least should go on even if there's more work to do.

The sage dev scripts will provide some of this, but (by design) refuse to run in doctest mode.  When I started working on this I was in a branch that didn't even have dev scripts, but the subprocess option wasn't that bad so I left it.

I am working on my desktop because my laptop is broken. Question, Robert: While trying to use the dev scripts, I found a bug. Namely: I forgot to set up my git (e.g., I didn't store e-mail and real name). This should result in an error being raised. However, I get this traceback:

Is this bug already tracked/known to the sage-git people? I think I am currently not really able to create a ticket properly, with a slow internet connection and no usable laptop.

I just ran the tests myself, got 79 files failing. Count me shocked as well.

At this point, no, it's just to fix those two (which were the only ones on the github build_system branch). Looks like there's lots of further work to do.

Replying to [@sagetrac-git](#comment:16):
> Branch pushed to git repo; I updated commit sha1. This was a forced push. Recent commits:
|                   |                              |
|-------------------|------------------------------|
|[changeset:6912669]|Fix --new option for doctests.|
|[changeset:98d0840]|Fix doctest doctest due to directory restructure.|

First problem: How do I update? `sage -dev switch_ticket 15120`? Or `git pull trac` if I am already in your branch?

Second problem: I get these errors in your branch.

```
sage -t --long src/sage/dev/sagedev.py  # 6 doctests failed
sage -t --long src/sage/interfaces/maxima_abstract.py  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t --long src/doc/en/constructions/plotting.rst  # 2 doctests failed
sage -t --long src/sage/dev/git_interface.py  # 10 doctests failed
sage -t --long src/sage/doctest/control.py  # 2 doctests failed
sage -t --long src/sage/dev/trac_interface.py  # 1 doctest failed
```
Why is this a problem, git-wise? Well, I learnt on sage-git that pulling your branch means I get something that is based on an *old* version of the "master" branch, i.e., a version of "master" that is not as terribly broken as the version mentioned in [comment:10](#comment:10) and [comment:13](#comment:13) - but still there are so many errors.

Sorry for my lack of knowledge on git. What I did: ./sage -dev switch-ticket 15120, followed by "make". Afterwards, ./sage -dev did not work (so, I assume that the development scripts are in the master branch, but this ticket relies on a version of the master branch that predates the development scripts; correct?). Since I still found myself on commit 6912669, I did git pull, followed by git checkout e11727c. git log told me that now everything seems ok, I see Volker's recent addition on top of Robert's changes. So, I am now running make ptest.

But what I don't understand is this:

```
$ git branch -v
* (no branch)            e11727c revert the change to .gitignore
  master                 1456c52 Merge branch 'ticket/14482' into public/sage-git/master
  public/sage-git/master cf14c84 [behind 578] Merge branch 'ticket/14482' into public/sage-git/master
  ticket/15120           6912669 Fix --new option for doctests.
```

How can I make the branch ticket/15120 point to commit e11727c?

I've merged this into the build_system branch at #14480, so I'm marking
this as a duplicate so that we can close this ticket now.

Robert: the build_system branch should now have all doctests pass, so you shouldn't need to maintain a separate branch for the patchbot.
