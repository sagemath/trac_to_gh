This issue was discussed before. We have the functionality in `FDerivativeOperator`, it's just not available on top level or as a method on BuiltinFunction instances:

[http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.mathematics.sage.devel/58041](http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.mathematics.sage.devel/58041)

I thought this stuff was on trac somewhere already, but I cannot find it presently. For archival purposes:

```
from sage.symbolic.operators import FDerivativeOperator
class Doperator:
    def __init__(self,vars=None):
        self.vars= [] if vars is None else vars

    def __call__(self,f):
        return FDerivativeOperator(f,self.vars)

    def __getitem__(self,i):
        if isinstance(i,tuple):
            newvars=self.vars+list(i)
        else:
            newvars=self.vars+[i]
        return Doperator(newvars)

D=Doperator()
```

With that code one can input the form that sage prints:

```
sage: var('x,y')
sage: D[0](f)(x, y)/x + D[0, 1](f)(x, y)
D[0](f)(x, y)/x + D[0, 1](f)(x, y)
```

Input will never be in Leibnitz notation, since unevaluated functions do not have names for their parameters, just position numbers for them.
