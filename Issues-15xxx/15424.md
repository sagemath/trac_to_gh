Yet another leak (this test is with #15303):

```
sage: import gc
sage: K = IntegerModRing(111115)
sage: C = type(K)
sage: len([1 for bla in gc.get_objects() if isinstance(bla,C)])
1
sage: K.has_coerce_map_from(ZZ)
True
sage: del K
sage: _ = gc.collect()
sage: len([1 for bla in gc.get_objects() if isinstance(bla,C)]) # no leak
0
sage: a = K.get_action(ZZ, op=operator.add, self_on_left=True)
sage: del K,a
sage: _ = gc.collect()
sage: len([1 for bla in gc.get_objects() if isinstance(bla,C)])
0
sage: K = IntegerModRing(111115)
sage: a = K.get_action(ZZ, op=operator.mul, self_on_left=True)
sage: b = ZZ.get_action(K, op=operator.mul, self_on_left=False)
sage: del K,a,b
sage: _ = gc.collect()
sage: len([1 for bla in gc.get_objects() if isinstance(bla,C)]) # no leak
0
sage: K = IntegerModRing(111115)
sage: x = K.one()
sage: del K,x
sage: _ = gc.collect()
sage: len([1 for bla in gc.get_objects() if isinstance(bla,C)]) # no leak
0
sage: K = IntegerModRing(111115)
sage: x = K.one()*2
sage: del K,x
sage: _ = gc.collect()
sage: len([1 for bla in gc.get_objects() if isinstance(bla,C)]) # LEAK
1
```

This is astonishing. Wouldn't one think that getting (thus, caching) a coercion or getting an action should trigger a leak, or creating an element? No, we actually need to multiply two elements to find the leak.

Surprising:

```
sage: K = IntegerModRing(111115)
sage: K.get_action(ZZ, op=operator.mul, self_on_left=True) is None
True
sage: ZZ.get_action(K, op=operator.mul, self_on_left=True) is None
True
```
Shouldn't there be an action? OK, perhaps not, since coercion is used for the multiplication:

```
sage: cm = sage.structure.element.get_coercion_model()
sage: cm.explain(K,ZZ, op=operator.mul)
Coercion on right operand via
    Natural morphism:
      From: Integer Ring
      To:   Ring of integers modulo 111115
Arithmetic performed after coercions.
Result lives in Ring of integers modulo 111115
Ring of integers modulo 111115
```
But if coercion is used, then why is establishing a coercion not enough to trigger the leak? In a new session:

```
sage: import gc
sage: K = IntegerModRing(111115)
sage: C = type(K)
sage: phi = K.coerce_map_from(ZZ)
sage: x = phi(2)
sage: del K,phi,x
sage: _ = gc.collect()
sage: len([1 for bla in gc.get_objects() if isinstance(bla,C)])
0
```

        if id(r) in found_IDs or type(r) not in X:
            print "skipping",type(r)
            continue
        R.append(r)
        found_IDs.add(id(r))
        new.extend(gc.get_referrers(r))
        print "type(r)=%s len(R)=%s len(new)=%s"%(type(r),len(R),len(new))
    return R

    "body": "<a id='comment:8'>**Comment 8:**</a>\nOuch. I thought that in our coercion model, maps and actions are cached on the level of parents. Now I see that they *additionally* are cached in the coercion model!\n\nApparently this additional cache is not always used. For example, it is not used if you just do `K.coerce_map_from(ZZ)`. But it seems that a coercion map *is* stored in the additional cache if you do a multiplication.\n\nAnd then you have a strongly referenced `TripleDict`, a key `(ZZ,K,None)` and a morphism `phi:ZZ->K` as value. Even with #14711, `phi` would strongly reference `K`. `ZZ` is immortal. Hence, the callback for the item `(ZZ,K,None):phi` will never be called.\n\nWhat shall we do about it? Isn't it the case that we are only storing maps that already are cached on the level of parents? Then it would be safe to just store a *weak* reference to this map, and the problem was solved.",

Ouch. I thought that in our coercion model, maps and actions are cached on the level of parents. Now I see that they *additionally* are cached in the coercion model!

Apparently this additional cache is not always used. For example, it is not used if you just do `K.coerce_map_from(ZZ)`. But it seems that a coercion map *is* stored in the additional cache if you do a multiplication.

And then you have a strongly referenced `TripleDict`, a key `(ZZ,K,None)` and a morphism `phi:ZZ->K` as value. Even with #14711, `phi` would strongly reference `K`. `ZZ` is immortal. Hence, the callback for the item `(ZZ,K,None):phi` will never be called.

What shall we do about it? Isn't it the case that we are only storing maps that already are cached on the level of parents? Then it would be safe to just store a *weak* reference to this map, and the problem was solved.

Argh. Schemes seem to hate me.

Almost always when I implement something that fixes a problem, it turns out that some examples from sage.schemes will fail, because the elliptic curve code relies on what I intended to fix.

But this time it is extreme:

sage -t src/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_rational_field.py  # 652 doctests failed
