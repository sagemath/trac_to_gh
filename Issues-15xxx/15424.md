Yet another leak (this test is with #15303):

```
sage: import gc
sage: K = IntegerModRing(111115)
sage: C = type(K)
sage: len([1 for bla in gc.get_objects() if isinstance(bla,C)])
1
sage: K.has_coerce_map_from(ZZ)
True
sage: del K
sage: _ = gc.collect()
sage: len([1 for bla in gc.get_objects() if isinstance(bla,C)]) # no leak
0
sage: a = K.get_action(ZZ, op=operator.add, self_on_left=True)
sage: del K,a
sage: _ = gc.collect()
sage: len([1 for bla in gc.get_objects() if isinstance(bla,C)])
0
sage: K = IntegerModRing(111115)
sage: a = K.get_action(ZZ, op=operator.mul, self_on_left=True)
sage: b = ZZ.get_action(K, op=operator.mul, self_on_left=False)
sage: del K,a,b
sage: _ = gc.collect()
sage: len([1 for bla in gc.get_objects() if isinstance(bla,C)]) # no leak
0
sage: K = IntegerModRing(111115)
sage: x = K.one()
sage: del K,x
sage: _ = gc.collect()
sage: len([1 for bla in gc.get_objects() if isinstance(bla,C)]) # no leak
0
sage: K = IntegerModRing(111115)
sage: x = K.one()*2
sage: del K,x
sage: _ = gc.collect()
sage: len([1 for bla in gc.get_objects() if isinstance(bla,C)]) # LEAK
1
```

This is astonishing. Wouldn't one think that getting (thus, caching) a coercion or getting an action should trigger a leak, or creating an element? No, we actually need to multiply two elements to find the leak.

Surprising:

```
sage: K = IntegerModRing(111115)
sage: K.get_action(ZZ, op=operator.mul, self_on_left=True) is None
True
sage: ZZ.get_action(K, op=operator.mul, self_on_left=True) is None
True
```
Shouldn't there be an action? OK, perhaps not, since coercion is used for the multiplication:

```
sage: cm = sage.structure.element.get_coercion_model()
sage: cm.explain(K,ZZ, op=operator.mul)
Coercion on right operand via
    Natural morphism:
      From: Integer Ring
      To:   Ring of integers modulo 111115
Arithmetic performed after coercions.
Result lives in Ring of integers modulo 111115
Ring of integers modulo 111115
```
But if coercion is used, then why is establishing a coercion not enough to trigger the leak? In a new session:

```
sage: import gc
sage: K = IntegerModRing(111115)
sage: C = type(K)
sage: phi = K.coerce_map_from(ZZ)
sage: x = phi(2)
sage: del K,phi,x
sage: _ = gc.collect()
sage: len([1 for bla in gc.get_objects() if isinstance(bla,C)])
0
```

I tried to see where the reference can be coming from:

    found_IDs.add(id(R))
    found_IDs.add(id(globals()))    
    while len(new)>0:
        r=new.pop()
        if id(r) in found_IDs or type(r) not in X:
            print "skipping",type(r)
            continue
        R.append(r)
        found_IDs.add(id(r))
        new.extend(gc.get_referrers(r))
        print "type(r)=%s len(R)=%s len(new)=%s"%(type(r),len(R),len(new))
    return R

def getR():
    K = IntegerModRing(111115)
    C = type(K)
    phi = K.coerce_map_from(ZZ)
    del phi
    #vary this line:
    x = K.one()*2
    #del K,x
    _ = gc.collect()
    X=set([list,dict,tuple,
           RingHomset_generic_with_category,

and I found that with `x=K.one()*2` there is also a TripleDict that show up. It's fairly big (44 entries) and the entries all seem to be of the form `D[domain,codomain,None]=morphism from domain to codomain` (or `None` entries).

Hm. Is there any global `TripleDict` beside the one in `sage.categories.homset`? With grep, I found none. But in this case, the values would not be morphisms but homsets.

I did not run the complete doctests, but I have added a new test that shows that I have fixed the problem. It is orthogonal to #14711.

As I said above: The idea is to only keep a weak reference from coercion model to coerce maps, which needs to make morphisms weakrefable, and which should be safe because the maps are cached on their dodomain anyway.

Argh. Schemes seem to hate me.

Almost always when I implement something that fixes a problem, it turns out that some examples from sage.schemes will fail, because the elliptic curve code relies on what I intended to fix.

But this time it is extreme:

```
sage -t src/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_rational_field.py  # 652 doctests failed
```

No. `CoercionModel_cache_maps._coercion_maps` stores tuples (namely: pairs of coercion maps, in both directions, hence, often `(mor,None)` or `(None,mor)`). We can't weakref the tuples.
