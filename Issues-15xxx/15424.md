Yet another leak (this test is with #15303):

```
sage: import gc
sage: K = IntegerModRing(111115)
sage: C = type(K)
sage: len([1 for bla in gc.get_objects() if isinstance(bla,C)])
1
sage: K.has_coerce_map_from(ZZ)
True
sage: del K
sage: _ = gc.collect()
sage: len([1 for bla in gc.get_objects() if isinstance(bla,C)]) # no leak
0
sage: a = K.get_action(ZZ, op=operator.add, self_on_left=True)
sage: del K,a
sage: _ = gc.collect()
sage: len([1 for bla in gc.get_objects() if isinstance(bla,C)])
0
sage: K = IntegerModRing(111115)
sage: a = K.get_action(ZZ, op=operator.mul, self_on_left=True)
sage: b = ZZ.get_action(K, op=operator.mul, self_on_left=False)
sage: del K,a,b
sage: _ = gc.collect()
sage: len([1 for bla in gc.get_objects() if isinstance(bla,C)]) # no leak
0
sage: K = IntegerModRing(111115)
sage: x = K.one()
sage: del K,x
sage: _ = gc.collect()
sage: len([1 for bla in gc.get_objects() if isinstance(bla,C)]) # no leak
0
sage: K = IntegerModRing(111115)
sage: x = K.one()*2
sage: del K,x
sage: _ = gc.collect()
sage: len([1 for bla in gc.get_objects() if isinstance(bla,C)]) # LEAK
1
```

This is astonishing. Wouldn't one think that getting (thus, caching) a coercion or getting an action should trigger a leak, or creating an element? No, we actually need to multiply two elements to find the leak.

Surprising:

```
sage: K = IntegerModRing(111115)
sage: K.get_action(ZZ, op=operator.mul, self_on_left=True) is None
True
sage: ZZ.get_action(K, op=operator.mul, self_on_left=True) is None
True
```
Shouldn't there be an action? OK, perhaps not, since coercion is used for the multiplication:

```
sage: cm = sage.structure.element.get_coercion_model()
sage: cm.explain(K,ZZ, op=operator.mul)
Coercion on right operand via
    Natural morphism:
      From: Integer Ring
      To:   Ring of integers modulo 111115
Arithmetic performed after coercions.
Result lives in Ring of integers modulo 111115
Ring of integers modulo 111115
```
But if coercion is used, then why is establishing a coercion not enough to trigger the leak? In a new session:

```
sage: import gc
sage: K = IntegerModRing(111115)
sage: C = type(K)
sage: phi = K.coerce_map_from(ZZ)
sage: x = phi(2)
sage: del K,phi,x
sage: _ = gc.collect()
sage: len([1 for bla in gc.get_objects() if isinstance(bla,C)])
0
```

Hm. Is there any global `TripleDict` beside the one in `sage.categories.homset`? With grep, I found none. But in this case, the values would not be morphisms but homsets.

As I said above: The idea is to only keep a weak reference from coercion model to coerce maps, which needs to make morphisms weakrefable, and which should be safe because the maps are cached on their dodomain anyway.

<a id='comment:13'></a>Argh. Schemes seem to hate me.

Almost always when I implement something that fixes a problem, it turns out that some examples from sage.schemes will fail, because the elliptic curve code relies on what I intended to fix.

But this time it is extreme:

```
sage -t src/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_rational_field.py  # 652 doctests failed
