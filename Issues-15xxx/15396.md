There are two failures when the TestSuite is run on affine or projective space. They are `test_an_element`, `test_some_elements`.  The first just needs an implementation of `an_element` which is done in this ticket. The second seems to be an underlying issue with `test_category` and will not be addressed here.

Keywords: **sage-days55, TestSuite**

Is this what you got?

I do not know. Maybe this is not so important anyway. All commits will appear in the history. If you want something very clean, it is possible (but not recommended, I think) to smash all 3 commits into one using

```
git rebase -i develop
```
and replacing two "apply" with "s" (standing for "stash") in the file that will open.

Once again, I think this is not necessary, and things are good as they stand now.
