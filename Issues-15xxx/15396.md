There are two failures when the TestSuite is run on affine or projective space. They are `test_an_element`, `test_some_elements`.  The first just needs an implementation of `an_element` which is done in this ticket. The second seems to be an underlying issue with `test_category` and will not be addressed here.

Well, if you multiply by always the same integer, this can of course give always zero.

I will run the the tests soon, but my original fix had fixed the problem for me. Just to double check, there are two issues with the testsuite (see original description above), this is only fixing the issue with `test_an_element()` and not `test_some_elements()`.

Is this what you got?

```
git rebase -i develop

and replacing two "apply" with "s" (standing for "stash") in the file that will open.

Once again, I think this is not necessary, and things are good as they stand now.
