There are two failures when the TestSuite is run on affine or projective space. They are `test_an_element`, `test_some_elements`.  The first just needs an implementation of `an_element` which is done in this ticket. The second seems to be an underlying issue with `test_category` and will not be addressed here.

Well, if you multiply by always the same integer, this can of course give always zero.

My proposal ensures that at least one half of the coordinates is not zero, because the difference between consecutive terms is just R.an_element().

I was able to run this tonight. I'm getting the `test_an_element()` is fixed and the `test_category()` is still causing the other failure. The other failure is not addressed here.

Is this what you got?

I do not know. Maybe this is not so important anyway. All commits will appear in the history. If you want something very clean, it is possible (but not recommended, I think) to smash all 3 commits into one using

```
git rebase -i develop
```
and replacing two "apply" with "s" (standing for "stash") in the file that will open.

Once again, I think this is not necessary, and things are good as they stand now.
