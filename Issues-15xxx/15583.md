I'd like to have `sage.numerical.linear_functions.LinearConstraint` to be a hashable type.
Currently it is not:

```
sage: p = MixedIntegerLinearProgram()
sage: b = p.new_variable()
sage: b[0] <= b[1] <= 2
x_0 <= x_1 <= 2
sage: hash(b[0] <= b[1] <= 2)
...
TypeError: unhashable type: 'sage.numerical.linear_functions.LinearConstraint'
```

This is for the following reasons:

1)  When adding constraints to an instance of a `MixedIntegerLinearProgram`, it is not necessary to add the same or equivalent constraint multiple times.  A hash could be used to determine distinct linear constraints that are added into a MILP instance.  
2) By having hashable linear constraints, one could allow for linear constraints to be added into sets (http://docs.python.org/2/library/sets.html) or used as keys in dictionaries.


Thanks,
Clinton

Also, constraints are really held in the backend, and in fact they can get modified once they are processed.
