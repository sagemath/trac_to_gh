I'd like to have `sage.numerical.linear_functions.LinearConstraint` to be a hashable type.
Currently it is not:

```
sage: p = MixedIntegerLinearProgram()
sage: b = p.new_variable()
sage: b[0] <= b[1] <= 2
x_0 <= x_1 <= 2
sage: hash(b[0] <= b[1] <= 2)
...
TypeError: unhashable type: 'sage.numerical.linear_functions.LinearConstraint'
```

This is for the following reasons:

1)  When adding constraints to an instance of a `MixedIntegerLinearProgram`, it is not necessary to add the same or equivalent constraint multiple times.  A hash could be used to determine distinct linear constraints that are added into a MILP instance.  
2) By having hashable linear constraints, one could allow for linear constraints to be added into sets (http://docs.python.org/2/library/sets.html) or used as keys in dictionaries.


Thanks,
Clinton

IMHO, typically solvers are able to deal with multiple constraints, etc.

Also, constraints are really held in the backend, and in fact they can get modified once they are processed.
