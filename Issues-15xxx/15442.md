As reported by Thierry Monteil :

```
sage: graphs.PetersenGraph().dominating_set(solver="Coin",verbose=2)
ImportError: /home/ncohen/.Sage/local/lib/libCoinUtils.so.3: undefined symbol: dgetrf_
```

Looks like `dgetrf` is defined in LAPACK. I added it to the dependencies and it now works. No idea why it changed, and in particular I'll be quite happy to see all optional packages automatically tested at each release `:-P`
