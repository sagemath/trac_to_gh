Fortunately, the PDF build is logged. If the PDF build fails, maybe we could get better error-reporting: report, for example, if there is a (recent?) LaTeX file in `output/latex/en/reference/MODULE/` but no PDF file in `output/pdf/en/reference/MODULE/`. Or switch to a serial build to isolate the problem.

Comparing with `make`, I don't want `make` to interrupt concurrent workers, so I don't think I want docbuilding to do this, either.
