Currently, the following occurs:

```
sage: import mpmath
sage: mpmath.mpf(0)^(-2)
Exception ZeroDivisionError: ZeroDivisionError() in 'sage.libs.mpmath.ext_impl.MPF_pow' ignored
mpf('0.0')
```

This also causes problems in other functions (this should be a singularity of the function):

```
sage: mpmath.zeta(2r,-4r)
Exception ZeroDivisionError: ZeroDivisionError() in 'sage.libs.mpmath.ext_impl.MPF_pow' ignored
mpf('3.0685451779593373')
```

This is because the `MPF_pow` Cython function does not declare an exception value.
