The iterator for

```
class SemistandardSkewTableaux_shape
```
runs over all weights in

```
IntegerVectors(self.p.size(), self.p.size())
```
which seems rather arbitrary. To conform with the iterator in the analogous class

```
class SemistandardTableaux_shape
```
we will allow for an additional entry `max_entry`.

The best for now is probably to do the same as what is done in Tableaux.
