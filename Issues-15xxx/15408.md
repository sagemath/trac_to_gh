The current documentation for `inner_plethysm` reads

```
f.inner_plethysm(g + h) == f.inner_plethysm(g) + f.inner_plethysm(h).
```
This is false (see an example below), and in fact

```
(f+g).inner_plethysm(h) == f.inner_plethysm(h) + g.inner_plethysm(h)
```
and it is only true that

```
p[k].inner_plethysm(f+g) == p[k].inner_plethysm(f) + p[k].inner_plethysm(g).
```
It is also true that 

```
(f*g).inner_plethsym(h) == (f.inner_plethsym(h)).itensor(g.inner_plethsym(h)).
```
In fact these three statements and the definition for `p[k].inner_plethysm(p(mu))` is how inner plethysm is defined.

For example

```
sage: s[3].inner_plethysm(s[2,1]+s[3])-s[3].inner_plethysm(s[2,1])-s[3].inner_plethysm(s[3])
2*s[2, 1] + s[3]
sage: (s[3]+s[2,1]).inner_plethysm(s[2,1])-s[3].inner_plethysm(s[2,1])-s[2,1].inner_plethysm(s[2,1])
0
sage: p[5].inner_plethysm(s[2,1]+s[3])-p[5].inner_plethysm(s[2,1])-p[5].inner_plethysm(s[3])
0
sage: p[3,2].inner_plethysm(s[2,1])-p[3].inner_plethysm(s[2,1]).itensor(p[2].inner_plethysm(s[2,1]))
0
```
Moreover the doc tests don't catch errors that were (probably?) introduced in edits since #3244.

```
sage: p[4,3].inner_plethysm(p[2,2,1])
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

<a id='comment:4'></a>Darij, my example of when the statement is when `g` and `h` are of the same degree, so my edits are only to try to make the doc string clearer.

One of the reasons that I changed it was because I don't understand the meaning of the sentence "`f.inner_plethysm(g)` is a polynomial in the coefficients of `g`"  It should be a symmetric function, not a polynomial.  The other phrase that appears throughout the docstring is "determine its values."   Unfortunately I don't understand what is meant by the *values* of a symmetric function.  My modifications of the docstring avoid the word *values* because I don't understand what is intended by that phrase.

I also think that there is something wrong in the sentence

```
we can think of the function `g` as the character of a representation of the 
general linear group, and hence (by Schur-Weyl duality) as the character of
a representation `\rho` of the symmetric group `S_n`.
```
To my eye, `g` would not be a character of an S_n representation, but it would be a generating
function for the character (Frobenius image of the character).  This is not a serious problem since the object of interest is the representation `\rho`, but  I find the use of Schur-Weyl duality an unnecessary complication in the explanation.

Please read the docstring that I wrote.  Is it clearer?  Can you improve it more?

<a id='comment:6'></a>Some quick answers before I come to the real review.

It seems that it would be better to move methods in one commit and do edits in another, for the sake of diff working sanely.

The sentence "f.inner_plethysm(g) is a polynomial in the coefficients of g" meant to say that f.inner_plethysm(g) depends polynomially on the coefficients of g. What I was trying to achieve there is to explain how to compute inner plethysm outside of the homogeneous Schur-positive case. This is also why I made that confusing linearity-in-distinct-degrees claim. Your docstring seems much better, so I'm not wishing mine back.

<a id='comment:14'></a>Here are two slight rewordings of what Mike proposes.

1. Change:

```
Here is an axiomatic definition of the operation (where in the equations
below we denote outer product
(:meth:`~sage.categories.algebras_with_basis.AlgebrasWithBasis.ParentMethods.product`)
by `\cdot` and the Kronecker product (:meth:`itensor`) by `\ast`):
```
  to

```
First we describe the axiomatic definition of the operation; see below for
the representation-theoretic definition.
In the following equations, we denote outer product
(:meth:`~sage.categories.algebras_with_basis.AlgebrasWithBasis.ParentMethods.product`)
by `\cdot` and the Kronecker product (:meth:`itensor`) by `\ast`).
```


2. For the representation-theoretic definition:

```
This operation admits a representation-theoretic interpretation
in the case where `f` is a Schur function `s_\lambda` and
`g` is a homogeneous degree `n` symmetric function with
positive integral coefficients in the Schur basis.
The symmetric function ``f.inner_plethysm(g)`` is the Frobenius
image of the `S_n`-representation constructed as follows.

The assumptions on `g` imply that `g` is the Frobenius image of a
representation `\rho` of the symmetric group `S_n`:

.. MATH::

    \rho : S_n \to GL_N

If the degree `N` of this representation is greater than or equal
to the number of parts of `\lambda`, then `f`, which denotes `s_\lambda`,
corresponds to the character of some irreducible `GL_N`-representation, say

.. MATH::

    \sigma : GL_N \to GL_M

The composition `\sigma \circ \rho : S_n \to GL_M` is a representation
of `S_n` whose Frobenius image is precisely ``f.inner_plethysm(g)``.

If `N` is less than the number of parts of `\lambda`,
then ``f.inner_plethysm(g)`` is `0` by definition.
```
  Personally, I like to see `\rho: S_n \to GL_N` and `\sigma: GL_N \to GL_M` displayed in this way with domain and codomain, so that I can see the composition. So I re-worded the text to take this into account.

Otherwise, patch looks good to me.

<a id='comment:15'></a>I've done something to the branch which I don't fully understand myself. Sorry. But I think the docstrings are better now, even if it's best to use diff to compare them with what they were. I haven't done Franco's suggestions, but I agree with them! (Except I wouldn't call the representation-theoretical definition a definition, as it doesn't cover all cases.)
