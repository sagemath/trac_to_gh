`Algebras` is currently the category of associative unital
algebras. #10963 further introduces the category of algebras (not
necessarily unital nor associative) as `MagmaticAlgebras`. It's
been decided on sage-devel [1] that MagmaticAlgebras should eventually be
renamed as `Algebras`, and the current `Algebras` to
`AssociativeUnitalAlgebras` (or even just
`Algebras(...).Associative().Unital()`).

This is not done directly in #10963 to not add a backward incompatible
change to this already huge ticket.
