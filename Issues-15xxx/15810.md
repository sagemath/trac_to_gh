`O_o`

No problem with SparseGraph backends ? Then I don't get it either.

I do not know if it is what you ask with your second question, but `git push trac local_branch:remote_branch` will upload `local_branch` on Trac where it will be called `remote_branch`. `remote_branch` can be something like `public/168543843` or `u/your_trac_login/7687687`.

Where ? 

- There is a `Graph._directed` which cannot be renamed to .directed, for that's an internal variable
- With this ticket there is a `CGraphBackend._directed`, and only that.
- There is a `CGraph.directed`, as before.

How simple can it get ? We only store this boolean 3 times, and probably have as many functions that only return its value `>_<`

Because several lines above those two lines, `self._backend` is created using the backend's constructor, which takes the value `True/False` as an input. 

And well, setting the value of a private variable of the backend is the backend's constructor's job. So this way, the constructors of !Graph and DiGraph do not mess with what they should not touch, the value of `_directed` is set only in the backend's constructor's code, and there is no fancy alias in the backend that is set where there should not be.
