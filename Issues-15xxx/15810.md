No idea `O_o`

It's merged anyway, so what's the point ?

I'm trying to find out why your branch works while I thought it wouldn't.

git fetch trac `public/15810:local_branch` will fetch this branch and call it `local_branch` on your computer.

I do not know if it is what you ask with your second question, but `git push trac local_branch:remote_branch` will upload `local_branch` on Trac where it will be called `remote_branch`. `remote_branch` can be something like `public/168543843` or `u/your_trac_login/7687687`.

Where ? 

- There is a `Graph._directed` which cannot be renamed to .directed, for that's an internal variable
- With this ticket there is a `CGraphBackend._directed`, and only that.
- There is a `CGraph.directed`, as before.

How simple can it get ? We only store this boolean 3 times, and probably have as many functions that only return its value `>_<`
