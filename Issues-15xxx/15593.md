Remark on sqlalchemy: As noted on [sage-devel](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/4HvpjPCdARw), the current spkg-install of sqlalchemy contains a bug. It says

```
rm -rf "$SAGE_LOCAL/lib/python/site-packages/SQLAlchemy*"
```
but should say

```
rm -rf "$SAGE_LOCAL"/lib/python/site-packages/SQLAlchemy*
```
as otherwise the old sqlalchemy version will not be removed and will still be used even when installing a new version.

Otherwise, upgrading sqlalchemy-spkg is trivial. Shall I open a separate ticket?
