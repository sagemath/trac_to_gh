This ticket improves the construction of PARI power series and Laurent series (the method `gen.Ser()`) to correctly handle some inputs (exact 0, vector) and to get the default series precision from the appropriate PARI setting.

Furthermore, the method `gen.eval()` is extended so that the single unnamed argument syntax used for polynomials now also works for series and rational functions.

The dependence on #15549 is because without it, the element `pari_instance.PARI_ZERO` (which is sometimes returned) doesn't have a parent.
