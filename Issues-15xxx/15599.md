This ticket improves the construction of PARI power series and Laurent series (the method `gen.Ser()`) to correctly handle some inputs (exact 0, vector) and to get the default series precision from the appropriate PARI setting.

Furthermore, the method `gen.eval()` is extended so that the single unnamed argument syntax used for polynomials now also works for series and rational functions.

The dependence on #15549 is because without it, the element `pari_instance.PARI_ZERO` (which is sometimes returned) doesn't have a parent.

This last commit has not been merged, see the discussion at [sage-devel](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/tQhromqp9hQ/KDCvCnKEd1kJ).
As it is "only" a merge of 6.2.beta4, I do not open a new ticket.
