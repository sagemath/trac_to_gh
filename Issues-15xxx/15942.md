```
actual=`md5 $file | sed 's/[^0-9a-f].*//'`
```
makes no sense, because that's not what's returned (at least on Macs).

```
md5 -q
```
actually does work, though I don't know how portable this is.

Why do we use different invocations of `md5` in `sage-spkg` vs. `sage-fix-pkg-checksums`? We could instead change `sage-spkg` to use
