Likely due to #15609.

Common Python pitfalls are that the sort order of sets / dict entries can be dependent on memory locations.

I have changed the output of the test so that when it fails again we get the (random) input values that caused failure. In this way, when it fails again it will be much easier to debug.

This does not fix the issue, there must still be a bug in the `ryser` algorithm, but I think that we can close the bug nevertheless until a new test failure report comes.
