Dan Drake just reported on sage-devel that building cddlib 094g fails on his system because apparently some (32-bit) `libgmp.so` from `/usr/local/lib` gets picked up, too(!):

```
/bin/bash ../libtool --tag=CC   --mode=link gcc  -g -O2 -L/usr/local/lib -L/var/tmp/ddrake/sage/local/lib  -o scdd_gmp simplecdd.o ../lib-src-gmp/libcddgmp.la -lgmp 
libtool: link: gcc -g -O2 -o .libs/scdd_gmp simplecdd.o -L/usr/local/lib -L/var/tmp/ddrake/sage/local/lib ../lib-src-gmp/.libs/libcddgmp.so /var/tmp/ddrake/sage/local/lib/libgmp.so /usr/local/lib/libgmp.so -Wl,-rpath -Wl,/var/tmp/ddrake/sage/local/lib
/usr/local/lib/libgmp.so: could not read symbols: File in wrong format
```

(Apparently only `libsrc` is affected, not `src`.)

We may have to reintegrate Volker's `--with-gmp` patch...
