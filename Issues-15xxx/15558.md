The current help for `sage --dev` says this:

```
~Â» sage --dev help
usage: sage-dev [-h] subcommand ...

The developer interface for sage.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit

subcommands:
    abandon             Abandon a ticket or branch.
    checkout            Checkout another branch.
<snip>
```
The following line should be added at the end

```
Optional argument for subcommands:
    -h, --help          show help message for subcommand and exit
                        usage: sage-dev subcommand --help
```
I was thinking that the one liner explanation for the subcommands seemed too terse. And then I couldn't understand why there was no way to get expanded help on the subcommand.

Secondly, `sage --dev` should be added to the current scripts so that this `--dev` option shows up on invoking `sage --advanced`.
