Python 3 introduces new dict-methods and changes the behavior of existing. 


Changes according to `lib2to3/fixes/fix_dict.py`:

```
d.keys() -> list(d.keys())
d.items() -> list(d.items())
d.values() -> list(d.values())

d.iterkeys() -> iter(d.keys())
d.iteritems() -> iter(d.items())
d.itervalues() -> iter(d.values())

d.viewkeys() -> d.keys()
d.viewitems() -> d.items()
d.viewvalues() -> d.values()
```
**TODO**: Clarify whether some generated changes need modifications to avoid unnecessary wrappings with list().

This ticket is tracked as a dependency of meta-ticket ticket:16052.

<a id='comment:1'></a>Here are the (approximate) numbers for the dict-methods in the Sage .py modules:
No .**view**xxxx() were found
|              ||                      ||                      |
|--------------||----------------------||----------------------|
|              ||   case: .xxxx()      ||   case: .iterxxxx()  |
|xxxx (method) | nbr lines | nbr calls | nbr lines | nbr calls |
|keys()        | 414       | 430       | 19        | 19        |
|values()      | 216       | 216       | 15        | 15        |
|items()       | 284       | 330       | 293       | 295       |
The effect of 2to3 fix_dict is:
* `d.xxxx()` is converted to `list(d.xxxx())`.
  * For Py2.7 the original code gives a list.
    
The converted code gives also a list.
    
//But the converted code performs an EXTRA dictionary copy! //
* For Py3.3 the original code would be a view (not a list) and therefor **different** from the Py2.7 behavior.
    
The converted code gives a list (as in Py 2.7 for both code variants).

* `d.iterxxxx()` is converted to `iter(d.xxxx())`.
  * For Py2.7 the original code gives an iterator.
    
The converted code results in an iterator - 
    
//but this iterator is created ON TOP of the list returned by d.xxxx().//
* For Py3.3 the original code is **not excepted**.
    
The converted code gives an iterator on a view (and is similar to the iterators in Py 2.7 for both code variants).

In summary
* the original code in Py 2.7 //is equivalent to// 
* the converted code in Py 2.7 //is equivalent to//  
* the converted code in Py 3.3
In both cases (.xxxx() and .iterxxxx()) the converted code suffers an overhead in Py2.7!


The `six` library module offers a solution without this overhead: it defines 3 new **functions**: `iterkeys(d), itervalues(d), iteritems(d)`. In Py2.7 they are implemented by `d.iterkeys(), d.itervalues(), d.iteritems()` and in Py3.3 by `d.keys(), d.values(), d.items()`. 

The catch is that the code must be manually modified (use the new functions in place of the old dictinary methods) - and the module `six` must be imported.

What to do?
* The approaches (2to3 and six) could be combined. 
* And in some places/contexts the wrapping `list(d.xxxx())` could be removed manually when a list is not required.
* Another option is sometimes to use `key in d` together with `d[key]` as appropriate.
  This code has the same behavior in Py2.7 and Py3.3. But manual code change is required

There is no undisputed **best** solution :-(

Suggestions are welcome!
