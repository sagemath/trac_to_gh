While looking at #13642, I noticed the following:

```
sage: k = GF(5)
sage: D.<x> = k[]
sage: l.<x> = k.extension(x^2 + 2)
sage: R.<t> = l[]
sage: f = t^4 + (2*x - 1)*t^3 + (2*x + 1)*t^2 + 3
sage: h = t^4 - x*t^3 + (3*x + 1)*t^2 + 2*t + 2*x - 1
sage: pow(f, 2, h)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
RuntimeError                              Traceback (most recent call last)
...
RuntimeError: PowerMod: bad args

sage: pow(t, 2, x) # segfault
```
This occurs on a clean 6.1.

It was a problem with the use of NTL modular exp which does not like the base of equal or higher degree than the modulus.

At least the two problems mentioned in the ticket description and involving NTL are fixed now.

The polynomial stuff needs major refactoring anyway, we should move the template files to different folders in the spirit of what was done in #12555 for p-adics, use templating for additional classes, etc.; so let's postpone the other issues I reported here to follow up tickets.
