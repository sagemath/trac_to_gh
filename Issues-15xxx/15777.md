While looking at #13642, I noticed the following:

```
sage: k = GF(5)
sage: D.<x> = k[]
sage: l.<x> = k.extension(x^2 + 2)
sage: R.<t> = l[]
sage: f = t^4 + (2*x - 1)*t^3 + (2*x + 1)*t^2 + 3
sage: h = t^4 - x*t^3 + (3*x + 1)*t^2 + 2*t + 2*x - 1
sage: pow(f, 2, h)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
RuntimeError                              Traceback (most recent call last)
...
RuntimeError: PowerMod: bad args

sage: pow(t, 2, x) # segfault
```
This occurs on a clean 6.1.

Depends on #13642

It was a problem with the use of NTL modular exp which does not like the base of equal or higher degree than the modulus.
