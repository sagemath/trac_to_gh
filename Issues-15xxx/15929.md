The goal of this ticket is primarily to serve as a repository for developing an opengl interface to sage for 2d and 3d graphics.  Of particular interest is unifying the code that displays graphics in the browser and in a console.  Further, the goal is to provide for interactive capabilities, such as more responsive `@`interact environments.
