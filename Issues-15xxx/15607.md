The original Stein-Watkins database was created in 2003.  In 2007, a few revisions and additions were made to the data.  In this ticket we upgrade the git optional/huge spkgs database_stein_watkins_mini and database_stein_watkins to version 20070827.

The replacement data files are at [http://modular.math.washington.edu/ecdb/FIX.tar](http://modular.math.washington.edu/ecdb/FIX.tar).
