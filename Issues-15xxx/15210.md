```
    sage: from sage.matrix.operation_table import OperationTable
    sage: R=Integers(2)
    sage: T=OperationTable(R, operation=operator.mul)
    sage: view(T)
    *** boom ***
```
And indeed, there is a spurious \ in 2\ex in the latex output:

```
    sage: T._latex_()
    '{\\setlength{\\arraycolsep}{2\ex}\n\\begin{array}{r|*{2}{r}}\n\\multicolumn{1}{c|}{\\ast}&a&b\\\\\\hline\n{}a&a&a\\\\\n{}b&a&b\\\\\n\\end{array}}'
```

I am wondering if we should not actualy run latex whenever we doctest a latex method. That is include something like

```
    sage: view(T, viewer=None)
```
Or just

```
    sage: view(T)
```
If we configure `view` to not actually run the viewer when in doctest mode.

Remember that LaTeX isn't a prerequisite of Sage, so we could only do that as optional doctest.

The patch obviously fixes the bug.
