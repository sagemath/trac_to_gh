The obvious fix is to restrict to the case of nonsingular varieties; this behavior would match the existing function for counting points on a toric variety.

<div id="comment:18" align="right">Comment 18</div>

We should add a documentation example where the fan is not complete.  The blowup of a point, where the fan has two cones, one from [(1,0),(1,1)] and one from [(0,1),(1,1)] would be a nice choice: in that setting, you can see a projective line when the coordinate corresponding to (1,1) is 0.

This code throws errors when the toric variety has torus factors (that is, when the rays of the fan do not span the vector space associated with N).  For example:

V = ToricVariety(Fan([Cone([(1,0)])]))

VF = V.change_ring(GF(3))

list(VF.point_set())

yields:

ValueError: there must be 2 coordinates! Got only 1: (0,)

This behaviour does not really surprise me.  When a toric variety has torus factors, the choice of homogeneous coordinates is non-canonical.  I assume homogeneous coordinates are not implemented in Sage for such a variety.
