As detailed in #14885, it is not healthy for code to rely on the `__mul__` operation on permutations, since this operation depends on the `Permutations().global_options()['mul']` variable which can change at runtime. It is better to use the `left_action_product` and `right_action_product` methods introduced in #15174 (formerly known as `_left_to_right_multiply_on_left` and `_left_to_right_multiply_on_right`).

My tests show some dependence on the `__mul__` method in `sage/groups/semimonomial_transformations/semimonomial_transformation.pyx` and `sage/groups/semimonomial_transformations/semimonomial_transformation_group.py`, although it might be that only one of these files depends on it and the other depends on the first file. Unfortunately I don't have time to study this in detail, as I'd first have to read up on the definitions.

Thanks for taking care of this. The dependency is gone indeed. Could you maybe also document the choice of multiplication order in the (module) documentation? And while at that:

```
A semimonomial transformation group over a ring `R` of length `n` is equal to
the semidirect product of the monomial transformation group
(also known as the complete monomial group) and the group of ring automorphisms.
```
either it should be "The semimonomial...", not "A semimonomial...", or it should be "a group of ring automorphisms", not "the group of ring automorphisms". In general, it should be impossible to compute the group of all automorphisms of a ring, so I suspect it's either "a group" or you are only considering finite fields?

Where does `Permutation.action` depend on the multiplication order? I agree, the function isn't very useful because it's easier to write it oneself than to figure out what exactly it does; but it seems to be self-contained. (It also has significant space for optimization... whoever wrote it seems not to have realized that permutations can be iterated over. I'll fix this in a separate ticket.)

I prefer using `R^{\times}` instead of `R*` for the multiplicative group of units of `R` (the latter notation could be a dual of `R` and either way seems to be a typographic substitute), but this is probably a judgment call (particularly seeing that you use `*` for multiplication).

In

```
        `\psi^{\pi, \alpha} = (\alpha(\psi_{\pi(0)}), \ldots, \alpha(\psi_{\pi(n-1)}))` 
```
you are using 0-based indexing of permutations; I'm not sure if this is what you want (it's doc, not code).

You speak of the semimonomial group over a ring R of either "length n" (in the definition) or "degree n" (in other parts of the doc). I think it would help to settle upon one notation (or define them both).

Other than this, the code looks fine. Thanks for the quick response, and set this to positive_review once the above issues are fixed!

> Where does `Permutation.action` depend on the multiplication order? I agree, the function isn't very useful because it's easier to write it oneself than to figure out what exactly it does; but it seems to be self-contained.

Well, what I wanted to say is, that we need two functions to implement the action of the permutation group on list/vectors of length `n`, depending on the multiplication rule used for the definition of the symmetric group. 

The current implementation of `Permutation.action` corresponds to the action from the left and the multiplication defined by `right_action_product`. 

Using `left_action_product` for the multiplication in the group and still acting from the left would force us to define the action method in the following way:

```
pi * (v_1, ..., v_n) := (v_{pi^{-1}(1)}, ... , v_{pi^{-1}(n)})
```

But this should become the topic of a separate ticket.

Thanks for your careful reading, I think I have fixed them all.

Attention: branch change!

I'm a bit surprised that you changed the definite articles back to the indefinites, so I'm suggesting to change them back in my commit. (Also, "the group of degree n over a ring R" sounds better than "the group over a ring R of degree n" to my ears.)

If my edits are OK to you, please set this to positive_review. Thanks for your work!

EDIT: I see what you mean by adding new `action` methods, but frankly I don't see much of a point in those methods anyway. At least I can rewrite that functionality faster than I could read through the docstring to tell which of the many possible actions it implements.
