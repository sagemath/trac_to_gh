As detailed in #14885, it is not healthy for code to rely on the `__mul__` operation on permutations, since this operation depends on the `Permutations().global_options()['mul']` variable which can change at runtime. It is better to use the `left_action_product` and `right_action_product` methods introduced in #15174 (formerly known as `_left_to_right_multiply_on_left` and `_left_to_right_multiply_on_right`).

My tests show some dependence on the `__mul__` method in `sage/groups/semimonomial_transformations/semimonomial_transformation.pyx` and `sage/groups/semimonomial_transformations/semimonomial_transformation_group.py`, although it might be that only one of these files depends on it and the other depends on the first file. Unfortunately I don't have time to study this in detail, as I'd first have to read up on the definitions.

I think there should be only this single occurrence of the `__mul__` method in the file. Maybe you can check this with your tests?

```
A semimonomial transformation group over a ring `R` of length `n` is equal to
the semidirect product of the monomial transformation group
(also known as the complete monomial group) and the group of ring automorphisms.
```
either it should be "The semimonomial...", not "A semimonomial...", or it should be "a group of ring automorphisms", not "the group of ring automorphisms". In general, it should be impossible to compute the group of all automorphisms of a ring, so I suspect it's either "a group" or you are only considering finite fields?

I prefer using `R^{\times}` instead of `R*` for the multiplicative group of units of `R` (the latter notation could be a dual of `R` and either way seems to be a typographic substitute), but this is probably a judgment call (particularly seeing that you use `*` for multiplication).

In

```
        `\psi^{\pi, \alpha} = (\alpha(\psi_{\pi(0)}), \ldots, \alpha(\psi_{\pi(n-1)}))` 
```
you are using 0-based indexing of permutations; I'm not sure if this is what you want (it's doc, not code).

You speak of the semimonomial group over a ring R of either "length n" (in the definition) or "degree n" (in other parts of the doc). I think it would help to settle upon one notation (or define them both).

Other than this, the code looks fine. Thanks for the quick response, and set this to positive_review once the above issues are fixed!

Well, what I wanted to say is, that we need two functions to implement the action of the permutation group on list/vectors of length `n`, depending on the multiplication rule used for the definition of the symmetric group. 

The current implementation of `Permutation.action` corresponds to the action from the left and the multiplication defined by `right_action_product`. 

Using `left_action_product` for the multiplication in the group and still acting from the left would force us to define the action method in the following way:

```
pi * (v_1, ..., v_n) := (v_{pi^{-1}(1)}, ... , v_{pi^{-1}(n)})
```

But this should become the topic of a separate ticket.

Thanks for your careful reading, I think I have fixed them all.
