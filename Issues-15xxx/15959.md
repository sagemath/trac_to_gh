It would be desirable to make the hash value of (combinatorial) free
module elements depend on the hash value of the parent. However this
currently breaks some code (see
e.g. sage.combinat.crystals.kyoto_path_model.KyotoPathModel).

This code indeed assumes, in dictionary look-ups, that an element of
some free module over ZZ and its counter part over QQ (in the case at
hand, the weight lattice and the weight space), comparing as equal
because of a coercion, have the same hash value.

Yet another case of equality using coercion being harmful:

Sorry, I should have provided steps to reproduce. Checkout branch #15931 at commit a2bbe7f297caeb73bda1f8ce31af9ee21b90a26b, and run the tests on the Kyoto path model.
