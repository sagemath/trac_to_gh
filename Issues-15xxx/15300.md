Is there an established class for bilinear forms (not necessarily symmetric!) on free modules? I'd need one to get anywhere towards the Clifford-exterior iso.

The `scalar` function as it stands is rather useless, since on the exterior algebra it just returns the product of the constant coefficients of `self` and `other`. What should be made (I can do that) is the lift of a bilinear (not quadratic) form on `V` to the exterior algebra of `V` (using the Gram matrix).

There is a stupid `__repr__` bug I've no idea how to fix.

```
sage: A = CliffordAlgebra(QuadraticForm(QQ, 3, [1,0,-1,3,-4,5]))
sage: A.basis()
Finite family {(0, 1): e0*e1, (1, 2): ee2, (0,): e0, (1,): e1, (0, 1, 2): e0*ee2, (2,): e2, (): 1, (0, 2): e0*e2}
```
See the `ee2`? It's an `e1*e2`, which the `__repr__` routine seems to simplify to `ee2` because `1*` can be omitted, right? One way to deal with it would be to not use the multiplication signs; what do you think about that?

(Also, the doctests of `lift_isometry` are wrong -- could you compute them by hand and re-insert them? Thank you.)

EDIT: Oh, I see, the bug is in `repr_from_monomials` of `weyl_algebra.py`, not in some big free-module module.

OK, enough for today. I've left you a question in the latest commit.

Also, what exactly does this do?

```
        E = super(ExteriorAlgebra, cls).__classcall__(cls, R, names)
```
I thought it would classcall ``cls`` as a ``CliffordAlgebra``, but then shouldn't it give it a quadratic form?

I've added a cohomology part as well, but there's still some tweaks left to do.

That passes to the `__classcall__` (not `__classcall_private__`) of the class `CliffordAlgebra`, which just ends up constructing the object.

I'm done looking at the Clifford algebra classes, and I'll look at the Exterior algebra classes once you're done implementing homology; so the next step is likely to be the general Weyl algebra. If I'll have any troubles with the OOP (I imagine there might be issues with making differential Weyl algebras inherit from Weyl algebras), I'll let you know.

Well, to parse the input into a standard form and then create the object using those standardized inputs (or sometimes to emulate a factory).

It's done. The only thing left is some documentation and to make the exterior algebra more functor-like, and I should get that done tonight.

Random comments and questions:

Note that when you're using `CombinatorialFreeModule`, you shouldn't need both `_repr_term` and `_repr_` for elements: just use `_repr_term`. You should also delete the `_latex_` method for elements.

For the function `repr_from_monomials`, I wonder if `repr_lincomb` (defined in `sage.misc.latex`) does kind of the same thing?

By the way, can you compute the centers of any of these algebras? If so, having a method which returns it would be very nice.

As I recall, `repr_lincomb` doesn't have as nice of printing (IMO) as `repr_from_monomials` with regard to spacing with the base ring being a polynomial ring.

> By the way, can you compute the centers of any of these algebras? If so, having a method which returns it would be very nice.

A counter question, do you want the honest center or the supercenter of the Clifford/exterior algebra?

For the honest center, it should be trivial (given there is an even and odd element) since given an odd `x` and even `y`, we have `xy = -yx + LOT`. The exterior algebra is supercommutative, so its supercenter is the entire algebra. For general Clifford algebras, my first thought is it would correspond to rows of 0 in the quadratic form, but IDK off the top of my head for certain.

It seems like it would be better to fix `repr_lincomb` than to add new code which reproduces a lot of its functionality. How should a user decide which of these to use, if they're both available? But maybe I'm missing something.

I meant the honest center. For exterior algebras, this is easy: it's the evenly graded part.

I haven't checked to see how many doctests would need to be fixed, but I was worried it was a lot. I'll look into it.

I think you should do:

- `if self.base_ring() is R:` in `_element_constructor_` instead of the `==`.
- Move the unshuffle out into `combinat/combinat.py` since it is a general (low-level) operation.
- Is using the `remove_zeros` option the fastest, as opposed to doing the `!= R.zero()` check (which probably should be pulled out?)

Otherwise your changes look good. For the interior product, I'm using the definition I gave (the other one should be equivalent to the first one...) with `\alpha` as `x`.

PS - John, I'm still working on the centers.

Thanks for the docs! I'll look into them (currently I'm recompiling Sage, for the third time within 2 days). Is it really your intention to denote the supercommutator by `[x, y\}`?

The `Classification_of_Clifford_algebras#Pseudoscalar` wikipedia link is misformatted.

<div id="comment:105" align="right">comment:105</div>

Thanks for catching my stupid mistake in the supercommutator doctests!

The reason why I said "exactly one" rather than "only one" is this:

```
sage: w = E.boundary({(0,1): 0, (1,2): 0, (2,0): 0})
sage: w2 = E.boundary({(0,1): 0, (1,2): 0})
sage: w == w2
False
```

Is this an issue? Is `w2` still functional?

Sorry for my renewed slowdown; the good news is that semester isn't going to go on forever.

> https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/d3aba3ff1bcfb9acc035013fb7f794de57c8f09e

It's a trac issue (likely due to a merge (to be) done `permutation.py`). Here's what I got when I pulled the branch:

I've push a rebased branch which takes care of that. Are you getting back to finishing the review here?

I might be able to finish the review, but I'm not sure. Meanwhile, a few questions and comments:

- should there be a `weyl_algebra` (or similarly named) method for polynomial rings, so this could be found by tab completion once you had a polynomial ring `R`?
- should it be possible to do `W.<dx0, dx1, ...> = DifferentialWeylAlgebra(R)`?

Some links are broken in clifford_algebra.py:

The `__monomial` gets name mangled because of the 2 underscores by python. Sage hasn't become so fickle, so much as numerical imprecision/noise on different machines can be hard to foresee (or something like that). I think the tolerance for the noise has been slightly increased and the buildbots need updating, but IDK for sure right now.

I didn't take a real look at this, but there are some issues here:

```
+ - It's a simple ring that is not a matrix ring over a division ring.
+ - It's a non-commutative domain.
+ - For `n = `, it's a quotient of the universal enveloping algebra of the
+ Heisenberg algebra.
+ - Has no finite-dimensional representations in characteristic zero.
```
The "simple" part holds when R is a field. The "non-commutative domain" works only if R is an integral domain. In the third line, what is n ? (I think it is always a quotient of U(Heisenberg_n).

The question is do we want to return a `Family` indexed by the variable names, which makes it act like a `dict` and have some specified order of output, or act like a list where the ordered of the output is the order of the input.

There's actually somewhat of mismatch and that `algebra_generators` should match the behavior of `variables` and `differentials`. The reason why `inject_variables` works is because of a specified order of `gens`, not `algebra_generators` (which would also be tweaked accordingly).

This is the design of the function, and if it returns `True`, then `coerce_map_from` creates a map using `_element_constructor_`. There are times when it's easier/better-design to implement a custom morphism (like for a module with basis using `module_morphism`).

I don't object to your design choice. My question was maybe more practical: is it ever safe to do `dx,dy,dz=W.differentials()`, or should they always be sorted? If it's not really safe, then there shouldn't be examples like that in the documentation.

I think adding some examples using `inject_variables` would be useful.

The docstring basically says, "if A, then return either X or Y, and otherwise return Z". A natural question is, when does it return X and when Y? Presumably it's not a coin flip.

<div id="comment:158" align="right">comment:158</div>

Thanks from me, too, John and Travis! Care to review one final piece of code? I have added the lifted bilinear form on the exterior algebra.

TODO list for further patches:

WEYL:

- Weyl algebras in general. This will be mostly copypasting the structure of the Clifford algebra class.

- Differential Weyl algebra as a particular case of a Weyl algebra (I think the matrix is the block matrix \\ (0 -I \\ I 0) \\ here). Is this best achieved by having DifferentialWeylAlgebra inherit from WeylAlgebra, or better by coercions from one to the other? (I hope it's the former.)

CLIFFORD:

- The canonical isomorphism between a Clifford algebra and an exterior algebra induced by a bilinear (! not quadratic !) form. This isomorphism, and its inverse, are particular cases of a common construction (Bourbaki's "Algèbre IX", §9, no. 2-3; Ricardo Baeza's "Quadratic Forms over Semilocal Rings", Lecture Notes in Mathematics 655, Springer 1978): If f and g are two bilinear forms on a module V, and if F and G are their corresponding quadratic forms (so F(x) = f(x, x) and G(x) = g(x, x)), then there is a canonical isomorphism from Cl(V, F) to Cl(V, F + G), which however depends on g and not just on G.

- Use this Clifford-exterior isomorphism to define constant coefficients and scalar products on Clifford algebras. This will depend on a bilinear form.

- Check if the scalar product on the Clifford algebra allows a faster way to compute the lifted bilinear form on the exterior algebra.
