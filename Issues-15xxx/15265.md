The additional functionality included in this patch are:

- various possibilities for the tessellation of the fundamental domain (Dedekind, coset, none)
- membership test via the Lang, Lim, Tan algorithm
- improved LaTeX output (via xymatrix)
- reduction to cusp
- identify cusp class

Added tests for LLT algorithm and reduction to cusp.

Is the graph for the Farey symbol just some equation or a graph. I would opt for the latter. 

I have modified the `_latex_` of the Farey symbol  so that it does work with sagemath cloud. 
To illustrate that it is fairly easy to use the current version of the latex output (one thing which 
has been bugging me for a long time is the extra brackets in the latex output in a sage worksheet) I included two examples
how to use it.

The only other alternative I see is to add yet another property to the Farey symbol like graph() or the like to keep the nice
latex format.

<a id='comment:17'></a>Hartmut, could you review the few changes that I made to your code? I have the following questions/comments, which you could help me with:

reference for rademacher_matrix in farey.cpp?
farey.cpp:FareySymbol(istream& is) why not "is >> *this" ?
farey.cpp:370 : it seems that x will always have length 1.
farey.cpp:129 I understand this is tempting, but PRETTY_FUNCTION is gcc only.
farey_symbol.pyx:plot rgbcolor option does not apply to Dedekind tesselation.  Add one example each

I still need to test the code, but hopefully I'll have time for this tomorrow.

<a id='comment:19'></a>Martin,

- the reference for the Rademacher matrix  is http://www.jstor.org/stable/2371313 .
- what did you want to say about is >> *this?
- fair enough and true: len(x)==1 here
- PRETTY_FUNCTION is a leftover from testing 
- true, what is a consistent naming scheme?
- I liked the format "sting" ;-)

all the changes seem to be okay. I think there was one more test for odd and even groups which try to remember ... .
