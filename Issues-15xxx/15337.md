Before:

```
sage: a=RealField(10**6).one(); timeit('a.ulp()')
625 loops, best of 3: 42.9 µs per loop
```

After:

```
sage: a=RealField(10**6).one(); timeit('a.ulp()')
625 loops, best of 3: 6.13 µs per loop
```

The patch also adds a `field` argument, which can be used to result in a different `RealField`. It also adds a related `epsilon()` method, defined as `a.epsilon() = a/2^a.precision()`.

I don't know how you ran the doctests, but it must have been in an invalid way because the errors clearly have nothing to do with the patch and you're testing `.pyc` files which are normally not tested (I bet you would get the same results without my patch).

So please run, from `SAGE_ROOT` something like

```
$ make ptestlong
```
or

```
$ ./sage -t --long --all
```
or

```
$ ./sage -t --long devel/sage/sage  # Skipping notebook and doc
```

"Adding or subtracting something less than half an ulp always gives the same number (unless the number is exactly a power of 2...)": the case of the opposite of a power of 2 is missing here, also this assumes the rounding mode is to nearest.

I don't see the logic of returning `self` for NaN but not for infinities.

Since the patch also adds tests for `fp_rank` (which I discovered) I tested it too:

```
sage: a=RR(0).ulp()
sage: a.exact_rational()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
RuntimeError                              Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-22-2b55db8a739a> in <module>()
----> 1 a.exact_rational()

/localdisk/tmp/sage-5.12/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/rings/real_mpfr.so in sage.rings.real_mpfr.RealNumber.exact_rational (sage/rings/real_mpfr.c:18776)()

/localdisk/tmp/sage-5.12/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/rings/integer.so in sage.rings.integer.Integer.__pow__ (sage/rings/integer.c:14022)()

RuntimeError: Segmentation fault
```

Finally this looks strange:

```
sage: a=RR(0).ulp()
sage: a.str(16)
'1.0000000000000@-1152921504606846976'
sage: b=a.nextabove()
sage: b.str(16)
'1.0000000000001@-1152921504606846976'
```
If `a` is the smallest positive non-zero number, then the next number should be `2*a`. In other words, the difference between two floating-point numbers is always a multiple of `a` (and thus always a floating-point number), which is not the case here:

```
sage: b-a
0.000000000000000
```

Replying to [@zimmermann6](#comment:11):
> "Adding or subtracting something less than half an ulp always gives the same number (unless the number is exactly a power of 2...)": the case of the opposite of a power of 2 is missing here, also this assumes the rounding mode is to nearest.

Fair enough, this documentation should be fixed.

> I don't see the logic of returning `self` for NaN but not for infinities.

So what do you prefer: never returning `self`? returning `self` for `NaN` and `+Inf` but not for `-Inf`?

> Since the patch also adds tests for `fp_rank` (which I discovered)

That's an indepedent bug deserving a new ticket: #15363.

> If `a` is the smallest positive non-zero number, then the next number should be `2*a`.

In MPFR, this isn't true since MPFR doesn't have denormal numbers.

> So what do you prefer: never returning self? returning self for NaN and +Inf but not for -Inf?

I would prefer consistency: either always returning self, or never returning self (unless there is a good reason for not being coherent).

While playing with ulp I noticed something strange:

```
sage: a=RDF(0)
sage: a, a.ulp()
(0.0, 4.94065645841e-324)
sage: b, b.ulp()
(4.94065645841e-324, 0.0)
```

The same holds with RR:

```
sage: a=RR(0)
sage: a, a.ulp()
(0.000000000000000, 8.50969131174084e-1388255822130839284)
sage: b=a.ulp()
sage: b, b.ulp()
(8.50969131174084e-1388255822130839284, 0.000000000000000)
```

Finally:

> In MPFR, this isn't true since MPFR doesn't have denormal numbers.

agreed.

<div id="comment:18" align="right">comment:18</div>

I retract part of my comment [comment:17] since it works correctly with the patch:

```
sage: a=RDF(0)
sage: a, a.ulp()
(0.0, 4.94065645841e-324)
sage: b=a.ulp()
sage: b, b.ulp()
(4.94065645841e-324, 4.94065645841e-324)
```
and with RR:

```
sage: a=RR(0)
sage: a, a.ulp()
(0.000000000000000, 8.50969131174084e-1388255822130839284)
sage: b=a.ulp()
sage: b, b.ulp()
(8.50969131174084e-1388255822130839284, 8.50969131174084e-1388255822130839284)
```

Thus the only remaining issue is whether we return self or a new object.
Since this is a minor issue, I give a positive review.
