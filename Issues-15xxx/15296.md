Hi Stefan,

There are several methods in LinearMatroid that need to be adjusted for this, roughly _line_ratios() through _cross_ratio_test() in the linear_matroid.pyx source. I would suggest writing a second version for each of these routines which is safe for field of fractions, keeping the unsafe but fast version to use for `safe' fields. The initializer of LinearMatroid should sniff out the unsafe fields and make sure that in such cases the safe methods get called throughout. 

Now in c++ I would know how to do this, simply let the initializer replace the the pointers to the unsafe methods by pointers to their corresponding safe versions, but can this be done in cython? If so, I propose I write the safe versions and you fix up the initializer to finish up.
