Several run time paths in the python library are hardwired, in most cases to `$SAGE_LOCAL`.
`$SAGE_LOCAL` has no meaning outside of Sage (the distribution). So it's better to add them to sage-env.py and make them overridable.

For example in `libs.singular.singular_init`, the singular shared object is looked for in `$SAGE_LOCAL/lib`.

#15100 is not too important. particularly for standalone sagelib it doesn't matter. anyhow, the doctest checking the fist line of the ipython (or any other) executable needs to be removed.

I raised the issue of `qepcadrc` before,but it has to be done in conjunction of fixing the spkg in question.

In sage-on-gentoo I just got rid of `sage-started.txt` it is one of those appendages that don't really belong anywhere sensible. `/var/lib/sage`?

I am not sure about the catalogue of `DATA_DIR` and `INCLUDE_DIR` (and in line with my previous post `csage` is gone).

Did you know that lib{s,S}ingular is the only file that is dlopen-ed in sage. There should be a better way of getting to it.

Do not ever use `SAGE_SRC` for something that's needed at runtime. I could let go of that for doctesting as you do, but that makes things harder to test in sage-on-gentoo.

Overall I am not overly impressed by the amount of stuff showed in `env.py`. Some of that stuff may also conflict with #20382 which I very much would like to see merged.

> I raised the issue of qepcadrc before,but it has to be done in conjunction of fixing the spkg in question.

sage_location (whatever it tries to do) should be moved out of sagelib. it's not needed there. i don't remember what qepcadrc was exactly about, but there was headache involved.

> In sage-on-gentoo I just got rid of sage-started.txt

maybe sage should touch ~/.sage/started instead? this is often writable... does sage-started.txt implement anything useful at all?

> Did you know that lib{s,S}ingular is the only file that is dlopen-ed in sage. There should be a better way of getting to it.

it's hard to get a broken implementation right. iirc theres has never been a technical reason for not just linking. so maybe... just link? (see my ancient comment in env.py).

> Do not ever use SAGE_SRC for something that's needed at runtime. I could let go of that for doctesting as you do, but that makes things harder to test in sage-on-gentoo.

there is some sort of interactive source browser. how would that work without SAGE_SRC? i think i did this [1] (also installed the source) to fix it.

> stuff showed in env.py

too many *DIR variables? true. there are better ways: each extension should have its own configuration (read: should be a standalone package depending on sagelib). i think, we are simply not there yet. cf. [2] for the intended (workaround) implementation.

I agree with Felix on this. 

We do need lots of these variables, because we no longer want to assume that everything lives in the same prefix hierarchy ("SAGE_LOCAL").

Whether these kind of configuration variables should go into env or into another centralized module, is another question.

No, it was introduced as a check by Jeroen (when he was the release manager) to check that sage does starts. So it is produced at the end of the build process and checked and regenerated if missing when sage is started.

I don't really know what that does. Never used it. So in sage-on-gentoo `SAGE_SRC` points to `/usr/lib{,64}/python2.7/site-packages/sage` and I install the necessary `pxd` and `pyx` to run test.

Yes I guess if you are thinking of a modular approach where components can be installed anywhere on the system, like hashdist or spack, you want to use variable like CPATH and LIBRARY_PATH, set when you load the components in the environment. Stuff under SAGE_LOCAL/share is still an issue in that case.

On a system like sage-on-gentoo where things still live under a single prefix (but is a more conventional one) keeping SAGE_LOCAL is not a big deal. Apart from `etc` I just use it like it was `--prefix=/usr`.

iirc, this variable was needed to point to some maxima fragment, which is in different places, depending on where sage is run from. obviously there must be a better solution (including one that does not use a file like this one).

Here's my version of Felix's branch, rebased on a recent develop branch.  I think I preserved all the changes between the original version of his branch, and the more recent version from https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/4846a73aad7cf7361c69a6ae43628b8cae821b9f  So this removed many changes from the original branch, such as the change to how sage-maxima.lisp is located.

It would still be good to have a solution for that.  But for now, this will let us look at what changes this branch does make (that are still relevant).

`sage.env` is the wrong place for this. (not saying that, sage.misc.misc is any better, i hardly remember why it ended up there.).

GRAPHS_DATA_DIR certainly belongs to the part of code that uses graphs data... not to the core library (which i think env.py belongs to).

because it breaks modularity. the core library should not have to know about extensions.

or the other way: there should be a way to extend sage/sagelib by merely installing something. then GRAPH_DATA (as well as some others listed in sage.env), should use that mechanism.

another remark: this is not just about environment variables. an extension should possibly add *anything*. but environment might be a good example, then generalize.

> for now [..] throwing everything in sage.env is appropriate. 

agreed.

thanks for the feedback.

what do you mean by 'installation directory of the whole GAP package'? the prefix?

note that the datadir (ought to be platform independent!) usually/generally/commonly not hardcoded to the prefix, hence the different name.

so, it's not prefix (it does not seem relevant, does it?).

paths are subject to the conventions and standards on particular platforms (e.g. FSH), not to an "unusual installation process". package data usually goes to /usr/share/$packagename, and thats where i can find the gap data on my platform. hence, here, /usr/share/gap is GAP_DATA_DIR, and not GAP_DIR as you suggest.

(on a different platform it might be in a different place, but it's still "the place where the gap data is).

Anyway, where **your distro** installs GAP does not matter. We are working on Sage here, and `$SAGE_LOCAL/gap/latest` is the directory where GAP as a whole is installed. It's not a directory containing data files, so `GAP_DATA_DIR` is a bad name.

- with the status quo of how the Sage spkg installs GAP into `$SAGE_LOCAL`, 
- and with the way how a distribution such as Debian installs GAP into `/usr`.

On the other hand, if there's a wish to change the way how the Sage spkg install GAP, then that clearly belongs on a different ticket (please open it if it does not exist yet), not on this one.

i really don't see your problem here, Jeroen. can you explain what you want to use GAP_DIR for?

if you intend to use GAP)DIR for something other than the (platform indepentdent static, package specific) gap data, then you will break a standard FHS install. i know you are against standards, but why would you want that terrible implicit breakage here?

with all do respect, you got it wrong.

on debian, the (platform indepentdent static, package specific) gap data goes to /usr/share/gap

> Shoves most of the stuff under `/usr/lib{,64}/gap` with appropriate links or script in standard location pointing there. In that scheme GAP_DATA_DIR is `/usr/lib{,64}/gap/pkg` although some of the databases live under `/usr/lib{,64}/gap` directly.

not quite. /usr/lib is for platform dependent stuff. that's why you need lib{32,64} but only shared (not shared{32,64}). GAP_DATA_DIR is about *platform independent data*.

> There is a lot to do upstream to get `gap` to install nicely in any kind of fashion.

wrong again. you can install gap any way you like, despite the broken build/install system

> I think `GAP_DIR` is more apt than `GAP_DATA_DIR`.

now with three wrong premises, you end up on the wrong track.

instead, you could (plan to) fix the gap ebuild to adhere to FHS, as most other gentoo packages do.

i feel the need for a gowdin's style law for this sentence, but it's not there. so i will better stop posting here now.

I agree with Felix here.  I don't care how gap happens to be installed in Sage.  The use that variable is to find where the GAP data lives (which in Sage, which I guess obeys GAP's "unusual" installation, happens to be the directory where all of GAP is installed).

It seems to me all this argument might be for not much then.  It seems to me all it's really used for is in the utility function `gap_root()`, which itself is not actually used anywhere in Sage (which is not to say nobody uses it for something).

Perhaps we can call it `GAP_ROOT_DIR` for now and leave it at that.  Distros that try to break GAP up into a standard hierarchy would have to have their own definition of what `GAP_ROOT_DIR` means I guess.

Two more details:

1. in `src/sage/env.py`, remove

```
UNAME = os.uname()[0]
```
as `UNAME` is actually one of the standard variables.

2. In `src/sage/libs/gap/util.pyx`, remove `gapdir = GAP_ROOT_DIR` and just use `GAP_ROOT_DIR` instead of `gapdir`.

If you fix these and all tests pass, then this can be set to positive_review.

Now that it has made it onto Volker's branch and I can see easily how it interact with sage-on-gentoo, I feel sorry about all that `GAP_ROOT_DIR` business.

We should just have eliminated it because it is totally unnecessary. The variable is only used in `sage/libs/gap/util.pyx` in the function `gap_root` which basically return the value of `GAP_ROOT_DIR`

```
def gap_root():
    """
    Find the location of the GAP root install which is stored in the gap
    startup script.
    EXAMPLES::
        sage: from sage.libs.gap.util import gap_root
        sage: gap_root()   # random output
        '/home/vbraun/opt/sage-5.3.rc0/local/gap/latest'
    """
    import os.path
    if os.path.exists(GAP_ROOT_DIR):
        return GAP_ROOT_DIR
    print('The gap-4.5.5.spkg (or later) seems to be not installed!')
    gap_sh = open(os.path.join(SAGE_LOCAL, 'bin', 'gap')).read().splitlines()
    gapdir = filter(lambda dir:dir.strip().startswith('GAP_DIR'), gap_sh)[0]
    gapdir = gapdir.split('"')[1]
    gapdir = gapdir.replace('$SAGE_LOCAL', SAGE_LOCAL)
    return gapdir
```
So if `GAP_ROOT_DIR` is not defined, a mwarning is issued and then the `gap` script is looked over for `GAP_DIR` which gives the right result both in Gentoo [sage-on-gentoo relies solely on the automated procedure] and in vanilla sage. Not sure about debian, I must say.

But I feel we were silly because the automated procedure works well so we don't really need the variable. And if we decide to use the variable, what is the point of keeping the function `gap_root`? Apart from searching for all the instances of `gap_root` to replace them that is.

Anyway, that's a potential clean up for another ticket.

Replying to [@kiwifb](#comment:113):
>[...] I feel sorry about all that `GAP_ROOT_DIR` business.
> We should just have eliminated it because it is totally unnecessary. The variable is only used in `sage/libs/gap/util.pyx` in the function `gap_root` which basically return the value of `GAP_ROOT_DIR` [...]
> So if `GAP_ROOT_DIR` is not defined, a mwarning is issued and then the `gap` script is looked over for `GAP_DIR` which gives the right result both in Gentoo [sage-on-gentoo relies solely on the automated procedure] and in vanilla sage. 

Yes, I saw this code. I think it does not belong into sagelib proper, but we should move it to compile-time configuration of sagelib (which would set the GAP_ROOT_DIR variable). So I do think that introducing the GAP_ROOT_DIR variable was a good step.

Yes.  I can think of at least two reasons:

1) Helpful for some system (not that I have one in mind) where the search code doesn't work--it's always kind to provide some way to configure an alternate path.

2) For testing against alternate GAP installs.

1) a good case is probably cross compilation of some kind, where things will be available at runtime but not when you build.

2) well I was thinking of asking `gap` directly (I have tested this) so the only requirement is for the `gap` executable to be in the `PATH`. However technically there is more than one valid path that should be looked up and libgap only look at one (the default system one).
