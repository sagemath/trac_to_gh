```
$ ./sage -dev checkout --ticket 15482
...

you should give more information in the docs on what commands a potential reviewer will need, i.e. sage -b, tools to analyze coverage etc.

Replying to [ticket:15816 rws]:
> How can I avoid this?

You could try simply `./sage -b` instead of `make` to rebuild only the Sage library. However, there is no guarantee that this will work.

> It's supposed to be a complete binary...

It is, but it can obviously not contain stuff from tickets that have not been merged yet.

> Alternatively, give more information in the docs on what the user has to expect with the binary distribution.

The same as with the source distribution, if you change package versions, those new versions will need to be built.

Where do you think we should add this documentation? [Here](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/installation/binary.html) perhaps?

it says:

*You can now test the ticket; youâ€™ll probably want to call make or sage -b first to rebuild Sage with the changes.*

I think you should go into detail what builds with the one and the other, or give a link to a page with all commands one might need when looking at more than one ticket.
