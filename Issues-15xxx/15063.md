This patch series brings the French translation of the tutorial up to date with the English version as of 2a7ddf97856d72e40423231e238b1e7eca5d67fa. Or at least I think so: apparently it has happened in the past that changes to the English version went unnoticed. I followed the git history to make my changes, so I shouldn't have missed anything, but who knows.

The translation is a bit rough at places, and reviewer patches to improve the style are of course welcome, but I think is better to ship an imperfect translation than none at all!

Hellooooooooooo !

I agree with these commits, though you seem to have based them on an old version of Sage  `O_o`

I rebased them on `[FIXUP] 5.12.beta1: update git specific files`, and added my commit at the top. Nonimportant stuff only, plus a paragraph that was missing.

It's all at u/ncohen/15063, and I think that you should now import from there what you like `:-)`

Anyway, if you agree with this last commit, you can update your branch and set the ticket to  positive_review`

Hi Nathann,

Thanks for the review!

I'd rather not rebase the branch, so I just cherry-picked your commit.

> Nonimportant stuff only, plus a paragraph that was missing.


That was actually intentional, though I forgot to mention it on the ticket: I find this paragraph redundant and created #15048 to suggest removing it. But since you translated it, let's keep it for now.

> Anyway, if you agree with this last commit, you can update your branch and set the ticket to  positive_review`


In the meantime I noticed some junk I pasted by mistake in the middle of an example. Another example needs  to be updated due to changes merged in 5.12β3. Here are two more trivial patches to fix these issues; I'll let you set the ticket to `positive_review` after having a quick look it that's okay with you.
