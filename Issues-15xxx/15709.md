From the [google notebook bug reports](https://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=pCwvGVwSMxTzT6E2xNdo5fA)

```
# I lost several hours because Sage silently converted a number defined mod n to an integer 
# when it appeared as an exponent.
# I was working in a different cyclotomic field, but the problem is right here in the complex numbers.
# I believe I should have to explicitly convert to an integer unless the answer only depends on the value mod n.
a=Mod(3,2)
print type(a),a,2*a,(i^2)^a,i^(2*a)

Output:
<type 'sage.rings.finite_rings.integer_mod.IntegerMod_int'> 1 0 -1 1
```

This must surely have been discussed before. I would have tried to look up the discussion if I thought there was any hope that someone could convince me that this is not actually a bug.

Related, Nils Bruin reported on #11797:

```
sage: p=7
sage: k=GF(p)
sage: k(2)^k(p)
1
sage: (GF(7)(2))^(GF(5)(2))
4
sage: k(2)^p
2
```
It looks like it's simply quietly lifting the exponent to the integers, which it shouldn't do because there is no coercion in that direction (only a conversion):

```
sage: k.<a>=GF(p^2)
sage: k(2)^k(p)
1
sage: k(2)^k(a)
TypeError: not in prime subfield
sage: ZZ(k(1))
1
sage: ZZ(k(a))
TypeError: not in prime subfield
```
There is one side-effect of this that does look elegant:

```
sage: R=Integers(p-1)
sage: (k(2))^(R(p))
2
```
but in general I'd say an error should result from exponentiations like this.

I added a pointer from #24247 to here. Disallowing powering by `IntegerMod` elements is easy.

The hard part is allowing `x ^ Mod(a, n)` only where it makes sense. If we do that, ideally it should be done using generic code. Something like:

```
def pow_intmod(x, a, n):
    if x^n != 1:
        raise ArithmeticError("power not defined")
    return x^a
```
The problem is that checking `x^n != 1` costs performance and that it might not work properly in non-exact rings.
