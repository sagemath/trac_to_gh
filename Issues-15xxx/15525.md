```
Currently the following breaks:

```
sage: P = Partitions(5, max_length=4)
sage: loads(dumps(P))
```
since `PartitionOptions` does not pickle, hence the `IntegerListsLex`, which takes it as an (optional) input, does not.

The proposed solution is two-fold:

- Add a class for partitions that inherit from `IntegerListsLex` (or use it as an iterator).
- Add a warning when using the `global_options` parameter that the resulting class might not pickle.

Here's also a discussion on sage-combinat-devel:

https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/sage-combinat-devel/Hyak8ndRi4o

I'm also going to add parent classes for k-regular partitions.

So far only noticing very minor issues.

* In the definition of being \ell-regular, it should mention that m_i is the multiplicity of i in the partition. The first time I looked at this, I thought that m_i was maybe referring to the part sizes. In the source code you can just search for 'm_i' to see what it means, but in the HTML doc 'm_i' is always going to be Tex'd and harder to search for. Also, `character_polynomial()` doc used a_i to refer to the multiplicity of i in a permutation alpha, so maybe that should be changed to m_i to be consistent.
* Does the code ever check that \ell is an integer, and preferably a nonnegative one?
