Hi Travis!

Thanks for your work on free monoids and algebras; those features have been waiting around for too long! I glanced through the code, and here are some random thoughts that came to my mind:

- Rather than importing `IndexedFreeMonoid` in the global namespace,
  it would be preferable to have `FreeMonoid(...)` construct an
  `IndexedFreeMonoid` when given appropriate arguments (and same
  things for its friends). Let's avoid the bad route we took with
  `CombinatorialFreeModule` and have at once a single entry point for
  free monoids! As an immediate side effect, the current code for
  the `FreeAlgebra` might well make it almost immediately work for any
  index set.

- Mathematically speaking, the free algebra indexed by I is
  (isomorphic to) the algebra of the free monoid indexed by I is
  (isomorphic to) the tensor algebra of the free module indexed by I. So we now have three implementations of the free algebra!

  I'd rather only have a single implementation, typically in
  `FreeAlgebra(K, I)`, with `FreeMonoid(I).algebra(K)`
  pointing to it.

  `FreeAlgebra(K, I)` should by the way be in the category
  Monoids().Algebras(K) which could allow for reusing some generic
  code.

  `TensorAlgebra(V)` could then also point to `FreeAlgebra(K, I)`.
  Possibly with some customization (e.g. printing using tensor symbol).

  By the way, with the name `TensorAlgebra`, the user would probably
  expect to write the product using tensor rather than *. Actually I
  am not yet sure we actually want at this point to have
  `TensorAlgebra` with multiplicative notation.

  Altogether, since `TensorAlgebra` does not bring a feature set
  really different from `FreeAlgebra`, I'd rather leave it name alone
  for now until we have a better view on how we want to handle
  tensor/symmetric/exterior modules.

- It could be preferable to have `TensorModule` be a functorial
  construction, parallel to that for tensor products, and if
  possible sharing as much code as possible with it.

- On a similar footing, the code for `_repr_`, `_latex_`, ... in
  `TensorModule` is duplicated from
  `CombinatorialFreeModule_Tensor`.  Can we avoid that?

- `IndexedFreeAbelianGroup`: do we want to write them additively or
  multiplicatively? In the later case, code could be shared with
  `CombinatorialFreeModule`.

- `TensorModule.algebra`: this definition of .algebra is incompatible
  with the functorial construction with the same name
  (`I.algebra()` builds an algebra whose basis is indexed by
  I). Do we really need this method?

- `is_finite` methods for `Free...Monoid`: this would be
  best achieved by setting the category appropriately.

- `IndexedMonoidElement`: Describe the data structure

- The doctests of `__init__` actually constructs an
  `IndexedFreeAbelianMonoid`. Is this on purpose?

- `_mul_(self, y)` -> `_mul_(self, other)`

- What is the semantic of comparisons (__lt__, ...)? Do we really
  need those comparisons?

- __pow__: Can't we use a generic implementation?

- IndexedMonoid.__contains__ seems generic enough to be lifted
  higher up in the class hierarchy

- _an_element_: rather do the product of the first three elements
  (if available), similar to what's done in
  CombinatorialFreeModule.an_element. This is less demanding on the
  index set (computing the cardinality may be expensive/not
  implemented)

- gens: using `PoorManMap` in `CombinatorialFreeModule.monomial`
  is relevant to make it easy to allow for the short idiom:
  `M.module_morphism(M.monomial*...)`. Do we need it here?

- gens: define instead monoid_generators. gens defers by default to
  monoid_generators in the monoids category (at least with #10963).

- ngens: kill the beast. `self.gens().cardinality()` is a better
  idiom. If we really want a shortcut, it should live in a more
  generic setting.

I've removed `TensorModule` and just made it into `TensorAlgebra` since we always have a natural algebra structure. I've also made some fixes based upon the changes in #15289.

There is one feature that `TensorAlgebra` has different from `FreeAlgebra`, and that is handling coercions from finite tensor products of modules (which all coerce into the base module of `TensorAlgebra`). `TensorAlgebra` also has the Hopf algebra structure defined on it.

However they probably should be some subclassing of `FreeAlgebra` and/or `CombinatorialFreeModule_Tensor`. I haven't made it a functorial construction yet. Also `tensor` should not be the multiplication of two tensor algebra elements, but instead return the element in the tensor product of tensor algebras (this is not isomorphic to the tensor algebra since `(1 # b) * (c # 1) = (c # 1) * (1 # b)` where `b,c` are any elements the tensor algebra). So there is still room for improvement.

I've rebased this and added the construction functor. From doing some reading (on wikipedia), the tensor algebra is a different construction than the free algebra, as this is a functor from modules to algebras, whereas the free algebra is a functor from sets to algebras (well...should be as the `construction()` and the corresponding functor currently isn't implemented).

FTR, I felt that it was better to not put `TensorAlgebraFunctor` as `TensorAlgebra` in the global namespace (instead injecting the class `TensorAlgebra`) because we would have syntax like `TensorAlgebra(M.base_ring())(M)`.

OK, that was quite a few failing doctests, mostly just me being careless. Fixed... with one big exception: almost none of the coercion doctests work! Most strikingly, this here:

```
            sage: C = CombinatorialFreeModule(ZZ, Set([1,2]))

            sage: c = C.monomial(2)

```
blows up! I don't understand coercion well enough to fix this; this probably needs you, Travis.

That said, some of my coercion doctests might be expecting too much.
