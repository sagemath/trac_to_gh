These environment variables are supposed to control the number of times tests are run. 

Regarding `SAGE_TEST_ITER`: the time reported for each file doesn't change regardless of how this is set. The total time reported for all files increases as this does, though. So it's doing something, but the reporting isn't handled very well.

Regarding `SAGE_TEST_GLOBAL_ITER`: between each iteration, the message "Doctests interrupted" is printed, and that's not the appropriate message. 

So fix the use of these and document them, either in the installation manual (along with the other environment variables) or in the developer's guide.

The same goes for `sage -t -global-iterations` and `sage -t -file-iterations`

For example

```
./sage -t --long --global-iterations=5  src/sage/ext/stdsage.pxi
...
...
...
sage -t --long --warn-long 34.8 src/sage/ext/stdsage.pxi
    [1 test, 1.54 s]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Doctests interrupted: 1/1 files tested
Doctests interrupted: 2/1 files tested
Doctests interrupted: 3/1 files tested
Doctests interrupted: 4/1 files tested
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Total time for all tests: 1.6 seconds
    cpu time: 1.9 seconds
    cumulative wall time: 6.5 seconds
sage -t --long --warn-long 34.8 src/sage/ext/stdsage.pxi
    [1 test, 1.56 s]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Doctests interrupted: 1/1 files tested
Doctests interrupted: 2/1 files tested
Doctests interrupted: 3/1 files tested
Doctests interrupted: 4/1 files tested
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Total time for all tests: 1.6 seconds
    cpu time: 2.3 seconds
    cumulative wall time: 8.0 seconds
```

This is totally unintelligible and does not give the feeling that all doctests actually passed.
