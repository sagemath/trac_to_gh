`sage/functions/trig.py` and `sage/functions/spike_function.py` are missing from the documentation. It's particularly important to add the former.

Karl, I added you to CC since you wrote much of the `spike_function` documentation and I thought you might want to see it included in the built docs.

I didn't mean a substantive one, but possibly a trivial one (still needing rebasing), since it touches one of the same files (trig.py) near the place where that ticket changes things.  I haven't actually checked this, probably it's not a problem.

Or, looking at it, I guess #10034 needs to have more files fixed.  See my comment there.
