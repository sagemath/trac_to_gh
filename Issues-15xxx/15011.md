It is not possible to plot `CIF`- and `RIF`-Elements with `list_plot`, e.g.
the command

```
list_plot([CIF(RIF(1/k, 1/k), RIF(-k, k)) for k in [1..10]])
```
gives

```
Traceback (click to the left of this block for traceback)
...
TypeError: unable to coerce to a ComplexNumber: <type
'sage.rings.complex_interval.ComplexIntervalFieldElement'>
```
Similarly,

```
list_plot([(k, RIF(-k, k)) for k in [1..10]])
```
should be possible.

It seems, that #8535 implemented a {{{plot}}-routine, e.g.

```
sum(plot(CIF(RIF(1/k, 1/k), RIF(-k, k))) for k in [1..10])
```
works, so making `list_plot` work should not be too difficult.
