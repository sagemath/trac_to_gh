Well, I see a `ProjectivePlane` method as one that will give me "some projective plane", and I can't make more assumptions on what it is. I would also like someone who just wants "a projective plane" to be able to find the method, for I need projective planes and I have no idea what a Desarguesian projective plane is, nor if the one I implemented is classical.

Plus I implemented a `steiner_triple_system` method which returns only one kind of steiner triple systems, I did the same for `steiner_quadruple_systems`, ... `:-P`

What would you think of this : we keep `ProjectivePlaneDesign` as the method name for the moment, and if we end up with more data we will just make it accessible visible in the doc ? 

Combinat-style, this thing should be a new `ProjectivePlanes` class with an `an_element` method to return some projective plane, and none other. But we can't even write a `.cardinality()` method, nor enumerate them... `:-P`

And if you insist I will rename this to `ClassicalProjectivePlaneDesign`.

Have fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuun ! `;-)`

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desargues%27_theorem is a geometric criterion satisfied by projective planes obtained from the 3-dimensional vector spaces over division rings; every finite division ring is a field, so in the finite case every such plane is Pappian, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pappus%27s_hexagon_theorem. 

Keeping the current name sucks, as adding more examples would force you to rename stuff.
So, please, call it, as you prefer: Classical, or Pappian, or Desarguesian...

As far as `ProjectivePlanes` class would go, you can do `cardinality()` up to n=10...

Sorry Nathann, but what is exactly the purpose of the newfunction `DesarguesianProjectivePlaneDesign` ?

In my opinion, with this name, it does no longer make sense to answer 'No projective plane design of order 10 exists' or 'If such a projective plane exists, we do not know how to build it.' One should rather check if the input is a prime power and that's it.

Then it would be just a restriction of ProjectiveGeometryDesign to the dimension 2, i.e. some kind of alias. Either this is considered not useful, and this ticket can be forgotten, or you want to keep it as an useful alias, and it will be ok.

Helloooooo !

Well, the purpose of this function is to return a projective plane design, i.e. a `d^2+d+1, d+1` BIBD.

I agree with what you said. Actually, thinking about it again, I don't agree with what Dima said above. I don't see the problem with calling this `ProjectivePlaneDesign`, as I need a function which returns a projective plane design. Changing the name just makes it harder to find when one looks for it `>_<`

What do you think ?

I think that this alias is useful, but I personally spent quite some time trying to figure out of to obtain a projective plane design with Sage.

I just updated this ticket after the englightening discussion held on sage-devel :

We now have an additional argument to ProjectivePlaneDesign which does nothing. That's for the sake of art.

There is a typo "afinite projective plane"

I propose to replace "No other value is available for this parameter." by

"For the moment, no other value is available for this parameter."

I think this looks fine and is ready to go in.

Just for fun, I did the following additional consistency check:

```
sage: S = designs.ProjectiveGeometryDesign(2,1,GF(3))
sage: M = Matroid(circuit_closures={2:S.blocks(),3:[range(13)]})
sage: M.is_isomorphic(matroids.PG(2,3))
True
