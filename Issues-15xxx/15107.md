the function name is unfortunate; it should reflect the fact that there could be several examples, or, rather, make it unique, like `ClassicalProjectivePlane` or `DesarguesianProjectivePlane` or something like this. Otherwise it would preclude adding code for non-classical examples.

So, please, call it, as you prefer: Classical, or Pappian, or Desarguesian...

As far as `ProjectivePlanes` class would go, you can do `cardinality()` up to n=10...

In my opinion, with this name, it does no longer make sense to answer 'No projective plane design of order 10 exists' or 'If such a projective plane exists, we do not know how to build it.' One should rather check if the input is a prime power and that's it.

<a id='comment:14'></a>Helloooooo !

Well, the purpose of this function is to return a projective plane design, i.e. a `d^2+d+1, d+1` BIBD.

I agree with what you said. Actually, thinking about it again, I don't agree with what Dima said above. I don't see the problem with calling this `ProjectivePlaneDesign`, as I need a function which returns a projective plane design. Changing the name just makes it harder to find when one looks for it `>_<`

What do you think ?

I think that this alias is useful, but I personally spent quite some time trying to figure out of to obtain a projective plane design with Sage.
