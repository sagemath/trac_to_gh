ADD DESCRIPTION
Giving a list of the generators of the group in some algebra, the fox derivative can be computed in that
algebra:

```
sage: F=FreeGroup(3)
sage: a=F([2,1,3,-1,2])
sage: a.fox_derivative(F([1]))
B[x1] - B[x1*x0*x2*x0^-1]
sage: R.<t>=LaurentPolynomialRing(ZZ)
sage: a.fox_derivative(F([1]),[t,t,t])
-t^2 + t
sage: S.<t1,t2,t3>=LaurentPolynomialRing(ZZ)
sage: a.fox_derivative(F([1]),[t1,t2,t3])
-t2*t3 + t2
```
