The fix is easy : check if the graph is labelled right, and if not call the function on a relabelled version.

Aaaaaaand I wonder what you think other Sage bugs are if you believe that this is a "major" problem `:-P`

I don't mean that it shouldn't be fixed, of course. I am just saying that I can easily name a couple of things much more important to be fixed than this `:-P`

Replying to [@nathanncohen](#comment%3A4):
> The fix is easy : check if the graph is labelled right, and if not call the function on a relabelled version.

Bummer, that code works fine when run from the Sage command line:

```
    L = []
    for v, d in G.degree_iterator(labels=True):
        L.append((d, v))       <---------  error message
    L.sort()
    d = {}
    for i from 0 <= i < nverts:
        d[L[i][1]] = i
    G = G.relabel(d, inplace=False)
```
So, is this a Cython problem?
