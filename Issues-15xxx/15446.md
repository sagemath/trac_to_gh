Keywords: gp stack overflow

From Georgi Guninski on sage-support (https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-support/A_GilhiUAwM):

```
sage: gp("{T(n)=n+1}")
sage: for n in [ 1 .. 2**20]:
    a=gp.T(n)
    print n

#wait some time..

after this trying:

```
sage: gp.T(1)

again raises exception.

After the above computation, the log file `.sage/gp-expect.log` ends with

It appears that the vector `sage` wasn't doubled correctly; probably it got messed up by the failed `concat()`.

This could be related to #11017/#11018.

The problem appears to be fixed by introducing a temporary variable to hold the result of `concat()` instead of directly assigning it to `sage`.
