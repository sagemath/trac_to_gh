The changes for the new octal literal format should be complete: 2 modules were fixed by the 2to3 tool and another case was manually fixed in a doc-test.

2to3 has found nothing for the long integer literal (suffix "L").

13 modules were found with regexp search (r"\s (0\d+) [\s)]"). The result file is attached.
* 6 pyx modules from `sage/rings/padics` contain code like `(1L << (sizeof(long) * 8 - 2)) - 1`. I do not whether these should be changed.
* 4 modules had doc-test with stuff like `4561L   # 32-bit`. Perhaps these test can be made more tolerant.
* The module `sage/interfaces/r.py` had strings like
  "rel_re_integer.sub(a._subs_integer, ' 1L 2L')". Maybe this could / should be changed.
* 2 modules in `sage/combinat` had the text "ValueError: R10L is not a correct map". Nothing to change.

I think `...` is too liberal, e.g. the follow function would pass this doctest:

```python
def foo():
    print("4561"+"lots of other text"*1000)
```

The first search was incomplete. A lot more `\d+L` instances found (see new attachment).

I guess "fix_long" ticket:16072 (stage 2) should be solved first. That will clarify the approach to be selected here.

Move to stage 2?
