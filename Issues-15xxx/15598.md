Two concerns Nicolas Thiery brought up in #15428 that I think should best be procras<sup>H</sup>H<sup>H</sup>H<sup>H</sup>H<sup>H</sup>deferred until `tableau.py` is refactored:

- To every partition corresponds a tableau where each cell `(i, j)` is filled with the *pair* `(i, j)`. This should be a method on partitions. Might do the same for compositions if we make a tableau class that allows the shape to be a composition.

- The `cell_poset` method on partitions should also be implemented on tableaux.

Depends on #15428
