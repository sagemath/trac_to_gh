A straightforward replacement of the src dir (and cleaning up with spkg-src) seems enough.
Note that:
* #14460 (http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=56982) is not fixed
* it fails on Cygwin because libbacktrace passes -Werror which errors out as -fPIC is also passed but results in a warning (and so an error with -Werror) on Cygwin We need to configure it with --disable-werror, see http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=56057 .

New spkg at http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jpflori/spkg/gcc-4.8.2.spkg

It seems this is currently an experimental spkg, maybe it could be moved to optional?

Do you have a spkg url? ;-) Does it work on the git directory layout?

No url yet, just a dirty spkg.

What's the requirement for the git layout?
That everything not in the "upstream" tarball (which can be stripped, include additional files) is tracked?

It did not seem to me that the spkg needed special treatment for the git layout though I have no access to a git install these days so I might be wrong.

Use spkg at http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jpflori/spkg/gcc-4.8.2.spkg

Tested on Cygwin and Ubuntu.

The only reason it's experimental is because it hasn't been tested on many systems and because the requirement of having a C++ compiler is an extra step compared to GCC-4.7.x.

Passing --disable-werrror shouldn't hurt, but a priori it is only needed on Cygwin.
So it could only let relevant (and unexpected) warnings pass unnoticed on other systems.
I don't have a strong opinion about that though.

spkg update with correct version number.

I have had bad experiences with `-Werror` in the past, where a perfectly fine program refused to compile because of a harmless warning. I believe that `-Werror` should never be used by default. It is useful for maintainers of a package to check their compilation, but only for this.
