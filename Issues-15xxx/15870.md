We have

```
sage: abc = var('abc')
sage: latex((abc/(abc+1)+42)/(abc-1))
\frac{\frac{\mbox{abc}}{\mbox{abc} + 1} + 42}{\mbox{abc} - 1}
```
The \mbox here is wrong because of the following two reasons:
- In the example above `\mbox{abc}` has normal size, whereas the `+1` is typeset in subscriptsize (or so). You can see this by `view((abc/(abc+1)+42)/(abc-1))`.
- Variables are written in italic.

Therefore `\mbox` should be replaced by `\mathit` (which solves both problems mentioned above).

See also #13543 (Multi-character variables not supported in legend_labels).

I've changed the source so that multi-character variables are printed correctly. 

The LaTeX-output of infinite polynomial ring variables was also adapted to support multi-character variables correctly. Thereby, this output is now generated using the standard tools of `latex.py`.
