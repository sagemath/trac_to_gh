See this [sage-devel thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/0IalWN4NHig).
This problem arises (at least on a lot of machines)

```
import numpy as np
sage: isinstance(np.float64(1),float)
True
sage: isinstance(np.float32(1),float)
False
sage: isinstance(np.float128(1),float)
False
sage: isinstance(np.float(1),float)
True
sage: type(np.float(1))
<type 'float'>
sage: parent(np.float64(1))
<type 'numpy.float64'>
```
As you can see, numpy decides to map `numpy.float64` a subclass of `float`. Sage's coercion code wasn't prepared for subclassing. This leads to awkward coercion problems:

```
sage: 1j + np.float64(2)
2.0
```
(the result is of type np.float64 rather than CC, i.e., the wrong parent is chosen).
The simplest choice seems to be to ensure that sage tests for subtypes in the relevant spot.

Component: **coercion**

Hello,

I propose to close this as duplicates because of #18076. With the branch applied

```
sage: import numpy
sage: 1j + numpy.float64(2)
2.00000000000000 + 1.00000000000000*I
sage: parent(_)
Complex Field with 53 bits of precision
```
But #8824 is still an issue

```
sage: numpy.float64(2) + 1j
(2+1j)
sage: parent(_)
<type 'numpy.complex128'>
```

Since as I copied some of the suggestions from the branch, I propose to set you as an author in #18076.

Vincent
