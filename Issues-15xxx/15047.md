Currently calling

```
latex(SR.wild(0))
```
results in '$0'. When using this with SageTeX, it causes issues due to special meaning of $ in TeX. I believe this call should return '\$0' instead. For now when using SageTeX I have to use something like

```
LatexExpr(latex(SR.wild(0)).replace(r'$',r'\$'))
```

Depends on #18237

Upstream: **Fixed upstream, in a later stable release.**

Component: **symbolics**

Keywords: **pynac wildcard latex**
