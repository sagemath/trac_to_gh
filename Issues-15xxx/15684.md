In order to simplify the build system, let's remove support for `SAGE_FORTRAN` and `SAGE_FORTRAN_LIB`. These environment variables have been deprecated since Sage 5.3 (more than a year).

To remove all traces of `SAGE_FORTRAN` from the Sage sources, also #9870 and #15685 should be fixed.

Looks ok.

Maybe a little too much removal in the rubiks install script but that's also for obscure stuff, so I don't mind.
