Hello,

It is very good that the code is documented and contains references! But there are several problem with the documentation (see [sage developer guide](http://sagemath.github.io/git-developer-guide/coding_basics.html#documentation-strings)).

1) there are trailing whitespaces

2) the indentation is not good. The blocks INPUT, EXAMPLES must have the same identation as the documentation and you must have a blankline between the block name EXAMPLES and its content (for example lines 201-202 are wrong).

```
def my_function(arg1, arg2):
    """
    This is a nice function

    INPUT:

    - ``arg1`` - a first nice argument

    - ``arg2`` - an other nice argument

    EXAMPLES::

        sage: my_function(8,3)
 
    We can also use the function with strings::

        sage: my_function('toto', 'bibi')
    """
```

3) Bibliography is not set up properly

4) In the examples (at least) respect the convention "my_variable = f()" and do not use "my_variable=f()". If possible, try to be coherent in function arguments and prefer "def f(a, b=3, c=4)" to "def f(a,b = 3, c=4)".

5) For the name I guess "is_affine_minimal" is more suited than "affine_minimal".

Yes, 1,2,4 are all simple changes that need to be made.  3 was waiting to add an additional citation (which I have now) and will be fixed as well.

5 I disagree with. The minimalmodel.py file is not exposed to the user, so neither is affine_minimal. The two functions exposed to the user are

is_minimal_model() and minimal_model()

Part of the original citation is that it is enough for minimal to check affine minimal, so those names should be fine.

Just two minor comments. In line 206, I think you mean ``vp`` to ``newvp``, and in line 1453 ``self`` is written ``sefl``.

I'm noticing it's awfully slow! I think I tried a similar thing with the magma version and that was quite quick. Initial impression is that this is just a sage problem:

so it looks like just constructing the polynomials is an expensive proposition already. `bCheck` does take quite a bit of time by itself too, so there may be some algorithmic issues too. Perhaps we don't care about performance at this point?

(Ah, I see: there are lots of polynomial rings constructed *inside* functions. That shouldn't happen)

Some possible packaging problems:
- I think the file name `sage/schemes/projective/minimal_model.py` will cause problems later on: there are all kinds of projective schemes that have their own concept of minimality, so I think it should be `endP1_minimal_model` or something more appetizing.
- `phi.is_minimal_model` reads a little strange: `phi` is supposed to be an endomorphism on a `P1` (with coordinate choice, i.e., with `0,1,infty` marked), not a model of one. Would is_PGL_minimal be better (or perhaps is_minimal)?

{
    "body": "<div id=\"comment:8\" align=\"right\">comment:8</div>\n\nI've attached a \"patch\" with some suggested improvements. With that version, I was able to check the minimality of `[eval(c) for c in urllib.urlopen(\"http://www.cecm.sfu.ca/~nbruin/intorbits/deg2.txt\")]` within a minute (that's a little over 2000 quadratic maps). I'm sure the code could be optimized further, but why bother now? I don't think the current code is doing anything outright silly any more and running `%prun` on some examples produces for me a profile I can believe (most time is spent in the recursive `blift`, which is what one would expect).\n\nThere's still the naming of the file and of the routines to be considered.\n\nThe code itself seems fine. I've run it by giving it (known) minimal maps from the tables referred to above, conjugating by random transformations, and seeing if the minimal model returned has the same resultant (up to sign) as the original, and I didn't find problems.\n\n(I noticed there's a doctest failing for `blift` now, but that's because the test puts an integer in the input list where there should be polynomials. I propose the doctest gets amended, since the internal use of `blift` guarantees that the input consists of a list of polynomials.)",

<div id="comment:8" align="right">comment:8</div>

I've attached a "patch" with some suggested improvements. With that version, I was able to check the minimality of `[eval(c) for c in urllib.urlopen("http://www.cecm.sfu.ca/~nbruin/intorbits/deg2.txt")]` within a minute (that's a little over 2000 quadratic maps). I'm sure the code could be optimized further, but why bother now? I don't think the current code is doing anything outright silly any more and running `%prun` on some examples produces for me a profile I can believe (most time is spent in the recursive `blift`, which is what one would expect).

There's still the naming of the file and of the routines to be considered.

The code itself seems fine. I've run it by giving it (known) minimal maps from the tables referred to above, conjugating by random transformations, and seeing if the minimal model returned has the same resultant (up to sign) as the original, and I didn't find problems.

(I noticed there's a doctest failing for `blift` now, but that's because the test puts an integer in the input list where there should be polynomials. I propose the doctest gets amended, since the internal use of `blift` guarantees that the input consists of a list of polynomials.)

Yes. we should just update the doctest as well as we made our best guess as to what a reasonable test was for the individual functions.

I can fold the patches together and make these changes unless you want to use your `referee` patch to do them?

Looks good to me. Incidentally, the name `is_PGL_minimal` might not be the best name. It's certainly descriptive, but the spelling is perhaps a little painful relative to the rest of sage?

Some very small points:

The fact that

```
sage: phi.minimal_model().resultant()
```
doesn't work seems a little strange. Shouldn't it be `return_conjugation=False` by default, so that the default returns a value that can be immediately used rather than needing unpacking? Also, wouldn't `return_transformation` be a better name? 

Certainly in the doctest:

```
     sage: f.minimal_model(False)
```
should refer to the keyword argument by keyword, i.e.,

```
     sage: f.minimal_model(return_transformation=False)
```
A "positional" false is rather unclear here, even though it works.

Finally (and this is for another ticket): If we're "minimizing" rational transformations, shouldn't we also be "reducing" them, i.e., compute an SL(2,Z) transformation that makes the coefficients small? The most simple approach would be to "reduce" the binary form describing the fixed points or (if that's too degenerate) the points of period n for some small n.

See [Stoll, Michael; Cremona, John E., On the reduction theory of binary forms. J. Reine Angew. Math. 565 (2003), 79–99.], which is fairly easy to implement and which would be useful to have in sage anyway.

hmm...Since I using the same references in two different functions it is giving the warning. I'm not 100% sure what the procedure is here. In looking at some of the toric variety code, it seems to be the case to put the reference listing in one place and then use `[.]` everywhere else.

So then I've moved the `REFERENCES` block to the 'main' function and just used the citation `[.]` for the other.
