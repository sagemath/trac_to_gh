Remove the following coercions because they make interval arithmetic much less trustworthy.
* `RealField` --> `RealIntervalField`
* `float` --> `ComplexIntervalField`
* `SR` --> `ComplexIntervalField`

For example, one could easily do the following by accident.

```
    sage: iv = 1 + 2^(-55) + 0. + RIF(1)
    sage: iv.lower(), iv.upper()
    (2.00000000000000, 2.00000000000000)
```

I think this change will cause many more problems than it solves.

In practice: I expect this will break a lot of existing code. I often use the RR --> RIF coercion intentionally, because it makes it more convenient to do exactly what I want. For instance:

* In an interval branch-and-bound code, cell widths in a geometric decomposition are expressed as reciprocal powers of two, which can be efficiently stored and used as EXACT floating-point numbers. Combining these in arithmetic operations with intervals gives the same results as explicitly converting them to RIF, without having to do the explicit conversion.

* Interval arithmetic is a fast way to obtain approximate bounds on floating-point calculations over ranges of parameters, by simply replacing the parameter of interest with an interval. To do this without RR --> RIF, one would have to add explicit conversions of *all* other parameters appearing in combination with this parameter *everywhere* it occurs.

In theory: I think the motivation is flawed. The change was proposed to avoid accidental coercion of exact ring values to RIF via potentially inexact RR. But the problem in this case is the first step, not the second, and reflects the need for a direct coercion from the exact ring to RIF. In such a case, the lack of such a coercion is the bug. Whereas each value in RR *does* have a valid coercion to RIF, and the lack of this coercion would also be a bug.

Realistically, I think anyone who is actually 

1. using RIF to do reliable computing *and* 
2. coercing values from other exact rings that *don't* have direct coercions to RIF *and* are not expressible exactly in RR,

is going to be sufficiently aware of the potential problem that they will handle/check the conversion explicitly. Better to expect this than to inconvenience many users who use this coercion in far less arcane circumstances.

I honestly don't really see a problem with coercion `RR` -> `RIF`.\n\nWith `RIF` you always have guaranteed results, with `RR` you do not. `RIF` should be as safe as possible to ensure that you actually have proven results. Just compare\n\n```\nsage: r1 = RIF(1/3) + (2.0).cos()\nsage: r2 = RIF(1/3) + RIF(2).cos()\nsage: r1.endpoints()\n(-0.0828135032138091, -0.0828135032138090)\nsage: r2.endpoints()\n(-0.0828135032138091, -0.0828135032138089)\n```\n\nFor me it is similar to the way coercions are implemented between `RealField`. It goes from more precision to less precision so that you have no artificial big precision in your result.\n\nIn conclusion: if any coercion, it should be the other way around (by taking the center).",

With `RIF` you always have guaranteed results, with `RR` you do not. `RIF` should be as safe as possible to ensure that you actually have proven results. Just compare

```
sage: r1 = RIF(1/3) + (2.0).cos()
sage: r2 = RIF(1/3) + RIF(2).cos()
sage: r1.endpoints()
(-0.0828135032138091, -0.0828135032138090)
sage: r2.endpoints()
(-0.0828135032138091, -0.0828135032138089)
```

For me it is similar to the way coercions are implemented between `RealField`. It goes from more precision to less precision so that you have no artificial big precision in your result.

In conclusion: if any coercion, it should be the other way around (by taking the center).

I think a lot depends on how you model mathematically elements of interval fields. There are two ways to interpret them: either as real numbers with some uncertainty or actually as intervals of real numbers.

In the "interval" model, the coercion RR -> RIF makes sense: you identify a real number with a singleton, which is a special case of an interval. On the other hand, the "choose the middle point map" RIF -> RR is neither natural (the middle point is an arbitrary choice) nor a morphism, which are two requirements for a coercion.

In the "real number with uncertainty" model, you could see RIF -> RR as the forgetful map which keeps the real number but forgets about the uncertainty. In that case, this map is more natural than the opposite.

For me, it is pretty clear that MPFI is really meant to model intervals while arb models real numbers with uncertainty.

I sort of agree, but still, the key property is that operations on MPFI intervals return over-approximations of the set of possible results (in particular, they round the endpoints of the results in the correct direction), and having a coercion from plain floating-point numbers would effectively break that.

What would make sense to me if you want ”intervals of real numbers” with a coercion from the corresponding real numbers themselves would be a separate parent `Intervals(R)` explicitly parametrized by the parent `R` = `RR`, `QQ`, `SR`... where the endpoints live.

`RealIntervalField` is exactly that for `RR`

So, is this an argument in favor of the coercion `RR` -> `RIF`?

Yes, obviously because that's the right thing to do.

Technically not, but that is just an implementation detail. `RIF` is the set of intervals over `RR`. Whether it's implemented by operations in `RR` or by a separate library (MPFI in this case) doesn't really matter.

It is not to me. I found [various](https://members.loria.fr/PZimmermann/IEEE1788-MPFI.pdf)  [texts](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.78.9885&rep=rep1&type=pdf) (by MPFI developers) that motivate why MPFI exists and they all start by saying things about "guaranteeing results" and "certified enclosures" for floating point real arithmetic. And if an automatic silent coercion mixes a guaranteed result with a non-guaranteed result, this is bad.

People prove theorems using `RealIntervalField` as "real numbers that are guaranteed to be in a certain interval", and I would personally trust such theorems much less if they use software that allows automatic accidental coercions from RR to RIF. The reason: a mistake or bug could introduce a (non-guaranteed-correct) element of RR and the coercion will silently add it to your RIF element, which now could have an incorrect error bound.

I did not know that people also use the outward-rounding RIF for "arithmetic with intervals" without caring about guaranteed inclusion. I understand that for them it is convenient that the following works:

```
sage: I = RIF(pi, 2*pi)
sage: p = RR(pi)
sage: I + p
1.?e1
```
to get the interval [5, 8]. However, it is hardly any extra work to do the direct thing that the coercion model currently does for you, which is:

```
sage: I + RIF(p)
1.?e1
```
And we can also implement additional functions, e.g.

```
sage: I.translate(p)
sage: I.add(p)
```

So I am very much in favour of removing automatic coercions between RR and RIF. Perhaps with a `DeprecationWarning` if possible.

> If it is considered a bug, then no deprecation is needed...

It's documented behaviour so it's maybe a [misfeature](http://catb.org/jargon/html/M/misfeature.html) but not a bug.

Anyway, it seems that most people think that the coercion `RR` -> `RIF` is a misfeature, so I'm willing to remove it in #24371. However, I don't want to deal with the fall-out so if somebody wants to fix [comment:24], please go ahead. It's hard to tell if that's the only issue because that one issue in `QQbar` causes so many doctest failures.

The link is not immediate. What happens is that

* with the coercion removed but without #22029, they would silently return nonsense (compare by id),

I could not test everything locally due to version issues with pari and giac, so the patchbot may still uncover problems, but this is starting to take shape, and comments are already welcome.

@bhutz: You may want to check the commit touching `binary_form_reduce`. I don't think I broke anything, but the way intervals are used in the parts I had to modify looks a bit strange to me.

@JohnCremona, @pjbruin: Same remark regarding the changes to `elliptic_curves.height`.

The only trouble I see is that it might break user code without deprecation notice.

The switch to Python 3 (and, I think, also the change to make `i` an element of ℚ[i] that you recently reviewed) went a long way toward solving the worst issues I found the first time I tried. But it is good news in any case!

> The only trouble I see is that it might break user code without deprecation notice.

I agree. But I don't know what to to to ease the transition. Do you see a way to display a deprecation warning when a coercion map is used while keeping the corresponding conversion map working?

That being said, between the issues it indirectly causes and the inconsistency with other interval fields, I would almost call the existence of this coercion a bug.

One possibility would be to support the operations (with a warning) without having the coercions. One cumbersome way to do this is to implement custom `__add__`, `__mul__`, etc

```
class Interval:
    def __add__(self, other):
        if self is an interval and other a floating point:
            warn("don't do that")
            return old_behavior(self, other)
        else:
            return Element.__add__(self, other)
```
But I don't see a simple way to do it in order to also handle functorial constructions such as vectors or polynomials. Though, given the changes you had to do in the doctests, I think it makes sense to only consider scalars.
 
> That being said, between the issues it indirectly causes and the inconsistency with other interval fields, I would almost call the existence of this coercion a bug.

Agreed, but https://xkcd.com/1172/

Unless we do it for floating-point types too (which would be a bit invasive), it will work for `interval + float` but `float + interval` will still fail.
