Okay, the patch is now ready for first review. It has full doctest coverage and all tests pass for me. I've removed some of the coercions in the old version since I was worried about possibly breaking coercion commutative diagrams.

Some of the things I'm not perfectly happy about (but can live with currently):

- A descriptive name of the **q**, **x**, and **w** bases.
- No antipode for the **w** basis.
- Creating the `SymmetricFunctions` base object when creating `SymmetricFunctionNonCommutingVariables` in order to set up the coercion.
- Is it safe to put the natural maps `Sym -> NCSym` and `NSym -> NCSym` as coercions?

The references I used are included in the documentation now too.

Hi Travis, One initial comment about the `NSym -> NCSym` map.  It is dangerous to call it "the natural" map from `NSym` to `NCSym`.  It is one of many.  There does not seem to be a reason to favor the map which sends the complete generators to the complete generators.  If you were to send the elementary generators to the elementary generators you get a map which is equally compelling and (unfortunately) they are not the same map.

I would have thought that the total ordering on set partitions in #15143 would have `CombinatorialFreeModule` give a unique sorting on the elements:

```
sage: SetPartition([[1,3],[2]]) < SetPartition([[1],[2],[3]])
False
sage: SetPartition([[1,3],[2]]) > SetPartition([[1],[2],[3]])
True
sage: SetPartition([[1],[2],[3]]) < SetPartition([[1,3],[2]])
True
sage: SetPartition([[1],[2],[3]]) > SetPartition([[1,3],[2]])
False
```

My guess as to why we're getting different output is a failure in the comparisons (I didn't see any tickets that seemed like would change the output of `linear_comb()`). Try running:

```
sage: e = SymmetricFunctionsNonCommutingVariables(QQ).e()
sage: e.print_options()
{'bracket': False,
 'latex_bracket': False,
 'latex_prefix': None,
 'latex_scalar_mult': None,
 'monomial_cmp': <function cmp>,
 'prefix': 'e',
 'scalar_mult': '*',
 'tensor_symbol': None}
sage: cmp(SetPartition([[1],[2],[3]]), SetPartition([[1,3],[2]]))
-1
sage: elt = 2*e[[1],[2],[3]] - e[[1,3],[2]]
sage: L = elt._monomial_coefficients.items()
sage: L.sort(cmp=cmp, key=lambda (x,y): x)
sage: L
[({{1, 3}, {2}}, -1), ({{1}, {2}, {3}}, 2)]
```
Do you get anything different, in particular the last one?

This is why:

```
sage: A = SetPartition([[1],[2],[3]])
sage: B = SetPartition([[1,3],[2]])
sage: cmp(A, B)
-1
sage: cmp(B, A)
-1
```
The `cmp` is not correctly using the rich comparisons because `ClonableArray` has (in effect) a `__cmp__` function which calls the underlying list (which contains `Set` objects which don't compare as intended)...

I'm fixing this right now.

```

I added a `__cmp__()` method to `SetPartition` to override the behavior of `ClonableArray`.

OK. Thanks for fixing that.  I'm looking over the patch and I have some initial changes where the multiplication uses the pipe function and the product is implemented in the `q` basis.

The change of basis from `q` to `x` or vice versa is slow and so ideally I would like to improve this.

I think that line 180 from `ncsym.py` is wrong.  There should be no morphism from NCSym to Sym, but there is a projection.  There is however a morphism from DNCSym to Sym.

DNCSym is similar to quasi-symmetric functions so that if you add the right elements together (say some linear combination of the `w` basis) then you have an element of Sym.

Some random comments on ncsym.py.

```
    The ring of symmetric functions in non-commutative variables,
    which is not to be confused with the :class:`non-commutative symmetric
    functions<NonCommutativeSymmetricFunctions>`, are polynomials in `n`
    non-commuting variables `{\bf k}[x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n]` where the
    dimension of the subspace of elements of degree `k` is equal to
    the number of compositions of `k` (with less than `n` parts).
```
If the variables are non-commuting, use angular rather than square brackets. Also, I assume you want infinitely many variables? And do you really want compositions?

Typo:

```
Grothendeick
```

Old-style arXiv references like this:

```
:arxiv:`0208168`
```
should have a "math/" in front of them, I believe (also, I'd add a version number, in this case math/0208168v2).

What is the \wedge operation on set partitions? It is used but not defined. If it's the one from the Bergeron-Zabrocki paper, it is simply the meet of set partitions (aka `__mul__`) and should be explained as such.

On the right hand side of

```
                S(\mathbf{p}_A) = \sum_{\gamma} (-1)^{\ell(\gamma)} \gamma[A]
```
don't you mean to say ` p_{\gamma[A]} ` rather than ` \gamma[A] ` ? And on the next line, do you mean to say `of `[\ell(A)]`` instead of `of length `\ell(A)``?

Similarly here:

```
                p(A) = \sum_{\gamma} (-1)^{\ell(\gamma)-1} \gamma[A]
```

I assume that "strictly coarser" in

```
        where we sum over all strictly coarser set partitions `B`.
```
refers to the relation of strict coarsening as defined in `set_partition.py`. If so, please say this explicitly, as the notation is slightly counterintuitive (one normally thinks "strictly coarser" means "coarser and not equal").

I'll eventually have a closer look at the patch if only to understand how exactly internal-coproduct-by-coercion works (for use in NSym); I cannot promise that I will ever give this an actual review. Nevertheless, great work here, Travis.

Here's the new version of the patch which (hopefully) takes care of all of Darij's comments. How the `internal_coproduct*` works is a trick with `lazy_attribute` which `*_by_coercion()` creates the correct morphism object if `*_on_basis()` is not implemented and so it behaves like a method.

I've removed the coercion from `NCSym` to `Sym` since it is not a Hopf morphism, which is a requirement for it to be a coercion. I've fixed the input to accept `x([[1,3],[2]])` as well.

Currently to get from `x` to `q` (or vice versa) there's a few coercions going on, and I don't know of a way to go between them directly. (Data suggests that `x(q[A])` is a sum over some subset of set partitions with all coefficients occurring (-1)<sup>nest(A)</sup>.)

For `DNCSym`, is there a way to express an element in the **w** basis as a polynomial? Currently I have a map from `Sym` to `DNCSym` which is at least (appears to me to be) an algebra morphism (see the `sum_of_partitions()` method). Is this a Hopf morphism and is the map from `DNCSym` to `Sym` the inverse of this map?

Thank you all for looking at this patch,

Travis

So about your question if `DNCSym` can be realized in the polynomial algebra.  The answer is 'probably' but no one has ever done this.  Maybe you can make a guess at the realization by what I will write.  I will guess that the dual to the complete basis is some sort of monomial basis (the `w` basis is the dual to the `m` basis).

The morphism from `DNCSym` into `Sym` is 'the coefficient of `w_A` in `h_\lambda` is equal to the coefficient of `m_\lambda` in `chi(m_A)`.'  Therefore,

```
\sum_{A} A^{!} w_A = h_\lambda
```
where the sum is over `A` with set partitions with part lengths a partition `\lambda` and the `A^{!}` notation is from Rosas / Sagan p. 4.

Okay, this is describing the image of the map I currently have implemented:

```
sage: h = SymmetricFunctions(QQ).h()
sage: w = SymmetricFunctionsNonCommutingVariables(QQ).dual().w()
sage: w(h[2,1,1])
2*w{{1}, {2}, {3, 4}} + 2*w{{1}, {2, 3}, {4}} + 2*w{{1}, {2, 4}, {3}}
 + 2*w{{1, 2}, {3}, {4}} + 2*w{{1, 3}, {2}, {4}} + 2*w{{1, 4}, {2}, {3}}
```
This map is respecting the multiplication

```
sage: w[[1,2]] * w[[1]] * w[[1]]
2*w{{1}, {2}, {3, 4}} + 2*w{{1}, {2, 3}, {4}} + 2*w{{1}, {2, 4}, {3}}
 + 2*w{{1, 2}, {3}, {4}} + 2*w{{1, 3}, {2}, {4}} + 2*w{{1, 4}, {2}, {3}}
```
so we can at least get `w[This is the Trac macro *1,2,...,n* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#1,2,...,n-macro) = h[n]` as the correct expansion. However this does not seem straightforward to me in general as we have

```
sage: h[2,1,1].expand(2)
x0^4 + 3*x0^3*x1 + 4*x0^2*x1^2 + 3*x0*x1^3 + x1^4
```
If it does work, it probably uses crossings and/or nestings, but I don't see it.

Anyways, do you think I should add a method `is_symmetric_function()` and/or `to_symmetric_function()` for the dual bases?

Also I found a bug with the expansion, in that `SetPartition` was not always living in the correct parent when taking `inf` or `sup`. I also added `to_symmetric_function` for the **e**, **h**, and **p** `NCSym` basis to return the correct object in the e, h, and p `Sym` basis resp.

"Also I found a bug with the expansion, in that SetPartition was not always living in the correct parent when taking inf or sup."

How that?

```
sage: P = SetPartition([[3,1],[2]])
sage: parent(P)
Set partitions
sage: Q = SetPartition([[1,2],[3]])
sage: Q.inf(P)
{{1}, {2}, {3}}
sage: parent(Q.inf(P))
Set partitions
sage: parent(Q.sup(P))
Set partitions
sage: P = SetPartitions(3)(P)
sage: P
{{1, 3}, {2}}
sage: parent(P)
Set partitions of {1, 2, 3}
sage: Q = SetPartitions(3)(Q)
sage: parent(Q)
Set partitions of {1, 2, 3}
sage: P.inf(Q)
{{1}, {2}, {3}}
sage: parent(P.inf(Q))
Set partitions of {1, 2, 3}
sage: parent(P.sup(Q))
Set partitions of {1, 2, 3}
```

This thing actually happens not only with set partitions. Any idea on how to avoid it on a bigger scale?

```
sage: P = Permutations(recoils=[2,3])
sage: u = P[1]
sage: u.complement()
[5, 3, 2, 4, 1]
sage: parent(u.complement())
Standard permutations whose recoils composition is [2, 3]
```

The only reason why this doesn't blow up is that the class of permutations whose recoils composition is a given composition is liberal to invalid input.

Similarly:

```
sage: P = Permutations(5, avoiding=[1,2,3])
sage: parent(P[25].complement())
Standard permutations of 5 avoiding [1, 2, 3]
sage: P[25].complement()
[3, 1, 4, 2, 5]
```

Hi Travis,
So far I am focusing in on pieces of functionality.  It doesn't quite seem to work as I expect.  The doc string `w.sum_of_partitions?` does not seem to agree with what it does since it is actually a sum with coefficients.

I was trying to figure out how to coerce `f=w[[1,2],[3]]+w[[1,3],[2]]+w[[2,3],[1]]` to the h-basis and I don't see a doc-string and what I tried doesn't seem to work anyway.  `DNCSym.to_symmetric_function?` gives an error and when I try either `h(f)` or `DNCSym.to_symmetric_function(f)`, both give the same error:

```

Overall the functionality looks good.  You covered a lot of ground for a first implementation.  I don't think I will suggest other functionality, but I will check the ones you have.

What I can see of the map from  Sym -> NCSym* seems to work well.

How come you import `SymmetricFunctionsNonCommutingVariables` into the namespace, but not the dual?  It seems as though we can only access it through `NCSym.dual()`.  Is it because there is no name for the dual space?  Actually it is called Î QSym in "Commutative Combinatorial Hopf Algebras" `http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0605262`.  I think that we can do better than Î QSym for a name.  This reference seems to realize this space in the ring of polynomials (see equations (23) and (55) for this realization), but not clearly where Sym is a subalgebra.

I'm not 100% happy with the name (being the global namespace) since I seem to want to attach dual to function, as in the dual symmetric functions (as in linear functionals) in non-commuting variables.

Hey Mike,

The biggest thing why it's not imported is the name, I didn't think just calling it `DualSymmetricFunctionsNonCommutingVariables` was more descriptive than calling `SymmetricFunctionsNonCommutingVariables(QQ).dual()` (and it's not much shorter to call). I'm not 100% happy with the name (being the global namespace) since I seem to want to attach dual to function, as in the dual symmetric functions (as in linear functionals) in non-commuting variables. I know it doesn't make much sense, but it sounded more descriptive than `SymmetricFunctionsNonCommutingVariablesDual`. I'll import `Dual*` in the next version unless we come up with a better name. I can't think of one right now... Franco, you have any ideas as well?

I'll use http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0605262 to give a realization and also define a coercion from `QSym` into `DNCSym`.

Hey Darij,

Yes, up to abuse of labels on commutative diagrams. I'll change it to explicitly state that ``\chi \circ p = \phi` on Sym` (up to function names).

Best,

Travis

sage: Sp = SymmetricFunctions(QQ).p()

sage: Nh = SymmetricFunctionsNonCommutingVariables(QQ).h()
sage: Sp(Nh(Np([[1,4],[2,3]])).to_symmetric_function())

With **m**, **q**, **x** the coercion is consistent.

I am fairly sure the problem is with the projection `to_symmetric_function` in the **h** and the **e** bases.

The method `_set_par_to_par` is needed because does a little bit more than just return the shape and is needed for the [inverse] coercion. The method `_set_par_to_par()` in effect takes a subset of set partitions which are in bijection with partitions and corresponds to leading terms in the coercion.

With Mike's patch we have:

While it shouldn't work, it is giving the wrong error.

I've folded in your latest patch Mike, but reinstated `_set_par_to_par` with some documentation changes and some doctests. Hopefully it is more clear what it does, but perhaps the method could be renamed.

> But it's in class NCSymBases(Category_realization_of_parent), not in some hypothetical class MultiplicativeNCSymBases(NCSymBases) right?

Not quite. We need the `NCSymBasis_abstract` class to overwrite the `_element_constructor_` from `Parent`. This is not a category object, and all bases inherit from this (as classes). The different categories are used as a slightly different type of abstraction, which includes (in a sense) a mathematical organization.

I've also made the **w** basis inherit from `NCSymBasis_abstract`.

Hmm.  I still don't get `_set_par_to_par`.  Where does the `\lambda_i \leq \lambda_{i+1}` come in?

If it doesn't preserve the Hopf structure, we can't have it be a coercion (including the **w** basis to the homogeneous sym funcs). Instead we have to make them all conversions. I'll also add in the natural conversions (ex. the **p** basis to the powersum sym funcs) on the next update.

`from_symmetric_function` is already not a coercion.  It is just a method.  Are you saying that you don't want to make the map from Sym -> NCSym<sup>*</sup> a coercion?  It preserves the Hopf structure.

For NSym/QSym I believe we have the following:
* NSym -> Sym is a method `to_symmetric_function`
* Sym -> QSym is a coercion and can be accessed by `B( sfelement )` where `B` is a basis of QSym
* QSym -> Sym under the condition that the element in QSym `is_symmetric` by `qsymelement.to_symmetric_function()` or (and this is not preferred) `m( qsymelement )`

All of these maps preserve the Hopf algebra structure.  Similarly for NCSym/NCSym<sup>*</sup> we have
* NCSym -> Sym is a method `to_symmetric_function`
* Sym -> NCSym<sup>*</sup> is a coercion and can be accessed by `w( sfelement )`
* NCSym<sup>*</sup> -> Sym under the condition that the element in NCSym<sup>*</sup> `is_symmetric` by `ncsymdelement.to_symmetric_function()` or (and this is not preferred) `h( ncsymdelement )`

The maps NCSym -> Sym and NSym -> Sym are not coercions since these maps are projections and hence not invertible.  The inclusions of Sym -> NCSym<sup>*</sup> and Sym -> QSym have an inverse (one sided) and so I think that they can be coercions.  I am not too concerned that `p( ncsymdelement )` doesn't work.  The reason the portal through the `h` basis works is because of the connection with the **w** basis.

For `Sym -> QSym` it is the case that `Sym` exists as a subalgebra of `QSym`.

That is, let phi : NCSym -> Sym
then sometimes we have,
F != G
but 
phi(F) = phi(G) (e.g. F = A*B, G =B*A)

That is, "equalities go to equalities, but sometimes inequalities also go to equalities." (to my eye, not something I want as a coercion).  This isn't a hard fast rule, but it seems counter-intuitive to be able to coerce from NCSym to Sym rather than use the method `to_symmetric_function` to project onto that space.

For psi: Sym -> NCSym<sup>*</sup> we have psi(F)=psi(G) iff F=G, that is, "equalities going to equalities and inequalities going to inequalities"
