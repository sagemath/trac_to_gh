`src/doc/en/tutorial/programming.rst` contains the following text:

```
A common idiom is to iterate through the pairs in a dictionary:

::

    sage: d = {2:4, 3:9, 4:16}
    sage: [a*b for a, b in d.iteritems()]
    [8, 27, 64]

A dictionary is unordered, as the last output illustrates.
```

It may just be me being thick but I don't see how this illustrates that a dictionary is unordered.

Perhaps a better example
