Memory use is still increasing with 5.13.xx, but I don't see a particular object count go up in the way one would expect with a straight memory leak. This could just be fragmentation or some other difficult-to-control issue. The code I tried was:

```
sage: import gc
sage: from collections import Counter
sage: R=QQ['x']
sage: R.ideal(1)==R.ideal(1)
True
sage: gc.collect()
514
sage: pre = gc.get_objects()
sage: for i in range(100000): _ = R.ideal(1) == R.ideal(1)
sage: gc.collect()
0
sage: post = gc.get_objects()
sage: pre_id=set( id(p) for p in pre )
sage: new=[p for p in post if id(p) not in pre_id]
sage: C=Counter(type(p) for p in new)
sage: len(new)
51
sage: len(pre)-len(post)+len(new)
6
sage: C
Counter({<type 'list'>: 12, <type 'tuple'>: 8, <type 'dict'>: 7, <type 'frame'>: 6, <type 'instancemethod'>: 4, <type 'weakref'>: 3, <class '_ast.Name'>: 2, <class '_ast.Interactive'>: 1, <type 'dictionary-itemiterator'>: 1, <class '_ast.Assign'>: 1, <type 'listiterator'>: 1, <class '_ast.Module'>: 1, <class '_ast.Attribute'>: 1, <type 'builtin_function_or_method'>: 1, <type 'enumerate'>: 1, <class '_ast.Call'>: 1})
```
Hopefully the memory use flattens out after a while. It may well be that there was a serious leak for this example before that is now fixed. It may also be that we really are leaking, but not in python memory. Perhaps libsingular?

Sadly, this is most definitely a memory leak and, as shown above, not one in python space. The most likely suspect is LibSingular, especially because we already know that we're not interfacing with LibSingular reference counting properly. This might be a particularly easy example to trace through, so it may be worth doing, because it might show the way to proper LibSingular memory management. Just to confirm:

```

sage: count = 0
sage: p = get_memory_usage()

26.61328125

```
i.e., each batch of 1000 iterations grows memory use very consistently.

I can confirm that this time it is not a problem with cyclic garbage collection, as the number of objects tracked by the gc module does not increase:

```
sage: R = PolynomialRing(QQ, 'x', 2) 
sage: count = 0
sage: p = get_memory_usage()
sage: import gc
sage: _ = gc.collect()
sage: l = len(gc.get_objects())
sage: while R.ideal(1) == R.ideal(1):
....:     count += 1
....:     if (count%1000 == 0):
....:         _ = gc.collect()
....:         print get_memory_usage(p), len(gc.get_objects())-l
....:         p = get_memory_usage()
....:         
26.8984375 183
26.15234375 183
26.01171875 183

26.15234375 183
26.0078125 183
25.890625 183
26.15234375 183
26.0078125 183

26.15234375 183
26.0078125 183
26.015625 183
...
```
So, it could actually be that the Sage code triggers a memory leak in Singular.

Note the following variation:

```
sage: while R.ideal(1):
....:     count += 1
....:     if (count%1000 == 0):
....:         _ = gc.collect()

```
So, we need to *compare* ideals to see the leak. It is not enough to just *create* the ideals and then just test if they are nonzero.

Edit: By the way, I just noticed:

```
sage: R.ideal(1)!=1
False
sage: R.ideal(1)==1

sage: R.ideal(1)>1
False
sage: R.ideal(1)<1
False
sage: R.ideal(1)<=1
True
sage: R.ideal(1)>=1
True

The leak is still there:

```
sage: R.<x,y> = QQ[]
sage: count = 0
sage: while R.ideal([x]).groebner_basis() == [x]:
....:     count += 1
....:     if (count%1000 == 0):
....:         print get_memory_usage()

1094.15625
1107.48046875
1120.8046875
...
```
and even

```
sage: while 1:
....:     bla = R.ideal([1]).groebner_basis()
....:     count += 1
....:     if (count%1000 == 0):

1325.50390625

...
```

Hard to believe that this should be a leak in Singular. But apparently it is even in our more basic libsingular wrapper:

```
sage: from sage.libs.singular.function import singular_function
sage: groebner = singular_function('groebner')
sage: I = R.ideal(1)
sage: while 1:                  
    bla = groebner(I)
    count += 1
    if (count%1000 == 0):
        print get_memory_usage()
....:         
1352.421875
1365.74609375
1379.06640625
1394.38671875
1407.70703125
1421.02734375
...
```
Later today I'll try pure singular.

I tried this in Singular:

```
> ring R = 0, (x,y), dp;
> ideal I = 1;
> for (int count=0; 1; count++)
. { print((memory(1),memory(2)), "%;");
.   I = ideal(groebner(I)[1]);
. }
```
The memory consumption is constant, but I suppose that's because Singular knows that if an ideal is generated by a single element then this element is a standard basis:

```
> ideal I = x;
// ** redefining I **
> attrib(I, "isSB");
1
```

So, let's try with a different case:

```
> ideal I = x,y;
> for (int count=0; 1; count++)
. { if (count%1000==0) {print((memory(1),memory(2)), "%;");}
.   I = ideal(groebner(I)[1]) + ideal(groebner(I)[2]));
.   if (attrib(I, "isSB")) {print("not good");}  //just to be sure it isn't known to be standard
. }

2232320 2268160

2232320 2268160

2232320 2268160

2232320 2268160
```
So, it seems that the leak is in Sage and not in Singular, which I think is not a surprise.
