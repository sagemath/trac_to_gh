```
def search(p):
   R = RealField(p)
   m = 2^(2*p)+2^(p+1)-1
   l = []
   for a in range(2^p):
      for b in range(2^p):
         for e in range(2):
            l.append(a*b*2^e)
   l = uniq(l)
   l.sort()
   n = len(l)
   i = j = 0
   while i < n and l[i]-l[j] < m:
      i += 1
   sol = 0
   while i < n:
      if l[i]-l[j]==m:
         sol += 1
      j += 1
      while i < n and l[i]-l[j] < m:
         i += 1
   print "sol=", sol
```
I get:

```

I tried running the example again (with `ulimit -v 2000000` to keep memory usage within reasonable bounds) and got different errors.  First try:

```
sage: search(15)
sig_error() without sig_on()

Indeed, it seems that at least in the first run we explicitly do not use `sig_on()`:

```python
cdef ModuleElement _mul_long(self, long n):
    """
    Fast path for multiplying a C long.
    ...
    """
    cdef Integer x = <Integer>PY_NEW(Integer)
    if mpz_size(self.value) > 100000:
        sig_on()
        mpz_mul_si(x.value, self.value, n)
        sig_off()
    else:
        mpz_mul_si(x.value, self.value, n)
    return x
```

In the second one, `fast_tp_new()` does not check the result of an allocation:

```python

    new = PyObject_MALLOC( sizeof_Integer )
    ...
    memcpy(new, (<void*>global_dummy_Integer), sizeof_Integer )
```
The signal happens in `memcpy()`; I guess `PyObject_MALLOC()` returned `NULL`.

(Both fragments are from `integer.pyx`.)
