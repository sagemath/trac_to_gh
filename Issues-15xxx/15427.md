One would expect the performance of casting the usual way (as in test 1 below) to be at least not much worse than test 2:

```
sage: QQX=QQ['x']
sage: QP=Qp(3,30);
sage: R=QP.residue_field();
sage: RX=R['x'];
sage: prim=primes_first_n(1000)
sage: polysQQ = [ QQX(prim[i:i+30]) for i in range(1,900)]
sage: def test1(PR,l):
        return [PR(P) for P in l];
....:
sage: def test2(PR,l):
        return [PR([PR.base_ring()(coef) for coef in P.list()]) for P in l];
....:
sage: %timeit test1(RX,polysQQ)
1 loops, best of 3: 478 ms per loop
sage: %timeit test2(RX,polysQQ)
1 loops, best of 3: 230 ms per loop
```
Especially since the actual implementation of casting that is performed essentially reduces to converting to a list and casting as we do in test 2.

The problem is that the implementation of list->polynomial casting provided by Polynomial_template is very much not optimal, sufficiently so that two of the three implementing classes handle lists in their own __init__ rather than passing through to polynomial template.

The polynomial->polynomial casting is then also inefficient as it converts the poly to a list and recalls __init__. In the original code this bypassed the optimized list implementations in the implementing class, this is what the current patch changes. The effect on performance is as follows:

```
sage: %timeit test1(RX,polysQQ)
1 loops, best of 3: 219 ms per loop
```

There is still room for improvement, the current (and with patch) implementation will in most cases end up calling Polynomial_template.__init__ twice, and likely also Polynomial.__init__ twice, this is wasteful (even though the calls are largely no-ops). It would probably be better to, in addition to the currently proposed patch, special case casts from polynomials in the implementing classes the same way lists are done to avoid this.
