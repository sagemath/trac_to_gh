There is currently no class which models a discrete valuation. This would be very useful to talk about valuations e.g. on polynomial rings which can be used to compute factorizations over p-adics.

If you run the doctests for this, then some _test_category tests are failing. Do you have any idea what is wrong here? I have a feeling that I should just skip them.

Then, I'm not so sure about the coerce() pattern that I use at the beginning of many methods (in padic_valuation). Do you have any thought about this?
