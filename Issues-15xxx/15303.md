As found in #14711:comment:134, the following example shows that a combination of `register_embedding` and `register_coercion` can lead to a failure in transitivity for coercion discovery; also discussed on [sage-devel](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!topic/sage-devel/pH-97DE41wA):

```
class pA(Parent): pass
class pB(Parent): pass
class pC(Parent): pass

A=pA(); B=pB(); C=pC()

BtoA=Hom(B,A)(lambda x: A(x))
AtoC=Hom(A,C)(lambda x: C(x))
A.register_coercion(BtoA)
A.register_embedding(AtoC)

G=get_coercion_model()
G.discover_coercion(A,C) #finds AtoC
G.discover_coercion(B,A) #finds BtoA
G.discover_coercion(B,C) #does not find the composition of BtoA with AtoC
```
One workaround is simple: just don't use `register_embedding`. However, after #14711, there are different lifetime implications between using `register_embedding` and `register_coercion`, so this workaround might not be desirable.

The problem is that in the present implementation, both coercions are stored on `A`, so if a coercion from `B` to `C` is requested, it hard to realize that `A` should even be considered.

As far as I understand, the coercion model should behave as a digraph on the parents, where a coercion between parents exists if there is a path from one to the other. In that model, coercion existence should be transitive, so the behaviour described is a bug.

One way to work around it is, at least for coercion discovery, to store the coercion always on the codomain. By #14711 this can now happen without the implication that the codomain will keep the domain alive. We would have to store it in a place where it can be used for coercion discovery, though.

If it is desirable to keep the current lifetime implications for `register_embedding` (and it probably is) then we should ensure this separately, either by also storing the embedding map on the domain or by just having a direct reference from the domain to the codomain.

It has also been discussed on sage-devel that the existence of a coercion from B to C would change over time. Namely:
1. Create B and C. You will not find a coercion, because A is not known yet.
2. Create A, registering a coercion from B to A and an embedding of A into C.
3. Provided that we fixed the problem of transitivity, we would now find a coercion from B to C via A.

I suppose that this phenomenon can not be avoided: We can not have a static coercion digraph (otherwise we would restrict ourselves to a fixed finite set of usable parents), and when we have a dynamic coercion graph, then it is, well, dynamic.

However, one additional complication arises with the current implementation: The *absence* of a coercion is cached. Hence, if we asked for a coercion in 1., then in 3. you would still not get a coerce map, because the absence of a coercion has been cached in 1.

Let `phi: A -> B` and do `A.register_embedding(phi)`. Currently, `B` is not aware of the existence of `phi`. Hence, the backtracking algorithm will currently ignore `phi`. We don't want to store `phi` as a *strong* attribute of `B`, hence, don't want to put it into `B._coerce_from_list`. But perhaps we could create a new attribute of type `MonoDict` and store the embedding there? For example `B._coerce_embeddings_from[A] = phi`, *in addition* to `A._coerce_embedding = phi`. Since it is a `MonoDict` and thus has weak references to the keys, B would not prevent A from being garbage collected (but of course A would still keep B alive, because we registered the coerce embedding).

Once this is done, we could change the backtracking so that it not only iterates over `B._coerce_from_list`, but it *additionally* iterates over `B._coerce_embeddings_from`.

But what about the problem of caching coercions? We should carefully think if the current scenario (`A.register_coercion(B)` plus `A.register_embedding(C)`) is the only scenario that could dynamically change the coercion graph. Here, I assume that `self.register_embedding()` and `self.register_coercion()` are *only* called during `self.__init__()`.

How to make it possible to allow a coercion via a newly created parent?

Perhaps the following would be feasible: If we do `A.register_embedding(psi)`, where `psi: A -> C`, then we clear the coercion cache of `C`, in the sense of *all cache items stating the **absence** of a coercion to `C` will be deleted*.

Note that clearing it in the sense of *all cached coercions to `C` will be deleted* is likely to be a bad idea, because the cached coercions might have already been used. So, we should restrict ourselves to allowing new coercions by removing the "there is no coercion" flag.

So, would the suggestion make sense to you?
- Have a new `MonoDict` that stores all coerce embeddings leading *into* the parent (hence, we would have a strong reference from domain to codomain, and I suggest adding a weak reference from codomain to domain), that will be used in the backtracking algorithm.
- When registering an embedding, then remove all "there is no coercion" flags from the coercion cache of the codomain.

Hm. Probably this is not good enough. What if we have had `D.coerce_map_from(C)`, and had cached the absence of a coercion from `B` to `D`? After adding `A`, we would find a coercion from `B` to `D` via `A` and `C`. Hence, cleaning the coercion cache of `C` would not be enough---we would need to clean the coercion cache of all parents into which `C` coerces.

Given this example, it seems to me that we could only solve the problem in a drastic way: Do not cache the absence of a coercion at all. But caching the absence of a coercion is essential for speed. So, the drastic solution would probably be correct, but highly infeasible.

If nobody has a better suggestion, then I think we should restrict ourselves to just fix the transitivity problem; the cache problem (it seems to me) is not solvable without creating a drastic slow-down.

> 3. Provided that we fixed the problem of transitivity, we would now find a coercion from B to C via A.


There would be an additional effect, by the way: If the coercion that does get discovered is stored as a composition (on C) then there is now a reference from C._coerce_from_hash to A. This reference lives in a MonoDict keyed by B, so this reference remains as long as B is alive. So we see that as long as B and C are alive, then A will be kept alive as well (thus, with monodicts we can have objects whose lifetime depends on two objects BOTH being alive)

Note that if the composition gets computed in a smarter way (for instance, a composition of homomorphisms between finitely generated rings could be explicitly computed by computing the images of the generators and constructing a straight homomorphism from B to C out of that) then the resulting coercion map might not refer to A anymore.

I am not saying that this is avoidable nor that we should consider this a memory leak: we're keeping A in memory for a good reason, even if the reason is not directly supplied by the user.

> However, one additional complication arises with the current implementation: The *absence* of a coercion is cached. Hence, if we asked for a coercion in 1., then in 3. you would still not get a coerce map, because the absence of a coercion has been cached in 1.


There are milder ways of invalidating caches: We could mark cached non-existence with a "coercion graph version number". When a non-existence is retrieved, one could check the current "coercion graph version number" and if the current graph is newer, we'd have to reinvestigate the "None". Frankly, I don't believe that would give acceptable performance either, but we could at least be much more lazy about invalidating "no coercion exists" findings.

Yes, something along those lines. In fact, since `_coerce_embeddings_from` and `_coerce_from_list` would serve the same purpose from the perspective of coercion discoveries, I think the entries in `_coerce_from_list` should also be added to `_coerce_embeddings_from`, because it would simplify the code. By then it would make more sense to call the attribute `_coerce_from_to_be_used_in_backtracking` and the list that is now `_coerce_from_hash` could be `_coerce_from_cached_results`.

By then we should probably be storing ALL maps there in weakened form.

The only function of `_coerce_from_list` now is to keep domains alive, so it would be more economical to replace that by a list `_domains_to_keep_alive` where we can store strong references to the domains of the corresponding weakened maps that are now in `_coerce_from_to_be_used_in_backtracking`

So we would end up with (names up for choice):
- `P._coercion_cache`: MonoDict containing discovered (weakened) maps into P.
- `P._coercion_maps`: MonoDict containing (weakened) maps into P that get used by backtracking
- `P._domains_to_keep_alive`: List of domains that should be kept alive as long as P lives.
- `P._codomains_to_keep_alive`: List of codomains that should be kept alive as long as P lives. Normally, such codomains Q would have an entry in `Q._coercion_maps[P]`. Just storing a map in P._coerce_embedding would also have this effect.

In the present naming system, it wasn't immediately clear to me what purposes `_coerce_from_hash` and `_coerce_from_list` served, so changing those names could be beneficial.

Yes, I don't have any suggestions that I seriously believe would lead to acceptable performance.

Perhaps I have not been clear. A non-sink non-source is something that has both in-arrows (i.e., is codomain of a registered coercion or coerce embedding) and out-arrows (i.e., is domain of a registered coercion or coerce embedding). It is easy to keep track of this property while registering a coercion or coerce embedding.

But I actually think that your idea is better anyway:

> A start might be to only version up on "embedding" creations.


It seems to me that this versioning would be complete under reasonable assumptions, based on the following lemma.

**Lemma**

Assume for all parents `P`, `Q`,  `P.register_coercion(Q)` will be done in `P.__init__()`, but not later. Assume that parents `R` and `S` exist at time `t_0`, but there is no path from `R` to `S` in the coerce digraph at time `t_0`. Assume that between time `t_0` and time `t_1`, `.register_embedding()` has never been called. Then, there is no path from `R` to `S` in the coerce digraph at time `t_1`.

__Proof__

Proof be contradiction. We assume that there is a path from `R` to `S` at time `t_1`. Hence, this path contains an arrow `a` that has been added to the coerce digraph after `t_0`. Since no `register_embedding()` has occurred between `t_0` and `t_1`, all arrows created between `t_0` and `t_1` have been added by `register_coercion()`. But by hypothesis, `register_coercion()` is only called during `__init__` of the codomain. 

Hence, all arrows created between `t_0` and `t_1` end at parents created after `t_0`. Therefore, a path in the coerce digraph at time `t_1` that contains `a` will necessarily end at a parent that has been created after `t_0`. This is a contradiction, since `S` has already existed at time `t_0`

**q.e.d.**

> That might very well be usable. I expect "embeddings" to be relatively rare, and I think we can declare in our documentation they are not the preferred way of expressing relations (they are vary prone to creating non-commutative diamonds).


We could express in the documentation that one should call `register_coercion` only in the initialisation. Since `register_embedding` can only be called one time for each parent, I don't think we need to say that other methods of establishing a coercion are preferred.

Probably.

I have introduced `Parent._registered_domains` for exactly this purpose, at #14711. So, we should extend its use.

Yes, and that's why I don't think we need `P._codomains_to_keep_alive` (I'd prefer the name `P._registered_codomains`). Even in weakened maps, we have a strong reference to the codomain.

```

What has been done in the patch:
- renaming of attributes (`_coerce_from_backtracking` etc)
- do not use a list, but use a `MonoDict` for all morphisms that are supposed to be fundamental for backtracking. There is a list `_registered_domains`, so that domains of registered coercions are kept alive by the codomain, but the domain of a registered embedding is *not* kept alive by the codomain.


Missing: Tests and versioning.

yes, conversion probably needs some attention too. However, since conversions exits between a lot more pairs of parents, Do we use backtracking to discover them? There are almost certainly loops: trivially, because ZZ->Z/nZ and Z/nZ->ZZ are valid conversions.

If we want a memory leak-free implementation I suspect having conversion without lifetime implications in either direction is required. Definitely material for another ticket.

Hence, I think that the current commit solves our problem. In spite of the following "todo" list, I put it to "needs review" (but I am sure that further commits will be pushed soon).

TODO:

- Add documentation, stating that registering of coercions should *only* be done during initialisation, and that registering of embeddings shouldn't be done too often.
- Run all doctests---since playing with the coercion digraph is asking for trouble, I wouldn't be surprised about bad surprises `:-P`
- **Important:** Get timings for examples that should be most sensitive against slow-downs in coercion.

> - **Important:** Get timings for examples that should be most sensitive against slow-downs in coercion.


Looking at what happens for number fields, I have the impression that `QQ._populate_coercion_lists_` is most frequently used to supply embeddings (I'm not getting many hits on direct calls to !register_embedding, see below)

The only two classes I have been able to identify that actually install embeddings are numberfields (and not all of them) and AbelianGroupWithValues_class

So, assuming that the version check itself is lightning-fast (and why shouldn't it be?) I expect that negatively affected examples would have to do a lot of number field or AbelianGroupWithValues creations interleaved with complicated coercion discovery that benefits a lot from knowing certain coercions do NOT exist.

There's AdditiveAbelianGroupWrapper which does an `_unset_coercions_used` together with a `register_embedding` (registering an "embedding" of the wrapper into the wrapped)

There's also UniversalCyclotomicField which registers an embedding into QQbar upon init, so that shouldn't really affect versioning.

Aha!

With my current branch, the coerce map from `ZZ` to `QQbar` goes **via the universal cyclotomic field**, if one has created the universal field before putting the coercion into the cache.

Obvious reason: With my patch, both registered coercions *and* registered embeddings are used for backtracking, in order to fix the example of the ticket description. However, *if* there is a registered coercion, then I guess it should have preference over the registered embedding for backtracking. After all, the registered embedding is some kind of "forward", not "back".

So, modified suggestion: We should not put both registered coercions and registered embeddings into `codomain._coerce_from_backtracking`, but we should have two separate containers, and should look for the coerce embeddings only if no registered coercions are left.

Rationale: We suppose that registering coercions happens during initialisation of the codomain, whereas registering an embedding will happen *after* creation of the codomain. Since the backtracking starts at the codomain, we should have a clear preference for using those maps that are closely tied to the codomain---and these are the maps registered during creation of the codomain.

I don't think that rationale is quite valid for the way it gets used. If we do

```
a+b
```
then we'll be investigating whether b can be coerced into the parent of a and whether a can be coerced into the parent of b. The original question doesn't actually specify a special role for the codomain (which is still up for choice!)

It seems to me that you want to argue (and your example backs you up in this) that while there can be multiple paths in the coercion graph, there are some paths that should be preferred over others. If we want to model this properly, we would have to include this information in the graph. One way would be to give each coercion a "cost" and we'd be looking for the lowest cost path (which could change with mutations of the graph!).

For your suggestion to fit in such a model, we would need that:
- any path including an embedding is higher cost that a path without.
- if a path has been discovered, new paths between the same parents that may arise by graph mutations are higher cost

It's not immediately clear to me that those assumptions are valid.

Note: what we're trying to solve on this ticket hasn't actually caused problems in real life, partly because embeddings are indeed rare. I could see the temporary outcome of this ticket being "yes, this is a potential problem, here are a few things we could do to fix it, but the cost of doing this is considerable.

Note one remark in the code:

```
                # If there is something better in the list, try to return that instead
                # This is so, for example, _coerce_map_from_ can return True but still
                # take advantage of the _populate_coercion_lists_ data.
```
The `_populate_coercion_lists_` data are also put into `_coerce_from_cache`. Hence, these data will have priority over `_coerce_map_from_` in `self.coerce_map_from(other)`. Therefore, `self.discover_coerce_map_from(other)` will *only* be called if there are no relevant `_populate_coercion_lists_` data.

Hence, I believe that the remark is not valid, and will remove it.

I found that the example above has the following structure:
- We have parents `A` and `B`. We search a coercion `A -> B`.
- `B` stores coercions (for backtracking) from parents `C` and `D`. Only `C` is registered by `B.register_coercion(...)`, whereas the coercion from `D` was registered in a different way, *after* initialisation of `B`.
- There is a coercion `phi` from `A` to `C` and a coercion `psi` from `A` to `D`. Sage knows that `phi` and `psi` exist. However, calling `psi` internally relies on a coercion from `A` to `B`.
- The coercion from `A` to `B` **must** go via `C`, starting with `phi`. Otherwise, if one tries to coerce `A` via `D` into `B`, calling `psi` (as part of a composite coerce map) will result in an infinite recursion.

__Problem with the current commits__

It currently depends on a random choice whether the backtracking algorithm first goes back from `B` to `C` (and finds a good coerce map from `A`) or from `B` to `D` (and finds a map from `A` that crashes).

We need to give a hint to the coercion system that it should try `C` first. In vanilla Sage, this is easy, because the registered coercions are in a list, and the maps registered first are chosen first. But with my current patch, all registered coercions and coerce embeddings are stored in a `MonoDict`. Hence, the order of registration has no implication on the order of execution.

__Suggested solution__

This brings me back to the idea to keep a **list** of registered coercions, that would automatically keep the domain of registered coercions alive, and a `MonoDict` of other coercions used for backtracking (e.g. registered embeddings), whose domains are not necessarily kept alive.

In discover_coercion, we would then first consider the registered coercions, and only if their study is complete would the backtracking turn towards the other coercions.

__Perhaps useful__

We have `self.register_coercion(mor)`, that adds a coercion to the *list* of coercions that the backtracking algorithm is starting with. In addition, we might have a method `self.additional_coercion(mor)`, that will put `mor` only in the `MonoDict` of coercions that the backtracking algorithm is considering only later.

Would this be useful? If "yes", what lifetime implications do we want? Shall the domain of an "additional coercion" be kept alive?

Hence, you'll end up relying on essentially unspecified (well, implementation-specified) behaviour. That makes it very hard to reason about how the system should behave and hence to determine (in the future) whether something is a bug. It may well be (in the end) that enforcing a lookup order turns out to be required to keep performance, but it would probably be preferable to find a better solution.\n\nAs you observe, the coercion A->D is in actuality derived from A->B, but apparently not by a straightforward composition. However, doesn't that mean that if A->D is discovered, then A->B must be discovered already? If A->D relies on A->B, I think part of registering A->D is ensuring that A->B is discovered.\n\nSince it seems we need a tie-breaker for multiple paths anyway, and there is a cost system (which I think was primarily introduced for pushout construction!), it is then just a matter of ensuring that the cost of A->D is higher than the cost of A->B. Then anything that can be done from A and then via B or D will prefer the direct path A->B.\n\nSo it seems to me that the \"theoretically\" better solution (which may be prohibitive cost-wise!) would be:\n- recalibrate some of the costs\n- take the costs properly into account\n- probably do so via breadth-first (for finding shortest path, it allows much better pruning)\n\nI think that should solve the A->D problem as well.",

It may well be that you can hide the problem by enforcing some lookup order, but you'd be introducing data (in this case list order) that is not part of our model. Hence, you'll end up relying on essentially unspecified (well, implementation-specified) behaviour. That makes it very hard to reason about how the system should behave and hence to determine (in the future) whether something is a bug. It may well be (in the end) that enforcing a lookup order turns out to be required to keep performance, but it would probably be preferable to find a better solution.

As you observe, the coercion A->D is in actuality derived from A->B, but apparently not by a straightforward composition. However, doesn't that mean that if A->D is discovered, then A->B must be discovered already? If A->D relies on A->B, I think part of registering A->D is ensuring that A->B is discovered.

Since it seems we need a tie-breaker for multiple paths anyway, and there is a cost system (which I think was primarily introduced for pushout construction!), it is then just a matter of ensuring that the cost of A->D is higher than the cost of A->B. Then anything that can be done from A and then via B or D will prefer the direct path A->B.

So it seems to me that the "theoretically" better solution (which may be prohibitive cost-wise!) would be:
- recalibrate some of the costs
- take the costs properly into account
- probably do so via breadth-first (for finding shortest path, it allows much better pruning)

I think that should solve the A->D problem as well.

How to formulate a model that takes into account dependencies between arrows of a digraph? In particular between arrows that may not even be adjacent?

> As you observe, the coercion A->D is in actuality derived from A->B, but apparently not by a straightforward composition.


Correct. When calling the coercion A->D, some arithmetic is performed on underlying data, this involves coercion, and this is when A->B occurs.

> However, doesn't that mean that if A->D is discovered, then A->B must be discovered already?


No. You can easily define a map and then compose with other maps, without calling it. A->B is only needed for **calling** A->D, but not for **definining** A->D.

> If A->D relies on A->B, I think part of registering A->D is ensuring that A->B is discovered.


Yes, and how to model this?

> Since it seems we need a tie-breaker for multiple paths anyway, and there is a cost system (which I think was primarily introduced for pushout construction!), it is then just a matter of ensuring that the cost of A->D is higher than the cost of A->B. Then anything that can be done from A and then via B or D will prefer the direct path A->B.


... but only if, in addition, we actually use the coerce costs in `discover_coercion()`, rather then returning the first map that came across.

Perhaps.

- Breadth first search might be a good idea. I don't know how to efficiently implement it, but I guess this should be done at some point.
- Calibrating the costs, such that `A->C->B` is guaranteed to have less cost than `A->D->B` for any example in which `A->C` is independent of but `A->D` is dependent on `A->B`, requires a case-by-case analysis. Not very practical, and moreover choosing parameters such that "it works" is kind of arbitrary. This is not a very clean solution either.

Before we have implemented breadth first search, I believe it would be more practical to say that we should
- give preference to maps registered during initialisation (`P.register_coercion(mor)`)
- give less preference to maps registered after initialisation (`mor.register_as_coercion()`)
- give least preference to registered embeddings (I am talking about backtracking here, not pushout).

This is practical because this approach is close to what is done in vanilla Sage. The current registration order is such that "it works".

Hm, where does `AtoC.register_as_coercion()` fit in with the "only initialize coercions upon `__init__` of the parent"?

> Do you agree on this change of aim?

Well, I think what you're saying is that under certain conditions we require that the graph is fed more than just the backbone. Instead of relying on the coercion system to discover the full transitive closure, we mandate that the graph as offered should already be transitively closed in some aspects. If you can make those aspects clear and workable, I guess that could be a solution too.

Hi!

Both `AtoC.register_as_coercion()` and `A.register_embedding(AtoC)` add an arrow to the coerce digraph *after* initialisation of C. With regard to the above lemma, one should only cache the absence of a coercion until an arrow is inserted with a previously existing codomain. Hence, in both cases we need to increase the cache version number.

OUCH!!

I just found that `discover_coerce_map_from` did not mark arrows as "used" at all! Hence, there is (another) bug in our backtracking algorithm.

The problematic map is a `DefaultConvertMap_unique`, and this could explain why the problem arose now: In vanilla Sage, this kind of maps is only returned if the backtracking finds nothing better.

But in one of my commits, I made sure that the backtracking is not attempted if `self._coerce_map_from_(S)` returns `True` or returns an actual map.

As it turns out, Sage relies on the assumption that backtracking usually is better.

In other words: In vanilla Sage, dependencies between arrows of the coerce digraph are implicitly declared by
- choosing an order of registered coercions
- avoiding `DefaultConverMap` and friends.

I am not happy about the existing way of implicit declaration of dependencies and think we should do better!

Can we explain these rules purely in terms of the coercion graph? Does `_coerce_map_from_(..)==True` somehow indicate an edge with a property (colour?) that should be avoided or an edge with the cost modified (increased)? If the graph version is increased, do we invalidate paths with a bad colour as well, because now there might be one with a better colour? (OK, we can't call this property colour, obviously.

Of course. By "temporarily forbidden", I mean those that have already been visited in the depth-first search and shall thus not be visited again during the same search. Thus "temporarily", because in the next search they could be visited.

> That would be an even better reason to see if we can get a "cheapest first" search in, since that naturally avoids cycles.


How would that be?

Also note that if you want to compare costs, you need to construct the maps. It could become very costly, if you want to compare many paths.


> Replying to [SimonKing](#comment%3A53):

Somehow (see below).

> Does `_coerce_map_from_(..)==True` somehow indicate an edge with a property (colour?) that should be avoided or an edge with the cost modified (increased)?


Not at all. `_coerce_map_from_` is only called if there is no edge. Note that "long time ago" (in one of the posts above) I talked about "short-cuts" in the coerce digraph. `_coerce_map_from_` is for the shortcuts, not for the edges.

So, in terms of the coerce digraph: We have a digraph with some connected components X,Y. It is possible that there is a coercion from a node x in X to a node y in Y; this is the case of `y._coerce_map_from_(x)` returns True or returns a map. However, this does not mean that an edge is inserted that would connect X and Y: The two components remain separate, and a reference to any node in Y does not prevent the whole component X from garbage collection.

This situation is easy. Difficulties only arise if x and y belong to *the same* component X. In this situation, we may have several possibilities to construct a map from x to y: There could be different paths in X, and there could be a map provided by `y._coerce_map_from_(x)`, or `y._coerce_map_from_(x)` returns True. In the latter case, it means that we can use `y._generic_convert_map(x)` for coercion.

Which of these maps to choose? It is required that these maps are mathematically the same. So, our choice can not be based on the maths only.

Well, you could hold off on actually creating the map composition until you've determined the lowest cost path. However, I think we have bigger problems to solve before we could contemplate doing this.

(nitpick: I don't think we want to talk about "connected components" if we're considering a digraph. Perhaps we should say y is "reachable" from x).

If `y._coerce_map_from_(x)` can return "true" or a map if the coercion graph otherwise doesn't have a path from x to y then the current coercion model is significantly different from the digraph model we're talking about. If we have a coercion path X->Z->Y where the coercion from Y to Z can only be found using `_coerce_map_from_` then we cannot discover the coercion from X to Y (how would we know to involve Z?) but we can discover the coercions X->Z and Z->Y. So we're fundamentally breaking transitivity already.

Perhaps one way out is if `_coerce_map_from_` indeed only returns "shortcuts": paths between nodes that exist otherwise, so only in the situation you describe as "Difficult".

If we cannot trust that the return map from `_coerce_map_from_` (either explicitly, or the implied conversion) is the best possible, then there's no use in having it return anything: we'd have to investigate the rest of the coercion graph anyway.

I agree that relying on conversion maps in the coercion framework looks very suspect: conversions are supposed to be trying coercion first!

So it seems to me that _coerce_map_from_ returning True should perhaps be abolished entirely and that in other cases one should be very careful with implementing _coerce_map_from_. It can certainly not be the only coercion hook one provides if we want to have a digraph model.

I suppose you mean

```
sage: number_field_morphisms.EmbeddedNumberFieldMorphism(K,L)
```
According to the documentation it shouldn't because by default it tries to see if K and L are both naturally embedded in CC, and they are not.

The following already does work:

```
sage: number_field_morphisms.EmbeddedNumberFieldMorphism(K,L,L) #any combination of K and L
Generic morphism:
  From: Number Field in i0 with defining polynomial x^2 - 6*x + 37/4
  To:   Number Field in i with defining polynomial x^2 + 1
  Defn: i0 -> 1/2*i + 3
sage: number_field_morphisms.EmbeddedNumberFieldMorphism(L,L)
Generic endomorphism of Number Field in i with defining polynomial x^2 + 1
  Defn: i -> i
```
The latter suggests that the routine does take some liberties. For K we get

```
sage: number_field_morphisms.EmbeddedNumberFieldMorphism(K,K)
RuntimeError: maximum recursion depth exceeded while calling a Python object
```
so the difference in behaviour between L and K seems dodgy.

No, because `K._coerce_map_from_(L)` gives you shortcuts. It may very well be that it returns a map that is *much* "cheaper" then a composition of registered coercions and registered embeddings leading from L to K.

And note that these shortcuts will also arise during backtracking. Namely, if K has registered coercions from R1,...,Rn, then the backtracking will involve to ask `R1._coerce_map_from_(L)`, ..., `Rn._coerce_map_from_(L)` for shortcuts.

Hence, it is not enough to assign costs to arrows in the digraph.

Correct.

No. This is exactly the digraph-with-shortcuts model I kept talking about since comment 84 of #14711 (hence, since 3 weeks). Since then, I used the term "digraph model" only as an abbreviation of the lengthy term "digraph-with-shortcuts model".

You mean from Z to Y?

Yes, which is part of the specification of the digraph-with-shortcuts model.

That said: We now have version numbers of the coerce digraph. Hence, caching the absence of a coercion would no longer be a problem, and I could imagine that by now it would be possible to turn a short-cut Z->Y into an actual arrow of the digraph.

However, I could also imagine that this would have two disadvantages:
1. It would depend on the command history whether Sage would find a coercion from X to Y (via Z) or not. Arguably, it would be better than the status quo, which is "we won't find a coercion from X to Y via Z, even if we know that Z exists and has a coercion into Y".
2. The list of maps-to-be-considered in the backtracking algorithm grew. Hence, it would increase the running time for detecting a coerce map.

> Perhaps one way out is if `_coerce_map_from_` indeed only returns "shortcuts": paths between nodes that exist otherwise, so only in the situation you describe as "Difficult".


I don't understand what you mean by this.

In vanilla Sage, `_coerce_map_from_` does return nothing but "shortcuts" (i.e., things that the backtracking algorithm does not know about). It does so both in the easy situation and in the difficult situation. The easy situation is if the backtracking algorithm finds no path, hence, the shortcut is the only option, hence, we don't have the burden of choosing something (therefore the situation is "easy").

> If we cannot trust that the return map from `_coerce_map_from_` (either explicitly, or the implied conversion) is the best possible, then there's no use in having it return anything: we'd have to investigate the rest of the coercion graph anyway.


I think I have already described what is currently done:
1. It is tested whether there is a short-cut phi (either explicitly or implicitly).
2. Even if phi is found, backtracking is performed. Backtracking "goes back" according to the registered coercions, and may involve short-cuts by recursion. Let's call psi the first map found by backtracking (if there is any).
3. If both phi and psi are available, then return the less costly. If only one of them is available, return it. Otherwise, there is no coercion.

My current commits (at least those I have at home) change it as follows
- If `_coerce_map_from_` explicitly returns an actual map, then the backtracking search is *not* performed, but it is trusted that the map is good to be used.
- If `_coerce_map_from_` returns True, then it says *implicitly* that `_generic_convert_map` could in principle be used for coercion, but there might be better options. Hence, similar to vanilla Sage, my branch would do a backtracking and return the less costly map.
- Registered *embeddings* are used for backtracking, too, whereas vanilla Sage only uses registered coercions.

We might play with the idea of extending the last point, namely: Turn the short-cuts into permanent arrows, to be used by backtracking. But then we need to take care of lifetime implications, and we need to take care of a potential slow-down of the backtracking.

> I agree that relying on conversion maps in the coercion framework looks very suspect: conversions are supposed to be trying coercion first!


I did not state that it looks suspect. Hence, we don't agree. Saying "we use conversion as coercion" is just short for "we take the map that is returned by `_generic_convert_map`, cache this map in `_coerce_from_cache`, and henceforth use this map for coercion (and of course for conversion, too)".

> So it seems to me that _coerce_map_from_ returning True should perhaps be abolished entirely and that in other cases one should be very careful with implementing _coerce_map_from_.


I disagree.

> It can certainly not be the only coercion hook one provides if we want to have a digraph model.


If we want to keep the current digraph-with-shortcuts model, then we indeed need at least two hooks: One that adds arrows to the digraph, and one that provides short-cuts. In my branch, I suggest to extend the role of registered embeddings, namely: To make them actual arrows, to be used in backtracking.

So shouldn't the rule be: If `K._coerce_map_from_(L)` returns something then one of the following must be true
- There is a registered coercion from L to K
- There is a registered embedding from L to K
- For any structure M that coerces into L, K._coerce_map_from_(M) also returns something.

i.e., either the coercion system has enough information to compute transitive closures by itself or `_coerce_map_from_` ensures transitive closure by itself already.

> Hence, it is not enough to assign costs to arrows in the digraph.


No, "shortcut" paths returned by `_coerce_map_from_` should carry a cost as well, obviously. And one would hope their cost roughly corresponds the cheapest path that can be discovered otherwise (perhaps with a small modifier to make it more attractive to use this particular path).

Aren't the "shortcuts" supposed to be an implementation detail to more efficiently implement the theoretical digraph model? In that case we can reason about their desired properties purely based on the theoretical digraph model.

If you're claiming the shortcuts are something else and deserve their own theoretical interpretation as well, I'd be interested in seeing what you mean by them.

This makes me wonder what exactly the axioms of this "digraph-with-shortcuts model" is. I can see how "digraph-with-shortcuts" can be used to implement a proper digraph model more efficiently, if the shortcuts follow some rules (as stated above). If our theoretical model is "digraph-with-costs" I can see a "digraph-with-costs-and-shortcuts" implementation, where the shortcuts would obviously have to provide a cost on them too: the cost of the path they are providing the "shortcut" for (modulo little tweaks).

> You mean from Z to Y?


Yes, sorry.

My conclusion would be that our digraph-with-shortcuts implementation is failing to properly implement a straight digraph model.

> That said: We now have version numbers of the coerce digraph. Hence, caching the absence of a coercion would no longer be a problem, and I could imagine that by now it would be possible to turn a short-cut Z->Y into an actual arrow of the digraph.


No, that's going to be a mess. I think the "actual arrow" would basically have to be there already (or be implied to be there by _coerce_map_from_ somehow magically ensuring that it will be returning results consistent with it).

Hopefully my explanation above now clarifies this: In my opinion "-with-shortcuts" is an implementation detail to gain efficiency, not a part of the model, because I don't see what kind of reasonable model one would have then.

It seems to me they are not just "shortcuts" then. It seems that an opportunity is provided to provide parts of the graph in a programmatic way. As pointed out, such a presentation is not transparent for backtracking, so if one wants to provide something that is closed under path composition, we would need that the implemented `_coerce_map_from_` ensures the closure by itself.

That means that providing coercions (just) via `_coerce_map_from_` is actually a rather difficult thing to do correctly, whereas presently I think we advertise it as the easier, almost preferred way of doing it.

> My current commits (at least those I have at home) change it as follows

I think that's a reasonable thing to do.

A feature like that might be OK (I guess it makes it easier to reuse code, because the programming paradigm makes it a little easier to implement "conversions" (parent call) than to implement coercions directly, but "correct" use would need that map, or an equivalent one, to be available for backtracking as well, or above-described closed property of `_coerce_map_from_`.

> > So it seems to me that _coerce_map_from_ returning True should perhaps be abolished entirely and that in other cases one should be very careful with implementing _coerce_map_from_.

What other purpose does `_coerce_map_from_` serve than shortcutting a backtracking search? If that is its only purpose then getting a result back that may compare unfavourably with alternative results from backtracking is useless. We may have the resulting _generic_convert_map as a registered coercion then, so that it naturally gets considered as part of the normal search.

OK, above I think we have identified that `_coerce_map_from_` serve another purpose: Providing paths into a parent programmatically, leaving transitive closure properties as a responsibility to the implementor of the specific `_coerce_map_from_` routine.

**Conjecture:** (Robert may be able to confirm or deny) The coercion model was designed to implement a digraph. However, the costs of full recursive backtracking were feared to be too high, so it was hoped that in a lot of cases, paths could be computed rather than recursively discovered, leaving only a relatively small number of candidates to be compared (i.e., `Y._coerce_map_from_(X)` should usually return a map directly, if there is one at all, so backtracking from Z shouldn't normally have to search very far to find a Y with a registered coercion into Z that knows how to handle X).

The cost in this approach is that `_coerce_map_from_` needs to handle transitive closure by itself already. Backing it up with registered coercions anyway would leave us with too many paths to backtrack on anyway [that's only slightly mitigated by your "early exit" proposal]

Well, the point I wanted to make is: One needs to construct the maps, because only the map know about their costs.

Don't we almost always have the map in hand? When we find the map as a registered coercion or embedding, we can readily read off the cost. We can also do that when we get a map back from `_coerce_map_from_`. The only case where we have to estimate the cost is when we get the existence of a map via `K._coerce_map_from_(L)==True`, but in that case I expect the cost is a fixed number anyway, because it's a generically constructed map.

I assume that the cost of a composition is the sum of the costs of the composed maps, because otherwise we are not working on a weighted digraph.

That means we can simply sum the costs of the edges to get the cost of a path. No need to compute the "composition" of the maps explicitly until we actually need it.

Your "don't consider other maps coming into `K` if we're getting an actual map back from `K._coerce_map_from_(L)`" is then simply an assumption that `K._coerce_map_from_(L)` returns the cheapest map available. I think it helps making such assumptions about the coercion discovery algorithm explicit.

> Why should `A._coerce_map_from(B)` return anything?


Because if I'm not mistaken, the implementor of A can decide to implement coercion into A via _coerce_map_from_. Thus we'd have

```
class type_of_A(...):
...
    def _coerce_map_from_(self,S):
        if S is self.C_on_which_A_is_based:
            return True
        return self._coerce_map_via([self.C_on_which_A_is_based],S)

class type_of_C(...):
...
    def _coerce_map_from_(self,S):
        if is_instance(S,type_of_B):
            return True
        <other stuff>
```
With this one would get

```
sage: A._coerce_map_from_(C)
True
sage: C._coerce_map_from_(B)
True
sage: A._coerce_map_from_(B)
Composite map ...
```
As far as I can see (taking, for instance `CC._coerce_map_from_` as an example) this would be a legitimate way of implementing coercion, and as you can see, the map found from C to A is explicitly returned, but consists of maps that are generic conversion maps.

> Aren't you rather talking about `A.discover_coerce_map_from(B)` that recurses to C and thus calls `C._coerce_map_from_(B)`?


No, I'm talking about implementing part of the coercion graph (with backtracking on its paths) programmatically as part of the implementation of a parent via `_coerce_map_from_`. I think this was expressly a part of the current design and I think there are many examples of this in sage.

Reading the documentation of `discover_coerce_map_from`, it seems that routine would have the same issue (because it also seems to dislike `DefaultConvertMap`, and the fragment above shows that it is quite possible to get a composition of `DefaultConvertMap`s back, which should be even more disliked)

At this point it seems to me the coercion graphs gets specified in two ways:
- the `_coerce_map_from_` world, where coercions and backtracking procedures are provided in a distributed, programmatic fashion. One would hope that the paths returned by this bit are consistent with what you'd get from finding paths on an actual graph.
- the `_populate_coercion_lists_` world, which more readily corresponds to a graph presentation.

The total coercion graph is supposed to be the union of the two, but the way in which the merger is done seems murky and extremely implementation-dependent to me at the moment (perhaps because the `_coerce_map_from_` world is completely implementation dependent by design).

I think we'd need to clarify the relation between the two a little more, and hopefully formulate some axioms that we can assume the `_coerce_map_from_` world is adhering to before it's wise to further complicate the situation by also implementing backtracking along embeddings.

I think the investigations here are very useful, because I think we are making explicit a lot of implicit facts and assumptions that have been floating around in the coercion system and probably got violated in the organic evolution of the system.

It is perhaps not as bad as it looks. Some of these errors come from weakening of coerce maps, namely: Some of the coerce maps used in doctests were not weakened by #14711, but became weakened now. So, that's trivial to fix.

What is bad is (at least) the crash in permgroup.py, and 11 errors on number fields also sounds like too many...

The new commit changes `CompletionFunctor.commutes(..)`, so that the completion functor only commutes with the `FractionField`, but not with other `CompletionFunctor`s (this is because other completion functors have already been taken care of by `CompletionFunctor.merge(..)`).

Also, it changes `_coerce_map_from_` of number fields according to the previous changes in `EmbeddedNumberFieldMorphism`.

With the current commit, all tests in `sage/rings/number_field/` pass.

FWIW, I have created #15329 and #15331 to deal with the two independent sub-problems. Both need review.

<a id='comment:86'></a>
I have suggested to get both a speed-up and a cleaner behaviour of the backtracking algorithm with respect to "comparison of parents by identity".

Namely, paths in the coerce digraph are currently marked as "already used in backtracking" by the cdef function "_register_pair(x,y,tag)", and the mark is removed by another cdef function "_unregister_pair(x,y,tag)".

In both cases, the functions create an instance of the cdef class `EltPair`, and stores resp. removes it in some dictionary. The instances of `EltPair` are compared by comparing `(x,y,tag)`, and the hash also is obtained in that way.

But that means parents are compared by `==`, whereas in the innards of the coercion system parents (even non-unique parents!) are generally compared by `is`. Moreover, comparison by identity and hash by id would be a lot faster, and creating an instance of `EltPair` each time also is a waste of time.

Couldn't we use a `TripleDict` instead? It would compare by identity, it is about triples `x,y,tag`, and I think we have made tests showing that containment tests and so on are faster than when using a Python dict keyed by triples.

I only worry about the weak references. Could it happen that registered pairs will be automatically removed from the triple dict while backtracking, resulting in an infinite recursion? I guess this can not happen, because the backtracking algorithm will only visit parents that are strongly referenced.

Anyway, I'd say it is worth trying. If it works, then fine. If it doesn't, we can move this to a separate ticket, that will be using a *strong* version of `TripleDict`.

Rather than `TripleDict`, one could also use a set (not a dict) and use `id(X)` for comparison. It would compare the parents in the same way as they are compared in the backtracking (namely by id), *and* it yields a speed-up.

Here is my benchmark. I've put the following into `sage.structure.parent`:

```python
def test_registration(list L):
    _coerce_test_dict.clear()
    for X in L:
        for Y in L:
            _register_pair(X,Y,"test")
            _is_registered_pair(X,Y,"test")
            _is_registered_pair(X,Y,"fail")
    for X in L:
        for Y in L:
            _unregister_pair(X,Y,"test")

from sage.structure.coerce_dict cimport TripleDict
def test_tripledict(list L):
    TestT = TripleDict(29)
    for X in L:
        for Y in L:
            TestT.set(X,Y,"test",1)
            (X,Y,"test") in TestT
            (X,Y,"fail") in TestT
    for X in L:
        for Y in L:
            del TestT[X,Y,"test"]

cdef set testset
def test_set(list L):
    global testset
    testset = set([])
    for X in L:
        for Y in L:
            testset.add((id(X),id(Y),"test"))
            (id(X),id(Y),"test") in testset
            (id(X),id(Y),"fail") in testset
    for X in L:
        for Y in L:
            try:
                testset.remove((id(X),id(Y),"test"))
            except KeyError:
                pass
```
With this, I get

```
sage: L = [GF(p) for p in prime_range(10^4)]
sage: len(L)
1229
sage: from sage.structure.parent import test_registration, test_tripledict, test_set
sage: %time test_registration(L)
CPU times: user 16.75 s, sys: 0.10 s, total: 16.85 s
Wall time: 16.87 s
sage: %time test_tripledict(L)
CPU times: user 45.74 s, sys: 0.62 s, total: 46.36 s
Wall time: 46.44 s
sage: %time test_set(L)
CPU times: user 3.92 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 3.93 s
Wall time: 3.93 s
```

__Conclusion__

It is not a good idea to use a `TripleDict` here (because of speed and because of potential trouble with garbage collection). However, using a set makes sense for two reasons: Speed and consistency of the methods of comparison. And it might be possible to get a further speed-up by doing something like `<long><void*>X` rather than `id(X)`.

            except KeyError:

```
I get a further speed-up:

```
sage: %time test_set2(L)
CPU times: user 3.18 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 3.18 s
Wall time: 3.19 s
```

So, the speed-up we can get for marking/unmarking/testing of arrows in the coerce digraph during backtracking is a factor of about 4.5.

Replying to [SimonKing](#comment%3A92):
> `PyDict_DelItem` is mentioned as well. Smells like problems with a `WeakValueDictionary` such that the callback of a garbage collected value uses a key that is in the process of being garbage collected, too, and thus comparison of the key (which is needed to remove the item from the dictionary) fails.


Compare #13394

I don't think it necessarily is related: this is a conversion and given how liberal conversion is allowed/meant to be, I don't think we can expect convertibility to ever be transitive (I think it will even be path-dependent). As the trace shows, it fails in `sage.rings.integer.Integer.__init__`, i.e., just the integer constructor. I suspect RR has been special-cased there and CC is not (perhaps it should). So, the initializer attempts to see if straight coercion works and of course it doesn't.

I don't think these conversions are going to be terribly useful anyway:

```
sage: ZZ(49*RR(1/49))
TypeError: Attempt to coerce non-integral RealNumber to Integer

WTF??

I see the same merge conflict. So, I try "git mergetool", which (for my setup) means that "meld" is started to help me resolve conflict.

From looking at it, the two versions of weak_dict.pyx look *identical*! Nevertheless both the local and the remote version of the file are all marked red in meld, i.e., they are in 100% conflict.

Sorry, but if this is a feature of git then I must say that it sucks.

Do they? To me it looks like the version in `trac/master` is more recent. (Do `git diff :2:src/sage/misc/weak_dict.pyx :3:src/sage/misc/weak_dict.pyx` to see the diff between the two versions without taking into account the—empty—common ancestor.) Just in cas it helps, I pushed a merge based on this assumption to `u/mmezzarobba/ticket/15303`.

Meanwhile I found that they differ.

Usually, the mergetool I am using (meld) just shows me the differences and lets me decide which to take. However, this time, meld gave me the impression that the two versions differ by 100%. It did not even show a single line which is common to both versions. And that's clearly wrong.

It is. There also is another file with conflicts (sage/schemes/generic/morphism.py)

> Just in cas it helps, I pushed a merge based on this assumption to `u/mmezzarobba/ticket/15303`.


Thank you. How to access it (with either git or the dev scripts)?

It depends a little bit on your setup, but something like

```
git fetch trac u/mmezzarobba/ticket/15303
git checkout u/mmezzarobba/ticket/15303 -m mybranch
```

(or `git merge --ff-only u/mmezzarobba/ticket/15303` if you are already on your ticket branch and want to add the merge commit to that branch) should work.

Please check that what I did is really what you had in mind!

`git diff HEAD^2` gives you all the differences between one of the parents (in our case, `master`) and HEAD, without taking into account the other parent at all. To see the effect of a merge, you can try viewing the "combined diff" of HEAD and both parents (`git show HEAD`). But this will omit all files that agree entirely with *either* of the parents. Also, the output will include the parts of the merge that were automatically resolved.

All I did manually was to choose the version of `morphism.pyx` that looked more recent, and to merge the imports of `morphism.py` as follows:

```
 -from sage.categories.homset   import Homset
 +from sage.categories.homset   import Homset, Hom
- from sage.rings.all           import is_RingHomomorphism, is_CommutativeRing, 
+ from sage.rings.all           import Integer
+ from sage.rings.commutative_ring import is_CommutativeRing

I see. So, you took the version of `src/sage/misc/weak_dictionary.pyx` from master, and ...

I have not even been aware that this has changed. So, someone has made morphisms that are defined by generator images hashable? Nice!

Didn't you also do something with `src/sage/combinat/ncsf_qsym/ncsf.py`?

Anyway, the output of `git show HEAD` looks good to me. So, I will try `make ptest` now. Is "crash in pergroup.py" still an issue? We will see...

Same problem in `sage -t src/sage/schemes/projective/projective_point.py`.

And I guess the other errors should rather be fixed at #14711, because they are about "weakened coerce maps".

Since #14711 has changed, I have merged the new commits from there.

And I have included Marc's master merge.

Doctests pass for me.
