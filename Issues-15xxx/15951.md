`sage/algebras/quatalg/quaternion_algebra.py`

has in line 988 the (hopefully) last string exception (I found no other):

`raise "base field must be rational numbers or number field"`.

These have been deprecated since long.
They not accepted be Python 3.

**Keywords:** python3, exception, raise

So the patch is fine for me.
