`sage/algebras/quatalg/quaternion_algebra.py`

has in line 988 the (hopefully) last string exception (I found no other):

`raise "base field must be rational numbers or number field"`.

These have been deprecated since long.
They not accepted be Python 3.

Keywords: **python3, exception, raise**

I had selected `TypeError` after looking at the other raise statements in this module. But `ValueError` is nearly as good :-)
