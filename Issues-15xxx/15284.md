As reported by Jernej, the `GRBenv ** env` structure is allocated but not freed on `__dealloc___`. That's fixed here !

There was also a problem with the ``.copy()`` function of gurobi which should have been cpdef. It wasn't, and doctests did not pass. I don't get how we missed that `:-/`

Hello!

The patch is good just a short question - why do we need to check if it is NULL?

Ahahaha. Don't really know. Just used to checking that before freeing memory `:-)`

This being said, I just checled the doc and it explicitly says that `env` should only be freed after the model has been freed :
http://www.gurobi.com/documentation/5.6/reference-manual/c_grbfreeenv

Also, there was some "weird" memory leak, which this patch now fixes : in order to define a model you need to define a "master environment", and the model creates a copy of the "master environment", and that copy is the one you should work on. However, if you delete the master environment segfault follows.

So. This patch creates a "master environment" variable to STORE the temporary environment that was never deallocated. Everything then is done on the real environment, and when everything is done both environment are deallocated. Without checks for NULL, as it has been checked before, when the environment were created.

Weird behaviour, but branch updated ! `;-)`

Nathann

P.S. : Oh, and I also replace `** model` by `* model`. Makes the code simpler `:-P`
