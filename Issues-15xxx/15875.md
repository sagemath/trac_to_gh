You don't have to say `Poset(DiGraph({1:[2,3],2:[4],3:[4]}))`, just `Poset({1:[2,3],2:[4],3:[4]})`.

See also #16892, it relates to this one. I think that you can look the code of it for you.

This was an answer to different question... (on sage-devel). To clarify, here is another example of `is_sub*`-function:

```
r1=2.0-1.0
r2=3.0-1.0
i1=1
i2=2
{i1, i2}.issubset({r1, r2})
```

This also outputs `True`. Hence it seems that `Poset({r1:[r2]}).is_subposet(Poset({i1:[i2]}))` should also return `True`. But I would like someone to confirm this.

Ideally, we would need a dense representation for Q's transitive closure and a sparse representation of P.

"depends". It means a copy of Q's graph even if `P` is only one vertex. In other cases it will be optimal.

> I am not sure if I can make faster version by manually calling digraph functions in a loop. But of course it is much faster to get `False` if some element of `P` is not an element of `Q` at all by first checking for that. But will `transitive_closure())` eat memory?

It will eat some memory indeed, but it will be freed then. Ideally, we would need a dense representation for Q's transitive closure and a sparse representation of P. We can iterate over all edges of `P`, and check every time that it is an edge of Q's transitive closure.

The most costly part of it will probably be the vertex labelling.

Done this as an oneline-wrapper. I think that faster versions are easier to do when we already have a docstring and maybe see how this will be used.

I cannot say that I agree with you, though there is a mistake in the note. The first sentence should be changed to: "This method does not check whether the poset is *isomorphic* to a subposet of ``other``, but only if [...]".

> (and the `is_subgraph` and "induced" in graph theory might carry a slightly different meaning than I'm used to when looking at posets)

The meaning is the same. Though this function should *not* check by default that it is an *induced* subposet. It should check whether it is a subposet, e.g.: the antichain is a subposet of any poset with the same elements.

Futhermore:

```
sage: A = posets.ChainPoset(5)
sage: A.is_subposet(A)
False
```

Travis, should it then be something like

```
Return ``True`` if the poset is a subposet of ``other``, and ``False`` otherwise.

A Poset `P` is an (induced) subposet of `Q` if every element of `P` is an element of `Q`,
and `x \le_P y` iff `x \le_Q y`.
```

? And then continue with `NOTE`-block and examples?

You should add some more examples contrasting the two methods. In particular, one where the `subposet` returns `False` as the isomorphism one returns `True`. Also you have some `$` in the docstring.

I think because they are the same elements and because facade is more specific to use in Sage, we should have the subposet not depend on being a facade.

> I suspect that they see it as a "feature".

OK. I'll forget that. Another thing: Why `Poset({1:[2]}).subposet([3])` gives error message "ValueError: <type 'sage.rings.integer.Integer'> is not an element of this poset"?

I made a blind commit, have no machine to test it just now. Going to continue tomorrow.

> What about naming it `.is_induced_subposet`? That would clear any doubt.

This is one possibility. I am just wondering about existing `is_subgraph()` and planned `is_sublattice()`; naming convention should be unified. Also this definition is logical in a sense that from `Q=P.subposet(...whatever...)` you will always get `Q.is_subset(P)` returning `True`.

The link ​http://www.combinatorics.org/ojs/index.php/eljc/article/download/v16i1r142/pdf seems to talk about isomorphic subposets.

Maybe we should write `.extensions()` and have `.is_weak_subposet()` be a poset that is induced subposet of some extension? That is the terminology used by *Enumerative Combinatorics*.

Travis, comments? At least I must think over a night about this.

Hello Jori,

I do not understand the point of the line `if not hasattr(other, 'hasse_diagram'):`. Given that you call `subposet` and `.hasse_diagram` on `other` anyway your code will raise an exception whenever those methods are not available.

As you wish, changed that.

Now `P.is_induced_subposet('junk')` will say `AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute '_is_facade'`. A slightly confusing to a user, but should not be that hard to track the error.

Hello Jori,

As you seem to care about this message, I pused a commit at public/15875 that will raise a slightly more meaningful error message when the input is bad. Add it if you like it, ignore it if you do not.

The probability of users giving this function bad input would be much lower if the function you add had an 'INPUT' section explaining what exactly it expects.

Thanks. Added that.

Hmm... Maybe I should go through functions and add `INPUT` sections.

This patch contains a non-relating line that corrects an indentation bug in `dilworth_decomposition()`. OK to add here?

Yo,

> Hmm... Maybe I should go through functions and add `INPUT` sections.

Could you add one at least in this function that you add here?

> This patch contains a non-relating line that corrects an indentation bug in `dilworth_decomposition()`. OK to add here?

No prob.

About the commit: [please do not change anything as it is not important], but notice that instead of adding my commit on your branch (with cherry-pick, for instance) you apparently applied the changes manually (or did something else that I cannot guess), which has as a side-effect that you became the committer+author of my changes.

Please don't change anything as it is not important, I am just giving you a side-effect of the procedure you followed to use my commit.
