This was an answer to different question... (on sage-devel). To clarify, here is another example of `is_sub*`-function:

```
r1=2.0-1.0
r2=3.0-1.0
i1=1
i2=2
{i1, i2}.issubset({r1, r2})
```

This also outputs `True`. Hence it seems that `Poset({r1:[r2]}).is_subposet(Poset({i1:[i2]}))` should also return `True`. But I would like someone to confirm this.

I cannot say that I agree with you, though there is a mistake in the note. The first sentence should be changed to: "This method does not check whether the poset is *isomorphic* to a subposet of ``other``, but only if [...]".

> (and the `is_subgraph` and "induced" in graph theory might carry a slightly different meaning than I'm used to when looking at posets)


The meaning is the same. Though this function should *not* check by default that it is an *induced* subposet. It should check whether it is a subposet, e.g.: the antichain is a subposet of any poset with the same elements.

Futhermore:

```
sage: A = posets.ChainPoset(5)
sage: A.is_subposet(A)
False
```

Hmmm... Well, the first two papers I got by typing subposet in google say differently.

Done.

?? First example is already like that. `Q.has_isomorphic_subposet(P)` returns `True`. Removed `$`.

OK. This patch fixes it to other direction, but needs more work:

```
sage: P = Poset({1:[2]}, facade=True)
sage: Q = Poset({1:[2]}, facade=False)
sage: P.is_subposet(Q)
True
sage: Q.is_subposet(P)

Uh... Should we open a ticket from this? I guess this it because `__contains__()`. But I have no idea about how to correct it. Basically this is because

```

<a id='comment:50'></a>How about this? At least now this adds a new functionality to Sagemath, and it could be later expanded to non-facade posets.

Not in needs_review, as I am still compiling this myself.

This is one possibility. I am just wondering about existing `is_subgraph()` and planned `is_sublattice()`; naming convention should be unified. Also this definition is logical in a sense that from `Q=P.subposet(...whatever...)` you will always get `Q.is_subset(P)` returning `True`.

The link ​http://www.combinatorics.org/ojs/index.php/eljc/article/download/v16i1r142/pdf seems to talk about isomorphic subposets.

Maybe we should write `.extensions()` and have `.is_weak_subposet()` be a poset that is induced subposet of some extension? That is the terminology used by *Enumerative Combinatorics*.

Travis, comments? At least I must think over a night about this.

As you wish, changed that.

Now `P.is_induced_subposet('junk')` will say `AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute '_is_facade'`. A slightly confusing to a user, but should not be that hard to track the error.

<a id='comment:66'></a>Hello Jori,

As you seem to care about this message, I pused a commit at public/15875 that will raise a slightly more meaningful error message when the input is bad. Add it if you like it, ignore it if you do not.

The probability of users giving this function bad input would be much lower if the function you add had an 'INPUT' section explaining what exactly it expects.

Thanks. Added that.

Hmm... Maybe I should go through functions and add `INPUT` sections.

This patch contains a non-relating line that corrects an indentation bug in `dilworth_decomposition()`. OK to add here?

<a id='comment:69'></a>Yo,

Could you add one at least in this function that you add here?

> This patch contains a non-relating line that corrects an indentation bug in `dilworth_decomposition()`. OK to add here?


No prob.

About the commit: [please do not change anything as it is not important], but notice that instead of adding my commit on your branch (with cherry-pick, for instance) you apparently applied the changes manually (or did something else that I cannot guess), which has as a side-effect that you became the committer+author of my changes.

Please don't change anything as it is not important, I am just giving you a side-effect of the procedure you followed to use my commit.
