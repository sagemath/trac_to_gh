The aim is to fix the following problem.

```
sage: from sage.categories.pushout import pushout
sage: pushout(Qp(7),RLF)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
RuntimeError: maximum recursion depth exceeded while calling a Python object
```

This boils down to change how `CompletionFunctor` (which is a type of construction functors used both for `RLF` and `Qp(7)`) commutes with other construction functors. Currently, it commutes with the fraction field functor *and* with other completion functors. But in fact it is simply not true that construction functors commute.
