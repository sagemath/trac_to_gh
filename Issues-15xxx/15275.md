This was first reported on [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19344741/python-sage-attach-from-command-line-and-run-another-command).

While running Sage:

```
sage: attach("file.sage"); print 3
```
works, but from the shell:

```
$ sage -c "attach('file.sage'); print 3"
```
fails. It actually tries to execute the command

```
sage "/path/to/'file.sage'; print Integer(2)"
```
and so it tries to read everything between the first and last quotes as the file name, thus producing the error

```
python: can't open file '/path/to/'file.sage'; print Integer(2)': [Errno 2] No such file or directory
```
This is because the script `sage-eval` tries to do something clever when the command to be executed starts with `attach` or `load`, but it is assuming that the rest of the command consists entirely of the file name.

Problem was introduced by #508.
Since I couldn't find an answer why `./sage -c "attach file.sage"` was supposed to work, I suggest to revert the changes made in #508.
