<a id='comment:20'></a>Hi Travis,

There are still some things that need to be changed with the multipartition model and the multisegment model. Some highlights:

- The Kleschev multipartition model and the JMMO multipartition model are closely related; perhaps both should be on the same ticket.  Moreover, the display of these partitions should include the residues in cells of the partitions so that the charge of the partition is clear to the user (though maybe you have added this already after we talked a while back).

- There are two well-known crystal structures on multisegments, and they are related by the star-crystal operators.  The convention being used should be clear and probably even the star-crystal operators should be added.  In particular, see the 2009 paper by Jacon and Lecouvey in Pac. J. Math.  It is my personal opinion that the notation and structure of that paper is the one that should be followed for the implementation, including changing the data structure of the multisegments to use dictionaries of the form `{(interval) : coefficient}`.  

I vaguely remember there being some additional changes, too, but I can't be more specific until I have time to delve deeper into the patch.

Best,
Ben
