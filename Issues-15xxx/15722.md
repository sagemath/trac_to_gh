> The space before the -1 was meant to align it with the values above, but it does not matter.

FYI: that was not a source-code cosmetic change, it broke the RST parsing, the content in a list needs to be aligned, it doesn't care whether that content is positive or negative, or even a number.


> Thanks for this fix `:-)`

You're welcome. (Thank *you* for your work on the whole numerical module.)


> (please fill in your real name in the Author field)

Done
