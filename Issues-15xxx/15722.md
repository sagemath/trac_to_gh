FYI: that was not a source-code cosmetic change, it broke the RST parsing, the content in a list needs to be aligned, it doesn't care whether that content is positive or negative, or even a number.


> Thanks for this fix `:-)`


You're welcome. (Thank *you* for your work on the whole numerical module.)
