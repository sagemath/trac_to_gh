I've compiled sage in `/local/data/krenn/sage-dev/sage-6.1.1` and then moved it to another directory. I am getting the following when testing sage:

```
File "src/sage/dev/test/config.py", line 43, in sage.dev.test.config.DoctestConfig
Failed example:
    DoctestConfig()
Expected:
    Config('''

    repository_anonymous = remote_repository_undefined
    repository = remote_repository_undefined
    src = ...
    dot_git = ...
    [sagedev]
    ''')
Got:

```
There are a couple of other files with similar warnings.

How do you compile sage after this?

```
sage --dev checkout --ticket 15901
sage -btp --long src/sage/dev
```
does not work.

Even the following doesn't work

```
cp {src,local}/bin/sage-env
sage -btp --long src/sage/dev
```

You have to touch the `src/sage/dev/[test/]` Python files (or remove their `.pyc` files).

(I *think*.)

The patchbot instance is now getting doctest failures in `sage/plot/plot.py`:

```

The directory it is looking in is where my *other* Sage copy was before moving that copy to test this ticket!

This really deserves its own ticket (and btw. is pretty unrelated to relocating Sage; just imagine having different versions of Sage running at the same time).

IMHO Sage's matplotlib must not put its cache into `$HOME` (if at all, it should be in `$DOT_SAGE/.cache/...`), and it should somehow be versioned (with matplotlib's and/or Sage's version in the folder name).

Well, setting up MPL's config dir based on its version in `sage-env` in turn can indeed break upon relocation... :-)

(as it calls Python before `sage-location` is called, and the Python interpreter may try to load libraries that have moved, as I already mentioned elsewhere).

I'm getting

```
.../local/bin/python: error while loading shared libraries: libpython2.7.so.1.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
```

So apparently `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` isn't set up properly to that time.

I guess the `MPLCONFIGDIR`-relevant part of `sage-env` should be moved down to a point where all required setting up has been done.
