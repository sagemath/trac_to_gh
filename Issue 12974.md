By the way, here's a good reason to disallow tabs in `.rst` files.  When scanning a comment block, a tab character counts as one space, meaning that the indentation level can drop enough to end the comment block, even if in a text editor it looks just fine.  Debugging this just took me a half hour.  :-)
