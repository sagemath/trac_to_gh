It is incredibly confusing for most people to install the jsmath fonts.  Morever, that they must download them off an external site is terrible -- what if they install Sage on an internal network or laptop with no net access, and need the fonts.  The fonts should be included in Sage, and the "you should install the jsmath fonts" warning should be much nicer and directly give a link to the fonts.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/1608
