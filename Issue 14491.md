# Issue 14491: Don't (re)run ranlib in sage-location

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/14695

Original creator: leif

Original creation time: 2013-06-06 07:17:06

Assignee: GeorgSWeber

Keywords: relocation

Doing so is useless and only wastes (potentially a lot of) time.
