I have nothing invested in how symbolics and series interact, but I see some immediate problems that would arise from subclassing Expression for a Series type:
- when does a SymbolicSeries expression get created? The problem is that the SymbolicRing by itself is a rather untyped environment, so how do you know that an object needs to be made in this specialized class
- How do SymbolicSeries in different variables interact, e.g.:

```
F = (1/(x+1))*y+sin(x)*y^2+O(y^3)
G = (y/(y^2-2)*x + cos(y)*x^2 +O(x^3)
F+G
```

Is the result a series? If so, in which variable(s)? One solution would be a SymbolicSeriesRing as a parent, which declares in what variables the series are. I suspect this would be nearly useless for whatever problem the current design tries to solve, though.

Nils, this is not about creating a ring but simple refactoring. No behaviour change.

OK, I thought that `f.is_series()` would do some non-trivial logic to see if `f` can be used as a series, but it's just exposing a flag that is held internally somewhere. You could indeed expose that information in the type instead, but with ducktyping, subtyping and sage's parent infrastructure doing so might not be as convenient as it might be in systems that are really governed by explicit types. You'd need to think if this refactoring actually will help for further development.

Indeed, being a "series" seems a rather fickle property. It doesn't seem to be preserved under anything:


```
sage: var('x,y');
sage: f=cos(y).series(y,10)
sage: g=sin(x).series(x,10)
sage: var('x,y');
sage: f=cos(y).series(y,10)
sage: g=sin(x).series(x,10)
sage: f.is_series()
True
sage: (f+f).is_series()
False
sage: (-f).is_series()
False
sage: (f+g).series(x,10)
Order(1)
```

The last result probably follows from interpreting the `Order(x^10)` term in `g` as an order term in `y`, and hence equivalent to `Order(y^0)`.

Hello,

The ticket looks good.

1. Why do you need all these include

```
include "sage/ext/interrupt.pxi"
include "sage/ext/stdsage.pxi"
include "sage/ext/cdefs.pxi"
include "sage/ext/python.pxi"
```

  As far as I saw you are using none of them.

2. You should fix your mind

```
... about 0, about `1` ...
```

   Either ``0`` and ``1`` or `0` and `1`.

3. In the example, instead of `float(expr)` could you use `numerical_approx(expr)`?

4. You should not put `self` as an argument of a method (you did it in `truncate`). Moreover, it is better to avoid `self` in the documentation. Always prefer `this expression` or `this object`.

5. In `coefficients`, the argument `sparse` is not documented in the `INPUT` section

6. In `coefficients`, you should replace `if sparse is True` by `if sparse`.
