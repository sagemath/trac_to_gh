Using sympy 0.7.6 (with external mpmath) with sage-on-gentoo since 2014-11-26. No real problems to report. I have a couple of doctests where order of terms is reversed that may come from this.

Surprisingly sympy already depends on mpmath which I was concerned was missing from this commit. But all is well.
