Ticket retargeted after milestone closed (if you don't believe this ticket is appropriate for the Sage 8.8 release please retarget manually)

Moving tickets from the Sage 8.8 milestone that have been actively worked on in the last six months to the next release milestone (optimistically).

I don't remember why I removed #27364 from the dependencies. The branch is still on top of that ticket's branch. May it can be rebased away from it?
