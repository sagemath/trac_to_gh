Here's a version that succeeds in installing `pyright` (in the toxenv). But then testing does not work because it also needs to import sage.

You don't have to install pyright manually for use in vscode, its done via the pylance extension (providing such a seamless integration with vs code was one of the reasons why pyright is written in ts).

Thanks for the update.

With the current config, `tox -e pyright` still uses the `venv` symlink to resolve imports etc. Wouldn't it be more in the spirit of tox to install sagelib in the tox env and use that as a reference for imports? 

For example, without a properly setup `venv`, `tox -e pyright` for example complains

```
  /workspace/sagetrac-mirror/src/sage/manifolds/subsets/pullback.py:302:22 - warning: Import "ppl" could not be resolved (reportMissingImports)
  /workspace/sagetrac-mirror/src/sage/manifolds/subsets/pullback.py:827:26 - warning: Import "ppl" could not be resolved (reportMissingImports)
```

These are not displayed if `venv` is setup correctly.

Also, why do you need `SAGE_LOCAL` for pyright/in the tox env?

```

That config is also highly confusing, and took me quite some time to understand.

`venvPath` is the path where all venv's are supposed to be, and `venv` is then a path relative to this path selecting a certain venv.
So with `venvPath = /home/venvs` and `venv = ./a`, the venv is supposed to be in `/home/venvs/a`.

The code explains this better then the docs:
https://github.com/microsoft/pyright/blob/fa4194fd8b0e6d9fb970468e50a974e0d4eeee5c/packages/pyright-internal/src/analyzer/pythonPathUtils.ts#L72-L73

So I guess you only have to set venvPath in the cli to the tox venv, and everything should work.
