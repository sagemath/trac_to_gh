# Issue 11574: Unify the definition of "monomial", introduce "term"

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/11746

Keywords: sd32

Consider:


```
    sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
    sage: S.<u,v> = QQ[]
    sage: f = 2*x
    sage: g = 2*u
    sage: f.is_monomial()
    True
    sage: g.is_monomial()
    False
```


According to Wikipedia, there are two conventions on the matter, and we should support both.  I propose that we accept neither `f` nor `g` as monomials, and add the method `is_term`:


```
    sage: f.is_monomial()
    False
    sage: g.is_monomial()
    False
    sage: f.is_term()
    True
    sage: g.is_term()
    True
```

This dup surely wouldn't happen if we were sitting right next to each other (which we are)! :-)
