- doc test failures

```
sage -t --random-seed=304862427901863394857029643453589442307 src/sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_element.pyx  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t --random-seed=304862427901863394857029643453589442307 src/sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_libsingular.pyx  # 2 doctests failed
```



- line 5499 need blank line after INPUT in libsinglar.pyx

- add an example demonstrating that the result is independent of scaling


- I thought you were going to add the function so that this works for QQbar?

I squashed your commits down to one and added the ticket number. I also added some documentation and fixed the QQbar code.

Thanks to Alex, with his help, we have provided Number Field and `prec` examples for various height functions in all three files.
