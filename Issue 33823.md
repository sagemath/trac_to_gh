- doc test failures

```
sage -t --random-seed=304862427901863394857029643453589442307 src/sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_element.pyx  # 1 doctest failed

```



- line 5499 need blank line after INPUT in libsinglar.pyx

- add an example demonstrating that the result is independent of scaling


- I thought you were going to add the function so that this works for QQbar?
