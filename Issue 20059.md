If one has to solve a small LP with irrational (say, AA) data (and needs access to the exact solution), the only available tool is the didactical implementation of the simplex method in `InteractiveLPProblem` (but see #18735). This ticket implements a `MixedIntegerLinearProgram` backend using `InteractiveLPProblem`.

Needs review.

Some remarks:
- I'm using some _internals of `InteractiveLPProblem` (`_constraint_types`, `_variable_types`, `_problem_type`, `_is_negative`) because some accessor methods are missing. Should I be adding them?
- There's should be a way to choose the base ring for the solver (right now I'm using AA -- but ultimately I'd like to use an embedded number field), but I'm not sure about the interface... perhaps  ` MixedIntegerLinearProgram(solver=('InteractiveLP', AA)) ` or `MixedIntegerLinearProgram(solver='InteractiveLP', base_ring=AA`

I think so - the reason they are missing is that they were never needed before. Using guts directly makes sense inside of ILLP itself, but now that you have a dependent module there has to be documented and tested way to access them.

`base_ring=AA` seems to be more common (and I think it is common to use `ring` even when only field would really make sense).

I've added these accessor methods and changed my code to use them.
Two more things regarding `InteractiveLPProblem`:
- I think `InteractiveLPProblem.standard_form` should allow the user to pass names for the slack variables
- It would be nice if `InteractiveLPProblem`would support an additive constant in the objective function (see `obj_constant_term` in my code)

Regarding `problem_type` method - why do you add minus there? It seems to me that your old code was not adding it so either it was wrong or it is wrong now. And for the method itself I think it makes more sense to return just `self._problem_type` as is and mention in documentation that there is also `is_negative` method and they need to be used together.

Passing through parameters to the constructor would make sense. And adding a constant to non-standard form would be handy. Let me work on it today actually and take a break from digging in JavaScript!

Also, it would be nice if someone closer to LP backends did the full review of this ticket.

OK, I've changed it. 
For my code, it does not make any difference because I don't construct "-max" or "-min" problems. 
I only have to deal with `is_negative` once, for the standard-form problem that is created while solving.

Yes, I'm hoping that someone on the Cc list could take a look...

By the way, the `interactive_simplex_method` code should probably check for variable-name clashes between auto-generated and user-supplied variable names. It gets quite confused, for example, when a variable named "x0" is introduced because it thinks it is the primal-phase-1 auxiliary variable.

I think everything and a little more but name clashes are implemented in #20311.

Regarding variable names, it is sort of by design that auxiliary variable can be one of the decision ones - that's how auxiliary problems are distinguished. It may not be the best choice but changing it should be done carefully. In all other cases name clashes should throw errors and users are responsible for either adjusting their choices or overriding defaults to avoid conflict.

anyway, that `p.get_values(x)` ought to be fixed, perhaps on another ticket. By now you can still make this ticket depend on #20301, and give the above (without `p.get_values(x)`) as a doctest. 
Or perhaps you know a workaround to get the values regardless?

#20311 implements going back from the standard form, so will allow to address this problem.

Until #20301 and #20311 are merged into develop, I will modify the test with algebraic numbers as follows so you can see the solution vector, using backend methods:

```
            sage: poly = polytopes.dodecahedron(base_ring=AA)
            sage: lp = poly.to_linear_program(solver='InteractiveLP')
            sage: b = lp.get_backend()
            sage: for k in range(3): b.variable_lower_bound(k, 0)
            sage: b.set_objective([1, 1, 1])
            sage: lp.solve()
