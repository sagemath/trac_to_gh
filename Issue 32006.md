In #29413 we're waiting mainly on gfan. There is no obvious way to submit things upstream, so we should just patch it finally. The spkg-configure.m4 for cddlib is looking for headers in the wrong location which, ironically, prevents the system gfan from being used.

We already insist on >=cddlib-094m which puts the headers in a `cddlib/` subdirectory. All we should need to do for the gfan package at this point is `sed 's/cdd/cddlib/g'`. Afterwards we can have the spkg-configure.m4 for cddlib look in the right place (right now it's guaranteed to reject any vanilla system installations).

I'm build testing a patch already...
