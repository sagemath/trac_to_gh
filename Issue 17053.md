# Issue 17053: Fix a typo in Linear Programming thematic tutorial

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/17290

The first example of the "Linear Programming" thematic tutorial deals with maximizing `x+yâˆ’3z` and actually maximizes `x+y+3z`, sometimes causing troubles to newcomers.

Good to go ! Thanks for the patch.

1) Could you fill the "authors" field ?
2) Do you know that we can create a LP from the matrix of constraints now ? `:-)`


```
sage: p = MixedIntegerLinearProgram()
sage: m = identity_matrix(3)
sage: x = p.new_variable(nonnegative=True)
sage: p.add_constraint(m*x<=2)
sage: p.show()
Maximization:
 
Constraints:
  x_0 <= 2.0
  x_1 <= 2.0
  x_2 <= 2.0
Variables:
  x_0 is a continuous variable (min=0.0, max=+oo)
  x_1 is a continuous variable (min=0.0, max=+oo)
  x_2 is a continuous variable (min=0.0, max=+oo)
```

Yep, i have followed that improvement, perhaps could we add this trick somewhere in the tutorial as well (in another ticket).
