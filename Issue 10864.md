For example:

```
sage: Sigma = Fan(rays=[(1,1,0), (1,-1,0)], cones=[(0,1)])
sage: Sigma_prime = FaceFan(lattice_polytope.octahedron(3))
sage: FanMorphism(identity_matrix(3), Sigma, Sigma_prime, subdivide=True, verbose=True)
Placing ray images... 0.841 ms
Computing chambers... 0.806 ms
Subdividing cone 1 of 1... 0.172 ms
Checking for missing pieces... 
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
IndexError: list assignment index out of range
```
The problem is that the source cone intersects four target ones, but there are only two different intersections. I will post a fix soon.

OK, I rewrote related code to make it a little more clear, but basically I just added check for repeated intersections.
