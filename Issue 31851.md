For example: `tox -e docker-centos-7-i386-standard gfan` never seems to terminate.

To check, use `tox -e docker-centos-7-i386-standard gfan-build-deps`, then run the built image with Docker.  Then `make gfan` builds the package and hangs in the testsuite after printing:

```

It might be a problem on our side somehow. I did not run my 32 build machinery for 2 years, and at those times, it seems `gfan` selftests passed without issue.

Also, note that at the beginning of the self-tests, there is some:

I emailed jensen (email from https://math.au.dk/~jensen/software/gfan/gfan.html) on nov 21 but I never received a reply.

The bug is also fixed in debian https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=974558 and void linux https://github.com/void-linux/void-packages/pull/34182.
