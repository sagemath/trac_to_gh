Ah, this is just what came out of sws2rst, I don't think I was more than dimly aware of that.

Why don't you take a look at the rest of the content or whatever (pass doctests?) and once you have all things to fix, I'll do them all at once.

Thanks for the review, very helpful.  

As it happens, the author actually always spells her name without capital letters, so I'll change that when I get around to fixing the Schlegel piece - I think it's the `show()` that is deprecated, not the projection.  In fact, this was apparently not doctested at #16625

```
+    def show(self, *args, **kwds):

+        deprecation(16625, 'use Projection.plot instead')
+        return self.plot(*args, **kwds)
```
so I may need to fix that as well for this ticket.
