This is a first-time contributor, so in this case any suggestions about formatting etc. would be best handled by just continuing the branch.

Also, I didn't do a lot of editing here, but did remove references to images since they were standard plots, so there may be some Sphinx issues - but I hope not.

There are still some very minor Sphinx things about a link and the toc tree but I think a review is still in order, as they can be dealt with after content.

Could you please use the new style of doctest continuation, namely `....:` instead of `...`  ?

Ah, this is just what came out of sws2rst, I don't think I was more than dimly aware of that.

Why don't you take a look at the rest of the content or whatever (pass doctests?) and once you have all things to fix, I'll do them all at once.

Hello,

I made a reviewer commit. There remains a problem with the schlegel projection (near then end) which is deprecated. This needs to be changed.

Thanks for the review, very helpful.  

As it happens, the author actually always spells her name without capital letters, so I'll change that when I get around to fixing the Schlegel piece - I think it's the `show()` that is deprecated, not the projection.  In fact, this was apparently not doctested at #16625

```
+    def show(self, *args, **kwds):
+        from sage.misc.superseded import deprecation
+        deprecation(16625, 'use Projection.plot instead')
+        return self.plot(*args, **kwds)
```

so I may need to fix that as well for this ticket.

Okay, this commit should take care of the docs; I assume they look fine built, no other missing double colons or something?  Thanks for catching the LaTeX things!

I will do one more commit to add the doctest that should have been added before.

I'm capitalizing the author's name, let me know if your real name uses the lower-case spelling...


---

Resolution: fixed

Yes, hers [definitely does](http://toroidalsnark.net/)!
