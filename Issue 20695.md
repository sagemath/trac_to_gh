In `p1list`, one finds different code depending on the size of the level. For levels in this range, the relevant subroutine is `p1list_llong`, which contains:

```
    cmax = N/2
    if N%2:   # N odd, max divisor is <= N/3
        if N%5:  # N not a multiple of 3 either, max is N/5
            cmax = N/5
        else:
            cmax = N/3
```

but `N%5` should be `N%3`.

Re issue 2: the offending subroutine in `p1list` appears to be `c_p1_normalize_llong`, in which one finds:

```
    if compute_s:
        ss[0] = <int> (arith_llong.c_inverse_mod_longlong(s*min_t, N) % ll_N)

As written, this creates a 32-bit integer overflow. It should be:

```
    if compute_s:
        ss[0] = <int> (arith_llong.c_inverse_mod_longlong((<llong> s)*(<llong> min_t), N) % ll_N)

Sadly no, this is precisely a bug that occurs only for large problem sizes (see comment 1), so any doctest that actually tests it will have to deal with large problems. Is it okay if all of the doctests that confirm the resolution of this issue are optional?
