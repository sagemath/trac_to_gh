Keywords: gomory-hu tree gomory hu

The virtual (fake) vertex g2_v is added to g1, even though I think it makes alot more sense to add it to g2.

As far as I know, it does not create bugs or incorrect results, as add_edge adds the vertex if it does not exist, but it would seem rather unfavourable to keep such an error existent.

This fix is redundant as I fixed it immediately when fixing ticket #16475. Can thus be closed or removed, or anything the likes.
