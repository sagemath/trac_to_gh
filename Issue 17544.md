# Issue 17544: No trivial way to find out if a digraph has (directed) cycles?

Keywords: graphs, acyclic,

I have a `DiGraph` and I want to know if it is acyclic. But I see no simpler way than running `all_cycles_iterator().next()` and catching a `StopIteration` exception. Am I being stupid or is this a usability failure?

If you have a question related to Sage, you can ask them on [ask.sagemath.org](http://ask.sagemath.org) instead of opening a ticket!
