It has been reported by Damian Bogdanowicz on sage-devel [1] that the interval graph recognition agorithm returns a wrong result:


```
sage: Graph('GvGNp?').is_interval()
True
```


This graph is not an interval graph as it contains an asteroidal triple (1,5,7).

The fix is rather short: some 'partial' pq-trees were handled like 'full' ones and that was wrong. As an additional check, we get the expected [2] number of interval graphs up to n=9:

P.S.: The class, however, could definitely benefit from a more general rewrite. Another ticket (already half-written) will adress that and make the documentation and method names more explicit.
