# Issue 21026: Poset: additions to is_eulerian()

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: jmantysalo

Original creation time: 2016-08-17 10:04:37

This patch will 1) slightly speed up computing `is_eulerian()`, 2) make it possible to check if a poset is (only) k-eulerian for some integer k, 3) get a "certificate" of non-eulerianity, i.e. endpoints of a non-eulerian interval and 4) add `star_product()`. The last logically belongs to this IMO, as it is mostly used for generating a new Eulerian poset.

It is logically possible to define this for `P` and `Q` if `P` has top and `Q` has bottom. However, this implementation requires both to have both bottom and top. On the other hand this does not check if a poset is graded.

Those done.

There are some "eulerian" that should take a capital.

Do you have a reference for testing only even ranks differences ?

Those corrected. I don't know if I should write "k-Eulerian" or "k-eulerian"; Volker said that english is not consistent on that.

For example EC in pages 453-454 exercise 174c indirectly says that. For a paper see abstract of http://www.ms.uky.edu/~jrge/Papers/k-Eulerian.pdf

ok, looks good. Please add a reference to the Ehrenborg article, and then you can set to positive.
