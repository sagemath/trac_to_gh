# Issue 17397: Rephrase the 'sage manuals' section of the developer manual

Issue created by migration from Trac.

As for the previous tickets, this branch is meant to make it easier to browse through. Shorter sentences, links, bold text.

This branch also moved (without changing anything) the tutorial on 'How to turn a sws file into a rst file' as it is not about Sage's internal documentation.

I also fixed the documentation about 'how to add a file to the doc', as the example used the combinat/ folder which since #16256 has a different procedure for that.

I've been away from computer all day and don't have time to look at this in detail, but if you _really_ think that moving the sws2rst thing out is a good idea, there had better be a link to wherever you move it to in the developer guide.  The reason that document even exists is because someone wanted to contribute to the thematic tutorials (hence, to be a developer!) and couldn't figure out how to do it without writing her own document to explain it.  So it was clearly valuable in the developer sense, turning things not just into rst files but into contributed documentation.  Does that explain it sufficiently?  Sorry if it's confusing because of my hurry.

Hello Karl-Dieter,

Does that work for you? I tried to add it at a place where those who are interested are sure to see it, while making it not too intrusive. It ends up being the first thing that everybody will read `;-)`

I'm really sorry I don't have time to think about this properly.  Maybe it's a little _too_ early there :-) but my bigger worry is whether that link will be brittle.

I'm sorry Karl, I don't know how to make it better.

Do not replace

```
sage --docbuild
```

by

```
sage -docbuild
```

Why? I always use it, and it works?..

For some reason this branch is red.

There were conflicts with several other doc branches that got merged in the meantime. I just rebased it.

I note that we now have
> Thematic Tutorials v6.5.rc0 » Thematic tutorial document tree »
which seems a little odd.  Shouldn't it just be one level?  Anyway, no doubt this stems from one of the other tickets you mentioned.

I think that it is because of the `toctree.rst` files. If I understand correctly, Sphinx will not detect a rst file as "indexed" unless it appears in some toctree. The current methodology seems to be the following
1) Create a toctree.rst file that only contains a toctree
2) Point to toctree.rst in the index file where nobody notices it

This way the toctree appears as far as Sphinx is concerned, and we are free to order the modules as we like instead of letting Sphinx do the job with a big 'toctree'.

This being said, I would say that simplifying this could be possible by just having this toctreee in the `index.rst` file and adding the 'hidden' SphinX keyword.

Plus we would not have to carry a reference to the toctree.rst file when we do not want one.

Thanks for your review,

Nathann

I would be happy to look at any ticket you happen to create that solves this.  It would be really unfortunate to have these extra layers of links floating around for any length of time, but I also understand it's not going to be anyone's highest priority (over, say, doing math).

It really is not very long to give the 'hidden' trick a try when you notice one. 5 minutes is all it takes to create the branch and the ticket.

As you know, for me it is somewhat longer to create all those things :-)

Sorry about that. I had not noticed `:-/`

This commit fixes it, by redirecting toward the developer's manual.
