CC:  kcrisman jhpalmieri vdelecroix tmonteil

As for the previous tickets, this branch is meant to make it easier to browse through. Shorter sentences, links, bold text.

This branch also moved (without changing anything) the tutorial on 'How to turn a sws file into a rst file' as it is not about Sage's internal documentation.

I also fixed the documentation about 'how to add a file to the doc', as the example used the combinat/ folder which since #16256 has a different procedure for that.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/17634

Does that work for you? I tried to add it at a place where those who are interested are sure to see it, while making it not too intrusive. It ends up being the first thing that everybody will read `;-)`

I think that it is because of the `toctree.rst` files. If I understand correctly, Sphinx will not detect a rst file as "indexed" unless it appears in some toctree. The current methodology seems to be the following
1) Create a toctree.rst file that only contains a toctree
2) Point to toctree.rst in the index file where nobody notices it

This way the toctree appears as far as Sphinx is concerned, and we are free to order the modules as we like instead of letting Sphinx do the job with a big 'toctree'.

This being said, I would say that simplifying this could be possible by just having this toctreee in the `index.rst` file and adding the 'hidden' SphinX keyword.

Plus we would not have to carry a reference to the toctree.rst file when we do not want one.

Thanks for your review,

Nathann

It really is not very long to give the 'hidden' trick a try when you notice one. 5 minutes is all it takes to create the branch and the ticket.
