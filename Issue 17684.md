# Issue 17684: faster matching polynomial

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/17921

ADD DESCRIPTION

Added ``matching_generating_poly``, modified ``matching_polynomial``

``matching_generating_poly`` computes the matching generating polynomial
on (possibly weighted) graphs.

The algorithm (see [ButPer]) uses polynomials on nilpotent elements,
implemented in the class ``Hobj`` in matchpoly.pyx,
and a greedy argument to order edges, contained in active_nodes.py

This algorithm is faster than the Godsil algorithm on large graphs.

I clean the description of the ticket to make it readable. Could you try to make it understandable?

I added an explanation on the use of nilpotent elements and two more examples.

The greedy argument to order edges in active_nodes.py orders edges in such a way that the graph
`G_i` defined by `edges[:i]` has few nodes which have not the same degree as in `G` (active nodes).
This leads to few `\eta_i` in the corresponding polynomial, so there are few terms.
The greedy algorithm adds edges without increasing the number of active nodes, if possible;
otherwise it adds a short path between two active nodes.

This algorithm can be probably improved using some
graph algorithm already in Sage, maybe an algorithm to reorder vertices used to visualize graphs.

Please try to get 100% coverage (`sage -coverage`) also in private methods. Please adhere to usual documentation guidelines: esp. start paragraphs with big caps, do not use `>>>` for examples.

failing doctests, see patchbot report

plus very bad formatting of the doc

I personally don't care about this ticket, but let me mention that it doesn't apply and that it should be rebased on top of #23126.
