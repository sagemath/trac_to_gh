Thank you for the contribution. Some comments:

- I am not sure I like `'default'` not being the default in Sage. Perhaps `'matplotlib'`? If we can't agree on a better name, this will be okay, but I might want to put some effort towards this.
- Is there an easy way to extend the contours to have different user input? I am thinking two parameters: one for choosing linear versus log scaling, and then another for the intervals. I am thinking about if someone is looking at where a function changes more slowly (a more trivial example, but something like `f(x) = z^2`).

Comment by @mwageringel created at 2022-02-27 15:04:04

Thank you for this addition. This will be nice to have in Sage. I have been playing around with this and have some remarks as well.

- The first thing I noticed is the aliasing effects. These are a bit unfortunate, but the way Sage interacts with Matplotlib makes it rather difficult to avoid them. At the time Sage creates the plot, the eventual size of the figure is not known, so upsampling of the image can not in general be avoided. I assume one might get fewer aliasing effects if it were possible to remap the colors of the upsampled image (so that the contours could be applied to the final image), but currently this seems very difficult to accomplish with Matplotlib. Therefore, I think the way you implemented it is the best we can do for now, even if it means that one needs a large number of plot points to obtain a smooth image.

- Renaming the function `complex_to_rgb` to `direct_complex_to_rgb` is not necessary. It is probably not used by anyone outside of Sage, but it is better to avoid breaking backward compatibility if we can. Also, functions that are meant for internal use should start with an underscore.

- Where possible we should use Numpy, unless there is a good reason not to. For example, the function `clamp` can be replaced by [numpy.clip](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.clip.html).

- I have tried to speed up the slow step in `cmap_complex_to_rgb` using Numpy. The following computation should be equivalent and faster, but please check this for correctness.

```


    -• `rgb[i,j,k]` is faster than `rgb[i][j][k]` as the latter creates temporary arrays.

    -• stacking the arrays was not necessary and cost time, so I kept `rgb` and `delta` separate.

 Now, this is not much slower than the old implementation anymore:

```
sage: from sage.plot.complex_plot import *
....: arr = list(map(list, matrix.random(CDF, 800)))
....: %timeit res = direct_complex_to_rgb(arr)
....: %timeit res = cmap_complex_to_rgb(arr)
60.5 ms ± 1.34 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10 loops each)
144 ms ± 829 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10 loops each)
```

 previously:

```
....: %timeit res = cmap_complex_to_rgb(arr)
1.13 s ± 9.25 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each)
```


 At this point, I think it makes sense to completely remove the old implementation and replace it by using the colormap `hsv` together with a sign change of the input data.

- For now I have focused on the colormap functionality. I have not looked at the contouring implementation yet, but noticed a problem with this example:

```
complex_plot(x, (-2,2), (-2,2), cmap='twilight', contoured=True)
```


  The `twilight` colormap should be cyclic continuous, so the plot does not look right.

- For the documentation, I would also suggest to replace one of the examples that specified a colormap to use `twilight` instead because it is cyclic.

It's not possible (as far as I can tell) to give the user the ability to choose the parameter for scaling. For example, I chose contours at `2^n` for logarithmic scaling. Fortunately, logarithmic scaling is pretty forgiving since logarithms grow so slowly. For linear scaling, the difference between scaling at `1` and `10`, say, is _really_ dramatic. I didn't put in a default linear scaling option for this reason.

The reason it's nontrivial to include is that these are used heavily in the compiled portion of the cython. I think this is the same reason why there is no runtime option to change the exponent for ``mag_to_lightness`` in the current ``complex_plot``.

Of course, I could be wrong.

Oh, thank you! I hadn't realized that cython changed to convert range-based loops into C-loops. (It seems this happened in 2018, and I'm behind the times). This is much nicer!

I'm currently examining the comments from `@`gh-mwageringel, but haven't acted on those comments yet.

Someone might utilize that difference. With having an extra parameter that the user can control, this becomes a useful tool that I believe should be easy to implement.

This doesn't make sense to me. You can just make your hardcoded values into input parameters, or have the lightness be a function (with the default being the hardcoded function).

I don't know what I was thinking. Of course you're right. This is easy to implement. I'll do that too.

Example of aliasing artifacts for linear contours

Attachment

I have now included several of the suggestions from `@`gh-mwageringel. In particular, I have changed many of the implementations to now be in numpy, including writing numpy forms of HLS->RGB and RGB->HLS translations. I'm not particularly great at numpy, but nonetheless this is markedly faster than my previous version.

> At this point, I think it makes sense to completely remove the old implementation and replace it by using the colormap hsv together with a sign change of the input data.

I almost did this completely. I changed the default `complex_plot` to use my new color implementation. There is a __very small__ difference that can be seen by comparing the outputs of


```
sage: complex_plot(x^3, (-2, 2), (-2, 2))
sage: complex_plot(x^3, (-2, 2), (-2, 2), cmap=None) # old default
```


This seems close enough to me that I'd be happy to remove the old implementation entirely.

> Is there an easy way to extend the contours to have different user input? I am thinking two parameters: one for choosing linear versus log scaling, and then another for the intervals. I am thinking about if someone is looking at where a function changes more slowly (a more trivial example, but something like f(x) = z^2). 

These commits also include this implementation. It is now possible to choose between linear vs log scaling, to choose the intervals between contours, the number of phases in the tiling method, and the rate of change of magnitude when there are no contours. I note that linear scaling can often lead quickly to Moire patterns once the rate of change of the function gets to be large. For a concrete example, I've included the two outputs of the plots from


```
sage: complex_plot(x^3, (-5, 5), (-5, 5), cmap=None, contoured=True, contour_type='linear', contour_base=10, plot_points=800)
sage: complex_plot(x^3, (-5, 5), (-5, 5), cmap=None, contoured=True, contour_type='linear', contour_base=10, plot_points=800)
```


<img src="result.png" width=600 px>

I'll add one such example and a warning to the documentation.

It is also now possible to adjust the exponent controlling how quickly the magnitude tends to white or black. This can be seen for example in

```
sage: complex_plot(x^3, (-5, 5), (-5, 5), cmap=None, plot_points=300)
sage: complex_plot(x^3, (-5, 5), (-5, 5), cmap=None, plot_points=300, dark_rate=1.0)
```

The output looks about as I expect. For concreteness, I've included a version (with 300 plot points) here: 

![](twilight.png)

There are two interactions governing the colors. First, there are contours affecting magnitudes. Then there is the colormap. The phase is mapped to the color, so we should expect on any circle centered at the origin to go through a cyclic continuous colormap (but each circle might be adjusted in lightness by the contouring). In a commit that will immediately after I write this, it's also possible to choose contour visibility (by adjusting `dark_rate`). With `twilight`, I find that setting `dark_rate = 0.2` works better. Setting `dark_rate = 0.0` now gives a pure phase plot.

> - For the documentation, I would also suggest to replace one of the examples that specified a colormap to use `twilight` instead because it is cyclic.

I think this is a good idea! I think I'm going to add many examples.

The difference is very small, but I cannot fully explain where the difference comes from. On closer inspection, I also noticed that the matplotlib `hsv` color map is discretized (which I did not expect), so one can see a difference when the phase varies very little. For example:

```
graphics_array([complex_plot(x^(1/10)*e^(2*pi*I/10), (-2, 2), (-2, 2)), complex_plot(x^(1/10)*e^(2*pi*I/10), (-2, 2), (-2, 2), cmap=None)])
```

A way around this would be creating our own hsv color map with more than 256 sampling points, but maybe that goes too far for this ticket. For now, should we just keep the old implementation?

Replying to [comment:12 DavidLowry]:
> The output looks about as I expect. For concreteness, I've included a version (with 300 plot points) here:

Yes, I now obtain the same result. When I reported the problem, there was a discontinuity in the color spectrum at about 10 degrees, but it seems to be fixed now.

I still need to take a closer look at the implementation.

Comment by tscrim created at 2022-03-04 00:21:53

I wouldn’t worry too much about minor aliasing differences when there is slight variation (some monitors might not be able to resolve these differences either). That being said, I am not opposed to keeping the current implementation since it does provide slightly better performance and it is already there and working.

I just realized that I'd mistyped one of the `sphinx_plot` examples in the documentation and had `nphases=20` instead of `nphases=5`. I just corrected this typo. As this consists only of changing two characters, I amended these two characters in the previous commit and force-pushed... maybe this was excessive.

Thank you both for your reviews! I tried to use numpy along gh-mwageringel's suggestions, but I wouldn't be too surprised if it were possible to improve my implementation of contours. But there is nothing remaining that I plan on changing or adding.

Sorry for being slow with the review. There are just a few minor things left.

The `sig_on`/`sig_off` in `complex_to_cmap_rgb` should only contain C/Cython code. Though, they contain calls to Python functions which should be avoided. See the warning about it [here](https://cysignals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/interrupt.html#using-sig-on-and-sig-off). You can move the `sig_off` to the end of the `for` loop.

This color map conversion seems redundant, as this is already done in a different place in the same way (almost, except for the 128 vs 126 difference which seems unintentional):

```
        if isinstance(cmap, str):
            if cmap == 'matplotlib':
                domain = np.linspace(0, 1, 256)
                shifted_domain = np.roll(domain, 128)
                default_cmap = mpl.colors.LinearSegmentedColormap.from_list(
                    "sage_default", mpl.cm.get_cmap('hsv')(shifted_domain)
                )
                cmap = default_cmap
            else:
                cmap = mpl.cm.get_cmap(cmap)
```


This allocation occurs in two places. I think it is not needed:

```
    cdef cnumpy.ndarray[cnumpy.float_t, ndim=3, mode='c'] rgbs = np.empty(dtype=float, shape=(imax, jmax, 3))
```


Typos:

```diff
-    We see that changing ``dark_rate`` affects how visible contours. In this
+    We see that changing ``dark_rate`` affects how visible contours are. In this
     example, we set ``contour_base=5`` and note that the points `0` and `1 + i`

-    contour. Raising ``dark_rate`` should have strong affects on the last

Other than that, everything looks good to me.

You can also use `sig_check()` for (e.g., `for`) loops.

One last nitpick: There is one more spot where this empty array `rgbs` is allocated, but replaced by a reference to another array later on.

Thank you, Volker.

`@`DavidLowry: To explain the problem a bit further, the problem with this test is that it is not numerically stable. I cannot replicate the problem directly, but adding a small perturbation to one of the values demonstrates it:

```
sage: from sage.plot.complex_plot import complex_to_rgb
sage: complex_to_rgb([[0, 1 + 1j, -3 - 4j + 1e-9]], tiled=True, contour_base=5, nphases=15)
[[[1.         0.         0.        ]
  [0.87741543 0.65806157 0.        ]
  [0.         0.08261755 0.72156143]]]
```

Probably, Volker observed the issue on a 32-bit machine, which can lead to numerical differences like this.

Is this a problem with the test or with the implementation, i.e. should the implementation of `complex_to_rgb` yield numerically stable results? I guess the tiling can never be completely stable, but seeing this problem with only three values is a bit unexpected. If it is just the test, maybe you could replace it by a different one.

Oh, thank you Markus. I couldn't replicate this and didn't understand. But you're right!

Looking at this test case now, I see that this is a poor choice of parameter. I think I chose them to be "random small numbers", but the law of small numbers bites here.

The reason this test acting like this is because a rgb value is being associated to a point lying *exactly* on a contour boundary. Here, contours are associated on powers of `contour_base=5`, and the point has absolute value exactly 5. The actual evaluation of contour boundaries occurs after taking logs, and thus it's reasonable to expect a certain amount of instability.

Away from the contours, these tests should be fine and pretty stable. I'll replace this test with a different one. I'll also make sure that I didn't make this same error elsewhere.

I actually wonder how much we have to worry about numerical noise. Perhaps we can modify these doctests to not have explicit values? Maybe just the first two or three sigfigs with `...`?

`@`tscrim That makes sense to me. I've incorporated a pretty general absolute tolerance into the tests.


---

Comment by tscrim created at 2022-03-16 00:03:11

Thanks. I changed some numbers to verify that the tolerance works. Two last little changes: The doctests on lines 1104 and 1114 should be marked as `# long time` since they take >3s on my (new fast) desktop. Once that is done, you can (re)set a positive review on my behalf.
