1. Cleanup some `**kwds` passing instead of explicitly listing some random subset of arguments to `cython()`.

2. Remove the redundant `import_test` function which doesn't really test anything that isn't tested already.

3. Make sure that all opened files are explicitly closed (typically using a `with` block).

4. In `cython_import`, restore `sys.path` after changing it.
