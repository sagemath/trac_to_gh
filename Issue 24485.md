# Issue 24485: Minor cleanup in sage.misc.cython

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/24722

Original creator: jdemeyer

Original creation time: 2018-02-13 09:35:49

1. Cleanup some `**kwds` passing instead of explicitly listing some random subset of arguments to `cython()`.

2. Remove the redundant `import_test` function which doesn't really test anything that isn't tested already.

3. Make sure that all opened files are explicitly closed (typically using a `with` block).

4. In `cython_import`, restore `sys.path` after changing it.
