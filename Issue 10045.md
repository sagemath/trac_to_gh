The following 3D simplex shouldn't be all that challenging, but we don't handle it well:


```
test = Polyhedron(vertices=[[0.8333333333, 0.8333333333, 0.8333333333], [1.022799569, 0.6321252838, 0.0], [0.7354697967, 0.280924808, 0.4545456098], [1.348361678, 0.0, 0.5150289612]], field=RDF)

test.facial_incidences()
[[0, [0, 1, 3]], [1, [1, 2, 3]], [2, []], [3, [0, 1, 2]]]
```


The root of this seems to be in how the incidence_matrix is based on the is_zero method:

```
H = list(test.Hrep_generator())[2]
print H
for V in test.Vrep_generator():
    if test._is_zero(H*V):
        test._incidence_matrix[V.index(),H.index()] = 1
    else:
        print H*V, ' for vertex ', V.vector()

An inequality (848702.5784, 1373226.161, -2221927.54) x + -1.0 >= 0
-0.000499999849126  for vertex  (0.8333333333, 0.8333333333, 0.8333333333)
1736102.60814  for vertex  (1.022799569, 0.6321252838, 0.0)
-0.000186597928405  for vertex  (0.7354697967, 0.280924808, 0.4545456098)
-5.35207800567e-05  for vertex  (1.348361678, 0.0, 0.5150289612)
```


and in the _init_field method of Polyhedron:

```
# 1e-6 is the cddf+ default fuzzy zero cutoff
            self._is_zero = lambda x: abs(x)<=1e-6
```


I realize that there will always be some problems like this for numerical (i.e. inexact) polyhedra, but it seems pretty sad that we can't handle a nice, reasonably sized simplex in 3D.  The only thing that immediately occurs to me is to either change how the inequalities are scaled or do something more complicated than the current _is_zero.

This is not a reasonable simplex, it is one with razor-sharp teeth ready to gnaw your leg off:

```
sage: v = test.Vrepresentation()
sage: matrix([vector(v[0]), vector(v[2]), vector(v[3])]).det()

That said, it would be nice if cdd could work with doubles instead of float for ~16 accurate digits. PPL can do that easily using templates and c++.

Well, that seems far too pessimistic to me.  This isn't very far from a regular simplex.  Its unacceptable to me that we can't handle this, even with cddlib.  It means that a variety of graphical output totally fails.

You are right, the problem is that cdd fixes the overall scale of the `<0,2,3>` supporting inequality by scaling the constant term to unity, not that the simplex is degenerate. cdd should normalize the normal vector to unity instead, but not blow up the coefficients just because the supporting hypersurface comes close to the origin.

This needs to be addressed within cddlib, we can't just renormalize the cddlib output. I think it would be a waste of time to try to fix up cddlib, though.

If cddlib internally computes with the wrong normalizations then its output can not be trusted. In your case you are presumably lucky since you have a simplex, so there is not much that can go wrong. But once you have lots of points it will blow up in your face.

If you insist, can you put the normalization somewhere in the cdd IO routines so that there are no crufty hacks in the main `Polyhedron` logic.

Which binary are you using to test PPL? The ppl_lcdd emulation supports only rational cdd input files.

I disagree, and I would like to fix this problem.  For rigorous computation I don't trust numerical computation of convex hulls anyway, unless there is some additional way to certify the correctness.  The numerical routines are important for having fast graphical output.  

The current behavior is just terrible, and I think this is a real improvement for lots of actual use cases.

To keep the main Polyhedron logic clean I will put in _init_from_cdd_output as follows:


```
        skip_to('H-representation')
        self._Hrepresentation = Sequence([])
        equations = cdd_linearities()
        skip_to('begin')
        l = cddout.pop(0).split()
        assert self._ambient_dim == int(l[1])-1, "Different ambient dimension?"
        for i in range(int(l[0])):
            l = cddout.pop(0)
            data = cdd_convert(l)
            if self._cdd_type == 'real':
                normal_norm = vector(data[1:]).norm()
                data = [x/normal_norm for x in data]
            if i in equations:
                Equation(self, data);
            else:
                Inequality(self, data);
```
