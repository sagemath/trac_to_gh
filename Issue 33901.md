All tests still pass in `clifford_algebra.py` and `clifford_algebra_element.pyx`.

There appears to be a bug in the following example

```
sage: E.<x,y> = ExteriorAlgebra(QQ)
sage: I = E.ideal([x * y - 1, x * y - x])
sage: I.groebner_basis()
```

where it gets stuck in an infinite while loop on line 206 of `exterior_algebra_groebner.pyx`. For comparison, 

```
i2 : QQ[x,y, SkewCommutative=>true]
o2 = QQ[x, y]
o2 : PolynomialRing, 2 skew commutative variables
i3 : I = ideal( x*y - 1, x*y - x)
o3 = ideal (x*y - 1, x*y - x)
o3 : Ideal of QQ[x, y]
i4 : groebnerBasis(I)
o4 = | 1 |
                      1                1
o4 : Matrix (QQ[x, y])  <--- (QQ[x, y])
```

I rebased this over my changes in #32369, fixed the comparison of ideals, and implemented multiplication of ideals. This is all of the low hanging fruit that I can see from a GB implementation. I think this is ready for review. I have looked at your changes, and I think they are good. All that remains is for you to check mine.

This should fix the remaining doctest failures in `groups/raag.py`. The issue was that we can't override `cdef _mul_` with `def _mul_`. That cohomology ring has a simple description of an exterior algebra modulo relations of the form `e_i ^ e_j = 0`. So that implementation likely could be improved as well, but that can be done on a followup ticket.

These changes now make this multiplication test twice as fast:

```
sage: E = ExteriorAlgebra(QQ, 'x', 10)
sage: r = sum(E.basis())
sage: %timeit r * r
57.2 ms ± 842 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10 loops each)
```

versus before

```
129 ms ± 700 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10 loops each)
```

Here is an improvement to multiplication by a single term:

```
sage: %timeit a * r
2.4 µs ± 34.9 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100,000 loops each)
sage: %timeit r * a
4.88 µs ± 76.6 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100,000 loops each)
sage: %timeit E(2) * r
5.51 µs ± 41.2 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100,000 loops each)
sage: %timeit r * E(2)
5.63 µs ± 63.1 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100,000 loops each)
sage: %timeit E(0) * r
1.05 µs ± 7.86 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1,000,000 loops each)
sage: %timeit r * E(0)
1.02 µs ± 5.09 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1,000,000 loops each)
```

versus b227973:

```
5.09 µs ± 64.5 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100,000 loops each)
6.43 µs ± 19.7 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100,000 loops each)
5.17 µs ± 19.9 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100,000 loops each)
8.1 µs ± 33.9 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100,000 loops each)
1.34 µs ± 6.96 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1,000,000 loops each)
1.76 µs ± 13.4 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1,000,000 loops each)
```

The difference with the left versus right is because we do not choose which term to slide past the other. We can maybe address that here, along with removing the code duplication I have introduced.

Here is an update for the GBs that does the reduction in-place, which required me to remove duplicate entries during the GB. For "small" examples, it is slower:

```
sage: E.<x0,x1,x2,x3,x4,x5> = ExteriorAlgebra(QQ)
sage: I = E.ideal(5*x0^2*x3+37*x1*x3*x4+32*x1*x3*x5+21*x3*x5+55*x4*x5,
....:                     39*x0*x1*x5+23*x1^2*x4+57*x1*x2*x4+56*x1*x4^2+10*x2^2+52*x3*x4*x5,
....:                     33*x0^2*x3+51*x0^2+42*x0*x3*x5+51*x1^2*x4+32*x1*x3^2+x5^3,
....:                     44*x0*x3^2+42*x1*x3+47*x1*x4^2+12*x2*x3+2*x2*x4*x5+43*x3*x4^2,
....:                     49*x0^2*x2+11*x0*x1*x2+39*x0*x3*x4+44*x0*x3*x4+54*x0*x3+45*x1^2*x4,
....:                     48*x0*x2*x3+2*x2^2*x3+59*x2^2*x5+17*x2+36*x3^3+45*x4)
sage: %time GB = I.groebner_basis()
CPU times: user 116 ms, sys: 0 ns, total: 116 ms
Wall time: 115 ms
```

versus before

```
CPU times: user 76.7 ms, sys: 299 µs, total: 77 ms
Wall time: 76.7 ms
```

However, I think that is just due to the extra amount of information we have to store and manipulate. I strongly believe that will get dominated (and become insignificant) once the examples get larger. The data structure for that is not very efficient and could be improved. Yet, I still haven't gotten it to be anywhere close to what M2 can do; in particular this example that took you ~7s in M2:

```
sage: E.<p0,p1,p2,p3,p4,p5,p6,p7> = ExteriorAlgebra(QQ)
sage: I = E.ideal(3821*p2*p3*p4*p5*p6*p7-7730*p2*p3*p4*p5*p6-164*p2*p3*p4*p5*p7-2536*p2*p3*p4*p6*p7-4321*p2*p3*p5*p6*p7-2161*p2*p4*p5*p6*p7-2188*p3*p4*p5*p6*p7-486*p2*p3*p4*p5+3491*p2*p3*p4*p6+4247*p2*p3*p5*p6+3528*p2*p4*p5*p6+2616*p3*p4*p5*p6-101*p2*p3*p4*p7+1765*p2*p3*p5*p7+258*p2*p4*p5*p7-378*p3*p4*p5*p7+1246*p2*p3*p6*p7+2320*p2*p4*p6*p7+1776*p3*p4*p6*p7+1715*p2*p5*p6*p7+728*p3*p5*p6*p7+842*p4*p5*p6*p7+69*p2*p3*p4-1660*p2*p3*p5+1863*p2*p4*p5+1520*p3*p4*p5-245*p2*p3*p6-804*p2*p4*p6-2552*p3*p4*p6-3152*p2*p5*p6+40*p3*p5*p6-1213*p4*p5*p6+270*p2*p3*p7-851*p2*p4*p7+327*p3*p4*p7-1151*p2*p5*p7+1035*p3*p5*p7-161*p4*p5*p7-230*p2*p6*p7-294*p3*p6*p7-973*p4*p6*p7-264*p5*p6*p7+874*p2*p3-2212*p2*p4+168*p3*p4+511*p2*p5-918*p3*p5-2017*p4*p5-76*p2*p6+465*p3*p6+1629*p4*p6+856*p5*p6-54*p2*p7-1355*p3*p7+227*p4*p7+77*p5*p7-220*p6*p7-696*p2+458*p3+486*p4+661*p5-650*p6+671*p7-439,

My guess is M2 is doing something very special and particular with the linear algebra (and maybe some stuff in parallel). Anyways, this is as best as I can get for now.

Thank you.

Next steps for followup tickets:

- Generalizing this implementation to work with any PBW-like basis.
- The improvements noted at the end of comment:26.
- Finding other speed improvements.
- Implement conversion to/from M2 and/or Singular (via plural) to have that as an alternative algorithm.

cc-ing Simon to let him know about this as he might be interested in it.

Indeed I'm interested. General question (before heaving looked at the code): What was the rationale for a "native" implementation (aka "reinventing the wheel" instead of using what (e.g.) Singular has to offer?

I couldn't find a dedicated implementation of GB and the exterior algebra through some (not super extensive) Google searching. With Singular using the generic `g`-algebra and Plural code, I didn't think it would be particularly fast (although I have no timings to back this up) and it seems quite cumbersome to go back-and-forth with. Not everyone has Macaulay2 installed. So I figured this would be the easiest way to get this functionality and, hopefully (but unfortunately does not (yet) seem to be done), the fastest way.

I may be wrong, but I thought that the main feature of "exterior algebra" is being graded-commutative. And that's provided by what Singular calls "super-commutative". And that belongs to the parts of Plural that are wrapped in Sage already.

Looking at `SCA` (`from sage.rings.polynomial.plural import SCA`), it seems that ideals over super-commutative algebras are mainly dealt with generically. On the other hand, I see uses of libsingular's `groeber_basis` functions in the SCA-code. Strange. Anyway, it is available via libsingular, and I do use it in my cohomology code. Perhaps all what's missing is an interface, so that it can be used without directly invoking libsingular.

To build quotients using `GradedCommutativeAlgebra` (which uses Plural), the ideals are currently mandated to be homogeneous. Although if I pass `check=False`, it seems like it is doing the GB computation:

```
sage: E.<p0,p1,p2,p3,p4,p5,p6,p7> = GradedCommutativeAlgebra(QQ)
sage: I = E.ideal(5*x0^2*x3+37*x1*x3*x4+32*x1*x3*x5+21*x3*x5+55*x4*x5,
....:                     39*x0*x1*x5+23*x1^2*x4+57*x1*x2*x4+56*x1*x4^2+10*x2^2+52*x3*x4*x5,
....:                     33*x0^2*x3+51*x0^2+42*x0*x3*x5+51*x1^2*x4+32*x1*x3^2+x5^3,
....:                     44*x0*x3^2+42*x1*x3+47*x1*x4^2+12*x2*x3+2*x2*x4*x5+43*x3*x4^2,
....:                     49*x0^2*x2+11*x0*x1*x2+39*x0*x3*x4+44*x0*x3*x4+54*x0*x3+45*x1^2*x4,
....:                     48*x0*x2*x3+2*x2^2*x3+59*x2^2*x5+17*x2+36*x3^3+45*x4)
sage: Q = E.quotient(I, check=False)
sage: Q.gens()
(x0, x1, -45/17*x4, x3, x4, x5)
```

Indeed, the interface for GBs does seem to be missing from these ideals. So I cannot run timings.

The specialized multiplication for the exterior algebra is apparently faster:

```
sage: E.<x0,x1,x2,x3,x4,x5> = ExteriorAlgebra(QQ)
sage: r = sum(E.basis())
sage: %timeit r * r
527 µs ± 6.81 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1,000 loops each)

sage: E.<x0,x1,x2,x3,x4,x5> = GradedCommutativeAlgebra(QQ)
sage: r = sum(sum(E.basis(n)) for n in range(7))
sage: %timeit r * r
712 µs ± 5.39 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1,000 loops each)
```

So it should be possible to make the version of GBs here faster. It should just require being more clever about how we do the linear algebra.

Another reason why it is good to have a Sage version is this can handle any field that Sage has, which I believe is a lot more than what Singular can do (and take advantage of the corresponding specialized linear algebra code). With some hopefully minor future tweaks, this could work over more general (skew?) commutative rings.

Also, do you know if Plural handles left/right and two-sided ideals?
