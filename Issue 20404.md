In order to move towards python3, let us progressively change the way we do the imports. Here in some top level `all.py` and `__init__.py` files.

In `src/sage/calculus/all.py`, is this line really needed?

```
from . import desolvers
```

Similarly, there are 2 imports like that in `src/sage/geometry/all.py`

Hello and thanks for caring about my tickets.

Why do want to remove them here ? They are in the global namespace. Removing something from global namespace is not the purpose of this ticket.

Replying to [comment:8 chapoton]:
> They are in the global namespace.

Right, very good point.

I was thinking of imports like

```
import sage.foo.bar
```

which don't serve any purpose in `all.py` files since they don't actually put anything in the global scope.

This also means that, in `all.py` files,

```
import sage.foo.bar
```

is _not_ equivalent to

```
from sage.foo import bar
```
