Hello and thanks for caring about my tickets.

Why do want to remove them here ? They are in the global namespace. Removing something from global namespace is not the purpose of this ticket.

Replying to [comment:8 chapoton]:
> They are in the global namespace.

Right, very good point.

I was thinking of imports like

```
import sage.foo.bar
```

which don't serve any purpose in `all.py` files since they don't actually put anything in the global scope.

This also means that, in `all.py` files,

```
import sage.foo.bar
```

is *not* equivalent to

```
from sage.foo import bar
```
