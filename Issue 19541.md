I moved the code around in `difference_family` in order to have all constructions that does not need the factorisation of `v` before. In other words

This is more about code organization rather than timings. The previous version of the code was

```
D = None
... # try some stuff
if D is None:
    ... # try other stuff
if D is None:
    ... # try another one
```

Hello again,

I have been staring for a while at the parameters v,k,l, looking for a way to avoid the database. Now number theory really isn't my thing, but I wonder about that: shouldn't the gcd of 'v,l,m' be *very* close to `q^s`? Actually, in the factorization of `gcd(v,l,m)` into `pi,si`, aren't we sure that `q^s` is equal to the largest value of `pi^si`.

Actually (please tell me if I am wrong) by developping k as a series I get that `k=lambda+q^(2s)`, thus `gcd(lambda,k)` is a power of `q` greater than `q^s` (because both k and l can be divided by `q^s`).

I'm getting very convinced that `q^s` is actually equal to `gcd(lambda,k)`.

Well, what do you think? `:-/`

Hello again,

I pushed a couple of modifications at `public/19778`. [A typo here/a comment there], though I also added a couple of checks in a test, and multiplied by (q-1) instead of using `// (q-1)`, just in case the integer division may make equal two values which should not be. I also used 'izip' in a loop somewhere: you are welcome to revert it if you do not like it, and to change the ticket's status when you are satisfied with the code.

Thanks for this addition! I will not get a look at the ticket above this one.

Beta2 is out, and the "conflicter" is this `f*******` "upper case" ticket #19789.

It seems that others are on the way, for Eulerian, Hamiltonian, Abelian, ...

People have time to waste.
