Is it normal that `build/pkgs/configure/checksums.ini` and `build/pkgs/configure/package-version.txt` were modified in this ticket?

hmm, no. But this is the last commit that Volker has closed before the release.

These files are not modified on `u/MartinPepin/dancing_links_docs_formatting` at least.

By the way, what's the usual practice regarding merged branches? Can I remove the branch on trac or is there a policy to keep them?
