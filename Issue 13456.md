Patch attached. I haven't changed the `LU` and `QR` functions for two reasons:
1. I don't quite know what to cache in those functions there.
2. The behavior of `RR` and `CC` is already documented in those functions.

This doesn't generalise to a `RealField` of higher precision.  I would suggest PARI's `mateigen()` is a good preinvented wheel to use.  It is not currently wrapped in Sage, but that would be easy to do.
