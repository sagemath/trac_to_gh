# Issue 13456: Auto convert matrices over RR/CC to RDF/CDF for eigenvalue/eigenvector computations

Issue created by migration from Trac.

This ticket implements [the suggestion](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/12514#comment:5) that was discussed in #12514. The idea is to be helpful to new users and coax them into doing the computations over the right fields.

Attachment

Patch attached. I haven't changed the `LU` and `QR` functions for two reasons:
1. I don't quite know what to cache in those functions there.
2. The behavior of `RR` and `CC` is already documented in those functions.

Added a git version of the patch. This is based on 6.1.beta5.

This doesn't generalise to a `RealField` of higher precision.  I would suggest PARI's `mateigen()` is a good preinvented wheel to use.  It is not currently wrapped in Sage, but that would be easy to do.
