Keywords: crystals, morphisms, subcrystals

This implements:

- Crystal morphisms (usual, twisted, and virtual).
- Subcrystals, so we no long have to do the subset workaround in `digraph()`.
- Virtual crystals, so we can now view the elements in the virtual crystal as a crystal graph.

This also reworks `DirectSumOfCrystals` and `TensorProductOfCrystals` to make them associative as constructions.

After this, we will be able to do coercions between crystals.

Also, I'd like to deprecate the method `crystal_morphism` in place of `morphism`, but the KR crystals currently use them. In an ideal world, I'd just do a straight replacement of the method, but this might be too drastic of a change...

I am not sure to have all elements of context for the case at hand, but the name ``crystal_morphism`` is a priori better than ``morphim``. For the same reason, we have module_morphism, algebra_morphism etc else where. The point is that if a set has several structures this naming convention avoids conflicts.

Okay, so I've changed KR crystals to return honest crystal morphisms and made `DirectSumOfCrystals` into a proper facade parent (when requested). I've also changed `morphism()` to `crystal_morphism()` and moved the old function to `kirillov_reshetikhin.py` in case we want to revive it. I also added references to `virtual_crystal.py` and had `Subcrystal` redirect to `VirtualCrystal` depending on parameters so we could have in the future a more uniform interface with the `subcrystal()` method.

Here's some timing tests for KR crystals.

The test I ran:

```python
def test_KR(ct, r, s):
    print "construction:"
    %time B = KirillovReshetikhinCrystal(ct, r, s)
    print "TestSuite:"
    %time TestSuite(B).run()
    print "Digraph:"
    %time G = B.digraph()
```

So there's a major speed penality with using promotion as a crystal morphism directly. My guess is caused from the fact we are no longer caching things. On develop we have:

```
sage: K = KirillovReshetikhinCrystal(['D',4,1], 2,2)
sage: K.promotion()
Cached version of <function morphism at 0xc77133c>
```

So I have a the following questions:

1 - The code and the documentation for the old `crystal_morphism()` did not match as the default was to not cache (i.e. `cache = False` but the code did return a cached function when the `cache` argument was `False`. Do we want to cache the output of the promotion (or something else that's related)?

2 - Do we want to use honest crystal morphisms or use the old function returned from the old `crystal_morphism()`?

3 - Do we want to have an option to cache the output of a crystal morphism, or morphisms in general?

I simplified the classes for the different types of crystal morphisms down to a single class as Anne and I discussed.

I also implemented a `subtype` method for `CartanType` to simplify the overall interface so that crystal morphisms does not directly depend on the index set (instead it is indirectly as part of the Cartan type).

If there is a bug in Nakajima monomials, I suggest that you split that off (since I will have quite a few changes to this patch) and discuss it with Ben (as he did most of the changes in #18453 to Nakajima monomials).

Hi Travis,

Here are some comments on the current branch:

sage: b.parent()

- Many of the morphism methods do not work

- subcrystals now has options ``virtualization``, ``scaling_factors``, but there are no examples on how to use them. Please add examples that test all options.

- What is the status on the slow down that you mentioned earlier for KR crystals? I think such a huge slow down would not be acceptable (since they are anyway slow already).

So much for now,

Anne

I will take a look at this in more detail and update documentation/examples accordingly.

In general, this is an undecidable problem and should result in this error. However, since this is a morphism of a finite crystal, this should work at the very least by brute force. Will implement.

> {{{

This is easy enough to check as long as the crystals have a finite generating set; otherwise it may run forever.

Will do.

See comment:15. Overall it seems the caching and construction of the morphisms I do is faster than before. However there seems to be some slowdowns when there is no caching (and for some object creations, but these are acceptable IMO as it is small in absolute time and the creation of KR crystals is infrequent). I can try and optimize it more if you think what is currently there is insufficient.

I've added support for many of the methods for the morphisms (and generalized them so that they work when the domain is finite).

For the induced crystals, `preimage` was the wrong word; it should have been `inverse`. I've updated the documentation accordingly.

Do you want me to try and further optimize the KR crystals?

I guess I really don't need this since I'm operating under the assumption that the crystal is non-empty. Will change.

Note for self, add examples for virtualization arguments to subcrystal.
