I would still like to understand why this is bad practice. The discussion in the link is interesting
and has some gotchas I didn't know about. Using unicode for function names as in
the discussion would get a WTF from me. I also would not think of using a unicode identifier
outside of a mathematical context.

I have simply used a greek letter as a local identifier
following standard practice in mathematical literature.
My understanding is that this is fine in a notebook.

The pyflakes is now green.

All tests passed! when I ran them locally.

I am not expecting a positive review as it does not yet do the calculation I want it for.
I paused here because i) I needed a break and ii) Travis said it was better to break up a large project to make life easier for the reviewer.

I am now ready to continue with this project.

Some quick comments:

- IMO all of the Python3 type annotation adds clutter. I would recommend using it more sparingly.
- Why are you providing a `__str__`? I don't see why this is necessary.
- `while(flag):` -> `while flag:`
- `parent` should be the first argument to any `Element` class. This is something we want across all of Sage. You then shouldn't need to implement an `_element_constructor_`.
- Use `.. TODO::`.
- Put `UniqueRepresentation` first in the MRO.
- I don't see the reason why you need the `baxter` parameter in `from_permutation`.
- Start your doc on the line after the `"""`. This is the convention we use in Sage.
- You have some inconsistent indentation.
- `set(c.keys())` -> `set(c)`
- Your doctests in `normalize` are incorrectly formatted.
- Add the file to the documentation.
- Check the formatting of the module-level documentation.
- You should not import everything from the module. There is a major conflict with `Vector`, and only `SphericalWeb` should be imported as that is the only thing directly used by the user.

I have now implemented SphericalSpider as a Parent parametrised by the boundary values.

There are two issues that seem to me to be "work arounds". One is that I have both Strand and halfedge. I can almost do away with halfedge and work with "is" and "equal by value". My best guess at the problem I encountered is that dictionaries don't work with "is". I have not tried overwriting __hash__.
