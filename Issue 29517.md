Keywords: sd109

Remove

- backports_abc
- backports_functools_lru_cache
- backports_shutil_get_terminal_size
- backports_ssl_match_hostname
- configparser
- enum34
- functools32
- future
- ipaddress
- pathlib2
- singledispatch
- subprocess32
- typing

Also remove the use of `six` in the build process. (There are still many uses of `six` in the Sage library, and also the package `traitlets` uses it, so we cannot delete `six` now.)

Should we also remove `sagenb`? That would let us remove

- flask
- flask_autoindex
- flask_babel
- flask_oldsessions
- flask_openid
- flask_silk
- sagenb
- twisted ? (it may be used by terminado when it is present, but terminado may function fine without it)
- werkzeug

If the sagenb removal is a good idea, it could also be done on a separate ticket.
