This might break multiple doctests using random graphs.

I'm not sure it's the right way to do it and I don't understand why some doctests have to be modified...

Also, we have some doctest errors in `src/sage/tests/books/computational-mathematics-with-sagemath/graphtheory_doctest.py` that we will have to fix in the `graphtheory.tex` (I don't know where it is yet).

My guess as to why doctests are needed to be changed is `current_randstate()` is not called as often. So all of those doctests that are depending on a specific state are changed. The 32-bit tests will also need to be updated.

For those book tests, you are using a different method of constructing the seed I believe. Hence, it is doing something on a different graph and changing the seed in a different way for the second doctest. So these are essentially trivial failures.

I agree these are trivial failures, but I don't know where is to tex file to correct.
