Re-did the commits because the older ones leaked my local host name. Whoops...

I would much prefer to have one ticket for each issue that you are fixing instead of grouping together a bunch of unrelated patches.

Some of these commits are very small and opening a new ticket just for a single-line commit seems like unnecessary overhead. The libgap and scipy ones are a bit larger. Shall I still split everything or would you be happy with me splitting out only these two?

One ticket per issue. If that means 10 tickets, then so be it.

Reopened as #22437, #22438, #22439, #22440, #22441, #22442, #22443, #22444, #22445.

You can close this ticket. I tried but it doesn't look like I have the permissions.

(and thanks for the effort of proposing the patches to Sage!)

welcome! I've fixed the missing branches, I think it is something to do with the fact that trac logs me out every 10 minutes or so (because I connect through Tor).. will keep an eye out on that in the future
