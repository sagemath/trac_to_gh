CC:  @jhpalmieri @orlitzky @kliem

This is for #29013 - which proposes to install Python packages in `$SAGE_VENV` instead of `$SAGE_LOCAL`.

`Makefile` would set `SAGE_SPKG_PREFIX=$SAGE_VENV` for these packages.  This will in particular set the installation location of installation records to `$SAGE_VENV/var/lib/sage/{installed,scripts,wheels}`.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/30622

There is two small things that could be fixed along the way:
- `make dist` does not appear in `make --help`.
- `local/bin/sage-sdist` claims it should be called by `spkg/bin/sage`, but it is really run by `local/bin/sage`.

The error message `This Makefile needs to be invoked by build/make/install` seems strange, as there is at least one other legal way to call the Makefile, as we discovered here. If it is not included in the message, I think the comment should be more verbose.

My version of `make` here on macOS does not list any targets on `make --help`. In any case, beyond the scope of the ticket.

> - `local/bin/sage-sdist` claims it should be called by `spkg/bin/sage`, but it is really run by `local/bin/sage`.
