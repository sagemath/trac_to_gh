# Issue 15142: Improving documentation for triangular module morphisms

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/15379

Original creator: darij

Original creation time: 2013-11-08 00:52:32

Keywords: categories, modules, free modules

This is just something I wrote while learning how to use triangular module morphisms. Nothing really changed apart from some asserts replaced by ValueErrors (far from systematically...) and some unneeded declarations and imports removed; however, the doc is IMHO more readable now and the doctests cover some less-obvious cases.
