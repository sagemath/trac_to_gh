# Issue 11188: The Rubik's Cube group in Sage doesn't support many basic operations for a dumb reason.

We have

```
sage: G = CubeGroup()
sage: G.order()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
AttributeError: 'CubeGroup' object has no attribute '_gap_string'
sage: G.sylow_subgroup(3)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
AttributeError: 'CubeGroup' object has no attribute '_gap_string'
```


However, these things are all easily computable in Sage:

```
sage: G2 = PermutationGroup(G.gens())
sage: G2.order()
43252003274489856000
sage: G2.sylow_subgroup(3)
Permutation Group with generators [(24,30,43)(32,48,38), ...
```

This could be easily fixed by implementing `CubeGroup._gap_init_()`. Generically, one could implement this in terms of gens() if it's not already there.

Yes, that works. You should elide the commented-out lines and the "Stored in the ``self._gap_string`` attribute" comment is also incorrect and should probably just be omitted. 

I'm still curious as to why this is a group and has a ._group attribute, but that's probably for another ticket.

Helloooooo !!!

I guess this patch is more a "group theory" patch than "graph theory", but it is not so complicated anyway. And I checked what I needed to know on [1] `:-)`

Positive review to this patch ! 

By the way, I wondered about something. A colleague of mine is working on graph automorphisms, and it seems our library on this aspect is pretty poor. Can we do anything else than just "forward instructions to GAP" ? It seems Sage's a long way to be a good alternative to their code.. Perhaps it is not meant to be, however...

I just checked the definition of "layman", just to be sure, and it looks like it is not exactly what I meant. What I meant was "I would be glad to have the opinion of somebody actually working with both Sage and GAP".

Helloooooooooo !!

Well, this is very far from being a code I fully understand, but as the modifications are superficial I just had to check that "if what was there before made sense, then what this patch changes makes sense too" `:-D`

It looks good, though I have two comments :
* Why don't the `__str__` and `__repr__` method return the same string ? `O_o`
* You added a `check` argument to `parse` which is not documented.
