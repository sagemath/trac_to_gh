Like the concept, don't like the `INPUT` block.  Can you make it look more like the other ones, say in plotting - with bullet points and entry type and defaults, that is?  At least, I think the current one won't look that nice.

Thanks, KDC.  Was just too sloppy and forgot the bullets.

Tried to work on this and discovered a `ones_matrix` constructor was merged into 4.6.1.alpha1 at #9685!  Guess I was not paying attention as well, since it was over in "user interface."  Looks like Robert Miller did like I did and cribbed from the `zero_matrix` constructor, so I think there is not much difference between his and mine.

I do have an INPUT block in my documentation, even if it needs work.  ;-)  Should I steal from my work here and slightly improve the already-merged version?  I've cc'ed the folks on the previous ticket.

Might as well do the same thing for the `zero_matrix` et al. as well.

I see no reason why this ticket shouldn't be renamed to reflect this new purpose...
