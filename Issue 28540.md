We plan to implement F5 algorithm for computing Gröbner bases over Tate algebras.

This ticket is a follow-up of #26195.

The patchbot "blocks" plugin tells you to avoid finishing a line with space then `:`. There should be no space before the final `:`.

Patchbot will complain about space before colon here:

```
+                if vv == 0 :
```

Did you ever look at the previous patchbot reports ?

Batch modifying tickets that will likely not be ready for 9.1, based on a review of the ticket title, branch/review status, and last modification date.

This doesn't make sense for a class level docstring:

```
Initialize a class for ideals in a Tate series algebra
```

Did you mean `An ideal in a Tate series algebra`?

For the result of the Gröbner basis, perhaps we should cache that where we disregard the algorithm (and keywords) used?

You can remove the `TESTS::` block in `Jpair`. Also, would it make sense to inline that?

Instead of `int i`, I have been told it is better to use `Py_ssize_t i` as this can have a larger range of possible values.

Nitpick:

```diff
-    - ``I`` - an ideal in a Tate series algebra
+    - ``I`` -- an ideal in a Tate series algebra
 
-    - ``prec`` - the related precision at which the initial generators
+    - ``prec`` -- the related precision at which the initial generators
       are truncated
```


Also, the convention that we follow in Sage is that the one-line start of docstrings should end with a period/full-stop.

I'm not sure: if the user specifies explicitely another algorithm, maybe it means that he really wants to use it and not to get a cached value.

Hmm...perhaps it would give a different answer as it might not be be a reduced Gröbner basis. Okay, then let's leave it as uncached. Thanks.

In the latest commit, we removed a test which was a debug relic. This if branch is never entered and the debug content would pose problems if it were.
