In case, the difference between 94499109968480 and 94499109902944 is `2^16`.

This was https://github.com/linbox-team/givaro/issues/39 which I had erroneously closed, as it did not show up for while.
I reopened the issue. Note that on our CI build, the difference is `2^13 x 13`, `2^15` or `5x2^14`.

Note that the field that causes this bug `ModularExtended<double>` is not being used in sage.

Changing priority from blocker to major.

Thanks for the hint, let me remove the `blocker` priority. But i guess it is still healthy to provide upstream packages well-tested and with their whole capabilities (also, we might use that field later in Sage).

I confirm that givaro 4.0.4 builds and pass self-tests on my 23bit VM.
