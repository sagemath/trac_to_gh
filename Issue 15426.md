# Issue 15426: Fix wrong claim about Suter's paper

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/15663

Original creator: darij

Original creation time: 2014-01-11 12:34:45

CC:  sage-combinat aschilling tscrim

Keywords: partitions, suter slides

I accidentally misunderstood one of the two definitions of Suter slides in his paper and claimed in the docstring that it would conflict with the other. My apologies for that!

This branch merges cleanly with my other partitions.py branch (#15428).

Hey Darij,

I made some review changes that make the doc a little more reading IMO. If you're happy with my changes, then you can set a positive review.

Best,

Travis

Hi Travis,

thanks a lot for checking these. But if you change some `l`s to `\ell`s, please do this for all of them.

Regards,\\
Darij

Hey Darij,

I couldn't find any other places in `partition.py` where `l` was used except where it is code formatted to reflect the input variable.

Best,

Travis

Oooops! There were no `l`s. I mistook one of my `i`s for an `l` on cursory reading (good argument in favor of your change).

Positive review; thanks again!

Best regards,\\
Darij
