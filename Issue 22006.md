# Issue 22006: Upgrade to boost 1.62

I am creating this ticket to mention a patch that fixes some doctests when using boost 1.62 or higher.

The hash function for boost::hash_combine() which is called in 
libbrial/include/polybori/routines/pbori_routines_hash.h was changed for
boost 1.62 in the commit
https://github.com/boostorg/functional/commit/45eeb170f2b1372b4b5e52744d3c51eddb285b42

Therefore some brial hashes that are tested in doctests changed.

Here is the patch:

For some strange reason I think going to a new boost on OS X won't change the hash which seems bizarre has it means it is much less portable.

I haven't built a sage on OS X with boost-1.62.0+ but I have run brial's testsuite and it looks like the tests about hashes do not change between 1.58.0 and 1.65.1 so I expect the same thing to happen in sage. It seems to be an apple specific thing, I tried clang on linux and I just get the same results as with gcc.

I don't think we should check for the actual (meaningless) hash values but should just check that the hashes are sane. (A pattern which we use in many other places already.)

Changing keywords from "" to "debian, BRiAl, boost".

I'd be ok with that. We should update boost and boost_cropped in sync. This is not the case now but that would be more sane and avoid any issue because of different version of boost used.

fbissey, I am not sure I understand what you propose. Are you saying that we should also update boost as part of this ticket?

fbissey, would you mind reviewing this?

Must have missed your earlier comment. There was that ticket about upgrading boost and I must have mixed the tickets up. But this looks good to me and reduce the complexity of my ebuild and my patches.
