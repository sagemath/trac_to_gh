Keywords: debian, BRiAl, boost

Some of the doctests for BRiAl test for the exact hash value. They rely on boost::hash_combine() which is called in 
libbrial/include/polybori/routines/pbori_routines_hash.h. The implementation has changed for
boost 1.62 in the commit
https://github.com/boostorg/functional/commit/45eeb170f2b1372b4b5e52744d3c51eddb285b42

The proposed changes make the doctest more flexible. We now only check that the hashes are sane not that they are a certain exact value.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/22243

For some strange reason I think going to a new boost on OS X won't change the hash which seems bizarre has it means it is much less portable.

I haven't built a sage on OS X with boost-1.62.0+ but I have run brial's testsuite and it looks like the tests about hashes do not change between 1.58.0 and 1.65.1 so I expect the same thing to happen in sage. It seems to be an apple specific thing, I tried clang on linux and I just get the same results as with gcc.

I don't think we should check for the actual (meaningless) hash values but should just check that the hashes are sane. (A pattern which we use in many other places already.)

I'd be ok with that. We should update boost and boost_cropped in sync. This is not the case now but that would be more sane and avoid any issue because of different version of boost used.

Must have missed your earlier comment. There was that ticket about upgrading boost and I must have mixed the tickets up. But this looks good to me and reduce the complexity of my ebuild and my patches.
