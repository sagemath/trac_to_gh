Python defines `divmod()` for what is `.quo_rem()` in Sage.
To make transitioning between Python and Sage easier, we should also support `divmod()`.

It seems the most obvious strategy to implement this would be to add a `.__divmod__()` method to ring elements that tries calling `.quo_rem()` first, then falls back to computing quotient and remainder separately using `//` and `%`.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/33704
