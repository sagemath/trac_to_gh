# Issue 28659: Graphs: Move common methods of backends to CGraph

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28896

Original creator: @kliem

Original creation time: 2019-12-18 20:18:03

Keywords: graphs, backends

There is a few methods that are implemented exactly the same way in dense and sparse graph:

- add_arc
- has_arc
- del_all_arcs
- out_neighbors
- in_neighbors

All they do is wrap the corresponding unsafe methods. So it makes sense to move that code all to `CGraph`.
