# Issue 12290: max((5,6,NaN)) != max((NaN,5,6))

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/12462

```
sage: max((5,NaN))
5
sage: max((NaN,5))       
NaN
```


I think this is either a problem how NaN is defined in the symbolics framework, or how python's max works. Also, same holds true for `min` and probably similar operators â€¦

I think this should be closed as invalid.  In pure Python (nothing to do with sage), we have:

```
$ python
Python 2.7.1 (r271:86832, Jun 16 2011, 16:59:05) 
[GCC 4.2.1 (Based on Apple Inc. build 5658) (LLVM build 2335.15.00)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> nan = float('nan')
>>> max(5.0, nan)
5.0
>>> max(nan, 5.0)
nan
>>> 5.0 > nan
False
>>> 5.0 < nan
False
```


This is a consequence of how Python's max is defined, and how IEEE defined comparison with nan.  Read about that here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1565164/what-is-the-rationale-for-all-comparisons-returning-false-for-ieee754-nan-values

See also http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4237914/python-max-min-builtin-functions-depend-on-parameter-order for a discussion if *precisely* this exact issue in Python.

Again, I say close this as invalid.  If anybody does anything to change Sage here, they will just make things incompatible with Python, which is a bad, bad idea.   Python has already made this design choice, and we have to live with it.
