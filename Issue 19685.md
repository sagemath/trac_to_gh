We have

```
sage: ComplexIntervalField(64).an_element() + RealIntervalField(128).an_element()
1 + 1*I
sage: parent(_)
Complex Interval Field with 64 bits of precision
```

But

```
sage: ComplexIntervalField(128).an_element() + RealIntervalField(64).an_element()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: unsupported operand parent(s) for '+'
```

The above should work with parent `ComplexIntervalField(64)`.

This comes from

```
sage: RIF.construction()
(Completion[+Infinity], Rational Field)
sage: CIF.construction() is None
True
```


In contrast to

```
sage: CC.construction()
(AlgebraicClosureFunctor, Real Field with 53 bits of precision)
sage: RR.construction()
(Completion[+Infinity], Rational Field)
```


So implementing the construction for `ComplexIntervalField` should (I hope so at least) also fix the original problem, since then there is a common starting point for the pushout (namely `QQ`) and the two `CompletionFunctor` and the `AlgebraicClosureFunctor` can be applied on it.
