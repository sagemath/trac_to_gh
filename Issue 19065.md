Hello,

> I am ok with the stopgap. But I would like more consensus from developers. The most problem I have is that it is very intrusive

Well, it pops out absolutely everywhere because this bug is very very bad, and can generate wrong results absolutely everywhere.

> Another option, would be to move some of the commits from #19016 here (e.g. it would at least avoid the error on polyhedron). At the same time it will decrease the complexity of #19016 which is good. What do you think?

I think that it would make 1000x more sense to create a new ticket entitled "some new hash functions" (or something) and move your commits there rather than here. Splitting #19016 into subtickets does make sense, but I do not see a reason to merge it with this one.

Which you can also flag as 'blocker' if this is what you are after?...

I think the consensus was that this is a different issue: equality isn't transitive *across different parents*, and hence "equal => equal hash" cannot hold.

My position with the stopgap is pretty simple: if you know that there is a bug in the software that you develop, a bug that may make the user's code return bad answer, *do you tell the users*?

Of course the bug did not appear yesterday, but today we know it exists.

And you don't tell the users? That's irresponsible.

It would be irresponsible if trac were secret.  Like the bug trackers that Matlab, Maple, mathematica, and Magma use. 

But I know for a fact that Sage has hundreds (maybe thousands) of bugs.  That doesn't mean that every time you start Sage it should show a big message about that.

Do you seriously expect them to come here and figure it out?

Or is the whole point of not having a stopgap to *not have them know* and, thus, not worry?

It's funny how we have to explain everything in docstrings or users get it wrong, and on the other hand we expect to figure out hash issues by themselves while browsing the developer's manual. Bullshit.

> Maybe not in the most easily accessible place, but I feel like I've been aware of this ever since I started using Sage.

You are a developer. As William for the developers/users ratio.

> Anyway: yes, something should be fixed, but no, I don't think it's urgent enough to print disconcerting warnings that make people think Sage is broken.

WTF. Sage *IS* broken. Don't you get it? Having to display a stopgap is a very bad thing, because it worries users, and what we have to do against it is not hide the stopgaps but FIX THE BUGS.

I could care less about impressing you.

I'm -1 to this stopgap in sage-6.9.  I'm +1 to this being merged at the beginning of sage-6.10 and fixed in sage-6.10.

Since you want a review from me: -1

Warnings need to be specific. There are lots of elements that have canonical representations, there hashing it is definitely a bit hacky but perfectly valid. 

There is definitely room for improvement, but it skirts a bit the line of design choice with hashes and coercion.

Attach the stopgap to finitely presented group elements if you want, or fix it in sage-6.10.

You cannot really demand the second part ("fixed in sage-6.10"). Basically, at the end of the 6.10 release cycle, you might easily end up in the same situation as now. So any argument to not add the stopgap now is also a valid argument to not add the stopgap in the next release.

Grow a sense of responsibility. You know what lies ahead? We all get used to return wrong results and do not care anymore.
