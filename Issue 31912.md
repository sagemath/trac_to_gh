Nice. Perhaps we could document the additivity/multiplicativity with a random doctest?

Thanks for the comment.

This is also related to the chain polynomial, namely equal to

```
1 - P.chain_polynomial()(-1)
```

according to Example 2.3.c of the given reference.

EDIT: and therefore also equal to 

```
P.zeta_polynomial()(1)
```


EDIT:

your `FindStat` remark can be seen a consequence of the property that

```
sage: g = P.incomparability_graph().complement()                                  
sage: g.clique_polynomial()
```

gives the chain_polynomial of P.
