# Issue 16824: Posets.DiamondPoset, some corrections

Issue created by migration from Trac.

I think that `Posets.DiamondPoset()` should have `facade=True` as default, see #17051.

Also `Posets.DiamondPoset(2)` returns empty poset, `DiamondPoset(1)` gives error message. Should they both just complain about wrong argument?

Oh I see. You could have fixed that in the PentagonPoset ticket.
