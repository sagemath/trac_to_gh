# Issue 21385: Pari no longer builds on systems where "." is not in the Perl path.

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: charpent

Original creation time: 2016-10-02 00:20:04

Keywords: pari perl

Building pari depends on "." being in the Perl path, which is no longer the case in at least Debian. See attached log and [this thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-release/gPJzDIKgkbM).

Parking this here until I (or someone else) can deal with it. The behavior was introduced by debian changes to perl in advance. Therefore debian has to patch its own pari package.

Looks like an upstream patch too, so we probably can cherrypick it from pari's git tree.

Note that #21582 also bumps the PARI version. There should be no conflict since both tickets make the same change to `package-version.txt`.
