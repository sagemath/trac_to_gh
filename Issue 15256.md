`sage.rings.qqbar.ANRoot._interval_fast()` creates new interval fields by `type(self._interval.parent())(prec)`, thus bypassing the cache provided by `RealIntervalField()`. Computations with algebraic numbers sometimes need gigabytes of memory to store these parents and the associated coercion structures.

The best (natural) example I have is ,using [ore_algebra](http://www.risc.jku.at/research/combinat/software/ore_algebra/index.php):

```
sage: from ore_algebra import *; R.<n> = QQ[]; A.<Sn> = OreAlgebra(R)
sage: rec = (n^2+10*n+24)*Sn^6 + (-16*n-64)*Sn^4 + (-4*n-14)*Sn^3 + 64*Sn^2 + 32*Sn
sage: rec.generalized_series_solutions(1, infolevel=5)
```

I just tried your example with version 0.1 of ore_algebra (from the RISC homepage), but got an error:

```
sage: rec.generalized_series_solutions(1, infolevel=5)

Maybe you did use a more recent version of ore_algebra?

You are right, my example did not work with ore_algebra 0.1 (I used a development version that does not seem to be publicly available yet).

Hi Marc,

To mention a trac ticket, use :trac:`15493` instead of #15493. That way, there is a nice hyperlink in the documentation!

Once that done, it is ready for positive review.
