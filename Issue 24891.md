CC:  vdelecroix

Keywords: gmpy2

Currently `py_scalar_to_element` function (`coerce.pyx`) didn't convert `gmpy2 numbers`.
`py_scalar_to_element` should work with `gmpy2` the same way it work with `numpy`.

Why `MPZ_Check(x)` instead of `type(x) is gmpy2.mpz`? There is nothing really wrong with `MPZ_Check` but all other places in Sage use the `type` check. For example in `src/sage/rings/complex_double.pyx`:

If you use only type checks, you can also remove the `import_gmpy2`.
