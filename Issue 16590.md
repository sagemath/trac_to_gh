I know this isn't part of this ticket, but there is a long-standing problem with preparsing that should be easy to fix: if you happen to give a file the same name as a Python module (which is not hard to do; I've seen people use "new.sage" and "socket.sage" before), then the preparsed file can shadow the actual Python module. I think a patch like this ought to fix it:

Alternatively, there is another approach at #11821, which also might prevent the race conditions discussed here: don't write the preparsed output to a file, just use standard output.
