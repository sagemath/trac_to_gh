# Issue 30275: Very small typo in Kerr_Schild.ipynb comments

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/30512

Original creator: rrogers

Original creation time: 2020-09-05 19:45:55

CC:  â€‹egourgoulhon

Keywords: Sagemanifolds Kerr_Schild.ipnb

In Kerr_Schild.ipynb about input [13] we have the following markup.


```latex

Check of the identity  
  
\frac{x^2 + y^2}{r^2 + a^2} + \frac{z^2}{r^2} = 1    

```


Which should be: 
 {{{#!latex

Check of the identity  

\frac{x^2 + y<sup>2}{R</sup>2 + a^2} + \frac{z<sup>2}{R</sup>2} = 1

}}}

I could submit a revised .inynb but that seems excessive

It seems like this change is not needed? See https://ask.sagemath.org/question/53303/typo-in-sagemanifolds-worksheet/.
