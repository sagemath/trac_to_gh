`typing` is a standard Sage package but it is also included in Python 3.7 standard library. This module is not compatible with Python > 3.5 (for example it breaks pytest). We should disable its installation when Sage is built with Python 3.

Not a very elegant fix but I think that's just the limitations of SPKGs. So, this looks good to me. I cannot test it because I have no Python 3 [SageMath](SageMath) installed. If you're confident that this works, feel free to set this to positive review.

There is another way.  With an `spkg-configure.m4`, in I believe the third argument to [https://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/tree/m4/sage_spkg_configure.m4 SAGE_SPKG_CONFIGURE` you can pass a check for whether the package is even required.

It's not well documented how to do this, but if you set sage_require_typing=no in this check then it won't require installation of the package (it will just be treated as a dummy package).
