Keywords: partitions, global options

Currently the following breaks:

```
sage: P = Partitions(5, max_length=4)
sage: loads(dumps(P))
```

since `PartitionOptions` does not pickle, hence the `IntegerListsLex`, which takes it as an (optional) input, does not.

The proposed solution is two-fold:

- Add a class for partitions that inherit from `IntegerListsLex` (or use it as an iterator).
- Add a warning when using the `global_options` parameter that the resulting class might not pickle.

Here's also a discussion on sage-combinat-devel:

I'm also going to add parent classes for k-regular partitions.
