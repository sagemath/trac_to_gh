We should have


```
    def FibonacciTree(self, n):
        r"""                                                                    
        Returns the graph of the Fibonacci Tree `F_{i}` of order `n`.           
        `F_{i}` is recursively defined as the a tree with a root vertex         
        and two attached child trees `F_{i-1}` and `F_{i-2}`, where             
        `F_{1}` is just one vertex and `F_{0}` is empty.                        
                                                                                
        INPUT:                                                                  
                                                                                
        - ``n`` - the recursion depth of the Fibonacci Tree                     
                                                                                
        EXAMPLES::

            True                                                                
            sage: l1 = [ len(graphs.FibonacciTree(_)) + 1 for _ in range(6) ]   
            sage: l2 = list(fibonacci_sequence(2,8))

```


And for the docstring of `HoffmanSingletonGraph()`, we should have


```
        Note that you get a different layout each time you create the graph. ::
                                                                                
            sage: HS.layout()[1]                                                
            (-0.844..., 0.535...)                                               
            sage: graphs.HoffmanSingletonGraph().layout()[1]                    
            (-0.904..., 0.425...)
```


Note the double colon "::".
