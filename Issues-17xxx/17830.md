Comparison of embedded number field elements should be identical to the comparison of the embedding. In other words, we should have:

```
sage: x = polygen(ZZ)
sage: K.<cbrt2> = NumberField(x^3 - 2, embedding=AA.polynomial_root(x^3-2, RIF(0,3)))
sage: 6064/4813 < cbrt2 < 90325/71691
True
```
This has been done in #13213 for quadratic number fields. This ticket aims to implement this for all number fields by storing into the parent a list of interval approximations of the generator.

This concerns only real embeddings.

To go further, one should consider:
- having a fast evaluation of integer polynomial with real intervals (mpfi elements) input
- make better interaction with QQbar (see also #18103 and #18104)

<a id='comment:7'></a>The two failing doctests come from the introduction of the method `_real_mpfi_`. I just propose to get rid of it in this ticket. The main reason is that there are a lot of duplication between:
- AA and QQbar
- RLF and CLF
- what is implemented in this ticket for number fields

I propose to clean it up in ticket #18103 and add the `_real_mpfi_` feature there.

Then what? There is no way to test `_init_embedding_approx` that initialize private attributes. For sure we can duplicate doctests from `_get_embedding_approx` or even write

```
TESTS::

if it makes you happier. But I am not happy with that. If you have any **constructive** suggestion I would be happy to hear it.
