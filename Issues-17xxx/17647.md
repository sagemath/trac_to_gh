This patch implements a branch and bound algorithm for computing the vertex separation of directed graphs. It can be significantly faster than other methods already implemented. Furthermore, it can handle graphs with more than 31 vertices, but of course the computation time could be long.

```
sage: from sage.graphs.graph_decompositions import vertex_separation as VS
sage: D = digraphs.RandomDirectedGNP(30,.1)
sage: %time w,l = VS.vertex_separation(D); print w
4
CPU times: user 229 ms, sys: 345 ms, total: 574 ms
Wall time: 575 ms
sage: %time w,l = VS.vertex_separation_BAB(D); print w
4
CPU times: user 1.34 ms, sys: 32 Âµs, total: 1.37 ms
Wall time: 1.35 ms
```

Actually, static dense graph is used only in `independent_sets.pyx`, right? and in this code, we can see many cast to `mp_limb_t*`.
I think we could, in another patch, change the static dense graphs to use my data structure. This way we could clean the independent set code (remove all cast operations) and enable a direct access to bitset operations.

Hello David,

Here are some superficial changes. It's faster to implement them than to write a long comment. Fix anything that you don't agree with.

I am not done with the review, but I worry a bit about the fact that you allocate memory in a recursive function. They can cost a lot, these things. Do you see a clean way to avoid that ?

Also, I did some profiling on your code and it seems that the most time-consuming operations is the call to popcount. I do not know where it is needed yet, but if you know how to work around that you would probably earn some perf.

Tell me what you think,

Nathann

I have just fixed a small typo.\n \n> I am not done with the review, but I worry a bit about the fact that you allocate memory in a recursive function. They can cost a lot, these things. Do you see a clean way to avoid that ?\n\nI already though about it and I don't have a \"clean\" method to propose. I could for instance allocate one for all 5 arrays of n bitsets each and access to the bitsets of level *level* since the BAB has depth at most n. This way we avoid multiple allocations.\nIf you think it is OK, I can implement it.\n\n \n> Also, I did some profiling on your code and it seems that the most time-consuming operations is the call to popcount. I do not know where it is needed yet, but if you know how to work around that you would probably earn some perf.\n\nWhat's the magic commande to profile this code? %prun is not working here.\n\nThe speed of the `bitset_len` method depends on the system. Since patch #13352, we use the mpn methods for popcount which is expected to use `__builtin_popcount`. I don't know how fast it is on my laptop. I'll check as soon as you give me the magic command ;)\n\nThanks,\nDavid.",

Nice. I have just fixed a small typo.

I already though about it and I don't have a "clean" method to propose. I could for instance allocate one for all 5 arrays of n bitsets each and access to the bitsets of level *level* since the BAB has depth at most n. This way we avoid multiple allocations.
If you think it is OK, I can implement it.

 
> Also, I did some profiling on your code and it seems that the most time-consuming operations is the call to popcount. I do not know where it is needed yet, but if you know how to work around that you would probably earn some perf.

What's the magic commande to profile this code? %prun is not working here.

The speed of the `bitset_len` method depends on the system. Since patch #13352, we use the mpn methods for popcount which is expected to use `__builtin_popcount`. I don't know how fast it is on my laptop. I'll check as soon as you give me the magic command ;)

Thanks,
David.

Using bitsets that would mean dozens of allocations lines again. What is it that you use in those fast digraphs of yours that are not in the 'binary matrix' type ? Possibly the best is to implement it there and use the binary matrices?

Run a long command, then type 'perf top' in a console. You'll love it.

I will probably write a "profiling tutorial" soon. It would be cool if you were willing to review it. That will be helpful, along with the "interface C code with Sage" tutorial.

should be something like that

```
cdef bitset_t * bitset_pool = <bitset_t *>sage_malloc(5 * n * sizeof(bitset_t))
for i from 0 <= i < 5*n:
    bitset_init(bitset_pool[i], n)
...
...
for i from 0 <= i < 5*n:
    bitset_free(bitset_pool[i])
sage_free(bitset_pool)
```

 
> What is it that you use in those fast digraphs of yours that are not in the 'binary matrix' type ? Possibly the best is to implement it there and use the binary matrices?

I'm using extensively `bitset_union, bitset_difference, bitset_discard, bitset_add, bitset_len, bitset_first`.
What you propose is to recode what has already been properly implemented for bitsets into the binary matrix type. For instance, in module `static_dense_graph.pyx`, we have code like that:

```
            # The intersection of the common neighbors of i and j is a AND of
            # their respective rows. A popcount then returns its cardinality.                  
            inter = 0
            for l in range(m.width):
                inter += __builtin_popcountl(m.rows[i][l] & m.rows[j][l])
```

Seriously, it would be much cleaner to use bitsets for rows and to call `bitset_len`.

As I said previously, my suggestion is more to change the `static_dense_graph` data_structure to use directly `bitset_t` for rows.

According some discussions on the mailing lists, we have some profiling experts that could be of more help than me. I can have a look anyway to tell if it is dummy's level ;)

With bitsets you cannot do this very computation without allocating a third bitset. 

Okay, let's say that it is not important: could you turn/extend your `fast_digraph` into a bitset matrix ? You can overwrite the current one if you like, nobody but me uses it anyway. This way it would work with bitsets, and you could allocate this matrix of bitsets in one instruction without having to handle the memory allocation problems in your branch and bound code.

We agree if you actually talk of changing the 'binary_matrix' type, which is then used by the static dense graph stuff.

`O_o`

Try it on a real machine. That will give you a reason to install some real OS `:-P`

The problem with 'profiling experts' is that they don't review those patches, and if nobody does it everybody loses.

Hello,

I'm now using a pool of bitsets. I add to use type `bitset_s *`, but it's working and indeed a bit faster (try with G = graphs.MycielskiGraph(5)).

About changing the `static_dense_graph` structure to use directly bitsets, should I do it in this patch or in another patch? 

It's a pitty I don't have this perf top command on mac. In fact it is not installed on my linux desktop :(

Best,

Good news !

Could you do it in another patch, then rebase this ticket on top of it ? This way we will not have to discuss code that will be changed afterwards.

OK, I will work on it.
I will certainly need your help to understand the procedure to "rebase this ticket on top of the other one" ;)

I don't have it installed on my linux desktop(s), and since I don't know the package name, yum returns me hundreds of possible packaged containing the keyword "perf".

Yo!

Easy. Let us say that this ticket is a branch A. Once the other branch will be written, name it B.

git checkout A
git rebase -i B

After this your branch A will be above B.

> I don't have it installed on my linux desktop(s), and since I don't know the package name, yum returns me hundreds of possible packaged containing the keyword "perf".

In debian it is in the package linux-tools.

Nathann,

I tried to do what you proposed. I don't know if the result is correct or not with regards git.
If it is not the case, please help me going back to the state before the rebase.

I should certainly add a dependency with ticket #17665, right?

David.

Hello,

> I tried to do what you proposed. I don't know if the result is correct or not with regards git.

It is not. If you click on 'commits' right next to the branch, you will see that some commits appear twice (like 'trac #17647: small typo')

> If it is not the case, please help me going back to the state before the rebase.

It is very difficult for me to tell you what to do now, considering that I have no idea how you ended up with this branch in the first place. It seems that all you did wrong was to merge two branches together in the end (you merged a branch with a copy of that branch, apparently). So I would say that all you need to do is to go back before that happened, i.e.:

```
git checkout 30f80f1c4158b512310cde25b32d311a92220e2e # go back to 'trac #17647: rebase on 17665 to use binary_matrix'
git push trac HEAD:public/17647 -f # update the distant branch
```

Please double-check that, for it will erase commits from the trac server.

> I should certainly add a dependency with ticket #17665, right?

Yes.

Hello!

A first pass:

- Some modifications that you did to the header of `fast_digraph.pyx` should be
  undone now that you use `binary_matrix`.

- I do not know whether `positions` is actually needed in this code, but I still
  do not understand it totally. It seems that you enumerate all permutations,
  cutting branches from time to time: the code is in its principle very similar
  from the bandwidth code that was recently included. That code does not need
  such an array: do you think that it could also be removed from here?

- in `_my_invert_positions`: you cannot in C, but in Cython you can do
  `a,b=b,a`.

- ``best_seq`` has no reason to be a C array. If you turn it into a Python list,
  you will remove several lines of alloc/dealloc code.

- Not worth changing it now, but try to use <code>:class:\`class_name\`</code> instead of
  <code>\`\`class_name\`\`</code> in the doc.

- Can you document the parameters taken by `vertex_separation_BAB_C` ? `bm_pool`
  is not that self-explaining (what are its dimensions? its role?)

- Do you really need both `current_prefix` and `current_other`? They seem to be
  the complement of each other at all times.

- What about removing "current" from
  `loc_b_current_prefix,loc_b_current_neighborhood,loc_b_current_other,b_current_prefix,b_current_neighborhood,b_current_other,current_prefix`?
  It seems to me that `b_prefix, b_prefix_neighborhood`, `b_nonprefix` would be
  equally meaningful and 'lighter' to read?

- It seems that `current_cost` is the cost of `best_seq`. What about
  `best_cost`?

- `order = [int_to_vertex[best_seq[i]] for i in range(n)]` is better than

```
cdef list order = list()
for 0 <= i < n:
   order.append(int_to_vertex[best_seq[i]])
```

- Instead of `somemore`, use a `break` if `select_it is False`.

I don't see how.
This code is different from the `bandwidth` one because I have the greedy steps. 
Using the `positions` array, I know exactly where are the vertices in the array `current_prefix` (now `prefix`). This way I don't have to undo the permutations when I track back or after a recursive call.
So yes it is possible to get rid of this array, but the price is to undo all permutations which is particularly painful with the greedy steps.
I definitively prefer my solution.

I don't see how to use it here.

But if it is a Python list, method `vertex_separation_BAB_C` has to return both the value and that list. How would that be more efficient than passing a pointer and updating the content of the array when needed ?

I added some documentation. Let me know if it is enough.

Right, `current_other` is not used at all. Removed.

I have remove `current_` from many variables.

`current_cost`is the cost of the current prefix. Therefore, I think the name is appropriate.

I had to find another way since I had a for loop inside a while loop. Furthermore, the condition `if select_it is False then break` is incorrect in this case.
Now I have removed the for loop and I only have the while without break.
 

Thanks,
David.

```
source_pos = positions[i]
j = prefix[target_pos]
prefix[target_pos],prefix[source_pos] = prefix[source_pos], prefix[target_pos]
positions[i],positions[j] = positions[j],positions[i]
```

It could be made simpler if the code of `_my_invert_positions` was taking two positions (or two vertices) as argument instead of 'one of each type'.

> But if it is a Python list, method `vertex_separation_BAB_C` has to return both the value and that list. 

```
e = [1,2,3]
def invert_two_entries(l):
   l[0],l[1] = l[1],l[0]
invert_two_entries(e)
print e # prints [2, 1, 3]
```

> How would that be more efficient than passing a pointer and updating the content of the array when needed ?

It is not about efficiency, it is about not allocating/deallocating something if it can be avoided. This table is updated very rarely, so it does not have to be a C array.

> Now I have removed the for loop and I only have the while without break.

Great! I'll resume the review.

Helloooooo again,

- What is the purpose of `lower_bound`? The documentation says that the code is
  trying to find an ordering whose cost is *lower* than `lower_bound`? On what
  exactly is it a lower bound?

  Do you mean that the code will "return any ordering whose cost is lower than
  `lower_bound`, even if it has no proof that it is optimal?

- Do you think that you actually need `loc_b_neighborhood`? It feels like all
  you need is what you store in `bits_tmp`, i.e. the union of the prefix and the
  neighborhood. And you could drop one of your two tmp bitets.

- Are those two lines needed?

```
delta_i = max(current_cost, delta_i)
if delta_i < upper_bound:
```

  It seems that you can already suppose that `current_cost<upper_bound`, and you
  checked several lines above that `delta_i < upper_bound`.

- I do not agree with this comment

```
if upper_bound <= lower_bound:
  # Either we have optimal solution, or we are satisfied with
  # current solution.
```

  it seems that this code only deals with the case when 'we are satisfied with
  the current solution'.

- Is there any reason why you did not expose your function in the main
  `vertex_separation` function? If you do, is there any reason why it should not
  be the default one? (if it is faster?..). Finally, note that if you do make it
  the default some doctests of your functions will have to be updated, as you
  would be comparing the BAB function with `vertex_separation` (which would also
  call the BAB).

With those comments and those from my previous message, I would say that my
review is finished. We only have to settle those last remarks.

Thanks for your work!

Nathann

Apparently your care a lot about reducing mallocs.

I changed it.

Exactly.
With parameter `upper_bound`, you ask for a solution with width less than `upper_bound` if such a solution exists.
With parameter `lower_bound`, you say that you are satisfied with any solution with width less than this bound. This is useful in particular when you split the input digraph into strongly connected components and solve the problem on each of them. If one component has width `k`, you don't care if another component has width `k-1` since you know that the vertex separation of the entire digraph is at least `k`.

This will be useful when we will start adding pre-processing.

I succeed to remove it. I have changed the name of some variables and updated the size of `bm_pool`accordingly.

If we reduce the upper bound during the recursive call of the kth element of the list, we want to prune (cut) branches that are no longer useful.
So yes, these lines are needed.

Yep, I have many reasons for not exposing the BAB in the main `vertex_separation` function yet.
1. this patch is already quite long and technical. Since you often complain about patch bombs, I did my best to decompose the work
2. I plan to add pre-processing rules. The first one is to decompose the input digraph into strongly connected components, but I have others, more complex. I will work on this part only when the BAB will be finalized (including memoization of prefixes). I believe its better to wok this way.

Hello,

Having a short code that only does what is needed helps a lot when you try to understand someboy else's code.

Okay I understand. That helps when you split your first graph into subproblems. This being said, the term `lower_bound` seems to indicate that the user can provide a lower bound on the optimal value of the graph, which confused me when I read code that dealt with returning any "solution below the lower bound". What would you think of renaming it to something like "accept_any_below=4"? That's the best keyword I found, but if you have in mind something which could represent a bit better what it does... I find this name confusing.

Oh I see. I had not noticed that `upper_bound` was updated at every loop. Consequently, wouldn't it be better to do something like that instead?

```
if delta_i >= upper_bound:
    break
<continue exploring>
```

Okay, as you like. As long as you plan to do it in the short future, you can manage the patches as you like.

> Okay I understand. That helps when you split your first graph into subproblems. This being said, the term `lower_bound` seems to indicate that the user can provide a lower bound on the optimal value of the graph, which confused me when I read code that dealt with returning any "solution below the lower bound". What would you think of renaming it to something like "accept_any_below=4"? That's the best keyword I found, but if you have in mind something which could represent a bit better what it does... I find this name confusing.

It is used for both usage: If a lower bound is known, then the user can provide it to the BAB to stop if a solution reaches this bound. It can also be used to say "I'm happy with any solution with cost less than k".

I propose to rename it `cut_off` as for shortests paths algorithms.
I have updated the doc and tests accordingly

Right, done.
