This ticket aims at cleaning `runsnake()` function to:
- update the installation documentation
- check that runsnakerun is installed before failing silently
- behave consistently with the state of the preparser

Thanks for the pointer, i did not see it.

This ticket adresses different (and more trivial) issues (doc, preparsing, checks) that do not require to wait for a `wxPython` spkg to be created. It can be merged soon, and rebasing #14414 on this one when it becomes ready should not be hard. Actually, this ticket was first related to #17689 so that we have a simple installation procedure somewhere.

OK, it's also possible to repurpose #14414 for providing the infrastructure to install runsnake in sage itself.

In that case, you would need to do something along the lines of [[#14414 comment:23](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/14414#comment:23)] because checking if runsnake is available and then invoking it in an inappropriate fashion is not an improvement. I have tested that the following works for me (the code on the #14414 comment needed some adjustments)

```
    ...
    import os, subprocess
    cProfile.runctx(preparse(command.lstrip().rstrip()), get_main_globals(), locals(), filename=tmpfile)
    if os.path.exists(os.path.join(os.environ['SAGE_LOCAL'],'bin','runsnake')):
        subprocess.call(["runsnake",tmpfile])
    else:
        os.system("""sh -c "
          LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$SAGE_ORIG_LD_LIBRARY_PATH; export LD_LIBRARY_PATH
          if [ `uname` = 'Darwin' ]; then
              DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$SAGE_ORIG_DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
          fi
          unset PYTHONHOME
          unset PYTHONPATH
          runsnake %s
        "    
        """%tmpfile)

```
I really need all of PYTHONHOME, PYTHONPATH, LD_LIBRARY_PATH reset.

Failure depends on `/usr/bin/python` and `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/python` being binary incompatible, so this is something that needs to be tested on a bunch of platforms.

I can help testing/reviewing if you're ok with that approach (but we need to test on multiple platforms).

Why not.

> I really need all of PYTHONHOME, PYTHONPATH, LD_LIBRARY_PATH reset.

I like the `sage-native-execute` approach of Jeroen since it solves the issue for other similar calls, and i wonder whether we could also take the opportunity to also reset the `PATH` to `$SAGE_ORIG_PATH` there.

Looking at the implementation of sage.misc.sage_ostools.have_program, we might want to change:

```diff
-           if os.access(os.path.join(p, program), os.X_OK):
+           pth=os.path.join(p, program)
+           if os.path.isfile(pth) and os.access(pth, os.X_OK):
```
since `os.access(..., os.X_OK)` might return true for a directory and yet this would not be picked up as an executable by the operating system.
