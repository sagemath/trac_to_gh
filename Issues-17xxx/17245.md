It claims to take a list of triples `(i, j, entry in row i and column j)`, but it actually takes a dictionary `(i, j): entry in row i and column j`.

I have fixed the error where it appears (integer, rational and mod-n matrices). Are there any other classes where this doc makes sense?

EDIT: Now that I am looking at this again, it worries me that matrix classes for matrices over QQ, ZZ and Zmod(n) ignore the `coerce` and `copy` attributes. The idea might be that integers, rationals and ints mod n do not need to be coerced -- but I don't think this is the case (particularly ints mod n); and that integers, rationals and ints mod n do not need to be copied because they are already immutable -- but the `copy` attribute does not copy the entries, but copies the *list/dict* of entries, and that is always mutable.
This is not fixed here.

They are ignored indeed, but it the safe direction: the code acts if both `copy` and `coerce` are True.

That should be something like this:

```
        - ``entries`` -- can be one of the following:

          * a Python dictionary whose items have the
            form ``(i, j): x``, where ``0 <= i < nrows``,
            ``0 <= j < ncols``, and ``x`` is coercible to
            an integer.  The ``i,j`` entry of ``self`` is
            set to ``x``.  The ``x``'s can be ``0``.
          * Alternatively, entries can be a list of *all*
            the entries of the sparse matrix, read
            row-by-row from top to bottom (so they would
            be mostly 0).
