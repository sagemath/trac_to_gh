It claims to take a list of triples `(i, j, entry in row i and column j)`, but it actually takes a dictionary `(i, j): entry in row i and column j`.

I have fixed the error where it appears (integer, rational and mod-n matrices). Are there any other classes where this doc makes sense?

EDIT: Now that I am looking at this again, it worries me that matrix classes for matrices over QQ, ZZ and Zmod(n) ignore the `coerce` and `copy` attributes. The idea might be that integers, rationals and ints mod n do not need to be coerced -- but I don't think this is the case (particularly ints mod n); and that integers, rationals and ints mod n do not need to be copied because they are already immutable -- but the `copy` attribute does not copy the entries, but copies the *list/dict* of entries, and that is always mutable.
This is not fixed here.
