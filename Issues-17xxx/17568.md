We enable the syntax `FiniteField((p, n), ...)`
as a synonym for `FiniteField(p^n, ...)`
to create a finite field with `p^n` elements.

I definitely prefer `FiniteField((p, n))` rather than `FiniteField(p, n)`.  Here the tuple `(p, n)` is taking the place of the integer `p^n` to save some factoring time.  In `FiniteField(p, n)` the `n` is a positional argument in a slot that is usually the variable name.  How do you specify the variable name if you want to use this syntax?  Yes, it's possible to parse all this, but `GF((p, n))` is simple enough.

I'll also note that factoring the order is a small fraction of the time spent in constructing the field (unless the prime is quite large):

I don't know why the 2nd slot it "usually" the primitive element name.
E.g. we have `PolynomialRing(QQ, 2, 'alpha0')`. Make it the 3rd slot, or a keyword arg.
Putting extra pair of brackets around `p,n` is very wrong to me.
