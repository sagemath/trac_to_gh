Another possibility would be `FiniteField((p, n))`.

Discussed at ticket:31686#comment:8 which led to
opening #31709 (duplicate of this ticket).

I definitely prefer `FiniteField((p, n))` rather than `FiniteField(p, n)`.  Here the tuple `(p, n)` is taking the place of the integer `p^n` to save some factoring time.  In `FiniteField(p, n)` the `n` is a positional argument in a slot that is usually the variable name.  How do you specify the variable name if you want to use this syntax?  Yes, it's possible to parse all this, but `GF((p, n))` is simple enough.

I'll also note that factoring the order is a small fraction of the time spent in constructing the field (unless the prime is quite large):

I don't know why the 2nd slot it "usually" the primitive element name.
E.g. we have `PolynomialRing(QQ, 2, 'alpha0')`. Make it the 3rd slot, or a keyword arg.
Putting extra pair of brackets around `p,n` is very wrong to me.

Raising an error in this case is fine.

Maybe add an example or two to
the [main finite field documentation](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/finite_rings/sage/rings/finite_rings/finite_field_constructor.html)?
