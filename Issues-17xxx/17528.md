Yop !

Hmmmm... To be honest I would sleep better if this constructor was turned into many functions, each of them checking that their input corresponds to the proved construction.... `:-/`

By the way why did you add a triple loop ? Why wouldn't you change the big doctest which begins with `Other constructions for `\lambda > 1`::` with `lambda>=1` instead ?

Just forgot... here it is (and with a clearer construction of the Wilson 1972 paper).

Also: instead of checking that the cosets are disjoint like you do, wouldn't it be simpler/faster to:

1) Take all elements of A
2) Multiply it in any way possible (except by 1) and check that the result is not in A ?

It removes `already_in` and `nb_seen`.

I do not think it works. What you need is to write all elements a_i of A as x^m i_k + j_k^ with j_k < m. Then you need to check that the j_k are different. A possible way to do it along your lines is the following:

```
AA = set(~x*y for x in A for y in A if x != y)
for i in range((v-1)//m):
    if x**(m*i) in AA:
        # bad case
# good case
```
You reduce the iteration over the whole `K` to iteration over `Hm` which is a bit smaller (it has size 2v/k). I will do that.

By the way, `nb_seen` was not needed. It was just to stop the loop as soon as all elements of A are decomposed (instead of enumerating the whole K). The same "trick" is actually used in `singer_difference_set`... the thing is that you know exactly what you are looking for but there is no better way to do it rather then iterating through the whole K.
