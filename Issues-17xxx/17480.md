In

http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/structure/sage/structure/element.html#how-to-define-a-new-element-class ,

I find the descriptions of `_add_` very confusing, because it seems to imply that there are two versions of `_add_`, one of them as a `def` and the other as a `cpdef`. As it stands, it reads as a circular argument.

`def RingElement._add_`: ... You should override `_add_`. .... The default implementation of this function is to call `_add_`.

`cpdef RingElement._add_` ... which will happen if no-one has supplied implementations of either `_add_`

I think that it does not help that Pyrex is still mentioned instead of Cython.

Apart from that, there were several ReST formatting errors.

It's good that you are refreshing this part of the documentation, if only to update references to Pyrex, and instead refer to Cython! Here are three more thoughts.

First, maybe it would be worth pointing to the subtle ways in which these functions differ in names and in nature, by saying for instance:

  There are three relevant functions, with subtly differing names (add vs iadd, single vs double underscores), one of which has both a Python and a Cython version (note the `def` vs `cpdef`).

Then in the paragraph about `_add_`, you could insist once again on the presence of the def and cpdef versions.

Second, in the sentence

  For speed, there are also inplace version of the arithmetic commands.

we want "inplace versions" (plural).

Last, in the sentence

  This is the function you should override to inplace implement addition in a Python subclass of `RingElement`.

I would change "to inplace implement addition" to "to implement inplace addition".

done.

Really? It is already in a `.. warning::` box; what else can we do?
Or are we speaking about different paragraphs?

In any case, I mention `def` and `cpdef` in the heading of the paragraph.

> Second, in the sentence ...


done.

> Last, in the sentence ...


done.

This conflicts with #10779 and, to be safe, it should be rebased on #17533 also.

I also wonder about the statement

```
   .. warning::

      In a *Cython* class, this has to be overridden as a ``cpdef``;
      otherwise, it won't get called. It is especially important to keep
      this in mind whenever you move a class down from Python to Cython.

      In *Python*, this has to be overridden as a ``def``.
```

I doubt that this is true and would simply remove this paragraph.

Merged 6.5.beta6 (containing #10779) and resolved merge conflict.
#17533 does not produce a merge conflict, but merged it anyway to be on the safe side.

So that would mean that the [old documentation](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/structure/sage/structure/element.html#how-to-define-a-new-element-class) mentioning a `def _add_` and a `cpdef _add_` with a similar warning was incorrect, too?

I tried the following:

```
sage: cython_code = """
....: from sage.structure.element cimport RingElement
....: cdef class MyCRingElement(RingElement):
....:    def _add_(self, other):
....:        print "My _add_ is called"
....:        return 0"""
sage: cython(cython_code)
sage: b = MyCRingElement(ZZ)
sage: b._add_(b)
My _add_ is called
0
```

Therefore, I tend to remove the warning, as well as the whole `cpdef` vs. `def` discussion. Before doing so, I'd like to hear other opinions (Samuel?)

I removed the paragraph (and modified the sentence introducing this list).

But perhaps keeping it does cause more confusion, so I'll remove it following your suggestion.

The only thing I'm missing now is that there is no mention at all about `cpdef` functions. Perhaps add a sentence like "when implementing `_add_` in a Cython extension class, use `cpdef _add_` instead".

In other words: it's not *required* to use `cpdef` but still encouraged.
