Somebody needs to hold a reference to `QQ^2` here

```
File "src/doc/en/reference/coercion/index.rst", line 300, in doc.en.reference.coercion.index
Failed example:
    (QQ^2).get_action(QQ)
Expected:
    Right scalar multiplication by Rational Field on Vector space of dimension 2 over Rational Field
Got:
    <repr(<sage.structure.coerce_actions.RightModuleAction at 0x7fe782827628>) failed: RuntimeError: This action acted on a set that became garbage collected>
