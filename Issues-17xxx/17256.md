I just tried something like:

```
        An elliptic curve defined over the Complex Field can not be plotted
        (see :trac:`17256`)::

            sage: E = EllipticCurve(CC, [0,0,1,-1,0])
            sage: E.plot()
            Traceback (most recent call last):
            ...
            NotImplementedError: Plotting of curves over Complex Field with 53 bits of precision not implemented yet
```

but i am not convinced it helps in understanding in any way, since this ticket does not fixes any particular bug, just notices an existing fact. The link to this trac ticket looks misleading. Do you have another way in mind ?
