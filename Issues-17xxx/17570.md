```
In `src/sage/schemes/toric/divisor.py`, there is:

```
class ToricRationalDivisorClassGroup_basis_lattice(FreeModule_ambient_pid):
    def __init__(self, group):
        # ...
        super(ToricRationalDivisorClassGroup_basis_lattice, self).__init__(
            ZZ, group.dimension())
```
(note the `ZZ`)

However, in `src/sage/schemes/toric/divisor_class.pyx`, there is

```
cdef class ToricRationalDivisorClass(Vector_rational_dense):
```

So, do we want rationals or integers? This causes segfaults when improving vectors in #17562.

It is most definitely not the right thing to do in the cone module - a lattice is a free module over integers and not rationals! (On the other hand there is nothing wrong with a vector over rationals related to a cone defined over integers.) I can try to figure out what is the right thing to do here, but not this minute.

<a id='comment:6'>Comment 6:</a>
So, what you really want is a free `ZZ`-module generated by vectors which might have coefficients in `QQ`, is that right?

That's actually legal:

```
sage: M = (ZZ^2).span([(1,1/3),(0,1/2)])
sage: M
Free module of degree 2 and rank 2 over Integer Ring
Echelon basis matrix:
[  1 1/3]
[  0 1/2]
sage: M.base_ring()
Integer Ring
sage: type(M.basis()[0])
<type 'sage.modules.vector_rational_dense.Vector_rational_dense'>
```

So the problem might be solvable by deriving from

```
sage: type(M)
<class 'sage.modules.free_module.FreeModule_submodule_pid_with_category'>
```
instead of `FreeModule_generic_pid`.

This is really a whole can of worms and this toric stuff is just the only place where it is exposed by doctests.

A lot of code in free modules assumes that the `base_ring()` of the parent (i.e. the free module) is the same ring as the ring of coefficients of the elements.
