Finite lattice posets now has `join_irreducibles()` and `join_irreducibles_poset()`. Add `meet_irreducibles()` and `meet_irreducibles_poset()`.

`is_distributive()` is now based on formal definition. It can just check that lattice is graded and that number of both meet- and join-irreducibles equals to rank (=height-1) of the lattice.

Hello !

1) `meet_irreducibles`: you write `len(self.upper_covers())` which calls `upper_covers_iterator` which iterates over all out-neighbors of a vertex of the HasseDiagram before relabelling them as !Poset elements. Why ? All you want to do is check that the outdegree of those points if 1. You could work on the diagram directly.

2) Please add the new functions to the index.

3) You cannot use `$` for latex code there. Use <code>\`</code> instead. In order to check that the doc compiles correctly run `sage -b && sage -docbuild reference/combinat html` and look at the html files produced.

4) Use `()` instead of `\` to wrap code on multiple lines.

I don't mind. It will depend on the reviewers, though.

I will run all tests on a machine to check that removing this keyword does not break anything somewhere.
