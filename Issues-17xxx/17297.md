Many newer PARI functions are not supported for this old PARI finite field implementation and it's slower.

Removing this will be harder since we need to find a solution for older pickles.

When `FiniteField_ext_pari` will be removed in the future, maybe we can write a function that unpickles old `FiniteField_ext_pari` pickles as `FiniteField_pari_ffelt` fields (and similarly for elements)?

Yes, we should certainly try that (after the deprecation period is over).
