The current implementation of `is_cyclotomic()` is either in Python or through the GP interface (when a certificate is required). Replacing all that by a call to Pari would be much faster.

We also implement a new method `is_cyclotomic_product` based on Pari `poliscycloprod`.

Depends on #17631

The idea (proposed by [vdelecroix](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/17695#comment:10)) was to wait for #17631 to be closed in order to avoid to have to manually edit `libs/pari/gen.pyx`. Do you think I shouldn't?

I hope you're not in a hurry :-)

I would say that #17631 is ready, but there is not much point in setting it to needs_review since it is based on #16997. And people don't seem to like #16997 that much since it is about upgrading to a non-released version of PARI. So probably you need to wait for a new PARI release to come out.

Looks good to me.

I have made a review commit:

- moving things around inside `is_cyclotomic` doc
- changing the following behavior: if we ask for a certificate, then pari is used

If you agree with my changes, you can set a positive review

I do not like the fact that some argument forces the other silently. I do prefer the version in which the combination `p.is_cyclotomic(algorithm='sage', certificate=True)` raises an error. I took care of some of your modifications in my commit.

On the other hand, there was a mistake in the previous version: the arguments were not forwarded when the polynomial had coefficients in `QQ`.

Well, I am doing that (where develop is the latest beta):

```
git ch develop -b 17XXX
git pull trac whatever_branch_for_17XXX
```
to get the branch.

If the branch is not based on the latest beta, the merge is forced upon me by git.
This has been working for me very well since long, but maybe I am plain wrong in my use of git.

My branch was based on beta-6.6 and the last beta is the rc0. This is the reason. The thing that I dislike is that it introduces a useless commit in the history. There is nothing bad with branch based on previous beta and instead you can do

```
git fetch trac whatever_branch_for_17XXX
git ch -b 17XXX FETCH_HEAD
```

The alternative is to do the merge as you did. And then, you can rebase your commit on top of mine.

Not that important.
