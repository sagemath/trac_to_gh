As reported on asksage [1], the function `Graph.treewidth` can return incorrect tree decompositions.

```
sage: graphs.PathGraph(10).treewidth(certificate=True).vertices()
[{2}, {1}, {4}, {8, 9}, {8}, {6}, {0}, {3}, {5}, {7}]
```

The computations are actually done right (the width returned is correct), but my attempts to "simplify" the tree while it is being built simplified.. a bit too much.

The way it is done now is a bit more correct, though a tad more ressource-consuming. Nothing important, as the post-processing is infiinitely cheaper than the actual solving anyway.

```
sage: graphs.PathGraph(10).treewidth(certificate=True).vertices()
[{0, 1}, {4, 5}, {1, 2}, {2, 3}, {8, 7}, {8, 9}, {6, 7}, {5, 6}, {3, 4}]
```

Sorry about that.

I just rebased the patch over the latest beta and added a commit to fix that.

It is a rather good news, by the way: it means that the decompositions are smaller than previously.
