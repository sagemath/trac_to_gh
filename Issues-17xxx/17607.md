<div id="comment:10" align="right">Comment 10</div>

Small and big question: First, when I install this on OS X 10.10.3 (using `sage -i python3`), I see

```
configure: WARNING: unrecognized options: --enable-unicode, --disable-toolbox-glue
```
I assume that's minor, but it should probably be cleaned up.

Second, after installing, if I do `sage --python`, I get

```
/Users/palmieri/Desktop/Sage_stuff/git/sage/src/bin/sage-env: line 411: 33785 Abort trap: 6           "$SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/python" -c 'import pkg_resources; pkg_resources.get_distribution("matplotlib").version' 2> /dev/null
Fatal Python error: Py_Initialize: unable to load the file system codec
  File "/Users/palmieri/Desktop/Sage_stuff/git/sage/local/lib/python/encodings/__init__.py", line 123
    raise CodecRegistryError,\
                            ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
/usr/local/bin/sage: line 134: 33763 Abort trap: 6           "$SAGE_ROOT/src/bin/sage" "$@"
```
This breaks Sage completely. I don't mind having an optional package which doesn't build for me, but I don't think we should have one that breaks Sage.
