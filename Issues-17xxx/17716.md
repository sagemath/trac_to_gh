We want to implement asymptotic expressions like (5 * n * 2<sup>n</sup> - 2 * n<sup>2/3</sup> + O(n * log(n))) based on our implementation of asymptotic terms (i.e. objects which contain a growth and possibly some additional information; see ticket #17715) and the MutablePoset data structure (see ticket #17693). 

Basically, an asymptotic expression represents the sum of asymptotic terms. The terms are stored within an MutablePoset, which is helpful for the management of the terms, as absorption of terms (and their predecessors w.r.t. growth) can be handled efficiently. 

For example:
    (n<sup>3</sup> + n<sup>2</sup> + n + 1) + (O(n<sup>2</sup>)) evaluates to (n<sup>3</sup> + O(n<sup>2</sup>)), 
    because the O term absorbs n<sup>2</sup> and its predecessors, which is information that is stored in the MutablePoset.
    
Another more complex example would be:
    (4 * n<sup>2</sup> * t + 3 * n * t<sup>2</sup> + O(n)) + (O(n<sup>2</sup> * t<sup>3/2</sup>)) evaluates to (3 * n * t<sup>2</sup> + O(n<sup>2</sup> * t<sup>3/2</sup>)).
    Here, the MutablePoset behind the term (4 * n<sup>2</sup> * t + 3 * n * t<sup>2</sup> + O(n)) incorporates the relations `n <= 4 * n^2 * t` and `n <= 3 * n * t^2`, whereas the expression (O(n<sup>2</sup> * t<sup>3/2</sup>)) only contains the term n<sup>2</sup> * t<sup>3/2</sup>, and thus the corresponding MutablePoset contains no relations. Adding these two terms translates into merging the two underlying posets. By inserting the term O(n<sup>2</sup> * t<sup>3/2</sup>) into the first poset, new relations `4 * n^2 * t <= n^2 * t^(3/2)` and `n <= n^2 * t^(3/2)` are discovered. 
    As O terms absorb terms of weaker or equal growth, the term 4 * n<sup>2</sup> * t and O(n) are removed from the poset. As noted above, the remaining elements form the asymptotic expression (3 * n * t<sup>2</sup> + O(n<sup>2</sup> * t<sup>3/2</sup>)).
    
Concretely, we plan to implement the elements AsymptoticExpression (with parent AsymptoticRing) whose objects act as described above. 

Within this ticket, a **minimal working prototype** shall be implemented, such that *univariate*, *polynomial* expressions can be handeled.

See meta-ticket #17601 for the planned structure and a roadmap.

<a id='comment:38'></a>Hello Clemens!

I cross-reviewed your changes (they look fine), and here are some answers to your comments:

Replying to [comment:33 cheuberg]:
> I have read the code and the documentation. I have pushed a few reviewer commits (please cross-review). Apart from that, I have a few comments/questions:
> 1. Introductory examples, `A.an_element()`: why is this not tested?


Because this already gives the result of our implementation of `an_element` from #19048. It is tested there.

> 2. `AsymptoticExpression.__init__`: all doctests are indirect; however seeing `simplify` in action as well as a poset might be more interesting.


I copied and adapted a doctest from `_simplify_`.

> 3. `AsymptoticExpression.__pow__`: How difficult would it be to allow the computation of `(y<sup>2)</sup>(3/2)` ?
> 4. `AsymptoticExpression.__pow__`: move powers of asymptotic terms to the respective classes instead of the hack here.


Both 3. and 4. are fixed in #19083: especially the `__pow__`-methods were heavily changed and split.

> 5. `AsymptoticRing`: "TEST": what is the purpose of this test? Isn't all that already tested?


Cannot recall the intention behind this test. Deleted.

> 6. `AsymptoticRing.__classcall__`: the if clause `if names is not None` does not seem to be prepared to multiple generators.


This is because this world works entirely without cartesian products. Our efforts on the "cartesian product" front get merged with the "asymptotic ring" font in #19073.

> 7. `AsymptoticRing.__classcall__`: deal with parameter `category`


The entire `__classcall__` has been rewritten in #19083, categories are handled correctly there.

> 8. `AsymptoticRing.__init__`: include doctests for error conditions.


Done.

> 9. `AsymptoticRing._element_constructor_`: clarify that `data=0` is required if `summands is not None`


Added a similar note as for the element constructor of the growth group.

> 10. `AsymptoticRing._element_constructor_`: doctests for use of `summands`, for error conditions


Done. (And fixed the typo in 'ambiguous' `;-)`)

> 11. `AsymptoticRing._coerce_map_from_`: why is the test `if R == MutablePoset` required?


This is a premature fix for a problem arising in #19083: when passing a `MutablePoset` to the ring such that the element constructor builds an expansion, `coerce_map_from` is called with the class of the poset (as the poset has no parent). Without this, a lot of bad stuff happens.

any thoughts on that?

Apart from that, I reviewed your changes and added two minor reviewer commits.

.. toctree::

could now be removed from `src/doc/en/reference/rings/index.rst` .

But this can wait until one of the follow-up tickets.

And in `src/doc/output/html/en/reference/rings/asymptotic_expansions_index.html`, the very first line could be a pointer towards the introductory material in the asymptotic ring instead of a logical listing starting with the growth group.

Ok (probably #19083).

This is done in #19083.
