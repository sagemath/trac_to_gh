On sage-6.5.beta6 we have

```
sage: R.<x> = ZZ['x']
sage: R(2).xgcd(R(2))   # be prepared to wait
```
It is a problem in our way to use the FLINT function `fmpz_poly_xgcd`. As Bill reported on [this sage-devel thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/pDXdjGVvap8) it does not work for input which are constant polynomials (note that it is already a bit more general that what is indicated in FLINT documentation: *the function assumes that f and g are primitive (have Gaussian content equal to 1). The result is undefined otherwise.*)

Thanks Ralf! I was not enough familiar to FLINT (and it was late after the bug tracking) to write the sample program.

As reported by Bill on [sage-devel](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/pDXdjGVvap8) the only trouble was for constant input. In the commit I just treat this case first in the function xgcd... needs review!
