I find the following strange and confusing:

```
sage: z6 = CyclotomicField(6).gen()
sage: z = 1 - z6
sage: imag(z)
-1/2*sqrt(3)
sage: imag(z).parent()
Symbolic Ring
sage: z.imag()
-1/2*sqrt3
sage: z.imag().parent()
Number Field in sqrt3 with defining polynomial x^2 - 3
```

In my opinion, the function and the method should yield the same result. I'd prefer the number field result.

Component: **number fields**
