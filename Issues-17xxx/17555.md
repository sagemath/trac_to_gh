On a sage-devel thread [1] there seems to be a general agreement that the dev scripts should be kept around for those who use them, but that we should remove the doc so that new users learn 'git trac' or git directly.

The doc has been printing a hint to "not use them" since a while, by the way.

There was a mention left of this "sagedev" scripts. I added a commit to removes it: could anybody review it ? It is quite short.
