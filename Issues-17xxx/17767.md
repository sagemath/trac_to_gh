Since this commit, `misc/darwin_utilities.pyx` (which should only be included on Darwin, see `module_list.py`) is included on all platforms (and, incidentally, fails on cygwin). Should it be moved to a directory of its own?

I concur with sebastien (who I guess also noticed some new modules should be linked to gmp)...
Maybe we could use the `skip_build` thingy from #18145 to solve the darwin thing.

This has indeed been solved by #18145 (see also #17961).

The missing links to gmp are in #17962.
