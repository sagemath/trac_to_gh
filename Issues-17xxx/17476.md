The files `src/sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_template.pxi` and `src/sage/libs/flint/nmod_poly_linkage.pxi` are a mess:
1. They are almost completely undocumented
2. The functions in it cannot be interrupted (see for example #17470)
3. `celement_pow` should really be split up in 2 functions: one for the modular case, one for normal powering
4. This shouldn't be needed:

```
        except OverflowError:
            return Polynomial.__pow__(self, ee, modulus)
```

We should surely have a look at the files organization for p-adics templates as these were written much more recently and possibly in a cleaner way.
