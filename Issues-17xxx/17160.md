This introduce an axiom FinitelyGeneratedAsMagma, as well as related
categories with axioms for magmas, semigroups and groups::

```
    sage: Groups().FinitelyGeneratedAsMagma()
    Category of finitely generated groups
```
For ease of notations, when there is no ambiguity, one can do::

```
    sage: Groups().FinitelyGenerated()
    Category of finitely generated groups
```

One motivation for this change (for #8678) is that finite semigroups
in Sage used to be automatically endowed with an `EnumeratedSets`
structure; the default enumeration is then obtained by iteratively
multiplying the semigroup generators. This forced any finite semigroup
to either implement an enumeration, or provide semigroup generators;
this was often inconvenient.

Instead, finite semigroups that provide a distinguished finite set of
generators with `semigroup_generators` should now explicitly declare
themselves in the category of `FinitelyGeneratedSemigroups`:

```
    sage: Semigroups().FinitelyGenerated()
    Category of finitely generated semigroups
```
This is a backward incompatible change.

I know this isn't set for review yet, but just to note that a finite magma is automatically finitely generated. So I think we should have this reflected in the category structure; in particular, so we don't have lines like this:

```
Parent.__init__(self, category = Semigroups().Finite().FinitelyGenerated())
```

If you need someone to review it, just let me know when this is ready.

As stated in the description, the point of the ticket is precisely to
make a distinction between finite magmas (which are indeed finitely
generated by definition), and finite monoids that are explicitly
endowed with a finite set of generators. The new axiom is about the
latter. So, above, we anyway want something like:

     Semigroups().Finite().XXX()

Granted, the current name of the axiom is misleading, and I am
hesitant about it. I also considered:

    sage: Groups().Finite().WithFiniteSetOfGenerators()
    Category of groups with finite set of generators

It's very explicit but feels like heavy notation; and it does not feel
as appealing as "finitely generated" which immediately rings a bell in
a mathematician's head. Also, it seems to me that being "finitely
generated" is rather useless computationally speaking if no finite set
of generators is provided; so we would not be using that nice name for
a weaker purpose anyway.

I guess that's the main design decision to be taken in this
ticket. The rest is rather straightforward.

Ah, yes, the other design decision is whether it's acceptable to break
backward compatibility. I'll be the first one to be hurt by this
change, and I believe it's worth it ...

Opinions anyone?

Ok, thanks! Darij would be a good candidate to give feedback too!

Cheers,

I think we should make an analogy to `WithBasis` and `FiniteDimensional` by having 2 axioms, `WithGeneratingSet` and `FinitelyGenerated`. This would give `FinitelyGenerated` a purpose, would still allow the current goal of not having to specify the enumeration, and allow the option for infinitely generated objects.

I considered this and I agree that this would have the advantage of
being consistent with the basis things. However I don't see what I
would put in the categories with axiom for `FinitelyGenerated` axiom
besides the subcategories with axioms for `WithGeneratingSet`, so this
looks like overkill. Besides,

	Categories of finitely generated group with generating set

is not great. I am torn.

Opinions anyone else?

I have things that have infinite (enumerable) distinguished generating sets (ex. free group/monoid with generators indexed by `NN` or Yangians #15484), so separating these axioms will be useful. In fact, the enumeration could be done in for the general `WithGeneratingSet` category and would (at least should) error out if the generating set is not enumerable. Although I only know of 1 thing which will be finite dimensional but doesn't come with a distinguished basis. Plus I think we could do an extra case in `_repr_object_names_static` to change the repr into:

```
Category of groups with finite generating set
```

Here's another thought, what about we look at the cardinality of the generating set? So we only have `WithGeneratingSet` which calls `is_finitely_generated`, whose default is to look at the cardinality of the generating set to determine the output of repr. At least that's the only place where I could see us (currently) using the fact that the generating set is finite. For the enumeration, all we really need is the generating set is enumerable. Although I guess we really want to add `EnumeratedSets` to the category heirachy, so this probably is not so useful of an idea...

Another issue: having a distinguished set of generators and being
finitely generated does not necessarily imply that the distinguished
set of generators is finite. So we would actually need three axioms:
"WithGenerators", "FinitelyGenerated", and "WithFiniteGeneratingSet".
So for a finite magma we still would need to do
"Magmas().Finite().WithFiniteGeneratingSet()".

I am not sure this is worth the complication. Especially since we will
have to do something similar for additive magmas, rings, fields, ...

That should be easy indeed.

> Here's another thought, what about we look at the cardinality of the generating set? So we only have `WithGeneratingSet` which calls `is_finitely_generated`, whose default is to look at the cardinality of the generating set to determine the output of repr.

Well, also all the code to build the Cayley graph, to compute
J/R/L-classes, etc. In short all my finite semigroups code :-)

I oppose querying the cardinality, or even just is_finite, for this
can be super expensive if not undecidable. We really want something
declarative here.

> Darij, Aladin, or anyone else, your thoughts?


Yup?

We probably should bring the discussion to sage-dev. As usual this
takes a bit of preparation to have an efficient discussion there.
I'll try to do this soon.
