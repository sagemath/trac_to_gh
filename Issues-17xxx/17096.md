There are some upcoming algebras in Sage (Clifford algebras in #15300, Yangians in #15484, and orthogonal/symplectic basis for Sym #15536; likely others) that would benefit from having a category with common methods.

Depends on #18044

<a id='comment:1'>**Comment 1:**</a>
Some design decisions:

- Every graded algebra is a filtered algebra under the "natural" filtration of summing over (weakly) smaller degrees (assuming total ordering on the grading group). This is implicit in the category structure; nothing specific is implemented.
- Every `graded_*` category has `filtered_*` as an immediate super category. In particular, this is needed for `GradedAlgebrasWithBasis` not picking up `FilteredAlgebrasWithBasis` in its super categories otherwise.
- Homogeneous elements for filtered algebras are elements in F<sub>i</sub> not in F<sub>i-1</sub>. I don't know if this is a standard definition, but it allowed extensions of methods from graded to filtered.

Needs review.

Of course, depending on the context, the converse convention can also
sense; but maybe that's ok because eventually we will have both
filtered and descendingFiltered (or something similar) categories.

> - Every `graded_*` category has `filtered_*` as an immediate super category. In particular, this is needed for `GradedAlgebrasWithBasis` not picking up `FilteredAlgebrasWithBasis` in its super categories otherwise.

This seems like the same situation as for quotients
w.r.t. subquotients. So the same mechanism should do the job (see
`sage.categories.quotients.Quotients.default_super_categories`). Please
confirm!

> - Homogeneous elements for filtered algebras are elements in F<sub>i</sub> not in F<sub>i-1</sub>. I don't know if this is a standard definition, but it allowed extensions of methods from graded to filtered.

I see the point. The inconvenient is of course that this makes the set
of homogeneous elements for a given i not be a vector space. What do
you do with 0 btw?

True, but I figured we'd cross that bridge when we have a need/desire for it.

Raise an error as previously for graded objects saying it doesn't have a well defined degree.

1) What does the `_element_constructor_` in `associated_graded.py` do? I understand that it constructs an element of gr A from an element a of A, but the way it does this I do not think is correct.

The "right" thing to do is this: For a given pair `(a, n)` where `n` is a nonnegative integer and `a` is an element of the `n`-th filtered part of `A`, the residue class of `a` modulo the `(n-1)`-th filtered part of `A` is an element of the `n`-th graded component of `\gr A`. The `n` is part of the input; you can try to reconstruct it as the smallest `i` such that `a` lies in the `i`-th filtered part of `A`, but such a definition will be ill-behaved.

2) I think you need some requirements on the basis of a FilteredModulesWithBasis for your code to work. I would guess you want the basis to be a sequence `(B_0, B_1, B_2, ...)` of sets such that for every `n`, the union `B_0 \cup B_1 \cup ...\cup B_n` is a basis of the `n`-th filtered component. Is it what you want?

Is it what you want?

No, the basis does not have to be ordered with respect to the degree. I also don't see where in the code this is used (I just moved it over from the graded modules, so I may not have looked hard enough).

That `_element_constructor_` definitely shouldn't be a coercion, but even not being a coercion it should be surrounded with big fat warning signs for not being what one would expect.

I don't understand your answer to 2). Even your own doc says that the basis is graded:

```
+ def basis(self, d=None):
+ """
+ Return the basis for (an homogeneous component of) ``self``.
```
This means precisely that the basis elements have nonnegative integers ascribed to them, which stand for something like degree.

Generally, it seems to me that your filtered modules are precisely the same as graded modules, and only the richer "sub"categories (filtered algebras, filtered coalgebras etc.) differ from their graded counterparts. If so, this is a perfectly fine design decision, but it would help to document it explicitly.

You wouldn't expect it to be the canonical linear isomorphism (as modules)? So given some `x + y` in the filtered algebra `A`, you wouldn't expect it to return `x + y` in `gr A`? Instead you'd want it to return only `x` (assuming it has larger degree)? This would be extremely surprising to me (we have a method to remove the lower order terms too).

Well, any (additive) abelian group. Yet I'm not requiring that the `i`-th element of the basis be the only element of degree `i`. Again, an element is homogeneous of degree d if it belongs to F<sub>d</sub> but not F<sub>d-1</sub>. However I am requiring that F<sub>d</sub> is a subspace.

In my (naive) world, filtrations are not really different than grading for modules. That's not to say they aren't useful though because of things like `I`-adic topology (TBH, this is wikipedia talking). However I don't think we need doc on this. Nicolas, do you have any thoughts?

I could add something about the terminology for homogeneous in terms of the filtration if that's non-standard or unclear.

Question, should we make Weyl and Clifford algebras filtered on this ticket or on a followup since that's been closed? Same for group algebras by the length function.

Once again, this is good (I think this is the best we can do explicitly in a CAS, whereas the algebraists' notion of a filtered algebra would be some indiscrete lazy object) -- but this absolutely needs to be doced. This is plainly not the way algebraists think.

Followup, definitely. The ticket has been closed already and I don't think this one will be done too quickly.

I have rewritten the doc to convey *my* understanding of your classes. It will probably have typos and wrong references -- sorry for that, I just can't manage to keep looking at sage categories for longer than a couple hours --, but if you see something that looks seriously wrong to you, chances are I have misunderstood your code and we need to discuss it over. I suspect I am not done with this patch either way, but I am going to return to tableaux and polytopes for a week or so.

I think there should be a one-stop shop in the doc to read up all of the (nonstandard but reasonable!) terminology around filtrations and gradings in Sage. Which should explain what "homogeneous" means for a filtered algebra, etc., and which should be referenced in the method-level and maybe even in the class-level docs. Where do you think such a thing would fit?

Also, there are two doctests failure that this patch incurs for some weird reason:

```
sage -t src/sage/categories/category_with_axiom.py
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/categories/category_with_axiom.py", line 2513, in sage.categories.category_with_axiom.CategoryWithAxiom_singleton
Failed example:
    C.FiniteDimensional()
Expected:
    Category of finite dimensional connected test objects over base ring over Ring of integers modulo 2
Got:
    Category of finite dimensional test objects over base ring over Ring of integers modulo 2
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/categories/category_with_axiom.py", line 2515, in sage.categories.category_with_axiom.CategoryWithAxiom_singleton
Failed example:
    C.Connected()
Expected:
    Category of connected test objects over base ring over Ring of integers modulo 2
Got:
    Category of test objects over base ring over Ring of integers modulo 2
**********************************************************************
```

Also, an easy one:

```
sage -t src/sage/categories/category.py
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/categories/category.py", line 2627, in sage.categories.category.category_graph
Failed example:
    sage.categories.category.category_graph().plot()
Expected:
    Graphics object consisting of 312 graphics primitives
Got:
    Graphics object consisting of 324 graphics primitives
```

[Only a quick look at Clifford -- too swamped with work again.]

You implemented a `graded_algebra` method on the Clifford algebra; but does the algebra it return satisfy the contract of an associated graded algebra? Will it have the `_element_constructor_`, `to_graded_conversion`, `from_graded_conversion` and `projection` methods that allow one to relate its elements to the elements of the Clifford?

Currently there is no such contract (all graded algebras would not satisfy such a contract as well because they return themselves). However the `_element_constructor_` and the natural conversion (projection) comes along for free (at least I believe it should, I didn't explicitly check).

Actually, these were bad ideas. Sorry, I don't think overwriting the `graded_algebra` method does any good, unless the return value is a refinement of what it would normally be (i.e., the `AssociatedGradedAlgebra` of `self`).

For an example why preserving a contract (and having a contract in the first place) is important, let's recall that `gr` is a functor. In fact, every filtration-preserving map `f : A -> B` of filtered modules induces a graded map `gr f : gr A -> gr B` of the associated gradeds. This map `gr f` sends the residue class of any `a \in F_n(A)` (this means the `n`-th filtered part of `A`) to the residue class of `f(a) \in F_n(B)`. (This is *not* the map that would be obtained by composing the canonical iso `gr A -> A` with `f : A -> B` and then with the canonical iso `B -> gr B` when `A` and `B` are graded with basis. It is defined even without bases.) How would we implement this (on filtered modules or algebras with basis)? I would proceed like this:

```
def induced_graded_map(self, other, f):
    r"""
    Return the graded linear map ``self`` `\to` ``other`` canonically
    induced by a linear map `f` from the filtered module whose
    associated graded module is ``self`` to the filtered module whose
    associated graded module is ``other``.

    [...]

    """
    # not tested
    A = self._A # This requires ``self`` to have a ``_A`` attribute,
                # which must be part of the contract.
    def on_basis(m):
        i = self.degree_on_basis(m)
        # This needs a ``degree_on_basis`` method on ``self``.
        return other.projection(i)(f(A.monomial(m)))
        # This needs the ``projection`` method to exist on
        # ``other``.
        # This assumes that the basis element of ``A`` indexed
        # by ``m`` is a lift of the basis element of ``self``
        # indexed by ``m``. This is a fairly harmless assumption.
    return self.module_morphism(on_basis=on_basis,
                                codomain=other, category=self.category())
    """
```

This is a piece of code so basic and general that it should be in `associated_graded.py`. But if we start redefining `graded_algebra` in ways that remove its `_A` attribute, its `projection` method and whatever else, then this code breaks.

I suck at Python OOP; do you know a way to take an existing instance of `AssociatedGraded` and add some methods to it? If this is possible, then I think this is what overrides of `graded_algebra` should be doing. For instance, the graded algebra of a Clifford algebra should be its `AssociatedGraded`, but with a coercion to and from the exterior algebra.

A few questions and comments: 

- in `filtered_modules.py`, it talks about modules over a commutative ring, but the word "commutative" can be deleted, I think.

 If you want to keep this remark, then you should add "when i \leq j". But do you need to keep this? If you want a decreasing filtration, just use the non-positive integers for your indexing set instead of non-negative integers. For example, if you have an algebra `A` and an ideal `I`, then you can set `F_{-n}A` equal to the `n`th power of `I`.

Ah! This is a good idea; then `induced_graded_map` will also have to be moved to the filtered algebra class. Can you move the three methods you mentioned please? I will then implement `induced_graded_map`.

So let me get it right: The class `AssociatedGraded` is not going to be a class to be inherited from; it will plainly be the way to construct associated graded algebras if nothing better is known. The data connecting `gr(A)` to `A` will be stored on `A` rather than on `gr(A)`. I assume it makes sense to make `graded_algebra` a cached method to avoid cases where it is not `UniqueRepresentation`?

Also, could you reply to my post 36? I don't see `FilteredAlgebrasWithBasis` ever mentioning `FilteredModulesWithBasis` as a supercategory, but I guess it should, and I guess its methods should be on `FilteredModulesWithBasis` as well.

Quite possibly. See [#14356 comment 6](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/14356#comment:6) and
[https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/sage-devel/q5uy_lI11jg/CB15fcRmE4cJ](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/sage-devel/q5uy_lI11jg/CB15fcRmE4cJ)

The main thing to watch out for is caching on an object A a UniqueRepresentation object B that has A as a construction parameter.

As pointed out in the referenced comment, one is usually in the clear if the construction parameters of a UniqueRepresentation are fundamentally simpler than the object itself. I'd say that fails for AssociatedGradedAlgebra if that takes an algebra it's isomorphic to as an ungraded algebra as construction parameter! I would consider making it a factory and construct from only the base ring, generator names, grading information etc. and then link it via the coercion framework/cached methods. Then at least it's clear that strong references are held locally. It's important to realize that UniqueRepresentation has a serious cost associated with it.

I don't think these methods would need to be overwritten as they are completely generic.

I think that gets into the issue (and is related with John's comment) with what do for filtrations in general. I want to use `degree` for the filtration parameter so we don't have to duplicate code, it's natural for graded modules/algebras, and which filtration component is not well-defined (most elements belong to multiple, possibly infinite, F<sub>i</sub> components). Overall, we will need a framework for construction of general filtrations, but I don't think we can do that at the category level.

Done for today. I'll add some more doctests tomorrow and hopefully get to read through the rest of the files, although I'd much prefer if you get rid of some of the TODOs beforehand.

If the Clifford issues become too complicated, what do you think of splitting this patch into a general filtrations one and a Clifford one? I see nontrivial work ahead in both of them, so a split would speed up the merge of the general code.

"Have a ring to it". Heh.

I would object to calling a module an "algebra" if there is no multiplicative structure. "Associated graded module" is just fine, or "associated graded object" more generally.

When you initialize a filtered object, you could pass an argument saying how it is filtered:

```
FilteredObject(A, filtration=fcn)
```
where `A` is an object and `fcn` is a function which takes an element of `A` as input and returns an element of the filtering monoid. (Change 'object' to 'algebra', 'module', 'group', 'ring', throughout if you'd rather.) So a simple example could be

```
FilteredObject(A, filtration=degree)
```
but you could also have

```
FilteredObject(A, filtration=smith_filtration)
FilteredObject(A, filtration=lambda x: 2 + 3*x.jones_filtration())
FilteredObject(A, filtration=lambda x: 0 if x.is_zero() else Infinity)
...
```
One point is that, even if an object has many possible filtrations, when you consider it as a filtered object, you are at that point choosing a filtration. It's like the difference between a `Module` and a `ModuleWithBasis`. I guess I should have called this `ObjectWithFiltration` instead? Anyway, it's not `FilterableObject`, allowing for multiple possible filtrations, it's `FilteredObject`.

If the `filtration` keyword is missing, then perhaps first you see if the `Element` class has a `filtration` method, and if not, you see if it has a `degree` method.

How is that any different for objects with multiple natural gradings? The point I'm trying to make is `GradedAlgebra` is not an algebra that has *some* grading (all algebras have a trivial grading), but that they have a *distinguished* grading, just like (`FiniteDimensional`)`AlgebrasWithBasis` are algebras with a distinguished basis (can replace grading by filtered).

The main reason why I chose to use `grading` is so we don't have to duplicate all of the code for graded algebras but just replacing `degree` by `smallest_filtered_component` (or whatever name you want to call it).

For the Clifford algebras, we don't yet have the category framework in place (I know how I want to do it, but I haven't done so yet). Perhaps it is a bad choice to give Clifford algebras that option right now for the future outlook. Also now that we have the filtered algebras, we don't need the graded algebras to get extra features.

This relates to John's suggestion, and that we probably need something at the *class* level, not the *category* level which is what this ticket is about, which set's the degree function. I want to stress that the category has a distinguished filtration/grading (perhaps I forgot to reflect this in the documentation).

I will take a more detailed look at all of the changes later tonight.

Yes, that's tricky. I didn't read the code in detail, but in general I would expect that with caching maps on objects that use each other as construction parameters, you do end up with the problematic reference cycles, rooted in a global cache reference.

If your projection can somehow be obtained as a coercion/conversion you may be able to lift on the effort that went in there (internally, those maps drop their reference to the domain now. Since they are normally cached on the codomain, that seems to usually be enough to break cycles).

I don't have a proof of the following, but conceptually it seems reasonable to me that you can choose one of the following approaches, but that mixing them will lead to memory leaks:

That will usually mean using UniqueFactory rather than UniqueRepresentation, so that you can process the keys a bit.

I suspect that what we need is that there is a partial ordering on our globally cached objects, where `A<B` if `A` can occur as part of a construction cache key for `B`. Having both `A<B` and `B<A` would naturally lead to a reference cycle and hence a leak.

Furthermore, if `A<B` and A holds a strong reference to B in any form then there's a leak too.

For instance `QQ` can be a construction parameter of `QQ[x]` because `QQ` does not refer to `QQ[x]` in any way (the fact that `QQ` coerces into `QQ[x]` is stored on `QQ[x]`).

In the case here, where I think we have things like `A=CommutativeAlgebra(QQ,['x','y','z'])` and `B=GradedCommutativeAlgebra(QQ,['x','y','z'])` it is not clear if we should have `A<B` or `B<A`. So I think we should have neither (the constructions above definitely don't need it) and then you're free to cache on these things in either direction, provided you don't coerce (:-)) the coercion framework into holding a reference cycle.

In hindsight I really think UniqueRepresentation is a mistaken design decision. We sort of need it for efficient coercion, though.

> The main reason why I chose to use `grading` is so we don't have to duplicate all of the code for graded algebras but just replacing `degree` by `smallest_filtered_component` (or whatever name you want to call it).

My main concern is that I want to be able to have a graded algebra with an additional filtration on it (ideally so that the associated graded algebra is bigraded). I think you said (or someone said) that this could be done with some reworking of the code in this branch. If that's accurate, then it seems like it would be better to have more flexible code that could handle this right from the start, instead of implementing it one way and then rewriting it later on.

About why I think `FilteredModulesWithBasis` needs a contract:

Here are the methods on `F` that are used in the implementations of the methods of `FilteredModulesWithBasis` when `F` is cast as a `FilteredModulesWithBasis`:

```
ParentMethods:
degree_on_basis
sum_of_terms
monomial
_indices

ElementMethods:
support
leading_support
is_homogeneous
is_zero
```

I hear the quacking of a `CombinatorialFreeModule` duck here (except for `degree_on_basis` which should be explicitly required). Are there any more general categories which offer these methods?

But naming them `graded_algebra` is questionable, and I understand jhpalmieri's objections to it. What about renaming `graded_algebra` as `associated_graded` (for both modules and algebras)? Nicolas just suggested this and I like the idea.

(We algebraists don't have a good name for this notion. "Associated graded" is too long and an adjective that makes the listener search in vain for a noun. "gr" is too short and hard to pronounce.)
