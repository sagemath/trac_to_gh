Refactoring graphics is now #18033, already too much going on here.

This basically works now, except that it unearthed various broken stuff elsewhere that wasn't exercised before.

Will there be an option for inline/display formulas with this system?

Although it seems a little ugly to modify global preferences before output and restoring them afterwards - shouldn't there be some way to pass "current preferences" that take precedence over "default ones"?

Since I had no desire to dig into old show mess, I've merged this into my branch for SageMathCell based on 6.6.rc1 and get 

```
OSError: [calculus ] docstring of sage.symbolic.expression.Expression.show:14: WARNING: Block quote ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent.
```
while building documentation.

What is the long-term plan for `pretty_print/show/view`? I've always used `show` to get a plot out or a displayed formula and `view` for inline formulas (which could be on the same line as `print`ed text). That was definitely not something intuitive/easily discoverable. Perhaps `show` can be reserved for graphics only (2D/3D/animated) and its use for other objects deprecated? While `pretty_print` with some keywords to control display/inline should be the only official way to display formulas, with its use for graphics deprecated? And `view` just gone?.. For the moment it seems that `view` is left as is and `show = pretty_print` after this branch.

Use cases for inline equations:
- they are flushed left rather than centered, which makes a difference in combined output blocks
- they have (or had) different padding in notebook, so were more compact
- they are of course more compact because they use different LaTeX style
- they could continue the line after `print "Cool formula: ",`

So I think they definitely should be available as an option. Having `show/view` to pick the style was not cool, of course.

I guess we should use inline/text style if and only if there is adjacent stuff. So, for example,  `pretty_print(a, b)` should use inline style and `pretty_print(a); pretty_print(b)` should use block/display style.

Okay guys. Now whenever I do `graphs.PetersenGraph()` in Sage I get a plot of it. Is it because of this ticket ?

Some graphs that I work with are much too large to be plotted. Just typing 'g' in the command line (as I often do to check the number of vertices) now runs an algorithm that I have to kill.
