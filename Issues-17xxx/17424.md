It's nice looking indeed. What about using "catalog" rather than "index"?

In the long run, it's one more thing that we need to maintain by hand. We should investigate ways to automatize parts of it.

Oh. Well, because I named it "index" everywhere else. Index of functions, stuff like that. Change it if you like, but here I used "index" as in "an exhaustive list of things".

Yes. But this is really something which should be done on the Sphinx side. We can do something ourselves (there are some hacks in the listing of `graph_generators`) but it should really be Sphinx code.

Anyway, in the meantime that should not stop us from building an index for all 'important' classes. These things are useful.

Yo !

Wanna see how many times "index" appears in Sage's source code ?

Catalog is used a lot indeed, and we usually call "catalog" all the 'things.<tab>' objects. If I make no mistake, what you want to change is the text "Index of constructors" just before the list of them ? In this context I believe that "index" cannot confuse anybody, and I also believe that it is correct as an index is "an exhaustive list of things".

Also, I do not believe that there is any standard with respect to the use of 'catalog' in this context, i.e. a list of methods.

Either way, you can change it if you like. And the same goes for renaming `poset_examples` to `posets_catalog` `:-P`

Where do you think it might help ? In the developper's manual ? `O_o`

There are very very few modules with such an index. Unfortunately.
