Hello,

Thanks for having a look.

I do not complain that `sage -i` has not been advertised. But I do that it is documented nowhere (neither in `src/bin/sage` nor in `src/bin/sage-pkg`)!

Currently we have the options `-optional`, `-standard` and `-experimental`. I am just adding an additional `-installed`. We can be smarter and more coherent by allowing multiple arguments and force to use the `-i` option like in

```
    $ sage -i --installed --optional --standard
    ... would list all installed package that are either ...
    ... optional or standard                             ...
    $ sage -i --not-installed
    ... would list all non installed packages ...
```
I am in favour of a more coherent scheme of options, but then we should forbid the older syntax (and instead write a deprecation message that explains the new syntax).

And I definitely do not understand why we do have two scripts (`src/bin/sage-spkg` and `src/bin/sage-list-packages`) for dealing with packages. Morever the current state is that `sage-spkg` is used to list the installed packages while `sage-list-packages` is the one to list the optional packages...

EDIT: and I just noticed that the `sage -i` starts with a useless line 'Currently installed packages:'. It is especially bad if you want to use it in other scripts.

Vincent

Alas, I can only point things out when it comes to these scripts - I am reluctant to tread on such long-standing traditions.  I do hope some others come to look at this, though, since at the very least it is not bad to add `-installed`.

Use spaces, not TABs for indentation.

Instead of `[ ! $(sage -installed | grep -c '^pip-') -eq 1 ]`,
I would go with `[ -x "$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/pip" ]`

And why not replace `echo "Pip is not installed. Run \"sage -i pip\" to install it."` by `sage -i pip || exit $?`?

I do not like to do things in a script that users did not ask for.
