So does it work with complex number in general, or not ? Could you tell me how you would like me to rephrase that ? Or could you add a commit ? I do not see exactly how I should say it.

Perhaps add something along the lines of

```
If a doctest with tolerance contains several numbers, each of them is checked individually::

    sage: print "The sum of 1 and 1 equals 5"  # abs tol 1
    The sum of 2 and 2 equals 4

As a consequence of this, tests involving complex numbers, matrices or polynomials usually work as expected::

    sage: <complex number example here>
    sage: M = Matrix(RR, 3, 3, [-13, 1, 1, -3, 0, -2, -4, -2, 0])
    sage: M^-1 * M   # actual result
    [     1.00000000000000  6.93889390390723e-18 -6.24500451351651e-17]
    [ 4.44089209850063e-16      1.00000000000000  1.11022302462516e-16]
    [-1.94289029309402e-16 -1.38777878078145e-17      1.00000000000000]
    sage: M^-1 * M   # tol 2e-16
    [ 1.00000000000000 0.000000000000000 0.000000000000000]
    [0.000000000000000  1.00000000000000 0.000000000000000]
    [0.000000000000000 0.000000000000000  1.00000000000000]

Note that, in the last example, the zeros are checked with **absolute** tolerance, while the non-zero entries are checked with **relative** tolerance.

Yo !

Because in my understanding, most of what Sage contains is a math library. Fortunately what causes problems in the third-party math librarires that we use is precisely floating-point airethmetic or non-deterministic algorithms, so that's fine.

The English looks okay to me.

Two more suggestions: we should define relative and absolute tolerance, or at least give a link to a definition. Also, maybe we should emphasize that the "32-bit" and "64-bit" flags go on the **output** lines, not the input lines the way the other flags do.

Hello guys !

> What about the --optional=sage,keyword?


It is already documented in the chapter (that this patch renames to) "Running the doctests". The section about the 'optional' flag begins with a link toward that page

http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/doctesting.html#run-optional-tests

I think that it is sufficient for the moment, especially since we all seem to agree that this behaviour should be changed so that 'sage' is always included in `--optional=<a list>`.

> `A line flagged with ``optional - keyword```, it is not tested: remove `", it"`

Done.

> I really think that it should be involves since "representation" is singular.

Done.

> Also, maybe we should emphasize that the "32-bit" and "64-bit" flags go on the output lines.

Done

From the look of your comments I have no idea if you consider that this ticket can be switched to `positive_review` yet, but I would really appreciate it if you could make all your comments at once, next time. I have already pushed 6 different review commits here, and that is much more work than implementing at once all of the reviewer's comments.

Thanks,

Nathann

Don't forget that there was a lot of confusion about the tolerance stuff... I think that's mainly what caused the many commits. Also, it's not also always to give all reviewer comments at once: when there are major mistakes, I find it harder to concentrate on spelling errors. Also, sometimes I have comments about the review commits...

I was also busy doing other things these days, so I didn't have the time to make those review commits myself like I would usually do.
