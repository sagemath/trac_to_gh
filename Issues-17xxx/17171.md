All of our current patches no longer apply because either they were merged upstream or were changes to the testing framework (which has completely changed from the dev version). However I added a new patch which removes the `test_semicolon` because this is the known, but not yet fixed, [Issue #5](https://github.com/kjellmf/dot2tex/issues/5).
