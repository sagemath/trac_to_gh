In [HKP2015], we study the sum of output of a transducer when reading a random non-negative integer up to a certain N. Under suitable conditions, it has a periodic fluctuation in the second order term. In that paper, we compute the Fourier coefficients of this periodic fluctuation. This ticket holds the corresponding Sage code.

<a id='comment:25'></a>Merged latest version of #17220 (without functions `matrix_to_acb_mat` and `acb_mat_to_matrix`) and adapted code.

Now that complex balls are fully implemented, it might make sense to do all computations in complex balls; this might lead to clearer code than the current mixture of complex intervals and direct calls to arb.
