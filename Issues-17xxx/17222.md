In [HKP2015], we study the sum of output of a transducer when reading a random non-negative integer up to a certain N. Under suitable conditions, it has a periodic fluctuation in the second order term. In that paper, we compute the Fourier coefficients of this periodic fluctuation. This ticket holds the corresponding Sage code.
