```
After #10513, only the following module classes still inherit from `Module_old`, which is being deprecated:
1. `sage.modular.abvar.finite_subgroup.FiniteSubgroup`
2. `sage.modular.overconvergent.genus0.OverconvergentModularFormsSpace`
3. `sage.structure.formal_sum.FormalSums`
The goal of this ticket is to make these classes inherit from `Module` instead, to make them use the new coercion model, and to add a deprecation warning to `Module_old`.

Depends on #10513

Hi Peter,

I do only have very minor points.

This error message is not very nice

```
"x does not define an element of self"
```
I would rather be more explicit

```
"x (={}) does not define an element of {}".format(x, self)
```
(I notice that you are not responsible for that)

Why did you create the method `generator_orders`? Why not instead replace the code in `abelian_iterator`?

## not for this ticket

Do you know why `FormalSums` is in `sage.structure`? It makes no sense to me. It should rather be in `sage.modules`. Moreover it intersects very much with the combinatorial free modules

```
sage: C = CombinatorialFreeModule(ZZ,GF(7))
sage: C.an_element()
2*B[0] + 2*B[1] + 3*B[2]
```
What do you think? 

what `gens_py.py` is doing in `sage.structure`?! I would rather put it in `sage.combinat` or `sage.misc.`

Yes, it would certainly makes more sense for it to be there.

Probably because it is only used in `sage.structure.parent_gens`...

Would be cool that string formatting to be fast and uniformized in errors. Why Python does not have a native solution for that?! Right now, I do prefer clear error messages instead of potentially faster coercion discovery.

I was wrong in my timing. The difference is considerable even here. Taking one of the examples from the documentation:

```
sage: from sage.misc.lazy_format import LazyFormat
sage: J = J0(23)
sage: G = J.torsion_subgroup(11)
sage: G(J.torsion_subgroup(3).0)
sage: self=G
sage: x=J.torsion_subgroup(3).0
sage: %timeit "cannot convert {!r} into {}".format(x, self)
10000 loops, best of 3: 38.4 µs per loop
sage: %timeit "TypeError: cannot convert %s into %s"%(x,self)
10000 loops, best of 3: 33.2 µs per loop
sage: %timeit LazyFormat("TypeError: cannot convert %s into %s")%(x,self)
100000 loops, best of 3: 1.74 µs per loop
```

I think you should consider putting LazyFormat in the error messages (it's basically a drop-in replacement) or argue that the relevant error messages are only constructed with really cheap arguments in time-critical situations, or that these error messages never get raised in time-critical situations.

Note that a few years ago I introduced a lazy attribute error to be used in `sage.structure...`, that had a surprising impact on the performance of "real" computations. One of the tricks was to have precisely one instance of the lazy error message; so, one doesn't even lose time to create a new instance for each error being raised (it is only needed to set some cdef attribute of the lazy error message object).

We did some experiments whether lazy strings could achieve the same, but they couldn't compete. However, what we did there was restricted to attribute errors.

In any case, I agree that lazy error messages would be an improvment in the current situation.
