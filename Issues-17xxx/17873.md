<a id='comment:3'>Comment 3:</a>
There is something weird in my commit and I don't understand why.
I have not modified the `generic_graph.py` file but the commit contains code from it O_o
I'm sure I have created this branch starting from the `develop` branch (after a git trac checkout develop; git trac pull; git branch ifub; git checkout ifub; fix ifub problems and do test and docbuild; git commit...; git trac push 17873).
Any idea on how to resolve this?

David.

Hello !

> Any idea on how to resolve this?

Well, I do not understand hwo you got there either. Your branch seems based on the latest develop indeed, but your must have had some changes in `generic_graph` when you ran this 'pull'. Either way none of that is really a problem. Here is what you should do:

1) "Break" your last commit. Its content will become unstaged changes
`sage reset HEAD~1` 

2) At this moment you can do a `git checkout generic_graph.py`. This will discard any change in `generic_graph.py`. In particular there are `<<<<<<<` and `>>>>>>>` in there that probably come from a failed merge.

3) When you are satisfied with the result, create the commit again in the usual way

4) As you modified a commit, technically you rewrote history. When you push your commit again you will have to use a `-f` flag.

In general, if you call 'tig' more frequently to look at your commits and diff you should have less troubles with git.

I am in the train right now, a bit after Avignon. God, it feels good to see this warm sunlight everywhere. It feels more like home than any other place.
