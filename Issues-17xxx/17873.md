There is something weird in my commit and I don't understand why.
I have not modified the `generic_graph.py` file but the commit contains code from it O_o
I'm sure I have created this branch starting from the `develop` branch (after a git trac checkout develop; git trac pull; git branch ifub; git checkout ifub; fix ifub problems and do test and docbuild; git commit...; git trac push 17873).
Any idea on how to resolve this?

David.

Hello !

> Any idea on how to resolve this?

Well, I do not understand hwo you got there either. Your branch seems based on the latest develop indeed, but your must have had some changes in `generic_graph` when you ran this 'pull'. Either way none of that is really a problem. Here is what you should do:

1) "Break" your last commit. Its content will become unstaged changes
`sage reset HEAD~1` 

2) At this moment you can do a `git checkout generic_graph.py`. This will discard any change in `generic_graph.py`. In particular there are `<<<<<<<` and `>>>>>>>` in there that probably come from a failed merge.

3) When you are satisfied with the result, create the commit again in the usual way

4) As you modified a commit, technically you rewrote history. When you push your commit again you will have to use a `-f` flag.

In general, if you call 'tig' more frequently to look at your commits and diff you should have less troubles with git.

I am in the train right now, a bit after Avignon. God, it feels good to see this warm sunlight everywhere. It feels more like home than any other place.

So the patch is ready to be reviewed. Note that I have not changed the first test of the diameter method from `if n==0` to `if n<=1`, but we can do it as well to save time.
