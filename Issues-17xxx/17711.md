This patch cleans the module `sage.graphs.graph_decompositions.vertex_separation` to expose the new branch and bound algorithm #17647 and other methods into the `vertex_separation` method, as for the `path_decomposition` method. It makes the branch and bound the default method since it is the fastest one. It also adds a generic pre-processing method based on the decomposition of the input digraph into strongly connected components.

<a id='comment:5'></a>Yooooooooooooo !

Does the job, very few comments (and a small commit at `public/17711b`):


- Calling `is_strongly_connected` is very cheap while
  `g.strongly_connected_components_digraph` actually copies the whole graph

```
sage: g=digraphs.DeBruijn(5,3)
sage: %timeit g.is_strongly_connected()
10000 loops, best of 3: 129 Âµs per loop
sage: %timeit g.strongly_connected_components_digraph()
1000 loops, best of 3: 1.31 ms per loop
```

  Better to only copy it if necessary.

- Is there any reason why you only deal with digraphs ? `Digraph(G)` (when `G`
  is a graph) is not always strongly connected: `G` may not be connected. The
  same code could handle everything at once, couldn't it ?

- (unrelated) what on earth is this `random_DAG` function doing in the global
  namespace instead of being in `digraphs.<tab>` ? `O_O`

So you propose that I
1. test if the graph is connected. If not, then apply the algorithm on each connected component. 
2. If G is directed, test if is strongly connected. If not, then apply the algorithm on each scc

Is that correct?

I had the same remark while reviewing patch #12181 (and certainly other tickets). Nothing has been done since. I don't even know where is the code.
In fact, we have many random<TAB> stuff in global namespace...

I had something simpler (and a it more ressource-consuming) in mind:
1) If you have a graph, test if it is connected. If it is not, turn it into a digraph
2) Now the scc code for digraphs will handle each connected component independently

So you get it for free, more or less.

Pffff.. It comes from the "sandpile" module and I am not even sure that any of that code is useful to anything.

Plus I am not very eager to move 'random_DAG' to `digraphs.<tab>` because I do not agree with the way it generates the random dag. Also, some random 'weights' are involved.

I will probably end up removing the imports into the global namespace, and that will be all.

I'll cc you if I do.
