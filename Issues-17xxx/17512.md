This looks weird to have a section 'algebraic combinatorics', with some subitems, one of those subitem being named 'algebraic combinatorics' again that contains itself 4 subitems. This is quite confusing, i do not see why the Tsetlin library does not have the same depth as abelian sandpiles or visualizing root systems. This is even more confusing that someone who search for "Algebraic Combinatorics in Sage" on the web will fall into the [sub] page with the same title and may think that there are only 4 tutorials about algebraic combinatorics (it happened to me 2 days ago while preparing a Sage "live" tutorial).

I see at least two ways to make things clearer:

- remove the page [sub] and merge its 4 items directly into the [main] list. So, we obtain a tree like
  - Thematic tutorials
   - Combinatorics (subitem)
     - Introduction to combinatorics in Sage
   - Algebraic Combinatorics in Sage (subitem)
     - Tutorial: Symmetric Functions
     - Lie Methods and Related Combinatorics in Sage
     - Tutorial: visualizing root systems
     - Abelian Sandpile Model
     - Walks in graphs
     - n-Cube
     - The Tsetlin library
     - Young’s lattice and the RSK algorithm

- or, if you fear the 'algebraic combinatorics' list to be too big in the [main] thematic_tutorials page, merge the algebraic combinatorics list into the [sub] page. So, we obtain a tree like
  - Thematic tutorials
   - Combinatorics (subitem)
     - Introduction to combinatorics in Sage
     - Algebraic Combinatorics in Sage (subpage)
       - Tutorial: Symmetric Functions
       - Lie Methods and Related Combinatorics in Sage
       - Tutorial: visualizing root systems
       - Abelian Sandpile Model
       - Walks in graphs
       - n-Cube
       - The Tsetlin library
       - Young’s lattice and the RSK algorithm

- a version mixing the two is to keep this tree but keep the list of algebraic tutorials accessible from the [main] page (so there is no [sub] page anymore).

Note also that "Lie Methods and Related Combinatorics in Sage" currently appears twice in the [main] page.

There is a worthwile discussion to have here, thanks! Just a note for now: in the reorganization, we need to take into account the upcoming thematic tutorials from #16810.

Yet this belongs to a separate ticket. Or maybe to #16810. So I am putting this one back to positive review.

Then the current reorganization ticket should wait for #16810 for the very same reason !

> Yet this belongs to a separate ticket. Or maybe to #16810. So I am putting this one back to positive review.

I do not get your point here:
- The current ticket is about organisation while #16810 is about adding new content. 
- The current patch is one-line while the one of #16810 is a patchbomb.
- The current ticket can be fixed soon while #16810 might take a while.
- The current ticket is about the subpage with the 4 isolated items (which my comment is about), while #16810 has nothing to do with this page.

The current ticket is about fixing a trivially duplicated link that Nathann reported to me, that's it.
If you believe there is no point in fixing it now and we should shoot right away for doing more stuff, fine. But I am not volunteering to do anything more now on the topic.
