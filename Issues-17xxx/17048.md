Nathann Cohen wrote on another ticket:

"This code could be seriously rewritten, though. In two different ways:
 
1) Assume from the start that 0,...,n-1 is a linear extension, and only add edges i,j with i<j. With this you don't have to call `is_directed_acyclic` every second (and this is the bottleneck of the implementation). At the end, relabel everything randomly so that the linear extension is random, too

2) Work directly on the Hasse Diagram. Build the random Poset on n elements from a poset on n-1 elements:

Consider all minimal elements `m_1,...m_c` of the previous digraph and add the edges `m_i,n` with probability `p`. If some edge `m_i` was not added, consider the immediate predecessors of `m_i` and do the same with them.

This second way to build them benefits from the transitivity of posets.

The last algorithm was mentionned by Florent and Nicolas to which I asked the question. They seemed to think that this generation of random posets was not standard, and that we could change it a bit if we like, i.e. without caring if by changing the algorithm we change the distribution of posets. It seems that it is only there to provide random posets for computer tests, with no specific property in mind."

I add this on wishlist-milestone, so that I don't forget it totally. I'm not going to code this at least for release 6.4.

Maybe we could also generate random posets with given restrictions? For example

```
# Graded poset

# set_random_seed(0)
from sage.misc.prandom import random
from sage.misc.randstate import current_randstate
dice=current_randstate()

n=20
prob=0.2
# Too many 1-element levels... make better.
levels=Partitions(n).random_element()
p=Permutations(len(levels)).random_element()
levels=[levels[x-1] for x in p]

# Poset P will have 0..levels[0] as minimal element,
# levels[0]..levels[1]-1 covering them and so on.
G=DiGraph({x:[] for x in range(0,n)})
prev_start=0
prev_end=levels[0]

for i in levels[1:]:
    # Connect every element of previous level to some element on this level
    for prev in range(prev_start, prev_end):
        r=randint(prev_end, prev_end+i-1)
        G.add_edge(prev, r)
    # Connect every element of this level to some element on previous level
    for e in range(prev_end, prev_end+i):
        if G.in_degree(e) == 0:
            r=randint(prev_start, prev_end-1)
            G.add_edge(r, e)
    # And now the random part
    for e1 in range(prev_start, prev_end):
        for e2 in range(prev_end, prev_end+i):
            if dice.c_rand_double() < prob:
                G.add_edge(e1, e2)
    prev_start=prev_end
    prev_end=prev_end+i
P=Poset(G);
```

Calling this kind of functions could be something like `Posets.RandomPoset(20, 0.2, properties=['graded', 'connected', 'third_property'])`.
