It's a defect because the `reference/misc/sage/rings/arith.html` documentation makes users expect the `algorithm` keyword to work but

```
sage: y=factorial(10^6,algorithm='gmp')
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
...
TypeError: __call__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'algorithm'
```

As the implementation of the algorithm keyword in symbolic function seems difficult (#17531) as pragmatic solution would be to accept that for algorithm to work the arith version of factorial must be explicitly called, see #19461#comment:9 for the general argument.
The `rings` version apparently gets overwritten on import and the `function/` does not accept/transfer the `algorithm` keyword.

> Timing comparison

In fact, the `functions/other` version supposedly calling pynac/ginac actually indirectly calls the `rings/arith` version, i.e., gmp.

So, there will be no speed changes with this ticket.

This, however, means also that the problem with passing `algorithm` is due to `Function_factorial` being a `GinacFunction`. Of course, a `GinacFunction` would only use Ginac, so it figures.

<a id='comment:17'></a>I'm not happy with the change of `_eval_` to `__call__`. You cannot expect every function which wants an `algorithm` argument to override `__call__`. Especially now that more and more non-trivial logic is going into the `__call__` method of `BuiltinFunction`.

It might make a lot more sense to move all this `algorithm` stuff to a custom `_evalf_` function, which *does* support an `algorithm` argument.

In order words: I think the general question of how to handle `algorithm` arguments in symbolic calls should be answered first.

I didn't say that. I just said that I don't want an `algorithm` keyword *only* for `factorial()`. I don't want a "solution" which needs to treat `factorial()` in a special way.

If you agree with this, please open a new ticket for supporting a more general `algorithm` keyword.
