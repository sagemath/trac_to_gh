It's a defect because the `reference/misc/sage/rings/arith.html` documentation makes users expect the `algorithm` keyword to work but

```
sage: y=factorial(10^6,algorithm='gmp')
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
...
TypeError: `__call__`() got an unexpected keyword argument 'algorithm'
```

As the implementation of the algorithm keyword in symbolic function seems difficult (#17531) as pragmatic solution would be to accept that for algorithm to work the arith version of factorial must be explicitly called, see #19461#comment:9 for the general argument.
The `rings` version apparently gets overwritten on import and the `function/` does not accept/transfer the `algorithm` keyword.

Timing comparison:

* (time) 10<sup>6</sup>!: sympy: 10s, ginac: 200 ms, gmp: 190 ms, pari: 410 ms 
Here, sympy caches the result (or the computation), so subsequent calls with the same argument are fast. In contrast, the other programs always use 0.2-0.4 seconds per call to factorial(10<sup>6</sup>) so, by wrapping in a `@`cached function, they would be as fast as sympy in followup calls.

This clearly shows sympy is not up to it, EDIT: and this ticket will speed up many computations 2x.

> Timing comparison

In fact, the `functions/other` version supposedly calling pynac/ginac actually indirectly calls the `rings/arith` version, i.e., gmp.

So, there will be no speed changes with this ticket.

This, however, means also that the problem with passing `algorithm` is due to `Function_factorial` being a `GinacFunction`. Of course, a `GinacFunction` would only use Ginac, so it figures.

Not possible because only the first message is printed. I removed the doctests.

This is overly complicated:

```
    try:
        x_in_ZZ = ZZ(x)
        coercion_success = True
    except TypeError:
        coercion_success = False

    if coercion_success and x_in_ZZ >= 0:
        return ZZ(x).factorial()
    else:
        return py_tgamma(x+1)
```

Why not

```
    try:
        x = ZZ(x)
    except TypeError:
        pass
    else:
        if x >= 0:
            return x.factorial()

    return py_tgamma(x+1)
```
Also: the <code>:trac:\`9240\`</code> syntax should be used in docstrings, not comments in code, so please revert that.

It might make a lot more sense to move all this `algorithm` stuff to a custom `_evalf_` function, which *does* support an `algorithm` argument.

In order words: I think the general question of how to handle `algorithm` arguments in symbolic calls should be answered first.

I didn't say that. I just said that I don't want an `algorithm` keyword *only* for `factorial()`. I don't want a "solution" which needs to treat `factorial()` in a special way.

If you agree with this, please open a new ticket for supporting a more general `algorithm` keyword.

* the use of `py_factorial_py` cannot be deprecated so doctests using it must be deleted right away (adding the deprecation message in the doctest is not possible because only the first message is printed)
* deprecating the "arith" version will not print a deprecation message for interactive users because (as the ticket states the arith version apparently gets overwritten on import). Maybe the deprecation shows if one imports directly from arith
* do not use `__call__` to catch `algorithm`, use `_evalf_`
* the general question of how to handle algorithm arguments in symbolic calls should be answered first, meaning no special solution just for factorial. Having an abstract `IntegerFunction` in `functions/integerfunction.py` is the idea. The ticket #17531 would deal with this, but has unexpected pitfalls.
