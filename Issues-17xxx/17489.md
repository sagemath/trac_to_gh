It's a defect because the `reference/misc/sage/rings/arith.html` documentation makes users expect the `algorithm` keyword to work but

```
sage: y=factorial(10^6,algorithm='gmp')
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
...
TypeError: __call__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'algorithm'
```

As the implementation of the algorithm keyword in symbolic function seems difficult (#17531) as pragmatic solution would be to accept that for algorithm to work the arith version of factorial must be explicitly called, see [#19461 comment:9](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/19461#comment:9) for the general argument.
The `rings` version apparently gets overwritten on import and the `function/` does not accept/transfer the `algorithm` keyword.

Depends on #24178

This clearly shows sympy is not up to it, EDIT: and this ticket will speed up many computations 2x.

> Timing comparison

In fact, the `functions/other` version supposedly calling pynac/ginac actually indirectly calls the `rings/arith` version, i.e., gmp.

So, there will be no speed changes with this ticket.

This, however, means also that the problem with passing `algorithm` is due to `Function_factorial` being a `GinacFunction`. Of course, a `GinacFunction` would only use Ginac, so it figures.

This is overly complicated:

```
    try:
        x_in_ZZ = ZZ(x)
        coercion_success = True
    except TypeError:
        coercion_success = False

Why not

* deprecating the "arith" version will not print a deprecation message for interactive users because (as the ticket states the arith version apparently gets overwritten on import). Maybe the deprecation shows if one imports directly from arith
* do not use `__call__` to catch `algorithm`, use `_evalf_`
* the general question of how to handle algorithm arguments in symbolic calls should be answered first, meaning no special solution just for factorial. Having an abstract `IntegerFunction` in `functions/integerfunction.py` is the idea. The ticket #17531 would deal with this, but has unexpected pitfalls.
