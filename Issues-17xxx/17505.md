The symbolic product is currently broken in Sage :
* It cannot be created in Sage :

```
sage: var("j,p", domain="integer")
sage: X,Y=function("X,Y")
sage: prod(X(j),j,1,p)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

     72     """
     73     Return the product of the elements in the list x.

TypeError: prod() takes at most 3 positional arguments (4 given)
sage: product(X(j),j,1,p)

<ipython-input-6-4d04d74c7489> in <module>()
----> 1 product(X(j),j,Integer(1),p)

NameError: name 'product' is not defined
```

At the moment anonymous functions named `product` can be created via the Maxima `pexpect` interface and they even behave as products in specific cases:

```
sage: maxima("prod(X(j),j,1,p)").sage().log().log_expand()
sum(log(X(j)), j, 1, p)
```

The present ticket aims at creating a Sage function/method either evaluating the sum, or correctly creating a unevaluted symbolic product object.

For evaluation the ticket would have to decide which of (Maxima,SymPy) would be used as default for this. 

```
sage: import sympy
sage: x = sympy.Symbol('x')
sage: n = sympy.Symbol('n')
sage: sympy.product(x, (x, 1, n))
factorial(n)
sage: sympy.product(sin(x), (x, 1, n))
Product(sin(x), (x, 1, n))
```

Creating products by casting a Maxima expression via the library interface gives nonsense, see #17502.

do you mind adding `giac='product'` ? 

since:

```
sage: giac('product(x, x, 1, n)')
n!
sage: _.sage()
factorial(n)
```

Replying to [@rwst](#comment%3A11):
> This doesn't have the `prod` interface (other ticket) and some docs are missing but everything should work. Question: where does SymPy differ from Maxima?

First of all, thank you very much for this addition, which should enhance Sage's usefulness fo high-school/undergrad levels.

However, `ptestlong` gives three failures :

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage -t --long src/sage/calculus/calculus.py  # 5 doctests failed
sage -t --long src/sage/combinat/posets/posets.py  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t --long src/sage/homology/simplicial_complex.py  # 1 doctest failed
----------------------------------------------------------------------
```

The second and third ones have been [reported](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-release/UdllnAJFufA/-e8ArqwFBAAJ) for 8.0.beta4 and are seen again in 8.0beta5. Nothing new here, so probably not related.

The third one is new :

The last one is identical to one already seen in 8.0.beta4 and 8.0.beta5 ; again, nothing new, else probably not related. The four first ones seem identical : aren't they related to an undeclared variable ?

- A couple suggestions, of varying importance :

    1. (major) the interface methods ("symbolic_expression.prod" (or product)) and function(s) ("symbolic_product", parallelling "symbolic_sum") are necessary for easy use of this new functionality.

    2. (minor) for aesthetics and consistency, could we have for sage.functions.other.symbolic_sum (aka Function_sum) (almost) the same `_print_latex_` function you defined in sage.functions.other.symbolic_product (aka Function_prod) ?

    3. ((very) minor) consider a "mathematica" method, parallelling tye one in symbolic_sum (necessary for would-be Mathematica users, since mathematica.Sum(X(j), [j,1,p]) give utter nonsense currently).

- A question : can #22937 depend on this ?

- And a possible doctest, demonstrating that this formal mayhem has a mathematical sense :

```
sage: var("j,p", domain="integer")
(j, p)
sage: X=function("X")
sage: sage.functions.other.symbolic_product(X(j),j,1,p).log().log_expand()
sum(log(X(j)), j, 1, p)
```

==>`needs_work`

Those were just *suggestions*, not *requests* ;-)

Unless you have other suggestions, I'll implement the "symbolic product of product" case in #22937 ASAP, and depend on the present ticket.

<a id='comment:27'>**Comment 27:**</a>
Slight issue :

```
sage: var("j,p", domain="integer")
(j, p)
sage: X=function("X")
sage: latex(maxima("product(X(j),j,1,p)").sage()^2)
\prod_{j=1}^{p} X(j)^{2}
```
which prints *wrong* (it should be `{\prod_{j=1}^{p} X(j)}^{2`} in order to position the exponent over the whole sum, not the "productand"). The same is true for `sum`.

Care to fix it here or should I open a new ticket (depending on this one) ?

Not necessarily. `\sum_{j=1}^p X(j)^2` is mathematically wrong ; however, `{X_{j}}^2` is correct but ugly, whereas `X_{j}^2` is also ((almost) unambiguously) correct and much more pleasant.

There is still an ambiguity, that does not concern us there : tensors. But that's another whole can of worms.

Your patch looks good. `ptestlong` is running and should terminate in about an hour.

You mean in #22937, I suppose ?
> I'll close it and put the branch with the remaining issues in another ticket. See #22989.

Hmm... Unles I'm mistaken, there are two consequences :
- #22937 should no longer depend on #17505
- #22989 should depend on #22937
Am I right ?
