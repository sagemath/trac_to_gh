Currently `connected_components` is missing for `Poset`, and a useful/common feature to have.

I am sorry I did not notice it earlier, but your doctest has an output which can potentially be architecture dependent, i.e. the list of two posets on 5 and 3 elements.

You can easily fix it by creating a poset with two connected components on 5 elements.
