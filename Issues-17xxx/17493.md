I have to say I'm totally mystified as to why this is called `zoo`.  Is this a pun?

Here is something we might as well take care of here.  But the change here itself is fine and useful.

```
sage: a = oo
sage: b = -oo
sage: c = UnsignedInfinityRing.gen()  
# really, the easiest way?  probably should do better than that, not here
sage: a
+Infinity
sage: b
-Infinity
sage: c
Infinity
sage: a._sympy_()
oo
sage: b._sympy_()
-oo
sage: c._sympy_()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
AttributeError: 'UnsignedInfinity' object has no attribute '_sympy_'
```
A nice test for that would be 

```
gamma(-3)._sympy_() is sympy.factorial(-2)
gamma(-3) is sympy.factorial(-2)._sage_()
```
(note that putting it in `SR` makes it `==` but not `is`).
