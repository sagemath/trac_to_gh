It's not needed everywhere. Here, it's needed for

```
print() # to get a newline, otherwise we would see '()'

The old-style still works, but I can replace it if you want.

There is [a comment in the Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#str.format) suggesting that the old style, while not officially deprecated, is discouraged.

The change in `sage-num-threads.py` gives an error (when run from a Sage shell):

```
$ sage-num-threads.py 
  File "/Users/jpalmier/Desktop/Sage_stuff/git/sage/src/bin/sage-num-threads.py", line 180
    print(*num_threads())
          ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```
I guess you need `from __future__ import print_function` at the beginning of that file; at least, that fixes it for me.

Similarly, the change in `sage-coverageall` turns the output

```
Total number of functions:  37429
```
into

```
('Total number of functions: ', 37429)
```
Either adding a `from __future__ ...` statement or using `.format` appropriately would fix it.

Otherwise, I think it looks okay.
