Some places in the code and some doctests assume that the filename extension for shared libraries is `.so`, while it is `.dll` in cygwin. The attached patch defines once and for all the correct extension depending on the platform, and uses it where necessary.

Ahem, I do not completely understand what the patch does (i'm new to sage/python);
Question: what are the consequences, e.g. for `init_libsingular()`
in `src/sage/libs/singular/singular.pyx`?

*snip*:

```
...
    for extension in ["so", "dylib", "dll"]:
        lib = os.environ['SAGE_LOCAL']+"/lib/libsingular."+extension
        if os.path.exists(lib):
            handle = dlopen(lib, RTLD_GLOBAL|RTLD_LAZY)
            break
...

It's more subtle than that. On OS X, both `.so` and `.dylib` exist but with a different purpose: `.so` is meant for "loadable modules" to be opened at runtime by some `dlopen()` mechanism, which `.dylib` is for dynamic linking of libraries (linking done when a program a started). For example, Cython extensions would use `.so` but the libraries in `$SAGE_LOCAL/lib` would use `.dylib`.

On Linux, this difference simply doesn't exist.

I think all this

```
sage: from site import getsitepackages
sage: site_packages = getsitepackages()[0]
sage: from sage_setup.find import installed_files_by_module
sage: files_by_module = installed_files_by_module(site_packages)
sage: from sage.misc.sageinspect import shared_lib_extension
sage: files_by_module['sage.structure.sage_object'].pop().endswith(shared_lib_extension())
```
can be replaced by

```
sage: sage.structure.sage_object.__file__.endswith(shared_lib_extension())
```
