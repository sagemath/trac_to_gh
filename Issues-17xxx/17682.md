Some places in the code and some doctests assume that the filename extension for shared libraries is `.so`, while it is `.dll` in cygwin. The attached patch defines once and for all the correct extension depending on the platform, and uses it where necessary.

Ahem, I do not completely understand what the patch does (i'm new to sage/python);
Question: what are the consequences, e.g. for `init_libsingular()`
in `src/sage/libs/singular/singular.pyx`?

*snip*:

```
...
    for extension in ["so", "dylib", "dll"]:
        lib = os.environ['SAGE_LOCAL']+"/lib/libsingular."+extension
        if os.path.exists(lib):
            handle = dlopen(lib, RTLD_GLOBAL|RTLD_LAZY)
            break
...

Short answer: the code you show is fine, no need to change anything.

Long answer: shared libraries usually have the extension `.so` on unix-likes. So, some parts of sage's code assume that this is a universal extension, and use it for loading or doctesting purposes. This leads to problems on cygwin, where the extension is `.dll`. The patch fixes this code, replacing the universal `.so` with an extension depending on the platform (`.dll` on windows, `.so`anywhere else). Code that already considered the possibility of different extensions is fine.

There is yet another difference on MacOS, where the extension for shared libraries can be `.so` or `.dylib` -- this means that, in this case, there is no universal possible choice, so I picked `.so` since it is the most common in sage. In the case of libsingular, I don't know if it is built using `.so` or `.dylib` (and I don't have a Mac to test). If it is `.so`, one might consider using the patch to predict the correct extension, but in any case the current code works fine.

It's more subtle than that. On OS X, both `.so` and `.dylib` exist but with a different purpose: `.so` is meant for "loadable modules" to be opened at runtime by some `dlopen()` mechanism, which `.dylib` is for dynamic linking of libraries (linking done when a program a started). For example, Cython extensions would use `.so` but the libraries in `$SAGE_LOCAL/lib` would use `.dylib`.

On Linux, this difference simply doesn't exist.
