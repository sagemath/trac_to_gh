After moving modules to the new coercion model (#10513), we should make `sage.modules.matrix_morphism.MatrixMorphism_abstract` use single-underscore methods for addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication and composition. 

Depends on #10513

Note that I did not talk about a cdef class with two base classes. I am talking about one Python class inheriting from two cdef base classes, which are considered to have compatible layout, but still things get wrong.

I just tried to reconstruct the example, but it seemingly just worked. So, perhaps the problem is actually solved one way or the other. If I recall correctly, the problematic cdef attributes included domain or codomain---which has now changed, because of weak referencing. Perhaps this change has not only fixed a memory leak, but has also worked around the c layout problem.
