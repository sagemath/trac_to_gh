#17112 was some needed reorganization of these resources.  This ticket continues the process, especially by emphasizing direct steps for Mac.  This was inspired by an email exchange with a nearly-thwarted would-be developer and the steps she took.

Yes, I totally agree, but I felt like it was only possible within sections of one manual, since each of them is built separately.  (Otherwise, for instance, we could link to localizations of documents.)

The fixes are all good (I only focused on new updates, didn't think to update those things) except

```diff
-This section details the technical prerequisites needed on any platform. See
-`System-specific requirements`_ and `Installing prerequisites`_ for details
-on how to acquire these. :ref:`Mac OS X <section_macprereqs>` has
-special instructions as developer tools do not come standard.
+This section details the technical prerequisites needed on all platforms. See
+also the `System-specific requirements`_ below.
```
I purposely added all this originally because, in my experience with new developers that truly have no developing experience (and I do have a significant amount of experience with them), that little extra verbiage and especially the two additional links will make a big difference.  The system requirements is not the same as actually installing them, and for many Mac users this is really foreign territory.  Even if you insist on removing the Mac words, please do keep the installing prereqs link.

On the other hand, too much text and superfluous references can also be confusing.

> The system requirements is not the same as actually installing them, and for many Mac users this is really foreign territory.

In the guide, the sections "System-specific requirements" and "Installing prerequisites" are very close together, so a user clicking on "System-specific requirements" will see the "Installing prerequisites" section also. Moreover, "System-specific requirements" even has an explicit link for Mac OS X in the first sentence.

So I don't see what the problem could be with my changes.

Yes, I thought about this a fair amount.  Unfortunately one doesn't have a focus group to test this on.

The problem isn't your change, it's the huge amount of text below it.  But I have come up with what I think will be a good compromise - one moment.

I tried to remove the words "General requirements" but got lots of errors; ReST is very strict about levels.  I still think this is a better solution, hopefully you will agree.
