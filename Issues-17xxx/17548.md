There are various bugs in `Partitions`/`Compositions`, especially when many constraints are combined:

```
sage: C = Partitions(10, min_part=2, max_slope=-1)
sage: [5,3,2] in C
True
sage: C.list()
[[10], [8, 2], [7, 3], [6, 4]]
```

```
sage: C = Compositions(5, max_part=2, min_slope=1, inner=[2])
sage: [2,1,2] in C
False
sage: C.list()
[[2, 1, 2]]
```

When slopes are equal, things often go wrong:

```
sage: C = Compositions(4, min_slope=0, max_slope=0)
sage: [1,1,1,1] in C
True
sage: C.list()
[[4], [2, 2]]
```

```
sage: C = Partitions(6, min_slope=-1, max_slope=-1)
sage: [3,2,1] in C
True
sage: C.list()
[[6]]
```

Contradictory length bounds still give results:

```
sage: C = Compositions(6, min_length=3, max_length=2)
sage: [4,1,1] in C
False
sage: C.list()[0]
[4, 1, 1]
```

```
sage: C = Compositions(3, max_length=2, inner=[1,1,1])
sage: [1,1,1] in C
False
sage: C.list()
[[1, 1, 1]]
```

```
sage: C = Compositions(10, outer=[4], inner=[1,1])
sage: [4,6] in C
False
sage: C.list()
[[4, 6], [3, 7], [2, 8], [1, 9]]
```

`max_part` is not respected:

```
sage: C = Compositions(4, max_part=2, min_slope=1)
sage: [1,3] in C
False
sage: C.list()
[[1, 3]]
```

This is horribly wrong:

```
sage: Compositions(7, max_part=4, inner=[1], min_slope=1).list()
[[3, 5], [1, 3, 4]]
```

The following command hangs:

```
sage: Compositions(4, inner=[2], outer=[2,2], min_slope=0).list()
...
```

Strange exception which really shouldn't be an exception:

```
sage: Compositions(10, inner=[1,1], max_slope=-1)
...
ValueError: floor does not satisfy the max slope condition
```

One possible fix is given by #17920.

<a id='comment:7'></a>This is actually bad input: the slopes should be negative (to be useful for partitions). From the documentation of `Partitions`:

```
- ``min_slope=k`` specifies that the partitions have slope at least
  `k`; the slope is the difference between successive parts.
```
The second input is actually correct, that is the only partition of 5 with a positive slope (provided you don't count trailing 0's, which is how Sage currently behaves). With that being said, the internal assumptions of `IntegerListsLex` are also being broken with `min_slope > max_slope == 0`, so it's no surprise bad data is being returned.

This is confusing: the difference between `a` and `b` is `a-b` and not `b-a`. But hopefully, it is clear in the doctest.

I was not able to write a patch that checks all assumptions and returns an exception in this case. If these assumptions are so complicated to check we cannot ask the users to check them for themselves before calling the function. Some of them are probably calling this function on bad input, and they are taking a big risk.

<a id='comment:25'></a>Hello,

Two bug-feature report.

1. Depending on the input, the floor is sometimes `0` and sometimes `1`:

```python
sage: IntegerListsLex(5, length=3).list()               # ok: it is 0
[[5, 0, 0],
 [4, 1, 0],
 [4, 0, 1],
...
 [0, 2, 3],
 [0, 1, 4],
 [0, 0, 5]]
sage: IntegerListsLex(5, length=3, max_slope=0).list()   # ok: it is 0
[[5, 0, 0], [4, 1, 0], [3, 2, 0], [3, 1, 1], [2, 2, 1]]
sage: IntegerListsLex(5, max_slope=0).list()             # now it is 1
[[5], [4, 1], [3, 2], [3, 1, 1], [2, 2, 1], [2, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]]
```

2. The iterator is sometimes completely wrong when the set is infinite:

```python
sage: it = iter(IntegerListsLex(5))
sage: for _ in range(10): print it.next()
[5]
[4, 1]
[4, 0, 1]
[4, 0, 0, 1]
[4, 0, 0, 0, 1]
[4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
[4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
[4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
[4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
[4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
```

This is not a bug because this has trailing 0's and there is no way to have a non-trailing 0 in the last output. See this part of the documentation:

```
Two valid integer lists are considered equivalent if they only
differ by trailing zeroes. In this case, only the list with the
least number of trailing zeroes will be produced.
```
It's subtle, but again, not a bug.

> [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]

This is also not a bug because there are no other conditions on the lists and each of these are the next in lex ordering.

This is a bug! An iterator (finite or infinite) must eventually return every element of the set.

It does, but it is doing it by lex ordering, which is different than by length-then-lex ordering. Its the same as doing a Cartesian product of `{1,2} x NN` and getting `[1, 0]`, `[1, 1]`, `[1, 2]`, ... Is that a bug to you then too?

OK, listing all elements in lex ordering might not be possible. Fine, then **raise an exception** instead of returning a wrong answer.

Of course that's a bug.

+1 -- It is a reasonable basic principle that when iterating over a set S, for every x in S the iterator must eventually return x, as (Jereon said above).  If this is impossible due to constraints on the order of iteration, there should be an error...

<a id='comment:45'></a>The branch I've attached fixes the length bounds and when `min_slope == max_slope`. However these violate the internal assumptions:

```
sage: C = Compositions(4, max_part=2, min_slope=1)
sage: Compositions(7, max_part=4, inner=[1], min_slope=1)
```
since the ceiling defaults to `max_part`, which is always 2/4 and has a slope of 0 and violates the `min_slope` condition (i.e., the ceiling must be increasing).

Also FTR, the last one in the description is the error message that was wanted (precisely because it violates the conditions).

My point with the last one is that it should simply be allowed input. There is no fundamental reason why

```
sage: Compositions(10, inner=[1,1], max_slope=-1)
```
shouldn't "just work".

Then you really should add checks in the code raising an exception if the condition is not satisfied. If you do add such checks, make sure to add them to `IntegerListsLex` and not the `Partitions`/`Compositions` front-ends.

But even better would be to just allow such input.
