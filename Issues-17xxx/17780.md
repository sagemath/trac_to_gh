Devra Garfinkle defined an algorithm which sends a signed permutation to a pair of standard domino tableaux, which each entry `1, 2, ..., n` appears as a domino instead of a single cell, and rows and columns remain increasing. The algorithm is similar to the Robinson-Schensted correspondence on permutations. We implement it here. We also include an algorithm which moves a domino tableaux through open cycles, and one which specializes it to one of special shape.
