Devra Garfinkle defined an algorithm which sends a signed permutation to a pair of standard domino tableaux, which each entry `1, 2, ..., n` appears as a domino instead of a single cell, and rows and columns remain increasing. The algorithm is similar to the Robinson-Schensted correspondence on permutations. We implement it here. We also include an algorithm which moves a domino tableaux through open cycles, and one which specializes it to one of special shape. This algorithm has applications to representation theory and Kazhdan-Lustig cells. Note that signed permutations are lists of the form `[[a_1,e_1], ... [a_n,e_n]]` where `[a_1, ... a_n]` is a permutation, and `e_n` are just `1` or `-1`. Domino tableaux are listed just like tableaux.
