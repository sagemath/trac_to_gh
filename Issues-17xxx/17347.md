It says tornado was not found. numpy is found, and tornado is listed as a dep of ipython but not matplotib. Which is funny because I thought tornado was included in sage because it was unbundled from matplotlib in version 1.3 and I am thought it was part of the matplotlib ticket. If not I am considering myself negligent because I spent quite some time reviewing the ticket - including having to get pkg-config included for it.

So there is a dependency of matplotlib which is not scheduled for installation before matplotlib by the makefile? Or is the tornado thing a red herring?

Anyway, thank you -- `make distclean` fixed it. Feel free to drop this ticket if there is nothing in here that remains to be fixed.

A red herring it was at the top of the file you put on dropbox, may be it wasn't done the first time you installed MPL on 6.4.betaX but it is sorted now.

I don't think so. I think your install was in a unhappy state for some reason. the distclean restored it a clean and happy state. 

I personally think this should be closed.

For the record, both numpy and tornado are listed as explicit dependencies of matplotlib in `build/deps`. So I agree that there is no bug here.
