It says tornado was not found. numpy is found, and tornado is listed as a dep of ipython but not matplotib.

So there is a dependency of matplotlib which is not scheduled for installation before matplotlib by the makefile? Or is the tornado thing a red herring?

Anyway, thank you -- `make distclean` fixed it. Feel free to drop this ticket if there is nothing in here that remains to be fixed.

A red herring it was at the top of the file you put on dropbox, may be it wasn't done the first time you installed MPL on 6.4.betaX but it is sorted now.

I don't think so. I think your install was in a unhappy state for some reason. the distclean restored it a clean and happy state. 

I personally think this should be closed.
