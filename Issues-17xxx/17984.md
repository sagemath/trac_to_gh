In the catch-all `structure/parent.pyx:Parent.__contains__` we depend on the construction `bool(item==self(item))` to get the right result for, e.g. `sqrt(3) in RR/CC` but `bool(RR/CC(sqrt(3))==sqrt(3))` being `False` a trick was applied by the author that makes the function always return `True`. This trick uses the fact that Maxima doesn't know about the rings and will raise an exception, which is then caught.

This way of programming strikes me as very wrong and previously I supported the notion that dedicated `__contains__` methods for both RR/CC were needed. As you can see from the discussion this was not wanted.

Of course, as soon as we want to get rid of Maxima this odd behaviour must be simulated, because there is no way to test containment in these inexact rings in a generic way.

In order to make it more reliable the way we treat inclusion in inexact rings needs to be reconsidered.

Previously this ticket proposed that:
...dedicated `__contains__` methods for both rings are needed.

<a id='comment:20'></a>I guess the first basic question is how to resolve the following inconsistency:

```
sage: bool(RR(pi) == pi)
True
sage: bool(RR(sqrt(2)) == sqrt(2))
False
```
The second basic question is, if we agree on what the correct result is, is this also the result that `x in RR` should return?

Personally I would answer the second question with "yes", if only for consistency; there is undoubtedly a lot of code using `x in P` that expects this behaviour, and it would be very inconvenient to change this just for `P = RR` and `P = CC` because of what users intuitively expect when typing `x in RR`.

The first question is harder.  One could argue that `bool(RR(pi) == pi)` should indeed return `True` because the two numbers become equal when converting to the lowest common precision (just as is done when comparing elements of two instances of `RealField` with different precision).  On the other hand, this is dangerous due to rounding errors:

```
sage: def t(x): return bool(RR(x) == x)
sage: t(sqrt(2))
False
sage: t(sqrt(3))
False
sage: t(sqrt(3) - sqrt(2))
True
```
Hence I am tending towards the opinion that if `x` is some exact element, then `bool(RR(x) == x)` should return `True` if and only if `x` is exactly representable in `RR`.  Unfortunately this moves `RR` a bit further away from the mathematical field **R** than it already is, but I guess that is better than pretending that `RR` is a general-purpose model for **R**.

I didn't say anytyhing about the case where `x` is an element of an inexact ring.

I don't understand this; the fact that `x` can be converted into `RR` does not imply that it is an element of `RR`.  The element `RR(x)` is just some candidate for "the element of `RR` that is equal to `x`", but we don't yet know if `x` and `RR(x)` are indeed equal in a meaningful way.  I guess you are talking about the case where `x.parent() is SR`.  Doesn't `bool(RR(x) == x)` then compare two elements of `SR`, one being the original `x` and the other being the result of converting to `RR` and back?  These can still be compared in a non-trivial way.

Elements of `RR` (except infinities and `NaN`) are certain fractions whose numerator and denominator are bounded and whose denominator is a power of 2.  Hence 1/16 is representable in `RR`, but 1/3 is not.

Different people have different viewpoints about this, but above I was thinking of elements of `RR` (again except infinities and `NaN`) as exactly representing a certain subset of (mathematical) real numbers.  The interpretation "an element of `RR` is a real number with some error" is just interpretation.

This method makes sense in `RIF` but not in `RR`: a number is exact in `RIF` if the associated interval is a singleton. This is very different from the proposition of having a method `RR.is_exactly_representable(...)`.

I do not like the fact that we treat `RR` as a subset of the real numbers and at the same time a field

``` 
sage: RR.is_field()
True
sage: RR in Fields()
True
```
