```
Corner sum matrix method on AlternatingSignMatrix has incorrect output:

See the following example:

```
a = AlternatingSignMatrix([[0,0,1],[1,0,0],[0,1,0]])
a.corner_sum_matrix()
[0 0 0 0]
[0 0 1 1]
[0 0 1 2]
[0 1 2 3]
```
The result should be the transpose of what is displayed.
See the definition in Section 2 of !http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0208125. 

```
[0 0 0 0]
[0 0 0 1]
[0 1 1 2]
[0 1 2 3]
```
Also, the documentation has this example, which is wrong and should be changed.
