sage: e

sage: [type(x) for x in e]

<div id="comment:1" align="right">comment:1</div>

Thats really a pattern that is all over the combinatorics stuff:

```
sage: iter(Partitions(4)).next()[0]
4
sage: type(_)
<type 'int'>
```
or

```
sage: g = SymmetricGroup(3).gen(0)
sage: type(g(1))
<type 'int'>
```
I've tripped more than once over this, its really common to want to do `n.factorial()` for some integer from a partition.
