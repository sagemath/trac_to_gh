<a id='comment:2'></a>Hello,

1. Could you motivate a bit more this change. I do not find simpler to use a `key` function instead of a `cmp` function.

2. It does not apply on the most recent version of Sage.

3. I found the docstring confusing

```
def indices_key(self):
    r""""
    A comparison function on sets which gives a linear extension
    of the inclusion order
```
   This is **not** a comparison function (which would have pairs as input)!

More to come, when you answer 1

Vincent

In Python 3 the `cmp` keyword has been removed in favor of `key` and `reverse` arguments. To reduce the overhead for a user to provide `cmp` and `key` function (e.g. one for sage's `print_options()` and the other for python's `sort()`) I suggest to harmonize the parameters.

<a id='comment:20'></a>ok, looks almost good to me. 

in the example

```
sorted(A.indices(), key=cmp_to_key(A.indices_cmp))
```
one should use instead the new `indices_key`

Maybe also we should avoid using `cmp_to_key` as much as possible.
