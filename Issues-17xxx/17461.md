Hello,

It is not that simple to get rid of deprecated classes:

```
sage -t --long structure/sage_object.pyx
**********************************************************************
File "structure/sage_object.pyx", line 1417, in sage.structure.sage_object.unpickle_all
Failed example:
    sage.structure.sage_object.unpickle_all()  # (4s on sage.math, 2011)

File "structure/sage_object.pyx", line 1425, in sage.structure.sage_object.unpickle_all
Failed example:
    sage.structure.sage_object.unpickle_all()
```
Either you feel like implementing a work around (i.e. fake classes like in `sage.combinat.permutation.py` (see the very end of the file) or you launch a vote on sage-devel to empty the pickle jar of these classes.

As far as I see you did not solve the failing doctests in `sage.structure.sage_object`. So unless you care to explain why it should not be solved I put it back to needs work.

I guess you mean january 2015, not june.

It's easy: you are removing code deprecated in Sage 6.1, released 2014-01-30. That plus one year equals 2015-01-30.

Oh right. You set a different deadline #17462.

Honestly Jeroen, why do you make our life more complicated for a month nobody cares about ? You know very well that even if this ticket is merged in a beta the stable release will not be made until weeks/months later.

Besides, unless you can point me to a rule somewhere that says that the 'official date' is the one of the stable release, why should we disregard the date given by git which corresponds to the day the release manager merged it ? Please, let's keep it simple. It's not worth anybody's time.

Honestly Nathann, why do you care so much about urgently removing deprecated code? There is nothing wrong about deprecated code just sitting around for a while.

> You know very well that even if this ticket is merged in a beta the stable release will not be made until weeks/months later.

I have no idea when the next release will be, that's up to the release manager.

> Besides, unless you can point me to a rule somewhere that says that the 'official date' is the one of the stable release, why should we disregard the date given by git which corresponds to the day the release manager merged it ?

Deprecations are meant for Sage *users*, not developers. For users, it's obvious that the date of the stable release is what counts.
