It should be possible to initialize a `FinitelyPresentedGroup` (in `sage.groups.finitely_presented_group`) directly from a GAP group as follows

```
sage: F_gap = libgap.FreeGroup("x", "y")
sage: x,y = libgap.GeneratorsOfGroup(F_gap)
sage: rels_gap = libgap([x**2, y**3, (x*y)**5])
sage: G_gap = F_gap / rels_gap
sage: libgap.IsFpGroup(G_gap)
true
sage: from sage.groups.finitely_presented import FinitelyPresentedGroup
sage: FinitelyPresentedGroup(G_gap)
# DOES NOT WORK
sage: G_gap.sage()
# DOES NOT WORK
```
Even with free groups it fails

```
sage: FreeGroup(F_gap)
# DOES NOT WORK
sage: F_gap.sage()
# DOES NOT WORK
```

Hi!
I'm working on this ticket currently. I think that it is more or less ready, but I struggle with the following behavior:

```
f = FreeGroup("x,y")
g = f/ [x^2*y^-1, x^3*y^2, x*y*x^-1*y^-1]
NameError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-4-6f3ccf45fba8> in <module>()
----> 1 g = f/ [x**Integer(2)*y**-Integer(1), x**Integer(3)*y**Integer(2), x*y*x**-Integer(1)*y**-Integer(1)]

NameError: name 'y' is not defined
```
while

```
f.<x,y> = FreeGroup()
g = f/ [x^2*y^-1, x^3*y^2, x*y*x^-1*y^-1]
```
works without any issues. Probably I'm missing something obvious, but how can I 'register' variables globally without <,> notion? Is there some sort of function that is wrapped by <>? My goal is to write something like this:

```
names = repr(free_group.GeneratorsOfGroup()).strip('[   ]')                             
free_group = FreeGroup(names)
```

Sorry, I should have been clearer. The only issue is that

```
sage: F.<x,y> = FreeGroup(2)
sage: G = F/[x**2*y,x*y]
sage: G
Finitely presented group < x, y | x^2*y, x*y >
sage: G_gap = G._gap_()
sage: from sage.groups.finitely_presented import FinitelyPresentedGroup
sage: FinitelyPresentedGroup(G_gap)
** BOOM **
sage: FinitelyPresentedGroup(gap_group=G_gap)
** BOOM **
```
What are you trying to do?!

In the mean time, I realized that there is a function `wrap_FpGroup` so I think that there is almost nothing to do to make it work.

I try to exactly what you are proposing. But I've struggle with the following:

```
fp_gap = libgap.FreeGroup("x", "y")
fp_sage = wrap_FreeGroup(fp_gap)

g = fp_sage / [x^2*y^-1, x^3*y^2, x*y*x^-1*y^-1]
*EXCEPTION*
NameError: name 'y' is not defined
```

I knew this too, but it does not work due to this exception. As I understand, the code:

```
f.<x,y> = FreeGroup()
```
makes some magic and the code:

```
f = FreeGroup("x, y")
```
doesn't do this magic. This whole thing completely breaks relations addition. Probably, I should ask on sage-devel.

```
sage: f = FreeGroup("x,y")
sage: f.inject_variables()
Defining x, y
sage: g = f/ [x^2*y^-1, x^3*y^2, x*y*x^-1*y^-1]
```
One of the points is that a command like `f = ...` should only define `f`, not anything else. So having `f = FreeGroup("x, y")` not define `x` or `y` is intentional.
