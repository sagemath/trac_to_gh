Hi Jeroen,

> It was a question, not an attack...

Oops, sorry, I guess there just has been a bit too much turmoil on the
topic lately :-) We just got uncomfortable with the "blocker", for at
this stage it's hard to predict how much time this will take (Sage
days are great for sprints, but you get easily side-tracked). Any idea
when the next release of Sage is likely to come out?

In any cases, here is the current plan. We are having a sprint here to
work on reimplementing IntegerListLex from scratch. We believe it's
possible to have a correct iteration algorithm, with complexity
roughly linear in the output in the common use cases, that will detect
and report any invalid input. There will be situations where computing
the next element may run forever. In those cases, we will report
beforehand a warning, which the user will be able to silence by
signing a waiver after having read the fine prints in the
documentation.

If we can use the occasion to get generalizations for free, we will do
so; but otherwise we will focus on getting the existing features
right. Similarly, we will try to design the algorithm to potentially
support cythonization / parallelism / implementation as a standalone
C++ library, but postpone those for later.

And we will reuse everything we can from your work!

Cheers,
                                   Nicolas

I made it a blocker not because of this specific ticket, but because *something* needs to be done: either a proper stopgap needs to be put back (which is essentially reverting #17898), or we switch to my correct-but-slow polyhedron implementation, or this ticket needs to be finished.

I can push the code, but currently the interface with partitions and compositions is still broken and a lot of functions (like next, first etc ) that are also used in integer_vector need to be deprecated. That has not been done yet.

Here are the failures I got upon make ptestlong:

```
sage -t --long src/sage/doctest/test.py  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t --long src/sage/tests/interrupt.pyx  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t --long src/sage/parallel/decorate.py  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t --long src/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/lseries_ell.py  # Timed out
sage -t --long src/sage/modular/arithgroup/arithgroup_perm.py  # Timed out
sage -t --long src/sage/sets/set_from_iterator.py  # 3 doctests failed
sage -t --long src/sage/combinat/words/words.py  # 5 doctests failed
sage -t --long src/sage/algebras/weyl_algebra.py  # 3 doctests failed
```
The last three are diagnosed (the new IntegerListLex was missing the feature of accepting an iterable for n) and is being fixed. The rest look more like unrelated failures.

Helloooooooooooo,

Here are some comments (mostly doc) about the current branch

- About

  ```
  An integer list is a list l of nonnegative integers, its parts. The length
  of l is the number of its parts

  Note Two valid integer lists are considered equivalent if they only differ by
  trailing zeroes.
  ```

  Unless the length of a list is the number of its nonzero entries, it does not
  seem to be properly defined.

- `The constraints on the lists are as follows:` -- in what follows you use
  a variable `l` often (probably one of the lists): could you say so explicitly?

- It seems that currently the method accepts input that does not satisfy the
  constraints that you list, i.e.:

  ```
  sage: IntegerListsLex(min_n=4)
  Integer lists of sum between 4 and 0 satisfying certain constraints
  sage: list(IntegerListsLex(min_n=4))
  []
  ```

  Should they really be considered as 'constraints', if the code accepts them
  and returns sensible output (i.e. empty sets)? When I read those lines, I
  expected the code to raise a `ValueError` exception on them.

- `Lower and upper bounds`: the text about constant values for floor/ceiling
  belongs to the INPUT block.

- `waiver` -- the description of `waiver` in the INPUT block is very
  mysterious. If it is only meant for internal purposes, could you say so in its
  description?

- `Next we obtain all lists of sum 4 and length 4 such that l[i] <= i:` --
  missing backticks at the end.

- Comparative timings: should they really appear in the function's
  documentation? To me the trac ticket is the right place for that.

- There are two 'TESTS' sections

- `self.warning = False # warning for dangerous (but possibly valid) usage`
  -- could say what this flag does?

- the INPUT blocks says that `n` can be a list. Could you add there an
  explanation of what it means?

- About the message

  ```
  warn("""When the user specifies a method, then (s)he is responsible that the algorithm
             will not hang. Also note that the specified function should start at 0 rather than 1.
             Before trac#17979 the indexing was ambiguous and sometimes started at 1.""")
  ```

  From time to time we receive bug reports on sage-devel or sage-support in
  which the users beg us to forgive them in case what they think might be a bug
  could actually be their mistake. Could this message be changed to something
  more `technical`? Something like `you defined ceiling=[...] to be a function,
  and we cannot swear that this call will not hang`?

- About the copyright header: I never saw any patch remove the name of other
  persons in a copyright header. Don't know what the policy is.

  ```diff
  -#       Copyright (C) 2007 Mike Hansen <mhansen@gmail.com>,

That's not really true, there are many tickets which just remove whole modules, including the copyright header. If the whole module is completely rewritten (but only then), it's valid to remove the copyright header.

> It's a pity that this code is sometimes very fast and sometimes very slow depending on the input. My approach #17920 was slower, but in a more "uniform" way, never so slow that it was unusable.

This is probably because it is hard to check whether the list that you are trying to build can be "extended" into a list that satisfies all conditions.

I have not gone through the code yet, but it seems that the strategy is to try all possible choices for the first integer, then try all possible choices for the second (etc.) each time checking the constraints on what has already been decided (but not guessing anything about the future)

Thus, and still assuming that I did not misunderstand anything, the following set (which contains only one element) will only be returned after around `2^n` operations:

```
sage: n=20; IntegerLists(n, length=n,max_part=1).list()
```

Certainly some "cuts" can be added to detect when a partial sequence cannot be extended.

I think that returning the empty set is the right answer here. As long as the question makes sense *mathematically*, there should be an answer, not an exception.

The only thing which can be a `ValueError` exception would be a negative length, since that doesn't even have a mathematical meaning. But I know from #17920 that some `Partitions` code gives a negative minimum length, so a negative value for `min_length` should just be treated as 0.

This is not a tricky question but still takes forever:

```
sage: IntegerLists(1, min_part=0, max_part=0).list()

In fact, the point of the algorithm is that there *is* guessing on the
future; in most not-too-degenerate cases, one can detect that a branch
will lead to nowhere and cut it.

At this point, the complexity of the following is not linear as it
ought to be (one should be able to do the detection work faster by
caching critical data), but it definitely is polynomial with a small
degree (most likely quadratic), and very far from 2^n:

```
    sage: n=20; IntegerLists(n, length=n,max_part=1).list()
    sage: n=1000
    sage: %time IntegerListsLex(n, length=n,max_part=1).list()
    CPU times: user 852 ms, sys: 25.5 ms, total: 877 ms
    Wall time: 831 ms
    sage: n=2000
    sage: %time x = IntegerListsLex(n, length=n,max_part=1).list()
    CPU times: user 3.15 s, sys: 24.2 ms, total: 3.17 s
    Wall time: 3.15 s
```

Cheers,
                          Nicolas

The length of a list is the number of its entries, including entries of size zero.  i.e. [2, 0, 1, 0] is a list of length 4.  It is equivalent to the list [2, 0, 1], but has a different length.

The results from the algorithm should be mathematically correct if an error isn't raised--in this case, the set of such lists is empty, as advertised.  While I was working through the initialization code yesterday, I did notice that it would be reasonable to include as few constraints on the initialization as possible and just give an empty output when conditions are contradictory, but I didn't have time to ensure that the algorithm was sound under arbitrary permutations of bad constraints.  At the moment, everything that is returned should be correct.

Updated.

Also updated.  The waiver parameter is meant to be user-facing; it's purpose is to suppress a warning raised when the input parameters can't be checked computationally for cases that don't hang.  This situation can occur when the user specifies an arbitrary function for the floor and ceiling parameters, so the purpose here is to verify that the user has thought carefully about what they are asking the algorithm to compute.

Fixed.

Probably not, that was mainly for comparison during development.  It's also old at this point, so I'll add current comparative timings to another comment.


> - There are two 'TESTS' sections

That is true.  Fixed.


> - `self.warning = False # warning for dangerous (but possibly valid) usage`
>   -- could say what this flag does?

This is mostly an internal marker, and just keeps track of whether we are in a potentially
hanging use case (custom user function) that requires a warning to the user.  I've
changed it to `self._warning` to indicate that it's an internal marker, and made
the comment more verbose for the curious.


> - the INPUT blocks says that `n` can be a list. Could you add there an
>   explanation of what it means?

Added an explanation.  (This just allows you to specify multiple allowable values for the list sum.)

The main reason is that `min_part` and `max_part` are redundant in purpose with `floor` and `ceiling`, so the hope would be to deprecate that usage at some point.

There were places in the code of the old integer_list.py that used either convention, and integer_vector.py consistently started indexing at 1.

> It seems that `[1,3]` will never appear in the output!

Not a bug, but an issue that's worth discussing.  The premise of IntegerListsLex, as I understand it, is that it should return integer lists satisfying certain constraints, in lexicographic ordering, starting with the largest.  The lists returned in your example are exactly what they should be for this specification--none of them is smaller than `[1,3]` in lex ordering, since the `4` or `3` in the first position is larger than the corresponding `1`.

The issue is in specifying a priori a total ordering on the set that may not be isomorphic with that on NN (in fact, may not even be well-ordered).  Does it even make sense to call an object which iterates through a proper countable subset of a set an iterator?  On the other hand, the iteration itself might still be useful in this case.

At the very least, this behavior is shared with that of the old implementation.

I updated the formatting of the warning (also the message to be more explicit/verbose), so check if it looks reasonable to you.

Here's what our thought process was concerning when to raise a warning message.  We could easily do some additional computations to find certain cases where the specified parameters make giving a custom function safe.  However, one of the complaints with the old version was that it was difficult to understand how the parameters affected the output.  If we make it "sometimes" verifiably safe to use a custom function, depending on the circumstances, then that's another point of complexity for the user to follow--but if we just raise a warning whenever a user uses a custom floor or ceiling function (but only if they haven't "signed a waiver" by specifying `waiver=True`), that simplifies the interface for the user.

Also note that the example you gave could be handled by the following specification without raising a warning:

```
sage: IntegerListsLex(5, ceiling=[0,1,2,3,4], length=5)
```

I have plans to implement some parameter adjustments and cardinality checking for the cases when a user doesn't specify a custom floor or ceiling function which would catch this issue.  Currently the code doesn't do any extra handling on cases where the floor and ceiling functions intersect, so currently it tries to find the largest possible value for the first position in the list, and determines that there is no largest one.  The new checks would also make use of the slope conditions to catch something like:

```
sage: IntegerListsLex(length=3, max_n=Infinity, max_slope=1, ceiling=[Infinity, 1, 3], floor=[0, 1, 3])
```

For the moment, it does raise an error in this kind of situation, but it also doesn't hang or return an incorrect result.  It also might be useful to give a more descriptive error message for when the possible values in a position are unbounded.

> It **is** a bug, see also the discussion starting at [[#17548 comment:29](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/17548#comment:29)].

Yes, I have glanced through that discussion.

The point is that if it is a bug, then it's a bug in the specification, not the code, since we are requiring the output to be in lexicographic order.  However, if we don't want to call it an iterator because it doesn't satisfy the contract of eventually reaching every element in the set, then the class won't interact well with the many places that use iterators in Python and Sage.  Can you propose a solution to this?

Hellooooo,

> The length of a list is the number of its entries, including entries of size zero.  i.e. [2, 0, 1, 0] is a list of length 4.  It is equivalent to the list [2, 0, 1], but has a different length.

May I ask where in the function it is used that two lists are equivalent when they only differ by the number of trailing zeroes ?

If it is only when `min_length<max_length`, could you add this mention as a note in the documentation of those parameters (input block)?

Oh, the current behaviour is fine for me!

I wonder about that... Instead of letting the code hang, wouldn't it be better to first "explore a bit the floor/ceiling parameters" ? If you see that up to 10<sup>10</sup> all the values of ceiling do not sum to n, then say that something is wrong straight away?

The are two possible solutions:
1. raise an exception if the iterator doesn't iterate over all elements.
2. drop the "lexicographic order" requirement.

This is because some other classes refer to next, first etc in combinat.integer_list which we do not have any longer in the new implementation. It is also useful right now to compare against the timing of the old implementation!

I just changed `infinity` to `_infinity` to mark that we are currently doing something special; it's a one line change at the begining of the file to switch to `_infinity=Infinity` when the later will be optimized (looking forward to it). That being said, I don't mind changing `_infinity` to `Infinity` in the code if you think this won't bring confusion.

Having alternative implementations that take the second route to
handle those cases is indeed a worthwhile goal. But that's not
`IntegerListsLex`'s job :-)

Here, we shall aim for 1., whenever possible: that is systematically
when floor/ceiling are not functions, and when it's obvious and cheap
otherwise.

I should be able to specify such an input with `floor=myfunc, min_part=1` and the code can optimize this case better than when just specifying the function. [comment:60] is an excellent example of this.

We were experimenting a bit with the API to try to minimize redundancy.
At this point, I have settled for:

- `min_part` to specify a lower bound for all parts
- `floor` to specify lower bounds on the individual parts

What do you think?

Question: if the users passes `floor=f, min_part=i` should `IntegerListsLex` assume that `f(k)` is always at most `i`, or should it wrap `f` to add this guarantee? At this point it does the latter, which of course adds a bit of overhead (which could be tamed with appropriate caching which we will anyway want to do during the Cythonization).

I added this to the documentation, specifying that this example could be  enumerated in lexicographically increasing order but not in lexicographically decreasing order as does `IntegerListsLex`.

Two questions:

- Does anyone have a good suggestion for a better error message?

- Should the error message be created upon creating the parent, or
  when starting the iteration? The advantage of doing it only upon
  iteration is that we can still use the parent for checking
  containment, constructing the polytope, ...

sage: IntegerListsLex(10^100, length=2, min_slope=-2, max_slope=2).list()

The tree traversal code in the iterator class needed some clean-up to make it more clear what was supposed to be happening where, so I did that in the above commit.  I checked the running time to make sure it wasn't affected, and it seems to run as quickly as it did before the modifications.

Hello !

I just finished reading the iterator part of that patch, and it looks solid.

Just a couple of details:

- Shouldn't `i in ZZ` appear before the others in the following line ?

  `return lambda i: l[i] if (i >= 0 and i < len(l) and i in ZZ) else default`

- The documentation reads that `n` can be an iterable, but the code of
  `__contains__` does not agree.

What features would be needed in this new version of `integer_list` to get rid of the `_old` one? We would be better without it.

Nathann

Yes probably. There is a stogap in there, and nobody knows that this file exists, so it is not too dangerous. I was just wondering what the new code couldn't do that the old one handled.

Basicaclly just the `next` and `prev` features. There is a single spot using `next` in the Sage library (in `Compositions` IIRC), and I doubt they are much used elsewhere.

`next` should be rather straightforward to implement if someone needs it. I created #18058 for this.

Cool :-) Thanks for checking!

Given that this is a critical section and an internal function, I just changed this to assume that i is a non negative integer, and only check on i < len(l). Does this sound ok?

This is because `IntegerListsLex(n, ...)` returns a `DisjointEnumeratedSets` of `IntegerListsLex`'s if `n` is an iterable. This way all the rest of the code can just ignore the existence of this feature.

The downside is that `__contains__` is slower (it will run through the different `IntegerListsLex`, and check `__contains__` there). Especially if the iterable is infinite. But that's not an important feature, so that's ok I believe.

Please add also this example:

```

Concerning terminology: is "lexicographic order" really the standard way of refering to this ordering? I would call it "reverse lexicographic" because it starts with the *largest* element first (but I'm not in combinatorics, so if this is standard, then it's fine).

However, I do think this "lexicographic order" needs to be documented somewhere, especially with the behaviour of implicit trailing zeros. Add this example, because it might look counter-intuitive that the `[1]` appears in the middle here:

```
sage: list(IntegerListsLex(max_length=4, max_part=1))
[[1, 1, 1, 1],
 [1, 1, 1],
 [1, 1, 0, 1],
 [1, 1],
 [1, 0, 1, 1],
 [1, 0, 1],
 [1, 0, 0, 1],
 [1],
 [0, 1, 1, 1],
 [0, 1, 1],
 [0, 1, 0, 1],
 [0, 1],
 [0, 0, 1, 1],
 [0, 0, 1],
 [0, 0, 0, 1],
 []]

Note that `IntegerVectors` is used in other classes, such as `Partitions`, so if we wanted to leave it referencing `integer_list_old.py`, then we would probably also want to port the uses of `IntegerVectors` to `IntegerListsLex` wherever that occurs in the library.  `IntegerVectors` also uses some auxiliary input formats such as `inner=[...]` and `outer=[...]`, so we would need to support those in `IntegerListsLex` if we wanted to use this approach.

The reason for this behavior is the following: we identify elements which differ by trailing zeroes up to max_length. That is why the first and second example gives True and the last one gives False (since in this case we are beyond the max_length).

Soooooooooo when you get the list `[2,2,0]` in the output of `.list()`, it represents "all lists beginning by `2,2,0` whose length is included between 3 and 4"? This information is not included in the object itself, it is to be understood by how it was first produced.

This identification of list worries me a bit. The exception in `__iter__` was added because we consider it a bug that some element of the set may never be listed in `__iter__`, and this is exactly the problem we have again here. For a different reason, i.e. because some lists are identified.

The "up to `max_length`" part is a bit arbitrary. I would prefer that these should give the same answer (either both `True` or both `False`):

```
sage: [2,2,0,0] in IntegerListsLex(4,min_length=3,max_length=4)
sage: [2,2,0,0,0] in IntegerListsLex(4,min_length=3,max_length=4)

The parent knows about the min_length and max_length, so it makes sense to identify objects with trailing zeroes in the correct parameter range. In any case, this is the same behavior as in the old version of the code and I do not think we should change this here.

Nathann, this is a different issue! The above issue is just about identifying objects, not about not listing all of them. The issue about not listing all of them is due to the fact that inverse lexicographic order intrinsically (by definition) does not list them all.

Really? `RuntimeError` is "for an error that doesn‚Äôt fall in any of the
other categories", where as we do fit within the `ValueError` category:
"when a built-in operation or function receives an argument that has
the right type but an inappropriate value". Here `IntegerListsLex` did
receive inappropriate value which makes the lexicographic enumeration
improper.

Thanks for the suggestion, but no :-) I haven't spent so much time on
this to still have some non trivial usage of `integer_list_old.py`
lying around. If I don't find someone to review this very soon, I'll
reconsider.

I agree: 15 years ago, from the use cases I had under hand, I though
that this was a neat feature to identify lists up to trailing
zeroes. However this is non trivial to specify properly, and I am now
convinced that this is just a can of worms. We should seriously
consider dropping this feature.

However I believe that this is out of the scope of this ticket,
especially since this would require a change in the specifications,
and cause backward incompatibilities. Up to the fuzziness in this
piece of the specification, it sounds like the code should by now be
correct w.r.t. the current specifications; let's get it done.

Where was it specified that lists with trailing zeros are identified **up to max_length**? It makes absolutely no sense at all that these two questions give a different answer:

```
sage: [2,2,0,0] in IntegerListsLex(4,min_length=3,max_length=4)
sage: [2,2,0,0,0] in IntegerListsLex(4,min_length=3,max_length=4)

formatting fixed.

I agree that it's borderline.

The standard terminology for such an option is indeed `check=False` and `waiver` appears only in `integer_list.py`.

Let me remind everybody here that #17920 is *also* up for formal review.

Comparing both approaches (I am of course not completely unbiased, but I'll really try to be objective):

* **Bugs**: neither #17979 nor #17920 have obvious bugs (although I find [comment:166] dubious at least), both fix #17548. I assume both pass doctests.

* **Features**: #17979 tries to replicate the old behaviour as closely as possible, #17920 generalizes certain conditions (e.g. allowing negative numbers; allowing iteration in non-invlex order) but also adds a few restrictions (e.g. not allowing an iterable for `n`).

* **Interface with rest of Sage**: #17920 only uses the new `IntegerLists` code for `IntegerListsLex`, `Partitions` and `Compositions` (in the other places in Sage where `IntegerListsLex` was used, I didn't find any bugs so I left those). This ticket #17979 replaces the old code in almost all cases (except partially in `IntegerVectors`).

* **Speed**: for simple examples, #17979 is faster. Both implementations have cases where they behave pathologically: for #17979 this is for example `IntegerListsLex(10^10, length=2, min_slope=0, max_slope=0)`, while #17920 behaves badly if the length gets large.

* **Extensibility**: because #17920 is based on polyhedra, it will be much easier to generalize the code (it already does some things more general than #17979). Also, if Sage ever gets better `Polyhedron` code, it will make #17920 faster for free.

+1 to that. This terminology made it much harder for me to understand what the code was doing. Instead of writing this in the code:

```
self.rho = []   # list of current search ranges
self.mu = []    # list of integers
self.j = -1     # index of last element of mu
self.nu = 0     # sum of values in mu       
```

It would probably be clearer to rename those variables (respectively) as

```
self._search_range
self._current_list
self._j
self._current_sum
```

Well, my point was: the specifications *as they are currently written*
are fuzzy. I meant to propose an alternative specification, but
somehow my comment did not make its way into trac. Here it is:

```
When several lists satisfying the constraint differ only by trailing
zeroes, only the shortest one is enumerated (and therefore counted).
```

I believe this is not fuzzy anymore, and matches the current behavior
of the code; and therefore does not require breaking backward
compatibility at this stage.

What do you think?

As a separate question: do you believe like me that we should, in a
later ticket, get rid of this "feature"?

Cheers,

I do think that, by default, we shouldn't output lists with trailing zeros, since this will lead in many cases to infinitely many lists satisfying the constraints. However, I think it's best if the behaviour of `__contains__` really matches the iterator.

If you ever allow negative parts, then the convention of having no trailing zeros becomes very strange, since "non-zero" is no longer a convex condition.

In #17920 I solved this by setting a minimum/maximum value for the last part of a list, if the list is longer than `min_length`. By default, this minimum is 1 with no maximum which gives the same lists as the "identify trailing zeros" convention.

If you take upon you the responsibility of this backward incompatible
change of `__contains__`, I'll go for it. Otherwise, I'd rather not
change this now.

Yeah, that was my original motivation too.

Yup, one more can of worms.

> In #17920 I solved this by setting a minimum/maximum value for the last part of a list, if the list is longer than `min_length`. By default, this minimum is 1 with no maximum which gives the same lists as the "identify trailing zeros" convention.

I definitely prefer this approach. This is also why I hesitated having
`min_part` take precedence over `floor=[...]`, for otherwise you could
just do `floor=[1,1,0,3], min_part=1`.  Well, it's still possible to
achieve this through a floor function but if the limit of the function
is not specified, the code can't decide certain things.

Anyway, let's keep the "feature" for now, and take care of it in a
later ticket in a consistent way with #17920.

Cheers,
                                     Nicolas

The thing is that there really are two different use cases here:

(1) I know what I am doing, you do not need to check my input.

(2) I know what I am doing, don't show me again this warning when
    accessing the more tricky features.

The first use case definitely fits within the usual `check=False`
terminology. I am not so sure about the second one. In fact, I could
imagine situations where I would want (2) without (1): "I'll be using
the tricky features, still double check everything you can".

But maybe it's not worth the additional API complexity, and everything
should just fall into `check=False`. Or rename "waiver=..." to
`warnings=False`. I don't have a strong opinion.

Cheers,

Well, defining precisely the "degenerate cases" is a little research
project by itself :-) But the point is that, in most practical use
cases, the complexity is low (or will be low once an improved
lookahead will be implemented #18055). I am happy to reformulate it
this way if you prefer. But I'd rather keep some short sentence about

To be honest, I don't think there is much difference between these two. Suppose hypothetically that we would add two different flags for (1) and (2), which checks would be controlled by (1) and which by (2)?

I prefer the name `check=False` mainly because it's very standard in Sage.

You really are shaking this guy out! That's good :-)

We looked this up with Anne and the hang was in `._possible_m`; the issue was similar to one we had elsewhere: if the ceiling is 0 at some point and max_slope=0, then we know this should be treated as if there was a ceiling limit of 0. In fact, this was already tested, but not on a moving position; so this was a 1 character fix at the end.

I'll document this method in detail later today.

Ok. Fast being very vague I tried to reformulate this, as well as the
comment on the complexity in `IntegerListsLex`, to be less formal
while still giving some useful indication to the reader.

I very much hope that at some point we will be able to replace this by
precise complexity information, at least within well defined cases.

Ok, we believe we took care of all the comments here, hence back to
needs review. Anne had a first look at the changes in
`integer_vectors`, and Travis will double check probably on Monday.

I have been trough the internal documentation, and spent quite some
time improving it. It could be further improved. Yet, it's probably
best not to spend too much time on it either, since it's likely to get
updated once better look ahead are implemented.

<div id="comment:8" align="right">comment:8</div>

Here are my comments on the current state of things:

- In `integer_list.py`:
  - I don't understand this sentence in the header: "It was then completely rewritten in 2015 by Gillespie, Schilling, and Thiery, with the help of many, to catter for limitations and lack of robustness w.r.t. input." I think by "catter" you mean "cater", but that isn't correct usage of the word.
  - "dyck words" capitalization.
  - I don't like the fact that when the answer is known to be infinite, that the category is `FiniteEnumeratedSets`.
  - You should test also when the input `n` is a tuple.
  - In `_check_lexicographic_iterable`, "Checks" should be "Check"

- In `tutorial.py`, <code>predict when a sequence \`\ell_0,\dot,\ell_k\` is a prefix of some</code>, it should be "\dots".

- In `integer_vector.py`
  - Use absolute paths instead of relative paths: `from combinat import CombinatorialClass`
  - In `list2func`, could we code-afy the doc?
  - In the `__init__`, this is missing the double-colon: "All the attributes below are private; don't use them!"
  - Could we split the long line in the `_repr_`?
  - Should we formally deprecate the `next` method?
  - In the error message "If k is a list, no optional argument is supported", let's make it lowercase.

Otherwise I'm okay with how the code looks (but I did not run tests like Jeroen).

Hmm, this would be generating lists of length at most 1.

Do you see any real use case?

It seems to me that the specification that `min_slope` is either `-oo`
or an integer (and symmetrically for `max_slope`) is quite natural,
and allowing for `+oo` would only mean adding more special cases and
complications to handle for no added value.

Cheers,
                                     Nicolas

Btw: thanks for all the interesting corner cases you posted!

I certainly have no use case. It just seems a bit strange to allow every possible value for `min_slope` except `+Infinity`.

At least make it a `ValueError` if `min_slope=Infinity` or `max_slope=-Infinity` is given.

Travis' comments are fixed now. Here are some further responses:

> - I don't like the fact that when the answer is known to be infinite, that the category is `FiniteEnumeratedSets`.

When IntegerListsLex is enumerable (i.e. the vectors can be iterated over in inverse lex order), then the list is finite. We will explain this in the code.

> - Should we formally deprecate the `next` method?

No, since the plan is to implement this later, so there is no need to deprecate it now.

Oh, actually not quite. Sorry, my bad. I applied Koenig's lemma to
quick. The equivalence finite <=> inverse lexicographically enumerable
is almost true, except for extreme cases like:

```
    sage: IntegerListsLex(n=1)
    -> [1], [0,1], [0,0,1] ...
```

We will think about this a bit more and update the code accordingly.

After some more testing, I wasn't able to find any more cases of wrong output or hangs.

However, the are many cases where a `ValueError` is raised despite the fact that only finitely many lists satisfy the constraints.

Perhaps the exception `The specified parameters do not allow for an inverse lexicographic iterator` should be weakened to `it looks like the specified parameters do not allow for an inverse lexicographic iterator` or something.

Done!

It's in fact the same algorithm as before; just trying to better
highlight the structure, and reorganizing it to fix the logic for the
corner case of length 0 (fixes [comment:243](#comment:243)).

I must admit that I have been focusing on getting this ticket done, at
the price of looking at the details of your ticket right now ... So
thanks much for your pointers; that's helpful!

In this specific case, it turns out that it's really the logic that
had to be fixed, and I won't need `is_trivially_zero`.

With the forward smoothing and partial backward smoothing of the
envelope w.r.t. `min_slope` and `max_slope` the situation should be
better now. At least all the examples your provided work smoothly,
and I am not sure I have an example under hand that would be finite
and not detected as such.


> Perhaps the exception `The specified parameters do not allow for an inverse lexicographic iterator` should be weakened to `it looks like the specified parameters do not allow for an inverse lexicographic iterator` or something.

Yes, until we have something guaranteed, that's the right thing to do.

Hello,

There are several things that I do not quite understand. Could you explain or modify it:

1. The iterator `IntegerListLex` aims to be fast and low-level. What is the point of using the `Parent`/`Element` stuff? Why `ClonableArray` are better than Python lists?

2. Having a nested class seems overkill. The class `_Iter` is created only once in `__iter__`. Moreover, all methods in it starts with `p = self.parent`. Why do you need to create this extra `_Iter` class? Why does it need to be a nested class?

3. Do you have a use case for

  ```
  sage: IntegerListsLex(NN, max_length=3)
  Disjoint union of Lazy family (<lambda>(i))_{i in Non negative integer semiring}
   ```
   The feature only appears once in the doc in a place which does not appear in the reference manual.

4. Why `_check_lexicographic_iterable` is a cached method? And I do not get why is it called from `_Iter` and not at the initialization of `IntegerListsLex`.

Vincent

Salut Vincent!

Thanks for the feedback.

We haven't changed this aspect (in this ticket we focused on
refactoring without changing the API): internally, Python lists are
used; by default, they are converted to ClonableArray upon being
yielded. The element constructor can be customized to return plain
lists if so desired.

In the current state of affairs, this does not really make a
difference:

```
# ClonableArray
sage: L = IntegerListsLex(50, min_part=1, max_slope=0)
sage: it = iter(L)
sage: %timeit x = it.next()
10000 loops, best of 3: 148 ¬µs per loop

# plain lists
sage: L = IntegerListsLex(50, min_part=1, max_slope=0, element_constructor=list)
sage: it = iter(L)
sage: %timeit x = it.next()
10000 loops, best of 3: 134 ¬µs per loop
```

The overhead comes from the containment test that we do in the ``check``
method:

```
# ClonableArray, with check made trivial
sage: sage: L = IntegerListsLex(50, min_part=1, max_slope=0)
sage: sage: it = iter(L)
sage: sage: %timeit x = it.next()
10000 loops, best of 3: 135 ¬µs per loop
```

I am not sure this containment check is useful. We could just disable
it. What do you think?

For the record: using the parent/element protocol does not necessarily
cause a large overhead; ClonableArray is almost as fast as list
(timings to be of course taken with a grain of salt given how small
values we are speaking about here):

```
sage: sage: L = IntegerListsLex(50, min_part=1, max_slope=0)
sage: l = range(1000)
sage: %timeit x =list(l)
100000 loops, best of 3: 2.4 ¬µs per loop
sage: c = L.element_class
sage: %timeit x = c(L, l)
100000 loops, best of 3: 2.85 ¬µs per loop

sage: %timeit [x[i] for i in range(100)]
100000 loops, best of 3: 6.84 ¬µs per loop
sage: %timeit [l[i] for i in range(100)]
100000 loops, best of 3: 5.61 ¬µs per loop
```


In the long run, when `IntegerListsLex` will be cythonized, the
relative situation may change, since we can hope for speedups of
10-100. Note in particular that we most likely will want to use arrays
of ints internally; `ClonableIntArray` might be a good candidate for
this. Or just STL vectors.

The class is needed because the iterator has an internal state. So we
need to create a separate object for each concurrently running
iterator.

I find that using a nested class `IntegerListsLex._Iter`, rather than
`IntegerListsLexIter` makes the relation between the two classes
explicit (`_Iter` is for internal use for IntegerListsLex`). It's also
consistent with what we do elsewhere (`Element`, ...). And there is no
overhead in doing so.

It does appear in the reference manual: see section `Input list or
iterable for the sum` of the main `IntegerListLex` class.

The feature of iterating by increasing sum is certainly useful.
Whether we want the above syntactic sugar -- instead of just using
DisjointUnionEnumeratedSets -- is indeed questionable. The feature was
already there, so we kept it to not change the API in this ticket.

We discussed this with Jeroen in some earlier comment. Putting it in
the iterator let the user create the `IntegerListsLex` object, even if
it's not finite/iterable. This could be useful for other things than
iteration, like membership testing or building the corresponding
polytopes (once #17920 will be available).

With that, it's natural to cache error-free runs (error runs won't be
cached) to not redo the work in later iterator constructions.

Note that in Python 3 there are arrays of int (as in numpy in Python 2):

   https://docs.python.org/3/library/array.html

But I do not think that `itertools` will use that.

Right. But why is it nested? It will be a mess with Cythonization.

Having two classes in a file called `IntegerListLex` and `IntegerListLexIterator` is rather explicit. I am not sure that following the Parent/Element direction is the best here. As I said before, it would be cool if this file would be Python compatible.

It's trivial to introduce a special case to avoid the copy if the
element constructor is known to be safe. In fact it's done now.

(for the record, the iterator itself does not inherit from Parent).

I would go even further than you: IntegerListsLex uses nothing
specific of Python either. It would be best implemented as a
standalone C++ library. It could then be reused by software outside of
the Python world, be templated by whatever structure we want to use
for the lists, possibly benefit from further low level optimizations
(silk, special processor instructions), etc.

But this discussion belongs to later tickets. Here the goal is to get
a correct algorithm. The next step is to get an algorithm with
reasonably optimal complexity (while further clarifying its
structure). And then should come the rewriting in a low level
language.

Done. Easy to revert if anyone is uncomfortable with this.

At the end, it's all about stylistic preference. It's instantaneous to
change if/when desired. Whoever will work next on this can change to
his own preferred style. I am not discussing this further.

Nested classes are a feature of plain Python, and of many other
programming languages. It turns out that Cython does not support them
now, but I don't see any theoretical obstruction (and it can be easily
emulated).

Altogether I see no compelling reason not to use this feature when it
helps better structure the code.

I don't have an objection if someone takes the responsibility for this
backward incompatible change in a later ticket :-)

Or maybe, if the use case emerges, one should actually go the other
way round: make it syntactically trivial to have variants of
IntegerListsLex, graded by any or both of the length and size
parameters: it's not as generic as DisjointUnionEnumeratedSets, but
this could save on time by sharing quite some stuff between the graded
components (e.g. the parsing of the arguments, the upper and lower
envelopes, ...).

Cheers,

The current output is correct, isn't it? [Infinity] would be the output in inverse lexicographic order, which results in the error message that m is unbounded.

Sorry, I obviously meant

sage: IntegerListsLex(length=2, max_slope=0, min_slope=1).list()

The code in `IntegerListsLex.__init__` could be simplified.

<div id="comment:9" align="right">comment:9</div>

The `global_options` is undocumented and is used only there:

```
if global_options is not None:
    self.global_options = global_options
```

Also (see Jeroen's message) the following line

```
if min_length < 0:
    min_length = 0
```

Can be rewritten as `min_length=max(min_length,0)`.

If this function checks that the constraints give a finite set, could you pick a name for it which reflects it ?

The first lines of `_check_lexicographic_iterable` are `if self._warning or not self._check: return`.

It sounds a bit wrong that the check function would do nothing when explicitly asked to. Instead of stopping early in this situation, could you remove those two lines and only call the function when you mean to?

This would give the function its original meaning: check the data.

Note that the function is only called once.

The function `_possible_m(self, m, j, min_sum, max_sum)` takes four parameters, all of which are attributes of `self`.

```
if self._next_state == LOOKAHEAD:
    m = self._current_list[-1]
    if self._possible_m(m, self._j,
       min_sum - (self._current_sum-m),

Even in this case, I think Sage is currently correct, unless you can define what Infinity-Infinity is (which would be used in the slope conditions).

Because it is really more logical that such a check would happen in the parent before creating the iterator. The iterator should just iterate. The check belongs to the code *creating* the iterator. Also, the `check_finiteness` refers a lot to attributes of the parent, which means that it really belongs there.

Sage is indeed correct that there is an infinite upper bound for `part[0]`. However, my point is that the resulting list is still finite, so this example could work.

> unless you can define what Infinity-Infinity is (which would be used in the slope conditions).

I don't see why I would need to define Infinity - Infinity for this. My point is that the set of lists satisfying those constraints is clearly empty.

For the import of plain Python modules, I don't really see the
point. It's very unlikely that we will save on Sage startup time. On
the other hand, for e.g. `import collections`, we will pay a (small)
penalty each time an `IntegerListsLex` object is created.

Agreed for using `sum(l)` instead of `|l|` as notation.

On the other hand, I found useful to mention all the relevant
parameters on which we will put constraints in the introductory
paragraph, even if they are indeed trivial. Please revert if you agree
with that.

I agree that this should eventually become an argument-less
`look_ahead` method that tests if the current list could possibly be a
prefix of some valid list.

I would like to postpone this change to #18055 however: anyway this
method will need to be rewritten there (in particular to handle an
empty `current_list`), and changing the interface now would require
rewriting most of the current tests of `_possible_m` to construct a
bunch of different IntegerListsLex objects instead of just passing
various arguments. Note also that, as specified in the doc, `min_sum`
and `max_sum` do not exactly match the corresponding attributes: they
are bounds on the tail of the list only (agreed, the difference above
could be done in _possible_m).

Done. Thanks for the for #17920' model.

I ended up not using `integer_or_infinity`: here I prefer to not
accept both `-oo` and `+oo` when only one makes sense, and having two
functions (or one with parameters) seemed like overkill. This is
explicit and simple enough:

```
    self._max_length = ZZ(max_length) if max_length != Infinity else max_length
```

Hello,

> In [comment:322] Jeroen agreed above that 319 was in fact ok.

Many times in the past I had to fix code which accepts a `**kwds`
and did not check that what it contains is actually read. This
lead to silent errors or wrong output, and so I see
things like `global_options` as the highway to bugs.

Jeroen noted that this variable is actually used somewhere else,
so I guess it probably should not be removed in this ticket. My
comment at [comment:319] still need to be adressed, however, as
there is no documentation for this parameter. Please make it
explain the uses of this flag, possibly by pointing to some other
part of the doc if it is already explained somewhere else.

As the method appears in this branch, I see no reason to let it
be corrected in a future ticket.

It's more than that and it can only get worse if more features are added to `Envelope`.

I disagree with this. I think code duplication is always a high risk for bugs.

Anyway, I implemented this in this last commit.

`**kwds` arguments can be painful, I certainly agree.

But fear not, `__init__` takes no kwds. It only accepts a preexisting
global_options object, and assigns it to the attribute
`_global_options`, that's it.

I had not documented it to not advertise it, since we may well get rid
of it. Now there is a documentation that spells exactly what it does.

I think that my explanation above applies anyway. Unless there are checks that everything which is stored in `global_options` makes sense (and that there are exceptions when I do `MyObject(global_options={'whatever':'whatever'}` then `**kwds` and `global_options` are as dangerous as each other.

I set the ticket back to `needs_work` because of the previous comments on `_possible_m(self, m, j, min_sum, max_sum)`.

Hi Jeroen,

I appreciate that you substantiate your point of view with action. I
am not going to waste time debating this for I want this ticket to
move forward. But I still think that the original Envelope was better,
for the reasons I mentionned above. Besides, I had voluntarily used
`==Infinity` in my tests to not set in stone which infinity was
returned.

You are probably right with the correct definition of the slopes.

Replying to [@jdemeyer](#comment:357):
> Why is there duplication of `Envelope` and `_upper_envelope`?

The role of `_upper_envelope` is to slightly tweak the global ceiling
(an existing already smoothed `Envelope` object) to take into account
the additional local constraint that the current value at position `j`
is `m`.  Similarly for `_lower_envelope`.

So the two features are similar in the nature of their goal, but
differ in what they actually need to do to achieve it. So merging them
is unlikely to save any duplication while likely to add complexity.

On the other hand, I agree it would be nice to better clarify this
distinction between the two features in the method names. Suggestions
welcome.

We have been working hard to make the deadline for
the release. Like in any piece of code, there certainly are other
internal micro-refactoring that could possibly be done. If you note
one, please be specific on whether you believe it really needs to be
done now, or could be postponed to one of the follow up tickets;
especially since some of those tickets may well induce complete
rewrite of the ditto micro-refactored code anyway.

Have you had the impression that some of our previous requests were abusive? We try to understand your code, make sure that it is correct maintenable and thus that it will be easy to understand and work on it in the future.

Many of the things that seem obvious to the author are not easily deduced when you only look at the code, and unexpected design choices often raise more questions.

I personally gave up raising some arguments (that still seem legitimate to me) only to lessen the load on this ticket. I still plan to read the code you implement totally (I haven't done that yet), and I will probably have more time to do so next week.

Abusive, no: they all had to be handled at some point or the
other. Urgent: I did wonder for some of them; I agree that we
absolutely want the code to be correct (at least to the best of our
knowledge) for this rc. And this of course requires a complete
understanding of it by the reviewers, and clarification of the design
choices. But maybe for some of the issues it's sufficient, once things
are clarified, to leave a note in upcoming tickets for the next step
that need to be done.

The big thing is that I have the impression to be holding off the
upcoming rc, and that's rather uncomfortable. Also having a stable
base here would allow me to move on to the following tasks, in
particular working of the merge and review of #17920, as well as your
ticket about IntegerVectors. And also would allow me or others to work
on to the follow up tickets.

I appreciate this! Please add these comments to the followup tickets
(or some new one if appropriate), for I want to hear about them.

> I still plan to read the code you implement totally (I haven't done that yet), and I will probably have more time to do so next week.

Great, thanks!

From the many discussions with you, Jeroen, Bryan, and Anne and
myself, it seems that the code has been scrutinized quite some.  As
Jeroen pointed out, there are still cases that could be handled in
theory, and that the code rejects at this point. But outside of those
situations, I pretty much trust that the code gives correct result.
Which achieves the original goal of this ticket.

Cheers,
                             Nicolas

Annoying indeed. The fine point is in the heuristic to decide how deep
we want to lookahead to find a lower bound on the total floor area. In
a case like this we could potentially compute how deep to go until the
floor would reach its limit of zero.

I would tend to postpone that: there is no risk of wrong answer, the
existence of false negatives is now documented in
`_check_finiteness` (using the above examples), and the user can set
`check=False` to workaround the limitation.

What do you think?

Regarding Jeroen's [comment:395](#comment:395), I think this could possibly be fixed by adjusting ._floor.limit_start() after the smoothing procedure. Note that

```
sage: C=IntegerListsLex(7, floor=[4,0], max_part=4, min_slope=-1)
sage: C.list()
[[4, 3]]
```
also works fine. The reason is that

```
sage: C._floor.limit_start()
2
```
so that 

```
floor_sum_lower_bound = sum(self._floor(i) for i in range(self._floor.limit_start()))
```
in line 1076 computes a high enough bound that is caught in line 1082. However, in

```
sage: C=IntegerListsLex(7, floor=[4], max_part=4, min_slope=-1)
sage: C._floor.limit_start()
1
```
even though

```
sage: for i in range(5):

Agreed: we could imagine, in the constructor of Envelope and when a
list is given as input, to set `limit_start` not to the end of the
list, but to the point where the limit is actually reached after
smoothing. It should be just a couple lines.

Potential downside: if the parts in the list are very high, this may
induce a similarly high limit start, which will trigger more
calculations elsewhere. Probably not a common use case, so we might
not care.

The other thing is that I could well imagine that, once the new
lookahead is implemented in #18055, the finiteness checking -- or at
least the partial lookahead we are doing in `_check_finiteness` --
would become a side product; so might not be worth having something
temporary.

So, reviewers: let us know if this should be done right now.

Cheers,

Hello,

This is what I did during the last 3~4 hours. I stopped before the end and did
not review `m_interval`, `_lookahead` nor the code of `Envelope`, as I really
should be working on mathematics instead of Sage `T_T`

Some are easy, some are harder. Also, let me write somewhere that I am against
keeping `integer_list_old` in Sage, as I am afraid that it will still be here
several years from now. Here are my comments:

- Module documentation -- in the 'itemize' section listing `IntegerListsLex` and
  `Envelope`, could you add a short description of what they are meant for?

- Why a 'history' section?

- Documentation of `IntegerListsLex`: instead of stating the *purpose* of the
  class (which is more something one would explain on a trac ticket), what about
  a SEEALSO section? I have the following paragraph in mind:

  ```
  The main purpose is to provide a generic iteration engine for all
  the enumerated sets like :class:`Partitions`,
  class:`Compositions`, :class:`IntegerVectors`. It can also be
  used to generate many other combinatorial objects like Dyck paths,
  Motzkin paths, etc.
  ```
  I thought that it would make more sense as a SEEALSO section pointing toward
  the mentionned objects.

- About this paragraph:

  ```
  The set of allowable constraints has been specifically designed to enable
  iteration with a good time and memory complexity in most practical use cases,
  and in inverse lexicographic order (see below)
  ```

  I do not believe that it is true, i.e. that the set of allowable contraints
  has been specifically designed to enable iteration with a good time and memory
  complexity.

  In particular, it is possible to get great speed improvements by writing a
  Constant Amortized Algorithm to list only partitions satisfying a smaller set
  of constraints like (sum,length,min/max part).

  This statement sounds wrong to me, and so I believe that it should be removed.

- Documentation of the parameter `n` -- you say that a list of integers can be
  provided but do not explain what the output will be.

- Are `min_sum` and `max_sum` also ignored when `n` is a list? From the doc it
  seems to be, though I am not sure that it is the best design choice in this
  case.

- I was surprised by the following output:

  ```
  sage: IntegerListsLex(3,max_length=3,floor=[1,1,1]).list()
  [[3], [2, 1], [1, 2], [1, 1, 1]]
  ```
  I woud have expected the length of the lists to be at least 3, as I requested
  the first three parts to be `>=1`. The documentation is consistent, but I
  still find it surprising.

- ``check`` seems misnamed. It is not about checking the input or output, only
  about displaying warnings. What about `disable_warnings` instead?

- In the following text which says that one can force the enumeration when it is
  formally impossible, can you explicitly say what will happen? "All possible
  lists are enumerated, but the ordering is incorrect" or something?
  `If one wants to proceed anyway, one can sign a waiver by setting check=False:`

- About the finiteness check: what about a specific `allow_infinite_iterator`
  independent from the current 'check'.

- Building the doc of `integer_list.py` with `--warn-links` fails.

- `sage: list(IntegerListsLex(3, max_length=2, ))`

- Lexicographic ordering is broken when `n` is a list.

  ```
  sage: print IntegerListsLex([1,2],length=3).list()
  [[1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1], [2, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1], [0, 2, 0], [0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 2]]
  ```

  In particular, the output differs depending on how `n` is sorted.

- Cardinality is broken when `n` is a list

  ```
  sage: IntegerListsLex(3,length=3).cardinality()
  10
  sage: IntegerListsLex([3,3],length=3).cardinality()
  20
  ```

- `return typecall(cls, n=n, **kwargs)` -- for clarity I find the normal
  syntax better. This place is not a critical part for speed, especially when
  you create `DisjointUnionEnumeratedSets` with lambda functions just above.

- I had not noticed that `IntegerListsLex` objects could have a 'name'
  argument.. As all arguments, it must be documented in the INPUT section.

- Same for `element_constructor` and `element_class`.

- `self._max_length = ZZ(max_length) if max_length != Infinity else max_length`
  Just my two cents: I would return 'Infinity' instead of max_length. You
  defined your `Infinity` in order to be fast, and you don't know what
  `max_length` may be. This occurs several times.

- You can save space and turn the two following tests into one (using the same
  'all'). Occurs twice.

  ```
  if not all(i in ZZ for i in floor):
      raise TypeError("the parts of floor={} should be nonnegative integers".format(floor))
  if not all(i >= 0 for i in floor):
      raise NotImplementedError("negative parts in floor={}".format(floor))
  ```
  This would also solve the following, which tests `ceiling` but mentions
  `floor`

  ```
  if not all(i >= 0 for i in ceiling):
      raise NotImplementedError("negative parts in floor={}".format(ceiling))
  ```

- `# constructor is known to be safe and don't claim ownership on` -- "does
  not".

- Typing `IntegerListsLex.<tab>` in the console is very entertaining. I would be
  very glad if we some day decide to consider this as a bug.

- about `check_finiteness` -> what about `guess_finiteness` instead, to
  emphasize that the function makes mistakes?

- The error message when the set is infinite is misleading:

  ```
  sage: L = IntegerListsLex(4)
  sage: L._check_finiteness()
  ...
  ValueError: Could not check that the specified constraints yield a finite set
  ```
  The code was able to perform the check, though it was not "able to decide that
  the set is finite".

- I do not understand this comment:
  `If a part has no bound on its value, it will be detected at some point`
  Do you mean that "at some point in __iter__" it will be detected? Probably
  not, as this function is called only once.

- The function `_check_finiteness` assumes that the alphabet size is bounded. It
  is always true when this function is called, but the following raises no
  warning:

  ```
  sage: for x in IntegerListsLex(NonNegativeIntegers(),max_length=3):
  ....:     pass
  ```
  For the reason given earlier, the output is not sorted lexicographically. It
  is not detected as infinite either.

- The many `if A: return` from `_check_finiteness` can be replaced by a `if A or
  B or C or ...: return`.

- in `_check_finiteness`: the documentation of `limit()` says that it is only an
  upper bound. Thus you cannot write the following:

  ```
  if self._ceiling.limit() < self._floor.limit():
      return
  ```

- Same comment here

  ```
  if self._floor.limit() > 0 or self._min_slope > 0:
     floor_sum_lower_bound = Infinity
  ```

- Also, it seems that `limit_start()` can be `Infinity`, in which case one
  cannot deduce anything from the value of `limit`. Please add checks.

- I stop reviewing `_check_finiteness`, as it is complicated while the situation
  of `limit()` is not cleared.

- `Which specific bound is returned is not set in stone`. Be more accurate.

Nathann

Agreed.

What should be done to make it less surprising? It is completely consistent with `min_part=1`.

I asked for this argument to be called `check`. Usually, it's exceptions which are controlled by a `check` argument, but I don't see why this cannot be warnings instead.

Agreed, see also `integer_or_infinity` from #17920.

>   Do you mean that "at some point in __iter__" it will be detected? Probably

Agreed that this is confusing. This comment should really be moved to and explained the docstring.

>   B or C or ...: return`.

That's just a matter of style. The many `if A: return` might be more clear to read...

Hi,

I'll answer in several chunks, since I am not sure if I can take care
of all before taking off.

Replying to [@nathanncohen](#comment:412):
> - Module documentation -- in the 'itemize' section listing `IntegerListsLex` and
>   `Envelope`, could you add a short description of what they are meant for?

Done. This is quite redundant, so I was not sure what to put. Feel
free to edit to your taste.

> - Why a 'history' section?

Quite often the history is unnecessary because all the information is
in the git history. But here the history spans other software and is
harder to follow since the previous file was moved. This also gives
credit/blame record, and some sort of bibliography since there is no
published description of the algorithm (at least not yet).

> - `self._max_length = ZZ(max_length) if max_length != Infinity else max_length`
>   Just my two cents: I would return 'Infinity' instead of max_length. You
>   defined your `Infinity` in order to be fast, and you don't know what

Good point; I had hesitated but this is better. Fixed.

> - You can save space and turn the two following tests into one (using the same
>   'all'). Occurs twice.
> 
>   ```
>   if not all(i in ZZ for i in floor):
>       raise TypeError("the parts of floor={} should be nonnegative integers".format(floor))
>   if not all(i >= 0 for i in floor):
>       raise NotImplementedError("negative parts in floor={}".format(floor))
>   ```
>   This would also solve the following, which tests `ceiling` but mentions

>

>   ```

Jeroen asked for a different error message (`TypeError`
w.r.t. `NotImplementedError`), and I agree with him; so I did not
change this. But I fixed the floor to ceiling in the error
message. Note btw that the `TypeError` is now done through a
conversion to a tuple of ZZ.

We definitely should keep it around for benchmarking purposes at least
until #18055 is finished. I am fine adding the removal of
`integer_list_old` to the todo list for this ticket.

A user reading this documentation is likely to know about integer
partitions, compositions or such. Mentioning them early on gives
immediately an idea of the range of applications, and thus a better
understanding of the upcoming description of the specific input.  So I
would want this text to come before the long description of the input.
I am fine making it into a SEEALSO if that's ok to put one before
INPUT.

Also it's also a useful piece of information for users, even more for
developers, to better understand the architecture, and know when to
use this class or another one.  Such information really belongs to the
documentation, not trac.

I do not see the point. You can checkout Sage 6.5 whenever you like if you ever need to benchmark this old (and broken) code.

You cannot make assumptions like that. A user might find this class because he was redirected there after reading the doc of `IntegerVectors` (for instance).

Works for me.

As Jeroen mentioned, floor just requires that if there is a part, then it satisfies the
constraint. If no part is present, that is ok. If you want at least three parts, you need
to specify min_length.

Jeroen had asked us to change this. So please first agree among yourself before asking
to change this again.

When a function for the floor or ceiling is given, it is impossible to check that
the conditions give a finite set since the list of values is in principle infinite.
In this case the algorithm can either hang (as it computes more and more parts of the
integer list) or it can happen that a tail of 000100000.... will appear in which case
nor all elements in the list will be iterated over.

Fixed.

Can you make this explicit in the doc?

It does not address the problem that output is not sorted as it should.

The following is weird behavior that needs to be fixed!!

```
sage: IntegerListsLex([2,2],length=2).list()
[[2, 0], [1, 1], [0, 2], [2, 0], [1, 1], [0, 2]]
sage: IntegerListsLex([2,2],length=3).list()
[[2, 0], [1, 1], [0, 2], [2, 0], [1, 1], [0, 2]]
```

The answer should really be

```
sage: IntegerListsLex([2,2],length=3).list()
[[2, 0, 0],
 [1, 1, 0],
 [1, 0, 1],
 [0, 2, 0],
 [0, 1, 1],
 [0, 0, 2],
 [2, 0, 0],
 [1, 1, 0],
 [1, 0, 1],
 [0, 2, 0],
 [0, 1, 1],
 [0, 0, 2]]
```

It will be detected during the algorithm that builds up the integer vector successively.
The algorithm tries to add each part and if at some point the bound on a part is 
infinite, then it will raise an error.

`_check_finiteness` only tests this for each piece in the DisjointEnumeratedSet 
(when a list is given for `n`) and checks that each piece is a finite set.

Indeed, and this is in fact a feature. I reworked the documentation to
better highlight this.

I documented this behavior some more. That's part of the
specifications that this returns a disjoint union. A different
specification might look desirable, but there would be no efficient
way to handle it.

I am not sure what you mean by "normal syntax". That you prefer using
DisjointUnionEnumeratedSets directly rather than this syntactic sugar?

Indeed they are ignored. I don't see a simple way to implement it
otherwise.


Speaking of which: should there be a warning when a user-specified
value for `min_sum` or `max_sum` is overridden by `n`? Same for
`length` versus `min_length` and `max_length`.

I agree it can be surprising at first sight, but the other way round
would have prevented interesting use cases. Not that some of the
specialized classes, like partitions or integer vectors, take a
separate argument inner and outer which does impose length
restrictions, according to the usual math vocable in those contexts.

I also wondered, but see the discussion with Jeroen: let's keep things
simple until we actually meet a serious use case.

Done.

Agreed: about one half of the items should not be there. But that's a
different discussion.

Done.

Good point. At the end of the day, I made it into "could not prove
that the set is finite" which better highlights the lack of symmetry.

I rewrote the documentation of `_check_finiteness` to be more specific
and discuss this point.

> - about `check_finiteness` -> what about `guess_finiteness` instead, to
>   emphasize that the function makes mistakes?

I see your point; however `guess` improperly suggests that it's going
to return a boolean, whereas `check` conveys that it's about trying to
catch and report bad situations.

Another issue with this name, which is even more apparent with the
rewrite of the documentation, is that this method is really about
trying to prove the existence of a bound on the length.

Oh well, I believe it's good enough for now; it's a private method
with an extensive documentation giving a precise specification; if
someone comes up with a perfect name, it's a trivial change.  Besides
`check` conveys that the verification needs not be comprehensive.

Correct, which is fine: the above example is properly iterable, and
it's nowhere claimed to be finite:

```
sage: C = IntegerListsLex(NonNegativeIntegers(),max_length=3)
sage: C in EnumeratedSets().Finite()
False
```

In general, it's documented that `n=iterable` is nothing but a
convenience, and that it does not return an `IntegerListsLex` object
but a disjoint union thereof. I would not want to pollute the
documentation everywhere with straightforward consequences.

As Jeroen says, that's a matter of style. Here I like that it
highlights the fact that each test is independent.  So the reader can
think about just one at a time.

Jeroen's fault! (Just kidding :-) )

That's actually correct: for the floor, `limit` in fact returns a
lower bound. I reinstated the documentation and tests for this as they
had gotten scrambled in the sign-refactoring of Envelope.

> - Also, it seems that `limit_start()` can be `Infinity`, in which case one

Ah yes, the specifications of `limit` / `limit_start` were not
explicit in this case. Fixed. With those specs, the deduction is
actually correct.

Hopefully it's cleared now!

I tried to make the sentence clearer.

More tomorrow. Off to bed now!

Hello Nicolas,

I reported the following problems:

- From the doumentation: infinite set, no warning:

  ```
  sage: for x in IntegerListsLex(NonNegativeIntegers(),length=1):
  ....:     pass
  ```

- Non ordered output:

  ```
  sage: IntegerListsLex([1,2],length=3).list()
  [[1, 0, 0],
   [0, 1, 0],
   [0, 0, 1],
   [2, 0, 0],
   [1, 1, 0],
   [1, 0, 1],
   [0, 2, 0],
   [0, 1, 1],
   [0, 0, 2]]
  ```

> Indeed, and this is in fact a feature. I reworked the documentation to better
> highlight this.

I consider this example to break what the class promises (by being called
`IntegerListsLex`): its output is not sorted lexicograpically.

Now, I agree that this is hard to fix inside of the class. Thus instead of
claiming that it is not a bug by adding a line of documentation (which is why
you are rewriting the class today) please consider deprecating it. Updating the
code that calls it should not be a problem, as it can call
`DisjointUnionEnumeratedSets` directly.

I completely agree with you in principle. However, I would be against adding even more changes to other parts of Sage.

As far as I can tell, within the Sage library, `IntegerListsLex` is only called in the following ways:
1. with `n` a single number -> this is good
2. with `range(a,b)` -> this can easily be changed to use `min_sum` and `max_sum`
3. with `NN` -> keep this for now

For now, I agree with deprecating lists or iterables. I would keep support for `NN` and deal with that on a follow-up ticket.

I would have changed the calls to make them use `DisjointUnionEnumeratedSet` directly, but if you think that this deserves a function then no proble.

I noticed something wrong in the words file, and created ticket #18148 to address it.

Yes, and wait for the recompilation. Or keep yet another copy of Sage
around just for this. It also makes it more complicated to compare
outputs. Really, there is no risks associated to keeping it around for
a bit more time, and *not* keeping it is just another useless hurdle
in the way of those who will be working on #18055.

I am making no assumption. The user does not *need* to know about
integer partitions. But if he does, he gets an additional hint.

I believe deciding on API changes like this is going beyond the scope
of this ticket; we are taking decisions in a rush on things that are
debatable (see the discussion with Vincent). But oh well, let's move
on. Thanks Jeroen for taking action toward some state that is
acceptable to everyone.

> I would have changed the calls to make them use `DisjointUnionEnumeratedSet` directly, but if you think that this deserves a function then no proble.

I really would much prefer a direct use of DisjointUnionEnumeratedSet,
in particular to set an example for others that would need a similar
feature.

Also, I spent a good deal of time working on documentation and tests
that were just wiped out by this commit. The right thing to do is to
recycle them whenever this can be useful, and at the very least adapt
the tests. I'll work on this now.

Cheers,

PS: It's Pycon today; I'll see what I can do to handle the remaining
comments by Nathann. In the mean time, it would be helpful if we could

I started doing this, and then realized that the two locations where
we are using `IntegerListsNN` would be best written using
`IntegerVectors(length=..., ...)`. However this feature is broken (see
#17927). So I switch gear: let's keep things are they are for now,
switch to `IntegerVectors` in the upcoming #17927, and probably get rid of the
temporary `IntegerListsNN` then.

I left TODO notes in the code.

It's mentioned just above:

<code>the list \`\`[1, 1, 1]\`\` will never appear in the enumeration</code>

Isn't this enough?

Btw: I just made minor improvements to the doc around there.

Well, this certainly was our design goal when we came up with it with
Florent! I am not saying iteration with a good time and complexity is
currently implemented, but I do believe this is possible in most
practical use cases.

Anyway, just rephrase this to whatever you wish. I don't really care. Or
more precisely I care more about this ticket being done.

>  In particular, it is possible to get great speed improvements by
>  writing a Constant Amortized Time (CAT) Algorithm to list only

If you take the current algorithm, specialize the lookahead to be
trivial (because, for plain partitions, the prediction is indeed
trivial: any prefix can be extended to at least one integer
partition), and avoid a copy of the result, you recover exactly the
standard CAT algorithm for enumerating integer partitions in inverse
lexicographic order.

In fact that's exactly how we came up with this design: by getting
tired of reimplementing exactly the same CAT algorithm for integer
partitions, compositions, and looking for some unifying context.

More precisely we are shooting for LAT (Linear Amortized Time): the
iterator protocol is indeed not really favorable to pure CAT: if one
yields a reference to the current list at each step, things are likely
to break, unless the user makes an immediate read only use of it. So
for now we assume that we make a copy of each list.

I am not claiming we can always achieve LAT. But I believe that we can
get pretty close to it in the common use cases, which will qualify for
"good time and memory complexity".

Hello,

> Up to the aforementioned sentence that I let Nathann edit to his taste

I just did that. I added ten words to the sentence which mentions the argument 'check', and removed the part of the doc about the design of that class.

My idea of what an efficient implementation of this feature should be is closer to chapter 16 of the fxtbook [1].

In a previous message you mentionned #17927. Would anybody be willing to review it? It has been lying there for 4 weeks, and is now in conflict with the commits that have been added here since.

I just check the changes and am ok with me (I am keeping a mental note
to reinsert the statement about the design when we will have provable
arguments)

Where do we stand now? Are there things left that remain to review?

> My idea of what an efficient implementation of this feature should be is closer to chapter 16 of the fxtbook [1].

Juste a note: the code for next in 16.2 is precisely how next worked
in the previous implementation of IntegerListsLex (except that we had
more checks to handle the extra arguments).

Altogether, I don't think we are far from ftxbook. The only thing is
that there remains to make sure that our code does specialize well in
the trivial cases like plain partitions. And of course to make it into
compiled code. Once we will be there, we should certainly compare to
the ftxbook benchmarks.

of #17927, when this one will be done.

The asymptotic complexity is not the only thing I had in mind when I pointed toward that book. For things as easy to enumerate as integer partitions (wiht min/max n, min/max part, min/max length) I believe that we should have Cython implementation (no Python needed). When called at C level, it would be infinitely faster to enumerate and filter permutations satisfying a given predicate. It also couldn't hurt if `IntegerListsLex` relied on it in thos simple cases.

In summary, the plan is:

- Correct implementation of IntegerListsLex (this ticket)
- Asymptotically good implementation (#18055)
- Cython/C/C++ implementation (#18056)
- Serious benchmarking to see whether it's worth having specialized
  implementations for the "trivial" cases, and use "filtering from
  trivial" for the small cases.

Cheers,
                        Nicolas

I'm going to set this to positive review since it seems like there are currently no objections to the current state of the code, it is a definite improvement over the previous code, and we can always do more work later on on followup tickets (thus we can get the next version of Sage released).

IntegerListsLex is not really using it. Just passing it on for other
classes that need it. But if there is a way to refactor those classes
to not impose this burden on IntegerListsLex, that would be better
indeed.

> - Remove `integer_list_old.py`

Yes, at the end of #18055.

> - Get rid of `element_constructor`

We probably want to change the default value. But we certainly want to
keep the feature.
