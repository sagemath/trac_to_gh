Various things in 2d animations need refactoring
* The `show_path` optional argument should be removed everywhere, and meaningful return values should be implemented
* (Lack of) return values sometimes contradicts documentation, e.g. in `Animation.apng()`
* Functions that save should have a mandatory (positional) filename as argument
* There should be a keyword argument to switch between different output types in `show()`, similar to `viewer='jmol'` in 3d graphics. 
* Make up your mind on whether `Animate._frames` is 2d graphics or input to `plot()`

> * The `show_path` optional argument should be removed everywhere, and meaningful return values should be implemented

I had, at some point in the past, myself proposed to return path names from all the file creation functions. That's #16573 which I wrote at a time when animations were even more severely broken. Since noone seemed to care about it, and I was mostly happy again once notebook worked all right again, I left it at that.

> * (Lack of) return values sometimes contradicts documentation, e.g. in `Animation.apng()`

The APNG inconsistency is in a certain sense a consequence of that: back in #16533 I had code which got refactored to #16573 about returning paths and to #16571 for APNG support. The latter went forward, the former was left to rot, and I didn't adjust the docs properly. Sorry there.

> * Functions that save should have a mandatory (positional) filename as argument

Mandatory positional file name arguments would break backwards compatibility. At the moment, it is perfectly all right for a notebook user to write `a.gif()` resp. `a.ffmpeg()` in order to view an animation `a` in a given format. The documentation seems to encourage that behavior. So if we follow the [deprecation guideline](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/coding_in_python.html#deprecation), we have to first spit out warnings for a year before we really make this mandatory. The `gif` method has a different order of arguments at the moment, so a positional argument there would already have a different meaning. We would have to make positional use of `delay` deprecated, either at the same time (using the type of the argument to distinguish between backward-compatible delay and forward-compatible file name) or sequentially. If we'd do it sequentially, i.e. first deprecate the `delay` (in my opinion preferrably using #16607) and then deprecate the lack of a file name, then it would take two years. Or you are of the opinion that animations are so generally broken that you don't care about graceful deprecation, and have to convince some other devs to agree to that view. I wouldn't feel comfortable giving a positive review to such a change.

> * There should be a keyword argument to switch between different output types in `show()`, similar to `viewer='jmol'` in 3d graphics. 

#7298 introduced a keyword argument for `show` which I called `format`. I suggest we continue discussion of format switching in that ticket.

> * Make up your mind on whether `Animate._frames` is 2d graphics or input to `plot()`

I had the impression that one should be able to provide plot input as an argument to `animate` for the sake of simplicity, and that one should be able to provide a generator instead of a list for the sake of memory efficiency. So having `_frames` contain either of these, or even a mixture, seems hard to avoid at the moment. That said, there obviously should be no exceptions due to such mixtures. I'd say we introduce a method which returns an iterator over graphics objects, moving the logic from the `png` method into that.

I feel I could write a branch for the APNG documentation and the `_frames` handling which would be ready for inclusion very soon. If I include the `show_path` issue, I could deal with all of that in a new branch for #16573. The mandatory positional file name argument issue needs some discussion first, I think. Do you want this ticket here focused on that issue, or do you want to open a new one exclusively about that and close this here as duplicate of all of these others?

Fixing bugs breaks backward compatibilty if you really want the bug. But that is besides the point. Silently creating files is a terrible UI and will not work with anything but SageNB. The gui isn't only SageNB any more, so everything that can't work with IPython notebook (say) is by definition a bug. You don't need to deprecate bugs for a year until you finally fix that bug.
