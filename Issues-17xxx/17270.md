<a id='comment:2'></a>Hello !

Well, you do not do much harm with your pep8 patches but honestly a large part of it is just intolerance.. Like replacing `p[i-1]` with `p[i - 1]` `:-P`

Also, I personally prefer 

```
if <condition>:
   return <thing>
else:
    return <another thing>
```
to 

```
if <condition>
   return <thing>
return <another thing>
```

And it would be cool to respect other people's writing style sooo... Well, write code however you like, but please don't change the code only because it is not your style.
