Running `./sage --preparse` on a `.sage` produces a `.py` file such that this is a proper Python file. If the .sage file contains a module docstring, then this should be present as the module docstring of the resulting .py file. This means that no code-lines (non-comment, non-blank) may be added before this module docstring.

There are no doc-tests for this (and incidentally, also no doc-tests that `sage --preparse` respects the encoding line), and the way `sage-preparse` is currently written is quite fragile with respect to changes in called code (in `sage.misc.preparser`).

Keywords: **docstring, preparse**

Since the patch is on a python file outside the usual Sage tree, I am not aware of doc-test rules etc. I wouldn't even know how to make a doctest for this (and there are no other doctests in sage-preparse).

There are doctest (even for `sage-preparse`) in `src/sage/tests/cmdline.py` and I think you should add a doctest for this (needs_work because of this).

I tried to do the rebase, but the instructions in the documentation were not clear to me on this use-case. Did I do it right?

I don't know what you mean with "removed support for `coding`".

I added a new doctest instead of making the old one bigger because I didn't want the old one to be too large and confusing (as it is, it is hard to read). In the new doc-test is an `import inspect` and a strange line printing out the doc string.

grep `src/bin/sage-preparse` for `coding` and you will see what I mean.

Good catch with the coding line. I reinstated it, and added it to the doctest.

I also simplified the doctest and simply examine the produced file directly instead of doing strange reflection stuff.

I didn't say the changes were bad, in fact I do think they make sense. I only said that I could not check whether they solved the problem mentioned in this ticket.

<a id='comment:25'>Comment 25:</a>
I'm sorry but I'm completely lost in these branches. I'm working on branch t/17019/ticket/17019 but if I try to push with **git push trac t/17019/ticket/17019**, I get the following error

```
Total 0 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)

error: failed to push some refs to 'git@trac.sagemath.org:sage.git'
```

If I try to push with **git trac push**, it works fine but pushes to **u/jsrn/ticket/17019**, which doesn't seem to put my code into this ticket (but it does add the message "Branch changed from bla-bla-bla" which appears twice above).

What do I do?
