```
Running `./sage --preparse` on a `.sage` produces a `.py` file such that this is a proper Python file. If the .sage file contains a module docstring, then this should be present as the module docstring of the resulting .py file. This means that no code-lines (non-comment, non-blank) may be added before this module docstring.

There are no doc-tests for this (and incidentally, also no doc-tests that `sage --preparse` respects the encoding line), and the way `sage-preparse` is currently written is quite fragile with respect to changes in called code (in `sage.misc.preparser`).

Keywords: docstring, preparse

There are doctest (even for `sage-preparse`) in `src/sage/tests/cmdline.py` and I think you should add a doctest for this (needs_work because of this).

<a id='comment:25'></a>I'm sorry but I'm completely lost in these branches. I'm working on branch t/17019/ticket/17019 but if I try to push with **git push trac t/17019/ticket/17019**, I get the following error

```
Total 0 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)

error: failed to push some refs to 'git@trac.sagemath.org:sage.git'
```

If I try to push with **git trac push**, it works fine but pushes to **u/jsrn/ticket/17019**, which doesn't seem to put my code into this ticket (but it does add the message "Branch changed from bla-bla-bla" which appears twice above).

What do I do?

At least, I've just tested that the doctest in this ticket fails if it's tested on the current beta, and that this patch fixes it.
