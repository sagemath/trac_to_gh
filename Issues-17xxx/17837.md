        if not (isinstance(b, Matrix_modn_dense_float) or

you might have used

which is handled in the exact same way by cython.

I will try to use the nice unpickle_override for #17824.

Because there is a large amount of work on ticket #10734 that uses `matrix_modn_dense`. Before throwing away this work, it would have been nice to wait for the current status of this work. I am pretty sure that everything can be achieved with the LinBox classes anyway.

But *with* or *without* #17837, `matrix_modn_dense` is deprecated and no longer used. So if #10734 really uses `Matrix_modn_dense`, it should be changed anyway.
