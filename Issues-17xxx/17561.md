We should declare the types `_entries` in `free_module_element.pxd`. This leads to a significant speed-up in the sparse case, and a minor speedup in the dense case:

Before:

```
sage: v = vector(RR, range(10000)); timeit('v._add_(v)', repeat=10, number=1000)
1000 loops, best of 10: 1.85 ms per loop
sage: v = vector(RR, range(10000), sparse=True); timeit('v._add_(v)', repeat=10, number=1000)
1000 loops, best of 10: 3.49 ms per loop
```

After:

```
sage: v = vector(RR, range(10000)); timeit('v._add_(v)', repeat=10, number=1000)
1000 loops, best of 10: 1.82 ms per loop
sage: v = vector(RR, range(10000), sparse=True); timeit('v._add_(v)', repeat=10, number=1000)
1000 loops, best of 10: 2.85 ms per loop
```
