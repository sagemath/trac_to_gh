Using strace I can see access to some `preview.png` and looking at that file I notice that it appears to be a regular PNG, concatenated with a Jmol script. So apparently two outputs ended up in the same data stream. This is likely a consequence of #17234.

Works for me. Can you post your strace output? Can PIL open a PNG at all on your system?

It seems I was misled: apparently JMol attaching its script to the generated PNG is normal behavior. The PNG file is apparently broken at some other point. Looking at the PNG chunks as reported by the `pngchunks` tool, I see that the `IDAT` chunk appears to be off by one byte. The chunk before that is an `iTXt` chunk stating the creation date. It does so in a locale-dependent manner, and in my case that means using the German abbreviation for March, which is `MÃ¤r`. So I'd say JMol is counting UTF-16 code units when it should be counting UTF-8 code units. This is a bug in JMol, and probably can be reproduced at least this month by using a German locale.

I'll try to see whether we can work around this issue by forcing the locale to C, like `LC_ALL=C` or some Java-specific analogon to this.
