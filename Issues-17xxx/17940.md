With Sage 6.6 beta 3 and using Sage Notebook I get a backtrace when I want to see a sphere:

```

Using strace I can see access to some `preview.png` and looking at that file I notice that it appears to be a regular PNG, concatenated with a Jmol script. So apparently two outputs ended up in the same data stream. This is likely a consequence of #17234.
