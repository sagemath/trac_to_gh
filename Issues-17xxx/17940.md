Using strace I can see access to some `preview.png` and looking at that file I notice that it appears to be a regular PNG, concatenated with a Jmol script. So apparently two outputs ended up in the same data stream. This is likely a consequence of #17234.

Works for me. Can you post your strace output? Can PIL open a PNG at all on your system?
