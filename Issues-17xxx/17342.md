I notice some of the matroid extensions got gmp as extra library. How do I determine that this is necessary? The code runs fine on my computer with and without gmp, I think. Without a way to tell, I'll get it wrong on future extensions.

I'd say:
* either look in the source code for gmp function (here it is typically mpn_popcnt or mpn_copyi),
* or run `ldd | grep U` on the built object files and look for symbols with gmp in it,
* or try to compile it under a cery touchy platform as Cygwin :)
