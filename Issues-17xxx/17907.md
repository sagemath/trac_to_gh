I've made a start here. I fixed the exponent on the bound. I added a precision parameter and the warning to the appropriate functions. I also upped the precision for the failed example, but since I can't reproduce, I can't be sure that will fix it.

I guess I'll mark this as needs-review, although I'm not 100% sure I've resolved it. I won't be able to work on this for a few days if someone wants to take over in the meantime.

Of course it would be nice to pick the right precision automatically ...

Yes, there is a TODO in the enumeration of points of bounded height in number fields (from #15389) to address the precision sensitivity.

Just seen (with Sage 6.6) on Linux x86_64 (Haswell-E CPU), FSF GCC 4.9.2 (but not e.g. 4.4.3); patch fixes the doctest failure.
