In particular, the expected output in this example contains points with relative height at most 5. For example, the point (2 : 2 : 1) doesn't appear in the expected output, though it certainly has height (relative and absolute) less than 125.\n\nThis doesn't address the discrepancy in the two lists, though, at least not entirely. The issue must be related to the floating point arithmetic being used for elements_of_bounded_height. The four points appearing in the \"expected\" list and not the \"for\" list have relative height exactly equal to 5, which is the bound that is being passed to the elements_of_bounded_height function. I seem to remember something like this happening when we were testing elements_of_bounded_height, where sometimes points of exact height B would appear in the output, and occasionally they would not, depending on the machine.\n\nOne last comment: Because of the floating point arithmetic involved, the output of elements_of_bounded_height cannot be guaranteed correct (as per the warning in the documentation).

I've made a start here. I fixed the exponent on the bound. I added a precision parameter and the warning to the appropriate functions. I also upped the precision for the failed example, but since I can't reproduce, I can't be sure that will fix it.

I guess I'll mark this as needs-review, although I'm not 100% sure I've resolved it. I won't be able to work on this for a few days if someone wants to take over in the meantime.

Yes, there is a TODO in the enumeration of points of bounded height in number fields (from #15389) to address the precision sensitivity.

> `enum_projective_number_field` (#17386) is missing points on OSX 10.6.8, possibly other platforms.

Just seen (with Sage 6.6) on Linux x86_64 (Haswell-E CPU), FSF GCC 4.9.2 (but not e.g. 4.4.3); patch fixes the doctest failure.
