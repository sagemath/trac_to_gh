For example, the point (2 : 2 : 1) doesn't appear in the expected output, though it certainly has height (relative and absolute) less than 125.\n\nThis doesn't address the discrepancy in the two lists, though, at least not entirely. The issue must be related to the floating point arithmetic being used for elements_of_bounded_height. The four points appearing in the \"expected\" list and not the \"for\" list have relative height exactly equal to 5, which is the bound that is being passed to the elements_of_bounded_height function.

I guess I'll mark this as needs-review, although I'm not 100% sure I've resolved it. I won't be able to work on this for a few days if someone wants to take over in the meantime.

Yes, there is a TODO in the enumeration of points of bounded height in number fields (from #15389) to address the precision sensitivity.

> `enum_projective_number_field` (#17386) is missing points on OSX 10.6.8, possibly other platforms.


Just seen (with Sage 6.6) on Linux x86_64 (Haswell-E CPU), FSF GCC 4.9.2 (but not e.g. 4.4.3); patch fixes the doctest failure.
