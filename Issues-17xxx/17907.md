There seems to be an issue with the way 'bound' is defined for points_of_bounded_height. If the expected bound is an absolute height bound and you want to convert to a relative height bound, you need to raise to the power (degree of number field), not 1/(degree of number field).

I seem to remember something like this happening when we were testing elements_of_bounded_height, where sometimes points of exact height B would appear in the output, and occasionally they would not, depending on the machine.

One last comment: Because of the floating point arithmetic involved, the output of elements_of_bounded_height cannot be guaranteed correct (as per the warning in the documentation). Probably a warning to this effect should be included in the documentation here.

I've made a start here. I fixed the exponent on the bound. I added a precision parameter and the warning to the appropriate functions. I also upped the precision for the failed example, but since I can't reproduce, I can't be sure that will fix it.

I guess I'll mark this as needs-review, although I'm not 100% sure I've resolved it. I won't be able to work on this for a few days if someone wants to take over in the meantime.

Thanks for checking this. I've been having trouble finding someone with a machine which can reproduce the original error.

Yes, there is a TODO in the enumeration of points of bounded height in number fields (from #15389) to address the precision sensitivity.

> `enum_projective_number_field` (#17386) is missing points on OSX 10.6.8, possibly other platforms.

Just seen (with Sage 6.6) on Linux x86_64 (Haswell-E CPU), FSF GCC 4.9.2 (but not e.g. 4.4.3); patch fixes the doctest failure.
