This ticket adds support for coercions from form spaces/rings over the full
modular group to form spaces/rings over the Theta subgroup (which are both
Hecke triangle groups). In all other cases coercions between groups are disabled
since there is no "nice" common subgroup.


Depends on #16976

Hmmmm... it doesn't seem to compile here... perhaps because I already compiled parts of sage from develop, while the branch is based off 6.6.beta1.

Could you rebase it?

Hi

Hmm, running "make clean; make doc-clean; make" worked for me.
I'm a bit hesitant to rebase since I have a lot of work based on this branch.
Is it 100% save to rebase? What would be the exact command?
How would I propagate this change to the other dependent branches?

I could merge 6.6.beta3 instead?

Best
Jonas

Yes, of course cleaning and rebuilding would have done the trick, but the point is that you want a review so it gets into sage... so the code should be at least a little synchronized with the current state of sage.

Concerning the question of whether to "git rebase 6.6.beta3" or "git merge 6.6.beta3", and what happens to other branches... I don't know exactly ; I think rebasing is better, but you might want to check if the sage developer manual has something about it (I think there's some kind of git crash-course within).
