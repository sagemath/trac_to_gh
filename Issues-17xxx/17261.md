This ticket adds support for coercions from form spaces/rings over the full
modular group to form spaces/rings over the Theta subgroup (which are both
Hecke triangle groups). In all other cases coercions between groups are disabled
since there is no "nice" common subgroup.

<a id='comment:8'></a>Hi

Hmm, running "make clean; make doc-clean; make" worked for me.
I'm a bit hesitant to rebase since I have a lot of work based on this branch.
Is it 100% save to rebase? What would be the exact command?
How would I propagate this change to the other dependent branches?

I could merge 6.6.beta3 instead?

Best
Jonas

I saw there was already a merge commit, so maybe not.
In any case this seems like a simple change, can we put this to reviewed?

It should be straight-forward, it's just that someone has to review it before it gets applied...

As a summary:

Before there were no relations (coercions) between spaces over different groups but actually for certain groups (namly infinity and 3) there is a (canonical) relation. For this case I modified it such that it coerces elements accordingly.
