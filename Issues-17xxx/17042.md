I just noticed something useful I could use for my current problem, and it may also be useful to others. I hope it's not too "custom".

It can also be applied to Dima's example in the doc, as in his case the obstructions have size 3.

OK, then keep it as it is. But could you do the changes Set->set in that doctest?

It is like everybody has gave up thinking of algorithms.

Maybe I should change my job. I would be more useful to the world going over other people's loops.

Anyway, the constructor is now faster. It could be made faster, but at the cost of trying to understand why there is a `sort_faces` flag in this constructor, and I am convinced that it would make me angry.

Just to illustrate the speedup:

Before

```
sage: S=list(Subsets(range(13)))
sage: %time SimplicialComplex(S)
CPU times: user 6.72 s, sys: 64 ms, total: 6.79 s
Wall time: 6.72 s
Simplicial complex with 13 vertices and facets {(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12)}
```

After

```
sage: %time SimplicialComplex(S)
CPU times: user 172 ms, sys: 12 ms, total: 184 ms
Wall time: 172 ms
Simplicial complex with 13 vertices and facets {(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12)}
```

You shouldn't use `assert` to validate user input:

```python
assert (maximal_faces is None) or (from_characteristic_function is None)
```
as any assertion being raised is supposed to indicate a bug (plus they can be turned off). Instead raise an error

```python
if maximal_faces is None and from_characteristic_function is None:
    raise ValueError("maximal_faces and from_characteristic_function cannot both be specified")
```
(with perhaps a better error message).

However I do like the speedup of `SimplicialComplex`.

PS - This made me chuckle `:p`:

We should have rules about rules.

Assert statements are to check statements within the code that are (suppose to be) always true, and hence, should not depend on (the always potentially bad) user input. Thus if an assertion error is raised, there's a bug in the code. It's more of a general programming thing. (It was also something Jeroen enforced when he was release manager; IDK if Volker continues this.) Also they can be turned off (IDR offhand if it's at compile or run time) to encourage programmers to use them (or leave them in code) more.

Anyways, thanks for changing it.
