```
The setuptools patch `build/pkgs/setuptools/patches/easy_install_lock.patch` from #13201 breaks the removal of old versions of packages.

This has the following effect in Sage:
the wrong version of sagenb is used. Even after an explicit `./sage -f sagenb` installing `sagenb-0.11.0`, Sage still thinks I want to use an older version.

Looking at `local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/easy-install.pth` shows

```
[...]
./Flask_OpenID-1.2.4-py2.7.egg
./sagenb-0.10.7.2-py2.7.egg
./zope.interface-4.0.5-py2.7-linux-x86_64.egg
./sagenb-0.10.8.2-py2.7.egg
./sagenb-0.11.0-py2.7.egg
./itsdangerous-0.23-py2.7.egg
[...]
```

This leads to the following doctest failure:

```
$ ./sage -tp --long --sagenb
too many failed tests, not using stored timings
Running doctests with ID 2014-10-31-14-01-49-cac56b83.
Doctesting the Sage notebook.
Sorting sources by runtime so that slower doctests are run first....
Doctesting 51 files using 4 threads.

Hmm… I'm seeing the same error messages from `sphinxify`, even without the `--sagenb` flag, and even after manually removing `./sagenb-0.10.8.2-py2.7.egg` from my `easy-install.pth`. Is this some kind of legacy from this bug here, or is this a separate bug in its own right?

TL;DR: Found my mistake.

OK, I am on 6.5.beta2 which contains this since it got merged for 6.4.rc1. I guess my main problem was the following: I encountered the problem on a feature branch, then checked whether I could reproduce on develop. To do that, I copied the command line as printed by the test suite runner, The one to execute the test from one single file:

```
sage -t --warn-long 22.0 local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sagenb-0.10.8.2-py2.7.egg/sagenb/misc/sphinxify.py
```

I copied that line without really reading it, so I didn't realize that it was referring to the file in the version-specific sagenb directory. Then I started searching for it, found this one here, removed the old sagenb from my pth file, but the executed that same command line.

I guess I had somehow assumed that the error message was due to a bug in the code, and that bug in the code had been fixed by now. The fact that the doctest itself might have been updated didn't occur to me.

Sorry for the noise.
