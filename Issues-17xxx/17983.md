Certainly don't try to implement everything at the same time. This ticket should probably be considered as a "meta-ticket" with links to various other tickets, each fixing just one issue.

It might be a bit more work to develop things in various small tickets, but it's much easier for reviewers. It also helps development to move on: if one ticket gets stuck because of some discussion or because it was harder than initially thought, work can still continue on the other tickets.
