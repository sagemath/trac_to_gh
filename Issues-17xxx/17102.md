Can you say what exactly you did ? The reviewer has to check that you did no *remove* anything from the index, and that everything is in the right category.

If you say that you just sorted the categories then some scripts can be written to check it, but otherwise that's a much bigger amount of work.

I did almost nothing (in this round, more to come...): just changed phrasing of one-line descriptions as said in PEP 0257. No re-categorizing functions or like.
