I noticed that apparently `preparse` treats a (multiline) string as comment, if the first non-whitespace character is a `#`:

```
    L = line.lstrip()
    if len(L) > 0 and L[0] in ['#', '!']:
        return line
```

I wonder why, because it is not unusual for a block of code to start with a comment.  I cannot see where comments in later lines are treated, so I have no idea how to fix this.

The issue is that when calling preparse, if the first line is a comment (IDK why it would start with a `!`...) then it does not preparse anything further. Specifically, if there is a multiline statement that you want to preparse, but the first line is a comment, it doesn't do anything. For example:

```
# Comment
def foo(x):
    R.<y> = QQ[]
    return x * y
```
would not get preparsed. Given the description, the preparser works on the assumption that the input is a specific self-contained line, but it seems to have the functionality to handle multi-line input. I think we should either see if there is a line break and then preparse the rest after the comment line or very explicitly state the assumption.

Actually, I'm not sure that is true. How are block comments with `"""` handled? It seems like they are passed as a group to `preparse()` by the interpreter after stripping out `....:`. So here's what I believe happens:

I type in

```
sage: def foo(x):
....:     return 5 * x
```
which gets fed to the interpreter, which results in

```
def foo(x):
    return 5 * x
```
which then gets sent to the preparser as a complete unit (a single string) and becomes

```
def foo(x):
    return Integer(5) * x
```
Unless I am misunderstanding something?
