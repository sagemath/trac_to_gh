Sage has no function for disjoint union (or *direct sum*) of posets, neither for ordinal sum. These are mostly matter of wrapping right function of graph + writing documentation.

At same time maybe parameter name for `disjoint_union` on Graphs should be changed.

<a id='comment:1'></a>Something like this:

```
def sum_of_posets(self, other, labeling=None):

    if labeling==None:

        for i in self.list():

                if i==j:
                    raise ValueError('What should be type of this error?')
        elements=self.list()+other.list()
        coverings=self.cover_relations()+other.cover_relations()
        return Poset( (elements, coverings) )
    if labeling=='linear':
        return sum_of_posets(self.canonical_label(), other.canonical_label().relabel(lambda x: x+self.cardinality()))
    if type(labeling) is tuple and len(labeling)==2:
        return Poset( ([(labeling[0],x) for x in self.list()]+[(labeling[1],x) for x in other.list()], [[(labeling[0],x[0]),(labeling[0],x[1])] for x in self.cover_relations()]+[[(labeling[1],x[0]),(labeling[1],x[1])] for x in other.cover_relations()]) )
    raise ValueError("Labeling must be 'linear' or tuple of two elements")
```

For testing try for example

```
P1=Posets.PentagonPoset(facade=True).relabel(lambda x: x+10)
P2=Poset({0:[1,2],1:[3,4]})

sum_of_posets(P1, P2, labeling=('a', 'b')).show(figsize=4, vertex_size=1000)
sum_of_posets(P1, P2, labeling='linear').show(figsize=4, vertex_size=1000)
sum_of_posets(P1, P2).show(figsize=4, vertex_size=1000)
sum_of_posets(P1, P1)
```

Another question: should ordinal sum be part of same function with keyword like `type='ordinal'` or distinct function?

<a id='comment:3'></a>Hello !

We already have a `Graph.disjoint_union` that accepts this kind of parameter. If you want to have a similar feature at `Poset` level I suggest that you only expose this function. The code would just be :

```
return Poset(self.hasse_diagram().disjoint_union(other.hasse_diagram()))
```

Then, if you want to have more ways to tune the result through the points' name, the best would be to change the Graph function itself, which would consequently give the same feature to the Poset function.

True. I must learn functions provided by (di)graphs and expand them if necessary.

This breaks at least with

```
P1=Posets.PentagonPoset(facade=True)
P1=Posets.PentagonPoset(facade=False)
P=Poset(P1.hasse_diagram().disjoint_union(P2.hasse_diagram()))
P.show()
```

But I'll add checks as necessary. I guess it is OK to simply refuce summing up facade and non-facade poset.

It works on my computer: beware, in your code both posets are named P1. So P2 is defined only on your computer.

<a id='comment:7'></a>Hello !

> Function could then be something like


1) Besides checking that `other` is a !Poset, I do not understand why this function should do anything else than calling the graph routine. And it would be that routine's job to check that the input is correct.

2) I believe that the default behaviour should be "pairs", because it is the behaviour that keeps the most information. And people can force `relabel="integers"` if they like.

> 1) Why I must say `other.hasse_diagram()` on last line, `other._hasse_diagram` should work. Again some copy-immutable -thing?


Because of that:

```
sage: Poset(DiGraph({"a":["b"]})).hasse_diagram().vertices()
['a', 'b']
sage: Poset(DiGraph({"a":["b"]}))._hasse_diagram.vertices()  
[0, 1]
```

> 2) What should be the name of parameter and values for it? `verbose_relabel` to be consistent with graphs? Default value for it?


I don't really know... `verbose_relabel` in the !Graph function is not a very good name, so perhaps we should change it. What about `Poset.relabel(labels="pairs")` by default, and `labels="integers"` otherwise ? And we could update the graph function with it. That also involves deprecating the old parameter name.

But on documentation it seems that `rename_keyword` is only able to change name of argument. Here we should also change value from `True` to `pairs` and from `False` to `integers`.

Sounds reasonable.

Other things: Enumerative Combinatorics by Richard P. Stanley uses "disjoint union" as preferable name. It is also used on graphs, so it is probably best to use here also.

I'll make some kind of commit just to show what I'm now thinking.

I am not sure that you can. The way you do it is wrong, however, for when you do `type(other) == type(MeetSemilattice({}))` you create a semilattice object for nothing. What you need is the 'isinstance' Python function.

Then you will probably have to do something like that:

```
if isinstance(self, LatticePoset) and isinstance(other, LatticePoset):
   return a_lattice
elif isinstance(self, MeetSemilattice) and isinstance(other, MeetSemilattice):
   return a_join_semilattice
elif isinstance(self, JoinSemilattice) and isinstance(other, JoinSemilattice):
   return a_join_semilattice
else:
   return a_poset
```

The 'if' will execute a bit more code than in your layout, but considering the operations involved here we do not care at all, the speed loss is nonexistent. And it is *much* clearer to read.

<a id='comment:22'></a>Review of your branch in its current state:

1) Lines are 100 characters long: we try to keep it 80characters max

2) It may not be visible to you with the text editor you use, but the lines you skipped are actually filled with spaces.
http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/121555/why-is-trailing-whitespace-a-big-deal

3) Please remove those `\` at the end of the lines in the documentation. If the doc does not build properly, it is because this is incorrect

```
INPUT:

    - a very long
    line of doc
```

But this will work:

```
INPUT:

    - a very long
      line of doc
```

Sphinx (the software that builds the doc) is not very pleasant software to work with.

3) I usually write `If ``labels='pairs'``` instead of `If labels='pairs'` in the doc because it is actual Python code, but it is probably up to you. Same for mathematical things like ``(0,x)``.

4) The doc of ordinal sum claims that it returns a lattice. It does not.

5) What about an "elif" ?

```
        else:
            if labels != 'pairs':
```

6) please use `isinstance` instead of `type` or `in LatticePosets()`. The latter is related to categories: it is probably safe to use by itself but it is a bit weird to see some calls to 'type' and then category queries.

7) It is a bit weird to see that the elements labelled with 1 are smaller than the elements labelled with 0:

```
sage: p1=posets.ChainPoset(1)                            
sage: p1.ordinal_sum(p1).is_greater_than((0,0),(1,0))
True
sage: p1.ordinal_sum(p1).is_greater_than((1,0),(0,0))
False
```

8) The description of "labels" is written in a slightly incorrect english `^^;`

But then one cannot say `.disjoint_union(G, 'integers')`. Maybe I don't worry that much.

I think you worry too much, but if you just need to be soothed then I would say that it is better this way: some people may be expected to already use `.disjoint_union(G,True)` while nobody is using `.disjoint_union(G,'pairs')` are you are creating the syntax.

> As for another post: After `x=42` for example `isinstance(x, LatticePosets)` says `False`, but `isinstance(x, LatticePoset)` gives error message.


That's because the combinat guys cannot be trusted to implement anything reliably.

The error message tells you that `LatticePoset` is not a class, and indeed it is a function. `LatticePoset??` tells you that it returns `FiniteLatticePoset` objects, and if you want to know where to find this class, it is defined there:

```
sage: import_statements("FiniteLatticePoset")
from sage.combinat.posets.lattices import FiniteLatticePoset
```

then:

```
sage: from sage.combinat.posets.lattices import FiniteLatticePoset
sage: x=42
sage: isinstance(x,FiniteLatticePoset)                                         
False
```

<a id='comment:31'></a>Hellooooo !

Here is a commit on top of yours. Set the ticket to `positive_review` if you agree with it:

1) some english (has->have) and some commas
2) Rewrote '0,v' as ```(0,v)``` so that it appears as code in the doc. As you also wrote 'integers', it may have led to believe that '0,v' is a string.
3) Changes like that

```diff
-        if isinstance(self, FiniteMeetSemilattice) and \
-        isinstance(other, FiniteMeetSemilattice):
+        if (isinstance(self, FiniteMeetSemilattice) and
+            isinstance(other, FiniteMeetSemilattice)):
```
  code is easier to read when everything is aligned vertically.

4) Entries in the INPUT section should appear in the same order as the arguments that the function accepts. So I reversed the order of `verbose_relabel` and `labels`.

5) The tests did not pass in the graph/ folder because of function `join`. So I did to it what you had already done to `disjoint_union` and deprecated the old flag.
