To solve #17807, we preparse `0100` as `Integer('0100')` instead of `Integer(0100)`: thanks to #17413, this will give a deprecation warning so that users should know something funny is going on:

```
sage: 0100
/usr/local/src/sage-git/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/IPython/core/interactiveshell.py:2883: DeprecationWarning: use 0o as octal prefix instead of 0
If you do not want this number to be interpreted as octal, remove the leading zeros.
See http://trac.sagemath.org/17413 for details.
  exec(code_obj, self.user_global_ns, self.user_ns)
64
```

We also preparse new-style binary/octal/hex strings as integers instead of strings, which should be faster, see [comment:5].

<a id='comment:5'></a>I would think the slow-down for small integers makes the proposed changes very unattractive. The whole idea of preparsing `100` as `Integer(100)` is that in the AST and the generated byte code, the constant `100` is already stored as a numerical one, and hence conversion is much faster.

For instance, in code like:

```
sage: %timeit L=[Integer('1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000') for i in range(10000r)]
100 loops, best of 3: 11.4 ms per loop
sage: %timeit L=[Integer(1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000) for i in range(10000r)]
100 loops, best of 3: 4.66 ms per loop
```
you really start to notice this.

preparse_file mitigates issues like this a little bit by factoring out numeric constants, so that their conversion doesn't happen in inner loops.

If you want to store your numerical constants as strings in the byte code and have fast conversion, you should probably store them in hex. It's a little more work in the preparser, but the result is more compact and conversion to a numerical constant is truly linear in number of bits.

Is that really important? The "timeit" example is of course a bit artificial.

I think so. Storing the numerical constant as a string forces the decimal-to-binary conversion to happen at runtime. If you just write it as a python integer, the conversion happens at parsing, so by the time it's an ast and the compiler looks at it, you're already dealing with an integer.

If you use `preparse_file` instead of `preparse`, you'll see that numerical constants get pushed outside (which has its own set of problems, see #11542), which mitigates the string-conversion-in-inner-loop.
