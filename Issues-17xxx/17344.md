Plantri has an option `-d` to get the planar dual of a planar graph instead, for the various classes that it can generate.

It would be good to allow this option in the methods introduced in #16970.

This could be useful, as we have no class for planar graphs so far.

Nathann, I have a problem here for the dual of general planar graphs. The test I wrote is failing. And it seems that this may be a problem of multiple edges.

The Error message is

```
sage:  gen = graphs.planar_graphs(4,dual=True)  # optional plantri
sage: graphics_array([u.plot() for u in list(gen)])
...
ValueError: embedding is not valid for Multi-graph on 3 vertices
```
Do you think I should rather remove this `dual=True` possibility for general planar graphs ?

Hello,

when commenting the set_embeddings line, one obtains graphs, but they are not correct. It seems that every multiple edge is duplicated. For example, the "4 star graph" dual should have one vertex and three loops, it has 6 loops.

So, maybe a problem in read_planar_code ?

Well, now that is weird `:-P`

Can you see if plantri (in command-line) has some different output, which could let you check that it is indeed returning 'correct' graphs ? If that's correct, then indeed the problem may come from `read_planar_code`.

When there is no loop, this looks fine. So if we assume that the binary code is the same, then there must be a problem in the reading procedure.

For loops, as in the last two (duals of trees with 4 vertices), it could be just a matter of conventions. But I would expect only 3 loops, as these trees have 3 edges.

Ok, I think I see.

1) The output of plantri is giving the list of half-edges around each vertex. This is correct.

2) When the graph has no loops or multiple edges, the graph constructor of sage is able to eat twice the same edge (in both direction) and give just one edge. But when there are multiple edges, it will not identify the same edge given in two directions.

This does not seem easy to remedy. Maybe I should restrict my ticket to the cases where duals have no loops or multiples edges ?

Oh. I see. It seems that I forgot something when writing #15706 (see also https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/78OBybXrfI8) for `Graph([(1,2),(1,2)])` should display a warning.

I will write a small patch for this today or tomorrow.

Well, if a "planar code" always lists edges twice (once in each direction) isn't it better to just simplify this in this `read_planar_code` function ?

What you did is good. I had in mind some other test which I tried to add, but then I found a bug:

```
sage: [x.size() for x in graphs.planar_graphs(5,dual=True)]
...
ValueError: embedding is not valid for Looped graph on 4 vertices
```

Hellooooooo Frédéric!

The branch looks ready. I added a small commit on top of yours at public/17344: it modifies the latest doctest you added in order to make sure that we did not miss any edge while reading the planar code of the dual graphs.

If this is fine for you, please add this commit to your branch (or change the branch's name) and set this ticket to `positive_review`.

Thanks for your ticket,

Nathann
