Plantri has an option `-d` to get the planar dual of a planar graph instead, for the various classes that it can generate.

It would be good to allow this option in the methods introduced in #16970.

This could be useful, as we have no class for planar graphs so far.

The Error message is

```

Do you think I should rather remove this `dual=True` possibility for general planar graphs ?

It seems that the problems come from the embedding. You could first try to remove the embedding stored within the graph to check that it all works, and if it does try to find out what is wrong with the embedding contained in this graph ?

when commenting the set_embeddings line, one obtains graphs, but they are not correct. It seems that every multiple edge is duplicated. For example, the "4 star graph" dual should have one vertex and three loops, it has 6 loops.

So, maybe a problem in read_planar_code ?

Well, now that is weird `:-P`

Can you see if plantri (in command-line) has some different output, which could let you check that it is indeed returning 'correct' graphs ? If that's correct, then indeed the problem may come from `read_planar_code`.

Oh. I see. It seems that I forgot something when writing #15706 (see also https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/78OBybXrfI8) for `Graph([(1,2),(1,2)])` should display a warning.

I will write a small patch for this today or tomorrow.

Well, if a "planar code" always lists edges twice (once in each direction) isn't it better to just simplify this in this `read_planar_code` function ?

What you did is good. I had in mind some other test which I tried to add, but then I found a bug:

```
sage: [x.size() for x in graphs.planar_graphs(5,dual=True)]
...
ValueError: embedding is not valid for Looped graph on 4 vertices
```

P.S.: SOrryyyyy... I know that this review is becoming a bit unpleasant `^^;`

<a id='comment:25'></a>Hellooooooo Frédéric!

The branch looks ready. I added a small commit on top of yours at public/17344: it modifies the latest doctest you added in order to make sure that we did not miss any edge while reading the planar code of the dual graphs.

If this is fine for you, please add this commit to your branch (or change the branch's name) and set this ticket to `positive_review`.

Thanks for your ticket,

Nathann
