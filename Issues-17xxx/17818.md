Sage should have an interface to http://www.findstat.org, the "combinatorial statistics finder".  A first version, modelled after the interface to the OEIS is attached.  To get you started, you can try the following:

```
sage: findstat('St000045')                   # optional -- internet
    St000045: The number of linear extensions of the tree. 

    sage: s = findstat(3); s                            # optional -- internet
    St000003: The number of [[/StandardTableaux|standard Young tableaux]] of the partition.

    sage: s.browse()

    sage: stat = {pi: pi.length() for pi in Permutations(3)}
    sage: search = findstat(stat) ; search    # optional -- internet
    0: (St000018: The [[/Permutations/Inversions|number of inversions]] of a permutation., [], 6)
    1: (St000004: The [[/Permutations/Descents-Major|major index]] of a permutation., ['inversion-number to major-index bijection'], 6)
    2: (St000067: The inversion number of the alternating sign matrix., ['to alternating sign matrix'], 6)
    3: (St000224: The sorting index of a permutation., ['first fundamental transformation'], 6)
    4: (St000008: The major index of the composition., ['inversion-number to major-index bijection', 'descent composition'], 6)
    5: (St000059: The inversion number of a standard Young tableau as defined by Haglund and Stevens. [1]  , ['inversion-number to major-index bijection', 'Robinson-Schensted recording tableau'], 6)
    6: (St000153: The number of adjacent cycles of a permutation., ['reverse', 'first fundamental transformation'], 6)
    7: (St000156: The Denert index of a permutation., ['inverse first fundamental transformation', 'foata_bijection'], 6)
    8: (St000174: The flush statistic on semistandard tableaux., ['to alternating sign matrix', 'to semistandard tableau'], 6)

Your new commit has the same problem. When you use "::" somewhere, the next line must be indented. To make sure that everything works as it should:

1) Add your new file to the documentation, i.e. the SAGE_ROOT/src/doc/en/reference/databases/index.rst file

2) compile the documentation `sage -b && sage -docbuild reference/databases html`

And, of course, read the html page corresponding to your new file to check that it is alright.

Hello,

I really do understand neither your strategy nor your goal with this ticket.

oeis is a Sage completely independent project and we have this ugly parser because we do not have any choice: there is no API to access their database.

Findstat project highly uses Sage and you are one of the author. Instead of integrating findstat code inside Sage you decided to make a closed source project. Right, this is fine with GPL and this is your choice. Now you decide to interface your findstat project with Sage. As a consequence you oblige the user to have an internet access to play with findstat features. Fine, this is again your choice. Instead of providing a clean API from the findstat side (let say json answers from http queries) you chose to implement an ugly HTML parser with regexp to get the information on the Sage side. This is inefficient and counter productive and you should seriously revise your strategy.

Agreed. The website is nice as a website.

> Currently, I (Martin) am mainly interested in using FindStat from within [SageMath](SageMath).  I asked Christian whether this would be possible, and so he provided me with the necessary information to create this interface.


This is where I do not agree. The solution to make it Sagemath-friendly is not the interface proposed in this ticket. There should be another web interface for interaction with Sage. This is not the hard part of the work.

> I agree that a clean API is desirable, but it is beyond my knowledge, and beyond the human resources of the FindStat project.

In its current version, I am not sure this interface does more good to Sagemath than to Findstat.

> Therefore, if you are able to provide such a clean interface, please go for it!


I would if the code was freely available... please go release it!

I admit, this is not really important for me, I shouldn't have raised this point.  I am mainly a mathematician.  If this interface is useful to you, use it, otherwise don't.  I was asked to polish the code so it is usable for people other than me, so I spent a few days on polishing.  If it doesn't go into [SageMath](SageMath) that's fine with me.

I do not understand why you think that I am in the position to do that.  FindStat is not my website, not my code.

> 2) compile the documentation `sage -b && sage -docbuild reference/databases html`


Hi Nathann!

Many thanks for your help, but I'm afraid I need more.  Is there a way to make docbuild tell me where I made a mistake?  I obtain

```
[databases] loading pickled environment... not yet created
[databases] building [html]: targets for 10 source files that are out of date
[databases] updating environment: 10 added, 0 changed, 0 removed
[databases] Encoding error:
[databases] 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xe2 in position 24871: ordinal not in range(128)
[databases] The full traceback has been saved in /tmp/sphinx-err-YMbReV.log, if you want to report the issue to the developers.
Build finished. The built documents can be found in /home/martin/sage/src/doc/output/html/en/reference/databases
```

but I have no idea what that traceback is trying to tell me:

```

Hello,

```
[databases] Encoding error:
[databases] 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xe2 in position 24871: ordinal not in range(128)
[databases] The full traceback has been saved in /tmp/sphinx-err-YMbReV.log, if you want to report the issue to the developers.
```

Well, Sphinx says that there is a non-ascii character at position 24871 in some file. Have you checked whether there might be a non-ascii character at position 24871 in your file ?

Now I found it!  It is a long dash in a reference retrieved from FindStat.  I have to redo the doctests anyway, because the descriptions, names, references, etc., are all subject to change...

There must be something wrong with dashes. Every single time I get this error message it is because of a dash between the pages in the reference of a paper, i.e. 234--190.

Let's call this message "the dash message" from now on.

Hello,

Looks better now ;-)

Could you use a lazy import in the "all.py". What it means is that you have to replace

```
from sage.databases.findstat import findstat
```
with

```
from sage.misc.lazy_import import lazy_import
lazy_import('sage.databases.findstat', 'findstat')
```

What it changes is that you will have:

```
sage: type(findstat)
<type 'sage.misc.lazy_import.LazyImport'>
```
but mostly nothing else (access to method, tab completion, documentation is identical). The advantage is that it is not imported on startup. It would be really good since you are doing a lot of global imports in your module.

Vincent

Plenty of documentation issues! Did you try to run `make doc`?

1. After `INPUT:`, `OUTPUT:` there must be a blankline.

2. `TODO` sections must be indented, i.e.

```
.. TODO::

    we definitely should do this and that
```

3. The first line of the documentation should be an imperative and start with an uppercase. Replace

  ```
  returns the name of the collection
   ```
   with

  ```
  Return the name of the collection
   ```
   And no point at the end of this first sentence.

4. This is wrong and will raise an error during the creation of the documentation.

  ```
  EXAMPLES::
  
  A particular statistic can be called by its St-number or number::
   ```
   There should be two colon only if the next block is indented. In that case it should be

  ```
  EXAMPLES:
  
  A particular statistic can be called by its St-number or number::
   ```
   And in the following you forgot a colon

  ```
  To search for a distribution, send a list of lists, or a single pair:
   ```

There is a lot of useful information in the [developer guide](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/coding_basics.html#documentation-strings).

2. The documentation doesn't build (unless I made a mistake, I haven't been building docs in a while):

```
Error building the documentation.

Note: incremental documentation builds sometimes cause spurious
error messages. To be certain that these are real errors, run
"make doc-clean" first and try again.

3. I wonder whether it is okay that doctests open browser windows, @videlec, `@`ncohen.

4. How should doctests that change from the FindStat side over time be handled, @videlec, `@`ncohen. One (possibly not the best) example is

```

only happens sometimes (google search tells me this appears to be a firefox issue, but I wouldn't know how to handle this in Sage doctests.

Christian, the last commit is not following the conventions at http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/coding_basics.html#the-docstring-of-a-function-content:

    It [the one sentence description] must be followed by a blank line and end in a period.

Please revert.

Is I wrote some time earlier, you must run 

```
sage -t --optional=sage,internet path/to/interface.sage
```

If you only run `--optional=internet`, you are *only* running those tests having `# optional -- internet`, so all the imports (and a few others) are not performed.

My point here is: doctests can stop working without any change on the Sage side. This implies that a new Sage release possibly depends on someone fixing the doctests in the FindStat interface. I am not sure this is the right thing to do...

Well, but if this doctest (as currently written) doesn't pass, the interface will not work reliably: user might get a result where her statistic is produced via a map from a statistic on the new collection.

The constant ``_findstat_collections`` is really the only place that needs updating, and it should be easy to update it.  But it does need updating...

I am not necessarily arguing about doctest that tests whether the interface still works well (even though my general concern also applies to those, and e.g. the OEIS interface was broken several times IIRC).

What about the doctest

```
sage: print findstat(1).description() # optional -- internet
The number of ways to write a permutation as a minimal length product of simple transpositions.
```
after someone has changed the description of this statistic? Or the case that we added another collection -- would that break the interface, or would it only not serve the new collection as long as it is not added?

Yes, I agree that there is a problem with the other doctests, involving name, description, code, perhaps even values... But I don't really know what to do about this.  I think it would be a shame if the interface cannot go in just because of this.

A workaround might be to mark these EXAMPLES as random.  Once full search is implemented, I could have doctests that search for the description.  But I won't do this now.

The only doctest which is really necessary is the test in the FindStatCollection class.

Two things (see patchbot report)

- please use python3-style raise statements:

```
raise Error("this is the good way")
```
instead of

```
raise Error, 'this was the old way'
```
The bot says

```
Old-style raise statement inserted on 5 non-empty lines
```


- please make sure that every function is doctested.

I just did

```
sage: A = findstat({ S: len([B for B in S if len(B) == 1 ] ) for S in SetPartitions(4) },depth=0)
sage: A.submit()
ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)
...
ValueError: too many values to unpack
```

Instead, this worked:

```
sage: def statistic(S):
    return len([B for B in S if len(B) == 1 ])

sage: A = findstat(statistic,SetPartitions,depth=0)
sage: A.submit()
```
It took me a few minutes to figure how to properly give a statistic in order to submit it -- wouldn't it be nice if the first version would also work, or at least give a hint on how to do it?

Wow, great!

Because of lack of a computer I cannot really test your changes, so please forgive if I could answer the following questions myself:

* does it really make sense to make the class `FindStat` inherit from `SageObject`?  I thought the rule was for classes with "mathematical" objects, or at least objects the user can actually manipulate or inspect.  The reason I did not  use it was that the class `FindStat` actually should not produce any objects...

* I think I recall that in `__eq__`

```
    if (not isinstance(other, FindStatStatistic)):
         return False
```
  is actually unnecessary - but I'm not sure.  Could you please double-check?  (same for `FindStatMap`)

In any case: yes, I'm very happy with having this finished!

Thank you so much!

Martin

Hi Viviane!

I have just created two more classes `FindStatCollections` and `FindStatMaps` which serve as parents for collections and maps.  Although nice, this is not a very important feature, I think.  So I don't want to delay the review because of that.

However, if you are willing to review this in the same ticket I would push it to trac!  (Note that I'm a bit unsure whether I did things correctly with all this classcall magic.)

I have no idea why, but it seems that I needed to replace

```

I have been playing with the interface for some time now, and I consider it to be ready to get merged. Martin did a great job and the "guided tour" is an awesome point of entry to use the interface, with several easy examples to follow! When they pop up in real life, it might be worth to add also some more sophisticated use cases.

All tests pass on my machine with the optional flags set, I still wait for the patchbot to be green again  (though it does not do any doctests since they all require an internet connection) to give it a positive review.
