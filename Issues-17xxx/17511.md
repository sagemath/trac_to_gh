See [this comment](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/11483#comment:12), discussion in #13364, the supposed fix at https://sourceforge.net/p/maxima/bugs/2520/, [this ask.sagemath question](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/25269/i-dont-know-why-sage-return-0-for-integratesin2xabsx0pi-when-its-value-is-2/), and so forth.

E.g. this is annoying (but apparently right)

```
(%i1) load(abs_integrate);
(%i3) display2d:false;

(%o3) false
(%i4) integrate(abs(sin(x)),x);

(%o4) 4*(abs(sin(x))*(atan(sin(x)/(cos(x)+1))/2
                     +sin(x)/((cos(x)+1)*(2*sin(x)^2/(cos(x)+1)^2+2)))
        /abs(cos(x)+1)
        -(signum(1/(cos(x)+1))*signum(sin(x))*log(2*sin(x)^2/(cos(x)+1)^2+2)
         -signum(1/(cos(x)+1))*signum(sin(x))*log(sin(x)^2/(cos(x)+1)^2+1)
         +signum(1/(cos(x)+1))*signum(sin(x))
                              *(2*sin(x)*atan(sin(x)/(cos(x)+1))/(cos(x)+1)
                               -log(2)))
         /4)
```
but it doesn't do the definite integral at all, even the easy ones where abs does nothing on the interval!

Everything works in 8.9.b7 after #27958. Some doctests were added there.

Maybe one could add one doctest for

```
sage: integrate(abs(sin(x)),x)
-cos(x)*sgn(sin(x)) + sgn(sin(x))
```

This answer

```
sage: integrate(abs(sin(x)),x)
-cos(x)*sgn(sin(x)) + sgn(sin(x))
```
is *very* wrong (outside of [-pi, pi])! It takes negative values

```
sage: f = integrate(abs(sin(x)), x)
sage: (f(5) - f(0)).n()
-0.716337814536774
```
and the integral is supposed to go to `+oo` as `x -> +oo/-oo`...

I emailed Bernard Parisse, here is his reply:

```
Ce n'est pas une erreur, au sens ou un avertissement est renvoyé
0>> integrate(abs(sin(x))
Warning adding 1 ) at end of input
Attention, l'intégration de abs() ou sign() suppose un signe constant
par intervalles (vérifié si l'argument est réel):
  Verifiez [abs(sin(x))]
Discontinuités aux zeros de sin(x) were not checked
sign(sin(x))-cos(x)*sign(sin(x))
// Time 0.04

C'est à l'utilisateur de prendre garde aux discontinuites de la
primitive pour calculer une intégrale définie s'il utilise la primitive
renvoyée. Lorsqu'on demande à giac une intégrale définie, il essaie de
tenir compte des discontinuités, et il fait le calcul numérique en
parallèle pour verifier. En cas de non concordance, les 2 valeurs sont
renvoyées (la plupart du temps c'est la valeur numérique qui est la bonne).
```
which roughly translates as

```
This is not an error, in the sense that a warning is issued:
0>> integrate(abs(sin(x))
Warning adding 1 ) at end of input
Caution, integrating abs() or sign() assumes piecewise constant sign
(check if the argument is real):
Check [abs(sin(x))]
Discontinuities at zeros of sin(x) were not checked
sign(sin(x))-cos(x)*sign(sin(x))
// Time 0.04

It is up to the user to check for discontinuities of the antiderivative
to compute an integral using the antiderivative returned by giac.
When asking giac for an integral on an interval, it tries to take
discontinuities into account, and does the numerical integration in parallel
to check. In case of mismatch, both values are returned (most of the time
the numerical value is the one that is correct).
