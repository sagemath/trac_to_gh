sage: a = var('a')
sage: b = (1/a).fraction(QQ)
...
TypeError: unsupported operand parent(s) for '/': 'Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Rational Field' and 'Univariate Polynomial Ring in a over Rational Field'
```
The `1` apparently gets coerced into the `x`-ring, so we need to ensure equal rings somehow.

Of course, arbitrary term ordering ("lex" and "deglex" etc.) could also be considered. But I'd say a user should do the conversion by hand perhaps in this case.
