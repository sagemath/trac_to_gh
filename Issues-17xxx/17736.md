sage: a = var('a')
sage: b = (1/a).fraction(QQ)
...
TypeError: unsupported operand parent(s) for '/': 'Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Rational Field' and 'Univariate Polynomial Ring in a over Rational Field'
```
The `1` apparently gets coerced into the `x`-ring, so we need to ensure equal rings somehow.

Looks good to me. A potential feature request could be to allow the user to specify the ordering of variables, but perhaps that's overkill?

Hi, sorry for not being clear:

I merely meant the ordering of variable (names), where you currently call `sort()`. But as I said: it's an optional feature request which could go into a separate ticket.

Of course, arbitrary term ordering ("lex" and "deglex" etc.) could also be considered. But I'd say a user should do the conversion by hand perhaps in this case.
