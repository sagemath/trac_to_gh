I believe this is useful to have because I wouldn't think of using `rank` for a non-ranked poset (although it might be somewhat naive of me) and height is common terminology.

In your code for optimization purposes, you would be better served by plugging in `P.rank() + 1`, but from a user-interface/teaching perpective, it would be good to have a height method.

```
Return the height (the length of longest chain) of the poset.
