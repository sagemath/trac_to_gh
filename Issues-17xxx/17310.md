In discussions after #17252, Jennifer Morse pointed out that the algorithm to convert a strong marked column strict tableau to a sequence of transpositions could be made more efficient by always choosing the largest rightmost marking as the end point.  The previous version of this algorithm scanned the potential marked column strict tableaux from right to left and pulled off markings if applying a transposition lowered the length of the core by one.  This version will test fewer potential marked ribbons.

I will continue to run a few tests to make sure, but I think that this version shaves a few seconds off of the tests of k_tableau.py

So I've made some changes and massaged out some more speed. My timings are below. I've also marked two tests as long because the file takes some 110s to run on mine (each were about 9s). However I'll let someone else (Anne) do the final review on the math portion.

Original timings:

```
sage: CST_to_trans = StrongTableaux.marked_CST_to_transposition_sequence

100 loops, best of 3: 8.32 ms per loop

Without my changes:
