In discussions after #17252, Jennifer Morse pointed out that the algorithm to convert a strong marked column strict tableau to a sequence of transpositions could be made more efficient by always choosing the largest rightmost marking as the end point.  The previous version of this algorithm scanned the potential marked column strict tableaux from right to left and pulled off markings if applying a transposition lowered the length of the core by one.  This version will test fewer potential marked ribbons.
