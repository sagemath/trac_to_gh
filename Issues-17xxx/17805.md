I want to turn the free monoid element `xxyx` into the list `[x, x, y, x]`. Currently the `to_word` method does something like this, but it returns a word consisting of letters whose parent is `str`, while I want a list consisting of generators of the free monoid. The attached branch does this. I am using it as a primitive in defining an endomorphism of the free algebra.
