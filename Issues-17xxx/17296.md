```
Some included software was updated since our last update.
In particular the new libtool 2.4.3 needs specific care as it uses pieces from gnulib.

Texinfo is NOT updated to 5.x as these new versions errors out when building old software.

to

```
./bootstrap.sh

My bad, i was playing around and ending up with half broken versions of Sage's autotools and that was a temporary fix for me to use system wide stuff.
I'll put the `source` version back in.

I don't think so.

The number "2.62" was specifically chosen as being a "rare" version, not many operating systems come with that version by default. The version 2.59 is much more widely used, leading to more chances of a false positive.

Oh, I thought I went the other way around and changed 59 by 62 for my own testing...
I'll fix that as well.

Just to satisfy my curiosity, I'm counting the `autoconf` version numbers of all `configure` files in all Sage packages:

```
2.13: 7
2.50: 0
2.51: 0
2.52: 3
2.53: 0
2.54: 0
2.55: 0
2.56: 0
2.57: 1
2.58: 0
2.59: 5
2.60: 0
2.61: 3
2.62: 0
2.63: 4
2.64: 30
2.65: 0
2.66: 0
2.67: 1
2.68: 25
2.69: 37
```

This should give a very rough idea how popular various `autoconf` versions are.

case $0 in

Anyway, is using `source` really mandatory?
