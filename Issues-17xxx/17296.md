Some included software was updated since our last update.
In particular the new libtool 2.4.3 needs specific care as it uses pieces from gnulib.

Texinfo is NOT updated to 5.x as these new versions errors out when building old software.

What is the reason for changing

```
source bootstrap.sh
```
to

```
./bootstrap.sh
```

And did you manually change the make rules for `$(SAGE_LOCAL)/automake-1.11.3`? The line continuations looks different.

My bad, i was playing around and ending up with half broken versions of Sage's autotools and that was a temporary fix for me to use system wide stuff.
I'll put the `source` version back in.

I don't think so.
I'll regenerate everything anyway.

The number "2.62" was specifically chosen as being a "rare" version, not many operating systems come with that version by default. The version 2.59 is much more widely used, leading to more chances of a false positive.

Oh, I thought I went the other way around and changed 59 by 62 for my own testing...
I'll fix that as well.

Just to satisfy my curiosity, I'm counting the `autoconf` version numbers of all `configure` files in all Sage packages:

```
2.13: 7
2.50: 0
2.51: 0
2.52: 3
2.53: 0
2.54: 0
2.55: 0
2.56: 0
2.57: 1
2.58: 0
2.59: 5
2.60: 0
2.61: 3
2.62: 0
2.63: 4
2.64: 30
2.65: 0
2.66: 0
2.67: 1
2.68: 25
2.69: 37
```

This should give a very rough idea how popular various `autoconf` versions are.

Ok, now I remember why I removed the source thing.
The libtool 2.4.3 bootstrap script needs libtoolize, wand with source it points to the not yet available libtool 2.4.3.

Ok we have an issue with `gnulib` and using `source`:

```
# Override the default configuration, if necessary.
# Make sure that bootstrap.conf is sourced from the current directory
# if we were invoked as "sh bootstrap".
case $0 in
  */*) test -r "$0.conf" && . "$0.conf" ;;
  *) test -r "$0.conf" && . ./"$0.conf" ;;
esac
```
Note that if `source` is used `$0` is `/bin/bash`.

Anyway, is using `source` really mandatory?
All needed vars should be exported, aren't they?
