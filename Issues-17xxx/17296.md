Some included software was updated since our last update.
In particular the new libtool 2.4.3 needs specific care as it uses pieces from gnulib.

Texinfo is NOT updated to 5.x as these new versions errors out when building old software.

My bad, i was playing around and ending up with half broken versions of Sage's autotools and that was a temporary fix for me to use system wide stuff.
I'll put the `source` version back in.

I don't think so.
I'll regenerate everything anyway.

I'm also wondering why you made this change:

+if ! env "AUTOCONF_VERSION=2.59" autoconf --version | grep >/dev/null '2[.]59'; then

The number "2.62" was specifically chosen as being a "rare" version, not many operating systems come with that version by default. The version 2.59 is much more widely used, leading to more chances of a false positive.

Oh, I thought I went the other way around and changed 59 by 62 for my own testing...
I'll fix that as well.
I must admit I did not have the time to check the full diff myself yet.

Just to satisfy my curiosity, I'm counting the `autoconf` version numbers of all `configure` files in all Sage packages:

```
2.13: 7
2.50: 0
2.51: 0
2.52: 3
2.53: 0
2.54: 0
2.55: 0
2.56: 0
2.57: 1
2.58: 0
2.59: 5
2.60: 0
2.61: 3
2.62: 0
2.63: 4
2.64: 30
2.65: 0
2.66: 0
2.67: 1
2.68: 25
2.69: 37
```

This should give a very rough idea how popular various `autoconf` versions are.

Ok we have an issue with `gnulib` and using `source`:

```
# Override the default configuration, if necessary.
# Make sure that bootstrap.conf is sourced from the current directory
# if we were invoked as "sh bootstrap".
case $0 in
  */*) test -r "$0.conf" && . "$0.conf" ;;
  *) test -r "$0.conf" && . ./"$0.conf" ;;
esac
```
Note that if `source` is used `$0` is `/bin/bash`.

Anyway, is using `source` really mandatory?
All needed vars should be exported, aren't they?

Not really, actually I wanted this for autoreconfiguring GLPK using your scripts, but it seems GLPK used an obscure revision of libtool between 2.4.2 and 2.4.3.
