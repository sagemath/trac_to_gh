From sage-release, a suggestion to get this finalized:

---

> - whether the option --notebook-dir is documented in ./sage -h (or --advanced); 
>   IMHO it should be 

It is not, and that points us to

```
$ ./sage --notebook --help
usage: sage-notebook [-h] [--log LOG] [--notebook [NOTEBOOK]]

The Sage notebook launcher is used to start the notebook, and allows you to
choose between different implementations. Any further command line options are
passed to the respective notebook.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit. Can be combined with
                        "--notebook=[...]" to see notebook-specific options
  --log LOG             one of [DEBUG, INFO, ERROR, WARNING, CRITICAL]
  --notebook [NOTEBOOK], -n [NOTEBOOK], -notebook [NOTEBOOK]
                        The notebook to run [one of: default, ipython,
                        sagenb]. Default is sagenb
```
which also doesn't help, while that points us to

```
$ ./sage --notebook=sagenb --help
```
which unfortunately just gives the notebook? commands but doesn't tell how to use them with the notebook-specific options.

> - on whether the old behaviour "-n directory=sage.sagenb" is documented

It was documented in the following way, in `sage --advanced`

```
  -n, -notebook [...] -- start the Sage notebook (options are the same
                         as for the notebook command in Sage)
```
So I would say that since I *do* agree that anyone using this option probably is savvy enough to actually read the help, perhaps documenting exactly how the options are to be called in `sage --advanced` and/or `sage --notebook --help`  would be enough to resolve this issue.  (Changing `sage --notebook=sagenb --help` would require more annoyance than worth.)  This should be pretty easy to do in the script itself, and given that we never said exactly how to *call* the options before I think that as long as we clearly document this (not necessarily with zillions of examples, but maybe two) then this would work okay.

One could at the same time add the info about the default directory, incidentally.

Which part of "Any further command line options are passed to the respective notebook" is unclear?

If you want to add to the online-help then just post a commit. IMHO it is clear and concise. There is always a tradeoff between longer and buried in a text wall.

Because user X will know to read help, but may NOT understand the arcane syntax for doing so!  Namely, I would think this continues to allow

```
sage --notebook foo=bar
```
because I had never even heard of the `sage --notebook -- foo=bar` syntax.  Yes, I'm stupid and uneducated.  Well, so will many users be.  Especially since I was wrong - I said
> It was documented in the following way,

but it still *is* documented this way.

> If you want to add to the online-help then just post a commit. IMHO it is clear and concise. There is always a tradeoff between longer and buried in a text wall. 

Yes, of course.  Though Let me see if I can cook something up; my concern is that I will make a stupid mistake, while you speak this syntax natively, as it were.  For instance, is this a way to spice this up *correctly*?

```
usage: sage-notebook [-h] [--log LOG] [--notebook [NOTEBOOK]] [--option=foo ...]

The Sage notebook launcher is used to start the notebook, and allows you to
choose between different implementations. Any further command line options are
passed to the respective notebook.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit. Can be combined with
                        "--notebook=[...]" to see notebook-specific options
  --log LOG             one of [DEBUG, INFO, ERROR, WARNING, CRITICAL]
  --notebook [NOTEBOOK], -n [NOTEBOOK], -notebook [NOTEBOOK]
                        The notebook to run [one of: default, ipython,
                        sagenb]. Default is sagenb}}}
   --option=foo       Additional options to be sent to the notebook can
                               be added using this syntax
```

Oh.

```
and at the very least 

```
    echo "  -n, -notebook [...] -- start the Sage notebook (options are the same"
    echo "                         as for the notebook command in Sage)"

could be fixed somehow.  From looking at `src/bin/sage` it looks like this only runs the default notebook.

And would this be acceptable?

I tested a few things.

Does **not** work as expected:

* Directory with slashes

```
./sage -n default directory=/tmp/test
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
  File "/local/sage/sage-6.4.rc1/local/lib/python/ast.py", line 37, in parse
    return compile(source, filename, mode, PyCF_ONLY_AST)
  File "<unknown>", line 1
    /tmp/test
    ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```
  This worked in 6.3:

```
/local/sage/sage-6.3/sage -n directory=/tmp/test
```


Work as expected:

```
./sage -n
./sage -n default
./sage -n -- directory=test
./sage -n default directory=test.sagenb
./sage -n sagenb "directory='/tmp/test'"
./sage -n -- "directory='/tmp/test'"
./sage -n default port=1234
./sage -n -- port=1234
```

Replying to [@kcrisman](#comment%3A21):
> I think the point was that one needed `--option=foo` if one didn't say which type of notebook, right?

I do not see what you mean here; I could not get any of `--directory=test` or `--option=directory=test` to work, but I did not really expect it previously; but as I said, I do not see what you mean with `--option=foo`.

Thanks, fixed. I also added the examples:

```
$ ./sage -n -h
usage: sage-notebook [-h] [--log LOG] [--notebook [NOTEBOOK]]

The Sage notebook launcher is used to start the notebook, and allows
you to choose between different implementations. Any further command
line options are passed to the respective notebook.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit. Can be combined with
                        "--notebook=[...]" to see notebook-specific options
  --log LOG             one of [DEBUG, INFO, ERROR, WARNING, CRITICAL]
  --notebook [NOTEBOOK], -n [NOTEBOOK], -notebook [NOTEBOOK]
                        The notebook to run [one of: default, ipython,
                        sagenb]. Default is sagenb

EXAMPLES: 

* Run default notebook on port 1234. Note that the first argument
  after "-n" will be interpreted as notebook name unless you stop
  processing with "--":

      sage -n default port=1234
      sage -n -- port=1234      # equivalent
      sage -n port=1234         # ERROR: invalid notebook name

* Run IPython notebook in custom directory:

      sage --notebook=ipython --notebook-dir=/home/foo/bar
```

Thanks for the feedback, Clemens, that's very helpful.  I checked that this fixed it, and it certainly shouldn't break anything.

Volker - oh, that makes great sense, and I like the way you did it.  I hope the following reviewer patch is acceptable for `src/bin/sage`.
