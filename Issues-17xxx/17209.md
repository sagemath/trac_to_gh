I would like to have a green polygon with black border. I can achieve this by superposing two polygons:

```
sage: P = polygon([[0,0],[0,1],[2,1],[1,0]],color='limegreen',fill=True)
sage: P += polygon([[0,0],[0,1],[2,1],[1,0]],color='black',fill=False)
sage: P
```
It should be possible to do that with **one polygon**, using the `edgecolor` keyword of `matplotlib`.

See http://ask.sagemath.org/question/24600/how-to-plot-a-polygon-with-distinct-colors-for-border-and-interior/
