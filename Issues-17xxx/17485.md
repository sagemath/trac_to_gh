Documentation says first "Return the characteristic polynomial of a **graded** poset - -", then later "If P is a **graded poset with - -  a unique minimal element**"  and the function can throw "the poset should be **ranked**". Somebody understanding what is characteristic polynomial should check this.

Also the list of poset functions at the beginning of the file does not contain this function.

<a id='comment:6'></a>I can see no problem with the doc.

The method is defined for graded posets with exactly one minimal element, as explained.

Such a poset will be ranked. If it is not, the method raises an error.

The only "problem" I can see is that it will return something (not interesting) for posets with are ranked but not graded with one minimal element. I do not care, but it would be possible to add more checks to prevent this to happen.

Then either it should say "If `P` is a **ranked** poset with rank `n` and - -" OR raise "the poset should be **graded**", whichever you seem to be correct.

Should this kind of function be defined with one-line description "Return the characteristic polynomial of the poset" and longer explanation starting with "The poset is assumed to be - - and - -. If it is not, an exception is raised."?
