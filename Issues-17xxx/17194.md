In #16747, the optional arb package is proposed for inclusion in sage. That ticket did not have any bindings for the Sage library.

In the present ticket, rather minimal bindings are provided.

As a proof of concept, the digamma function of a `RealIntervalFieldElement` is implemented by converting it to an `RealBall`, computing the digamma function via the arb library, and converting the result back.

Sage should arguably have a `RealBallField` and `ComplexBallField` with concrete implementations `RealBallField_arb` and `ComplexBallField_arb` (it would be useful to provide alternative implementations, for example to provide actual circular complex balls).

Anyway, I took a quick look at the code, and it seems fine to me.

What alternative do you recommend? Calling `is_package_installed()` once and storing the result in a module global variable? Or just `try`ing to call the arb code and catching the exception?

Concerning renaming `Arb` to `RealBallElement`: `real_mpfi` aka `RealIntervalFieldElement`  and `arb` have some similarities in their goals; the implementation is different, there might be more functions in the `arb` library, and there are the corresponding functions for complex balls. Do we want to stress the difference between `RealBallElement` and `RealIntervalFieldElement`? Or would `RealBallElement` be some kind of special case of `RealIntervalFieldElement`.

I'll try to implement a parent, but it will take some time. The parent would then be `RealBallField`; what about `RealBallFieldElement` for the current `Arb`?

You could possibly make it so that one can choose between two different implementations of `RealIntervalField` and `ComplexIntervalField`, just like one can choose between:

`PolynomialRing(ZZ, implementation='NTL')`

`PolynomialRing(ZZ, implementation='FLINT')`

So you might look up how those are implemented. I don't have an opinion on whether this is better than what you're doing right now.

[jdemeyer](#comment%3A18) was in favor of making a clear distinction between `RealIntervalField` and `RealBallField`. Therefore, I chose to implement the `_repr_` method of a `RealBallElement` to look different from that of a `RealIntervalFieldElement` and close to the `arb_printd` method.

Of course, doing it the `RealIntervalFieldElement` way would be easy, because conversion to a `RealIntervalFieldElement` is already implemented, so we could simply delegate the task.

Jeroen, do you have a comment on this?

What are the disadvantages if it is a Cython class?

While working on #17222, I found that I spent most of the time in many, many calls of `ComplexIntervalField.__call__`. Therefore, I wanted `RealBallField` to be a Cython class in order to save any bit of performance possible.

> * I'm not sure if setting up coercion maps from real interval fields is a good idea. It's probably sound from the mathematical point of view, but I seem to remember that bidirectional coercions are at least discouraged, and when computing, say, the sum of an interval and a ball, I'd tend to expect the result to be an interval. Or perhaps this should depend on the precisions of the arguments...?


I do not understand your last comment on the precisions of the arguments. 

Apart from that, do you have an opinion on how the output of the balls should look like? See comments [27](#comment%3A27) and [28](#comment%3A28).

This coercion is now removed. So we do not coerce from anywhere at the moment. Coercions may be added later as needed.

Furthermore, we use arb's `arb_get_str` method for `_repr_` now.

I don't know exactly `:-)`. I think Nicolas Thiéry used to say that sticking to Python for parents when possible was better, perhaps because of the tricks the category framework plays. But if there is a performance reason for using Cython, I'm all for it!

I will try to have a closer look at this ticket in the next few days if I have time... but no guarantees at all!

In view of the answers to my recent questions on sage-devel (`<mbdlc7$bjo$2`@`ger.gmane.org>` and its thread), I guess we should indeed try moving to a Python class (still compiled by Cython) and see if, for example, just making the element constructor a Cython function suffices to solve your problem.

Replying to [mmezzarobba](#comment%3A42):
> I made a few changes and pushed them to `u/mmezzarobba/arb`. Please tell me what you think.


I added up two one-line patches and pushed it on the ticket.

From the discussion on sage-devel, I also remember the recommendation to have the parent in a different `.py` file. If I understand the reasoning correctly, this seems to be preferred in order to avoid circular C imports.

Now, the behaviour is that the precision is stored in the Python parent. If we end up needing the precision frequently in arithmetic operations, that might turn out to be a bottleneck.

Thanks for doing it.

I now believe that my performance problems in #17222 with `ComplexIntervalField` might be caused by the fact that in `ComplexIntervalField`, the `call` function is overridden in Python.

Ok, thanks. And do you think operations on balls should take a precision argument (defaulting to the parent's precision)? Or is the ability to change the parent enough?

In other words, assuming `b` is a `RealBall` resulting from a 100-bit operation, and thus living in `RBF(100)`, which commands among the following do you think should work to compute the exponential of `b` with 53 bits of precision:
* `RealBallField(53)(b).exp()` (yes by the discussion I am quoting, I guess),
* `b.change_prec(53).exp()` (a possible shortcut for the above),
* `b.exp(prec=53)` (that's my question)?
(All three would yield a result in `RBF(53)`.)

Depending on that, I wonder if we shouldn't revert the commit where I changed "precision" to "default precision" in the messages.

IMHO, changing the parent is enough.

yes, but not yet implemented.

I think that `RealBallField(53)(b)` would not actually *change* anything in `b` except for changing the parent.

I do not think that this is needed: we'd have to find the correct parent, after all.

I do not think that this is necessary.

The [Arb documentation](http://fredrikj.net/arb/arb.html) says "The precision parameter [...] roughly indicates the precision to which calculations on the midpoint are carried out".

Later on, it is also mentioned that "For more complex operations, the precision parameter indicates a minimum working precision".

So "default precision" is not really correct, because the user is not allowed to change the default precision. So perhaps "working precision" would be more correct, or simply "precision".

Ok, I think we all agree. Thanks for your input!

So I made a few more changes as promised. As far as I am concerned I'd be happy to set the ticket to positive review, but (i) at the very least someone should review my commits, and (ii) it would be great if someone with more experience on writing (efficient) parent could check that we are not doing anything that will prove awfully wrong later on.

And (as a way to reassure myself regarding this last point `;-)`) I started implementing some basic arithmetic (edit: and more...) on `RealBall`s. See `u/mmezzarobba/arb`. But that's for another ticket, unless you feel like reviewing the first few commits here.

The follow-up is actually #17786.

I cross-reviewed your commits, they look good to me, doctests pass. For a test, I included `real_arb` into the documentation, documentation built fine.

Furthermore, I removed `fmpr.pxd` because it is no longer needed and deprecated in arb.

I'll take care of `is_zero`, `is_nonzero`, `__richcmp__`.

<a id='comment:63'></a>
The semantics of `!=` differ from those of real intervals: A ball is considered non-zero if it does not contain `0`.

So, `!=` is not `not ==`.

I prefer this for two reasons:

- We are wrapping `arb` here, and `arb` has this convention (`is_nonzero`).
- `__richcmp__` allows independent implementations for `==` and `!=`; I take this as a hint.

Furthermore, the semantics of `==` are different from real intervals: If `a is b`, then `a==b`, independently of whether they are exact or not. Otherwise, `a==b` can only hold if `a` and `b` are exact.

Hmm, if I read correctly, that's also how comparisons of `RealIntervalFieldElement`s work. Can you please be more specific about the difference you're seeing? For me the only difference is that, in the case of `RealIntervalFieldElement`s, `__nonzero__` is not consistent with `!= 0`.

Yes, I agree. Unfortunately, this convention (having `True` mean true and `False` mean false or don't know, basically) is not observed consistently in sage.

I don't know what to think about that. That's consistent with the semantics of arb functions, and up to now I have sticked to the convention in the bindings I wrote. But I fear this will lead to unexpected behaviors and inconsistencies wrt the rest of sage, and I really believe we should think it through more carefully before committing to the arb semantics.

I hope that the following examples make my impression of the current behaviour clear.

```
sage: a = RIF(-1, 1)
sage: from sage.rings.real_arb import RealBallField
sage: RBF = RealBallField()
sage: b = RBF(a)
sage: a.__nonzero__()
True
sage: b.__nonzero__()
False
sage: bool(a)
True
sage: bool(b)
False
sage: a == 0
False
sage: b == 0
False
sage: a != 0
False
sage: b != 0
False
```

In commit 5e41fcb, prior to my implementation of comparison, I obtain

```
sage: b < RIF(-3)
True
```
on my system because, sadly, sage reverts to comparing types if it cannot compare elements.

So if I understand you correctly, you'd be in favor of having methods `RealBall.lt` and leave the original methods untouched? I fear that a user may then mistakenly use the above example and get "surprising" results.

Perhaps we could overwrite `__richcmp__` in such a way that, if no coercions to balls are available, a `NotImplementedError` is raised?

I do not understand what you mean. In my understanding, having the implication that identical objects are mathematically equal, should not lead to unexpected behavior within the rest of sage. 

For me, the behavior of `RealIntervalFieldElement`

```
sage: a = RIF(-1, 1)
sage: from sage.rings.real_arb import RealBallField
sage: RBF = RealBallField()
sage: b = RBF(a)
sage: a == a
False
sage: b == b
True
```
is *very* unexpected. After all, equality is usually assumed to be reflexive.

So I think we agree: `==` and `!=` behave the same way for intervals and balls (with your implementation), except for the case of `x == y` when `x is y`. However, `__nonzero__` behaves differently. (And, to be clear: I believe that your choice is the more sensible one, but I don't like the inconsistency.) Is that correct?

I don't know if it is possible, and I doubt it is a good idea to circumvent the coercion system even if it can lead to problems.

> I do not understand what you mean. In my understanding, having the implication that identical objects are mathematically equal, should not lead to unexpected behavior within the rest of sage. 


Forget it, I think I convinced myself that it was ok—as long as a ball is understood as representing a single real number, of course. (And never as a subset of the real line whose image by a given function needs to be bounded, say.)

I wouldn't say that: after all, it does not hold true that for all x, y in [-1,1], x=y...

> After all, equality is usually assumed to be reflexive.


Yes, but that argument would be (almost) equally valid in the case of `RBF(foo) == RBF(foo)`, and I don't think we want that to hold if `RBF(foo)` is not a point ball!

We can always do that later because it would not change behaviour.

I do not understand your point. If `M` is a subset of the real line (represented by a ball) and `f` is a function, I still believe that `f(M)` can be computed by `RealBall`.

No, I do not want that.

For reference, I quote here from the [Arb manual](http://fredrikj.net/arb/issues.html):

"Identical pointers are understood to give permission for algebraic simplification. This assumption is made to improve performance. For example, the call `arb_mul(z, x, x, prec)` sets `z` to a ball enclosing the set `{t^2 : t ∈ x}` and not the (generally larger) set `{tu : t ∈ x, u ∈ x}`."

Ok, that was very badly expressed once again. Sorry about that, I'm trying to do too many things at once `:-(`. 

All I was trying to say essentially is that if your think of balls as ranges, not approximate reals, then code like

```
def f(x, y): return x-y
def range(f, *args): return f(*args)
unit_ball = RBF(0, rad=1)
range(f, unit_ball, unit_ball)
```
looks correct, while it violates the rule about aliasing in arb that you quoted. I guess one could come up with more subtle examples with `cached_function`s or additional layers of abstraction.

A few more quick comments:
* I think we will need `fmpr` again later on to implement `rad()`;
* `_an_element_` can be inherited, but perhaps this requires some of the coercion & category stuff I implemented on the other ticket, I don't remember;
(so several of your last changes will probably be reverted in the follow-up ticket)
* we should add a note about aliasing similar to that which you quoted to the python package's documentation too;
* `arb_to_mpfi` will probably crash sage if the ball's endpoints are not representable within the exponent range of MPFR FP numbers (but it is close to impossible to construct such balls at this point), use `sig_on()` or `sig_str()` (without `_do_sig`) to prevent that;
* I personally find `return (lst is rt) or (arb_is_exact(...) and ... and ...)` more readable than your implementation of equality, but that's a matter of taste.

None of the above is really urgent or important and the current state of the code looks good to me, so I'm setting the ticket to positive review to avoid delaying it too much. But please feel free to make changes here if you want, and then I'll try to review them when I come back.

Anything `fmpr` can be done with `arf` module.

Yes, unfortunately I haven't added any code yet to underflow or overflow gracefully when converting to MPFR. When developing, I deliberately wanted this to crash rather than fail silently.

I should probably fix `arb_get_interval_mpfr` to set the endpoint to `+/- 2^MPFR_MIN_EXP` on underflow and `+/- inf` on overflow.

Rather than changing `arf_get_mpfr`, I might add a separate `arf_get_mpfr_overflow` that behaves as if you had computed an out-of-range value within MPFR (setting MPFR overflow flags and so on).
