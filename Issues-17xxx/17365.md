It tries to use some MSVCRT thread functions instead of Cygwin's ones and fails at link time because of undefined references.
(And later on numpy fails to build because of the same undefined references.)

The problematic files have suspicious timestamps:

```
...atlconf_misc.c: Timestamp out of range; substituting 2514-05-29 18:53:03.999999999
...atlconf_misc.c' has modification time 15759751875 s in the future
```
and end up with permission errors:

```
...atlconf_misc.c: Permission denied
```
Can you have a closer look at these files in the build directory?

But this has nothing to do with the patch here.
Maybe with our repackaged ATLAS tarball, but that was not changed here.

Seems to work fine for me once again...
The compilation did not finish yet so I can not ensure that the thread fix is working once again, but I don't get Travis' problem.

My stat output looks similar, I'll quickly attach the (start of the) log of the ongoing build.

Whatsoever, your compilation fails very early and it really looks like it is a filesystem issue.
