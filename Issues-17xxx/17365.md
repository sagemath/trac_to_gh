...atlconf_misc.c: Timestamp out of range; substituting 2514-05-29 18:53:03.999999999
...atlconf_misc.c' has modification time 15759751875 s in the future

and end up with permission errors:

```

```
Can you have a closer look at these files in the build directory?

But this has nothing to do with the patch here.
Maybe with our repackaged ATLAS tarball, but that was not changed here.

Seems to work fine for me once again...
The compilation did not finish yet so I can not ensure that the thread fix is working once again, but I don't get Travis' problem.

My stat output looks similar, I'll quickly attach the (start of the) log of the ongoing build.
