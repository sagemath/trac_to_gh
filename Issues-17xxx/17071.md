I've seen this sporadically on the buildbot recently, but not before 6.4.beta3:

```
sage -t --long --warn-long 51.5 src/sage/crypto/mq/sr.py  # 6 doctests failed
sage -t --long --warn-long 51.5 src/sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_sequence.py  # 9 doctests failed
sage -t --long --warn-long 51.5 src/sage/rings/polynomial/pbori.pyx  # Killed due to segmentation fault
```
Its strange because we didn't upgrade polybori recently.

But we upgraded m4ri and polybori depends on it. It has to be rebuilt.

True. I just noticed that the buildbot skipped a beat and accidentally built an old version, and after that the segfaults started.
