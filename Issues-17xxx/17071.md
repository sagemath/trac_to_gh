I've seen this sporadically on the buildbot recently, but not before 6.4.beta3:

```
sage -t --long --warn-long 51.5 src/sage/crypto/mq/sr.py  # 6 doctests failed
sage -t --long --warn-long 51.5 src/sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_sequence.py  # 9 doctests failed
sage -t --long --warn-long 51.5 src/sage/rings/polynomial/pbori.pyx  # Killed due to segmentation fault
```
Its strange because we didn't upgrade polybori recently.

Component: **build**
