<a id='comment:3'></a>Hello,

I am sorry that this ticket waited that long before a review.

1. There are some (minor) problems with typography:
   - indentation is not correct. It should be

```
def my_function(a, b):
     """
     The text here
     ...
     """
```
    and not

```
def my_function(a, b):
    """
        The text here
    ...
    """
```
- try to keep a space around the `==` and `!=` signs. In other words `a == b` instead of `a==b`. Similarly, add space after a comma as `function(a, b)` and not `function(a,b)`. This is just to clarify the reading. It is not mandatory.

2. There is a method `.diagonal()` to extract the diagonal of a matrix

```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^2-3)
sage: V = QuadraticForm(K,4,[1,0,0,0,2*a,0,0,a,0,2])
sage: m = V.Gram_matrix_rational()
sage: m.diagonal()
[1, 2*a, a, 2]
```
  would be better than using the `map(lambda x: M.Gram_matrix_rational()[x][x], ...)`

3. Instead of

```
    if self.base_ring()==QQ:
        return self.signature() == other.signature():
            Rat_Isom_flag = False
```
  you can do

```
    if self.base_ring() == QQ:
        return self.signature() == other.signature()
```
  And more generally you do not need to carry over this variable `Rat_Isom_flag`, just write some `return` in the conditional statements.

4. You can simplify the following

```
for i in range(len(K.real_embeddings())): 
    Mentries_emb = map(lambda(x):K.real_embeddings()[i](x),Mentries)
    Nentries_emb = map(lambda(x):K.real_embeddings()[i](x),Nentries)

    Mpos=0
    for i in range(self.dim()):
        if Mentries_emb[i]>=0:
            Mpos += 1
    ...
```
  into

```
for emb in K.real_embeddings():
    Mpos = 0
    for x in Mentries:
        Mpos += emb(x) >= 0

    ...
```
  I used two simplifications here
- you can iterate over a list elements
- adding a boolean to an integer is equivalent to adding `0` or `1` depending on the truth value

<a id='comment:6'></a>Hi Anna,

You made a small typo

```
if self.base_ring() == QQ:
    return self.signature() == other.signature():
        Rat_Isom_flag = False
```
You need to replace the `return` with `if`!

<a id='comment:9'></a>With the current code there is something wrong going on. If the dimensions are different then `Rat_Isom_flag` is set to `False`. This is fine. But then it will try to multiply the Gram determinant (for nothing since we already knew that they were not equivalent).

Similarly, in this loop

```
    for p in L:
        if self.hasse_invariant(p) != other.hasse_invariant(p):
            Rat_Isom_flag = False
```
if you found out that something is wrong during the first pass you will have to wait!

This is why I suggested to modify the code to

```
if bad behavior 1:
    return False
if bad behavior 2:
    return False
for i in some test case:
    if bad behavior 3:
        return False
return True
```

You forgot this one. I would be happy with more specifications and degenerate tests. For example, you can copy paste the following

```
TESTS:

The diagonal form must have the same base ring otherwise a
`TypeError` is raised::

    sage: K1.<a> = QuadraticField(5)
    sage: K2.<b> = QuadraticField(7)
    sage: V = DiagonalQuadraticForm(K1,[1,a])
    sage: W = DiagonalQuadraticForm(K2,[1,b])
    sage: V.is_rationally_isometric(W)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    TypeError: forms must have the same base ring.
```
Beyond that the code looks good to me. I am compiling the documentation right now to see how it looks.

$ git status -sb

Why did you upload again the ssh key? Did you have some trouble before that?

In order to test your access to the git server you can run `$ ssh git`@`trac.sagemath.org info`. If it tells you who you are this is fine. Otherwise, there is an identification problem.

<a id='comment:33'></a>Argh! You reintroduced a lot of trailing whitespaces.

Perhaps in the `TESTS` section, you can add

```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^5 - x + 2, 'a')
sage: Q = QuadraticForm(K,3,[a,1,0,-a**2,-a**3,-1])
sage: m = Q.matrix()
sage: for _ in range(5):
....:     t = random_matrix(ZZ,3,algorithm='unimodular')
....:     m2 = t*m*t.transpose()
....:     Q2 = QuadraticForm(K, 3, [m2[i,j] / (2 if i==j else 1)
....:                               for i in range(3) for j in range(i,3)])
....:     print Q.is_rationally_isometric(Q2)
True
True
True
True
True
```
I had some trouble going from the matrix to the quadratic form. There might be a simpler way.

EDIT: there was a type `m[i,j]` had to be replaced with `m2[i,j]`... otherwise the equivalence tested would have been between a quadratic form and itself!
