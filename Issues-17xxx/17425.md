Hello,

I am sorry that this ticket waited that long before a review.

1. There are some (minor) problems with typography:
   - indentation is not correct. It should be

```
def my_function(a, b):
     """
     The text here
     ...
     """
```
    and not

```
def my_function(a, b):
    """
        The text here
    ...
    """
```
- try to keep a space around the `==` and `!=` signs. In other words `a == b` instead of `a==b`. Similarly, add space after a comma as `function(a, b)` and not `function(a,b)`. This is just to clarify the reading. It is not mandatory.

2. There is a method `.diagonal()` to extract the diagonal of a matrix

```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^2-3)
sage: V = QuadraticForm(K,4,[1,0,0,0,2*a,0,0,a,0,2])
sage: m = V.Gram_matrix_rational()
sage: m.diagonal()
[1, 2*a, a, 2]
```
  would be better than using the `map(lambda x: M.Gram_matrix_rational()[x][x], ...)`

3. Instead of

```
    if self.base_ring()==QQ:
        return self.signature() == other.signature():
            Rat_Isom_flag = False
```
  you can do

```
    if self.base_ring() == QQ:
        return self.signature() == other.signature()
```
  And more generally you do not need to carry over this variable `Rat_Isom_flag`, just write some `return` in the conditional statements.

4. You can simplify the following

```
for i in range(len(K.real_embeddings())): 
    Mentries_emb = map(lambda(x):K.real_embeddings()[i](x),Mentries)
    Nentries_emb = map(lambda(x):K.real_embeddings()[i](x),Nentries)

    Mpos=0
    for i in range(self.dim()):
        if Mentries_emb[i]>=0:
            Mpos += 1
    ...
```
  into

```
for emb in K.real_embeddings():
    Mpos = 0
    for x in Mentries:
        Mpos += emb(x) >= 0

    ...
```
  I used two simplifications here
- you can iterate over a list elements
- adding a boolean to an integer is equivalent to adding `0` or `1` depending on the truth value

Vincent

Hi Anna,

You made a small typo

```
if self.base_ring() == QQ:
    return self.signature() == other.signature():
        Rat_Isom_flag = False
```
You need to replace the `return` with `if`!

Thanks, Vincent.  I fixed that, and added some blank space around another instance of '!='

With the current code there is something wrong going on. If the dimensions are different then `Rat_Isom_flag` is set to `False`. This is fine. But then it will try to multiply the Gram determinant (for nothing since we already knew that they were not equivalent).

Similarly, in this loop

```
    for p in L:
        if self.hasse_invariant(p) != other.hasse_invariant(p):
            Rat_Isom_flag = False
```
if you found out that something is wrong during the first pass you will have to wait!

This is why I suggested to modify the code to

```
if bad behavior 1:
    return False
if bad behavior 2:
    return False
for i in some test case:
    if bad behavior 3:
        return False
return True
```

Instead of doing `L=L1+L2` you can do `L=set().union(L1,L2)`. That way you will remove duplicates as in

```
sage: V = DiagonalQuadraticForm(K,[-1,a,-2*a])
sage: W = DiagonalQuadraticForm(K,[-1,-a,2*a])
sage: L1 = V.Gram_det().support()
sage: L1
[Fractional ideal (a + 1), Fractional ideal (a)]
sage: L 2 =W.Gram_det().support()
sage: L2
[Fractional ideal (a + 1), Fractional ideal (a)]
sage: L1+L2
[Fractional ideal (a + 1),
 Fractional ideal (a),
 Fractional ideal (a + 1),
 Fractional ideal (a)]
sage: set().union(L1,L2)
{Fractional ideal (a + 1), Fractional ideal (a)}
```
And there is no need to declare `L` (but you might find it simpler) by doing

```
for p in set().union(L1,L2):
    ...
```

`M` and `N` are computed early but not used early. It would make sense to move there declarations since if the dimension differ (the first test) then there is no need to compute them. You can move them after the `else` in the case that the base ring is not `QQ`. You can also move the declaration of `L1` and `L2`.

Could you add some tests for all the cases (starting from the Gram determinant being 0)?

More interesting: is there a way to return the transformation in case they are equivalent?

You forgot this one. I would be happy with more specifications and degenerate tests. For example, you can copy paste the following

```
TESTS:

The diagonal form must have the same base ring otherwise a
`TypeError` is raised::

    sage: K1.<a> = QuadraticField(5)
    sage: K2.<b> = QuadraticField(7)
    sage: V = DiagonalQuadraticForm(K1,[1,a])
    sage: W = DiagonalQuadraticForm(K2,[1,b])
    sage: V.is_rationally_isometric(W)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    TypeError: forms must have the same base ring.
```
Beyond that the code looks good to me. I am compiling the documentation right now to see how it looks.

It looks strange that you do not have access to the method! Note that you have pending modifications on the file `quadratic_form__equivalence_testing.py` as shown by `git status` (the `M` on the left). There might be something wrong with them. You can temporarily disable these with `$ git stash`. And then retry `sage -b`. You will be able to recover them later on by doing `$ git stash pop`.

sided note: your sage version is very old (but this is of no importance for this ticket since your modifications apply cleanly on the last version).

Why did you upload again the ssh key? Did you have some trouble before that?

In order to test your access to the git server you can run `$ ssh git@trac.sagemath.org info`. If it tells you who you are this is fine. Otherwise, there is an identification problem.

Argh! You reintroduced a lot of trailing whitespaces.

Perhaps in the `TESTS` section, you can add

```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^5 - x + 2, 'a')
sage: Q = QuadraticForm(K,3,[a,1,0,-a**2,-a**3,-1])
sage: m = Q.matrix()
sage: for _ in range(5):
....:     t = random_matrix(ZZ,3,algorithm='unimodular')
....:     m2 = t*m*t.transpose()
....:     Q2 = QuadraticForm(K, 3, [m2[i,j] / (2 if i==j else 1)
....:                               for i in range(3) for j in range(i,3)])
....:     print Q.is_rationally_isometric(Q2)
True
True
True
True
True
```
I had some trouble going from the matrix to the quadratic form. There might be a simpler way.

EDIT: there was a type `m[i,j]` had to be replaced with `m2[i,j]`... otherwise the equivalence tested would have been between a quadratic form and itself!
