This is a spin-off from #16571.

I'd like to introduce a helper method for doctests which will trace a given method of an object, printing its interaction with its surroundings: method entry and exit, arguments and return value, as well as access to other members and methods of this object. For details see the docstring of the branch I'll attach.

Done.

> * `PropertyAccessTracerProxy.__init__` and `PropertyAccessTracerProxy.fmt` need docstrings


Moved class docstring to init method, which is explicitely allowed by the dev manual you mentioned.

> * An author block and a copyright block are necessary at the top of the file.  See [here](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/coding_basics.html#headings-of-sage-library-code-files).


Done that, thanks!

I wrote some text at the beginning of the file to indicate what kind of code I'd eventually expect to be contained in this module. I think that my tracing code might not remain the only fixture, therefore limiting the documentation to just that seems like a bad restriction. I did however extend the documentation of the relevant classes as well, so they might now be easier to use on their own.

> * It doesn't make sense to leave `fixtures.py` out of the reference manual.  I think you add it by adding a line in `src/doc/en/reference/doctest/index.rst`, but I may be misremembering.


Worked fine, thanks!

Oh! I hadn't thought to run doctests in what I considered unrelated files, thanks for doing that! Fixed now.
