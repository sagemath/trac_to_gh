This is a spin-off from #16571.

I'd like to introduce a helper method for doctests which will trace a given method of an object, printing its interaction with its surroundings: method entry and exit, arguments and return value, as well as access to other members and methods of this object. For details see the docstring of the branch I'll attach.

> * The function `traceMethod` should be `trace_method` to fit the standard naming convention.  Was there a strong reason for the name you gave it?  If not, please change.


Done.

> * `PropertyAccessTracerProxy.__init__` and `PropertyAccessTracerProxy.fmt` need docstrings


Moved class docstring to init method, which is explicitely allowed by the dev manual you mentioned.

> * An author block and a copyright block are necessary at the top of the file.  See [here](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/coding_basics.html#headings-of-sage-library-code-files).


Done that, thanks!

I wrote some text at the beginning of the file to indicate what kind of code I'd eventually expect to be contained in this module. I think that my tracing code might not remain the only fixture, therefore limiting the documentation to just that seems like a bad restriction. I did however extend the documentation of the relevant classes as well, so they might now be easier to use on their own.

> * It doesn't make sense to leave `fixtures.py` out of the reference manual.  I think you add it by adding a line in `src/doc/en/reference/doctest/index.rst`, but I may be misremembering.


Worked fine, thanks!

> * There are two tests in `doctest/control.py` that need to be updated because of the new fixtures file. Otherwise all tests pass.


Oh! I hadn't thought to run doctests in what I considered unrelated files, thanks for doing that! Fixed now.
