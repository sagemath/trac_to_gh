There are some minor issues in documentation at `posets.py`. "Returns" should be "return", join_matrix() is not on it's place on alphabetical list, one line descriptions of is_xx() -functions use varying phrasing, link to is_lattice() is missing...

But more: Should list of functions be re-arranged by topic (instead of just one big list) like for example graphs already has? If this is desired, I may do this.

I suggest that we make this change now. It is then easier to go throught function list and check smaller things one by one.

Also, some lines of the index contain broken sentences (e.g. `open_interval`) or definitions that do not belong there (e.g. `lower_covers`). That makes the lines rather long: could you shortent them?

Btw, should "Return **a** list of the maximal elements of the poset." be "Return **the** list of the maximal elements of the poset."? Never sure about this a/an vs. the -thing.

I did it old-style. Wrote the two lists in two files, and compared them.

Okayokay..

Yeah sure sure.

I would expect "the", because that set is unique. The list is not really unique, as it is ordered, but well.. I expect that everybody expects "the" there.
