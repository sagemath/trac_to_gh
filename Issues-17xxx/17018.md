There are some minor issues in documentation at `posets.py`. "Returns" should be "return", join_matrix() is not on it's place on alphabetical list, one line descriptions of is_xx() -functions use varying phrasing, link to is_lattice() is missing...

But more: Should list of functions be re-arranged by topic (instead of just one big list) like for example graphs already has? If this is desired, I may do this.

Duh, I added `characteristic_polynomial` but did not see `canonical_label` nor `is_chain_of_poset` which were also missing from index. I drop `interval` intentionally, because it is just an alias for `closed_interval`.

> Also, some lines of the index contain broken sentences (e.g. `open_interval`) or definitions that do not belong there (e.g. `lower_covers`). That makes the lines rather long: could you shortent them?


I'll take a look. But I'm quite sure that there will be more to polish even after this round.

Btw, should "Return **a** list of the maximal elements of the poset." be "Return **the** list of the maximal elements of the poset."? Never sure about this a/an vs. the -thing.

I did it old-style. Wrote the two lists in two files, and compared them.

Okayokay..

Yeah sure sure.

> Btw, should "Return **a** list of the maximal elements of the poset." be "Return **the** list of the maximal elements of the poset."? Never sure about this a/an vs. the -thing.


I would expect "the", because that set is unique. The list is not really unique, as it is ordered, but well.. I expect that everybody expects "the" there.
