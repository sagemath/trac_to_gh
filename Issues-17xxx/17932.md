<a id='comment:11'></a>Why did you add `sage/databases/sql_db` here, there is also a database section in the reference manual?

`sage/misc/superseded` occurs twice.

Then there is a separate section about lazy stuff, so all lazy stuff should go in there.

The `AUTHORS` blocks should be formatted like [http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/coding_basics.html#headings-of-sage-library-code-files](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/coding_basics.html#headings-of-sage-library-code-files).

You should only use `::` to show code blocks, not for example here

```
    Databases are constructed via a triple indexed dictionary called a
    skeleton. A skeleton should be constructed to fit the following format::

    - skeleton -- a triple-indexed dictionary
```

Finally: `db.py` is completely deprecated and shouldn't be in the manual. `refcount.pyx` and `file_to_worksheet.py` don't really do anything, are unused and should probably be removed completely.

Because `reference/databases` is mainly about databases of mathematical objects, while SQL database acess is a programming utility. (There is text about ZODB and sqlite in `reference/databases/index.rst` that needs to be moved somewhere else, but I wanted to first add all missing modules, and only then organize the tables of contents.)

> `sage/misc/superseded` occurs twice.


A merge mistake... And I was sure I had checked this line specifically `:-//`

> Then there is a separate section about lazy stuff, so all lazy stuff should go in there.


I wanted to do that later as well. But fine.

So what should I use for ASCII art? (If you look at the context, that's what your example amounts to. The other obvious option, using nested lists, exceeds LaTeX's `itemize` nesting limit.)

And in general, I don't have the courage to fix the docstrings in all newly included files. I only made a few semi-automatic changes (some pretty idiotic I'll admit) so that the documentation builds.

> Finally: `db.py` is completely deprecated and shouldn't be in the manual. `refcount.pyx` and `file_to_worksheet.py` don't really do anything, are unused and should probably be removed completely.


But why shouldn't they be in the manual as long as the code is there (and the docs clearly say that `db.py` is deprecated)?

There are two cases:

1. people who already use the deprecated code don't need the manual since they manage to use the code without the manual.

2. people who do not use that code should not start using this deprecated code, so why should they see it in the manual?

I tried with

As for your other comments, yes, I think documentation of deprecated features can be useful to people who weren't already using them (for instance to migrate existing code that used these features), but I don't really care, so let's do as you want.

1. I am not too happy with the unstructured `src/doc/en/reference/misc/index.rst`, for example, why aren't `cython`, `cython_c` and `inline_fortran` together, what is `sage/ext/memory` doing there...? Perhaps you're simply trying to lump too many things together.

2. `sage/misc/sage_input` is duplicated.

3. `sage/misc/derivative` looks like it should be in calculus (no idea why the module isn't)

4. Please rebase to 6.7.beta0: `sage/ext/gen_interpreters` moved to `sage_setup/autogen/interpreters`

5. I would like to see `sage/misc/typecheck` and `sage/structure/element_verify` removed (unused modules)

6. `sage` -> `Sage`

7. I think we can remove the `WRONG (for now) docs` which have been wrong for over 6 years...

8. Many new `INPUT` blocks are badly formatted, the correct formatting is

```
INPUT:

- ``metadata`` -- The metadata_by_opname from a wrapper module
```

9. I think this comment can be removed:

```
TODO:

This stuff probably belongs somewhere like sage/misc/misc_c.pyx.
The only reason it's in its own file here is because of some circular cimport

I agree in principle, but do these changes really need to be done here? I would prefer to first get all modules included in the reference manual and then organize the tables of contents and modernize the docstrings.

Regarding `sage.ext.memory`, I don't really know where to put it, do you see a better place?

Maybe I mostly dislike the word `WRONG`.

Here is a new proposal: move that text out of code comments into the docstring under a `.. TODO::` heading.

When you're adding new modules to the documentation, at least add them in meaningful places.
For example, there are various modules about calling external code (`cython`, `cython_c` and `inline_fortran`, `python`, `sh`). These should be put together.

Also low-level stuff (like `ext/memory`, `fpickle`, `c3`,...) should be put together.

I though your answer in comment:41 was about that point too.

Ok, I can do a first pass on the table of contents in this ticket if you insist, but not right now.
