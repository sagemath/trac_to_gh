One can relabel a graph to 0,...,n-1 by just calling `.relabel()`, and I found myself typing `IS.relabel({v:i for i,v in enumerate(IS.ground_set())})` very often these last days.

With this patch one can relabel the point automatically to `0,...,n-1`.

Hello,

Compared with the possibilities from graph:
- what about a `inplace` argument?
- what about accepting lists as input. The following works with graphs

  ```
  sage: G = Graphs(... whatever on [0,1,2,3] ...)
  sage: G.relabel([2,0,1,3])
  ```

In the branch I updated (rebase over sage-4.6) I added a commit which do these changes. I also added a nice test which illustrate the usefulness of these additions. What do you think ?

Vincent

Hellooooo !

Well, I don't think I have anything based atop of that. Though you seem to need a 'copy' function that was added in #17047. Though I suppose that `copy` will call it.

However, it would be cool if you could indent the description of the different types for `inplace` so that it is a member of the item that begins with <code>\`\`inplace\`\` -- If \`\`True\`\` then ...</code>. 

Also, there is no `.points()` function, what we have is `ground_set`.

Short of that it's all fine, thanks !
