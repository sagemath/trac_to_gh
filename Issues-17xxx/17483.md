Using intersphinx I think you can actually get a 'real' link to the reference manual.  I'm not 100% sure how to do this effectively, I do know that we use it at least some places.

A very valuable contribution would be to turn `constructions` into something useful, or to subsume its contents in the top-level documentation for various things - e.g. in the docstrings at the start of various modules.  For that matter, a lot of the `index.rst` files could be less cryptic, note especially http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/calculus/index.html where it's not clear at all where to look for help on various things!

I couldn't figure out how to get this work easily, though.
