As reported on sage-devel, the following used to fail, since conversion of strings to function fields was not implemented.

```
sage: S.<x, y> = K[]
sage: I = S*[x^2 - y^2, y-t]
sage: I.groebner_basis()
[x^2 - t^2, y - t]
```

Would you expect something like the following to work:

```
K.<t>=FunctionField(QQ)
R.<x>=PolynomialRing(QQ)
M.<z> = K.extension(x^7-x-t);
M('z')
```

It is giving the same str error that was seen before.

Why do you think 'needs work' will be more visible? Just on the contrary, a potential reviewer will *not* look at this ticket if it wrongly says 'needs work'.

Oops. It was "needs review", so, I thought it was indeed "needs review". But if it doesn't fix the problem, then "needs work" is appropriate...

Here is what the element constructor does:

```
        if x.parent() is self._ring:
            return FunctionFieldElement_polymod(self, x)
        if isinstance(x, FunctionFieldElement):
            return FunctionFieldElement_polymod(self, self._ring(x.element()))
        return FunctionFieldElement_polymod(self, self._ring(x))
```
That's rather silly, since the last line does exactly what the first two lines do, if `x.parent() is self._ring` (then, `self._ring(x)` is supposed to return `x` unaltered). I'll try if removing the first two lines does the job.

I think a straight forward way out is to use the correct variable name for internal representation.

With the commits that I am now testing, one would get

```
sage: K.<t> = FunctionField(QQ)
sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
sage: M.<z> = K.extension(x^7-x-t)
sage: M(x)   # I guess this is important for backwards compatibility
z
sage: M('z')
z
sage: M('x')
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: unable to convert string
```
But before pushing, I need to run tests...
