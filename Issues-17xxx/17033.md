As reported on sage-devel, the following used to fail, since conversion of strings to function fields was not implemented.

```
sage: S.<x, y> = K[]
sage: I = S*[x^2 - y^2, y-t]
sage: I.groebner_basis()
[x^2 - t^2, y - t]
```

Would you expect something like the following to work:

```
K.<t>=FunctionField(QQ)
R.<x>=PolynomialRing(QQ)
M.<z> = K.extension(x^7-x-t);
M('z')
```

It is giving the same str error that was seen before.

Why do you think 'needs work' will be more visible? Just on the contrary, a potential reviewer will *not* look at this ticket if it wrongly says 'needs work'.

Oops. It was "needs review", so, I thought it was indeed "needs review". But if it doesn't fix the problem, then "needs work" is appropriate...

Here is what the element constructor does:

```
        if x.parent() is self._ring:
            return FunctionFieldElement_polymod(self, x)
        if isinstance(x, FunctionFieldElement):
            return FunctionFieldElement_polymod(self, self._ring(x.element()))
        return FunctionFieldElement_polymod(self, self._ring(x))
```
That's rather silly, since the last line does exactly what the first two lines do, if `x.parent() is self._ring` (then, `self._ring(x)` is supposed to return `x` unaltered). I'll try if removing the first two lines does the job.

Surprisingly, it does not do the job.

Or not surprisingly. After all, the element constructor is only able to coerce things that live in `self._ring`, but it is not able to deal with string representations of what it adds to `self._ring`.

I think a straight forward way out is to use the correct variable name for internal representation.

With the commits that I am now testing, one would get

```
sage: K.<t> = FunctionField(QQ)
sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
sage: M.<z> = K.extension(x^7-x-t)
sage: M(x)   # I guess this is important for backwards compatibility
z
sage: M('z')
z
sage: M('x')
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: unable to convert string
```
But before pushing, I need to run tests...
