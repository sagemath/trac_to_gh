Why do you think 'needs work' will be more visible? Just on the contrary, a potential reviewer will *not* look at this ticket if it wrongly says 'needs work'.

Oops. It was "needs review", so, I thought it was indeed "needs review". But if it doesn't fix the problem, then "needs work" is appropriate...
