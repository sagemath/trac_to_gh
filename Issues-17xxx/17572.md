On a particular OS X 10.10.1 system, building `r-3.1.2.p0` fails. I'm using git source, branch "develop". This also happens with OS X 10.10 and with Sage 6.4.beta3 and Sage 6.3. I'm using Xcode 6.1.1 and commandlinetoolsosx10.10forxcode6.1.1.

The reason is that `clang` is used to compile R packages, instead of `gcc -std=gnu99`.

Reported in sage-release group under topic "Sage 6.5.beta4 released". Logfile [attachment:r-3.1.2.p0.log] attached.

Problem also occurs on a second system with OS X 10.9.5, Xcode 6.1.1 with comand line tools, when building sage 6.5.beta5.

Can we have the config.log for R in /Users/uu1024/Git/sage/local/var/tmp/sage/build/r-3.1.2.p0/src/ ?
I don't have this problem on my own 10.10.1 machine. I note that clang is used only in some R packages and that's where a failure occurs. I don't appear to get clang anywhere in my logs.

I am not completely sure at this stage. Furthermore every R package usually has its own configure but it is all automatically erased in case of failure. Nevertheless two things come to mind
* You have a very long PATH that may contain stuff that interfere. It it difficult to be sure without doing fault isolation.
* For some reason tcl/tk is not detected while you appear to at least havehad quartz/X11 at some point.

As I said your PATh is quite long according to configure

@fbissey - 

/opt/local is where macports puts everything. But the sage build system tells me to move it aside, so that directory does not exist at all during the build. (I would love to not have to do that.)

/usr/local is for a few third party apps that want to be installed there outside of macports, including octave.

tcl is installed, but it's in macports under /opt/local so is invisible during the build

@jdemeyer - is the following relevant?
[in OS X 10.10]  'GCC' is no longer the real GNU gcc but is clang.

Of course gcc could be clang if PATH is misconfigured. But clang only explicitly appears in the log during the compilation of R packages after R is compiled.

gcc should be gnu because we always compile it on OS X so you have an install under $SAGE_LOCAL.

Yes, that's strange, `clang` does not appear in the above list. I don't know where R suddenly gets this `clang` from.

Clang first shows up in R build console output during the build of r-3.1.2.p0/src/src/library/Recommended. I'll look there a bit.

Is there a way to turn off the build of R completely? There is already a functioning R on the system.

I finally got a build of sage from source to complete on OS X 10.9.5, using a hint from this posting: https://support.enthought.com/hc/en-us/articles/204469410-OS-X-GCC-Clang-and-Cython-in-10-9-Mavericks. I checked out current sage source (version 6.7) from git://github.com/sagemath/sage.git, moved MacPorts /opt/local to /opt/local0 as usual, then ran make. After about 5 hours the make aborted on the usual error, 

ERROR: compilation failed for package 'mgcv'
...
Error installing package r-3.2.0.p0

I then did

export SAGE_KEEP_BUILT_SPKGS=yes
export CXXFLAGS="-mmacosx-version-min=10.6"
export LDFLAGS="-mmacosx-version-min=10.6"

and re-ran make. Make finished in 38 minutes and the resulting sage binary includes r-3.2.0.

I haven't tried a clean make from scratch, nor have I tested it on OS X 10.10.2 yet. The blog posting cited above also suggests compiler and linker flag of "-stdlib=libstdc++", but this was rejected by sage's gcc in both flags.

Clang only gets picked up when compiling R's own packages, which is done using R's own logic. You can trigger it by hand by unpacking the R tarball and running

```
$ sage -R CMD INSTALL R-3.2.0/src/library/Recommended/MASS.tgz 
* installing to library ‘/home/vbraun/Code/sage.git/local/lib/R/library’
* installing *source* package ‘MASS’ ...
** package ‘MASS’ successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked
** libs
gcc -std=gnu99 -I/home/vbraun/Code/sage.git/local/lib/R//include -DNDEBUG      -fpic  -g -O2   -c MASS.c -o MASS.o
gcc -std=gnu99 -I/home/vbraun/Code/sage.git/local/lib/R//include -DNDEBUG      -fpic  -g -O2   -c lqs.c -o lqs.o
gcc -std=gnu99 -shared -L/home/vbraun/Code/sage.git/local/lib/R//lib -L/home/vbraun/Code/sage.git/local/lib/ -o MASS.so MASS.o lqs.o -L/home/vbraun/Code/sage.git/local/lib/R//lib -lR
installing to /home/vbraun/Code/sage.git/local/lib/R/library/MASS/libs
** R
** data
*** moving datasets to lazyload DB
** inst
** byte-compile and prepare package for lazy loading
** help
*** installing help indices
** building package indices
** testing if installed package can be loaded
* DONE (MASS)
``` 
The CFLAGS/CXXFLAGS should be equivalent to 

```
$ MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.6 sage -R CMD INSTALL R-3.2.0/src/library/Recommended/MASS.tgz
```
maybe you can give this a try?

Thank you. Makevars might be the whole problem.

Both Macs have ~/.R/Makevars with
CC=clang
CXX=clang++
Timestamps are Oct 4 2014 on the OS X 10.9 system and Oct 1 2014 on the OS X 10.10 system, around the time I first noticed builds failing at the r package. I don't recall setting that file manually, but was trying several ways of building R at the time.

I moved aside ~/.R/Makevars, the R package, and its install marker file, unset CXXFLAGS and LDFLAGS, and ran make at the top level of sage git repo. The build ran (starting with r) to completion. Will try a full build next. Those take 6-8 hours.

P.S.: I tried unpacking R and building MASS as you suggested. MASS built and seemed to install successfully, but the build used clang as a compiler, both before and after I moved aside ~/.R/Makevars

Another + review. Commit ​bb5c9f3 builds successfully on OS X 10.10.1 with ~/.R/Makevars in place with contents:
CC=clang

Should the milestone for this ticket be changed from 6.5 to 6.8? What is that trac field used for?

Thank you.
