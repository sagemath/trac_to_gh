On a particular OS X 10.10.1 system, building `r-3.1.2.p0` fails. I'm using git source, branch "develop". This also happens with OS X 10.10 and with Sage 6.4.beta3 and Sage 6.3. I'm using Xcode 6.1.1 and commandlinetoolsosx10.10forxcode6.1.1.

The reason is that `clang` is used to compile R packages, instead of `gcc -std=gnu99`.

Reported in sage-release group under topic "Sage 6.5.beta4 released". Logfile [attachment:r-3.1.2.p0.log] attached.

Problem also occurs on a second system with OS X 10.9.5, Xcode 6.1.1 with comand line tools, when building sage 6.5.beta5.

Can we have the config.log for R in /Users/uu1024/Git/sage/local/var/tmp/sage/build/r-3.1.2.p0/src/ ?
I don't have this problem on my own 10.10.1 machine. I note that clang is used only in some R packages and that's where a failure occurs. I don't appear to get clang anywhere in my logs.

As I said your PATh is quite long according to configure

<a id='comment:6'></a>`@`fbissey - 

/opt/local is where macports puts everything. But the sage build system tells me to move it aside, so that directory does not exist at all during the build. (I would love to not have to do that.)

/usr/local is for a few third party apps that want to be installed there outside of macports, including octave.

tcl is installed, but it's in macports under /opt/local so is invisible during the build

`@`jdemeyer - is the following relevant?
[in OS X 10.10]  'GCC' is no longer the real GNU gcc but is clang.

Of course gcc could be clang if PATH is misconfigured. But clang only explicitly appears in the log during the compilation of R packages after R is compiled.

gcc should be gnu because we always compile it on OS X so you have an install under $SAGE_LOCAL.

Yes, that's strange, `clang` does not appear in the above list. I don't know where R suddenly gets this `clang` from.

Clang first shows up in R build console output during the build of r-3.1.2.p0/src/src/library/Recommended. I'll look there a bit.

Is there a way to turn off the build of R completely? There is already a functioning R on the system.

No. On most platforms it doesn't make sense and it would be difficult because sage includes rpy. Using system wide R leads to a library jungle between the system and sage that is probably unhealthy.

Did you find a Makeconf for the R that sage is building?

``` 
The CFLAGS/CXXFLAGS should be equivalent to 

```
$ MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.6 sage -R CMD INSTALL R-3.2.0/src/library/Recommended/MASS.tgz
```
maybe you can give this a try?

<a id='comment:29'></a>Thank you. Makevars might be the whole problem.

Both Macs have ~/.R/Makevars with
CC=clang
CXX=clang++

P.S.: I tried unpacking R and building MASS as you suggested. MASS built and seemed to install successfully, but the build used clang as a compiler, both before and after I moved aside ~/.R/Makevars
