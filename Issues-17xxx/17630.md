```
Different pkgs find ATLAS (or equivalent libs e.g. on OS X and Cygwin) libs in different ways.
In particular the situation is broken on Cygwin.

The one we tweak ourselves are:
* ATLAS when we pass SAGE_ATLAS_LIB to decide what to copy/symlink
* fflas-ffpack
* iml
* R
* the Sage library through SAGE_BLAS and module_list.py and its BLAS/BLAS2 madness
The ones we hack ourselves:
* cvxopt (we patch and hardcode in setup.py).
Other pkgs depend on a BLAS implem but are autonomous(?):
* gsl,
* scipy (envvars are unset...),
* numpy (same same as scipy).

My proposal before a pkgconfig solution gets available at #17075 is that when ATLAS spkg-install script is run it decides what should be used once and for all and other packages use this information (like used to be done a little bit when the linbox spkg-install script wrote `echo $LINBOX_BLAS > $SAGE_LOCAL/share/cblas_config`)

gsl makes its own cblas (but no fortran blas) and by default libgsl is not linked with any cblas, you are supposed to link with a cblas when you use the library.
Setting blas/lapack in numpy/scipy makes me crazy half the time. Environment variable or setup.cfg can be used to change the default (currently looking for MKL, ATLAS, netlib and netlib source in that order if I am not mistaken).
Making a setup.cfg from pkg-config is hard

```
pc_incdir() {
	$(tc-getPKG_CONFIG) --cflags-only-I $@ | \
		sed -e 's/^-I//' -e 's/[ ]*-I/:/g' -e 's/[ ]*$//' -e 's|^:||'
}

pc_libdir() {
	$(tc-getPKG_CONFIG) --libs-only-L $@ | \
		sed -e 's/^-L//' -e 's/[ ]*-L/:/g' -e 's/[ ]*$//' -e 's|^:||'
}

pc_libs() {
	$(tc-getPKG_CONFIG) --libs-only-l $@ | \
		sed -e 's/[ ]-l*\(pthread\|m\)\([ ]\|$\)//g' \
		-e 's/^-l//' -e 's/[ ]*-l/,/g' -e 's/[ ]*$//' \
		| tr ',' '\n' | sort -u | tr '\n' ',' | sed -e 's|,$||'
}

		local libdir="${EPREFIX}"/usr/$(get_libdir) # local tree
		# make sure _dotblas.so gets built
		sed -i -e '/NO_ATLAS_INFO/,+1d' numpy/core/setup.py || die
		cat >> site.cfg <<-EOF
			[blas]
			include_dirs = $(pc_incdir cblas)
			library_dirs = $(pc_libdir cblas blas):${libdir}
			blas_libs = $(pc_libs cblas blas)
			[lapack]
			library_dirs = $(pc_libdir lapack):${libdir}
			lapack_libs = $(pc_libs lapack)

```
 but with the python binding it should be easier.

This is definitely not really needs_reviex, in particular, OS X surely needs further tweaking, not sure that passing `-lblas` or `lcblas` would always work, or if one sometines needs to pass the `-framework` stuff...
I've basically tested it on Linux and Cygwin and it looks ok.

Anyway, I won't be able to do anything for at leasr one month, so here is the current state of affair.
Feel free to finalize and merge it!

In linbox itself it is not used.
I don't remember about the fflas-ffpack part...

It might enhance performance, I did not check.
I only know for sure that fflas-ffpack can be configure to (potentially) use LAPACK.
If you don't feel safe with this, we can postpone such an inclusion and deal with it in #14390.

Yes: #17635 and friends.
Note we'll have to wait for a fflas-ffpack 2.1 release and linbox x.y release as the current versions of the three libs are not compatible.
They should have come out in march, but didn't and ClÃ©ment did not answer my latest mail.

I think it will be better to rebase on top of #18450 I will have to rebase the corresponding sage-on-gentoo patch anyway and it will be less patching in the end.

Just so I am sure I understand correctly:

```
# distutils: libraries = gmp pari
```
for example will add "-lgmp -lpari" to the linking line (possibly not in that order since it could break)? Is it possible to read the correct library or import from another file? I am asking because our forward thinking is to move the definition of the blas/lapack stuff to `.pc` files and be able to choose between several implementations that won't all have the same name.

Yes indeed.

> possibly not in that order since it could break

There is a global order `library_order_list` defined in `src/module_list.py`. Libraries are sorted according to that order, so the order given in the `# distutils` declaration is not relevant (unless the library is *not* listed in `library_order_list`).

> Is it possible to read the correct library or import from another file?

Yes, see the `aliases` variable in `src/module_list.py`

Just define whatever you need in that variable and then use the alias name in the `# distutils` declaration.

Perhaps those libraries are needed for some reason (I know Linux in particular is very flexible with defining libraries) but it's something to be investigated...

And this

```
f = open(os.path.join(SAGE_LOCAL, 'share/cblas_config'), 'r')

Because this does not do the same thing :).
IIRC the first option exports `LDFLAGS = ""` when LDFLAGS is not set.
Or something in this spirit.
This can cause trouble later on (and I thing I was hit by that).

Whatsoever IIRC once again, the "new" treatment for LDFLAGS is similar to the one for CFLAGS and CPPFLAGS.

In both case the variable is only defined on cygwin/darwin and we rely on autodetection in other cases. I guess we could throw the autodetection throw the window and put the stuff in every case.

That's a fair comment we touched things all over the place and some more will need to be "aligned" eventually.

I am a bit concerned that there is even a need for these tests and setting/unsetting. It just feel wrong so I am probably not the best person to pass a judgement on that particular change, my own reaction is to make the whole thing disappear.

I will check the indent ASAP and I was afraid you would ask for that doctest, but I know what to do.

`@`Jean-Pierre, any comments on the last few commits? As can be surmised by comments we'll eventually touch again some packages using `blas/cblas/lapack` to enforce settings in the future. But as Jeroen says there is enough here already.

My only point is that now `LDFLAGS` just follows what `CFLAGS` does and gave me a better behavior.
So I don't agree that we've always treated LDFLAGS and CFLAGS (and CXXFLAGS) in the same way when they are unset and empty.

The problem with the current behavior of  LDFLAGS, is that if `LDFLAGS` is not set, then whe get `LDFLAGS=""`.
And some packages won't touch LDFLAGS if `LFDLAGS=""`.
If you feel worried about this, then just remove this change.

For the current behavior of CFLAGS, what you get is that if CFLAGS is empty, then it's unset, that might not be the best behavior as well...

Yeah I generally agree with going step by step even if the current solution is not perfect.

I also spotted a few indentation issues in `atlas/spkg-install` and `src/sage/env.py`

The treating of `{C,CXX}FLAGS` changed recently in #16149 and I don't understand why that change was needed.

Personally, I would prefer to not treat empty and non-empty `FOOFLAGS` fundamentally different (i.e. I would revert #16149 and leave `LDFLAGS` as they are).

Having `*FLAGS` empty or unset are two different things.
Maybe it should be the same, but some libraries deal with it differently.
E.g. when it's unset it means do whatever you want with `*FLAGS` and if it is empty, it means leave it empty.
Of course, this is not a universal truth and different libraries behaves differently.
So as far as I'm concerned, I would just not touch `*FLAGS` at all.

I just got an idea: why aren't we using a `pkgconfig` file instead of `local/share/blas_config`? I seems like `pkgconfig` is exactly meant to solve the problems we're having on this ticket.

A typical file looks like

```
$ cat local/lib/pkgconfig/m4ri.pc 
SAGE_ROOT=/usr/local/src/sage-config
prefix=${SAGE_ROOT}/local
exec_prefix=${prefix}
libdir=${SAGE_ROOT}/local/lib
includedir=${prefix}/include

Name: M4RI
Description: Dense linear algebra over GF(2).
Version: 20140914
Libs: -L${libdir} -lm4ri -lm
Cflags: -I${includedir}/m4ri  -I${SAGE_ROOT}/local/include -g -fPIC -Wall -pedantic -O2  -mmmx -msse -msse2 -msse3 
```

I am sure we can make a `blas.pc` file using this format.

From the shell, you can do for example

```
(sage-sh) $ pkgconf --libs m4ri
-lm4ri -lm  
```
which would replace the ugly `sed` script.

There is also a Python interface:

```
sage: import pkgconfig
sage: pkgconfig.libs("m4ri")
u'-L/usr/local/src/sage-config/local/lib -lm4ri -lm'
```

I wouldn't it definitely looks wrong on non-OS Xes :)
Read the comment above this part of code.
If `LDFLAGS` is set, you need to add `-shared` yourself.
This is exactly what is done here.
And yes you are right, this must be the reason for my changes to `sage-env`, as if `LDFLAGS` is set but empty, then `shared` won't be added and the compilation will fail.
The easy solution is to unconditionnally add `-shared` to `LDFLAGS` on non-OS X.

As far as OS X is concerned, I guess I got this from "the web" as I don't have access to any OS X machine and cried for testing here before.

In fact the OS X stuff comes from the previous scipy `spkg-install`.

If think that my idea to test whether `LDFLAGS` is set and only modify it if it is not (differently on OS X and non-OS Xes), is that if `LDFLAGS` is set then the user did it and knows what he did and will know how to fix it if compilation fails.
