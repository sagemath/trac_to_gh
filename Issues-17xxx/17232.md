With this branch the following is done:

1) The "copy" boolean flag is removed from the methods of `IncidenceStructure` where it was useless, i.e. all except the constructors. This was always a "don't change unless you know what you do" flag, and persons who know what they do might as well access the internal data structure immediately, i.e. without function call.

2) The file `steiner_quadruple_systems` did not use `IncidenceStructure` at all, and this is now fixed. There was also a function `is_steiner_quadruple_system` which was a specific case of `IncidenceStructure.is_t_design`. Now, all those functions take `IncidenceStructure` as input and return `IncidenceStructure` objects. In particular:

  Before

  ```
  sage: designs.steiner_quadruple_system(20)
  ((0, 1, 2, 9),
   (0, 1, 12, 19),
   (0, 11, 2, 19),
  ...
  ```
  After

  ```
  sage: designs.steiner_quadruple_system(20)
  Incidence structure with 20 points and 285 blocks
  ```

Hello Nathann,

I updated a branch at `u/vdelecroix/17232` which:
- removes `is_steiner_quadruple_system`
- copy the output in the method `ground_set` (you made as default to **not** copy the list).
- change output of `_SQS14` and `_SQS38` to be lists and use a `copy=False` in `steiner_quadruple_systems` for the corresponding parameters.

Do you like it?

Vincent
