If i understand the motivation in having this ticket separate from #17288, sagenb development has not much energy. So, if sagenb developpers agree with this ticket, then it can be accepted without the need to release a new version of sagenb (and the removing part of spkg-install can be removed later once mathjax is removed from sagenb tarball during a following release). I just wanted to avoid this ticket to impose some additional work on the sagenb side.

Replying to [@kcrisman](#comment%3A10):
> Ah, interesting.  Do you think that it should be sourced?  As long as those variables then change (and after a build are vanquished) that could be useful.

No, if we want some variable to be available in the `spkg-install` script i would use `export USEFUL_VARIABLE` before calling the `spkg-install` script (by the way, note that some `spkg-install` scripts are written in Python and can not be sourced within a bash script). I do not know how much those variables are needed though.
