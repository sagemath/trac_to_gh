This branch extends a previous case that only worked for three holes of size 1.

The algorithm is greedy but the implementation is a bit painful `:-/`

Hello Nathann,

It seems to work but we do have very few examples of `OA(k,n) - OA(k,u)`, right?

```
sage: for n in range(2,1000):
....:     if designs.incomplete_orthogonal_array(4,n,[2],existence=True):
....:         print n
9
```

Hello !

Sorry for this 'x': actually, I already fixed that in this ticket's dependency #17149 (it is closed but not yet in a beta)

> It seems to work but we do have very few examples of `OA(k,n) - OA(k,u)`, right?

> ```


With this code you only test `OA(k,n)-OA(k,2)`. Try this:

```
sage: for i in range(2,1000):
....:     for j in range(2,i):
....:         if designs.incomplete_orthogonal_array(4,i,[j],existence=True):
....:             print "OA({},{})-OA({},{})".format(4,i,4,j)
....:             
OA(4,9)-OA(4,2)
OA(4,16)-OA(4,3)
OA(4,17)-OA(4,4)
OA(4,25)-OA(4,6)
OA(4,26)-OA(4,5)
OA(4,30)-OA(4,5)
OA(4,36)-OA(4,5)
OA(4,36)-OA(4,7)
OA(4,37)-OA(4,6)
OA(4,41)-OA(4,10)
OA(4,42)-OA(4,7)
...
```

If you have a hole of size 3 in an OA, you do not necessarily have a hole of size 2. It's not a `-2.OA(k,1)`, it's a `-OA(k,2)`!
