Adds three functions: `is_isomorphic`, `canonical_label`, and `copy` (I needed that).

shouldn't you do `g=Graph(data_structure="static_sparse")` rather than the default `Graph`?

Either way I don't think that this code should do that. If the isomorphism code is faster with static graphs, then it should do a copy itself.

Creating a static graph is the same as creating it with the 'normal' data structure then copying it into a static version anyway.
