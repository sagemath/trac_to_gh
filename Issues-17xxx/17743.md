I have observed it on my installation with a separate worker account. After `make distclean` and recompiling I still see this, while on a local machine everything works fine.

Can someone test it with multiple accounts?

But every new distro defaults to private home directories, and you have to guess from a rather obscure error message that this is the issue.
