I have observed it on my installation with a separate worker account. After `make distclean` and recompiling I still see this, while on a local machine everything works fine.

Can someone test it with multiple accounts?

There are a number of other permission issues, e.g. by default `server_pool` doesn't work on my machine because my home directory is 0x700 so the worker can't start my Sage installation.

IMHO its a stupid design to send data back in temp files, the results should be serialized properly and sent though a pipe or socket. See also: Make Sage usable as a library (https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/87Rlenvcfrs/-vOyTkZ_FGYJ)

But every new distro defaults to private home directories, and you have to guess from a rather obscure error message that this is the issue.
