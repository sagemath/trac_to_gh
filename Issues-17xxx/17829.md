I used to make a bdist by typing "./sage -bdist VER", which is still how it's documented. But in fact, that line ends up calling the sage-bdist script, whose argument isn't a version, but the name of a temporary directory!

The two scripts don't agree with one another ; I'll propose a patch when I find the time.
