Singular has an issue of overlapping namespaces
where variable conflicts will lead to bugs without warnings:

```
//Singular code:
ring rng = 0, p ,dp;
poly p = p^2 - p - 1;  // **boom**
p;  // (   p = -1,  wrong !  )
```


In combination with hardcoded variable names or unreflected usage of
'execute' in Singular's library code this may lead to wrong results as shown in 

http://www.singular.uni-kl.de:8002/trac/ticket/677.

Trying to translate the example from http://www.singular.uni-kl.de:8002/trac/ticket/677 to sage
I hit another bug (#17720)
