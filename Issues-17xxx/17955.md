Currently, `LaurentSeriesRing` caches without replacing the default `default_prec=None` to the global series precision obtainable by `sage.default.series_precision()` . This leads to the following behavior:

```
sage: set_series_precision(5)
sage: R.<x> = LaurentSeriesRing(ZZ)
sage: 1/(1-x)
1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + x^4 + O(x^5)
sage: set_series_precision(3)
sage: R.<x> = LaurentSeriesRing(ZZ)
sage: 1/(1-x)
1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + x^4 + O(x^5)
```
Instead, the (second) output should be

```
sage: 1/(1-x)
1 + x + x^2 + O(x^3)
```

This is fixed by setting `default_prec` to the corresponding global series precision *before* caching the parent.

Keywords: series_precision, asymptotics
