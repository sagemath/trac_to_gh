In #15820, `biseq_t` is used to model bounded sequence of integers. We should provide a way to use it in `sage.combinat.words` and see whether other datastructures are actually needed.

In the same time, we should think about moving low level functions on words to `sage.data_structure.bounded_integer_sequences`.
