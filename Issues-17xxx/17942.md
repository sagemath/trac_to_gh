In a browser-based notebook an object's `save()` method should automatically download the saved file and not just let it linger on the remote server.

I'm proposing to do this by returning, from `save()`, a `SavedFile` object instead of nothing. The `SavedFile._rich_repr_` method then returns a custom rich representation which gives browser-based display backends a hook to do something with the saved file. Also, nothing happens if you call save() from within code---only if it hits the displayhook:

```
sage: my_plot.save()        # yes, download
sage: _ = my_plot.save()    # no automatic download
sage: for i in range(10):
....:     my_plot.save()    # depends
sage: for i in range(10):
....:     my_plot.save()    # no
....:     x = x + i
```

The `SavedFile` object could itself have a `show()` method, which may or may not show the file (depending on the display backend capabilities and the saved file):

```
sage: my_plot.save(**complicated_options).show()
The Foo Notebook cannot display $complicated_graphics_format
```

Replying to [ticket:17942 vbraun]:
> In a browser-based notebook an object's `save()` method should automatically download the saved file

I'm not sure that I agree with this. You might want to `save()` the object on the server to `load()` it in some Sage session later.

If you want download functionality, I would prefer to use a new `.download()` method for that.

Just to clarify, save() should of course still save the file on the remote file system. It just should **in addition** get the file to the client.

Tying it to the displayhook already gives you a means to control whether or not the file is downloaded. Also, if you really just save a temporary file on the server you are more likely to do that form within code so it wouldn't be downloaded anyway. There could be other switches, maybe `foo.save(download=False)` or `%download [on|off]`. But just `foo.save()` should by default do something sensible. If you don't like the default you can then look into the docs. But if you only notice that `save()` doesn't result in a file on your laptop then the user is going to assume that this is the way it is.

With cloud applications (let's consider sagenb as such an application), "save" usually means "save on the remote system". The notebook interface has "Save" and "Save & quit" buttons, neither of these result in a downloaded file.

This looks pretty robust.  Should we expect any other `.save()` methods to implement this `SavedFile` type?  Such as the usual `.sobj` saving... I assume not, but just checking.

Also, this doesn't appear to require any changes in sagenb; I ask because I'm looking at that right now, but I don't see anything that does.

I don't really have an opinion either way; We could.
