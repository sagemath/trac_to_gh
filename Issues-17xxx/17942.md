In a browser-based notebook an object's `save()` method should automatically download the saved file and not just let it linger on the remote server.

I'm proposing to do this by returning, from `save()`, a `SavedFile` object instead of nothing. The `SavedFile._rich_repr_` method then returns a custom rich representation which gives browser-based display backends a hook to do something with the saved file. Also, nothing happens if you call save() from within code---only if it hits the displayhook:

```
sage: my_plot.save()        # yes, download
sage: _ = my_plot.save()    # no automatic download
sage: for i in range(10):
....:     my_plot.save()    # depends
sage: for i in range(10):
....:     my_plot.save()    # no
....:     x = x + i
```

The `SavedFile` object could itself have a `show()` method, which may or may not show the file (depending on the display backend capabilities and the saved file):

```
sage: my_plot.save(**complicated_options).show()
The Foo Notebook cannot display $complicated_graphics_format

> In a browser-based notebook an object's `save()` method should automatically download the saved file

I'm not sure that I agree with this. You might want to `save()` the object on the server to `load()` it in some Sage session later.

If you want download functionality, I would prefer to use a new `.download()` method for that.

Just to clarify, save() should of course still save the file on the remote file system. It just should **in addition** get the file to the client.

Tying it to the displayhook already gives you a means to control whether or not the file is downloaded. Also, if you really just save a temporary file on the server you are more likely to do that form within code so it wouldn't be downloaded anyway. There could be other switches, maybe `foo.save(download=False)` or `%download [on|off]`. But just `foo.save()` should by default do something sensible. If you don't like the default you can then look into the docs. But if you only notice that `save()` doesn't result in a file on your laptop then the user is going to assume that this is the way it is.

This looks pretty robust.  Should we expect any other `.save()` methods to implement this `SavedFile` type?  Such as the usual `.sobj` saving... I assume not, but just checking.

Also, this doesn't appear to require any changes in sagenb; I ask because I'm looking at that right now, but I don't see anything that does.

I don't really have an opinion either way; We could.

No changes to SageNB required.
