CC:  @slel @williamstein @dimpase

In the ["install from source code" documentation](http://sagemath.org/doc/installation/source.html), there are some sections on how to build Sage with SSL support, some of it in relation to the removed sagenb. 

Since sage 9.3, openssl is a normal standard package.

We remove the outdated and confusing info.
