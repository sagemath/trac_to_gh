2.0.x is not supported anymore upstream.

The Sage scripts also need a lot of cleanup.

As far as Cygwin is concerned, we still need to:
* autoreconf so that libtool gets recent enough to correctly link on Cygwin64 (to be able to use recent autotools see https://bitbucket.org/libgd/gd-libgd/diff/configure.ac?diff2=10ffb330807d&at=master)
* patch not to use ceill but only ceil in src/gd_bmp.c as Cygwin's (and some other systems) libm does not provide it (see https://bitbucket.org/libgd/gd-libgd/issue/98/gd_bmpc-use-of-both-ceil-and-ceill)

Autoreconfed tarball at:
* http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jpflori/upstream/libgd-2.1.0.tar.bz2
