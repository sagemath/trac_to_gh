Currently, `QuotientRing_generic` has no method `random_element()`, thus the one of the class `Ring` is used, and only integers coerced into the `QuotientRing` are returned. 

I add such a method, mostly copied from the class `PolynomialQuotientRing_generic`.

Is the cover ring necessarily a polynomial ring, as the docstring suggests?
