With this, the explanations about latex formatting are a bit clearer, and we finally have a section that says what doctests should test. I may not have thought of everything.

Re your change in the `LaTeX Typesetting` section from

```
In ReST documentation, you use backticks \` to mark LaTeX code to be
typeset. In Sage docstrings, you may also use dollar signs instead.
```
to

```
In ReST documentation LaTeX code is allowed, and is marked with **backticks or
dollar signs**:
```
This is not entirely accurate: in ReST documentation, you can't use dollar signs; those are only available in Sage's documentation. Maybe say "In Sage's ReST documentation ..."?

I would also point out that `$$math expression$$` is old-fashioned and deprecated in LaTeX; `\[math expression]\]$` is much preferred. 

Why remove the instructions about `:nowrap:`? Is the warning about it no longer accurate?

Hello John !

First, let me say that I have absolutely nothing against seeing this patch reviewed very soon, but it has a dependency that must be reviewed first otherwise we are sure to have conflict between the two of them. So if you have some time to review a doc ticket, could you start with #17589 ? It is very short !

> This is not entirely accurate: in ReST documentation, you can't use dollar signs; those are only available in Sage's documentation. Maybe say "In Sage's ReST documentation ..."?


I see. We may also not mention those dollar signs as we try always use backticks anyway nowadays ?...

> I would also point out that `$$math expression$$` is old-fashioned and deprecated in LaTeX; `\[math expression]\]$` is much preferred. 


I never used that, but I can make the change. To me all about LaTeX is old-fashioned and deprecated. This thing cannot detect a syntax error properly.

> Why remove the instructions about `:nowrap:`? Is the warning about it no longer accurate?


It just does not seem to work. I first wanted to add an illustration of this nowrap as I did for the examples above, and it had no effect. Then I looked for ":nowrap:" in Sage's source code and found out that it was used only once.... and that it had no effect either.

How should it be documented, though ? "Makes no difference in the html doc but one example of our doc would not compile otherwise" ? `:-/`

Hello John !

No problem for your first modification. As for the second, I had dropped on purpose the explanation about 'wrapping' as it made no sense that it applied only to pdf and not to html. ALso, I did not want to go in such depth about something which is very very very marginally useful to us (one instance in all of Sage's code!) and really seems to be a bug more than anything else. What would you think of only keeping your second sentence ? Something like:

```diff
+ When building the PDF documentation, a LaTeX environment 
+ which should not appear in math mode (e.g. ``align``) may
+ become a problem. In order to use them, you will have to 
+ add a `:nowrap:` flag::
```

While I prefer a short sentence like that, I will be okay with whatever you decide on this respect. My only aim is to make it easy to read and to use, and I often worry about not dragging people into reading things that are of no interest to them (which explains the bold words I add everywhere).

If you can take the time to do a full review of this branch this will probably make my life easier; fixing everything at once is much less work.

Thanks,

Nathann

It was a 'or', but sentence was a bit unclear so I rephrased it.
