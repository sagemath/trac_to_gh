Are we doing stages? First install a pc file for atlas (and OS X make it point to accelerate) and convert to that? Then work out how we replace ATLAS. Or do you plan to switch hard to something like openblas straight away?

My current patch for module_list.py and misc/cython.py live here https://github.com/cschwan/sage-on-gentoo/blob/master/sci-mathematics/sage/files/sage-6.4-blas.patch I considered that we basically needed two things:
* the library to be linked (c)blas_lib
* the folder containing the libraries (c)blas_dir
I probably need to harmonise between the two files.

We could also want a cblas_inc for headers but that is probably not necessary.

I don't want to do too much at once. For now ATLAS should stay the default. Though this ticket should work with at least one other BLAS implementation ;-)

There is no guarantee that all cblas libraries are in the same directory. What do you need `cblas_dir` for that can't be done with `pkgconfig --libs`?

*yes* so the file is created by the fflas-ffpack spkg for consumption in linbox. fflas-ffpack provides a fflas-ffpack-config which you would think would help...

```
(sage-sh) fbissey@QCD-nzi3:sage-6.3.beta7$ fflas-ffpack-config --blas-libs  
-L/home/work/fbissey/sandbox/sage-6.3.beta7/local/lib -lcblas -latlas -L/home/work/fbissey/sandbox/sage-6.3.beta7/local/lib -llapack
```

Note that we don't link anything in the sage library to lapack - it is not in module_list.py. So anything using lapack in linboxsage is well contained.

with or without these lines and we have

-I/Users/fbissey/build/sage-6.2.beta5/local/include -D__FFLASFFPACK_HAVE_CBLAS
```
At this stage there may be something to do to fflas-ffpack.

I see I had restored linbox to its original state. If I remove the two lines reading cblas_config. blas disapear from liblinbox.dylib. I guess if there was --as-needed option for OS X we could check that it is indeed not needed for liblinbox. I checked the Makefile.am for liblinbox and liblinboxsage and it is clearly the intent that only the sage interface depends on blas.

So for linbox I think we should make a small change in fflas-ffpack for OS X, remove the cblas_config file and update the linbox spkg accordingly.

I can import the sage-on-gentoo bits for sage quite easily (depends if we want to keep the `library_dir` bits which enable blas in odd location or not). To some extent that would be testable immediately. The various packages would probably need to be staged carefully. I am especially concerned by the python package - numpy and scipy in particular.

I think in the end we want to allow users to use strange BLAS implems in strange places.

And for the numpy and scipy bits, can we work on top of what was done at #17630?

As Volker, I propose to merge this ticket asap and work on using the produced pc files for our spkg in follow up tickets and maybe make #17630 a task to be closed when everything is ported.

By increasing the chances of somebody reviewing this ticket if they can actually see that it works.

The goal of Sage tickets is not just to write code, but to get it reviewed. A ticket without a working use-case is hard to test and therefore hard to review.

Well, I have commented in a related ticket that I had been somewhat demotivated to work on this. I think most stuff has to be thrown away or re-based. Jeroen was working on an ATLAS upgrade more recently because of power8.

But really the plan is to get something like the functionality I have now in sage-on-gentoo: 
* you can use one of many blas/lapack
* Each blas/lapack install some .pc file
* we use the .pc file to find the libraries and headers needed
 

So the first step is get ATLAS to install .pc files, then migrate spkg to use them including the sage library. Then we can start writing alternative blas/lapack spkg.

Right, but there are issues with the new ATLAS...

In any case, that upgrade does not involve the build system, so it's independent of this ticket here.
