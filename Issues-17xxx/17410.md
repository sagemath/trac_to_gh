}
```
A doctest or longest_path() is ambiguous :

```
sage: l = [(0, 1), (0, 3), (2, 0)]
sage: G = DiGraph(l)
sage: G.longest_path().edges()
[(0, 3, None), (2, 0, None)]
```

Starting with sage 6.5beta1, sage gives the equally valid answer 

```
[(0, 1, None), (2, 0, None)]
```
but this is detected as a failure by sage ptestlong.

So let's use a problem with a unique solution.

Hello,

Are you sure that it is unique ? Why the output can not be the same path in the other direction

```
[(3, 4, None), (2, 0, None), (0, 3, None)]
```
EDIT: it is not even sure that the list of edges is output in any sorted way, is it ?

You can at least test the length, or the vertices/edges as a set.

Damn. You're right. The path is unique (G is directed). But edges() has no special reason to sort them in any specified way. So the new version tests only set equality.

This passes "make ptestlong".

And you're co-author.

Hi Emmanuel,

I changed my status from author to reviewer. That's more reasonable.

why `bool(something)` instead of `something` like in

```
sage: p = G.longest_path()
sage: set(p.edges(labels=False)) == {(0,3), (2,0), (3,4)}
True
```
(and by the way, the option `labels=False` of the method `.edges` is really cool)

Sorry for being so picky.

Vincent
