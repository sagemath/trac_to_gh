The _boundary attribute has been deprecated since Sage 6.3 in #15494. This
ticket totally removes it fro the graph class.

The branch fixes a small problem that went probably unnoticed in #15494: the
function Graph.genus was using this attribute (and so has been raising warnings
for one year) but there was no other way to give a list of vertices to the
function. Consequently, this branch turns one of its boolean arguments into a
list, so that this function can be used properly, i.e. without global variables.

I think the "one year" rule should be interpreted since a stable Sage release, not just since the opening of the ticket. The idea is to give users a one year warning that whatever they are using is deprecated.

It's very unreasonable to expect users to read all trac tickets for deprecations.

You take into account the 'first stable release' as the first date on which the deprecation appears, and you add a message here saying that 'no beta release' should be made that contains this branch. Stable on one hand, beta on the other, and all for nothing.

Anyway. Not even worth fighting for, it is just unpleasant and pointless.

Hello,

I did small modifications, but I'm not good for pushing commits and so all is in a new branch. Sorry for that.

I did only the following modifications:
- in both files `graph.py` and `digraph.py`, remove in the description of the class parameters

```
    -  ``boundary`` - a list of boundary vertices, if
       empty, digraph is considered as a 'graph without boundary'
```
