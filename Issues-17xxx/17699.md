We have been assuming `bash` for a very long time. Removing bashisms would require replacing those scripts by more complicated code, giving more chances of breakage.

And if you stop assuming `bash` as shell, you have to test that things works on all shells. Again giving more chances of breakage.

Proposal: close as "wontfix".

> Python is a requirement. Sooner or later Sage won't build without Python

so the shell scripts could be replaced by python scripts as it is done in #15642.
