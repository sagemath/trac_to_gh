(this was split off from #71)

To show tracebacks from Cython code, we need to:
1) add `SAGE_SRC` to `sys.path` since Cython uses relative paths in its tracebacks
2) add a patch to IPython to not replace the `.pyx` file with the `.so` file: [https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/7112](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/7112) (accepted by upstream)

Branch/Commit: d595f76abd176a18e7b9271db857853d7ce31675

Upstream: Fixed upstream, but not in a stable release.

Reviewer: Travis Scrimshaw

Author: Jeroen Demeyer

Resolution: fixed
