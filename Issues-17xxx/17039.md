I don't get your point. I am saying that you can replace

```
if 'bracket' not in kwds:
    kwds['bracket'] = False
```
by

```
kwds.setdefault('bracket', False)
```
You can do the same for `string_quotes` but I'm not saying that you must do this for *every* keyword if you don't want.

I misread `setdefault`. I was thinking it made the `dict` behave like a `defaultdict`. I agree that this is a better way to go.
