As reported in [ask.sagemath.org](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/25970/) we have

```
sage: f = exp(-x) / (2 + sin(x))
sage: f.limit(x=+infinity)
und
```
but it is clearly defined. And sympy gives the expected answer

```
sage: import sympy
sage: sympy.limit(f,x,+oo)
0
```

<div id="comment:4" align="right">comment:4</div>

here is another example of wrong limit (thanks Manuel Eberl, here with Sage 8.2):

```
sage: f=log(log(x + e^(log(x)*log(log(x)))))/log(log(log(x + e^x + log(x))))
sage: f.limit(x=+infinity)
0
```
The correct answer is 1. See https://sourceforge.net/p/maxima/bugs/3393/
