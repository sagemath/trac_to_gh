We have currently

```
sage: M = matrix([[-1]])
sage: abs(M)
-1
```
Because `matrix.__abs__` is a shortcut for determinant!!I

n scipy, `__abs__` applies the absolute value to each coefficient. But it is not likely what we want to do in Sage. Instead we raise a `TypeError` and inform the user about `matrix.norm(1)` and `matrix.apply_map(abs)`.

Crazy `O_o`

I will run the tests and see if it breaks anything.

Why do you make "abs" an alias for `__abs__` ? If you believe that it is worth adding a function (given that `abs(M)` works I do not understand why it would be), can you make it `.absolute_value` ? We try to not have full names for methods.

Passes all tests, so positive review.

Do you know of a tool to detect that you only "moved" the code of those two big functions ?

I found no way to do this, so in order to check your patch I moved what you wrote in matrix2 back to matrix_dense, only to see as it was detected as "leaving those function as they were" when merged with your patch.
