sage: from sympy import sympify
sage: sympify(heaviside(x))
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
NotImplementedError: SymPy function 'heaviside' doesn't exist
sage: sympify(elliptic_kc(x))
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
NotImplementedError: SymPy function 'elliptic_kc' doesn't exist
```
Both have equivalents in SymPy.
