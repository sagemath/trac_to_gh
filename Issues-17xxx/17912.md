Keywords: modular forms hecke triangle groups

It's worthwhile to cleanup/refactor from time to time.
This is the aim of this ticket (for modform_hecketriangle).
Before doing so the two tickets #17261, #17909 should be considered/included.

Cleanup / improvements:
- Think about how original/new modular forms implementation is loaded
- Move hecke_triangle* to sage.groups.matrix_gps
- Remove everything from the __init__ and use the mechanism of the all.py
  - groups.matrix.HeckeTriangle(5) should work
- Create a thematic tutorial from readme.py
- Use native comparison in number fields once it is available
- Improve documentation
  - improve introductions in general
  - Clarify the meaning of min_exp
- Remove unnecessary cached_methods
- Use _matrix_check
- "Faster element of order in number fields. Right now it is a bit stupid, number field elements carry a
  denominator and compute a gcd after each operation. In an order there is no need of denominator and
  operations are much faster."
- Faster matrices on number fields / orders
- Refactor analytic type, constructions

Bugfixing:
- There might be bugs with q_basis in some cases (see sagemathcloud demo)
