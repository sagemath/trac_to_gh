Git sometimes randomly fails in its testsuite, probably a race:

```
ok 76 - extra args: set-url origin newurl oldurl
# passed all 76 test(s)
1..76
not ok 71 - rebase -i --root on linear history is a no-op # TODO known breakage
ok 12 - git rebase -i (fixup without conflict)
ok 13 - git rebase -i (double edit)
# passed all 13 test(s)
1..13
not ok 72 - rebase -p --root on linear history is a no-op # TODO known breakage
ok 73 - rebase  -f --root on linear history causes re-write
ok 74 - rebase -m -f --root on linear history causes re-write
ok 75 - rebase -i -f --root on linear history causes re-write
ok 76 - rebase -p -f --root on linear history causes re-write
# still have 20 known breakage(s)
# passed all remaining 56 test(s)
1..76
make[5]: Leaving directory '/home/vbraun/Sage/git-develop/local/var/tmp/sage/build/git-1.8.4.4.p0/src/t'
Makefile:36: recipe for target 'test' failed
make[4]: *** [test] Error 2
make[4]: Leaving directory '/home/vbraun/Sage/git-develop/local/var/tmp/sage/build/git-1.8.4.4.p0/src/t'

make[3]: Leaving directory '/home/vbraun/Sage/git-develop/local/var/tmp/sage/build/git-1.8.4.4.p0/src'
Error running git's test suite.
```
We should probably first upgrade to the latest git before worrying about that.
