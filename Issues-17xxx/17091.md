Git sometimes randomly fails in its testsuite, probably a race:

```
ok 76 - extra args: set-url origin newurl oldurl
# passed all 76 test(s)
1..76
not ok 71 - rebase -i --root on linear history is a no-op # TODO known breakage
ok 12 - git rebase -i (fixup without conflict)
ok 13 - git rebase -i (double edit)
# passed all 13 test(s)
1..13
not ok 72 - rebase -p --root on linear history is a no-op # TODO known breakage
ok 73 - rebase  -f --root on linear history causes re-write
ok 74 - rebase -m -f --root on linear history causes re-write
ok 75 - rebase -i -f --root on linear history causes re-write
ok 76 - rebase -p -f --root on linear history causes re-write
# still have 20 known breakage(s)
# passed all remaining 56 test(s)
1..76
make[5]: Leaving directory '/home/vbraun/Sage/git-develop/local/var/tmp/sage/build/git-1.8.4.4.p0/src/t'

We should probably first upgrade to the latest git before worrying about that.

Since we don't really need SSL we can just disable common crypto. Git is part of xcode on OSX, so its unlikely that anybody would even notice.
