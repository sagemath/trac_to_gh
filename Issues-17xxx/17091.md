Keywords: incomplete gamma function

See [this sage-support thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-support/lGGO_q_NVzg) for details.

```
sage: N(integral(1/log(x)^2,(x,2,3)))
0.536566859259958  # quite wrong
sage: integral(1/(ln(x))^2, x,2,3)
gamma(-1, -log(3)) - gamma(-1, -log(2))
```
We get the antiderivative and answer from Maxima, which evaluates this correctly numerically.

```
 (%i1) display2d : false $ 
  (%i2) foo : 1/log(x)^2 $ 
  (%i3) integrate (foo, x, 2, 3); 
  (%o3) gamma_incomplete(-1,-log(3))-gamma_incomplete(-1,-log(2)) 
  (%i4) %, numer; 
  (%o4) 1.273097216447114 
  (%i5) integrate (foo, x); 
  (%o5) gamma_incomplete(-1,-log(x)) 
  (%i6) ev (%, x=3) - ev (%, x=2); 
  (%o6) gamma_incomplete(-1,-log(3))-gamma_incomplete(-1,-log(2)) 
  (%i7) %, numer; 
  (%o7) 1.273097216447114 
```

See in particular this ugly plot.

```
sage: plot(lambda t: numerical_integral(1/ln(x)^2,2,t)[0],2,3)+plot(lambda t: gamma(-1, -log(t)).real(),2,3,color='red')
```
And even that we have to call `real()` to remove the numerical noise is not good...

I can't seem to reproduce this in Sage 6.4:

```
sage: numerical_integral(1/log(x)^2,2,3)
(1.273097216447114, 1.4134218422857824e-14)
sage: N(integral(1/log(x)^2,(x,2,3)))
1.27309721644711
```
In fact, the incomplete gamma function is evaluated using PARI, and the bug appears to have been fixed by the latest PARI upgrade (see #15767):

```
gp-2.5 > incgam(-1,-1)
%1 = -1.5817775437849803404714887501837998073

That is because of a patch I made at #7099; it assumed that the parent had a `precision()` method (previously the precision was ignored when converting the arguments into a `ComplexField`).  I will fix this as soon as I have time.

We should also add a doctest for the original bug.

It would be good if you (or someone else) could try plotting this with the above patch and check if it looks good to you.

Did you want to add 

```
N(integral(1/log(x)^2,(x,2,3)))
```
as well then, or is the example you have with the actual antideriv and floats sufficient?
