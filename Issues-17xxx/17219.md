Sage's catalogs (of groups, monoids, algebras, crystals, ...) are very handy. However it takes quite some time to maintain them, and this won't scale in the long run: we would want to have similar catalogs for Hopf Algebras, rings, coxeter groups, ... with proper inclusions between the catalogs. A natural setting would be that of categories. Namely to be able to do something like:

```
    sage: catalog = CoxeterGroups().catalog()
    sage: catalog.<tab>
    WeylGroup
    SymmetricGroup
    ...
```

The core feature is to be able to retrieve all the parents implemented in Sage that belong to a given category.

Florent wrote a prototype of this during the Sage days in Edinburgh in January 2013. It instruments `TestSuite`, so that running the test suite builds a database of all parent implementations, with their default category. Then, from this category, it's easy to recover all parents in a category by reverse lookup.

Automatically built catalogs "for algebraic structures". You will not make this work with hypergraphs.<tab>, designs nor graphs/digraphs, there are no categories nor testsuites there.

By the way there is a thing that I do not understand: do you actually intend to make the doctests, though the calls to testsuite, actually fill Sage's database of catalogs ? Does that mean that the doctests will actually have an effect on the code ?

Or is it only to detect that the catalog already contains what is expected to be present ?

A priori no specific plan: the purpose is to be exhaustive. Something like, for e.g. abstract classes the Java standard library API, exhaustive lists of "all implementations".

Definitely: nothing beats a human to highlight the important classes (although we could dream of a system that would automatically gather data from Sage's usage by all users, and automatically learn from that, but that's for later :-)). So, indeed, where we have the manpower, it's good to have manually built indexes. But they could focus on the piece requiring human judgement, and refer to the automaticaly generated ones for exhaustivity. And everywhere else the automatic index are better than nothing.

Well, arguably there should be TestSuite's for graphs and friends :-)
Other than that, it should be easy to let the infrastructure also
gather data for certain abstract classes (e.g. GenericGraph) in
addition to categories.

That being said if the current workflow for building and maintaining
the catalogs for graphs and friends is deemed good enough, we don't
have to change it!

Well, I sure would not want every user to have to run the tests to
have a full featured Sage :-)

So I am thinking of a two stage process, like for the pickle database:

- When Sage would be put in a certain mode, TestSuite would be
  instrumented to gather the data and fill up the database needed for
  the automatic catalogs. This could typically be done as an
  additional step of the release process. Of course this needs to be
  automatized to not add burden to the release manager; and the
  specifics of this need to be settled.

- This database would be shipped with the Sage distribution, be it in
  source or binary form, typically as an spkg or something similar.

Cheers,
