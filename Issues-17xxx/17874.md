<a id='comment:16'></a>After installing mistune and looking at what's dumped in a terminal during the install of latex packages I see

```
Logfile: /64bitdev/storage/sage-git_develop/sage/local/share/texlive/install-tl.log
package extension not present in package repository.
tlmgr: package repository http://ftp.math.purdue.edu/mirrors/ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet
```
So extension is not a latex package. From a Sage shell

```
sage-ipython nbconvert  --to=latex 'plots.ipynb'
```
does generate `plots.tex`. But

```
sage-ipython nbconvert  --to=pdf 'plots.ipynb'
```
fails initially with

```
! LaTeX Error: File `xkeyval.sty' not found.
```
The usepackage(s) needed to pdflatex `plots.tex` are

```
    \usepackage{graphicx} % Used to insert images
    \usepackage{adjustbox} % Used to constrain images to a maximum size 
    \usepackage{color} % Allow colors to be defined
    \usepackage{enumerate} % Needed for markdown enumerations to work
