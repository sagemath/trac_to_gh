The pickle process appears to forget whether an expression is a function.

```
sage: var('u_0 u_1')
(u_0, u_1)
sage: f2u = (1 - u_0).function(u_0, u_1)
sage: f2u(x,y)
-x + 1
sage: f2 = loads(dumps(f2u))
sage: f2(x,y)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

```

Since I'm using a modular program design with intermediate results in .sobj files, this (along with some other bugs I've reported) is making it inconvenient for me to work with functions...

Indeed, I suspect it's related in the sense that pickling of symbolic expressions seems to rely entirely one Pynac serialization and doesn't take into account the properties of the python objects involved. In particular, the difference between a callable and a normal symbolic expression seems to lie entirely in the parent:

```
sage: var('u_0 u_1 x y')
(u_0, u_1, x, y)
sage: f2u = (1 - u_0).function(u_0, u_1)
sage: parent(f2u)
Callable function ring with arguments (u_0, u_1)
sage: parent(f2u(u_0,u_1))
Symbolic Ring
sage: f2u(u_0,u_1).__reduce_ex__(2) == f2u.__reduce_ex__(2) #this confirms that they pickle to the same.
True
```
