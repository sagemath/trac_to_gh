Improve the error analysis for the implementation of Dobinski's formula to compute the Bell numbers leading to

1. code which is actually consistent with the mathematical formulas
2. code which is cleaner and simpler than before
3. a complete error estimate including the final real approximation
4. faster code:

Before:

```
sage: timeit('bell_number(200)', number=2000)
2000 loops, best of 3: 1.45 ms per loop
```

After:

```
sage: timeit('bell_number(200)', number=2000)
2000 loops, best of 3: 441 µs per loop
```

Depends on #16428
Depends on #15300

Without. The difference is bigger for smaller n of course. Here is a more accurate comparison:

flint:

10000  cpu/wall(s): 0.91 0.949
20000  cpu/wall(s): 4.02 4.173
40000  cpu/wall(s): 18.12 21.109

sage (without patch):

100 5 loops, best of 3: 1.05 ms per loop
200 625 loops, best of 3: 1.52 ms per loop
400 125 loops, best of 3: 1.96 ms per loop

    "body": "<a id='comment:10'>Comment 10:</a>\nYou can just compute the sum in Dobinski's formula as an exact fraction (keeping the numerator and denominator separate, not actually dividing rational numbers by successive factorials). Indeed this is what flint does for n < 5000 (for larger n it uses a multimodular algorithm). This simplifies the error analysis.",

You can just compute the sum in Dobinski's formula as an exact fraction (keeping the numerator and denominator separate, not actually dividing rational numbers by successive factorials). Indeed this is what flint does for n < 5000 (for larger n it uses a multimodular algorithm). This simplifies the error analysis.
