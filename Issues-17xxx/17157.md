Improve the error analysis for the implementation of Dobinski's formula to compute the Bell numbers leading to

1. code which is actually consistent with the mathematical formulas
2. code which is cleaner and simpler than before
3. a complete error estimate including the final real approximation
4. faster code:

Before:

```
sage: timeit('bell_number(200)', number=2000)
2000 loops, best of 3: 1.45 ms per loop
```

After:

```
sage: timeit('bell_number(200)', number=2000)
2000 loops, best of 3: 441 Âµs per loop
```

Without. The difference is bigger for smaller n of course. Here is a more accurate comparison:
