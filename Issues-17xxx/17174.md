Python build finished, but the necessary bits to build these modules were not found:
_bsddb             dl                 gdbm            
imageop            linuxaudiodev      ossaudiodev     
spwd               sunaudiodev                        
To find the necessary bits, look in setup.py in detect_modules() for the module's name.


Failed to build these modules:
_scproxy

Offending line:

```
typedef void (^dispatch_block_t)(void);
```
Other objc bits are in #if blocks, but this (and some following stuff) is not.

Simply replacing it with `typedef dispatch_block_t void;` works for Python, but then R blows up when it tries to build its OSX interface.
