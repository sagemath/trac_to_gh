Replying to [@videlec](#comment%3A10):
> Another one: the file `auto_gen.pxi` does not appear in the reference manual. The documentation is hence invisible (except the interactive one).

It's included in `gen.pyx`, also with the documentation.

<div id="comment:13" align="right">Comment 13</div>

It looks globally nice!

There are some bad formatting:
- some `:emphasis:` gets wrong (see `bnrconductor` or `bnrdisc`)
- some `:math:` directives get wrong  (see `binomial`, `contfrac`, `divrem` or `elleta`). Apparently, some backslash disappeared since we have <code>:math:\`binomial(x,y)\`</code> instead of <code>:math:\`\binomial{x}{y}\`</code>. Idem in `polgalois`: `TbelongstoQQ[X]`
- the hyperlink to sections via `[Label: se:XYZ]` are very bad (see `factornf`, `fflog`, `fforder`, `galoisfixedfield`, `znlog`, `znorder`)

Some of the issue above looks fine in the `pari.desc` file... might be because of the `gphelp` script. For example

```
$ gphelp -raw binomial
...
binomial coefficient @[dollar]binom{x}{y}@[dollar].
...

$ gphelp -raw polgalois
...
@[dollar]T belongs to @[startbi]Q@[endbi][X]@[dollar]
...
```
On the other hand, the tex documentation with `gphelp XYZ` looks fine.
