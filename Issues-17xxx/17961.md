```
Since #17767, all `pyx` files in `sage/misc` are compiled on all platforms, due to the following line in `modules_list.py`:

```
Extension('*', ['sage/misc/*.pyx'])
```

This is in particular the case of `sage/misc/darwin_utilities.pyx`, which should however only be included on Darwin as specified on lines 2096 and following of `modules_list.py`:

```
# Only include darwin_utilities on OS_X >= 10.5
```

This ticket moves this file and its friends to a subdirectory of its own.
