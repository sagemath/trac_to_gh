After many patches which only fixed a bad call to copy() there and there, here is a patch to fix them all. Err, all that need to be fixed: I went over all of them and added this when needed.

This branch also fixes a small problem reported today by a friend of mine, i.e. an exception when trying to plot with javascript a graph whose layout is defined with "complicated" objects like rationals.

```
graphs.CompleteBipartiteGraph(4,5).show(method="js")
```
