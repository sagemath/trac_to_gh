At [this ask.sagemath question](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/24630/log_integral-gives-wrong-values-for-complex-arguments/) it comes to our attention that `Li(x)` and `Ei(log(x))` don't always agree, though apparently `Ei(log(x))` currently gives what one wants on the critical strip for the Riemann zeta function.  mpmath apparently doesn't really choose "smart" branch cuts for `Ei` internally, or maybe it's the log integral that doesn't ... anyway, we need consistency here more than anything else, though having it agree with the usual stuff on the critical line would be nice.

```
def li1(z):
    return quad(lambda t: 1/ln(t), [2, z]) + li(2)

def li2(z):
    return z * hyp2f0(1,1,1/log(z))/log(z) + pi * sign(im(z)) * 1j
```
> The outputs seem to agree:


```
mp.dps = 30

for n in range(30):
    z=30*(rand()-0.5)+30*(rand()-0.5)*1j
    print z, chop(li1(z) - li2(z))

As another thought, perhaps at least updating documentation to talk about what to expect and when to use the other branch stuff might be useful...
