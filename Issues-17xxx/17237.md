Some thoughts from FJ:

```
 def li1(z):
     return quad(lambda t: 1/ln(t), [2, z]) + li(2)
 
 def li2(z):
     return z * hyp2f0(1,1,1/log(z))/log(z) + pi * sign(im(z)) * 1j
```
> The outputs seem to agree:


```
 mp.dps = 30
 
 for n in range(30):
     z=30*(rand()-0.5)+30*(rand()-0.5)*1j
     print z, chop(li1(z) - li2(z))
```

As another thought, perhaps at least updating documentation to talk about what to expect and when to use the other branch stuff might be useful...
