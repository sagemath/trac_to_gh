This is another element of the future construction of Kirkman Triple Systems. It creates a new `group_divisible_designs` module with two constructions (one of which just creates a BIBD). One of its commits moves the `GroupDivisibleDesign` class from `incidence_structures` to the new file (that commit is a move, it does nothing else).

This branch probably conflicts with #17581. When one of them will be reviewed I will rebase the other)

Hey,

1) A small commit for typos in the doc.

2) `GDD(kn,{k},{n}) = TD(k,n)`, doesn't it? But `transversal_design` is not called in `group_divisible_design`. Is there a reason?

Vincent

What's wrong with `k_k`, really ? `:-PPPP`

> 2) `GDD(kn,{k},{n}) = TD(k,n)`, doesn't it? But `transversal_design` is not called in `group_divisible_design`. Is there a reason?

Oh, true. Well, I did not need it here. But of course we can add it. Actually, it probably does not make much sense to have GDD ask the BIBD constructor, as those BIBD also yield OA. And I don't think that there is any OA that is built through a BIBD.

It's up to you, we can do it now or later. I don't mind either, it all works.

The reason why I wrote the GDD constructor like that is that I need those constructions for the KTS.

Actually, I'm more for getting this inside first, this way I can write the end of the KTS code tomorrow. And perhaps another code afterward to change that. Then again it is all correct.

P.S.: We do what you prefer, set it to positive review depending on that, your commit is fine.

Indirectly, yes. They use projective planes.

Fine, everything depends whether or not you want to expose this function in `designs.<TAB>`. If you do, then one needs to make the appropriate call to `transversal_design`.

True, but that's done manually, by testing if n is a prime power and stuff.

With this patch it appears in `designs.<tab>`. Anyway, I'm not saying that I will not do it. I will write the patch tomorrow. I will just end the KTS construction first, that's all.
