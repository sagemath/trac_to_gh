There have been a few cases when the Mac app continually fails to start the notebook server.  This should be made more robust.

I have tested this now by removing the users.pickle file, and by filling it with garbage.  In both cases it started up in Terminal, though in the latter case it still failed to start (because users.pickle was junk).  But at least it should be more obvious what the problem is.
