There is currently no `all` option for the `.nth_root()` method of algebraic numbers:

```
sage: a = QQbar(-1)
sage: a.nth_root(3)
0.500000000000000? + 0.866025403784439?*I
sage: a.nth_root(3, all=True)
...
TypeError: nth_root() got an unexpected keyword argument 'all'
```

while such an option exists for other representations of complex numbers:

```
sage: a = CDF(-1)
sage: sage: a.nth_root(3)
0.5000000000000001 + 0.8660254037844386*I
sage: sage: a.nth_root(3, all=True)
[0.5000000000000001 + 0.8660254037844386*I,
 -1.0 + 3.4393603416671414e-16*I,
 0.49999999999999933 - 0.8660254037844389*I]
```

The aim of this ticket is to provide one. This feature was requested today during a workshop at Villetaneuse.

As far as I understand: It does. When you do `__pow__` there is an introspection (= lookup in the dictionary of methods). But for special methods there are dedicated slots and when you do `**` there is no lookup since you access directly to this slot.

I am not sure <code>see :trac:\`17379\`</code> is appropriate for a change that is not a bugfix. Are you willing to see reference to trac for each new feature implemented?

Do you have an idea why this is long

```
sage: AA(-2).nth_root(5, all=True) == QQbar(-2).nth_root(5, all=True) # long time
