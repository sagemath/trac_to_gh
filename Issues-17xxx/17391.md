[Flagmatic](http://flagmatic.org/) is a downstream project that was reasonably active until the past year or so, and now has a few "friendly forks" to add functionality and/or maintain compatibility with Sage.  We should find out exactly what its status is, and possibly assist in either its incorporation as an optional package, or at least have a little doctesting in some appropriate file so that people know what to expect.

(Note that #14505 added its dependency, csdp, as an optional or experimental package, so that prereq for this is already around.)

Thank you, that's great! I will go on and submit the proposal today. I am not sure how it gets to you or who decides whether it's a good project... I guess we will see.
