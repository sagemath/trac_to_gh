I am not sure if it is a good idea that i would be the reviewer, since i have been involved in tge coding too. Besides, there is some polishing needed still and it would go faster if i directly work on it.

jhpamieri, do you feel able to do the revieweing? If yes, i will start working in the corrections. Otherwise, i will stay away from changing the code and just act as reviewer.

It looks like a bad resolution to a merge, but it's a simple enough fix. Also on a quick look through:

- Doc formatting should follow:

```
INPUT:

- ``name`` -- some description that is very long and
  note the alignment

OUTPUT:

- these are not usually complete sentences but short descriptions
```
- Move the nice documentation from the `__init__` into the class-level doc so people can actually see it.
- All methods must have doctests.
- It's my pythonic to use `isinstance(input_, list)` instead of `type(input_) == list`.
- `input_` is a bad variable name (according to python standards), just use `input` (or perhaps the slightly more descriptive `data`)
- Don't raise `Exception`, instead raise `ValueError` or `TypeError` (after killing with fire and holy water :P).
- Change

```python
pd_error = _pd_check_(input_)
if pd_error == True:
    pass
elif pd_error == False:
    pass
```
  into (the pythonic)

```python
if _pd_check_(input_):
    pass
else:
    pass
```
- Use `is not None` instead of `!= None`.
- Make `_dt_internal_` a proper method of the class.
- Remove the trailing underscore of `_pd_check_`, ,`_dt_internal_` etc. as methods with a leading and trailing underscore are usually Sage special functions (and naming conventions of python).
- Is "dowker" a proper name (and hence, should be capitalized in the documentation)?
- The method name `Seifert_Matrix` should be `seifert_matrix` (naming conventions again).
- Could you change the name of `ncomponents` to `number_of_components` (although you can keep it as a shorthand alias)?
- This needs to be added to the documentation (probably as a new component).

I'll make a more detailed pass through the code after these are addressed. I also don't know how much of the math I'll be able to review as I've studied a little knot theory, but possibly not enough to check everything. Although Miguel could count as the reviewer on that front.

I think this will be a great addition to Sage, all it needs a little polish.

Best,

Travis

Also please respect [http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/coding_basics.html#headings-of-sage-library-code-files](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/coding_basics.html#headings-of-sage-library-code-files) and add your new files to the reference manual (have a look at the files in `src/doc/en/reference` to see how that is done).

Even better, change

```
pd_error = _pd_check_(input_)
if pd_error == True:
    raise Exception("...")
elif pd_error == False:
    foo
```
to

```
if not _pd_check(input):
    raise ValueError("...")

foo
```
and change the last line of `def _pd_check_(pd):` to `return not pd_error`, since I would expect a "check" function to return `True` if the checking was successful. Also drop the trailing underscores.

I was planning on making a package with the database from the knot atlas, and use it to run automated tests, computing the invariants for the knots and links there.

The problem with that approach is that a) It needs some nontrivial work to be implemented, and b) it restricts to knots and links presented im spcially "nice" ways, so we could miss some bugs if they show up only when some strange representations are used.

Anyways, it would be a nice addition by itself, so i will try to work on it in the following weeks.

In the meantime, and since there are several other reviewers in the coding style part, i will just focus on checking the mathematical correctness of the methods.

There is something working wrong in the following case:

```
sage: L=Link([[1, 4, 2, 5], [7, 10, 8, 11], [3, 9, 4, 8], [9, 3, 10, 2], [5, 12, 6, 1], [11, 6, 12, 7]])
sage: L
<repr(<sage.knots.link.Link at 0x7f41771c8a28>) failed: Exception: Invalid Input>
```

It gets an error when trying to get the  connected components, which in turn tries to convert it to braid (which is probably not a good idea, it would be wiser to compute the components directly from the PD_code, since we might me loosing something in the conversion PD<->braid).

In any case, this example fails in the conversion to braid:

```
sage: L.braid()
...
Exception: Invalid Input
```

Please go through it and debug.

FTR - I might be able to pull a few of the knot theorists at Davis to do the review in a month or two.

Also here's some things that I'd like to see (although they don't have to be done here):

- Make the monoid of all knots (and/or links) under connect sum (and disjoint union).
- Implement a latex and/or a plotting method (although perhaps this would need specialized class for PL knots?).
- Handle input in Dowker notation (if I understand it correctly, it completely determines a knot), and subsequently make `_dowker_notation_` public (i.e. name it `dowker_notation`).

I am working on the plot method. Miguel has sent me the outline and I am on it.

The purpose of including the dowker notation was to implement the HOMFLY Polynomial which is in progress. The dowker notation as I understand is the incoming pair at each crossing. It completely determines the link but PD code is more complete. I guess we can include it but as PD is more complete I think we can exclude it. Anyways let me know your thoughts on this. 

Sorry for the previous comment which mentioned the DT which is different from the dowker code.

I have done some changes cleaning up the conversion to braid. 

I have also run a script to check the results of .alexander_polynomial against the ones available in the knot atlas (taking into account the notation differences that Amit noted), and so far they match. Although my script is only checking 838 cases. There are some oddities, for example, in some knots, the knot atlas states that the Alexander polynomial is "ComplexInfinity", although our implementation returns an actual polynomial.

In other cases, the knot atlas shows no PD code, so i am not checking those.

In each case, the first polynomial is the one given by our implementation, and the second the one given by the knot atlas.

Can someone confirm if the knot atlas results are correct?

I have worked along on the debug and here are the results :

```

sage: L = Link([[1,5,2,4],[7,11,8,10],[3,8,4,9],[9,2,10,3],[5,1,6,12],[11,7,12,6]])

Hello,

The logic of every if/else is completely crazy. Rewriting the `__init__` properly takes only half of the preceding implementation: see my commit at `u/vdelecroix/17030`. The code needs a lot of polishing. I did not dig in the details but it is clearly hard to read!

I have browsed through the commit, data can also be a PD code when its length is 2 it is not always oriented gauss code.

Yes and this is fine. From my commit:

```
+            if len(data) != 2 or not all(isinstance(i,list) for i in data[0]):
+                # here we expect a PD code
```
Which mean that you expect a PD code if either `len(data) != 2` **or** if any element of `data[0]` is not a list.

I think the bulk of the documentation should be at the class level, rather than the module level. That way when a user does `Link?`, the user sees all of that documentation. Also this way the doc is better associated with what it's documenting.

Side note, making things raw strings, the `r"""`, is usually safer, in particular when you have latex commands.

Okay then I guess a combination of braidwordcomponents which gives 

```
sage: L._braidwordcomponents_()
[[-1, 1, 1, 1], [3], [5, 7, 6]]
```

ncomponents could be used. I will try to set this up.

Whereas the braid [1,3] has also two connected components (two pieces of rope), but there is no crossing at all between them. The planar diagram is just two separated planar diagrams. 

This situation of "completely independent" pieces needs to be treated separatedly in several methods. For instance, try to check how many methods fail for things like Link([[1,1,2,2],[3,3,4,4]])

Since Amit did not answer lately, i decided to step up and do some cleanup and polishing of the code. Maybe documentation can be improved, but i think besides that it is pretty much ready for review.

Bad news is that, since i am now an author, somebody else should do the reviewing instead of me.

Alternately, if there is a good "core" of functionality you (mmarco) as reviewer approve of that is a coherent whole, then other stuff could be moved to a new ticket.  Especially if the stuff that still needs review is more peripheral, such as plotting...

Inthe case of git history, i like it to reflect the process that actually took place, in case that someone in the future wants to do some archeology.

But it is just a matter of personal taste. I understand why other people prefear to avoid haveing too many commits in the history.

My last changes touch most of the relevant methods, so it would be difficult to stablish a clear separation from my work and Amit's.

Here some ideas of things that non specialists in knot theory can do towards reviewing:

- Check the documentation. In fact, it is better if they are not specialist: the documentation should be clear for everybody. So if there is something that someone does not understand, please point it out.

- Test some results that are known in other sources. For instance go to the knot atlas, pick any knot or link there, create it in Sage, compute the different invariants and compare. (Note, here we follow a different convention than in the knot atlas for the PD code, Xa,b,c,d in the knot atlas corresponds here to [a,d,b,c]).

- Check out also the plotting of knots (no deep knowledge of knot theory is needed, although it is a complicated method, so it is hard to review... but it is really cool ;) ).


Regarding the idea of separting it into smaller tickets, we could do that, but besides the plotting, all the methods that can be separated into other tickets (i.e. the computation of the different invariants), are pretty trivial, since they are almost direct aplications of the conversion to braid).

I would be happy to participate in the review. But first, you have to read my two cents about git history. I think that the git history must be helpful to newcomers and not for archaeologists (for them, we have trac and sage-devel. Moreover, they do not necessarily want to know that in the first n commits you were just trying to understand how to use git).

More precisely:
- keep the history simple
- always have the following sentence in mind: "what is the most helpful for the reviewer?" 

More concretely
- merge as less as possible
- if you modify a lot on an already existing file, try to have one commit that deletes and an other one that adds
- if you are only providing new functionalities in independent file, try to minimize the number of commits (or at least make them coherent for the reader)

Git history could be really helpful to reviewer. For example, if you simply move a file, the commit will only be "mv old_file -> new_file". Hence, as a reviewer, I know that there is nothing to check in that file.

Vincent

We don't have implemented the 3-genus, as many other invariants.

> I have writen a module documentation (i think it still needs work)

Perhaps, but at least now it is sufficient for people coming in with a reasonable mathematical background.  Often things are implemented in Sage for research first, then stuff making it more useful for pedagogy comes later.

Hopefully someone might be able to look at the remaining code, of course!  I won't have time for this in the immediate future.

There is a bug with the .regions method that shows up when there are edges with both ends in the same crossing:

```
sage: L=Link([[1,2,2,1]])
sage: L.regions()
[]
sage: L=Link([[1,1,2,2]])
sage: L.regions()
[[-2], [1], [2, -1]]
```

I don't have much time right now, but can try to solve it when i find some time. In the meantime, can Amit or someone else take a look?

The problem with the first case is with the orientation of the knot. It seems the orientation of the knot is coming out as -1 which should be +1

```
sage: L = Link([[1, 2, 2, 1]])  
sage: L.orientation()
[-1]
```

I will try looking into the construction of orientation.

As for the second input, single negative entry does not make sense and I have added a bit of code (not optimal yet works). Here are the results :

```
sage: L = Link([[1, 1, 2, 2]])
sage: L.orientation()
[-1]
sage: L.regions()
[[1], [2, -1]]
```

I will try working on the orientation to see where it is going wrong.

The plot method needs some work to handle too these kind of loops properly.

Ok, i added the misisng doctest. I also solved a bug in the orientation method, and while i were at it, i rebased the whole thing to the last development version.

If you feel able to review it, then please go for it. Otherwise i will try to tho de the splitting into smaller parts for easier review.

If Miguel thinks it is (now) mathematically solid, then I will do the final parts of the review over the next day or so.

Some things from a quick lookthrough:

- Is the definition of the writhe valid for links? Right now the documentation just says "of the knot".

- Methods like `alexander_polynomial` could use elaboration in their documentation, such as their definition and/or references.

- I want to create a separate class `Knot` inheriting from `Link` to make it easier for people expanding on this in the future (and there is already a method specifically for knots). Any objections to me doing this?

(John just outposted me on the symlink :P ).

Hi Travis,

Please go ahead with a full review. I think a new `Knot` class would be good. For future work, it would also be nice to have a catalog of links and knots (e.g., `knots.Trefoil()`) and also ways of producing new links from old. Could you add a `.. todo` list?

I agree that more documentation would be great, with definitions, references, and (for `plot` at least) algorithms.

How is equality determined? How should it be? Should the oriented Gauss code be good enough?

```
sage: trefoil = Link([[1, 5, 2, 4], [5, 3, 6, 2], [3, 1, 4, 6]])
sage: trefoil == Link([[1, 5, 2, 4], [5, 3, 6, 2], [3, 1, 4, 6]])
False
```

I haven't actually looked at the code, and I don't know if I ever will. Some suggestions for miscellaneous minor cleanup:

It is as valid for link diagrams. The only difference with the knot case is that a change of orientation in a knot diagram does not change the writhe. However, in the case of link diagrams, a change of the orientation on a component might change the writhe. However, we are always internally considering an orientation in the diagrams, so it does make sense.

I had thought of keeping the same class (since they would be two almost identical classes), but have two different funcions to create the general links and the knots. The knot function would then just check that the given diagram corresponds to a knot and then create the corresponding link object.

I am working on a package that would provide a knot/link database taken from the knot atlas (http://katlas.org).

Once done that, i would also like to have an "identify" method that, given a knot/link, computes its invariants and compares them with the ones in the database, giving then a list of possibilities from the database for the given knot/link.

Agree on all. I defintely need to document better the plot method. That was one of the reasons for my proposal of splitting: right now the plot code is specially hard to review.

We can't realistically determine equality. Even determining if a given diagram corresponds to the unknot is a really hard problem. Oriented Gauss code is not even a knot invariant. 

Now that you mention it, i think that equality checking should raise "not implemented error".

Okay, I've done my initial pass. There's still a lot more work to be done with respect to the documentation, in particular, the class level doc for the respective `Link` and `Knot` classes. (This needs to be cleaned up before a positive review; the other doc is not so important to me but it would be nice to have.)

I couldn't get one of the doctests to pass with cb84cec:

I believe this was a typo of a missing minus sign (if I understand the knot correctly from the plot).

I made a lot of minor to micro optimizations and code cleanup. I created a `Knot` class as Miguel suggested (and was what I had in mind initially). I created an equality check by looking at the braids (is that a link invariant?) and put a warning message about false negatives (but if it is a link invariant, then we should be able to remove the warning message).

There shouldn't be any more large refactoring of the code after this point I think.

I will look at it more carefully tomorrow.

In the meantime, the failing doctest is indeed a typo. The knot should be defined as 

```
sage: L = Link([[1, 2, 3, 3], [2, 4, 5, 5], [7, 4, 1, 7]])
```


> I made a lot of minor to micro optimizations and code cleanup. I created a `Knot` class as Miguel suggested (and was what I had in mind initially). I created an equality check by looking at the braids (is that a link invariant?) and put a warning message about false negatives (but if it is a link invariant, then we should be able to remove the warning message).

The braid is not a link invariant. Actually we should be careful about what equality means. If it means equality of diagrams (that is, the planar diagrams are actually the same, although maybe the elements are enumerated in a different order), we could write some method to check if there exists a different choice of labels that makes the presentations identical. If by equality we mean isotopy invariants, then we are definitely out of luck, since as far as a i know there is no effective method for that.

Carbon-copying a few remarks from [a sage-devel thread](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/ByJURRvRgLg/Jv37j-CTCwAJ): Link.jones_polynomial() has some issues for sufficiently trivial links.

In the following example -- which should be covered -- the method throws an exception:

```
sage: B = BraidGroup(2)
sage: b = B([])
sage: L = Link(b)
sage: L.jones_polynomial()
...
IndexError: list index out of range
```

And here's an example where it returns an incorrect value:

```
sage: B = BraidGroup(8)
sage: b = B([1])
sage: L = Link(b)
sage: L.jones_polynomial()
1
```

In the sacond case, the class documentation states that the strands of the braid that have no crossings are ignored. Considering that, the result is correct.

Maybe we should change that anyways. But would involve some redeisgn of the internal data structures.

About the splitting of the classes, i think that what should be exposed to the user, is a  function that creates a Link or a Knot deppending of the input. That is: if the user wants to create a Link that happens to be a knot, why shouldn't it have a `arf_invariant`method?

I pushed those changes to `u/fuglede/17030` ([GH mirror](https://github.com/fuglede/sage/commit/72bb738149541d2360c7ab131ae8830c5dbb8aee) of the commit if you just want to have a quick look). One obvious pain is that the two algorithms give different results when the link is not the trace closure of the braid used to initialize it, which happens when one has crossing-less strands, as the following example illustrates:

```
sage: B = BraidGroup(3)
sage: b = B([1])
sage: L = Link(b)
sage: b.components_in_closure()
2
sage: L.number_of_components()
1
sage: L.jones_polynomial(algorithm='jonesrep')
-sqrt(t) - 1/sqrt(t)
sage: L.jones_polynomial(algorithm='statesum')
1
```

Of course, this is not specific to Jones related stuff:

```
sage: B = BraidGroup(3)
sage: b = B([1])
sage: b.alexander_polynomial()
0
sage: Link(b).alexander_polynomial()
1
```

The branch also corrects a couple of typos.

Actually, I just noticed that the `alexander_polynomial` method currently gives incorrect results, even when no braid strands are ignored:

```
sage: B = BraidGroup(4)
sage: b = B([1,3])  # A braid where all strands play a role
sage: L = Link(b)   # Two disjoint unknots
sage: b.alexander_polynomial()
0
sage: L.alexander_polynomial()
1
```

In this case, 0 is the correct result as the link bounds a disconnected oriented surface (two disjoint disks).

To debug it, it would be helpful to document what `_homology_generators_` actually returns: according to the current docs, it returns 'homology generators' but it currently outputs a list of integers. Perhaps the constructed Seifert surface is not connected, or something like that? This would explain why `seifert_matrix` gives the following output:

```
sage: L.seifert_matrix()
[]
```

In this particular case, the simplest Seifert surface is probably the cylinder whose corresponding Seifert matrix is the 1x1 zero matrix.

Something else that seems weird is the following:

```
sage: L.genus()
-2
```

The reference to the `seifert_matrix` construction is the following by Julia Collins :

http://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~jcollins/SeifertMatrix/

The results from the site are as follows :

You entered the braid [1,3] (Alphabetical notation: AC)
This has 2 component(s), i.e. it is a link.
The Seifert matrix is: [[]]
The genus of the Seifert surface is 0, and it has 2 connected component(s).
The braid is a disjoint union of unrelated subbraids: { [1], [3] }.

Also the reference to `homology_generators`, `genus` is the same. Though the results of the genus are different to what is reflected.

I get the genus is 0 for the example in [comment:142](#comment%3A142) with the current version.

I'm starting to understand what is going on with the code.

The braid word components are a nice reduced expression to compute these generators. See Lemma 3.1 in http://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~jcollins/SeifertMatrix/SeifertMatrix.pdf.

Also, should we put a remark somewhere that we might be changing the behavior of how we handle input from the braid group to include unused strands?

One last remark, there are some oddities with plotting multiple links, but I think we can just put a warning about that for now (unless someone wants to delve into that code). We should also add a few pictures to that doc with the `.. PLOT::` directive...

Thanks a lot ofr the work Travis!

I wrote the code for the plotting, and I am aware that it needs some work, but I think it is good enough for now. +1 to the warning and the pics in the doc.

I hope to have some time in the next week to do a deep review.

The determinant should definitely be 1; it's the Seifert matrix that doesn't really make sense to me (because as mentioned above, for the case of interest, one Seifert surface is the cylinder, but again, I have not understood what the algorithm actually does).

By treating only the symptoms, the algorithm now (in 7711771b) produces the incorrect result for the unknot:

```
sage: B = BraidGroup(2)
sage: b = B([1])
sage: b.alexander_polynomial()
1
sage: Link(b).alexander_polynomial()
0
```

Cool, that's also what I suspected back then. Where I come from, Seifert surfaces are connected by definition; that can make life a bit easier -- in particular in this situation where you can just use the same definition for the Alexander polynomial regardless of the chosen surface.

In any case, by "cylinder", I meant something homeomorphic to *S*<sup>1</sup> × [0, 1] which has boundary two separated unknots, and which has non-trivial *H*<sub>1</sub>. In that case, a Seifert matrix is the 1x1 zero matrix. Likewise in the case of the unknot, you can avoid having to ponder about 0x0 matrices, since *H*<sub>1</sub>(*D*<sup>2</sup> × **R**, **Z**) may be presented by the 1x1 unit matrix.

For the case at hand, the algorithm still produces incorrect results for links which bound disconnected oriented surfaces (I would not call such links "disjoint", since link components are *always* disjoint);

```
sage: B3 = BraidGroup(3)
sage: b = B3([1, 2, -2])
sage: b.alexander_polynomial()
0
sage: Link(b).alexander_polynomial()
1
```

And a weirder example:

```
sage: B2 = BraidGroup(2)
sage: b = B2([1, -1])
sage: b.alexander_polynomial()
0
sage: Link(b).alexander_polynomial()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

----> 1 Link(b).alexander_polynomial()

   1244         R = LaurentPolynomialRing(ZZ, var)
   1245         # The Alexander polynomial of disjoint links are defined to be 0
-> 1246         if len(self._braid_word_components()) > 1:
   1247             return R.zero()
   1248         t = R.gen()

/home/fuglede/repos/sage/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/knots/link.pyc in _braid_word_components(self)
    899         ml = list(self.braid().Tietze())
    900         if not ml:

    902 
    903         l = set(abs(k) for k in ml)

ValueError: the braid remains the same with no components
```

Edit: Ah, it looks like for the first one of those examples, the library throws away one of the components (is that intended? According to the docs, only "The strands of the braid that have no crossings at all are removed", and in this case, all of them have crossings; they just happen to be pretty trivial).

Yes, definitely.

In that case the `2 -2` are canceled automatically by the braid group:

```
sage: B = BraidGroup(4)
sage: B([1,2,-2])
s0
```
So it becomes just 1 unknot as far as the code currently works. Which is why we get an Alexander polynomial of 1.

Isn't it a bit unfortunate that one would need to understand the `BraidGroup` internals in order to use the knot theory module, though?

I'm not really constructing anything at all, so I'm not quite sure what it is that would not be a surface.

Yeah, that makes sense. Isn't it a bit unfortunate that one would need to understand the `BraidGroup` internals in order to use the knot theory module, though? If I just read the documentation in `Link`, then I might assume that `[1, -2, -2]` contains knots on all three strands (that's what I did anyway).

Yes, I believe I've heard "separable" being used in this context as well, although I can't seem to find a written source at the moment. The word of course already has another meaning in the context of topological spaces, but that's not really an issue. In any case, you could always just go with "bounds and oriented disconnected surface".

I propose to use the word "unlinked components" for the case you are talking about: they bound a disconnected surface, or, equivalently, they could be represented in a planar diagram where there are no crossings that involve two different components.

I chosed the word _isolated_components to reffer to that situation: where the planar representation that we are dealing with has no crossings that involve different components.

I considered other names, like "unlinked components", but I didin't like them because the concept I wanted to consider does not deppend on the 3-dimensional topology, but on the particular planar representation that we are using. If two components are shown as "isolated" in a planar diagram (which is the case that is troubling us here), they are clearly unlinked. But the converse is not true: we could have a very complicated diagram with crossings everywhere that actually represents 2 unlinked knots.

The implementation of the alexander polynomial assumes that the input doesn't have isolated components (that is why we need to treat that case separatedly), but is able to give the right output if there are several unlinked components that are not isolated. So i guess that the solution of detecting that case and giving a 0 output is the right one.

_isolated_components and _braid_word_components should do pretty much the same. The difference is that one computes it from the PD representation whereas the other uses the braid one.

So, can we give a positive review or are there still pending issues?

I went through most of everything once I have the references to the algorithms. At this point, I do not have any plans to making any (significant) improvements. I also agree with the philosophy of get good, but maybe not perfect, code in and fix bugs as we come across them.

As a followup, we might want to consider adding in optional spkgs of those other knot/link projects listed on Collins' webpage (e.g., [BraidProgramme](http://www.layer8.co.uk/maths/braids/)).

John, your changes look good to me. You should be able create isolated components with something like this:

```
sage: B = BraidGroup(4)
sage: L = Link(B([1,3]))
```
There's also a more interesting example with two isolated trefoils in the `plot()` examples:

```
sage: L = Link([[[-1, 2, -3, 1, -2, 3], [4, -5, 6, -4, 5, -6]], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]])
```

`@`fudlege I got your name from your Github page; I hope that was okay. Thank you for working on this, and I hope you continue to contribute to Sage.
