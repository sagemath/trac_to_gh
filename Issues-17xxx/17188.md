Presently computing the automorphism group of a graph G on n vertices and m edges, with weighted edges, involves reducing this to computing the automorphism groups of a vertex-weighted graph on n+m vertices.This is too much if m is big. 

There is a much better reduction, using only `$n(1+\lceil\log_2 M\rceil)$` vertices, with M being the number of different weights. 

Assume that each vertex a of G has integer weight d_a (for unweighted vertices case, assign the same weight to them all). Then, make `$b:=1+\lceil\log_2 M\rceil$` copies V<sup>i</sup> of vertices of G; each edge weight of G is encoded by b bits, as follows: if (a,b) is an edge of G of c-th weight (with weights numbered from 1 to M), then take the binary expansion `$c_1,...,c_b$` of c, and join a<sup>i</sup> and b<sup>i</sup> in V<sup>i</sup> for all i s.t. c_i=1. Futher, join a<sup>i</sup> and a<sup>j</sup> by an edge, and assign the weight d_a+i to each a<sup>i</sup>, for all i.

The automorphism group of the resulting graph on bn vertices is the automorphism group of edge (and vertex)-weighted G, when restricted to any V<sup>i</sup>.
