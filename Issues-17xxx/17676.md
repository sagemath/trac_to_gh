Sure, but here some words of warning:
If you try hard, you will probably find more bugs in groebner computation over integers. 

I suppose there at least are some bugs left of the sort:
easy example, should finish quickly, but it runs forever and eats up all mem.

I may try to catch some in my spare free time using my 
testbot framework https://github.com/jakobkroeker/infiniteTests.Singular (in development)
