About

```
return lambda x:self._rank[x] # the rank function is just the getitem of the dict
```

The comment string should be changed, "dict" -> "list". Also why bother with lambda function, because lists also has a `__getitem__`?

Line

```
return [rank_fcn[i] for i in range(self.order())]
```

seems strange --- isn't that just same as `return rank_fcn` or `return copy(rank_fcn)`? Or maybe I didn't understand this.

You are right.

> ```
> return [rank_fcn[i] for i in range(self.order())]
> ```
> 
> seems strange --- isn't that just same as `return rank_fcn` or `return copy(rank_fcn)`? Or maybe I didn't understand this. 


Because `rank_fcn` is a dictionary, not a list, and because it should be a dictionary in this function (because of lines like 'if x in rank_fcn').

Ah, true. This could also start with `rank_fcn=[None]*self.order()` instead of `rank_fcn={}`, but the current code seems to be cleaner.

I think this is ready for production, so I also changed milestone with status.

Right again. And I could have turned the 'if x in rank_fcn' into 'if rank_fcn[x] is Null'... Stupid me.

I hope that you do not mind: I am going to add a commit in a second to do that properly with a list in the function too. Not very important, but worth doing anyway.
