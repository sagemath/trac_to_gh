Dirichlet characters modulo 2 are printed in a strange way:

```
sage: DirichletGroup(2)[0]
Dirichlet character modulo 2 of conductor 1 mapping 
```
After #17337, this also happens for Dirichlet characters modulo 1.

This ticket makes Dirichlet characters modulo 1 and 2 print as

```
sage: DirichletGroup(1)[0]
Dirichlet character modulo 1 of conductor 1
sage: DirichletGroup(2)[0]
Dirichlet character modulo 2 of conductor 1
```
and uses the `mapping ...` only for conductors >= 3:

```
sage: DirichletGroup(3)[1]
Dirichlet character modulo 3 of conductor 1 mapping 2 |--> -1
```
