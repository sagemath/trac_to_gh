Hellooooooooooooo !!

Several comments:

- It's a pity to do the computations twice when lmbda1=lmbda2 (g1~g2
  symmetry). But perhaps that does not matter considering the timings involved.

- The comment on the infinite loops does not match the code that follows (the
  code is right)

- Why a `M = zip(*M)`? Isn't it better to change the loop above in order to
  compute the right matrix?

- The new doctest `designs.difference_matrix(56,None,existence=1)` returned
  the same answer in the latest beta. Did you mean to test the new construction?

- Could you write an INPUT section for the two functions?

Yoooooooo !

Looks good, but can you really cut as soon as `g1>g2` ? There is no symmetry there if the two lambda are different.

The algorithm runs through **all** possible pairs of lambdas. If you see `(lambd1, lmbda2)` you will also see `(lmbda2,lmbda1)`. It is hence fine to cut.

Dead right.

I'd say that this is good to go. We should pay attention to the timing of those functions, however, as they are called heavily by the OA constructors.
