Something related to the coercion is getting garbage collected during the execution of the command. On my desktop (a fast computer with gobs of RAM) I always get the right answer. But if I use the trace hook to force run a garbage collection between each Python command: 

```python
def trace_gc(frame, event, arg):
    import gc
    gc.collect()
```
then a) everything gets dog slow, about 5 mins for the lines below, and b) I get the wrong answer:

```
sage: sys.settrace(trace_gc)
sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
sage: BA = BrauerAlgebra(2, x, R)
sage: BA.ambient().has_coerce_map_from(BA)
False
```

I suppose the problem comes from `__init_extra__`, which for algebras is supposed to register the coercion from the base ring.

I found that we are in a rare case. This

```python
            try:
                has_custom_conversion = self.category().parent_class.from_base_ring.__func__ is not self.from_base_ring.__func__
            except AttributeError:
                # Sometimes from_base_ring is a lazy attribute
                has_custom_conversion = True
```
ends up in "`except AttributeError`". So, the question is if it is really the case here that `from_base_ring` exists as lazy attribute, or the attribute error came from a different reason.

Yes, it is a lazy attribute of the parent class.

I'm thinking the problem is coming from line 700-1:

```
self.module_morphism(self.lift, codomain=amb,
                     category=self.category()).register_as_coercion()
```
and is similar to what I posted on #16532, as a reference to the ambient partition algebra is not held by the subpartition algebra.

I'm thinking the easiest fix would be to actually just store a reference to the ambient algebra in the subpartition algebra. The best fix would probably be to add a `_coerce_map_from_` in `PartitionAlgebra` which checks if the parent is an instance of `SubPartitionAlgebra` and returns the lift module morphism. Both fixes are easy, which do you think we should do?
