To be precise,

```
sage: integrate(exp(-x)*sin(sqrt(x)), x, 0, oo)
integrate(e^(-x)*sin(sqrt(x)), x, 0, +Infinity)
```
This did work in Sage 5.2.

```

1/2*sqrt(pi)*e^(1/4)

    Another symbolic integral, from :trac:`11238`, that used to return
    zero incorrectly; with Maxima 5.26.0 one gets

Update: Sage v9.2 can evaluate the integral:

```
sage: integrate(exp(-x)*sin(sqrt(x)), x, 0, oo)                                          
1/2*sqrt(pi)*e^(-1/4)
```
This is not the same answer as previously reported, because the previous calculation has `e^(1/4)`, not `e^(-1/4)`. However, Maple and Wolfram Alpha agree that there should be a minus sign, so probably this is good.

And the calculation is not ridiculously slow (from `%timeit` on `CoCalc`):

```
3.02 s ± 248 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each)
```

I was going to suggest closing this ticket as `WorksForMe`, but then I noticed that the integration fails if we simply multiply the integrand by a constant:

```
sage: integrate(-exp(-x)*sin(sqrt(x)), x, 0, oo)
-integrate(e^(-x)*sin(sqrt(x)), x, 0, +Infinity)
```

FMIW :

```
sage: var("a")
a
sage: f(x)=exp(-x)*sin(sqrt(x))
sage: integrate(f(x),[x,0,oo])
1/2*sqrt(pi)*e^(-1/4)
sage: integrate(f(x),[x,0,oo]).n()
0.690194223521571
sage: numerical_integral(f(x),0,oo)
(0.6901942235198321, 1.3133617826621702e-07)
```

The minus sign seems correct...

```
sage: integrate(a*f(x),[x,0,oo])
a*integrate(e^(-x)*sin(sqrt(x)), x, 0, +Infinity)
```

Indeed... But :

```
sage: integrate(a*f(x),[x,0,oo]).unhold()
1/2*sqrt(pi)*a*e^(-1/4)
```

This might be more general...

Another quirk :

```
sage: integrate(a*f(x),[x,0,oo], algorithm="mathematica_free")
1/2*sqrt(pi)*a*e^(-1/4)
sage: integrate(f(x),[x,0,oo], algorithm="mathematica_free")
0.690194000000000
