```
sage: integrate(exp(-x)*sin(sqrt(x)), x, 0, oo)
integrate(e^(-x)*sin(sqrt(x)), x, 0, +Infinity)

This did work in Sage 5.2.

<a id='comment:4'></a>Current doctest for this bites.

```
    Another symbolic integral, from :trac:`11238`, that used to return
    zero incorrectly; with Maxima 5.26.0 one gets
    ``1/2*sqrt(pi)*e^(1/4)``, whereas with 5.29.1, and even more so
    with 5.33.0, the expression is less pleasant, but still has the
    same value.  Unfortunately, the computation takes a very long time
    with the default settings, so we temporarily use the Maxima
    setting ``domain: real``::

        sage: sage.calculus.calculus.maxima('domain: real')
        real
        sage: f = exp(-x) * sinh(sqrt(x))
        sage: t = integrate(f, x, 0, Infinity); t            # long time
        1/4*sqrt(pi)*(erf(1) - 1)*e^(1/4) - 1/4*(sqrt(pi)*(erf(1) - 1) - sqrt(pi) + 2*e^(-1) - 2)*e^(1/4) + 1/4*sqrt(pi)*e^(1/4) - 1/2*e^(1/4) + 1/2*e^(-3/4)
        sage: t.simplify_exp()  # long time
        1/2*sqrt(pi)*e^(1/4)
        sage: sage.calculus.calculus.maxima('domain: complex')
        complex
```
And the 'long time' is not kidding.

<a id='comment:7'></a>Update: Sage v9.2 can evaluate the integral:

```
sage: integrate(exp(-x)*sin(sqrt(x)), x, 0, oo)                                          
1/2*sqrt(pi)*e^(-1/4)
```
This is not the same answer as previously reported, because the previous calculation has `e^(1/4)`, not `e^(-1/4)`. However, Maple and Wolfram Alpha agree that there should be a minus sign, so probably this is good.

And the calculation is not ridiculously slow (from `%timeit` on `CoCalc`):

```
3.02 s ± 248 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each)
```

I was going to suggest closing this ticket as `WorksForMe`, but then I noticed that the integration fails if we simply multiply the integrand by a constant:

```
sage: integrate(-exp(-x)*sin(sqrt(x)), x, 0, oo)
-integrate(e^(-x)*sin(sqrt(x)), x, 0, +Infinity)
```

<a id='comment:8'></a>FMIW :

```
sage: var("a")
a
sage: f(x)=exp(-x)*sin(sqrt(x))
sage: integrate(f(x),[x,0,oo])
1/2*sqrt(pi)*e^(-1/4)
sage: integrate(f(x),[x,0,oo]).n()
0.690194223521571
sage: numerical_integral(f(x),0,oo)
(0.6901942235198321, 1.3133617826621702e-07)
```

The minus sign seems correct...

```
sage: integrate(a*f(x),[x,0,oo])
a*integrate(e^(-x)*sin(sqrt(x)), x, 0, +Infinity)
```

Indeed... But :

```
sage: integrate(a*f(x),[x,0,oo]).unhold()
1/2*sqrt(pi)*a*e^(-1/4)
```

This might be more general...

Another quirk :

```
sage: integrate(a*f(x),[x,0,oo], algorithm="mathematica_free")
1/2*sqrt(pi)*a*e^(-1/4)
sage: integrate(f(x),[x,0,oo], algorithm="mathematica_free")
0.690194000000000
```
