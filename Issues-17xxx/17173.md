After #17121 it is faster to say `P.is_lattice() and LatticePoset(P).is_distibutive()` than `P._hasse_diagram.is_distributive_lattice()`. However, there exists also fast algorithm to directly check if a given poset is distributive lattice.

This is just a call to `in_degree` in the hasse diagram ! \n\nI also see that you compute 'subposet' very often, and I wonder if you should not compute subgraphs instead, as I expect that it is much more efficient (I beware of the `UniqueRepresentation` stuff)\n\nAlso, you cannot write things like that in Sage code\n\n```\n[x for x in self if not x in self.closed_interval(self.bottom(), m)]\n```\n\nHere is why:\n\n```\nsage: def a():\n....:     print \"Hey\"\n....:     return [1]\n....: [x for x in range(5) if x in a()]\n....: \nHey\nHey\nHey\nHey\nHey\n[1]\n```\n\nWhat you want to do is something like `set(self).difference(self.closed_interval(self.bottom(), m))`\n\nThere is also a broken doctest in `hasse_diagram.py`\n\nOh. And I am just noticing that your function does not seem to be recursive at all: you can replace the recursion by a loop ! First create a copy of self, and at each turn of the loop remove some vertices from the copy you work on.\n\nNathann",

Hello Jori !

A couple of comments:

Please, try to make your code a bit better-looking:

```diff
-if ( not self.is_graded() or not self.is_bounded() or not
-     self.rank() == len([e for e in self if len(self.lower_covers(e))==1]) ==
-     len([e for e in self if len(self.upper_covers(e))==1]) ):
-    return False
-return self._is_distributive_lattice_recursion()
+return (self.is_graded()  and
+        self.is_bounded() and
+        (self.rank() == len([e for e in self if len(self.lower_covers(e))==1])
+                     == len([e for e in self if len(self.upper_covers(e))==1])) and
+        self._is_distributive_lattice_recursion())
```

By the way it is very unpleasant to build the list of upper covers when all you want to do is count its length. This is just a call to `in_degree` in the hasse diagram ! 

I also see that you compute 'subposet' very often, and I wonder if you should not compute subgraphs instead, as I expect that it is much more efficient (I beware of the `UniqueRepresentation` stuff)

Also, you cannot write things like that in Sage code

```
[x for x in self if not x in self.closed_interval(self.bottom(), m)]
```

Here is why:

```
sage: def a():
....:     print "Hey"
....:     return [1]
....: [x for x in range(5) if x in a()]
....: 
Hey
Hey
Hey
Hey
Hey
[1]
```

What you want to do is something like `set(self).difference(self.closed_interval(self.bottom(), m))`

There is also a broken doctest in `hasse_diagram.py`

Oh. And I am just noticing that your function does not seem to be recursive at all: you can replace the recursion by a loop ! First create a copy of self, and at each turn of the loop remove some vertices from the copy you work on.

I need the list. It starts with `x=give_an_array(y)` but if it's length is exactly one, then continues with `z=x[0]`. Or do you mean optimizing it so that if code founds out that `len(self.upper_covers(m)` is at least 2, it returns False?

Hmm... First call to `subposet` can be changed to subgraph and to search of element with in-degree zero.

And yes, this can be also changed to direct loop without recursion. Actually I just copied the algorithm without thinking speed; in any case this should now be almost `O(n)` instead of `O(n^3)` in current version.

But elements can not be removed from poset; vertices can be removed from graph (with right internal implementation). I guess it is faster that way; only code might seem slightly complicated.

If I convert this to loop, I must have a working copy on Hasse diagram. Do I then still have linear extension? I must find a minimal element of subposet containing only meet-irreducible elements, i.e. a meet-irreducible element that is not greater than any other meet-irreducible element. For a poset `P` I can found it just looping throught `P` --- it will give elements by (some) linear extension.

In other words: If `G.vertices()` prints `..., a, ..., b, ...`, can it after `D.delete_edges(...)` print  `..., b, ..., a, ...`? If not, is this guaranteed behaviour in following versions of Sage?

I forgot one place where `minimal_elements()` was computed twice. Otherwise there is no unneeded lists generated in loop.

What about this ?
