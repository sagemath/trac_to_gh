Over non PID domains, the method xgcd might not (and can not in general) return the gcd as its first argument

```
sage: x = polygen(ZZ)
sage: (x+2).gcd(x+4)  # no common factor but...
1
sage: (x+2).xgcd(x+4) # ... the ideal (x+2, x+4) is not principal
(2, -1, 1)
```

See [this sage-devel thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/JV8fCPUqTzo)  where it was suggested to change the method name to `pseudo_xgcd` or `_resultant_xgcd`.

See also #17671 that fix some compatibility issues for gcd/xgcd over PID.

Let me repeat and extend as a comment my remarks on sage-devel, concerning the "literature":

* In almost all books in which I've checked, the extended Euclidean algorithm is only defined for polynomials over fields, and not over rings. This books include 
  - Modern Computer Algebra (von zur Gathen and Gerhard); 
  - The Art of Computer Programming: Semi-Numerical Algorithms (Knuth);
  - A Computational Introduction to Number Theory and Algebra (Shoup);
  - Fundamental problems in algorithmic algebra (Yap).  
  The exception is in 
  - A course in computational number theory (Cohen)
  where there is a mention (as a remark and and exercise) of the extended Euclidean Algorithm in the case of polynomials over UFDs, and the algorithm is suppose to return `g*r`, `s` and `t` where `g` is the GCD and `r` the resultant, and `s` and `t` satisfy `g*r = s*a+t*b` for inputs `a` and `b`.

* For softwares and libraries (inputs are two univariate polynomials `a` and `b` over the integers):
  - Flint: `fmpz_poly_xgcd` computes `r`, `s` and `t` where `r=res(a,b)` and `r=s*a+t*b`;
  - NTL: idem Flint;
  - Mathemagix: the `xgcd`-like function returns an error;
  - Maple17: the function `gcdex` works as if `a` and `b` were defined over the rational numbers;
  - Mathematica (? tested via WolframAlpha): idem Maple17.

Now for my opinion:
* My preferred solution is the one chosen by Flint and NTL, keeping the name `xgcd`;
* If the consensus is to change the name, I would be greatly in favor of a name beginning with `xgcd_...` for completion considerations.

FLINT *does not* use the name `xgcd`, it uses the name `fmpz_poly_xgcd`. This may look like nitpicking, but it's really not. The FLINT call is explicit that it's for `fmpz_poly`: polynomials over `ZZ`. When you use the generic `xgcd` name to mean both the "real" xgcd and the "fake" xgcd-times-resultant depending on the input, that's confusing.
