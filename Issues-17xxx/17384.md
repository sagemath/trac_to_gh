It has been reported by Jean Betrema on sage-devel [1] that building a graph from a dictionary was actually quite slow

```
sage: d=graphs.Grid2dGraph(100,100).to_dictionary()
sage: %time Graph(d)
CPU times: user 2.67 s, sys: 20 ms, total: 2.69 s
Wall time: 2.63 s
Graph on 10000 vertices
```

This does not make any sense, and indeed it only comes from a miswritten line in the code. After this branch is applied, it becomes

```
sage: d=graphs.Grid2dGraph(100,100).to_dictionary()
sage: %time Graph(d)
CPU times: user 104 ms, sys: 4 ms, total: 108 ms
Wall time: 97.2 ms
Graph on 10000 vertices
```
