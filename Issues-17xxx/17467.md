Introduce a new convenience transducer `transducers.map` realizing a function by a transducer.

This complements the transducer `transducers.operator` which did the same for an `n`-ary operators on the input alphabet. While `transducers.operator` formally supports `number_of_operands=1`, it yields a `1`-tuple, which is not convenient.
