In couple of places the conversion from scipy complex number to Sage is done via strings, which is probably some old relic going back to 2008 or so.

As well, the type of the returned number is default Sage's data, rather than C/RDF, as it should be, to avoid confusion about precision of these computations, cf e.g. http://ask.sagemath.org/question/24163/why-does-sage-offer-unusable-scipy
