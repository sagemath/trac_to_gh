Currently (and even with #10668), there is a generic call method for homsets that is not really useful, as it does not make any use of element classes or other ingredients of the "usual" framework for making a parent callable. In particular, homsets typically override `__call__`, which means that we can not benefit from a generic coercion model.

This ticket aims at providing a generic call method for homsets (similarly to what we have for parents) and use it in *all* concrete implementations of homsets.

Depends on #10668

A comment from #10668, what Nicolas would like to have:

---
For `A` a parent, `A.hom(on_basis = [data],...)` would call
`A.morphism_on_basis(data,...)`. This `morphism_on_basis` could
typically be implemented in `A`, or in `C.ParentMethods` for `C` the
category of `A`.

There are 5-6 explicit hom functions in Sage that would need to be
generalized to accept this syntax, while keeping backward
compatibility if no keyword is specified.

I am not totally sure whether I would like that change. The `A.hom(data, B)` method should, in my opinion, be a short-cut for `A.Hom(B)(data)`, and it should be the responsibility of the homset to process the data (by means of `_element_constructor_`). I would like to have everything as close to what we have for parents as possible. So, `_element_constructor_` and friends should be used.
