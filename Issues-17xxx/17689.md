Hello,

Very cool to start that! Here are just potential improvements to discuss. This is not a complete review and I think it would be nice if several people actually read it.

* For `%prun` would be cool to explain a little bit the columns. In particular why there is twice "percall".

* In `%prun` what do you mean by 'critical functions'?

* The following does not work for me
 {{{
  sage: %prun -r random_prime(2**500)
  sage: stats_object = _
  sage: stats.total_calls
  2547
  Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
  AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'total_calls'
 }}}

* The `runsnake` program is curiously contained in the package `runsnakerun` on debian-like os. More generally, it would be cool to say on standard OS what are the packages to install. Right now it is only the case for `perf`.

* For perf you need to launch the process before launching it??

Hello,

>  * For `%prun` would be cool to explain a little bit the columns. In particular why there is twice "percall".


I added a link for that. I am trying to keep this document "short and efficient" and to give users an idea of where to look for what they need, without documenting other people's code.

>  * In `%prun` what do you mean by 'critical functions'?


I meant 'performance-critical'. I rephrased it.

>  * The following does not work for me


The second 'stats' should be 'stats_object'. Fixed.

>  * The `runsnake` program is curiously contained in the package `runsnakerun` on debian-like os. More generally, it would be cool to say on standard OS what are the packages to install. Right now it is only the case for `perf`.


I added this information for 'perf' because 'perf' is a very common keyword in softwares, and that it is actually non-trivial to find out that it is part of linux-tools unless you more or less know what to look for.

To find out that 'runsnake' is included in the 'runsnakerun' debian package you need to type 'runsnake debian' in google (samek for ubuntu), and probably for most others. I fear that if I add one people will come from Fedora, archlinux and who knows what else to add totally trivial information.

```
~$ apt-cache search runsnake
runsnakerun - GUI utility for (Python) cProfile or Profile profiler dumps
```

>  * For perf you need to launch the process before launching it??


No need. This thing is a wonder.

Hello,

I like the functional way of using `timeit`

```
sage: timeit("for i in range(2,100): _ = is_prime(i)")
625 loops, best of 3: 964 µs per loop
```
Especially because it allows you to tune the parameters

```
sage: timeit("for i in range(2,100): _ = is_prime(i)", number=137, precision=3)
137 loops, best of 3: 1.05 ms per loop
```
And even better, I like `sage_timeit` that allows you to play with the results (which is useful if you want to benchmark several implementations)

```
sage: from sage.misc.sage_timeit import sage_timeit
sage: t = sage_timeit("for i in range(2,100): _ = is_prime(i)", globals_dict=globals())
sage: t.stats
(625, 3, 3, 924.3534088134766, '\xc2\xb5s')
sage: t.series
[0.0009369647979736328, 0.0009340656280517578, 0.0009243534088134766]
```
What do you think of having it mentioned?

Vincent

Would it be a problem for you if this documentation appeared in the docstring of `sage_timeit` (or its module)? Documenting the various arguments, their effects and uses is the job of the function's documentation.

We could then add a link from the tutorial to these places so that the interested user finds them.

I meant this page to be an overview of the different means to profile code in Sage, as it is difficult to find "timeit/prun/lprun/crun/perf" if you do not know the name already. With this page, people interested in profiling will find all the keywords they need, and links toward the specific documentations.

This doc is very nice. Below are some comments / problems.

* `Note that while %time only runs the command once, timeit tries to return a more meaningful value over several runs.` -> shouldn't you write `%timeit` instead ?

* The `runsnake` command is not working on my mac, and the reported problem is not always the same :( Is this a known issue?

Yo,

> * `Note that while %time only runs the command once, timeit tries to return a more meaningful value over several runs.` -> shouldn't you write `%timeit` instead ?


Fixed.

> * The `runsnake` command is not working on my mac, and the reported problem is not always the same :( Is this a known issue?


I don't know. There are two tickets that I know about `runsnake`: #17735 and #14414.

> * `%crun`: I have very different output. Is it normal ?


No idea. It looks like Python may have been compiled with different flags, but I do not know enough to answer that. I expect that the function will still be useful when the most time-consuming entries are Sage functions and not those internal Python functions.

> * As we already discussed, you may add a link to http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13075113/is-there-anyway-to-read-performance-counters-on-os-x-mountain-lion/13075880#13075880.


I prefer to not add a link toward a tutorial I cannot test myself.

I am a bit overloaded right now to help more on this interesting and important ticket, but as such, there is a big confusion between ipython `%timeit` and Sage `timeit`, so `%timeit` has nothing to do with `timeit <sage.misc.sage_timeit_class>`. A problem with `%timeit` is that it is ipython only, so it will not work in Sage notebook (that does not rely on ipython). So you need at least to point to the right documentations for the two different `timeit`, see `timeit?` vs `%timeit?`.

For example, with the Sage `timeit()` command, you can not do:

```
sage: timeit(factor(1234567890))
AttributeError: 'IntegerFactorization' object has no attribute 'lstrip'
```

You have to do

```
sage: timeit("factor(1234567890)")
625 loops, best of 3: 72.8 µs per loop
```

But then, with ipython:

```
sage: %timeit("factor(1234567890)")
10000000 loops, best of 3: 26.3 ns per loop
```

Which is much faster... Indeed, it measures the time for creating the string ! What you have to do instead is:

```
sage: %timeit(factor(1234567890))
10000 loops, best of 3: 59.2 µs per loop
```

or

```
sage: %timeit factor(1234567890)
10000 loops, best of 3: 59.5 µs per loop
```

So there is a confusion that can lead to a silent misuse. It think this distinction should be made clear.

As I did not even use `timeit` in the examples I chose to remove this link toward Sage's timeit function. We still link toward Python's timeit function.

All examples in this document use `%` functions, and the last one requires a terminal, so notebook users are already a bit out of scope.
