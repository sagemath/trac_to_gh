In Sage, we have `parent_c` defined in 4 places, remove all except for `sage/structure/element.pxd`

We copy a short-cut from `sage/symbolic/function.pxd` for [numbers](https://docs.python.org/2/c-api/number.html) not inheriting from `Element` (in particular Python `int` and `float`): we assume that these do not have a parent.

According to Python documentation

```
int PyNumber_Check(PyObject *o)
    Returns 1 if the object o provides numeric protocols,
    and false otherwise. This function always succeeds.
```
So even sage integers, floating points numbers and many others will answer true to that (I checked). And from the specification I do not see how such test can be fast. I do not have anything against using `PyNumber_Check` but the associated comment is definitely not appropriate.

Related question: why should we check for a method `.parent()`? Would the following be invalid?

```
cdef parent_c(x):
    if isintance(x, Element):
        return (<Element> x)._parent
    else:
        return type(x)
```

I don't understand your comment. As far as I understand `PyNumber_Check` should amount to check if the corresponding `PyTypeObject`'s `tp_as_number` is non-`NULL`, and that should indeed be pretty fast.

You are definitely right

```
int
PyNumber_Check(PyObject *o)
{
    return o && o->ob_type->tp_as_number &&
           (o->ob_type->tp_as_number->nb_int ||
        o->ob_type->tp_as_number->nb_float);
}
```
... (but it answers `True` on much more instances than only int/float) ...

Most important is the other question: why should we return `x.parent()` if it is not an element?
