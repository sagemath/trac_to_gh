No hurry. This one would have "extremely trivial" priority if we would have it.

In future I'll try to make slightly bigger chunks when correcting minor things like this one.

Hello again !

Two comments:

1) I'm sorry to say that if you write `raise ValueError, message` the same guys who complained about your "x <> y" last time will come and tell you that it is not "PEP-<whatever>". Could you change it into `raise ValueError("message")` ?

2) I do not believe that you need to modify `finite_poset` at all. Indeed, one function calls the other, so if there is anything wrong with respect to `direction` an exception will be raised anyway. What do you think ?

Btw, if `raise type, text` is against some PEP, then also http://www.sagemath.org/doc/thematic_tutorials/tutorial-programming-python.html#control-structures should be changed.

Also at least on `graphs/graph_plot.py` function `layout_tree` should be changed, see parameter `orientation`. I left that for now.
