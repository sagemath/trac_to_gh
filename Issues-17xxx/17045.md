No hurry. This one would have "extremely trivial" priority if we would have it.

<a id='comment:9'></a>Hello again !

Two comments:

1) I'm sorry to say that if you write `raise ValueError, message` the same guys who complained about your "x <> y" last time will come and tell you that it is not "PEP-<whatever>". Could you change it into `raise ValueError("message")` ?

2) I do not believe that you need to modify `finite_poset` at all. Indeed, one function calls the other, so if there is anything wrong with respect to `direction` an exception will be raised anyway. What do you think ?
