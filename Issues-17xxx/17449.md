As discussed on sage-devel [1], the two function `Graph.to_partition` and `Poset.to_graph` do not have a very meaningful name.

As `Poset.to_graph` can be obtained from the clearer alternatives `Graph(Poset.hasse_diagram())` or `Poset.hasse_diagram().to_undirected()` it is not a problem to remove it. On the other hand, the discussion on sage-devel seemed to indicate that `Graph.to_partition` should be renamed rather than removed.

Also, as it appeared that people were more interested in the size of connected components than in the actual `Partition` object, the new function will only return a list of integers.

Hi Travis,

It was emphasized in the discussion on sage-devel that `to_graph` is ambiguous. What about `coverings_digraph` (or `to_coverings_digraph`) as an alias for `hasse_diagram` as it was proposed by Jori ?

Also it is incorrect to say that there is a "natural" conversion to graph: there is none, because there are many ways to obtain a graph/digraph. None is canonical.

Furthermore, we want to remove `to_graph` because properly named methods already exist:

```
sage: p = Poset()
sage: p.incomparability_graph()
Incomparability graph on 0 vertices
sage: p.hasse_diagram()
Digraph on 0 vertices
```

Why would we keep a misnamed function when we already have two which do the job right ?

We can already see that a Poset can be converted into a graph from the list of Poset methods. And a non-expert user who would miss `.hasse_diagram` (because it does not contain the word 'graph') will not miss `incomparability_graph`.

With all this, I am sorry that I do not understand why you would want to keep this `to_graph` function.

Hello,

> If you thing the name is ambiguous (which is what I understand your argument to be), then my counter is to put more into the documentation. If you think this is not sufficient, then you propose an alternative name.

Sorry, but I still do not understand why you believe that this function can be useful to anyone. If it is only to advertise that Posets can be turned into graphs, isn't `.incomparability_graph` already doing the job ?

The only new name I can think of is `.undirected_hasse_diagram`, but with `.hasse_diagram()` around we hardly need it.

I do not understand why you fight so hard for this. I do not see it.

It is a different graph than (in)comparability graph, but the `to_graph` is a natural construction.

> The only new name I can think of is `.undirected_hasse_diagram`, but with `.hasse_diagram()` around we hardly need it.

Why? Because it's a one-line function? Then we should get rid of more one-line functions too. Just because you don't see the use, doesn't mean there isn't one.

> I do not understand why you fight so hard for this. I do not see it.

I don't understand your vendetta against this function either. It doesn't hurt anyone as it clearly documents what it does.

I do believe that it does harm by being there. It is not a function that should ever be used in Sage or by anyone else, as other ways exist to get the same result and because its name is unclear: we could very well decide to make it return a different graph later, the function would still be correct as ".to_graph()" would still turn the Poset into "a graph".

Somehow, I think that it all boils down to not say "the integer" but "an integer" when "the integer" is not uniquely determined. It would be nice if Sage had this level of strictness unless it really goes in the way of readability.

Would you be willing, despite everything, to let us procede with the removal of this function ? The considerations above matter to me, and also to some extent to the other persons who concurred on the sage-devel thread.
