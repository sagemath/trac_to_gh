IPython upstream decided to replace `_safe_repr()` with plain `repr()`: [https://github.com/ipython/ipython/commit/ee5477092243c6994ec021dc5d98b773d99ef7f2](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/commit/ee5477092243c6994ec021dc5d98b773d99ef7f2)

Since we'll probably upgrade to IPython 3.0.0 sooner or later, let's make remove the use of `_safe_repr()` in Sage now. Due to Sage's use of `warn_format_error`, it's better to re-implement `_safe_repr()` in Sage instead of simply replacing `_safe_repr()` by `repr()`.
