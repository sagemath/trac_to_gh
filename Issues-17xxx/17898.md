Keywords: stopgap, partitions

Currently the stopgap on IntegerListsLex pops up in many functions and classes, where IntegerListsLex is used in the correct parameter range. This ticket moves the stopgap to the user level and implements further checks on the validity of the input parameters for IntegerListsLex.

Here are examples where the message currently appears without reference to IntegerListsLex:

```

Hello everybody,

Sorry to interrupt, but I believe that what is being done by this code is not
advisable for Sage. You make several points in the ticket's description that I
will now try to answer.

The function `IntegersListsLex` returns unexpected results

    1) Indeed, as shown on #17637, one can get:

    {{{
    sage: Partitions(5, min_slope=1).list()
    ValueError: [2, 4] is not a valid partition
    sage: IntegerListsLex(5, length=3, max_slope=0).list()   # 0 is allowed in the partition
    [[5, 0, 0], [4, 1, 0], [3, 2, 0], [3, 1, 1], [2, 2, 1]]
    sage: IntegerListsLex(5, max_slope=0).list()             # now its not
    [[5], [4, 1], [3, 2], [3, 1, 1], [2, 2, 1], [2, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]]
    }}}

    2) Another example comes from the documentation of `IntegersListsLex` itself

    {{{
    In the following example, the slope condition is not satisfied
    by the upper bound on the parts, and ``[3,3]`` is erroneously
    included in the result::

        sage: list(IntegerListsLex(6, max_part=3, max_slope=-1))
        [[3, 3], [3, 2, 1]]
    }}}

Returning wrong results should be considered as a bug

    The fact that the docstring of this function reads that "several constraints
    must be satisfied by the input, lest the output be incorrect" is not a
    sufficient protection.

    1) This function can be (and is) called by other functions. Thus, users cannot
    be expected to read the documentation of `IntegerListsLex`.

    2) In general, a simple line in the documentation in a function is not a
    sufficient protection against wrong results. This is the reason why these
    'stopgap' tickets exist.

    3) It took me a couple of hours to realise that I was not able to write a
    code that checks that the input of `IntegerListsLex` is satisfiable. I
    take it as a proof that checking it is non-trivial (at least for me). I
    cannot expect users to check something that I am not able to check
    myself.

Some functions which call `IntegerListsLex` are actually correct

    I agree with you that in some cases the `IntegersListsLex` function seems to
    return correct results. This is not, however, a sufficient reason to remove a
    stopgap whose purpose is to warn users against *possible* wrong results.

An alternative way out

    As I understand that you may be bothered by those warnings, which appear in
    any function that calls `IntegersListsLex` and thus in your code too,
    perhaps you could go over some of the use cases of `IntegerListsLex` that
    are of interest to you, and only remove the stopgap message after you have
    convinced yourself that the function is indeed correct in these situations?

    {{{
    if (some_situation_that_was_checked):
        pass
    else:
        <stopgap code>
    }}}

    The message would still be shown in other (unchecked) cases, and thus only
    in dangerous situations.

A long-term fix

    As you say in this ticket's description, a real check should be implemented
    at the head of `IntegerListsLex`, or the function itself should should be 
    reimplemented.

    I gave the first option a try already, and I remember rather well the knots
    it made in my head, as I was going over all ways in which the parameters can
    be combined. Checking that they are consistent is nontrivial.

    It convinced me that this function already accepts an unhealthy amount
    of parameters, and that we will not be able to write a function that handles
    all that efficiently and correctly. I believe that we should split this
    function into many, that will handle well each combination of parameters
    that interests us.

    If possible in Cython, for the most useful computations. That would not be a
    terribly hard work, in particular for your own code which (I believe)
    enumerates only partitions.

Hello Travis,

> Bad input is not a bug. Ever.


When we are not able to write a piece of code that checks whether the input is bad, I believe that it is a bug.

> If you feel that something needs better documentation [...]


I do not. I believe that the wrong results that this function returns are dangerous, and that the users should be warned.

I also proposed that you would only change this code to *not* display the warning in situations that have been checked for correction, and I would like to know why this does not satisfy you.

> Also that first example is correct; it's subtle because of the trailing 0's, but it is correct.


It is an unexpected output. This example is not, however, the only one I provided. Perhaps you will accept the other lines as legit bugs?

> You speak of unhealthy amount of stuff into 1 class, but IIRC you've also said that (`Di`)`Graph` needs to be one class. If you have a problem with this class, then fix it instead of saying nothing works (which is completely false).


This is totally unrelated, but since you ask I highly doubt that I ever suggested that. Indeed, this is the purpose of `GenericGraph`.

I will write to sage-devel in a second to ask for everybody's advice on this matter. Please, wait for this discussion to take place before setting this ticket back to `positive_review`.

The stopgap that is currently in Sage now pops up all over Sage in situations where IntegerListsLex is used within the range of parameters and hence totally fine. It just scares users unnecessarily. Also, it does not point the user to the documentation where the limitations are listed. Hence the current stopgap in Sage, in my opinion, does more harm than good!

I agree with all of this, but just removing the stopgap isn't the right solution.

But having an interface that declares some input "bad" and other input "good" in a way that makes it hard to decide in which category your input falls is bad design, which is perhaps not a "bug" in the sense that a specification is not followed, but is certainly a "bug" in that it makes the interface very hard to use correctly.

As far as I can see, pretty much arbitrary combinations of the input parameters make sense mathematically. It might just be that they specify an empty or hard (impossible?) to enumerate set.
Thus, the routine really only provides a partial implementation of the *suggested* interface.

There are probably plenty of cases (all the ones where other code calls this routine?) where you *know* your parameters lie inside the "valid" part of the parameter space. Probably because you know that a certain easily described subset lies in the "valid" part.

As Nathann suggests, just first test if the parameters are "known good". If not, either don't accept the parameters (i.e., raise an error) or print a toned-down warning:

```
Warning: IntegerListsLex is called with input parameters for which it is not guaranteed to produce correct output

Hello Anne,

> It just scares users unnecessarily.


I totally agree with that.

I asked in my earlier comment whether you could, instead of removing the stopgap, only raise it in case that have not been checked for correctness. I do not understand why this proposal has been ignored. To me, it sounds like the best way out: you would not see it in case for which you know the code is correct, and we would see it when there is a risk. Isn't it all good for everyone?

Replying to [comment:4 tscrim]:
> Bad input is not a bug. Ever.


The documentation is inconsistent on this part for release 6.5. It has one example about "wrong" output

```
    In the following example, the slope condition is not satisfied
    by the upper bound on the parts, and ``[3,3]`` is erroneously
    included in the result::

        sage: list(IntegerListsLex(6, max_part=3, max_slope=-1))
        [[3, 3], [3, 2, 1]]
```
However, the conditions mentioned just above:

```
       - The upper and lower bounds themselves should satisfy the
         slope constraints.

       - The maximal and minimal slopes values should not be equal.

       - The maximal and minimal part values should not be equal.
```
don't mention any restrictions on `max_part`. In fact, it's not documented as possible input at all, so I can't even verify why the output above is wrong:

```
    INPUT:

    - ``n`` -- a non negative integer
    - ``min_length`` -- a non negative integer
    - ``max_length`` -- an integer or `\infty`
    - ``length`` -- an integer; overrides min_length and max_length if
      specified
    - ``floor`` -- a function `f` (or list);    defaults to ``lambda i: 0``
    - ``ceiling`` -- a function `f` (or list);  defaults to
      ``lambda i: infinity``
    - ``min_slope`` -- an integer or `-\infty`; defaults to `-\infty`
    - ``max_slope`` -- an integer or `+\infty`; defaults to `+\infty`

    An *integer list* is a list `l` of nonnegative integers, its
    *parts*. The *length* of `l` is the number of its parts;
    the *sum* of `l` is the sum of its parts.
```
and the meaning of `max_part` and `min_part` is not documented (not on the effect they have on the generated sequence either)

so ... the stopgap might be screaming a bit loudly, but it doesn't look wrong to me.

Hello Anne,

I know that the `Partition` code is used in many places, and I expect that your crystal code tests it extensively. I have to say, however, that I do not trust it very much myself: e.g. I wrote #15467 when I noticed that providing values for 'parts_in', 'starting' and 'ending' lead Sage to ignore two among the three.

I believe that this code should be rewritten from scratch, carefully, and more simply (with less combinations of parameters). That would also most definitely lead to speedups.

Why didn't either of you do so to begin with? Instead you both got us into this sad situation. So yet again, I had to spend my time and energy fixing this ridiculous stopgap in order for Sage not to look like it doesn't even work for simple and common combinatorial objects. I am tired of being forced into these things because someone wants to swing a hatchet around on a soapbox.

Hello Travis,

Your current branch removes the stopgap in all cases, despite not properly checking all input (which I do not think can be done). Jeroen and I (if I did not misunderstand his position) stand for something like that:

1) If the set of parameters satisfy constraints for which we know that `IntegerListsLex` works, then do the job without warning
2) Otherwise, raise a warning

This is the safest path, as we have examples of what you would call bad/misleading input that should not be accepted by this function.

If I understand the intent behind your patch, you believe that `IntegerListsLex` is used correctly by all of Sage's functions, and that we are only at risk when users call it directly, with possibly wrong input. Thus only the 'public' version of `IntegerListsLex` will raise the stopgap, and all internal calls will be silent. I believe that it is dangerous too, for many user-exposed functions call `IntegerListsLex`  (and so bypass `IntegerListsLexPublic`), and may also return wrong output. I am not sure that all internal calls to `IntegerListsLex` are safe and checked either.

To answer one of your earlier question, I personally did not implement this conditional stopgap  because I do not know any restriction of the parameters for which I could swear that only trustworthy results will ever be returned. If you know such a combination and find a reviewer who double-checks it, however, that is a good way out for this ticket.

Hi Nathann,

You agreed that it is very damaging to Sage that a message pops up in many use cases where there is no bug known saying "This code contains bugs and may be mathematically unreliable." The message of the stopgap is also not informative at all saying that this is related to IntegerListsLex. If someone uses Partitions or crystals and this message pops up, they will think it is related to their object, which it is not.

Since this is really a User input issue (and no bugs seem to be known in the valid input range), I think the implemented solution is the best. Also note that the stopgap message does not show up when running tests on the sage tree. Hence your desire to have this message pop up in all cases anyway does not seem to apply for developers (who run tests).

Anne, Travis,

Isn't it more important to make sure that our software returns correct results ?

I agree that this warning can be worrying to the users, but I would be even more worried to learn that we start hiding stopgap to pretend that everything is fine when it is not.

We have in Sage a stopgap for a function that does return wrong results, and this is healthy. I do not understand why you keep saying that "there are no bugs" either. This example comes from the documentation, and is a bug to me:

```
        sage: list(IntegerListsLex(6, max_part=3, max_slope=-1))
        [[3, 3], [3, 2, 1]]
```

Hiding a warning to protect our "public image" is no responsible way of doing things. And we, developers, need to know when we call a buggy functions, as much as the other users do.

You would not try to hide an error in a fundamental lemma you need in a scientific paper, would you? This is how we mathematicians/computer scientists should be doing our job: with absolute respect for correction and accuracy.

Now, I understand that you may not like to see such a warning raised by your code, and you have in front of you many possibilities to change that:
- Include the name of the faulty function is the stopgap warning: "The function IntegerListsLex is knows to return wrong result [...]". It would actually be a nice improvement to stopgap in general.
- Not show the warning for inputs that have been checked to be correct
- Rewrite a small function to enumerate only the objects that you need, i.e. without having to handle all the parameters at once.

Please. Let us try to find a way to fix this responsibly, and stop playing this "positive review/needs work" game.

Nathann

"I'm too lazy to fix this bug" is not a valid excuse for not fixing a bug. Sage development is not just about adding new features, sometimes you also need to maintain and improve the quality of existing code.

I assume you're talking about the docstring. Before I wrote [comment:13] I seriously tried looking at the specifications of the functions to see if I could find some admissible subset of the parameter space for which membership was easy to check, because I suspected that nearly all practical use of the routine picks parameters from this easily tested space (after all, when the code was written someone checked the parameters would always be valid and it seems unlikely they were able to do so using some deep result).

I hate to get involved in this because the level of discourse is not up to Sage's usual standards.

Replying to [comment:43 tscrim]:
> The first one is documented:


This is not actually clear to me. I think by "the first one" you mean `Compositions(6, max_part=3, max_slope=-1).list()`, but the note could be viewed as just discussing inner and outer partitions which have not been explicitly specified. The note is not very prominent, in any case, and other similar cases have no such accompanying warning in the documentation:

```
sage: Compositions(6, max_part=3, max_slope=-1).list() # "documented"
[[3, 3], [3, 2, 1]]
sage: list(IntegerVectors(6, max_part=3, max_slope=-1, min_part=1)) # not documented: a bug
[[3, 3], [3, 2, 1]]
```
Is `length` a valid option for `IntegerVectors`?

```
sage: list(IntegerVectors(4, length=3, min_part=1)) # a bug?
[[4], [3, 1], [2, 2], [2, 1, 1], [1, 3], [1, 2, 1], [1, 1, 2], [1, 1, 1, 1]
```
And as an aside, something for a separate ticket, there is

```
sage: list(IntegerVectors(6, max_part=3, max_slope=-1, min_part=1))
[[3, 3], [3, 2, 1]]
sage: IntegerVectors(6, max_part=3, max_slope=-1, min_part=1).list()

```
Why does `list(...)` work differently from `(...).list`? 

Anyway, the fact that the documentation for `IntegerVectors` lists none of the options is not acceptable. The docstring includes the definition `IntegerVectors(n=None, k=None, **kwargs)`, and not only does it list none of the keyword arguments, it doesn't even say what `n` and `k` mean. As has already been pointed out, the documentation for `IntegerListsLex` doesn't list `max_part` in its possible inputs. The documentation for `Compositions` doesn't list any of the inputs. It does say `See also "Composition", "Partitions", "IntegerVectors"`, the documentation of one of which discusses the options. (It should probably say `See "Partitions" for a description of the available options`, or something like that.) The state of the documentation is terrible, and it seems clear that whoever wrote and reviewed this code was not thinking about how anyone would actually use it.

(I also think that any docstring that discusses slope should define it the way the docstring for `IntegerListsLex` does (explicitly saying `l[i+1]-l[i]`) rather than the way the docstring for `Partitions` does (`the difference between successive parts`, because that could mean `l[i+1]-l[i]` or its negative or possibly its absolute value). This is made more confusing by an example in the `Partitions` documentation about a partition whose "parts differ by at least 2", which sounds like `min_slope=2`, but is actually `max_slope=-2`.)

From this point of view, the idea of a stopgap is pretty mild: we could actually be discussing ripping all of this code out of Sage until its documentation, and probably its input checking, is in good shape. We shouldn't rip it out, of course, but this part of Sage definitely needs work.

Last commit fixes some bad branch management on my part. *ahem*

So after some more thought, Jeroen's second example is actually bad input because the floor condition does not satisfy the `min_slope` condition, so it is not a bug in that sense. That is what I get for trying to do this as I'm running out the door.

Now my most recent changes does some fixing and hacking to better handle things, now it raises some errors on bad input, and has documentation for the `IntegerListsLexPublic` class (I thought python simply inherited the docstring like sphinx does). This is more than a fair compromise and allows Sage to not scare away people from more common functionality.

`@`ncohen First, look at what you wrote. Second, I just reverted back to positive review in accordance with my viewpoint.

John, I completely agree with you, this code is not in good shape. Instead of implementing input checking, I think one should probably rewrite it from scratch. However, this ticket is about the stopgap itself. The current message it displays is not really useful, especially when it pops up in code that uses IntegerListsLex in seemingly valid regions.

The good thing is that this whole discussion brings up many of the issues with the IntegerListsLex code.
