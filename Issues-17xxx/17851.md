I have been working a lot on Cython-related tickets lately and I cannot count anymore the number of times a problem would go away after doing

```
$ rm -rf ~/.cycache
```

Conclusion: cycache is too broken and we should disable it.

In particular, the following two bugs are very nasty:
* [http://trac.cython.org/ticket/842](http://trac.cython.org/ticket/842)
* [http://trac.cython.org/ticket/844](http://trac.cython.org/ticket/844)

And then there is also this one:
* [http://trac.cython.org/ticket/837](http://trac.cython.org/ticket/837)

What about somebody adding a new cython extension to Sage?

That has nothing to do with this ticket.

This is about when the Cython version (for example, recently 0.21.1 -> 0.22) changes or when the compiler directives (in #17847 for example `embedsignature=True`, or `debug` or `profile`) change. In such cases, we really need to re-Cythonize everything. To avoid Cython using the cycache, we delete it.

One last thing. Sage uses the global cython cache which seems to be located in `~/.cycache`. Which means that Sage shares its Cython cache with the native Cython. If you delete the cache, you also delete the non Sage part of the cache as well right?

But you can be working on a much bigger project than Sage with much more Cython files. And then, it would be reasonable to not expect that Sage just delete your cache... Actually I even find weird that Sage ships its own cython and pollutes the native cython cache.

Like I said, losing the cache is just a minor inconvenience... Having Sage not compile because Cython takes the wrong files from the cache is a much bigger problem.

Of the course the ideal solution would be if somebody fixed [http://trac.cython.org/ticket/842](http://trac.cython.org/ticket/842), but I'm not able to do that.

(by the way: "a much bigger project than Sage with much more Cython files", does that even exist?)

If Cython's built in caching is a no-go, what about a simple mechanism for storing the hashes of Cython modules when they're compiled, so that Cython modules can always be compared to the hash of at least the last version that was compiled?

IMHO, that's a `git` bug that it changes timestamps unneeded.
