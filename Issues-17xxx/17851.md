I have been working a lot on Cython-related tickets lately and I cannot count anymore the number of times a problem would go away after doing

```
$ rm -rf ~/.cycache
```

Conclusion: cycache is too broken and we should disable it.

In particular, the following two bugs are very nasty:
* [http://trac.cython.org/ticket/842](http://trac.cython.org/ticket/842)
* [http://trac.cython.org/ticket/844](http://trac.cython.org/ticket/844)

And then there is also this one:
* [http://trac.cython.org/ticket/837](http://trac.cython.org/ticket/837)

That has nothing to do with this ticket.

This is about when the Cython version (for example, recently 0.21.1 -> 0.22) changes or when the compiler directives (in #17847 for example `embedsignature=True`, or `debug` or `profile`) change. In such cases, we really need to re-Cythonize everything. To avoid Cython using the cycache, we delete it.

One solution would be to change the default Sage Cython cache, let say `~/.sage/cycache/`. But I am not convinced by this solution.

But you can be working on a much bigger project than Sage with much more Cython files. And then, it would be reasonable to not expect that Sage just delete your cache... Actually I even find weird that Sage ships its own cython and pollutes the native cython cache.

Like I said, losing the cache is just a minor inconvenience... Having Sage not compile because Cython takes the wrong files from the cache is a much bigger problem.

Of the course the ideal solution would be if somebody fixed [http://trac.cython.org/ticket/842](http://trac.cython.org/ticket/842), but I'm not able to do that.

(by the way: "a much bigger project than Sage with much more Cython files", does that even exist?)

IMHO, that's a `git` bug that it changes timestamps unneeded.

I don't think it's really a bug, though one could call it a lack of a feature that it doesn't support preserving timestamps.
