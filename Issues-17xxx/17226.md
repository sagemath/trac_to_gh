Good.

Then I mark this as needs_review. I also added this and `maximal_sublattices()` to index of functions.

I put the symbol of Frattini sublattice to documentation. Maybe it helps the reader, maybe not? I also use definition where Frattini sublattice of a lattice without proper sublattices (i.e. 1-element lattice) is the lattice itself. Compare to Frattini subgroup of 1-element group.

I did not found any good and simple example. But they can be added later.
