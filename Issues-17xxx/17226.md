Add a function that computes the Frattini sublattice, i.e. intersection of all proper sublattices of a lattice. AFAIK there is no known good algorithm for this. Maybe making even a slow function will make it easier to search for one.

Travis, you might want to check this. I think that I did something wrong, as there is now included code for `maximal_sublattices()`, which should be only dependence. But at least you can see the new function.

It is not easy to find good example lattice. I'll continue searching. Maybe something with three maximal sublattices and so that the Frattini sublattice will something more than just a chain, but not almost all elements.

Replying to [tscrim](#comment%3A7):
> No, what you did is correct.

Good.

Then I mark this as needs_review. I also added this and `maximal_sublattices()` to index of functions.

I put the symbol of Frattini sublattice to documentation. Maybe it helps the reader, maybe not? I also use definition where Frattini sublattice of a lattice without proper sublattices (i.e. 1-element lattice) is the lattice itself. Compare to Frattini subgroup of 1-element group.

I did not found any good and simple example. But they can be added later.

Btw, creation of a lattice always [pre]computes join and meet matrices. Now, a function returning lattice could precompute them faster - in this case just by taking right rows and colums from the matrices of original lattice.

This is not done here. I suppose that we got faster lattice creation in the future.

Once that's done, go ahead and set a positive review on my behalf. Thanks.

I agree that using the join and meet matrices of the ambient lattice could be used to speedup sublattice creation. However, as you said, this would be a separate ticket.
