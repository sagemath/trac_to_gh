Implement `gcd()` for number fields analogous to `factor()`.

The `gcd()` of two algebraic integers doesn't always make sense, but if it exists (in particular, if the class number is 1), then `a.gcd(b)` should work.

<a id='comment:11'></a>Hello,

Note that the behavior of `gcd` for `QQ` is quite special

```
sage: gcd(1/3, 2/3)
1/3
```
It is the implementation provided by the category `QuotientFields`. It would be different from

```
sage: K = NumberField(x-1, 'a')
sage: K(1/3).gcd(K(2/3))
1
```
I do not care so much as it is specified in the documentation. But a number field is always the quotient field of its maximal order... Do you think we should care?

Vincent

The problem is that a `gcd()` is not always defined for maximal orders in number fields (if the class number is not 1). So we cannot simply use the fraction field implementation. And for consistency, I don't want to treat the class-number=1 case differently.
