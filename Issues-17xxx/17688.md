I checked that the tarball provided in the description is the same as the one on the github site. The doctests in my non-merged tickets using arb (#17263 and its dependencies) pass.

Marc have you checked that arb is passing its own test suite (spkg-check)? I am fairly sure it won't because there is no release of flint2 with the right function for the testsuite not to fail. You would need a git checkout or someone making a new release of flint.

I have decided to make an ebuild of arb for gentoo (in the sage-on-gentoo overlay) and I got this when running "make check"

```
/home/extra/portage/sci-mathematics/arb-2.5.0/temp/ccLcbPFS.o: In function `acb_modular_epsilon_arg_naive':
/home/extra/portage/sci-mathematics/arb-2.5.0/work/arb-2.5.0/acb_modular/test/t-epsilon_arg.c:52: undefined reference to `fmpq_dedekind_sum'

../Makefile.subdirs:78: recipe for target '../build/acb_modular/test/t-epsilon_arg' failed

```
No stable release of flint has fmpq_dedekind_sum in flint 2.4.4 as shipped with sage. It is still arith_dedekind_sum. And of course that's were it stopped, there could be more.

Replying to [fbissey](#comment%3A8):
> Marc have you checked that arb is passing its own test suite (spkg-check)? I am fairly sure it won't because there is no release of flint2 with the right function for the testsuite not to fail. You would need a git checkout or someone making a new release of flint.


No, I haven't. I usually don't do touch spkgs and I didn't think it was relevant. Feel free to set the ticket back to `needs_work`, or set its milestone to `pending` depending what you think is appropriate. Thanks for the comment!

I feel compelled to put it back to "needs_work" which is almost certainly what Volker would do especially if he reads my comments. Te merge window for non-critical stuff in 6.5 is closed anyway so it is a matter for the next release.
