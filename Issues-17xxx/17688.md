Marc have you checked that arb is passing its own test suite (spkg-check)? I am fairly sure it won't because there is no release of flint2 with the right function for the testsuite not to fail. You would need a git checkout or someone making a new release of flint.

I have decided to make an ebuild of arb for gentoo (in the sage-on-gentoo overlay) and I got this when running "make check"

```

No stable release of flint has fmpq_dedekind_sum in flint 2.4.4 as shipped with sage. It is still arith_dedekind_sum. And of course that's were it stopped, there could be more.
