Marc have you checked that arb is passing its own test suite (spkg-check)? I am fairly sure it won't because there is no release of flint2 with the right function for the testsuite not to fail. You would need a git checkout or someone making a new release of flint.

I have decided to make an ebuild of arb for gentoo (in the sage-on-gentoo overlay) and I got this when running "make check"

```
/home/extra/portage/sci-mathematics/arb-2.5.0/temp/ccLcbPFS.o: In function `acb_modular_epsilon_arg_naive':
/home/extra/portage/sci-mathematics/arb-2.5.0/work/arb-2.5.0/acb_modular/test/t-epsilon_arg.c:52: undefined reference to `fmpq_dedekind_sum'

```
No stable release of flint has fmpq_dedekind_sum in flint 2.4.4 as shipped with sage. It is still arith_dedekind_sum. And of course that's were it stopped, there could be more.
