There is no cygwin version of java. So, if the java executable is detected under cygwin, it means that it is a plain windows version, which expects windows filenames. Currently, it gets cygwin filenames and fails (this has been exposed by #17234).

The tickets converts the filenames to windows filenames where necessary.
