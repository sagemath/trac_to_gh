Whichever but we have to agree quickly. Do we want to require java 1.7 as a minimum? Is there a good reason to ditch java 1.6?

Actually the current code in sage check for version as far back as 1.5 and would be unhappy with 1.8.

```
        import re
        java_version = re.search("version.*[1][.][567]", version)
        return java_version is not None
```
so some fix will be in order anyway.

Good, the version checking is still in there.  This needs to be changed to not accept anything less than java 7.  I think Jmol will work with java 8, but have not done any testing.

I recommend "java_version = re.search("version.*[1][.][78]", version)"  and if we run into problems with version 8 JVMs we back up.

Jonathan, do we need Java 1.7 to view jsmol things, though?  Also, that means the wiki for jmol is pretty out of date.

Yup.  Wow, that is a bit of a change.  Sorry, Jeroen :(

JSmol and Jmol work without the backend.  The backend is presently just used to make the nice static pictures, without it a less pretty Tachyon image is generated.  Ultimately, the backend should be used to package the data as well.  The present packaging method is not terribly efficient or flexible.

I looked carefully at how we comile Jmol. Interestingly, we actually compile Jmol to be 1.6+ compatible, but it looks like the external gettext libraries now require 1.7+ and we're not about to rewrite those.

No! 'sage -dev push --ticket 17279' only seems to have added the last couple of lines of the rewrite.  I'm giving up on the trac/git combination.  Here's the corrected text.

The default live 3-D plotting for Sage 6.4+ uses
`Jmol/JSmol <http://jmol.sourceforge.net>`_
for viewing. From the command line the Jmol Java application is used,
and for in browser viewing either pure javascript or a Java applet
is used.  By default in browsers pure javascript is used to avoid
the problems with some browsers that do not support java applet
plugins (namely Chrome).  On each browser worksheet there is a
checkbox which must be checked before a 3-D plot is generated if
the user wants to use the Java applet (the applet is a little faster
with complex plots).
The most likely reason for a malfunction is that you do not have
a Java Run Time Environment (JRE) installed or you have one older than
version 1.7.  If things work from the command line another possibility
is that your browser does not have the proper plugin to support Java
applets (at present, 2014, plugins do not work with most versions of
Chrome).  Make sure you have installed either the IcedTea browser
plugin (for linux see your package manager), see:
`IcedTea <http://icedtea.classpath.org/wiki/IcedTea-Web>`_,
or the Oracle Java plugin see:
`Java <https://java.com/en/download/help/index_installing.xml>`_.

If you are using a Sage server over the web and even javascript rendering 
does not work, you may have a problem with your browser's javascript
engine or have it turned off.
