Some functions in `functional.py` aren't used or are duplicated in other places. Fix this.

I'm keeping the `log()` function for now because it is imported globally as `log_b` and it is actually used in the Sage library in various places.

I'm deprecating the global functions `one()` and `zero()` since I don't see the point of having them.

Depends on #17157

Component: **misc**

Keywords: **cleanup**

So you're saying that a lot of the removed functions aren't imported globally?  But you are removing a lot of global imports - where do they live instead?  I have a feeling that at least for a few of the symbolic ones there was a reason for having this last-ditch place for them.

Most of them can either be called as methods (`a.exp()` instead of `exp(a)`) or imported from a different place (usually in `sage.functions` or `sage.structure` in the case of `parent()`).

> I have a feeling that at least for a few of the symbolic ones there was a reason for having this last-ditch place for them.

I don't know what it could be... in any case all doctests pass without them.

> Also, I notice some other cleanup that is not related to this (e.g. in monoids), which seems odd.

I had to move that import to break a cyclic import loop.
