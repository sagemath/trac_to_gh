In `src/sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_element.pyx`, the method `is_cyclotomic()` begins by checking the irreducibility of the input polynomial, and then checks the leading and constant coefficients. I simply propose to invert those tests to fasten a bit the test for polynomials that are not monic or whose constant coefficient is not `1`.

Hello Bruno,

Actually, I discussed this with Karim Belabas in Bordeaux few weeks ago. We should either call Pari or stick to their implementation. It is much faster:

```
sage: p = cyclotomic_polynomial(150)
sage: pp = p._gp_()
sage: timeit("pp.poliscyclo()")
625 loops, best of 3: 697 µs per loop
sage: timeit("p.is_cyclotomic()")
125 loops, best of 3: 2.78 ms per loop
```
Moreover they do have the function `poliscycloprod` that checks if all roots are roots of unity (which is even faster).

Do you mean there are two ways to use Pari's implementation?

Nope. Either we should copy their implementation within Sage (I do not think this is justified) or just call Pari.

And by the way there are two ways of using pari. Either with `gp` (this is a pexpect interface with a lot of latency in communication) and with `libpari` (which is very efficient in C). But sadly there is not yet `poliscyclo` and `poliscycloprod` in the libpari interface (i.e. in the file `libs/pari/gen.pyx`).

Of course ;-) From pari documentation

```
poliscyclo(f): returns 0 if f is not a cyclotomic polynomial,
               and n > 0 if f = Phi_n, the n-th cyclotomic polynomial.
```

and you can already use it

```
sage: R.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: (x^2+x+1)._gp_().poliscyclo()
3
sage: (x^2-1)._gp_().poliscyclo()
0
```

For concreteness, what do you propose to do now? If I understand correctly, you propose to wait for #17631 and then make `is_cyclotomic()` directly call the pari functions, and not introduce the tiny change I made? I am fine with that, just wanted to be sure!

I am not sure to agree since it actually makes the function slower:

```python
sage: p = cyclotomic_polynomial(150)
sage: %timeit p.is_cyclotomic()
100 loops, best of 3: 2.75 ms per loop
sage: %timeit p._gp_().poliscyclo()
100 loops, best of 3: 3.96 ms per loop
```

As an aside, isn't it a problem for a method named `is_cyclotomic()` to return an integer rather than a boolean? Of course, the certificate is interesting to have, and one can still test with `is_cyclotomic()` as before. It is just that I expect a method `is_...()` to return a boolean. Maybe I am wrong...

We will then consider the fact of making it the default.\n\nVincent",

Right. Most of the time seems to be lost in the conversion

```
sage: l = [cyclotomic_polynomial(i) for i in range(2,50)]
sage: timeit("for p in l: _ = p.is_cyclotomic()")
5 loops, best of 3: 51.7 ms per loop
sage: timeit("for p in l: _ = p._gp_().poliscyclo()")
5 loops, best of 3: 303 ms per loop
sage: lgp = [p._gp_() for p in l]
sage: timeit("for p in lgp: _ = p.poliscyclo()")
25 loops, best of 3: 34.8 ms per loop
```

> As an aside, isn't it a problem for a method named `is_cyclotomic()` to return an integer rather than a boolean? Of course, the certificate is interesting to have, and one can still test with `is_cyclotomic()` as before. It is just that I expect a method `is_...()` to return a boolean. Maybe I am wrong...


You are right. The best option would be:

```
def is_cyclotomic(self, certificate=False):
    ...
    return ans if certificate else bool(ans)
```


A compromise can be:
- add the keyword `certificate` (if it is `True` we use `self._gp_().polisyclco()`)
- do your initial suggested change
- add a `TODO` to the documentation to switch from gp to pari (and open a ticket for it). We will then consider the fact of making it the default.

Just typographical comment. The `TODO` block must be indented. In other words

```
.. TODO::

    As soon as #XYZ is finished we should do blih and blah.
```
Have a look to [Docstring section of the developer manual](http://sagemath.org/doc/developer/coding_basics.html#docstring-markup-with-rest-and-sphinx).

It is `_gp_()` and not `__gp__()` (i.e. one underscore).

I would move the `._gp_().poliscyclo()` below the tests for characteristic.

Actually, the factor at the end is overkill as we only want a square root. I did have a look at the method `.is_square()` and it was dirty enough to be slow. So I just make it simpler/clearer. The speedup is very small and concerns mostly positive cases.

I am happy with your commits. Just review mine.

I am fine with your commit too, but for one typo that I've corrected in the docstring of `is_square()`:

```diff
 def is_square(self, root=False):
"""
Returns whether or not polynomial is square. If the optional
- argument ``root`` is set to ``True, then also returns the square root
+ argument ``root`` is set to ``True``, then also returns the square root
(or ``None``, if the polynomial is not square).
```

I do not know whether it is acceptable for me to set "positive review". I let you do so if you consider everything's OK. Thanks for the patient feedback!

Looks good to me. I have just made a few typographical changes, so I allow myself to put this into positive review.
