In `src/sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_element.pyx`, the method `is_cyclotomic()` begins by checking the irreducibility of the input polynomial, and then checks the leading and constant coefficients. I simply propose to invert those tests to fasten a bit the test for polynomials that are not monic or whose constant coefficient is not `1`.

Hello Bruno,

Actually, I discussed this with Karim Belabas in Bordeaux few weeks ago. We should either call Pari or stick to their implementation. It is much faster:

```
sage: p = cyclotomic_polynomial(150)
sage: pp = p._gp_()
sage: timeit("pp.poliscyclo()")
625 loops, best of 3: 697 µs per loop
sage: timeit("p.is_cyclotomic()")
125 loops, best of 3: 2.78 ms per loop
```
Moreover they do have the function `poliscycloprod` that checks if all roots are roots of unity (which is even faster).

Do you mean there are two ways to use Pari's implementation?

Of course ;-) From pari documentation

```
poliscyclo(f): returns 0 if f is not a cyclotomic polynomial,
               and n > 0 if f = Phi_n, the n-th cyclotomic polynomial.
```

and you can already use it

```
sage: R.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: (x^2+x+1)._gp_().poliscyclo()
3
sage: (x^2-1)._gp_().poliscyclo()
0
```

For concreteness, what do you propose to do now? If I understand correctly, you propose to wait for #17631 and then make `is_cyclotomic()` directly call the pari functions, and not introduce the tiny change I made? I am fine with that, just wanted to be sure!

And we can also add a `TODO` section in the documentation saying that we should move to the pari interface as soon as #17631 is ready.\n\nI am not sure to agree since it actually makes the function slower:\n\n```python\nsage: p = cyclotomic_polynomial(150)\nsage: %timeit p.is_cyclotomic()\n100 loops, best of 3: 2.75 ms per loop\nsage: %timeit p._gp_().poliscyclo()\n100 loops, best of 3: 3.96 ms per loop\n```\n\nAs an aside, isn't it a problem for a method named `is_cyclotomic()` to return an integer rather than a boolean? Of course, the certificate is interesting to have, and one can still test with `is_cyclotomic()` as before. It is just that I expect a method `is_...()` to return a boolean. Maybe I am wrong...",

I am not sure to agree since it actually makes the function slower:

```python
sage: p = cyclotomic_polynomial(150)
sage: %timeit p.is_cyclotomic()
100 loops, best of 3: 2.75 ms per loop
sage: %timeit p._gp_().poliscyclo()
100 loops, best of 3: 3.96 ms per loop
```

As an aside, isn't it a problem for a method named `is_cyclotomic()` to return an integer rather than a boolean? Of course, the certificate is interesting to have, and one can still test with `is_cyclotomic()` as before. It is just that I expect a method `is_...()` to return a boolean. Maybe I am wrong...

Right. Most of the time seems to be lost in the conversion

```
sage: l = [cyclotomic_polynomial(i) for i in range(2,50)]
sage: timeit("for p in l: _ = p.is_cyclotomic()")
5 loops, best of 3: 51.7 ms per loop
sage: timeit("for p in l: _ = p._gp_().poliscyclo()")
5 loops, best of 3: 303 ms per loop
sage: lgp = [p._gp_() for p in l]
sage: timeit("for p in lgp: _ = p.poliscyclo()")
25 loops, best of 3: 34.8 ms per loop
```

> As an aside, isn't it a problem for a method named `is_cyclotomic()` to return an integer rather than a boolean?

You are right. The best option would be:

```
def is_cyclotomic(self, certificate=False):
    ...
    return ans if certificate else bool(ans)
```


A compromise can be:
- add the keyword `certificate` (if it is `True` we use `self._gp_().polisyclco()`)
- do your initial suggested change
- add a `TODO` to the documentation to switch from gp to pari (and open a ticket for it). We will then consider the fact of making it the default.

Just typographical comment. The `TODO` block must be indented. In other words

```
.. TODO::

    As soon as #XYZ is finished we should do blih and blah.
```
Have a look to [Docstring section of the developer manual](http://sagemath.org/doc/developer/coding_basics.html#docstring-markup-with-rest-and-sphinx).

It is `_gp_()` and not `__gp__()` (i.e. one underscore).

I would move the `._gp_().poliscyclo()` below the tests for characteristic.

Right ;-) I will try a bit more optimization on my side.

Actually, the factor at the end is overkill as we only want a square root. I did have a look at the method `.is_square()` and it was dirty enough to be slow. So I just make it simpler/clearer. The speedup is very small and concerns mostly positive cases.

I am happy with your commits. Just review mine.

I am fine with your commit too, but for one typo that I've corrected in the docstring of `is_square()`:

```diff
 def is_square(self, root=False):
"""
Returns whether or not polynomial is square. If the optional
- argument ``root`` is set to ``True, then also returns the square root
+ argument ``root`` is set to ``True``, then also returns the square root
(or ``None``, if the polynomial is not square).
```

I do not know whether it is acceptable for me to set "positive review". I let you do so if you consider everything's OK. Thanks for the patient feedback!
