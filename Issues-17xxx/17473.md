The [sws2tex](https://bitbucket.org/whuss/sws2tex/) project is quite useful (it fairly automatically creates a nice pdf from your Sage worksheet) but has been somewhat moribund the past few years.  Putting it in Sage (or sagenb) proper should at least help with keeping it in usable condition.

Currently, the project consists of four Python scripts, a README, and a couple example files.  See sws2rst, rst2sws, and other similar things for how we might incorporate this.  Note that this ticket is NOT about making sws2tex more efficient or also using more updated tools.  Probably it *will* include opening tickets to cover the [remaining issues](https://bitbucket.org/whuss/sws2tex/issues?status=new&status=open), especially of actually keeping the tex file (and not just creating a pdf).
