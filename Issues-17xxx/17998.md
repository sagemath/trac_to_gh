Weight lattices have definitions in `root_lattice_realizations.py` and in `weight_space.py`. Furthermore there is a separate function called `is_dominant_weight` defined in root_lattice_realizations. There is a reason for having separate implementations: the realization in `weight_space.py` (when available) is more efficient since it avoids taking scalar products.

Adding a vector that is orthogonal to the simple coroots should not affect whether a weight is dominant.   Indeed, in //Infinite-dimensional Lie algebras// Kac defines dominant to mean having positive inner product with the positive coroots, and there doesn't seem to be any other useful convention. But the method in `weight_space.py` just looks at the coefficients to see if they are positive. But this method only works if the basis consists of the fundamental weights. In an extended affine weight lattice the basis consists of the fundamental weights plus the null root 'delta'. The coefficient of  'delta' should be ignored, so currently this method can give wrong results.

```
sage: P=RootSystem(['A',2,1]).weight_lattice(extended=true)
sage: delta=P.null_root(); delta
delta
sage: Lam = P.fundamental_weights()
sage: Lam[0].is_dominant()
True
sage: (Lam[0]-delta).is_dominant()
False
```

Consequently we need to revise a remark in the docstring for is_dominant_weight, and refine the definition in `weight_lattice.py` to ignore the coefficient of `'delta'` in the method in `weight_space.py`.
