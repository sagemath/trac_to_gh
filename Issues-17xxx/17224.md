The term order is pickled by the name rather than the object `TermOrder`. This causes problems for term orders which need additional arguments.

```
sage: from sage.rings.polynomial.term_order import TermOrder
sage: F.<x,y> = FreeAlgebra(QQ)
sage: g = F.g_algebra({y*x:-x*y}, order=TermOrder('wdegrevlex', [1,2]))
sage: loads(dumps(g)) # Boom
```
