Seems like this should work differently:

```
$ sage
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Sage Version 6.4.1, Release Date: 2014-11-23                       │
│ Type "notebook()" for the browser-based notebook interface.        │
│ Type "help()" for help.                                            │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
sage: z = sage.symbolic.function_factory.function('z',nargs=1)
sage: z_eq = ( z(x) == x/(1-x) )
sage: z_eq.substitute_function( z, (x^2).function(x) )
x^2 == -x/(x - 1)
sage: x_expr = solve( z_eq, x )[0].rhs()
sage: x_expr
z(x)/(z(x) + 1)
sage: x_expr.substitute_function( z, (x^2).function(x) )
z(x)/(z(x) + 1)
```

I believe it should replace `z(x)` with `x^2` in the last result.

<a id='comment:2'></a>I think the problem here is that we can't really support/recognize the "nargs" argument, but we do have:

```
sage: sage.symbolic.function_factory.function('z') == sage.symbolic.function_factory.function('z',nargs=1)

When we see the symbol appear on the maxima side, we have no idea whether it's a variadic function or one with a fixed number of arguments. Apparently, the interface presently chooses to go with variadic, since that is most generic. Indeed, if you change the first line to

```
sage: z= sage.symbolic.function_factory.function('z')
```
there is no problem.

Further problems arise with bare functions, because that concept doesn't exist in the maxima interface and/or maxima itself:

```
sage: f= sage.symbolic.function_factory.function('f',nargs=2)
sage: maxima_calculus(f)._sage_()(x)
x
sage: maxima_calculus(f)._sage_()(f=x)
x
sage: maxima_calculus(f)._sage_()(x,x)
ValueError: the number of arguments must be less than or equal to 1
```

We do that to some extent, but lack of scoping makes this unpredictable:

```
sage: f=function('f')
sage: F1=maxima_calculus(f(x))
sage: f=function('f',nargs=2)
sage: F2=maxima_calculus(f(x,x))
```
Since we're already mangling names for variables, one possibility would be to mangle any attributes into the names of functions, in which we'd get something along the lines:

```
sage: f=function('f',nargs=2)
sage: maxima_calculus(f(x,x)) #we could do it like this:
'_SAGE_FUNCTION_NARGS_2_f(_SAGE_VAR_x,_SAGE_VAR_x)
```

Maybe streamlined by only using mangled names for non-variadic functions.  Or only when a function comes up whose simple name is already in use...
