There is no need to define both `interval()` and `closed_interval()` defined on finite posets. Only one is needed and other might be an alias for it.

This changes how `closed_interval` plays with inheritance, and I'd consider this a "regression" (I'm using that term very loosely here). See https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/8bs7SlY4fNs.

Is there a class in which `closed_interval` is overshadowed differently than `interval`? If so, I second Travis's comment.
