I was not thinking about speed. It just seems a little confusing for me to have documentation with two functions, both with examples and so, that actually does same thing. Alias would correct that.

But if it would make other problems, then this should not be done. In that case I suggest having docstring of other to be only "Alias for <link>xxx()</link>".
