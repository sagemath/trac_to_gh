Easy upgrade.

Note that the extension `sage.tests.parallel` needs to be removed, since the corresponding source file never existed (for some reason, this was not an error before). It was added by mistake for testing a particular ticket.

The 0.22 Cython version is a beta release? Do you really want to ship that in Sage? The release cycle between the first beta and the stable version seems to be short in Cython (max 1 month). Don't you want to wait for it?

It makes a lot of sense to create a ticket now and test the beta version to give feedback to Cython upstream.

Note that the ticket title isn't "Upgrade to Cython 0.22.beta0", that the status wasn't "needs_review" and that I didn't even post a tarball link...

I was wondering because you need to update with respect to some tarball (sha1sum for example). Sorry for my misunderstanding.

cdef extern from "Python.h":
    bint PySlice_Check(PyObject* ob)

...PySlice_Check(<PyObject *>row_index)...
```
by

```
...isinstance(row_index, slice)...
```

Why is that a problem?

btw this breaks upgrading, if you don't manually run `sage -ba` then compilation fails because not all cython files are regenerated.

```
build/cythonized/sage/algebras/letterplace/letterplace_ideal.cpp: In function 'void* __pyx_f_4sage_3ext_6memory_check_allocarray(size_t, size_t)':

   __pyx_v_n = mul_overflowcheck(__pyx_v_nmemb, __pyx_v_size);
```
The cython version should probably also be considered in `sage -b`. If you want to work on that do it in a separate ticktet, this is already merged.

Replying to [@vbraun](#comment%3A17):
> btw this breaks upgrading, if you don't manually run `sage -ba` then compilation fails because not all cython files are regenerated.

It's unrelated to this ticket, it's a bug in `build/deps`: the `csage` target does not state the `c_lib` sources as dependency. This causes `make` to skip `csage`, even though `./sage -b` should work.

The error you see comes from the `c_lib` change in #10257. I guess you compiled with #10257 applied, then undid #10257.
