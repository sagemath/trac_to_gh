Could you try just doing:

```
sage -pip install pyopenssl
```

It worked well for me. If this works for you as well, since `pyopenssl` spkg is optional and unmaintained (still uses the old spkg style), it could be a better idea to just remove it from the list of packages and benefit from the up-to-date pip one. We did that for `sqlalchemy` for example.

I would say yes, but then `pyopenssl` should be removed from http://sagemath.org/packages/optional/ and http://sagemath.org/packages/optional/list to trigger an error.
