The files `src/sage/libs/pari/gen.pyx` and `src/sage/libs/pari/pari_instance.pyx` can be mostly auto-generated.

This first ticket introduces the infrastructure (except for documentation) and removes the manually-defined functions from `gen.pyx` and `pari_instance.pyx` only in trivial cases (function does the same thing and no documentation gets lost).

Follow-up: #17860

I don't think the order really matters. When developing this code, I did find it nice that I could do `D["bnfinit"]`. So I prefer to not make this change.

I agree (modulo a few details) with the other commits.

Doing that would be hard. Not impossible, but a highly non-trivial project.

Where can I found the implementation and/or documentation of `pari_catch_sig_on` and co?

It's basically a reminder to myself that this really should be deprecated.

> Why did you keep so much methods in the `gen` class in `gen.pyx` (such as `List`, `Mat`, `sign`, `vecmin`, `vecmax`, etc)?

In any case, I didn't want to remove any doctests. I also didn't check very carefully which methods could be removed.

See `src/sage/libs/pari/pari_err.pxi`. But `pari_catch_sig_on()` and `pari_catch_sig_off` are just `sig_on()` and `sig_off`. This used to be different before we had #14894.

Most of your comments are indeed good comments, but my first priority was to get the general framework (i.e. this ticket) reviewed, we can still improve things later. I prefer to split tickets in smaller pieces, I dislike these huge tickets which do everything.

The point is that if this ticket gets merged but not the follow-up (because you might stop doing Sage development or anything) we will end up with these two very strange lines.

Could you at least start with a comment

```
+            # # we should deprecate this because XYZ.
+            #from sage.misc.superseded import deprecation

Right. Doctest are indeed important! What is your long term goal with those methods?

> See `src/sage/libs/pari/pari_err.pxi`. But `pari_catch_sig_on()` and `pari_catch_sig_off` are just `sig_on()` and `sig_off`. This used to be different before we had #14894.

Just for precision: is `pari_catch_sig_on` just an equivalent to `sig_on`? If so I really do not understand why there is so much `pari_catch_sig_on` without any `pari_catch_sig_off`!

But I, as a reviewer, do not have your vision of the larger project. I just see one ticket (actually there is also the part 2 #17860).

In the end, I think it's probably best to store all extra documentation and doctests in a separate file (I haven't thought about the exact mechanism). Then that extra documentation will be put together with the PARI documentation in the auto-generated file.

> Just for precision: is `pari_catch_sig_on` just an equivalent to `sig_on`?

Yes (although you're recommended to use `pari_catch_sig_on` in PARI code in case we want to change this).

> I really do not understand why there is so much `pari_catch_sig_on` without any `pari_catch_sig_off`!

Because the `new_gen()` method runs `pari_catch_sig_off()`.

The wrapped functions indeed lack doctests, but PARI has quite an extensive test suite (which is run by Sage when installing with `SAGE_CHECK=yes`).
