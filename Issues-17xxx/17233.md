I am overwritting the default random_element method of the StandardTableaux_size class to implement an efficient way to compute a random standard tableau.

As explained in the documentation, we use the fact that standard tableau are in bijection with involution.

<a id='comment:4'></a>Just a few comments:

- The doc should start with a brief description of what the code does, not what theorems it uses. If your algorithm gives a uniform random permutation, then it should say so explicitly.

- Do not use generic catch-all constructors such as `Permutation(...)`. These ducktype the input to guess which form you are giving the permutation in. This is great for interactive use, but in your code you know what form you are giving already -- it is the cycle form. So you can save some time and remove a source of possible bugs by replacing `Permutation(...)` by `sage.combinat.permutation.from_cycles(...)`.

- Is this:

```
PerfectMatchings(set(range(1, self.size + 1)) - set(fixed_point_positions)).random_element()
```
actually efficient? I am asking because I don't see a random method in perfect_matchings.py, but I might not be looking in the right place.

There is a `random_element` in `perfect_matchings.py`; although it calls `Permutations(n).random_element()` which looks like it's fast.

- "couple" should be "pair" in mathematical usage.

- You are using `Permutations(self.size).random_element()[:fixed_point_number]` to generate a random `k`-element subset of `{1, 2, ..., n}` (if I understand you correctly -- otherwise, please correct me!). I think you can just as well do `sage.misc.prandom.sample(range(1, n+1), k)`, which is the method that is internally used when you call `Permutations(self.size).random_element()`.

<a id='comment:15'></a>Here's my review patch. If you are fine with it, please set this to positive_review.

`binomial` should be imported from `sage.rings.arith` rather than from `sage.functions.other` when you just want to compute binomial coefficients of integers. Check this:

```
sage: %timeit binomial(13, 5) # This is the one from sage.functions.other
10000 loops, best of 3: 61.1 µs per loop
sage: %timeit sage.rings.arith.binomial(13, 5)
100000 loops, best of 3: 5.6 µs per loop
sage: %timeit binomial(54, 23)
10000 loops, best of 3: 61.7 µs per loop
sage: %timeit sage.rings.arith.binomial(54, 23)
100000 loops, best of 3: 6.16 µs per loop
```
