See http://ask.sagemath.org/question/25327/casting-symbolic-fractions-to-fraction-field-of-polynomial-ring/

Something like

```
sage: ex=(x+1)/(x-1); ex
(x + 1)/(x - 1)
sage: ex.numerator().polynomial(ZZ)/ex.denominator().polynomial(ZZ)
(x + 1)/(x - 1)
sage: type(_)
<type 'sage.rings.fraction_field_element.FractionFieldElement'>
```
made into an `Expression` method, perhaps named `fraction(...)` with the ring as argument.
