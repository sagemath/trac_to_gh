On two OS X systems (one 10.9, one 10.10) this builds successfully but takes longer to build than previous gcc's. Is that the nature of version 4.9, or are we building extra stuff?

The time difference: on an old slow machine, it took 58 minutes to build 4.7.3 and 101 minutes to build this. On a newer faster machine, it took 16 minutes to build 4.7.3 and 21 minutes to build this. This time increase was also true with version 4.9.1. Do you see this on other platforms?

Sounds about right. Also includes the C -> C++ switch and C++ is definitely slower to compile since it is a much richer language.
