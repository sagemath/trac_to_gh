On two OS X systems (one 10.9, one 10.10) this builds successfully but takes longer to build than previous gcc's. Is that the nature of version 4.9, or are we building extra stuff?

Apart from the switch to c++ you may also be building a few more things compared to 4.7.3. Useful things like the sanitizer, more conformance to C++11, some C++14, support for latest openmp specification. All those take a bit of time.
