Thanks for working on this. I haven't looked through everything thoroughly yet, but here are some initial comments/questions:

* In `sage.combinat.e_one_star` (and in general), why do you change the expression in `__eq__` method to use backslashes instead of parens? According to PEP8, wrapping long lines should be done with parens, brackets, and braces rather than with backslashes.

* In `sage.combinat.root_system.branching_rules`, `sage.doctest.*`, and `sage.rings.finit_rings.residue_field`, using `not isinstance(other, type(self))` is not equivalent to the previous line of reasoning (i.e. `type(self)` might be a super class of `type(other)`). Instead use something like `other.__class__ is not self.__class__` (using `__class__` is better than `type` for duck typing purposes).

* In `sage.combinat.root_system.type_irreducible`, it seems to me that the added `__ne__` method is unecessary.

* In `sage.dynamics.flat_surfaces.strata`, you seemed to have removed the less than and greater than functionality (that wasn't being tested by the doctests).

We should keep it for now and check again when all `__cmp__()` have been removed.

> * In `sage.combinat.e_one_star` (and in general), why do you change the expression in `__eq__` method to use backslashes instead of parens? According to PEP8, wrapping long lines should be done with parens, brackets, and braces rather than with backslashes.

Didn't know about it. Fixed now.

> * In `sage.combinat.root_system.branching_rules`, `sage.doctest.*`, and `sage.rings.finit_rings.residue_field`, using `not isinstance(other, type(self))` is not equivalent to the previous line of reasoning (i.e. `type(self)` might be a super class of `type(other)`). Instead use something like `other.__class__ is not self.__class__` (using `__class__` is better than `type` for duck typing purposes).
> 

Fixed this.

> * In `sage.dynamics.flat_surfaces.strata`, you seemed to have removed the less than and greater than functionality (that wasn't being tested by the doctests).

Added functions and tests.

Hi André, how did you select the modules from the *mountain* of affected modules from ticket:16537? Is there a common theme? Just curious! 

By the way, after seeing the size of the *cmp*-problem in ticket:16537 I was so shocked that I stopped working on Sage and Python 3! So this gives me some fresh motivation ...

What is the reason for explicitly defining all 4 comparisons in `src/sage/dynamics/flat_surfaces/strata.py` instead of defining one (e.g. `__gt__`) and using the class decorator `functools.total_ordering`?

All comparisons need `self._marked_separatrix == other._marked_separatrix` and I think this leads to problems with the class decorator.

I do not think that it is *always* the right approach to solve the easier problems before the hard ones.

We have done this with good reason for stage 1 (#15980). But the completion of stage 1 has to precede the completion of stage 2. And now we have the hard problems that remain in stage 1!

I think that stage 2 (#16052) could use a tool like https://github.com/PythonCharmers/python-future to good effect. 
Clearly this does not prevent us from solving some of the problems (added originally to stage 2) in a stage 1 style (as was possible for `filter` and `reduce`, and I think it is also possible for `map` #16073!).

But we should try to complete stage 1 as soon as possible: if we cannot solve those remaining hard problems then Sage will not available under Python 3.

Anyway I will have a look at #16529 ;-)
And I will try to grok the *rich comparison* stuff - it is difficult and but it is also necessary!
