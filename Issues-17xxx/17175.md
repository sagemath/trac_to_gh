Thanks for working on this. I haven't looked through everything thoroughly yet, but here are some initial comments/questions:

* In `sage.combinat.e_one_star` (and in general), why do you change the expression in `__eq__` method to use backslashes instead of parens? According to PEP8, wrapping long lines should be done with parens, brackets, and braces rather than with backslashes.

* In `sage.combinat.root_system.branching_rules`, `sage.doctest.*`, and `sage.rings.finit_rings.residue_field`, using `not isinstance(other, type(self))` is not equivalent to the previous line of reasoning (i.e. `type(self)` might be a super class of `type(other)`). Instead use something like `other.__class__ is not self.__class__` (using `__class__` is better than `type` for duck typing purposes).

* In `sage.combinat.root_system.type_irreducible`, it seems to me that the added `__ne__` method is unecessary.

* In `sage.dynamics.flat_surfaces.strata`, you seemed to have removed the less than and greater than functionality (that wasn't being tested by the doctests).

We should keep it for now and check again when all `__cmp__()` have been removed.

Didn't know about it. Fixed now.

Fixed this.

Hi André, how did you select the modules from the *mountain* of affected modules from ticket:16537? Is there a common theme? Just curious! 

By the way, after seeing the size of the *cmp*-problem in ticket:16537 I was so shocked that I stopped working on Sage and Python 3! So this gives me some fresh motivation ...

What is the reason for explicitly defining all 4 comparisons in `src/sage/dynamics/flat_surfaces/strata.py` instead of defining one (e.g. `__gt__`) and using the class decorator `functools.total_ordering`?

Up to some exceptions I chose the `__cmp__()` functions which only checked for equality, where I hadn't to implement `__gt__()` etc.

The main "problem" of replacing `__cmp__()` is pointed out in http://www.mail-archive.com/sage-devel@googlegroups.com/msg73051.html. Until we find a reasonable solution for it, we should continue with the easier tickets, like #16529.

All comparisons need `self._marked_separatrix == other._marked_separatrix` and I think this leads to problems with the class decorator.

I do not think that it is *always* the right approach to solve the easier problems before the hard ones.

We have done this with good reason for stage 1 (#15980). But the completion of stage 1 has to precede the completion of stage 2. And now we have the hard problems that remain in stage 1!

I think that stage 2 (#16052) could use a tool like https://github.com/PythonCharmers/python-future to good effect. 
Clearly this does not prevent us from solving some of the problems (added originally to stage 2) in a stage 1 style (as was possible for `filter` and `reduce`, and I think it is also possible for `map` #16073!).

But we should try to complete stage 1 as soon as possible: if we cannot solve those remaining hard problems then Sage will not available under Python 3.

Anyway I will have a look at #16529 ;-)
And I will try to grok the *rich comparison* stuff - it is difficult and but it is also necessary!
