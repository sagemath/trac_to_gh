The following code produces type error:

```div
  {{{#!python
A.<x,y,z> = AffineSpace(QQ,3)
M = A.subscheme([x^2+y^2+z^2-3*x*y*z])
H = Hom(M,M)
f1 = H([3*y*z-x,y,z])
f2 = H([x,3*x*z-y,z])
f3 = H([x,y,3*x*y-z])
f3*f2*f1
  }}}
```

```
TypeError: right (=Scheme endomorphism of Closed subscheme of Affine Space of dimension 3 over Rational Field defined by:
  -3*x*y*z + x^2 + y^2 + z^2
  Defn: Defined on coordinates by sending (x, y, z) to
        (3*y*z - x, y, z)) must be a map to multiply it by Composite map:
...
```

This looks similar to previous ticket #14537
