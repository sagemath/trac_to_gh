Functions returning a value should not have side effects, `var` does. In #17447, comment 23 Nils Bruin proposed to separate both usages of `var` by introducing `declare_var`: this should behave exactly like `var` without return value, and `var` should not put the var handle in the `globals` list but should act like `SR.var`. If we want the following behaviour:
1. `declare_var('x')` == `var('x')` as before but returning `None`
2. `var('x')` prints deprecation message, returns variable as before; error after deprecation period
3. `y = var('x')` as before (but without globals), NO deprecation message
we certainly need the preparser to recognize 2/3, and to replace (2) with `declare_var('x'); deprecation(...); x` and (3) with `y = SR.var('x')`. Secondly, there is a different docstring needed with `var` when compared with `declare_var`.

This and the same with functions is the most annoying problem for people doing calculus in Sage.

Does sage really need a version of `var()` that touches the global namespace? Other similar functions like `polygen()` and `*.gen()` don't do it, except for a handful of constructors after `inject_on()`—which I doubt anyone uses. And `y = var('y')` is clearer and shorter than `declare_var('y')`, though it would be nice if `y = var()` (or perhaps `<y> = var()`?) was preparsed to `y = SR.var('y')`.

I should have looked sooner: the catch is, I removed the `globals` injection in `calculus/var.pyx:var()` and the variables get still injected. And indeed the same with `SR.var()`, so that has side effects too and is no cure for the matter.

EDIT: Noo, that's wrong, it's the expression on the lhs that gets injected!

I still have to find a case where injection of the variable itself matters.

+1 as well, the name "variable" causes a lot of troubles to newcommers that use `var()` to declare Python names, see for example [this list of ask questions](http://ask.sagemath.org/questions/scope:all/sort:activity-desc/tags:variable_issue/page:1/). Instead of a generic "variable", we should use "symbol" for SR, "name" (for Python), "indeterminate" for polynomials. This will help learning Sage a lot.

By the way, note the difference between 

```
sage: SR.var('x,y')
(x, y)
```

and

```
sage: SR.symbol('x,y')
x,y
sage: SR.symbol('x y')
x y
```

So perhaps should we also make a difference between `Symbol` and `Symbols` ?

`SR.var` does exactly what the `declare_var` does without the drawbacks of an additional global, so as it stands I'm against the ticket description.

`SR.symbol` and `SR.var` should probably be aliases but aren't. I wasn't even aware of `SR.symbol`, which is why I only fixed the comma parsing in `SR.var` in #7496.

How about something like `R.<x> = SR()` to get symbolic generators?

Yes, that's probably better that the syntax I suggested.

Actually `SR.var` is a wrapper over `SR.symbol` that splits commas and spaces to create tuples of symbols.

> How about something like `R.<x> = SR()` to get symbolic generators?

This is non-pythonic, requires additional preparsing, needs to create the name `R` while the ring `SR` is already here, and will add even more confusion to newcomers that hardly understand the difference between a symbolic expression like `x^2+1` and a well defined polynomial over a well defined ring.

The deprecation policy is a joke... Except perhaps for a few `_`-functions, just about anything in sage can be considered public, but only few changes are considered worth a deprecation.

> `SR.var` does exactly what the `declare_var`

No, it does not:

- `SR.var` a symbol and *does not* inject anything.
- `var` (toplevel) as it exists now returns a symbol *and* injects a binding to it
- `declare_var` as proposed would inject a binding to a symbol and return `None`.

The problem with the mixed actions of `var` is that people learn it, see it returns a symbol, and then use it in circumstances where they need a symbol returned. That works, but behind the scenes there is *also* a binding injected. That then surprises them later.

If we have two routines, one that *only* returns a symbol and the other that *only* injects a binding, this potential for surprise is eliminated.

I think we do want the possibility of injecting something, because `x=var('x')` or `x=SR.var('x')` is too verbose (and more importantly, requires the `x` to by typed twice).

We need the injection capability on toplevel because this is one of the first things that novices need to be able to do. I'm not completely sure we need an entry to `SR.var` in the global namespace. However, the capability has been there as part of `var` (with sometimes surprising side-effects) so I think we pretty much have to continue it.

They probably shouldn't. At least one of them should be 'make a symbol with the given print name or raise an error'. The fact that the return type of `var` depends on the formatting of the string (either a symbol or a tuple of symbols) is a wart that stems from convenience for the injection purpose.

> How about something like `R.<x> = SR()` to get symbolic generators?

Cute, but I think it misses the mark for the intended audience: complete novices. It makes it very hard to convince people that Sage is a reasonable choice relative to Maple and Mathematica (and Maxima), where you can just start using a symbol.

It is *not* consistent with the rest of sage and hard to implement, since presently it amounts to
`_ = SR(names=('x',)); (x,) = _._first_ngens(1)`
Normally, calling a constructor with different names gives different results:

```
sage: PolynomialRing(QQ,names=('x',)) == PolynomialRing(QQ,names=('y',))
False
```
and we would need to hack `SR._first_ngens` to remember the last set of generators that got returned.

The scenario really doesn't fit in the current meaning of `_.<..>=...`, neither in implementation nor in semantics.

Re `SR.var('x')`: "What does SR mean?" "The Symbolic Ring." "What's a ring?"

Remember that we have users who just want to do calculus. They don't know what a ring is. They also are not that familiar with Python, and we shouldn't use this particular situation to educate them on Python syntax. So I think we need a top-level function. The proposed `declare_var('x')`, which returns `None` but injects the variable into the global namespace, seems like the more natural behavior for novices. (We can have two functions, as Nils says, one like this and a second one which does not inject anything but returns the symbol. I would suggest advertising the first of these in the tutorial and other parts of the documentation. )

The name `declare_var` could maybe be improved because of the different uses of the word "variable". Something like `declare_math_var`? `declare_math_symbol`? `new_math_symbol`?

`declare_symbolic_variable` perhaps, if you really feel such a function is useful?

You can do some very simple examples, such as differentiating a function, plotting one, trying to compute an antiderivative without understanding the way python names (really, python has "names" in its namespaces.

There's a reason why maple, mathematica, maxima went with their approach. We can't quite do that, but we have to make the hurdle as low as possible. I think

```
var('x')
```
or

```
declare_var('x')
```
are about the best we can do. I think it's a problem they return something in addition to injecting a binding. If we need to produce feedback on the action taken, I think printing something would be preferable (it's a routine that's only meant to be used interactively anyway), so perhaps:

```
sage: declare_var('x,y')
Declaring x, y as symbolic variables
sage: A=declare_var('z')
Declaring z as a symbolic variable
sage: A
None
sage: declare_var('w',quiet=True)
sage:
```
(where the `quiet` would be the gateway to getting people to use other ways--perhaps we shouldn't provide that)

I'd be completely OK with `declare_var` being spelled as `var` too. The main thing is that I think it has been shown that injecting *as well as* returning something is harmful, so I hope we can our change our interface to not do that.

`declare_var` sounds like *varibale declaration* that exists in many languages and is completely different that what is done here. There is already a lot of newcomer's code that start with

```
var('a')
a=2
```

So i can imagine how much more there will be with `declare_var`, since it will add confusion to programmers too.

What is currently discussed is a function that injects a symbol into the namespace, so `inject_symbol` sounds more meaningful as it just tells what is actually done.

As for the `Symbolic Ring`, it is perhaps better not to know what a mathematical ring is, so perhaps thinking about that object as `The Lord of the Rings` is not so bad. We do not have much "calculus" course in France so i can not tell much about the benefits of playing with objects we are not able to define, i can just witness from what i see on ask.sagemath.org that people get more lost by lack of clear definitions than by excess (e.g. how to factor a polynomial if we do not know on which ring it is defined?).

I agree that in any case, both injecting and returning is harmful (`function` does that too).

Except that "inject" is rather technical and not what the novice thinks about doing. You'd probably have to explain to them: "Before using y, you have to declare that it is a math symbol, which you do by
`declare_symbol("y")`." 

I indeed agree that using "symbol" instead of "symbolic variable" would be better to distinguish the concept from a python name. However, we've been calling these things "var" since the start of sage, so changing that may be painful for our current users.

> I agree that in any case, both injecting and returning is harmful (`function` does that too).

There the terminology is even worse: python actually calls its "def" and "lambda" objects "functions". So "declare_function" will be even more confusing than "declare_var". 

---

A minimal plan is to either not have `var` produce side-effects, meaning

```
sage: var('z')
z
sage: z+1
Error
```
or let `var` return None, meaning

```
sage: z = var('z')
sage: z+1
Error
```

If neither one is palatable then we can stop the discussion now. We're stuck with a bad design decision, for which the pain for repairing it is too high.

---

An alternative is to migrate to the unspoilt

```
sage: z = symbol('z')
sage: declare_symbol('w')
sage: z+w+1
z+w+1
```
and let `var` rot and fester, trying to nudge people away from it (put a deprecation on it after a while?). In 10 years or so we could think of removing `var`.

For `function` we can perhaps do the deprecation in-place. That's mainly going to affect people trying to solve ODEs and PDEs (outside of that, symbolic (formal/abstract) functions don't have much use)

I'm not quite clear whether you mean:
- side-effectful routines should NOT return a value (quite standard) and should NOT print something.
- side-effectful routines are unclean anyway and it's no bother to type `a=var('a')`.

What I mean is that I think the doctests were written that way because it was easier to type`a=var('a')` than have to deal with an output.  For myself, I think that 
* keeping previous behavior
* ease of use
argue strongly for `var('a')` or something else *easy*, no equals signs etc.  In fact, `var(a)` would be easiest but Python wouldn't allow that.

You'd need to take into account that the `%var` processing is done by the REPL. So for notebook, ipython and the doctest framework (and any new interfaces that arise) you'd have to provide it.

By making `var` not a function you're also blocking off reasonable programmatic use. Presently:

```
sage: var(''.join('x%d '%i for i in [1..10]))
(x1, x2, x3, x4, x5, x6, x7, x8, x9, x10)
```
This is comparable to why in Python3 print was turned into a function.

Otherwise I like the missing quotes in the syntax; I dislike having to explain what the modulo or string formatting sign is doing at the start of a line when you're explaining to someone that sage is "just like python" (should they know that already). 

`SR.var('a').inject()` has problems. The incantation is obviously atrocious to type. But also: note that `inject()` would simply be a method on an expression. Would it inject all variables that occur in it?

Is that spelled out? I looked at sage.calculus.var.var? (that's the var that also occurs at top-level) and didn't find it there. I don't think a programmatic approach to injecting `x1,...,x10` is so bad.

A possible scenario:

```
sage: A=var(''.join('x%d '%i for i in [1..10]))
sage: L=sum(A[i]^(i+1) for i in [0..9])^2
sage: L.expand().coefficient(x4^4)
2*x10^10 + 2*x9^9 + 2*x8^8 + 2*x7^7 + 2*x6^6 + 2*x5^5 + 2*x3^3 + 2*x2^2 + 2*x1
```
which actually illustrates a genuine use of "inject as well as return". D'oh.

```

(try this on a qwerty board slowly to see all the unusual movements due to the shifts and non-home row things) so it would definitely be so for a beginner.

I would favor an "infinite" deprecation period for `var()`: deprecate it but keep supporting it forever.

Something like that would work, but probably not under that name. The method already exists on `SR` by inheritance (and doesn't work), and the signature you're proposing is incompatible with the one on other rings.

Injecting in general isn't really a method that belongs on the object, since the object doesn't naturally have access to the dictionary into which these things should be injected. It's really more the task of a REPL utility function. In which case the spelling

```
inject_generators(QQ['x'])
```
would make more sense. The magic of figuring out into which dictionary the bindings should be injected is compartmentalized into a single function which could be implemented basically as

```
def inject_generators(parent):
    D={repr(a): a for a in parent.gens()}
    print "defining ",D.keys()
    user_globals.update(D)
```
This probably much nicer than scattering references to user_globals all over the place (we'd probably want to add some sanity checks to prevent this from inserting objectionable bindings).

For symbolic binding we could then have something along the lines of

```
def inject_symbols(*args):
    user_globals.update({ repr(a):a for e in args for a in e.variables()})
```

Interfacing via `%var` is then an additional measure.

In short, what we seem to be converging towards is:
- deprecate `sage.calculus.var.var` (but keep supporting it; after a while probably do adorn it with a deprecation warning)
- support symbolic variable injection via a special `%var` directive (which saves quotes too!) -- Is the `%` a problem? We'd need to make doctests aware of it.
- have `SR.var(...)` as general symbol creation (which we already have).

There is some further rationalization around injection behaviour possible.

To repeat what I said on #15605, I for one basically view symbolic expressions as straight-line programs that are just required to evaluate to what you'd expect when you assign values to free variables. I believe this may be more accurate than thinking in terms of rewriting rules, since, as far as I know, nothing in the Sage implementation of symbolic expression systematically applies “rewriting rules”.

Many *operations* on symbolic expressions, however, only make sense with stronger assumptions on the expressions. Typically, simplifications are supposed to transform these ”programs“ into ”equivalent“ ones, but of course whether two ”programs“ are equivalent depends on what the variables can represent.
In this context, the sensible thing to do IMO is to view all variables as complex by default, and require simplifications to be valid for arbitrary complex values of all variables (or more accurately, for a generic choice of complex values: for example, we probably do want `x/x` to simplify to `1`). But of course this default does not cover all cases, for instance, `expand()` also makes sense for expressions containing constants from a finite field.

I'm pretty sure that would be at least as annoying as dealing with values printed by a bare `var` (at least for doctests).

Related to this discussion, note that there is another (strange) way to declare variables in Sage that currently works:

```
sage: ,var x a b c
(x, a, b, c)
sage: type(a)
<type 'sage.symbolic.expression.Expression'>
```

Apparently, it is ipython that provides this. I learn about the existence of this when I recently read the [wikipedia page of Sage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sage_(mathematics_software)):

```
x, a, b, c = var('x, a, b, c')
# Note that IPython also supports a faster way to do this, by calling 
# this equivalent expression starting with a comma:
# ,var x a b c
```

Yuck. It's a good illustration of the general confusion caused by the current behaviour of `var`. Reading the IPython documentation,

```
,var x a b c
```
is equivalent to

```
var("x","a","b","c")
```
which happens to do almost the same effect as the other `var` command given, except that the second form consists of a value returning expression and the first form is a non-expression statement that does not return a value (and hence prints nothing in the REPL).
