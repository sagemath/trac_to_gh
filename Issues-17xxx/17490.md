Should be doable - and actually should be put into the `spk-src` script, as the creation of the spkg for sagenb is not trivial...

does call python's tar rather than the system tar).
You might also want to add option to make tar file rather than tar.gz file.

So, why did you do the tarball creation manually rather than using this script?
