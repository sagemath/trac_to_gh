If someone uses BSD tar (the default on Mac) to tar up an spkg, it can cause problems on some Linux setups.  See e.g. https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-support/IZHC1QeFqBI but also many in the past.

Should be doable - and actually should be put into the `spk-src` script, as the creation of the spkg for sagenb is not trivial...

Currently upstream [says](https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb/blob/master/ReleaseInstr.md)

```
mv dist sagenb-<version>
tar cf sagenb-<version>.tar sagenb-<version>
mv sagenb-<version>.tar SAGE_ROOT/upstream

but if that were put into an `spkg-src` script that would be fine.  Or maybe the gz file that comes out of [dist.sh](https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb/blob/master/dist.sh) is enough?

Ideally this would go in #10057.

this looks good (I presume that https://docs.python.org/2/distutils/sourcedist.html
does call python's tar rather than the system tar).
You might also want to add option to make tar file rather than tar.gz file.

So, why did you do the tarball creation manually rather than using this script?
