See https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-support/I806rjMMCRY for only the latest in a slew of problems for people trying to use mpl/pylab and running into trouble with tkagg (whatever that is) not being installed/in the right place.  Let's make this, and whatever else is needed, more obvious by adding it to the FAQ and (more importantly) adding it early in the plot documentation.
