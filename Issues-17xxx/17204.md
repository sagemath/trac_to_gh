* ​http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/libtool-patches/2014-09/msg00002.html
* ​https://gmplib.org/list-archives/gmp-bugs/2014-September/003534.html

There will be a libtool release soon: http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/libtool/2014-10/msg00000.html

Regardless, I think we should work around this by setting `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` to 10.9. By the time 10.11 rolls out we'll be in better shape to push this out to upstream projects.
