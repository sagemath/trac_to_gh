With this branch, one can use the ".. PLOT::" directive defined in matplotlib through Sphinx.

As it expects the picture to be defined as a matplotlib one, I added a small function called 'draw' that translates a Sage object into a matplotlib one through a temporary .png file (I know, I know...)

While it works as it is, it is probably not implemented as it should.

Soooo let us fix this and use that feature !

Hello !

> Yo!  Do you think that using the built-in `.matplotlib()` method for all our graphics (well, 2d) would work?  (For instance, we already usually have tight layout.)


I do not understand your question. Here is how the draw function currently works:

1) Take a Sage graphical object and save it as a png file
2) Load the png with matplotlib

Then, matplotlib's 'plot' directive knows how to handle it and add the pictures in the html documentation. Pretty simple from out point of view, and will work with anything we can turn into a jpg file.

In particular (though I do not know if this is what you asked) the 'tight layout' parameter will have an impact on the .jpg file we *produce*. The 'tight layout' I added in the code is a parameter of the picture produced by matplotlib from our jpg file.

> I would say that your `draw` function is more of a proof-of-concept, not really something we would want to actually add.


Well. I would also prefer calls to `.show()` to produce plots in the doc, but really I do not know how to write this branch better than how it is done. If it turns out that nobody can rewrite it better, I would still prefer to have this 'draw' function around and be able to add pictures to the doc than nothing at all.

> But we could add instructions about how to use the `PLOT::` directive right now to have them actually show up in the docs.


Again I do not understand: do you mean instructions like the ones I added in my last commit ?

> One could create a major patch bomb by changing the `sage/plot/` files to have all plots use this :)


Still do not understand what you mean by "to have all plots use this". Note that even if we were able to turn all calls to `.show()` into a picture in the reference manual it would not necessarily be a good idea. I remember a time when peopl complained a bit about the size of our documentation, and.... Adding pictures to that would probably mean more than a couple of megabytes.

Plus it would mean having Sphinx go through all doctests when building the doc, and that's not a good idea either.

Good evening,

Nathann

The "doctest" syntax for matplotlib's plot directive sounds interesting:

```
  3. Using **doctest** syntax::

       .. plot::
          A plotting example:
          >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
          >>> plt.plot([1,2,3], [4,5,6])
```
but I can't figure out how to get it to work, mainly because I don't know how to convert a Sage graphics object into something matplotlib can plot. For example,

```
sage: C = grsphs.PetersenGraph().plot()
sage: fig = C.matplotlib() # looks good, right?
sage: fig.show()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
AttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)
...
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'manager'
Figure.show works only for figures managed by pyplot, normally created by pyplot.figure().
```
Understanding how to do this would let us use just a few lines like

```
.. plot::

    >>> from sage.all_cmdline import *
    >>> graphs.CubeGraph(8).plot().matplotlib().show()
```
instead of having to manually save to a temporary file.

That's exactly what I've posted earlier about LMFDB [here](https://github.com/LMFDB/lmfdb/blob/master/lmfdb/utils.py#L524).


```
from matplotlib.backends.backend_agg import FigureCanvasAgg
fig = P.matplotlib()
fig.set_canvas(FigureCanvasAgg(fig))
fig.savefig(..., format='png')
```

LMFDB also uses `StringIO` to avoid the creation of temporary files. I think that's a good thing in general and only has benefits. I just don't know how the underlying mechanism here works, but I would recommend doing that.

But if we are planning to add a lot of pictures, then we want to consider how best to automate it, and also what the costs to the developers and users will be: will docbuilding suddenly take much longer because we're building 500 plots each time, or will the source code be larger because we're including 500 plots? If we include the plots, what's the best format? '.sobj' and '.pdf' look like the smallest in a few examples I just tried...

Helloooooo !

Just to say that I tried several times to user Harald's trick to not have to go through a temporary file, but that it made the margins larger again and that I did not achieve to avoid that `:-/`

Result at `public/17498_nofile` if anybody wants to try things.

This is not about adding all plots from doctests, only from the special `..plot:` sphinx environment.

Pictures should never be added to the repo if it can be avoided. 

How about rename `draw(plot)` to `sphinx_draw(plot)` to make it clear that this is specific to the docbuilder. We could add an option to specify the appropriate output format, but anything that is not just png will need special care. For example, vector graphics output must be genenrated as svg + pdf for the html and pdf documentation.

For the doctest syntax to make sense we would have to support the sage: prompt instead of >>> and so on. This can be move to a separate ticket.

Hello !

Well, nothing I guess if nobody uses it. Then it will depend on how many pictures we add.

> Which reminds me, update developer manual, please :-)


Do you mean that I should update this ticket with #17508 one way or another ? Review one, I will update the other :-P

> Again, I am wondering whether this works with other plots, like `plot(sin(x),(x,0,pi))` or something.  Yes, I am too tired to try it now.


Load the 'sphinx_plot' function in Sage. If it does not raise an exception on the object you give it then it works. All that is necessary is to turn this thing into a .png, that's all.

> But whatever is implemented should be robust in that sense, even if it's our fault for having several different ways to plot things (plotting with `plot()` versus `.plot()` methods).


I don't totally grasp the dichotomy you have in mind `:-P`

Replying to [ncohen](#comment%3A40):
> YOooooo ! Is anything else needed ?


Concerning requirements (i did not test the branch yet, only read its content):

- This was already discussed in comments [comment:27] and [comment:28]: there should be a way to turn this feature on/off from the `sage -docbuild` and the `make doc` commands, since some binaries need to stay small. For example, one could add a `htmlpng` (or whatever `htmlplot`, through at some point one could insert e.g. svg images) docbuild format (and also trigger the plotting for the existing `web` format), which leads to calls like:

```
sage -docbuild reference htmlpng
```

- The new `sphinx_plot` function is not documented nor tested.

Concerning the discussion about the syntax, a possibility which could make syntax more uniform (hence easier to remember) could be to have a similar syntax as in passing options to the doctests, e.g.

```
::
    graphs.PetersenGraph().plot()     # plot
```

Actually, both syntax could coexist, because there are two use cases with two different behaviors:

-  a `..PLOT::` directive to insert plots within some classical text, so that the code that builds the image does not appear, as for the currently used `..image::` directive (see e.g. in `src/sage/homology/simplicial_complex.py` and the [resulting page](http://sagemath.org/doc/reference/homology/sage/homology/simplicial_complex.html)).

- a `# plot` comment within the doctests, so that plots appear as the result of the doctest (resp. under the corresponding cell in the live doc), while letting the code visible (resp. still executable in the live cells).

Probably not for this ticket, we should take the opportunity to remove hardcoded png images from the git tree that are used by the `..image::` directive, and build them instead (at least for the plots that were obtained with Sage). However, the old `..image::` hardcoded way had the advantage that images do not depend on bugs, so there should be some way to kind of test the automatically produced pictures (from their size?, from similarities with previous build?), or at least to provide a way to see them all at once to have a visual check before releasing and pushing to the official doc.

Yo !

> - This was already discussed in comments [comment:27] and [comment:28]: there should be a way to turn this feature on/off from the `sage -docbuild` and the `make doc` commands, since some binaries need to stay small.


I do not know how to do that. At first I thought that it would be impossible without rewriting matplotlib's plot directive, but then it seems that it accepts a 'nofigs' option to do just that. I have no idea how to change its value, however (we cannot touch the file directly, it is not Sage code)

> - The new `sphinx_plot` function is not documented nor tested.


Well, it is not even a function but a string. And I do not see what you want me to test, the function returns no output.

(`sage -coverage` does not report the function)

> Concerning the discussion about the syntax, a possibility which could make syntax more uniform (hence easier to remember) could be to have a similar syntax as in passing options to the doctests, e.g.


It would be nice, but I have no idea how to do that you want of me. Do you ?

I also expect that we cannot ask Sphinx to do that unless the doctests are in some kind of environment (like ".. PLOT")

Unfortunately, the presence or lack of pictures is cached in `src/doc/output/doctrees`, so to see any difference between `make doc-html` and `make doc-html-no-pix`, it's probably safest to first run `make doc-clean`.

By the way, why not put "sphinx_plot" directly in `conf.py`, rather than import it from `sage.plot.misc`? Also, the comment before it should be changed to mention "sphinx_plot" instead of "draw".

Hi,

sorry for not being reactive, i am quite seek currently so the time i can spend on Sage is lowered.

Replying to [ncohen](#comment%3A43):
> I do not know how to do that. At first I thought that it would be impossible without rewriting matplotlib's plot directive, but then it seems that it accepts a 'nofigs' option to do just that. I have no idea how to change its value, however (we cannot touch the file directly, it is not Sage code)


Not knowing how to fix this issue is not a sufficient condition to let the size of every Sage binary explode (nor putting the ticket back to needs_review as if no solution implies no problem). I was not claiming that **you** should fix it yourself, i was claiming that **the ticket** needs work, working on a ticket is a collaborative task, and there is no reason to merge something that is not ready.

> > - The new `sphinx_plot` function is not documented nor tested.
 
>
> Well, it is not even a function but a string.


The `plot_pre_code` string could be an import statement of a genuine doctested function, currently the code of the function is within a configuration file, instead we could have a shorter `plot_pre_code` in `src/doc/common/conf.py` and a genuine `sphinx_plot` function in `src/sage/plot/misc.py` (say).

> And I do not see what you want me to test, the function returns no output.


For example, we could test the existence of the file and its timestamp (in case the image comes from an older build), its size (dimensions), the color of some pixels in a quite predictible image ?
The plot directive seems not a sphinx standard, and i am not sure matplotlib will not change its behaviour, or remove it, rename it (e.g. if sphinx incorporate it with another name). Hence, there should perhaps be a way to report something if the drawing goes wrong.

What is less clear to me is how to trigger the test (only after a docbuild that used pictures).

> It would be nice, but I have no idea how to do that you want of me.


I would like to clearly avoid some misunderstanding: i am not expecting some additional work from you (nor judging the quality of your code or whatever), only trying to contribute to a ticket that should add more features than problems within Sage.

Back to the main issue, John's current fix is a good step, but it does not solve the fact that when we run `make` to build Sage, the doc is built with pictures with no possibility to avoid it, and then we have to rebuild the doc again to remove them.

I see various points to make John's fix work better:

- the way it is currently written, it is uselsss for the user to set the `SPHINX_INCLUDE_PLOTS` environment variable because it is overwritten by the `builder.py` script in any case. It could be better to use this variable if the user defined it, so that the user could avoid building the wrong documentation by typing `export SPHINX_INCLUDE_PLOTS=no` before doing a `make`. One possibility is to document this variable and to overwrite it only if `--no-pix` is explicitely stated.

- Note that in Sage, environment variables usually get values `yes/no` instead of `True/False`, and their name start with `SAGE_`.

- Instead of adding a new `html-no-pix` FORMAT for the docbuild command, it could be better to add a `--no-pix` OPTION (or perhaps `--no-plot` ?). See `sage -docbuild` for the documentation. This is more consistent with the existing `--no-pdf-links` or `--no-colors` options, but also allows to pass the `--no-pix` (or whatever) option in the Makefile calls via the `SAGE_DOCBUILD_OPTS` command.

{
    "body": "<a id='comment:58'></a>\nYop !\n\n> Not knowing how to fix this issue is not a sufficient condition to let the size of every Sage binary explode\n\n\nAs you will notice, the binary never exploded. There are <=10 pictures added by this branch, nothing more. Everything else is your imagination of what the future will be. And in that future, we still have time to write patches if we need to. So that never happened.\n\n> I was not claiming that **you** should fix it yourself, i was claiming that **the ticket** needs work, working on a ticket is a collaborative task, and there is no reason to merge something that is not ready.\n\n\nWhy didn't you add a commit ? In my understanding of what this ticket should do, what you wanted was an 'added feature'. This is why I thought it was not a problem to have this one reviewed first. I just want to add a new feature that we have been needing for a long time. We will have to deal with the problems that this will create in the future, it is true. But well, this is not a problem now and we can fix it whenever we like, so I did not think that it was a problem for this ticket.\n\nThis being said, John solved that as the manual can be built without pictures.\n\n> The `plot_pre_code` string could be an import statement of a genuine doctested function, currently the code of the function is within a configuration file, instead we could have a shorter `plot_pre_code` in `src/doc/common/conf.py` and a genuine `sphinx_plot` function in `src/sage/plot/misc.py` (say).\n\n\nI do not understand that. `plot_pre_code` is a string variable that is expected by matplotlib's 'plot' directive for Sphinx. How would you give it anthing else than a string ?\n\n> > And I do not see what you want me to test, the function returns no output.\n\n> \n> For example, we could test the existence of the file and its timestamp (in case the image comes from an older build), its size (dimensions), the color of some pixels in a quite predictible image ?\n\n\nThe `sphinx_draw` function is meant to display a picture (this is what matplotlib intercepts), not to write it to a file. Writing it to a file is just a mean to display it \"as it has to be displayed\", and if anything must be doctested it should be that.\n\nI have no idea what kind of things we could 'check' by opening the image file directly though `O_o`\n\n> The plot directive seems not a sphinx standard,\n\n\nNo, it comes from matplotlib\n\n> and i am not sure matplotlib will not change its behaviour, or remove it, rename it (e.g. if sphinx incorporate it with another name). Hence, there should perhaps be a way to report something if the drawing goes wrong.\n\n\nI do not know how to check that. But that is similar to the fact that we have no way to check in the doctests that our .show() calls actually do something. If that function changed, no doctest would be broken I expect, and there are many doctests that call show.\n\n> Back to the main issue, John's current fix is a good step, but it does not solve the fact that when we run `make` to build Sage, the doc is built with pictures with no possibility to avoid it, and then we have to rebuild the doc again to remove them.\n\n\nTrue, true. For me you want to solve a problem that does not exist yet, but this is clearly the kind of things we will neeed someday.\n\n> - the way it is currently written, it is uselsss for the user to set the `SPHINX_INCLUDE_PLOTS` environment variable because it is overwritten by the `builder.py` script in any case.\n\n\nRight now there is no user-side doc mentionning `SPHINX_INCLUDE_PLOTS`. This variable is set and used internally only, and that works fine. If you want to advertise this to users, then indeed the name may have to be changed.\n\n> - Note that in Sage, environment variables usually get values `yes/no` instead of `True/False`, and their name start with `SAGE_`.\n\n\nThe same comment applies to that, I guess.\n\n> - Instead of adding a new `html-no-pix` FORMAT for the docbuild command, it could be better to add a `--no-pix` OPTION (or perhaps `--no-plot` ?). See `sage -docbuild` for the documentation. This is more consistent with the existing `--no-pdf-links` or `--no-colors` options, but also allows to pass the `--no-pix` (or whatever) option in the Makefile calls via the `SAGE_DOCBUILD_OPTS` command. \n\n\nIf you prefer. Would you be ready to write a commit for all these changes that you request ? I do not understand why you see all these things as a reason to block this patch from being merged into Sage. I have less problems with it if you are willing to write yourself this added code, as it would not mean that this ticket is blocked until I implement what you ask.\n\nNathann",

> Not knowing how to fix this issue is not a sufficient condition to let the size of every Sage binary explode


As you will notice, the binary never exploded. There are <=10 pictures added by this branch, nothing more. Everything else is your imagination of what the future will be. And in that future, we still have time to write patches if we need to. So that never happened.

> I was not claiming that **you** should fix it yourself, i was claiming that **the ticket** needs work, working on a ticket is a collaborative task, and there is no reason to merge something that is not ready.


Why didn't you add a commit ? In my understanding of what this ticket should do, what you wanted was an 'added feature'. This is why I thought it was not a problem to have this one reviewed first. I just want to add a new feature that we have been needing for a long time. We will have to deal with the problems that this will create in the future, it is true. But well, this is not a problem now and we can fix it whenever we like, so I did not think that it was a problem for this ticket.

This being said, John solved that as the manual can be built without pictures.

> The `plot_pre_code` string could be an import statement of a genuine doctested function, currently the code of the function is within a configuration file, instead we could have a shorter `plot_pre_code` in `src/doc/common/conf.py` and a genuine `sphinx_plot` function in `src/sage/plot/misc.py` (say).


I do not understand that. `plot_pre_code` is a string variable that is expected by matplotlib's 'plot' directive for Sphinx. How would you give it anthing else than a string ?

> > And I do not see what you want me to test, the function returns no output.

> 
> For example, we could test the existence of the file and its timestamp (in case the image comes from an older build), its size (dimensions), the color of some pixels in a quite predictible image ?


The `sphinx_draw` function is meant to display a picture (this is what matplotlib intercepts), not to write it to a file. Writing it to a file is just a mean to display it "as it has to be displayed", and if anything must be doctested it should be that.

I have no idea what kind of things we could 'check' by opening the image file directly though `O_o`

> The plot directive seems not a sphinx standard,


No, it comes from matplotlib

> and i am not sure matplotlib will not change its behaviour, or remove it, rename it (e.g. if sphinx incorporate it with another name). Hence, there should perhaps be a way to report something if the drawing goes wrong.


I do not know how to check that. But that is similar to the fact that we have no way to check in the doctests that our .show() calls actually do something. If that function changed, no doctest would be broken I expect, and there are many doctests that call show.

> Back to the main issue, John's current fix is a good step, but it does not solve the fact that when we run `make` to build Sage, the doc is built with pictures with no possibility to avoid it, and then we have to rebuild the doc again to remove them.


True, true. For me you want to solve a problem that does not exist yet, but this is clearly the kind of things we will neeed someday.

> - the way it is currently written, it is uselsss for the user to set the `SPHINX_INCLUDE_PLOTS` environment variable because it is overwritten by the `builder.py` script in any case.


Right now there is no user-side doc mentionning `SPHINX_INCLUDE_PLOTS`. This variable is set and used internally only, and that works fine. If you want to advertise this to users, then indeed the name may have to be changed.

> - Note that in Sage, environment variables usually get values `yes/no` instead of `True/False`, and their name start with `SAGE_`.


The same comment applies to that, I guess.

> - Instead of adding a new `html-no-pix` FORMAT for the docbuild command, it could be better to add a `--no-pix` OPTION (or perhaps `--no-plot` ?). See `sage -docbuild` for the documentation. This is more consistent with the existing `--no-pdf-links` or `--no-colors` options, but also allows to pass the `--no-pix` (or whatever) option in the Makefile calls via the `SAGE_DOCBUILD_OPTS` command. 


If you prefer. Would you be ready to write a commit for all these changes that you request ? I do not understand why you see all these things as a reason to block this patch from being merged into Sage. I have less problems with it if you are willing to write yourself this added code, as it would not mean that this ticket is blocked until I implement what you ask.

No, you just run `make doc-html-no-pix`: this builds Sage and then the docs, but with no pictures.

My goal wasn't to introduce an environment variable for the user to set, which is why I didn't document it in the installation guide.  This style is common throughout `builder.py`.

Thanks for your commit, now we can do

```
export SAGE_DOCBUILD_OPTS+=' --no-plot'
```

and continue in a usual workflow.

My point was that many targets build docs and could not have plots turned off, which will require rebuilding doc afterwards. For example it would looks weird to add `make ptestlong-no-pix` target. Conversely, environment variables can be combined, this somehow avoids quadratic explosion of make targets.

OK. So let us let the `SAGE_SKIP_PLOT_DIRECTIVE` undocumented for now and consider it internal only.

Minor fixes: added some doc on how to use `--no-plot` within `SAGE_DOCBUILD_OPTS` and renamed the `doc-html-no-pix` make target to `doc-html-no-plot`.

Also, currently, there is a broken `(Source code)` link above each image (and above nothing if plots are disabled). The `plot_include_source` variable to remove it is broken. Though `plot_directive.py` is easily patchable to let this latter work, i did some attempts with latest version of matplotlib that proposes a (working) `plot_html_show_source_link` variable. Hence the last commit sets this variable to `True`, so that the broken link will disapear once #17618 will be fixed.

Does this link removal (and the way to do it by waiting matplotlib upgrade) sounds good ?
