As reported on [this ask question](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/25617/density_plot-defed-python-function-typeerror/), the following does not work:

```
sage: f1(a, b) = 1 - b / a
sage: f2(a, b) = 1 - a / b
sage: def f12(a, b):
....:         if a - b < 0:
....:                 return f1(a, b)
....:         else:
....:                 return f2(a, b)
sage: density_plot(f,(1,2),(1,2))
KeyError: 'text/plain'
```

While the following works:

```
sage: f1(a, b) = 1 - b / a
sage: f2(a, b) = 1 - a / b
sage: def f12(a, b):
....:     if a - b < 0:
....:         return RDF(f1(a, b))
....:     else:
....:         return RDF(f2(a, b))
sage: density_plot(f12,(1,2),(1,2))
```

That said, the real bug here is in `fast_float`, because it should still be taking this function in `setup_for_eval_on_grid` and doing the "right" thing with it.
