`sws2rst` abuses `tempfile.gettempdir()` such that it breaks if `os.path.join(tempfile.gettempdir(), file_name)` happens to exist already (in particular, if the original `.sws` file was stored in `/tmp`).

Also, I don't like

```
    try:
        process_sws(file_name)
    except Exception as e:
        print "Unable to process file ('%s')" % file_name
        print "Error message: %s" % e
        print "Exiting."
        sys.exit(1)
```
I would much rather see a full traceback rather than a "beautified" useless error message.

This strange assumption should also be removed:

```
Remark:

    The sws file(s) should be in the current directory; using an
    absolute path will result in an error."""
```

`os.tempnam` simply shouldn't be used. Why use something potentially dangerous if there are better alternatives?

Okay, hopefully this will be fine.  I couldn't get it to break with various choices of directory and path, but please do try to break it.

Incidentally, I was able to get Trac to barf by accidentally putting in a branch name starting with a colon... that seems a bit excessive, but of course I have no idea how all the plugins work.

Do you happen to know why the `try`/`except` was put here originally?

```python
    #"data" dir
    data_path = os.path.join(tempname,'sage_worksheet','data')
    if os.path.exists(data_path):
        for image in os.listdir(data_path):
            try:
                shutil.move(os.path.join(data_path, image), os.path.join(images_dir, image.replace(' ','_')))
            except shutil.Error:
                pass
```

I cannot see how this move could generate an error which can be ignored, so I removed the exception handling.

Yes, and you can add yourself to the author log too since you added me.

Regarding your original remark

```
This strange assumption should also be removed:
Remark:

    The sws file(s) should be in the current directory; using an
    absolute path will result in an error."""
```
see [here](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/10637#comment:39) and [here](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/10637#comment:65) - and Pablo said he did it, but somehow it didn't make it in.   But it turned out that switching to `mkdtemp()` completely removed the problem anyway, since the only place two paths were joined (as opposed to a path and a string like `'data'`, or something from a list of a directory) was there.  So you were okay to remove that, and I have tested it with the latest version.

> I cannot see how this move could generate an error which can be ignored, so I removed the exception handling.

How about a permissions error or something about too big of a file, or weird characters, or...? (Just brainstorming.)  That could be safely ignored; in the event of emergency, just don't copy that particular file, I guess that was the thinking.  Because after all otherwise you could never really use sws2rst at all on that worksheet.  Because of this, and because this was in the very first version Pablo put up, so I'm reluctant to have it removed.

Otherwise all should be well, I even tested some of the more unusual error possibilities by renaming/moving/not moving various files.

I don't see why such errors can be "safely ignored". The `.rst` file refers to (some of) these images! I would prefer to get an error instead of a silently broken `.rst` file.

A compromize could be to have an option `--rst-only` to create **just** the `.rst` file without the images.

We already have the help and sphinxify options, that seems reasonable.  Something like

```
parser.add_option("--rst-only",
                  action="store_true", dest="rst_only",
                  help="Create just a .rst file, without images or other resources")
```
I'm in the middle of a different branch right now, unfortunately, and am not yet comfortable enough with `git stash` to deal with this... - we'd need to update `usage` as well.  

Incidentally, the jmol images now start with pngs so it could be possible to extract those as well - obviously, not here!
