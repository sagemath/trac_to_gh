Linear Diophantine equations are cool.  Turns out there are *some* algorithms for computing the [Frobenius number](http://reference.wolfram.com/language/tutorial/Frobenius.html) as well, though I am surprised Mma claims to have a good one for big `n` - maybe it's just brute force.

Putting under number theory but if you can think of a better component, be my guest.

Component: **number theory**

Presumably the papers mentioned [here](http://mathoverflow.net/questions/23153/frobenius-number-for-three-numbers) will be useful - Wagon is pretty proud of the algorithm in Mma, but the paper points out lattE would work as well, and we have access to some such polytope things...
