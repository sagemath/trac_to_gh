I think the notion of "slender" in GrÃ¤tzer and Kelly has nothing to do with Stanley's one. GrÃ¤tzer and Kelly call a poset "slender" if it contains no 1 + 1 + 1, no 2 + 3, and no 1 + 5, where all numbers are boldfaced. I take it that the boldfaced numbers are ordinals, but even if they are not, this seems unlikely to be equivalent to Stanley's definition.

I have made a review commit. If you're OK with it, please set to pos_rev.
