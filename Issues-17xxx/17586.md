If `chi` is the trivial Dirichlet character modulo 1, then `chi.bernoulli(1)` returns different results depending on the algorithm:

```
sage: chi = DirichletGroup(1)[0]
sage: chi.bernoulli(1)  # algorithm='recurrence'
-1/2
sage: chi.bernoulli(1, algorithm='definition', cache=False)
1/2
```
The documentation is consistent with the answer `1/2`.  The answer `-1/2` can be explained as being the result of

```
sage: bernoulli(1)
-1/2
```
since the `bernoulli()` function returns the traditional "first Bernoulli numbers".

This ticket changes the method `DirichletCharacter.bernoulli()` so that it always returns `1/2` in this case, and expands the documentation.
