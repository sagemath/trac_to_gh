Current plan: Create fullypackedloop.py and class. Making underlying object the corresponding six vertex model. Add methods for ascii/graphical representation by modifying corresponding code for six vertex model. Add method in alternatingsignmatrix.py to map to fully packed loop.

For later: Add additional structure to FPLs so that the link pattern/non-crossing partition structure can be extracted.

Since I was only involved in putting the method to_fully_packed_loop, I can be one of the reviewers.
I think we should put the function __eq__ so that we can test equality using "==". For example ...

sage: m=AlternatingSignMatrix([[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,1]])
sage: m.to_fully_packed_loop() == FullyPackedLoop(m)
False
sage: FullyPackedLoop(m) == FullyPackedLoop(m)
False
