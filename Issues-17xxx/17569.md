It should be possible to use `FiniteField(p^n)` (or `FiniteField(p, n)`, see #17568) without a `name` argument to create the subfield of `FiniteField(p).algebraic_closure()` of cardinality `p^n`.  This would mean

```
GF(p, n) = GF(p^n) = GF(p).algebraic_closure().subfield(n)[0]
```

Why did you remove the whole `# The following is a temporary solution...` block? Do you want `conway` and `prefix` to continue to be supported?

1. If no => deprecate it.
2. If yes => document it properly (i.e. move the comment you just removed to the actual docstring) and add some doctests like

```
sage: GF(3^10, conway=True, prefix='z') is GF(3^10)
sage: GF(3^10, conway=True, prefix='foo')
```

Currently, you can feed random keyword arguments to most (all?) of the finite field constructors and they'll have no effect.

```
sage: GF(27,'a',blah=True)
Finite Field in a of size 3^3
```
I don't see a problem in having `conway` behave in the same manner.  Why raise a deprecation warning when the code can just keep working without any change?

You are effecting a change in the behaviour of the code. E.g.
`sage: GF(27,'a',conway=True)` currently throws an exception, and this is will no longer be the case. (Perhaps one can come up with a more interesting example, but that's beside the point).

These useless-but-accepted arguments are a plague. There was a wealth of them in many 'plot' functions at a time: you tried to give a color to something, the argument 'color="red"' was accepted but nothing happened.

The most common way in which they are a pain are typos:

```
sage: GF(16,'x',checkirreducible=True)
Finite Field in x of size 2^4
```

The side-effect of not having a '_' in `check_irreducible` is that... It is ignored. And of course no exception to tell you.

About having an effect, here is one (thanks to `UniqueRepresentation`, I expect)

```
sage: GF(27,'a') == GF(27,'a')
True
sage: GF(27,'a',whatever=158) == GF(27,'a')
False
sage: GF(27,'a')(1) + GF(27,'a')(1)
2
sage: GF(27,'a',whatever=158)(1) + GF(27,'a')(1)
TypeError: unsupported operand parent(s) for '+': 'Finite Field in a of size 3^3' and 'Finite Field in a of size 3^3'
```

That's certainly a serious bug, but outside the scope of this ticket.

Still, I think that `conway` needs to be deprecated because it used to do something. Users should be made aware that the `conway` argument is no longer needed. Something like this should work:

```python
if 'conway' in kwds:
    del kwds['conway']
    from sage.misc.superseded import deprecation
    deprecation(17569, "the 'conway' argument is deprecated, pseudo-conway polynomials are now used by default if no variable name is given") 
```

<div id="comment:23" align="right">comment:23</div>

can be very slow when using a random irreducible polynomial
as the modulus would make it very fast.

Changing the default is discussed at #31434 if anybody who
participated in this ticket wants to chime in.
