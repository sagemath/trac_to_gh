Currently, Sage does not know how to factor multivariate polynomials over the integers:

```python
sage: R.<x,y> = ZZ[]
sage: p = 12 * (x*y - 1) * (x + 2*y + 3)
sage: p.factor()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
NotImplementedError: Factorization of multivariate polynomials over non-fields is not implemented.
```

I propose to implement it using the factorization over `QQ`. Of course it may not be the best possible solution, but at least it is some (temporary?) workaround. This now gives:

```python
sage: R.<x,y> = ZZ[]
sage: p = 12 * (x*y - 1) * (x + 2*y + 3)
sage: p.factor()
2^2 * 3 * (x + 2*y + 3) * (x*y - 1)
```

I have a question: Since the computation for non-fields is enclosed inside a `try`/`except` construction, if a computation is long and interrupted with `Ctrl+c`, a `KeyboardInterrupt` exception is raised and caught by the `except` to raise a `NotImplementedError` exception.

What is a correct solution so that it does not return `NotImplementedError`? 

* Should the `KeyboardInterrupt` exception be filtered?
* Should the `try`/`except` be enclosed in `sig_on()`/`sig_off()`?
* Something else?

Actually, polynomials over the ring of integers of a number field belong to the class `MPolynomial_polydict` (defined in `multi_polynomial_element.py`) and not to `MPolynomial_libsingular` (defined in `multi_polynomial_libsingular.pyx`). So it does not make sense to test this in this file.¹

It would be interesting to have such an example of a non-working case. Though I do not know for which ring(s) do the polynomials belong to the class `MPolynomial_libsingular`.

¹ One may do the same thing for rings of integers of a number field to obtain a factorization algorithm. The point is that the returned factors are not in the rings of integers in this case, so we have to reconstruct them. It's a bit more work than in the current case.

2. Is the check for integral domain really needed? If it's not an integral domain, it will be caught by the branch below.

Done.

These both tests were not really needed. I added them in order to give more meaningful error messages. Now, the error message for the `SymbolicRing` is kind of weird, but the test I added was probably not the right place where to correct this.¹ 

For non-integral domains, you know have that `multivariate factorization over Ring of integers modulo 4 is not implemented` (for instance) while with the previous version it said that the factorization over non-integral rings is not implemented. I personally find the previous message more informative, but that is a matter of taste and I am also fine with the current message.


> 4. The message `Factorization of multivariate polynomials over Symbolic Ring is not implemented. Consider using multivariate polynomial rings instead.` is confusing, it essentially says "factorization of multivariate polynomials is not supported, use multivariate polynomials instead".
  
Not relevant anymore, though I agree with the confusing aspect of this message!

¹ The main problem is that the `SymbolicRing` has no `is_finite()` method. Thus we get a `NotImplementedError` which is not very informative. See #18054.
