These were simply unused. If you think we should keep them "for reference", there is always the git log.

And `_det_pari` was copied in #16803, I just deleted one of the two copies.

I'm against removing them.   Just because they aren't explicitly used elsewhere in Sage, doesn't mean they aren't useful to have.  For example, 

- I used them in testing the original patch (having multiple ways of computing products in order to compare) that this is following up on.
 
- At one time Linbox was the fastest for multiplying matrices (at least in 2007, when Clement Pernet was my postdoc at UW).   Now it's terrible, at least as it is built in Sage.  Having the function _multiply_linbox makes it easier to test the speed of linbox versus flint (or multimodular) at any point.  If you remove it, then suddenly this becomes more difficult.    It's entirely plausible that linbox could again become faster than FLINT, and it would be more difficult to know without this function.

- I personally don't trust FLINT, and having an easy alternative to test (or swap out for) matrix multiplication makes me happier.   I remember clearly times in the past when FLINT gave flat out wrong answers when multiplying large polynomials (burried deep in some p-adic cohomology calculations), and -- when tracking this down -- being able to instrument things so we could easily run the whole big computation with either FLINT or PARI was critical.

Here's a better reason: it's broken!

```
sage: A = identity_matrix(ZZ,3)
sage: A._multiply_linbox(A)
[0 0 0]
[0 0 0]
[0 0 0]
```

Fixing this at #17094...

In C, this simply cannot be done. A variable on the stack starts out in a totally unpredictable state.
