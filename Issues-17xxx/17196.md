Most bitset operations state something like

```
    We assume the two sets have the same size.  Otherwise, the
    behavior of this function is undefined and the function may
    segfault.
```

However, in fact most of these requirements can be relaxed.

In many cases, I simply change the comment to indicate what the real conditions are. For shifts, I actually change the implementation slightly such that the condition becomes `r.size <= a.size + n` which is useful for #15820.

Also move bitsets to `src/sage/data_structures`.

How clever are compilers?

The question is related to idioms like `n % GMP_LIMB_BITS`.

`GMP_LIMB_BITS` is a power of two, and it is known at compile time. Hence, `n % GMP_LIMB_BITS` does not involve a generally very expensive `%`-operation, but boils down to a simple `&`.

Will compilers automatically use this optimization? If not, then I think we should introduce an integer constant `mod_mp_bits_per_limb` (see #15820), so that `n % GMP_LIMB_BITS == n & mp_bits_per_limb`. If yes, then I guess one can also avoid `n >> index_shift`, and use `n//GMP_LIMB_BITS` instead.

I would actually suggest the opposite. Keep assuming that bitsets have size > 0 and implement empty biseqs using bitsets of size 1. I think this will be the simplest.

Why do you think this is a bad idea?

Nathann, if I understand correctly, the plan is to eventually move
- all sage-specific data structures (e.g.,, those that only make sense within Sage's coercion framework) to `structure`, 
- all data structures that make sense without Sage and are not tied to a specific mathematical topic (bitsets, bitmatrices, bounded integer sequences, the dictionaries that are currently defined in `sage.structure.coerce_dict`) to `data_structures`

and then `misc` should be reserved to miscellaneous *mathematical* topics (I think this is the definition according to the docs).

I understand. I merely mentionned that by only moving bitsets here the code would be in a weird state where only bitsets are in the new folder while others are still scattered.

It also feels weird to have a directory named "structure" and one named "data structures". Do you have any idea of how "structure" could be renamed ?
