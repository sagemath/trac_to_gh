Most bitset operations state something like

```
    We assume the two sets have the same size.  Otherwise, the
    behavior of this function is undefined and the function may
    segfault.
```

However, in fact most of these requirements can be relaxed.

In many cases, I simply change the comment to indicate what the real conditions are. For shifts, I actually change the implementation slightly such that the condition becomes `r.size <= a.size + n` which is useful for #15820.

Also move bitsets to `src/sage/data_structures`.

<a id='comment:11'></a>How clever are compilers?

The question is related to idioms like `n % GMP_LIMB_BITS`.

`GMP_LIMB_BITS` is a power of two, and it is known at compile time. Hence, `n % GMP_LIMB_BITS` does not involve a generally very expensive `%`-operation, but boils down to a simple `&`.

Will compilers automatically use this optimization? If not, then I think we should introduce an integer constant `mod_mp_bits_per_limb` (see #15820), so that `n % GMP_LIMB_BITS == n & mp_bits_per_limb`. If yes, then I guess one can also avoid `n >> index_shift`, and use `n//GMP_LIMB_BITS` instead.

I would actually suggest the opposite. Keep assuming that bitsets have size > 0 and implement empty biseqs using bitsets of size 1. I think this will be the simplest.

Why do you think this is a bad idea?

<a id='comment:19'></a>About moving that to structure... If you want to move bitsets from misc to structure and so make this 'structure' folder mean "data structure", could you also move the other data structure files from misc there ? I looked at the list and it seems that only `binary_tree.*` and `binary_matrix.*` are there.

It's not `structure`, it's `data_structures`. And moving other things should be not on this ticket.

So we will have two folders named `structure/`, `data_structure/`, and data structure code in both `data_structure/` and `misc/`.

Cool.

Nathann, if I understand correctly, the plan is to eventually move
- all sage-specific data structures (e.g.,, those that only make sense within Sage's coercion framework) to `structure`, 
- all data structures that make sense without Sage and are not tied to a specific mathematical topic (bitsets, bitmatrices, bounded integer sequences, the dictionaries that are currently defined in `sage.structure.coerce_dict`) to `data_structures`

and then `misc` should be reserved to miscellaneous *mathematical* topics (I think this is the definition according to the docs).

I understand. I merely mentionned that by only moving bitsets here the code would be in a weird state where only bitsets are in the new folder while others are still scattered.

It also feels weird to have a directory named "structure" and one named "data structures". Do you have any idea of how "structure" could be renamed ?
