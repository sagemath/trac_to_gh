Start a notebook server with

```
sage: notebook(server_pool=["guest@localhost"])
```
and then enter in a notebook cell

```
plot(sin(x))
```

In **Sage 6.4.beta5**, this works as it should.

In **Sage 6.4.beta6**, this returns `None` and does not show the plot.

In **Sage 6.4.rc0** and later, no plot is shown and the following error appears in the Sage session:

```

Not really, since all this happens serially. The client computes something (which might include saving graphics), then sends a message to the server that it is finished.

> Just out of curiosity, do you two have restrictive umasks?

No, the reason the graphics file ends up with `0600` permission is the fact that it is created as temporary file. And temporary files have `0600` permissions by default.
