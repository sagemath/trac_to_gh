While reading #17384, I thought that a global cleanup of `Graph.__init__` and `DiGraph.__init__` would be good. We implement:

1)

```
- data = dict([u, list(data[u])] for u in data)
+ data = {u: list(v) for u,v in data.iteritems()}
```

2) call to `uniq` is bad since it calls a useless `sorted`: each appearance of `{{{len(uniq(X))}}}` is replaced with `{{{len(set(X))}}}`.

3) `dict.iteritems` is more readable and faster

```
sage: d = {randint(0,1000): [randint(0,1000) for _ in range(10)] for _ in range(100)}
sage: timeit("for i in d: j = d[i]", number=2000)
2000 loops, best of 3: 9.75 µs per loop
sage: timeit("for i,j in d.iteritems(): pass", number=2000)
2000 loops, best of 3: 7.3 µs per loop
```

4) avoid iterating through the elements of the adjacency matrix when possible

and more...

Depends on #17384

Thanks for the review.

To answer your interrogation `is` and `==` are **very** different, and `is` will **always** be faster.

The command `bool is False` is treated without asking anything to the object `bool`. It is just the Python kernel that checks whether the memory addresses match or not. For `==` a method of the object `bool` is called. Even if the comparison is implemented with something like `return self is other` you do not avoid that function call.

But I am not sure that those 18 non seconds are of critical importance in the creation of a graph... it was more a matter of uniformization ;-)

While that's an improvement, the fastest way is to do `if x:` or `if not x:`.

```
sage: x = True
sage: %timeit if x is True: pass
10000000 loops, best of 3: 165 ns per loop
sage: %timeit if x is False: pass
10000000 loops, best of 3: 148 ns per loop
sage: %timeit if x: pass
10000000 loops, best of 3: 91.9 ns per loop
sage: %timeit if not x: pass
10000000 loops, best of 3: 80.1 ns per loop
sage: x = False
sage: %timeit if x is True: pass
10000000 loops, best of 3: 148 ns per loop
sage: %timeit if x is False: pass
10000000 loops, best of 3: 165 ns per loop
sage: %timeit if x: pass
10000000 loops, best of 3: 79.1 ns per loop
sage: %timeit if not x: pass
10000000 loops, best of 3: 91.9 ns per loop
```
So I'd change things to use that. Plus you can simplify things like:

```diff
+         if ((loops is None or loops is False) and
-         if (not loops and
```
(and if statements like that are more common).

You are right... I will do the changes (but your timings are not complete since you forgot the case `x = None`). There were occurrences at other places in the code. The advantage I see is that, while you read it, you know that `None` is one possible choice whereas

```
if not x and some_condition:
    if x is False:
        raise ValueError
    x = True
```
is a bit less verbose.

True. When I was doing my timings I wasn't thinking of the `None` simplifications, but FTR:

```
sage: x = None
sage: %timeit if x is None: pass
10000000 loops, best of 3: 117 ns per loop
sage: %timeit if x is not None: pass
10000000 loops, best of 3: 102 ns per loop
sage: %timeit if x: pass
10000000 loops, best of 3: 88 ns per loop
sage: %timeit if not x: pass
10000000 loops, best of 3: 101 ns per loop
```
I would say the loss of verbosity (according to FF, I'm not making that word up like I thought) is covered by python ducktyping. Anyways, I don't really care that much, so if you don't think it should be changed, then feel free to leave it. Thanks for cleaning this up.

I agree that we should try to let the code as readable as possible, especially for non critical code.

If we want to optimize further, there is apparently a small difference between `x is not None` and `not x is None` ;-)

```
sage: x = None
sage: %timeit if x is not None: pass
10000000 loops, best of 3: 57.8 ns per loop
sage: %timeit if not x is None: pass
10000000 loops, best of 3: 57.2 ns per loop

Hi,

Actually it was good to have another look at the code since I introduced a bug for weighted digraph.... (see the test in the last commit that will appear in a second).

@dcoudert: actually `is not` is an operator that should be as fast as `is`. While `not` involves some function call... it is strange that you get those timings.

It seems. Does not happen otherwise `O_o`

It is possible to test it with `the_certificate == { the actual dictionary }` but it seems overkill. +1 for a `certify=False`.
