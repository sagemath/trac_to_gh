While reading #17384, I thought that a global cleanup of `Graph.__init__` and `DiGraph.__init__` would be good. We implement:

1)

```
- data = dict([u, list(data[u])] for u in data)
+ data = {u: list(v) for u,v in data.iteritems()}
```

2) call to `uniq` is bad since it calls a useless `sorted`: each appearance of ``len(uniq(X))`` is replaced with ``len(set(X))``.

3) `dict.iteritems` is more readable and faster

```
sage: d = {randint(0,1000): [randint(0,1000) for _ in range(10)] for _ in range(100)}
sage: timeit("for i in d: j = d[i]", number=2000)
2000 loops, best of 3: 9.75 µs per loop
sage: timeit("for i,j in d.iteritems(): pass", number=2000)
2000 loops, best of 3: 7.3 µs per loop
```

4) avoid iterating through the elements of the adjacency matrix when possible

and more...

<a id='comment:4'></a>Thanks for the review.

To answer your interrogation `is` and `==` are **very** different, and `is` will **always** be faster.

The command `bool is False` is treated without asking anything to the object `bool`. It is just the Python kernel that checks whether the memory addresses match or not. For `==` a method of the object `bool` is called. Even if the comparison is implemented with something like `return self is other` you do not avoid that function call.

But I am not sure that those 18 non seconds are of critical importance in the creation of a graph... it was more a matter of uniformization ;-)

You are right... I will do the changes (but your timings are not complete since you forgot the case `x = None`). There were occurrences at other places in the code. The advantage I see is that, while you read it, you know that `None` is one possible choice whereas

```
if not x and some_condition:
    if x is False:
        raise ValueError
    x = True
```
is a bit less verbose.

Actually it was good to have another look at the code since I introduced a bug for weighted digraph.... (see the test in the last commit that will appear in a second).

`@`dcoudert: actually `is not` is an operator that should be as fast as `is`. While `not` involves some function call... it is strange that you get those timings.

Nope: `loops` can be `None` (or anything that does evaluate to `False` such as `0`, `[]`, `()`, etc). Have a look at [comment:6].

Aahahaha. And do you want to know why I did not rewrite it all ? Because I thought that nobody would be willing to review the patch afterwards `:-P`

True true, I do not complain `:-P`

As to improvements, it was not really the goal: I would really like to make those functions cleaner by splitting them into subfunction, and perhaphs unify a bit better Graph/Digraph is possible. Just a rewrite, but for a cleaner code.

This has something to do with this ticket? Strictly speaking, those dictionary are the same... the thing is that the keys have no well defined ordering. The only reasonable thing I see is to remove this `certify = True` in the test. What do you think?
