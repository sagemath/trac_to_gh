First, Darij, reviewer name.

Second, you should set `.boxes` as an alias for `table` and `plain` for `diagram` by adding `alias=dict(plain='diagram', boxes="table")`, see the options above the `ascii_art` for instance. This way you need far less code for the same effect you're trying to achieve (and it's easier to maintain).

Unfortunately, due to the current limitations of the doctesting framework, it doesn't know to run those tests in (dynamically) generated doc. See #14272. Also you'll have to update `doctest/sources.py` and it has a test to catch exactly how many tests we are currently skipping.
