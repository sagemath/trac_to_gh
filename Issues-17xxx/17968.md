The following was reported on [this ask question](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/26212/how-to-evaluate-int_12-ex3-dx/):

```
sage: f(x) = exp(x^3)
sage: f.integrate(x, 1, 2)
-1/3*gamma(1/3, -1) + 1/3*gamma(1/3, -8)
sage: f.integrate(x, 1, 2).n()
-138.557717219510 - 238.442320120796*I
```

`numerical_integral` and `sympy` seem to agree on the result:

```
sage: numerical_integral(f,1,2)
(275.5109837633117, 3.0587863771115628e-12)
```


```
sage: import sympy
sage: f = f._sympy_()
sage: g = f.integrate() ; g
exp(-I*pi/3)*gamma(1/3)*lowergamma(1/3, x**3*exp_polar(I*pi))/(9*gamma(4/3))
sage: h = g.subs(x,2) - g.subs(x,1)
sage: h.n()
275.510983763312 - 1.68744844960818e-21*I
```

got it! 

i copied the doctest which is just a couple of lines above ("Check that 11737 is fixed::..."). the difference is that the numerical noise in the imag part of the integral of `exp(x^3)` did not "magically vanish" by setting `prec=54`, as it is the case for the integral in the 11737 test. hence, i took the `real_part()`.
