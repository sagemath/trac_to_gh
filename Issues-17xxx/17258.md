This is a significant bug in the 3d graphics that Theron Hitchman found.  It's easy to replicate on the command line, and doesn't involve actually rendering anything.    Basically, in some cases, if g and h are 3d scenes, then doing "k = g+h" actually *mutates* g itself.   This ends up breaking multi-step constructions of scenes (e.g., [1]).

```
sage: g = point3d([0,-2,-2]); g += point3d([2,-2,-2])
sage: print len(g.all)
2
sage: h = g + arrow([0,-2,-2], [2,-2,-2])   # this should *NOT* change g
sage: print len(g.all)   # it changed g

Wow, interesting bug, and relatively subtle since people usually just add plots willy-nilly.  I'll try to confirm this works right in a few minutes, but the code seems fine.
