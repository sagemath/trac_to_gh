We currently have the following:

```
sage: D = DiGraph([[1, 2]], immutable=True)
sage: Graph(D)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
NotImplementedError                       Traceback (most recent call last)
...
NotImplementedError: An immutable graph does not change name
```
For the record, this works

```
sage: D = DiGraph([[1, 2]])
sage: Graph(D)
Graph on 2 vertices
```

I'm also wondering about the error type of (attempted) mutations of immutable (di)graphs. Some raise a `ValueError`, others raise a `NotImplementedError`. This needs to be made consistent at some point.

`NotImplementedError` is certainly not right, it seems to imply that it could get implemented someday. I also find `ValueError` dubious, since there is not really a "value" which is wrong.

I would actually vote for `TypeError`, which is what you get when you an operation which is not supported on some type, similar to

```
>>> "aaa"/3
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for /: 'str' and 'int'
```
