sage: R = ZpCA(5,5,print_mode='val-unit')
sage: A = matrix(R,3,3,[250,2369,1147,106,927,362,90,398,2483])
sage: A
[5^3 * 2 + O(5^5)    2369 + O(5^5)    1147 + O(5^5)]
[    106 + O(5^5)     927 + O(5^5)     362 + O(5^5)]

sage: A.det()
2634 + O(5^5)
sage: ~A
Traceback (most recent call last):

ZeroDivisionError: input matrix must be nonsingular
```
The problem is that Sage doesn't pivot when doing Gaussian elimination:

```
sage: K = R.fraction_field()
sage: A.change_ring(K).augment(identity_matrix(K,3))._echelon_classical()
[       1 + O(5^2)           O(5^-1)           O(5^-1)           O(5^-1)            O(5^2)   5^-1 * 7 + O(5)]
[           O(5^2)        1 + O(5^2)       13 + O(5^2)        4 + O(5^2)            O(5^5) 5^2 * 19 + O(5^4)]
[           O(5^3)            O(5^0)            O(5^0)            O(5^0)        1 + O(5^2)   5^-1 * 8 + O(5)]

Hi,
I have added partial pivoting and scaled partial pivoting to the code,
including some examples for doctesting.
For now, I set scaled partial pivoting to be the default algorithm only for discrete valuation fields. This is until we will have a better framework for general valuation rings.

Also, I have not implemented complete pivoting, as it is only rarely needed and very inefficient.
