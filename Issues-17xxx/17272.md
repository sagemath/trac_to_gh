```
The problem is that Sage doesn't pivot when doing Gaussian elimination:

```
sage: K = R.fraction_field()
sage: A.change_ring(K).augment(identity_matrix(K,3))._echelon_classical()
[       1 + O(5^2)           O(5^-1)           O(5^-1)           O(5^-1)            O(5^2)   5^-1 * 7 + O(5)]
[           O(5^2)        1 + O(5^2)       13 + O(5^2)        4 + O(5^2)            O(5^5) 5^2 * 19 + O(5^4)]

<a id='comment:2'></a>Hi,
I have added partial pivoting and scaled partial pivoting to the code,
including some examples for doctesting.
For now, I set scaled partial pivoting to be the default algorithm only for discrete valuation fields. This is until we will have a better framework for general valuation rings.

Also, I have not implemented complete pivoting, as it is only rarely needed and very inefficient.
