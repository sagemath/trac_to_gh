```
Recent moves in the tutorials removed some pages in the tutorials, which creates dead links both in worksheets (e.g. pointers to the local live doc) and webpages (e.g. pages pointing to http://www.sagemath.org/doc).

The removed pages should be replaced by a small page containing:
- a line explaining that the page is obsolete (kind of deprecation warning)
- a link to its replacement

Concerned tickets seem to be: #17615 #17614 #17555

I am not speaking about keeping links stable forever, but indicating where is the follow-up. My point was just to re-create moved tutorial pages (bordeaux2008.rst, etc) with a reference to their new location.

Without such a fix, the recent changes in the doc (which were necessary to clean things up) create dead links all over the web (e.g. any webpage pointing to the bordeaux2008 thematic tutorial will point to a non-existing page) as well as on worksheets (this happens when you write links to some live tutorial within a worksheet, e.g. <code>\`LP tutorial </doc/live/thematic_tutorials/linear_programming.html>\`__</code>), which is why i consider this as blocker, at least a very annoying defect, since it actually breaks things.

There could be a deprecation period : "This page does not exist anymore, please refer to that page. The current page will disappear on XXX.".

> * name one other large project that does it by sprinkling auxiliary doc files around

Name one other large project that knows about broken links and just don't care. If there is a better solution, let us take it.

> * is delaying Sage-6.5 going to fix any of this?

The problem is introduced in Sage-6.5, it is not a bad policy to fight against regression from a release to the next one.

The next great thing we should do about the doc is try to make this `--warn-links` option the default one. Actually... Volker: wouldn't it be possible/easy to enable this option by default (in the 'make doc') for "some" folders at least ?

At some point the graph folder did not contain any broken link, and it would be good to keep it this way. On the other hand some folders contain a LOT of broken links, and we would need quite some work before being able to build their doc with this flag.

What would you think of enabling it for some folders right now so that we do not introduce new broken links there, and add new folders to this restricted list from time to time so that someday we do not have any broken link (that we can detect) ?
