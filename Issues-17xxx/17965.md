Some classes in Sage implement the inverse of an element through the
inverse method:

```

Some other through the `__invert__` method:

structure/factorization.py:    def __invert__(self):
```

Usually they provide a crosslink so that `__invert__` and
`inverse` are equivalent, but this is done on a case by case bases,
so of course such links are missing here and there:

```
sage: ~AA(sqrt(~2))
1.414213562373095?
sage: AA(sqrt(~2)).inverse()
...
AttributeError: 'AlgebraicReal' object has no attribute 'inverse'
```

```
sage: R.<u,v,w> = QQ[]
sage: f = EllipticCurve_from_cubic(u^3 + v^3 + w^3, [1,-1,0], morphism=True)
sage: f.inverse()
Scheme morphism:
...
sage: ~f
...
TypeError: bad operand type for unary ~: 'WeierstrassTransformationWithInverse_class'
```


Shall we change the code to systematically implement `__invert__` as
per Python's convention, and then implement the cross link `inverse`
-> `__invert__` once for all high up in the class hierarchy,
typically in `Magmas.ElementMethods`?

Caveat: this won't cover all cases since we have invertible elements
that don't belong to a magma; e.g. a isomorphisms between two
different parents; so it will still be necessary to handle a couple
special cases by hand.

See also comment about `__inverse__` in
sage.categories.coxeter_groups.py around line 699.

Note: the default implementation ~f = 1/f provided by Element should
probably be implemented in `Monoids.ElementMethods`; see also #17692.

Note: the qqbar classes also implement an `invert` method, but that's
for a slightly different use case. So we may, or not, want to make
this uniform too. `invert` does not fit Sage's usual verb/noun
convention since it's a verb while it is not inplace.

I am thinking to move the "Inverse" axioms from magmas to monoids. 

Because the notion of inverse does not really make sense in magmas, where left and right inverses can be different.

We may eventually need to have weaker axioms LeftInverses and RightInverses.
But is there an inconvenient in having an axiom that states the existence

I don't think too many people are going to be looking at the documentation of `__invert__` or `inverse()` as that is generally pretty clear.

That being said, I am not really a fan of putting technical implementation details in public documentation:

```diff
-            This is an alias for inversion, defined in ``__invert__``.
+            This is an alias for inversion, which can be invoked by ``~x``
+            for an instance ``x``.
-
-            Element classes should implement ``__invert__`` only.
```
I would probably put the last part as a code comment. However, in this case, because it is specifications for implementors, it could be okay. The change in the first part is to indicate how a more casual user can use this.

What about for additive monoids? Perhaps we need to add "multiplicative" to the documentation above.

I am not sure how I feel about removing the generic `1 / self` for inverse in `Element`. Is that implemented in one of the categories? Should we be worried about a slowdown with it no longer being Cython?

I have changed that according to your suggestion. Implementation detail is now a comment in the code.

> What about for additive monoids? Perhaps we need to add "multiplicative" to the documentation above.


I have no idea. I thought that there was another category for additive monoids ?

> I am not sure how I feel about removing the generic `1 / self` for inverse in `Element`. Is that implemented in one of the categories? Should we be worried about a slowdown with it no longer being Cython?


This is indeed a delicate point. Having both that and the division defined using product by the inverse easily leads to infinite loops. It seems safer to break the possibility of this kind of loop.

Thank you.

There is, but we try to keep the two somewhat consistent. There is also the join category, where "inverse" becomes slightly vague.

I would rather have the infinite loop (which there are protections against) and leave the choice of implementation to the developer. If it does go into an infinite loop, it is indicating that something needs to be implemented (unfortunately, I don't know a good mechanism for checking this). At the very least it is a backwards incompatible change.

#17692 is independent of these changes (and the main proposal has already been done somewhere else).
