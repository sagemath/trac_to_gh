As discussed on [sage-release](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-release/bfrzhrmfWik), the latest Maxima upgrade (#17514) inadvertently introduced a dependency on Automake 1.11.  This is caused by `build/pkgs/maxima/patches/makeinfo.patch`, which patches a `Makefile.am` but not the corresponding `Makefile.in`.

I had a long conversation with David Kirkby when I introduced the "touch" trick way back when the problem appeared, I am not sure it is all on trac but at the time upstream was a bit confused that there was a problem. It was like they didn't really use the "install" target.

I don't know precisely why the \"touch\" trick stopped working; perhaps `make` clobbers some dependencies of `maxima.info`.  Anyway, the current fix seems to work as well.",

> I had a long conversation with David Kirkby when I introduced the "touch" trick way back when the problem appeared, I am not sure it is all on trac but at the time upstream was a bit confused that there was a problem. It was like they didn't really use the "install" target.

There is indeed a long discussion about this on #10773.  I don't know precisely why the "touch" trick stopped working; perhaps `make` clobbers some dependencies of `maxima.info`.  Anyway, the current fix seems to work as well.

The current fix is superior. In fact we probably won't notice when it stopped being necessary - if it ever happens.
