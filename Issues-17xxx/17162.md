Come on... I do exactly what you would do, i.e. read Wikipedia and fix the doc `:-P`

I am not exactly an expert on this topic `^^;`

That's more Dima's thing I would say.

Huh?  But you're the graph theorist, not me... 

Anyway, this looks fine - I bet they were ordering regular graphs first by degree, *then* by order, maybe.
