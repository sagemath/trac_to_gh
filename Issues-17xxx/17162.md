The documentation for [semi-symmetric graphs](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/graphs/sage/graphs/graph.html#sage.graphs.graph.Graph.is_semi_symmetric) claims that the [Gray graph](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_graph) is the smallest such graph, but the [Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-symmetric_graph) referenced in the documentation does not concur.  (It apparently is the smallest *cubic* such graph.)  Either way, there needs to be a fix - on Wikipedia or, more likely, in our documentation.  (Note that the Folkman graphs is also in Sage.)

Come on... I do exactly what you would do, i.e. read Wikipedia and fix the doc `:-P`

I am not exactly an expert on this topic `^^;`
