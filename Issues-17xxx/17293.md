In the following example, taking the dual works for the isogeny `phi` but fails for the negated isogeny `psi`:

```
sage: k.<s> = QuadraticField(2)
sage: E = EllipticCurve(k, [-3*s*(4 + 5*s), 2*s*(2 + 14*s + 11*s^2)])
sage: phi = E.isogenies_prime_degree(3)[0]
sage: psi = -phi
sage: phi.dual()
Isogeny of degree 3 from Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 = x^3 + (108*s-270)*x + (-1296*s+1512) over Number Field in s with defining polynomial x^2 - 2 to Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 = x^3 + (-12*s-30)*x + (48*s+56) over Number Field in s with defining polynomial x^2 - 2
sage: psi.dual()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
NameError: global name 'E0' is not defined
```
There is also a (trivial) bug that causes the dual to remain cached if the isogeny is changed by precomposing or postcomposing with an isomorphism (which is the way negation is implemented):

```
sage: -(phi.dual()) == (-phi).dual()                                          
False                                                                          
```
