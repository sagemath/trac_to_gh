The current implementation replaces LaTeX commands in the examples section, too.
See for example

```
sage: from sage.structure.indexed_generators import IndexedGenerators
sage: IndexedGenerators?
```
That's bad. Users might complain, that they don't get the results show in the examples.

P.S. The ticket description should be updated.

I think that's complicated to fix. We would need to detect when we're in an EXAMPLES or TESTS block and ignore the output, but otherwise process the output. I guess we can do that, but it's a little annoying to do perfectly. This really should be done for each of `detex`, `process_dollars`, `process_extlinks`, `process_mathtt`. So maybe it should actually be done in `format`:

```
if not in examples block:
    detex(next line)
    process_dollars(next_lines)
    ...
```
So everything would need to be rewritten with this logic in mind. Alternatively, each of those functions will duplicate some code which keeps track of whether it's processing a line in an examples block.

I think that really, functions which have LaTeX output in their EXAMPLES (or elsewhere in their docstrings), and if that LaTeX should not be processed, then they should have their docstrings decorated with `nodetex`. That's why `nodetex` is available. Maybe we should add it to the IndexedGenerators docstring.
