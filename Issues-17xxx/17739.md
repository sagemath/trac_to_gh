At the moment, `desolve` behaves like this even with trivial separable ODEs:

```
sage: t = var('t')
sage: y=function('y')(t)
sage: desolve(diff(y,t)-y^2,y)
-1/y(t) == _C + t
sage: desolve(diff(y,t)-y^2+y,y)
log(y(t) - 1) - log(y(t)) == _C + t
sage: desolve(diff(y,t)-y^2-1,y)
arctan(y(t)) == _C + t
```
They could be solved by substituting a variable for `y(t)` and calling `solve`. Only if there is no solution from `solve` the integrated equation should be given.


Upstream: Not yet reported upstream; Will do shortly.

Status: new

This would yield (doctest):

```
sage: t = var('t')
sage: y=function('y')(t)
sage: desolve(diff(y,t)-y^2,y)
-1/(_C + t)
sage: desolve(diff(y,t)-y^2+y,y)
-1/(e^(_C + t) - 1)
sage: desolve(diff(y,t)-y^2-1,y)
tan(_C + t)
```

Do we resolve this in Sage, Maxima, or both?

So, the inconsistency is in Sage, which removes 'y==' from the results that have it, perhaps to facilitate further usage of the expression.

```
    if is_SymbolicEquation(soln) and soln.lhs() == dvar:
        # Remark: Here we do not check that the right hand side does not depend on dvar.
        # This probably will not hapen for soutions obtained via ode2, anyway.
        soln = soln.rhs()
```
We could now either remove the snippet, in order to always get an equation, or always try to solve for `dvar` and return an equation only when no solution is found.
