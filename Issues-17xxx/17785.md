The substitution code for multipolynomial (using Singular) results in a SIGSEV. For example, with `R.<x,y,z> = QQ[]` and any of

```
x.subs(None,y=x,x=0,z=y)
x.subs(None,x=0,y=x,z=x)
x.subs(None,x=0,y=0,z=x)
x.subs(None,x=0,y=0,z=z)
```
Though, if we do not mix integer and variable in the substitutions it seems to work fine

```
sage: x.subs(None,x=0,y=0,z=0)
0
sage: x.subs(None,x=z,y=x,z=y)
z
sage: x.subs(None,x=x,y=y,z=z)
x
```
And the following also works

```
sage: x.subs(None,x=0,y=x,z=0)
0
sage: x.subs(None,x=0,y=y,z=0)
0
sage: x.subs(None,x=0,y=z,z=0)
0
sage: x.subs(None,x=y,y=z,z=0)
y
sage: x.subs(None,x=y,y=0,z=0)
y
sage: x.subs(None,x=z,y=0,z=0)
z
```

Original report

The following code gives a coredump in Sage-6.5.rc3:

```
a11,a12,a13,a21,a22,a23,a31,a32,a33 = allvars = var("a11,a12,a13,a21,a22,a23,a31,a32,a33")
P=PolynomialRing(QQ,allvars,order='degrevlex')
P.inject_variables()
A=matrix([[a11,a12,a13,],[a21,a22,a23,],[a31,a32,a33]])
A.subs(a11=a13,a21=-a23,a31=a33,a22=0)
```


Keywords: crash, SIGSEGV, substitution

<a id='comment:1'></a>Hello,

This is actually unrelated to matrices

```
sage: a22.subs(None,a11=a13,a21=-a23,a31=a33,a22=0)
...
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occurred in Sage.
This probably occurred because a *compiled* component of Sage has a bug
in it and is not properly wrapped with sig_on(), sig_off().
Sage will now terminate.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

(and as a sided remark, it is useless to declare the variables with `var`; the command `var` creates variables in the symbolic ring which have nothing to do with the variables of the polynomial ring)
