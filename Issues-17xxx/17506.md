Broken circuits and no broken circuit (NBC) sets are important aspects of matroid theory. In particular, a basis for the Orlik-Solomon algebra can be given by NBC sets. This implements a basic iterator for broken circuits and NBC sets.

I'm sorry, I didn't look at this ticket before. You add TWO methods to Matroid that do the same thing:

Matroid.no_broken_circuit_sets

and

Matroid.nbc_sets.

This is needlessly cluttering up the list of methods a user sees through autocomplete. Please keep one of the two (preferably the long one, as it is more descriptive)

I disagree. People in the field will know what NBC stands for and can find the long name. To others, the long name immediately tells them what the thing does, as opposed to the mysterious abbreviation.

I think clarity should come before brevity.
