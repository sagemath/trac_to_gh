Broken circuits and no broken circuit (NBC) sets are important aspects of matroid theory. In particular, a basis for the Orlik-Solomon algebra can be given by NBC sets. This implements a basic iterator for broken circuits and NBC sets.

I'm sorry, I didn't look at this ticket before. You add TWO methods to Matroid that do the same thing:

Matroid.no_broken_circuit_sets

and

Matroid.nbc_sets.

This is needlessly cluttering up the list of methods a user sees through autocomplete. Please keep one of the two (preferably the long one, as it is more descriptive)
