I'm sorry, I didn't look at this ticket before. You add TWO methods to Matroid that do the same thing:

Matroid.no_broken_circuit_sets

and

Matroid.nbc_sets.

This is needlessly cluttering up the list of methods a user sees through autocomplete. Please keep one of the two (preferably the long one, as it is more descriptive)

I disagree. People in the field will know what NBC stands for and can find the long name. To others, the long name immediately tells them what the thing does, as opposed to the mysterious abbreviation.

I think clarity should come before brevity.

Shall we see what Federic thinks and just go with that?",

I think the short name, being a very common abbreviation, with the documentation is sufficient. Although I still would argue that having both methods gives the option to the user; plus it's not like matroids are current overflowing with methods (as opposed to `Graphs` with nearly 300). Shall we see what Federic thinks and just go with that?

I would vote for keeping only the long name. The "very common abreviation" NBC is not so universally well-known. But this seems to me to be a very minor point.
