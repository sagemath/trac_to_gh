As reported on #17361, the call to `transitive_reduction` represents a non-negligible part of Poset creation.

This branch re-implements it for acyclic graphs.

```
sage: g = posets.BooleanLattice(5).hasse_diagram().transitive_closure(); g = g.cartesian_product(g)
sage: %timeit g.transitive_reduction()
1 loops, best of 3: 1.02 s per loop
sage: %timeit g.transitive_reduction(acyclic=True)
10 loops, best of 3: 28.9 ms per loop
```

Now the critical part in the creation of a `Poset` is triggered by `UniqueRepresentation`. As soon as you create a `Poset` it is being compared with those that already exists... That is actually pre-computing the equality relationships between all existing posets even if you never asked for it, and I personally see it as wasted time (especially since I cannot disable it).

What happens with key= -parameter? If you put a different one in every poset, I think it should not try to compare to posets with different key.

Objects produced in an inner loop should not be `UniqueRepresentation`. Parent are *designed* to be heavy objects. You should be creating them at least one or two orders less frequently than your most frequently created objects (unless your computations aren't bound by creation of objects). If you're finding that you're creating posets frequently, then you should make a "lightweight" version of poset that's not carrying around all the parent baggage.

If you're finding that those "lightweight" posets need to be turned into full-fledged parents every now and again, then consider making it possible to create a full-scale poset from a lightweight one.

Maybe we already have this: it is called Hasse diagram?

Well, Jori wants to implement a way to enumerate all posets of a given size, so in this case we will have to pay a high tribute to parents. But how do you think that it should be implemented ? Jori is right that Hasse Diagrams have a lot of features already, but that is only... Well, a Hasse Diagram. No comparisons of elements, none of the products defined in the posets directly, well.

What we would need as you say is a class exactly like Poset without the parent infrastructure, but how could we implement that with the smallest amount of copy/paste ?

It would require some thought and some major refactoring. The natural structure to me would seem to have a base class that does not inherit from UniqueRepresentation that implements all the basic stuff and then (hopefully) use multiple inheritance to equip this with the requisite parent stuff for the "full Parent POSet". If there are things that are incompatible between a usable "fast POSet" and a "full parent POSet" then the useful thing should probably inherit separately from the common base class.

The "full parent poset" `__init__` would probably require some trickery to allow instantiation of a full parent from a fast poset (if that's required). Quite possibly, you'd be better off with a UniqueFactory there, so that you have better control over what the construction is keyed under.

For one thing, that use wouldn't require posets to be *parents* then.

[possibly off-topic example]
This happens in number theory too: fractional ideals are Z-submodules of a number field, so they have elements. That would qualify them to be "parents", but nobody in their right mind would implement them like that if you're going to do ideal arithmetic: then they're just represented as matrices or tuples of generating elements. Equality is taken care of by putting generators in normal form, which can be fairly expensive the first time around, but equality testing afterwards is pretty quick.

If you want to make POsets faster you should seriously consider splitting POsets-as-parents and POsets-as-objects. Both usage scenarios you describe seem to fall in the latter scenario, by the way, so perhaps POsets-as-parents aren't really needed beyond checking a box for which parents are available in sage.

Thank you for very good explanation!

Generating all posets of size 7 up to isomorphism takes 18,5 second --- this is not a bottle neck then. But with #14110 the time drops to 2,5 seconds. And when generating just Hasse diagrams instead of posets it took 0,3 second. In the code I was asked to write this is the turning point: now slowest part is doing something with posets, not generating them.

Maybe this is so specialized case that we should let posets to be like they are now. A user might then optimize by directly playing with Hasse diagrams.

This optimization does not mean that you can do things with posets of size `2n` --- it means that that you can use posets of size `n+2`.
