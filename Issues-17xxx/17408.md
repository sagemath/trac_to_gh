As reported on #17361, the call to `transitive_reduction` represents a non-negligible part of Poset creation.

This branch re-implements it for acyclic graphs.

```
sage: g = posets.BooleanLattice(5).hasse_diagram().transitive_closure(); g = g.cartesian_product(g)
sage: %timeit g.transitive_reduction()
1 loops, best of 3: 1.02 s per loop
sage: %timeit g.transitive_reduction(acyclic=True)
10 loops, best of 3: 28.9 ms per loop
```

Now the critical part in the creation of a `Poset` is triggered by `UniqueRepresentation`. As soon as you create a `Poset` it is being compared with those that already exists... That is actually pre-computing the equality relationships between all existing posets even if you never asked for it, and I personally see it as wasted time (especially since I cannot disable it).

What happens with key= -parameter? If you put a different one in every poset, I think it should not try to compare to posets with different key.

Truth is that I do not know. This feature is a class inheritance from `UniqueRepresentation`, so you cannot really "flag" that.

Yep. Complicated. Don't know how to make both work easily `-_-`

Objects produced in an inner loop should not be `UniqueRepresentation`. Parent are *designed* to be heavy objects. You should be creating them at least one or two orders less frequently than your most frequently created objects (unless your computations aren't bound by creation of objects). If you're finding that you're creating posets frequently, then you should make a "lightweight" version of poset that's not carrying around all the parent baggage.

If you're finding that those "lightweight" posets need to be turned into full-fledged parents every now and again, then consider making it possible to create a full-scale poset from a lightweight one.

Maybe we already have this: it is called Hasse diagram?

I mean, can we have a code generating only hasse diagrams and using functions from `hasse_diagram.py`? I have been computing quite many calculations of format "Generate posets of size `n`. Remove those that have property `p`. For remaining compute `f(P)` and then find smallest/biggest value among results."

For one thing, that use wouldn't require posets to be *parents* then.

[possibly off-topic example]
This happens in number theory too: fractional ideals are Z-submodules of a number field, so they have elements.

If you want to make POsets faster you should seriously consider splitting POsets-as-parents and POsets-as-objects.

Thank you for very good explanation!

Generating all posets of size 7 up to isomorphism takes 18,5 second --- this is not a bottle neck then. But with #14110 the time drops to 2,5 seconds. And when generating just Hasse diagrams instead of posets it took 0,3 second. In the code I was asked to write this is the turning point: now slowest part is doing something with posets, not generating them.

Maybe this is so specialized case that we should let posets to be like they are now. A user might then optimize by directly playing with Hasse diagrams.

This optimization does not mean that you can do things with posets of size `2n` --- it means that that you can use posets of size `n+2`.

I removed the "acyclic" flag that nobody would have seen and added an automatic detection of acyclic graphs. This has a small cost, but as I believe that nobody ever calls this function except on acyclic graphs I would say that it is a win (really, nobody would have seen the optional flag).

There was a failing doctest, because undirected graphs do not have a is_directed_acyclic method.

I have also made a few pep8 changes.

Looks good to me. You can set a positive review if you agree with my changes.
