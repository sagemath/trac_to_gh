1.An invalid assignment in Singular is ignored and produces only a warning. This 
shadowed at least a bug in Normal::genus():
http://www.singular.uni-kl.de:8002/trac/ticket/532#comment:5
I suggested that Singular should throw an error in case of an invalid assignment. This suggestion was ignored upstream, so I propose to patch Singular in Sage instead.

2.In some places of the Singular library code polynomial rings are extended by variables with hardcoded names. In case of a name conflict, variables are autorenamed. This may trigger bugs, as shown in  http://www.singular.uni-kl.de:8002/trac/ticket/508
Therefore I suggest to disable autorenaming (1) , throw an error in case of a variable conflict (2) and fix the hardcoded variable names in Singular in a long term.
(1) and (2) was declined upsteam; from my point of view mostly because of hurted egos.
Therefore I propose to patch Singular used in Sage.

3. Check if some other Singular warnings are in fact errors and should be handled that way.
