Perhaps ironically, in #12212 we now have a pretty nice syntax for using colormaps with an arbitrary function (scaled to 1) with parametric and implicit plots, but not "regular" 3d plots!  We just have Harald's (edited by Jason) example

```
sage: var('r v')
sage: cmsel = [colormaps['autumn'](i) for i in sxrange(0,1,0.05)]
sage: p = plot3d(0.2*(r**2 + v**2) + cos(2*r)*sin(2*v),(r,-2,2), (v,-2,2), adaptive=True, color=cmsel, plot_points=10, opacity=0.9)
sage: p2 = sphere((0,0,0),1,color='black',opacity=0.5)
sage: (p+p2).show(aspect_ratio=(1,1,1), figsize=[7,3])
```
which isn't ideal.

We need to document this, or (much better) use the same syntax, and maybe even enable it even when `adaptive=False`.
