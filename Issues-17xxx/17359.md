In #17364, the supercategories of homsets of schemes were fixed: instead of

```
sage: Schemes().Homsets().all_super_categories()
[Category of homsets of schemes, Category of objects]
```
we now have

```
sage: Schemes().Homsets().all_super_categories()
[Category of homsets of schemes,
 Category of homsets,
 Category of sets,
 Category of sets with partial maps,
 Category of objects]
```
There are two TODO items left from #17364, namely to determine the correct categories for homsets of schemes and of Hecke modules.  The purpose of this ticket is to resolve these TODOs as follows:
- Hom sets of schemes are unchanged (do not have any extra structure)
- Hom sets of Hecke modules over a ring *A* are now in the category of *A*-modules.  (Note that `HeckeModules(A)` requires *A* to be commutative, while Hecke algebras are not always commutative.  Hence Hom sets are modules over *A* but not in general over the Hecke algebra.)

Indeed a bug, as we make in sage.categories.homsets.Homsets.super_categories the assumption that Sage manipulates only "small categories" whose homsets are therefore sets.

I have tracked down the issue, and am now creating a ticket.

Now I am puzzled. In EACH category, the morphisms between two fixed objects forms a set. "Small" category means that the class of objects of the category is a set.

Is it not what this ticket is about?

Sorry, I meant «locally small»

> Is it not what this ticket is about?


Yeah, maybe: The description seemed too narrow to me, kind of the
symptom rather than the cause. But probably this ticket can be closed
once #17364 is done.
