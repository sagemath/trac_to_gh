Nicolas,

I documented two `Poset` functions in #17051 which have a `facade` boolean argument (the same that `Poset()` has) and added a link toward the `Facade` module. The problem is that there is no documentation there to find, and it would help if you could write something to say to the new users what they need to know about `Facade` in such situations.

This page is also the page that appears first when you type "sage facade" in google.

Thanks.

Nathann

Good point: the introductory documentation is located in a natural spot to find it by introspection; but it's hard to guess this spot if you look for it from the reference manual. I added a crosslink; does this do the job?

Thanks for pointing this out.

Hello Nicolas,

I was thinking of users who do not know what a facade/category is and find this keyword in a constructor like !Posets. The documentation of the category is not something that will answer their questions: could you write a couple of lines somewhere meant for users who just want to find out if they need to change that flag or not ?

Something like: here are two sets, one is a Facade and the other is not: notice how the type of their elements has changed, and here is how to get the original value of an element from its wrapped counterpart ?

I understand everything until the end. There is an example with `P(2) < P(3)`. However, this is just the part where difference between facade and non-facade sets could be shown. For example we define poset where 2<1:

```
P=Poset({2:[1]}, facade=False)
Q=Poset({2:[1]}, facade=True)
print 2 < 1
print P(2) < P(1)
print Q(2) < Q(1)
# Maybe also P.unwrap(P(2)) < P.unwrap(P(1)) here?
```

It is unnecessary to know that MuPAD was first system with facade sets.

Authors-field should be filled.

That's good news :-)

> There is an example with `P(2) < P(3)`. However, this is just the part where difference between facade and non-facade sets could be shown.


Ok, good idea. I just used a slightly different example,
mathematically natural, and that is in line with the previous one.

> ```
> # Maybe also P.unwrap(P(2)) < P.unwrap(P(1)) here?
> ```


I left that out: this would certainly make sense in a specific
documentation about facade posets, but not here: so far only posets
follow that convention.

> It is unnecessary to know that MuPAD was first system with facade sets.


On the contrary, when we reuse concepts introduced by other systems,
we should give appropriate credit!

> Authors-field should be filled.


Done!

Thanks for the review,
                                    Nicolas

Here it's about who invented the cheese recipe! Sage is to follow the
scientific tradition of giving credit when reusing others ideas, even

immediately care.
