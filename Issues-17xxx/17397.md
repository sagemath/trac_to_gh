If one doesn't yet have a Sage gcc built on reasonably modern OS X, we use `clang` to build it, and then `gcc` is used in upgrades.  However, the gcc-4.9.x introduced in Sage 6.4.rc0 (in an rc? really?) has some code that at one point compiled okay with clang, but now requires `clang++` because [cpp idioms are now being used](http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.gcc.bugs/413564).

Thanks for looking at this.  Once gcc finishes building successfully (very slow since I set it to `make -j1` in case the log proved useful) I'll probably start a new tarball and make from scratch to verify.
