Hi,

In [a question on ask.sagemath.org](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/24504/a-bug-in-computing-minimum-distance-coding-theory/) was presented the following problem

```
sage: K = GF(4,"a")
sage: a = K.gen()
sage: G = Matrix([[a, a + 1, 1, a + 1, 1, 0, 0],
....:             [0, a, a + 1, 1, a + 1, 1, 0],
....:             [0, 0, a, a + 1, 1, a + 1, 1],
....:             [a + 1, 0, 1, 0, a + 1, 1, a + 1],
....:             [a, a + 1, a + 1, 0, 0, a + 1, 1],
....:             [a + 1, a, a, 1, 0, 0, a + 1],
....:             [a, a + 1, 1, a + 1, 1, 0, 0]])
sage: C = LinearCode(G)
sage: C.minimum_distance()
5
```
whereas the code has distance 3. The problem is that the input matrix does not has full rank... but this is never tested!

Wow. Thank you for fixing that and cleaning the code a bit, it was really ugly. It took me a long time only to understand what it did, and I had your commit to help me `O_o`

I do not get why that code would return a `d` equal to zero, however... What is the meaning of that ?

It is not really a problem for the review, that's what the code deals with already... But I would be glad to understand.

I would also be glad to understand why the GAP function is so complicated and takes this 'i' as a parameter, but well `O_o`
