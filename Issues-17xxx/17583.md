`_sparse_dot_product()` (which you didn't touch) appears not to be used anywhere and could probably be deleted.

By the way, is there a reason to special-case the vectors of length zero in `FreeModuleElement.dot_product()`?

Otherwise lgtm.

Replying to [@mezzarobba](#comment%3A5):
> By the way, is there a reason to special-case the vectors of length zero in `FreeModuleElement.dot_product()`?

Yes, to apply the following optimization: instead of starting with zero and `a[i]*b[i]`, we start with `a[0] * b[0]` and add `a[i]*b[i]` for `i >= 1`.

I'm actually preparing a commit which refactors dot products, since the logic was a bit strange. With the new commit (still testing), there will be a `cpdef` method `_dot_product_` for equal parents and `_dot_product_coerce_` for parents which might be different.

Fine. (I was not sure that it would be faster...)

Regarding your last commit, I agree with the changes, but I don't understand why `dot_product` is defined in `FreeModuleElement` rather than in `Vector`. Actually I don't understand the point of the distinction between `Vector` and `FreeModuleElement` at all.

Also, I think we can do two additional simplifications related to `dot_product`:

It's always going to be somewhat faster and it avoids extra work in case the parents are not equal.

I could easily move it...

Currently in Sage, the only `Vector`s are also `FreeModuleElement`s. But one could envision a parent which is not a *free* module...
