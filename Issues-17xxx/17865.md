In the file `sage/structure/coerce.pyx` there is an homemade coercion for python numeric objects (i.e. `bool -> int -> long -> float -> complex`). Instead we should use the ready made python function `coerce`. Or even use the [PyNumber_Coerce](https://docs.python.org/2/c-api/number.html#c.PyNumber_Coerce) function from the C API.

The new solution looks twice faster from Python

Old timings:

```
sage: cm = sage.structure.element.get_coercion_model()
sage: %timeit cm.canonical_coercion(1r,2.r)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 520 ns per loop
sage: %timeit cm.canonical_coercion(1r,complex(1r,1r))
1000000 loops, best of 3: 812 ns per loop
```

New timings

```
sage: cm = sage.structure.element.get_coercion_model()
sage: %timeit cm.canonical_coercion(1r,2.r)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 234 ns per loop
sage: %timeit cm.canonical_coercion(1r,complex(1r,1r))
1000000 loops, best of 3: 469 ns per loop
```
