In the file `sage/structure/coerce.pyx` there is an homemade coercion for python numeric objects (i.e. `bool -> int -> long -> float -> complex`). Instead we should use the ready made python function `coerce`. Or even use the [PyNumber_Coerce](https://docs.python.org/2/c-api/number.html#c.PyNumber_Coerce) function from the C API.
