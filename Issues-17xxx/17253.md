Easy:

```
sage: print designs.orthogonal_arrays.explain_construction(9,834)
TypeError: brouwer_van_rees_with_one_truncated_column() got an unexpected keyword argument 'explain_construction'
```

That can be solved by removing the build function `brouwer_van_rees_with_one_truncated_column` that we do not need anymore, and calling `wilson_construction` directly. The branch also fixes a bug in `wilson_construction` when `OA=None`, i.e. only the non-Brouwer case was handled.
