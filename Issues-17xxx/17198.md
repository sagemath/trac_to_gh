```
Python's `min` and `max` are not suitable for `RealIntervalFieldElement`, as those are not linearly ordered; the existing methods `RealIntervalFieldElement.min` and `RealIntervalFieldElement.max`
only compute the minimum or maximum of `self` and `other`.

This ticket rewrites the methods `RealIntervalFieldElement.min` and `RealIntervalFieldElement.max` to accept an arbitrary number of arguments.
