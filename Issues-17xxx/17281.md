That line should not have been added in #16996.

```
  -notebook-ipy [...] -- start the Sage IPython notebook
```

That command does not work:

```
$ sage -notebook-ipy
CRITICAL:root:unknown notebook: otebook-ipy
Error, notebook must be one of default, ipython, sagenb but got otebook-ipy
```

It was decided in #16996 to use the syntax `sage --notebook=ipython` instead and we forgot to remove that line.
