http://sagemath.org/doc/ is a little large.   Or maybe not large enough?  Anyway, it needs a little better organization.

The worst example of this is that the Bordeaux lectures and numerical tutorial are not under the thematic tutorials.  (The constructions document is mostly very old, as we know, but that is a separate issue.)  But it would also be worth considering whether this visual format is best - a clickable list at the top would be preferable to having to scroll and read these huge things.

For instance, one thing that could be done is just to reorganize it to look a lot more like http://sagemath.org/doc/developer/index.html (though much shorter!) so that it's easier to see which thematic tutorials there are, etc.  

One thing to be aware of is to organize it in such a way that existing links are not broken; it should only reorganize the links or perhaps omit some, but we don't have to actually reorganize the structure of doc/en.

Finally, this would be a very good place to *finally* include the non-English documentation in this page!
