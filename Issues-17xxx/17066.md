See https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!topic/sage-devel/8z2HyH5Y8Dc with Fredrik's assessment:

"For Sage, fixing the problem is actually trivial: when the hypergeometric function is a polynomial (and at least when the inputs are exact), don't call mpmath; just evaluate the polynomial directly and then call .n() on the result."


Keywords: **special, functions, pFq, evaluation**

Replying to [@kcrisman](#comment%3A6):
> This is related to the following [ask.sagemath question](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/24677/a-simple-hypergeometric-function-fails/) as well.

Indeed. While what you're saying there about decidability is certainly right, we can bit off a good chunk using known closed forms. I have now fixed a bug in `closed_form()` and it looks like using that Sage function (provided by Fredrik with the hypergeometric code) instead of Maxima is not only faster but gives also better results:

```
sage: hypergeometric([3/2],[1/2,-1/2],5)        # using closed_form()
-2*sqrt(5)*sinh(2*sqrt(5)) - 19*cosh(2*sqrt(5))
sage: from sage.interfaces.maxima_lib import maxima_lib, max_to_sr
sage: max_to_sr(maxima_lib.hgfred([3/2],[1/2,-1/2],5).ecl())
-4*(5*5^(1/4))*sqrt(1/5)*sqrt(pi)*sqrt(sqrt(5)/pi)*cosh(2*sqrt(5)) - 2*5^(3/4)*sqrt(pi)*bessel_I(-3/2, 2*sqrt(5))
```
The latter, while numerically correct, is difficult to simplify further.

There are several doctests failing where I need to decide how to fix or rewrite them.

B) do not simplify; just fix the evaluation problem
C) rely on the user to supply needed precision; add warning

If (as you seem to say in your post to `sage-devel`) the result of the ticket is that

```
sage: hypergeometric([1,-100],[3],x)
```
returns a polynomial while

```
sage: hypergeometric([1,-100],[3],0.7)
```
still calls a numerically stable evaluation algorithm, then I don't think there is a problem. (Ideally, ` hypergeometric([1,-100],[3],x,hold=True).subs(x=0.7)` should also call the numerically stable evaluation algorithm, though.)

What I was concerned about was that the implementation of `n()` for an "atomic-looking" expression with dedicated numerical evaluation code would end up using a numerically unstable formula *internally* without adapting the precision or warning the user. I'm not saying such a behaviour is an absolute no-go, but I do think it is something we should avoid when possible.

Just so I follow, what you are saying is that the polynomial (rational function, I guess) given will be *correct*, but that substituting floating point numbers are likely to be inaccurate unless carried out to a very high degree of precision?  I'm torn here because on the one hand, presumably that could happen with *any* rational function, there are standard examples given in a lot of calculus books, but on the other hand we "expect" hg to return a hg function and not a polynomial.

> The real fix for this cannot be provided by hypergeometric though but must be done in subs, if at all.

Well, it could provide a good reason *not* to "always simplify hypergeometric when it's a polynomial"...  I didn't realize that people meant rational function when they said polynomial.  Is it possible to really only simplify when it's a true polynomial, or is that a very unlikely event?

No, it is really a polynomial—but one of degree 100, with large coefficients that alternate in sign.

Precisely. (Well, not necessarily a *very* high precision, but probably something like 80-100 guard bits in my example.)

Oh, I misread some of the output in the example I tested - hard to see where the dividing signs go :-)  So it's the alternation that is the cancellation problem, got it.
