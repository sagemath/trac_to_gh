The following resultant computation used to lead to an infinite recursion before #17974 (merged in 6.7.beta0):

```
sage: A.<a,c> = Frac(PolynomialRing(QQ,'a,c'))
sage: B.<d,e> = PolynomialRing(A,'d,e')
sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(B,'x')
sage: (a*d*x^2+a+e+1).resultant(-4*c^2*x+1)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
RuntimeError: maximum recursion depth exceeded while calling a Python object
```
Although this particular bug is now fixed, the doctest and the shortcut added by this ticket may still be useful.

Keywords: infinite recursion polynomial resultant
