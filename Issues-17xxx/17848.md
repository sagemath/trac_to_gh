I do not think that it is used anywhere. Just a forgotten piece of code.

Actually, it may be cool to see the graph of module imports. Would be interesting to see which guys are never called by anybody else. I don't know how to build it, though `:-P`

You can just parse the import in each files. You only have to care about relative vs absolute import. That would be really cool!
