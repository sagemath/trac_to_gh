```
It is too easy to construct Dirichlet characters with inconsistent values:

```
sage: k.<i> = CyclotomicField(4)
sage: G = DirichletGroup(192)
sage: chi = G([i,-1,-1]); chi  # should raise an error since 127 only has order 2
Dirichlet character modulo 192 of conductor 48 mapping 127 |--> zeta16^4, 133 |--> -1, 65 |--> -1
sage: chi(133)  # no surprise that this gives an inconsistent answer
1
```
The `check` option (`True` by default) should verify that the images of the generators have the correct orders.

Depends on #17317

Keywords: **dirichlet character**

 ```
 sage: k.<i> = CyclotomicField(4)
 sage: G = DirichletGroup(192)
-sage: chi = G([i,-1,-1]); chi
+sage: chi = G([i,-1,-1]); chi  # should raise an error since 127 only has order 2
 Dirichlet character modulo 192 of conductor 48 mapping 127 |--> zeta16^4, 133 |--> -1, 65 |--> -1
-sage: chi(133)
+sage: chi(133)  # no surprise that this gives an inconsistent answer
 1
 ```
-Because of this, changing the coefficient field of `chi` is broken as well:
-
-```
-sage: G0 = DirichletGroup(192, k)
-sage: chi0 = G0(chi); chi0
-Dirichlet character modulo 192 of conductor 24 mapping 127 |--> i, 133 |--> 1, 65 |--> -1
-```
-
-This probably explains the following bug where two ways of computing the dimension of a space of modular symbols do not give the same result:
-
-```
-sage: M = ModularSymbols(chi);
-sage: M.cuspidal_submodule()
-AssertionError: According to dimension formulas the cuspidal subspace of "Modular Symbols space of dimension 0 and level 192, weight 2, character [zeta4, 1, -1], sign 0, over Cyclotomic Field of order 4 and degree 2" has dimension 40; however, computing it using modular symbols we obtained 0, so there is a bug (please report!).
-```
-
-
+The `check` option (`True` by default) should verify that the images of the generators have the correct orders.

Just a little remark, we could fail faster in case the list of images does not have the right length (in case the orders are not automatically precomputed when Z/nZ is created, I don't remember).
And that does not really matters anyway as feeding it with wrong length of images is just asking for trouble.

The unit group of Z/nZ is computed (generators and orders) when the Dirichlet group is constructed.
> And that does not really matters anyway as feeding it with wrong length of images is just asking for trouble.

Indeed, it is better to optimise for the case where the input is valid.
