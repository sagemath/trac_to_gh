It is too easy to construct Dirichlet characters with inconsistent values:

```
sage: k.<i> = CyclotomicField(4)
sage: G = DirichletGroup(192)
sage: chi = G([i,-1,-1]); chi  # should raise an error since 127 only has order 2
Dirichlet character modulo 192 of conductor 48 mapping 127 |--> zeta16^4, 133 |--> -1, 65 |--> -1
sage: chi(133)  # no surprise that this gives an inconsistent answer
1
```
The `check` option (`True` by default) should verify that the images of the generators have the correct orders.

Depends on #17317

Just a little remark, we could fail faster in case the list of images does not have the right length (in case the orders are not automatically precomputed when Z/nZ is created, I don't remember).
And that does not really matters anyway as feeding it with wrong length of images is just asking for trouble.

Could you add a little more about the necessary orders either in the INPUT section or in the TESTS one (that is say more than the orders are not admissible).

The unit group of Z/nZ is computed (generators and orders) when the Dirichlet group is constructed.

Indeed, it is better to optimise for the case where the input is valid.
