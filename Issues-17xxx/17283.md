It is too easy to construct Dirichlet characters with inconsistent values:

```
sage: k.<i> = CyclotomicField(4)
sage: G = DirichletGroup(192)
sage: chi = G([i,-1,-1]); chi  # should raise an error since 127 only has order 2
Dirichlet character modulo 192 of conductor 48 mapping 127 |--> zeta16^4, 133 |--> -1, 65 |--> -1
sage: chi(133)  # no surprise that this gives an inconsistent answer
1
```
The `check` option (`True` by default) should verify that the images of the generators have the correct orders.

Just a little remark, we could fail faster in case the list of images does not have the right length (in case the orders are not automatically precomputed when Z/nZ is created, I don't remember).
And that does not really matters anyway as feeding it with wrong length of images is just asking for trouble.

Could you add a little more about the necessary orders either in the INPUT section or in the TESTS one (that is say more than the orders are not admissible).

The current error string formulation also kind of make it feel like the orders must be exactly the one stated.

The unit group of Z/nZ is computed (generators and orders) when the Dirichlet group is constructed.
> And that does not really matters anyway as feeding it with wrong length of images is just asking for trouble.

Indeed, it is better to optimise for the case where the input is valid.
