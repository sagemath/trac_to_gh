Even if it is expectable that in some cases solve() may not return all solutions, it should be explicitly pointed out; especially it should be stated that an empty list does not necessarily imply there are no solutions.

See also the discussion at  https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-support/cg7QYw_1ncg/VKdH3CX4qYsJ 

Example from that thread:

```
solve(5^( x -1) == (1/25)^(2*x), x)
# []
solve(5^( x -1) == (1/25)^(2*x), x,to_poly_solve=True)
#[x == (2*I*pi*z41 + log(5))/log(3125)]
```

What is about

```
 solve_mod()
 solve_ineq_univar()
 solve_ineq_fourier()
 solve_ineq()
```
may they also fail in some cases to return all solutions?
Which other routines need an explicit statement, that an empty result does not imply
that there are no solutions?

I think you should also give an explicit example in the doc. However, the one you provide does not work for me (on 6.5.beta0):

```
sage: solve(5^( x -1) == (1/25)^(2*x), x)
...
NotImplementedError: non-integral exponents not supported
```

Returns empty list on 6.5beta1. Is `x` already initialized?

Uh my bad, i was using the wrong sage console where i used polynomials before. Sorry for the noise.

That said, adding an example showing explicitly the problem (e.g. that particular example, since it works) could be good to make things explicit. The existing example are somehow too optimistic, and we should point what does not work as well.
