The different behaviour between the two rings consists of
1. the `coefficients(sparse=True)` (which is default) method returns a list of pairs in `SR`, and a list in `PolynomialRing`,
2. `Expression.dict()` does not exist.
Example:

```
y = 3*x^3 + 2*x^2 - 4*x
print(y)
type(y)
```
Gives:

```
3*x^3 + 2*x^2 - 4*x
<type 'sage.symbolic.expression.Expression'>
```
And

```
M = matrix(SR,[[1,2],[0,-2]])
ch = M.charpoly()
print(ch)
type(ch)
```
gives

```
x^2 + x - 2
<class 'sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_element_generic.Polynomial_generic_dense_field'>
```
But:

```
y.coeffs()
```
returns

```
[[−4,1],[2,2],[3,3]]
```
and

```
ch.coeffs()
```
returns

```
[−2,1,1]
```

I'd prefer if these two functions returned the same format, preferably the Expression format, as having access to the index allows list comprehension tastiness.

That would not be difficult (in comparison). If you expect it then to behave identically you will be disappointed however, because symbolics have no default generator (although `Expression.coefficients()` has the lexically first occuring var hard-wired when no varname is given).

```
sage: var('a,b,c')
(a, b, c)
sage: (a+2*a^2+3*b).list()
[3*b, 1, 2]
sage: (3*b+a+2*a^2).list()
[3*b, 1, 2]
sage: (3*b+c+2*c^2).list()
[2*c^2 + c, 3]
```
so you could never have true polymorphism.
