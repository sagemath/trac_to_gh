```
The different behaviour between the two rings consists of
1. the `coefficients(sparse=True)` (which is default) method returns a list of pairs in `SR`, and a list in `PolynomialRing`,
2. `Expression.dict()` does not exist.
Example:

```
y = 3*x^3 + 2*x^2 - 4*x
print(y)
type(y)
```
Gives:

```
3*x^3 + 2*x^2 - 4*x
<type 'sage.symbolic.expression.Expression'>
```
And

```
M = matrix(SR,[[1,2],[0,-2]])
ch = M.charpoly()
print(ch)
type(ch)
```
gives

```
x^2 + x - 2
<class 'sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_element_generic.Polynomial_generic_dense_field'>
```
But:

```
y.coeffs()
```
returns

```
[[−4,1],[2,2],[3,3]]
```
and

```
ch.coeffs()
```
returns

```
[−2,1,1]
```

I'd prefer if these two functions returned the same format, preferably the Expression format, as having access to the index allows list comprehension tastiness.

Have list comprehension tastiness with `dict`:

```
sage: ch.dict().values()
[-2, 1, 1]
```
In #17518 we started being more consistent by deprecating `coeffs`.

That would not be difficult (in comparison). If you expect it then to behave identically you will be disappointed however, because symbolics have no default generator (although `Expression.coefficients()` has the lexically first occuring var hard-wired when no varname is given).

```
sage: var('a,b,c')
(a, b, c)
sage: (a+2*a^2+3*b).list()
[3*b, 1, 2]
sage: (3*b+a+2*a^2).list()
[3*b, 1, 2]
sage: (3*b+c+2*c^2).list()
[2*c^2 + c, 3]
```
so you could never have true polymorphism.
