Some comments:
* Instead of `mkdtemp()`, you can use `tmp_dir()` from `sage.misc.temporary_file`. That gets cleaned automatically.

* Instead of `TIDES_RND`, I would use an explicit `MPFR_RNDN` instead in the `mpfr_set_str()` calls.

* Remove the unused imports of `SAGE_ROOT`, `os`, `shutil` and `N`.

* Do you really need `RR(SR(foo))`, isn't `RR(foo)` sufficient?

* Tides uses

```
int binary_precision(int prec) {
    return ceil(prec * 3.3219);
}
```
to convert from decimal to binary precision, perhaps you should use the same formula?

* You should use the `.str(truncate=False)` method to convert a `RealNumber` to a string, because by default Sage prints reals with less digits. Compare

```
sage: RR(pi).str(truncate=False)
'3.1415926535897931'
sage: RR(pi).str()
'3.14159265358979'
```

* Then something unrelated to this ticket: `exp()` in an expression currently doesn't work.

* Finally, fill in your real name as author on this ticket.

`RR(SR(foo))` is used because strings like `"pi"` or `"-3/2"` are not accepted by the element constructor of real fields. They are accepted by the element constructor of SR though. So it was the best way i could find to create a RealField element from these strings.

The real value of log(10)/log(2) is between 3.3219 and 3.322, so i prefeared to be conservative in this aspect. 

This commit addresses mostly all your comments, but i think that the code could be greatly improved if we pass the domain to fast_callable, which would directly convert all constants, avoiding us the work of converting the exact expressions to the strings that represent them in floating point.

Besides, there is also some room for improvement in the performance of `remove_repeated` .

I will work on that, but i am not sure if it should be done in this ticket (maybe we should change the title?)

Replying to [@miguelmarco](#comment%3A6):
> `RR(SR(foo))` is used because strings like `"pi"` or `"-3/2"` are not accepted by the element constructor of real fields.

I would say that's a good thing! Why *should* strings like that be accepted as input? I think it's reasonable to accept the elements `pi` (element of `SR`) and `3/2` (element of `QQ`) but not the strings `"pi"` or `"-3/2"`.

> The real value of log(10)/log(2) is between 3.3219 and 3.322, so i prefeared to be conservative in this aspect.

If your precision doesn't agree with `TIDES_PREC`, the result might actually be *less precise*: mpfr guarantees that the string representation (with `truncate=False` in Sage) is such that the exact same real number will be created by `mpfr_set_str(string, MPFR_RNDN)` *provided that the precision is the same*.

I understand that you prefer to round `log(10)/log(2)` up, but then `TIDES_PREC` should agree with this:

```
prec = ceil(dig * 3.322)
RR = RealField(prec)
...
outfile.write('\tTIDES_PREC = {};'.format(prec))   # instead of set_precision_digits()
```

> This commit addresses mostly all your comments, but i think that the code could be greatly improved if we pass the domain to fast_callable, which would directly convert all constants, avoiding us the work of converting the exact expressions to the strings that represent them in floating point.

I have no experience with `fast_callable`, so I cannot judge.
