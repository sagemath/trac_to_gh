See [this SO question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26566823/sage-python-bug-in-looped-graph-degree-computation).

```
q=graphs.CompleteGraph(2)
q.allow_loops(True)
q.allow_multiple_edges(True)
q.add_edge([1,1])
a=q.copy(immutable=True)
b=q.copy(immutable=False)

sage: a==b
True
sage: a.degree()
[1, 2]
sage: b.degree()
[1, 3]
```

Basically, the problem is that the usual backend has a case for this

```
    if self._loops and self.has_edge(v, v, None):
        if self._multiple_edges:
            d += len(self.get_edge_label(v, v))
        else:
            d += 1
```
but the "static" one doesn't.

HMmmmmm... Well, the thing is that it depends on what you want the degree to be. If you want the degree of a vertex to be equal to the number of edges incident to it, then it is correct.

If you want the number of edges to be twice the sum of degrees, then it is wrong.

Yesyes I understand. Well, I was rather happy to find a way to fix that without changing the internal data structure. I really did not want to add an "if" there, in a function that was just a substraction `:-)`

The only difference will be at Python level, so it does not matter much.

Hello !

You should not worry too much about that. Performance is wasted in other places, so this probably will not become a problem anytime soon.

The additional caching is only an array of ints of size n (no Python involved, just real integers). You waste MUCH more ressources if your graph carries a layout for its vertices, for instance ! `:-)`

Besides, it is indeed good that static graphs are MUCH lighter in memory than Sage's usual graphs, but it is not why they were implemented: the low-level data structure was implemented mostly for speed, because at this level you can work on the graph directly without calling any function, everything is as fast as it should be.

The "main" problem though, is that immutable graphs are immutable, and consequently you can only build an immutable graph from a mutable graph (and the mutable graph is MUCH heavier in memory).

See [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_(graph_theory)) and [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(graph_theory)#cite_note-1), which *claim* that this is a standard convention.  I don't recall ever hearing a different convention for loops either, and for directed situations we should still be correct, right?   Let me know if I'm missing a controversy on this - sometimes there are mutually incompatible definitions, most notoriously in my own classes for $\mathbb{N}$.

Hello !

I assume that what this patch implements is the convention, as it is also what is contained in Wikipedia and books. I just hate conventions that cost running time and make dirty code.

Also, I am old enough to understand that people make the conventions that are the easiest for them, so I don't like to pay the price of other person's conventions.

But well, this one was cheap in terms of running time, so let's not complain `:-P`

Should

```
+        cdef int i, tmp
```
be

```
+        cdef int i, j, tmp
```
or is that not helpful?

Otherwise this seems good and behaves correctly.

However, I found #17340 while reviewing this... sigh.
