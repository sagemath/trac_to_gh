See [this SO question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26566823/sage-python-bug-in-looped-graph-degree-computation).

```
q=graphs.CompleteGraph(2)
q.allow_loops(True)
q.allow_multiple_edges(True)
q.add_edge([1,1])
a=q.copy(immutable=True)
b=q.copy(immutable=False)

sage: a==b
True
sage: a.degree()
[1, 2]
sage: b.degree()
[1, 3]
```

Basically, the problem is that the usual backend has a case for this

```
    if self._loops and self.has_edge(v, v, None):
        if self._multiple_edges:
            d += len(self.get_edge_label(v, v))
        else:
            d += 1
```
but the "static" one doesn't.

If you want the number of edges to be twice the sum of degrees, then it is wrong.

Yesyes I understand. Well, I was rather happy to find a way to fix that without changing the internal data structure. I really did not want to add an "if" there, in a function that was just a substraction `:-)`

The only difference will be at Python level, so it does not matter much.

Hmm, I see what you mean though, keeping track of all this extra data could be expensive when people are searching through really large sets of relatively large graphs (which is when this was implemented in the first place).  I wonder if that will impact efficiency or speed.

Hello !

> Hmm, I see what you mean though, keeping track of all this extra data could be expensive when people are searching through really large sets of relatively large graphs (which is when this was implemented in the first place).  I wonder if that will impact efficiency or speed.

You should not worry too much about that. Performance is wasted in other places, so this probably will not become a problem anytime soon.

The additional caching is only an array of ints of size n (no Python involved, just real integers). You waste MUCH more ressources if your graph carries a layout for its vertices, for instance ! `:-)`

Besides, it is indeed good that static graphs are MUCH lighter in memory than Sage's usual graphs, but it is not why they were implemented: the low-level data structure was implemented mostly for speed, because at this level you can work on the graph directly without calling any function, everything is as fast as it should be. They were later turned into an immutable Python object because the algebraists wanted graphs as dictionary keys.

The "main" problem though, is that immutable graphs are immutable, and consequently you can only build an immutable graph from a mutable graph (and the mutable graph is MUCH heavier in memory).

This, to say that this caching is not really a problem. What I wanted to avoid was to add a useless "if" in the 'degree' function of the low-level data structure. Fortunately, there is no such function for those graphs are implemented to actually be ... digraphs ! And there we only have an `out_degree` method, which is perfectly defined and only returns a difference of pointers. In particular, no ugly 'if' there `:-P`

See [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_(graph_theory)) and [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(graph_theory)#cite_note-1), which *claim* that this is a standard convention.  I don't recall ever hearing a different convention for loops either, and for directed situations we should still be correct, right?   Let me know if I'm missing a controversy on this - sometimes there are mutually incompatible definitions, most notoriously in my own classes for $\mathbb{N}$.

Hello !

I assume that what this patch implements is the convention, as it is also what is contained in Wikipedia and books. I just hate conventions that cost running time and make dirty code.

Also, I am old enough to understand that people make the conventions that are the easiest for them, so I don't like to pay the price of other person's conventions.

But well, this one was cheap in terms of running time, so let's not complain `:-P`

```

or is that not helpful?

Otherwise this seems good and behaves correctly.
