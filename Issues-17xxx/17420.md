A number of reported build errors on sage-devel seem to arise because people are building as root. We should check for this in the `./configure` script and print a clear message, rather than the current situation (letting the build continue for a while and then printing something a bit more cryptic).

Now fails early-on:

```
[root@dhcp-163-1-81-129 git]# ./configure
checking for a BSD-compatible install... /usr/bin/install -c
checking whether build environment is sane... yes
checking for a thread-safe mkdir -p... /usr/bin/mkdir -p
checking for gawk... gawk
checking whether make sets $(MAKE)... yes
checking whether make supports nested variables... yes
checking whether to enable maintainer-specific portions of Makefiles... yes
checking for root user... yes
configure: error: You cannot build Sage as root, switch to a unpriviledged user
```
