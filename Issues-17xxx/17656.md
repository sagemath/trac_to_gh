It has been reported [1] on sage-devel by Nikos Apostolakis that `_check_embedding_validity` was rather lacking in its checks: it did not notice that some vertex appeared twice in a circular ordering.

With this branch, more meaningful exceptions are raised when something goes wrong, and in particular his example of code now stops at this moment:

```
sage: k12.set_embedding(imb)
...
ValueError: The list associated with vertex A contains >1 occurrences of: [C]
```
