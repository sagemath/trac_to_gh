Infinity ring is commutative and non-zero.

Because there is no `is_zero` and `is_commutative` method for `InfinityRing`, numerous methods fails for matrices with infinity elements. This problem came up in relation with the ticket #17798.

```
sage: m = Matrix([Infinity])
sage: m.nrows()
1
sage: m.rows()

Hello!
I am not sure to understand your question. Are you looking for actual examples in sage of code using matrix for infinity elements ?

The depth of the problem of the mission statement is that the base ring of `InfinityRing` is itself. The methods rows is looking if self has the attribute is_commutative, and if not suppose that self.base_ring has it.

But matrices over the infinity ring will not allow you to mix infinite entries with integers or whatever else. While

```
sage: Matrix([[SR(Infinity), 1],[2,3]])
[+Infinity         1]
[        2         3]
```
works fine.

This ticket deals exclusively with `MatrixSpace` over `InfinityRing`, and in this case, it is `InfinityRing` that needs to become a new-style `Parent` class to fix this ticket and perhaps is the better fix IMO for `is_zero` (along with the implementation of `is_commutative`).

In parallel to this, `MatrixSpace` should become a `Parent`, and since it walks like one, it shouldn't be too hard to convert it over.

For matrices with infinities, we want to construct a Coxeter matrix without the current hack of representing `oo` with `-1` (in `CoxeterMatrixGroup`), nor do we want to use the `SymbolicRing` as we feel it is way too heavy-handed of a solution. I guess fundamentally we want a 2D array since we don't need the ground set to be a ring (it'd be `NN[oo]`), but the matrix class(es) in Sage have nice displays...

So then I guess you need something like an "Alexandroff extension functor" that you could apply to a Parent to adjoin it an element at infinity, don't you?

If that means given an ordered set `S`, we can add an element `oo` such that `x < oo` for all in `S`, then yes.

Well, the reference to Alexandroff extensions is not appropriate then, but the idea would be the same.

In any case, let me ask again: is the following really what you want?

```
sage: matrix([[Infinity], [1]])
[               +Infinity]
[A positive finite number]

Coming back to the description of the ticket, does it make sense for Infinityring to have the two methods

is_zero() and is_commutative()?

IMHO, the answer is yes and the patch fixes this. This is the problem raised in the ticket. Otherwise, the description should be changed to be more precise.

Hi Aladin,

Could you please do the following

-add your full name as an Author,
-make the title of the ticket reflect the addition of the two methods.

This ticket is not about matrix with Infinity, but rather about the fact that we need two methods on the infinity ring.
