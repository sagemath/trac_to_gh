```

The new solution looks twice faster from Python

Old timings:

```
sage: cm = sage.structure.element.get_coercion_model()
sage: %timeit cm.canonical_coercion(1r,2.r)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 520 ns per loop
sage: %timeit cm.canonical_coercion(1r,complex(1r,1r))
1000000 loops, best of 3: 812 ns per loop
```

New timings

```
sage: cm = sage.structure.element.get_coercion_model()
sage: %timeit cm.canonical_coercion(1r,2.r)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 234 ns per loop
sage: %timeit cm.canonical_coercion(1r,complex(1r,1r))
1000000 loops, best of 3: 469 ns per loop
