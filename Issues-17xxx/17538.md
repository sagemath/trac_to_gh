For various rings, `is_prime()` is implemented for ideals but not elements. Since an element `x` of a ring `R` is called *prime* if the ideal `(x)` is a prime ideal, we should use this to define `is_prime()` for elements.

```
sage: GaussianIntegers = NumberField(x^2+1, 'I').ring_of_integers()
sage: A = GaussianIntegers([2,1])
sage: B = GaussianIntegers.ideal(A)
sage: B.is_prime()
True
```
Hmm.  But maybe it isn't always this easy.

(Note: this is largely motivated by #7545.)

<a id='comment:2'></a>I currently have

```python
    def is_prime(self):
        if not self:  # We exclude the 0 element
            return False
        try:
            J = self._parent.ideal(self)
        except AttributeError:
            raise NotImplementedError
        return J.is_prime()
```

This seems to work fine.
