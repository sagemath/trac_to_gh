Hi,
I'm doing some computations based on enumerating graphs via "nauty_geng()", which enumerate all graphs of a given order.

For each graph, among other few things, I test the odd girth of the generated graphs (see code below). The code runs fine for some hours (i.e. it is able to perform the odd_girth() test for many millions graphs), but after some time it fails, with an error message indicating there is a problem in Graph.odd_girth(). The error messages indicate a possible relation with matrices and/or primes (see below).

Unfortunately since the code runs fine for some hours and only fails after a long time, I cannot reproduce the bug without doing the whole computation.

Note: I realise that I am using the precompiled version 5.8 of sage that comes with the ubuntu repository (ubuntu 12.04). So maybe this is fixed in newer versions... In any case I will now use the latest release.
EDIT: the same bug happens with Sage 6.4 (run on another computer).

Here is my code:

```
def OG7_NOhomC5(begin,end):
    F=[]
    C5=graphs.CycleGraph(5)
    for n in [begin .. end]: #range for orders
        for g in graphs.nauty_geng("%s -c -t -d2 -D6"%n):
            if g.girth()==4 and g.odd_girth()>=7:
                maps=g.has_homomorphism_to(C5)
                if maps == False:
                    F += [(g.graph6_string())]
                    print ' found :-)',F
```

And I called:

```
OG7_NOhomC5(13,13)
```

```
OG7_NOhomC5(14,14)
```

```
OG7_NOhomC5(15,15)
```

in three different worksheets of the notebook interface.

And here are 2 different tracebacks that stopped the computation of "OG7_NOhomC5(13,13)" and "OG7_NOhomC5(14,14)", both have an error located in "odd_girth()". Note that "OG7_NOhomC5(15,15)" has not stopped, and is still running after about 8 hours.

```

Replying to [@nathanncohen](#comment%3A4):
> Yes, thanks. Could you give us the graphs `g` that your code found such that `g.odd_girth` produces a bug ?

OK, so here is one graph of order 15 for which there was an error:
`:NqA?PRGSqgbG\AWbIWyGaESp~`

And another one of order 14 (for this one, I got the "running out of prime" error):
<code>:MoAG\`oAQ@RFR?PAecKhbg</code>

Edit: a third one, of order 13 this time: `:Lm?K@RHGhbrGS{PdKb`

For all of them, calling odd_girth() is not a problem. Note that they all have odd girth 5. Maybe this is a problem with the amount of calls to "odd_girth()" that are done?
