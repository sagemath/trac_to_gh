consider the following with Sage 6.0:

```
sage: R=RealField(113)
sage: a=R("8.935761195587725798762818805462843676e-01")
sage: b=bessel_Y(0,a)
sage: c=R(bessel_Y(0,RealField(200)(a)))
sage: (b-c)/c.ulp()
-3.00000000000000000000000000000000
sage: b
-7.44623881999333920107530266264974e-7
sage: c
-7.44623881999333920107530266264973e-7
```
Given that MPFR provides correct rounding for bessel_Y (mpfr_y0) this should not happen.

Depends on #17130

The example is wrong, I get

```
sage: R = RealField(113)
sage: a = R("1.414213562373095048801688724209698177")
sage: b = bessel_Y(0,a)
sage: c = R(bessel_Y(0,RealField(200)(a)))
sage: (b-c)/c.ulp()
0.000000000000000000000000000000000
sage: b

sage: c
0.344636931299712753154578621698097
```

Anyway, numerical evaluation of Bessel functions is done using mpmath, not mpfr. I guess the reason is that mpfr can only compute `Y(n,x)` for *integers* n, while mpmath supports more general complex numbers for `n`.

Note that you can access the mpfr functions directly using

```
sage: R = RealField(113)
sage: a = R("1.414213562373095048801688724209698177")
sage: a.y0()
0.344636931299712753154578621698097

sorry, the value of `a` was wrong, I changed it in the description.

Indeed MPFR can only handle integer n for Y(n,x), but it would better to call it in that case,
since it guarantees correct rounding (and thus numerical reproducibility).
