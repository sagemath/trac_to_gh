stricmp is being deprecated in Cygwin
See https://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2014-10/msg00359.html
One should use strcasecmp

This makes Singular build fail on Cygwin32 (not Cygwin64 at the moment).

Nope, and I won't do so before end of february when I come back to France.
Feel free to do it, but note it is not a high priority as:
- it only affects Cygwin32
- I did not check the state of Singular 4-0-x.
