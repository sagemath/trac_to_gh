At long long long long last.

I have been wanting to write this for ages but never really needed it. And one should never implement something unless one needs it.

Here it is. It does what `SubgraphSearch` already does for graphs, but it does it for hypergraphs. The code is just a simple eunmeration of all possibilities, with a couple of cuts. The implementation tries to make this as cheap as possible.

We now have a `IncidenceStructure.isomorphic_substructures_iterator` whose name is similar to the new `Poset.has_isomorphic_subposet`.

Oh, and it does not work if the pattern you try to find had >64 points. It is already very large considering how hard it is to run this code anyway, plus making it work for >64 implied a +50% cost even for small instances on my use case. So I thought it was not worth it.

Right now it handles induced and non-induced hypergraph. Later, in another patch, it can be improved to deal with another definition of "substructure" and compute things like the VC-dimension, in case somebody cares.

Hello,

> If you can't find an OSX machine around, I can hook up a spare laptop running OSX so that you can ssh into it.Hopefully this will be fast enough. Do you still have access to arando box? Anyhow, you will need to ssh into arando, and from it to the laptop.

I just tried again the instructions you gave me on the 13/06/13 to connect to arando, but I got the following (on boxen):

```
ncohen@boxen:~$ ssh -p21925 localhost
ssh: connect to host localhost port 21925: Connection refused
```

A colleague of mine who has a Mac laptop "may" come in the afternoon. And if she is willing I "could" take it from her for a while, and compile Sage from its sources and stuff.

But really it would be cool if the same machine that Volker uses for his tests could be used for debugging, because really it is very very troublesome to get some code to work on an architecture that I do not have access to.
