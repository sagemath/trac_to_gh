Arne just uploaded a fixed tarball at:
http://www.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~astorjoh/iml-1.0.4.tar.bz2

It includes the netlib cblas.h as was advertized for 1.0.4.

Because of our caching system for tarball distribution we cannot simply replace the old one and update checksums, whence the spkg-src script.

Use tarball at:
* http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jpflori/upstream/iml-1.0.4p1.tar.bz2

I also removed the now useless hack for Darwin.
