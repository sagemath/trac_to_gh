<a id='comment:10'></a>I should have commented in #17881, commenting here was a mistake. I am talking about the doctest you removed so far in `sage/rings/integer.pyx` it gives a sligthly different answer for gmp than mpir. This is something we have identified a while ago with Jean-Pierre Flori.

For info this is what it gives for gmp:
