The script `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/sphinx-build` (which is copied over from `build/pkgs/sphinx/patches/sphinx-build`) is broken since it refers to the wrong version.

The Sage documentation build no longer uses the `sphinx-build` script, so this wasn't noticed immediately. Manually calling this script gives

```

<a id='comment:16'></a>Okay, here is our `src/doc/common/custom-sphinx-build.py`

```

"""
This is Sage's version of the sphinx-build script

Enhancements are:

* import the Sage library to access the docstrings, otherwise doc
  buliding doesn't work.

* redirect stdout to our own logger, and remove some unwanted chatter.
"""
```
Although this is actually now in `builder.py`, and in any case the magic place this is needed is there too - 

```
    def get_module_docstring_title(self, module_name):
        """
        Returns the title of the module from its docstring.
        """
        #Try to import the module
        try:
            __import__(module_name)
        except ImportError as err:
            logger.error("Warning: Could not import %s %s", module_name, err)
            return "UNABLE TO IMPORT MODULE"
```

So as long as we aren't trying to auto-generate stuff with [autodoc](http://sphinx-doc.org/ext/autodoc.html) in these we should be cool.

I think the point is that the `sphinx-build` which is in the `patches` directory of sphinx is no longer needed because we don't need to import sage.all any more for that, since it's not the one used to build Sage doc.  The version in `src/doc/common` refers to it, but actually the import is in `builder.py`, and there it is indeed necessary so that autodoc can do its stuff - or if not, maybe to raise an error earlier?\n\nAnyway, if the files in `src/doc/common` can be modified, let's make that a different ticket.",
