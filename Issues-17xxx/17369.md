The script `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/sphinx-build` (which is copied over from `build/pkgs/sphinx/patches/sphinx-build`) is broken since it refers to the wrong version.

The Sage documentation build no longer uses the `sphinx-build` script, so this wasn't noticed immediately. Manually calling this script gives

What makes you think that this has to do with the `sphinx-build` script?

Okay, here is our `src/doc/common/custom-sphinx-build.py`

```

"""
This is Sage's version of the sphinx-build script

Enhancements are:

* import the Sage library to access the docstrings, otherwise doc
  buliding doesn't work.

* redirect stdout to our own logger, and remove some unwanted chatter.
"""
```
Although this is actually now in `builder.py`, and in any case the magic place this is needed is there too - 

```
    def get_module_docstring_title(self, module_name):
        """
        Returns the title of the module from its docstring.
        """
        #Try to import the module
        try:
            __import__(module_name)
        except ImportError as err:
            logger.error("Warning: Could not import %s %s", module_name, err)
            return "UNABLE TO IMPORT MODULE"
```

So as long as we aren't trying to auto-generate stuff with [autodoc](http://sphinx-doc.org/ext/autodoc.html) in these we should be cool.

I didn't mean to delete you as a reviewer. Sorry about that.

I meant that the changes in this ticket look good to me: there is no need to import `sage.all` in the `sphinx-build` script (that's what I meant by "this file"), so we should go back to using the standard version of that script.
