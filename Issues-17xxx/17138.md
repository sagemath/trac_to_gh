Complement of an element of lattice, if it exists, is not necessarily unique. Hence returning an array from `complements()` seems to be totally wrong. Right way is to return a dict of lists if called without arguments and a list if called with one element as argument.

To clarify what is wrong in all possible meanings for a function called "complements":

```
sage: Posets.PentagonPoset().complements()
[4, 3, 1, 1, 0]
sage: LatticePoset({'a':'b'}).complements()
[1, 0]
```

Hello !

- depreceated -> deprecated

- `Use FiniteLattices::complements()` -- this is not C++ ! Plus the message should probably be "complements() is only defined on LatticePoset" or something. I mean, an error message telling the user that he should change the poset's type itself.

- Given how broken that function is, perhaps it is better to raise an exception rather than a warning.. What do you think ? Besides, that function is defined in `HasseDiagram` which are not really meant to be used directly anyway.

- (Do as you like but) the "comps" loop could have been rewritten as

```
return {self._vertex_to_element(u):map(self._vertex_to_element,l)
        for u,l in c.iteritems()
        if l}
```

- Why do you test `cardinality==0` instead of `if x not in self` ?

- `for x in self.list()` can also be written `for x in self`

Done this.

This says `AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'iteritems'`.

Running `meet()` or `join()` will check that element belongs to the lattice, the only exception is empty lattice. (Well, partly because of that the code is non-optimal. But at least it works.)

I don't know. Can function from `HasseDiagram` be directly deleted without deprecating it first? For now I changed phrasing in the message.

`O_o`

`comps` seems to be a dictionary in your code, not a list `O_o`

> Running `meet()` or `join()` will check that element belongs to the lattice, the only exception is empty lattice. (Well, partly because of that the code is non-optimal. But at least it works.)

`O_o`

Well, it would still be clearer to check 'element in self' rather than the cardinality `O_o`

> I don't know. Can function from `HasseDiagram` be directly deleted without deprecating it first? For now I changed phrasing in the message.

We can keep it like that, it does not matter much. One year from now we will remove it, no harm done I guess.

Hmmmmmm.... The problem with 'random' flags is that it basically means that the output is not tested. Could you write a real doctest in a "TEST" section ? Something that tests that what the output claims to be complements indeed yield the top as their meet and the bottom as their join ?

Otherwise this function actually is not tested.

    "body": "<a id='comment:18'>**Comment 18:**</a>\nNo, that would not work. Here is the reason:\n\n1) The order in which elements are listed when you iterate upon the elements of a dictionary is architecture-dependent. If you write a doctest that just 'displays' the content of a dictionary, it will break on some machines. The problem is not only the order of the lists of complements.\n\n2) Actually, there is in Sage a 'hack' that reorders the entry of a dictionary before they are displayed. I expect that it uses a 'sort' or something, which works fine if you have only integers or only strings as keys to your dictionary. On the other hand, Volker says that comparing int and strings can be architecture dependent, as it is probably done according to the memory locations\n\n3) I believe that \"random order\" should be just \"random\"\n\nI added a commit which does some non-architecture-dependent checks on the output of the function. Tell me what you think, and you can set the ticket to `positive_review` if you agree with it !\n\nThanks,\n\nNathann\n\n---\n**New commits:**\n<table><tr><td><a href=\"https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/cf4f72988a9910e9e64bbef4653524b59af5c67b\">cf4f729</a></td><td><code>trac #17138: Dangerous doctest</code></td></tr></table>\n",

No, that would not work. Here is the reason:

1) The order in which elements are listed when you iterate upon the elements of a dictionary is architecture-dependent. If you write a doctest that just 'displays' the content of a dictionary, it will break on some machines. The problem is not only the order of the lists of complements.

2) Actually, there is in Sage a 'hack' that reorders the entry of a dictionary before they are displayed. I expect that it uses a 'sort' or something, which works fine if you have only integers or only strings as keys to your dictionary. On the other hand, Volker says that comparing int and strings can be architecture dependent, as it is probably done according to the memory locations

3) I believe that "random order" should be just "random"

I added a commit which does some non-architecture-dependent checks on the output of the function. Tell me what you think, and you can set the ticket to `positive_review` if you agree with it !

Thanks,

Nathann

Documentation says if comment *contains* strgin "random", then it will not be tested. So one could write for example "Slightly random due numerical approximations". But not an important thing.

Works. Thanks.

The order in `sorted(['a', 42])` is random (depends on memory location). `sorted(['a', '42'])` is not. Dictionaries are sorted by key in the displayhook, so if you don't mix strings and ints as keys then they are always printed he same. 

Possible solutions
