[Regina](https://regina-normal.github.io/) is a suite of mathematical software for 3-manifold topologists. It focuses on the study of 3-manifold triangulations, normal surfaces, and angle structures.

Other highlights of Regina include census enumeration, combinatorial recognition of triangulations, and high-level tasks such as 3-sphere recognition and connected sum decomposition. Regina comes with a full graphical user interface, and also offers Python bindings and a low-level C++ programming interface. 

It would be nice to have an interface in Sage.

Note: a Docker image for Sage + SnapPy + Regina + PHCPack + more is available:
- Docker image: https://hub.docker.com/r/computop/sage/
- code repository: https://bitbucket.org/t3m/sagedocker
- dockerfile: https://bitbucket.org/t3m/sagedocker/src/tip/sage/Dockerfile

Depends on #31456
