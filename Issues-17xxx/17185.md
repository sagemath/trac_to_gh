XDGBDS would help to distinguish between user data, user config and cache files. Currently it's all in `DOT_SAGE` and the user don't know which of these files can safely be removed without losing worksheets, for example. 

See https://wiki.debian.org/XDGBaseDirectorySpecification for details.

We might use https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyxdg to implement this.
