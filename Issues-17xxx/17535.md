The following code fails

```
K.<c> = FunctionField(QQ)
A.<x> = AffineSpace(K,1)
f = Hom(A,A)([x^2 + c])
f.homogenize(1)
```

The issue appear to be that the the LCM of the denominators is the integer 1 in this example, so the substitution fails. Coercing that LCM into the base ring fixes at least this particular example. More testing is needed to determine if there are any other issues with function fields.
