```
In this ticket, we:
- implement the two functions `prime_part_m` and `binomial` directly as methods of Sage integers and get rid of the `late_import` in `sage.rings.integer`
- simplify the import logic in `rings.arith`
- replace in arith `prod([x for x in hum])` by `prod(x for x in hum)`
- remove some useless comments in arith
- deprecate `powermodm_ui`
- remove 1 from the output of `prime_powers()` (consistent with #16878)
- remove the method `lcm` from `Rational`

Depends on #16878

And `powermodm_ui` should be a deprecated alias for `powermod`: what's the point of an optimized path for `unsigned long` in a **Python function**?

Then you can also remove

```
MAX_UNSIGNED_LONG = 2 * sys.maxsize
```
(which is wrong anyway!)

This looks dubious to me:

EDIT: you are definitely right... see the commit below!

If an object `n` is not a Sage Element `parent(n)` returns the type of `n`.

```
sage: parent(3r)
<type 'int'>
sage: parent(Graph())
<class 'sage.graphs.graph.Graph'>
```
The code `parent(n) in [int,long]` is (roughly) equivalent to `type(n) in [int,long]`. I find much cleaner to use `isinstance`. If you do have a use case for which there is a difference, then please tell me.

Vincent

<a id='comment:40'>Comment 40:</a>
For the binomial function: the documentation mentions

```
Either ``m`` or ``x-m`` must be an integer.
```
but the code doesn't reflect this.

I think therefore you need

```
try:
    m = Integer(m)
except TypeError:
    m = Integer(x - m)
```
Also, a doctest should be added for this case.

And the conversion of `x` to `ZZ` should be added after the PARI branch.

I'm not sure that I like this:

```
sage: a = binomial(float(1001), float(1)); a

sage: type(a)

Shouldn't `float` input also give `float` output?

I also changed the values to `(2**100).binomial(2**19)` (it is a number with 43223705 bits). At least on my computer, the RAM used stays below 2G.

Right. On the previous version we had

```
sage: type(binomial(5r,2r))
<type 'int'>
sage: type(binomial(5r,2))
<type 'sage.rings.integer.Integer'>
sage: type(binomial(5,2r))
<type 'sage.rings.integer.Integer'>
```
I will change that.

Thanks!

I also noticed that on large input `pari` is faster than `mpir`:

```
sage: %timeit a = (2**50).binomial(2**10, algorithm='mpir')
1000 loops, best of 3: 462 µs per loop
sage: %timeit a = (2**50).binomial(2**10, algorithm='pari')
1000 loops, best of 3: 221 µs per loop
```
and the difference is even more significant with larger numbers... I will had a note related to that.

Finally, I have troubles with the modification of the output type in `arith.binomial` ([comment:48](#comment%3A48), [comment:51](#comment%3A51) and [comment:52](#comment%3A52)). It is responsible for some doctest failure in `rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_ideal.py` (the random generation stuff). I was not able to track down the issue.

> I'm not sure if `rings/arith.py:binomial` should do more than numerics because the console user will first see `functions/other.py:binomial` and use that. The programmer OTOH probably won't need other than numerics. So, your efforts in `rings/arith.py:binomial` regarding other rings looks wasted to me.

In the new version, `arith.binomial` do less than before regarding other rings (especially the symbolic one). What do you mean by numerics: integers? rationals? reals? complex? algebraic numbers?

> There is already #17489 removing function duplicity for `factorial` so this is something to think of.

Removing `binomial` from arith is not an option. On top of #17852 we have

```
sage: from sage.rings.arith import binomial as arith_binomial
sage: %timeit arith_binomial(10,4)
100000 loops, best of 3: 1.87 µs per loop
sage: %timeit binomial(10,4)
10000 loops, best of 3: 47.3 µs per loop
```
The slowdown is less dramatic for factorial but still visible

```
sage: from sage.rings.arith import factorial as arith_factorial
sage: %timeit arith_factorial(10)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 474 ns per loop
sage: %timeit factorial(10)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.02 µs per loop
```

Sorry but I still don't like the `binomial` code.

In particular, do we really need the coercion there? The arguments `x` and `m` play a very different role, note that `m` is immediately converted to an integer anyway.

Also, the check that `factorial(m)` is invertible has no mathematical meaning and should just be removed.

I will continue my review of the rest of this branch, please do not change anything except `binomial`.

Replace

sage: alarm(0.01); (2**100).binomial(2**19, algorithm='pari')
```

```
sage: alarm(0.5); (2^100).binomial(2^22, algorithm='pari')

With this value, the memory use is reasonable and the computation takes long enough (48s on my machine) that it will not answer in <0.5s in the near future.

I am not sure I understand. You don't want the case 2 that tries to convert `x` to an integer? It is much faster that way for real or rational input that are actually integers.

I am not sure that what I did in the branch is the best, but there is definitely something that needs to be specified (see #12179). Would you be satisfied with

```
sage: factorial(Zmod(12)(10), 4)
3
```

Actually, it does matter. When an operation on a given quotient ring is implemented from the initial ring, you expect it to not depend on the representative you used... but

```
sage: R = Integers(6)
sage: R(binomial(5,2))
4
sage: R(binomial(5+6,2))
1
```
Note that it would have been fine on quotients in which `2!` is invertible.

I mean this:

```
    if parent(m) is not P:
        from sage.structure.element import get_coercion_model
        cm = get_coercion_model()
        x,m = cm.canonical_coercion(x,m)
        P = parent(x)
```

<a id='comment:85'>Comment 85:</a>
I thought a bit more about the invertibility check: in fact it has nothing to do with integral domains, but with the *characteristic* of the ring.

This is also not well-defined, despite `R` being a field:

```
sage: R = Zmod(7)
sage: binomial(R(10), 7)
1
sage: R(binomial(17, 7))
2
```

The correct condition is that `factorial(m)` should be coprime to the characteristic of the ring. So the code should be something like

```
try:
    c = P.characteristic()
except AttributeError:
    # Assume that P has characteristic zero
    pass
else:
    if c > 0 and any(c.gcd(k) > 1 for k in range(2, m+1)):
        raise ...
```
(you don't need `Q` for this)

The example with `Zmod(7)` should be added as doctest.
