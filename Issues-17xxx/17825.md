The sardonis patchbot has one relevant doctest fail. It appears that to determine `RIF(-1,1) < oo` it has to be coerced to the infinity ring but it has no sign. OTOH, `RIF(-1,1) < oo` is perfectly easily solvable so should not give an error.

Replying to [@rwst](#comment%3A9):

That doesn't really matter. The coercion model always coerces. And it is the coercion which fails in this case. That is not easy to fix.
