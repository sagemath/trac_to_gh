Most of these are fixes I suggested back in #14543 that were split out of that ticket.

What really should be done is adding proper doc to the cycle-index-series/ordinary-generating-series/exponential-generating-series rings, particularly as the conventions used differ from the literature. But I don't know species well enough for that, so I've only added a makeshift definition of cycle index series in the docstring of `CycleIndexSeriesRing` (which is probably not where it belongs), and even that should checked by someone who knows the theory.

Looks all fine.  Just one very minor thing: I'd use a little x in the docstring of `CycleIndexSeriesRing(R)`. The X just looks very big for no purpose I can see.

Thank you!
