A simple and coherent extension of the binomial function 
to negative integers n, k was outlined by M. J. Kronenburg in
The Binomial Coefficient for Negative Arguments, 
http://arxiv.org/abs/1105.3689
(Thanks to John Palmieri for the reference.)

This extension amounts to define 

```
def BINOMIAL(n, k):
    if n in ZZ and k in ZZ: 
        if n >= 0 and k >= 0:
            return binomial(n, k)
        if k >= 0:
            return (-1)^k*binomial(-n+k-1, k)
        if k <= n:
            return (-1)^(n-k)*binomial(-k-1, n-k)
        return 0 
    else:
        return binomial(n, k)
```            
Here 'BINOMIAL' is the targeted version, 'binomial' the 
implemented version. The targeted behaviour is identical 
to the behaviour of the Maple and Mathematica function
for negative integers n, k.

Certainly there should not be implemented a modified and renamed binomial function in addition to the existing monomial function. The existing should just be extended to the case of negative input.

It could be that he thinks that fixing the problem is a matter of not more than 30 minutes. But if I understand correctly you have no experience with Sage development, yet. And I think Volker should take this into account.

> Simon, certainly. But only in this form I could test it against the implemented version without running into a recursion.


The implemented version just raises an error on negative input. Instead of raising the error, the binomial function should simply modify the given negative arguments according to the formula that you present in the ticket description.

Then, the documentation of the binomial function should be modified to contain a description and a test for the new behaviour. And to be on the safe side, the test suite should be run.

When working on a ticket, one ought to create a git branch for the ticket. The documentation will tell you how. For example, if you have the git trac scripts installed, you can do `git trac checkout 17123` on the commandline.

How to edit the binomial function?
First way: Find out in what module the function is defined.

```
sage: binomial.__module__
'sage.functions.other'
```
Hence, take your favourite editor and edit `SAGE_ROOT/src/sage/functions/other.py

Second way: In a running Sage session, do

```
sage: edit(binomial, 'vim')
```
where vim is your favourite editor. It will open the correct file in the correct line (if not, report a bug!).

After saving the change, leave Sage and do `make` (which will also build the changes in the documentation) or better `make test` in order to also run the test suite of Sage.

If everything works, commit your changes (`git commit -a`) and push them to this ticket (with the git trac scripts, this is `git trac push`).

Volker, it actually seems to me that the change is not totally straight forward.

There is the `_eval_` method, and the `_evalf_` method. Probably both need to be changed.

And there is the `_binomial_sym` method. Will this need a change as well? It currently returns zero if the second argument is negative:

```
sage: binomial._binomial_sym(x,-5)
0
```
Should the return value be a different symbolic expression? After all, the value (according to the formula in the ticket description) is not zero if x evaluates to a negative number that is greater or equal to `-5`.

So, here I don't know a good answer.

I know that there is a learning curve, but once you figure it out it is a very efficient workflow. So what I'm trying to say is: Its worthwhile to figure out how to use git.

`_eval_` and `_evalf_` punt to either `_binomial_sym` (for symbolic expressions) or `sage.rings.arith.binomial` (for numbers), so both of the latter need to be changed.

So presumably the change here would require a deprecation warning.

John, this is why I offered to discuss things first on sage-devel and hear more arguments. 

"Apparently Maple and Mathematica use the proposed version. Is that sufficient justification to change our version?"

Of course not, although for me this is a strong hint that something is missing in the current Sage implementation. 

But this is a reason:
 {{{
 sage: binomial(-1, -1)
 0
 }}}
 
More generally, binomial(z, z) != 1 is absurd, a bug IMO, and definitely a reason to change things. binomial(z, z) = 1 for all z is the first thing to be preserved.
 
Next the relation of the diagonals to the Fibonacci numbers is another important thing which should be preserved (and the proposed extension does this although apparently Kronenburg misses to mention this in his paper).
 
The additive formula is nice in the region where the formula applies, but the multiplicative formula is the more important one, a viewpoint taken by all major modern authors as far as I understand.

The pseudocode in the ticket description does not seem to fit the paper given as reference, quote:

```
For nonnegative integer n and integer k this reduces to [1]:

(1.2) binomial(n,k) = n!/(k!(n-k)!) if 0<=k<=n, 0 otherwise

... This results in the following binomial coefficient identity,
which with identity (1.2) allows computation of the binomial coefficient for all integer
arguments.

(2.1) Theorem 2.1. For negative integer n and integer k:

binomial(n,k) = (-1)^k * binomial(-n+k-1,k) if k>0,
                (-1)^(n-k) * binomial(-k-1,n-k) if k<=n,
                0 otherwise
...
```
so in my opinion the definition should rather be

```
def BINOMIAL(n, k):
    if n in ZZ and k in ZZ: 
        if n >= 0:
            return binomial(n, k)
        if k >= 0:
            return (-1)^k*binomial(-n+k-1, k)
        if k <= n:
            return (-1)^(n-k)*binomial(-k-1, n-k)
        return 0 
    else:
        return binomial(n, k)
```
This leaves a discrepancy between `binomial(*,k<0)` and `BINOMIAL(*,k<0)` in the area `n<0, k<n` and to get to the point I would ask darij to provide a Knuth reference that supports the behaviour of `binomial` for these values.

Ralf, a quick numerical check did not show any difference:

```
    for n in (-4..4):
        print "plu", [n], [BINOMIAL   (-n , -k) for k in (-6..6)]
        print "rws", [n], [BINOMIALrws(-n , -k) for k in (-6..6)]
```
So please give one counterexample (n,k) where the definitions differ.

But I do prefer my form over your form. I write 

```
    if n >= 0 and k >= 0:
        return binomial(n, k)
```    
and this makes it perfectly clear that in this region nothing 
changes, that all changes apply only to negative integers. 
I think this lowers the burden of understanding the code.
    
Darij: "... your convention is not standard in any way."

(1) If it were standard it would be pointless to call 
it an 'extension'. 
   
(2) As an extension it is standard for more than a quarter
of a century due to the fact that both Maple and Mathematica
use this extension ever since the beginning.

(3) So even if you prefer not to use this extension in
your papers using Sage will give you different results 
than many of your colleagues will get with different software. 

And indeed this was for me the motivation to write this 
ticket: I found the confusion annoying which shows up in 
many places in the code on OEIS because the systems behave
differently and that this fact is often overlooked. Nobody
expects this to happen with a standard function like 'binomial'.

Therefore I would even prefer a "value error" (or what
it is called) for arguments not in the range 0<=k<=n
for integer k, n, over the current behaviour of Sage. 

Darij: "I don't know why people are saying that it is 
currently undefined." 

This is the difference between a formal "... otherwise 0"
and a definition guided by mathematical considerations
which aims to enlarge relations to the largest possible
region of validity. (Instead accepting things like 
binomial(z, z) != 1 as a collateral damage.)

The 0 definition does enlarge a relation to its largest possible domain of validity -- the recurrence relation, to the whole integer lattice. Unlike the symmetry, the recurrence actually is used all the time in proofs. The 0 definition also matches with the idea that (-1)^k (-n choose k) is the number of k-element multisets of elements of {1, 2, ..., n}.

Darij: "If it is an extension, then call it `binomial_extension`
or whatever; do not usurp `binomial`."

Volker's proposal above is: "We could also have an optional 
keyword argument binomial(n, k, extension='Knuth')". This 
looks like a good idea to me, perhaps better with the name 
'symmetrical' instead of 'Knuth'.
 
Darij: "Maple and Mathematica do not set standards in combinatorics."

But you can also not ignore them especially as Sage's
mission is to become a viable alternative to theses systems. 

"We should be going for the definition which is the most
reliable and standard in *mathematical* literature. And 
here it is the 0 one."

I agree. But this does not mean that we should block
interesting developments either. Volker's proposal shows
the way.

On a side note: Don Knuth is known to be happily hacking 
with Mathematica for a long time 
http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~uno/screen.jpeg
and reading his 'Convolution Polynomials' with it's many 
implicit and explicit uses of the binomial function I 
do not see him complain about the way Mathematica defines it.

As pointed out elsewhere on this ticket, making the proposed change breaks the identity `binomial(n-1, k-1) + binomial(n-1,k) == binomial(n,k)`, which suggests to me that the proposed change is a bad convention.

This is not true. With the solution shown in my blog linked above the identity 
remains valid. [See here.](http://luschny.de/temp/ExtendedBinomial.html)

And it would be far more sensible instead of offering different versions
because of some special cases to seek a consistent mathematical solution.

Summary:

One single natural idea : use the expression of Binomial in term of Gamma functions

==> this gives unique and well-defined values for all integers (n,k)

==> for k >= 0, these values are the same as the ones coming from the polynomiality in n

==> the addition rule works everywhere but for (-1,-1)+(-1,0) != (0,0)

==> this works very well in the context of hypergeometric series, where the natural way to extend binomials is to pass to Gamma products.

==> and this satisfies the symmetry property (n,k) = (n, n-k)

So it seems to me that we have very good reasons to change. I am also personnally totally convinced that this is the only **correct convention** and that setting blandly to 0 was just done by some kind of lazyness.

Would it be useful to ask the opinion of one of the great masters of hypergeometric series ?

Hello, Darij. I hear your preoccupation, but I do not quite understand it. Do you have one concrete case to show me ?

I have one supporting the change : consider

```
sum(binomial(n, i) * binomial(n - i - l - 1, i - 1) *
               x ** i * y ** l for i in range(1, floor(n/2) + 1)
               for l in range(n - 2 * i + 1))
```
This gives for me the result that I expect if and only if binomial(-1,-1)=1.

The proposal would change the value when both n and k are negative, from 0 (now) to some integers obtained as limits of Gamma products.

Of course, we can easily propose either an "old_binomial" function or an "oldstyle" keyword. What would you prefer ?

What would the expected result be?

Here is an example:

```
binom = binomial

def lr(n, k):
    return sum(binom(n+u-1, u) * binom(n, k-2*u) for u in range(k+1)) - binom(n+k-1, k)
```
This should yield 0 for all n and k. (See http://www.cip.ifi.lmu.de/~grinberg/QEDMO4P13.pdf for a proof for n and k nonnegative. It then follows for all n because both sides are polynomials in n. Finally, the k < 0 case is simply a 0 = 0 statement.)

If your definition breaks it for negative k, okay. But if it breaks it for positive k and negative n, then your definition is bad. Changing the bound of the sum to something like floor(k/2) is exactly the kind of annoyance that a good definition avoids!

Well, this identity of yours stays true for all n and k>=0 if you use the floor bound.

I would like to argue that not using a floor bound is correct if n > 0, but is not the good way to go if n < 0.

I must be misunderstanding: the function `f(x,y) = gamma(x + 1) / (gamma(y + 1)*gamma(x - y + 1))` is singular when `x` is a negative integer.  See "The Binomial Coefficient Function, David Fowler, The American Mathematical Monthly, Vol. 103, No. 1 (Jan., 1996), pp. 1-17" for an analysis.

Still, I think it would be practical to define the binomial coefficient in this way, throwing an error when the limit does not exist.  Then it becomes very easy for the user to extend it whenever necessary, because she can catch the exception.  This 
solution also has the advantage of making the conventions explicit in all methods.

I think the solution of defining the binomial coefficient as
`binomial(x0, y0)=limit(limit(f(x,y), y=y0), x=x0)`
(in this order) is inferior, because it yields surprising results, in particular `binomial(-1,-1)=0`.

Yes, you are misunderstanding. Try this:

```
def limit_binomial(n, k):
    return limit(gamma(n + x) / (gamma(k + x)*gamma(n - k + x)), x = 1) 
for n in (-5..5): print [limit_binomial(n, k) for k in (-5..5)]

limit_binomial(-1,-1) = 1
```

OK, I thought that Frederic was referring to the other expression of the binomial in terms of the gamma function.  I was further misled by another blog post saying that Mathematica uses the iterated limit definition.

So, one question is whether sage should use

```
limit(gamma(x0 + h) / (gamma(y0 + h)*gamma(x0-y0+h)), h=1)
```
or

```
limit(gamma(x + 1) / (gamma(y + 1)*gamma(x-y+1)), (x,y)=(x0,y0))
```
as definition, and you are saying that the first is better, because it is works always, right?

Yes. And I'm sure that Mathematica also uses it contrary to your information
because otherwise they would have similar problems as the ones you ran into. 
But they do not have problems.

Note that this argument (embedding into C in conformance to hypergeometric
considerations) is only one argument. 

Also from the combinatorial point of view it makes sense to define:

```
    def Binomial(n, k):
        if n in ZZ and k in ZZ: 
            if n >= 0:
                return binomial(n, k) 
            if k >= 0:
                return (-1)^k*binomial(-n+k-1, k) 
            if k <= n:
                return (-1)^(n-k)*binomial(-k-1, n-k) 
            return 0 
        return binomial(n, k)
```
	
You can use this definition with 'binomial' taking Sage's current binomial.

The reflection property of the binomial numbers is similar and
related to the reflection property of the Stirling numbers 
{n,k} = [-k,-n] and of the Lah numbers L|n,k| = L| -k,-n|.
This has been observed by Riordan, Knuth and others.

I think that I dislike the fact that your definition (by the way: is it yours? otherwise, do you have a reference?) is not continuous.

Can we assume that everybody agrees that for `x` not negative integral, `gamma(x+1)/(gamma(y+1)*gamma(x-y+1))` is a good definition of `binomial(x,y)`?

Do (at least the more important) packages agree on these values, and disagreement is only for negative integral `x`?

If so, wouldn't it still be best to define `binomial` with an optional argument, `extension`, which defaults to `None`.  Then we could even emulate the behaviour of other packages, whenever useful.

I think it is safest to have the optional argument being `None`, sage could throw a useful error in this case.  Then we get an additional check of the usage of binomial in the sage library.

  "..your definition (by the way: is it yours? otherwise,

I do not claim any originality whatsoever with this definition.  
For references see what I have written on my blog linked above, 
and the references given there. 

  
"Can we assume that everybody agrees that for `x` not negative integral,
 `gamma(x+1)/(gamma(y+1)*gamma(x-y+1))` is a good definition of `binomial(x,y)`?"
 
Pardon me? No, what is g(x,y) for x = 1, y = -1 with this 'definition'?

An extension which does not give the reflection formula for the binomial

` binomial(-k, -n) = (-1)^(n-k) binomial(n-1, k-1)  `

is completely worthless, potentially introducing new errors.

"I think it is safest to have the optional argument being `None`.. ""

Three years ago Volker Braun suggested above:

"We could also have an optional keyword argument binomial(n, k, extension='Knuth')."

What's so great about this reflection formula that it has to hold for all integers n and k?

Here's another reason for (n choose k) to be 0 when n < 0 and k < 0: The coefficient in this case counts certain multisubsets of size k. There are none of them when k < 0.

I also don't buy the hypergeometric-functions argument. Graham, Knuth and Patashnik, in Chapter 5 of CM, define binomial coefficients to be 0 when k < 0, and this chapter does a good deal of hypergeometric manipulations. Sure, feel free to introduce another convention, but don't change the defaults!

What a question!

As a short answer I cite GKP, CM on what they write in the Stirling case:

"In fact, a surprisingly pretty pattern emerges: The two kinds
of Stirling numbers are related by an extremely simple law:

[n, k] = {-k, -n}, integers k, n.

We have a "duality", something like the relations between min and max,
between floor(x) and ceiling(x), between falling factorial and rising
factorial, between gcd and lcm."

If such a relation exists for the binomial numbers, no CAS should presume to conceal it.

Yes, and I am saying that sage should have `binomial(n, k, extension=None)`, which should give the continuous version and raise an error for negative integral `n`, and then `binomial(n, k, extension='who_or_whatever')` for the various extensions.

(Assuming that all the extensions agree except for negative integral `n`.)

Is there any downside to this approach?

This would effectively set the present state forever,
which I consider unsatisfactory.

Chapoton reopened this issue yesterday with the words:
"I have just been hurt by that issue." 

And this issue will continue to hurt other users.
I have been hurt by that issue several times while
developing software for the OEIS. In the hypergeometric context
you 'feel' it, in many other cases it will bite unnoticed.

This is a bug and should be handled like a bug. 
I therefore propose to follow Johan S. R. Nielsen suggestion on 
[sage-devel](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/sage-devel/elPsSq6uhvg/X65B7TuvAwAJ):

   with conflicting behaviour. The warning tells the user to explicitly 
   set the optional argument if he wants to disable the warning. Warning 
   is removed in ~1 year.

   no more deprecation warnings.

This is not true:

**currently `binomial(-1,-1)` gives `0`, while I propose that it raises an exception (possibly after a deprecation period), forcing you to use an explicit extension.**

You and Frederic might use `binomial(-1, -1, extension='supertrooper')` whereas Darij might use `binomial(-1,-1, extension='themanwhosoldtheworld')`, but in any code you write, the extension chosen would be explicit!

> Chapoton reopened this issue yesterday with the words:

Yes, because sage currently silently returns `0`, which is not what he expected.
 
> And this issue will continue to hurt other users.


No, please read me proposal again.

Again, what is the downside to my approach?

You should be comparing with `binomial(n-1, n-k)`. These are really partitions of n-k you are summing over (the first part is just for convenience, as you clamp it to k).

Sorry, but it makes no sense on earth, in heaven and in other places to diverge from the (n choose k) = n(n-1)...(n-k+1)/k! standard for negative n as long as k >= 0. The binomial coefficients (n choose k) for a fixed k are a polynomial in n when n is nonnegative; why on earth would you want to break that?

As far as I can see, Peter is proposing the "Gamma" convention from https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/9502218.pdf.  I think that this agrees with what is roughly the "classical" convention in the paper whenever the latter is defined, that is `limit(gamma(x+1)/(gamma(y+1)*gamma(x-y+1)), (x,y)=(n,k))` whenever the limit exists.

So they agree in particular for `k>=0`.

However, I still think it would be better to force users to make an explicit choice for negative integral `n`.

Meanwhile I have found a reference for the reflexion formula: 
Martin Aigner, Kombinatorik I, Springer 1975, exercise on page 149. 
This book became part of his Combinatorial Theory, Grundlehren 234.

Since I learned from this book, it seemed always to me to be 
self-evident and I do not understand to this day why one should 
be reluctant to use it (or implement an extension which assures it).

let me please try to summarize:

1. all agree that it would be good to have the "gamma" convention from https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/9502218.pdf accessible

2. also the "zero" convention (I think that's equivalent to the iterated limit expression) should be accessible, and perhaps also other conventions

3. some formulas involving binomial coefficients depend on the chosen convention, and different CAS make different choices

4. we also need `binomial` for non-integral arguments

5. a continuous definition is desirable, for example for analytic stuff, but `limit(gamma(x+1)/(gamma(y+1)*gamma(x-y+1)), (x,y)=(n,k))` only exists when `n` is not a negative integer, which is very restrictive

possible solutions:

a. make some convention (very likely "gamma" - `limit(gamma(n+h)/(gamma(k+h)*gamma(n-k+h)), h=1)`) the default and make other conventions accessible
   * advantages: most users won't notice
   * disadvantages: convention-mismatch will go unnoticed

b. `binomial(n, k)` raises an error for negative integral `n` (even when `k` is a non-negative integer), and in this situation the convention must be chosen explicitly
   * advantages: convention-mismatch will go unnoticed
   * disadvantages: slightly harder to use and routines calling binomial will probably need adjustment in some places, although these should be easy to find

> let me please try to summarize:


I think there should be exactly two functions:

- one defined on N X N where N = {0,1,2,..},
- the other defined on C where C are the complex numbers.

This mirrors the case factorial / Gamma.

The first defined on N X N is the classical Pascal function
which is zero for all (n,k) which are not 0<=k<=n.

I leave open how the second is precisely defined, but it 
should reduce on the ZZ-grid to the values described by the 
Binomial function given above. This means in particular that 
on the ZZ-grid the reflection formula is valid, all values 
finite and Binomial(x, x) = 1 for all x.

For the naming: the first one could be called binomial(n,k)
and the second Binomial(x,y).

This means in particular that the existing Sage binomial function
needs not to be touched. No disadvantages, no deprecations.

version." Done. "Feel free to add binomial_symmetrized or whatever else
you want to call your function, however!" Fine.
So I think this will be OK with him. But he can take position himself, no?

No big difference for me. I think it is the analogy with factorial/Gamma
which I like. Of course we could also drop the Gamma function and introduce
`factorial(n,extension="Gamma")`. Matter of taste.

The current binomial is not defined on N x N, but on a larger domain.  Above you proposed at the same time to leave it untouched and to define it on N x N, which confused me.

Several people urged the author to publish the paper. 
But it is, of course, at the discretion of the author. 
Nevertheless, it may one day appear in the 
arXiv and you will recognize it by the excellent plots.

In his opinion, no path leads past the arguments of GKP in CM, 
with the effect that all integer values on the left half-plane 
have to be 0. In particular GKP writes:

"The symmetry identity fails for all other negative integers n, too. But
unfortunately it's all too easy to forget this restriction, since the
expression in the upper index is sometimes negative only for obscure 
(but legal) values."

Meanwhile I read yet another paper which is much more critical about 
the presentation of GKP:

David Fowler, The Binomial Coefficient Function,
The American Mathematical Monthly, Vol. 103, No. 1 (Jan., 1996), pp. 1-17

Fowler also makes the following interesting suggestion:

"One could generalise the standard binomial coefficients 
to include an extra argument, the slope at which the directional 
limit is to be taken, and thus extend such standard identities 
to negative arguments and perhaps find new ones."
