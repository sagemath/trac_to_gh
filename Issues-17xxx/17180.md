Hello,

In `rational_reconstruction.pyx` why did you import `Integer` from `sage.rings.integer`?

The following also looks like a type as there is neither `w1` nor `w2`

```
            mpz_swap(u1, v1)       # u1 = v1; v1 = w1
            mpz_swap(u2, v2)       # u2 = v2; v2 = w2
```

Beyond that, it looks nice.

Vincent

The `w1` and `w2` are not typos: they are "virtual" variables, see the lines above

```
mpz_submul(u1, q, v1) # w1 = u1 - q*v
mpz_submul(u2, q, v2) # w2 = u2 - q*v2
mpz_swap(u1, v1) # u1 = v1; v1 = w1
mpz_swap(u2, v2) # u2 = v2; v2 = w2
```

Introducing actual variables `w1` and `w2` would be slower than reusing `u1` and `u2`. Perhaps this should be documented better, but it's not a mistake.
