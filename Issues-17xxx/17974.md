Conversion of multivariate polynomials from PARI does not always work:

```
sage: A.<a> = PolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: B.<d,e> = PolynomialRing(A)
sage: f = pari(a*d)
sage: B(f)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: Unable to coerce PARI d to an Integer
```
A similar example:

```
sage: A.<a,b> = PolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: B.<d,e> = PolynomialRing(A)
sage: f = pari(a*d)
sage: B(f)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: Could not find a mapping of the passed element to this ring.
```


Keywords: multivariate polynomials pari

<a id='comment:2'></a>Hello,

Do you know how pari chooses the order of the variables

```
sage: A.<a> = PolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: B.<d,e> = PolynomialRing(A)
sage: f = pari(a*d)
sage: f
d*a
sage: B(f)
a*d
```

On the other hand, what do you think of

```
sage: f.sage()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
NameError: name 'd' is not defined
```

In PARI, the variables `x` and `y` are predefined (with `x` of higher priority) and subsequent variables get a successively lower priority in the order in which they are encountered.  Polynomials are printed with the variable of highest priority on the right.  In this example PARI sees `a` first, therefore it has higher priority than `d`.  Compare
{{{
sage: gp('a*d')
d*a
}}}
> On the other hand, what do you think of

This is because user-defined names are not part of the default context in which the evaluation is done.  You have to do
{{{
sage: f.sage({'a': a, 'd': d})
a*d
}}}
or
{{{
sage: f.sage(globals())
a*d
}}}

Ha nice! Could you add it to the documentation where you check pari conversion?
