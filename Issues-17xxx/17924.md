There is a race condition in `pexpect`, which is worked around by the `SageSpawn` class from #17686. Apply [attachment:test17924.patch] and rebuild `pexpect` to test this race condition.

After applying [attachment:test17924.patch]:

```
    sage -t src/sage/interfaces/qsieve.py  # Bad exit: 1
    sage -t local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sagenb-0.11.4-py2.7.egg/sagenb/notebook/worksheet.py
    # Bad exit: 1
    sage -t local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sagenb-0.11.4-py2.7.egg/sagenb/notebook/cell.py
    # Bad exit: 1
```

---

The original report was about running Sage under docker, which always triggers the race condition:

Minimal steps to reproduce and complete log:

```
# Install docker (here for Debian / Ubuntu):
> sudo apt-get install docker.io

# Run a docker container with Sage:
> docker run -t -i --entrypoint "sudo" sagemath/sage su - sage

This was tested with the centos-based image built by Volker:

        https://github.com/sagemath/docker

and a variety of homemade docker images built on several other linux
distributions (debian) and various recent versions of Sage (including
6.4.1, 6.5, 6.7). The failure is systematic.

Investing this further, it's the doctesting framework that fails in
forker.py. There seems to be a race condition at the complete end,
after collecting and reporting the results of the slaves: on line
2159, forker wants to put back something in the queue which is
reported as Full. If one tests just before whether the queue is empty,
the answer is positive, and the error disappears (isn't that a nice
heisenbug!!!). The error disappears as well if one inserts a little
sleep (no less than 0.3s!).

It's very frustrating not to have a better understanding of the cause
of the problem, and why it appears specifically under docker and those
files. If someone understands precisely the problem and can fix the
problem now, that's great. Otherwise, as this is a blocker for moving
further with deploying patchbots, we propose in the attached branch to
insert the emptyness test as a temporary workaround.

See the attached files [attachment:report1] and [attachment:report2].
Hopefully you can find something interesting besides what we reported.

I very well know the importance of having all data when tracking down
bugs, and how frustrating and time consuming it can be when you don't
have it under hand. And I appreciate that you are spending time on
this issue. But reciprocally, it's also time consuming to build
informative reports that reach the right balance of conciseness (so
that we can keep an overview of the ticket) while not losing any
useful information (for the record, I just spent 30 minutes on it).

With the issue at hand, it is really easy to reproduce everything. In
case you need to experiment further, may I recommend that you run the
tests yourself?

Thanks,
                                       Nicolas

PS: If this can save you a couple minutes, please send me your public
ssh key, and I'll grant you access to the exact machine on which I ran
the tests which has docker and the sage image installed.

I have never used docker and I don't feel like installing docker just to help fix this issue.

Thanks for your key. You should now be able to:

```
ssh root@onevm-92.lal.in2p3.fr
docker run -t -i sagemath/sage su - sage
...                   # as in the ticket description
```
Let me know if you encounter any issue.

Anyone else interested in investigating on this machine, just send me
your key. Otherwise installing docker boils down to:

```
     apt-get install docker.io    # on Ubuntu/Debian
```

I have updated the description to include this.
Cheers,

Hi!

During PyCon 2015, I discussed this issue with a couple people, and filled up the following ticket:

https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/12277

Ollie Walsh jumped in, investigated, and wrote an interesting report. It might actually be an issue on Sage's side. Could someone familiar with the peexpect interface and our doctest forker have a look at his report?

Is the notebook also using queues in a way which could explain the similar looking issue appearing in the notebook tests?

Hi,

There are a couple other sites (including the math lab in Orsay) that would be happy to setup a patchbot if a docker container solution was available. Given that we are rather stuck, and unless someone is willing to dig in soon, I would be tempted to go for the workaround of [comment:6] for now. What do you think?

I don't like fixing a problem with a work-around if one does not understand why the problem occurs or even why the fix works.

From my initial investigation, I couldn't figure out what the problem was. If you're willing to re-install the docker image on that machine, I can have a second fresh look.

Yes, that's why I called it a work around, not a fix :-)

Hi Jeroen!

The machine is up and running for you. Note that the docker image
slightly evolved since last time (there is a default entry point set
to start sage automatically by default). I just updated the
instructions accordingly in the ticket description. If you want to be
able to use strace & stuff in a privileged docker container this
becomes:

```
> ssh root@onevm-143.lal.in2p3.fr

root@onevm-143:~# docker run --privileged -t -i --entrypoint "sudo" sagemath/sage su -

-bash-4.3# yum install strace

-bash-4.3# su - sage

... as in the ticket description ...
```

Note that in this docker image `sage` is sudoer without password.

Good hunt!
                                Nicolas

I agree that it looks related, but there is actually no SystemExit caught. So I still don't understand how that race could have been responsible. Actually I don't understand at all why the SystemExit matters, it must be either a) coincidence, its just timing for the underlying race or b) catching SystemExit somehow changes how signals are handled.

Wrong...

Here is what really happens:
1. `pexpect` calls `os.fork()`, creating 2 Python processes.
2. In the child process, `pexpect` creates a `pty` and redirects stdin/stdout/stderr to this `pty`. As a consequence, anything `print`ed by the child process is not seen.
3. The child process receives a `SIGHUP`, which (due to the interrupt code in Sage) raises `SystemExit`.
4. The child process catches `SystemExit` and runs the code which is really meant for the parent process (this is the bug that #17686 fixes).
5. The child process puts something in the queue, filling it.
6. The parent process also tries to put something in the queue, which fails.

Logging (optional, to a file, with high-resolution time stamps) would be nice. Not on this ticket, obviously.
