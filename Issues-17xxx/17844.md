The change is not only **important** but **needed**! And it would be cool to have a comment saying why, i.e. `-LONG_MIN = LONG_MIN` for longs.

The improvement for the 0 case is not an improvement for elliptic curves since the group does not implement the method `zero`... but this is a different story.
