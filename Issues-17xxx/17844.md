Related note: It would be much better if this code for multiplication was closer to `generic_power_c` in `sage.structure.element`. And by the way, it would be cool to have a `generic_power_long_c`.

The change is not only **important** but **needed**! And it would be cool to have a comment saying why, i.e. `-LONG_MIN = LONG_MIN` for longs.
