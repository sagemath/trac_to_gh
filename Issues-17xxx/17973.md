Some method and parameter names in linear_code.py file are abbreviated names which might be confusing (for instance the `distance` parameter actually stands for the minimum distance).
Most importantly, the `gen_mat` method will be renamed `generator_matrix` and the `check_mat` method `parity_check_matrix`. 

Besides, some getter methods to access the private fields of linear codes exist but are not used internally in the class.
To support subclassing, it is better to use these instead of directly invoking a parameter.
