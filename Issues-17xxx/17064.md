This ticket is in fact a good example of why we should have review-without-dependencies like I always argued for. There was a conflict which was only in the dependency and which was also fixed in the dependency.

The release manager wouldn't have seen this conflict since he would first merge the dependencies (fixing the conflict), then this ticket. If the "review view" of tickets would do the same thing (show the difference between develop+dependencies and develop+dependencies+ticket), there wouldn't have been a red link.

Interesting, I wasn't aware of that.  The patchbot supposedly would have taken that into account, but I haven't seen many patchbot results lately - right now I get a 503, in fact.
