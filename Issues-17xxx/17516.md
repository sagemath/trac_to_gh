Given a polynomial from ℚ[X], we need a better way to express its roots using radical expressions if such an expression is possible.

The current approach, as used by e.g. `NumberFieldElement._symbolic_` (and after #14239 gets merged probably `AlgebraicNumber_base.radical_expression` instead), delegates this task to the `solve` method for expressions from the symbolic ring. That in turn will delegate to Maxima. But Maxima is not able to find a radical expression in all cases where they do exist:

```
sage: p = x^6-300*x^5+30361*x^4-1061610*x^3+1141893*x^2-915320*x+101724
sage: p.solve(x, explicit_solutions=True)
[]
sage: r = 1/8*((sqrt(4*(1/9*sqrt(109)*sqrt(3) + 2)^(1/3) - 4/3/(1/9*sqrt(109)*sqrt(3) + 2)^(1/3) + 17) + 5)^2 + 4)*(sqrt(4*(1/9*sqrt(109)*sqrt(3) + 2)^(1/3) - 4/3/(1/9*sqrt(109)*sqrt(3) + 2)^(1/3) + 17) + 5)
sage: r.minpoly() == QQ[x](p)
True
```

Computing the Galois group for a polynomial works pretty fast, but I'm not sure how much use that really is. I fear we might need the map between the original polynomial and the Galois closure. Converting the Galois closure for the example above takes some time, but not so much as converting that closure to pari. The time is apparently spent somewhere inside `_pari_integral_basis`. Now I wonder, do we actually have to call `galoisinit` on the galois closure as a number field? Or could we do that call on its defining polynomial instead? Something along these lines:

```

sage: p = x^6-300*x^5+30361*x^4-1061610*x^3+1141893*x^2-915320*x+101724
sage: K = NumberField(p, names="a")
sage: GC, GCm = K.galois_closure(names="b", map=True)
sage: q = GC.defining_polynomial()
sage: gal = pari(q).galoisinit()
sage: G = PermutationGroup(sorted(gal[6], cmp=cmp))
sage: G.is_solvable()
True
sage: ds = G.derived_series()
```

I still have to figure out how to turn that derived series into a radical expression. I hope you don't mind me posting thoughts along the way.

I don't think need you need to convert the group to Sage, I would use `galoisfixfield()` from PARI. The tricky part will be adding the roots of unity, you need to add them manually.

Passing which subgroup as an argument? I guess I should iterate over all normal subgroups, using `galoissubgroups` and `galoisisnormal`, which aren't available in Sage at the moment. #17519 should fix that.

I just started reading the chapter “How to solve a solvable equation” in the book [Classical Galois Theory](http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=isbn:082840268X) by Lisl Gaal. That sounds very promising, since it apparently concentrates on the algorithm, not the theorem.

I think it suffices to take the information from `galoisinit().gen` and `galoisinit().orders`, but I haven't checked the details.

Current experiments seem to indicate that `gal.galoisfixfield(gal[6][:-1])` might be enough. At least for the given example. But I'm not sure whether that's a general rule. What one can do is look for a sequence of normal subgroups in such a way that the index of each one in its supergroup is a prime number. In the given example, there is exactly one such sequence which ends up at the trivial group. Not sure whether that's a general rule either, and if not, whether it would be worthwhile to try different sequences. If I understand the GAP code in `local/gap/latest/lib/grpperm.gi` correctly, its `DerivedSubgroup` method makes that choice greedily, without a graph search. So if it really is the derived series we want, then we might have a closer look at that as well, or simply call GAP as I did in my first attempt.

Here is what I currently use in my experiments, to be on the safe side:

```
def findRadicalSeries(t, collect=None):
    g = t[0]
    n = t[1]
    for s in g.galoissubgroups():
        if g.galoisisnormal(s):
            m = ZZ(prod(s[1]))
            k = n // m
            if is_prime(k):
                t2 = (s, m, t)
                if m != 1:
                    r = findRadicalSeries(t2, collect)
                    if r is not None and collect is None:
                        return r
                else:
                    r = []
                    while t2 is not None:
                        r.append(t2[:2])
                        t2 = t2[2]
                if collect is None:
                    return r
                else:
                    collect.append(r)
    return collect
rs = findRadicalSeries((gal, ZZ(prod(gal[7])), None))
```

I'm currently experimenting with the sequence that found. And just caused yet another crash, this time somewhere in the symbolic expressions engine. Investigating…

    "body": "<a id='comment:11'></a>\nI still have trouble figuring out what element we should adjoin. One option ([Lagrange resolvent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resolvent_%28Galois_theory%29#Terminology)?) would apparently be sum(x<sub>i</sub>z<sup>i</sup> for in in range(n))<sup>n</sup> where the x<sub>i</sub> are the roots of the polynomial and z would be a primitive n-th root of unity. For that we'd need to know the roots and the cyclic order for them. It's easy to compute the roots in Sage but they don't come with the cyclic structure. On the other hand, PARI computes the roots and gives the automorphisms in terms of these, but its roots are modulo p<sup>e</sup>, so they contain more information than GF(p) but I don't know how to match them to the algebraic roots in Sage, or how to perform a computation on them and turn the result into a number field element.

I still have trouble figuring out what element we should adjoin. One option ([Lagrange resolvent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resolvent_%28Galois_theory%29#Terminology)?) would apparently be sum(x<sub>i</sub>z<sup>i</sup> for in in range(n))<sup>n</sup> where the x<sub>i</sub> are the roots of the polynomial and z would be a primitive n-th root of unity. For that we'd need to know the roots and the cyclic order for them. It's easy to compute the roots in Sage but they don't come with the cyclic structure. On the other hand, PARI computes the roots and gives the automorphisms in terms of these, but its roots are modulo p<sup>e</sup>, so they contain more information than GF(p) but I don't know how to match them to the algebraic roots in Sage, or how to perform a computation on them and turn the result into a number field element. I'm still not sure how to do the recusrion once this is resolved, but at the moment, I'm really wondering whether any of you knows how to match these roots.

Alternative approaches to [compute this resolvent from the coefficients  of the polynomial](http://math.stackexchange.com/q/1077722/35416) look very ugly for order 4 and I know of no feasible approach for higher orders.
