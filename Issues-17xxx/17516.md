Given a polynomial from ℚ[X], we need a better way to express its roots using radical expressions if such an expression is possible.

The current approach, as used by e.g. `NumberFieldElement._symbolic_` (and after #14239 gets merged probably `AlgebraicNumber_base.radical_expression` instead), delegates this task to the `solve` method for expressions from the symbolic ring. That in turn will delegate to Maxima. But Maxima is not able to find a radical expression in all cases where they do exist:

```
sage: p = x^6-300*x^5+30361*x^4-1061610*x^3+1141893*x^2-915320*x+101724
sage: p.solve(x, explicit_solutions=True)
[]
sage: r = 1/8*((sqrt(4*(1/9*sqrt(109)*sqrt(3) + 2)^(1/3) - 4/3/(1/9*sqrt(109)*sqrt(3) + 2)^(1/3) + 17) + 5)^2 + 4)*(sqrt(4*(1/9*sqrt(109)*sqrt(3) + 2)^(1/3) - 4/3/(1/9*sqrt(109)*sqrt(3) + 2)^(1/3) + 17) + 5)
sage: r.minpoly() == QQ[x](p)
True
```

In [#14239 comment:77](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/14239#comment:77) Jeroen Demeyer stated that a proper solution here would use Galois Theory, and that we might be able to leverage PARI for this. So the goal of this ticket here is a function or method which constructs radical expressions for the roots of all polynomials where PARI can compute the Galois group of the splitting field (perhaps with a bound on the degree just to limit the running time of the algorithm).

Depends on #14239

I still have to figure out how to turn that derived series into a radical expression. I hope you don't mind me posting thoughts along the way.

I don't think need you need to convert the group to Sage, I would use `galoisfixfield()` from PARI. The tricky part will be adding the roots of unity, you need to add them manually.

Passing which subgroup as an argument? I guess I should iterate over all normal subgroups, using `galoissubgroups` and `galoisisnormal`, which aren't available in Sage at the moment. #17519 should fix that.

I just started reading the chapter “How to solve a solvable equation” in the book [Classical Galois Theory](http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=isbn:082840268X) by Lisl Gaal. That sounds very promising, since it apparently concentrates on the algorithm, not the theorem.

I think it suffices to take the information from `galoisinit().gen` and `galoisinit().orders`, but I haven't checked the details.

Current experiments seem to indicate that `gal.galoisfixfield(gal[6][:-1])` might be enough. At least for the given example. But I'm not sure whether that's a general rule. What one can do is look for a sequence of normal subgroups in such a way that the index of each one in its supergroup is a prime number. In the given example, there is exactly one such sequence which ends up at the trivial group. Not sure whether that's a general rule either, and if not, whether it would be worthwhile to try different sequences. If I understand the GAP code in `local/gap/latest/lib/grpperm.gi` correctly, its `DerivedSubgroup` method makes that choice greedily, without a graph search. So if it really is the derived series we want, then we might have a closer look at that as well, or simply call GAP as I did in my first attempt.

Here is what I currently use in my experiments, to be on the safe side:

```
def findRadicalSeries(t, collect=None):
    g = t[0]
    n = t[1]
    for s in g.galoissubgroups():
        if g.galoisisnormal(s):
            m = ZZ(prod(s[1]))
            k = n // m
            if is_prime(k):
                t2 = (s, m, t)
                if m != 1:
                    r = findRadicalSeries(t2, collect)
                    if r is not None and collect is None:
                        return r
                else:
                    r = []
                    while t2 is not None:
                        r.append(t2[:2])
                        t2 = t2[2]
                if collect is None:
                    return r
                else:
                    collect.append(r)
    return collect
rs = findRadicalSeries((gal, ZZ(prod(gal[7])), None))
```

I'm currently experimenting with the sequence that found. And just caused yet another crash, this time somewhere in the symbolic expressions engine. Investigating…

If you apply this recursively (going from the given field to a subfield and then recursing), sure.
