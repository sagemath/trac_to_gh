There are quite a few such games out there in the literature that would be assumed as 'standard'.

Everything is well tested and documented (we think) but let us know (or indeed let us know if you can think of any games that we're missing).

<a id='comment:8'></a>> Many of these are very standard in the literature. There should be normative references, whether to an undergraduate text like Straffin or to some other source, such as RAND corp. whitepapers or whatever.


Cool, will add references throughout (see later comments).

> Many of these games will have many different "versions" in the literature - for instance, your numbers for PD are quite unorthodox, as they are positive :-) 


Very help to change it, perhaps once I go through and grab references for each I'll just go with on of the many possible ones (if you are particularly against this one I'll make sure I pick a different one).

> Maybe there should be way to specify the actual numbers for each, as they have a standard form in some sense (one could check for these).


So would your idea for the PD for example, be to have a default standard (as mentioned above) but that one could pass a set of arguments? 

So for example one could pass the RSTP values (see 'Canonical PD payoff matrix' here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma). I suppose the thing with the PD is that RSTP notation is pretty common and conventional, in all honesty I am not sure they are for some of the others but will investigate.

Each game could have an initialisation test that checks if the values obey the defining inequalities. Let me know if that was what you're thinking and I'll go ahead and get working on it :)

Yeah, not at all against this idea (RSTP is certainly very common and used).

I'd suggest this be a further ticket as it could actually be something that is added to the normal form game class so that we could for example (a much simpler 'type') just be able to check if any game is symmetric.

<a id='comment:13'></a>Hi Karl.

I'm pushing the latest set of work I've done on this. I still need to get more references. I am currently at Sage Days 64 so that will have to wait till I get back to my text books in Cardiff but thought I'd push this as it is as I've parametrised a variety of games.

One important change is the ability to create a generic `Coordination` and `Anti Coordination` game so that the Battle of the Sexes for example is a particular case of the first. 

Let me know what you think (but aware that I need to throw more references in).

<a id='comment:19'></a>> A quick read-through says great and thorough work. There are a few typos and I will want to check my sources as well to make sure we are agreeing on the standard definitions for some of the games (and I may not be able to do that for some time given my current duties) but in general this will be a great resource and I wish I were teaching game theory so I could! 


That's great: thanks. Apologies for the typos and no rush: I understand how busy we all are :)
I expect you will have some references that give differing parameters. If so just let us know and we'll tweak and include your reference text also.

We have coded this as a particular type of anti-coordination game so it is in some aspects already parametrized. Let me know what you think...

> Oh, and I am agnostic on where the tab-completion happens, but since game_theory covers more than non-cooperative game theory I wonder about that - maybe game_theory.normal_form_games.[tab], though that is cumbersome-ish (only -ish because of tab-completion in the first place).

Then better to plan for the future, eh?

Minor, many very minor points because I have nothing else to complain about:
* `an often used v` -> `An often used v`
* `There is a single Nash equilibria` -> `There is a single Nash equilibrium`
* There are several other instances of this, I believe, e.g.

```
+    A coordination game is a particular type of game where the pure Nash
+    equilibria
```
  so please be careful on the plural/singular here.
* `if the defining inequality is not` -> `if the defining inequalities are not`
* I think most of the things like

```
Return a Battle of the Sexes game
```
  should be

```
Return a Battle of the Sexes game.
```
* `Chicken: Anti coordination game: Normal Form Game` seems not to jive with the usual `Battle of the sexes - Coordination game: Normal Form Game` format.  I don't know that I like either but I understand the dilemma here.

Cool, have changed this so that there is an extra inequality that makes the Game
of Chicken a particular type of Anti Coordination game.

Yup: have changed this so that the behaviour is now:

```
normal_form_games.Chicken()
```

So you simply type `normal_form_games.` and tab completion brings up all the
names normal form games. I'm not sure if this is the best way: what do you
think? I tried to get `game_theory.normal_form_games` to work but could not
actually get that to work...

I have changed things so that the colon `:` is only used prior to the utilities
but otherwise the `-` is used to seperate different names. So for example:

```
Battle of the sexes - Coordination game - Normal Form Game with the following utilities: {(0, 1): [1, 1], (1, 0): [0, 0], (0, 0): [3, 2], (1, 1): [2, 3]}
```

I think I prefer this but let me know.

What I meant was that the strategies might not be called the same/different
thing but that they would be equivalent to the same/different thing. I've
removed this in both places in case that's more clear.

> * The numbers for `HawkDove` and `Pigs` seem somewhat arbitrary.  Maybe they could at least be scaled (optionally)?  What do you think?


I have completely parametrized `HawkDove`, let me know what you think :)

As far as scaling `Pigs`, certainly could do this but the equilibrium would be
the same so I'm not sure it's really worth doing. If you would really like it to
be done though just let me know (it just seems a bit artificial to me as the
equilibria is in pure strategies).

> * `like a Hawk of a Dove.` -> `like a Hawk or a Dove.`


Done.

I have added more explanation and changed the game to go with that blog post. As
the blog post refers to the same book I have not referenced it but am not sure
if that's appropriate.

<a id='comment:43'></a>Looks good from a git standpoint. I'd also change `:math:`x + y`` to simply ``x + y`` and `.. math::` to `.. MATH::`.

You'll also note that because these are imported in the catalog:

```
from sage.game_theory.normal_form_game import NormalFormGame
from sage.matrix.constructor import matrix
from sage.functions.generalized import sign

I believe they appear under tab completion. To fix this, I'd add a

```
del matrix
del sign

I believe you're also importing at startup a good part of the game theory with the catalog. I'd change the import in `all.py` to

```
lazy_import('sage.game_theory', 'catalog', 'game_theory')

Cool :)

Thanks for this! :)

Just when I thought I had figured out making documentation happy :) It compiled and actually looked just fine (I think): thanks for fixing it though :)

I've added one commit which is to add Travis to the authors list? Not sure if that's the right thing to do or not but don't want to not acknowledge anyone... I suppose in a way it could be nice to add reviewers also (as reviewers) although perhaps I'm just worrying too much about making sure everyone gets credit (your help and effort is hugely appreciated Karl).

<a id='comment:67'></a>Thanks Travis, I remember this being a pain with matching games :)

I have fixed this: tests pass on two different machines but it is possible that I've missed one BUT I did not go with your suggestion.

I have thrown in:

```
Travellers dilemma - Normal Form Game with the following utilities: ...
```

but then I also built the expected dictionary and just checked that the equality test between the game and the dictionary returned `True`

Using `sorted(g)` would only return the keys of the dictionary which could potentially hide an error... 

I think this is probably the best way to do this but please let me know if you think it should be reworked...

Do you mean the multilines? That's mainly to stick with the 79 character limit, I noticed this for the larger games and then thought I should do it throughout. I agree that it looks pretty bad. I'm happy to leave as is (so that it fits with the 79 characters strictly) but perhaps the rule could be broken for some of the smaller dicts?

> You may also want to (briefly) mention somewhere convenient why you're doing this, or perhaps just where the utility dictionary is `==` to the game, which I wasn't expecting (since it's not a game, just a random dictionary) but is fine, as far as I care about it.


So perhaps mention something a long the lines of:

```
sage: # Building a dictionary to test the required result
sage: # The order of the dictionary might differ on a given machine
sage: d = {...
sage: d == g
```

Let me know if that's what you mean?

Thanks again for your time with this Karl.

Oh, not even that much - maybe just before the very first instance of this, preferably not within a specific function but at the module level, something like 

```
We can construct a game::

    sage: construct a game
    sage: do something with it

When we test whether the game is actually the one in question, sometimes we will build a dictionary to test it, since this can be platform-dependent, like so::

    sage: d = {...
    sage: d == g
    True
```
And then the others are tacit.

<a id='comment:77'></a>Sorry for not responding sooner, I've been busy moving out of my house and having to choose my time (and the past 17 hours, been traveling from SF to Korea). Here are my thoughts, not that they really count for much.

I try and keep to the 80 char/line limit, and what Vince did initially is the "best" practice according to PEP8. However, I side with Karl-Dieter on this in that it just looks ugly and it's worth it to consolidate the data and go past 80 char/line limit when it is easier to read.

However I do have an issue with this sentence:

```diff
+When we test whether the game is actually the one in question, sometimes we will
+build a dictionary to test it, since this can be platform-dependent, like so::
```
What is "this"? In particular, when I first read this, to me it seemed like the actual output could be different on different machines, whereas it is only the print representation of the dictionary used to model the game. Your change doesn't have to be as verbose as that (IMO), just change "this" to "the printed representation" or something like that.

Once you make that change, you can set this back to positive review on my behalf.
