> I dislike


```
 fn = open(filename, 'wb') # check filename
 fn.close()
 
 cdef FILE *out = fopen(filename, 'wb')
 
 gdImagePng(im, out)
 
 fclose(out)
```
> You can open the file using Python and access its FILE* with ​PyFile_AsFile.


Out of curiosity, is this just a Python module now instead of a separate thing?

Robert replied that my suggestion wouldn't work in Python 3, so it's not good either. But still, I dislike

```
fn = open(filename, 'wb') # check filename
fn.close()

cdef FILE *out = fopen(filename, 'wb')
```
It would better be

```
cdef FILE *out = fopen(filename, 'wb')
if not FILE:
   raise ...
```

> Out of curiosity, is this just a Python module now instead of a separate thing?

I don't understand this question.

I was just curious why this was no longer necessary - apparently `gd` is still used, but directly now, I guess.  Why did we use `gdmodule` in the first place?
