If you try to save ipython notebooks as pdf, you'll get the following error

```
$ sage -ipython nbconvert Untitled.ipynb --to pdf
[...]
  File "/home/vbraun/Code/sage.git/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/IPython/nbconvert/exporters/../templates/latex/skeleton/null.tplx", line 34, in block "any_cell"

    ((( add_prompt(cell.source | highlight_code(strip_verbatim=True), cell, 'In ', 'incolor') )))
UndefinedError: 'add_prompt' is undefined
```
Workaround is `sage -pip install --upgrade jinja2`

New vanilla tarball is already on the Sage mirror.
