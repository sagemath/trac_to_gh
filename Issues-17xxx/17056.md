There are two bugs with WordDatatype_char (new datastructure for words introduced in #17013):
- in `__dealloc__` we access a Python attribute... it is very bad since Cython is such that they are deallocated before the call to `__dealloc__`. In different situations sage terminates because of a memory corruption
- in `__getitem__` we had

  ```
  sage: W = Words([0,1,2])
  sage: w = W([0,1,0])
  sage: w[1:0]
  word: ... <RANDOM STUFF> ...
  ```

With #17013, I can not reproduce the second problem:

```
sage: W = Words([0,1,2])
sage: w = W([0,1,0])
sage: w[:0]
word:
```

Also, can you provide an example so that I can reproduce the first problem?

Hello,

Sorry, I was wrong it is `w[1:0]` which is bad.

For the problem with `__dealloc__`, you must be lucky to see it (as it depends on the choice of Python for the deallocation of objects). Try

```
sage: W = Words([0,1,2])
sage: w = W([randint(0,2) for _ in range(100)])
sage: u = w[10:-10]
sage: c = [u.number_of_factors(n) for n in range(20)]
sage: quit
<BOOM>
```

Vincent
