It's that time of the year again.

Reasons to upgrade remain the same : ability to communicate with R core developpers, without getting the "upgrade to current version" cold shoulder.

Original tarball : http://cran.univ-paris1.fr/src/base/R-3/R-3.1.2.tar.gz

Modified (renamed) source tarball : https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1gfn4_V_wm3bUNVTS1LTVBrSG8/view?usp=sharing (sorry not to have a publicly accessible directory...).
