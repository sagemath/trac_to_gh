The `divisors` method of `Integer` is implemented using `long long` if possible. However, it would be better to use `unsigned long` for this. One advantage is that we no longer need the `mpz_set_longlong()` functions from `c_lib`. This will also be faster for small inputs on 32-bit systems. On 64-bit systems, there should be no speed difference (except perhaps a small speed-up due to skipping the `mpz_longlong` overhead and the fact that we use 64 instead of 63 bits).

I know it would be less of an issue if other gmp using code had moved to using mpir directly one way or another (flint being the only one) rather than just saying "you can do that if mpir is installed with gmp-compat". I think I can do an ugly hack for that one.

Because c_lib, pari, ntl and friends are still linked to gmp I have linking to both gmp and mpir when inspecting with ldd, but readelf on the extension will only show mpir since it is the only one it is directly linked against.

Changing the headers in sage/libs/gmp wasn't enough in that it spread symbol problems in other places. 

Now to run full doctest on the monster.
