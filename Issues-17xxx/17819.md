The `divisors` method of `Integer` is implemented using `long long` if possible. However, it would be better to use `unsigned long` for this. One advantage is that we no longer need the `mpz_set_longlong()` functions from `c_lib`. This will also be faster for small inputs on 32-bit systems. On 64-bit systems, there should be no speed difference (except perhaps a small speed-up due to skipping the `mpz_longlong` overhead and the fact that we use 64 instead of 63 bits).

Well that would force the hand. 

What I mean is take pari. You can compile it with mpir by using the gmp compatibility layer. You cannot tell pari to compile directly against mpir, using mpir headers and libmpir. 

If all the packages in the sage stack could do that. It would be easy, install mpir and build everything against it. Reality is everything apart from flint is using gmp and expect gmp. And only use mpir if it is masquerading itself as gmp. 

In a distro where gmp is already installed because of gcc it won't happen unless you can convince the toolchain team of the distro to switch to mpir. Tough job.

I guess that would be handy but what happens on 32 bits systems? We are still dealing with them for the foreseeable future.

I am trying a hack where integer.pyx and mpz.pxd explicitly use mpir. But not anything else.

I am guessing if mpir is a complete superset of gmp I could switch the whole sage library to explicit mpir. A bit of linking madness but it would work.

When using `unsigned long`, stuff would become slower for 32-bit systems. It's really a matter of what do you prefer? It's a classical pick 2 out of 3: clean code, fast code, portable code.
