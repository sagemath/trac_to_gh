Saving and loading variables apparently doesn't reload the `latex_name` attribute:

It looks as if it tries to keep these objects unique, and `load()` will leave an existing variable's `latex_name` in place, but won't set it when creating a variable.

I can see arguments for and against considering `SR.symbol('x', latex_name='y')` a different variable from `SR.symbol('x')`.  It seems reasonable to consider them the same, in which case the latex name should be discarded if there's already a variable of the same name.  But it should use the saved latex name when loading a variable that isn't already defined.

Seems possibly related: #5466

Update: I think this report, [posted to sage-support today](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-support/pZ4rCvBYtTY/b_KTxC-6BIoJ), is the same issue:

According to the sage-support thread in question, perhaps the more recent bug is different

The problem above is caused by sage reusing 
"already existing variables" in the symbol function 
in sage/symbolic/ring.pyx. This "fixes" the above bug:
