Leading zeros in the input are not currently handled properly in `Necklaces`.  This was already corrected in `LyndonWords` in #12997 which calls the code in necklace.py and removes leading zeros.

The documentation in necklace.py should also be cleaned up to current standards and some small trivial speedups done.

There seem to be minor bugs that one would not necessarily pick up on except by reading the code closely.  For example:

```
sage: Necklaces([1,0,1]).list()[0]
[1, 3]
sage: Necklaces([1,1]).list()[0] in Necklaces([1,1])
True
sage: Necklaces([1,0,1]).list()[0] in Necklaces([1,0,1])
False
```
The reason is that implicitly the code is assuming that there are no zeros in the content/evaluation vector and it checks if the value of the entries in the necklace smaller or equal to the size of the necklace.  If that check fails it returns False.
