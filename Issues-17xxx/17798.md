This is a partial step towards #16126, but carries the necessary information to speed up #16630 when the input is given as a finite !Cartan/Coxeter type.

It is possible to input numbers c<= -1 in the matrix to represent an infinite label, but with a different value in the bilinear form of the Tits representation.

The current implementation recognizes finite and affine types

Possible follow-up:
-create an abstract class for Coxeter matrices and Cartan matrices?
-Maybe change the name of CoxeterType.py could to type_coxeter.py
-Recognize more types

Here's a working version that implements a class `CoxeterMatrix` and a generic `CoxeterType` coming from a `CartanType`. I also removed some deprecated code.

<a id='comment:8'></a>
In view of the tickets #15703, #16126, tt would be very good to include the possibility to have "generalized" Coxeter matrices.

The "generalized" means that for the infinite labels, we can put a real number <= -1 in the matrix.

Of course, this may be not so natural to have Coxeter matrices with such entries, but this will make life much much easier for the other tickets: being able to start with a matrix which encodes the "geometry" behind the matrix.

Ticket #16126 should be kind of parallel to this one.

If you think it is a good idea, I would try take the patch from here and make it possible to into such values.

This is a dirty version so that you may have a look.

It includes now a classification of the affine types. I do not know exactly if this recognition algorithm was coded before. Anyways, I wrote it, it was a good exercise.

Hi,

While having a look at the diff of the current patch, I saw that in CoxeterMatrixGroup the method coxeter_graph is renamed by coxeter_diagram.

I'm having thoughts about this for a while.

I would be tempted to have a clear distinction between dynkin diagram and coxeter graphs. Especially considering #16126 coming.

I guess eventually, there could be a common class on top of dynkin diagrams and coxeter graphs from which they inherit. But right now, it makes more sense to me to try to keep the convention coxeter graph vs dynkin diagram.

What do you think?

Yes... It is a bummer that Coxeter does have a graph with its actual name tagged to it!

As far as I know, Humphreys is careful not to give the graphs a name. On p.1 of Bjoerner&Brenti, they call it a "Coxeter graph (or Coxeter diagram)".

I think that the Coxeter graph is not so commonly used as to need it directly from the sage prompt, right?

Hi,

So I pushed some commits I did today.

There is still a lot to do, but it's progressing.

I tested the files and there were many tests that failed. I noticed that many of them fail because we removed the inheritance from matrices that was providing with equality tests.

I continue the coding... Don't hesitated if you have comments or suggestions!

Hi,

Now all test passes on the file coxeter_matrix, not on coxeter_type (3 failure caused by the old UCF implementation, I did not bother trying to correct them because of the new implementation in #18152). When it is going to be merged in a beta, I'll verify again.

The sample is supposed to contain all finite and affine coxeter types plus some more infinite types which are not affine.

I believe now the next step would be to go through the methods to double check that tests verify well the code.

About the renaming of the CoxeterType file to type_coxeter, I believe it is better to keep it as it is now since it is similar to cartan_type.py

<a id='comment:48'></a>
So the problem is that the type recognition does not support relabelings:

```
sage: M = CoxeterMatrix([[1,3,2],[3,1,6],[2,6,1]])
sage: M
[1 3 2]
[3 1 6]
[2 6 1]
sage: M.coxeter_type()
Coxeter type of ['G', 2, 1]
sage: loads(dumps(M))
[1 2 3]
[2 1 6]
[3 6 1]
```
The type should be relabeled to (1, 2, 3) and does not necessarily correspond to (0, 1, 2).

It seems that there was an error when building sage.

I looked at the crash report and there is an ImportError:

"ImportError: No module named inherit_comparison"

Which seems to be the source of the problem.

Any idea?

Travis is working on the issue with crystals now.

The tests that are failing in `cluster_seed.py` are under `universal_extension()`, which mentions that it gets the almost positive co-roots in a non-elegant way and non-standard order, so it may have to be rewritten.

I would say 1-based for finite type since they probably have a labeling hardcoded when dealing with them through Cartan matrices and Coxeter Types.

I would say 0-based whenever there is no labels specified and it comes through a CoxeterMatrix type, eventhough the type is finite.

But this probably causes trouble?

In a sense, having a "relabel" method somehow means that we have a canonical way of doing and then whenever it is not that one, it means that it was relabeled.

Does that make sense?

One of the trivial doctest failures because of `subtype` actually was the one indicating the problem, but that was because I wasn't passing the indexing set as I should have been. We should check for `CoxeterMatrix` and `CoxeterType` that labelings work as they should.

I was talking about when no labels are given, and it sounds like we are in agreement. However there is some code that doesn't use the indexing set, but instead a range under the assumption that the indexing set is `(1, 2, ..., n)`. I'm still partially debating whether or not to change the cluster seed code as well to help make it robust (although it is somewhat moot because we now specify the indexing set).

In short, it causes trouble for people's code that had made an assumption about the indexing set before.

Yes it makes sense. In a way, I agree with you. However, we must define a canonical way of labeling in order to implement the database of Cartan types. Also we can relabel relabeled types.

For whatever it's worth, the strategy I followed in the root system
code was to never make any assumption on the indexing set `I`.

For Cartan matrices, the situation is similar with that of matrices of
module morphisms. Ideally they would be indexed by I; however we don't
really have yet a good matrix class supporting arbitrary indexing (or
do we? Panda's DataFrame class [1] could be an interesting starting
point!). That's in particular why I avoided using the Cartan matrix as
much as possible in computations, preferring instead the Dynkin
diagram.

Until we have a class for matrices with arbitrary indexing, I believe
we should stick to what has been done so far: index the matrix by
`0,...,|I|-1` with row/column i corresponding to the i-th element of
the indexing set `I` (following Python's convention: i=0 gives the
first element).

Cheers,

It is because we have an extra module (the one for Coxeter matices) that gets imported when Sage starts. This is there as a very mild warning to try to not increase statup time, but it's somewhat of a necessary (very small) evil for us to do here.

Replying to [jipilab](#comment%3A81): 
> Now, what is this startup module error in the patchbot??


It is because the new imports in the sage namespaces done in the file `# file /src/sage/combinat/root_system/all.py` :

```
from coxeter_matrix import CoxeterMatrix
from coxeter_type import CoxeterType
```

which automatically loads all this from `src/sage/combinat/root_system/coxeter_matrix.py` file:

```
+from sage.misc.cachefunc import cached_method
+from sage.matrix.constructor import matrix
+from sage.matrix.matrix_space import MatrixSpace
+from sage.misc.classcall_metaclass import ClasscallMetaclass, typecall
+from sage.matrix.matrix_generic_dense import Matrix_generic_dense
+from sage.graphs.graph import Graph
+from sage.rings.all import ZZ, QQ, RR
+from sage.rings.infinity import infinity
+from sage.combinat.root_system.cartan_type import CartanType
+from sage.combinat.root_system.coxeter_type import CoxeterType
```

and this from `src/sage/combinat/root_system/coxeter_type.py` file:

```
+from sage.misc.abstract_method import abstract_method
+from sage.misc.cachefunc import cached_method
+from sage.misc.classcall_metaclass import ClasscallMetaclass
+from sage.combinat.root_system.cartan_type import CartanType
+from sage.matrix.all import MatrixSpace
+from sage.symbolic.ring import SR
+from sage.structure.unique_representation import UniqueRepresentation
+from sage.structure.sage_object import SageObject
```

which explains why the patchbot was saying that Sage now takes 6 seconds instead of 5 to start. You may think about the following questions:

- Do all of these imports really need to be done at the top level of those two modules?
- Do you really need to import `CoxeterMatrix` and `CoxeterType` in the Sage namespace? I mean, it is usefull for you, for me. But, maybe that 99% of people will not use those two things while using Sage. So I think you do not have to import them in the global Sage namespace.

Anyhow, since this ticket is closed, this discussion should be moved to another ticket if it is worthwhile to continue that discussion.

You are not being fair. All of those are already imported, so they contribute so marginally to startup time that they are essentially non-existent. This can be seen by the startup time plugin which says there *might* have been a 1.6 millisecond increase in startup time out of 2.6 second average startup.

Also, how many things in the Sage namespace are really useful to most users of Sage? Most of the things that are there are not useful to 99% of the users. So let's advocate removing them from the global namespace, and then nothing except basic calculus will be easily discoverable.

I agree that we do need to be somewhat careful about startup time. However to do that, we need better resolution of lazy imports and large chunks of combinat to be changed to be lazily imported (see #15293). But let us keep this in perspective.
