This doctest tests against a wrong result, the resulting curve must have a quadratic part:

```
            sage: f = piecewise([[(-1,1),1]])                             ## example 2
            sage: g = piecewise([[(0,3),x]])
            sage: f.convolution(g)
            Piecewise defined function with 3 parts, [[(-1, 1), 0], [(1, 2), -3/2*x], [(2, 4), -3/2*x]]
```
From numerical investigation it seems the solution would be `piecewise(x|-->1/2*x^2 + x + 1/2 on (-1/2, 1), x|-->2*x on (1, 2), x|-->-1/2*x^2 + x + 4 on (2, 7/2); x)`.

This works in the new `piecewise` from #14801. 


The ticket is for documentary reasons because a new piecewise code is being worked on in #14801.
