When having a file `long-doctest-bug.py` with a function

```
def f(t):
    """
    TESTS::

        sage: f(2)
        sage: f(3)  # long time
        sage: [f(4),
        ....: ]  # long time
        sage: [f(5),  # long time
        ....: ]
        
    """
    print "sleep", t
    sleep(t)
```
and doctesting it with `sage -t long-doctest-bug.py`, the line containing `f(4)` is tested as well:

```
Running doctests with ID 2014-11-26-16-34-55-f22cca2c.
Doctesting 1 file.
sage -t long-doctest-bug.py

    [None]
**********************************************************************
1 item had failures:
   2 of   3 in long-doctest-bug.f
    [2 tests, 2 failures, 6.01 s]

sage -t long-doctest-bug.py  # 2 doctests failed
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Total time for all tests: 6.0 seconds
    cpu time: 0.0 seconds
    cumulative wall time: 6.0 seconds
```

Anyhow, note that it works when `# long time` is put at the end of the first line, which can look weird.

Feature, not a bug.

Requiring doctest tags to be on the first line makes them much easier to see.

Ok. It's now an enhancement...

> Requiring doctest tags to be on the first line makes them much easier to see.

I'm not happy with this. Comments within one code statement can be confusing.
IMHO both should work, i.e., putting "# long time" in the first line as well as in the last line (or even in any line at the end).

This would also support the following: When writing doctests I often start with a one-liner. Then later, when it works, I'll rewrite it to multiple lines. The current behavior means, I have to change where the comment is.
The reverse situation also happens: You have a multi-line doctest, but then you change it and suddenly it fits into one line. Thus, you now have to move the "# long time" from somewhere in betweeb to the end of the line.
