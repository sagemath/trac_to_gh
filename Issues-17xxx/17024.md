#14880 implemented the p-adic gamma function and Dwork expanison, but it seems that this was lost in the template rewrite #12555. Or maybe in the fog of war of the git transition. In any case, here it is again.

The `"sage"` algorithm doesn't work as well as `"pari"`:

```
sage: Zp(2)(1).gamma("sage")
1 + 2 + 2^2 + 2^3 + 2^4 + 2^5 + 2^6 + 2^7 + 2^8 + 2^9 + 2^10 + 2^11 + 2^12 + 2^13 + 2^14 + 2^15 + 2^16 + 2^17 + 2^18 + O(2^19)
```
(precision only 19 instead of 20)

```
sage: ZpFM(17).random_element().gamma("sage")
...
ValueError: cannot invert non-unit
```
(`"sage"` algorithm doesn't work for `ZpFM`)

But since it's not the default, I'll let it be.
