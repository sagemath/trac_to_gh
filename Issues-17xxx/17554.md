Univariate Laurent polynomials behave very differently with `__call__` compared to other polynomials. In particular, the following does not (correctly) work:

```
sage: R.<t> = LaurentPolynomialRing(ZZ)
sage: f = t^(-2) + t^2
sage: f(t=-1)  # Boom
sage: f(x=-1)  # Boom
sage: f()  # Boom
sage: f(1,2)  # Should be an error
2
```

The original symptom (which has been fixed by other means, see [comment:3](#comment%3A3)) came from

```
sage: R.<q> = QQ[]
sage: p = q^4 + q^2 - 2*q + 3
sage: L.<x,y> = LaurentPolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: p(q=x)
x^4 + x^2 - 2*x + 3
```
but if we change things to a univariate Laurent polynomial ring, we get:

```
sage: L.<x> = LaurentPolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: p(q=x)
...
IndexError: tuple index out of range
```

The following seems to be the issue

```
sage: p() #evaluating with no arguments should probably be a no-op
q^4 + q^2 - 2*q + 3
sage: x() #but it raises an error for laurent polynomials
IndexError: tuple index out of range
```
The problem gets triggered by `sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_element.Polynomial.__call__`, which for keyword arguments does:

```
          P = self.parent()
            name = P.variable_name()
            if name in kwds:
                if len(x) > 0:
                    raise ValueError("must not specify both a keyword and positional argument")
                a = self(kwds[name])
                del kwds[name]
                try:
                    return a(**kwds)
                except TypeError:
                    return a
```
The command `return a(**kwds)` fails, because it's effectively `a(*(),**{})`. Furthermore, it fails with an `IndexError` which doesn't get caught.

The better solution is probably to amend laurentpolynomial's `__call__` to do the right thing. Presently, it doesn't support keyword arguments at all and it expects non-empty arguments. Its implementation is

```
    def __call__(self, *x):
        if isinstance(x[0], tuple):
            x = x[0]
        return self.__u(x) * (x[0]**self.__n)
```
which expects there is at least one argument and doesn't handle keyword arguments.

However, there are still serious issues with `__call__` that I am recycling this ticket for (sorry it completely fell off my radar). The attached branch makes the behavior standard with the rest of polynomials Sage (with some mild cleanup of the multivariate `__call__`).
