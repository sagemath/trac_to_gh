```
Univariate Laurent polynomials behave very differently with `__call__` compared to other polynomials. In particular, the following does not (correctly) work:

```
sage: R.<t> = LaurentPolynomialRing(ZZ)
sage: f = t^(-2) + t^2
sage: f(t=-1)  # Boom
sage: f(x=-1)  # Boom
sage: f()  # Boom
sage: f(1,2)  # Should be an error
2
```

The original symptom (which has been fixed by other means, see [comment:3](#comment:3)) came from

```
sage: R.<q> = QQ[]
sage: p = q^4 + q^2 - 2*q + 3
sage: L.<x,y> = LaurentPolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: p(q=x)
x^4 + x^2 - 2*x + 3
```
but if we change things to a univariate Laurent polynomial ring, we get:

```
sage: L.<x> = LaurentPolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: p(q=x)
...
IndexError: tuple index out of range
```

<div id="comment:2" align="right">comment:2</div>

The following seems to be the issue

```
sage: p() #evaluating with no arguments should probably be a no-op
q^4 + q^2 - 2*q + 3
sage: x() #but it raises an error for laurent polynomials
IndexError: tuple index out of range
```
The problem gets triggered by `sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_element.Polynomial.__call__`, which for keyword arguments does:

```
          P = self.parent()
            name = P.variable_name()
            if name in kwds:
                if len(x) > 0:
                    raise ValueError("must not specify both a keyword and positional argument")
                a = self(kwds[name])
                del kwds[name]
                try:
                    return a(**kwds)
                except TypeError:
                    return a
```
The command `return a(**kwds)` fails, because it's effectively `a(*(),**{})`. Furthermore, it fails with an `IndexError` which doesn't get caught.

The better solution is probably to amend laurentpolynomial's `__call__` to do the right thing. Presently, it doesn't support keyword arguments at all and it expects non-empty arguments. Its implementation is

```
    def __call__(self, *x):
        if isinstance(x[0], tuple):
            x = x[0]
        return self.__u(x) * (x[0]**self.__n)
```
which expects there is at least one argument and doesn't handle keyword arguments.
