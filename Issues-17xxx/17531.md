As per http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/17489#comment:17 and http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/17489#comment:23, the ticket should improve the `BuiltinFunction` class, such that subclassed function classes that have an `algorithm=...` keyword given via function call will automatically have this keyword inserted into any `__evalf__` member function call.

This means the following should be possible without changes to `subclassedfunction.__call__`:

```
sage: from sage.symbolic.function import BuiltinFunction
sage: class MyFunction(BuiltinFunction):
....:    def __init__(self):
....:        BuiltinFunction.__init__(self, 'test', nargs=1)
....:    def _evalf_(self, x, **kwds):
....:        algorithm = kwds.get('algorithm', None)
....:        if algorithm == 'algoA':
....:            return 1.0
....:        else:
....:            return 0.0
....:    def _eval_(self, x):
....:         return self._evalf_try_(x)
sage: f = MyFunction()
sage: f(0.0, algorithm='algoA')
1.00000000000000
sage: f(0.0)
0.000000000000000
```
At the moment, as with all(?) symbolic functions we get

```
sage: f(x, algorithm='algoB')
TypeError: __call__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'algorithm'
sage: sin(x, algorithm='algoB')
TypeError: __call__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'algorithm'
```
So the ticket should also give a better error message for existing functions.

#16812 and #17489 depend on this.

```

Also, `__evalf__` should be `_evalf_`.

Actually, the `sin` function has no behaviour specified for the `algorithm` keyword and so, the outcome is undefined, meaning it could be either way. Certainly no such convention exists in the documentation. Pragmatically, it would be overkill to implement an algorithm registry for this reason.

If you so insist, please help with the following design decision. We could
* A) add a dictionary to the base class (`Function`) containing names of algorithms. The user (who writes subclasses of `Function`) may register names through subclass initialization. Unregistered names given in a `__call__` argument result in error.
* B) make available the algorithm keyword only in a specific subclass of `Function`. The user would inherit from this subclass. Other existing classes retain their previous behaviour. The user is responsible to give an error in his class for unknown algorithms.

This means that the end user cannot say `factorial(10^6, algorithm=...)` but should be able to say `f(10^6, hold=True).n(algorithm=...)`. The function creator is responsible to give an error in his class for unknown algorithms.

Granted, C does make some sense in that all numeric issues are moved into `_evalf_`, and it works around shortfalls of A or B. But the end user will hate it. With A, there is additional code (clutter) in `Function` and the subclass must register its algorithm names. With B, it's not a general `Function`-wide solution.

EDIT: C does not make sense with functions returning int or polynomials and having different algorithms, unless the meaning of `f` in `evalf` or 'numerical approximation' is stretched beyond repair.

See also #15200 where Jeroen argues for hardcoding a few backend choices.

#17489 depends on this.

I would put this

```
algorithm = kwds.get('algorithm')
if algorithm is not None and algorithm != "ginac":
    raise ValueError("unknown algorithm %r for %s"%(algorithm,self))
```
right before calling Ginac (towards the end of `Function.__call__`).

But when you do `sin(x,algorithm='foo')` the `Function.__call__` doesn't even get called (EDIT: because `BuiltinFunction.__call__` doesn't call super) so no error is thrown.
