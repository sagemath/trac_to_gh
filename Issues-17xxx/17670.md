`integer.pyx` and `real_double.pyx` use `hook_tp_functions()` to change `tp_new` and `tp_dealloc` at run-time. It seems that one cannot avoid such hacks with the current Cython, but at least we could provide a cleaner interface.

Why are you limiting the number of pools to 4? Isn't it too small?

I am not doing any dictionary lookup (except for putting the pool in the dict). I am storing the pool in the dict for 2 reasons: for debugging purposes and to ensure that some reference is kept to the pool (to prevent it from being deleted). I do not use this dict in the implementation.

I never understood the need for local pools. I thought that you stored the pool in the parent only for practical purposes.

> and then objects with different sizes


What do you mean with "objects with different sizes"?
