`integer.pyx` and `real_double.pyx` use `hook_tp_functions()` to change `tp_new` and `tp_dealloc` at run-time. It seems that one cannot avoid such hacks with the current Cython, but at least we could provide a cleaner interface.

Depends on #24111

I've just had a look at your implementation (sorry for the delay).

I saw that you stored the address of the pool in a dictionary. Did you try to estimate the time penalty of this dictionary lookup? For instance, did you compare timings between (1) your implementation and (2) the current implementation for integers?

By design, your implementation cannot allow what I've called local pools (several different pools are possible for a same type) and global pools (a unique pool is shared all by all elements having a given type). I'm a bit sad about this because I think that having different pools may really make sense (for instance for p-adics when we are dealing with many different primes p and then objects with different sizes).
But OK, I can accept this :-).

Why are you limiting the number of pools to 4? Isn't it too small?

I am not doing any dictionary lookup (except for putting the pool in the dict). I am storing the pool in the dict for 2 reasons: for debugging purposes and to ensure that some reference is kept to the pool (to prevent it from being deleted). I do not use this dict in the implementation.

> By design, your implementation cannot allow what I've called local pools (several different pools are possible for a same type) and global pools (a unique pool is shared all by all elements having a given type).

I never understood the need for local pools. I thought that you stored the pool in the parent only for practical purposes.

> and then objects with different sizes

What do you mean with "objects with different sizes"?

I resolved the merge conflicts, which were in the cython version level and `integer.pyx`, but now Sage crashes on startup.  When I ran `make build`, it surprisingly only rebuilt 4 Cython files.  Given that there are patches to Cython in this ticket, I think I might need to reinstall Cython with `sage -f cython`, but I think I'm going to work on other tickets for now rather than try to debug this.
