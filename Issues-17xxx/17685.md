As reported on [this ask question](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/25624/sagetex-hyphen-in-filename-forbidden/), the command `sage <filename>` is understood as `sage -n=...` command if `<filename>` contains `-n`. This is due to a wrong use of shell regex.

```
$ sage file-name.py
CRITICAL:root:unknown notebook: None
Error, notebook must be one of default, ipython, sagenb but got None

Yes I should have filled my bits. I know why I always had the problem on my main machine. The host name is part of the temporary file name. My machine hostname is "qcd-nzi3", automatic fail.

I think you cannot have the `"` because it would have to be matched with the rest of the expression, I could be wrong about that one.

Replying to [@videlec](#comment%3A4):
> Just by curiosity, why did you remove the `"`?

If i put a global quote `"^-n=.*"`, then everything is escaped so `^` and `.*` will not be recognized as special characters (it will recognize strings containing the substring `^-n=.*`). So i would have to do `^"-n=".*` to only escape `-n=`. Now, looking at `man 7 regex`, it seems that `=` is special only if surrounded by some bracket, and `-` is special only for intervals like `A-Z`. So, since it is not the case, we should be safe without quotes (though i usually like to put lot of quotes in bash, just to be sure), hence i thought "if something goes wrong with that apparently less safe way, then it will be good because then we could help fixing bash."

It seems that i am a bit late, i did not think the ticket will be merged so fast. Actually, even `[[` is a bashism, not only `=~`, so it is indeed a good proposition to get rid of this construction. See #17699 for a follow up.
