3 years ago a memory leak in lp solvers was fixed in ticket [11917](http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/11917). It seems that the problems are back in Sage 6.3. The code

```
while True:
    P = MixedIntegerLinearProgram(solver="Coin")
```

consumes several GB of memory within a few seconds! The same happens with solver="gurobi", but not with solver="glpk".

Simon King confirmed the leak at [sage-support](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-support/dqgmyhMIQdw/qARZHXTt2z8J), including some analysis and details.

When I try to replicate Simon's memory object analysis, I do not find a significant leak:

```
sage: import gc
sage: from collections import Counter
sage: gc.collect()
0
sage: gc.set_debug(gc.DEBUG_STATS)
sage: pre={id(a) for a in gc.get_objects()}
sage: for i in [1..100000]:
....:         P = MixedIntegerLinearProgram(solver="Coin")
....:         del P
....:     
sage: gc.collect()
gc: collecting generation 2...
gc: objects in each generation: 117 0 89955
gc: done, 0.0464s elapsed.
0
sage: gc.collect()
gc: collecting generation 2...
gc: objects in each generation: 48 0 90013
gc: done, 0.0397s elapsed.
0
sage: post=Counter(str(type(a)) for a in gc.get_objects() if id(a) not in pre)
sage: post
Counter({"<type 'method_descriptor'>": 32, "<type 'list'>": 23, "<type 'dict'>": 13, "<type 'tuple'>": 9, "<class '_ast.Name'>": 7, "<type 'weakref'>": 5, "<class '_ast.Call'>": 4, "<type 'frame'>": 2, "<type 'builtin_function_or_method'>": 2, "<type 'listiterator'>": 1, "<type 'set'>": 1, "<type 'instancemethod'>": 1, "<class '_ast.comprehension'>": 1, "<class '_ast.Compare'>": 1, "<class '_ast.Attribute'>": 1, "<class '_ast.Interactive'>": 1, "<type 'module'>": 1})
```
As you can see, the garbage collector does not get triggered during the loop (indicating that reference counting is sufficient to keep the number of python objects bounded in memory during the loop). Also, after the loop there are no alarming objects in "post".

I can confirm that memory usage explodes, but I think this indicates the memory leak is outside of python managed memory.

[The problem with Simon's code might be that he doesn't update the set `S` when he counts a new object, so there's a possibility for objects that get created on the first pass to get counted every time.]

The following is fishy in `coin_backend.pyx`:

```
    def __cinit__(self, maximization = True):
...
        self.si = new OsiClpSolverInterface()
        self.model =  new CbcModel(self.si[0])
...
    def __dealloc__(self):
        del self.si
```
If deleting `self.si` is required in dealloc, shouldn't `self.model` be deleted as well? (this indicates to me that cython has grown enough understanding of C++ to know how to translate a "del" on a C++ object?)

Indeed, I've tried and simply inserting

```
        del self.model
```
makes memory consumption constant with the given test. I haven't tested if it affects operations otherwise. Responsible ticket seems to be #12220, where `new CbcModel` was added. In that same file we have

```
    cpdef int solve(self) except -1:
...
        model = new CbcModel(si[0])
...(*)
        del self.model
        self.model = model
```
which seems to suggest that unceremoniously deleting a model is just fine.

Incidentally, that routine can leak too, because there are a whole bunch of "raise" statements in (*) that can lead to `self.model` not being replaced by model, but `model` itself not being deleted.

This suggests that the whole statement here should be guarded by some `try/except/finally` to ensure that `del model` is executed if `self.model=model` is not.

Hello !

I do not understand why you put all this in a "try" block. Wouldn't it be easier to just set `self.si` and `self.model` to NULL at the beginning, and add  "if self.model != NULL" in the dealloc ?

Hello !

Oh ? Well, last time I tried I had to setup a weird proxy and start the authentication software in that proxy jail. Because my lab was not recognised as 'research institution' and stuff. And right now I am in India for two months.

Well, I will give it a try tomorrow but I am sure that I will lose at least one hour on that `:-P`

It seems to me that only committing to the new model by assigning it to `self.model` at the very end is a design feature: it means that if the computation fails for any reason, the object `self` is unaffected and hence still in a consistent state. It's also better for future development, because as long as model is private, there is no lock required to modify it. Once it's exported to `self.model`, you'd need to lock self before `self.model` is changed. Python currently doesn't support such multiprocessing programming anyway, but having changes in global state as atomic as possible is generally a good feature, because it reduces the possibility for unexpected interactions between multiple threads (the GIL does get released every now and again ...)

With your change, the model that just experienced an error is now stored in `self`. It could be convenient to have it available for further analysis, so a priori it's not clear which design is more useful. It depends on the details of what the code does and how it does it. Changing the design just to avoid a try/finally is probably not a good idea, however.

Furthermore, there is still this code between `model` allocation and committing to `self.model=model`.

```
        model.setLogLevel(self.model.logLevel())

        # multithreading
        import multiprocessing
        model.setNumberThreads(multiprocessing.cpu_count())

        model.branchAndBound()
```
which looks like it's quite nontrivial and hence could raise errors by itself. You'd still have a leak then. So either guard that with a `try/finally`, in which case you might as well stick with the guard all the way, or move the `self.model=model` even higher.

Hello,

I wrote this file myself, and I do not think that this had the slightest importance to me at that time.

> it means that if the computation fails for any reason,

When an exception is raised in that code, it is almost always because the problem is infeasible. This is not a "failure", it is the actual answer the user is looking for.

> the object `self` is unaffected and hence still in a consistent state. It's also better for future development, because as long as model is private, there is no lock required to modify it.

If your worry is that in a multithread Python program with a MixedIntegerLinearProgram instance `p` the function `p.solve()` may be called simultaneously from different processors, I believe that you can forget it. Even if that made the sligthest sense, you would have many other places in the code to re-read and adapt.

Hello again !

Turns out that their license thing was greatly simplified since (or that I was lucky). Either way it went smoothly after I got a real internet connection.

I did the fix for Gubori, though for some reason I don't quite get why it works... I actually *removed* a call to GRBfreeenv and the memory leak seems to have disappeared. While debugging I noticed that GRBmodel returned an error code.

Well, here it is `:-)`

Why not? Did you perhaps not import the error first?

```
sage: from sage.numerical.mip import MIPSolverException
sage: try:
....:     raise MIPSolverException("Problem")
....: except MIPSolverException:
....:     print "problem caught"
....: 
problem caught

I'd say that having `MixedIntegerLinearProgram` in the global name space is not good, since most Sage users wouldn't use it. So, it is friendly to *some* users that there is no need to import it before using.

And `MIPSolverException` is a technicality that is only relevant to developers or expert users, and thus clearly shouldn't pollute the global name space.
