Hello!

I have a suggestion for a big improvement for the Graph Theoretical module of Sage. Right now I am a not in the proper mood to do it myself so I am leaving this here in case anyone is willing to do it or as a TODO note for a later time.

Consider the graph on ~10k vertices located in the file https://www.dropbox.com/s/pbtk2965ti71u9n/graph.txt.gz?dl=0 where each line contains an edge pair.

Using the standard way in Sage (read graph call automorphism_group() ) takes a few ** hours**  (I'll tell the exact time when it actually finishes) to compute and makes a ** 30GB** memory footprint.

The same thing can be done using bliss http://www.tcs.tkk.fi/Software/bliss/index.html with no actual memory footprint in **20 seconds.**

So right now its much cheaper for me to just write the graph into DIMACS format call bliss and parse its output. 

I guess the same kind of performance can be obtained using nauty so I suppose there is something OFF with the current implementation of the automorphism group method. IIRC it is written in Python?

Hopefully we can make this into a productive patch.

4. How to handle digraphs elegantly?

As is for now, the code correctly compute the aut of a graph/digraph provided that libbliss.a is in the sage lib folder and the location of the bliss header is correctly set in bliss.pyx.


I wrote that above question for the general audience but honestly,.. Nathann what do you think??

<a id='comment:4'></a>Yoooooooooooo !

Well, so far your branch does not look "that bad". The only weird thing is that I do not get why this bliss branch should do that modifications `:-P`

```diff
+    :meth:`~GenericGraph.geodetic_number` | Returns the geodetic number of the given graph.
```

The right way to write this code, however, begins as you say by writing the spkg, as nobody can test it without it. And the right way to do that, as usual is copy and paste.

1) There is a developer's manual that I am trying to improve these days. There is a section I never read about exactly that: http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/packaging.html. If you find anything wrong/unclear in there, please fix it if you can. We must make this clear to everybody. If you do not understand, tell me where it is and I will try to fix it.

2) spkgs are rather simple nowadays. The code that **installs** the program is a Sage code, like any other. You will find it in SAGE_ROOT/build/. Take a look at the structure of `buckygen`, for instance: it is an optional graph package, just like bliss will be.

3) That was for the Sage code, but the non-sage code (i.e. the source code of bliss) must be stored in the SAGE_ROOT/upstream folder. You will figure out that the code in build/ is actually instruction about what to do with the bliss-version.tar.bz2 that must be there, and which is only the official bliss release.

4) Then there are he "checksums": http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/packaging.html#checksums

So before continuing with this you should create a ticket to add bliss as a spkg. It could be quick, and if you have time right now we can settle it fast, I won't get to bed before one hour at least, I can review it before.

A ticket that adds a new package should contain:

1) A branch that adds the required files in the build/ folder

2) A .tar.bz2 file (hosted wherever you like) that I should download in the upstream/ folder before typing "sage -i bliss".

I am a bit offline this evening because I have a very short ethernet cable next to an uncomfortable chair. I come back from time to time to check my emails `:-P`

Good luck !

Nathann

<a id='comment:5'></a>Thanks for the input!! 

Continuing our talk here I have a short question. The class definitions of a Graph and Digraph in bliss both contain the same functions add_edge(int i, int j) and change_color(int x, int c).

Now as far as I see *if* we patch bliss to make these two functions a (virtual) part of the abstract graph class then we could do something like

```
AbstractGraph *g;
g = either Graph or Digraph
g.add_edge(i,j)
g.change_color(i,c)
g.find_automorphisms()
```

I think this would be the most efficient way to handle digraphs/graphs. 

Do you think this will work out or do you see any other way to handle these two types?

Oh. Well... It would be best to not patch anything in bliss, just in case they release a new version... You can add whatever code you need in the Sage code though.

But really if it is just to avoid some "if", perhaps that's going a bit far `O_o`

Yes I am most likely over-thinking it. Though with the if part we get an awful lot of duplicated (ugly). I guess there is some other way to make it nice while still being efficient - more to this when the actual branch is ready for review.

Yep. I'd be surprised if all functions named "automorphism_group" in Sage don't redirect to that in the end.

<a id='comment:16'></a>Did this! Also tested your example from the other day.

A workable branch is now available at public/bliss2. I am having a mismatch trying to push it to public/bliss.

Before we change Graph.canonical_form,is_isomorphic,automorphism_group I suggest that we address the FIXME stuff in the bliss.pyx code.

Another "issue" that is not in the code is what are we to do with the heuristics. There are a few heuristics for bliss and we can make them as an available choice for Sage or just go ahead with the default one.

Let me know what you think,

Jernej

Ohh, and here is your bipartite graph example:

```
sage: t1 = time() ; A = automorphism_group_bliss(G); t2 = time()
sage: t2-t1
0.15731596946716309
sage: t1 = time() ; A = G.automorphism_group(); t2 = time()
....... indefinitely..............

I am already writing some code at the moment and when I will be done I must go back to my blackboard. Is there is some specific question that you have for this patch please ask it, but if I begin to look at bliss' API, understand your code and answer the questions that you wrote inside it will probably take me as much time as writing the interface from scratch `:-P`

The current branch contains already many commits, and there are many things to pay attention to (we really don't want this code to return wrong results because of a typo) so it will probably be best to keep this branch to a minimum.

That does not mean that anything will have to be delayed: this branch will be sooner in `positive_review`, and then you can expose those features in another ticket.

Good luck ! `:-P`

Bliss returns a list of automorphisms as bijections. There is a function inside the code that then in one pass creates the respective cycle notation for the permutation while also applying the labelling of the graph. We have Permutation.to_cycle() that does the job but only on integer valued bijections. As is I'd like to leave this function in bliss.pyx and then perhaps once labelled permutations are supported by to_cycle(), revert to that. The main reason being that I am using Sage on graphs with 700k vertices and its a pain to have to iterate over and over for the sake of labels.\n\n2.

Do you have any intuition as to where to look for the issue? The code for Graph/Digraph that raises this exception is identical yet this only happens sporadically with digraphs.\n\nAs far as technical questions go, this are the main things I need some input about.\n\nBest,\n\nJernej\n\n> > Another \"issue\" that is not in the code is what are we to do with the heuristics.

Okay.

Sooo

1. Bliss returns a list of automorphisms as bijections. There is a function inside the code that then in one pass creates the respective cycle notation for the permutation while also applying the labelling of the graph. We have Permutation.to_cycle() that does the job but only on integer valued bijections. As is I'd like to leave this function in bliss.pyx and then perhaps once labelled permutations are supported by to_cycle(), revert to that. The main reason being that I am using Sage on graphs with 700k vertices and its a pain to have to iterate over and over for the sake of labels.

2. There is a very erratic bug  using bliss on digraphs.

```
    sage: D = digraphs.Kautz(10,2,1)
    sage: from sage.graphs.bliss import *
    sage: D.automorphism_group().is_isomorphic(automorphism_group(D))
    True
    sage: D.automorphism_group().is_isomorphic(automorphism_group(D))
    Bliss fatal error: Internal error - unknown splitting heuristics
    Aborting!
```

I have no clue why this is happening. Do you have any intuition as to where to look for the issue? The code for Graph/Digraph that raises this exception is identical yet this only happens sporadically with digraphs.

As far as technical questions go, this are the main things I need some input about.

Best,

Jernej

Which are the automorphisms which generate the full automorphism group of the graph ?

Actually, reading the code a bit, I am totally scared by how you cast Python objects like the two dictionaries to a bliss function. It expects C arrays, and you give it a pointer to a Python dictionary ? `O_o;;;;`

Yes, each time bliss discovers an automorphism it calls this function to handle it.

No I am sure I am not doing this. The argument there is a just a void pointer that bliss then passes on to your function. 

Soo bliss takes a function pointer to YOUR function and a pointer to YOUR data. And then it calls YOUR function passing it YOUR void pointer.

So that should be fine I suppose?

<a id='comment:31'></a>Looks really weird. 

I am waiting to figure out how can I be able to force a certain heuristic to be used because the behaviour right now is just sick. I've changed the "hook function" to an empty function (not doing any work) and its still messy:

```
sage: D = digraphs.Kautz(10,3,2)
sage: from sage.graphs.bliss import *
sage: automorphism_group(D)
Permutation Group with generators [()]
sage: automorphism_group(D)
Permutation Group with generators [()]
sage: automorphism_group(D)
Permutation Group with generators [()]
sage: automorphism_group(D)
Permutation Group with generators [()]
sage: automorphism_group(D)
Bliss fatal error: Internal error - unknown splitting heuristics
Aborting!
```

if G is a graph then 

```
while True: A = automorphism_group(G) 
```

works well. :O

Oh, excellent news !

> That said, I think it makes sense to see what is to be done to push this branch further?


First, it would be really good to have the 'spkg' ticket in `positive_review`. Jeroen set it back to `needs_work` recently, and now you have something else to add to it: the patch to change this line.

Now, you cannot modify upstream directly (i.e. the .tar.bz2 file) so you must use the 'patch' mechanism that is already being used in build/pkgs/sympy (for example). Look at the sympy/spkg-install file and the patches/ folder. The corresponding doc is there:

http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/packaging.html#patching-sources

> I have added some small documentation and would like to hear any kind of input that you may have.


Well, it seems that you still have some notes to yourself in the branch. Those that you cannot solve right now should probably appear in the documentation of the function to which they apply, and not at module level. (note: you can write a docstring in C functions. It will not appear as html do of course, but that's the right place to write the function's doc.)

In particular you have some formatting to do (a)length of lines b) the first line of doc is a one-line sentence describing the function.

You can also add the mechanism that makes GenericGraph.automorphism_group use bliss if available by default (set algorithm=None by default, and `if algorithm is None and is_package_installed("bliss")` then ...) if you like, otherwise I will do it at some point.

There is also this in the code

```
+        if algorithm == "bliss":
+            print 'yes'                
+            return
```

But really that's just cleaning. Short of that I do not think that there is anything important missing.

Oh, by the way: I do not think that you should really carry those vert2int or int2vert around. You could just say somewhere that the integer names of the vertices are those obtained by the ordering of `g.vertices()`

Then defining the two dictionaries is rather easy

```
int2verts = g.vertices()
vert2int = {v:i for i,v in enumerate(int2verts)}
```

Well, that's all. Only "code administration" `^^;`

I think it would be good to mention how the patch is created since there may be different parameters to diff and also since we like to just copy paste stuff and not think too much.

Yes, I'll make bliss the default the above was just a test. Though I we should really test this thoroughly since it can get messy if we leave a bug inside.. I spotted one before. Considering

```
return PermutationGroup(gens) 
```

everything works well most of the time (since in all tested graphs every vertex appears in some cycle of the generator). But if you do not specify the domain you may get automorphism groups not acting on all the required points...

Yes that's right. What made me choose the present version is the fact that the second line is already a for loop over the vertices and from how I understand g.vertices() that always involves a loop as well (at least to get the labels of the graph, grrr)?

I've now pushed the latest branch for bliss but I am having a problem since when I do sage -t generic_graph.py it keeps saying

```

    def is_vertex_transitive(self, partition=None, verbosity=0,
                                                              ^
IndentationError: unindent does not match any outer indentation level
```

and I and vim's :list are just blind... (dont' see it)

Do you happen to see where the indentation breaks and do you happen to have any new comments about the current code? I think it should be pretty near to what it should look like.

What I don't like about "def canonical_label(..." is that the doc appears BEFORE the function's definition. Could it be that ?

> do you happen to have any new comments about the current code?


Well, definitely there is something wrong in `automorphism_group`, where you define a keyword `algorithm` but never read it. Then you should probably add a couple of new doctests using bliss (with an #optional flag) in the function from `generic_graph`. Whatever you do with this function's input, you should probably do the same in the similar functions btw: `canonical_label`, and `is_isomorphic`.

Also, it looks like the test that you run in `is_isomorphic`  (number of edges/vertices) already appear a bit later in the code. No reason to have them appear twice.

There is still this line which has nothing to do here

```diff
+    :meth:`~GenericGraph.geodetic_number` | Returns the geodetic number of the given graph. 
```

Oh, and several lines are still longer than 80chr, and we try to wrap them because ...

Because somebody said that we had to.

That surely didn't help but the error still persists :-S I have no idea where the mismatch is.

Yes I was following your advice from above which was to add a condition of the form

```
 if algorithm is None and is_package_installed("bliss") :
```

since we only offer two algorithms for now this works fine, perhaps provided that we write the option algorithm="nice" to  indicate the currently default implementation? What do you suggest?

Is it not enough to have them in bliss.pyx? If not, then I'll add some doctests when we agree on the technical aspects of the code

80chr is quite tight :O Also have you noticed that there appears to be some indentation inconsistency in the code? It looks like the functions on the bottom (example def graph_isom_equivalent_non_edge_labeled_graph) are not indented as the above ones?

Right now when I run the tests on `generic_graph` I get several screens filled with "is_package_installed is not defined".

And what happens when you do `G.automorphism_group(algorithm="bliss")` as indicated in the function's doc ? `:-P`

> Is it not enough to have them in bliss.pyx? If not, then I'll add some doctests when we agree on the technical aspects of the code 


That would be for advertising purposes. Just one would do, just to emphasize that another algorithm is available.

> 80chr is quite tight :O 


As usual it is some PEP's fault. It probably is PEP8. It is always PEP8's fault.

> Also have you noticed that there appears to be some indentation inconsistency in the code? It looks like the functions on the bottom (example def graph_isom_equivalent_non_edge_labeled_graph) are not indented as the above ones?   


Oh ? No, I never saw that. Well, some hardcore PEP8 guy will probably change it some day.

OFC it has no sense but I was just following the guideline. I've now changed that so that we check that algorithm = 'bliss' explicitly. In case you have something else in mind let me know.

Advertisement added.

Its also pretty funny that 90% of the lines are 100% over 80 char.

The current code passes all the tests and I am open for further suggestions.

As far as the empty commit message that is due to a mismatch of vim commands in nano.

Oh sorry, I was thinking of something different:

1) We want the users who explicitly ask for "bliss" to never run any other code
2) We want users who do not care to run "bliss" if it is available (they may be calling that code through another functions without knowing)

```
if (algorithm is None and
    is_package_installed("bliss") and
    not edge_labels):
    algorithm = "bliss"
if algorithm == "bliss":
    try:
        from sage.graphs.bliss import is_isomorphic
    except ImportError:
        raise RuntimeError("You must install the bliss spkg before running this code")
    <bliss call>
```

> The current code passes all the tests and I am open for further suggestions.


Could you move the code comments that explain the function's behaviour inside of the function ? As you would do if it were a Python function (e.g. bliss_graph/bliss_digraph, add_gen) ? It would be cool if you could also write the documentation of these functions (e.g. INPUT section), even though you cannot doctest them.

Could you also document what `empty_hook` is meant for ? It is useless right now but it would be good to know what it does if we ever want to use it for something (and that's the kind of stuff which can become *VERY* useful). Please document its parameters too.

And this is to be placed in the say is_isomorphic/automorphism_group part and so on? If so, isn't this a bit of an overhead to be checked each time?

Are you afraid of the call to `is_package_installed` ? If so, it may not be a bad option to cache it at module level. Something like a "is_bliss_available = is_package_installed("bliss")" in `generic_graph.py`. It would only be loaded when the graph files are loaded first.

<a id='comment:52'></a>Hello again !

I made a pass on this code, added some doc, fixed a few things and... Well, now I only have a couple of questions about this branch:

- What about implementing bliss' version of `is_isomorphic` later ? The feature that we need right now is `automorphism_group`  (I needed it today, the difference is amazing!), so can't the rest be done later if we need it ? By the way, I never had any slowness problem with `is_isomorphic` (or `canonical_label`) that I can remember.

- It seems that the `Bliss fatal error: Internal error - unknown splitting heuristics` problem is not solved. I see it happen when I run the tests in the graph/ folder.

- I changed the code to list the vertices according to `enumerate(G.vertices())` instead of `enumerate(G)`. We have this standard in other places that when vertices are turned into integers, it is done using the ordering of `G.vertices()`.

Tell me what you think ! I would be glad to have this into Sage soon `;-)`

Hm.. I need these things, especially canonical_label. Do you have any practical reasons to leave this out? I mean it doesn't look like it needs that much effort at this point.

Well, there is no reason to leave `canonical_label` out, even though I don't get why the current canonical label function from Sage wouldn't do the job for you.

It was more about the `is_isomorphic` function that is not fully implemented. I wouldn't mind having this patch in Sage quick, and report the implementation of that to another ticket.

> Weird. Are you sure you're using the patched version of bliss?


I just made a test:
- Loaded the branch
- Checked that the branch contained the patches/ directory
- erased my local copy of the bliss.tar file
- installed it again

Same result when I run "sage -tp 4 -l generic_graph.py". Don't you get the same errors ?

Ahahah. Well, his algorithm is short, I like it `:-)`

It's up to you. I do not think that it is the bottleneck of any computations, so to me 'the easiest to read is the best choice'

Unless you find his supercool I'd like to stay with what is already there since otherwise I have to understand how his code works. His solution is faster though.

Yes sure. I am in correspondence with him and I am waiting for his reply right now. So before I flood him with this new email I'd like to wait for his answer.

We can leave the code as is then!

As far as I get the current state of affairs, we need to

1. Leave out the is_isomorphic thing
2. Find a workaround for the digraph thing.

and then we are almost done?

<a id='comment:77'></a>Jernej, you cannot make the computation of tutte polynomials avoid bliss only because of a doctest.

The doctest should be changed to be independent from the solver, or flagged as #random, or you should expose 'algorithm="sage/bliss"' in the tutte polynomial function... I mean, there are many workaround possible but you can't explicitly forbid people to use bliss for such computations only because of a doctest.

Err. Well, actually you can't just remove all doctests of a function. `sage -coverage <filename>` should answer that all functions are doctested, so at least something should call the function. I added a small commit that modified the previous doctest, in such a way that it does not depend on the ordering of the labelling.

It does not check much to be honest, only that something actually gets cached. Well.

If you are okay with this branch, you can set it to positive review. And we will at long last be able to compute automorphism groups efficiently.

<a id='comment:9'></a>The patching works fine. I added `grep "sh = shs_f;" -A 5 -B 5 graph.cc` right at the end of the 'for patch in' loop in spkg-install, and I see:

```
Digraph::Digraph(const unsigned int nof_vertices)
{
  vertices.resize(nof_vertices);
  sh = shs_f;
}
```

I also don't understand why it would work on your computer and not on mine.

<a id='comment:4'></a>Nathann,

sorry for the delay. Was computing something on all external machines and did want to stop to compile sage.

I have now tested this on another machine (fetch stuff with git install bliss sage -t on generic_graph.py and graph.py) and it works well.

Also

```
sage: digraphs.DeBruijn(3,1).is_circulant(certificate = True)

(True, [(3, [0, 1, 2])])
```

So I have no idea why the error is still occurring for you.

Best,

Jernej

Not yet. First, I think I saw somewhere that the documentation did not build, and this must be fixed. Because of some http link.

Then we must figure out what happened, for even if a distclean makes the trick something fishy is going on in the building process (Volker may know). Unless we find what it is and fix it, everybody will have to do a `make distclean` in order to have it work, just like we did.

Well, the 'main' bug that we had was this 'undefined heuristic' poblem which caused crashes. As I reported above, running a 'make distclean' and reinstalling everything solves it, and now this branch passes all tests on my computer.

I would be tempted to switch it to 'positive review', but that would produce errors on everybody's computer unless they *also* run this make distclean! If you say that this would be solved by changing the version number, then let us do that and switch it to 'positive review'

What worries me is that I do not understand why changing the version number would have any effect that forcing a reinstall through 'sage -f bliss' did not have. I tried it, long before trying 'make distclean', and it had no effect.

What do you think we should do ?

<a id='comment:0'></a>Hello!

First of all thank you for pushing this last bit!!

I've glanced at the changes, tested the relevant modules with -t and checked if sage --docbuild reference html gives any errors related to this change.

All of the above looks good so I am giving this a positive review. In case you need something else to be checked let me know.

Best,

Jernej

> Is bliss making random choices during the computation? There is no need for non-deterministic choices in graph automorphisms, I'm sure.


A permutation group can have different sets of generators, and that's the trouble here: Sage and Nauty do not obtain the same. The groups are equal, however, as illustrated above.

> Patch it out and/or setting the seed might be a better fix in the long run. 


There was a real bug in there. I fixed it, and sent an email to Jernej hoping that he can take a look at it soon.
