burcin mentions in comment 2 of #9769:

The `__call__()` function of RR[x] doesn't conform to the generic definition. You should be able to give the parameters as a keyword argument as well. This should be made to work:

```
sage: R.<x> = RR[]
sage: (x^2+1)(x=5)
26.0000000000000
```


Component: **basic arithmetic**

Keywords: **real, mpfr, substitution**
