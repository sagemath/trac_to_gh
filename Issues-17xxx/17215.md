A point v on a convex polyhedron P is a vertex of P if and only if there exists an affine hyperplane in the linear span of P which intersects P only in v. Knowing such affine hyperplane is a good certificate for v being a vertex.

This ticket implements the method `normal_cone` for faces of polyhedra, consisting of all the directions of the normals to supporting hyperplanes of the specified face.

In this case your considering one of two possible rays. Probably should only append rays for inequalities, but I'm not sure.

One question: How do we construct the hyperplane that interesects exactly the face from this (see description of ticket).
