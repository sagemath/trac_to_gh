A point v on a convex polyhedron P is a vertex of P if and only if there exists an affine hyperplane in the linear span of P which intersects P only in v. Knowing such affine hyperplane is a good certificate for v being a vertex.

This ticket implements the method `normal_cone` for faces of polyhedra, consisting of all the directions of the normals to supporting hyperplanes of the specified face.

If you construct the polyhedron with via `the_poly.parent()` similar to e.g. many examples in #27926 you can avoid the import of the constructor.

Don't know if that's better.

You did not consider the case, where the polyhedron has equations.

In this case your considering one of two possible rays. Probably should only append rays for inequalities, but I'm not sure.

One question: How do we construct the hyperplane that interesects exactly the face from this (see description of ticket).

I changed it to "needs_work" because it still does not work for non-full-dimensional polytopes.

On a (very) related topic, the method `normal_fan` of Polyhedron returns

```
ValueError: the normal fan is only defined for full-dimensional polytopes
```
for non-full-dimensional polytopes. It should return "not implemented" since `normal_fan` is defined for non-full-dimensional polytopes.

I think the following is more direct:

```diff
-        origin = parent.zero().vertices()[0].vector()
+        origin = self.ambient_space().zero()
```

Otherwise you can put it positive review on my behalf. Maybe wait for bots yet.
