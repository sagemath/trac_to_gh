A point v on a convex polyhedron P is a vertex of P if and only if there exists an affine hyperplane in the linear span of P which intersects P only in v. Knowing such affine hyperplane is a good certificate for v being a vertex.

This ticket implements the method `normal_cone` for faces of polyhedra, consisting of all the directions of the normals to supporting hyperplanes of the specified face.

You did not consider the case, where the polyhedron has equations.

In this case your considering one of two possible rays. Probably should only append rays for inequalities, but I'm not sure.

I changed it to "needs_work" because it still does not work for non-full-dimensional polytopes.

On a (very) related topic, the method `normal_fan` of Polyhedron returns

```
ValueError: the normal fan is only defined for full-dimensional polytopes
```
for non-full-dimensional polytopes. It should return "not implemented" since `normal_fan` is defined for non-full-dimensional polytopes.

Reading carefully your doctests, one sees a bug, which will be fixed in #29155.

Instead of using `faces` for iteration you can use the new method `face_generator`.
