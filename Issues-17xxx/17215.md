A point v on a convex polyhedron P is a vertex of P if and only if there exists an affine hyperplane in the linear span of P which intersects P only in v. Knowing such affine hyperplane is a good certificate for v being a vertex.

This ticket implements the method `normal_cone` for faces of polyhedra, consisting of all the directions of the normals to supporting hyperplanes of the specified face.
