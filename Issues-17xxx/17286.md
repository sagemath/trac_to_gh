I am marking some pure build-time dependencies as "order only". The mainly concerns the dependency of ATLAS on Python: we no longer require ATLAS to be rebuilt just because Python gets upgraded.

I am also adding `PKGCONF` to `base`.

Note: this feature requires GNU make >= 3.80, but that was already a documented requirement of Sage.
