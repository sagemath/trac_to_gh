`@`SÃ©bastien: can you test the fixed patches (just pull the branch and force zeromq install with `./sage -f`)?
I don't have my VMs at hand so it's not trivial for me to test.
I should have time to reboot under Windows at some point though.

zeromq uses autotools.
The patches in `build_system` directory are those you need to apply to the zeromq build system before autotools automatically generate the full build system.
Once these patches are applied, one can invoke autotools to update the build system (e.g. running `autoreconf -fiv && rm -rf autom4te.cache`) and deduce the full patches in the `patches` directory which don't need autotools invokation anymore and can be applied at build time.

To summarize it's good to ship two set of patches because:
* we can't rely on invoking autotools at build time because it is not a prerequisite and would not be manageable anyway, it's kind of impossible to make sure that the build system will be correctly regenarated with one of the random versions of autotools programs in the wild, therefore the build system has to be regenerated on a dev machine and full patches have to be distributed,
* the patches only touching the input to autotools are still of interest as these are the ones to be updated manually if we want to introduce further changes in the build system, and the ones to submit upstream for inclusion (and when upstream makes new releases it will regenerate the full build system)
