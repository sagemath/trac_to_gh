This does not work:

```
sage: g1 = groups.permutation.PGL(2,2)
sage: g2 = groups.matrix.GO(3,2)
sage: g2.is_isomorphic(g1)
...
AttributeError: 'PGL_with_category' object has no attribute 'gap'
```

A simple hack seems to work

```
sage: g1.gap = g1._gap_
sage: g2.is_isomorphic(g1)
True
```

Though I was not able to find where `_gap_` was defined on permutation groups.

Note that `g1.is_isomorphic(g2)` fails for another reason

```
sage: g1.is_isomorphic(g2)
...
TypeError: right must be a permutation group
```
