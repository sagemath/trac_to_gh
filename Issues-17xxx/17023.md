Add a `.width()` -- i.e. number of elements in the longest antichain -- to poset. Seems to have polynomial time algorithm based on Dilworth's Theorem.

There is, but I want to do the job properly.

You can get the width with `len(Graph(your_poset.hasse_diagram().transitive_closure()).independent_set())` in the meantime.

If `height()` has description "Return the height (number of elements in the longest chain) of the poset.", then I think that this should have

"Return the height (number of elements in the longest antichain) of the poset.

For information about algorithm, see :wikipedia:`Dilworth's_theorem`."

Because Dilworth's theorem is not really part of function definition but an implementation detail.

Seems to work. I checked extreme cases: empty poset, one-element poset, chains and antichains, all poset of size n up to n=7 and few thousand random posets with varying parameters.

Reading code is propably best done with someone wiser than I am.

One line descriptions should have a dot at the end, because they are full sentences.

Hello !

What do you mean ? If the poset is not connected you can indeed split it and compute the result on each connected components but I don't think the code I implemented will run any faster because of that. It would decrease the number of antichains though. But add an element superior to all others in your posets and you lost connectivity for the very same width.

Well, maybe there is some algorithm to recognize posets with width <=2. And we already have a `is_chain` for width 1. Also, I think that something like 

```
len(Graph(posets.ChainPoset(6).hasse_diagram().transitive_closure()).independent_set())
```
should be a bit faster than enumerating the antichains. Even though enumerating the antichains may be faster for very very line-looking posets, for you don't have any graphs to copy around, ...

You are right, on average connected posets are far more common than non-connected. Hence this should be like it now is.

Duh, should I try to understand theorem and read the code...

I think the `s` in the list of methods should stay there for coherence of this list.

As there is no `s` in the first line of the new functions, things are good as they are.

LGTM. Let us not lose time on stupid things.
