CC:  @nathanncohen

Add a `.width()` -- i.e. number of elements in the longest antichain -- to poset. Seems to have polynomial time algorithm based on Dilworth's Theorem.

There is, but I want to do the job properly.

You can get the width with `len(Graph(your_poset.hasse_diagram().transitive_closure()).independent_set())` in the meantime.

If `height()` has description "Return the height (number of elements in the longest chain) of the poset.", then I think that this should have

"Return the height (number of elements in the longest antichain) of the poset.

For information about algorithm, see :wikipedia:`Dilworth's_theorem`."

Because Dilworth's theorem is not really part of function definition but an implementation detail.

Seems to work. I checked extreme cases: empty poset, one-element poset, chains and antichains, all poset of size n up to n=7 and few thousand random posets with varying parameters.

Reading code is propably best done with someone wiser than I am.

One line descriptions should have a dot at the end, because they are full sentences.

I did some timings. It seems that for something like `P=Posets.RandomPoset(100,0.15)` or so it is faster to run `max(len(x) for x in P.antichains())` than `P.width()`. On the other hand the measured complexity of `.width()` seems to be polynomial as it should.

Actually this has been thinked already. Brinkmann & McKay says at the end of paper Posets on up to 16 points "Our results do not show this behaviour, emphasizing again that the convergence of posets to their asymptotic behaviour is quite slow." Hence no help from that.

I think the `s` in the list of methods should stay there for coherence of this list.

As there is no `s` in the first line of the new functions, things are good as they are.

LGTM. Let us not lose time on stupid things.
