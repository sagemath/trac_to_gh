Add a `.width()` -- i.e. number of elements in the longest antichain -- to poset. Seems to have polynomial time algorithm based on Dilworth's Theorem.

There is, but I want to do the job properly.

You can get the width with `len(Graph(your_poset.hasse_diagram().transitive_closure()).independent_set())` in the meantime.

Actually this has been thinked already. Brinkmann & McKay says at the end of paper Posets on up to 16 points "Our results do not show this behaviour, emphasizing again that the convergence of posets to their asymptotic behaviour is quite slow." Hence no help from that.

What do you mean ? If the poset is not connected you can indeed split it and compute the result on each connected components but I don't think the code I implemented will run any faster because of that. It would decrease the number of antichains though. But add an element superior to all others in your posets and you lost connectivity for the very same width.

> If posets are more "chain-like", then simply looking antichains seems to be faster. For posets more "antichain-like" it is much faster to use this new `.width()` method. Where is the turning point? Can there be some heuristic based on ratio of number of edges to number of vertices?


Well, maybe there is some algorithm to recognize posets with width <=2. And we already have a `is_chain` for width 1. Also, I think that something like 

```
len(Graph(posets.ChainPoset(6).hasse_diagram().transitive_closure()).independent_set())
```
should be a bit faster than enumerating the antichains. Even though enumerating the antichains may be faster for very very line-looking posets, for you don't have any graphs to copy around, ...

Duh, should I try to understand theorem and read the code...

<a id='comment:22'></a>I think the `s` in the list of methods should stay there for coherence of this list.

As there is no `s` in the first line of the new functions, things are good as they are.

LGTM. Let us not lose time on stupid things.
