The extracted directory name doesn't matter. Nobody says it has to be of the form `package-version`.

Of course, if you need a `spkg-src` for other reasons, you might as well change the top-level directory name but it's not required.

I opened #19570 for a different purpose. François Bissey pointed me to the present ticket (which I somehow missed while searching Trac for boost) and Jeroen Demeyer closed the ticket.

I do not understand the issues at hand. As far as I understand, the current Sagemath packages husr the boost subdirectory, which is sufficient for current Sagemath, whereas, as pointed out by François, various voices have spoken in favor of the inclusion of the whole hawg, for goals that do not seem overly clear to me.

As far as I can tell :
* The original reason of including boost (polybori, a. k. a. brial) is fulfilled by the current packaging (headers only).
* This packaging is no longer stripped from polybori sources, but a subdirectory of the original boost tarball.
* The bits needed by Nathaan Cohen for its graph manipulation purposes also are in place.
* The reasons for packaging the whole hawg are not yet definite plans.
* This packaging needs significant work.

So could we split this work in two :
1. update the current packaging of the headers (that would fix my problemn and possibly Nathaans's too).
2. develop the packaging of the whole boost.

The packaging of the headers is already a standard package, and therefore should probably remain so. The complete libary could become an optional package, on which new optional packages could depend.

However, if some standard package (e. g. ECL) could benefit of the inclusion of the whole boost, this library should become standard...

What do you think ?

I am sorry, I have mistaken your purpose. If you had titled upgrade `boost_cropped` I probably wouldn't have touched your ticket at all.

I think it is ok to upgrade `boost_cropped` while we are working out on the full package as a longer term view.
