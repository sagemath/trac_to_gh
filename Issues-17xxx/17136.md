as reported, gmp currently needs to be installed to build `latte_int`, 
otherwise configure fails. The fix for this is to add `--with-gmp=$SAGE_LOCAL` to the list of `configure` parameters in `spkg-install`.

Besides, `latte_int` is now version 1.7.1, not 1.6 (shipped now).

Hi,

I just pushed one commit where I removed the trailing whitespaces that you introduced. If it is ok, you can set to positive review.
