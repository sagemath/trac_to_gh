See [this ask.sagemath question](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/24532/).  Original report is 

```
sage: F = sqrt((cos(x) - 1)^2 + sin(x)^2)
sage: F.integrate(x, 0, 2*pi)
0
```
but the answer should be 8.

EDIT: related

```
sage: F.integrate(x, 0, pi)
4
sage: F.integrate(x, pi, 2*pi)
-4
```
and the primitive is wrong:

```
sage: F.integrate(x)
-4/sqrt(sin(x)^2/(cos(x) + 1)^2 + 1)
```

**Keywords:** abs_integrate

**Upstream:** Fixed upstream, but not in a stable release.

**Stopgaps:** #12731

which in additional links to Mathematically Wrong Answers:
http://trac.sagemath.org/query?status=new&status=needs_work&status=needs_review&status=needs_info&type=defect&stopgaps=!&max=0&order=id

I would support that (to warn the greenhorns), or will that have too much opposition?

Agree, so what about showing a stopgap warning only once per user+computer+sageVersion or similar?
( otherwise the user has explicitly request regular stopgap warnings)

The issue with the primitive of F may come from our choice of "domain: complex" in maxima.

Using `maxima("domain : real;")` gives another answer, that could be better.

EDIT: this seems to give in fact the same wrong primitive.

fricas and giac also gives other wrong primitives, not even continuous ? Sigh :(
