Yes we have to wait for a new Linbox, expected about the end of february, Clément Pernet wrote me, together with updated Givaro and fflas-ffpack.

By the way, I started this for #17630 which might interest you as well, I'll push code there tomorrow.

It's June already...

Since givaro, LinBox and FFLAS-FFPACK all depend on each other, we should make one ticket.

Sorry for the delay in releasing the fflas-ffpack/Givaro/LinBox environment.
We're working on it now, and I'll keep you posted about the status. It should happen before the end of the year and hopefully much earlier.

I also meant to propose to replace ATLAS by OpenBLAS in sage.
Looking at your clean-up work of the BLAS in #17630, I understand that we should proceed in the following order:
1. release linbox 
2. upgrade linbox fflas-ffpack Givaro in Sage (this ticket #17635)
3. clean-up the BLAS usage #17630
4. replace ATLAS by OpenBLAS (ticket to be created)

I'll be happy to help in these tasks.

Let me remind you also about #15535, which pops up regularly. I don't know if it's a bug in Linbox or in the way that Sage uses Linbox, but it would be good to have a Linbox developer look at it.

I'll admit to have been a bit demotivated on the blas cleaning front. The tickets needs re-organizing and have good descriptions so we know what is supposed to go in them. Getting `ATLAS` to produce `.pc` file and using them is probably a priority task. Once that's done someone could create an optional `openblas` spkg or something.

I'm working on it, and will release a new version of the 3 libs for the occasion, so as to ensure a smoother integration upstream. This will very likely be
givaro-4.0.1
fflas-ffpack-2.2.0
linbox-1.4.1

These libraries now require c++11 support and this tickets therefore depends on #18323.

Inspired by what's propose in there, I suggest to add lines of the form

`+# distutils: extra_compile_args = -std=c++11`

to libs/linbox/linbox.pxd lib/linbox/fflas.pxd lib/linbox/echelonform.pxd but I understand that this is subject to a debate on sage-devel
[https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/aGwotQA9to8](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/aGwotQA9to8)

If this option happens to be accepted, we would then need to add more cflags in the list: namely those produced by fflas-ffpack configure related to the target architecture:
`-mavx -msse4.1` and others like `-fabi-version=6 -fopenmp`.

I could not figure a way to append the string returned by `bin/fflas-ffpack-config --cflags` to these pxd files. Any hint?

Add a definition in `module_list.py`, you define a `LINBOX_FLAGS`. It would be easier if you had a `.pc` file as we have a python interface to `pkgconfig` that we can use easily. Here you have to do your own parsing from python. Anyway you can then use `LINBOX_FLAGS` in the `.pxd` file.

This looks like it should be used always for all C++ files then. Mixing ABI's doesn't look like a good idea.

> `-fopenmp`

Same question as before, is this really needed for the Cython interface?

fflas-ffpack and linbox are essentially source libraries, so when you include the headers, you include the whole code. This is by design, due to the ubiquity of template programming in these libraries.

Now the old linbox-sage interface compiles some specializations and offer them through a C api. These extra flags would not be required if we would stick to using this interface.

But, since then, Cython started to offer the capability to hook C++ code directly and  more functionnalities have been added in sage where fflas-ffpack code is called directly, like in libs/linbox/fflas.pxd where the C++ routine FFLAS::fgemm is called.

Sure. Maybe one should change the ABI higher up then.

> Same question as before, is this really needed for the Cython interface?

Same answer as above.

I added my working branch to the ticket.
I could not find if and where I should store the tarballs of the new spkg?

As of today (sept 28 2015); they correspond to the upstream version of the 3 libs: givaro, fflas-ffpack and linbox.

I added .pc files for givaro and fflas-ffpack (coming soon for linbox), and defined the extra_compile_flages in `modules_list.py` as suggested by fbissey.

This is still work in progress:
* LinBox sparse solver make the test-suite fail: I'm investigating the problem, which I could not reproduce in LinBox for the moment.
* the extra_compile_flags should be inferred from the .pc files (harcoded for the moment). I did not find how to use pkg-config through python to do it.

Jeroen or François are you suggesting that the proper way to proceed is to
* define the flags `givaro_extra_compile_args`, `fflas_ffpack_extra_compile_args`, `linbox_extra_compile_args` in `module_list.py`
* use them in the pxd files with something like 

``` 
+# distutils: extra_compile_args = ${givaro_extra_compile_args}
```
?
Will do, if that's the way to go.

Also, I did not find how to invoque the python interface to pkgconfig, mentionned by françois.

For example, why does `src/sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_ideal_libsingular.pxd` need `GIVARO_CFLAGS`? Looking at that file, there is *nothing* related to givaro.

I assume you added `GIVARO_CFLAGS` because it still somehow indirectly includes Givaro code. But then you should add `GIVARO_CFLAGS` in the place where the Givaro headers are actually included and Cython's dependency tracking should pick it up.

See again the `GSL_LIBRARIES` example: I don't add `GSL_LIBRARIES` to every module which somehow indirectly uses GSL, only where the library functions are actually declared.

Yes. It was necessary to add these flags to extensions when everything was gathered in module_list.py, but no longer now that it is in each pxd files. I now see the point!
Sorry for messing this up, it's fixed. I also made the CFLAGS variables set by the pkgconfig .pc files, as suggested by François.

One pb remains: there is no gmp.pc for the moment, and the givaro.pc lists gmp as a dependency. Similarly fflas-ffpack.pc should list blas as dependency, but we still don't have a blas.pc file (see #17075).
I suggest to remove these dependencies for the moment, and I'll add them once we have the proper .pc files.
If you confirm, I'll produce new tar.gz for givaro and fflas-ffpack accordingly.

I see. However, did anything change compared to earlier versions of these packages regarding compilation? If not and it worked before, it should still work...

At this stage I think that's an unknown that will only be determined by experience.

I haven't looked at `linbox`' `configure.ac` yet so I don't know about that. I only noticed that it for `fflas-ffpack` it is the default if you don't pass anything.

OK, more thoughts about `fflas-ffpack`. By default usage of `sse4.1`, `avx`, `avx2` and `fma` instructions are enabled if found. This is a problem when building a binary for redistribution as we cannot guarantee that the target machine will support any instructions found on the building machine. We need to be able to disable those for binary build (`SAGE_FAT_BINARY=yes`?). 

Going through `linbox` now. Like `fflas-ffpack`, `openmp` is enabled by default even without `--enable-openmp` in `spkg-install` but it looks like it can be disable the standard way to me. `linbox` looks for 

```
LB_CHECK_IML
LB_CHECK_M4RI
LB_CHECK_M4RIE
LB_CHECK_MPFR
# we nedd mpfr next :
LB_CHECK_FPLLL
LB_CHECK_FLINT

LB_CHECK_NTL
```
but none of these are in `linbox`'s dependencies. Are any of those actually used?
Actually the current version should depend on `ntl` and `iml`

Sure, we could do that. The alternative option would be to do as for the openblas deb package: have it include all kernel variants and let the switch happen dynamically depending on the variant of x86 it is run on. I am not very familiar with this technique and need to investigate how this can be built.

Yes it can, but in `linbox` it will still pass a `-fopenmp` argument to g++ even if you passed the `--disable-openmp` option at configure time. You made me find it yesterday, and this is now [https://github.com/linbox-team/linbox/issues/24](https://github.com/linbox-team/linbox/issues/24).

These are optional dependencies. The long term goal is to have linbox code that uses these libs when available. For the moment, I think they are mostly used for benchmarking comparisons, except for `NTL, IML` and `fplll` used here and there when available.

Passing the `--with-all=` option to configure, as we do, will automatically enable all these optional dependencies if they are found. We could be more picky if this causes problems.

This seems correct: the sage-linbox interface only uses these 2 libs when found.
Are you saying that the `-liml` option is not passed to gcc even when `iml` was detected at configure time? This would be another bug then.

I would rather have `ntl` and `iml` at least be in the dependencies as it makes the build reproducible. Otherwise the libraries linked to `linboxsage` will be random.",

> This seems correct: the sage-linbox interface only uses these 2 libs when found.
> Are you saying that the `-liml` option is not passed to gcc even when `iml` was detected at configure time? This would be another bug then.


Yes, at least it is the case in 1.3.6, I haven't confirmed yet it is the case in 1.4.0, but if you weren't aware of it then it is probably still the case. I would rather have `ntl` and `iml` at least be in the dependencies as it makes the build reproducible. Otherwise the libraries linked to `linboxsage` will be random.

On POWER8, I get an internal compiler error while compiling `fflas-ffpack` using GCC-4.9.3.

Clement, did you manage to compile `fflas-ffpack` on sardonis? Do you use the system-installed GCC 4.9.2 or did you compile within Sage?

I got this to build properly now, but there are still a lot of doctest failures in finite field arithmetic :-(

Are there any significant API changes in Givaro that we should know about?

Will have conflicts with #20140 if I add bits to the dependencies of `linbox`. As mentioned earlier it has automagic dependencies on `iml`, `ntl` and now `fplll` (to check) so you potentially get slightly different `linbox` depending on the build order. I am uncomfortable with that.

I spent quite some today working on `fflas-ffpack-2.2.0` for sage-on-gentoo, expect a PR shortly to fix the tests when `fflas-ffpack` has been configured with `--enable-precompilation` (not that the test will work if you previously installed `fflas-ffpack` with `--enable-precompilation` in a standard location - do I need to say more).

`lapack`, and even probably `ATLAS`' clapack interface, is detected properly but you have to pass all the libraries for `lapack` and `cblas` in the `--with-blas-libs` switch. With our new `.pc` files that should translate to

```
--with-blas-cflags="$(pkg-config cblas --cflags)" --with-blas-libs="$(pkg-config lapack --libs)"
```
Although it would probably be safer to put

```
--with-blas-cflags="$(pkg-config cblas --cflags)" --with-blas-libs="$(pkg-config lapack  cblas blas --libs)"
```
in case `lapack.pc` doesn't pull either or both `cblas` and `blas`.

`sage` run `spkg-check` after install (a bit daft but hard to fix with the current system) so we should also be ok to add a `spkg-check` to `fflas-ffpack` without including my upcoming PR.

Clement told me a couple of weeks ago he was on holidays. I also send a couple of PR for `fflas-ffpack` and `linbox`. He is supposed to cut new releases. I would prefer to wait for a new cut of `linbox` at least as patching the one in the description and running `autoreconf` on it lead to unexpected results (`liblinbox` and `liblinboxsage` were linked completely differently, WTF?).

Hi,
Sorry for the delay. Just for the status report.
I've produced fflas-ffpack-2.2.1rc0 and linbox-1.4.1rc0 (links available in the description of this ticket), where I tried to fix the remaining issues:
* fixing the disable-omp problem (issue [https://github.com/linbox-team/linbox/issues/24](https://github.com/linbox-team/linbox/issues/24)) 
* the missing line break in OMP macro (but it should not be a problem here, as we disable omp) (comment 67_68)
* removing the obsolete `--enable-optimization` of linbox (comment 64)
 
I still did not touch the opencl issue.

I updated linbox and fflas-ffpack release candidates to address the several issues on dynamic lib linkage (including francois PR).
I took this opportunity to create a linbox.pc file and update the module_list.py accordingly.

all libraries compile and pass their test suites on my side, and sage builds and passes the test suite with these new rc1's.
I also tested the libs but not sage compilation on sardonis (power8).

OK, so I have done my inspection:
 1) list of linbox dependency that we want to be there: ntl, fplll, flint, mpfr, iml. Those are direct build dependencies

flint is not in the current list. m4ri and m4rie can be removed as they are looked for by `configure` but not used.
 2) we want to have opencl (`--without-ocl`) to be turned off, at least for binary build.
 3) because `sage/libs/linbox/linbox.pyx` has been given a block

```
# distutils: extra_compile_args = LINBOX_CFLAGS
# distutils: libraries = LINBOX_LIBRARIES
# distutils: library_dirs = LINBOX_LIBDIR
```
the entry in `modules_list.py` doesn't need `libraries = linbox_libs`. `cblas_include_dirs` can stay as its content is somehow not included in `fflas-ffpack.pc` (but it is in `fflas-ffpack-config --cflags`). Similarly `fflas-ffpack.pc` has no information on the blas/lapack libraries - may be it should - you would inherit the correct stuff without having to add anything. Someone check this on a vanilla install please.
 4) Do we want lapack support in `fflas-ffpack`? That would mean changing `LINBOX_BLAS="$(pkg-config --libs cblas)"` to `LINBOX_BLAS="$(pkg-config --libs lapack cblas)"` this has an impact on the previous item as you really need to know which libraries are used (especially if your linker is dumb). Note: you may want at least `LINBOX_BLAS="$(pkg-config --cflags --libs cblas)"` in case the headers are in a funny location.

Indeed, I just realized that Github release tool (simply based on a tag) does not work nicely with autotools and make dist targets generating the configure file.
I added the proper tar.gz generated by make dist as a binary and will fix the link on this ticket.

No, it's just that my scripts accidentally ran a make dist on givaro, a few commits ahead of v4.0.1, and moved the tarball to sage and had the checksums updated.

@jdemeyer: sorry for this mess. I updated the packages to new rc's and updated the checksums accordingly.

This update includes a fix to fbissey's remark (3) (fflas-ffpack now exposes BLAS flags).
I'll wait for a next release to complete the move to pkgconfig, (i.e. detecting givaro, fflas-ffpack only from their pc files, and requiring pkgconfig as a dependency).

This ticket is ready again on my side. 
I switch to needs_review.
Once a reviewer confirms it works, please don't positive review too soon as it depends on the rc's for the moment. I'll need to release linbox and fflas-ffpack, and update de checksums and pkg_version before being able to close it.

```

I tested the branch in this ticket and still had this same problem.  It's a little mysterious, but I haven't deeply investigated it yet.

However, if I go into the build directory for fflas_ffpack and manually run:

```
$ ./configure --prefix="$SAGE_LOCAL" --libdir="$SAGE_LOCAL/lib" --with-default="$SAGE_LOCAL"  --with-blas="$(pkg-config --libs cblas)" --enable-optimization --disable-static
```

So ISTM it would suffice to remove the special section in `spkg-install` for Cygwin which I guess is no longer required (why, I don't know). That might as well be done as part of this patch.

I know it doesn't work on Cygwin properly, but that's true for the old version too, so it's not a regression.

I attached a patch that should fix the 32 bit bug where AVX instructions are available.
As the only 32bit virtual box I can access to do not offer AVX instruction, I could not replicate the bug and confirm that the patch fixes it.
I'm therefore waiting for Volker's confirmation before pushing it upstream.

As for the givaro OS X issue. I'll report it and look at it once we have a OSX box set up on our CI that we are currently building up.

You mean, adding it to build/pkg/fflas-ffpack/patches and having the spkg-install of apply the patch ? Just asking confirmation before touching it as this change will be very temporary.

> We have the buildbot to test tickets, why not use it.

I don't know how to use the buildbot for ticket related to spkg installs (i.e. how to tell buildbot where to download the tarball).

More precisely, the C++11 issue I'm having is, as I asked #21185#comment:14, to know whether with cygwin, we should still change the `--std=c++11` in `--std=gnu++11`, as was done in #21185.
If so, I'm suggesting to have

```
if [ "$UNAME" = CYGWIN ]; then
     CXXFLAGS="$CXXFLAGS -std=gnu++11"
fi
```
in spkg-install in case we need it or add nothing.
Any help from someone with access to and knowledge on this cygwin bug very welcome.

This was a weird coercion bug : `ArithmeticError` was thrown but never caught while trying to coerce an element of GF(7) over GF(16).
Not sure exactly why this bug was not triggered before.

Above commits adds a catch for this `ArithmeticError` and raises a `TypeError` which seemed to me to be the most natural way to handle it (instead of e.g. adding a catch for `ArithmeticError` in `parent.pyx:1317`).

FWIW, `ptestlong` passes for me on x86_64 (Haswell Xeon) with GCC 6.2, despite a bunch of also not-so-harmless looking warnings, like for macro redefinitions from apparently different files...  (Haven't investigated where they really originate from, just noticed them during rebuild.)

Not sure whether passing things like `-mmmx` :-) (and `-msse*` when AVX[2] is available) on a 64-bit machine is *the right thing<sup>TM</sup>*.

or **any** Debian and Ubuntu GCC... ;-)  [although someone just reported Sage's GCC doesn't build with some distro's 6.1.1, but that was on Arch Linux IIRC]

(Not the first time they cause trouble, and sometimes they won't even fix bugs / release versions with existing bugfixes.)

P.S.:  The most recent version of Sage I had built with GCC 4.9.2 is 6.10.beta6. :-)

Just pulled from here and started a (re)build (probably an upgrade adventure; I so far at least had to set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` because `sage-uncompress-spkg` was replaced by a Python script...)

Indeed, with vanilla GCC 4.9.2, I'm getting the same errors for FFLAS-FFPACK.

But Debian should know that .3 and .4 are *bugfix* releases in the 4.9 series...

Sage with the branch on this ticket does build on Arch with gcc 6.1.1
(that's what I have on my shiny new Thinkpad X1 Carbon (4th gen.) :-))

I did't try without this branch...

The machine supports AVX2 (and BMI/BMI2), but GCC 4.9 only supports the former.

Do you want me to retry without `-fpermissive` and configuring FFLAS-FFPACK `--without-avx`?

(The Sage library is still building...)

Ok, I could push a patched branch, if no-one else does.

(`Sage build/upgrade complete!`)

Haven't run tests though, docbuilding in progress...

Well I could test with some vanilla GCC 4.8, but Ubuntu 14.04.x LTS has some 4.8.2-ubuntu-something, so probably a buildbot could as well.

Ok, with `gcc (Ubuntu 4.8.2-19ubuntu1) 4.8.2` on Ubuntu 14.04 x86_64 (machine *without* AVX) `ptestlong` passed (modulo few known, unrelated issues).

Same with vanilla FSF GCC 4.8.5 on a machine *with* AVX2.

I didn't (have to) pass `-fpermissive` in either case, so that's apparently only needed for GCC 4.9 <= 4.9.2.

Darn the `configure.ac` is so confusing and the `macro` folder so full of unused stuff that I got the configuration wrong. It looks like we just have `--{en,dis}able-simd` no granularity.

Indeed, there is no granularity.

There is no such option for the moment in fflas-ffpack. Given the fact that with a fat binary, the user will get a BLAS compiled for nehalem (very slow), I see almost no interest in terms of effciency to get the sse4 options turned on in fflas-ffpack when building for x86_64.

The mess in all the simd/sse checking macros comes partly from the fact that the  standard macro ax_x86_features only work on x86 architectures.

Probably due to a further (`configure`) issue with MAPLE:

```
checking for MAPLE >= 9.0... ./configure: line 18187: /bin/maple.system.type: No such file or directory
./configure: line 18198: /bin/maple: No such file or directory

./configure: line 18201: test: -lt: unary operator expected
found
./configure: line 18219: test: -ge: unary operator expected
checking whether to compile the SAGE interface... yes
```
This time there's no `found` though, but interestingly the header file `linbox/field/givaro.h` exists...

I don't have MAPLE installed, but regardless of whether I pass `--without-maple`, `--with-maple=no`, or nothing (related), I'm always getting

```
checking for MAPLE >= 9.0... not found
```
so I'm not sure if that option works at all; `--with-maple=no` is said to be the default anyway:

```
  --with-maple=<path>|yes|no
                          Use Maple library. If argument is no, you do not
                          have the library installed on your machine (set as
                          default). If argument is yes or <empty> that means
                          the library is well installed and so reachable.
                          Otherwise you give the <path> to the directory which
                          contains the Software.

`linbox` has plenty of useless check (stuff that it is not using "yet") that's one of them. Because of this `m4rie` is not a dependency of `linbox` and yes sometimes it won't be found.

you don't need this file physically; one does monkey-patching, as done in many Sage packages; create a directory patches/ in build/pkgs/linbox/, and put the patch above there. Then you also need to add a "patch block" to spkg-install somewhere near the top of spkg-install:

```
    # Apply all patches
    for patch in patches/*.patch; do
        [ -r "$patch" ] || continue  # Skip non-existing or non-readable patches
        echo "Applying $patch"
        patch -p1 <"$patch"
        if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
            echo >&2 "Error applying '$patch'"
            return 1
        fi
    done
}
```
 
I wonder why there is no default functionality for this, for this block is in dozens of spkg-install files...

Sorry, I thought it was obvious, although I could in addition have attached the patch (to simply be applied from `$SAGE_ROOT`), but forgot.

\\

No, it's **one** patch which

* modifies LinBox's `spkg-install` (the "patch loop" is already there by the way)

* creates a patch to LinBox's `configure` which will be applied (by `spkg-install`) when reinstalling LinBox.

In other words, `cd $SAGE_ROOT && patch -p1 < inline_patch_from_the_comment_above.patch`, then `./sage -f linbox && make`.

Erik B. has a ticket for this, don't know the number right know (probably search for "apply-patches").

I'm not sure it's coming from `library_order_list`.  For example linbox.cpp contains:

That's because the library order is changed *after* that metadata is written to the `.cpp` file. If you want to check the real library order, look at the `gcc` command line.
