As reported on [this ask question](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/24412/integral-from-sin-at-plus-minus-infinity-seems-to-be-bad/?answer=24413#post-id-24413), Maxima seems to know that integrating an odd function between two opposite endpoints leads to zero, however it applies this rule even when the integral is not defined:

```
sage: integrate(sin(x), x, -oo, oo)
0
sage: integrate(tan(x), x, -oo, oo)
0
```

However,

```
sage: integrate(arctan(x), x, -oo, oo)
ValueError: Integral is divergent.
```

I've reported this upstream [here](https://sourceforge.net/p/maxima/bugs/2819/).  You are right that this is not the usual definition of such an improper integral - though of course sometimes it's fun to mess with students this way!
