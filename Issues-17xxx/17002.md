A poset is chain if |V|-1=|E|, no vertex has out-degree >1 and no vertex has in-degree >1. Hence after #16984 it can be further simplified. Also `maximal_elements` and `minimal_elements` can use just `sources` and `sinks`.

<a id='comment:4'></a>Hellooooo !

I agree with everything in your patch but added a small commit at public/17002 to rewrite `is_chain` more compactly.

If you see no problem with that, please change this ticket's branch and set it to `positive_review`. Oh, and fill the "author" field too.

Thanks for this patch !
