Dealing with polynomial rings is nice, but the fact that they always present their content in fully expanded form can make it hard to read results. For a single polynomial, computing its factorization can help. But for e.g. a vector or matrix composed of factorizations, this is not possible.

```
sage: R.<a,b> = QQ[]
sage: m = matrix([[a^2-b^2, a^3-a*b^2], [a*b + b^2, -77*a+77*b]])
sage: factor(m[0,0])
(a - b) * (a + b)
sage: m.apply_map(factor)
TypeError: x must be a list
sage: SR(factor(m[0,0]))
TypeError: 
sage: m.apply_map(lambda x: SR(str(factor(x))))
[  (a + b)*(a - b) (a + b)*(a - b)*a]
[        (a + b)*b      -77*a + 77*b]
sage: m[1,1].factor()
(-77) * (a - b)
```

It would be nice if the `apply_map(factor)` call would simply work, returning a matrix of symbolic expressions to help reading that matrix. The detour via `str` is a very hackish workaround, in my opinion.

Note that SR will automatically expand some things, as evidenced by the coeffcicient 77 in the example above. I guess that could only be avoided if we could have matrices of factorizations. That would be a viable alternative, and might be worth its own ticket, but I think coercion to SR might have other benefits as well, so this ticket here is about that coercion.

Well it doesn't work with integers, either:

```
sage: m = matrix([[6,15], [35,49]])
sage: m.apply_map(factor)
...
```
and so is clearly not a problem of this ticket.

Of course you need to explicitly cast to `SR` (like you did in the ticket description):

```
sage: R.<a,b> = QQ[]
sage: m = matrix([[a^2-b^2, a^3-a*b^2], [a*b + b^2, -77*a+77*b]])
sage: f = lambda n: SR(factor(n))
sage: m.apply_map(f)
[   (a + b)*(a - b) -(a + b)*(a - b)*a]
[         (a + b)*b              a - b]
```
It's just that the string crutch is no longer needed.

It seems that the following, using SR's "factor", works pretty well for the problem in the question:

```
sage: factor(SR(m))
[  (a + b)*(a - b) (a + b)*(a - b)*a]
[        (a + b)*b      -77*a + 77*b]
```
The problem with doing it the other way around is that the intermediate result would have to be a matrix with elements coming from ... Factorization? While we could have that, it would require a significant design and refactoring effort. Do we have a good reason to do that?

With factorizations themselves convertible to SR (which is quite reasonable and easy to do, as rws shows) one can do:

```
matrix(SR,m.nrows(),m.ncols(),[SR(factor(c)) for c in m.list()])
```
which is not hacky, albeit a bit verbose. It's basically "apply_map" spelled out.

Is there any real obstacle to making Factorizations Elements of their universe()?

When the universe *is* a ring, `+` could always return a “normal” element. In other words: what I'm suggesting is not to have “Factorizations over Foo” as a new parent, but to make Factorizations over Foo (an alternative representation of) elements *of Foo*.
