```
sage: Polyhedron(ambient_dim=0, ieqs=[], eqns=[], base_ring=QQ)
The empty polyhedron in QQ^0
```
This should be a one-point polyhedron.

```
sage: Polyhedron(ambient_dim=2, ieqs=[], eqns=[], base_ring=QQ)
The empty polyhedron in QQ^2
```
This should be the whole QQ^2.

```
sage: Polyhedron(ambient_dim=2, vertices=[], rays=[], lines=[], base_ring=QQ)
The empty polyhedron in QQ^2
```
This is correct, but only because the code misunderstands the empty V-representation as no V-representation given at all.

Even if it's not good style to distinguish between `None` and `[]`, I think it is fine to distinguish between a provided keyword argument and a not-provided keyword argument. 

So perhaps we should just change the default value of eqns from `None` to some unique value such as `"not_given"`.

Then users who want to explicitly pass an empty list of eqns could either pass `eqns=None` or `eqns=[]`.

TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not iterable

sage: for x in []:
....:     print("hi")
sage: for x in None:
....:     print("hi")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

```
They are completely different objects in Python. Other languages behave in the same way for their list-like objects and equivalent of `NULL`.

I agree that it can be useful to have `[]` and `None` behave the same way, but it is not good practice to say we should not distinguish between the two. `None` is also faster, easier, and safer to work with than some other (essentially equally) generic input.

I took the half-backed fix and did some changes that seem to make it work.

It seems that fixing this ticket implies a fixing #28654. The verification of the double description for backend `field` relied on mistreatment of empty input (or fixing #28654).

I think if vertices is `None` then it makes sense to add a vertex.

However, if vertices is `[]` and there are Rays or Lines, maybe it makes sense to throw an error. The user specifically stated that there are no vertices, so the input doesn't make any sense.
