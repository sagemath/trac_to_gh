```
sage: Polyhedron(ambient_dim=0, ieqs=[], eqns=[], base_ring=QQ)
The empty polyhedron in QQ^0
```
This should be a one-point polyhedron.

```
sage: Polyhedron(ambient_dim=2, ieqs=[], eqns=[], base_ring=QQ)
The empty polyhedron in QQ^2
```
This should be the whole QQ^2.

```
sage: Polyhedron(ambient_dim=2, vertices=[], rays=[], lines=[], base_ring=QQ)
The empty polyhedron in QQ^2
```
This is correct, but only because the code misunderstands the empty V-representation as no V-representation given at all.

This is fine with your example, empty vertex list = empty polygon. Unless you mean a non-compact 2-d polyhedron.

I agree that there is perhaps too much DWIM but its also very convenient for interactive use. If you just specify a bunch of rays then in 99% of the cases you want a cone, not some rule thumping about missing a vertex.

<a id='comment:9'></a>Even if it's not good style to distinguish between `None` and `[]`, I think it is fine to distinguish between a provided keyword argument and a not-provided keyword argument. 

So perhaps we should just change the default value of eqns from `None` to some unique value such as `"not_given"`.

Then users who want to explicitly pass an empty list of eqns could either pass `eqns=None` or `eqns=[]`.

They are completely different objects in Python. Other languages behave in the same way for their list-like objects and equivalent of `NULL`.

I agree that it can be useful to have `[]` and `None` behave the same way, but it is not good practice to say we should not distinguish between the two. `None` is also faster, easier, and safer to work with than some other (essentially equally) generic input.

It seems that fixing this ticket implies a fixing #28654. The verification of the double description for backend `field` relied on mistreatment of empty input (or fixing #28654).

<a id='comment:19'></a>I guess it is just convention, to add a vertex, when rays and lines are given, but no vertex.
I don't really care about that convention one way or the other. I just left it the way it is.

I don't understand what part is computationally hard.
