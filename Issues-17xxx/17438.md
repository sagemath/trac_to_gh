The ticket asks for
* adding a `sparse` parameter to `Expression.coefficients()`, default `True`
* removing/deprecating the `coeff` and `coeffs` aliases
* implement `Expression.list()`, simply calling `coefficients(sparse=False)`

This appears to be consensus for polynomials in the thread https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!topic/sage-devel/IHirUHTWnuA

I'm looking at this now. I'm sorry for the delay; I only finished traveling this past weekend.

Unfortunately, it looks like the delay will take even longer, because after checking out your branch, Sage wants to recompile every blessed Cython file... as usual... and it just failed on 'sage/algebras/quatalg/quaternion_algebra_cython.pyx'. Great.

Any ideas?

I can understand the rationale behind this `ValueError`. Yet, couldn't this be useful in some cases to have a dense list of coefficients, even if the first one is not the constant coefficient? In some sense, since the user has to specify `sparse=dense`, she knows what she is doing. I feel like it is better not to raise exceptions when a meaningful (and not too misleading) answer exists.

Lots of people recommend it, but the Developer's Guide doesn't ("you'll have to learn git eventually, anyway, so why not start now?") and I'm actually working with other projects that use git (though not very much yet, & not very in-depth... just commit & push mostly).

That is actually not `git-trac` but using git with the argument `trac` (which is set in your `.git/config`.

It may well be that you will only appreciate the `git-trac` tool when you're more familiar with git and Sage. For why `git pull` is done: as developer you always want to work in your own projects with the newest code---this does a sync with the repo.
