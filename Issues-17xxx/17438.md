The ticket asks for
* adding a `sparse` parameter to `Expression.coefficients()`, default `True`
* removing/deprecating the `coeff` and `coeffs` aliases
* implement `Expression.list()`, simply calling `coefficients(sparse=False)`

This appears to be consensus for polynomials in the thread https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!topic/sage-devel/IHirUHTWnuA

I'm looking at this now. I'm sorry for the delay; I only finished traveling this past weekend.

Unfortunately, it looks like the delay will take even longer, because after checking out your branch, Sage wants to recompile every blessed Cython file... as usual... and it just failed on 'sage/algebras/quatalg/quaternion_algebra_cython.pyx'. Great.

Any ideas?

Whatever version you had, now you have 6.5beta2. Whenever you `git trac checkout 17438` you will have the version that I was using on upload, i.e., 6.5beta1.\n\n\nOK, yes, I have a master; I have a develop; I had switched to develop (`checkout develop`) & recompiled. But I did not do a `git pull`, because the developer's manual says nothing* about that, aside from pulling, say, a particular branch (which is what I did: I pulled your branch, and compilation failed). Also, the Sage Developer's Guide says to create a new branch for a ticket (`git checkout` **`-b`** `my_branch FETCH_HEAD`) so that's what I did. Was that wrong, too?\n\n> The best strategy for you with an old clone would be to pull HEAD (=6.5beta2), `make clean; make` then `git trac checkout 17438`, and now NOT `make` but `sage -b`.

Highly recommended.\n\n\nLots of people recommend it, but the Developer's Guide doesn't (\"you'll have to learn git eventually, anyway, so why not start now?\") and I'm actually working with other projects that use git (though not very much yet, & not very in-depth... just commit & push mostly).\n\n*I now see that it says nothing about that *in the section on checking out tickets.* In the section on *getting changes* it tells the reader, `git pull trac u/user/description`. Not sure if this is a contradiction, or something to be done sequentially, but I didn't infer that it was to be done sequentially, if so. So that could explain something.",

> Given you have cloned `github.com/sagemath/sage` twice (master, develop) you checkout develop and say `git pull`. Whatever version you had, now you have 6.5beta2. Whenever you `git trac checkout 17438` you will have the version that I was using on upload, i.e., 6.5beta1.


OK, yes, I have a master; I have a develop; I had switched to develop (`checkout develop`) & recompiled. But I did not do a `git pull`, because the developer's manual says nothing* about that, aside from pulling, say, a particular branch (which is what I did: I pulled your branch, and compilation failed). Also, the Sage Developer's Guide says to create a new branch for a ticket (`git checkout` **`-b`** `my_branch FETCH_HEAD`) so that's what I did. Was that wrong, too?

> The best strategy for you with an old clone would be to pull HEAD (=6.5beta2), `make clean; make` then `git trac checkout 17438`, and now NOT `make` but `sage -b`. Also, installing ccache is very very recommended.


I could try that, though right now I have 6.5beta1 compiling, so I might as well stick with that for the time being.

> Did I say that without `git-trac` development is tedious? Highly recommended.


Lots of people recommend it, but the Developer's Guide doesn't ("you'll have to learn git eventually, anyway, so why not start now?") and I'm actually working with other projects that use git (though not very much yet, & not very in-depth... just commit & push mostly).

*I now see that it says nothing about that *in the section on checking out tickets.* In the section on *getting changes* it tells the reader, `git pull trac u/user/description`. Not sure if this is a contradiction, or something to be done sequentially, but I didn't infer that it was to be done sequentially, if so. So that could explain something.

That is actually not `git-trac` but using git with the argument `trac` (which is set in your `.git/config`.

It may well be that you will only appreciate the `git-trac` tool when you're more familiar with git and Sage. For why `git pull` is done: as developer you always want to work in your own projects with the newest code---this does a sync with the repo.
