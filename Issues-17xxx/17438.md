The ticket asks for
* adding a `sparse` parameter to `Expression.coefficients()`, default `True`
* removing/deprecating the `coeff` and `coeffs` aliases
* implement `Expression.list()`, simply calling `coefficients(sparse=False)`

This appears to be consensus for polynomials in the thread https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!topic/sage-devel/IHirUHTWnuA 


Keywords: **list, polynomial, coeff**

I'm looking at this now. I'm sorry for the delay; I only finished traveling this past weekend.

Unfortunately, it looks like the delay will take even longer, because after checking out your branch, Sage wants to recompile every blessed Cython file... as usual... and it just failed on 'sage/algebras/quatalg/quaternion_algebra_cython.pyx'. Great.

Any ideas?

I can understand the rationale behind this `ValueError`. Yet, couldn't this be useful in some cases to have a dense list of coefficients, even if the first one is not the constant coefficient? In some sense, since the user has to specify `sparse=dense`, she knows what she is doing. I feel like it is better not to raise exceptions when a meaningful (and not too misleading) answer exists.

Yet, I just checked the situation for Laurent polynomials and it appears that only the list of nonzero coefficients can be computed. That is the implementation you propose is consistent with the case of Laurent polynomials.

Given you have cloned `github.com/sagemath/sage` twice (master, develop) you checkout develop and say `git pull`. Whatever version you had, now you have 6.5beta2. Whenever you `git trac checkout 17438` you will have the version that I was using on upload, i.e., 6.5beta1.

The best strategy for you with an old clone would be to pull HEAD (=6.5beta2), `make clean; make` then `git trac checkout 17438`, and now NOT `make` but `sage -b`. Also, installing ccache is very very recommended.

That is actually not `git-trac` but using git with the argument `trac` (which is set in your `.git/config`.

It may well be that you will only appreciate the `git-trac` tool when you're more familiar with git and Sage. For why `git pull` is done: as developer you always want to work in your own projects with the newest code---this does a sync with the repo.
