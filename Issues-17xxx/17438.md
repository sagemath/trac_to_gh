The ticket asks for
* adding a `sparse` parameter to `Expression.coefficients()`, default `True`
* removing/deprecating the `coeff` and `coeffs` aliases
* implement `Expression.list()`, simply calling `coefficients(sparse=False)`

This appears to be consensus for polynomials in the thread https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!topic/sage-devel/IHirUHTWnuA 


Keywords: list, polynomial, coeff

Unfortunately, it looks like the delay will take even longer, because after checking out your branch, Sage wants to recompile every blessed Cython file... as usual... and it just failed on 'sage/algebras/quatalg/quaternion_algebra_cython.pyx'. Great.

Any ideas?

Lots of people recommend it, but the Developer's Guide doesn't ("you'll have to learn git eventually, anyway, so why not start now?") and I'm actually working with other projects that use git (though not very much yet, & not very in-depth... just commit & push mostly).

No, there are several ways to skin a cat.

That is actually not `git-trac` but using git with the argument `trac` (which is set in your `.git/config`.

It may well be that you will only appreciate the `git-trac` tool when you're more familiar with git and Sage. For why `git pull` is done: as developer you always want to work in your own projects with the newest code---this does a sync with the repo.

I rechecked that all changed code in this ticket concerns symbolic expressions. Merging would only be necessary in case of merge conflict or a dependency on that code. But the `rings/` code is completely independent of the `symbolics/` code, as far as I know (and it should be).
