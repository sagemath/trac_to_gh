```
sage: random_matrix(GF(2), 8, 586, sparse=True).visualize_structure()
IndexError: image index out of range
```

Solution: remove this specialized implementation, since the general one from `Matrix` works just fine.

In the generic `visualize_structure()` method, we change `int` -> `Py_ssize_t` to support matrices larger than 2^31.

I can't even create a matrix with a dimension >= `2^31`:

```
sage: m = matrix(GF(2), 2**30, 1, {})
Killed: 9
```
So I can't test the second part of this. The first part looks good.
