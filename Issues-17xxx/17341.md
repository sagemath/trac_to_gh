sage: random_matrix(GF(2), 8, 586, sparse=True).visualize_structure()
IndexError: image index out of range
```

Solution: remove this specialized implementation, since the general one from `Matrix` works just fine.

In the generic `visualize_structure()` method, we change `int` -> `Py_ssize_t` to support matrices larger than 2^31.
