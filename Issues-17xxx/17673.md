Currently

```
sage: from sage.structure.element import coerce_binop
sage: @coerce_binop
....: def f(a,b): return a+b
sage: f.__module__
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
AttributeError: ...
sage: f.__name__
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
AttributeError: ...
```
and with the branch

```
sage: from sage.structure.element import coerce_binop
sage: @coerce_binop
....: def f(a,b): return a+b
sage: f.__module__
'__main__'
sage: f.__name__
'f'
```

That way methods with this decorator will looks like method. In particular it will not break introspection (e.g. access to the documentation with ? and to the source code with ??).
