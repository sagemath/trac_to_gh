```
Modulo gcc 4.9, of course, though in principle one could ask for a message asking to build gcc 4.7 first.

We need the following
* This is not supported by at least some shells.

```
if [[ "$1" =~ "--notebook="* || "$1" =~ "-n="* || "$1" =~ "-notebook="* ]]; then
    sage-cleaner &>/dev/null &
    exec sage-notebook "$@"
fi
```
  including

```
$ bash --version
GNU bash, version 2.05b.0(1)-release (powerpc-apple-darwin8.0)
Copyright (C) 2002 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
```
* Need to put back in the pyzmq patch to avoid `-arch` flag on our gcc, at least for very old indeed Mac - #17510.
* iml upgrade seems to have removed something for this system. We can add something along the lines of

```
EXTRA_BLAS=""
if [ $UNAME = "Darwin" ]; then
    # copy cblas headers from gsl
    cp ../patches/gsl_cblas.h cblas.h
    EXTRA_BLAS="--with-cblas=-lgslcblas"
fi
```
  to fix this.
* Do something about #16044, even if it is to tacitly let it build on this platform without having to do `make -k`.

I think I have given up.  I did make the Sage 6.4.1 binaries and that should make people happy for a while, so I guess one could even say I was partly successful with this ticket.

Everything is still documented here in case someone else wanted to try for a newer Sage, also - I really don't think it would be that hard except for the gcc issue.  Apparently #19370 fixes #16044, which is nice.  I'm not sure if #17510 is only for this platform or not.
