SymmetricGroup(6).minimal_generating_set()
RuntimeError: Gap produced error output
Error, `MinimalGeneratingSet' currently assumes that the group must be solvable.
In general, try `SmallGeneratingSet' instead, which returns a generating
set that is small but not of guarateed smallest cardinality

   executing MinimalGeneratingSet($sage1);
```
Gap's error is okay, but the thing at the end is confusing and may send some readers astray.  Anyway, we should probably catch this error and say something like input or value error in such cases.

**Status:** new

Or maybe this is just how Gap's errors are handled?  Seems to be sandwiching the Python error.

Hello!
I'm working on this ticket. We can parse an exception message, raised by `RuntimeError`, check for `MinimalGeneratingSet` text inside it and produce something more appropriate for a user. What do you think? Is it appropriate solution?

Maybe it's enough to put the error message at the END of the Python-generated message.  ?
