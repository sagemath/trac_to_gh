The current "interval_iterator" only iterates over strict intervals.

This is confusing and not coherent with the natural and well-established mathematical convention that includes all singletons [x,x] in the set of intervals.

I propose to rename that method to "strict_interval_iterator", deprecate it and then maybe later redirect it to the current "relations_iterator", that does the job.

I also introduce a new method "interval_number" that just counts the intervals.

Yes, the same. Still slower by summing over the matrix.

For a poset with 429 elements, with lequal_matrix precomputed, first with `_hasse_diagram.lequal_matrix`:

```
sage: %timeit interval_number1(P)
10 loops, best of 3: 84.3 ms per loop
```
then with search in hasse diagram:

```
sage: %timeit interval_number(P)

Confirmed with 1024-element Boolean lattice. We must make Nathann to optimize matrix code also, not only static graph backend. `:=)`. Actually I don't know if Sage has good support for matrices over booleans or plain ints. It seems unnecessary to have a matrix of `Integer`s when you only store zeros and ones.

Why you do `hd = self.hasse_diagram()`? Would be faster to say `hd = self._hasse_diagram`.

Actually I don't know if Sage has good support for matrices over booleans or plain ints. It seems unnecessary to have a matrix of `Integer`s when you only store zeros and ones.


Well, I needed that at some point: sage/misc/binary_matrix.pxi

A place for improvement in `hasse_diagram.py`?

`_leq_matrix` is directly referenced only twice. I don't know if it would be faster to invert it for getting möbius function matrix by converting it to scipy or numpy matrix. And at least memory would be saved if we save bits when we need bits and not integers. Actually we could have upper triangle of matrix to be lequal-matrix and lower triangle to be möbius-matrix.

And bit matrix could count ones by `POPCNT` instruction. `:=)`.

...and sorry for off-topic.

Hello,

I did some work, in particular using always 'relations_' instead of 'intervals_' (which are still there as simple aliases) and introducing an alternative algorithm in 'relations_iterator'. It indeed seems to be faster than the existing matrix search. Either it can be kept as the only algo, or we can propose the choice with the previous algorithm ?

Hello !

Right now the code looks weird as you added a 'algorithm' flag without documentation. Also, it seems that one algorithm can only be used when strict is False, which is not really justified (enumerating all [x,x] intervals can be done manually).

And I still do not see the point of this `chains().elements_of_depth_iterator(2)`.

About keeping different algorithms: given that this algorithm is not very complicated I would personally keep only one (we don't need two to double-check the result) but it depends on the developper I guess, so do as you like. It just needs to be documented if you keep everything.

Also: is there any reason why you seem to avoid using the algorithm of `relations_numbers` in `relations_iterator` ?

Helloooooooo !

Well, there was a couple of things I thought needed fixing:

1) Adding the aliases in the index of functions

2) Not build a list only to compute its length

I also removed a comment in the doc about the ordering of the intervals which does not hold anymore.

If you agree with the commit at public/17354, you can change the ticket's status.

Thanks,

Nathann
