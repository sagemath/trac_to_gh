#15339 was closed too fast.
The tuning of gf2x is still problematic on Cygwin32 (but not Cygwin64) on Windows Vista+.

The easiest way to go is not to tune gf2x: set `SAGE_TUNE_GF2X=no` in `spkg-install`.

Just for the record (and to cc me):

It seems they're currently preparing gf2x 1.2...

(I'm currently struggling with GCC 5.1 and gf2x; both gf2x 1.1 and the git version fail to build / in tuning or make check, although in different ways...)

I've just opened #18339 for a fat bug in gf2x's `make check`, just adding a patch to an upstream shell script and documenting it (also) in `SPKG.txt`.

Would be nice if one of you could review it... :P

(I'm also not sure whether I should bump the patch level there.)
