New spkg: http://www.risc.jku.at/research/combinat/software/ore_algebra/ore_algebra-0.2.spkg

This should be copied to the mirrors. Since it is an old-style spkg, no modifications to Sage are needed.

Upstream: **Fixed upstream, in a later stable release.**

You should be able to fix this by changing the line

in the file `/home/zieglerk/local/share/sage/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/ore_algebra/guessing.py` to

```

So we should be able to solve this by upgrading to version 0.2. I took a look at 0.2, and it imports without breaking. Not everything works, though, and I wish it had functioning doctests or a functioning test suite, or both. A quick example, taken from the file `nullspace.py`:

```
sage: from ore_algebra.nullspace import *
sage: my_solver = cra(kronecker(gauss()))
sage: A = MatrixSpace(ZZ['x', 'y'], 4, 5).random_element()
sage: V = my_solver(A)
```
produces a `TypeError` for me (with Sage 6.5.beta0):

```
TypeError: x must be one of the generators of the parent.
```
Oh well. Let's upgrade on this ticket. Later on, we might consider changing this to a new-style spkg, but that can wait.

Shall I give this a positive review?

Hi there! 

I have been using Sage 6.1.1 until a few weeks ago, and version 0.1 of the package works properly in this version, at least for me. For Sage 6.3, as far as I see the only necessary change was the new location of is_FiniteField. With this being fixed in version 0.2, I am not aware of other problems for 6.3. If you know of any, I'd be happy to hear about them so that I can fix them too. Naturally, without having access to 6.5.beta0, I can't easily see what causes the TypeError in the nullspace module. 

In general, I must admit that the general workflow is not really clear to me. Is it explained somewhere what would be the right steps for me to take if I want to propagate updates I do to the ore_algebra package regularly to the version which is included in Sage? I also don't know what "new-style" packages are. 

Thanks & Greetings,
Manuel

Now I can reproduce it. When I tried it yesterday, something must have been different so that it went through without problem. The problem seems to be that the value of sage.ext.multi_modular.MAX_MODULUS has increased a few versions ago (perhaps between 5.9 and 6?), in combination with the following inconsistency:\n\n  sage: x, y = ZZ['x','y'].gens()\n  sage: GF(1091)['x','y'].random_element().degree(x) ### works\n  sage: GF(3037000453)['x','y'].random_element().degree(x) ### fails\n\nPerhaps this should be fixed in the code of multivariate polynomial rings rather than by a workaround in nullspace.py?\n\n@kcrisman: thanks for the pointer to the documentation.

Replying to [@jhpalmieri](#comment%3A14):
> For what it's worth, I see the same error in Sage 6.1 and Sage 6.2, using version 0.1 of the spkg and the lines from [comment:4]:
> So either I'm doing something wrong (in which case the example in `nullspace.py` is wrong, or at least unclear) or there is a bug.

Thanks for insisting. Now I can reproduce it. When I tried it yesterday, something must have been different so that it went through without problem. The problem seems to be that the value of sage.ext.multi_modular.MAX_MODULUS has increased a few versions ago (perhaps between 5.9 and 6?), in combination with the following inconsistency:

  sage: x, y = ZZ['x','y'].gens()
  sage: GF(1091)['x','y'].random_element().degree(x) ### works
  sage: GF(3037000453)['x','y'].random_element().degree(x) ### fails

Perhaps this should be fixed in the code of multivariate polynomial rings rather than by a workaround in nullspace.py?

@kcrisman: thanks for the pointer to the documentation. I will include self-testing routines in future versions.

Okay, I think we can merge this. A test suite of some sort should be possible, and I'm glad you're going to work on it for a future release.

This is certainly inconsistent, but I'm not sure whether both should work or both should fail. Should x automatically be coerced to an element of the polynomial ring over GF(p)? I've posted a question on sage-devel, and eventually we should open a ticket about it.
