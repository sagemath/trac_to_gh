Based on *The Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomial of a matroid* by Ben Elias, Nicholas Proudfoot, and Max Wakefield by recently posted to the arXiv (1412.7408), this implements their results for general graded lattices. In particular, this implements the Mobius algebra, and it's q-deformation (which I've coined as the quantum Mobius algebra). This also implements KL polynomials for general graded posets.

In particular, you can use #14786 and recover the KL polynomials. However the code in its current state is quite slow (most of the time is spent constructing the digraphs for the posets), but faster implementations can be done on followup tickets.

Still need to play around with the code, once I wrap my head around everything, but a few preliminary comments:

* E and C bases for quantum mobius algebras just say that they're bases for mobius algebras in the docstring (KL does specify quantum mobius algebra).
* Throw in the word 'principal' when referring to `I_x` and `F^x` being the order ideal and filter associated to x, just to make it clear.
* I think the assumptions related to `kazhdan_lusztig_polynomial()` need to be cleaned up some. The docstring says it's defined for a graded, bounded poset. The paper makes me think it should only be defined for geometric lattices (ie, corresponding to a matroid). And the code only checks to see if the poset is ranked.
