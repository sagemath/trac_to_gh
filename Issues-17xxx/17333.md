The update itself is trivial.
Upstream tarball at:
* http://download.zeromq.org/zeromq-4.0.5.tar.gz

This also fixes a C++ linking issue:
* https://github.com/zeromq/pyzmq/issues/113
* https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/issues/1236
and ensure that -no-undefined is passed to libtool to build a shared lib (or later on pyzmq will fail to build...) on Cygwin.
