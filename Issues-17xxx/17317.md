This ticket implements a `unit_group()` method for **Z**/*n***Z**.  Example:

```
sage: A = Zmod(24)
sage: G = A.unit_group(); G
Multiplicative Abelian group isomorphic to C2 x C2 x C2
sage: G.gens_orders()
(2, 2, 2)
sage: G.gens_values()
(7, 13, 17)
```

At the moment, there is no new class for such groups; it uses `AbelianGroupWithValues`.  However, this could easily be changed in the future if required.

The `unit_group()` method admits an optional `algorithm` argument (default: `'sage'`).  This can be set to `'pari'` to use PARI's `znstar()` function (see #17315).  This gives different generators in general.

<a id='comment:3'></a>First impressions:

1. I find the examples in the doctest all rather simple. It doesn't really show how different the `algorithm="sage"` and `algorithm="pari"` can be. I would add `Zmod(319)` as example. Also a larger example, say `Zmod(lcm([1..40]))` or so...

2. I would add a `**kwds` argument to `unit_gens()`:

```
def unit_gens(self, **kwds):
    return self.unit_group(**kwds).gens_values()
```

3. And a nitpick: I prefer to see `repr(algorithm)` in the error message, something like:

```
raise ValueError('unknown algorithm %r for computing the unit group' % algorithm)
```
This error should also be doctested in a `TESTS::` block.

But in the current case:

```
sage: Zmod(1000).unit_group()
Multiplicative Abelian group isomorphic to C2 x C2 x C100

Though we can see which ring we're working with via

```
sage: Zmod(1000).unit_group().values_group()
Ring of integers modulo 1000
```
this terminology is very non-intuitive.  I think it would be worth having a class for these groups, with a `ring` method and a more complete `_repr_`.

See #17337 and #17338.
