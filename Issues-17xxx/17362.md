E.g. something along the lines of

```
sage: D = {1:2, 2:3} # possibly random order depending on hashing
sage: E = {2:3, 1:2}
sage: sorted(D.items()) # guaranteed
[(1, 2), (2, 3)]
sage: sorted(E.items()) == sorted(D.items())
True
```
but perhaps someone might have an actual example that had to be fixed for the Sage doc to test right, I am pretty sure Trac is full of these.

Isn't this fixed by #16746?

I didn't know about that aspect of it, only the graphics part.  So will doctests automatically fail if people put them in the order that their computer gives and it's not sorted?  That could be confusing!  So maybe it should still be mentioned in the guide, along with the graphics piece - which is not what the command line gives.

And, more relevant to my immediate concern, what if the keys themselves are dictionary-enough that *they* are platform-dependent?  See #16331 for an explicit example of this.  It would be great if you could give some advice for that, because we haven't come to any useful consensus yet.

Well, #16331 is special because you're sorting a list containing integers and strings. The problem is that the output of `sorted([3,"foo"])` isn't well-defined.

Yikes, and apparently [isn't even allowed](http://www.peterbe.com/plog/sorting-mixed-type-lists-in-python-3) in Python 3.
> the IPython order is the sorted order.

Hmm, although I still think some updating could be done, I guess a ticket just for that or the graphics thing, which is now everywhere, probably isn't that worthwhile.
