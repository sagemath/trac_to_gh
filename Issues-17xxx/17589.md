This branch does small changes to the table of contents of the developer's manual. Not many, but many things to check:

- a section entitled 'randomized testing', that was actually only talking (very vaguely) about TestSuite was turned into a comment in the "Writing testable examples" section.

- A link that pointed toward it was removed, as its content did not represent what was intended by the link.

- The chapter "Git and Trac" was split into "Git for Sage development" (which is already rather long) and "Sage Trac and tickets"

I also decreased the depth of some table of contents, after checking that the subsubsections whose name disappear was clearly indicated by their parent's section's name. For this reason, I did not change the depth of some documents like "Coding in Cython", as some people may be looking explicitly for "sig_on/off/check"

Very superficial, but the page gets cleaner and cleaner.
