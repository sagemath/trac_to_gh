I think it is needed to have `._gap_()` implemented on all these wreath product constructions. I am trying to do that right now.

<a id='comment:16'></a>Comments so far:

* Make 'number_reflecting_hyperplanes' 'number_of_reflecting_hyperplanes', because that's the way permutation statistics names methods.
* Documentation should mention somewhere that \ell is the number of degrees is the rank. Some docstrings just refer to \ell, and maybe you could look back and see that \ell is the number of degrees, but then nothing mentions that the number of the degrees is the same as the rank.
* Why just left descent and not right descent?
* Colored permutations should have an inverse operation.
* There should be element constructors `ColoredPermutation` and `SignedPermutation`.
* For `m=2`, there should be a way to get between thinking of something as a `SignedPermutation` and a `ColoredPermutation`.
* Codegree documentation needs a `.. Math::` around the formula.
* Preliminary docstring/index of functions would be nice, but possibly a task for another ticket.
