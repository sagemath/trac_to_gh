Just a confirmation that with the three tickets applied all tests pass (debian 64bits).

Could you replace

```
if np.array_equal(vert1, tpath.vertices) and np.array_equal(code1, tpath.codes):
     return True
else:
     return False
```
with

```
return np.array_equal(vert1, tpath.vertices) and np.array_equal(code1, tpath.codes)
```
Or there is a reason to let it as you did?

Looking around distros that provide `arm` support I am wondering how it was building on arm before. I think none of fedora, debian or gentoo have trouble with arm but they all pass `config_fc --noarch` to `setup.py` which was done at some point in sage but has been removed a while ago.

I note from [https://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/cgit/numpy.git/tree/numpy.spec](https://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/cgit/numpy.git/tree/numpy.spec)

```
* Wed Oct 14 2015 Thomas Spura <tomspur@fedoraproject.org> - 1:1.10.1-3
- Remove fortran flags or arm would build with -march=x86-64
```

I am guessing from this that the bug is recent but because everyone but `sage` passes `--noarch` it did go unnoticed in `scipy`. I'll add it and put this back to need_review.
