```
The method .conjugacy_class is defined in too much places:
- `categories/finite_groups.py`
- `groups/matrix_gps/group_element.py`
- `groups/perm_gps/permgroup_element.pyx`
We move the basic definition on elements into the category of groups and on parents in the category of groups and `GroupMixinLibGAP`.

As a consequence much more groups beneficiate from the GAP implementation (e.g. Weyl groups).

We also implement the cardinality using `Size()` from GAP (the fallback is the useless `_cardinality_from_iterator`).

Looks good, and all tests pass.

It also seems that right now, the `__contains__` method of `ConjugacyClass` calls `.set()`, even when the group is supported by GAP. 

The more I think about inheritance, the less I like it. It does hide a lot of things that should be reimplemented properly.

Especially if the parent is completely useless ;-)
