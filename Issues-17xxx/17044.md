If you install Sage system-wide (e.g., in /usr/local) for all users on your system, most of the pexpect interfaces for optional packages will be completely massively broken.  For example, on a system which doesn't have scilab installed:

```

I would like to understand the problem better. So William, could you please
1) say which version of Sage this refers to
2) describe the actual input and error you are getting
3) if any doctests fail in your setup (without this patch)

I am asking because you're certainly not the first person ever to install Sage system-wide but it is the first time I see this problem reported. So the problem is probably more subtle than you think.

So William, could you please\n> 1) say which version of Sage this refers to\n\n\nAt least any Sage-6.x.\n\n> 2) describe the actual input and error you are getting\n\n\nInstall Sage system-wide, then try to do anything with *some* of the pexpect-based interfaces as a normal user who doesn't own the sage install, especially ones that use optional software.  E.g., \n\n sage: scilab('2+3')\n\n> 3) if any doctests fail in your setup (without this patch)\n\n\nNope.  We don't do doctesting that tests permissions, since doctesting is always run as the user that owns the Sage install.  \n\n> \n> I am asking because you're certainly not the first person ever to install Sage system-wide but it is the first time I see this problem reported. \n\n\nThis problem has popped on the mailing lists, and basically got ignored, probably because for the most part our Sage developers usually own their own Sage installs.   However, with SageMathCloud, which has now 7000 *active users* per week all using a system-wide Sage install, this problem comes up more.  I had dome some horrible hacks to try to get around it, e.g., pointing SAGE_ROOT/local/share at something world writeable, but even this fails miserable if *two* regular users use the same interface -- one creates the user directory as their own, and the other then can't write to it. \n\nI think much of this boils down to a stupid coding mistake (surely made by me) involving `=\"\"` versus `=None`.\n\n> So the problem is probably more subtle than you think.\n\n\nIt probably is.

At least any Sage-6.x.

> 2) describe the actual input and error you are getting


Install Sage system-wide, then try to do anything with *some* of the pexpect-based interfaces as a normal user who doesn't own the sage install, especially ones that use optional software.  E.g., 

 sage: scilab('2+3')

> 3) if any doctests fail in your setup (without this patch)


Nope.  We don't do doctesting that tests permissions, since doctesting is always run as the user that owns the Sage install.

> I am asking because you're certainly not the first person ever to install Sage system-wide but it is the first time I see this problem reported. 


This problem has popped on the mailing lists, and basically got ignored, probably because for the most part our Sage developers usually own their own Sage installs.   However, with SageMathCloud, which has now 7000 *active users* per week all using a system-wide Sage install, this problem comes up more.  I had dome some horrible hacks to try to get around it, e.g., pointing SAGE_ROOT/local/share at something world writeable, but even this fails miserable if *two* regular users use the same interface -- one creates the user directory as their own, and the other then can't write to it. 

I think much of this boils down to a stupid coding mistake (surely made by me) involving `=""` versus `=None`.

> So the problem is probably more subtle than you think.


It probably is.  I wouldn't be surprised at all if this small patch is not the whole story, and there are similar bugs still lurking, since any classes that derive from the base Expect class (in expect.py) could cause their own related trouble...

I meant: do any doctests fail when running doctests as the user who *doesn't* own the Sage install? That should work (see #5155), although I don't know if this is still tested on a regular basis (I did it as part of my release management scripts, I have no idea if Volker does it).

Hello,

I am not sure at all to be competent to review this ticket. As far as I can tell, this looks good.

I allowed myself to remove a few unused imports (except one which is in fact used in an indirect way) and one unused variable.

Jeroen, you can set this to positive review if you want.
