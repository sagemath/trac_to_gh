```
sage: from sage.misc.sageinspect import sage_getargspec
sage: sage_getargspec(gap)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
UnboundLocalError: local variable 'func_obj' referenced before assignment
```
This has probably been introduced in #16309.

By consequence, one cannot see the documentation or source code of `gap` (even though one can edit the source code...). I'd say this is critical.

Fixed! There is some `if ... else` clause in `sage_getargspec`, simplified as follows:

```python
if cond1:
    try:
        return answer1
    except AttributeError:
        pass
elif cond2:
    return answer2 or define func_obj
else:
    return answer3 or define func_obj
do something with func_obj
```
So, the obvious problem is that upon catching the error, we want to do something with `func_obj` but haven't defined it. Solution: Replace `elif` by `if`. Test is added, needs review...

Why did `git trac` not succeed to set the branch field after pushing my branch? Strange.

Doing it manually now.

Did you post the first commit while the script was still uploading? There is a lock in trac to not have competing changes to a ticket...
