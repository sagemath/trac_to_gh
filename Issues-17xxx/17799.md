The class `sage.sets.real_set.RealInterval` is badly named. Despite being "private" it can be easily confused in the documentation with `RealInterval=sage.rings.real_mpfi.RealIntervalFieldElement`. The ticket will rename `real_set.py:RealInterval`.

You missed this on in the docstring of `__init__`:

```
You are not supposed to create :class:`RealInterval` objects
```
Also could you also move the docstring (except the example block) up to the class level? Thanks.
