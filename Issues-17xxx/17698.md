When working with an attached file it seems that saving it (at least with 'gedit' on our file system) sometimes causes a temporarily disappearance on that file. I have no idea, if this is caused by the
used file system (mounted NFS) , but sometimes I get from sage ( at least for 6.4.beta6)

 ### detaching file /home/......./stuff.sage because it does not exist (deleted?) ###

this can be emulated by 

```
sage: attach ("~/stuff.sage")

console>  mv ~/stuff.sage /tmp/; touch /tmp/stuff.sage;  sleep 1; mv /tmp/stuff.sage ~/stuff.sage
```

Proposal 
1. add a little timeout to the detaching process (maybe already the case)
2. control the timeout by an optional timeout argument for the attach() routine

I also have the same problem on my machine since one year. The problem seems to come from the function `sage.misc.attached_files.modified_file_iterator`. There is some sleep involved:

```python
    time.sleep(0.1)  # sleep 100ms to give the editor time to finish saving
```

but it comes after checking the existence of the attached files which detach "deleted" files.

When should the sleep be better done?

Using vim, the following tip fixed that problem for me:

So it was a problem of the text editor rather than a bug in sage. Should we close this ticket?
