When working with an attached file it seems that saving it (at least with 'gedit' on our file system) sometimes causes a temporarily disappearance on that file. I have no idea, if this is caused by the
used file system (mounted NFS) , but sometimes I get from sage ( at least for 6.4.beta6)

 ### detaching file /home/......./stuff.sage because it does not exist (deleted?) ###

this can be emulated by 

```
sage: attach ("~/stuff.sage")

console>  mv ~/stuff.sage /tmp/; touch /tmp/stuff.sage;  sleep 1; mv /tmp/stuff.sage ~/stuff.sage
```

Proposal 
1. add a little timeout to the detaching process (maybe already the case)
2. control the timeout by an optional timeout argument for the attach() routine







Keywords: **attach detaching timeout**

I also have the same problem on my machine since one year. The problem seems to come from the function `sage.misc.attached_files.modified_file_iterator`. There is some sleep involved:

```python
    time.sleep(0.1)  # sleep 100ms to give the editor time to finish saving
```

but it comes after checking the existence of the attached files which detach "deleted" files.

When should the sleep be better done?
