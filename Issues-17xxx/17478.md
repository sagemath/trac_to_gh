Currently each translation/other doc that is not in English is just in a directory of some kind without a master document.  That is also sort of true for English, except that http://sagemath.org/doc/ basically points to `src/doc/en/website/index.html` (or the built version, rather).

However, this is going to soon make things a lot more unsustainable - see for instance the way in which the actual Sage website is slowly growing unmaintainable.  Plus, the main doc page shouldn't just have to have a hack in it to make a link to those directories; this should be first-class.

My suggestions are to
* Make the website live in `common`
* Make a top-level `index.rst`, possibly auto generated, such that one could do `sage -docbuild lang html` for a given value of `lang`, and it would "just work" to build all doc of that language as well as an index file, *without* getting rid of the option to do `sage -docbuild lang/document html` all by itself.

I don't know if this is possible, but I think it's important for the long-term.
