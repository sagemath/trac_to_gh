<a id='comment:2'></a>Hi Travis,

I'm getting some unexpected(?) behavior in certain cases.  For example:

```
sage: RC = crystals.infinity.RiggedConfigurations("D4")
sage: T = crystals.infinity.Tableaux("D4")
sage: Psi = RC.crystal_morphism({RC.module_generators[0]:T.module_generators[0]})
sage: RCS = RC.subcrystal(max_depth=4)
sage: for nu in RCS:                                   
....:    if Psi(nu) != T(nu):
....:        print False
....: print True
```

This produces a lot of `False` results.  By contrast, this example worked in types `"A2"`, `"A3"`, and `"A4"`.  Shouldn't the coercion agree with the usual crystal isomorphism between the two?

Best,
Ben

<a id='comment:11'></a>Okay, it all works now.

There is something somewhat subtle going on with using the type C virtualization for the crystal operators, and it makes us use the type C<sup>(1)</sup><sub>n</sub> bijection (as opposed to the A<sup>(2)</sup><sub>2n-1</sub> bijection). This is due to the different scaling factors giving rise to different representations of the crystal. I always had thought this was a possibility, but it's good to have a confirmed example:

```
sage: RCP = RiggedConfigurations(['A',7,2], [[3,1]])
sage: ascii_art(RCP.module_generators[0].f_string([3,4]))
(/)  (/)  1[ ]1  -1[ ]-1
sage: RCP = RiggedConfigurations(['C',4,1], [[3,1]])
sage: ascii_art(RCP.module_generators[0].f_string([3,4]))
(/)  (/)  0[ ]0  -1[ ]-1
```
(but there is still an isomorphism of [classical] crystals on the largest component).
