We deprecate the usage of zero_element/one_element in favor of zero/one.

To avoid duplication we also upgrade slightly the category of polyhedra.

Hello,

There are some `zero_element` that you rename to `zero` without adding a deprecated copy. I wondered if perhaps the deprecated copy was inherited, but found something weird:

```
sage: L = LazyPowerSeriesRing(QQ)
sage: L.zero # zero_element appears when you press tab
L.zero          L.zero_element  L.zero_ideal    
sage: L.zero_element()
...
AttributeError: 'LazyPowerSeriesRing' object has no attribute 'zero_element'
```

So it seems that this function, for instance, has no deprecated `zero_element`. And also that the function still appears in the tab expansion, which I cannot explain.

Nathann

The polyhedra do have a sum (Minkowski sum) and a product (cartesian product). The method `zero_element` was implemented but the category was AdditiveMagmas. So I switched to AdditiveMonoids (i.e. Magma + unit) and only rename the method `zero_element()` to `zero()`. And the ParentMethods of the category takes care of the deprecation.

For the purpose of this ticket, you only need to know that `ParentMethods` and `ElementMethods` in the categories are respectively inherited to the concrete `Parent` and `Element` (via a dirty mechanism of dynamic classes created on the fly).

An other option is to revert the changes and add a `deprecated_function_alias` inside the polyhedron class.
