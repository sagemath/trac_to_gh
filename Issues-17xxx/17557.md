Hello,

The values from `0` to `99` were already tested in a loop above. And it would be better if the specific value `v=136` is tested alone. See my commit.

It takes 3 seconds, and is way more systematic and easier to read.\n\nThanks for the speedup in steiner triple systems.\n\nNathann",

Yo !

Oh, sorry. But instead of this complicated loop with random values and the if to set the modulos right, could you just change the 100 to 400 ? It takes 3 seconds, and is way more systematic and easier to read.

Thanks for the speedup in steiner triple systems.
