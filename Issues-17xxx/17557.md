Oh, sorry. But instead of this complicated loop with random values and the if to set the modulos right, could you just change the 100 to 400 ? It takes 3 seconds, and is way more systematic and easier to read.

Thanks for the speedup in steiner triple systems.

Actually, I was wrong. The first test checks the function `v_4_1_BIBD` while the second one checks `designs.balanced_incomplete_block_design`. So it is fine to start again from `13`.
