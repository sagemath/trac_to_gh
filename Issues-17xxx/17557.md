<a id='comment:6'></a>Hello,

The values from `0` to `99` were already tested in a loop above. And it would be better if the specific value `v=136` is tested alone. See my commit.

Oh, sorry. But instead of this complicated loop with random values and the if to set the modulos right, could you just change the 100 to 400 ? It takes 3 seconds, and is way more systematic and easier to read.

Thanks for the speedup in steiner triple systems.
