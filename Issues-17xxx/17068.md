I'm preparing a brief talk on using SageTeX, and discovering that the tutorial seems to be incorrect.  

http://www.sagemath.org/doc/tutorial/sagetex.html

"The full documentation can be found in SAGE_ROOT/local/share/texmf/tex/generic/sagetex, where SAGE_ROOT is the directory where your Sage installation is located."

In fact, it refers to this for the doc a few times.  It also refers to the incorrect name for the .sage file produced, which should be st_example.sagetex.sage

The installation guide seems to be correct...

http://www.sagemath.org/doc/installation/sagetex.html

says

"While not strictly part of installation, it bears mentioning here that the documentation for SageTeX is maintained in SAGE_ROOT/local/share/doc/sagetex/sagetex.pdf. There is also an example file in the same directory â€“ see example.tex and example.pdf, the pre-built result of typesetting that file with LaTeX and Sage."

you might use this:
https://github.com/sagemath/git-trac-command

if you're very short on time, then just put the patch here, as an attachment...
