This bug was reported at http://ask.sagemath.org/question/24446/problem-with-solution_dicttrue/:

```
sage: var('x y')
(x, y)
sage: sol=solve(x + y, [x, y], solution_dict=True)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'left'
```
I think this was introduced in #16531.

<a id='comment:1'></a>The problem arises in the conversion to dictionary form. This works ok:

```
sage: var('x,y')
(x, y)
sage: solve(x+y,[x,y])
[[x == -r1, y == r1]]



```


It should be easy to fix.
