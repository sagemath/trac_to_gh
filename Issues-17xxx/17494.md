In ticket #17556 it looks like we only got the commit from Ralf's fix to the Sage Gymnasium.

I think my branch should still be good, but I can't reopen that ticket.

Sorry Volker, I think this was a false alarm. In ticket #15346 it looked like we were missing a commit from #17556. But really what happened was that one of the develop branch merges deleted lines out from under Ralf, and they wound up being added back rather than getting removed from his branch.
