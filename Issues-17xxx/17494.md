At #17435, I noticed the following:

```
sage: L.<x,y,z> = FreeAlgebra(GF(25,'t'), implementation='letterplace')
sage: p = x^4+x*y*x*z+2*z^2*x*y
sage: for i in range(20):
....:     m = get_memory_usage()
....:     for j in range(300):
....:         z = p^7
....:     print get_memory_usage()-m
....:

```
This leak even pertains when #16958 is applied.

Here is the corresponding computation in Singular (as shipped with Sage):

So, the leak is in Singular, not in the wrapper.

Replying to [@rwst](#comment%3A3):
> Maybe related: http://ask.sagemath.org/question/29444/high-memory-usage-when-substituting-variables/

I think that points to a more basic and hence more severe memory leak.

```
import gc, collections
gc.collect()
old=set( id(a) for a in gc.get_objects())
R.<x,y,z>=ZZ[]
f=12^2*(x^4+y^4)-15^2*(x^2+y^2)*z^2+350*x^2*y^2+9^2*z^4
pt=[1,2,3]
m=get_memory_usage()
for i in xrange(10^5):
    temp=f(x=x+pt[0]*z,y=y+pt[1]*z,z=pt[2]*z) #This also uses a lot of memory.
    if (i% 100) == 0:
        print get_memory_usage()-m
            
gc.collect()
new=collections.Counter( str(type(a)) for a in gc.get_objects() if id(a) not in old)
new
```
This code clearly shows leaking and it shows the leak is not in python reference counted objects. I would find it hard to believe that such a basic leak in normal polynomial arithmetic would go unnoticed in Singular, so I would expect the error is somewhere in the sage/singular interface.
