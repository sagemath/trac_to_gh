The SubgraphSearch code crashes from time to time when you Ctrl+C it during its memory allocation instructions.

This patch cleans the code a bit so that all allocations happen in one place, before the actual code is run. And so `__dealloc__` only frees the memory that has been allocated, even if the code was interrupted.

Basically, we avoid crashed only with simple code cleaning.

1) In order to produce the crash, run this and CTRL+C it immediately:

```
graphs.CompleteMultipartiteGraph([20,20,20,20]).subgraph_search(graphs.CompleteGraph(5))
```

Do it several times in a row if necessary.

2) The code could use a rewrite with bitsets. It would be faster and lighter in memory, but there is already a pretty similar code in `needs_review` at #17309 and I fear that it may take time before it is reviewed. So I will wait for this before reimplementing SubgraphSearch.

I tried the patch multiple times and got no crash, while without the patch I can get a segfault.

Install OK, long tests OK => positive review.

David.
PS: I'm changing the patch from "graphics" to "graph theory". It seems more appropriate.
