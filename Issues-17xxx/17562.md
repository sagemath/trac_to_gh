Use `get_unsafe()` and `set_unsafe()` in the generic `__getitem__` and `__setitem__` methods for free module elements (a.k.a. vectors).

This should also fix

```
sage: v=vector(RR,range(6),sparse=True)
sage: v[::2]
(0.000000000000000, 1.00000000000000, 2.00000000000000, 3.00000000000000, 4.00000000000000, 5.00000000000000)
