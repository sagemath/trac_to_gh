<a id='comment:4'></a>Here's a better fix which standardizes the category and it also handles this:

```
sage: P = Poset()
sage: Poset(P, category=P.category(), facade=False).category()
Join of Category of finite posets and Category of finite enumerated sets and Category of facade sets
```
and now returns:

```
Join of Category of finite posets and Category of finite enumerated sets
```
