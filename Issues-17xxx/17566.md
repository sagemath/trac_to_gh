The documentation of `sage.misc.set_verbose` states that verbosity levels should be
between 0 and 2, but this is apparently not enforced, and higher levels could be
useful.

Hello !

I modified the sentence a bit to mean that the lowest level of verbosity is 0, not 1. Is that okay for you ?

But at a quick glance the meaning of negative verbosity levels does not look very consistent. Sure, it would be nice to make it consistent and document it (and perhaps rewrite the whole verbosity system to make it more powerful), but that's more work than the minimal fix in this ticket and I don't have time for that right now.
