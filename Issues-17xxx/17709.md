My guess is that we now, as with integration, go through several "algorithms"/programs to get limits.

I guess technically this is still a Sage bug, then, if that is true and one then specifies the `algorithm`?  Otherwise I'd at the very least add a doctest.

Hmm, that is interesting.  Maxima returns a nounform `'limit((sqrt(n)+1)<sup>n*(sqrt(n+1)+1)</sup>((-n)-1),n,inf)` inside of Sage 9.2.beta1

```
Maxima 5.42.2 http://maxima.sourceforge.net
using Lisp ECL 16.1.2
```
But I don't have the most recent Maxima.  Can you test this?

```
sage -maxima
<messages about Maxima 5.44, hopefully>
(%i1) limit((1+sqrt(n+1))^(-n-1)/(1+sqrt(n))^(-n),n,inf);
```
If you get zero then they fixed it, and then a doctest suffices.  Otherwise we may have something really weird going on in our own processing, though I don't see what would have changed - Frédéric is right about that, as far as I can tell.
