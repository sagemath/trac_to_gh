Maxima 5.42.2 http://maxima.sourceforge.net

```
But I don't have the most recent Maxima.  Can you test this?

```
sage -maxima

```
If you get zero then they fixed it, and then a doctest suffices.  Otherwise we may have something really weird going on in our own processing, though I don't see what would have changed - Frédéric is right about that, as far as I can tell.
