ratsimp claims "canonical form", so that's definitely attractive. However, do we know if its rewrites always apply across the whole domain? We'd have to document if it deviates.

This can even lead to disaster, I think:

```
sage: F = (4*cos(9*pi/180)^2 - 3)*(4*cos(27*pi/180)^2 - 3)
sage: F.maxima_methods().trigrat()
sqrt(5) + 2*cos(7/10*pi) - 2*cos(1/10*pi) - 2*I*sin(3/5*pi) +
2*I*sin(2/5*pi) + 1
```
I really am not interested in seeing `I` turn up in such a simplification, regardless of the "correct" answer.

While this one could be resolved by adding a `trigreduce` to the queue:

```
sage: F = (4*cos(9*pi/180)^2 - 3)*(4*cos(27*pi/180)^2 - 3)
sage: F.maxima_methods().trigrat()
sqrt(5) + 2*cos(7/10*pi) - 2*cos(1/10*pi) - 2*I*sin(3/5*pi) +
2*I*sin(2/5*pi) + 1
sage: _.maxima_methods().trigreduce()
sqrt(5) - 2*cos(3/10*pi) - 2*cos(1/10*pi) + 1
```
I cannot see how to fix the doctest failure:

```
File "src/doc/de/thematische_anleitungen/sage_gymnasium.rst", line 394, in doc.de.thematische_anleitungen.sage_gymnasium
Failed example:
    (sin(x + y)/(log(x) + log(y))).simplify_full()
Expected:
    (cos(y)*sin(x) + cos(x)*sin(y))/log(x*y)
Got:
    ((-I*arctan2(0, x) - I*arctan2(0, y))*sin(x + y) + log(abs(x)*abs(y))*sin(x + y))/(arctan2(0, x)^2 + 2*arctan2(0, x)*arctan2(0, y) + arctan2(0, y)^2 + log(abs(x))^2 + 2*log(abs(x))*log(abs(y)) + log(abs(y))^2)
```
the minimal case being

```
sage: log(x).maxima_methods().trigrat()
I*arctan2(0, x) + log(abs(x))
```

On the other hand, replacing `trigrat` with `trigsimp/trigexpand/trigreduce` will fail in this case:

```
sage: sin(1/8*pi)*sin(3/8*pi)*sin(5/8*pi)*sin(7/8*pi)
sin(7/8*pi)*sin(5/8*pi)*sin(3/8*pi)*sin(1/8*pi)
sage: _.maxima_methods().trigreduce()

Yes, I noticed that one too. I have confirmed that the same problem arises in Maxima 5.34.1 on SBCL, so it's probably a maxima problem. This is now:
