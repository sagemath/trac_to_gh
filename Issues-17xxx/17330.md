OEIS functions should simply ignore sequences with the 
keyword 'dead'. At least they should not attempt to return
terms of these sequences.

For example the sequence A000017 https://oeis.org/A000017 
is 'dead', what means it has errors in the data and was 
replaced by another version. It is policy of the OEIS to 
keep such sequences so they can be found in the case they
are referenced in the literature. 

As it is now oeis(17).first_terms(12) throws the TypeError: 
You found a sign inconsistency, please contact OEIS

Here is how this could be fixed (see git branch).

When doctesting this, I noticed the another bug:

```
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/databases/oeis.py", line 845, in sage.databases.oeis.OEISSequence.keywords
Failed example:
    f.keywords()                          # optional -- internet
Expected:
    ('core', 'nonn', 'nice', 'easy', 'hear')
Got:
    ('core', 'nonn', 'nice', 'easy', 'hear', 'changed')
**********************************************************************
```
This is due to the fact that the keyword 'changed' is temporarily added, so this would go away after a while. I propose to change that example to a sequence that is not altered as often as the Fibonacci numbers (see commit)

The patch provided does not do what is in the description. Namely the dead sequences are not ignored!

I would add an explicit error message like

```
sage: oeis(17)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: this sequence is dead "A000017: Erroneous version of A032522."
```
Possibly, you could add an option to get it even if it is dead

```
sage: oeis(17, force=True)
A000017: Erroneous version of A032522.
```
