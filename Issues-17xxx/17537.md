Hello!

The plan is to ship the algorithm for the minimal geodetic set of a graph but first let me try to sell this simple method for computing the geodetic closure of a (di) graph.

Let me know if there are any bugs/suggestions for this contribution.

Hmmm... Calling "distances_all_pairs" in a function like that is a suicide. You cannot re-compute all distances every time you want to compute a closure. Actually, the information that you need is precisely the one that is stored in `convexity_properties`.

The "convexity properties" object associates to every pair of vertices `u,v` the bitset of all z such that z is on a shortest uv path. Thus if you need to find the closure of a set of points, all you have to do is compute the union (with 'or' processor operations) of the bitsets associated to all pairs of vertices.

My point is that the code is already there, but of course the name 'convexity properties' is very ill-chosen in this case. We will probably have to change the terminology... What do you think about all this ?

By the way, is the terminology 'closure' used anywhere ? Because formally it is not a closure function. One of the property of closure functions is that `f(f(X))` should be equal to `f(x)`.

That's true, though we can make for an optional argument DP that lets you pass the distance dictionary in case *anyone* really needs to compute this often.

I see.

Fine to me. As far as my preferences go I'd like convexity properties to be part of the graph/generic graph family and cache this stuff in some other way. Having a module like that for just a few functions seems a bit unnatural to me?

Yes it appears that this is the standard way to call it. See for example the paper "On pitfalls in computing the geodetic number of a graph" by Hansen and van Omme.

Yes, it is a bad implementation. I can say it, it's mine. It is ugly. I needed someplace to store this bitset, and I did not know where.
