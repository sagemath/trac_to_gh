Comparison operators between real interval field members and numpy float numbers always return false:

```
sage: import numpy as np
sage: RIF(1) <= 2.0
True
sage: RIF(1) <= RealNumber(2.0)
True
sage: RIF(1) <= np.float64(2.0)
False
```

Hello,

See also #13386. The problem is that Sage needs to avoid loading numpy at startup. This is still doable but require a bit of work (see in #13386).

I agree, it looks like a duplicate. Sorry for not finding #13386 myself, I was searching only for "interval".

I understand that loading numpy slows down the startup time, but on the other hand this quirky behavior can cause nasty bugs in user code.

Hello,

I propose to close this as duplicate because of #18076. With the branch applied

```
sage: import numpy as np
sage: RIF(1) <= np.float64(2.0)
True
```
Though, if the numpy element is on the left this is still an issue (see #8824).
