1. Keep only `inplace_threshold` in `coerce.pxi` (that can be dealt with in another ticket) and move everything else to more appropriate places.
2. Define the global `parent()` function in `structure/element.pyx` and document it.
3. Move `have_same_parent()` to `structure/element.pyx`.
4. Remove superfluous `parent()` methods (where `parent()` is defined exactly as in the base `Element` class, so by inheritance it's not needed).

<a id='comment:9'></a>Hello Jeroen,

1) Why moving "parent_c" and "have_same_parent_c"?

2) Instead of

```
cdef inline parent_c(x):
    if isinstance(x, Element):
        return (<Element>x)._parent
    elif hasattr(x, 'parent'):
        return x.parent()
    else:
        return type(x)
```
wouldn't it be faster to do

```
cdef inline parent_c(x):
    if isinstance(x, Element):
        return (<Element>x)._parent
    else:
        try:
            return x.parent()
        except AttributeError:
            return type(x)
```

3) In `element.pyx`, the "seealso" should be a "SEEALSO".

Vincent
