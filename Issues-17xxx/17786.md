<a id='comment:1'></a>Regarding the "What is going on?!" comment: transcendental functions are not quite deterministic due to internal caches. In this case, doing something that results in an internal recomputation of log(2) to higher precision leads to a slightly more accurate value later on.

This is something that I could fix with a bit of effort.

In any case, output could also change slightly between versions due to changes in algorithms. That's an inherent drawback of doing doctests this way...

Good to know, I wasn't aware of that.

Unless you have other users that need it, I don't think it is worth the effort.

Yes. But I thought I'd first go with a version that tested the exact output, and we could always make something more sophisticated later on if some of the outputs really changed.

Thanks for your comments!

`RIF` intervals implement `__nonzero__` with the meaning of "not exactly zero". So I think we need both if we want to stay compatible with them. But then I'm not sure doing things that way in `RIF` was the wisest choice in the first place...

I think we should not have methods `__nonzero__` and `is_nonzero` with different behaviour.
