<a id='comment:5'></a>`@`Jeroen, what reason is there in the respective snippet of `Function::__call__` l.478-491 not to do the following:

```
                nargs = [None]*len(args)
                for i in range(len(args)):
                    carg = args[i]
                    try:
                        nargs[i] = SR.coerce(carg)
                    except Exception:
                        nargs[i] = SR(carg)
```
i.e. not throwing at all. I keep needing exceptions like the `Qp` of this ticket.

Do we have a fundamental problem here? Why can `rings.arith...` handle this differently?

<a id='comment:12'></a>I think this ticket is wontfix because a better solution would be to write a global Python function accepting everything (as in rings.arith...) and dispatch to the symbolic function for symbolic arguments.

In the ticket case just do

```
sage: from sage.arith.misc import binomial
sage: binomial(Qp(5)(8),3)
1 + 5 + 2*5^2 + O(5^20)
```
