This patch changes the data structure `binary_matrix_t` to use one bitset per row. This enables us to use directly operations on bitsets without casts. It also moves the files to `data_structures`.
Currently, this data structure is only used for operations on graphs.

Hello !

I added a small commit at `public/17665` that only fixes some doc and a function call. It is not equivalent to do the following change:

```diff
-    binary_matrix_set0(m,row,col)
-    m.rows[row][col >> index_shift] |= (<unsigned long>1) << (value & offset_mask)
+    if value:
+        binary_matrix_set1(m,row,col)
+    else:
+        binary_matrix_set0(m,row,col)
```

The purpose of the first code (and of `bitset_set_to` is specifically to avoid that 'if').

Nothing else to mention, and only my commit now needs a review!

Nathann

```

Also: make sure your types match. `n_rows` and `n_cols` are declared as `long`, then loop indices should also be `long` (you use `int` in many places).

I thought it was better this way, but if it's not the correct cython syntax, we can go back to `range(n)`.


> Also: make sure your types match. `n_rows` and `n_cols` are declared as `long`, then loop indices should also be `long` (you use `int` in many places).

It was already `int`in many places. So we can try to unify the stuff.
Honestly I doubt that we really need `long` for `n_rows` and `n_cols`. `int` should be large enough, no?


Why have you changed the path to the branch? I cannot write to u/jdemeyer/ticket/17665  and I'm unable to see what Nathann's pushed.

It's technically correct but not recommended.

I would personally use `long` (or even better: `Py_ssize_t`). There is no reason to artificially restrict to 2^32 rows and columns. Even if you don't see an obvious use-case for this, perhaps other people do.

Given that

```
sage: Matrix(GF(2), 2^32, 1)
4294967296 x 1 dense matrix over Finite Field of size 2 (use the '.str()' method to see the entries)
```
works fine, the same would work for this `binary_matrix` class.

I have implemented requested changes:
- use `range(n)` instead of `for i from 0 <= i < n`
- use type `Py_ssize_t` instead of `int` or `long` in `binary_matrix`

Let me know if further changes are needed.
