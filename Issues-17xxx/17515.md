Using the email command is nice.

```
sage: email('root@localhost', 'hi', 'test')
Child process 9360 is sending email to root@localhost...
sage: Successfully sent an email to root@localhost.
```
Except that it isn't clear that the `sage:` prompt is actually usable.  Is there any way to make the prompt print after the message, or this is essentially some kind of race condition?

> Is there any way to make the prompt print after the message

Use the `block=True` argument :-)

This behaviour in intentional. From the source code:

```
    if not block:
        # Do a non-block sendmail, which is typically what a user wants, since it can take
        # a while to send an email.
```

Like I said, the easiest solution there would be to use `block=True` by default.
