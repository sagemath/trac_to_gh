Right now, checking for k-closed is slow because it uses Sage sets whereas we only need python sets.

<a id='comment:1'>**Comment 1:**</a>
With patch:

```
sage: PR4 = RootSystem(['D',4]).root_lattice().positive_roots()
sage: m4 = matrix(map(lambda x: x.to_vector(), PR4)).transpose()
sage: M4 = Matroid(m4)
sage: %timeit M4.is_k_closed(3)
10 loops, best of 3: 147 ms per loop
sage: %timeit M4.is_k_closed(4)
1 loops, best of 3: 413 ms per loop
sage: PR5 = RootSystem(['D',5]).root_lattice().positive_roots()
sage: m5 = matrix(map(lambda x: x.to_vector(), PR5)).transpose()
sage: M5 = Matroid(m5)
sage: %timeit M5.is_k_closed(3)
1 loops, best of 3: 1.45 s per loop
```
Before:

```
sage: %timeit M4.is_k_closed(3)
1 loops, best of 3: 776 ms per loop
sage: %timeit M4.is_k_closed(4)
1 loops, best of 3: 3.09 s per loop
sage: %timeit M5.is_k_closed(3)
1 loops, best of 3: 4.16 s per loop
```
So we are getting a 3x~4x speedup.

Hi Travis,

I checked out this patch and it all works as advertised. Positive review, except for one thing:

A merge with 'master' was necessary before sage -b would successfully build this on my sage 6.7.  The logical thing would perhaps be to push the merged branch I created, but I hesitate to do this since my recent experience with git tell me that I might not fully understand how things work when it comes to this. Perhaps there is another, better way, and also I do not want to risk messing up your work.

So please update the branch to something that compiles out of the box, or argue that this is unnecessary. Then feel free to set this to 'positive review'.

The branch is merged with the latest `develop` at merge time, so if this works after merging (cleanly, i.e., without having to handle any merge conflicts) with `master` (or now `develop` at 6.8.beta0), there should be no problems.

For the record, my usual workflow is to always merge the branch into my current `develop` branch as my current spkgs might be incompatible with older versions of Sage. Plus it saves on compilation time. Also if you push it to a different branch and set that, there is no way to corrupt my work on my branch.

Thank you again.
