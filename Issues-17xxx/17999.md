I have tried to implement two more games namely fair cake cutting game and kuhn poker game.. These are very basic implementation and needs a lot of modification to include more number of players. With the time given, more functionalities can be added to the module.

You've currently only included what looks like a diff file, reading through code that's already been included in Game Theory for Sage should help with structure.

It would be really good to get these included, looking forward to seeing how things progress!!
