Thanks for noticing, it worked for me and `setuptools` was not indicated as a dependency in `SPKG.txt`. I will fix this soon (but i am working on another branch from another version right now).

This is a more serious issue, since IIRC, `openssl` can not be a standard package because of licensing stuff (which i do not understand well). Do you know if `HTTPSHandler` works with other SSL implementations (e.g. gnuTLS) ?

It depends on whether python's standard "Lib/ssl.py" module can be made to work with another implementation. As far as I can tell, `Modules/_ssl.c` is the real implementation underneath and that file looks like it's wired into `openssl` (it imports its headers unconditionally without alternatives listed). There may exist drop-in replacements? It's the kind of module you do not want to take any chances with because of security.

Solution I see:
- pip is not *essential* for basic sage functionality, so while it's standard, its functioning can be conditional on recommended dependencies (rather than making them hard dependencies).
- these dependencies can be met by a system-wide openssl install or by `sage -i openssl; make`

The big problem would probably be how we ship binaries, where "remaking" isn't an option. Can we just build WITH system openssl support and not include the shared library? Hopefully that would only lead to a fail at `import ssl`.

If i understand correctly, official Sage binaries are built with the system's libssl-dev, so there should not be a problem for those (the user only have to install the libssl package from her distro to have it working).

It seems also that a similar dependency problem happens for ipython notebook:

This is true for the moment, but we have to ensure that this remains true, that we never use `pip` to install a standard package.

On the other hand, for pre-downloaded Python packages, usually a simple `python setup.py install` works, so there is no real gain from using `pip`. For standard packages, we already have a build system which works.

I thought the main motivation for `pip` was to be able to easily install *optional* packages.

I would mind since I don't care about OpenSSL.
