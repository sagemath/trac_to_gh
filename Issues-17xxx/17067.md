ok. I've now taken the original code from Adam Towsley and Paul Fili from sage-days 55 and made it mesh with the current functionality in Sage.

Please take a look and see what you think. I've run many more examples there are in the docs where I pullback rational points to a number field and haven't run into any issues there. Another way to get valid tests would be nice.

I'm also considering adding the error bound computation for dimension >1 to this ticket as well, but I've haven't yet looked into how complicated that will be.

Here is a first attempt at the generalized error bounds. It needed the implementation of local heights for morphisms, so I did that and for points as well.

I need to do some serious testing still, but the original set of doc tests were still basically correct. With the new error bound computation the values were slightly different, but within the specified tolerance.
