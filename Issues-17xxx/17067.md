Please take a look and see what you think. I've run many more examples there are in the docs where I pullback rational points to a number field and haven't run into any issues there. Another way to get valid tests would be nice.

I'm also considering adding the error bound computation for dimension >1 to this ticket as well, but I've haven't yet looked into how complicated that will be.
