In Sage 6.6.beta5:

```
sage: K.<a> = QuadraticField(17)
sage: Q.<x,y> = K[]
sage: f = (-3*a)*y + (5*a)
sage: p = K.primes_above(5)[0]
sage: R = K.residue_field(p)
sage: F = R['x','y']
sage: g = F(f)
...
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occurred in Sage.
```
This is caused by (unnecessarily) changing `currRing` to *Q* and not setting it back to *F*.
