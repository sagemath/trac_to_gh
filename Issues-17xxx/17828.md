`SAGE_TMP` is currently located in `DOT_SAGE`. This patch moves it to [tempfile.tempdir](https://docs.python.org/2/library/tempfile.html#tempfile.tempdir).

This is part of #17185.

Files in `/var/tmp` are supposed to survive a reboot, so I conclude from this that they would be kept alive during a running Sage session too. It is not a problem if `/tmp` and `/var/tmp` point to the same directory, as long as it's not cleaned too often.
