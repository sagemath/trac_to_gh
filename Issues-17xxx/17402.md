```
sage: x=var('x')
sage: s=(1/(1-x)).series(x,6)
sage: ps=s.power_series(SR)
sage: ps
x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + Order(x^6) + 1 + O(x)
sage: ps=s.power_series(QQ)
...
TypeError: unable to convert 1 + 1*x + 1*x^2 + 1*x^3 + 1*x^4 + 1*x^5 + Order(x^6) to a rational
```
This is analogous to #16203 and can be worked around using `truncate()` but really should work out of the box.

Keywords: conversion, ring
