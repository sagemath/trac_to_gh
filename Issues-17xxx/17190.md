<a id='comment:4'></a>~~**[EDIT]** As one can notice, I messed up the history with some completely unrelated commits. I am trying to undo this... The relevant code is the latest commit only! **![/EDIT]**~~ Should be OK now!

The problem was not in conversion, but rather in initialization of univariate polynomials over `RR`, with an empty dictionary.  
Before:

```python
sage: RR['x']({})
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: max() arg is an empty sequence
```
After:

```python
sage: RR['x']({})
0
```

As a result, we also have:

```python
sage: RR['x'](RR['x,y'].0)
x
```

## Details

In the initialization of a polynomial over `RR`, if the "data" is given as a dictionary, this dictionary is converted to a list. Before the patch, there was an attempt to compute `max(x.keys())` where `x` is the dictionary. If `x` is empty, this yields an error. To correct the error, I could have add a test. Yet, a function is already specifically defined in the class `Polynomial` to perform this conversion `dict -> list`. The new code just uses this function. 

Note that I corrected some slight formatting issues in the docstring in other (unrelated) parts of the same file `src/sage/rings/polynomials/polynomial_real_mpfr_dense.pyx`.
