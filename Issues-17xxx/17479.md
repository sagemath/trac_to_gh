A warning was added about running a read-only copy of Sage because sage-location needs to be able to update a file.  However, this back fires in cases when Sage.app was installed (and run) by an administrator.  In this case the check fails, but sage can actually be run safely since sage-location doesn't need to update anything. 

I plan to warn once in this case since the administrator may have set things up incorrectly, but then not continue to warn every time since that's just annoying.

Sounds like just if one runs as administrator, and only a warning ... ?  I don't know, though.  The reason the warning was added is because people sometimes would try to run from the disk image, instead of first moving it to their usual `/Volume`, I think.

Once sage-location has been run (say if the administrator ran it once after installing, Sage should work fine.  The problem was mostly due to people trying to run it from the disk image (as kcrisman said).  This is fine for most applications, but not for Sage.

I believe things have changed with sage-location, to the point that this warning many not even be needed anymore.  Unfortunately, I haven't kept up with Sage development recently too well, so I can't say for sure, but I'm pretty sure it will work if installed by an administrator if the administrator runs the application at least once (to ensure that any path translations can occur).

The purpose of this ticket was actually to only warn once so the user might have some clue what was going on if the administrator hadn't run it (and hence sage-location), but then stop warning.  At the moment, the warning occurs every time which is probably excessive.  

So, unless we have a reason to believe that installing Sage as an admin doesn't work I don't think this needs to be a high priority issue.
