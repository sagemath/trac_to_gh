I had a student today that had a bit of difficulty finding the documentation explaining how to create a permutation group element.

This is actualy well documented, but in the `__init__` method of `PermutationGroupElement`. Because of this, when typing `PermutationGroupElement?` the user first gets the documentation of the class itself (which is currently not particularly useful), and only after the useful documentation of the `__init__` method.
In the notebook, the documentation of `__init__` does not even show up. This also means that the useful doc does not appear at all in the html documentation.

What about moving the documentation on how to create permutation group elements to the class docstring?

Thanks!
