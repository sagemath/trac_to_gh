The classes `ManinSymbolList` and `ManinSymbol` (in `sage.modular.modsym.manin_symbols`) do not inherit from `Parent` and `Element`.  We fix this and make `ManinSymbolList` a parent in the category `FiniteEnumeratedSets`.

To prevent a measurable slowdown, the class `ManinSymbol` is converted to Cython.

This is a dependency of #10513.

I don't mind too much, but given that this ticket is a dependency of #10513, which already has positive review, wouldn't it make sense to do this on a different ticket?  (I currently don't have enough time to review your changes.)

<a id='comment:12'></a>I'm creating the following for the test:

```
sage: from sage.modular.modsym.manin_symbols import ManinSymbolList_gamma0
sage: m = ManinSymbolList_gamma0(5,8)
```
Previously we have:

```
sage: %time L = m.manin_symbol_list()
CPU times: user 560 µs, sys: 84 µs, total: 644 µs
Wall time: 494 µs
sage: %time L = m.manin_symbol_list()
CPU times: user 48 µs, sys: 4 µs, total: 52 µs
Wall time: 68.9 µs
```
With my branch:

```
sage: %time L = m.manin_symbol_list()
CPU times: user 644 µs, sys: 90 µs, total: 734 µs
Wall time: 747 µs
sage: %time L = m.manin_symbol_list()
CPU times: user 56 µs, sys: 7 µs, total: 63 µs
Wall time: 64.8 µs
```
With Peter's branch:

```
sage: %time L = m.manin_symbol_list()
CPU times: user 792 µs, sys: 99 µs, total: 891 µs
Wall time: 828 µs
sage: %time L = m.manin_symbol_list()
CPU times: user 49 µs, sys: 6 µs, total: 55 µs
Wall time: 66 µs
```
So there is a slowdown with creating the instances of `ManinSymbol` that comes from the new branch and Peters by creating instances of `Element`. Hence this is a slowdown we might just have to deal with (assuming one is actually wanting the `ManinSymbol`, not the indexing tuple which can be grabbed by `symbol_list`).

The creation of the list in Travis's example goes down from 191 µs to 150 µs on the system on which I tested this.
