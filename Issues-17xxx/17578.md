```
The classes `ManinSymbolList` and `ManinSymbol` (in `sage.modular.modsym.manin_symbols`) do not inherit from `Parent` and `Element`.  We fix this and make `ManinSymbolList` a parent in the category `FiniteEnumeratedSets`.

To prevent a measurable slowdown, the class `ManinSymbol` is converted to Cython.

This is a dependency of #10513.

I've made some more substantial changes making `ManinSymbolList` a proper parent in `FiniteEnumeratedSets`. In particular, there is a backwards incompatible change in that `m[i]` returns a `ManinSymbol` instance (of `m`) rather than a tuple. Also I changed the `_list` attribute to `_symbol_list` since `FiniteEnumeratedSets` uses `_list` internally. Lastly I've added a method `symbol_list` to get the explicit list of symbols (the indexing tuples).

I'm thinking we should post something to sage-devel stating this (proposed) change. Sound good?

I don't mind too much, but given that this ticket is a dependency of #10513, which already has positive review, wouldn't it make sense to do this on a different ticket?  (I currently don't have enough time to review your changes.)

I strongly disagree with doing this (IMO) dirty hack of parents just to merge it quickly. It creates parents without a category and elements not created from the parent, both of which are abuses of `Parent`.

Also from my understanding, since this branch was published and I based my branch on it, it was not good to rebase the branch. Merge commits don't hurt anyone.

<div id="comment:12" align="right">Comment 12</div>

I'm creating the following for the test:

```
sage: from sage.modular.modsym.manin_symbols import ManinSymbolList_gamma0
sage: m = ManinSymbolList_gamma0(5,8)
```
Previously we have:

```
sage: %time L = m.manin_symbol_list()
CPU times: user 560 µs, sys: 84 µs, total: 644 µs
Wall time: 494 µs
sage: %time L = m.manin_symbol_list()
CPU times: user 48 µs, sys: 4 µs, total: 52 µs
Wall time: 68.9 µs
```
With my branch:

```
sage: %time L = m.manin_symbol_list()
CPU times: user 644 µs, sys: 90 µs, total: 734 µs
Wall time: 747 µs
sage: %time L = m.manin_symbol_list()
CPU times: user 56 µs, sys: 7 µs, total: 63 µs
Wall time: 64.8 µs
```
With Peter's branch:

```
sage: %time L = m.manin_symbol_list()
CPU times: user 792 µs, sys: 99 µs, total: 891 µs
Wall time: 828 µs
sage: %time L = m.manin_symbol_list()
CPU times: user 49 µs, sys: 6 µs, total: 55 µs
Wall time: 66 µs
```
So there is a slowdown with creating the instances of `ManinSymbol` that comes from the new branch and Peters by creating instances of `Element`. Hence this is a slowdown we might just have to deal with (assuming one is actually wanting the `ManinSymbol`, not the indexing tuple which can be grabbed by `symbol_list`).

-The classes `ManinSymbolList` and `ManinSymbol` (in `sage.modular.modsym.manin_symbols`) do not inherit from `Parent` and `Element`.  This causes trouble when applying both #10513 and #10962.
+The classes `ManinSymbolList` and `ManinSymbol` (in `sage.modular.modsym.manin_symbols`) do not inherit from `Parent` and `Element`.  We fix this and make `ManinSymbolList` a parent in the category `FiniteEnumeratedSets`.

Here is a new branch incorporating my original fix, Travis's improvements, and a restructuring of the module `sage.modular.modsym.manin_symbols` into two new modules `sage.modular.modsym.manin_symbol` (Cython) and `sage.modular.modsym.manin_symbol` (Python).

The creation of the list in Travis's example goes down from 191 µs to 150 µs on the system on which I tested this.

(I have decided to rebase my branch; it has been inactive for months and I wanted to start with a clean slate.  In particular, I found the duplicate commits in the Git history extremely annoying.)
