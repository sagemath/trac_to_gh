> An actual memory leak leaks memory every time...

Depending on the implementation, that doesn't need to be the case. `malloc` usually pre-allocates more memory than strictly needed. Your test would pass even if there was an actual memory leak.

I think a better test would be that the amount of memory needed to execute `leak(10000)` n times is bounded by a constant which does not depend on n.
Something like (pseudocode):

```
L = []
for i in range(10):
    leak(10000)
    L.append(memory_usage())
m = max(L)  # taking the max because the memory usage might increase and decrease
for i in range(10):
    leak(10000)
    assert memory_usage() <= m
```

I'm travelling right now so I can't test it on OSX, but it should fail as it ought to at least once print "Leaked N bytes" with N>0.

Also, the first couple of iterations will always succeed (even if there is a leak) as singular has pre-allocated buckets, and as long as you don't exhaust these no new memory will be allocated. At least in the original leak I did need the `leak(50000)` to fill these up.
