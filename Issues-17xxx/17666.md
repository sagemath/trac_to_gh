> An actual memory leak leaks memory every time...

Depending on the implementation, that doesn't need to be the case. `malloc` usually pre-allocates more memory than strictly needed. Your test would pass even if there was an actual memory leak.

I think a better test would be that the amount of memory needed to execute `leak(10000)` n times is bounded by a constant which does not depend on n.
Something like (pseudocode):

```
L = []
for i in range(10):
    leak(10000)
    L.append(memory_usage())
m = max(L)  # taking the max because the memory usage might increase and decrease
for i in range(10):
    leak(10000)
    assert memory_usage() <= m
```

The result is that it takes way longer than what a long doctest ought to use:

```
sage: %time [leak(10000) for i in range(100)]
CPU times: user 1min 16s, sys: 327 ms, total: 1min 17s
Wall time: 1min 15s
```
Output on OSX is:

```

Doing 10 tests (your commit) is fine, but doing *14 tests* (5 consequtive zeros in your example `[155189248, 0, 0, 0, 83886080, 0, 0, 0, 79691776, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` is an order of magnitude slower?
