As reported in this google group (https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-support/ew0bnGzjm98), it was not possible to create Polyhedron defined over number fields. Now that #17830 is merged it does work and it should be documented and even advertised in the documentation!

from the previous report:

To create polyhedra quickly, the final suggestion in the Polyhedron documentation (http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/geometry/sage/geometry/polyhedron/constructor.html#base-rings) is to work in a set number field. Although this appears to work for setting vertices, it does not appear to work for lines (or rays).

For example:

```
sage: var('x')
x
sage: K.<sqrt3> = NumberField(x^2-3, embedding=1.732)
sage: P = Polyhedron(lines=[(1,sqrt3)])
sage: P
A 1-dimensional polyhedron in (Number Field in sqrt3 with defining polynomial x^10 + x^2 - 3)^2 defined as the convex hull of 1 vertex and 2 rays
sage: P.rays()
(A ray in the direction (0, -sqrt3), A ray in the direction (1, sqrt3))
```

This should be compared with:

```
sage: P = Polyhedron(lines=[(1, sqrt(3))])
sage: P
A 1-dimensional polyhedron in (Symbolic Ring)^2 defined as the convex hull of 1 vertex and 1 line
```
and

```
sage: P = Polyhedron(lines=[(1, sqrt(3))], base_ring=AA)
sage: P
A 1-dimensional polyhedron in AA^2 defined as the convex hull of 1 vertex and 1 line
```


Additionally, how can a "1-dimensional polyhedron" be "defined as the convex hull of 1 vertex and 2 rays"?

As pointed out below this is an issue with Polyhedron using a number fields < comparison

```
sage: K.<x> = NumberField(x^3 - 1001, embedding=10)
sage: x > x + 1
True
```

Though the original example fails:

```
sage: K.<L> = NumberField(x^3 + 3*x^2 - 83*x - 1022, embedding=11.6515)
sage: Polyhedron(eqns=[[0, -L - 2, -8, 2], [0, -2, -L + 6, 9], [0, -9, 5, -L - 7]])

Slightly simpler failure:

```
sage: Polyhedron(eqns=[[0, -L - 2, -8], [0, -2, -L + 6], [0, -9, 5]])
A 2-dimensional polyhedron in (Number Field in L with defining polynomial x^3 + 3*x^2 - 83*x - 1022)^2 defined as the convex hull of 1 vertex and 2 rays

Since the Polyhedron evolved quite a bit in the last year, here is an update on Sage8.2.rc1:

```
sage: var('x')
x
sage: K.<sqrt3> = NumberField(x^2-3, embedding=1.732)
sage: P = Polyhedron(lines=[(1,sqrt3)])
sage: P.rays()
()
sage: P.lines()
(A line in the direction (1, sqrt3),)

sage: P = Polyhedron(lines=[(1, sqrt(3))])
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: for polyhedra with floating point numbers, the only allowed ring is RDF with backend 'cdd'

sage: P = Polyhedron(lines=[(1, sqrt(3))], base_ring=AA)
sage: P
A 1-dimensional polyhedron in AA^2 defined as the convex hull of 1 vertex and 1 line
```

The value error above will be changed in #24835 to a more appropriate error message, for which:

```
sage: P = Polyhedron(lines=[(1, sqrt(3))],backend='cdd',base_ring=RDF)
sage: P
A 1-dimensional polyhedron in RDF^2 defined as the convex hull of 1 vertex and 1 line
```

is the only way to get a symbolic expression to pass on to the constructor of Polyhedron.

Concerning documenting the Polyhedron class usage through NumberFields, I believe that #22572 does the job.

Hence, once #22572 is merged, I would set this ticket to won't fix: the bug is fixed.

An improvement of the doc is posted on #26077, where I also point out that
it is not sufficient to have a tutorial doc: the docstring of Polyhedron should have a real example with NF entries.

Just an update of the current situation in `8.9beta3`:

```
sage: var('x')
x
sage: K.<sqrt3> = NumberField(x^2-3, embedding=1.732)
sage: P = Polyhedron(lines=[(1,sqrt3)])
sage: P.rays()
()
sage: P.lines()
(A line in the direction (1, sqrt3),)
sage: P = Polyhedron(lines=[(1, sqrt(3))])
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: no default backend for computations with Symbolic Ring
sage: P = Polyhedron(lines=[(1, sqrt(3))], base_ring=AA); P
A 1-dimensional polyhedron in AA^2 defined as the convex hull of 1 vertex and 1 line
sage: Q = Polyhedron(lines=[(1, sqrt(3))], backend='normaliz'); Q
A 1-dimensional polyhedron in (Symbolic Ring)^2 defined as the convex hull of 1 vertex and 1 line
```

and it is still possible to do:

```
sage: R = Polyhedron(lines=[(1, sqrt(3))],backend='cdd',base_ring=RDF);R
A 1-dimensional polyhedron in RDF^2 defined as the convex hull of 1 vertex and 1 line
```

Similar examples should now complete the docstring, now that #25097 is merged.
