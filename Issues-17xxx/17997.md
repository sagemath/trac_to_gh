In the process of making `Tableau` immutable (#15862), we found this mutates the supposedly immutable `Tableau` possibly making the result non-straight-shape. Once `CompositionTableau` is implemented, this output should be updated.

Depends on #15862

`CompositionTableau` in fact does exist, though it's inappropriate for the return value here since entries weakly decrease from left to right along rows in that class whereas entries weakly increase here. Perhaps a list of lists is the best solution after all?

In general, I think there should be an ABC (abstract base class) `Tableau` which should allow any entry. Then it's subclasses, such as `SemistandardTableau`, should be more restrictive on its shapes/entries. Either that, or we should separate out a way to use the tableaux latex/ascii-art code to print tableau-like arrays.
