The following should work:

```
sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
sage: (x^2 + 2).roots(SR)
[-sqrt(-2), sqrt(-2)]
```

This could easily be done by first finding the roots in `QQbar` and then converting to `SR`.

I decided to implement this without waiting on #17516. We can always add an extra code path for that later on. I consider this method the canonical place to compute radical expressions for polynomials, so I've adapted the approach via `Expression.solve` I've been using in other places as well. If this gets accepted quickly, I might even change #14239 to make use of this.

There is one situation I just thought of: if the coefficients are from `AA` or `QQbar`, then my current implementation will fail. In that situation your original suggestion, of computing roots in `QQbar` and then turning them into symbolic expressions, starts to make a lot of sense. But I'd rather handle that in a separate ticket, since such polynomials are much rarer and that code really would depend on #14239 which, as I just suggested, could benefit from depending on this implementation here.
