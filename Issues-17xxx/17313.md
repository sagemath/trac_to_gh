Isn't there any chance we manage to install this one (and maybe others?) using pypi (that we now ship)?

We only have one trivial patch, which we may submit upstream, or try to get upstream to integrate a way to tweak pygments behavior to suit our needs...

But it's true that for such packages we'll then be dependent on upstream to integrate our patches and won't be able to fix issues ourselves asap.
