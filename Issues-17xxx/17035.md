In order to do have the generators print like other variables in Sage. So we'd have the following:

```
sage: C = CombinatorialFreeModule(QQ, ['x','y','z'], prefix='', bracket=False, string_quotes=False)
sage: C.an_element()
2*x + 2*y + 3*z
```
Thus it matches polynomial rings and other variables in Sage and gives a cleaner output.
