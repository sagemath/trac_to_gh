Is this a Cygwin issue or is it because Cygwin is just more picky about these things (i.e., should this be submitted upstream)?

It's in an `else` clause picked up on Cygwin, but potentially on other systems.
The definitions in the `if` clause which is usually picked are in the right order.

This was introduced in `3.1.1`, the code in `3.1.0` is different.

And the problem here is really trivial, nothing to do with Cygwin but with the C language:
you don't know anything about a function until it is defined, and defining it later on in the same file is not enough, you would need a forward declaration.

And yes, it should be reported upstream, and I think it would be better not to mention Cygwin after the response I got for #15768.
