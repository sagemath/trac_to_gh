I fixed a couple of things and added links toward the methods/clases you cite (branch at public/17477)

Also, I am not sure that the `Poset` contain as you claim the position of the vertices. I believe that it is computed on-the-fly when `FinitePoset.plot` is called.

I set this ticket back to `needs_info` because of this last comment.

Looks better.

True. Actually docs of Hasse diagram says that `plot()` takes argument `label_font_size`. It does, but do not do anything with it -- i.e. `P._hasse_diagram.plot(label_font_size='cat-says-meow').show()` equals to `P._hasse_diagram.plot(label_font_size=100).show()`.

Is this easier if you just remove paragraph "The Internal DiGraph of the poset also contains - -" from public/17477 and make it to branch for this repo? Maybe also we can add to last paragraph something like "Hence for example `P.gt(x, y)` if faster after `P.lequal_matrix()`."

Ahahaha. No, I swear that in our current implementation it is *always* the right thing to do. The term 'dense matrix' may be scary, but a matrix of bits is infinitely more compact than a list of adjacences stored with pointers and stuff. Infinitely more compact that all Python objects we store for nothing.

Look: the `BooleanLattice` poset on 2^11 elements seems to take 320Mb in memory (no idea why it is so expensive):

```
sage: m1 = get_memory_usage()
sage: p = posets.BooleanLattice(11)
sage: round(get_memory_usage()-m1)
321.0
```

How much does it cost to store the dense binary matrix ? Simple, you need (2<sup>11)</sup>2 bits. That means ... 4 Mb = 500kB.

And we (still) live in a world where all posets you generate are stored forever uselessly, where you have 64-bits pointers everywhere and stuff. Really, those 4Mb are far from accounting for any of our memory problems `:-P`

Then I guess you should move what is useful in there to the documentation you added in the module, and delete what is left. Doc is no good if nobody knows it is there, and you cannot easily get the doc content of `__init__` in Sage. Plus it does not appear in the html.
