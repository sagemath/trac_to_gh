As there is no status "needs_comments" I put this to needs_review. Comments are welcome.

Hello !

I fixed a couple of things and added links toward the methods/clases you cite (branch at public/17477)

Also, I am not sure that the `Poset` contain as you claim the position of the vertices. I believe that it is computed on-the-fly when `FinitePoset.plot` is called.

I set this ticket back to `needs_info` because of this last comment.

Looks better.

True. Actually docs of Hasse diagram says that `plot()` takes argument `label_font_size`. It does, but do not do anything with it -- i.e. `P._hasse_diagram.plot(label_font_size='cat-says-meow').show()` equals to `P._hasse_diagram.plot(label_font_size=100).show()`.

Is this easier if you just remove paragraph "The Internal DiGraph of the poset also contains - -" from public/17477 and make it to branch for this repo? Maybe also we can add to last paragraph something like "Hence for example `P.gt(x, y)` if faster after `P.lequal_matrix()`."

The problem comes from `HasseDiagram.plot`. This argument, and two others, are totally ignored. Also, it seems that this `HasseDiagram.plot` function is never used: `Poset.plot` calls `GenericGraph.plot` directly.

Aha. I think that Sage could have some kind of system-level setting for memory-cpu -tradeoff. Sometimes saving, for example, le-matrix, may not be right thing to do.

> Anyway: it this ticket ready ? If you have nothing to add I guess it can go.


Yes, I think this is ready. Or at least better than no documentation at all.

Ahahaha. No, I swear that in our current implementation it is *always* the right thing to do. The term 'dense matrix' may be scary, but a matrix of bits is infinitely more compact than a list of adjacences stored with pointers and stuff. Infinitely more compact that all Python objects we store for nothing.

Look: the `BooleanLattice` poset on 2^11 elements seems to take 320Mb in memory (no idea why it is so expensive):

```
sage: m1 = get_memory_usage()
sage: p = posets.BooleanLattice(11)
sage: round(get_memory_usage()-m1)
321.0
```

How much does it cost to store the dense binary matrix ? Simple, you need (2<sup>11)</sup>2 bits. That means ... 4 Mb = 500kB.

And we (still) live in a world where all posets you generate are stored forever uselessly, where you have 64-bits pointers everywhere and stuff. Really, those 4Mb are far from accounting for any of our memory problems `:-P`
