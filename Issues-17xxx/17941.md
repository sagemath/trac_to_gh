This branch lets one define a GDD without specifying its groups. The automatic guess is performed in the `is_group_divisible_design` routine, as it also requires to list the pairs which appear in a block.

Both work. Consider the whole matrix: for the design to be a GDD, it must have two types of entries only: `0` or `l`.

1) If the matrix is a real GDD, you can see that the two are equivalent
2) If the matrix is not a GDD, the 'error' message will differ. (wrong size of groups, or a pair not present the right number of times, or two points of a group contained in the same set, ...)

> This suggest to add an example with `lambd > 1`.


Do you have an example in mind?

I added a dummy example.

I am done with the review. Tell me what you think of `​7336c5c`.
