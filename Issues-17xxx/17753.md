This metaticket tracks efforts to remove the usage of pexpect for calling maxima, either by using `maxima_lib` or replacing it altogether. Code that is dependent on the maxima expect interface is in:

* '' `doc/`  and other places using `maxima.eval()` (see #30071)
* *`calculus/desolvers.py`*: `desolve_*()`
* *`functions/piecewise.py`*: `piecewise.convolution()`
* *`matrix/matrix1.pyx`*: `Matrix._maxima_init_()`
* *`matrix/matrix_symbolic_dense.pyx`*: `Matrix_symbolic_dense.exp()` 
* *`structure/sage_object.pyx`*: `SageObject._maxima_()`, `_maxima_init_()`
* *`symbolic/assumptions.py`*: `GenericDeclaration.assume()`
* *`symbolic/expression.pyx`*: `Ex.assume()`, `forget()`, `assume_str()`, `assert()`, `expand_trig()`, `reduce_trig()`, `maxima_methods()`, `rectform()`, `simplify()`, `simplify_real()`, `simplify_rational()` (#21335), `simplify_log()`, `expand_log()`, `factor()` (#23835), `solve()`, `sum()`
* *`symbolic/maxima_wrapper.py`*: *
* *`calculus/calculus.py`*: `symbolic_expression_from_maxima_string()` called by `factor()` (#23835) and indirectly by `solve()`

Already done:
* *`Expression.coefficients()` and `poly()`*: (both #20455) 
* *`functions/orthogonal_polys.py`* (#22325): `hermite()` (#20297), `jacobi_P()` (#22326), `laguerre()` (#17151), `legendre_P/Q()` (#16813), `ultraspherical()` (#20428)
* *`functions/special.py`*: `SphericalHarmonic._eval_()` (#20939)
* *`combinat/combinat.py`*: `euler_number()` (see #17770 and #20763)
* *`geometry/lattice_polytope.py`*: `positive_integer_relations()` #20766

This can be considered part of the metaticket #16688. See also http://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/symbolics/maxima

Thanks for asking, I'm changing it.
