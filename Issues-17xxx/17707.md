This patch adds the module `sage.graphs.asteroidal_triples` and the methods for testing if a graph is asteroidal triple free (AT-free for short) or not.

It also connects the test to the `graph_classes`.

<a id='comment:3'></a>Hello,

Apparently something goes wrong with my second commit (http://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/commit/?id=0cb23b7b8064cc9bc96326e37172220264763609) but I don't know what.

Currently, I can compile sage with `sage -b` but I'm unable to run sage or to build the documentation. I don't know what's wrong.

Any help is more than welcome.

David.

<a id='comment:4'></a>Hello,

Nice code, it is simple and does the job. At the same time that an error has been reported in the implementation of `is_interval_graph`, it is almost tempting to replace our current implementation of it by `is_chordal and is_AT_Free` `;-)`

I will fix it soon, though. And I will probably need your help for the review.

About this branch: it is a bit weird to expose only a version of `is_at_free` that does not allow for a `certificate=True` flag, given that other recognition algorithms have it. Also, could you turn `AT` into `asteroidal_triple` in the functions' name ? We try to avoid abbreviations in Sage.

After this, I guess that I should be able to add a commit and we will be done here. I am a bit troubled by your "parameters": why not "input" ?

Good night,

I have integrated all your remarks.

Question: what should we do if the input graph is not connected? test all its connected components or raise a "notion defined for connected graph only" error?

PS: I had to do a distclean and to recompile everything (14hours). I don't know what happens, but something was broken...

No particular reason. At first, `is_asteroidal_triple_free` was returning only a yes/no answer. Now that it can also return a certificate, I can merge the methods if you prefer.
