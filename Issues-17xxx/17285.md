Is a solution involving the use of the (already defined) `.exp()` method acceptable on the short term (it may not lead to the thinest possible intervals), or do you think about some more accurate way of writing those ?

No.

I think it's acceptable to rely on `exp()` but instead, I would rather use the structure of the `exp()` method: completely reduce the computation to a computation in `RIF`.

The main reason is to avoid numerical noise (I want the cosine of a real number to be a real number). You have

```
sage: a = CIF(2,0)
sage: I = CIF.gen()
sage: ((I*a).exp() + (-I*a).exp()) / 2
-0.4161468365471424? + 0.?e-16*I
```
It should be fine to remove the imaginary branch, but then it would be less precise

```
sage: a = CIF(0,2)
sage: b1 = CIF(0, a.imag().cosh())
sage: b1.diameter()
1.33393183261575e-16
sage: b2 = ((I*a).exp() + (-I*a).exp()) / 2
sage: b2.diameter()
2.36079803558624e-16
```

New implementation using other trigonometric identities (and much faster).

For `tan` and `tanh` this is certainly not the best possible.
