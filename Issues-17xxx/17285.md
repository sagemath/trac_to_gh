I think it's acceptable to rely on `exp()` but instead, I would rather use the structure of the `exp()` method: completely reduce the computation to a computation in `RIF`.

The main reason is to avoid numerical noise (I want the cosine of a real number to be a real number). You have

```
sage: a = CIF(2,0)
sage: I = CIF.gen()
sage: ((I*a).exp() + (-I*a).exp()) / 2
-0.4161468365471424? + 0.?e-16*I
```
It should be fine to remove the imaginary branch, but then it would be less precise

```
sage: a = CIF(0,2)
sage: b1 = CIF(0, a.imag().cosh())
sage: b1.diameter()
1.33393183261575e-16
sage: b2 = ((I*a).exp() + (-I*a).exp()) / 2
sage: b2.diameter()
2.36079803558624e-16
```

<a id='comment:19'></a>Thanks for the review.

Just one related question. With the current code, if a `KeyboardInterrupt` happens in between the `sig_on/sig_off` block, then the code `mpfi_clear(tmp)` will never get called and hence the memory allocated to `tmp` will not be freed. Is there a clean solution for that?
