This ticket was originally about overriding checks to make poset creation faster. But this is actually already available: instead of `Poset(...)` one can use `FinitePoset(D, ..., category=FinitePosets, ...)`. For some lattices the time saving is huge, as there is no need to compute meet- or join-matrix; think about `BooleanLattice` used as an example of a poset, not as an example of lattice. (This could be documented somehow, "Advanced [SageMath](SageMath) Hacking" or something like that.)

However, currently for example `Posets.ChainPoset(500)` may takes 10 seconds. That is so because the constructors for common posets and lattices do not use this faster construction. Hence the new aim of the ticket is to change thst.

Travis, I guess we should close this one. But to be sure:

First, if I just say `n = 500; L1 = LatticePoset((range(n), [[x,x+1] for x in range(n-1)]))` it takes about two seconds. But if I say

```
n = 500
D = DiGraph([range(n), [[x,x+1] for x in range(n-1)]], format='vertices_and_edges')
from sage.combinat.posets.lattices import FiniteLatticePoset
L2 = FiniteLatticePoset(D, range(n), FiniteLatticePosets(), True)
```

it takes only 10 or 20 millisecods. Can you confirm that this works, and so there is a way to override check "is this poset really a poset (i.e. acyclic transitive reduction of graph)"?

Second, another possibility is that the code could directly compute le-matrix, Möbius function matrix etc, and those would be very easy for a chain, diamond and so one. But that is a place for another ticket.

Third, it is unnecessary to re-compute meet- or join-matrix. But that is a duplicate of #20434 or #18776.

Do you mean only mandatory checks, i.e. `is_poset` and having a join matrix and a bottom element (or meet matrix and top), or more precomputation?

Ah, the "hasse diagram" -parameter is not Hasse diagram in a sense that `hasse_diagram.py` defines... I.e. it is just a DiGraph with some properties as an unlabeled graph. So something like this could work:

```
from sage.combinat.posets.lattices import FiniteLatticePoset
from sage.categories.finite_lattice_posets import FiniteLatticePosets
n = 10^12
Div_n = divisors(n)
D = DiGraph([Div_n, lambda a, b: b%a==0 and is_prime(b//a)])
L = FiniteLatticePoset(D, elements=Div_n, category=FiniteLatticePosets())
```

This is faster than current implementation, but could be made even faster with some thinking. Having a natural linear extension would even make some small examples better; currently `Posets.DivisorLattice(12).join_irreducibles()` will give `[2, 4, 3]`.

It is natural in a way, but I don't have any opinion on this.

Just pinging. As you can see from

```
g = DiGraph({0: [1]})
g._pos={0: [0,0], 1: [1,1]}
g.show(layout='acyclic')
```

the `...pos=...` line does nothing.
