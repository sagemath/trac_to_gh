This ticket was originally about overriding checks to make poset creation faster. But this is actually already available: instead of `Poset(...)` one can use `FinitePoset(D, ..., category=FinitePosets, ...)`. For some lattices the time saving is huge, as there is no need to compute meet- or join-matrix; think about `BooleanLattice` used as an example of a poset, not as an example of lattice. (This could be documented somehow, "Advanced [SageMath](../wiki/SageMath) Hacking" or something like that.)

However, currently for example `Posets.ChainPoset(500)` may takes 10 seconds. That is so because the constructors for common posets and lattices do not use this faster construction. Hence the new aim of the ticket is to change thst.

Travis, I guess we should close this one. But to be sure:

First, if I just say `n = 500; L1 = LatticePoset((range(n), [[x,x+1] for x in range(n-1)]))` it takes about two seconds. But if I say

```
n = 500
D = DiGraph([range(n), [[x,x+1] for x in range(n-1)]], format='vertices_and_edges')
from sage.combinat.posets.lattices import FiniteLatticePoset
L2 = FiniteLatticePoset(D, range(n), FiniteLatticePosets(), True)
```

it takes only 10 or 20 millisecods. Can you confirm that this works, and so there is a way to override check "is this poset really a poset (i.e. acyclic transitive reduction of graph)"?

Second, another possibility is that the code could directly compute le-matrix, Möbius function matrix etc, and those would be very easy for a chain, diamond and so one. But that is a place for another ticket.

Third, it is unnecessary to re-compute meet- or join-matrix. But that is a duplicate of #20434 or #18776.

Do you mean only mandatory checks, i.e. `is_poset` and having a join matrix and a bottom element (or meet matrix and top), or more precomputation?

In specific functions at `lattice_examples.py` that creates, say, `DivisorLattice`?

Does everything work? I.e. meets, joins, listing elements, linear extension is OK and so on? How about unique representation?

Unique representation is handled by the `FinitePoset` class and our input is basically the result from going through `Poset`. IIRC, the default for fixed linear extensions is to not have one.

> Like this?

Yes.

> Does everything work? I.e. meets, joins, listing elements, linear extension is OK and so on? How about unique representation?

AFAIK, yes, but I don't have time immediately to test it. Unique representation is handled by the `FinitePoset` class and our input is basically the result from going through `Poset`. IIRC, the default for fixed linear extensions is to not have one. The others look like they are naturally the same from going through `Poset` as well.

Ah, the "hasse diagram" -parameter is not Hasse diagram in a sense that `hasse_diagram.py` defines... I.e. it is just a DiGraph with some properties as an unlabeled graph. So something like this could work:

```
from sage.combinat.posets.lattices import FiniteLatticePoset
from sage.categories.finite_lattice_posets import FiniteLatticePosets
n = 10^12
Div_n = divisors(n)
D = DiGraph([Div_n, lambda a, b: b%a==0 and is_prime(b//a)])
L = FiniteLatticePoset(D, elements=Div_n, category=FiniteLatticePosets())
```

This is faster than current implementation, but could be made even faster with some thinking. Having a natural linear extension would even make some small examples better; currently `Posets.DivisorLattice(12).join_irreducibles()` will give `[2, 4, 3]`.

Looking at the code more, the original didn't actually set the `_pos` because it was doing it to a copy of the Hasse diagram. So it is okay I guess...it does have some effect on the `HasseDiagram` when done correctly, but like I said, it wasn't actually doing it correctly anyways.
