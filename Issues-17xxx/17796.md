The gp interface configuration is split between the gprc.expect file shipped by the pari spkg, and the src/sage/interface/gp.py code.

I would like everything to be done in the gp.py code.

I'll try to attach a branch fixing the issue as soon as I manage to make git-trac behave.

Ok, the branch name is pretty bad (I thought "git trac create -h" would give me help, not create a ticket and call everything help...), but here it compiles and passes all doctests.
