We intend to implement asymptotic expansions in SageMath. We would like to do computations with simple expansions such as

n<sup>2</sup> + n<sup>3/2</sup> + O(n<sup>1/2</sup>),

but also with expansions such as

2<sup>n</sup> * n + O(n*log(n))

or even multivariate expansions such as

3*k/n + O(k<sup>2</sup> / n<sup>2</sup>) with |k| <= n<sup>(1/2)</sup>.

Of course, O(n) - O(n) = O(n) must hold and we want to perform various arithmetic operations with these asymptotic expansions. Eventually, specified O-constants shall also be supported.

containing all features can be found in branch `public/asy/trunk`.

Thanks---I'm involved in both tickets ;)

At the moment both are independent, but when the asymptotic expressions are created, one can use them in the calculations (or at least as a possible output format) in #10519.

<a id='comment:13'></a>Hi,

Whatever you propose, I would say that the most important thing to do is to consider the integration into Sage. In other words:
- how it will be used from Sage
- how it does interact with the Symbolic ring, polynomials, fraction fields, power series and any objects where asymptotic makes sens
I do not see any of this in the ticket description. And it is definitely important to think of it **before** starting the implementation.

I only see a list of classes, parents and elements whose goal is basically to mimic the symbolic ring by adding some big Oh. I do not see the point of creating so much classes to handle asymptotic terms. Please, motivate and explain your choices.

Vincent

I rather think of it as a version of the `PowerSeriesRing` with additional features (non-integer exponents, several (not completely independent) variables).

+We intend to implement asymptotic expressions in Sage. We would like to do computations with simple expressions such as
+
+n<sup>2</sup> + n<sup>3/2</sup> + O(n<sup>1/2</sup>),
+
+but also with expressions such as
+
+2<sup>n</sup> * n + O(n*log(n))
+
+or even multivariate expressions such as
+
+3*k/n + O(k<sup>2</sup> / n<sup>2</sup>) with |k| <= n<sup>(1/2)</sup>.
+
+Of course, O(n) - O(n) = O(n) must hold.
+
+Eventually, specified O-constants shall also be supported.
+
+The current plan is to implement the following classes (plus derivatives for more concrete situations). For simplicity, the corresponding parents are not listed here.
+
+
+ AsymptoticGrowthElement:: hold _one_ term, e.g. n<sup>2</sup> or k/n or n*log(n). This can compare, multiply etc., but has **no** coefficient. Here, only the order of magnitude shall be managed.
+
+ AsymptoticTerm:: 
+
+  holds one AsymptoticGrowthElement, plus information on the coefficient or that it is an O-term etc.
+
+ AsymptoticExpression:: 
+
+  represents the sum of several AsymptoticTerms.
+
+The idea is to override AsymptoticGrowthElement to obtain specific behaviour (as mentioned in our wishlist) because it seems unlikely to be able to handle everything in one class.
+For starters, there will be an GrowthGroupPowerElement.
+
+AsymptoticTerm is expected to be more general; it might be necessary to override it for the case of specified O-constants.
+
+AsymptoticExpression, however, can be general enough to deal with all cases; here, the sum, the product, the exponential function, etc. are implemented in a generic setting.
+
+---
+
+**Roadmap**:
+
+
+* Implementing a minimal working example
+    * #17600 (AsymptoticGrowthElement): elements which handle the asymptotic growth. Concretely: MonomialGrowthElement, implementation for powers.
+    * #17715 (AsymptoticTerm): "building blocks" for asymptotic expressions, they contain the growth and additional information on the type of the term. For starters, there will be big-Oh terms and exact terms.
+    * #17693 (MutablePoset): data structure for storing asymptotic terms within an asymptotic expression.
+    * #17716 (AsymptoticExpression): sum of asymptotic terms.
+
+* Extending the functionality of AsymptoticExpression
+    * Implement Division for asymptotic Expressions
+    * Implement higher-order operations like \`exp\` and \`log\` for asymptotic expressions.
+    * Improve the user interface: extend the conversion from the symbolic ring such that more than just monomials can be converted.
+    * Implement comparison for asymptotic expressions.
+
+* Extending the functionality of growth groups
+    * More growth group implementations: logarithmic and exponential growth groups.
+    * #18587: cartesian products for growth groups (allowing the construction of more complicated univariate as well as multivariate asymptotic expressions)
+        * #18223: cartesian products with orders
+        * #18586: passing on parameters and extra_category for cartesian products
+        * implement dependencies like |k| <= n<sup>1/2</sup> for different growth group variables.
+
+* Further plans
+    * growth groups with asymptotic at a non-infinity point
+    * Implementation of more types of asymptotic terms (little-oh terms, omega-terms, variations of big-Oh terms ...)
+
+
+* Additional Dependencies:
+    * #18182: pushout construction and finding common parents for/including cartesian products
+    * #18222: provide <=, <, >=, > for poset elements by the category (depends on #10130)

+We intend to implement asymptotic expressions in Sage. We would like to do computations with simple expressions such as

+Of course, O(n) - O(n) = O(n) must hold.

+Eventually, specified O-constants shall also be supported.
+
+The current plan is to implement the following classes (plus derivatives for more concrete situations). For simplicity, the corresponding parents are not listed here.
+
+
+ AsymptoticGrowthElement:: hold _one_ term, e.g. n<sup>2</sup> or k/n or n*log(n). This can compare, multiply etc., but has **no** coefficient. Here, only the order of magnitude shall be managed.
+
+ AsymptoticTerm:: 
+
+  holds one AsymptoticGrowthElement, plus information on the coefficient or that it is an O-term etc.
+
+ AsymptoticExpression:: 
+
+  represents the sum of several AsymptoticTerms.
+
+The idea is to override AsymptoticGrowthElement to obtain specific behaviour (as mentioned in our wishlist) because it seems unlikely to be able to handle everything in one class.
+For starters, there will be an GrowthGroupPowerElement.
+
+AsymptoticTerm is expected to be more general; it might be necessary to override it for the case of specified O-constants.
+
+AsymptoticExpression, however, can be general enough to deal with all cases; here, the sum, the product, the exponential function, etc. are implemented in a generic setting.

+We intend to implement asymptotic expressions in Sage. We would like to do computations with simple expressions such as

+n<sup>2</sup> + n<sup>3/2</sup> + O(n<sup>1/2</sup>),
+

+
+2<sup>n</sup> * n + O(n*log(n))

+3*k/n + O(k<sup>2</sup> / n<sup>2</sup>) with |k| <= n<sup>(1/2)</sup>.
+
+Of course, O(n) - O(n) = O(n) must hold and we want to perform various arithmetic operations with these asymptotic expressions. Eventually, specified O-constants shall also be supported.

+We intend to implement asymptotic expansions in SageMath. We would like to do computations with simple expansions such as
+
+n<sup>2</sup> + n<sup>3/2</sup> + O(n<sup>1/2</sup>),
+
+but also with expansions such as
+
+2<sup>n</sup> * n + O(n*log(n))
+
+or even multivariate expansions such as
+
+3*k/n + O(k<sup>2</sup> / n<sup>2</sup>) with |k| <= n<sup>(1/2)</sup>.
+
+Of course, O(n) - O(n) = O(n) must hold and we want to perform various arithmetic operations with these asymptotic expansions. Eventually, specified O-constants shall also be supported.
+
+---
+
+See #17716 and #19083 for more examples and the documentation files there for a more detailed description. A working prototype can be found in branch \`u/dkrenn/asy/prototype\`.

+
+**Roadmap**:
+
+
+* Implementing a minimal working example
+    * #17600 (AsymptoticGrowthElement): elements which handle the asymptotic growth. Such an element holds, e.g. n<sup>2</sup> or k/n or n*log(n). This can compare, multiply etc., but has **no** coefficient; the order of magnitude is managed here. Concretely for this ticket: MonomialGrowthElement, implementation for powers.
+    * #18930: Factory for user-friendly generation of growth groups
+    * #17715 (AsymptoticTerm): a summand for asymptotic expansions. They contain the growth and additional information on the type of the summand. For starters, there will be big-Oh terms (e.g. \`O(n)\` and exact terms (e.g. \`3*n^2\`). 
+    * #17693 (MutablePoset): data structure for storing asymptotic terms within an asymptotic expansions.
+    * #17716 (AsymptoticRing and AsymptoticExpansion): sum of asymptotic terms.
+
+* Extending the functionality of growth groups
+    * #18587: cartesian products for growth groups (allowing the construction of more complicated univariate as well as multivariate asymptotic expansions)
+        * #18223: cartesian products with orders
+        * #18586: passing on parameters and extra_category for cartesian products
+    * #19028: More growth group implementations: exponential growth groups.
+
+* Extending the functionality of the AsymptoticRing and AsymptoticExpansion
+    * #19048: \`AsymptoticRing.an_element()\`
+        * #19047: \`QQ.some_elements()\`
+        * #19319: iterator over pairs on diagonals a la Cantor pairing 
+    * #19068: Implement Division for asymptotic expansions.
+    * #19073: categorial constructions, pushout and coercions (extended) for asymptotic ring and growth groups

+        * #19079: ConstructionFunctor: remove \`__str__\`
+    * #19094: Implement higher-order operations like \`exp\` and \`log\` for asymptotic expansions.
+    * #19083: AsymptoticRing: cleanup, some improvements, documentation.
+    * #19400: move code to sage.asymptotic
+
+* Bugs and minor improvements
+    * #19399: let category of growth group be determined by input
+    * #19411: hidden but caught infinite loop in action of cartesian products of growth groups
+    * #19412: log of an asymptotic expansion ignores coefficient ring
+
+* Further plans
+    * for growth groups
+        * implement dependencies like |k| <= n<sup>1/2</sup> for different growth group variables.
+        * growth groups with asymptotic at a non-infinity point
+    * other
+        * Deal with comparison for asymptotic expansions.
+        * Check and improve the performance of computations in the AsymptoticRing.
+        * Implementation of more types of asymptotic terms (little-oh terms, omega-terms, variations of big-Oh terms ...)
+        * #19300: Run benchmarks on \`MutablePoset.remove\` to decide between two algorithms.
+        * #19305: substitution of asymptotic expansions
+        * #19306: common generators for asymptotic expansions
+            * #19259: subrings of the symbolic ring
+        * #19316 compute asymptotic expansion to some rational directly
+
+* Additional dependencies
+    * #19017: Easy access to the \`O\`-constructor in \`big_oh.py\`.
+    * #19110: QQ(0)<sup>-1</sup> raises SIGFPE (which is caught)
+
+* Other related Tickets:
+    * #18222: provide <=, <, >=, > for poset elements by the category (depends on #10130)
+    * #19088 multi-line doctests fail when using angle notation (preparser) 
+    * #19269: add category Posets to ZZ and QQ

+We intend to implement asymptotic expansions in SageMath. We would like to do computations with simple expansions such as

+We intend to implement asymptotic expansions in SageMath. We would like to do computations with simple expansions such as

+We intend to implement asymptotic expansions in SageMath. We would like to do computations with simple expansions such as

Yes, and you could get a lot of leverage out of making that link more prominent. In fact, the appropriate concept would be "Puiseux series", which are Laurent series (with negative exponents allowed) in fractional powers of your variables.

For asymptotic expansions you have x+O(x<sup>(1/2)</sup>) = O(x<sup>(1/2)</sup>), which is consistent with Puiseux series in t=1/x.

The usual implementation for Puiseux series is as

[d,N,a[N],a[N+1],a[N+2],...,finite number of terms]

meaning

sum_{i=N..} a_i* x^(i/d)

For arithmetic you just first bring series in common denominator "d" and then do power series arithmetic.

For multivariate series, the appropriate behaviour is caught by "local term orders". SingularLib might offer some useful things already.

Note that a series in n and log(n) can be treated as a bivariate series, with an appropriate term order on the variables signifying "n" and "log(n)", for asymptotic series probably again modelling these with X=1/n and Y= 1/log(n).

So I think this ticket can be realized by implementing "multivariate puiseux series", which would be useful in a lot of settings. It would be better if (the underlying ring) would also be called "multivariate puiseux series ring" because that would improve discoverability.

Searching the literature for these terms will probably also make it easier to find relevant algorithms.

We've planned to do so, once asymptotic expansions at `0` are implemented (currently everything is only at `oo`).

We are aware of Puiseux series.
The restrictions imposed by Puiseux series are that they cannot handle non-rational exponents like `sqrt(2)` or symbolic constants. However, we'd like to be able to handle these.
Moreover, we can work with terms like `exp(x+O(1))=O(exp(x))`.

In addition to the relation between `n` and `log(n)`, our asymptotic expansions will be able to handle dependencies between the variables as well, e.g. `x <= sqrt(y)`.

> So I think this ticket can be realized by implementing "multivariate puiseux series", which would be useful in a lot of settings. It would be better if (the underlying ring) would also be called "multivariate puiseux series ring" because that would improve discoverability.


As mentioned above, once we have expansions at `0`, we have a MultivariatePuiseuxSeriesRing as a special case; renaming it now is not expedient.

+We intend to implement asymptotic expansions in SageMath. We would like to do computations with simple expansions such as
+
+n<sup>2</sup> + n<sup>3/2</sup> + O(n<sup>1/2</sup>),
+
+but also with expansions such as
+
+2<sup>n</sup> * n + O(n*log(n))
+
+or even multivariate expansions such as
+
+3*k/n + O(k<sup>2</sup> / n<sup>2</sup>) with |k| <= n<sup>(1/2)</sup>.
+
+Of course, O(n) - O(n) = O(n) must hold and we want to perform various arithmetic operations with these asymptotic expansions. Eventually, specified O-constants shall also be supported.

+
+See [the documentation files](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/asymptotic/sage/rings/asymptotic/asymptotic_ring.html) for a more examples and a detailed description. A working prototype is include in SageMath 6.10 and a version
+containing all features can be found in branch \`public/asy/trunk\`.
+
+---
+
+**Roadmap**:
+
+
+* Implementing a minimal working example
+    * #17600 (AsymptoticGrowthElement): elements which handle the asymptotic growth. Such an element holds, e.g. n<sup>2</sup> or k/n or n*log(n). This can compare, multiply etc., but has **no** coefficient; the order of magnitude is managed here. Concretely for this ticket: MonomialGrowthElement, implementation for powers.
+    * #18930: Factory for user-friendly generation of growth groups
+    * #17715 (AsymptoticTerm): a summand for asymptotic expansions. They contain the growth and additional information on the type of the summand. For starters, there will be big-Oh terms (e.g. \`O(n)\` and exact terms (e.g. \`3*n^2\`). 
+    * #17693 (MutablePoset): data structure for storing asymptotic terms within an asymptotic expansions.
+    * #17716 (AsymptoticRing and AsymptoticExpansion): sum of asymptotic terms.
+
+* Extending the functionality of growth groups

+

+    * #19048: \`AsymptoticRing.an_element()\`
+        * #19047: \`QQ.some_elements()\`
+        * #19319: iterator over pairs on diagonals a la Cantor pairing 
+    * #19068: Implement Division for asymptotic expansions.
+    * #19073: categorial constructions, pushout and coercions (extended) for asymptotic ring and growth groups
+        * #18182: pushout construction and finding common parents for/including cartesian products
+        * #19079: ConstructionFunctor: remove \`__str__\`
+    * #19083: AsymptoticRing: \`exp\`, \`log\`, cleanup, some improvements, documentation.
+        * contains #19094: Implement higher-order operations like \`exp\` and \`log\` for asymptotic expansions
+    * #19400: move documentation to sage.asymptotic
+
+* Bugs and minor improvements
+    * #19399: let category of growth group be determined by input
+    * #19411: hidden but caught infinite loop in action of cartesian products of growth groups

+    * #19429: extend conversion from SR to growth groups: allow inverses
+    * #19431: convert asymptotic expansion to the symbolic ring
+        * #19436: fixup of #19431
+        * #19437: SR.symbol: correct parent in inherting classes of SymbolicRing

+We intend to implement asymptotic expansions in SageMath. We would like to do computations with simple expansions such as

+We intend to implement asymptotic expansions in SageMath. We would like to do computations with simple expansions such as
+
+n<sup>2</sup> + n<sup>3/2</sup> + O(n<sup>1/2</sup>),
+
+but also with expansions such as
+
+2<sup>n</sup> * n + O(n*log(n))
+
+or even multivariate expansions such as
+
+3*k/n + O(k<sup>2</sup> / n<sup>2</sup>) with |k| <= n<sup>(1/2)</sup>.
+
+Of course, O(n) - O(n) = O(n) must hold and we want to perform various arithmetic operations with these asymptotic expansions. Eventually, specified O-constants shall also be supported.

+We intend to implement asymptotic expansions in SageMath. We would like to do computations with simple expansions such as
+
+n<sup>2</sup> + n<sup>3/2</sup> + O(n<sup>1/2</sup>),
+
+but also with expansions such as
+
+2<sup>n</sup> * n + O(n*log(n))
+
+or even multivariate expansions such as
+
+3*k/n + O(k<sup>2</sup> / n<sup>2</sup>) with |k| <= n<sup>(1/2)</sup>.
+
+Of course, O(n) - O(n) = O(n) must hold and we want to perform various arithmetic operations with these asymptotic expansions. Eventually, specified O-constants shall also be supported.

+We intend to implement asymptotic expansions in SageMath. We would like to do computations with simple expansions such as
+
+n<sup>2</sup> + n<sup>3/2</sup> + O(n<sup>1/2</sup>),
+
+but also with expansions such as
+
+2<sup>n</sup> * n + O(n*log(n))
+
+or even multivariate expansions such as
+
+3*k/n + O(k<sup>2</sup> / n<sup>2</sup>) with |k| <= n<sup>(1/2)</sup>.
+
+Of course, O(n) - O(n) = O(n) must hold and we want to perform various arithmetic operations with these asymptotic expansions. Eventually, specified O-constants shall also be supported.

+
+See [the documentation files](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/asymptotic/sage/rings/asymptotic/asymptotic_ring.html) for a more examples and a detailed description. A working prototype is include in SageMath 6.10 and a version

+
+**Roadmap**:
+
+
+* Implementing a minimal working example
+    * #17600 (AsymptoticGrowthElement): elements which handle the asymptotic growth. Such an element holds, e.g. n<sup>2</sup> or k/n or n*log(n). This can compare, multiply etc., but has **no** coefficient; the order of magnitude is managed here. Concretely for this ticket: MonomialGrowthElement, implementation for powers.
+    * #18930: Factory for user-friendly generation of growth groups
+    * #17715 (AsymptoticTerm): a summand for asymptotic expansions. They contain the growth and additional information on the type of the summand. For starters, there will be big-Oh terms (e.g. \`O(n)\` and exact terms (e.g. \`3*n^2\`). 
+    * #17693 (MutablePoset): data structure for storing asymptotic terms within an asymptotic expansions.
+    * #17716 (AsymptoticRing and AsymptoticExpansion): sum of asymptotic terms.
+
+* Extending the functionality of growth groups
+    * #18587: cartesian products for growth groups (allowing the construction of more complicated univariate as well as multivariate asymptotic expansions)
+        * #18223: cartesian products with orders
+        * #18586: passing on parameters and extra_category for cartesian products
+    * #19028: More growth group implementations: exponential growth groups.
+
+* Extending the functionality of the AsymptoticRing and AsymptoticExpansion
+    * #19048: \`AsymptoticRing.an_element()\`
+        * #19047: \`QQ.some_elements()\`

+    * #19083: AsymptoticRing: \`exp\`, \`log\`, cleanup, some improvements, documentation.

+We intend to implement asymptotic expansions in SageMath. We would like to do computations with simple expansions such as
+
+n<sup>2</sup> + n<sup>3/2</sup> + O(n<sup>1/2</sup>),
+
+but also with expansions such as
+
+2<sup>n</sup> * n + O(n*log(n))
+
+or even multivariate expansions such as
+
+3*k/n + O(k<sup>2</sup> / n<sup>2</sup>) with |k| <= n<sup>(1/2)</sup>.
+
+Of course, O(n) - O(n) = O(n) must hold and we want to perform various arithmetic operations with these asymptotic expansions. Eventually, specified O-constants shall also be supported.

+
+See [the documentation files](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/asymptotic/sage/rings/asymptotic/asymptotic_ring.html) for a more examples and a detailed description. A working prototype is include in SageMath 6.10 and a version
+containing all features can be found in branch \`public/asy/trunk\`.
+
+---
+
+**Roadmap**:
+
+
+* Implementing a minimal working example
+    * #17600 (AsymptoticGrowthElement): elements which handle the asymptotic growth. Such an element holds, e.g. n<sup>2</sup> or k/n or n*log(n). This can compare, multiply etc., but has **no** coefficient; the order of magnitude is managed here. Concretely for this ticket: MonomialGrowthElement, implementation for powers.
+    * #18930: Factory for user-friendly generation of growth groups
+    * #17715 (AsymptoticTerm): a summand for asymptotic expansions. They contain the growth and additional information on the type of the summand. For starters, there will be big-Oh terms (e.g. \`O(n)\` and exact terms (e.g. \`3*n^2\`). 
+    * #17693 (MutablePoset): data structure for storing asymptotic terms within an asymptotic expansions.
+    * #17716 (AsymptoticRing and AsymptoticExpansion): sum of asymptotic terms.
+
+* Extending the functionality of growth groups
+    * #18587: cartesian products for growth groups (allowing the construction of more complicated univariate as well as multivariate asymptotic expansions)
+        * #18223: cartesian products with orders
+        * #18586: passing on parameters and extra_category for cartesian products
+    * #19028: More growth group implementations: exponential growth groups.
+
+* Extending the functionality of the AsymptoticRing and AsymptoticExpansion
+    * #19048: \`AsymptoticRing.an_element()\`
+        * #19047: \`QQ.some_elements()\`
+        * #19319: iterator over pairs on diagonals a la Cantor pairing 
+    * #19068: Implement Division for asymptotic expansions.
+    * #19073: categorial constructions, pushout and coercions (extended) for asymptotic ring and growth groups
+        * #18182: pushout construction and finding common parents for/including cartesian products
+        * #19079: ConstructionFunctor: remove \`__str__\`
+    * #19083: AsymptoticRing: \`exp\`, \`log\`, cleanup, some improvements, documentation.
+        * contains #19094: Implement higher-order operations like \`exp\` and \`log\` for asymptotic expansions
+    * #19400: move documentation to sage.asymptotic
+
+* Additional dependencies
+    * #19017: Easy access to the \`O\`-constructor in \`big_oh.py\`.
+    * #19110: QQ(0)<sup>-1</sup> raises SIGFPE (which is caught)
+
+* We have a working prototype (made of the tickets above).
+
+* Arithmetic, categories and coercion (bugs and improvements)
+    * #19399: let category of growth group be determined by input
+    * #19316: compute asymptotic expansion to some rational directly
+    * #19411: hidden but caught infinite loop in action of cartesian products of growth groups
+    * #19412: log of an asymptotic expansion ignores coefficient ring
+    * #19420: make log of growth elements to the base of some powers of elements possible 
+    * #19423: AsymptoticExpansion: combine shared code of invert, log, exp 
+    * #19577: performance improvement of mutable poset used for univariate asymptotic expansions
+    * #20000: sqrt of AsymptoticExpansion
+
+* Conversion (bugs and improvements)

+        * #19965: parent of exponent getting too large in exponentiation in asymptotic ring
+    * #19947: conversion SR to asymptotic ring
+
+* Other bugs and minor improvements

+We intend to implement asymptotic expansions in SageMath. We would like to do computations with simple expansions such as
+
+n<sup>2</sup> + n<sup>3/2</sup> + O(n<sup>1/2</sup>),
+
+but also with expansions such as
+
+2<sup>n</sup> * n + O(n*log(n))
+
+or even multivariate expansions such as
+
+3*k/n + O(k<sup>2</sup> / n<sup>2</sup>) with |k| <= n<sup>(1/2)</sup>.
+
+Of course, O(n) - O(n) = O(n) must hold and we want to perform various arithmetic operations with these asymptotic expansions. Eventually, specified O-constants shall also be supported.

+We intend to implement asymptotic expansions in SageMath. We would like to do computations with simple expansions such as
+
+n<sup>2</sup> + n<sup>3/2</sup> + O(n<sup>1/2</sup>),
+
+but also with expansions such as
+
+2<sup>n</sup> * n + O(n*log(n))
+
+or even multivariate expansions such as
+
+3*k/n + O(k<sup>2</sup> / n<sup>2</sup>) with |k| <= n<sup>(1/2)</sup>.
+
+Of course, O(n) - O(n) = O(n) must hold and we want to perform various arithmetic operations with these asymptotic expansions. Eventually, specified O-constants shall also be supported.
+

+
+See [the documentation files](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/asymptotic/sage/rings/asymptotic/asymptotic_ring.html) for a more examples and a detailed description. A working prototype is include in SageMath 6.10 and a version
+containing all features can be found in branch \`public/asy/trunk\`.
+

+
+**Roadmap**:
+
+
+* Implementing a minimal working example
+    * #17600 (AsymptoticGrowthElement): elements which handle the asymptotic growth. Such an element holds, e.g. n<sup>2</sup> or k/n or n*log(n). This can compare, multiply etc., but has **no** coefficient; the order of magnitude is managed here. Concretely for this ticket: MonomialGrowthElement, implementation for powers.
+    * #18930: Factory for user-friendly generation of growth groups
+    * #17715 (AsymptoticTerm): a summand for asymptotic expansions. They contain the growth and additional information on the type of the summand. For starters, there will be big-Oh terms (e.g. \`O(n)\` and exact terms (e.g. \`3*n^2\`). 
+    * #17693 (MutablePoset): data structure for storing asymptotic terms within an asymptotic expansions.
+    * #17716 (AsymptoticRing and AsymptoticExpansion): sum of asymptotic terms.

+    * #19028: More growth group implementations: exponential growth groups.
+
+* Extending the functionality of the AsymptoticRing and AsymptoticExpansion
+    * #19048: \`AsymptoticRing.an_element()\`

+We intend to implement asymptotic expansions in SageMath. We would like to do computations with simple expansions such as
+
+n<sup>2</sup> + n<sup>3/2</sup> + O(n<sup>1/2</sup>),
+
+but also with expansions such as
+
+2<sup>n</sup> * n + O(n*log(n))
+
+or even multivariate expansions such as
+
+3*k/n + O(k<sup>2</sup> / n<sup>2</sup>) with |k| <= n<sup>(1/2)</sup>.
+
+Of course, O(n) - O(n) = O(n) must hold and we want to perform various arithmetic operations with these asymptotic expansions. Eventually, specified O-constants shall also be supported.

+    * #18930: Factory for user-friendly generation of growth groups
+    * #17715 (AsymptoticTerm): a summand for asymptotic expansions. They contain the growth and additional information on the type of the summand. For starters, there will be big-Oh terms (e.g. \`O(n)\` and exact terms (e.g. \`3*n^2\`).

+We intend to implement asymptotic expansions in SageMath. We would like to do computations with simple expansions such as
+
+n<sup>2</sup> + n<sup>3/2</sup> + O(n<sup>1/2</sup>),
+
+but also with expansions such as
+
+2<sup>n</sup> * n + O(n*log(n))
+
+or even multivariate expansions such as
+
+3*k/n + O(k<sup>2</sup> / n<sup>2</sup>) with |k| <= n<sup>(1/2)</sup>.
+
+Of course, O(n) - O(n) = O(n) must hold and we want to perform various arithmetic operations with these asymptotic expansions. Eventually, specified O-constants shall also be supported.
+

+
+See [the documentation files](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/asymptotic/sage/rings/asymptotic/asymptotic_ring.html) for a more examples and a detailed description. A working prototype is include in SageMath 6.10 and a version
+containing all features can be found in branch \`public/asy/trunk\`.

+
+**Roadmap**:
+
+
+* Implementing a minimal working example
+    * #17600 (AsymptoticGrowthElement): elements which handle the asymptotic growth. Such an element holds, e.g. n<sup>2</sup> or k/n or n*log(n). This can compare, multiply etc., but has **no** coefficient; the order of magnitude is managed here. Concretely for this ticket: MonomialGrowthElement, implementation for powers.
+    * #18930: Factory for user-friendly generation of growth groups
+    * #17715 (AsymptoticTerm): a summand for asymptotic expansions. They contain the growth and additional information on the type of the summand. For starters, there will be big-Oh terms (e.g. \`O(n)\` and exact terms (e.g. \`3*n^2\`). 
+    * #17693 (MutablePoset): data structure for storing asymptotic terms within an asymptotic expansions.
+    * #17716 (AsymptoticRing and AsymptoticExpansion): sum of asymptotic terms.
+
+* Extending the functionality of growth groups
+    * #18587: cartesian products for growth groups (allowing the construction of more complicated univariate as well as multivariate asymptotic expansions)
+        * #18223: cartesian products with orders
+        * #18586: passing on parameters and extra_category for cartesian products
+    * #19028: More growth group implementations: exponential growth groups.
+
+* Extending the functionality of the AsymptoticRing and AsymptoticExpansion
+    * #19048: \`AsymptoticRing.an_element()\`
+        * #19047: \`QQ.some_elements()\`
+        * #19319: iterator over pairs on diagonals a la Cantor pairing

+        * contains #19094: Implement higher-order operations like \`exp\` and \`log\` for asymptotic expansions
+    * #19400: move documentation to sage.asymptotic
+
+* Additional dependencies
+    * #19017: Easy access to the \`O\`-constructor in \`big_oh.py\`.
+    * #19110: QQ(0)<sup>-1</sup> raises SIGFPE (which is caught)
+
+* We have a working prototype (made of the tickets above).
+
+* Arithmetic, categories and coercion (bugs and improvements)
+    * #19399: let category of growth group be determined by input

+    * #19423: AsymptoticExpansion: combine shared code of invert, log, exp 
+    * #19577: performance improvement of mutable poset used for univariate asymptotic expansions

+We intend to implement asymptotic expansions in SageMath. We would like to do computations with simple expansions such as

+We intend to implement asymptotic expansions in SageMath. We would like to do computations with simple expansions such as
+
+n<sup>2</sup> + n<sup>3/2</sup> + O(n<sup>1/2</sup>),
+
+but also with expansions such as
+
+2<sup>n</sup> * n + O(n*log(n))
+
+or even multivariate expansions such as
+
+3*k/n + O(k<sup>2</sup> / n<sup>2</sup>) with |k| <= n<sup>(1/2)</sup>.
+
+Of course, O(n) - O(n) = O(n) must hold and we want to perform various arithmetic operations with these asymptotic expansions. Eventually, specified O-constants shall also be supported.
+
+---
+
+See [the documentation files](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/asymptotic/sage/rings/asymptotic/asymptotic_ring.html) for a more examples and a detailed description. A working prototype is include in SageMath 6.10 and a version
+containing all features can be found in branch \`public/asy/trunk\`.
+
+---
+
+**Roadmap**:
+
+
+* Implementing a minimal working example
+    * #17600 (AsymptoticGrowthElement): elements which handle the asymptotic growth. Such an element holds, e.g. n<sup>2</sup> or k/n or n*log(n). This can compare, multiply etc., but has **no** coefficient; the order of magnitude is managed here. Concretely for this ticket: MonomialGrowthElement, implementation for powers.
+    * #18930: Factory for user-friendly generation of growth groups
+    * #17715 (AsymptoticTerm): a summand for asymptotic expansions. They contain the growth and additional information on the type of the summand. For starters, there will be big-Oh terms (e.g. \`O(n)\` and exact terms (e.g. \`3*n^2\`). 
+    * #17693 (MutablePoset): data structure for storing asymptotic terms within an asymptotic expansions.
+    * #17716 (AsymptoticRing and AsymptoticExpansion): sum of asymptotic terms.
+
+* Extending the functionality of growth groups
+    * #18587: cartesian products for growth groups (allowing the construction of more complicated univariate as well as multivariate asymptotic expansions)
+        * #18223: cartesian products with orders
+        * #18586: passing on parameters and extra_category for cartesian products
+    * #19028: More growth group implementations: exponential growth groups.
+
+* Extending the functionality of the AsymptoticRing and AsymptoticExpansion
+    * #19048: \`AsymptoticRing.an_element()\`
+        * #19047: \`QQ.some_elements()\`
+        * #19319: iterator over pairs on diagonals a la Cantor pairing 
+    * #19068: Implement Division for asymptotic expansions.
+    * #19073: categorial constructions, pushout and coercions (extended) for asymptotic ring and growth groups
+        * #18182: pushout construction and finding common parents for/including cartesian products
+        * #19079: ConstructionFunctor: remove \`__str__\`
+    * #19083: AsymptoticRing: \`exp\`, \`log\`, cleanup, some improvements, documentation.
+        * contains #19094: Implement higher-order operations like \`exp\` and \`log\` for asymptotic expansions
+    * #19400: move documentation to sage.asymptotic
+
+* Additional dependencies
+    * #19017: Easy access to the \`O\`-constructor in \`big_oh.py\`.
+    * #19110: QQ(0)<sup>-1</sup> raises SIGFPE (which is caught)
+
+* We have a working prototype (made of the tickets above).
+
+* Arithmetic, categories and coercion (bugs and improvements)
+    * #19399: let category of growth group be determined by input
+    * #19316: compute asymptotic expansion to some rational directly
+    * #19411: hidden but caught infinite loop in action of cartesian products of growth groups
+    * #19412: log of an asymptotic expansion ignores coefficient ring
+    * #19420: make log of growth elements to the base of some powers of elements possible 
+    * #19423: AsymptoticExpansion: combine shared code of invert, log, exp 
+    * #19577: performance improvement of mutable poset used for univariate asymptotic expansions
+    * #20000: sqrt of AsymptoticExpansion
+    * #20043: multiplication with zero fails
+    * #20044: calculate asymptotic expansions to some asymptotic expansions exponents directly
+    * #21665: \`AsymptoticRing.substitute\` fails with exponents in QQbar 
+    * #22396: AsymptoticRing default_prec lost with coercion
+
+* Conversion (bugs and improvements)

+        * #19425: Order in symbolic ring: error calling operator
