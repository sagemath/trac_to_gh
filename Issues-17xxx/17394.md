When calling `simplify_hypergeometric()` on an expression with two variables, sometimes a `TypeError` is thrown:

```
sage: y = SR.symbol('y')
sage: f = x*y + x + y
sage: f.simplify_hypergeometric()
```

produces,

```

<a id='comment:1'></a>It's simply this:

```
sage: A=SR(x+y+x*y)
sage: A.operator()(*A.operands())
TypeError: op_add expected 2 arguments, got 3
sage: A.operator()
sage: A.operator()
<built-in function add>
```
We should probably not use the built-in function add to mark addition etc., but instead use a variadic version. Same would apply to mul. This issue arises in a lot of places. See for instance `maxima_lib.add_vararg`. It's probably a change that would need to be made in pynac somewhere.

Other point:

```
op(*map(lambda o: o.simplify_hypergeometric(algorithm), ops))
```
is both more compactly and more efficiently expressed in python by

```
op(*(o.simplify_hypergeometric(algorithm) for o in ops))
```
Compare:

```
sage: def l(*args):
....:         return list(args)
....: 
sage: %timeit l( *[a.bit_length() for a in xrange(100)] )
100000 loops, best of 3: 10.2 µs per loop
sage: %timeit l( *(a.bit_length() for a in xrange(100)) )
100000 loops, best of 3: 12.9 µs per loop
sage: %timeit l( *map(lambda a: a.bit_length(), xrange(100)) )
10000 loops, best of 3: 17.9 µs per loop
```

Basically: don't use "map" in python unless it's considerably more convenient than the corresponding list comprehension.

No, it's all in `Expression::operator()`:

```
        import operator
        if is_a_add(self._gobj):
            return operator.add

I don't understand the comment. Do you mean "no, that line of code is not in pynac" or do you mean "no we cannot/won't make that change" or something else?

It seems to me you have just located the exact place where the change would need to be made and hence brought this ticket closer to resolution. We would then need to accommodate that change in a lot of other places too, but it probably means code can become simpler in a lot of spots.
