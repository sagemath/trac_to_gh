Something like that ?

```
sage: graphs.PetersenGraph().automorphism_group().structure_description()
'S5'
```

It is in `sage.groups.perm_gps.permgroup.PermutationGroup` (relevant ticket#15128)

To make it work on the example given on math.sx, you have to first build the associated permutation group.

```
sage: F.<x, y> = FreeGroup()
sage: G=F / [x^2*y^-1, x^3*y^2, x*y*x^-1*y^-1]
sage: G.as_permutation_group().structure_description()
'C7'
```

It should probably be exposed in `F` directly. As an alias to `.as_permutation_group().structure_description()` if we have to, but it seems that gap does not actually need to build the permutation group in order to compute that.

Hello,

The method does not look reasonable: if you ask the structure description of the free group, it will not answer. I am pretty sure that there are things to analyze structure of finitely generated groups in GAP. Moreover why 4096000 for finite groups? it is quite huge!

Hello again,

It seems that it is not necessary to turn the group into a permutation group in order to get this information from gap

```
sage: F.<x, y> = FreeGroup()
sage: G=F / [x^2*y^-1, x^3*y^2, x*y*x^-1*y^-1]
sage: G._gap_().StructureDescription()
"C7"
```

Thus there should be no problem with a limit argument or anything.

There remains some work to do in this ticket, however, for the code of `structure_description` defined in `PermutationGroup` does not only return GAP's answer: there is some string rewriting going on (as well as a latex output available), and it would be better to not copy/paste it here.

Hello again,

I thought for a while about how we could avoid some copy/pate meant to handle the GAP output, then ended up using a trick. I wrote a couple of commits which do the following:

1) Move `structure_description` from `permgroup.py` to `generic.py` without doing any modification to it

2) Update it a bit (change 'self' into 'G', add a couple of examples) then bind this function to the `permutation_group` and `finitely_presented_group` classes. And also to `Matrix_group` while I was at it.

I had to find a workaround for this `.sage()/.str()` problem you must have met yourself while you were working on this patch. This code works but there is definitely something fishy there.

Tell me what you think,

Nathann

P.S.: Those two commits can be found at: `public/17573`

Hi, Nathann!
`StructureDescription` routine seems to be very general, so I agree that it should be moved from a special object like `permutation_group` somewhere else. I found your solution in these 2 commits reasonable for the whole problem.
Yes, I have already struggled with `sage()/str()`. Maybe we should open a ticket for this? I was very surprised that such basic stuff works in different (and not obvious) ways under the same cover due to several APIs to GAP.
In conclusion, I think that this ticket may be closed -- the goal is achieved.

Hello!

> `StructureDescription` routine seems to be very general, so I agree that it should be moved from a special object like `permutation_group` somewhere else.


Indeed.

> I found your solution in these 2 commits reasonable for the whole problem.


Thanks.

> Yes, I have already struggled with `sage()/str()`. Maybe we should open a ticket for this? I was very surprised that such basic stuff works in different (and not obvious) ways under the same cover due to several APIs to GAP.


To be honest I would be glad to see it fixed, but I really did not understand where the problem came from. For some reason that I do not get, calling `str(x)` is not equivalent to `x.__str__()` on some objects `O_o`

> In conclusion, I think that this ticket may be closed -- the goal is achieved.


Well, then you can switch the ticket's status to `positive_review` and it will make it in the next release `:-)`

Yo!

> Really the SX question boils down to : why is `structure_description` not consistently available for every group, after all it makes sense for every group.


True. There are oddities in the code, however, like this `MatrixGroup_gap` class whose description reads:

`Matrix group over a ring that GAP understands`

I took it as a hint that there will never be a working `.gap()` function on all groups.

> Just monkey-patching it to yet another group  addresses one particular symptom, but does nothing against the disease.


Indeed. It only makes the method available on some classes where it was not.

> I agree with Karl-Dieter, just raise `NotImplementedError` where appropriate (e.g. there is no `gap` method).


Thus this patch should only move that function from one place to another. In which class do you think it should go?

I personally consider this bad design, and this is why I prefer to monkey-patch functions that work rather than inherit broken ones.

Will you review it if I make the change?

Everything is impossible to compute once you increase the problem size too far. FP groups are perhaps particularly tricky in that regard since there is no algorithm that necessarily terminates. But you should be allowed to ask the question.

this = consistent interfaces and specialized implementations in subclasses?

Calling non implemented or broken functions, and saying that "it is somebody else's problem"

```
It is then up to author of that particular group to override structure_description.

This change does not work: a `CyclicPermutationGroup` does not inherit from `Group`. If you wonder how that happens, just look at that and roll your eyes, just like me:

```
def is_Group(x):
    from sage.groups.old import Group as OldGroup
    return isinstance(x, (Group, OldGroup))
```

Stop being difficult and let us do something useful: I am telling you that I am willing to help you or whoever will try to rewrite this code. The only thing I cannot do is rewrite it all by myself if you start taking this ticket as a hostage.

My problem is that I do not know nor understand how the group code works. I only want to add a feature, and this is the only way I found to do it without introducing broken functions (I do not want users to call a function and end up with an exception -- to them that is nothing but a bug).
