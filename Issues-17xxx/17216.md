Because `join()` and `meet()` are defined on [meet|join]lattices, not on posets, it is logical to also move `join_matrix()` and `meet_matrix()` there.

On `hasse_diagram.py` there is for example

```
le = copy(self.lequal_matrix())
for i in range(n): le[i,i] = 1
```

This is unneeded, because `lequal_matrix()` already contains ones at diagonal. We can use `_leq_matrix` directly. There are also few other places to small optimization.

At the same time I suggesg moving `is_lattice()` to `posets.py` from category code, because `is_[meet|join]_semilattice()` already is there.

A slightly better(?) version for `_meet()` is done. Somebody could check if I did something stupid.

It seems to already have a complexity on `O(n^2.5)`. I'm not sure if it would be much faster to just check if a poset is meet-semilattice. Probably no.

Hello !

Thanks you for this branch, it is nice code.

A couple of comments and it can go:

1) The tests do not pass in the combinat/poset/ folder.

2) The code of `_join` would be simpled if you called "min(T)" instead of relabelling all points as `n-1-y`.

Has anyone checked that we do get speedups in meet/join matrix?

For the definition of a lattice, I've also been told you want a *unique* meet and join. Otherwise just the existence is something like regular poset, sorry I forget the exact term right now.

Also could you make the very minor change:

```diff
-        return matrix(ZZ, [[n-1-join[n-1-x][n-1-y] for y in range(n)] for
-                           x in range(n)])
+        return matrix(ZZ, [[n-1-join[n-1-x][n-1-y] for y in range(n)]
+                           for x in range(n)])
```
IMO it makes the code easier to read, but feel free to disregard.

If such an object exists somewhere in Sage then we should not move the function from the category file to the lattice file, for that would be a regression.

If such an object does not exist there is no reason to add a deprecation.

Bear in mind that an object that currently belongs to the category of `Lattices` and is not a `FiniteLattice` must implement its own `is_meet_semilattice` and `is_join_semilattice`.

Here is the thing: some guys in Sage rewrote method inheritance and call that "categories". A Lattice belongs to several "categories" by default:

```
sage: LatticePoset(Poset()).category()
Join of Category of finite lattice posets and Category of finite enumerated sets and Category of facade sets
```

Now, you can create any class and make it belong to the category of `Lattices`. It will consequently inherit from the methods defined in the "lattices" category file. This being said, `is_lattice` called `is_join_semilattice` and `is_meet_semilattice` which are defined in the usual `poset/lattices.py` file.

Which means that if you want the `is_lattice` method to work on an object which is not an instance of `FiniteLattice`, then it must implement its own `is_join_semilattice` and `is_meet_semilattice`.

And chances are that nobody ever did that, for removing that function from the category while re-implementing it in the poset files did not break any doctest.

Rollback done, `for` moved to other line.

Is it so that function on "real" class overrides function with same name in category? If so, then in principle there could be `meet_matrix()` defined on category --- it would loop over elements and construct a matrix. Basic implementation of lattice would only have `meet()`, but better on could have it's own and better `meet_matrix()`(?) This is basically what could be done in good old C++.

Anyways, this is now ready for review. Another thing is making documentation better. There is simply no point to make user to look different places for `is_meet_semilattice()` and `is_lattice()`.

Thanks.

How most (from my experience) people get documentation is interactively (i.e. `P.is_lattice?`), so it doesn't make a difference where the method is located.
