Because `join()` and `meet()` are defined on [meet|join]lattices, not on posets, it is logical to also move `join_matrix()` and `meet_matrix()` there.

On `hasse_diagram.py` there is for example

```
le = copy(self.lequal_matrix())
for i in range(n): le[i,i] = 1
```

This is unneeded, because `lequal_matrix()` already contains ones at diagonal. We can use `_leq_matrix` directly. There are also few other places to small optimization.

At the same time I suggesg moving `is_lattice()` to `posets.py` from category code, because `is_[meet|join]_semilattice()` already is there.

It seems to already have a complexity on `O(n^2.5)`. I'm not sure if it would be much faster to just check if a poset is meet-semilattice. Probably no.

<a id='comment:6'></a>Hello !

Thanks you for this branch, it is nice code.

A couple of comments and it can go:

1) The tests do not pass in the combinat/poset/ folder.

2) The code of `_join` would be simpled if you called "min(T)" instead of relabelling all points as `n-1-y`.

For the definition of a lattice, I've also been told you want a *unique* meet and join. Otherwise just the existence is something like regular poset, sorry I forget the exact term right now.

Also could you make the very minor change:

```diff

If such an object exists somewhere in Sage then we should not move the function from the category file to the lattice file, for that would be a regression.

If such an object does not exist there is no reason to add a deprecation.

Bear in mind that an object that currently belongs to the category of `Lattices` and is not a `FiniteLattice` must implement its own `is_meet_semilattice` and `is_join_semilattice`.

I don't quite understand --- what happens if both `finite_posets.py` on categories and `posets.py` on combinats define same function?\n\n\nHere is the thing: some guys in Sage rewrote method inheritance and call that \"categories\". A Lattice belongs to several \"categories\" by default:\n\n```\nsage: LatticePoset(Poset()).category()\nJoin of Category of finite lattice posets and Category of finite enumerated sets and Category of facade sets\n```\n\nNow, you can create any class and make it belong to the category of `Lattices`. It will consequently inherit from the methods defined in the \"lattices\" category file.

<a id='comment:16'></a>> When is `is_lattice()` on category tried to run? I don't quite understand --- what happens if both `finite_posets.py` on categories and `posets.py` on combinats define same function?


Here is the thing: some guys in Sage rewrote method inheritance and call that "categories". A Lattice belongs to several "categories" by default:

```
sage: LatticePoset(Poset()).category()
Join of Category of finite lattice posets and Category of finite enumerated sets and Category of facade sets
```

Now, you can create any class and make it belong to the category of `Lattices`. It will consequently inherit from the methods defined in the "lattices" category file. This being said, `is_lattice` called `is_join_semilattice` and `is_meet_semilattice` which are defined in the usual `poset/lattices.py` file.

Which means that if you want the `is_lattice` method to work on an object which is not an instance of `FiniteLattice`, then it must implement its own `is_join_semilattice` and `is_meet_semilattice`.

And chances are that nobody ever did that, for removing that function from the category while re-implementing it in the poset files did not break any doctest.

But Travis had also other points. It does not bother me, because this is an enhancement, not a bug (and nothing like changing `O(2^n)` to `O(n^2)` or similar).

I don't quite get this category thing. For example there is no category for semilattices, but there is for lattices if I remember correctly. But anyways, I'll put a deprecation to categories code.

How most (from my experience) people get documentation is interactively (i.e. `P.is_lattice?`), so it doesn't make a difference where the method is located.
