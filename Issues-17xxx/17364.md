```
All homset categories should be subcategories of the category of all homsets. For example, we want:

```
sage: from sage.categories.homsets import Homsets
sage: Schemes().Homsets().is_subcategory(Homsets())
True
sage: AdditiveMagmas().Homsets().is_subcategory(Homsets())
True
sage: AdditiveMagmas().AdditiveUnital().Homsets().is_subcategory(Homsets())
True
```

The inheritance of a homset category `C.Homsets()` from `Homsets()` used to be implemented in `HomsetsCategory.extra_super_categories`; this meant that any custom implementation of `C.Homsets.extra_super_categories` would overwrite it, which broke all the above examples.

This ticket fixes this, and uses the occasion to refactor the logic, getting rid along the way of the custom `category_of` method which almost duplicated that of functorial constructions. Hopefully the logic and its documentation are clearer now.

I am not sure that this ticket solves all difficulties with determining the supercategories of Hom set categories.  For example (both before and after this ticket):

```
sage: HeckeModules(ZZ).is_subcategory(Modules(ZZ))
True
sage: Modules(ZZ).Homsets().all_super_categories()
[Category of homsets of modules over Integer Ring,
 Category of modules over Integer Ring,
 Category of bimodules over Integer Ring on the left and Integer Ring on the right,
 Category of right modules over Integer Ring,
 Category of left modules over Integer Ring,
 Category of commutative additive groups,
 Category of additive groups,
 Category of additive inverse additive unital additive magmas,
 Category of commutative additive monoids,
 Category of additive monoids,
 Category of additive unital additive magmas,
 Category of commutative additive semigroups,
 Category of additive commutative additive magmas,
 Category of additive semigroups,
 Category of additive magmas,
 Category of homsets of right modules over Integer Ring and left modules over Integer Ring,
 Category of homsets,
 Category of sets,
 Category of sets with partial maps,
 Category of objects]
sage: HeckeModules(ZZ).Homsets().all_super_categories()
[Category of homsets of Hecke modules over Integer Ring,

```
Note that the fact that Hom sets of modules are Abelian groups is not reflected in the output of the last command.

Thanks for checking whether everything is correct.

This is not about the infrastructure (which is the theme of this
ticket), but about what Sage knows about Hecke modules (which is what
the TODO I left is about):

- If the category Hecke modules is a full subcategory of the category
  of modules, Sage should be told about this by implementing
  `HeckeModules.additional_structure` to return `None`.

- Otherwise, one needs to state explicitly that
  `HeckeModules(ZZ).Homsets()` is a subcategory of `AbelianGroups()`
  (or whatever appropriate) in
  `HeckeModules.Homsets.extra_super_categories`.

Cheers,
                       Nicolas
