All homset categories should be subcategories of the category of all homsets. For example, we want:

```
sage: from sage.categories.homsets import Homsets
sage: Schemes().Homsets().is_subcategory(Homsets())
True
sage: AdditiveMagmas().Homsets().is_subcategory(Homsets())
True
sage: AdditiveMagmas().AdditiveUnital().Homsets().is_subcategory(Homsets())
True
```

The inheritance of a homset category `C.Homsets()` from `Homsets()` used to be implemented in `HomsetsCategory.extra_super_categories`; this meant that any custom implementation of `C.Homsets.extra_super_categories` would overwrite it, which broke all the above examples.

This ticket fixes this, and uses the occasion to refactor the logic, getting rid along the way of the custom `category_of` method which almost duplicated that of functorial constructions. Hopefully the logic and its documentation are clearer now.

Thanks for checking whether everything is correct.

This is not about the infrastructure (which is the theme of this
ticket), but about what Sage knows about Hecke modules (which is what
the TODO I left is about):

- If the category Hecke modules is a full subcategory of the category
  of modules, Sage should be told about this by implementing
  `HeckeModules.additional_structure` to return `None`.

- Otherwise, one needs to state explicitly that
  `HeckeModules(ZZ).Homsets()` is a subcategory of `AbelianGroups()`
  (or whatever appropriate) in
  `HeckeModules.Homsets.extra_super_categories`.

Cheers,
                       Nicolas
