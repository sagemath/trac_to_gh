Thanks for the ping - I had just opened a ticket because Volker suggested it.  But it turned out to be a Macports type problem.

So we can close this.

But at least this confirms we really do still want to disallow fink and Macports during the build!  Is that check still in the initial script?

There is indeed a check: it checks that `which port` and `which fink` do not return existing files.
