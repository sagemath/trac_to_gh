# Issue 17319: Add a powers() method to monoid elements

The purpose of this ticket is to add a `powers()` method to `MonoidElement` and `RingElement` such that `x.powers(n)` returns `[x^0, x^1, ..., x^(n-1)]`.  This only needs *n* - 1 multiplications and hence is more efficient than calling `[x^i for i in xrange(n)]`. Examples:

```
sage: G = SymmetricGroup(4)
sage: g = G([2,3,4,1])
sage: g.powers(4)
[(), (1,2,3,4), (1,3)(2,4), (1,4,3,2)]
sage: 5.powers(3)
[1, 5, 25]
```
Inspired by the `powers()` function that was recently added to PARI.

The method needs to be added twice because `RingElement` does not inherit from `MonoidElement`.  I tried the alternative of adding it to `Monoids.ElementMethods`, but this is much slower.

I'm going to be (extremely) paranoid and ask to rewrite `x *= self` as `x = x * self` in case something happens to get done in place. Otherwise LGTM.

Edit - Actually could you also add it to `Monoids.ElementMethods` for monoids whose elements don't inherit from `MonoidElement`?
