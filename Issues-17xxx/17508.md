The page of the developer's manual that explains how the doc of a function should be written is a very important one. It can be obtained at this address:

http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/coding_basics.html#documentation-strings

Right now, however, it is a bit hard to read for the text is a bit "flat": it is a long enumeration of blocks, and it is hard to find the one we can be looking for.

At first I only wanted to rewrite in bold the name of each block, i.e. note, warning, examples, ...

I ended up rephrasing several paragraphs in order to make them more direct (lots of information there, let us be concise). I also removed several comments saying "a .. NOTE:: block should begin with ".. NOTE::" as they were followed by an example. Or sentences like "patches will not be accepted unless they contain a X block" given that we already say at the beginning if a block is optional of not.

I hope that it will be easier to read this way.

I like this very much, in general.  

Minor comments.
* 'expected output' is better than only 'returns', because some functions return `None` but still have output (printing, showing a graphic, whatever).
* It would be amusing to use the seealso directive to point to the hyperlinks reference.  But perhaps too self-referential :)
* Probably the comment in the note should still say something (less verbose is fine) about using spaces, not tabs; the current text could be misleading to someone who would then get roughed up on Trac for it.
* instead of "it contains the tests" use "containing tests"
* For some reason the tests info is immediately after the references info, while seealso has a nice space after examples.  Maybe a missing line?  (I'm reviewing this before looking at the patch.)
* I did not know about the `..automethod` and plan to use it in the future!
* 'Note the indentation' should have a period, probably, since the double colon likely disappears or something; it looks awkward (even in the current doc) without it.

Edit after looking at code:
* I would make

```
Template
--------
```
  be at the next lower level of header, I'm not sure whether there are any such in the file - maybe use `<sup>^</sup>^` for that?
* Similarly, I'd add another subsubheader before the info about private functions, as that is not about the template.  Maybe

```
Private Functions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
```
  or something like that.

Anyway, as I said, this is a nice improvement, thank you!

Helloo ! Thanks for the review.

I made the modifications you asked but right now it is only "on my computer". I can't seem to access internet without proxy these days, and that means no ssh connections --> cannot use git. I hope that I will find a way tomorrow `:-/`

> * 'expected output' is better than only 'returns', because some functions return `None` but still have output (printing, showing a graphic, whatever).

Done

> * It would be amusing to use the seealso directive to point to the hyperlinks reference.  But perhaps too self-referential :)

I thought of illustrating "warnings" with a warning, "notes" with a note, then decided against it as the big colored blocks it produced were "stealing the attention".

> * Probably the comment in the note should still say something (less verbose is fine) about using spaces, not tabs; the current text could be misleading to someone who would then get roughed up on Trac for it.

I added some words about that.

> * instead of "it contains the tests" use "containing tests"

Done.

> * For some reason the tests info is immediately after the references info, while seealso has a nice space after examples.  Maybe a missing line?  (I'm reviewing this before looking at the patch.)

No, just Sphinx not liking to have a new entry "A **TESTS** block [...]" right after the end of an enumeration. I turned it into normal text, it is not that bad either.

> * I did not know about the `..automethod` and plan to use it in the future!

Yep, it's a cool thing.

> * 'Note the indentation' should have a period, probably, since the double colon likely disappears or something; it looks awkward (even in the current doc) without it.

Done

> Edit after looking at code:
> * I would make
> 
> ```

Done, looks good.

> * Similarly, I'd add another subsubheader before the info about private functions

Done.

The git branch will be updated as soon as I can get a real connection somewhere `T_T`
