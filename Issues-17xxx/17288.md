Currenlty, `MathJax` is bundled with sagenb. But ipython notebook also requires `MathJax` for offline displaying mathematical formulas.

The aim of this ticket is to:
- have an independent `MathJax` spkg, not related to sagenb
- make it small
- have ipython notebook depend on it and work with that local install
- update to mathjax 2.5

The use of that package for sagenb is postponed to #17306.

I am not involved in the development of sagenb, so it's really up to you.

I just gave a try, simply removing the mathjax directory in `local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sagenb-*.egg/sagenb/data` and replacing it with a symlink  to `../../../../../../share/mathjax` seems to work well.

So, if you still want to ship mathjax within sagenb source code, a possibility is to add the previous "remove+symlink" at the end of the `build/pkgs/sagenb/spkg-install` script, so the only problem will be about downloading mathjax twice. Another possibility is to officially ship two sagenb tarballs, one with mathjax, one without.

In the last commit i showed how could sagenb work with mathjax spkg. It should work both with or without modifiction of sagenb spkg. Since each commit does a specific thing, we can decide whether  sagenb should use mathjax spkg or not.

- commit ‚Äãe8ef55d : basic independent mathjax spkg
- commit ‚Äã8f18d36 : strip mathjax down from 175M to <10M.
- commit ‚Äã0443d99 : make mathjax a standard spkg and a dependency of (and work with) ipython
- commit ‚Äã8ec7d5c : make mathjax a dependency of (and work with) sagenb

Note that

```

```
rm -rf mathjax

Indeed, most non-developpers i met use binary tarballs, live USB or PPA (actually those who build Sage from source do this because there is no binary for their distro/version/architecture).

Also, note that the mathjax tarball weights 22M while the uncompressed/untared directory weights 175M (of course a tarball obtained from the 10M trimmed directory would be very small).

As for mathjax package, i will see if upstream can ship "generic" trimmed versions.

Side comment: even in that case, the commands

```
if [ -d mathjax ] ; then
    rm -rf mathjax
fi
```
and

```
rm -rf mathjax
```
are equivalent: both delete just the symlink.

So SVG fonts are removed??? They were a great alternative when there were any issues with HTML! Plus, there is still an option to use SVG as a renderer in the menu and after picking it and refreshing the page all formulas are gone and it is not clear how to go back!

If tarball is 22MB what's the necessity to strip anything but development files at all? PNG fonts are there for a reason too - some users/browsers have issues with others. For the moment one of the "other browsers" seems to be Firefox 38 on our campus computers - things are ugly in SageNB and in SageMathCell I only see math processing error message.

MathJax is an essential component of Sage, so if contributes to 5% of its tarball and unpacked size I don't see it as a problem at all...

tarball size is not the only problem. sage also has one patch to avoid extra problem from this. 

But as a starting point to conversation you have to know that by default if left alone these `.png` fonts will be copied in each subfolder of the html sage documentation. One data point I have from https://github.com/cschwan/sage-on-gentoo/issues/344 is that for two languages (english and french) the size of the html doc comes to 1.7GB in sage-on-gentoo before I did something about the duplications of fonts everywhere. After that it comes to 274MB. Check your vanilla sage install and you will find out that with all the language enabled you are under that figure.
