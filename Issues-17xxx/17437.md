An integer array is a higher-dimensional analog of an integer matrix.

We implement element and parent classes for integer arrays along with enumerators.

Formally, a  integer array is an array of non-negative integers. Given an index !`i` and a value !`v` the slice sum for !`i=v` is the sum over all entries with !`i`th coordinate equal to !`v`. The enumerator enumerates over all such integer arrays.

The motivation behind this ticket is the exploration of higher-dimensional analogs of the RSK correspondence, which could lead to insights about Kronecker coefficients.

Hey Amri!  Can you describe what exactly this is and why we need it?  What I mean is what situation this is helpful for.

I'm surprised there isn't something 'built-in'.  Is there something like this with floats or RDFs in e.g. Numpy?  Also, I feel like this should be much more general - maybe a class of such things or something.  Not to mention categories ;-) though I won't tell you aren't using them if you don't.

+1.

You could still do all the combinatorial stuff using `numpy` arrays (or something else) under the hood.

I think there are too many of these "reinvent-the-wheel" classes in Sage (You mention `IntegerMatrix`, which is probably a good example).

I was thinking this module would be lazily imported. However as soon as you want to construct an element of the parent, it would trigger the numpy import, and I'm wondering if you think it is worth the (relatively) large import and using a large complicated (at least I imagine it is) class for ~20 lines of code?

Yes, the `numpy` import is worth it.

First of all, you mention "20 lines of code", but that's the current code. Probably somebody will eventually want to enlarge the functionality or will want to speed up the code, possibly duplicating more and more stuff that's already done.

Second, importing `numpy` isn't that bad. Importing `numpy` is still faster than importing all of Sage in the first place.
