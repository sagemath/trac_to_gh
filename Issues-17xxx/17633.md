Many doctests fail on cygwin64 only because of numerical noise. For instance, `RDF(e)` yields `2.718281828459045` on linux, but `2.7182818284590455` on cygwin.

This patch adds numerical tolerance to the failing doctests, to let them pass.

Hi Sébastien,

From the diff two files disappeared: `src/sage/functions/exp_integral.py` and `src/sage/functions/hyperbolic.py`. Is that normal?

Replying to [vdelecroix](#comment%3A7):

No, it is definitely not normal. I am confused since none of the commits in the branch deletes those files. Any idea of what I might have done wrong, or is it trac diff that gets something wrong?

In any case, I can prepare a new clean branch in a few days.
