Also note it says IE is "unworkably slow" with the jsmol option, though I don't know how authoritative this is.

At the very least, maybe we need a little documentation for this somewhere, in addition to setting this.  I don't think we want to get in the business of checking whether a plot has transparency and then sending a message to Jmol...

Maybe this needs some really obvious documentation to "use java for big plots" in the plot3d documentation, maybe even in the "Help" link that one clicks for the notebook.  I don't want to go back to Sage 3d graphics being unusable on many browsers.  And this was truly a one-character change.

Personally I find it extremely annoying that transparency changes when I click on a plot, since it is not just hiding some parts, it is greatly changing/flashing the whole thing.

On a more objective note - the point of transparency is to be able to see things which are hidden otherwise to get a better sense of the plot. And the point of spinning the plot around is the same. With this new setting you can only benefit from one or the other but not both.

Regarding speed issues - can we get some examples of Sage plots which we should "test"? Just getting things slow with many points is a bit pointless - for what plots it is really necessary to increase the number of points?

Yes.  Well, changing the platform speed will be the way to go, then.  Can you take care of the sagenb package for this iteration?

No no, I always use something like

```
var('y')
plot3d(sin(x^2+y^2),(x,0,10),(y,0,10))
```
where an increased number of points makes a *very* noticeable difference.

Playing some more, platformspeed 6 is the first one which shows the plot at all during rotation, 7 includes transparency, and 8 includes antialiasing as well. Which is greatly affecting shape and size of "thick curves" and "fat points". In fact, with 8 I can see no differences while rotating and while not rotating and I think this should be the default (it certainly was the default before). I don't know what is changing between 8 and 10.

With 200 points your sin plot works OK for me and while on 6 it may be faster, it is not at all the difference between OK and unusable. This is on a fast desktop (4GHz cores) and I'll try to test on a slower machine as well, however I am for default of 8 regardless of outcomes.

As for packaging the next version - I am hesitant to commit since I tend to lag behind...

I'm pretty sure I picked 6 because that was the only thing that worked OK on tablets.  Unfortunately, I do not have a test server set up with 6.4.rc1 on which to retest this.  Here's a way we can all do device checking and report back.  I have some web pages set up that have complex enough things that we should be able to tell.
1. go to [hybrid orbitals](http://www.uwosh.edu/faculty_staff/gutow/Orbitals/N/sp3%20hybrid.shtml)
2. select a different orbital in each popup
3. set two of them to transparent
4. set another to mesh
5. use the right-click menu to bring up the console
6. test "set platformspeed = X", where X = 6  through 8.
7. report back with device details.

(may not work on all touch devices as I have had trouble getting the equivalent of a right-click)

My first report:
i3 portable that tops out at 1.8 GHZ (usually runs at 800 MHz) 8 or higher is fine on. Tested in Firefox and Chromium on Ubuntu 14.04.

Andrey and Jonathan, we can either fix this *fast* or dither about choices and not get it in.  I think 7 is a good compromise but I don't think we are going to have the energy to put in some extra javascript, or at least I won't.

Volker, you wrote the Android app - how does it deal with 3d images?  (I don't have iOS or Android so I can't test this, and the current Google Play page doesn't have an example pictured.)  If the apps using cell server aren't doing 3d graphics anyway, then I wouldn't worry about it, it's relatively less frequent that people are doing intense graphics on such platforms, I imagine, since sagenb isn't optimized for mobile devices (at all).

Incidentally, the recent reviews at [the Android app site](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.sagemath.droid&hl=en) are fairly negative - that's sad, because from everything I heard it was actually pretty awesome.  I don't think sagecell has been having problems - or has it?

> Also, jsmol knows how long it takes to render each frame, right? It should just dynamically adjust the rendering quality to achieve >=30fps

Jonathan can report that upstream...

Okay, confirmed and done at [this commit](https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb/commit/f5eef910f7791ed80a0538193dc2ba00c84d0c09).

Now we just need a new sagenb release, probably waiting on https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb/issues/256 to be fixed.

On the branch of the ticket:

```
$ sage -i http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/kcrisman/sagenb-0.11.1.tar
...
Finished extraction
/home/novoselt/sage/src/bin/sage-spkg: line 598: cd: sagenb-0.11.1.tar: No such file or directory
Error: after extracting, the directory sagenb-0.11.1.tar does not exist
```

Am I doing something wrong?
