Also note it says IE is "unworkably slow" with the jsmol option, though I don't know how authoritative this is.

At the very least, maybe we need a little documentation for this somewhere, in addition to setting this.  I don't think we want to get in the business of checking whether a plot has transparency and then sending a message to Jmol...

On a more objective note - the point of transparency is to be able to see things which are hidden otherwise to get a better sense of the plot. And the point of spinning the plot around is the same. With this new setting you can only benefit from one or the other but not both.

Regarding speed issues - can we get some examples of Sage plots which we should "test"? Just getting things slow with many points is a bit pointless - for what plots it is really necessary to increase the number of points?

Yes.  Well, changing the platform speed will be the way to go, then.  Can you take care of the sagenb package for this iteration?
> Regarding speed issues - can we get some examples of Sage plots which we should "test"? Just getting things slow with many points is a bit pointless - for what plots it is really necessary to increase the number of points?

No no, I always use something like

```
var('y')
plot3d(sin(x^2+y^2),(x,0,10),(y,0,10))
```
where an increased number of points makes a *very* noticeable difference.

Playing some more, platformspeed 6 is the first one which shows the plot at all during rotation, 7 includes transparency, and 8 includes antialiasing as well.

I'm pretty sure I picked 6 because that was the only thing that worked OK on tablets.  Unfortunately, I do not have a test server set up with 6.4.rc1 on which to retest this.  Here's a way we can all do device checking and report back.  I have some web pages set up that have complex enough things that we should be able to tell.
1. go to [hybrid orbitals](http://www.uwosh.edu/faculty_staff/gutow/Orbitals/N/sp3%20hybrid.shtml)
2. select a different orbital in each popup
3. set two of them to transparent
4. set another to mesh
5. use the right-click menu to bring up the console
6. test "set platformspeed = X", where X = 6  through 8.
7. report back with device details.

(may not work on all touch devices as I have had trouble getting the equivalent of a right-click)

My first report:
i3 portable that tops out at 1.8 GHZ (usually runs at 800 MHz) 8 or higher is fine on. Tested in Firefox and Chromium on Ubuntu 14.04.

Thanks for the test, Jonathan!

On my over **TEN YEARS OLD** laptop with Athlon 64 1.8GHz (and GeForce MX440 Go videocard) it works just fine with 8. On the other hand, three.js on this machine is completely unusable since WebGL is not supported and canvas is incredibly slow (many seconds to render a frame).

While supporting old mobile devices is noble, I think that complicated 3D plots with a lot of points are more likely to be viewed on computers with adequate resources.

Note also that the current situation (for a year) is that rotatable 3D plots are not working at all on all devices. With 8 we will get a great renderer for desktops/laptops and perhaps more recent tablets as well. And while with 7 situation is satisfactory as well, I still would prefer not to compromise - spinning manually or automatically is the most natural way to look at 3D plots and the higher quality we can achieve the better.

Once I realized that it was only for rotation, I was thinking of downgrading to critical, but Andrey's point was actually fairly compelling.

Andrey and Jonathan, we can either fix this *fast* or dither about choices and not get it in.  I think 7 is a good compromise but I don't think we are going to have the energy to put in some extra javascript, or at least I won't.

Volker, you wrote the Android app - how does it deal with 3d images?  (I don't have iOS or Android so I can't test this, and the current Google Play page doesn't have an example pictured.)  If the apps using cell server aren't doing 3d graphics anyway, then I wouldn't worry about it, it's relatively less frequent that people are doing intense graphics on such platforms, I imagine, since sagenb isn't optimized for mobile devices (at all).

Incidentally, the recent reviews at [the Android app site](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.sagemath.droid&hl=en) are fairly negative - that's sad, because from everything I heard it was actually pretty awesome.  I don't think sagecell has been having problems - or has it?

Jonathan can report that upstream...
