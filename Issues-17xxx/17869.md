Let E be an elliptic curve over Q. For certain primes p, the function prove_BSD will make reference to the paper of Stein et al on the numerical verification of BSD. Unfortunately, the Theorem 5.3 in there is incorrect. The condition that the H 1 vanishes is computed wrong in their Lemma 5.4. 

As a consequence, sage sometimes claims that we know how to prove BSD when the verification is in fact much harder and rules out some cases when we would know it.

The patch here replaces the condition with a new condition, based on a paper I have written with Taylor Lawson: http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.02940 .

A few questions/comments:
- Could you add a reference to your preprint to the documentation?
- It would probably be faster to do the check for irreducible representations after the checks for the cases `p > 11 or p == 7` and `p == 1`.
- It seems to me that the code

 ```
 phis = [phi for phi in flatten(BSD.curve.isogeny_class().isogenies())
             if phi != 0 and
             phi.degree() == p and
             phi.domain().is_isomorphic(BSD.curve) ]
  ```
  can be simplified to

 ```
 phis = BSD.curve.isogenies_prime_degree(p) 
  ```
  Would this be OK?
- A typographical question: are the spaces around the dash in "Lawson - Wuthrich" intentional?  It is fine with me either way, but there is already "Stein-Wuthrich" without the spaces.

Actually, I am now wondering whether the check for irreducible representations is necessary at all; the other tests seem to suffice to set `crit_lw = True` whenever the representation is irreducible.

Looking at Theorem 1 in the preprint, it seems that the checks in the cases *p* = 3 and *p* = 5 are stricter than necessary.  For example, let *E* be the (Γ<sub>0</sub>(*N*)-optimal) elliptic curve with Cremona label 198b1 (LMFDB label 198.e3).  Then *E* admits a 3-isogeny with kernel *μ*<sub>3</sub> and no other 3-isogenies.  Theorem 1 implies that the H<sup>1</sup> is trivial, but the code as implemented in this ticket does not detect this since it keeps `crit_lw = False` unless the 3-isogenous curve does not have any points of order 3 either.  Does this mean that the criterion in the code can be relaxed?
