Add abelian_vectors and abelian_complexity method to finite words

Following the comment made by Jacques Sakarovitch during Journées montoises 2014 in Nancy, we deprecate the `parikh_vector` method:

```
parikh_vector = deprecated_function_alias(17058, abelian_vector)
```

Moreover, we deprecate the argument `alphabet` for the method `abelian_vector` method because it was a bad design choice to allow to specify the alphabet in such a method. User should specify the alphabet in the parent.

<a id='comment:4'></a>Hello,

It is weird to call a method `alphabet` on the word which is not the alphabet of the parent. Moreover, there is already the method `letters` which does the job. So please use `letters` if you need it.

Now about your design choice, if the alphabet of the parent is {a,b,c} and my word is abbab then the abelianization must be a vector of length 3. With your branch:

```
sage: W = Words([0,1,2])
sage: w = W([0,1,1,0,1,2,0,2,0,2])
sage: w.abelian_vectors(3)
{(1, 0, 2), (1, 1, 1), (1, 2, 0), (2, 0, 1)}
sage: w[:5].abelian_vectors(3)  # word on 0,1
{(1, 2)}
sage: w[5:].abelian_vectors(3)  # word on 0,2
{(1, 2), (2, 1)}
```
which is completely crazy!

For the algorithm, it would be faster to deal only with integers because

```
sage: tuple(my_list)
```
is much faster than

```
sage: tuple(my_dict[a] for a in alphabet)
```
i.e. I would initialize `abelian` as a list of length the cardinality of the alphabet and then

```
    abelian[rank[start.next()]] += 1
    abelian[rank[stop.next()]]  -= 1
    S.add(tuple(abelian))
```
where `rank` would be a dictionnary `letter -> index`.

Cheers
Vincent

<a id='comment:10'></a>Hi,

I got

```
sage: w = Word([0,1,0])
sage: w.abelian_complexity(5)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
StopIteration: 
```
where I would expect a `0`.

stupid coercion is around

```
sage: timeit("1 < Infinity")
625 loops, best of 3: 12.6 µs per loop
sage: timeit("1 < float('inf')")
625 loops, best of 3: 803 ns per loop
```
but I guess it is not critical here.

What do you think of

```
sage: from itertools import count
sage: w = Word(count(), alphabet=NN)
sage: w[:2].abelian_vectors(2)
{(1, 1)}
sage: w[:3].abelian_vectors(2)
{(0, 1, 1), (1, 1, 0)}
sage: w[:4].abelian_vectors(2)
{(0, 0, 1, 1), (0, 1, 1, 0), (1, 1, 0, 0)}
```
I think this is very bad. I would rather raise an Error when the alphabet is infinite (in the very same way `abelian_vector` does, by the way). But at least `.abelian_complexity()` gets right.

Are you sure that the ``@`cached_method` is needed on `.letters()`? It seems used only when the alphabet is infinite... in which case the user is doing something wrong.

The convention for the header of methods is "Return bla" instead of "Returns bla". See [developer guide](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/coding_basics.html#docstring-markup-with-rest-and-sphinx) about the header:

```
A one-sentence description of the function, followed by a blank line and
ending in a period. It prescribes the function or method’s effect as a
command (“Do this”, “Return that”), not as a description; e.g. don’t
write “Returns the pathname ...”.
```

Be careful, you introduced several trailing whitespaces.

There are a lot of methods of `FiniteWord_class` that do not need the existence of a parent alphabet. That was one of the first clean up that we did back in 2009: get rid of things that were not necesary.

But then, there are also a lot of methods of `FiniteWord_class` that *needs* an alphabet. At that time, we choose to allow the user to use such methods without having previously defined an alphabet. But, I think we were wrong. If a method needs an alphabet to work reasonably, we should just raise an error if there were no alphabet assigned to the parent. This is in accordance to the way I fixed the `abelian_vector` method and added a deprecation to the alphabet input.

None of the section of the docstring is mandatory except `EXAMPLES` or `TESTS`. In particular a function whose header is `Return the number of factors of length n` does not need an `INPUT` nor an `OUTPUT` section. The docstring are only used for documentation (and doctesting): the simplest the best!

<a id='comment:19'></a>Hello,

A last commit for optimization, including a much faster implementation of `.letters()` in `WordDatatype_char`. If you like it, you can then set to positive review.
