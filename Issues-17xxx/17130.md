This uses coercion correctly:

```
sage: bessel_Y._eval_(RealField(300)(1), 1.0)
-0.781212821300289
```

However, it seems that `__call__()` coerces this result back to the first parent, giving false precision:

```
sage: bessel_Y(RealField(300)(1), 1.0)
-0.781212821300288684511770043172873556613922119140625000000000000000000000000000000000000000
```

Same issue with functions which are evaluated using Maxima, which does not support arbitrary precision:

```
sage: R=RealField(300); elliptic_eu(R(1/2), R(1/8))
0.495073732023201484864216581627260893583297729492187500000000000000000000000000000000000000
```

The `gamma_inc()` function also mishandles parents:

```
sage: gamma_inc(float(0), float(1))
AttributeError: type object 'float' has no attribute 'precision'
```

---

Apart from this, this branch also removes lots of boilerplate from `_eval_` like

```
if not isinstance(x, Expression) and not isinstance(y, Expression) and \
        (is_inexact(x) or is_inexact(y)):
    x, y = coercion_model.canonical_coercion(x, y)
    return self._evalf_(x, y, s_parent(x))
```
by wrapping `_eval_` inside the new method `_evalf_or_eval_` which automatically does this boilerplate.

Just to clarify, you mean that the precision of the less precise input (`1.0`) is used, but then for some reason this is sent back to the precision of the first one? 

My guess is that [this line](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/blob/develop/src/sage/symbolic/function.pyx#n919) is to blame. 

```
        # we want to convert the result to the original parent if the input
        # is not exact, so we store the parent here
        org_parent = parent_c(args[0])
```
I don't have time right now to check this out, but I would not be at all surprised.

Yes, the less-precise result is converted to the more-precise parent.

Especially the `args[0]` is very suspicious indeed.

work properly with this patch? Again, I'm sorry I don't have time to do more than read code for five minutes at this point :(

Edit: I see your most recent comment - yes, that would certainly be helpful, though I have a feeling a LOT of functions would have to be fixed... because some probably implicitly rely on this block but aren't thoroughly tested for unusual input/output.

Edit by jdemeyer: Sorry, edit instead of reply

Perhaps one could take the coercion mutual parents of all args instead for a minimal change?  (Would that work?)  I think in principle it's better to handle this all at once rather than having things in each individual function - if possible, of course.

This works as it should, many doctest failures involve Python types:

```
sage: arctan(float(1))
1/4*pi
```
(I guess this goes through Pynac)

That still wouldn't fix the case where the function is computed to less precision than the inputs.

I think the following would fix most issues:
- before calling the function, convert all Python types to the corresponding Sage types (`float` -> `RDF` and so on)
- after calling the function, convert back if needed

I don't think it is overly long, nor is there a good way of splitting it up. Patch looks good to me.

Its somewhat confusing that `is_numerical` is completely different from `GiNaC::numeric`. How about `is_approximate`, `is_limited_precision`, or `is_floating_point` (I'd be happy to call padics "floating point" in this case). 

Is it possible to replace `is_inexact` with `is_numerical` everywhere? The difference is

```
sage: is_inexact(pi)
True
sage: sin._is_numerical(pi)
False
```
I'm not super happy with pi being "inexact", though perhaps there is a technical reason for why we need it.

* Deprecation, folks.  
* No, it isn't long, but I at least need to think about the mechanism by which things are evaluated and want to make sure we don't miss any odd cases.  `_eval_` has been fairly standard for quite some time.
* I agree that the naming is problematic no matter what name you choose.  I think the rings folks had some good reasons for their choices:

```
    cpdef bint is_exact(self) except -2:
        """
        Test whether the ring is exact.

        .. NOTE::

            This defaults to true, so even if it does return ``True``
            you have no guarantee (unless the ring has properly
            overloaded this).

        OUTPUT:

        Return True if elements of this ring are represented exactly, i.e.,
        there is no precision loss when doing arithmetic.

        EXAMPLES::

            sage: QQ.is_exact()
            True
            sage: ZZ.is_exact()
            True
            sage: Qp(7).is_exact()
            False
            sage: Zp(7, type='capped-abs').is_exact()
            False
        """
        return True
```
  but the symbolic ring might have inexact stuff in it, so 

```

Definition:     SR.is_exact(self)
Source:
    cpdef bint is_exact(self) except -2:
        """
        Return False, because there are approximate elements in the
        symbolic ring.

        EXAMPLES::

            sage: SR.is_exact()
            False

        Here is an inexact element.

        ::

            sage: SR(1.9393)
            1.93930000000000
        """
        return False
```
  does that make sense?

I like none of those 3 alternatives, as there are valid cases for exact integers being "numerical": this isn't yet implemented on this ticket, but for number theoretical functions (`binomial`, `factorial`) it absolutely makes sense to consider integers "numerical". So the name should not obviously exclude integers.

In fact, this was one of the reasons to make `_is_numerical` a method of the function and not a global function (possible support of `p`-adics is indeed another reason).

No, this is only about `BuiltinFunction`s, there are no functional changes to user-defined functions.
