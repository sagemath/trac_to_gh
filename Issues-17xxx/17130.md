This uses coercion correctly:

```
sage: bessel_Y._eval_(RealField(300)(1), 1.0)
-0.781212821300289
```

However, it seems that `__call__()` coerces this result back to the first parent, giving false precision:

```
sage: bessel_Y(RealField(300)(1), 1.0)
-0.781212821300288684511770043172873556613922119140625000000000000000000000000000000000000000
```

Same issue with functions which are evaluated using Maxima, which does not support arbitrary precision:

```
sage: R=RealField(300); elliptic_eu(R(1/2), R(1/8))
0.495073732023201484864216581627260893583297729492187500000000000000000000000000000000000000
```

The `gamma_inc()` function also mishandles parents:

```
sage: gamma_inc(float(0), float(1))
AttributeError: type object 'float' has no attribute 'precision'
```

---

Apart from this, this branch also removes lots of boilerplate from `_eval_` like

```
if not isinstance(x, Expression) and not isinstance(y, Expression) and \
        (is_inexact(x) or is_inexact(y)):
    x, y = coercion_model.canonical_coercion(x, y)
    return self._evalf_(x, y, s_parent(x))
```
by wrapping `_eval_` inside the new method `_evalf_or_eval_` which automatically does this boilerplate.

Just to clarify, you mean that the precision of the less precise input (`1.0`) is used, but then for some reason this is sent back to the precision of the first one? 

My guess is that [this line](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/blob/master/src/sage/symbolic/function.pyx#n919) is to blame. 

```
        # we want to convert the result to the original parent if the input
        # is not exact, so we store the parent here
        org_parent = parent_c(args[0])
```

Yes, the less-precise result is converted to the more-precise parent.

This works as it should, many doctest failures involve Python types:

```
sage: arctan(float(1))
1/4*pi
```
(I guess this goes through Pynac)

That still wouldn't fix the case where the function is computed to less precision than the inputs.

I think the following would fix most issues:
- before calling the function, convert all Python types to the corresponding Sage types (`float` -> `RDF` and so on)
- after calling the function, convert back if needed

Not all arguments need to be floating point types, there could be integer or string parameters. So you can't indiscriminately coerce.

IMHO we should just add a clause that if output is float and of lower precision then use that lower precision. In an ideal world we would be able to evaluate everything to arbitrary precision, of course.

I don't think it is overly long, nor is there a good way of splitting it up. Patch looks good to me.

Its somewhat confusing that `is_numerical` is completely different from `GiNaC::numeric`. How about `is_approximate`, `is_limited_precision`, or `is_floating_point` (I'd be happy to call padics "floating point" in this case). 

Is it possible to replace `is_inexact` with `is_numerical` everywhere? The difference is

```
sage: is_inexact(pi)
True
sage: sin._is_numerical(pi)
False
```
I'm not super happy with pi being "inexact", though perhaps there is a technical reason for why we need it.

* Deprecation, folks.  
* No, it isn't long, but I at least need to think about the mechanism by which things are evaluated and want to make sure we don't miss any odd cases.  `_eval_` has been fairly standard for quite some time.
* I agree that the naming is problematic no matter what name you choose.  I think the rings folks had some good reasons for their choices:

```
    cpdef bint is_exact(self) except -2:
        """
        Test whether the ring is exact.

        .. NOTE::

            This defaults to true, so even if it does return ``True``
            you have no guarantee (unless the ring has properly
            overloaded this).

        OUTPUT:

        Return True if elements of this ring are represented exactly, i.e.,
        there is no precision loss when doing arithmetic.

        EXAMPLES::

            sage: QQ.is_exact()
            True
            sage: ZZ.is_exact()
            True
            sage: Qp(7).is_exact()
            False
            sage: Zp(7, type='capped-abs').is_exact()
            False
        """
        return True
```
  but the symbolic ring might have inexact stuff in it, so 

```

Definition:     SR.is_exact(self)
Source:
    cpdef bint is_exact(self) except -2:
        """
        Return False, because there are approximate elements in the
        symbolic ring.

        EXAMPLES::

            sage: SR.is_exact()
            False

        Here is an inexact element.

        ::

            sage: SR(1.9393)
            1.93930000000000
        """
        return False
```
  does that make sense?

I just meant if one changed the name completely, that's all.

I like none of those 3 alternatives, as there are valid cases for exact integers being "numerical": this isn't yet implemented on this ticket, but for number theoretical functions (`binomial`, `factorial`) it absolutely makes sense to consider integers "numerical". So the name should not obviously exclude integers.

In fact, this was one of the reasons to make `_is_numerical` a method of the function and not a global function (possible support of `p`-adics is indeed another reason).

There may be a followup in a later ticket to deal with an inconsistency, if you agree that the following discrepancy between functions with one and two parameters needs addressing:

```
sage: i = ComplexField(30).0
sage: gamma(i)
-0.15494983 - 0.49801567*I
sage: gamma(1.0*I)
-0.154949828301811 - 0.498015668118356*I
sage: jacobi_am(2., 2)
0.549820282407325
sage: jacobi_am(2., i)
jacobi_am(2.00000000000000, 1.0000000*I)
sage: jacobi_am(2., 1.0*I)
jacobi_am(2.00000000000000, 1.00000000000000*I)
```

EDIT: Ah, never mind, `jacobi_am` takes only reals.

No, this is only about `BuiltinFunction`s, there are no functional changes to user-defined functions.
