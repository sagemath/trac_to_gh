I disagree (not strongly). I don't like to add documentation explicitly refering to something which is known to be broken. Let me also add that I didn't intentionally look for bugs in `sws2rst`. I just tried the instructions, happened to store the `.sws` file in `/tmp` and got in trouble. Together with the fact that #17308 likely has an easy fix, I think we should wait for #17308.

`sphinx-build` doesn't work for me:

```
(sage-sh) jdemeyer@tamiyo:make_tutorial$ make html
sphinx-build -b html -d _build/doctrees   . _build/html
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/local/src/sage-git/local/bin/sphinx-build", line 5, in <module>
    from pkg_resources import load_entry_point
  File "build/bdist.linux-x86_64/egg/pkg_resources.py", line 2817, in <module>
  File "build/bdist.linux-x86_64/egg/pkg_resources.py", line 451, in _build_master

  File "build/bdist.linux-x86_64/egg/pkg_resources.py", line 639, in resolve
pkg_resources.DistributionNotFound: Sphinx==1.1.2
make: *** [html] Error 1
```

I have no idea why the wrong version (1.1.2 vs. 1.2.2) is in that file, reinstalling Sphinx doesn't help.
