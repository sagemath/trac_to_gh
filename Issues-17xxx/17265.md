I disagree (not strongly). I don't like to add documentation explicitly refering to something which is known to be broken. Let me also add that I didn't intentionally look for bugs in `sws2rst`. I just tried the instructions, happened to store the `.sws` file in `/tmp` and got in trouble. Together with the fact that #17308 likely has an easy fix, I think we should wait for #17308.

I have no idea why the wrong version (1.1.2 vs. 1.2.2) is in that file, reinstalling Sphinx doesn't help.
