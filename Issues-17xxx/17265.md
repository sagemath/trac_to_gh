Okay, this seems fine and (as expected) doc builds correctly, though I'm surprised you put the manuals earlier.  I wish there was a way to indicate that the coding details included how to interface with libraries, but that would be such a long title.

Since you're the reviewer, you can be the one to set the review status, but I'm happy with this.

By which I mean if the only objection you had was that, we're good to go - I didn't know if you had any other questions.

I separated the "reorganize the index" part as a new ticket (with positive review!) #17307.

I think the part about using `--sws2rst` should only be added to the manual if it works properly, see #17308.

> To me, the issue of a small bug in `sage -sws2rst` is nearly orthogonal to adding this information.   If you strongly disagree, luckily I have two alternate fixes you can try out for #17308 - let me know.


I disagree (not strongly). I don't like to add documentation explicitly refering to something which is known to be broken. Let me also add that I didn't intentionally look for bugs in `sws2rst`. I just tried the instructions, happened to store the `.sws` file in `/tmp` and got in trouble. Together with the fact that #17308 likely has an easy fix, I think we should wait for #17308.

I have no idea why the wrong version (1.1.2 vs. 1.2.2) is in that file, reinstalling Sphinx doesn't help.
