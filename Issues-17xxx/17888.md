This adds an option to check if a set of elements are modular (and by extension, if you pass a singleton, then that element is modular). This also checks if a lattice is supersolvable, that is to say there exists a maximal chain of modular elements.

Hmm. `is_supersolvable` does not seems very efficient to me. What about something like that (not tested)

```
def is_supersolvable(self):
    """
    """
    x0 = self.minimal_elements()[0]
    x1 = self.maximal_elements()[0]
    mod_elts = [x for x in self if self.is_modular([x])]
    mg = DiGraph([e for e in self.cover_relations()
                  if e[0] in mod_elts and e[1] in mod_elts])
    return mg.shortest_path(x0, x1) != []
```
Maybe you could also make sure that `is_modular` can take a single element of the lattice as argument ?

How would you handle the following poset: `x ,- [x] <- [This is the Trac macro *x* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#x-macro)`? By enforcing that it is always a list (or quacks like one), then there's no ambiguity.

You're right. It would be good to never check twice if some element is modular.

ok, I understand. Maybe we can have a function is_modular_element, then ?

It's tomorrow...ish. I've implemented a backtracing version of `is_supersolvable`.

> ok, I understand. Maybe we can have a function is_modular_element, then ?

I've added such a method.
