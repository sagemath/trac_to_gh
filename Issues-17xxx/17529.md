Time to update: https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~latte/software.php

Update the license to GPLv2 (not v3).

The Sage package now uses the upstream tarball without modification.

The upstream tarball is here: https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~latte/software/packages/latte_current/latte-int-1.7.2.tar.gz

It should be renamed `latte_int-1.7.2.tar.gz` within `SAGE_ROOT/upstream/`

Can you tell me which commands you used to turn the original file into your bz2 file ?

When I do the same I get a different hash. Theoretically, that makes me suspect you from having inserted dangerous code inside of the binary `:-P`

I have to rename the directory `latte-int***/` to `latte_int***/` (because currently we cannot handle two or more dashes in the filename of the upstream tarball). And then different tar/bzip2 versions may produce different files...

OK, I took the tar bundle here: https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~latte/software/packages/latte_current/latte-integrale-1.7.2.tar.gz
untarred it, then untarred the latte-int-1.7.2 tarball there, renamed the resulting directory latte_int-1.7.2, and tarred it. This is as described in SPKG.txt.

I didn't bother to check the contents of the following:
> 
> https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~latte/software/packages/latte_current/


but the tarball `latte-int-1.7.2` there has the same md5 hash as the one in the bundle mentioned above.

No problem with the branch, and I could compile the spkg too. Could you drop the changelog, though ? It is not part of the 'new style' standard for SPKG.txt.

By the way, could you tell me where in Sage this spkg is used ? `O_o`
