Is there some reason for *not* to check arguments on other functions? For example

```
Posets.RestrictedIntegerPartitions('cat-says-meow')
Posets.SymmetricGroupBruhatIntervalPoset('cat-says-meow', 42)
Posets.BooleanLattice('cat-says-meow')
```

will all give exception, but they output

```
ValueError: n must be an integer or be equal to one of None, NN,
NonNegativeIntegers()

ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: ''

TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for ** or pow(): 'int' and 'str'
```

Is right check just `if not n in ZZ: raise...`?

It looks good but you should check the doctests. There are errors when you run them in the poset folder.

I do not understand. It says `Got: <BLANKLINE>`. Only change I did was changing "numbers" to "Numbers" in phrase "number of elements must be non-negative - -" at `RandomPoset()`. Of course I should have changed doctest also. But where does this blankline comes?

The blankline is a bluff. You did not only change the `n->N` but also the final '.'.
