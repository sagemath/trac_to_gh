<div id="comment:1" align="right">Comment 1</div>

Is there some reason for *not* to check arguments on other functions? For example

```
Posets.RestrictedIntegerPartitions('cat-says-meow')
Posets.SymmetricGroupBruhatIntervalPoset('cat-says-meow', 42)
Posets.BooleanLattice('cat-says-meow')
```

will all give exception, but they output

```
ValueError: n must be an integer or be equal to one of None, NN,
NonNegativeIntegers()

ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: ''

TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for ** or pow(): 'int' and 'str'
```

Is right check just `if not n in ZZ: raise...`?

I do not understand. It says `Got: <BLANKLINE>`. Only change I did was changing "numbers" to "Numbers" in phrase "number of elements must be non-negative - -" at `RandomPoset()`. Of course I should have changed doctest also. But where does this blankline comes?

Python style for exeption messages is incomplete sentences. In particular, no capitalization of the first word and no period at the end. E.g.

```
$ python
Python 2.7.8 (default, Oct 27 2014, 15:54:28) 
[GCC 4.9.1 20140930 (Red Hat 4.9.1-11)] on linux2

```
This ticket makes it worse in many places.
