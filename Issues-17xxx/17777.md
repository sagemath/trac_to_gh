<a id='comment:6'></a>The docstring of `sage.rings.infinity` states that:

  The rules for arithmetic are that the unsigned infinity ring does not canonically coerce to any other ring, and all other rings canonically coerce to the unsigned infinity ring, sending all elements to the single element "a number less than infinity" of the unsigned infinity ring. Arithmetic and comparisons then take place in the unsigned infinity ring, where all arithmetic operations that are well-defined are defined.

  [...]

  Any ordered ring coerces to the infinity ring in the obvious way.

So if I understand correctly `SR` already didn't respect this specification. But this makes me wonder if your patch won't make comparisons with infinities even more inconsistent. If you understand the issues at hand better than I do, can you explain how this is all supposed to work?

<a id='comment:19'></a>I made (essentially) the change discussed in the last few comments. Please feel free to set the ticket to positive review if you agree with the last commit.

Is there really no other way to make infinities and symbolic expression play well together? For example, what about having `SR` coerce into the infinity ring (and making the global identifier `infinity` refer to `SR(infinity)`?) Or, perhaps better, adding an intermediate “symbolic infinity ring” that would coerce into both `SR` and `InfinityRing`, but have no ingoing coercions?
