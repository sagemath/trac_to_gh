I propose several feature in this ticket:

- some generic methods for all combinatorial structures:
    - from a structure: a method "grade" to compute the degree of the structure
    - from a graded component: a method "ambient" to find the class of all structures
 I put those methods in a category called ClassesOfCombinatorialStructure.

- a generic pattern to define a class of combinatorial structure

- a fix of some combinatorial structure to be coherent with that... (permutations, compositions, binarytrees).

Ok... this is not really a duplicate... #16465 contains lot of things... to many... I'm not sure about its destiny! whatever...

This ticket #17367 provides a category of combinatorial classes `sage.categories.classes_of_combinatorial_structures.py`. 
It contains some methods that I need to define a simple design of (combinatorial) Hopf algebras.

For example, most of the time we define graded connected Hopf algebras indexed by a "connected" class of combinatorial structure `C`. This means the unit and the counit MUST be automatically defined by the unique element of the graded component of degree 0 of `C` (As an user, I don't want write again and again this same code). 

- Problem: In sage, there is no way to ask `C.graded_component(n)`. 

This ticket provides to that, it provides those kind of methods. It also provides some code to easily design a class of combinatorial structures (`sage.combinat.structures.__init__.py`)

new files: 

- `sage.categories.classes_of_combinatorial_structures.py` (the category)
- `sage.categories.examples.classes_of_combinatorial_structures.py` (an example)
- `sage.combinat.structures.__init__.py` (the design used in the example)

all classes of combinatorial structures modified to use the category:

- `sage.combinat.composition.py`
- `sage.combinat.permutation.py`
- `sage.combinat.binary_trees.py`

I am talking with Jean-Baptiste so I want to make a few things clear in this ticket for the record.  My main question when I look at this category, is how is it different than `InfiniteEnumeratedSet`?   and his answer is that an infinite enumerated set is not necessarily graded while this is the main point of defining this category.

Follow-up question is then is/should/could `ClassesOfCombinatorialStructure` be a sub-category of `GradedSet` and `InfiniteEnumeratedSet`?  He answers: it could be.

Follow-up question is then a better name `InfiniteGradedSet`? Answer: why not?

The reason graded infinite enumerated sets are ALL over combinat and we need common methods to work with them and create combinatorial Hopf algebras of a `ClassesOfCombinatorialStructure`.

Jean-Baptiste is proposing giving the `Compositions`, `Permutations` and `BinaryTrees` this treatment (as they are some of the first objects that will be used to create a CHA).  I propose adding `SetPartitions` to that list since NCSym is already defined and should follow that structure.

Hello,

I strongly think that creating this category is useless **and** I certainly understand that it is needed. What I propose is to not create a new category but make this featured sets with NN grading and finite slices available. What I would rather implement is:
- making the grading set a parameter of the category `SetsWithGrading` (in your case it would be `NN`)
- adding an axiom `FiniteSlice` to `SetsWithGrading`
That way, what you are trying to define would simply be

```
sage: SetsWithGrading(NN).FiniteSlices() & EnumeratedSets()
Join of Category of sets with grading Non negative integer semiring with finite slices
    and Category of enumerated sets
```
(.. the names are awful, but I hope that the plan is clear ...).


Related to my previous remark, you add plenty of stuff that should be discussed at the level of `SetsWithGrading`. For example the presence of a `.grade()` method. And that was actually already discussed while working on #10193 (but sadly not written explicitely in the ticket): we  want Sage to support structure of objects that do not care such much about their environment (i.e. facade sets). A good example is

```
sage: F = FiniteEnumeratedSet([1,2,3])
sage: F.an_element().parent()
Integer Ring
```

Some terminology and english weirdnesses:

- What is `denumerable`?

- Where did you found your definition of `structure`? `combinatorial structure` would make more sense. I do not understand [comment:13](#comment%3A13). If you talk about structure to a random mathematician, it will rarely end up with some combinatorics in mind.

If same thing can be achieved by adding to `SetsWithGrading`, that would be great, but I imagine that some thought will have to go into the applications of this category to make sure they can still be as simple (since one goal is to make it easy to define a combinatorial Hopf algebra, +others).

I didn't know the word `denumerable` either but in my dictionary it says "adjective - Mathematics - able to be counted by a one-to-one correspondence with the infinite set of integers" so I figure that is about right.

Jean-Baptiste and I had a discussion about the use of `structure` and he was taking it from the use in species and from `sage.misc.structure`.  I agree that it seems a bit too vague a word which prompted the switch to `ElementStructure` and `ParentStructure`.  Maybe this requires further thought.

Hi Vincent,

Thank you about your comments.

Replying to [@videlec](#comment%3A17):
> I strongly think that creating this category is useless 


This seems **not** totally useless to create a new category or I don't know how to do that easily using the category framework of sage. 
Let me ask you how to that in the following...

> **and** I certainly understand that it is needed. What I propose is to not create a new category but make this featured sets with NN grading and finite slices available. What I would rather implement is:
> - making the grading set a parameter of the category `SetsWithGrading` (in your case it would be `NN`)

The parameter *grading set* is already provided in the `SetsWithGrading` category.

> - adding an axiom `FiniteSlice` to `SetsWithGrading`

I also wish to provide a category `GradedComponent` (or `Subset`) with methods `ambient` (which return the set with grading) and `grade` (why not). Where put this class:

```python
class SetsWithGrading(Category):
   ....
   class GradedComponent(Category):
      def super_category(self):
         return .???.
      class ParentMethods:
         def ambient(self):
            pass
         def grade(self):
            pass
```

It seems natural to have `GradedComponent` as a nested class of `SetWithGrading`, right? (There is no reason that it appears elsewhere.)

At this point, if I use `FiniteSlice` as an axiom,  *a priori* this class `GradedComponent` should have `FiniteSets` (or better `FiniteEnumeratedSets`) as super category but without the axiom this only should have `Sets`. How do that (easily and properly)?

So my opinion is `FiniteSlice` is not an axiom and the code of `GradedComponent` should be duplicate, one using `Sets` as super category and the other using `FiniteSets`.

If we have a finite sets (in sage), could we assume that it is an enumerated sets? (I suppose the answer is **no** but...)

It is provided by the parents that belong to the category. You have no category `Sets with grading NN`. Whereas you have\n\n```\nsage: Modules(ZZ)\nCategory of modules over Integer Ring\nsage: Modules(Zmod(4)['a','b'])\nCategory of modules over Multivariate Polynomial Ring\n  in a, b over Ring of integers modulo 4\n```\nIn the case of `SetsWithGrading` the grading set is not attached to the category. It is just a mandatory attribute (in the common sense) of the parents of this category.\n\n> > - adding an axiom `FiniteSlice` to `SetsWithGrading`\n\n> \n> I also wish to provide a category `GradedComponent` (or `Subset`) with methods `ambient` (which return the set with grading) and `grade` (why not). Where put this class:\n\nDo you mean a method of the parent belonging to that category?\n\n- For the `.ambient()` method, this is not specific to the parent that are the graded component of a graded set. The lack is that there is nothing right now for a parent that needs to be seen as a subset of another parent. That would be the most natural. The facades are already close to that.\n\n- Do you really want to impose a `.grade()` method in each of the graded component?\n\n- On the other hand, I think that there should be a special mechanism in `SetsWithGrading` to be able to specify any restriction on the category of the graded components. That would be the most natural and certainly the easiest to implement.\n\n> It seems natural to have `GradedComponent` as a nested class of `SetWithGrading`, right? (There is no reason that it appears elsewhere.)\n\nI don't think that this `GradedComponent` should exist. As I said above, it would be better to have something to be able to specify an ambient parent.\n\n> At this point, if I use `FiniteSlice` as an axiom,  *a priori* this class `GradedComponent` should have `FiniteSets` (or better `FiniteEnumeratedSets`) as super category but without the axiom this only should have `Sets`. How do that (easily and properly)?\n\nI still do not think that this `GradedComponent` should exist... so there is no trouble.\n\n> So my opinion is `FiniteSlice` is not an axiom and the code of `GradedComponent` should be duplicate, one using `Sets` as super category and the other using `FiniteSets`. \n\nCertainly not.

This is not true. It is provided by the parents that belong to the category. You have no category `Sets with grading NN`. Whereas you have

```
sage: Modules(ZZ)
Category of modules over Integer Ring
sage: Modules(Zmod(4)['a','b'])
Category of modules over Multivariate Polynomial Ring
  in a, b over Ring of integers modulo 4
```
In the case of `SetsWithGrading` the grading set is not attached to the category. It is just a mandatory attribute (in the common sense) of the parents of this category.

Do you mean a method of the parent belonging to that category?

- For the `.ambient()` method, this is not specific to the parent that are the graded component of a graded set. The lack is that there is nothing right now for a parent that needs to be seen as a subset of another parent. That would be the most natural. The facades are already close to that.

- Do you really want to impose a `.grade()` method in each of the graded component?

- On the other hand, I think that there should be a special mechanism in `SetsWithGrading` to be able to specify any restriction on the category of the graded components. That would be the most natural and certainly the easiest to implement.

> It seems natural to have `GradedComponent` as a nested class of `SetWithGrading`, right? (There is no reason that it appears elsewhere.)

I don't think that this `GradedComponent` should exist. As I said above, it would be better to have something to be able to specify an ambient parent.

> At this point, if I use `FiniteSlice` as an axiom,  *a priori* this class `GradedComponent` should have `FiniteSets` (or better `FiniteEnumeratedSets`) as super category but without the axiom this only should have `Sets`. How do that (easily and properly)?

I still do not think that this `GradedComponent` should exist... so there is no trouble.

> So my opinion is `FiniteSlice` is not an axiom and the code of `GradedComponent` should be duplicate, one using `Sets` as super category and the other using `FiniteSets`. 

Certainly not. Solutions for categories should never be with a class for each particular problem.

> If we have a finite sets (in sage), could we assume that it is an enumerated sets? (I suppose the answer is **no** but...)

Indeed. The problem is that the behavior are actually quite different (see also [#18411 comment 39](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/18411#comment:39) and [#18411 comment 40](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/18411#comment:40)):

```
sage: FiniteEnumeratedSet([1,2,3]) == FiniteEnumeratedSet([3,2,1])
False
sage: Set([1,2,3]) == Set([3,2,1])
True
```
Enumerated in the Sage category context does not mean iterable, it is rather *with a presribed iteration order*. Nicolas wanted a new category `IterableSets` but I think it is going too far.

When we will converge to something reasonable, it would be better to split the features:
- a ticket to implement being subset of a parent (i.e. the `ambient` method)
- a ticket to implement the category restrictions on the slices
- etc

The most important is to actually **not** focus on your particular case if you want to implement something useful for categories.

I understand your point. What I say that it is already a method which provides to the parent a default grading set: `.grading_set()`.

How to use facade such that there is an `ambient` method?

Yes, this should be coherent with the degree.

I'm not sure to understand what you mean.

Ok, so have you any idea about how to do that? (I don't understand the mean `facade` or if I understand this is useless... this is just a definition without any code...)

Please, could you provide this splitting and propose some code to start? (I'm lost in the sage maze... show me the line)

I don't care about the path, but at the end, a **denumerable set** `C` (or any other name which means graded set with finite graded component) should provide (from a category) a method: `CJ = C.graded_component(J)` (with `J` an index whatever the grading set) and from this graded component we should go back to the *facade* `CJ.ambient() == C` and we must be able to control that `CJ in FiniteSets()`.

ValueError: [4, 1] not in Compositions of 3

On this branch

```
sage: Compositions(3)([4,1])
[4, 1]
