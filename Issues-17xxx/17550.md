We have

```
sage: R.<a,b> = QQ[]
sage: sorted([a,b])
[b, a]
```
which looks weird to me and is not what one would expect.

This is also inconsistent with

```
sage: var('a, b')
(a, b)
sage: sorted([a,b])
[a, b]
```
(but in this case the ordering seems always to be alphabetically.)

However, in the multivariate polynomial ring this ordering depends on the definition:

```
sage: R.<b,a> = QQ[]
sage: sorted([a,b])
[a, b]
```


Component: **algebra**

Polynomial rings have a monomial order which should affect how monomials (and hence terms) compare:

```
sage: A.<a,b>=PolynomialRing(Rationals(),order="lex")
sage: sorted([a^i*b^j for i in [0..2] for j in [0..2]])
[1, b, b^2, a, a*b, a*b^2, a^2, a^2*b, a^2*b^2]
sage: A.<a,b>=PolynomialRing(Rationals(),order="deglex")
sage: sorted([a^i*b^j for i in [0..2] for j in [0..2]])
[1, b, a, b^2, a*b, a^2, a*b^2, a^2*b, a^2*b^2]
sage: A.<a,b>=PolynomialRing(Rationals(),order="degrevlex")
sage: sorted([a^i*b^j for i in [0..2] for j in [0..2]])
[1, b, a, b^2, a*b, a^2, a*b^2, a^2*b, a^2*b^2]

I agree with you that this is related to the term orders. Yet, the order on the variables themselves doesn't change between "degrevlex" and "deglex". This is due to the fact that there are two distinct changes between these two orders.

I understand that the original posted "problem" is not one, since we use "degrevlex", but using "lex" or "deglex" the output of the lines above should definitely start with `[1, a, ...]`.

Understood.

To get something out of it, e should at least mention this in the docstrings more explicitly.

This is described in the reference manual http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/polynomial_rings/sage/rings/polynomial/term_order.html. The "two changes" I mentioned are the fact that in "degrevlex" one considers the ***last** variable whose exponent is **larger*** while in "deglex" one considers the ***first** variable whose exponent is **smaller***. Thus, if you have as first variable `a` and second variable `b`, the comparison between the two monomials `a` and `b` is:
* degrevlex: `a > b` since both monomials have degree `1` and `b` is the last variable whose exponent is smaller in the monomial `a` (0) than in the monomial `b` (1);
* deglex: `a > b` since both monomials have degree `1` and `a` is the first variable whose exponent is larger in the monomial `a` (1) than in the monomial `b` (0).

Note that, unless I make a mistake, all orders defined in SageMath satisfy `a > b`. 

I do not understand what you mean by "This should change". The way the orders are defined in SageMath seems consistent with the literature and the other softwares.
