It's not substantially more than any other symbolic function ticket. Not that there is heavy use that would justify several tickets.

Neither of this matters. The question is: can the issue be easily and naturally be split up? If the answer to that is yes, it should be done.

I have just seen too often that a ticket does A, B, C and there are issues with C. These issues with C turn out to be much harder than originally thought. Therefore, A and B are never merged or merged with a big delay, even though they could have been merged quickly.

Note: personally I don't care much about this ticket, so if a reviewer doesn't mind, then it's obviously not a problem.
