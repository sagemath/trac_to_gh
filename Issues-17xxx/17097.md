There are surprisingly many places in Sage where strings are compared with `is` instead of `==`. This actually works in simple cases:

```
sage: "foo" is "foo"
True
sage: "foo" is "foox"[:3]
False
sage: "foo" == "foox"[:3]
True
```

In `src/sage/combinat/root_system/branching_rules.py`, this requires a fix to `BranchingRule.__cmp__()` since `BranchingRule` objects need to be compared to strings.
