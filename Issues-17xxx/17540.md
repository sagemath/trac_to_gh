On the paper, the hypergraph is very well defined and you have to compute its chromatic number. In practice, you cannot build the hypergraph because the list of its edges is too huge (I would not know how to do that anyway). So what we do is start with *some* of the edges in the hypergraph, and find a coloring.

When we have a coloring, we can check that it is valid by building the corresponding graphs --> if all are acyclic that's fine and we are done.

If one is not acyclic, however, we have found a cycle --> a new set to add to our hypergraph. And so we re-color this thing again.

This being said, when you find a new set in your hypergraph, you only have to add one constraint and then you can call `.solve` again. If we called `.coloring()` each time, we would in fact be building a new LP and solve it from scratch every time we add a constraint, and that's a waste of computations that this branch avoids.

Concerning the `certificate`, it looks like a half-certificate ; is the algorithm able to provide an evidence that no smaller set of linear ordering can generate the poset by intersection ?

Also, the "just to be sure" section at the end of the code should be run only if some `check` option is set to `True` since the algorithm is supposed to work without this ?

By the way, in the `INPUT` section, it seems more common to write <code>\`\`certificate\`\` - boolean (default: \`\`False\`\`)</code> than to write the default at the end of the description (i first thought the information was missing).

I do not see how that would change anything. You are just telling me that only a subset of points  of the hypergraph matters, but that does not give me the set of edges that only involve critical pairs.

There seems to be no check for argument, i.e. `certificate='cat-says-meow'` does not raise an error. Should it?

One-line explanation on TOC should end with dot.

Does this work with empty poset? Checking just now, but compiling is slooow with this machine.

It seems that you get a smaller ILP; you run your acyclicity test and compute cycles just as you do, but only leave critical pairs there (i.e. you take the subhypergraph induced on the critical pairs --- the edges get intersected with the subset of critical pairs).

for G=K33 and with GLPK your code seems to be looping forever. In the code you call `init_LP` in the loop, rather than doing a warm restart. This seems to defeat the purpose of constraint generation.

PS. OK, I see, you increase k every time it goes up. Anyhow, one gets stuck on some LP at k=3 here...

OK, tried this with GUROBI, it did work for K33. Trying for Petersen graph now :-)

typo:

```
+            # We check that all color class induce an acyclic graph, and add a
+            # constraint otherwise.
```
do you mean `classes` ?

The Wikipedia article you refer says that this is sometimes also called "Dushnikâ€“Miller dimension". Is this common name for dimension? If so, it should be mentioned somewhere, so that user googling "Dushnikâ€“Miller sagemath" will found this.
