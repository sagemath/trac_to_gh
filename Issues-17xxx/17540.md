On the paper, the hypergraph is very well defined and you have to compute its chromatic number. In practice, you cannot build the hypergraph because the list of its edges is too huge (I would not know how to do that anyway). So what we do is start with *some* of the edges in the hypergraph, and find a coloring.

When we have a coloring, we can check that it is valid by building the corresponding graphs --> if all are acyclic that's fine and we are done.

If one is not acyclic, however, we have found a cycle --> a new set to add to our hypergraph. And so we re-color this thing again.

This being said, when you find a new set in your hypergraph, you only have to add one constraint and then you can call `.solve` again. If we called `.coloring()` each time, we would in fact be building a new LP and solve it from scratch every time we add a constraint, and that's a waste of computations that this branch avoids.

according to [FT00], instead of the hypergraph on `inc(P)`, it suffices to restrict to the induced subhypergraph of the critical incomparable pairs (see Lemma 3.3 in [loc.cit.]),  and then do the same chromatic number computation.

Concerning the `certificate`, it looks like a half-certificate ; is the algorithm able to provide an evidence that no smaller set of linear ordering can generate the poset by intersection ?

Also, the "just to be sure" section at the end of the code should be run only if some `check` option is set to `True` since the algorithm is supposed to work without this ?

By the way, in the `INPUT` section, it seems more common to write <code>\`\`certificate\`\` - boolean (default: \`\`False\`\`)</code> than to write the default at the end of the description (i first thought the information was missing).

There seems to be no check for argument, i.e. `certificate='cat-says-meow'` does not raise an error. Should it?

One-line explanation on TOC should end with dot.

Does this work with empty poset? Checking just now, but compiling is slooow with this machine.

With GLPK for `G=K_{2,3}` it returns 3 in 2.5s

```
sage: %time P.dimension()
CPU times: user 2.58 s, sys: 4 ms, total: 2.59 s
Wall time: 2.58 s
3
```

With CPLEX it takes 252ms. And for `G=K_{3,3}` it returns 4 in 6s.

PS. OK, I see, you increase k every time it goes up. Anyhow, one gets stuck on some LP at k=3 here...

typo:

```
+            # We check that all color class induce an acyclic graph, and add a
+            # constraint otherwise.
```
do you mean `classes` ?
