No it cannot. The problem is NP, so there is a certificate for a 'yes' answer, but it is not co-NP so there is no certificate for the other side. (Insert 'polynomial' wherever it fits in the sentence, and assume P!=NP)

> Also, the "just to be sure" section at the end of the code should be run only if some `check` option is set to `True` since the algorithm is supposed to work without this ?


I do not think that it should, considering the running time of the algorithm. That's almost for free comparatively, so I don't see the need to make it optional.

> By the way, in the `INPUT` section, it seems more common to write ```certificate`` - boolean (default: ``False``)` than to write the default at the end of the description (i first thought the information was missing).


Well I usually write it the way it is written. If you want to change it you are welcome to add a commit, but if it is just about enforcing the coding style you like I will not code it for you `:-P`

<a id='comment:18'></a>There seems to be no check for argument, i.e. `certificate='cat-says-meow'` does not raise an error. Should it?

One-line explanation on TOC should end with dot.

Does this work with empty poset? Checking just now, but compiling is slooow with this machine.

It seems that you get a smaller ILP; you run your acyclicity test and compute cycles just as you do, but only leave critical pairs there (i.e. you take the subhypergraph induced on the critical pairs --- the edges get intersected with the subset of critical pairs).
