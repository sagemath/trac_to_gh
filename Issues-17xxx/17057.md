For example `Poset({0:[1]}).show(figsize=0)` complains about singular matrix, and also `figsize='cat-says-meow'` is not detected as it should. And more, `figsize=32767` should not answer "width and height must each be below 32768".

Take a look at #5956 (presumably will appear in the next beta, isn't in 6.5.beta0).  I think that should catch the string problem and zero problem.  We could conceivably add even more tests for those.

The other problem is user error, in some sense, now that we document what that means, but we could try to catch that as well.
