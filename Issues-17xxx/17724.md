The method `PowerSeries.reversion(self)` returns the reverse power series of `self`. Following the apparent naming convention, I propose to rename it `PowerSeries.reverse(self)`. 

It is more consistent with other method such as (for `PowerSeries`): `derivative()` (not `derivation`) or `truncate()` (not `truncation`).

Keywords: reverse, series
