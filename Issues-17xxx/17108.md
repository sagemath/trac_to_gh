Hey,

```
+ if int(p is None)+int(set is None)+int(sets_of_size is None) <2:
+    raise ValueError("Only one parameter must be defined"
```
wouldn't `>1` be more appropriate? (I note that you used a `ValueError` and not an assert ;-)

Hum

```
+ if set is not None:
+     # getting the 'set' function back
+     set_of_points = set
+     from __builtin__ import set
```
looks like another argument name would be better... `points`? `pts`?

`point` is the current one. I want to make clear that the meaning of the function changes, so I thought that "set" would do. It cannot be detected automatically btw.

I meant instead of `set`; use something else like `points` or `pts`. Note that I assumed that the following is ugly

```
def f(list, int):
   return __builtin__.list(list) * __builtin__.int(int)
```
if you are not convinced, try first `__builtin__ = 3` in the console.

Right now

```
- def degree(self, p=None):

```
There is no `point`...

So you agree that it is unreadable ;-)

Oh sorry. But `p=None,pts=None` or `p=None,points=None` is not more meaningful either.

> So you agree that it is unreadable ;-)

Yes. What's the point ?

I just want the user interface to make sense. The meaning of `I.degree(p)` is clear, the meaning of `I.degree(set=[1,2,3])` is not optimal but contains as much information as I could put, and `I.degree(sets_of_size=3)` is as clear as possible too.

I thought of `I.degree(subset=[1,2,3])` but did not like it much. I don't see what the 'sub' does there.

So well. I am sorry if it overwrites a 'set' keyword in the function (and if, unluckily, we need it) but well... Why is that even a problem ? I rename is as early as possible to make the code clearer.

You used `p` for `point` why not use `s` for `set`?

Because `I.degree(s={1,2,3})` is not as clear as `I.degree(set={1,2,3})` is. And the `p` for `point` is not really a problem because nobody ever types it, i.e. `I.degree(0)`.

What I am saying is that from the command there is no way if by `H.degree(Set([1]))` the user means "give me the degree of the point Set([1])" or "give me the degree of the set that only contain the point 1".

This is why I need this "set=" parameter to make the difference.

1-year deprecation ?

Dima tell me: do you have an objection if I change `degree(set=the_set)` to `degree(subset=the_set)` ? And I will remove `sets_of_size` if you refuse it, it is better than a "degrees" in my mind.

there are already 9998 functions like this there in `generic_graph.py`:
`degree`, `degree_sequence`, `degree_histogram`, etc...

You might compare implementations of the 1st two and try to convince me that this is not 100% code/API bloat...

I'd rather remove the functionality of `degree_sequence` from `degree`.
It's apparently written by rlm, I doubt he'd object.

surely `subset` is better (and please, please do not name **variables/parameters** `set`, for Pete's sake...)

And yes, please get rid of `p=` and of `sets_of_size=`.

It is only a problem in your head, not a problem in the code. With two lines everything is solved, and the user interface is clearer as a result.

```
+        S = set
+        from __builtin__ import set
```

That's all it takes.

Too bad, I liked the `sets_of_size` feature.

We did almost the same in `PermutationGroup.orbit`. Instead of different flags we had a `action='OnPoints',action='OnSets', ...`. I would not mind having `IncidenceStructure.degree(p,type='set')` or `type='point'` but you would not like it.

You seem really bothered by what I do with those parameters. Are you worried that users may find it confusing ?

Hello,

I agree with Dima that `set` and `type` should be avoided as argument or variable name.

Concerning the number of functions needed, the only ambiguity I see is that `.degree()` can return a list of degrees (so that it would be more appropriate to call it `.degrees()`). What about
- `degree(self, data, subset=None)`: return the degree of a point or a subset (if `None` we assume that there is no amiguity, otherwise it must be set to `True` or `False`).
- `degrees(self, size=1)`: return the set of degrees of points. If `size` is provided with an integer > 1 then it returns the degrees of subsets of that given size.

The only reason it is done so in `PermutationGroup.orbit`is that `action` can be user-defined (at least in the underlying GAP code).
(for the record, there are currently 8 different actions available, and needless
to say, they all dispatch to the same GAP call in the code).

And here, unlike there, run-time checking and dispatching on the type of parameters
is 100% code bloat.

Hi,

Thanks for the modification. Looks like almost perfect ;-)

Beyond docs, I added the following change in my commit

Python is cool:

```
sage: sum([True])
1
sage: sum([True,False,False,True,False])
2
```
So instead of `sum(1 for x in X if condition(x))` one can write `sum(condition(x) for x in X)`.

I do not think we care here, but it has incidence

```
sage: l = [choice([True,False]) for _ in range(10000)]
sage: %timeit sum(l)
1000 loops, best of 3: 147 µs per loop
sage: %timeit sum(i for i in l)
1000 loops, best of 3: 497 µs per loop
sage: %timeit sum(1 for i in l if i)
1000 loops, best of 3: 826 µs per loop
```

I let Dima make more comments but on my side it would be ok to give positive review.
