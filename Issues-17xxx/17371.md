The following RST directive does not work in the notebook:

```
.. contents:: Table of contents
```

The table of contents are created, but the anchors do not correspond, titles are replaced bu IDs.

This bug seems not new but i do not find it on the trac.

Can you be more specific about what you mean by "does not work"?  Are you using `rst2sws` or just uploading an `rst` file, or ... ?

(I ask, but of course I don't know much about ReST directives, so I'm not sure I can help you immediately.)

Then I can report this "upstream" as well.

The problem appears when i upload the rst file directly from the notebook.

For the table of contents directive, you can have a look at http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/directives.html#table-of-contents

Now i tried to translate it into a sws file first, and i get the following error:

```
$ sage -rst2sws file.rst file.sws

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/opt/sagemath/sage-6.3/src/bin/sage-rst2sws", line 136, in <module>

    if username!='pub' and self.user_manager().user_is_guest(username):

    raise LookupError("no user '{}'".format(username))
LookupError: no user 'admin'
```

This problem seems unrelated to the `contents` directive. Not sure whether i have to open another ticket for that.

Sebastien, looks like you wrote the rst converter - any ideas?

I get the same error for the `sage -rst2sws` - apparently after processing most of it, because I get error messages for stuff when I put one that has roles it doesn't recognize.  Perhaps no one has used this recently and there was some change in the notebook that caused problems. 

Once again, Sebastien, I think you wrote this - any ideas?  Sorry for the double question, just trying to figure this out and I haven't looked closely at either of these things before.

```
from sage.misc.misc import tmp_dir
nb = Notebook(tmp_dir()+'.sagenb')

# create a worksheet
W = nb.create_new_worksheet(title, 'admin')
```
Maybe new notebooks no longer have a default admin user.  I can confirm that this *did* work in Sage 5.2, but already was broken in Sage 5.13...  That only narrows it down between sagenb-0.9.1 and 0.10.7.2, unfortunately.

Bonjour Karl, Thierry,

- At #13297, I had the 2 years old project of adding tests for cmd line rst2txt and rst2sws. If I had done this, it would have prevented the second issue raised in this ticket. Thanks for the report, you motivated me to add those doctests (I also fixed the script as you suggested). It now needs review.

- I was able to reproduce the table of content problem in three ways from the Upload page using three different files : file.rst, file.txt and file.sws. The file.rst is below. The file.sws was obtained from `sage -rst2sws`. The `file.txt` was obtained from `sage -rst2txt`. 

- The `file.rst` I used for my test is:

```
****
Tile
****

.. contents:: Table of contents

First Section
=============

:: 

    sage: 3+4
    7

Second Section
==============

:: 

    sage: 8
    8
```

- The output of `sage -rst2txt file.rst file.txt` (with #13297) contains the problem. But the problem seems to really come from docutils. Compare `href="#first-section"` with `href="#id1"`:

```
sage: rst = open('file.rst','r').read()
sage: from docutils.core import publish_string
sage: html = publish_string(rst, writer_name='html')
sage: print html
...
<h1 class="title">Tile</h1>

<div class="contents topic" id="table-of-contents">
<p class="topic-title first">Table of contents</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference internal" href="#first-section" id="id1">First Section</a></li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="#second-section" id="id2">Second Section</a></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="first-section">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id1">First Section</a></h1>
<pre class="literal-block">
sage: 3+4
7
</pre>
</div>
<div class="section" id="second-section">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id2">Second Section</a></h1>
<pre class="literal-block">
...
```

- This is using sage-6.4 and docutils version 0.7 which is quite old. The ticket #16733 was merged in sage-6.5.beta0 which updates docutils to version 0.12. We have to check if that table of content issue is fixed in 0.12.

```
sage: import docutils
sage: docutils.__version__
'0.7'
```

Indeed, in 6.5.beta0

```
sage: docutils.__version__
'0.12'
```
but I can confirm that there is still the same thing.  But I don't think this is actually problematic.  It even says back-references.  Right?
* The first table entry has id `id1`, so that the first section heading links back to it.
* The first table entry anchor links to `first-section`, which is the id of the div around that section.
* The second ones behave similarly.
So I would argue this file is behaving correctly!   I tried it with a longer file (attached) and it works correctly.

Unless I am missing something.  However, when I do something with `:ref:` directives (the Sphinx, not docutils, one), I get errors like

```
