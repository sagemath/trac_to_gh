In case someone includes new versions of m4ri and m4rie (there are no new releases yet):

Disabling SSE2 for fat builds is only necessary on x86 (32-bit), not x86_64.

But there don't seem to be configure options to disable SSE3 or SSSE3; a few early AMD x86_64 processors didn't support SSE3, and SSSE3 is only supported by *recent* AMD CPUs.
