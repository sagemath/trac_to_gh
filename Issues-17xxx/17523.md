I consider it better to restrict the `try` block to just the very thing you anticipate, namely `self` not being of type `Expression`. An error raised when converting the exponent should not lead to the `catch` block with reversed roles.

I hadn't known of the lack of reverse arithmetic operations in Cython until I read about [this here](http://docs.cython.org/src/reference/extension_types.html#arithmetic-methods). Good to know that you can't rely on the type of `self`! That manual also suggests (or even requires?) raising `NotImplemented` for mismatched operand types.
