<a id='comment:3'></a>Well, this looks good to me.

But maybe there is something subtle to check ? on different architectures, etc ?

The buildbot is almost happy, but protests for some other reasons..

Of course there is. There are lots of different architectures. However, this ticket does not have to fix all doctests on all possible architectures.

The buildbot is broken, you can ignore those failures.

Am I correct to say that this is in particular needed to cure some of the buildbot failures ?

Let me give a positive review, even if the blocker status is rather worrying to me. I hope I did not miss the point.

Not buildbot failures, but reports from other people on the `sage-release` mailing list.

The "blocker" priority shouldn't matter for reviewing the ticket. "blocker" means that Sage 6.4 must not be released before this issue is fixed, it doesn't imply that the issue is particularly deep or difficult.
