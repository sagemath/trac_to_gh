It turns out that after the upgrade to Maxima 5.34.1 (#16908), a working C compiler is needed to run Maxima on ECL, which is of course inacceptable.  The problem is caused by the compilation of four regular expressions on startup.

As a workaround until this is fixed upstream, we revert the Maxima commit introducing this compilation.

Initial report and diagnosis: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-support/wj4ObDhv_xE

Well, having calculus work for non-developers is a fairly high priority for me ;-)
