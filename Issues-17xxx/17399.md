There is no SR.function that gets the coefficients of SR.series; rather, `coeffs()` etc give confusing results; `truncate()` must be prepended manually.

```
sage: x=var('x')
sage: s=(1/(1-x)).series(x,6)
sage: s.coeffs()
[[x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + Order(x^6) + 1, 0]]
sage: s.coefficient(4)
0
```
Working around with `s.truncate()` is only a fig leaf.
