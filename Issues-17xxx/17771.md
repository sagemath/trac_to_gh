Guys, it looks like you are making many implicit assumptions on the output of `to_cycles` here. At the very least (and for a cheap cost) you should *check* them:

1) The first element of each cycle is minimum on the cycle
2) The cycles are ordered as they should

I meant that you could check, in the code of the new function, that those assumptions are valid. It has a cheap cost.

This way, if some user extends the class (or if we do it ourselves later) there is no risk of returning wrong results.

Uhm, I don't like this approach -- it means that there will still be a bug if someone extends the class, and that it will just manifest itself as an error being thrown rather than a wrong result, which is only a mitigation, not a fix.

I have codified the added assumptions in the docstring of `to_cycles`, so at least noone who reads the doc should mess it up in a subclass. :)
