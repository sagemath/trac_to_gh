The class
`sage.modules.module_with_basis_morphism.ModuleMorphismFromMatrix`
and `TriangularModuleMorphism` with `inverse_on_support="compute"`
do not pickle properly. See the comments and examples near their
respective ``TestSuite`` test.

A first potential route would be to use pickling by construction for
those classes. Another one -- more general -- would be to implement
pickling for methods of dictionaries / builtin types:

```
sage: d = {1:2}
sage: dumps(d.__getitem__)
...
TypeError: expected string or Unicode object, NoneType found

sage: dumps(dict.__getitem__)
...
PicklingError: Can't pickle <type 'method_descriptor'>: attribute lookup __builtin__.method_descriptor failed
```

This is a follow up to #8678.
