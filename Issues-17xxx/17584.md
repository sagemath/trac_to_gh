In `src/sage/modules/vector_double_dense.pyx` there is a lot of code like

```
        global numpy
        if numpy is None:
            import numpy
```

However, since the whole module is not imported at startup, we might as well just put a global

```
cimport numpy
import numpy
```
and be done with it (we really need both the `cimport` and the `import` since the `.pxd` file comes from Cython which declares only the C API, not all numpy Python functions).

I am curious about the commend that the numpy method must be last... do you have a minimal example for that bug?
