Before:

```
sage: print GF(5).factored_unit_order.__doc__
File: sage/rings/finite_rings/finite_field_base.pyx (starting at line 729)

        Returns the factorization of ``self.order()-1``, as a 1-element list.

        The format is for compatibility with
        :mod:`~sage.rings.finite_rings.integer_mod_ring`.

        EXAMPLES::

            sage: GF(7^2,'a').factored_unit_order()
            [2^4 * 3]
        
```

After:

```
sage: print GF(5).factored_unit_order.__doc__
FiniteField.factored_unit_order(self)
File: sage/rings/finite_rings/finite_field_base.pyx (starting at line 729)

        Returns the factorization of ``self.order()-1``, as a 1-element list.

        The format is for compatibility with
        :mod:`~sage.rings.finite_rings.integer_mod_ring`.

        EXAMPLES::

            sage: GF(7^2,'a').factored_unit_order()
            [2^4 * 3]
        
```

The attached branch mostly works, but there are still issues in `src/sage/misc/sageinspect.py`

In particular, I need help with navigating this maze:

That's for dynamic classes, hence, it is pure Python, and the embedding in docstrings isn't relevant here.

Details: In the category framework we have all these nested dynamic classes which get a name that is formed by the name of a class they will be attribute of. Hence:

```python
class Modules(Category):
    def __init__(...):
        ...
    class Homset(Homset_generic):
        def __init__(...)
```
Hence, you have a class `Modules` and you have an attribute `Modules.Homset` that itself is a class (nested classes). Now, you will find:

```
sage: Modules.Homset.__name__
'Modules.Homset'
```

Hence, you will NOT find the source code of the class by searching the name in the source file. But the name does give you a possibility to find the code, namely by first searching for the source of the class `Modules` in the source file and then searching for the source of the class `Homset` in the source of `Modules`.

It isn't relevant for Cython classes, since there is a metaclass at work (and you can't have metaclass for Cython classes). It *could* perhaps be in a cython file, though.

Why does pip come into play here? Isn't pip optional?

<a id='comment:24'></a>
First observation: The underlying problem appears to not be in `_sage_getsourcelines_name_with_dot`.

Namely, the reason why the element class' source can not be found is that the "parent" class can not be found:

```
sage: from sage.misc.sageinspect import sage_getsourcelines
sage: from sage.misc.nested_class_test import TestNestedParent
sage: sage_getsourcelines(TestNestedParent)[0][0]
'cdef class Parent(category_object.CategoryObject):\n'
```
So, we need to find out why `sage_getsourcelines` returns the sources of `Parent` (a super-class of `TestNestedParent`).

```
sage: from sage.misc.sageinspect import sage_getfile
sage: sage_getfile(TestNestedParent)
'/home/king/Sage/git/sage/src/sage/structure/parent.pyx'
```
OK, that's wrong.

`sage_getfile` relatively early tries to extract the file from the docstring --- and when it fails, then it tries to extract it from the `__init__` of the object!

So, since `TestNestedParent.__init__` is the same as `Parent.__init__`, things become wrong.

... and that's on purpose, according to the documentation of `_sage_getdoc_unformatted`:

```
If ``__init__`` has embedding information, we prefer that::

        sage: C = QQ['x', 'y'].__class__
        sage: print C.__doc__
        MPolynomialRing_libsingular(base_ring, n, names, order='degrevlex')
        sage: print C.__init__.__doc__

        <BLANKLINE>
                Construct a multivariate polynomial ring...
```
Thus, `_sage_getdoc_unformatted` is the wrong tool for our purpose, since we do *not* want to prefer the doc of `__init__`.

Also: What happens if a class derived from `Parent` has no docstring?

Note that the following crashes:

    ....:     def __init__(self):
    ....:         'docstring'

That's strange, since it is all pure Python, and since

```
sage: inspect.getsource(Foo.__init__)
```
works.

Even more strange: In `getsource(Foo.__init__)`, the whole source of `Foo` is determined. Hence, it *it* possible to get the source of `Foo`. That's a bug in Python's inspect.getsource.

I wonder if we should fix that. Certainly not here, though.

The doctests pass with my new commit.

However, two issues should be addressed:
- The signature for interactively defined Cython methods (I don't know if "interactive" is the reason why it fails) should be embedded, too
- The embedded signature should be used in sage_getargspec. There should be a function that extracts both the method/function name and the argspec from the embedded signature.

Why do you think it is outside the scope of this ticket? It is about Cython embedding the signature into docstring, and I don't see why Cython should distinguish `sage -b` from compilation of interactive code.

For sure, we can only use the embedded signature when it is *uniformely* embedded. Otherwise I don't see the point of embedding.

What about the additional blank line in a doc string? Do you think we should simply insert it into the failing test in `src/sage/sets/set_from_iterator.py`, or make it so that there is no additional blankline?

The make doc error says:

```
OSError: [polynomia] docstring of sage.rings.polynomial.laurent_polynomial.LaurentPolynomial_mpair.derivative:1: WARNING: Inline emphasis start-string without end-string.
```

The doc string is:

```
sage: print sage.rings.polynomial.laurent_polynomial.LaurentPolynomial_mpair.derivative.__doc__
LaurentPolynomial_mpair.derivative(self, *args)
File: sage/rings/polynomial/laurent_polynomial.pyx (starting at line 2283)

        The formal derivative of this Laurent polynomial, with respect
        to variables supplied in args.

        Multiple variables and iteration counts may be supplied; see
        documentation for the global derivative() function for more
        details.

        .. seealso::

           :meth:`_derivative`

        EXAMPLES::

            sage: R = LaurentPolynomialRing(ZZ,'x, y')
            sage: x, y = R.gens()
            sage: t = x**4*y+x*y+y+x**(-1)+y**(-3)
            sage: t.derivative(x, x)

            sage: t.derivative(y, 2)
            12*y^-5
```
`*args` would be interpreted as an emphasis to the text of the docstring, which indeed isn't ended by another `*`.

But isn't sage_getdoc called for creating the docs? It *does* strip the embedded information!

Am I right that stripping the old embedding information is stripped by stuff from `sphinx.util`?

`make doc` still fails. I see several errors.

One error looks like this:

```
[combinat ] /home/king/Sage/git/sage/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/combinat/__init__.py:docstring of sage.combinat:39: WARNING: undefined label: sage.coding (if the link has no caption the label must precede a section header)
```
No idea what that means.

Another error:

```
[finite_ri] docstring of sage.rings.finite_rings.finite_field_base.FiniteField.algebraic_closure:1: WARNING: Inline strong start-string without end-string.
```
That again seems like a failing removal of `**kwds` from the signature, or similar problems.
Indeed:

```
sage: print sage_getdoc_original(sage.rings.finite_rings.finite_field_base.FiniteField.algebraic_closure)
FiniteField.algebraic_closure(self, name='z', **kwds)
File: sage/rings/finite_rings/finite_field_base.pyx (starting at line 1278)

        Return an algebraic closure of ``self``.

        INPUT:
...
```
So, although `sage_getdoc_original` is supposed to strip the embedding information, it doesn't!

You are right, it seems to be a problem with cached methods.

This is the reason why the docstring of `__init__` was preferred when `__doc__` contains no embedding information:

```
sage: print sage.structure.parent.Parent.__doc__
Parent(base=None, category=None, *, element_constructor=None, gens=None, names=None, normalize=True, facade=None, **kwds)

This should be fixed since now this causes `make doc` to fail.

So, I suggest we work on top of the now attached branch.

In any case, the `Parent` problem persists.

Why should the cached function change *anything* to the doc? I think it should just pass through the original documentation unchanged.

I'd suggest that the signature should not be inserted. There is no reason to insert the signature of `Parent.__init__` into `Parent.__doc__`, since the same signature is also inserted into `Parent.__init__.__doc__`, where it belongs.

When we will be using the inserted signature in a new version of `sage_getargspec`, we will be considering `__init__` anyway when it is used on a class.

I'll try to figure out how it works.

Hm. `__init__` is not explicitly considered in your patch. So, I can't figure out what needs to be done.

Do we have a possibility to convince Cython to either not use `Foo.__init__` for inserting the signature into `Foo.__doc__`, or to add the embedding information in addition to the signature into `Foo.__doc__`?

With the new commit, the documentation builds. I hope it builds fine. Actually I think there should be no change to how it has previously looked like. I didn't finish all tests yet.

Comments on the commits:

As I said, it is essential for source code inspection that embedding information of a function is available in the docstring of a cached version of that function. That's why I did not work on top of your branch.

Here are a couple of reasons for what I did:

- The signature is sometimes not understood by sphinx, as for sphinx both `*` and `**` have different meanings than for the embedded signature. Hence, the signature should be stripped from the documentation. I used a heuristics for stripping the signature, assuming that
  - the signature appears in the first line
  - it starts with the undotted name of the object resp. of its class, followed by an opening bracket.

  If this pattern is found, the first line will be removed. Note that if there is embedding information then the signature information will be cut off anyway by `_extract_embedded_position`.

- When the signature is inserted, a previously empty docstring becomes non-empty, which means that an object would appear in the documentation that previously didn't. Worse: When an object's docstring is empty, its `__init__` docstring was used for documentation instead. There are cases (mainly in sage.combinat) providing documentation AND references in the `__init__` docstring. Hence, it is essential to have them, since otherwise the doc doesn't build. So, I let `sage_getdoc_original` use `__init__` when nothing else is found after stripping *both* signature and embedding information.

- It is important that `sage_getdoc_unformatted` returns the same docstring for a class and for an instance of the class (unless the instance explicitly has its own `__doc__` attribute). Otherwise, each of such instance found in a module would appear in the reference manual.

I documented my changes, and so far the tests have passed. Hence: Needs review!

Simon, I assume that "needs_review" implies that you agree with the commits on this branch that I made?

That's why I inserted my name as a reviewer `:-)`

But I must admit that I don't understand *why* your changes result in inserting the signature into the docstring. I just see that they *do*. And I see that we can cope with it, and shall eventually be able to use the new information.

So, perhaps you can explain how your changes really work, so that I'd really qualify as a reviewer...

I'll read this as an agreement...

I think that just calls `sageinspect.sage_getdoc`, which calls `format()` on the original (i.e. without embedding info) doc.

I wanted to test that the init method belongs to typ and is not inherited from a super class.

Hmm, this patch doesn't behave so nicely for some of Python's docs:

```
sage: print type.__doc__
type(object) -> the object's type
type(name, bases, dict) -> a new type

sage: print sage_getdoc_original(type)
type(name, bases, dict) -> a new type
```

This causes
