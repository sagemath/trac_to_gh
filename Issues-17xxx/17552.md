Yooooooooooooo !

I fixed a couple of things, like long lines and the changelog (we shouldn't have a changelog anymore in those files. It was only useful in the Mercurial era).

Some other modifications later, the branch seems to work:

1) Checkout the branch (which I rebased on the latest beta)
2) Download the bliss archive in your "upsream/" folder
3) Run "sage -i bliss"

http://www.steinertriples.fr/ncohen/tmp/bliss-0.72.tar.bz2

Now that you have a working example, perhaps it will be easier to understand. Also, perhaps you can link your bliss patch without any problem once this is installed `;-)`

Yes, if this option is enabled then bliss can compute the order of the automorphism group. By default this option is not enabled in bliss.

As far as I am concerned I don't think we need this feature since the performance crucial part is to get the generators of the group and once we have them PermuationGroup.order does a pretty good job.

Well the motivation for this patch is the work that I am doing in which I've found that computing the automorphism group of a graph in Sage is quite inefficient. The order itself is never a big computational problem.

That said I'd like this to be as efficient as possible and hence avoid computing the order of the group and just return the generators as quickly as possible. 

Hence I would suggest we leave this as is for now and if someone starts to struggle computing orders of the automorphism group of a graph we can easily include it at that point.

My comment "i don't think we need this feature" is based on the fact that I work with graphs in Sage on a daily basis and I honestly think this is not useful at this point.

I have added a patch to this SPKG fixing a newly found bug in bliss. 

As for the error check. Is it actually necessary given that && is used to glue the statements together?

When you do

```
A && B && C

D
```
a check is needed between `A && B && C` and `D`.

A commit was added then removed in the meantime, and as a result I have nothing new to mention. Seems to do the job (well, we'll see that in #17464 `:-P`) and all 'formalities' have been fulfilled as far as I can tell... I switch it to `positive_review`.
