No followup (unfortunately, sorry) on this issue in over a year, and the link to the log is broken so there's probably nothing we can do with this. I have Sage's Python (now 2.7.10) building on Cygwin without significant issues (see #20437 for one known issue).

This issue can probably be closed but I don't have permissions to do so.
