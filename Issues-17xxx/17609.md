Hmmmmm... If it always hangs on infinite groups, what about raising an exception in that case instead of waiting forever ?

Done. But I do not know if it hans for **all** infinite groups. You can decide conjugacy in many groups (e.g. SL(2,Z) and its finite index subgroups, free groups and its finite index subgroups).

Would you say that it is a good idea to raise that exception, then ?
