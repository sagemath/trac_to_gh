Replace the unreliable floating-point arithmetic of `PeriodicRegion.__div__` in `src/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/period_lattice_region.pyx` by pure integer arithmetic to avoid floating-point rounding issues.

Note that I don't understand the purpose of the code, I just want to fix the fact that the results are not reproducible.

## Background
this is causing doctest failures in #16938 due to slightly different floating-point rounding. The failure is the following:

```
sage -t src/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/period_lattice_region.pyx
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/period_lattice_region.pyx", line 395, in sage.schemes.elliptic_curves.period_lattice_region.PeriodicRegion.__div__
Failed example:
    (S / 3).plot()
Expected:
    Graphics object consisting of 109 graphics primitives
Got:
    Graphics object consisting of 121 graphics primitives
**********************************************************************
```
(this output of `plot()` commands was added by #16746). As you can see, there are more pixels in the debug version.

Part of the problem with the old code is that it's not clear what it is supposed to do.

Anyway, I claim the following: if you assume that all the floating point operations are exact, the 4 lines all do exactly the same so they can easily be replaced by 1 line. I guess the addition of the 3 extra lines was simply to hide floating-point rounding errors.

I agree.  It took me doxens of hours (literally) to work out what RB's code did, and I asure you that this whole file is now very much more understandable than it was before.  That was a while ago though.

Something like that, but I am now unconvinced in the correctness of either the old or the new.

There's a parallelogram, whose vertices in C are 0, w1, w2, w1+w2.  The state of the object at any time is held by a 2-dimensional array "data", say of dimensions r x c, indicating, out  of all the r*c sub-parallelograms which the big one is divided into, those for which data[i,j]=True have some property.  The plots show this configuration.  When the structure is divided by n the entire thing is supposed to be shrunk by 1/n and then replicated n*n times to fill the whole parallelogram with n*n copies of the original configuration.

Back to the code...

I just looked at the original Magma code but it has been changed too much by RB to be of any help here.

For rigour it is important the overestimate, in the sense that if any part of a tile contains a point for which the condition is True then the whole tile should be included.  If one overestimates and includes a tile unnecessarily, then this may slow down the procedure a little but rigour is preserved.  The original subdivision is into r x c tiles.  Division first creates (n*r)x(n*c) smaller tiles, then shrinks these by a factor of n.  Before shrinking there are 2 integer indices, a*r+i and b*c+j running through range(n*r) and range(n*c) respectively.  [r and c are called rows and cols in the code.]   These then undergo rounded division to give a pair of indices in range(r), range(c).

Here is the important part:  when a*r+i is exactly divisible by n then using (a*r+i)/n is fine, and similarly with column indices, BUT if a*r+i is between two multiples of n then BOTH the quotients (rounded down AND up) should be used.  That is why up to 4 tiles may get tagged.

The old code was supposed to do this, but I don't think it did so correctly.  The following is, I think, what it should be like:

```
u = (a*rows+i)//n
v = (b*cols+j)//n
u_exact = (n*u==a*rows+i)
v_exact = (n*v==b*cols+j)
dat = data[i,j]
new_data[u,v] = dat
if not u_exact:
   new_data[u+1,v] = dat
   if not v_exact:
       new_data[u+1,v+1] = dat
else:
   if not v_exact:
       new_data[u,v+1] = dat
```

I think I understand your explanation, but shrinking a tile by a factor n (where n is integer, this is crucial!) should ensure that a shrinked tile lies in exactly one big tile: every big tile contains exactly n x n shrinked tiles.

So I don't think there is a problem.

It seems like the old code was confused about whether or not n should be an integer...

That's the crucial point here. Each minitile lies in *exactly one* big block, which is why it works.
