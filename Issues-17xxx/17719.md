#15631 added the following lines to `src/sage/interfaces/expect.py`:

```
                    if out == '':   # match bug with echo
                        out = line
```
It seems these were added to be compatible with an existing bug.

Instead, fix that bug!

Looks good to me.

I have just made a small commit, adding another trac role, removing an unused variable and a duplicated import, all of that in the singular interface. If you agree, you can set this to positive review.
