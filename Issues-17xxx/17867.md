Ticket #14288 added a feature meant for educational purposes only which can *very easily* be confused with Sage's support of Linear Programming, as the two classes it creates are named LPProblem and LPProblemStandardForm *AND* imported in the global namespace.

That's suicidal.

With this branch, the two classes are renamed to something more meaningful, pointers are added toward `MixedIntegerLinearProgram`, and the old import are deprecated.

```
sage: P = LPProblem(A, b, c, ["C", "B"], variable_type=">=")

Could you make a reference in the doc of `MixedIntegerLinearProgramming` toward `InteractiveLPProblem`? People might be delighted to have an interactive object to learn more about the black box! Though it is only about float linear programming isn't it?

And (not for this ticket) it would be cool if the arguments were compatible: namely `variable_type` being either `<=`, `>=` or the empty string in `ILPP` versus the argument `nonnegative=True` in `MILP`. `problem_type` in `ILPP` versus `maximization=True` in `MILP`, etc. Wouldn't it?

And last but not the least: we can use the class `ILPP` to cross check the validity of (float) `MILP` and vice-versa.

I expect.

Definitely, and these certificates are produced for free when using simplex method, one should just get them out - do solvers interfaces from Sage support providing them?

Commercial solvers like CPLEX and GUROBI do provide these certs, as well as CVXOPT, but GLPK apparently not, cf https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/help-glpk/2010-11/msg00062.html
Apparently this is still the case, although the latter conversation took place in 2010.

Not sure about PPL.

Yesyes. I hope that this will not change too much on your side, and that nobody will get to one class when (s)he should be working with the other.

given the plethora of different formulations of LPs, it's a bit hard do say. If we talk about canonical primal-dual pair, i.e. `max c*x s.t. Ax<=b` and `min b*y s.t. yA=c`, then optimality is  the complementary slackness (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming#Complementary_slackness), so that one should give a primal and a dual optimal solution (so that the user can check that they satisfy it).

for ineasibility, a Farkas certificate (i.e. coefficients of a nonnegative linear
combination of inequalities producing a contradiction) seems to be an obvious choice.

floats, or the other appropriate base ring (e.g. rationals for PPL).

Anything that maps correctly into the list of constraints would do.
