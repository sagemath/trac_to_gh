Volker,
Thank you for the work making this mesh with the flask server better.  I have been bogged down with work and getting an upstream fix so that Java applets can act just like the javascript version and have a static image put up first instead of immediately launching the applet.  I have pushed that to Bob Hanson for final approval and folding into the JSmol javascript libraries.  Hopefully, that will be in JSmol/Jmol soon.  It should have no effect on this, but I will start testing what you've put together against that now.

I don't think so, but Sage won't do any commits to sagenb, that will have to be upstream, I guess.

Also, I'm back and should have some time this week to review the various tickets involved in this, so if that can get figured out that would be awesome!

I know that, which is why I said **sorry**.  

PS To be fair, YOU are the one who made the branch on this ticket, though!  At that time you didn't make the dependency on #16004 explicit either, and in fact, I think you confirmed that you tried this one without the other on some ticket or other!  Just sayin'.

PPS thanks for unmerging.  I just haven't had the chance to make the package yet for #16004.  You even beat me to putting in the dependency just now :-)
