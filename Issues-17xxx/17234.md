This framework separates the construction of rich output (images, mathjax, 3d scenes, ...) from the viewer details. Displaying rich output is handled by interchangeable plugins that encapsulate the differences between various notebooks, the command line, etc.

As a side effect, mathjax output in the ipython notebook works now.

This is now feature complete and all doctests pass. I will not rebase the branch any more, all future additions will be incremental.

The only thing missing is some documentation.

Some comments for now:

* It seems like the `show` method should maybe get moved to the `SageObject` class. It pops up everywhere, is more or less the same (other than supporting some deprecated functionality in a small handful of places) and as far as I can tell should work for every child of `SageObject`.
* Similarly, in graphics.py, a bit of refactoring could be done by creating a common parent for `Graphics` and `GraphicsArray` (maybe something like `GraphicsBase`)
* In `sage.repl.formatter` there is presumably a debugging print statement still left in `SagePlainTextFormatter`.
* In the module docstring for `sage.repl.image` you mention the class `SageImage`, which you presumably renamed to just be `Image`. I didn't see any other instances of this, but it warrants a double check.
* In `sage.repl.interpreter` it would be good to at least have trivial docstrings for the new methods as well as `# not tested` doctests -- hopefully it reduces the number of coverage complaints (even though it is a bit silly in this case).
* For the display magic, you deprecate some old values, maybe add a proper `deprecation`? (or maybe this doesn't work well with magics, I don't know)
* The only the first pdf assertion in validate method for the doctest backend is being tested at the moment.
* The `display_immediately` method on the IPython notebook backend currently does return something.
* The `display_immediately` doctest for the test backend is actually testing the base backend.
* For the various backends, wouldn't it make more sense for the supported_types to return frozensets rather than sets (since really the supported types aren't mutable). You do this later in the display manager.
* For the display manager, why don't you just make a it have a unique instance (either by using a metaclass, or by using `__new__`) rather than just assert that there is only one instance?

Once I get a chance to test it and give it a second pass I'll add some more comments. It would also be good to get someone familiar with SageNB to take a look at this, since I have no idea what hacks SageNB depends on and can't really review the SageNB backend.

1, 2) I agree on the first two, but I don't want to do any further refactoring on this ticket. It is already way too big...

3) is actually never used, thouugh it might be handy to have a plain IPython formatter. I've clarified the documentation.

6) its still not clear to me what the best syntax is, so for now I think its easiest to just allow different combinations. But I don't like "simple" (not expressive, better: "plain") and "typeset" (probably better: "mathjax").

7) was supposed to be `OutputImageDvi`, fixed.

10) The backend supported_output can return any iterable. The display manager then turns that into a nice frozen set and performs checks and type demotion. Nobody interacts with the backends directly, the display manager intentionally has no public accessor for the current backend.

11) Just for simplicity, the display manager's type isn't global so you already have to work to try to make a second instance. You aren't going to accidentally call the ctor.

A few more comments:

1. I think it would be better to have a latex output type rather than a mathjax output type -- different backends might use different renders for latex, (e.g. the command line currently uses the pdflatex command + a pdf viewer). This should work fine with ipython which supports the text/latex MIME type (which it renders with mathjax).

2. Sure, we can hold off on the show stuff for another ticket, this is already quite big. (Note for future ticket) From talking with William, he convinced me that `show` should be an alias for `pretty_print`, which should always tries to use a rich output for an object (falling back on the plain text), while the plain `print` function should always use the plain text for the object.

3. I don't really like right now how the graphics and text are treated very differently at the moment -- the graphics object are responsible for creating their own output types, while the display manager/backend is responsible for creating text output types. I would define both ascii art and latex output as rich output rather than plain text output, and would then move the logic for an object's rich output to the `_rich_repr_` method of the object itself (in this case it would go into `SageObject._rich_repr_`).

4. I'm getting a lot of doctests failing under `sage.plot` (I can attach a log if you aren't getting them). A lot of them are fixed with changing `tachyon.png.save` to `tachyon.png.save_as` on line 244 of `sage.plot.plot3d.base` (this also fixes 3d plots in SageNB for me).

1) sounds good, I can make the change

2) agree but thats yet another ticket for sure. a better name for the `viewer='...'` keyword option that works also for plain text / latex / 2d animation formats / ... would be nice, too. (see also: #17783)

3) our text formatters are special in that they also apply to non-Sage objects, namely tall Python list and alike. So we can't just move them to `SageObject._rich_repr_`

4) I see, I have Java installed and you don't. Fixed.

Regarding point 3:

But they don't work consistently, which is precisely the problem with trying to handle the all text with the display manager (the object itself is always going to know best how to represent itself). For instance, the tall list stuff only works for lists and tuples, not sets or dicts or even Sage's Set_object.

I would rather see something like a `_call_plain_repr` method that checks whether an object is a builtin type that we are giving a our own repr method to, and then call our repr method in that case (rather than the the built in one).

Regardless, there would be a lot of redoing of stuff to make something like that work, so it is probably best to put in another ticket anyway.

Replying to [git](#comment%3A51):

[ ... ]

A couple data point for this commit (6.6 beta1 built from scratch + this trac branch) :
1) code builds OK, but doc building fails (" make doc-clean && make " succeeds).
2) in the Ipython notebook :
- %display typeset gives typeset (MathJax) output. At last ! This was my motivation for testing this branch.
- %display ascii_art fails for not having an output stream
- %display simple restores default output (whew...)
- no 3D viewer available but tachyon."jmol" and "canvas3d" fail silently, "java3d" gives a deprecation warning pointing to "wavefront", which fails silently.

Hoping this helps.

I fixed the ascii art issue.

I'm aware that there is still no 3d graphics in the notebook at this point, but that should go to another ticket.

I got 3 failures after "ID 215-02-28-17-11-36-39ff4408", testlong got three failures in src/sage/plot/plot3d/base.pyx (see below) , all bound to 3D graphics. The rest got no failures.

I got no build failure after integrating the last commit(s), but I did **not** rebuild from scratch.

Is that enough for "positive review" ? Do you need a scratch build (long since serial : I didn't integrate #17839...) ?

HTH.

The three errors :

a173e92 builds without a hitch and passes (p)testlong with no failure ; the Ipython notebook is functional and displays Mathjax and asci art ==> positive review.

The (temporary) loss of 3D plotting is a (small) nuisance, though. Are there already tickets to watch for  this functionality ?

I also note that plot3d(..) or p1=plot3d(...) ; p1 does display in the Ipython notebook, as long as no argument of plot3d has to be passed to show() and friends. Is this "vestigial" (or "embryonic") 3D displaying the intended behaviour ?

Yes, indeed. My curiosity was towards the notebook functionality : the Ipython notebook, wit its one-file container, is a real boon. 

But, for me at least, not having typeset math (or at least decent ascii_art display) is a pain. So I'm eager to see an Ipython notebook with typesetting functionality.

Does it make sense to add a OutputDelimitedLatex class and update BackendIPythonCommandline?  I run an ipython shell from inside Emacs.

Thanks.  I opened #18115 with the new approach.  It seems to work, but I've probably forgotten something.
