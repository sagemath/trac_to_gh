This branch adds to Sage's thematic tutorial an explanation of how to interface a C code (or a compiled library) with Sage. It does not replace the developer's manual section entitled "Packing third-party code" as it is only a way to make it work "on your own compputer", without the complications that are only cause by Sage's infrastructure.

I have been asked the same instructions several times, and with this we will have a link to provide instead of the same explanation and the example files.

Well, the point is actually that with this you can give it a try and witness that it does work `;-)`

Volker? Do you know how to link to a compiled library while outside of Sage? Can you teach me? And I'll write the doc!

Hello Volker,

> You can link compiled C/C++ code with a stand-alone Cython project like in https://github.com/vbraun/lattice_phi4. Then just import as module in Sage.  


I tried it but I was not able to compile it. It seems that I am missing some headers.

I kept on whipping my test files and go to something new, though: I was able to make it work provided that I copied libdoublevector.so to SAGE_ROOT/local/lib/.

Now, I am trying to make it all run from my working directory but I meet the following problem:
- When calling "%runfile double_vector_sage.pyx" there are two calls to GCC
- The one which contains -ldoublevector is not the one that contains -L/home/ncohen/a

As a result the second call always fails, because the library is not found.

```
sage: %runfile double_vector_sage.pyx
Compiling ./double_vector_sage.pyx...
...
RuntimeError: Error compiling ./double_vector_sage.pyx:
running build
running build_ext
building '_home_ncohen_a_double_vector_sage_pyx_5' extension

 -w -O2 -L/home/ncohen/a/

 -L/home/ncohen/.Sage/local/lib
```

The header of my .pyx file is:

```
#clib doublevector
#cargs -L/home/ncohen/a/
```

Thanks to you if you can give me some hint. In the meantime I'll be trying again to make it work.

Nathann

There is probably some alternate reality where the new description is useful for others to read/search, I just lack the imagination for it.

Once you install the shared library into Sage you might just as well go through `module_list.py` as well.

which however I think you are right is not in the tutorial, you seem to have taken a different approach.

As for the OS X, I think the `.so` files are called `.dylib` (at least sometimes) and on Cygwin `.dll`... but I am not an expert in such things.  Good luck!  This would indeed be a good tutorial to have.

Okay I can do that... I saw Jeroen's home path in several documents of the developer's manual, so I thought it did not matter.

Yes, probably.

  SO tells me there are two errors - need to include stdio.h and then compile with `-c` or provide a main function.  Still get the weird error about it not existing when I try to `%runfile`, though.
* Similar problems with the final library example.

This I do not understand. Is hello_sage is in the same folder as hello.c ? `O_o` I really do not understand that.

No no, you should not have to. And I would prefer to avoid asking the user to change the PATH anyway `O_o`

> * And since presumably I needed to compile `double_vector.c` first, I tried that, but...


Nono, you do not need to compile it by itself (and when you do it complains because no 'main' function is defined, which is correct). It gets compiled when you call "runfile". Actually, you do not need to compile 'hello.c' at first. It is just to give an example. If it gets complicated we can remove this compilation of "hello world", actually. It is not necessary.

> * Similar problems with the final library example.


When you say "similar problem", is it also about 'main' ? `O_o`

Hello,

I tried with my MBA/OSX Yosemite.
The documentation is clear and useful.
I'm able to reproduce all examples without error/warning.

Unless others have difficulties on other systems, I vote for positive review.
Let me know if I can change the status.

David.
