We have

```
sage: 3/2 in RIF
True
sage: 2/3 in RIF
False
```
which is a bit surprising. The elements can be converted to RIF:

```
sage: RIF(2/3)
0.6666666666666667?
sage: RIF(3/2)
1.5000000000000000?
```
This is also in contrast to

```
sage: 2/3 in RR
True
sage: 3/2 in RR
True
```

Due to the discussion below, the aim of this ticket is to explicitly mention this behaviour in the documentation.

**Keywords:** rationals, real interval field, inclusion

This is not really a bug since is is consistent with the documentation, see `RIF.__contains__??` : if x is not already an element of A, "x in A" means there is an element in A that is equal to x, which is true for 3/2 but not for 2/3. Indeed, 2/3 has no exact floating point representation, so any candidate in RIF to be equal to 2/3 will be a non trivial interval, for which equality can not hold:

```
sage: RIF(2/3).endpoints()
(0.666666666666666, 0.666666666666667)
sage: RIF(3/2).endpoints()
(1.50000000000000, 1.50000000000000)
```

I see; my mistake. I've added an example to the documentation which shows this.

Documentation is always welcome.

Perhaps could you also use the `.is_exact()` method in both cases and then the `.endpoints()` method in the 2/3 case to show the difference, since equal string representations for floating point numbers does not necessarily imply equality of floating point numbers ?

See for example:

```
sage: 1.0 + 1.0.ulp()
1.00000000000000
sage: 1.0
1.00000000000000
sage: 1.0 + 1.0.ulp() == 1.0
False
```

> Perhaps could you also use the `.is_exact()` method in both cases and then the `.endpoints()` method in the 2/3 case to show the difference, since equal string representations for floating point numbers does not necessarily imply equality of floating point numbers ?

Done.

You can look at [the page of the doc](http://sagemath.org/doc/reference/structure/sage/structure/parent.html#sage.structure.parent.Parent.__contains__), the `__contains__` method appears since, in the documentation of the `Parent` class, there is a line:

```
    .. automethod:: __contains__
```

This lets the hidden method `__contains__` to be visible in the doc.

That said, i agree that something about this could be made explicit in the doc of `RIF`, not only `Parent`.
