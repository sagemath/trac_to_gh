In its current state, 'numerical_sage' is a 'document' of its own while it is literally a 'thematic tutorial'. This branch moves the foler where it belongs, and updates the links.

Note: in order to look at this branch's diff you should use `git diff -M HEAD ^develop`. Otherwise you will see files being added/removed while they are only renamed. The `-M` option makes this clear.

The patch moves properly `numerical_sage` to the `thematic_tutorials`.

I have observed the following problems that may or not be related to this patch:

* At the end of page `.../sage/src/doc/output/html/en/thematic_tutorials/numerical_sage/index.html`, I click on `Index` to go to page `.../sage/src/doc/output/html/en/thematic_tutorials/genindex.html`. Problem: the 'Index pages by letter:' is empty and the page `Full index on one page (can be huge)` is also empty. So pages `thematic_tutorials/genindex.html` and `thematic_tutorials/genindex-all.html` are empty.

* At the end of page: `.../sage/src/doc/output/html/en/thematic_tutorials/toctree.html`, the link `Indices and tables` points to `.../sage/src/doc/output/html/en/thematic_tutorials/numerical_sage/index.html#indices-and-tables`

Hello,

It was not a problem from this patch, but indeed this 'indices and tables' section is quite useless. I remove it in an additional commit.
