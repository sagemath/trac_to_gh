After longer calculation instead of "CPU time: 12345.67 s" it would be nice to have "CPU time: 3:25:45 (12345.67 s)" or something similar.

Here is one suggestion for timeit format:

```
def human_readable(t):
    if t <= 100:
        print t, "seconds"
        return
    d = t//(24*60*60)
    h = (t-d*24*60*60)//(60*60)
    m = t%(60*60)//60
    s = t%60
    o=""
    if d >= 2:
        o += str(d)+" days "
    if d == 1:
        o += "1 day "
    if h >= 2:
        o += str(h)+" hours "
    if h == 1:
        o += "1 hour "
    if m >= 2:
        o += str(m)+" minutes "
    if m == 1:
        o += "1 minute "
    if s >= 2:
        o += str(s)+" seconds "
    if s == 1:
        o += "1 second "
    o += "("+str(t)+" seconds)"
    print o
```

For sure there are smarter way to do this. But first, what is "right" way to show time here?
