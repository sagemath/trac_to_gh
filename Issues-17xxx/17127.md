After longer calculation instead of "CPU time: 12345.67 s" it would be nice to have "CPU time: 3:25:45 (12345.67 s)" or something similar.

?? Just run sage, run `notebook()` (at least on my machines it does not use ipython interface as default, but good old sagenb) and run any computation that takes few hours.

Here is one suggestion for timeit format:

```
def human_readable(t):
    if t <= 100:
        print t, "seconds"
        return
    d = t//(24*60*60)
    h = (t-d*24*60*60)//(60*60)
    m = t%(60*60)//60
    s = t%60
    o=""
    if d >= 2:
        o += str(d)+" days "
    if d == 1:
        o += "1 day "
    if h >= 2:
        o += str(h)+" hours "
    if h == 1:
        o += "1 hour "
    if m >= 2:
        o += str(m)+" minutes "
    if m == 1:
        o += "1 minute "
    if s >= 2:
        o += str(s)+" seconds "
    if s == 1:
        o += "1 second "
    o += "("+str(t)+" seconds)"
    print o
```

For sure there are smarter way to do this. But first, what is "right" way to show time here?
