This is an easy beginner ticket.  This should work but doesn't

```
var1 = var('var1', latex_name=r'\sigma^2_1')  # braces shouldn't be needed, but are
show(e^(var1**2))
```

This does work

```
var1 = var('var1', latex_name=r'{\sigma^2_1}')  # braces shouldn't be needed, but are
show(e^(var1**2))
```

The fix is to wrap the input of latex_name in braces always.  In SageMathCloud I just made that fix already.

The change breaks 2 doctests in sage.calculus.var.var. One doctest complains

```
File "src/sage/calculus/var.pyx", line 73, in sage.calculus.var.var
Failed example:
    x = var('sui', latex_name="s_{u,i}"); x._latex_()
Expected:

Got:
    '{s_{u,i}}'
```
