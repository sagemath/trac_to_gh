See #9805, where we raised a warning.  It turns out that this can be done with a very minimal fix inside of Sage itself.  There is a symbolic link to `DATA` in each cell's temporary compute directory.

Let me rephrase then: given that `DATA` doesn't work for me, I never used it, so I don't know how it is supposed to work. Therefore, it is hard for me to review. And there is of course my subjective feeling that reviewing a small fix to a broken feature is pointless...

No, this is actually easy to test and really has nothing to do with `DATA`.  And it's something a user definitely will want, it's not really that small of a bug, although the fix is very small.

Before, if a user in the (for the sake of argument, assume single-user via `sage -n`) notebook wanted to save a session

```
save_session('foo')
<boom>
```
The workaround was to tell the user exactly where to store it, but that is dumb.  Now,

```
save_session('foo')
```
'just works' in the notebook.   This is orthogonal to the `DATA` issue, because there isn't any other place one *could* save the session that will automatically be visible to a given worksheet in any given cell one chooses to evaluate the loading from.

On the `save_session` side, you'll note that it already *does* save it there.  The problem is that this is **only accessible from that cell** unless they saved it to the filesystem in a known location (with full path, probably).  And, frankly, not every sagenb user is sophisticated enough to know what that means, and will just assume their file "is there".  Hence saving it somewhere universally accessible (in a given worksheet).  If one really had to, I guess if the path started with `/` one could decide not to save it in `data/`.

I think it is far more likely that someone would do

```
save_session('foo') # in cell xyz
<quit notebook, play frisbee, have lunch>
<open notebook again>
load_session('foo') # in some other cell, perhaps directly below xyz, with who knows what number
```
than that they will be asking for a specific filename on their computer.  And it's more convenient than having to remember some long path too - again, anyone who actually knows what they are doing will not have a problem with this anyway.  But I rarely assume users, or myself, know what they are doing.

I agree that one has to think about why the current code is there.  But given that the likely original author is the one who complained about it 'not working' in #9805, I am very reluctant not to consider this a bug!  And even William says there that the fix is just to figure out where `data/` lives.

Anyway, if you don't want to give it positive review and leave that to someone else, that's your prerogative, but I hope this clarifies why it's reasonable to try to deal with this in the current fashion.

I actually think the current situation with the message is better then: it *educates* the user about the fact that their file will not be universally accessible. It explains how to work around it (use `DATA`). This advice is useful in other situations besides `save_session()`.

In other words: I think it's better to *warn* the user that they might be doing stupid instead of guessing that they wanted to do something else. What if I really wanted to save it just in the current cell? With this branch, I cannot do that.

*That* is a good point, since you have identified such cases.  Would you think it would be better to have it not save to `DATA` silently, or give a message, or ... ?  It should still already save in the cell directory, as noted.

My point is that there should never be a default directory. I would say it's surprising to users if `save_session()` uses `data` but `save` doesn't use `data`.

In any case not silently.

Perhaps *that* is the part which should be reconsidered. If you find yourself in need of lots of work-arounds for a particular "feature", perhaps that "feature" was a bad idea...
