I created this ticket by typing "git trac create help". What I obviously wanted was help on the git trac create command. So, perhaps we could use this accident to make a special case for the ticket description argument: If it is just "help" then no ticket should be created, but help should be provided?

See also #16656, #16980, #17052, #18248, #18313, #18314, #19655 and the branch name of #17796.

To obtain help within git you do "git help CMD". If you do for example "git branch help" then it would create the branch help. This beahvior is very gitish.

One possible fix would be that by default, there is a confirmation step: "you are about to create a new ticket called XYZ on trac, please confirm [Yes/no].". This confirmation could be removed by adding something from the configuration files.

There are numerous duplicates, by construction of git. At least, with the latest version of git-trac, `git trac create -h` now shows help, rather than to create a ticket. So, I hope I will not accidentally create further tickets (no promise, though).
