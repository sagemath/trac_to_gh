I created this ticket by typing "git trac create help". What I obviously wanted was help on the git trac create command. So, perhaps we could use this accident to make a special case for the ticket description argument: If it is just "help" then no ticket should be created, but help should be provided?

There are numerous duplicates, by construction of git. At least, with the latest version of git-trac, `git trac create -h` now shows help, rather than to create a ticket. So, I hope I will not accidentally create further tickets (no promise, though).
