This seems like it should be an easy special case `if self == foo` right before we raise the `NotImplementedError`.

A few examples:

```
sage: QQbar.is_subring(QQbar)
...
NotImplementedError
```

```
sage: RR.is_subring(RR)
...
NotImplementedError
```

```
sage: CC.is_subring(CC)
...
NotImplementedError
```

```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^3-x+1/10)
sage: K.is_ring()
True
sage: K.is_subring(K)
...
NotImplementedError
```

```
sage: R.<x> = RR[]
sage: R
Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Real Field with 53 bits of precision
sage: R.is_ring()
True
sage: R.is_subring(R)
...
NotImplementedError
```

So far so good! Whenever we fix a bug in sage, we like to add some tests to make sure that the bug is really fixed and won't come back again. In the description of this ticket, I found a few examples that used to fail but which now work. Can you add tests for those?

You can see what a test looks like by looking at the commented code right above your fix:

```
EXAMPLES::

    sage: ZZ.is_subring(QQ)
    True
    sage: ZZ.is_subring(GF(19))
    False
```

I would suggest adding a new section called "TESTS" and placing the new tests there. The structure of our documentation strings is described in full at http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#documentation-strings. Here's what the first test would look like:

```
TESTS:

Every ring is a subring of itself, :trac:`17287`::

    sage: QQbar.is_subring(QQbar)
    True
```

The :trac: thing is a special sort of link to this ticket, described in http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/sage_manuals.html#chapter-sage-manuals-links. Then you can add the other examples from the description below that. When you're done adding them, don't forget to run `sage -b` to build the changes (even though you only changed a comment). Then you can run the tests for that file with `sage -t`. Like,

```
$ sage -t sage/rings/ring.pyx 
Running doctests with ID 2016-01-31-09-08-05-2b1b6a12.
Git branch: develop
Using --optional=mpir,python2,sage
Doctesting 1 file.
sage -t --warn-long 72.5 sage/rings/ring.pyx
    [387 tests, 4.63 s]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Total time for all tests: 4.9 seconds
    cpu time: 3.5 seconds
    cumulative wall time: 4.6 seconds
```

And it takes forever, but at least once, someone should run `make ptestlong` to test the entire sage library with the change in place.

Looks good, thanks! I have one more nitpick.

In the docstrings, the double-colons are used to indicate that "the thing after this is a test." So you will see,

```
EXAMPLES::

    sage: ZZ.is_subring(QQ)
    True
```

and

```

TESTS:

Blah blah blah::

    sage: x == x
    True
```

but in the second case, the "TESTS:" doesn't need two trailing colons.

Finally, these two lines can probably go:

```
sage: R
Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Real Field with 53 bits of precision
```

They don't really test anything useful. I think I included them in the description just to demonstrate that `R` is a ring.
