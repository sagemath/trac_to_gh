**Lots** of stuff has changed in Singular 4.
This is a big update.

Build system completely changed, and a lot of internal stuff.

Original upstream tarball at `www.mathematik.uni-kl.de/ftp/pub/Math/Singular/SOURCES/4-0-3/`:  `singular-4.0.3p3` **dot** `tar` **dot** `gz`

Modified tarball made with spkg-src at:
* http://www.lmona.de/files/sage/singular-4.0.3p3.tar.bz2

This corresponds to commit a070b84d whose message tells 4.0.3p3 and on which this branch was based:
* https://github.com/Singular/Sources/commit/a070b84d59be835a2946d1386edd3221d80f3fe7

You can also make your own tarball based on this commit or another one with

```
env SINGULAR_GIT_COMMIT=a070b84d ./sage --sh build/pkgs/singular/spkg-src
./sage --package fix-checksum singular
```
This script is loosely based on the `make_tar.sh` script from upstream.

I wonder if we even have a Sage developer who is familiar enough with Singular to do this (for the record: not me, I know nothing about Singular).

Of course, I'm not arguing with that.

Maybe Burcin would do...
IIRC the update was proposed as a GSoC project.

Could the update to 4.0.1. be done by at least two or three persons to spread the knownledge
about Singular internals?

You have to put a tarball repackaged by the `spkg-src` script in the `upstream` folder directly.
Once the ticket is merged, the tarball will be put on the official mirror and could be downloaded automatically but not at the moment.

I've put a repackaged tarball at:

Singular 4.0.1. compiles now in sage but sage does not yet -
I just pushed a branch 'u/jakobkroeker/ticket/17254'.
You have to correct the 'singular-4.0.1p1.tar.bz2' tarball to get it work ( the 'm4' folder is missing). 

For the moment I removed some patches; we probably will have to adjust them later on. For example there is meanwhile no such thing like 'lomalloc_ndebug' so if we want to disable some debug functionality or output for omalloc we have to do that by passing appropriate flags to omalloc/configure, e,g
'--enable-optimizationflags --disable-debug --without-debug' ?

Also I disabled the currently broken
'--enable-debugoutput' configure flag for the standalone 'factory'
and informed Oleksander Motsak about the issue.

Could someone of you take care of the sage compile errors and figure out what is going wrong and/or ask for help in the Singular forum? I can't do that easily, because within the Singular-team I'm out-of-favor because I constantly  criticise their software and thus I will likely get little or no support.

Confirm; cannot reproduce the issue.
So likely I didn't use the recent tarball, or I screwed something up.

I'm guilty ;-)

After a little more tweaking and temporarily disabling the extension fields/rings, 
I was able to build some parts of sage with Singular 4.0.1  on a 'fc18 system' and
then.. sage crashes at start! That happens because I didn't update ring creation right - I only  recently discovered examples at './libpolys/tests/rings_test.h'.  And some sage packages create common rings at loading time.

remaining riddles:
- during build one sage file tried to link to -lsingular (I have no idea why), instead to the   libSingular* files (that changed!), so I worked around by manually creating links to libSingular* files.

- on a ScientificLinux system I get errors like "ImportError: /home/kroeker/Projects/sage-singular-4.0.1/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/rings/polynomial/plural.so: undefined symbol: wFunctionalBuch". This symbol is in libSingular*

- fix ring creation. See examples at './libpolys/tests/rings_test.h'

- the extension fields will need some more love. See 'algext.h' and 'transext.h'. @mantepse: could you take a look?

- some mapping functions (e.g. nr2mMapZp) now require a source and dst (coefficient) parameter. Not sure if I did it right (source: currentRing, dest: _ring or vice versa?)

- I didn't fix unused interface definitions in singular-cdefs.pxi. TODO
 
See branch u/jakobkroeker/ticket/17254
and some notes at https://github.com/jakobkroeker/jk_test_sage/issues/13

If a build get stuck before errors described above, then maybe a 'make distclean' is necessary.
And of course, the Singular tarball http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/spkg/singular-4.0.1p1.tar.bz2 is required.


Any help appreciated.

I'm busy and can't work on the ticket currently and expect to have time for the ticket at end of June,
not earlier...

with the state as is, sage should build and start (using the Singular tarball from above), but extension fields and transcendental fields are not functional yet and also a cython Singular-interface cleanup has to be done.

I'm at SD64.25 and am willing to work on this, but I'll need some hand-holding since I haven't worked on a package like this before. Do you have any suggestions for ways to test extension and transcendental fields?

Shortly after, that installation of Sage fell completely apart (not sure why) so now I'm working on Sage-6.7.

On 6.7, git identifies some issues with merging in singular.pyx and ring.pyx, but they're fairly clear to fix, so I did. (Unless they *weren't* easy.) Things went much further this time, until I encountered this error:

```

Indeed, I do not find `run.c` in `local/var/tmp/sage/build/singular-4.0.1p1.p0/src/latest/Singular/`, which I am guessing is where this is supposed to be; instead, I find only run.h.

In my local distribution of Singular, I find a `run.c`. If I copy it over & try to make, I get the same complaint, & it looks as if the file is actually deleted. Suggestions?

It is expected for that directory not to exist for you. Whoever wrote the patch was working in a folder named `latest` but it is their own naming. It doesn't matter anyway. Let me explain to you how the `-p` option of patch works. 

Your patch has a header that helps you locate the file to patch:

```
--- latest/Singular/run.c       2014-11-19 14:06:05.000000000 +0100
+++ latest/Singular/run.c       2015-01-16 09:32:45.771298300 +0100
```
`patch < mypatch.patch` or equivalently `patch -p0< mypatch.patch` will look for the file
`latest/Singular/run.c` relative to where patch is executed. `-pN` will strip the `N` first folders in front of the file name so 

`patch -p1< mypatch.patch` will look for `Singular/run.c`. In `spkg-install` for singular, patches are applied with `patch -p1 <"$patch"` so you shouldn't care about `latest` it is discarded. Look for `local/var/tmp/sage/build/singular-4.0.1p1.p0/src/Singular/run.c` OK?

Why not? That directory *does* exist for me. The problem is that the *file* `run.c` does not exist *in* it.

There is no such directory. I can get to `local/var/tmp/sage/build/singular-4.0.1p1.p0/src/` but the only directories in there are `latest` and `shared`.

`is_64_bit` is deprecated. In Cython, check `sizeof(the_type_that_you_care_about)` instead.

Do not use `sys.maxsize`, that's much slower.

It's now certain that this, too, was caused by the failure to install `Singular` because `singular` exists in the directory (what can I say, it's a Mac). Removing that link and reinstalling the spkg fixed all these problems. 

**Meanwhile**, I discovered some memory-related bugs in the patch. For instance, ring.pyx has the line

```
assert( exponent == base_ring.degree() )
```
which causes a failure. I'm not sure why those should be equal (the test I used had `Zmod(2^3)` where `exponent==3` and `base_ring.degree()==1`), but commenting it out leads to a failure on these lines:

```
_param.GFChar     = ch;
_param.GFDegree   = base_ring.degree();
_param.GFPar_name = omStrDup(base_ring.gen());   
```
because `_param` has not been initialized. Adding

```
_param = <GFInfo *>omAlloc(sizeof(GFInfo));
```
**before** the access gives me a ring. However,

1. I'm not sure whether `omAlloc` or one of the other `omAlloc*` commands is more appropriate (e.g., `omAlloc0`). Anyone know?
2. I suppose this has to be freed somewhere... I know there's an obvious-sounding place, so I'll find it.

There are other places this change has to occur. One more question:

* A few lines before the ones I cited above is the test for 64-bits. I've switched to jdemeyer's test (`sizeof(long)>4`). However, the code in the patch is exactly the same for both 32- and 64-bit. Is there a recommendation for what to do here? I'm not sufficiently familiar with this to know what to do.

To wit, the source code for `base_ring.degree()` is, in total,

```
    def degree(self):
        """
        Return 1.

        EXAMPLE::

            sage: R = Integers(12345678900)
            sage: R.degree()
            1
        """
        return integer.Integer(1)
```
I don't know what is meant by the degree of a ring here, so I'll need guidance. For now I've commented it out.

That is unfortunate. 
@jdemeyer/@jpflori: could you upload the singular 4.0.1.p1 tarball to somewhere else?

>naive rebase. [by chapoton]
>Conflicts:
>	src/sage/libs/singular/singular-cdefs.pxi


the file `src/sage/libs/singular/singular-cdefs.pxi` is even missing in the ticket branch
`public/ticket/17254` 

@fchapoton
Did you set the ticket branch to broken `public/ticket/17254` instead of leaving it 
'`u/john_perry/ticket.17254.squashed`' by accident?

The build may fail with 'undefined ..' error again.
Probably this can be fixed with `./sage -ba`; 
if not, `make distclean`-bazooka should work...

except for the issue with `src/sage/libs/singular/singular-cdefs.pxi`, how did you do the rebase? 
Did you a rebase by hand, or did you create a patch after merge and then apply the patch to 6.9.b0?

`@`john_perry
thanks for the bugfix!


> I am willing to work on this


somehow I overlooked your messages in my emails in the past.Are you still available for help? 
Maybe we could work together on the remaining issues? (skype?)

An example of creating extension fields can be found in Singulars
`libpolys/tests/polys_test.h :: test_Q_Ext_a()`)
while the basic data structure idea is sketched in 
`libpolys/polys/ext_fields/algext.h`

@malb

while upgrading to Singular 4 I'm currently hit a segfault in Singular for 

```
sage: x = var('x')
sage: K.<z> = QQ.extension(x^2 + 1)
sage: P.<v,w> = K[]
sage: P._singular_() 
sage: P(1) # crash
```

Since I neither familiar enough with the sage interface to Singular nor 
with Singular internals, I'm currently stuck. Could you take a look?

So far, I have no luck even building this. Did you see this before:

```
ImportError: …/sage-review/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/matrix/matrix_mpolynomial_dense.so: undefined symbol: _Z17initCanonicalFormv
```

Yes. These are clearly artifacts from singular 3.1.7.
In Singular 4  is no 'initCanonicalForm'. 

Either this is a caching issue, incorrect dependency issue(in sage/cython)
or somewhere are files from 3.1.7 left. 
On which OS do you build singular( See also comment 55 )?
Did you try 'make distclean'? ( If you have a better solution for this, please share it)

Do you know in detail what happens or should happen in sage for 

```
sage: P.<v,w> = K[]
sage: P(1) 
```

behind the scenes? 
With that information we could ask Singular's developers if we use `libSingular` correctly.

Indeed. With printouts I tracked down the issue to ring creation in 
`src/sage/libs/singular/ring.pyx`
I guess that I incorrectly assembly the minpoly in ring construction
(omalloc magic or whatever)
Or there is an issue with the `AlgExtInfo` declaration or in `nInitChar()` call.

Could you take a look or even fix it?
See the corresponding Singular example `test_Q_Ext_a()` in 
`latest/libpolys/tests/polys_test.h`

I looked a little bit into the problem and from what I see when the multivariate gets created the first thing done is to create the number field in Singular.
Just after the number field creation, the first memory error Singular complains about is related to the polynomial defining the number field, so I would say the number field creation already went wrong (or the number field is wrongly used once created).

> I still get a bunch of crashes/errors when testing sage/libs/singular, working on it.


I was able to fix the issue with `naSetMap()` and `nlInit2gmp()` usage in `sa2si_NF()`)
and this reduces the number of segfaults significantly
The example 

```
sage: x = var('x')
sage: K.<z> = QQ.extension(x^2 + 1)
sage: P.<v,w> = K[]
sage: P._singular_() 
sage: P(2/3) 
```
does not crash any more!

A remaining task is to reuse the plain polynomial ring `qqr = QQ['x']` over Q in 
`sa2si_NF()` instead of rebuilding it everytime. (variable name is irrelevant)


.
.
Next interesting riddle in `sa2si_ZZmod()`; simple failing example:

```
sage: sage: R.<a> = Zmod(5)['a', 'b']  
sage: R(1) #crash
```

And indeed during ring creation the former is caught at the beginning of the method in `sage/libs/singular/ring.pyx` as `field`, `finite` and `prime` whereas the latter is caught as `integer_mod_ring`.

Ok the issue is indeed a mix between `Zmod` and `GF`.
The ring was initially created in singular as a "finite field" but then for some reason the conversion is made as for a "modular integer".
The former one uses `int`s whereas the second one uses `mpz`s.

I rebased the branch (as best as I could), and I did get an error with letterplace:

```
sage: F.<x> = FreeAlgebra(ZZ, implementation='letterplace')

I am also getting a variety of failures in testing the `rings/polynomial` folder, but most of them seem to be related to constructing ideals. I haven't run tests elsewhere.

> Problem with letterplace algebra:
> 
> ```

> sage: x**2

when I compile the recent 'u/jpflori/ticket/17254' or 'u/tscrim/upgrade_singular-17254' with SAGE_DEBUG=yes on my 32 bit fedora22

```
  export SAGE_DEBUG=yes
  ./sage -f singular
```
I get an printout from Singular:

```
  pmLPshift: too big shift requested
```

the corresponding Singular source snippet is (look at 'shiftgb.cc')

```
 if (L+sh-1 > uptodeg)
  {
#ifdef PDEBUG
    PrintS("pmLPshift: too big shift requested\n");
#endif
    return(NULL); /* violation, 2check */
  }
```
This seems to be a bug, but the next question is, why do we get there and is this 
an error caused by a previous one or not.

`@`jpflori

when using 'r.pLDeg()' instead of 'p_Deg()' in 'singular_polynomial_deg()'  (src/sage/libs/singular/polynomial.pyx)


some test from above pass, for example:

```
./sage -t src/sage/schemes/affine/affine_point.py 
./sage -t src/sage/schemes/affine/affine_morphism.py 
./sage -t src/sage/rings/polynomial/pbori.pyx  
./sage -t  src/sage/rings/polynomial/infinite_polynomial_element.py
```
especially some segfaults disappear but then probably other passing tests get broken?

Which example did you have in mind when you changed 'r.pLDeg()' to 'p_Deg()' in 
'singular_polynomial_deg()'  (src/sage/libs/singular/polynomial.pyx)?

Maybe we should discuss with Hans his commit in case it breaks something

The `plDeg` function is a Singular internal function, made for ecart, and has some restrictions regarding the ordering it can be applied to (no negative weights or things like that).
It gets constructed by Singular at initialization of the object from `p_Deg`.

What we want in Sage is the "usual" degree which is `p_Deg`.

Maybe the doctests were just wrong, i have no idea.

fixed some more issues.

A rebase on recent develop branch was too hard for me so I squashed everything in a new commit.

@jdemeyer I had to revert some of your changes in `src/module_list.py` 
(removing singular from include path)
because I failed to do the same for Singular 4.

No idea how that happened, but this is a fact.

also floats are now put in braces,
maybe because otherwise parsing the string '1.7E+30*5' in Singular would be wronng or fail? (just guessing)

so removing the following hack

will result in a lot of failing doctests...

At least we should understand the reasons 
- for ` 1*x `
- and for braces around floats 

I do not know whether it is safe to remove the `1*` and the braces around floats.
I don't know what Sage does for example with `_repr_()`, (which calls `singular_polynomial_str()` which in turn calls `p_String`

And if it' safe, how we should do that? 
regexping each polynomial string on the fly?

added debug printouts in

```

for the example

```
sage: F.<x> = FreeAlgebra(ZZ, implementation='letterplace')
sage: x**2
```
in `free_algebra_element_letterplace.pyx`, `__pow__()` routine
after copying the polynomial from one ring to another (with `prCopyR`) something seems broken
(look at the polynomial degree!)

and for the 

```
sage: A.<x> = AffineSpace(GF(3^2, 't'), 1) ## line 299 ##
Ideal(x).weil_restriction()
```

after the `subs()`  command in the `weil_restriction()`-Routine something is screwed up
(look at the polynomial degree!)

`@`jpflori

`@`jpflori

Singulars degree function calls `pLDeg` and not `p_Deg`, 
(grep for '`jjDEG`' in Singular sources), so we should do the same/similar by default.
one of the reasons: `p_Deg` seems returning garbage for lexicographic orderings
(see comment 195)


Question: is the behaviour described in the documentation of the 'degree' function in sage 

```
Note that a matrix term ordering alters the grading of the generators
          of the ring; see the tests below.  To avoid this behavior, use either
          ``exponents()`` for the exponents themselves, or the optional
          argument ``std_grading=False``.
```

natural and is it what a user would expect? Then we could(?) fix it using a different appropriate call:

```
sage: sage: tord = TermOrder(matrix([3,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0]))
sage: sage: R.<x,y,z> = PolynomialRing(QQ,'x',3,order=tord)
sage: sage: (x^3*y+x*z^4).degree() # 9
('p_Totaldegree', 4)
('p_WTotaldegree', 9)
('p_WDegree', 9)
('pFDeg', 4)
('pLDeg', 5)
```

I bumped into this a long time ago. It shocked me then, but I adapted & now my code depends on it. If this is true of me, it is probably true of others.

This, for example, is from Sage 6.7:

```
sage: T = TermOrder(matrix(3,3,[1,2,3,3,4,5,0,0,1]))
sage: R.<x,y,z> = PolynomialRing(QQ,'x',3,order=T)
sage: y.degree()
2
sage: version()
'SageMath Version 6.7, Release Date: 2015-05-17'
```
So IMHO we should mimic Singular for compatibility reasons (i.e., we're mimicking Sage itself).

As the person who introduced the matrix term ordering into Sage, I think that it was just due to the Singular behavior that a matrix term ordering changes the grading of the generators according to the first row of the matrix in Sage. It shocked everyone including John, and was regarded as a bug. So if we can make the grading and the matrix term ordering independent, switching to Singular 4, then I would be happy. Of course it should go with an appropriate deprecation warning.

Currently I implemented `singular_polynomial_deg` as follows
to mimic its behaviour as it was with Singular 3.1.7(and older)

```
    ...
    cdef long _deg, deg
    
    deg = -1
    _deg = -1 
    if x == NULL:
        while p:  
            _deg = p_WTotaldegree(p,r)
          
            if _deg > deg:
                deg = _deg
            p = pNext(p)

        return deg
    ...
```

The degree-related tests seem to pass now.

Remakr: pDeg() seems not usable/has different behaviour; see 
https://groups.google.com/forum/?_escaped_fragment_=topic/libsingular-devel/dulzKFTF3g8#!topic/libsingular-devel/dulzKFTF3g8 for details.

Further changes: added some missing rComplete() calls (
otherwise prCopyR cannot be used, for instance, see https://groups.google.com/forum/?_escaped_fragment_=topic/libsingular-devel/4JRHxVXIF70#!topic/libsingular-devel/4JRHxVXIF70 )

I've removed a bunch of very old hackish stuff in `spkg-install`, especially regarding Solaris and sparc.
Maybe too much, but the Singular build system changed so much and it does not seem we have real support for such systems anymore that we should only reintroduce removed hacks if found that are still needed.

It also seems this upgrade to git version rebroke some stuff...

In particular, in `function.pyx`, in `__init__` after calling

```
        if currRingHdl == NULL:
            currRingHdl = ggetid("my_awesome_sage_ring")

            currRingHdl.data.uring.ref += 1
```
the last line segfaults because:

```
(gdb) print currRingHdl.data
$2 = {
  i = 0, 
  uring = 0x0, 
  p = 0x0, 
  n = 0x0,

  bim = 0x0, 
  l = 0x0, 
  li = 0x0, 
  pack = 0x0, 
  pinf = 0x0
}
```

I guess some additional funciton should be used to initialize properly `currRingHdl`.

So everyone's always using the *latest* git version in `spkg-src`?

FWIW, `sed -i` isn't portable, e.g. won't work on Oraclis.

`SPKG.txt` now says "Patches: None" whereas there is `upgrade.patch`.

Sure!
Hopefully it should be 4.1 upstream version though I don't know when it's planned.
4.0.3p1 seems to be a poorer choice as a bunch of bugs reported here where fixed in Singular after that release and the fixes would have to be backported...

I was just about to ask you that, as there are many recent commits mentioning 4.1.

I'll probably add something to `spkg-src` regarding checkout and `autogen.sh` / `make_tar.sh` unless you're going to as well.

I would say the `spielwiese` branch on github is the real master one.
As you can see, the following commit:

The singular related ones seem to be:
* schemes/elliptic_curves/isogeny_small_degree.py: segfault.
* modular/modform_hecketriangle/graded_ring_element.py: lots of singular stuff, including coercion.
* schemes/projective/projective_morphism.py: not sure... something about mpfr!
* arith/misc.py: representation of finite fields changed, easy to fix.
* structure/element.pyx: new limitation in max exponent?
* tests/french_book/mpoly.py: different result, might be just as good as the previous one.
* rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_ideal.py: some different results, surely just as good and even better
* interfaces/singular.py: different Singular printing.
* rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_libsingular.pyx: printing and squarefree stuff.
* schemes/affine/affine_rational_point.py: bad abort.
* src/sage/libs/singular/function.pyx: hopefully mostly random values changed in internal singular functions.
* rings/multi_power_series_ring_element.py: printing of power series changed.
* rings/polynomial/polynomial_singular_interface.py: printing changed.
* rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_ideal_libsingular.pyx: different result, might be just as good.

Kind of painfuly got it:
* nlNormalize(x) can free whatever is in x and change x from a struct to a disqguised int.
* when calling sa2si on a polynomial we call nlGetDenom or such functions on pointers returned by p_GetCoeff for the coeffs, which in turn call nlNormalize and free the underlying memory and modify our pointer, but not the original pointers in the polynomial
* we call p_Delete on the polynomial which call nlDelete on the coeff which gives no indication the underlying memory is freed
* bang

We're almost good now:
* the "skipping text from `parameter`" text only appears when an error previously happened in Singular, so we it now only appears when testing `libs/singular/function.pyx` becasuse of the `GTZmod` error.
* hopefully the `GTZmod` error will be fixed upstream soon and we can fix a commit to incule here (which should be more or less official Singular `4.0.3`).

Can someone else please test the current branch?
You'll need to build your own tarball first using `spkg-src`.

(There will still be some polishing to do about the Singular C++ function we use, see the comments Hans added in some header files, but that can wait for another ticket.)

Setting `SAGE_DEBUG=yes`, debug mode with `xalloc` should be ok although:
* I did not wait for the build to finish,
* it seems auto* wants to reconfigure everything,
* you get a alot of unsued stuff warnings but that's surely normal.

I removed a bunch of hacks from `spkg-install`.

Please test!

I don't follow the ticket very closely, but that makes me jump: what about taking an upstream tarball instead of hacking something?

Minor thing:  All error messages in `spkg-install` should start with `"Error`[`:`]` ..."`.

`spkg-src` could be beautified a bit as well (e.g. not unconditionally deleting `singular.git`, and recording what we checked out, error checking), besides that `curl` is non-standard... ;-)

I did make the tarball using `spkg-src`, as described.
I guess it's an upstream bug: they don't detect presence of aclocal-1.14, even though they don't need it, and bail out, even though it's meant to be a warning. 

Any, why `1.14` only? Won't they be happy with `1.14` or newer?

             sage: f= x^2 + 2*x*y + 1/2*z

Asking whether a multivariate polynomial is squarefree seems like a very natural thing to do and not something you should just break.

Another example:

```
    libSingularFound = False

    for extension in ["so", "dylib", "dll"]:
        lib = os.environ['SAGE_LOCAL']+"/lib/libSingular."+extension # libsingular renamed to libSingular
        if os.path.exists(lib):
            libSingularFound = True
            handle = dlopen(lib, RTLD_GLOBAL|RTLD_LAZY)
            if not handle:
                err = dlerror()
                if err:
                    print(err)
            break

    if not libSingularFound :
        raise OSError("did not find libsingular file")


    if handle == NULL:
        dlerrormsg = dlerror()
        if dlerrormsg == NULL:
            dlerrormsg = ""
        raise ImportError("failed to dlopen {} ({})".format(lib, dlerrormsg))
```

The `handle == NULL` cannot be reached since we would error out before. The old code is simpler and better:

```
    for extension in ["so", "dylib", "dll"]:
        lib = os.environ['SAGE_LOCAL']+"/lib/libsingular."+extension
        if os.path.exists(lib):
            handle = dlopen(lib, RTLD_GLOBAL|RTLD_LAZY)
            if not handle:
                err = dlerror()
                if err:
                    print(err)
            break

    if handle == NULL:
        raise ImportError("cannot load libSINGULAR library")
```

There was no reason to make the code more complicated, why was it done???

surely Singular 4.0.3 still has the squarefree test, so it's matter of digging up how it is implemented:

```
> ring r=0,(x,y),dp;
> poly p=x^2+2*x*y+y^2;
>> ring r=0,(x,y),dp;
> poly p=x^2+2*x*y+y^2;
> sqrfree(p);
[1]:
   _[1]=1
   _[2]=x+y
[2]:
   1,2
```

``


> Revert simpler old code to load Singular


I disagree. 


Please read my arguments first and reply to the arguments (or disprove them). `@`Jeroen, If it was your code I changed and it hurts you. I'm sorry for that. Still, try to understand the arguments for the change and accept the change if you agree with the arguments.


The old (and current) failing message is 

```
raise ImportError("cannot load libSINGULAR library")
```

In some situations this message gives no clue about the error caused a failing and even worse, is misleading:

The issue I ran into was while working on this upgrade, the loading of libSINGULAR failed, but I could for hours not figure out the cause. The library file was there,
I was able to open it manually. The error message did mislead my thoughts in the wrong direction. The issue was that Singular changed the naming of `'libsingular.so'` to `'libSingular.so' ` (did you note the difference? ('s' vs 'S') and dlopen failed because sage tried to open a non-existing file!

Also, if we reach 

```
if handle == NULL
```

it is legitimate to print for _which_ file we failed to dlopen, because we try several different extensions (`"so", "dylib", "dll"`) in a loop!  Otherwise, by just looking at the error message we would have NO CLUE, for _which_ file `dlopen` failed.  And they may exist all three of them in the same place.

> Remove print debug statement in singular lib


If I recall correctly, if Singular ring creation fails (with exception), 
there is a fallback creating a sage ring, (sage catches the exception,
and no exception is printed)

So my question is, how a developer should properly and easily detect, that 
Singular ring creation ended with an exception?

`spkg-src` just calls `autoreconf` which is the usual way to generate `configure` and `Makefile.in`.
Not sure why running `configure` or `make` decides to rerun `autotools`.
Maybe some timestamps issues after patching but we don't patch a lot, especially we do nothing to `configure` and `Makefile.in`, so...
And IIRC I had no trace of `autotools` getting rerun on my setup, except when using `SAGE_DEBUG=yes` (which was already strange enough).

It's fine to have `print` statement during development, but I would say it should not be there in "production" code.

> It's fine to have print statement during development, but I would say it should not be there in "production" code. 


Thats fine to remove the (outcommented) debug statements. 

My question is just about if there is a better way to detect a failed singular ring creation  than printouts?.

Sure, there are some comments in `spielwiese/libpolys/coeffs/coeffs.h`,
but then the reader has to investigate (how did _you_ find the `coeffs.h`?)

At least I would add in `decl.pxd` before the line `cdef enum n_coeffType:` something like 

```
# see libpolys/coeffs/coeffs.h for reference
```
What do you think?

Not that I did a better job, but do you agree, that several comments in `coeffs.h` related to  the `enum n_coeffType` are not really helpful? (=> we should improve them?)

I give up, I don't understand quite what's going on. There is a `missing` script in `build-aux/`
that is called on `aclocal-<VERSION>`, where `<VERSION>` is the autotools version the tarball is made with.
But I don't know why it is there and how to disable it.

Not quite sure, since I 'm not a Mac OS user, but it might be (or might be not) a problem on Mac OS. Are you familiar with Mac OS? 

If I recall correctly, on Mac OS we might have both (".so" and ".dylib") or only one of (".so" and ".dylib")? Is that true??

I don't care whose code it was. Probably not mine.

Improving an error message is very good, but I don't see why you needed to complicate the whole code structure for that.

It wasn't clear to me whether it was even possible to reach that line.

Anyway, this has been improved now (although the now-unused variables `dlerrormsg` and `libSingularFound` should still be removed).

I don't know whether it's related to `touch` applied, or not.

I can install the requested aclocal version and see whether without `touch` I get the same error...

Both exist for a different purpose. On OS X:

- `.dylib` = dynamic library (needed for the usual case of linking libraries at build-time).

- `.so` = loadable module (needed for run-time linking, for example Python extension modules).

On most other OSes, there is no difference between these.

Nope, I must have screwed up when removing the comments in the enumeration.

Thats not necessary, we cannot get away with only a `touch` anyway because of `xalloc`.
I'll rerun autoreconf on my side to get proper timestamps in all folders...

It might be that gcc is too old, it uses gcc version 4.8.4 (Ubuntu 4.8.4-2ubuntu1~14.04.3).

Should I rather build Sage's gcc?

I do touch stuff in `*/` too, not only in top level.
(probably `*` is an overkill, but it works).
 
Indeed, I first tried to touch the top level only, it went a bit further, entered `resources/`, and complained from there instead.

Ok reuploaded a new tarball (same address).
Please test.
Note that I finally did:
* use upstream 4.0.3p3
* autoreconf
* autoreconf in xalloc
* touch files

If I only autoreconfed xalloc, then libtool complained about different versions so I autoreconfed evrything then xalloc.
(Yes, I know I could build my own autotools to get matching versions but thats more time consuming.)

``` 

```

Nope, 
my changes were just reverted
and now Dima had fun with the issue  (see [comment_315](#comment%3A315) ):  

```
```

Dima faced the old error message ( see [comment_353](#comment%3A353) )

```
[dochtml] /home/dima/Sage/sage/local/bin/python: cannot load libSINGULAR library; 'sage_setup.docbuild' is a package and cannot be directly executed

```

He comments the error:

```
 No idea what it is and where it really comes from
```

Finally he was able to fix it ([comment_356](#comment%3A356) )

There's been some change to that file in 7.4.beta3, haven't checked yet where / whether it's related.

In `spkg-install`, there's no error checking done in `install_docs()` and `fix_includes()`, haven't touched these though.

Apparently not.  I'm getting the same with the branch *pulled into* Sage 7.4.beta3 (as opposed to fetching it, since it's based on beta2 with the Linbox upgrade manually merged in by Dima IIRC).

Presumably unrelated, with GCC 6.2:

        res

True.

I just thought it was more readable for a human being.
And was in line with the if clause.
But I might be wrong.

Well, it's more likely we add things to `OPTIMIZATION_FLAGS` than to / past `-O0`.

Got it: `omConfig.h` is needed at build time to define this...
So the easiest solution would be not to modify `xalloc/omalloc.h` and to ship `omConfig.h` jsut as `omalloc` does.
Can you modify `xalloc/configure.ac` by adding 

```
nodist_libomalloc_include_HEADERS = omConfig.h
```
then autoreconf and retest?

I can only see `dylib` around here. The only `.so` files are in `lib/python2.7` (and they would be `.bundle` if we were building python as a framework).

I have started working in earnest on a ebuild for sage-on-gentoo. I based on it on stuff in the maintree for 4.0.2. 

Anyway I believe that by default `--enable-gfanlib` is on. libgfan needs `cddlib` to be installed to build. Since `cddlib` is not currently a dependency of `singular`, but is a standard package, we could get different `singular` installs depending on build order.

Since `cddlib` is a standard package I propose we make it a dependency of `singular` - unless there are reasons to have `gfanlib` to be completely disabled.

P.S.: `cddlib` just depends on GMP/MPIR, which is built (nearly) first anyway, so adding the dependency wouldn't slow down anything either.

Indeed, but there is a `libgfan.so` installed (linking may need improvement, I'll look into that) and could be used directly instead of going through a pexpect interface. Of course functionality and performance are also a consideration.

well, AFAIK Macaulay2 uses an unpatched version of libfactory.
(more precisely they apply [this](https://github.com/Macaulay2/M2/blob/master/M2/libraries/factory/patch-4.0.2), but it's just documentation, right?)

I recently spent some time trying to resurrect M2 Sage package, so I'd prefer libfactory as it is now, a separate one.

I will look into this further. But rebuilding libfactory is a risk. I would be OK if libfactory was a separate package and singular and M2 would build on top of it but that's not what it looks like now.

Whatsoever we could still remove the former one as well.

Rebuilding `libfactory` as we do at the moment is nothing but redundant, so we can safely remove the step.

Two another minor(?) issues I could not solve due to lack of expertise in sage:

-reuse a plain polynomial ring over ZZ and 


-reuse Singular polynomial ring over QQ

instead of creating a new one every time,


see

```
src/sage/libs/singular/singular.pyx
```

**snip**

```
        # if I understand nrnMapGMP/nMapFuncPtr correctly we need first
+        # a source value in ZZr
+        # create ZZr, a plain polynomial ring over ZZ with one variable.
+        #
+        # todo (later): reuse ZZr
+        _name = omStrDup(varname)
+        _ext_names = <char**>omAlloc0(sizeof(char*))
+        _ext_names[0] = omStrDup(_name)
+        _cf = nInitChar( n_Z, NULL) # integer coefficient ring
+        ZZr = rDefault (_cf ,1, _ext_names)
+        rComplete(ZZr,1)
```

```

+    # the result of nlInit2gmp() is in a plain polynomial ring over QQ (not an extension ring!),
+    # so we hace to get/create one :

Yes, that helps, since this ticket doesn't build for me for some reason.

This looks to me like a change of coordinates (x to -x) at the first blow-up that is then carried through the rest of the stages. The connecting maps and the new curves are changed consistently so I see nothing incorrect about the new output, it is just a change of variables from the original blow-ups.

Hmmm, I didn't like

```sh
    # Lower case version is convenient (this can fail on
    # case-insensitive systems, we ignore the error).
    ln -sf Singular singular 2> /dev/null
```
from the beginning... ;-)

So this actually creates a symlink to itself on MacOS X.  Nice.

Just skip symlinking on Darwin?

Well, uppercase Singular is just as ugly and inconvenient as libSingular (and their dash-versions); we'd just have to make further changes like you did for the library name.

I personally don't care, but if it doesn't work on MacOS X while it's at the same time not necessary there either, why "disable" it for all other systems, having to make lots(?) of changes elsewhere?

To my surprise there was only one spot with a call to `singular` instead of `Singular` left. Someone has done some cleaning. I also added a small clean up I had hanging up for ages. `singular.py` and `singular.pyx` where the two last files where `SAGE_LOCAL` is obtained through `os.environ` rather than `sage/env.py`.

I meant the `yes no` (more results than `checking`; above you have to scroll to the right to see the third), which appears twice in cddlib context, and just noticed the `polymake-config` result.

(There are a few other instances where a result is shown without apparent matching `checking`.)

Ok, looking at the test (and the referenced Singular trac ticket), that's perhaps not too surprising, **of course** related to `pexpect`, and of course on MacOS X... 8-)

Can you reproduce the issue directly in Singular?  (I.e., that a previously defined variable "vanishes" after pressing Ctrl-C on a following, incomplete line.)

I'll need instruction as I am only familiar with `singular` syntax for a few hours every other year :P when some debugging like this one seems necessary.

And of course I won't be able to apply it before sometime after getting up - likely after I dealt with my backlog of official work.

You could also try running the test in verbose mode (I'm not sure if your Singular got restarted), and playing with the parameters in the test and `_send_interrupt()` (alarm delay, delay before sending `^C`, time waiting for a prompt, and the number of times Sage tries to get the prompt, resending `;`).

W.r.t. Singular syntax, compared to me you're presumably an expert. :-)

Otherwise commands have to be terminated with a `;` (newline alone isn't sufficient), variable definitions look like `def foo=42;`, `foo;` evaluates the expression / prints the value of `foo`.

Hopefully Jeroen has a suited MacOS X box to investigate...

OK, at least that one I think I can understand. A `-D...` is probably incorrect in `Singular.pc` or the whole build system, when you build it with debugging. I have fought for a long time with `-DNDEBUG` in singular 3 because I don't add it by default in sage-on-gentoo.

Hum.... building from scratch I didn't seem to encounter this problem here. Access to the failed build would be needed here.

OK, `omalloc.pc` is not produced with `SAGE_DEBUG=yes` and it didn't fail for me because the system one was eventually found (it is part of the require line in `Singular.pc`).

So this is a very real problem.

Nope, I prefered to produce a patch for the autotools input and output files and apply it just before configuring.
While we're at it, we could also update the `xalloc` patch part about `omConfig.h` to include upstream solution:
* https://github.com/Singular/Sources/commit/bebd5a0361ed499fa0769cad9424e1bb193acd7c

Can you also report the pkgconfig thing to upstream?

With GCC 4.8.5 and `SAGE_DEBUG=yes`, I'm getting quite a lot doctest errors (I don't get without):

```

```
README for xalloc: a debug helper and alternative to omalloc

- substitute in <topdir>/configure.ac and <topdir>/Makefile.am
   omalloc by xalloc
- in <topdir> run ./autogen.sh
- run <topdir>/configure .....   in <builddir>
- in <builddir> and <topdir>: save omalloc to omalloc.org, ln -s xalloc omalloc

So running autoconf before using `xalloc` is expected. Should we make a conditional patch to follow those instructions more closely. i.e. only apply the patch to configure{,.ac}/Makefile.{am,in} when DEBUG is enabled.

These instructions are buggy :)
It is enough to `cd` to the `xalloc` dir, then `autoreconf` and if you want debug mode, then you delete the `omalloc` dir and `mv xalloc omalloc`.

To only use patch on top of the upstream `4.0.3p3` what you need to do is to autoreconf everything on your machine on a pristine tree and on a patched one and produce the patch.
Then you ship the pristine tarball (or not so so pristine as we autoreconf it and indeed as you and I may use different autotools version the final autoreconfed dirs and patches may be different) and the patch to autotools input and output files. 
That's what I did before.
And even if we use different autotools version it's not that hard to pick up the useful part of the patches produced by `diff` by hand and remove all the crap only due to different autotools versions.

The man page of `fgets()` reports:

```
RETURN VALUE

       fgets() returns s on success, and NULL on error or when end of file occurs while no characters have been read.
```

This is the problem: an error condition (such as an interrupt) and an EOF both give a `NULL` result for `fgets()` and Singular confuses these.

Is it possible to change the upstream source in a way that we do not need an autoreconf for xalloc? For example, would it be sufficient to add 

```
AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS([xalloc])
```

to the `configure.ac` at upstream?

Whatever is required to get rid of repackaging/autoreconf, we should do that.

I'm sorry, but since this thread is read by some Singular interface experts, 
I would like to advertise the tickets #17696, #13999, #17697, #10708, #12529.
