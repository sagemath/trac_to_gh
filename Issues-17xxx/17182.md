I am working now on the move.

Should I use `set`, `Set` or `frozenset` ?

Okay.

`set` is fine. Never use `Set` for anything else than teaching purposes, and `frozenset` makes no sense here as you want to add elements to the set.

I have a problem with the empty graph, but I do not see what is wrong with my code.

Another question : do you think I should raise an exception for the empty graph ? Does it have one spanning tree or none ? I would go for none.

I have also corrected Graph().spanning_trees(), that was failing also. It now says that the empty graph has no spanning tree, which is coherent with spanning_trees_count.

Hello,

The doc did not compile. I fixed it. A reference was defined twice (once in `spanning_trees.pyx`, another time in the copy of that function as it is imported in `graph.py`).

The 'see also' should appear a bit earlier, especially when there is a 'test' section. Otherwise nobody sees it.

I flagged the spanning tree in the doctest as `#random`, because the vertex ordering can depend on the architecture.

If you agree with the commit I added, please set this ticket to `positive_review`
