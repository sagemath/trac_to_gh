As reported at #17205:

```
    sage: x, y = ZZ['x','y'].gens()
    sage: GF(1091)['x','y'].random_element().degree(x) ### works
    sage: GF(3037000453)['x','y'].random_element().degree(x) ### fails
```
The 2nd and 3rd lines are handled by different code, one from `multi_polynomial_libsingular.pyx` and one from `multi_polynomial_element.py`. The first tries to convert the argument `x` into the parent ring, but the second does not. 

The point here is to reconcile the approaches: always try to convert the argument into the parent ring.

Making this change in `multi_polynomial_libsingular.pyx` breaks a doctest which is supposed to test exactly this:

```
        The following example is inspired by trac 11652::

            sage: R.<p,q,t> = ZZ[]
            sage: poly = p+q^2+t^3
            sage: poly = poly.polynomial(t)[0]
            sage: poly
            q^2 + p

        There is no canonical coercion from ``R`` to the parent of ``poly``, so
        this doesn't work::

            sage: poly.degree(q)
            Traceback (most recent call last):
            ...
            TypeError: argument must canonically coerce to parent
```
At #11652, there was some debate about this, and the conclusion was that coercion was appropriate, not conversion. (In the above example, q obviously converts to an element of the parent of `poly`, but there is no coercion.)
