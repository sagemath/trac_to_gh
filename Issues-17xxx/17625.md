<a id='comment:5'></a>I'm deeply sorry Jeroen.
I was in the process of testing this but got some issues with my Cygwin 32 bits install, got quite in a rush when leaving Bordeaux and then went off the internet for one month.
This is one of my top priority Sage related things to do next week when I'll be back to my usual routine.
