Replying to [@vbraun](#comment%3A4):
> See "man vim".

Indeed, on my system, `man vim` states that

  The swap file is a file with the same file‚Äê name as the text  file  with  ".swp"  appended.

But the vim manual adds

   On Unix, a '.' is prepended to swap file names in the same directory as the edited file. 

and this is what I observe. Does sage work (with git and all) on any non-Unix-like sytem (typically Amiga, MSDOS, on native Win32)?
