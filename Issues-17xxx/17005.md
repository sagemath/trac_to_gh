<a id='comment:7'></a>OOpppps sorry Travis. I remember having it on my mind then forgot while I was doing the merge.

The weird thing is that this bug seems to be fixed in the latest release. A side effect of #17156 it seems.

Well, I will add the doctest here but it seems that all this patch does is some code cleaning `O_o`
