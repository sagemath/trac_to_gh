The examples contained in the coding theory tutorial were never tested because they began with "Sage :" instead of "sage:".

This is reformatted in #17616 but many doctests were broken and were flagged as "not tested". Somebody who understands coding theory should go over them and fix them properly.

Even the sentence
> Included in Sage is the group theory package GAP [GAP] and GUAVA [GUAVA], GAP’s coding theory package. All of GUAVA’s functions can be accessed within Sage.

is wrong, as GUAVA is optional, part of `gap_packages`.

Depends on #17616

It appears now "codes." must be preappended: for example,

```
C = ToricCode([[0,0],[1,0],[2,0],[0,1],[1,1]],GF(7))
```
becomes

```
C = codes.ToricCode([[0,0],[1,0],[2,0],[0,1],[1,1]],GF(7))

True. I believe that #17616 already does that wherever it is needed, though.

Indeed.

All of these were fixed when I completely rewrote this tutorial in #19897. 

I don't exactly know what to do in that case though. I know you can set a ticket as closed/invalid/wontfix which it more or less the case here, but I don't know how to do that.

Yes, like this. It was under "milestones", of course...

Anyway, I'm giving a positive review to this closed/invalid/wontfix as the bugs described in this ticket does not exist anymore.
