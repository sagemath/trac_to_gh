Right now, there is no `Zmod(k).is_unique_factorization_domain()` method, while one can test these rings for being field, integral domain, ... The same holds for polynomial rings.

This is motivated by ticket #15790 in which `is_unique_factorization_domain()' is used.

`Zmod` is in the category of `Rings` by default because we don't want to do the prime check. However, if we do do the check, then we want `Zmod` to be in the category of `Fields` if applicable. You can see this by:

```
sage: R = Zmod(5)
sage: R.category()
Join of Category of finite commutative rings and Category of subquotients of monoids and Category of quotients of semigroups
sage: R.is_field()
True
sage: R.category()
Join of Category of finite fields and Category of subquotients of monoids and Category of quotients of semigroups
```
Moreover you get extra methods and/or shortcuts (like `lcm` on elements).

Do you mind making the change Bruno?
