Reinstalling sagenb sometimes eats up all of my RAM (32GB) in `easy_install`:

```
$ sage -f sagenb
[...]
Installed /home/vbraun/Code/sage.git/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/Flask_OldSessions-0.10-py2.7.egg
Processing dependencies for Flask-OldSessions==0.10
Finished processing dependencies for Flask-OldSessions==0.10
Processing webassets-0.10.1.tar.gz
Writing /tmp/easy_install-Mdk_hB/webassets-0.10.1/setup.cfg
Running webassets-0.10.1/setup.py -q bdist_egg --dist-dir /tmp/easy_install-Mdk_hB/webassets-0.10.1/egg-dist-tmp-gmyi_v
```
Unless I kill the process quickly this makes for a very unresponsive system...

Although webassets should be removed as we don't use it (#16736), the underlying problem is probably that we use the dying `easy_install` instead of pip.
