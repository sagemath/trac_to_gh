Reinstalling sagenb sometimes eats up all of my RAM (32GB) in `easy_install`:

```
$ sage -f sagenb
[...]
Installed /home/vbraun/Code/sage.git/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/Flask_OldSessions-0.10-py2.7.egg
Processing dependencies for Flask-OldSessions==0.10
Finished processing dependencies for Flask-OldSessions==0.10
Processing webassets-0.10.1.tar.gz
Writing /tmp/easy_install-Mdk_hB/webassets-0.10.1/setup.cfg
Running webassets-0.10.1/setup.py -q bdist_egg --dist-dir /tmp/easy_install-Mdk_hB/webassets-0.10.1/egg-dist-tmp-gmyi_v
```
Unless I kill the process quickly this makes for a very unresponsive system...

Although webassets should be removed as we don't use it (#16736), the underlying problem is probably that we use the dying `easy_install` instead of pip.

The flat install (no egg) is a feature imho... the whole packing into an egg and then unpacking it again when you need something from it is crazy.

Pip has a switch for force-reinstalling but then it'll also want to force-reinstall the Jinja2 dependency. We should just move the packages out of the sagenb tarball, and install sagenb without deps... I've added a step to delete the old sagenb, that at least will ensure that it is reinstalled (though not the dependencies inside the sagenb tarball).

I'm not complaining about this, just saying that the `cd` statement should be updated (like you did).

Please rebase to 6.6.rc0 (there is a conflict)
