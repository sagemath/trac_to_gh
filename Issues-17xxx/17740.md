sage: cm.bin_op(GF(5)['x'].gen(), 7, operator.div).parent()
Fraction Field of Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Finite Field of size 5

The problem is that we are not finding the inverse because we are passing to the fraction field of ZZ before coercing to GF(5).

Can we also address here why asking the coercion system to do this operation does not lead to the same result as when we just do the computation?

```
sage: parent(GF(5)['x'].gen()/7)
Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Finite Field of size 5
```
There may be good reasons for this (performance?) so I'm not immediately suggesting that we change the code to use the same path in both cases, but we should document that and why we're not.

My main concern is that your solution ignore iteration

```
sage: cm.get_action(GF(5)['x']['y'], ZZ, operator.div)
Right inverse action by Fraction Field of Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Finite Field of size 5 on Univariate Polynomial Ring in y over Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Finite Field of size 5
with precomposition on right by Composite map:
  From: Integer Ring
  To:   Fraction Field of Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Finite Field of size 5
  Defn:   Natural morphism:
          From: Integer Ring
          To:   Finite Field of size 5
        then
          Polynomial base injection morphism:
          From: Finite Field of size 5
          To:   Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Finite Field of size 5
        then
          Ring Coercion morphism:
          From: Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Finite Field of size 5
          To:   Fraction Field of Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Finite Field of size 5
```

I think that `GF(5)['x,y']` and `GF(5)['x']['y']` should behave similarly.

I used to be very against partial coercions like QQ -> GF(p), but I'm not as sure anymore.

<a id='comment:10'>Comment 10:</a>
I wrote trivial commits while I was reading the code. One thing to mention: in the documentation you should use <code>:trac:\`17440\`</code> instead of `#17440`.

One last question: in `coerce.pyx`, you wrote

```
try:
    return ~right_mul
except TypeError: # action may not be invertible
    self._record_exception()
```
Shouldn't we catch only `CoercionException`?

The problematic line is `module_action = type(self)(K, self.codomain())` in `coerce_action.pyx`

```
sage: dP6 = toric_varieties.dP6()
sage: Dx,Du,Dy,Dv,Dz,Dw = dP6.toric_divisor_group().gens()
sage: A = RightModuleAction(ZZ, Dx.parent())
sage: ~A

    474             connecting = K.coerce_map_from(self.G)
...
CoercionException: No common base

Hi Robert,

There was only a trivial conflict in `sage/rings/ring.pyx`. I did merge with sage-6.6.beta0 in my last commit. I let you set the positive review if this is fine.
