With this branch, one can compute the bandwidth of a graph.

If anybody knows another implementation of that for comparisons, I am interested `:-P`

This is impressive!
I haven't tested yet the patch, but I already have few comments:

- With the instruction `G = G.relabel(inplace=False) # int-labelled` you loose the original labels of the vertices. You should either store the original label to return an ordering with original names, or write in the doc of the method that the ordering is a permutation of the vertices according the original ordering in the graph, or what is best to write.
- in the `if (d is NULL or distances is NULL or ...` you should add a `return blah blah`.

Now I'm trying to figure out the worse case time complexity of your algorithm, and of course if it is exact ;)

More later.

Yo !

Fixed.

Fixed.

Yes I saw it while coding. Actually I wanted to add a "bandwidth" function to the matrix code, just to make my "assert" cleaner at the end of this branch, but I did not know in which of matrix0.pyx, matrix1.pyx or matrix2.pyx it should be stored, and because it was a one-line function I gave that up. By the way, the code at #13565 is not very good as it will copy all cells of the matrix (calls to `.diagonal()`).

> Now I'm trying to figure out the worse case time complexity of your algorithm, and of course if it is exact ;)


Well, at the bottom of it there is only this usual trick of enumerating permutations in a non-recursive way. That parts uses current, i, and left_to_continue. The rest is bandwidth-specific, and is there to cut branches.

There may be some doc to add, tell me if it is lacking somewhere. This kind of code is easier to write than to review.

Also could you add something to let us kill (CRTL+C) computations since it can be very long...

The `bandwidth_C` method is quite hard to understand. Could you add some more intuition on its principle? It could be useful also for you if you want to modify it in the future and don't remember exactly what you did ;)


In this command:
`pi = (n-1-i//2) if (i%2) else (i//2) # 0, n-1,1,n-2,2,n-3,3, ... that's an ugly 'if'`
Shouldn't you use `((n-1-i)//2)` ?

Hello !

> The `bandwidth_C` method is quite hard to understand. Could you add some more intuition on its principle?


I added some technical comments in the code, but I do not know how to provide more 'intuition'. Have you looked at the module's documentation ? Did you find it clear, or is there something that I did not explain sufficiently ?

> It could be useful also for you if you want to modify it in the future and don't remember exactly what you did ;)


Don't worry about that. I rewrite the same piece of code, over and over, in different patches to never forget it. You will find it at the bottom of #17309, or in the `SubgraphSearch` routine. And probably in others too, but I forgot where `^^;`

> In this command:

No, I think that it is correct. As i<n we would have that (n-1-i)//2<n/2 and also that i//2<n/2, so that pi<n/2 in general. And pi should be a permutation: 0, n-1,1,n-1,2, ...

Tell me if it is easier to understand with the new code comments.

> - This method is for undirected and unweighted graphs. You could mention it somewhere and either test input at the beginning of the method, or by default consider the underlying undirected graph


I added tests and exceptions, as well as changed the document's title.

> - Why are you always returning the adjacency matrix? this could be an optional parameter. In fact, you could have a small method that given a graph and an ordering returns the adjacency matrix to avoid code duplication. Such method could be useful for graphs in general.


I added a 'vertices' argument to `adjacency_matrix`.

> - You never use types `uint16_t` and `uint64_t`


I made `index_t` be equal to `uint16_t` (no problem unless you want the bandwidth of a graph with n>65536) and removed the other imports.
