# Issue 17201: cached methods don't inherit properly if overridden

Consider this example:

```python
class A(object):
    def __init__(self, m):
        self._m = m
        
    @cached_method
    def m(self):
        return self._m
        
class B(A):
    def m(self):
        return A.m(self)
```
The method `m` for the class `B` overrides the method inherited from `A`, but the caching interferes with this. I'm not sure why. As a result, `B(3).m()` doesn't work.

Note that any fix should also allow for this kind of example, and also for when the new method is cached as well:

```python
class A():
    def __init__(self, m):
        self._m = m
        
    @cached_method
    def m(self):
        return self._m
        
class C(A):
    def m(self, flag=False): # signature has changed
        return A.m(self)
```

sage: B(3).m()

sage: class C(A):
        def m(self, flag=False): # signature has changed

....:     
sage: C(3).m()
3
sage: C(3).m(True)

```

Maybe `__get__` should raise an error if `inst is None` and tell the user to do something like the above?

I think the issue here is that both cached methods would occupy the same slot of the instance's dict. Have you tried setting the `name` parameter of ``@`cached_method(name=â¦)` for one of the two?

I reported this also in #31421. Using ``@`cached_method(name=...)` in the superclass does work, but the problem I was having is that the superclass is part of the sage library, and the subclass my own. So that workaround is not viable in that case.

It looks like #21281 is the same thing.
