We have

```
sage: RIF(-1,1)^QQ(1)
[.. NaN ..]
sage: RIF(-1,1)^RIF(1)
[.. NaN ..]
```
whereas

```
sage: RIF(-1,1)^ZZ(1)
0.?
```
More generally, we it works for integers

```
sage: RIF(-1,1)^ZZ(123456)
0.?
```
as well as for the rational or RIF-element 2

```
sage: RIF(-1,1)^QQ(2)
1.?
sage: RIF(-1,1)^RIF(2)
1.?
```
but not for any other rational or RIF-element, e.g.

```
sage: RIF(-1,1)^QQ(3)                              
[.. NaN ..]
sage: RIF(-1,1)^QQ(4)
[.. NaN ..]
```

The reason seems to be

```
sage: log(RIF(-1,1))
[.. NaN ..]
```

The NaN-answer can be considered as wrong, since the true result is a number and can be calculated; it's a limitation of the algorithm.
