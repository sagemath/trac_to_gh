At the moment everything Bessel is sent to mpmath and returns floating point but I<sub>n</sub>(0) and J<sub>n</sub>(0) are in (0,1). Also all I/J/K/Y<sub>n</sub>(x) with n in (-1/2,1/2) is a simple expression.

For the latter see p.10 of
http://www.math.psu.edu/papikian/Kreh.pdf

This allows exact computation of series:

```
sage: bessel_I(2,x).series(x,10)
1/8*x^2 + 1/96*x^4 + 1/3072*x^6 + 1/184320*x^8 + Order(x^10)
```

It does.

These identities are also available (or derivable) from Wikipedia and Mathworld, so we are in good shape.

Question: [W|A claims](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=besselj%28-5%2F2%2C0%29) that one has the complex infinity, not positive infinity, for some of the negative ones like `bessel_J(-5/2, 0)` or for `bessel_I`.  I don't know what to make of that, though.  Also, does `bessel_Y` have an analogous special value for x=0, negative n?

Otherwise looks good.

So, IMO the mpmath behaviour fits its numerical requirements but we should use "zoo" because it's more symbolically correct, and because we have it.

I didn't see anything about this in the many commits here, haven't looked at the 'squashed' one but assume it's not there either.  Otherwise this just requires (from my point of view) some testing.

Also:

```
sage: bessel_J(-5./2,0.)
+infinity
sage: type(_)
<type 'sage.rings.real_mpfr.RealNumber'>
```
I'm not sure what the "right" resolution is here, since MPFR may not have an unsigned infinity.

Patchbot is happy and I don't expect my own last test run to go bad, so these two things are all that remains to resolve, perhaps they are even non-issues?

This appears to be widespread, e.g. I just found `polylog(1.,1.)` vs. `polylog(1,1)` which is due to `zeta(1.)` vs. `zeta(1)`.

Thanks for opening that ticket, that is fine for that issue.

Still a problem here:

Extra `var('n')`?

We stumpled across the issue that `bessel_J(0,x).series(x,3)` didn't have the expected result during a summer school on special functions, in which I was advertising Sage.  It would be nice to report back to the students that the next version of Sage has this fixed :)

This is my first attempt at using git and I haven't used the trac server in many years, so please let me know if I messed something up or didn't follow best practices.  The branch I pushed is supposed to be a merge with the most recent version of Sage, with the following additional changes:

* Removed the extra `var('n')` as noticed by Karl-Dieter.
* In `Function_Bessel_J._eval_`, I replaced `n > 0` with `n.real() > 0`.  I also changed the behaviour to only return `unsigned_infinity` if the real part of `n` is negative.  The reason for these changes is that `bessel_J(i, 0)` should not be evaluated as `0`, as it previously was, nor should it be evaluated as infinite.  (Mathematica evaluates this value as `Indeterminate`.)
* Likewise for `bessel_I`, for which the situation is equivalent.
* Similarly, I changed `Function_Bessel_Y._eval_` so that indeterminate values like `bessel_Y(I,0)` are not evaluated.
* Likewise for `bessel_K`.

Doctesting the 5 involved files didn't reveal any troubles.

Indeed, the behaviour for values of Bessel functions at zero is not consistent between symbolic and numeric input.  The symbolic evaluations as provided by this ticket seem appropriate to me (and, as far as I have tested, also agree with the values that Mathematica produces).

On the other hand, the numerical evaluation of Bessel functions is currently outsourced to `mpmath`.  I don't know about the conventions that `mpmath` is using when reporting the corresponding values for numeric `x` (for instance, for `bessel_Y(1/2,x) == -sqrt(2)*sqrt(1/(pi*x))*cos(x)` mpmath produces `mpmath.bessely(0.5,0) == mpf('-inf')`, which results in `bessel_Y(0.5,0) == -infinity`, which is clearly not the limiting value when x approaches zero on the imaginary axis).  To achieve perfect consistency, one could modify the `_evalf_` function to not let `mpmath` handle these cases.  This seems, however, not like an ideal solution.

I would suggest that resolving this inconsistency is better suited for a different ticket (or, if desired, changing the behaviour within `mpmath` itself).

This was not formalized up to now, the general behaviour was to give such conversions if the result is both more elementary and not very complicated. Full implementation can be done in a `Expression.expand_bessel()` function which would then, at some time later, be part of a general `rewrite()` tool (#10137).

I have fixed the failing doctest (the entire example needed to be replaced).

You also mentioned to use `sth.is_trivial_zero()` instead of `sth == 0`, and the reasoning makes perfect sense.

On the other hand, wouldn't it be convenient to have a global function `is_trivial_zero` for the purpose of comparing with zero, without working too hard to simplify?

```
def is_trivial_zero(x):
    try: return x.is_trivial_zero()
    except AttributeError: return x == 0
```

One place for such a function could be `sage/misc/functional.py` which already contains things like `is_even` (which I used as a blueprint here).

Do you think it would be a good idea to have something like that?  If so, should a ticket be opened for that?

No, that calls `__nonzero__` after `is_trivial_zero()` returned `False`. You need `(isinstance(sth, Expression) and sth.is_trivial_zero()) or (not isinstance(sth, Expression) and sth == 0)`.

No, that actually works. What's odd is that I get now an error in `src/sage/tests/french_book/recequadiff.py` that only happens with `sage -tp`. As it is spurious I changed the test. As your work is reviewed someone still needs to look at my commit. Could you please do that and then set positive?

Looks good! Set to positive review.

Yes, I was initially worried about that, too, when following the hypergeometric implementation.

> What's odd is that I get now an error in `src/sage/tests/french_book/recequadiff.py` that only happens with `sage -tp`. As it is spurious I changed the test.


Your solution seems fine.  I am seeing the same spurious behavior when running the test versus running the code in a notebook.

> You need `(isinstance(sth, Expression) and sth.is_trivial_zero()) or (not isinstance(sth, Expression) and sth == 0)`.


Oops, you are right!  Definitely not a brief and convenient substitute for `sth == 0`.  I'll open a ticket suggesting a global `is_trivial_zero` function.
