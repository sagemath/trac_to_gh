The current spkg-install script for pari includes the following specific darwing instruction

```
if [ "$UNAME" = "Darwin" ]; then
        # The following is a hack to get the library installed correctly
        # on Mac OS X:
        echo "Applying Mac OS X hack -- deleting and reinstalling libpari.a ..."
        rm -f Odarwin-ppc/*lib*
        $MAKE install-lib-sta
        if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
            echo >&2 "Error reinstalling PARI's static libraries (OS X trick)"
            exit 1
        fi

        cd "`config/objdir`" && cp -f libpari* "$SAGE_LOCAL/lib"
        if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
            echo >&2 "Error copying PARI's libraries (OS X trick)"
            exit 1
        fi
        cd "$CUR"
    fi
```
This section completely destroy the proper setting of darwin's install_name for no good reason. It needs to be removed. See conversation in #16017 and #16044 about this.

This passes all long doctests on 10.7 (other than the `PowmInsecureWarning: Not using mpz_powm_sec.` and a Maxima timeout, but those are unrelated and happen to me anyway).

Maybe someone should test on 10.9, but otherwise I wouldn't hold it up for me testing on any older platform.
