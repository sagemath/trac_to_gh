The following doctest is taken from `combinat/designs/orthogonal_arrays.py`:

```
sage: iOA = designs.incomplete_orthogonal_array(10,153,[9]*10) # long time
sage: OA9 = designs.orthogonal_arrays.build(10,9)
sage: for i in range(10):                                      
....:     iOA.extend([[153-9*(i+1)+x for x in B] for B in OA9])
sage: is_orthogonal_array(iOA,10,153)                          
True
```
It fails if tested without `--long` since the first line is not executed, so `iOA` is not defined in subsequent calls.
