> What exactly did you want to reorganize?

I reordered the links to the individual chapters, renamed some of them, and organized them into subsections. Unless I made a mistake, there is no new link, and the only deleted link is the one to the todo list. This should be easy to check with `git diff | grep '+\*' | sort` or something similar. Knowing that, I think just comparing the full tables of contents (old and new) should give you a pretty clear picture of the changes.
