This triggers error:

```
P1=Posets.ChainPoset(3)
P2=Posets.PentagonPoset().relabel(lambda x: x+10)
P=Poset( (P1.list()+P2.list(), P1.cover_relations()+P2.cover_relations()) )
P.show()
```

Error message is `ValueError: element (=2) not in poset`. Reason was default value for argument `facade`. This is corrected in this ticket.

Same bug was in `Posets.DiamondPoset()`. Also `Posets.DiamondPoset(2)` returns empty poset, `DiamondPoset(1)` gives error message. This is now changed in for `n <= 2` they raise exception.

I HATE THIS CODE. You cannot for one second even trust that it does what you think it should do.

Okay, that's because there is in Poset(....) a keyword named "facade" (not how clearly it indicates what it does) that changes the type of the things inside of the poset.

```
sage: d = DiGraph({0:[1]})
sage: map(type,Poset(d))
[sage.rings.integer.Integer, sage.rings.integer.Integer]
sage: map(type,Poset(d,facade=False))
[sage.combinat.posets.elements.FinitePoset_with_category.element_class,
 sage.combinat.posets.elements.FinitePoset_with_category.element_class]
```

I had to fight a looooong time ago to obtain that facade becomes True by defaut in Posets. And now it is, but for some stupid reason the constructor of PentagonalPoset enforces facade=False. So the code should only be changed to follow the same default as the Poset constructor. Or even to remove this keyword in PentagonalPoset, or replace it with `**kwds`... Anything `-_-`

By the way: the real explanation is that the + has been changed to mean "join" or "meet". It is not had to find out: take your 'x' as you defined it and type 'x.__add__'.

Helloooooooooooooo !

Seems good, but why did you remove that doc ? 

Also, could you mention this `n>=3` in the doc of DiamondPoset ?

Thanks,

Why do you think that it is irrelevant here ? It is a docstring about an object, so why don't we show its nice properties ? This sage software is all about checking on computers what we can prove on paper anyway `:-)`

Hello !

I added a small commit on top of yours. What it does :

1) Remove the `"` in the first line of doc of the `PentagonPoset` constructor.

2) Improve the doc of the `facade` keyword

3) Bring the former doctest back. The point is that doctests are not only useful to the users, but also to test our own code. I can't tell you how many bugs are avoided just because there is always a doctest somewhere that tests the corner case you did not think about. If we ever change the data structure of Posets, do anything in the graphs backends, those doctests are the only way we have to make sure everything is holding together.

4) Changing the default value of facade was breaking doctests in another file, so I updated them. In order to check the doctests use `sage -b && sage -tp <num_of_cpu> -l file_or_directory`

I will also create a ticket to ask Nicolas to write some documentation about `Facade`, because right now there is none to find.

Set this ticket to `positive_review` if you agree with the changes.

Nathann
