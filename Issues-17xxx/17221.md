Hello,

I added the trac ticket number to the `LookupError`. I wonder why there is no specification for the `_deprecation` argument of `LazyImport`...

If you like it, you can set to positive review.

I think it's a good idea to add the ticket number, but then we might as well always return the ticket when asking for the deprecation (since `0` is `False` in a boolean context, this works as expected). Needs review.
