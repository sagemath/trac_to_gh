Review of 1ab837dc5f069e044af903439caa8807b9739102. Here are a couple of things that could be improved:

- coercions mentioned w.r.t. output rings are conversions

- maybe: range(base.abs())  --> srange(base.abs())  (in code and docstring)

- I'm not sure if it is good to mention "Python int" at all (in docstring), since usually they shouldn't appear (maybe adapt your code (where necessary) to avoid Python-int output (if any appears; not checked by me))

- T(expansion) ==f(n) is confusing, e.g. in the first example (binary sum of digits) you would have here [1,1,1] = T([1,1,1]) = f(7) = 3.

- example binary sum of digits: Maybe (for a deeper understanding) it helps, if one could see the output of the transducer on a concrete example. Maybe also write one sentence why binary sum of digits gives the Identity-transducer and how one can see the sum of digits somewhere.

- still example binary sum of digits: there is a lot about output_rings...is this needed in the first example already? Maybe make that a second example or at least separate it from the first example, so that it is clear, this is not needed to understand in the introductory example.

- example nonadjacent form: it would be good to include concrete examples here as well, so that one sees a NAF and its weight. Also: at the moment digits -1 are not considered, but in the wiki-article they are mentioned at the top; this could lead to some confusion.

Apart from those things: code looks good, doc builds, tests pass. I did not check the math of the ticket, only the examples (these seem to be correct). I would be happy if someone else could help with this part.

I've also made a couple of small changes (PEP8; docstrings) which I'll upload soon.

In fact, as a by-product of [85efb10](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/85efb10d3e0afc4546093e81de99107848f2b221), Python int cannot occur any more.

This lead to a new concept for the whole method: it is more general to interpret `+` as addition of words than to interpret it in a ring. So this has been changed in [85efb10](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/85efb10d3e0afc4546093e81de99107848f2b221). I somehow reworded this sentence you mention here, please check whether it is clearer now.

> - example binary sum of digits: Maybe (for a deeper understanding) it helps, if one could see the output of the transducer on a concrete example. Maybe also write one sentence why binary sum of digits gives the Identity-transducer and how one can see the sum of digits somewhere.


I replaced the example by the weight of the ternary expansion; here it should be clearer. Concrete example and more explanations added ([83f1c03](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/83f1c033f3a404a5e22a6bd9704a2f25430fea0a)).

Apart from that, I made three more changes:

* [4d160d7](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/4d160d727d8d929b035f30247f4f9800d4476901) Trac #17221: move parsing of equation to a different method

  transducers.Recursions had two major parts: parsing the symbolic
  equations and actual construction of the transducer. These first part
  has now been refactored into a new method.

* [446f8f4](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/446f8f41aa839181fa1e092cb9431756b8f5efb2) Trac #17221: Allow alternative input format (rules)

  Allow to enter the recursions in the form of rules as they are stored
  internally. In that case, no symbolic function and no variable are needed,
  so the order of the parameters has been changed.

* [25e02eb](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/25e02eb04cb3ab1b8ac820528f586f637fe1aeca) Trac #17221: Allow negative residues r in recursion rules.
