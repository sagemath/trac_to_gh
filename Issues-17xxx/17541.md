Hi,

I have some code that relies heavily on lrcalc and when the input gets more complicated it starts crashing. I managed to find the following minimal code example that usually crashes Sage here (run it repeatedly if it does not crash at once):

```
import sage.libs.lrcalc.lrcalc as lrcalc

def lrcalc_test():
    a=lrcalc.coprod([5,4,3,2,1])
    b=lrcalc.mult([3,2,0],[0])
    c=lrcalc.coprod([0])
    d=lrcalc.mult([3,2,0],[0,1])
```

I am using Sage 6.4.1 (with lrcalc 1.1.7) on Ubuntu 12.04 amd64.

The output of sage is attached.

**Assignee:** sage-combinat

**Keywords:** lrcalc

**Upstream:** Reported upstream. No feedback yet.

I just realized that the problem was that [0,1] is invalid input. I changed the milestone to invalid.
