The following apparently tries to convert `p` and `q` into a wrong common ring (even though they already both have parent `S`):

```
A.<a,b,c> = Frac(PolynomialRing(QQ,'a,b,c'))
B.<d,e,f> = PolynomialRing(A,'d,e,f')
R.<x>= PolynomialRing(B,'x')
S.<y> = PolynomialRing(R,'y')
p = ((1/b^2*d^2+1/a)*x*y^2+a*b/c*y+e+x^2)
q = -4*c^2*y^3+1
print(p.resultant(q))
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: not a constant polynomial
```
This ticket solves the bug by simply passing the variable with respect to which we want to take the resultant to PARI, instead of trying to change the variable names.  The documentation is also updated.

So some resultants that used to be computed using Singular will now go through `sylvester_matrix`—is that correct? Do you know if it makes a significant difference in terms of speed?

Possibly, but this is only relevant when the polynomials are univariate polynomials over a multivariate polynomial ring.  The Sylvester matrix is only used if the coefficients cannot be converted to PARI; what probably happens in most cases is that the resultant is computed through PARI rather than Singular.  For genuine multivariate polynomials, Singular is still used via `MPolynomial_libsingular.resultant()`.

I don't know.  How about adding an `algorithm` keyword (which could be `pari`, `singular` or `sylvester` for now) so that the user can easily choose an implementation and we can compare the speed of the implementations?
