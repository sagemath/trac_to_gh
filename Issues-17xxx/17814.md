If a pyx file in the sage library uses cached methods and then the source file is removed after compiling Sage, then accessing the cached methods in this file becomes impossible. Example: Move the file `src/sage/rings/finite_rings/finite_field_base.pyx` away. Then:

```

    253         attribute = getattr(cls, name)

AttributeError: 'FiniteField_prime_modn_with_category' object has no attribute 'factored_order'
```

The same does work in attached pyx files, even after removing the temporary copy of the pyx file. Conjecture: The cached method's `__get__` method relies on source code inspection. That should of course not be the case. Source code inspection should only come in play if the user wants to see the source code or at least the doc string.

I chose the component "distribution", since it was reported on sage-devel as something that happened on certain sage distributions that do not provide sage sources.

So: cached_method tries to determine the number of arguments. This is because there is a special implementation for functions with no argument (except `self`).

In other words, the wrong behaviour could be fixed by finding a way to get the number of arguments (or better the argspec) of a cython function without looking at its source code. I'll see if that's possible. So, the fix will likely be in `sage.misc.sageinspect`, not in `sage.misc.cachefunc`.

Do you really require the number and names of arguments or do you only want to know whether a function takes any `*args` and/or `**kwds` at all (apart from the `self` argument)?

Technically, Python always uses `*args` and `**kwds` to pass arguments (except for some special methods like `__new__`). It's the Cython method implementation which interprets these `*args` and `**kwds`.

Yes, we do require that. Equivalent inputs should result in identical output.

The problem occurs when the cached method is bound to an instance. At that point, we want to know if the method accepts *any* argument in addition to `self`. If it does, then a `CachedMethodCaller` is set as an attribute of the instance. If it does not, then a `CachedMethodCallerNoArgs` is bound to the method. If sage can't answer the question, then an `AttributeError` is raised. We don't need to know all argument names and all defaults, but we do need to know their number.

This information is cheaply available when cython does its work, We could ask the cython devs if they would be willing to equip their function objects with attributes that play the role of `__code__.co_argcount`,  `__code__.co_flags` (to see if `*args` or `**kwds` is present), `__code__.varnames`, `func_defaults`.

Cython writes the code that splits up the `*args` and `**kwargs` that python calls at C-API get, and generates errors if it doesn't fit some internal pattern. For inspection and dynamical code, the required pattern information should really be made available.

They could either write it into the docstring (as they already do with source file information) or they could put some attributes on their cython function objects.

Example:

```
sage: cython("""def f(a,b=0): pass""")
sage: f(a=1)
sage: f(b=1)
TypeError: f() takes at least 1 positional argument (0 given)
sage: f(1,c=1)
TypeError: f() got an unexpected keyword argument 'c'
```
I think it's quite reasonable if cython would make available what the number of positional arguments can be and which keyword arguments are accepted.

If I recall correctly, there is a compile option to do so.

In any case, I believe that for now we should proceed as follows:
- Avoid source code inspection in the cached method's `__get__` (as done by the currently attached branch)
- When creating the `ArgumentFixer`, we need to know the argspec. If it can not be determined, then no error should be raised.

Replying to [@nbruin](#comment%3A33):
> They could either write it into the docstring (as they already do with source file information) or they could put some attributes on their cython function objects.

I think the docstring is the only option: look at the fields of [PyMethodDef](https://docs.python.org/2/c-api/structures.html#c.PyMethodDef)

Even then, I would propose to use just `*args` and `**kwds` for Cython methods, which will surely be faster than messing with the list of arguments. In the case where uniquess really matters for Cython methods, a wrapper could be added to fix the arguments.

<a id='comment:38'>**Comment 38:**</a>
Soon I will submit another commit. With it, I can do the following:

I created a file `src/sage/misc/cache_test.pyx` and rebuilt Sage. In fact, the new pyx file got compiled even without mentioning it in `module_list.py`. Content of the file:

```python
from sage.misc.cachefunc import cached_method, cached_function
from sage.structure.parent cimport Parent

@cached_function
def bla(x,y,z=2):
    return (x+y)*z

cdef class Foo(Parent):
    @cached_method
    def bar(self, a,b, c=1):
        return (a+b)*c
```
I started a Sage session and got:

```
sage: from sage.misc.cache_test import Foo, bla
sage: bla(2,3,2) is bla(2,3,z=2)
True
sage: F = Foo()
sage: F.bar(2,3,2) is F.bar(2,3,c=2)
True
```
as expected.

Then I left Sage, removed `src/sage/misc/cache_test.pyx`. Restarting (but not recompiling!) Sage, I now get:

```
sage: from sage.misc.cache_test import Foo, bla
sage: bla(2,3,2) is bla(2,3,z=2)
False
sage: bla(2,3,2) == bla(2,3,z=2)
True
sage: F = Foo()
sage: F.bar(2,3,2) is F.bar(2,3,c=2)
False
sage: F.bar(2,3,2) == F.bar(2,3,c=2)
True
sage: bla(2,3,2) is bla(2,3,2)
True
sage: F.bar(2,3,2) is F.bar(2,3,2)
True
```
So, the argument mangling fails, but at least one can call the wrapped functions and methods in the expected way, with a basic level of caching.

Now the questions are: Would that be enough to declare the problem as "fixed for now"? And how to doctest it? Is it possible/reasonable to have a source file that is temporarily moved away by its own doctest?

Branch will soon be updated.

If we need to access argument information on cython functions/methods, we might consider using

```
cython("""
import cython
@cython.binding(True)
def f(a,b=0): pass

def g(a,b=0): pass

def c(F,n_in):
  cdef int n=n_in
  for i in range(n):
    F(1)
""")
```
With this we have

```
sage: f.func_defaults
(0,)
sage: f.__code__.co_varnames
('a', 'b')
```
There might be a penalty to pay, though:

```
sage: %time c(f,1000000000)
CPU times: user 7.7 s, sys: 10 ms, total: 7.71 s
Wall time: 8.06 s
sage: %time c(g,1000000000)
CPU times: user 7.43 s, sys: 13 ms, total: 7.45 s
Wall time: 7.78 s
```
If we can do away with source file inspection during startup (as would now happen for cython modules), we should see a significant improvement of startup time too! Finding line numbers in a text file is not a fast operation.

Honestly, I absolutely don't like it. It's much better if stuff obviously breaks (i.e. the current situation) instead of breaking in a very subtle way (some method relies on uniquess, which is not guaranteed if the source file is missing).

If this issue is fixed, it should be fixed in such a way that it doesn't matter at all whether the source file is present.

It does seem to work for `class` in cython, but sadly not for `cdef class`:

```
cython("""

The first object does have the `func_*` attributes, but the second doesn't. Perhaps that is something that the cython devs can do something about.

Not without a performance penalty. If you want the method to be a fast `PyCFunction`, you are limited in which attributes it has.

That's why I suggest to have a practical fix that works for now. Recall that the problem from the ticket description came from a report on sage-devel, where people actually work with flavours of Sage that come without the source code.

I think that the current branch does not have a high danger of creating subtle caching problems. First of all, with the branch, a change in behaviour can only occur when we have a cached method-with-default-arguments-and/or-args/kwds of a cdef class whose source file is not available. Methods without arguments will be totally fine if the source file is gone (so, the branch does fix a problem).

A change in behaviour would most likely be a problem where coercion is involved, i.e., in `UniqueRepresentation`. But there, we are safe, since (a) sub-classes of `UniqueRepresentation` must be Python classes anyway (and Python classes aren't affected by the bug), and (b) `UniqueRepresentation.__classcall__` has generic arguments `*args,**kwds`.

If you think that it is too dangerous to silently change behaviour rather than raise a straight forward error, we could instead raise a warning (only once, similar to deprecation warnings) when a cached method is called on a method whose argspec can't be determined.

I agree the danger is "not high" but it's not zero either. Subtle deviations like this are the source of incredibly difficult-to-replicate issues later on, because the reporter will of course forget to report that this is a sourceless distribution. (Perhaps it's not so bad: the bug will just be ignored because we can't replicate it)

I'm not so sure a warning is an option: I'd expect that the first occurrence would be during system startup, so the warning might get lost.

Anyway, I think the fact that we look at the source at all in order to figure out how to preprocess the arguments is a deficiency. I'd prefer if we can use this ticket to track the resolution of that, but if this issue is really urgent for some users, I guess we can merge something along the lines of what you propose.

I expect that we'll find a cython-based solution, possibly docstring based. It might be a configure option to select if you want this extra data in your docstrings, but in sage we probably would, since we process the docstrings for display anyway.

Can we perhaps instrument the caching machinery to log any cache hits that would have been misses if `*arg, **kwarg` would be processed into a cache key without transporting over keywords to positional parameters? Then we can see the extent of the problem.

The main one I expect there is from cases where people specify a default parameter, but with the default value, and that's a serious one:

```
@cached_function
def a(x,y=1)
  return set([x,y])
```
Then `[a(1),a(1,1)]` should contain two identical sets, but only caching on `*arg` and `**kwarg` would return result in two non-identical sets, because the second would have an implicit keyword parameter `y` rather than a second positional parameter.

I think this is potentially quite a serious issue, especially because in sage, much caching happens with the purpose of making things unique (but perhaps currently never in cython applications ...)

I think this `embedsignature=True` is what we need:

```
sage: cython("""

....: cdef class A(object):
....:   @cython.embedsignature(True)
....:   def b(x,y=0): pass

A.b(x, y=0)

i.e., if we ensure that we have `embedsignature=True` (probably globally throughout the library), then we just need to change how cython docstrings are used to accommodate for the fact that the first line is the signature. Then `sage_argspec` can just look in the docstring to see if it can find a signature there. No source inspection required anymore.

This is a one-off hitch. It just means that when we enable `embedsignature` globally, people should clear their cython cache (once).

We can.

Would it be ok to rebase this branch on top of the current develop branch (and then force-push)? Or would it be ok if I merged this branch into the current develop and start with it? Or merge the current develop into this branch? I still don't get what is considered best praxis.

<a id='comment:64'>**Comment 64:**</a>
I am now using the embedded signatures (due to #17847) for introspection. I preserved the previous commits by merging the previous ticket branch into the current develop to get the new ticket branch; hopefully the correct procedure.

In order to demonstrate what is happening, I added a dummy method to a nested test class provided in sage.misc.nested_class. As it turns out, there has been a bug in the previous `sage_getargspec` that is now fixed. I suppose that the bug actually is in Cython:

```
sage: from sage.misc.nested_class import MainClass
sage: print MainClass.NestedClass.NestedSubClass.dummy.func_defaults
None
```
Actually the default is not None but is a tuple, which is correctly determined by the new version of `sage_getargspec`:

```
sage: sage_getargspec(MainClass.NestedClass.NestedSubClass.dummy)
ArgSpec(args=['self', 'x', 'r'], varargs='args', keywords='kwds', defaults=((1, 2, 3.4),))
```

Moreover, the above does not involve reading the source code. I wrote a new function that determines the argspec from the embedded signature, and strips the signature at the same time:

```
sage: print MainClass.NestedClass.NestedSubClass.dummy.__doc__
NestedSubClass.dummy(self, x, *args, r=(1, 2, 3.4), **kwds)
File: sage/misc/nested_class.pyx (starting at line 314)

                A dummy method to demonstrate the embedding of
                method signature for nested classes.
...
sage: from sage.misc.sageinspect import _extract_embedded_signature
sage: print _extract_embedded_signature(MainClass.NestedClass.NestedSubClass.dummy.__doc__, 'dummy')[0]
File: sage/misc/nested_class.pyx (starting at line 314)

                A dummy method to demonstrate the embedding of
                method signature for nested classes.
...
sage: _extract_embedded_signature(MainClass.NestedClass.NestedSubClass.dummy.__doc__, 'dummy')[1]
ArgSpec(args=['self', 'x', 'r'], varargs='args', keywords='kwds', defaults=((1, 2, 3.4),))
```

The tests in sage.misc pass.
