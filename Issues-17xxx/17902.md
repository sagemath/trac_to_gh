This has apparently not been implemented in Sage, but there is a substantial amount of theory dedicated to this, and apparently a standard open source option, [CGSuite](http://cgsuite.sourceforge.net/).  Finding ways to emulate some behavior, and especially to have an interface to CGSuite, would be great.

Awesome news!

Just for reference, you may wish to emulate the way the (non-cooperative) game theory modules are structured, with a separate interface, e.g. [normal form games](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/blob/develop/src/sage/game_theory/normal_form_game.py) and the three different ways to compute them (gambit, lrs, and Sage native).  If we can keep the interface to something like CGSuite as an optional package separate from how we implement such classes, but keep it compatible, then there is potential for better modularity and potential working together of the two programs, at least in the long run.  No need to reinvent the wheel, as is perhaps *too* often said in Sage circles...

Karl-Dieter,

I was planning to actually reimplement the classes and methods from CGSuite, but I do know that sage is good at calling other programs, so let me ask you about doing this from within sage.  If I were to simply build a sage wrapper around CGSuite, would this require CGSuite to have some kind of special interface, like gambit's python API or its command line interface?.

I don't know much about calling external programs from with sage, whatever you can tell me will help.

thanks
brett

What I suggest is the following.
* Create basic classes that have the same API as CGSuite, though "Sageified" or "Pythonized" (I don't know anything about CGSuite).
* Create some basic implementation that doesn't require CGSuite, but which could use it behind the scenes.
* Eventually connect it via perhaps the scripting language for CGS.  But yes, you are right that it would need something that at the very least could be connected with using a library or pexpect.

However, given that there doesn't seem to be such an api, and yet one wouldn't want to reimplement a huge thing like this, maybe the first best step is the following:
* Contact the CGSuite maintainer
* Ask whether they would be interested in a Sage interface
* And whether they would be interested in providing at least some minimal CLI for the program.
  * For instance, one could install CGSuite as an optional package than then there is something called `sage-native-execute` or other ways to run such programs from Java "inside Sage", so to speak, though we don't do it with Java too much, maybe for polymake when it worked?
* Then in the meantime work on the Sage version of the structures and classes, leaving room (as with the history of the normal form games) for later incorporation of that.
* Alternately, maybe the maintainer even wants to help directly with Sage integration if the project has been idle for a while...

One big reason is that it's not just not wasting time, but that it's so super-easy for little bugs to creep in when rewriting something in a different language.

But anyway it sounds like you have a good handle on this already, and a plan, which is great.

I am drafting a post to the CGSUite developer's maillist.  I have been reading over Chapter 6 of W. Stein's "[Sage for power users](http://modular.math.washington.edu/books/sagebook)" and possibly the best strategy for calling CGSUite might be option (4): Create a C/C++ library interface and link the other program into Python itself, using Cython.  But of course in the case of CGSuite, this would be "Create a Java library interface ..."  So I want to ask here what capabilities of this kind (calling Java) Sage has?  Can Sage use Jython, for example?
