Thanks. Even worse, I found an error, tried to change the file, and discovered after the fact that Sage had reverted all my changes to the original. I'm deeply confused why this is happening.

...which has a green box declaring,

    **Hint:** We recommend to not use the developer scripts. You will have to *learn git* sooner or later, why not start now?

:-) I'll try it. Thanks again.

If you are unfamiliar with git, I would also recommend that you experiment a bit in a sandbox project first. There are great tutorials on the web.

just guessing; you checked out a different branch 
(check on which branch you are with 'git branch')? 
Or did a 'git reset' or similar? 
Or you edited an installed file instead a repository file? 
After changing a file before it is committed you should see that something changed with 'git status'

sage$ git branch

It looks to me that, if anything changed, it was done by git itself. I *should* be on "multigraded_hilbert". (I THINK. I was seeing this problem before I tried to commit, too.)

> Or did a 'git reset' or similar? 


Nope.

> Or you edited an installed file instead a repository file? 


Uhmmm... Where is this distinction made in the developer's guide?

Wait a second. Looking at what `git branch` told me above, I switched to the `multigraded_hilbert` branch, and found the changes I made. I did not create this new branch manually. Apparently, this change occurred when `git commit` created a new trac ticket?

<a id='comment:8'></a>> I *should* be on "multigraded_hilbert"


not necessarily. 
The workflow is to create a new ticket using 'git trac create', 
which likely created and switched to
't/17298/adding_graded_weighted_hilbert_series_functionality_to_sage' 
and THEN do the changes on that branch. 

What I would try is while on 'multigraded_hilbert' do 
'git diff t/17298/adding_graded_weighted_hilbert_series_functionality_to_sage' 
and if the diff has only your changes, 
switch to 't/17298/adding_graded_weighted_hilbert_series_functionality_to_sage' ,
and 'git merge multigraded_hilbert'
into your ticket.

Well, (free) additive abelian groups of rank n are just ZZ<sup>n</sup>. Although IDK if it makes mathematical sense to consider a grading group with torsion (such as exterior algebras which have a natural ZZ<sub>2</sub> grading), and if it doesn't, that's a bunch of parent checking. Yet from a coding point of view, one just needs to pass it to `tuple`:

```
sage: G = AdditiveAbelianGroup([0,0])
sage: x = G(vector([4,2])); x
(4, 2)
sage: tuple(x)
(4, 2)
```
So since you're okay with making the user do things for a vector, then I'd say set a positive review.

That's likely what I'll do. The changes you made are definitely an improvement; unfortunately, they require me to rebuild a whole bunch of things, ** *some of which don't build! * **

<a id='comment:21'></a>Two comments, requesting change:

* In the Hilbert numerator function, the documentation is wrong: "Hilbert numerator" changed to "Hilbert series." I presume that's a copy & paste error. :-)

* The original error message,
     Grading for Hilbert Series must be a list or tuple of integers
  has changed to,
     Grading must be a list or a tuple of integers.
  When I run a script or program, I find it useful when an error message tells me not only *that* something is wrong, but also *where* it's wrong. Can you change it back to the original error message? (This is the kind of thing I notice only when I edit the changes by hand.)
