Thanks. Even worse, I found an error, tried to change the file, and discovered after the fact that Sage had reverted all my changes to the original. I'm deeply confused why this is happening.

...which has a green box declaring,

    **Hint:** We recommend to not use the developer scripts. You will have to *learn git* sooner or later, why not start now?

:-) I'll try it. Thanks again.

If you are unfamiliar with git, I would also recommend that you experiment a bit in a sandbox project first. There are great tutorials on the web.

>Even worse, I found an error, tried to change the file, and discovered after the fact that Sage had >reverted all my changes to the original. I'm deeply confused why this is happening.


just guessing; you checked out a different branch 
(check on which branch you are with 'git branch')? 
Or did a 'git reset' or similar? 
Or you edited an installed file instead a repository file? 
After changing a file before it is committed you should see that something changed with 'git status'

sage$ git branch

  ticket_10716

It looks to me that, if anything changed, it was done by git itself. I *should* be on "multigraded_hilbert". (I THINK. I was seeing this problem before I tried to commit, too.)

> Or did a 'git reset' or similar? 


Nope.

> Or you edited an installed file instead a repository file? 


Uhmmm... Where is this distinction made in the developer's guide?

Wait a second. Looking at what `git branch` told me above, I switched to the `multigraded_hilbert` branch, and found the changes I made. I did not create this new branch manually. Apparently, this change occurred when `git commit` created a new trac ticket?

not necessarily. 
The workflow is to create a new ticket using 'git trac create', 
which likely created and switched to
't/17298/adding_graded_weighted_hilbert_series_functionality_to_sage' 
and THEN do the changes on that branch. 

What I would try is while on 'multigraded_hilbert' do 
'git diff t/17298/adding_graded_weighted_hilbert_series_functionality_to_sage' 
and if the diff has only your changes, 
switch to 't/17298/adding_graded_weighted_hilbert_series_functionality_to_sage' ,
and 'git merge multigraded_hilbert'
into your ticket.

It seems you are using the git-trac script. 
* `git checkout` switches between local branches
* `git trac checkout` will download a branch from our git server and switch to it

You should figure out which local branch contains your changes, then switch to it, then run `git trac push 17298` to upload it to this ticket (you might need to add `--force`). And delete the unwanted local branch.

Thank you, Volker! I'm seeing the changes, and they're looking like what I expected. (Forgot to commit the last change before the first push; sorry about that.)

I had thought about a vector, but it was so little work I figured the client could do it. Grading by an additive abelian group is a new one to me; how does that work? If it isn't too much trouble, we could work it into this ticket; otherwise, I'll just mark it "positive review."

Yet from a coding point of view, one just needs to pass it to `tuple`:

```
sage: G = AdditiveAbelianGroup([0,0])
sage: x = G(vector([4,2])); x
(4, 2)
sage: tuple(x)
(4, 2)
```
So since you're okay with making the user do things for a vector, then I'd say set a positive review.

Two comments, requesting change:

* In the Hilbert numerator function, the documentation is wrong: "Hilbert numerator" changed to "Hilbert series." I presume that's a copy & paste error. :-)

* The original error message,
     Grading for Hilbert Series must be a list or tuple of integers
  has changed to,
     Grading must be a list or a tuple of integers.
  When I run a script or program, I find it useful when an error message tells me not only *that* something is wrong, but also *where* it's wrong. Can you change it back to the original error message? (This is the kind of thing I notice only when I edit the changes by hand.)

Fixed the c/p error. However the traceback tells you where the error occurred:

```

I believe the error message should be concise and not repeat information (plus I think most error messages in Sage/python don't tell you this info and rely on the traceback). However if you feel strongly about having `Hilbert series` into the error message, I'll change it.

OK, I think I had confused this type of error message with another (e.g., I'm working with a Cython program, and it doesn't usually tell you where something happened). I'll give it a positive review.

Thank you very much for the help w/improving this patch. :-)
