```
sage: V = VectorSpace(RDF,3)
sage: v2 = vector(RDF, [1, 2, 3, 4])
sage: v2 in V
True
```
The containment test for free modules `sage.modules.free_module.FreeModule_ambient.__contains__` doesn't bother testing that the *number* of entries matches the rank.

This is fixed by #10513; we just add a doctest.
