```
On cygwin (32 and 64), the alarm mechanism is broken:

```
sage: alarm(0.1); sum(xrange(100000000))
4999999950000000
```
instead of the expected interrupt.

I traced the bug by dichotomy to a ppl component named watchdog. Its role is similar to alarm, involving signals and interrupts. I guess that, due to the peculiarities of cygwin's implementation of signals, watchdog somehow intercepts the python signals and does dot send them back.

watchdog is not an optional component of ppl, so it can not be disabled by a configure flag. However, it is disabled on systems that don't have `setitimer`. Cygwin has `setitimer`, but a simple hack of ppl's makefile can hide it, thereby disabling watchdog and fixing the sage alarm mechanism. This is done in the proposed patch.

A better fix would be to dig into the ppl and cygwin signal mechanism, of course...

```json
{
    "body": "<div id=\"comment:9\" align=\"right\">comment:9</div>\n\nExcellent question. There is essentially no documentation on this ppl watchdog that I could find. It seems to be a classical watchdog mechanism, i.e., it detects if some computation loops forever, and in this case it interrupts it automatically and resets things to a nicer state. In particular, it should not play any role in non-buggy situations.\n\nIt is not necessary to PPL (since it is disabled on some platforms, those which don't have `setitimer`), and I do not see how it could be relevant to sage. So, my impression is that it is safe to disable it (note that the patch only disables it on cygwin, so it will not break anything on officially supported platforms). On cygwin, with the patch, `sage -t all` does not show any ppl-related failure. By the way, without the patch, `sage -t all` hangs forever and eats all available memory, since some tests rely on `alarm` to be interrupted! So, in my opinion, the patch gives a definitive improvement on cygwin.",

Excellent question. There is essentially no documentation on this ppl watchdog that I could find. It seems to be a classical watchdog mechanism, i.e., it detects if some computation loops forever, and in this case it interrupts it automatically and resets things to a nicer state. In particular, it should not play any role in non-buggy situations.

It is not necessary to PPL (since it is disabled on some platforms, those which don't have `setitimer`), and I do not see how it could be relevant to sage. So, my impression is that it is safe to disable it (note that the patch only disables it on cygwin, so it will not break anything on officially supported platforms). On cygwin, with the patch, `sage -t all` does not show any ppl-related failure. By the way, without the patch, `sage -t all` hangs forever and eats all available memory, since some tests rely on `alarm` to be interrupted! So, in my opinion, the patch gives a definitive improvement on cygwin.

For me, that's actually a reason to be *against* this patch. Either we need it and we shouldn't disable it on Cygwin, or we don't need it and we can just disable it everywhere.

I'm just posting random links potentially related:
* http://www.cs.unipr.it/pipermail/ppl-devel/2008-October/013156.html

According to [#10039 comment:49](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/10039#comment:49) there used to be a `--disable-watchdog` configure flag, too bad it disappeared.

I guess we should open a bug on ppl bugtracker (if one exists).

Unfortunately it seems cygwin does not ship ppl anymore, so we cannot look at what they would have done.
It could still be useful to post on the cygwin ml's.

`@`sebastien: can you provide a minimal C file reproducing the issue?
Maybe something inspired in the aforementioned 2008 post can help.

I just tried, but unfortunately I was not able to reproduce the issue with plain C or C++ files (for instance, taking the file in the link you give and adding ppl headers and initialization does not break the itimer mechanism).

For the record, steps to reproduce the issue using python:

File `alarm.pyx`:

```
import signal

def essai(n):
  signal.setitimer(signal.ITIMER_REAL, 0.5 , 0)
  return sum(xrange(n))
```

File `alarme_c.cpp`

```
#include <ppl.hh>
```

File `setup.py`

```
from distutils.core import setup
from Cython.Build import cythonize
from distutils.extension import Extension

setup(
    ext_modules = cythonize(Extension("alarme", ['alarme.pyx', 'alarme_c.cpp'], libraries = ['ppl']))
)
```

File `essai.py`

```
import alarme

print alarme.essai(100000000)
```

Compile the extension with

```
python setup.py build_ext --inplace
```

Then `python essai.py` results in `4999999950000000`, no interruption.

Commenting out the header inclusion in `alarme_c.cpp`, then one gets `Alarm clock` instead.
