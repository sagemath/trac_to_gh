```
On cygwin (32 and 64), the alarm mechanism is broken:

```
sage: alarm(0.1); sum(xrange(100000000))
4999999950000000
```
instead of the expected interrupt.

I traced the bug by dichotomy to a ppl component named watchdog. Its role is similar to alarm, involving signals and interrupts. I guess that, due to the peculiarities of cygwin's implementation of signals, watchdog somehow intercepts the python signals and does dot send them back.

watchdog is not an optional component of ppl, so it can not be disabled by a configure flag. However, it is disabled on systems that don't have `setitimer`. Cygwin has `setitimer`, but a simple hack of ppl's makefile can hide it, thereby disabling watchdog and fixing the sage alarm mechanism. This is done in the proposed patch.

A better fix would be to dig into the ppl and cygwin signal mechanism, of course...

Should it be considered as a PPL bug that the methods are not defined in the header? Or a cython bug that this suffices to break the interrupts mechanism? Or a cygwin bug since it does not seem to be a problem on other platforms?

I get your point. Unfortunately, I can't say for sure that watchdog is not helpful to ppl in rare situations (for instance, maybe it uses some algorithms whose termination is not guaranteed, counting on watchdog to exit bad situations), so I would rather keep watchdog wherever possible (i.e., not on cygwin, where setitimer is not fully functional).

I leave the ticket as `needs_work` until someone more knowledgeable on ppl steps up (or someone who really needs the patch on cygwin pushes for it)

I'm just posting random links potentially related:
* http://www.cs.unipr.it/pipermail/ppl-devel/2008-October/013156.html

According to http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/10039#comment:49 there used to be a `--disable-watchdog` configure flag, too bad it disappeared.

I guess we should open a bug on ppl bugtracker (if one exists).

Unfortunately it seems cygwin does not ship ppl anymore, so we cannot look at what they would have done.
It could still be useful to post on the cygwin ml's.

`@`sebastien: can you provide a minimal C file reproducing the issue?
Maybe something inspired in the aforementioned 2008 post can help.

That would be great, especially to send to the upstream bug trackers (PPL and/or Cygwin).

I just tried, but unfortunately I was not able to reproduce the issue with plain C or C++ files (for instance, taking the file in the link you give and adding ppl headers and initialization does not break the itimer mechanism).

For the record, steps to reproduce the issue using python:

File `alarm.pyx`:

```
import signal

def essai(n):
  signal.setitimer(signal.ITIMER_REAL, 0.5 , 0)
  return sum(xrange(n))
```

File `alarme_c.cpp`

```
#include <ppl.hh>
```

File `setup.py`

```
from distutils.core import setup
from Cython.Build import cythonize
from distutils.extension import Extension

setup(
    ext_modules = cythonize(Extension("alarme", ['alarme.pyx', 'alarme_c.cpp'], libraries = ['ppl']))
)
```

File `essai.py`

```
import alarme

print alarme.essai(100000000)
```

Compile the extension with

```
python setup.py build_ext --inplace
```

Then `python essai.py` results in `4999999950000000`, no interruption.

Commenting out the header inclusion in `alarme_c.cpp`, then one gets `Alarm clock` instead.
