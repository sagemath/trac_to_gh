We have to force rebuild of maxima after the upgrade and I think there are minor doctest failures that are caused by the upgrade namely a few like this one:

Not sure if the blank line cause the failure but "?integer?" instead of "integer?" probably does. I am not sure what the "?" is for. There is at least another doctest failing that way.

Replying to [fbissey](#comment%3A2):
> We have to force rebuild of maxima after the upgrade

With the current branch, `make` should automatically build the new Maxima 5.34.1 due to the dependency on #16908, unless you already did a previous build of #16908, in which case you indeed have to reinstall Maxima.
> and I think there are minor doctest failures that are caused by the upgrade

I cannot reproduce these.  The printing of question marks should be suppressed by `build/pkgs/maxima/patches/undoing_true_false_printing_patch.patch`; did that somehow fail to apply?

OK, I actually cheated in #12985 I actually did the testing straight away with the new ecl. I want this to go in, same comments as in #12985 but the version bump should definitely trigger a rebuild.

A side note, #12985 enables ecl to be used with or without unicode. That is ecl compiled without unicode will work just as well with the patch to sage - so long that maxima and sage are properly compiled against that version.
