<a id='comment:2'></a>Actually, the docstring of `.substitute_function()` is grammatically incorrect and totally misleading: 

```
Docstring:     
   Return this symbolic expressions all occurrences of the function
   *original* replaced with the function *new*.
```

I assume that it is supposed to replace all occurrences of the function *original* with the function *new*, so it should return an error whenever one of the arguments is not a function. However, it is quite useful to substitute an expression for a function (see also [https://ask.sagemath.org/question/26114/why-is-basic-arithmetic-disallowed-on-symbolic-functions/](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/26114/why-is-basic-arithmetic-disallowed-on-symbolic-functions/)):


```
var('T', 'x')
BT = function('B')(T)
eq_T = BT == x*T
eq_dT = diff(eq_T, T)
print eq_dT
f(T,x) = T^2
print eq_dT.substitute_function(B, f)
```
returns

```
diff(B(T), T) == x
2*T == x
```

Note, actually that T is a callable symbolic expression. In the below example, I do a less meaningful substitution, which again gives the right result if I substitute a callable symbolic expression, but if I substitute an expression, it gives the wrong result:

```
g(T,x) = x^2
print eq_dT.substitute_function(B, g)
print eq_dT.substitute_function(B, x^2)
print eq_dT.substitute_function(B, g(T,x))
```

This returns 

```
0 == x
2*T == x
2*T == x
```
Only the first result is correct. In the other two, `x^2` is treated as if it was `T^2`. Surely, this is a bug.

Note that the second and third results are accompanied by a deprecation warning: 

```

See http://trac.sagemath.org/5930 for details.
  return operator.change_function(self.new)(*[self(_) for _ in ex.operands()])
```
So, after the deprecation period is over, they will return an error, as it should.
