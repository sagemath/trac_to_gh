After #16746, output of dicts is sorted by index, and this results in one test in  src/doc/en/bordeaux_2008/elliptic_curves.rst failing when the optional database_cremona_ellcurve database is installed:

```
sage: C = CremonaDatabase()
sage: C[37]
{'allbsd': {'a1': [1,
   5.98691729246392,
   0.305999773834052,
   0.0511114082399688,
   1.0],
...
```
is what comes out, since the field with key 'allbsd' which only exists in the optional larger database comes before key 'allcurves' which is in the standard version.  I propose replacing the test with

```
sage: C = CremonaDatabase()
sage: C[37]['allcurves']
{'a1': [[0, 0, 1, -1, 0], 1, 1],
 'b1': [[0, 1, 1, -23, -50], 0, 3],
 'b2': [[0, 1, 1, -1873, -31833], 0, 1],
 'b3': [[0, 1, 1, -3, 1], 0, 3]}
```
and will make this change soon.
