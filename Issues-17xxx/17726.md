Some of them are already in #17727. Could we set the latter as a dependency and completely get rid of `PY_TYPE`?

With #17668 + #17725 + #17726 + #17727, the only remaining occurrences of `PY_TYPE` are in `stdsage.*`. 
And the earlier in the release cycle patches of this kind get merged, the better. So if you don't mind let's leave the issue of removing `PY_TYPE` itself for later, as the present ticket makes sense without it.

Indeed, I've made these different ticket independent for easier reviewing.

If all four of the above tickets are merged, I plan to make a ticket to remove `PY_TYPE_CHECK` and another one to remove the `stdsage.pxi` includes.

I would keep the functions in `stdsage.pxi` for now, just to support existing code on Trac which uses them (consider them "deprecated").
