Instead of

```
    def _cmp_(left, right)
    cdef int _cmp_c_impl(left, right) except -2
```
we should have

```
    cpdef int _cmp_(left, right) except -2
```

Analogously for `_richcmp_`.

There is one important functional change: If a Python class defines both `__cmp__` and `_cmp_`, then formerly the coercion framework would use `__cmp__` by default to implement relational operators like `>=`. After this ticket, `_cmp_` will be tried first, which defaults to `__cmp__`.

<a id='comment:20'></a>## sage.structure.element

1. In the documentation of `sage.structure.element` emphasize what should be done for Python classes as well (and the potential difference between Python and Cython). It is not very clear to me! What I understood is that we should:
   - implement `__cmp__(left,right)` or/and `_richcmp_(left,right,op)`
   - avoid `__eq__`, `__ne__`, etc

2. What about putting

```
# Obvious case
if left is right:
    return _rich_to_bool(op, 0)
```
  directly in `__richcmp__`?

## sage.structure.parent

3. The default comparison for parents is by id which is natural (and I guess what Python does). But the default hash is not based on id and is the stupid one inherited from `SageObject`. Is there a reason?

4. Why not using `_rich_to_bool` in `parent.pyx` instead of

```
if op == 0:  #< 
    return r  < 0
elif op == 2: #==
    return r == 0 
elif op == 4: #>
    return r  > 0
elif op == 1: #<=
    return r <= 0
elif op == 3: #!=
    return r != 0
elif op == 5: #>=
    return r >= 0 
```
  And by the way, why is there a method `cdef _rich_to_bool` on element? it would be useful as a standalone function in other places.

Unfortunately, it is not very clear to me either. In particular, I don't find good Python documentation about the interaction between `__cmp__`, rich comparisons like `__eq__` and `__hash__` and what Python does when you call `cmp(x,y)`. It seems that `cmp(x,y)` only calls `x.__cmp__(y)` when `x` and `y` have the same type, but I don't find this anywhere documented. And I know that inheritance works in a strange way for comparisons, but I also don't quite know how.

Because `__richcmp__` should absolutely be as simple as possible. Don't forget that *every subclass* needs a `__richcmp__` method (because of Python's strange inheritance rules regarding comparison).

<a id='comment:27'></a>I did some experimentations with Python classes. The conclusion is:

     just define `_cmp_` and `_richcmp_` (even though you redefine `__hash__`)

Then:
- rich  comparisons and comparisons work when it involves elements with the same parent (i.e. the newly defined `_cmp_` and `_richcmp_` gets called)
- rich comparisons involving coercion is fine
- comparison involving coercion is **wrong**: if you call `cmp(a,b)` with `a` and `b` between two parents `A` and `B` and a coercion `B -> A` then `Element.__richcmp__` is called instead of `Element.__cmp__`.

Actually, this is not only a bug in Python but also in Cython! I added print statement in each comparisons function in `Element` and see

```
sage: cmp(1,1/3)
Element._richcmp(1,1/3,2)
Element._richcmp(1,1/3,2)
Element._richcmp_(1,1/3,2)
Element._richcmp(1,1/3,0)
Element._richcmp(1,1/3,0)
Element._richcmp_(1,1/3,0)
Element._richcmp(1,1/3,4)
Element._richcmp(1,1/3,4)

Sorry, I forgot a `_`. I wanted to say `Element._cmp_`. The default implementation does check whether `__cmp__` is redefined in element classes. This code is called only if `__cmp__` is defined but not `_richcmp_`. And it seems much better to define `_richcmp_` in children classes.

Call it whatever you want: `cmp(a1,a2)` (same type) calls `__cmp__` but `cmp(a,b)` (different types) does not and use `__richcmp__` instead. The consequence is that you might perform three times the coercion while calling `cmp` with elements with different parents!

<a id='comment:39'></a>5. For Python classes, I guess that one needs to implement `_cmp_` and/or `_richcmp_`. This must be precised in the doc of `Element/Parent`. For this reason, we need a `py_rich_to_bool` available at the level of Python (as well as the operators `Py_EQ`, `Py_NE`, etc).

6. I think we should avoid implenting `__eq__`, `__ne__` because one can do with `_richcmp_` that would take care of coercions. What do you think?

7. There should be a mention of the Python issue that `cmp(a,b)` with `a` and `b` of different types does not call `_cmp_` (or `__cmp__`)

It's an `inline` function, so it won't matter much for performance. `long` is more general than `int`, so if there is ever a use case for a `long`, it will be possible.

<a id='comment:51'></a>9. implementation of `_(rich)cmp`:
   - Why in `_(rich)cmp` it starts with the case `not have_same_parent_c(left,right)` instead of `have_same_parent_c(left,right)`. It would make it more readable the other way around.

```
cdef _richcmp(left, right):
    if have_same_parent_c(left, right):
        return left._richcmp_(<Element>right, op)

    # different parents
    global coercion_model
    cdef int r
    ...
```
- In `return left._(rich)cmp_(<Element>right, op)` is the `<Element>` really needed or usefull?
- could `_left, _right = coercion_model.canonical_coercion(left, right)` be replaced with `left, right = coercion_model.canonical_coercion(left, right)`. As far as I see, there is no need of these extra variables.

10. Could you add some minimal documentation to `_(rich)cmp` and `_(rich)cmp_` like

```
def _richcmp(left, right):
    r"""
    Rich comparisons of elements

    This should not be overriden! To implement comparisons override ``_richcmp_``
    or/and ``_cmp_``.

def _richcmp_(left, right):

    By default it tries to see if `_cmp_` is implemented otherwise does a
    comparison by id for ``==`` and ``!=``. Calling this default method
    with ``<``, ``<=``, ``>`` or ``>=`` will raise a ``NotImplementedError``.

    EXAMPLES::

        sage: from sage.structure.parent import Parent

I don't know why it would be more readable, but I can change it.

>   - In `return left._(rich)cmp_(<Element>right, op)` is the `<Element>` really needed or usefull?
 
It's useful for efficiency. Note how `_(rich)cmp_` is declared with `Element right`. By explicitly calling this with `<Element>right`, Cython does not need to check that `right` is indeed an `Element`.

>   - could `_left, _right = coercion_model.canonical_coercion(left, right)` be replaced with `left, right = coercion_model.canonical_coercion(left, right)`. As far as I see, there is no need of these extra variables.
 
Perhaps surprisingly, there is a need at least for an extra variable `_left`. The point is that `left` is a "self" argument which Cython will always assume and require that it is an instance of `Element`.

<a id='comment:54'></a>OK, I made some further changes to `_richcmp`. There is one important functional change: when comparing two elements of the same type but different parents such that no coercion is possible (e.g. vectors over a different finite field), comparison is done by `id` instead of always returning `True` for `__lt__`:

before:

```
sage: v = vector(GF(5), [1])
sage: w = vector(GF(7), [1])
sage: v < w
True
sage: w < v
True
```

after, `id(v)` and `id(w)` are compared.

This caused some doctest failures, which I simply removed (there was not much point in those tests). I also discovered #18308 this way (where there should be a coercion, but there isn't).

Because rich comparison after coercion calls `_richcmp`, not `__richcmp__`. The only reason this works for `Integer` is that `ZZ` has no sub-rings: it is never the common parent of two different parents.

Right, but `_richcmp` will call `_richcmp_`/`_cmp_`. In Integers (and Rationals after #18304) there is also this `_cmp_` implemented and if everything else failed in `__richcmp__` there is precisely `Element._richcmp(self, other, op)`.

So my mistake, the situation for `ZZ` and `QQ` is a bit different: `Integer/Rational` do not avoid coercion in rich comparisons, they just try to avoid it for most common cases.

Do you have an example of a `Parent` where we want to avoid coercions?

I don't like it so much. I think a Python class can easily do

```
def __ne__(self, other):
    return not (self == other)
```

And then you're indeed bringing coercion in the story and you're assuming that rich comparisons return `True` or `False` and not something symbolic.
