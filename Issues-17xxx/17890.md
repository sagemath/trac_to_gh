Instead of

```
    def _cmp_(left, right)
    cdef int _cmp_c_impl(left, right) except -2
```
we should have

```
    cpdef int _cmp_(left, right) except -2
```

Analogously for `_richcmp_`.

There is one important functional change: If a Python class defines both `__cmp__` and `_cmp_`, then formerly the coercion framework would use `__cmp__` by default to implement relational operators like `>=`. After this ticket, `_cmp_` will be tried first, which defaults to `__cmp__`.

## sage.structure.element

1. In the documentation of `sage.structure.element` emphasize what should be done for Python classes as well (and the potential difference between Python and Cython). It is not very clear to me! What I understood is that we should:
   - implement `__cmp__(left,right)` or/and `_richcmp_(left,right,op)`
   - avoid `__eq__`, `__ne__`, etc

2. What about putting

```
# Obvious case
if left is right:
    return _rich_to_bool(op, 0)
```
  directly in `__richcmp__`?

## sage.structure.parent

3. The default comparison for parents is by id which is natural (and I guess what Python does). But the default hash is not based on id and is the stupid one inherited from `SageObject`. Is there a reason?

4. Why not using `_rich_to_bool` in `parent.pyx` instead of

```
if op == 0:  #< 
    return r  < 0
elif op == 2: #==
    return r == 0 
elif op == 4: #>
    return r  > 0
elif op == 1: #<=
    return r <= 0
elif op == 3: #!=
    return r != 0
elif op == 5: #>=
    return r >= 0 
```
  And by the way, why is there a method `cdef _rich_to_bool` on element? it would be useful as a standalone function in other places.

I did some experimentations with Python classes. The conclusion is:

     just define `_cmp_` and `_richcmp_` (even though you redefine `__hash__`)

Then:
- rich  comparisons and comparisons work when it involves elements with the same parent (i.e. the newly defined `_cmp_` and `_richcmp_` gets called)
- rich comparisons involving coercion is fine
- comparison involving coercion is **wrong**: if you call `cmp(a,b)` with `a` and `b` between two parents `A` and `B` and a coercion `B -> A` then `Element.__richcmp__` is called instead of `Element.__cmp__`.

Actually, this is not only a bug in Python but also in Cython! I added print statement in each comparisons function in `Element` and see

```
sage: cmp(1,1/3)
Element._richcmp(1,1/3,2)
Element._richcmp(1,1/3,2)
Element._richcmp_(1,1/3,2)
Element._richcmp(1,1/3,0)
Element._richcmp(1,1/3,0)
Element._richcmp_(1,1/3,0)
Element._richcmp(1,1/3,4)
Element._richcmp(1,1/3,4)
Element._richcmp_(1,1/3,4)
1
```

I thought this was not the case for cython classes which redefine `__hash__`! Is it only true for `__richcmp__`?

Sorry, I forgot a `_`. I wanted to say `Element._cmp_`. The default implementation does check whether `__cmp__` is redefined in element classes. This code is called only if `__cmp__` is defined but not `_richcmp_`. And it seems much better to define `_richcmp_` in children classes.

Call it whatever you want: `cmp(a1,a2)` (same type) calls `__cmp__` but `cmp(a,b)` (different types) does not and use `__richcmp__` instead. The consequence is that you might perform three times the coercion while calling `cmp` with elements with different parents!

This is how Python implements `cmp`:

```c
static int
do_cmp(PyObject *v, PyObject *w)
{
    int c;
    cmpfunc f;

    if (v->ob_type == w->ob_type
        && (f = v->ob_type->tp_compare) != NULL) {
        c = (*f)(v, w);
        if (PyInstance_Check(v)) {
            /* Instance tp_compare has a different signature.
               But if it returns undefined we fall through. */
            if (c != 2)
                return c;
            /* Else fall through to try_rich_to_3way_compare() */
        }
        else
            return adjust_tp_compare(c);
    }
    /* We only get here if one of the following is true:
       a) v and w have different types
       b) v and w have the same type, which doesn't have tp_compare
       c) v and w are instances, and either __cmp__ is not defined or
          __cmp__ returns NotImplemented
    */
    c = try_rich_to_3way_compare(v, w);
    if (c < 2)
        return c;
    c = try_3way_compare(v, w);
    if (c < 2)
        return c;
    return default_3way_compare(v, w);
}
```

Note how `tp_compare` is only called if the types of `v` and `w` are equal. If not, `__richcmp__` is used. Only if `__richcmp__` is not implemented, then `__cmp__` is tried after all.

It's an `inline` function, so it won't matter much for performance. `long` is more general than `int`, so if there is ever a use case for a `long`, it will be possible.

9. implementation of `_(rich)cmp`:
   - Why in `_(rich)cmp` it starts with the case `not have_same_parent_c(left,right)` instead of `have_same_parent_c(left,right)`. It would make it more readable the other way around.

```
cdef _richcmp(left, right):
    if have_same_parent_c(left, right):
        return left._richcmp_(<Element>right, op)

    # different parents
    global coercion_model
    cdef int r
    ...
```
- In `return left._(rich)cmp_(<Element>right, op)` is the `<Element>` really needed or usefull?
- could `_left, _right = coercion_model.canonical_coercion(left, right)` be replaced with `left, right = coercion_model.canonical_coercion(left, right)`. As far as I see, there is no need of these extra variables.

10. Could you add some minimal documentation to `_(rich)cmp` and `_(rich)cmp_` like

```
def _richcmp(left, right):
    r"""
    Rich comparisons of elements

    This should not be overriden! To implement comparisons override ``_richcmp_``
    or/and ``_cmp_``.
    """

def _richcmp_(left, right):
    r"""
    Default implementation of rich comparisons for elements

    By default it tries to see if `_cmp_` is implemented otherwise does a
    comparison by id for ``==`` and ``!=``. Calling this default method
    with ``<``, ``<=``, ``>`` or ``>=`` will raise a ``NotImplementedError``.

    EXAMPLES::

        sage: from sage.structure.parent import Parent
        sage: from sage.structure.element import Element
        sage: P = Parent()
        sage: e1 = Element(P); e2 = Element(P)
        sage: e1 == e1    # indirect doctest
        True
        sage: e1 == e2    # indirect doctest
        False
        sage: e1 < e2     # indirect doctest
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        NotImplementedError: comparison not implemented for
        <type 'sage.structure.element.Element'>
    """
```
 and I think that `_cmp_` and `_richcmp_` deserves a sphinx directive to make them appear in the reference manual.

I don't know why it would be more readable, but I can change it.

>   - In `return left._(rich)cmp_(<Element>right, op)` is the `<Element>` really needed or usefull?
 
It's useful for efficiency. Note how `_(rich)cmp_` is declared with `Element right`. By explicitly calling this with `<Element>right`, Cython does not need to check that `right` is indeed an `Element`.

>   - could `_left, _right = coercion_model.canonical_coercion(left, right)` be replaced with `left, right = coercion_model.canonical_coercion(left, right)`. As far as I see, there is no need of these extra variables.
 
Perhaps surprisingly, there is a need at least for an extra variable `_left`. The point is that `left` is a "self" argument which Cython will always assume and require that it is an instance of `Element`.

OK, I made some further changes to `_richcmp`. There is one important functional change: when comparing two elements of the same type but different parents such that no coercion is possible (e.g. vectors over a different finite field), comparison is done by `id` instead of always returning `True` for `__lt__`:

before:

```
sage: v = vector(GF(5), [1])
sage: w = vector(GF(7), [1])
sage: v < w
True
sage: w < v
True
```

after, `id(v)` and `id(w)` are compared.

This caused some doctest failures, which I simply removed (there was not much point in those tests). I also discovered #18308 this way (where there should be a coercion, but there isn't).

Because rich comparison after coercion calls `_richcmp`, not `__richcmp__`. The only reason this works for `Integer` is that `ZZ` has no sub-rings: it is never the common parent of two different parents.

For `Rational` in #18304, a similar argument holds: the only coercion to `QQ` from a Sage `Parent` is from `ZZ`. Since you're not using the coercion framework for this comparison between `Integer` and `Rational`, you're safe.

In other words: both work for very specific reasons, they are not examples to follow.

Right, but `_richcmp` will call `_richcmp_`/`_cmp_`. In Integers (and Rationals after #18304) there is also this `_cmp_` implemented and if everything else failed in `__richcmp__` there is precisely `Element._richcmp(self, other, op)`.

So my mistake, the situation for `ZZ` and `QQ` is a bit different: `Integer/Rational` do not avoid coercion in rich comparisons, they just try to avoid it for most common cases.

Do you have an example of a `Parent` where we want to avoid coercions?

See `src/sage/numerical/linear_functions.pyx` which deals with "symbolic" linear inequalities. Here, `(a <= b) <= c` should construct the symbolic inequality `a <= b <= c`.

I don't like it so much. I think a Python class can easily do

```
def __ne__(self, other):
    return not (self == other)
```

And then you're indeed bringing coercion in the story and you're assuming that rich comparisons return `True` or `False` and not something symbolic.
