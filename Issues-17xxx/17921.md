```
Added `matching_generating_poly`, modified `matching_polynomial`, added an option
to `permanental_minor_polynomial`, which for some graphs is faster than the previous
algorithm.

`matching_generating_poly` computes the matching generating polynomial
on (possibly weighted) graphs; this is used in `permanental_minor_polynomial`.

The algorithm (see [ButPer]) uses polynomials on nilpotent elements,
implemented in the class `Hobj` in matchpoly.pyx.
The idea is that the matching generating polynomial can be computed from
the product of terms
`(1 + x w_{i j} \eta_i \eta_j)`, for all edges `(i, j)`
where `w_{i j}` is the weight of the edge `(i, j)` and `\eta_i^2 = \eta_j^2=0`.
The term `1` corresponds to the absence of the dimer `(i,j)`,
the other term to its presence. A configuration with two adjacent dimers
does not contribute due to nilpotency. The matching generating polynomial
is given by the sum of the coefficients of the non-vanishing products of `\eta`'s.

While the result does not depend on the ordering of the edges in the above
product, the speed of the algorithm depends on the ordering; in fact doing
the above product from left to right, one can set `\eta_i=1` as soon
as `\eta_i` does not appear in the yet unused factors on the right, reducing
in this way the number of terms.
A greedy argument to order edges is contained in active_nodes.py


The Godsil algorithm is faster for small graphs, which take little time
with either algorithms; it becomes progressively slower as the number
of vertices increases; e.g. on my computer
for `graphs.KnightGraph([4, n])`, the Godsil algorithm 
for `n=5` is 25% faster, for `n=6` 5x slower, for `n=9` 4000x slower.

The new algorithm can be much faster than the `rook` algorithm for matching polynomials of bipartite graphs

```
sage: time BipartiteGraph(graphs.LadderGraph(30)).matching_polynomial()[0]
Wall time: 65.7 ms
1346269
```

It is also much faster than the previous algorithm (now called `bipartite`)
for computing the sum of the permanental minors, in the case of randomized band matrices

```
sage: from sage.matrix.matrix_misc import permanental_minor_polynomial
sage: n, w = 20, 3
sage: m = matrix([[i*j + 1 if abs(i-j) <= w else 0 for i in range(n)] for j in range(n)])
sage: a = list(m); shuffle(a); b = zip(*a); shuffle(b); m1 = matrix(b)
sage: time p1 = permanental_minor_polynomial(m1, algorithm='matching')
Wall time: 174 ms
```

<div id="comment:10" align="right">Comment 10</div>

The greedy argument to order edges in active_nodes.py orders edges in such a way that the graph
`G_i` defined by `edges[:i]` has few nodes which have not the same degree as in `G` (active nodes).
This leads to few `\eta_i` in the corresponding polynomial, so there are few terms.
The greedy algorithm adds edges without increasing the number of active nodes, if possible;
otherwise it adds a short path between two active nodes.

This algorithm can be probably improved using some
graph algorithm already in Sage, maybe an algorithm to reorder vertices used to visualize graphs.
