    "body": "1. The documentation of `GenericGraph.__eq__` contains \"For equality, ..., output the same vertex list (in order), ...\". However, since [b59285e6](http://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/commit/?id=b59285e6f9b91f25ee2c77bfe940a45c51b58f80) (Trac #14806: Immutable graph backend), the order of the vertices is no longer checked.

While `GenericGraph.__eq__` no longer takes the ordering of vertices into account, `GenericGraph.__hash__` still does. Consequently graphs that compare equal can have different hashes.\n\n3. For graphs that are not weighted, `GenericGraph.__eq__` ignores the edge labels, while `GenericGraph.__hash__` does not.\n\nItem 3 is most easily shown:\n\n```\nsage: G1 = Graph({0: {1: 'edge label A'}}, immutable=True)\nsage: G2 = Graph({0: {1: 'edge label B'}}, immutable=True)\nsage: G1 == G2\nTrue\nsage: G1.__hash__() == G2.__hash__()\nFalse\n```\n\nFor items 2 and 3, here is some contrived but deterministic code showing that the order is not checked in `.__eq__`, while it is in `.__hash__`:\n\n```python\nimport functools\nfrom sage.graphs.graph import Graph\n\n@functools.total_ordering\nclass C:\n    order = ((0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (1,0))\n    # Hasse diagram:\n    #   0,0 < 0,1\n    #    ^     ^\n    #   1,0 > 1,1\n\n    def __init__(self, x):\n        assert x in self.order\n        self.x = x\n    def __repr__(self):\n        return 'C(%r)' % (self.x,)\n\n    # ordering depends on full self.x\n    def __lt__(self, other):\n        return self.order.index(self.x) < self.order.index(other.x)\n\n    # equality depends only on the second coordinate.\n    def __eq__(self, other):\n        return self.x[1] == other.x[1]\n    def __hash__(self):\n        return hash(self.x[1])\n\n\nG1 = Graph({C((0, 0)): [], C((0, 1)): []}, immutable=True)\nG2 = Graph({C((1, 0)): [], C((1, 1)): []}, immutable=True)\nprint (G1.vertices(), G2.vertices())\nprint G1 == G2\nprint hash(G1) == hash(G2)\n```\n\n```\nsage: %run /tmp/evil2.py\n([C((0, 0)), C((0, 1))], [C((1, 1)), C((1, 0))])\nTrue\nFalse\n```\n\nThe trick in the code above is to obtain lists [x1, y1] and [x2, y2] that compare equal but sort differently.

1. The documentation of `GenericGraph.__eq__` contains "For equality, ..., output the same vertex list (in order), ...". However, since [b59285e6](http://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/commit/?id=b59285e6f9b91f25ee2c77bfe940a45c51b58f80) (Trac #14806: Immutable graph backend), the order of the vertices is no longer checked. So either that check should be reintroduced, or the documentation should be updated.

   The list returned by `.vertices()` is sorted, so that checking the order only affects the result in rare cases. Hence I think updating the documentation should be okay, even while it is technically backwards incompatible.

2. While `GenericGraph.__eq__` no longer takes the ordering of vertices into account, `GenericGraph.__hash__` still does. Consequently graphs that compare equal can have different hashes.

3. For graphs that are not weighted, `GenericGraph.__eq__` ignores the edge labels, while `GenericGraph.__hash__` does not.

Item 3 is most easily shown:

```
sage: G1 = Graph({0: {1: 'edge label A'}}, immutable=True)
sage: G2 = Graph({0: {1: 'edge label B'}}, immutable=True)
sage: G1 == G2
True
sage: G1.__hash__() == G2.__hash__()
False
```

For items 2 and 3, here is some contrived but deterministic code showing that the order is not checked in `.__eq__`, while it is in `.__hash__`:

```python
import functools
from sage.graphs.graph import Graph

@functools.total_ordering
class C:
    order = ((0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (1,0))
    # Hasse diagram:
    #   0,0 < 0,1
    #    ^     ^
    #   1,0 > 1,1

    def __init__(self, x):
        assert x in self.order
        self.x = x
    def __repr__(self):
        return 'C(%r)' % (self.x,)

    # ordering depends on full self.x
    def __lt__(self, other):
        return self.order.index(self.x) < self.order.index(other.x)

    # equality depends only on the second coordinate.
    def __eq__(self, other):
        return self.x[1] == other.x[1]
    def __hash__(self):
        return hash(self.x[1])


G1 = Graph({C((0, 0)): [], C((0, 1)): []}, immutable=True)
G2 = Graph({C((1, 0)): [], C((1, 1)): []}, immutable=True)
print (G1.vertices(), G2.vertices())
print G1 == G2
print hash(G1) == hash(G2)
```

```
sage: %run /tmp/evil2.py
([C((0, 0)), C((0, 1))], [C((1, 1)), C((1, 0))])
True
False
```

The trick in the code above is to obtain lists [x1, y1] and [x2, y2] that compare equal but sort differently. In this case we use [C((0,0)), C((0,1))] and [C((1,0)), C((1,1))].

Such lists also occur naturally, as the code below shows. Here the inequality comparison falls back to comparison of ids, so we just generate objects until the ids are in the unlucky order.

```python
from random import randint
from sage.graphs.graph import Graph

class Foo:
    def __init__(self, b):
        self.b = b
    def __eq__(self, other):
        return self.b == other.b
    def __hash__(self):
        return hash(self.b)
    def __repr__(self):
        return "<foo(%r) at %r>" % (self.b, id(self))

def gen(f):
    print "* Trying to obtain res = [[f(0),f(1)], [f(0),f(1)]] with\n" \
          "  (not res[0][0] < res[0][1]) and (res[1][0] < res[1][1])."
    candidates = [[],[]]
    res = [None, None]
    while res[False] is None or res[True] is None:
        bit = randint(0,1)
        candidates[bit].append( f(bit) )
        for x in candidates[0]:
            for y in candidates[1]:
                res[bool(x < y)] = [x,y]
    print "* Succeeded after %i random picks." \
           % (len(candidates[0]) + len(candidates[1]),)
    print ("* res[0] = %r\n  res[1] = %r") % (res[False], res[True])
    return res

def doit(f):
    print
    print "* f = %r" % (f,)
    res = gen(f)
    print "* For i=0 and i=1 creating graph G[i] with vertices " \
          "res[i] and no edges"
    G = [Graph(dict((x, []) for x in res[bit]), immutable = True)
         for bit in range(2)]
    print "* G[0] = %r\n  G[1] = %r" % (G[0], G[1])
    print "* G[0].vertices() = %r\n  G[1].vertices() = %r" % \
            (G[0].vertices(), G[1].vertices())
    print "*         res[0] == res[1]         : %r" % \
            (res[0] == res[1],)
    print "* sorted(res[0]) == sorted(res[1]) : %r" % \
            (sorted(res[0]) == sorted(res[1]),)
    print "*           G[0] == G[1]           : %r" % (G[0] == G[1],)
    print "*     hash(G[0]) == hash(G[1])     : %r" % \
            (hash(G[0]) == hash(G[1]),)
    print
```

```
sage: %run /tmp/evil.py
sage: doit(Foo)

*           G[0] == G[1]           : True

```

The custom class `Foo` above is not necessary:

```
sage: doit(lambda x: sage.graphs.graph.Graph(x, immutable=True))

* f = <function <lambda> at 0xad1d9e9c>
* Trying to obtain res = [[f(0),f(1)], [f(0),f(1)]] with

<a id='comment:3'></a>Hello !

Thank you for this 'Counter' thing, I did not know that it existed `^^;`

1) About `self.edge_iterator(labels = self._weighted)`:

You can have graphs with edge labels for which _weighted is not True

```
sage: Graph([(1,2,"Hey")])._weighted
False
sage: Graph([(1,2,"Hey")],immutable=True)._weighted
False
```

I do not think that this 'weighted' notion makes a lot of sense anyway, perhaps we should remove it. Either way it is probably best to set 'labels' to `True` anytime.

2) Perhaps I do not understand what your tests do, but even when the graph is immutable the list of vertices returned by `.vertices()` should be sorted. Do you have a counterexample to that ?

  Indeed, we cannot assume that sorting a list produces a unique sorted list (because the order is not always a total order) but that list, however, should be sorted.

  This, because even when the immutable graph is created, the vertices are labelled using the order returned by `.vertices()`. So I hope that you found no bad behaviour there.

  But indeed, wrapping it with a frozenset if the right thing to do.

3) Technically, you do not need to add `._is_weighted` in the hash function, as graphs with different values for `._is_weighted` are nonequal anyway. But that does not hurt either.

4) `O_O`

```
sage: G1 = Graph({0: {1: 'edge label A'}})                
sage: G2 = Graph({0: {1: 'edge label B'}})                
sage: G1 == G2                            
True
```

This is *REALLY* bad ! Graphs with different labels should be non-equal !!! `O_O;;;;;`

But it seems that it has been like that forever... Gosh that's bad `O_o`

Hmmmm.. Now I understand why you added this `self._weighted` in the hash function `:-/`

Indeed you can set edge labels on unweighted graphs, but the documented behaviour is that they are ignored in `__eq__`: "Note that graphs must be considered weighted, or Sage will not pay attention to edge label data in equality testing". Whether edge labels *should* be checked or not, is a different question, that I would like to keep outside the scope of this ticket. Either way, when `__eq__` is true, the hashes have to be the same. So if `__eq__` ignores labels, then so should `__hash__`. I really see no point in ignoring edge labels in `__hash__` when they are not ignored in `__eq__`. I think that would just makes the hash weaker.

No, I do not have a counter example. I might look into it, or not. Either way, I would like to restrict this ticket to the totally ordered case where the axioms for ordering use `is` and not `==`.

When an `is`-based ordering does not respect `==`, such as Python's default ordering using `id`, you can have `a1==a2 and b1==b2` and `a1<b1 and a2>b2` at the same time. Within a single graph this cannot happen as there `a1==a2` implies `a1 is a2` (assuming that the given vertex labels are `==`-distinct). However, it *is* possible to construct *a pair* of graphs using `==`-equal vertex lists that nonetheless have distinct `.vertices()`. This is what happens above.

In the example using `class C`, I have explicitly constructed a comparison that gives such evil results. (Presently I have modified it to obey the axioms of an `is`-based ordering.) In the example using `class Foo`, I show that the problem also occurs with Python's default ordering. Since Python's default ordering depends on `id` over which you have no control, you need a bit of luck. The example using `lambda x: ...`, shows that the behaviour of `class Foo` occurs in the wild.

> 3) Technically, you do not need to add `._is_weighted` in the hash function, as graphs with different values for `._is_weighted` are nonequal anyway. But that does not hurt either.


In `hash(..., self._is_weighted, ...)` I indeed included it redundantly.

According to the documentation the labels are ignored. Let's defer what is right(tm) to a different ticket.

Niiiiiiiiiice `:-P`

Of course, what you do makes sense in that case.

Okay, it took me a while to understand but it seems that to you a 'is-based' ordering when comparison does not yield a total order, and is not necessarily agreeing with '=='. Why not. It has to work in this case too, anyway.

Despite that, I call a list L 'sorted' when applying 'sorted' to L does not change L. Even if the ordering only makes sense to Python. And lists returned by `.vertices()`  should always be sorted in this way. I do not think that it is very bad if it does not hold, but that is how it is meant to work.

I would not have complained even if you had build a class for which `<=` returns a random value `:-P`

> In `hash(..., self._is_weighted, ...)` I indeed included it redundantly.


You were right.

> According to the documentation the labels are ignored. Let's defer what is right(tm) to a different ticket.


Well, I do not think it needs a different ticket. I was surprised, but that's as bad as it got. If it is documented I don't see anything wrong with it. Especially since `is_isomorphic` also ignores edges by default.

The only problem is this 'weighted' keyword. It does not have anything to do with weights, so the keyword is ill-chosen. This can be fixed in another ticket, but there is nothing really urgent to solve either.

<a id='comment:7'></a>Hello again ! 

I see nothing wrong with your code, but I fear that I may be scared of your big doctest in a couple of years if I am still around.

Could you make it more explicit, like 

    Equality and hash do not depend on ordering of vertices (i.e. `G==H` can be true even when `G.vertices()==H.vertices()` is `False`)


Thanks,

Nathann

I can't understand "to you ... with '=='" here. The problem can occur when an `is`-based ordering disagrees with `==`. This can still happen when it is total.

To be precise, the problem occurs when
* there are `x`, `y`, and `z` with `x < y`, `y < z` and `x == z`.
This does not contradict the following axioms of an `is`-based total ordering:
* `x < y and y < z` implies `x < z` for all `x`, `y`, `z`
* for all `x` and `y` exactly one of `x < y`, `x is y`, and `y < x` holds.


> Despite that, I call a list L 'sorted' when applying 'sorted' to L does not change L. Even if the ordering only makes sense to Python.

If sorted only uses `<` and not `==`, and if `<` is an `is`-based total order, then `sorted(sorted(L)) == sorted(L)` is indeed true. So someone should maybe check the implementation of `sorted` to see what comparisons are used.

Okay... your punctuation was a bit strange then: "This is *REALLY* bad ! Graphs with different labels should be non-equal !!! `O_O;;;;;`"

> The only problem is this 'weighted' keyword. It does not have anything to do with weights, so the keyword is ill-chosen. This can be fixed in another ticket, but there is nothing really urgent to solve either.


Agreed.

Okayokay right. So it can happen even when the ordering is total, when `==` does not agree with `<`. Or actually, it happens when `<` is not an order at all.

I expect that it only uses `<` or `<=`.

sage -t src/sage/rings/polynomial/pbori.pyx  # Killed due to segmentation fault

are pbori segfaults, that I also get after reverting my patches for this ticket. The remaining failed doctest is

```
sage -t src/sage/quivers/path_semigroup.py  # 3 doctests failed
```
which is indeed caused by my patches here.

Here is the output:

        A coercion from `A` to `B` exists if the underlying quiver

        """
```

The problem seems to be that `Q1 == Q3` is true while it should be false as the labels ought to be checked. This in turn makes `P1 == P3` true. This didn't register before as the hashes were different, so that the unique representations P1 and P3 also became different.

Running `git grep path_semigroup`, I see that the digraphs on which path_semigroup is called are nowhere 'weighted'. It therefore seems that the people working on quivers assume that edge labels are checked... This is now bug #17092.
