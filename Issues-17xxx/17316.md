The bug is in _hypertest, or rather in the assumption that any isomorphism of the labelled graphs produced by _hypergraph() will also be an isomorphism of the projection matrices up to row/column scaling by -1. I know how to resolve this, but even with the release candidate I cannot develop on Yosemite (I cannot checkout this ticket). So here is my proposed fix, if anyone wants to get it over with right now. Otherwise, you have to wait until the regular development on Yosemite works again.

1) _hypertest, rather than returning True/False, should return an isomorphism or None. I think I would prefer it if the isomorphism is already translated to a map from the groundset of self to the groundset of other.

2) in _fast_isom_test, the final `return self._hypertest(other)' should be replaced with:

m=self._hypertest(other)
if m is None: return False
if self.is_field_isomorphism(other, m): return True

In the remaining case, _fast_isom_test should return None, so that really is the bottom line.

This will solve the issue. Is there a good reason why in _hypergraph, the vertex labels of the graph are not identical to the labels of the matroid ground set? If the `isomorphism' method is an implementation of McKay's algorithm, it may be possible to hand RegularMatroid._is_field_isomorphism down to that routine, and it will look a matroid isomorphism among the graph isomorphisms. That would be an even cleaner alternative solution.




 In addition, I would make the following optimizations:

3) in _invariant: compute the number of negative triangles of the projection matrix and stick that number in the hashed invariant:
P = self._projection()
        A = {}
        B = {}
        N = 0
        for i in xrange(P.nrows()):
            w = P.get_unsafe(i, i)
            if w != 0:
                if w in A:
                    A[w] += 1
                else:
                    A[w] = 1
            for j in xrange(i):
                w = abs(P.get_unsafe(i, j))
                if w != 0:
                    if w in B:
                        B[w] += 1
                    else:
                        B[w] = 1
                    for k in range(j):
                        if P.get_unsafe(i,j)*P.get_unsafe(j,k)*P.get_unsafe(k,i)<0: 
                            N=N+1
        self._r_invariant = hash(tuple([tuple([(w, A[w]) for w in sorted(A)]), tuple([(w, B[w]) for w in sorted(B)]), N]))
        return self._r_invariant

4) In _hypergraph,  these negative triangles themselves could also be added, as in the snippet of `old code'. 

5) _projection: also looks a bit wasteful to me now. det(X)*X.inverse() is just X.adjoint(). So:
if self._r_projection is None:
            R = self._basic_representation()._matrix_()
            self._r_projection = R.transpose() * (R * R.transpose()).adjoint() * R
return self._r_projection

Stefan, I've been using the New Way for some time. 

My problem was and is that I have version of sage (6.3) in which I can communicate with the trac server but cannot compile, and another (6.4rc) in which I can compile but cannot communicate with trac. But I worked around it with a bit of copy-pasting. 

So here is my fix for review. If it fails to compile on 6.3 (I was not able to test that), then I will solve that when 6.4 is out, since this is a terrible way to work. But this code seemed to work fine in the release candidate.
