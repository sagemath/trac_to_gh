Not only is `laguerre(n,x)` not symbolic, a naive implementation is already 2x as fast at `n=100` and 10x at `n=1000`:

```
R.<x> = PolynomialRing(QQ, 'x')
def lag(n):
    return R([binomial(n,k)*(-1)^k/factorial(k) for k in xrange(n+1)])
```

There is a problem: even if I return `SR(ZZ(1))`, it gets converted back somewhere to `Integer(1)`. This will have to be addressed in another ticket.

<a id='comment:23'></a>Squashed it all into one commit. Please note I'll rename `OrthogonalPolynomial` to `OrthogonalFunction` in the other ticket, so I depend on this being merged first. In the end the type problem required a one liner in #17953 and didn't require any forced result conversion to `SR`.

I don't understand what you mean, sorry: I just tried the exact code that I suggested, and it works on all examples in the docstring, except that the result comes out in Horner form (which we could perhaps change if nothing else depends on it or somehow get or get around otherwise). What parents do you have in mind?
