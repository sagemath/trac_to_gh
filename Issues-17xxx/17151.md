Not only is `laguerre(n,x)` not symbolic, a naive implementation is already 2x as fast at `n=100` and 10x at `n=1000`:

```
R.<x> = PolynomialRing(QQ, 'x')
def lag(n):
    return R([binomial(n,k)*(-1)^k/factorial(k) for k in xrange(n+1)])
```

> Let's see if going polynomial really is faster and, if not, do only summing for all parents.

Here's the catch: Using `R(...)` for polynomial creation makes for 5x speedup with `L(1000,x)` and 10x with `L(1000,x^2+x+1)` if `x` is a polynomial generator vs. a symbol. OTOH, summing over monomials is faster with `sum` and this is the only way to get a result for other rings.
> I don't thing we should return `SR(1)` in all cases, but perhaps something like `pushout(QQ, parent(x))`.

There is a problem: even if I return `SR(ZZ(1))`, it gets converted back somewhere to `Integer(1)`. This will have to be addressed in another ticket.

I don't understand what you mean, sorry: I just tried the exact code that I suggested, and it works on all examples in the docstring, except that the result comes out in Horner form (which we could perhaps change if nothing else depends on it or somehow get or get around otherwise). What parents do you have in mind?
