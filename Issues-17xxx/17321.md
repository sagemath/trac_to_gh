With the latest commit in Pynac we now have:

```
sage: ex = sin(x).series(x==0, 3) * x
sage: str(ex)
'x*(1*x + Order(x^3))'
sage: cmp(SR(oo), sqrt(2))
1
sage: bool(SR(oo) < sqrt(2))  
False
sage: bool(SR(oo) > sqrt(2))
False
```
This means there is no longer a runtime error, there is however still code missing in Pynac and Sage to correctly handle these requests (see #12967 and the discussion in #18393).

Wrong, the `cmp` problem still remains...

```
sage: cmp(SR(oo), sqrt(2))
1
sage: cmp(SR(-oo), sqrt(2))
1
sage: cmp(sqrt(2), SR(oo))
1
sage: cmp(sqrt(2), SR(-oo))
1
```
but this is clearly #16397 so this ticket should doctest the `bool` fixes.
