Does it mean that docs are inconsistent for these functions: legendre_P, legendre_Q, gen_legendre_P, gen_Legendre_Q? All of them have the  constraint:

```
Returns the generalized (or associated) Legendre function of the second kind for integers `n>-1`, `m>-1`.
```

I'm using this function in #17151 and so the restriction will fall there as well. You can experiment with what mpmath returns like this in Sage, as long as #17151 is not included:

```
