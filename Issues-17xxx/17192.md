Does it mean that docs are inconsistent for these functions: legendre_P, legendre_Q, gen_legendre_P, gen_Legendre_Q? All of them have the  constraint:

```
Returns the generalized (or associated) Legendre function of the second kind for integers `n>-1`, `m>-1`.
```
or something similar.

I'm using this function in #17151 and so the restriction will fall there as well. You can experiment with what mpmath returns like this in Sage, as long as #17151 is not included:

```
sage: from mpmath import laguerre as lag
sage: lag(1/2,0,1)
mpf('0.42519582689040547')
sage: lag(-1,0,1)
mpf('0.0')
sage: lag(-1+I,0,1)
mpc(real='2.224699152616044', imag='-2.1127345594510065')
sage: lag(1,I,1)
mpc(real='6.3272150395398353e-23', imag='1.0')
