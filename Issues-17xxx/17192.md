Does it mean that docs are inconsistent for these functions: legendre_P, legendre_Q, gen_legendre_P, gen_Legendre_Q? All of them have the  constraint:

```
Returns the generalized (or associated) Legendre function of the second kind for integers `n>-1`, `m>-1`.

BTW, even Laguerre polynomials can have extensions with negative or noninteger `n`, for example mpmath's numeric implementation: https://mpmath.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/build/functions/orthogonal.html#laguerre-polynomials
I'm using this function in #17151 and so the restriction will fall there as well. You can experiment with what mpmath returns like this in Sage, as long as #17151 is not included:

```
sage: from mpmath import laguerre as lag

sage: lag(-1,0,1)

Replying to [@rwst](#comment:10):
> BTW, even Laguerre polynomials can have extensions with negative or noninteger `n`, for example mpmath's numeric implementation: https://mpmath.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/build/functions/orthogonal.html#laguerre-polynomials
> I'm using this function in #17151 and so the restriction will fall there as well. You can experiment with what mpmath returns like this in Sage, as long as #17151 is not included:
> 
> ```
> sage: from mpmath import laguerre as lag
> sage: lag(1/2,0,1)
> mpf('0.42519582689040547')
> sage: lag(-1,0,1)
> mpf('0.0')
> sage: lag(-1+I,0,1)
> mpc(real='2.224699152616044', imag='-2.1127345594510065')
> sage: lag(1,I,1)
> mpc(real='6.3272150395398353e-23', imag='1.0')
> ```

I've played with it a little bit. As far as I understand, there is no way to use negative or non-integer `n` with a current implementation. My question is, is it worth it to support it in this particular code? There is some activity on the general solution already, so probably there is no point in doing such modifications?

I removed some lines that prevented the doc being built. The code passes `make ptestlong` and is straightforward, so it's positive review.
