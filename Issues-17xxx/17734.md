The RealNumber constructor does not respect the specified rounding mode when constructing from a short literal:

```
sage: a = 1.5
sage: RealNumber(a, rnd='RNDU').parent()
Real Field with 53 bits of precision and rounding RNDU
sage: RealNumber(1.5, rnd='RNDU').parent()
Real Field with 53 bits of precision and rounding RNDU
sage: RealNumber(2, rnd='RNDU').parent()
Real Field with 53 bits of precision
```
