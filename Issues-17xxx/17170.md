Seems to work properly in command line and for 2d in the notebook.  It'll be a moment before I can try with 3d (at least jmol, didn't think about tachyon) with the union of this and the new jmol, though the "static" image turned up okay, so I guess this works that way too.

Doesn't

```
if isinstance(obj, SageObject) and hasattr(obj, '_graphics_'):
```
cover both 2d and 3d graphics?  

Also, you probably should do at least a minimal doctest for `sagenb_embedding` and `save_as`.

Finally, what with all the changes to display stuff I think that it would be well worth asking for a little extra testing of any rc for this series *visually*.

Hmm, I have a question here.  Probably due to the change in the way 3d is handled?
* If you make a standard 2d plot like `plot(1-x,(x,0,1))`, evaluate, and then go back to *that same cell* and change it to something else like `plot(1-x^2,(x,0,1))`, the graphic changes.  But:
* Try doing a Jsmol, and then try changing *that* notebook cell and re-evaluating.  If you don't have the "Load 3D Live" checkbox clicked, you'll think you changed it - but you didn't!  As soon as you make it live, it's the exact same one as before.  If you have the live checkbox clicked (this refers to #16004, for those who come new to this) then this is quite obvious.

If it helps, the filenames are definitely changing:
