Seems to work properly in command line and for 2d in the notebook.  It'll be a moment before I can try with 3d (at least jmol, didn't think about tachyon) with the union of this and the new jmol, though the "static" image turned up okay, so I guess this works that way too.

Doesn't

```
if isinstance(obj, SageObject) and hasattr(obj, '_graphics_'):
```
cover both 2d and 3d graphics?  

Also, you probably should do at least a minimal doctest for `sagenb_embedding` and `save_as`.

Finally, what with all the changes to display stuff I think that it would be well worth asking for a little extra testing of any rc for this series *visually*.
