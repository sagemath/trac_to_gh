Seems to work properly in command line and for 2d in the notebook.  It'll be a moment before I can try with 3d (at least jmol, didn't think about tachyon) with the union of this and the new jmol, though the "static" image turned up okay, so I guess this works that way too.

Doesn't

```
if isinstance(obj, SageObject) and hasattr(obj, '_graphics_'):
```
cover both 2d and 3d graphics?  

Also, you probably should do at least a minimal doctest for `sagenb_embedding` and `save_as`.

Finally, what with all the changes to display stuff I think that it would be well worth asking for a little extra testing of any rc for this series *visually*.

I have a feeling that this patch has exposed a latent caching issue (see [this comment](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/16004#comment:118)) in the way the notebook handles the script that actually launches the jmol.  I believe I have two different fixes at that ticket ([here](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/16004#comment:125) and [comment:126:ticket16004 here]), so I think we can go ahead and have people review this - especially it would be helpful for people who have NOT been involved with the jsmol transition to just confirm that this doesn't cause caching problems for 3d plots in the current Sage.

Needs work for the doctesting.
