To be more precise, do use `check_output()` but wrap it in a

```
try:
    ...
except subprocess.CalledProcessError:
    pass

No, that was a mistake. I'm adding an `exec` to the beginning.

> I also wouldn't use `check_output()`: if `git` fails for whatever reason, that shouldn't be a reason to abort doctesting.


I've made the other changes. My only question is, if `git` fails, should we print the error message? That's what happens with the latest branch: it gets printed but not recorded in the log. For example, if I replace `$SAGE_ROOT/.git` with an empty directory, I get

```
Running doctests with ID 2014-10-20-13-02-47-ec16085e.
fatal: Not a git repository: '/Users/palmieri/Desktop/Sage_stuff/git/sage/.git'
Doctesting entire Sage library.
```
Should we suppress the error message altogether, or keep it?
