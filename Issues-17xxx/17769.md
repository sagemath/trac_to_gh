```
From 6.5.rc0 on,

```
    sage -n ipython
```
does no longer work, it starts the sagenb notebook with directory `ipython.sagenb`.

Until 6.5.beta6, this opened the ipython notebook.

`sage -n -h` says:

```
   --notebook [NOTEBOOK], -n [NOTEBOOK], -notebook [NOTEBOOK]
                        The notebook to run [one of: default, ipython,
                        sagenb]. Default is sagenb
```
`sage -h` says

```
  -n, --notebook      -- shortcut for --notebook=default
```

So these two bits of documentation contradict each other and we have a change of
behaviour.

I do not know whether this is intentional, especially after the discussions in #17280
where we broke old behaviour already once.

I guess that this has been introduced in #17685

No, the changes made here only concern the `-n=blah` calls, you can still do ` sage -n=ipython`.

<div id="comment:4" align="right">comment:4</div>

More precisely, the problem is here

```
if [ "$1" = "-notebook" -o "$1" = '--notebook' -o "$1" = '-n' ]; then
    shift
    sage-cleaner >/dev/null 2>&1 &
    exec sage-notebook --notebook=default "$@"
fi
```

It was introduced in https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/487807cdaaa32f8cf8090fa2271d8c5ac762252e

As you can see, the 'default' notebook is explicitly called (consistently with `sage -h`).

Ciao,
Thierry
