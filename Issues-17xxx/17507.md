I cannot find documentation about `InputError`, so `ValueError` is fine. Looking at the trigger condition however

```
                if len(params) + 1 != len(vars):
                    raise ValueError, "Integrand has wrong number of parameters"
```
suggests this is meant to catch problems with the `params` argument to `numerical_integral`. This is not given by the calling `_evalf_` so maybe that should be checked upstream too to honor untold preconditions of `numerical_integral`.

Hello !

I think that this branch is ready to go, but I have a couple of questions to ask (I am new to this code):

- What would you think of an alternative error message: "The function to be integrated depends on 2 variables (x,y), and so cannot be integrated in one dimension. Please fix additional variables with the 'params' argument".

  It took me some time to understand what exactly the problem was with the current error message, because I did not understand what 'parameters' meant.

- It seems dangerous to me that `params` is a list but not a dictionary. It seems difficult for the user to know for sure which variable will receive which value. Isn't that a problem ? Sorry, I really do not know the code.

If you agree to change the error message to the one I proposed, tell me and I will write a commit.

Nathann

Hello,

It is in the new commit.

What would you think of that: `numerical_integral(x*y,0,1,y=3)` ?

The 'dictionary' can also be built from `**args`.

This being said, perhaps the "most simple and clean" prototype would be to refuse input with more than one variables, and ask the user to input:

```
sage: numerical_integral((x*y).subs(y=4),0,1)
(2.0, 2.220446049250313e-14)
```

This would not be very welcoming for beginners, though `:-/`

> So maybe we should at least put a warning in the documentation about this. If you feel up to it, cvould you please?

I would like to fix it, but I do not know if this 'param' argument is not used in other places of the symbolic functions, in which case it would call for a global change. I will write to sage-devel about that in a second.

I set the ticket in its current state as `needs_review`: if we change the way to fix variables in this functions we will do so in another ticket.

Thanks,

Nathann
