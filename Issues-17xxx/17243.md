From #7277 - maybe whenever this is done the symmetry group should also be mentioned in both contexts.

The `vertex_graph` (or perhaps also #17474 digraph) would be useful in this documentation too.

Hi,

The documentation is indeed much better!

And I would put the following inside `EXAMPLES` and not `TESTS`

```
sage: perm4 = polytopes.permutahedron(4)
sage: perm4.graph().is_isomorphic(graphs.BubbleSortGraph(4))
True
```
It is nice to show how to play with these. Usually, I put in `TESTS` only things that are of no interest like

```
sage: for i in range(n):
....:     M = MyObject(i)
....:     assert M.one_way() == M.other_way()
```
or checking ouptut type, or testing some crazy input arguments.

This is too much repetitions for me

```
In total, `B(n)` has order `n!`. Thus, the order
of `B(n)` increases according to `f(n) = n!`. 
```

In terms of info this is indeed a great improvement, for the record, thanks!

I'm going to assume that it is indeed multiplication on the right and not the left - which one is which for permutations always forces me to sit down and write out an example.

Finally,

```

This failure, which should be rather easy to fix, has nothing whatsoever to do with this branch. Some other branch has changed the docstring for `is_prime` in `src/sage/rings/integer.pyx` and this is the fallout.

EDIT: And by "some other branch" I mean a branch not yet in develop, as the test runs fine for me. Please check your merge!
