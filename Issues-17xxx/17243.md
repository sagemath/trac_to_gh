From #7277 - maybe whenever this is done the symmetry group should also be mentioned in both contexts.

The `vertex_graph` (or perhaps also #17474 digraph) would be useful in this documentation too.

<a id='comment:15'>Comment 15:</a>
Hi,

The documentation is indeed much better!

And I would put the following inside `EXAMPLES` and not `TESTS`

```
sage: perm4 = polytopes.permutahedron(4)
sage: perm4.graph().is_isomorphic(graphs.BubbleSortGraph(4))
True
```
It is nice to show how to play with these. Usually, I put in `TESTS` only things that are of no interest like

```
sage: for i in range(n):
....:     M = MyObject(i)
....:     assert M.one_way() == M.other_way()
```
or checking ouptut type, or testing some crazy input arguments.

This is too much repetitions for me

```
In total, `B(n)` has order `n!`. Thus, the order
of `B(n)` increases according to `f(n) = n!`. 
```

In terms of info this is indeed a great improvement, for the record, thanks!

I'm going to assume that it is indeed multiplication on the right and not the left - which one is which for permutations always forces me to sit down and write out an example.

Finally,

```

File "src/sage/sets/set_from_iterator.py", line 443, in sage.sets.set_from_iterator.Decorator._sage_doc_
Failed example:
    print sage_getdoc(d)   # indirect doctest
Expected:
       Test whether "self" is prime.
    ...
       IMPLEMENTATION: Calls the PARI "isprime" function.
    <BLANKLINE>
Got:
       Test whether "self" is prime.
    <BLANKLINE>
       INPUT:
    <BLANKLINE>
       * "proof" -- Boolean or "None" (default). If False, use a strong
         pseudo-primality test (see "is_pseudoprime()"). If True, use a
         provable primality test.  If unset, use the "default arithmetic
         proof flag".
    <BLANKLINE>
       Note: Integer primes are by definition *positive*! This is
         different than Magma, but the same as in PARI. See also the
         "is_irreducible()" method.
    <BLANKLINE>
       EXAMPLES:
    <BLANKLINE>
          sage: z = 2^31 - 1
          sage: z.is_prime()
          True
          sage: z = 2^31
          sage: z.is_prime()
          False
          sage: z = 7

    <BLANKLINE>
       When starting Sage the arithmetic proof flag is True. We can change
       it to False as follows:
    <BLANKLINE>
          sage: proof.arithmetic()
          True
          sage: n = 10^100 + 267

          5 loops, best of 3: 163 ms per loop
          sage: proof.arithmetic(False)
          sage: proof.arithmetic()
          False
          sage: timeit("n.is_prime()")  # not tested
          1000 loops, best of 3: 573 us per loop
    <BLANKLINE>
       ALGORITHM:
    <BLANKLINE>
       Calls the PARI "isprime" function.

This failure, which should be rather easy to fix, has nothing whatsoever to do with this branch. Some other branch has changed the docstring for `is_prime` in `src/sage/rings/integer.pyx` and this is the fallout.

EDIT: And by "some other branch" I mean a branch not yet in develop, as the test runs fine for me. Please check your merge!
