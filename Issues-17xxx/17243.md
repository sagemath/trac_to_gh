Hi,

The documentation is indeed much better!

And I would put the following inside `EXAMPLES` and not `TESTS`

```
sage: perm4 = polytopes.permutahedron(4)
sage: perm4.graph().is_isomorphic(graphs.BubbleSortGraph(4))
True
```
It is nice to show how to play with these. Usually, I put in `TESTS` only things that are of no interest like

```
sage: for i in range(n):
....:     M = MyObject(i)
....:     assert M.one_way() == M.other_way()
```
or checking ouptut type, or testing some crazy input arguments.

This is too much repetitions for me

```
In total, `B(n)` has order `n!`. Thus, the order
of `B(n)` increases according to `f(n) = n!`. 
```

In terms of info this is indeed a great improvement, for the record, thanks!

I'm going to assume that it is indeed multiplication on the right and not the left - which one is which for permutations always forces me to sit down and write out an example.

Finally,

       When starting Sage the arithmetic proof flag is True. We can change
       it to False as follows:
    <BLANKLINE>
          sage: proof.arithmetic()
          True
          sage: n = 10^100 + 267
          sage: timeit("n.is_prime()")  # not tested
          5 loops, best of 3: 163 ms per loop
          sage: proof.arithmetic(False)
          sage: proof.arithmetic()
          False
          sage: timeit("n.is_prime()")  # not tested
          1000 loops, best of 3: 573 us per loop
    <BLANKLINE>
       ALGORITHM:
    <BLANKLINE>
       Calls the PARI "isprime" function.

This failure, which should be rather easy to fix, has nothing whatsoever to do with this branch. Some other branch has changed the docstring for `is_prime` in `src/sage/rings/integer.pyx` and this is the fallout.

EDIT: And by "some other branch" I mean a branch not yet in develop, as the test runs fine for me. Please check your merge!
