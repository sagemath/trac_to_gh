So we have the [permutahedron](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/geometry/sage/geometry/polyhedron/library.html#sage.geometry.polyhedron.library.Polytopes.permutahedron) and we have the [bubble sort graph](https://mvngu.googlecode.com/hg/onepage/sage/graphs/graph_generators/sage.graphs.graph_generators.GraphGenerators.BubbleSortGraph.html).  But the BSG is the skeleton of the P.  So at least in the documentation these should be connected.

From #7277 - maybe whenever this is done the symmetry group should also be mentioned in both contexts.

The `vertex_graph` (or perhaps also #17474 digraph) would be useful in this documentation too.

Hi,

The documentation is indeed much better!

And I would put the following inside `EXAMPLES` and not `TESTS`

```
sage: perm4 = polytopes.permutahedron(4)
sage: perm4.graph().is_isomorphic(graphs.BubbleSortGraph(4))
True
```
It is nice to show how to play with these. Usually, I put in `TESTS` only things that are of no interest like

```
sage: for i in range(n):
....:     M = MyObject(i)
....:     assert M.one_way() == M.other_way()
```
or checking ouptut type, or testing some crazy input arguments.

This is too much repetitions for me

```
In total, `B(n)` has order `n!`. Thus, the order
of `B(n)` increases according to `f(n) = n!`. 
```

In terms of info this is indeed a great improvement, for the record, thanks!

I'm going to assume that it is indeed multiplication on the right and not the left - which one is which for permutations always forces me to sit down and write out an example.

Finally,

```

          sage: z = 2^31 - 1
          sage: z.is_prime()
          True
          sage: z = 2^31
          sage: z.is_prime()
          False
          sage: z = 7
          sage: z.is_prime()
          True
          sage: z = -7
          sage: z.is_prime()
          False
          sage: z.is_irreducible()
          True
    <BLANKLINE>
          sage: z = 10^80 + 129
          sage: z.is_prime(proof=False)

          sage: z.is_prime(proof=True)
          True
    <BLANKLINE>
       When starting Sage the arithmetic proof flag is True. We can change
       it to False as follows:
    <BLANKLINE>
          sage: proof.arithmetic()
          True
          sage: n = 10^100 + 267
          sage: timeit("n.is_prime()")  # not tested
          5 loops, best of 3: 163 ms per loop
          sage: proof.arithmetic(False)
          sage: proof.arithmetic()
          False
          sage: timeit("n.is_prime()")  # not tested
          1000 loops, best of 3: 573 us per loop
    <BLANKLINE>
       ALGORITHM:
    <BLANKLINE>
       Calls the PARI "isprime" function.
    <BLANKLINE>

This failure, which should be rather easy to fix, has nothing whatsoever to do with this branch. Some other branch has changed the docstring for `is_prime` in `src/sage/rings/integer.pyx` and this is the fallout.

EDIT: And by "some other branch" I mean a branch not yet in develop, as the test runs fine for me. Please check your merge!
