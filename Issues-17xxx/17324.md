Currently the following code fails because eq is inherited from somewhere else.

```
P.<x,y,z> = ProjectiveSpace(QQ,2)
H=Hom(P,P)
f = H([x^2 - 2*x*y + z*x, z^2 -y^2 , 5*z*y])
f.dehomogenize(2).homogenize(2)==f
```

Actually, it seems that eq and ne are not well done in projective_morphism either (the doc tests test the wrong functionality and it returns an error if the coordinates rings are different).
