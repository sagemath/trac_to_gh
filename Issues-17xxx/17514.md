Comments on the attached branch:
- Setting `MAKE="make -j1"` in `spkg-install` does not seem necessary; I tested this twice with `make -j12` on a multiprocessor system.
- The trick in `spkg-install` of touching `.info` files to avoid running `makeinfo` does not seem to work anymore.  The system I tested this on does not have `makeinfo`, which led to the new patch `makeinfo.patch`.  (If `makeinfo` is not found, then `$MAKEINFO` is set to `missing --run makeinfo`, which just touches the existing `.info` file.)
- `compile.patch` is superseded by an upstream fix (http://sourceforge.net/p/maxima/bugs/2848/).
