The method `DirichletCharacter.values()` is rather complicated.  The goal of this ticket is to simplify it a bit, and in particular to remove the check for the trivial character.  It turns out that checking for the trivial character costs more time than is gained by the faster code for this case.  This yields a speedup of about 20% in the following example:

```
sage: %timeit -n 1 -r 1 -c [[chi.values() for chi in DirichletGroup(n)] for n in xrange(1, 100)]
```

Depends on #17317

Unfortunately the current version gives a 50% slowdown (from 3 seconds to 4.5 seconds) for the following command:

```
sage: %timeit -n 1 -r 1 -c [[chi.values() for chi in DirichletGroup(n)]
....:                       for n in xrange(1, 100)]
```
This seems to be caused by an overdose of Python `map` and `lambda` constructions.
