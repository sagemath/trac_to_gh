It's to allow `with StdOutContext(...) as ...` as opposed to just `with StdOutContext(...)`.

So it's covered by this doctest change:

```diff
-sage: with StdOutContext(gp):
-...       gp('1+1')
-...
+sage: with StdOutContext(Gp()) as g:
+....:     g('1+1')
```

I'm not aware of any general rule that tests should pass when run with `./sage -t --optional=octave`. I prefer to have as few tests as possible optional.

Replying to [@jdemeyer](#comment%3A8):
> I'm not aware of any general rule that tests should pass when run with `./sage -t --optional=octave`.

What is the point of having an option `--optional=octave` that does not imply `--optional=sage`, then?

> I prefer to have as few tests as possible optional.

I agree in principle, but here I don't think the example without its `optional` part is a meaningful test case.

Anyway, I'm fine with leaving that change out if you prefer.
