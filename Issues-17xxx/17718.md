It's to allow `with StdOutContext(...) as ...` as opposed to just `with StdOutContext(...)`.

So it's covered by this doctest change:

```diff
-sage: with StdOutContext(gp):
-...       gp('1+1')
-...
+sage: with StdOutContext(Gp()) as g:
+....:     g('1+1')
```

I'm not aware of any general rule that tests should pass when run with `./sage -t --optional=octave`. I prefer to have as few tests as possible optional.

What is the point of having an option `--optional=octave` that does not imply `--optional=sage`, then?

> I prefer to have as few tests as possible optional.


I agree in principle, but here I don't think the example without its `optional` part is a meaningful test case.

Anyway, I'm fine with leaving that change out if you prefer.

Are you really sure that this is caused by this ticket? The point is that this ticket is really a clean-up ticket, with almost no functional changes.
