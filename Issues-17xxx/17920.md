This fixes #17548.

It also adds new features to `IntegerLists`:

1. Negative integers are allowed (but the default still is `min_part=0`).

2. There does not need to be a fixed sum, one can do for example `IntegerLists(max_part=2)` for all lists of integers <= 2. One can also give a lower/upper bound for the sum.

Note that the current implementation requires, for a given length, that there are only finitely many lists of that length. This limitation could be lifted in the future.

This now seems to work reasonably well. Not yet ready, but good enough for example to compare with the existing implementation. That's how I found all the bugs at #17548.

Due to the polyhedra overhead, it is generally (a lot) slower than the existing code.

Is it worth changing this branch so that it changes the existing code instead of adding a new file ? As you said: let's be correct first, *then* fast.

Do you have some timings?

Also, both of these are wrong:

```
sage: Compositions(3, max_length=2, inner=[1,1,1]).list()
[]
sage: Compositions(10, outer=[4], inner=[1,1]).list()
[]
```
The first should be `[[2, 1], [1, 2]]` since the `inner` (or `outer`) are not related to the min or max lengths. For the second, the inner composition is extendedby the minimum part, so there are many such compositions, such as `[4,6]`, `[2,8]`, etc.

Jeroen compiled many related bugs in the description of #17548.

> Minimal slowdowns are okay (IMO), but significant slowdowns are unacceptable.


Significant slowdown can be a problem, that's for sure. If they turn out to be our only way to have a code which does not return wrong results, however, we will learn to live with them.

The name is now `IntegerLists` and I do provide `IntegerListsLex` for "backwards compatibility" which does sort.

Since the documentation of neither `Partitions` nor `Compositions` says anything about the order, I think it's allowed to change the order.

Dear Jeroen,

Thanks a lot for taking action! It's definitely a good thing to have a
good connection between ``IntegerListLex`` and ``Polyhedron``, as
there is some non trivial overlap. The main differences is that
``IntegerListLex`` was specifically designed for allowing for
(essentially) Constant Amortized Time lexicographic Iteration in
almost constant memory, which is an important feature.

So I can see a work path along the following lines:

- Get this ticket in to have a robust implementation of list

- Completely rewrite the current ``IntegerListLex`` iterator to be
  robust (it's definitely possible); keep the Polyhedron
  implementation for testing purposes as well as for counting, ...

- Optimize the iterator (Cythonization, using ClonableIntArray, ...).

Please do not change the enumeration order, at least as default: quite
some code depends on it (I agree, this should be made explicit in the
documentation). The proposed generalizations (n in a range, negative
entries) are fine since the iterator could be made to handle them.

Cheers,
                       Nicolas

> Please do not change the enumeration order, at least as default

I disagree with this: the default should be "do not sort, return stuff in the fastest possible way". Sorting an iterator is very expensive and should only be done if really needed.

> quite some code depends on it

Is that really true? The only doctest failures that I saw where "obvious" failures where some list order changed, I didn't see anything subtle.

Hello,

True. This being said, your polyhedron code may very well be 'all we can do' to implement this feature while handling all possible combinations of parameters.

> Profiling shows that a lot of time is spent in just *constructing* the polyhedra


True. Do you have any idea where that comes from ? I had similar troubles with the Poset constructor (related to memory usage).

It's just PPL.

Interestingly, arithmetic with infinity also shows up quite high in the profiling reports (up to 10% of the time), so optimizing `src/sage/rings/infinity.py` will also give some speedup.

Aahahah. Yaeh, Vincent has been fighting a lot with some abstractions we have, which makes code run *much* slower. For `+oo` he advises to solve the problem by using float("inf") instead of Infinity. It is *MUCH* faster.

At some point he got some crazy somewhere by adding 'from math import sqrt' in a module to overwrite Sage's sqrt function.

```
sage: IntegerLists(10^100, max_length=1).list()

For IntegerList itself, any default is fine, and sorting is certainly
very bad. But for Partitions, Compositions, ... users are really
expecting lexicographic order. Besides, this is only a temporary
solution, and we will switch back to lexicographic once we have a
proper implementation of IntegerListLex.

That's a point indeed; my feeling is that we have been lucky, although
it could be that some changes w.r.t. MuPAD-Combinat makes the code
less dependent on that feature.  I am worried by user's personal code
out there. Well, if you are willing to help those guys ...

Agreed, especially if we further go parallel: counting through
polyhedral methods only becomes relevant for relatively large
polyhedron. But this would be a very useful feature. So count
would eventually have some threshold to choose between the
two methods. 

By the way: we don't yet use Barvinok-like algorithms for counting
(e.g. through LattE), or do we? This could make a difference too.

I just read the first paragraph of the LattE manual and it does **exactly** what we need for counting:

```
1.1    What is LattE?

The name “LattE” is an abbreviation for “Lattice point Enumeration.” LattE
was developed in 2001 to count lattice points contained in convex polyhedra
defined by linear equations and inequalities with integer coefficients. The poly-
hedra can be of any (reasonably small) dimension.
```

Well, certainly for `Compositions`, the current order is not defined:

```
sage: Compositions(2).list()
[[1, 1], [2]]
sage: Compositions(2, max_slope=0).list()
[[2], [1, 1]]
```

Yes indeed! See also #15180.

Btw: in case this could be useful, the developers are in Davis where I
currently am for the upcoming Sage Days 64.

For which applications does this really matter?

I know that's how partitions are traditionally written down and how things are done in Sage historically. But I don't think that's enough reason to not change it, especially given the fact that the documentation doesn't say anything about the order. Any order of the list of partitions is a good answer mathematically.

To be honest, I don't know what you mean mathematically. But, like I said, the fact that there are no strange doctest failures shows that the issue cannot be so serious.

And in the cases where the order really matters, I think those places should simply explicitly sort or use `IntegerListsLex`. Slowing down all of `Paritions()` just because one or two applications require it seems stupid.

This might be an issue though

```
sage: S=SymmetricGroup(3)
sage: S.character_table()
[ 1 -1  1]
[ 2  0 -1]
[ 1  1  1]
sage: type(S.character_table())
<type 'sage.matrix.matrix_cyclo_dense.Matrix_cyclo_dense'>
```
The character table should really be indexed by partitions (or conjugacy classes of S_n).
So the meaning of the matrix changes if the order of the list of partitions changes.

Moreover, counting the points is faster than enumerating the points; there could be exponentially many points to count, but still the number of them is only polynomial in the input size, for fixed dimension, and LattE provides a truly polynomial-time procedure for this counting.

why not several iterators on the same class? (with a reasonable one by default in `__iter__`).

+1 to sharing code between the classes; in fact I had put a mental
note on doing this when I offered to do the merge :-)

Having a class that can handle any set of constraints, even if it does
only containment check, would be useful. We would need this in
particular to properly refactor integer vectors.

I am not sure whether we want a single class, or two classes:

```
class IntegerLists:
    __iter__ -> __iter__ on the polyhedron

class IntegerListsLex(IntegerLists):
```

With the second one having the additional specification that the
enumeration shall be lexicographic.

Thoughts?

Cheers,
