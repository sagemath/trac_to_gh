The following bug seems to be somewhat subtle; for example, the wrong result does not arise when using the polynomial ring instead of its fraction field, or when changing the ordering of the pair `t`.

```
sage: K.<x> = FractionField(QQ['x'])
sage: m = Matrix([[1], [x]])
sage: t = (m, m.echelon_form())
sage: s = dumps(t)
sage: t
(
[1]  [1]
[x], [0]
)
sage: loads(s)  # wrong, should be the same as above
(
[1]
[x], [1, x]
)
```

I suspect it was fixed by the upgrade to Python 2.7.12 in Sage 7.5.rc0, more specifically [Python issue 892902](https://bugs.python.org/issue892902).
