```
The function `test_relation_maxima` calls a list of simplifications to deduce whether or not a relationship is satisfied:

```
#Try to apply some simplifications to see if left - right == 0
    simp_list = [difference.simplify_log, difference.simplify_rational, difference.simplify_exp,difference.simplify_radical,difference.simplify_trig]
```

We've recently deprecated the name `simplify_radical` function (see #11912) since it doesn't really simplify and can give incorrect answers. For the same reason, we probably shouldn't rely on it in `test_relation_maxima`.

I'll have a patch for this as soon as I can come up with some test cases where it currently does something weird.

The first test case that I came up with reminded me that `simplify_log` has the same problem -- we just don't see it very often because it's neutered a bit within `simplify_full`. So that's been removed from the list as well, but I added two other simplifications that should be safe.
