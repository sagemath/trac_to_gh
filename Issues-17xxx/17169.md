What happens is that GCC builds stage 2 with debug symbols, stage 3 without debug symbols. Then GCC checks that the code is identical using some tools from binutils. This checks are indeed broken on some systems.

The line in `spkg-install`

```
# Disable bootstrap-debug, since it doesn't work on an OS X 10.4 PPC
# machine, nor on some Solaris machine. bootstrap-debug only does
# additional checks during the build, so it is safe not to use it.
MAKE="$MAKE BUILD_CONFIG="
```
is supposed to disable that, but apparently this disabling no longer works.

It seems that this line is the culprit in this case, somehow disabling bootstrap-debug (if this is still actually disabling it) is now breaking the build.

The object files from stage 2 and 3 have the same size for me. That is, before stripping the size is the same, after stripping the size is the same, but stripping reduces the size. They compare identical after stripping. The difference is not in something that is human-readable (at least not to me ;-)

Confirmed. I tried a few things but I completely missed that line. That takes my number 2 spot in the "configuration option that leads to a build of gcc to fail" [my number one spot can be summarised with "it fails in stage 1 when I change the installation prefix (yes I mean --prefix=...)"].

I am relieved that clang++ is enough to build gcc 4.8+.

Why not going to 4.9.x was one of the question I had when first seeing the ticket. For reference the bug for building on yosemite on gcc's bugzilla. The fix is merged in trunk along with a couple of other stuff that we probably don't care much about, but it will be in 4.9.2 and 5.0. I think this is ready for review.

I presume it is related to libdispatch (brand name "Grand Central Dispatch"). I can't imagine that python is actually using it at all. (Also, I think we should move the ugly hack to the python spkg, since that seems to be the affected package.)

With the `-O0` I get stage 2/3 comparison failures. Its also somewhat off the beaten path, and less tested = less likely to work.

There is no patch applied, the tarball is 100% vanilla.

I tested it on the mac in my office, which happens to be the only osx buildbot that we have.

As far as I know you only need a C++ compiler, but then I don't even know of a C++ compiler that not also supports C. Certainly none that can bootstrap GCC.
