Hello,

Don't you want to group together the PBD constructions? Right now, some are contained in `bibd.py` and the others in `resolvable_bibd.py`.

I don't have a very strong preference for one or the other. Right now there is no PBD file nor PBD constructor, so we do not care much. Also the point of these constructions is that this specific PBD if somehow equivalent to KTS, so it makes sense to store them together.

Let's keep it like that until we have a real reason to move them together. Like a PBD constructor.

Hi Nathann,

I did not feel very well with one line which mixes `sorted`, `enumerate` and `set`. I propose a commit to split them into several lines. Doing so, the code is also faster since there is less copy and sort.

What do you think?
