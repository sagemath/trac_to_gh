Hello,

Don't you want to group together the PBD constructions? Right now, some are contained in `bibd.py` and the others in `resolvable_bibd.py`.

Hi Nathann,

I did not feel very well with one line which mixes `sorted`, `enumerate` and `set`. I propose a commit to split them into several lines. Doing so, the code is also faster since there is less copy and sort.

What do you think?
