This works:

```
sage: var('x')
x
sage: sage.crypto.gen_lattice(type='ideal', seed=42, quotient=x^4-1)
[11  0  0  0  0  0  0  0]
[ 0 11  0  0  0  0  0  0]
[ 0  0 11  0  0  0  0  0]
[ 0  0  0 11  0  0  0  0]
[ 4 -2 -3 -3  1  0  0  0]
[-3  4 -2 -3  0  1  0  0]
[-3 -3  4 -2  0  0  1  0]
[-2 -3 -3  4  0  0  0  1]
```

But this should also work:

```
sage: R.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: sage.crypto.gen_lattice(type='ideal', seed=42, quotient=x^4-1)

In the patch you add

```python
assert P.base_ring() is ZZ_q
```

I was under the impression we are encouraged to avoid `assert` unless it's really a bug in the program we are checking for.

Absolutely! You must only use `assert` to check for bugs, not for bad user input.
