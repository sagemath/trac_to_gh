If `P` is a lattice -- not just a poset -- then also `P.dual()` returns lattice. But `P.product(P)` gives poset, not lattice. Also at least `product` forgots facade, i.e. if `P=Poset({0:[1]}, facade=False)`, then `P.Product(P)` has elements of type plain 'tuple'. `subposet()` seems to work, `relabel` does not.

Functions should be checked one by one for this. This needs also some thinking: for example dual of meet-semilattice is join-semilattice.

Yo !

It looks good but instead of 

```
if A:
  return C1(<long things>)
if B:
  return C2(<long things>)
```
You can do

```
if A:
   constructor = C1
elif B:
   constructor = C2
return constructor(<long things>)
```

Good idea. Done this.

`relabel()` also remembers `facade` option. What should `product()` do? Have an optional `facade=` -parameter, or make facade poset (or lattice) if `self` is  facade posets, or if both `self` and `other` are?

Hello !

There was a broken doctest in src/sage/categories/finite_posets.py so I added a commit. If this is fine for you, you can set the ticket to `positive_review`.
