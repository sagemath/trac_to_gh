Add the option `-dumpversion` to the Sage command line to print **only** the Sage version

```
$ sage -version
Sage Version 6.6.beta1, Release Date: 2015-02-21
$ sage -dumpversion
6.6.beta1
```
We also simplify the `sage -version` part by reading the file `sage-version.sh` instead of parsing `sage-banner`!!
