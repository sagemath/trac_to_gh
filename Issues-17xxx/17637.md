In the code, it is said that the constraints are "assumed to be correct". I have no idea what happens if `min_slope` is not defined by `max_slope` is, or `max_part` or anything.  If you believe that there is a situation in which the code will never return anything wrong you can adapt the error message.

Dear Anne,

> As far as I can see from #17548 there are actually no known bugs with regards to IntegerListsLex.


What about those examples from #17548 ?

```
sage: Partitions(5, min_slope=1).list()
ValueError: [2, 4] is not a valid partition
sage: IntegerListsLex(5, length=3, max_slope=0).list()   # 0 is allowed in the partition
[[5, 0, 0], [4, 1, 0], [3, 2, 0], [3, 1, 1], [2, 2, 1]]
sage: IntegerListsLex(5, max_slope=0).list()             # now its not
[[5], [4, 1], [3, 2], [3, 1, 1], [2, 2, 1], [2, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]]
```

I will answer other points on #17898.

Read the answers that Travis gave on that ticket. They are consistent with the specifications or bad user input.
