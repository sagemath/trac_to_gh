it would be useful to be able to write -C and -F
for the cone obtained by negating the rays of a cone, and same for a fan.

Thanks for your quick reaction.

I think I have taken care of point 1.

Concerning point 2, I am not sure to see the point. It seems that the current code does work. Could you give me a case where the opposite fan or cone (as build now) misbehaves ?

By the way, I would love to have a method to obtain the common refinment of two fans. Do you see an easy way to do that using existing code ?

Then the domain `fan3` of the resulting `FanMorphism` will be the minimal subdivision. It may be nice to implement a method `fan1.common_refinement(fan2)` returning such a fan after constructing an opposite morphism as well (this will ensure common support, I am not sure how to check it otherwise except for the case of complete fans which should be handled separately for efficiency).",

<a id='comment:7'>**Comment 7:**</a>
Looks good now.

For fan refinement: assuming they have the same support, you can map `fan1` to `fan2` by the identity map and allow domain subdivision. Then the domain `fan3` of the resulting `FanMorphism` will be the minimal subdivision. It may be nice to implement a method `fan1.common_refinement(fan2)` returning such a fan after constructing an opposite morphism as well (this will ensure common support, I am not sure how to check it otherwise except for the case of complete fans which should be handled separately for efficiency).
