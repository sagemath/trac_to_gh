The right action of matrices on free modules (= applying a change of basis to the ambient space) is implemented incorrectly:

```
sage: V = GF(2)^2
sage: W = V.subspace([[1, 0]])
sage: x = matrix(GF(2), [[1, 1], [0, 1]])
sage: W*x
Vector space of degree 2 and dimension 1 over Finite Field of size 2
Basis matrix:
[1 0]
```

Yes, that is the expected behaviour: with `x*W` the matrix `x` acts on the row vectors forming the echelon basis of `W`, so its number of columns has to be equal to the rank of `W`.  For example:

```
sage: V = GF(2)^2
sage: W = V.subspace([[1, 0]])
sage: x = matrix(GF(2), [[1], [1]])
sage: x*W
Vector space of degree 2 and dimension 1 over Finite Field of size 2
Basis matrix:
[1 0]
sage: y = matrix(GF(2), [[0]])
sage: y*W
Vector space of degree 2 and dimension 0 over Finite Field of size 2
Basis matrix:
[]
```
