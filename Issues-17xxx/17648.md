```
The following functions do not depend on the parameters given to the `Partitions` constructor:

```
from_frobenius_coordinates
from_beta_numbers
from_exp
from_zero_one
from_core_and_quotient
```

Example:

```
sage: Partitions(5,length=2).from_frobenius_coordinates(([6,3,2],[4,1,0]))
# does not read the input of Partition at all
[7, 5, 5, 1, 1]
```

They should belong to `Partitions_all`, and thise branch moves them there.

Hello,

> What are "those functions"? Can you be more specific in your ticket description?


My excuses. I thought that this would be clear from the diff, but when you reverse A and B in a file, it is true that git can chose to "remove A and add it somewhere else" or "remove B and add it somewhere else". I just updated the description to say that the three functions I moved are the following:

```
from_frobenius_coordinates
from_beta_numbers
from_exp
from_zero_one
from_core_and_quotient
```

> Also, it looks like you just moved code. Is that what you intended? No new tests etc??


I did not think that there was any need to. The doctests were correct and called `Partitions().from_...`. That command remains valid. On the other hand, `Partition(5).from_...` is now invalid.
