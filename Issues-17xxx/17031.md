Replying to [@vbraun](#comment%3A5):
> Its Robert's git integration bot. I'm assuming (hoping) that he will eventually implement the pushing of the branch and setting of the ticket metadata on trac...  Right now the github tickets cannot be merged.

That was implemented, but something on trac changed in the meantime that broke it (xml-rpc returns "pop() takes at most 1 argument (2 given)' while executing 'ticket.update()" if you try to set the commit hash manually). Should work again now (so much for my hundred day uptime...).
