The `simplify_log()` function should only be called when the expression is real, and I just noticed this isn't documented. For an example, take:

```
sage: x,y = SR.var('x,y')
sage: f = log(x*y) - (log(x) + log(y))
sage: f(x=-1, y=i)
-2*I*pi
sage: f.simplify_log()
0
```

The documentation does say what it will do, so if you know that the real log identities don't hold over the complex numbers, then it's documented. But I think it's better to warn explicitly.
