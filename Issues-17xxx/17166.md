```
This works fine:

```
sage: CC(complex('13.8+6.2j'))
13.8000000000000 + 6.20000000000000*I
sage: CDF(complex('13.8+6.2j'))
13.8 + 6.2*I
```

However, it is a *conversion* while it should be a *coercion*.

```
sage: CC.has_coerce_map_from(complex)
False
```
This is inconsistent with

```
sage: CC.has_coerce_map_from(float)
True
```

Coercion goes both ways in this case (CDF -> CC and CC -> CDF), so the result is the same really. Interestingly, this has the following consequence:

```
sage: Sequence([CDF(1), CC(1)]).parent()
Category of sequences in Complex Double Field
sage: Sequence([CC(1), CDF(1)]).parent()
Category of sequences in Complex Field with 53 bits of precision
```

Let me know what you think, if you think the coercion should be added to `ComplexDoubleField._coerce_map_from()`, I could do that.

Having a coercion `complex -> CDF` and `CDF -> CC` but not `complex -> CC` sounds strange to me (isn't coercion supposed to be transitive?). Moreover, that would be inconsistent with

```
sage: RR.has_coerce_map_from(float)
True
sage: RDF.has_coerce_map_from(float)
True
```

Whatever the outcome of this ticket is, the behaviour of `complex / CDF / CC` should be the same as `float / RDF / RR`.

I would prefer `CDF -> ComplexField(53)` simply because there are numbers in `CC` which cannot be represented in `CDF`:

```
sage: CC(1e1000)
1.00000000000000e1000
sage: CDF(1e1000)
+infinity
```
