See [this sage-support thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-support/lGGO_q_NVzg) for details.

```
sage: N(integral(1/log(x)^2,(x,2,3)))
0.536566859259958  # quite wrong
sage: integral(1/(ln(x))^2, x,2,3)
gamma(-1, -log(3)) - gamma(-1, -log(2))
```
We get the antiderivative and answer from Maxima, which evaluates this correctly numerically.

```
 (%i1) display2d : false $ 
  (%i2) foo : 1/log(x)^2 $ 
  (%i3) integrate (foo, x, 2, 3); 
  (%o3) gamma_incomplete(-1,-log(3))-gamma_incomplete(-1,-log(2)) 
  (%i4) %, numer; 
  (%o4) 1.273097216447114 
  (%i5) integrate (foo, x); 
  (%o5) gamma_incomplete(-1,-log(x)) 
  (%i6) ev (%, x=3) - ev (%, x=2); 
  (%o6) gamma_incomplete(-1,-log(3))-gamma_incomplete(-1,-log(2)) 
  (%i7) %, numer; 
  (%o7) 1.273097216447114 
```

See in particular this ugly plot.

```
sage: plot(lambda t: numerical_integral(1/ln(x)^2,2,t)[0],2,3)+plot(lambda t: gamma(-1, -log(t)).real(),2,3,color='red')
```
And even that we have to call `real()` to remove the numerical noise is not good...

I can't seem to reproduce this in Sage 6.4:

```
sage: numerical_integral(1/log(x)^2,2,3)
(1.273097216447114, 1.4134218422857824e-14)
sage: N(integral(1/log(x)^2,(x,2,3)))
1.27309721644711
```
In fact, the incomplete gamma function is evaluated using PARI, and the bug appears to have been fixed by the latest PARI upgrade (see #15767):

```
gp-2.5 > incgam(-1,-1)
%1 = -1.5817775437849803404714887501837998073
gp-2.5 > incgam(-1,-log(3)) - incgam(-1,-log(2))
%2 = 0.54869101686030432559293241097969276965

gp-2.7 > incgam(-1,-1)
%1 = -0.82316401210310847989376653702102822882 + 3.1415926535897932384626433832795028842*I

That is because of a patch I made at #7099; it assumed that the parent had a `precision()` method (previously the precision was ignored when converting the arguments into a `ComplexField`).  I will fix this as soon as I have time.

We should also add a doctest for the original bug.

Did you want to add 

```
N(integral(1/log(x)^2,(x,2,3)))
```
as well then, or is the example you have with the actual antideriv and floats sufficient?

I don't think it is necessary to add another doctest for the integral; this would just test in addition that Maxima computes the correct antiderivative.  Of course the above command was how the bug was originally found, but I don't really see why we should doctest exactly that command.
