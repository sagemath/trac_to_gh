A failing example is taken from 

http://ask.sagemath.org/question/10388/testing-inequalities-in-sage/

```

var('a','b')
bool( abs(a+b) <= abs(a) + abs(b) ) # False, expected True or 'Unknown'
assert (not False == bool( abs(a+b) <= abs(a) + abs(b) ) ) #fails
```

The documentation of bool() says "Returns True when the argument x is true, False otherwise."

Formally this includes returning False in case the answer is unknown and it seems 
that bool() was specified to behave like it does. But I find that is very unfortunate
and even improving the documentation (explicitly mention the 'answer is unknown' case) is not sufficient.

In that thread the exception variant is preferred in case of 'don't know'

Thanks for opening this ticket! I think this is a huge problem in Sage symbolics.

I can't remember what I did to change the behaviour so that when a comparison is made and the result can't be determined it raises an exception instead of returning `False`; I'll try to look into it this weekend.

I like the idea of having a three-valued logic (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-valued_logic); unfortunately Python makes this very difficult, as the `Tristate` class shows. There does not seem to be an elegant solution, so I wonder if it's not just best to stick with exceptions.

Btw., also the coercion framework occasionally leads to "surprising" results (because silently `False` is returned upon comparison when no coercion can be established, such that for example `a == b and a == c` doesn't imply `b == c`).  This and similar has been discussed on sage-devel a couple of times.

<a id='comment:7'>**Comment 7:**</a>
The ticket is about symbolics so let's get concrete. It happens that at the moment I'm implementing more logic affecting comparisons/relations/zero tests of expressions in Pynac. The decision process for the logic in Sage is:

`Expression.__nonzero__()` is called on input of `bool`. `__nonzero__` is the one that should throw an exception for unknown results. In `__nonzero__`,
1. first the relations of constants are decided
2. Pynac's `relational_to_bool` is called (`relational::safe_bool()`), it does:
   1. relations with one or two infinities; any result gets returned by `__nonzero__` right away
   2. if l.h.s - r.h.s is a Python object (other than `Expression`) compare it to zero, i.e., delegate to the resp. class
   3. else if relation is >= or <= use positive flag of (l.h.s - r.h.s) or its negative to decide (Pynac-0.3.9.3/0.4.3)
3. the previous result may now get changed in case of not-equal; already here Maxima may be called (I think this is wrong, Maxima should always be the last resort)
4. if no assumptions are needed now is time for `test_relation` which has some detailed logic and uses interval fields to disprove relations ("interval fields never return false positives"); it already has tristate logic by returning `NotImplemented` if unsure
5. if the previous neither returns `True/False` return what `symbolic/relation.py:test_relation_maxima()` returns
   1. the relation is tested and any `True` is returned immediately
   2. simplification is attempted before returning the final `True/False`

EDIT: `__nonzero__` is not called by Pynac
EDIT: add info about upcoming Pynac snippet

<a id='comment:9'>**Comment 9:**</a>
The second issue this ticket depends on concerns the Maxima interface in item 5. There is e.g.:

```
sage: from sage.symbolic.relation import test_relation_maxima
sage: test_relation_maxima(I>0)
False
```
because in Maxima

```
(%i8) is(%i>0);
(%o8)                               false
```
so the 'false' result should raise a `NotImplementedError` in `__nonzero__` because Maxima does not distinguish between `false`, `known undecidable`, and `unknown`. This produces hundreds of doctest fails in `symbolics` alone.

Moreover, trying to snatch this decision functionality from Maxima presupposes an independent assumption framework.

EDIT: I is %i in Maxima
