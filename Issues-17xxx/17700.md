A failing example is taken from 

http://ask.sagemath.org/question/10388/testing-inequalities-in-sage/

```

var('a','b')
bool( abs(a+b) <= abs(a) + abs(b) ) # False, expected True or 'Unknown'
assert (not False == bool( abs(a+b) <= abs(a) + abs(b) ) ) #fails
```

The documentation of bool() says "Returns True when the argument x is true, False otherwise."

Formally this includes returning False in case the answer is unknown and it seems 
that bool() was specified to behave like it does. But I find that is very unfortunate
and even improving the documentation (explicitly mention the 'answer is unknown' case) is not sufficient.

Thanks for opening this ticket! I think this is a huge problem in Sage symbolics.

I can't remember what I did to change the behaviour so that when a comparison is made and the result can't be determined it raises an exception instead of returning `False`; I'll try to look into it this weekend.

I like the idea of having a three-valued logic (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-valued_logic); unfortunately Python makes this very difficult, as the `Tristate` class shows. There does not seem to be an elegant solution, so I wonder if it's not just best to stick with exceptions.

<a id='comment:7'>Comment 7:</a>
The ticket is about symbolics so let's get concrete. It happens that at the moment I'm implementing more logic affecting comparisons/relations/zero tests of expressions in Pynac. The decision process for the logic in Sage is:

`Expression.__nonzero__()` is called on input of `bool`. `__nonzero__` is the one that should throw an exception for unknown results. In `__nonzero__`,
1. first the relations of constants are decided
2. Pynac's `relational_to_bool` is called (`relational::safe_bool()`), it does:
   1. relations with one or two infinities; any result gets returned by `__nonzero__` right away
   2. if l.h.s - r.h.s is a Python object (other than `Expression`) compare it to zero, i.e., delegate to the resp. class
   3. else if relation is >= or <= use positive flag of (l.h.s - r.h.s) or its negative to decide (Pynac-0.3.9.3/0.4.3)
3. the previous result may now get changed in case of not-equal; already here Maxima may be called (I think this is wrong, Maxima should always be the last resort)
4. if no assumptions are needed now is time for `test_relation` which has some detailed logic and uses interval fields to disprove relations ("interval fields never return false positives"); it already has tristate logic by returning `NotImplemented` if unsure
5. if the previous neither returns `True/False` return what `symbolic/relation.py:test_relation_maxima()` returns
   1. the relation is tested and any `True` is returned immediately
   2. simplification is attempted before returning the final `True/False`

EDIT: `__nonzero__` is not called by Pynac
EDIT: add info about upcoming Pynac snippet

<a id='comment:9'>Comment 9:</a>
The second issue this ticket depends on concerns the Maxima interface in item 5. There is e.g.:

```
sage: from sage.symbolic.relation import test_relation_maxima
sage: test_relation_maxima(I>0)
False
```
because in Maxima

```
(%i8) is(%i>0);
(%o8)                               false
```
so the 'false' result should raise a `NotImplementedError` in `__nonzero__` because Maxima does not distinguish between `false`, `known undecidable`, and `unknown`. This produces hundreds of doctest fails in `symbolics` alone.

Moreover, trying to snatch this decision functionality from Maxima presupposes an independent assumption framework.

EDIT: I is %i in Maxima
