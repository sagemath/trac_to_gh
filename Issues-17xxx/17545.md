```
The current "Reporting Bugs" section of the developer's manual is rather verbose, and contain information that is already explained elsewhere:

- How to create a ticket
- The meaning of a ticket's fields

http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/trac.html#reporting-bugs

With this branch, the description points toward those sections instead of repeating it (partially) here. Also, some information that was there and not in the other section was moved there.

I also added a (short) explanation of what the color of the branch's name means. But there was no "How to merge with the latest beta" section anywhere, so it's still somehow a dead end. Better than nothing though.

Just curious as to why you have *two* headers for this.

```
+.. _trac-bug-report:
+
+.. _section-trac-bug-report:
```
Would one suffice, or is there a technical reason this is necessary?

Because you have a sub point before "You might be asked..." (I think) but not before "If you do not ..." there is an extra space before the latter.  I don't know if it matters, but it looks inconsistent.

I also notice (not introduced by you) that

```
All changes to Sage source code have to go through the Sage trac development server. 
```
but `Trac` is not capitalized.  If you want to, you could fix that here instead of someone opening a trivial ticket...

(Edit: otherwise this is fine!)

Hello !

> Just curious as to why you have *two* headers for this.


I fought hard against this while writing the branch and thought that it was the only way out. Turns out that now it works without that. Sooooo let's say "fixed" `:-P`

> Because you have a sub point before "You might be asked..." (I think) but not before "If you do not ..." there is an extra space before the latter.  I don't know if it matters, but it looks inconsistent.


Here again I tried a lot, I tried this [1] and inserted empty math environments, and other tricks... I don't know hwo to fix that, it actually looks like a docutils bug. I agree that it is not pretty but I do not know how to make it better.

> but `Trac` is not capitalized.  If you want to, you could fix that here instead of someone opening a trivial ticket...


Done.
