<a id='comment:2'></a>Interesting. Looks mostly good.

This is wrong, though:

```
for i from 0 <= i < self._nrows:
  for j from 0 <= j < self._ncols:
    if not x[k]:
      entries[(i,j)] = x[k]
    k += 1
```

It should be `if x[k]`: you want to copy the *non*-zero elements. I had some trouble testing this code path, though:

```
sage: R.<a,b>=QQ[]
sage: m1=matrix(2,2,[0,a,b,0],sparse=True); m1
[0 a]
[b 0]
sage: type(m1)(m1.parent(),[0,a,b,0],True,True)
[0 0]
[0 0]
```

I haven't yet figured out where the `m1` construction converts its argument, but perhaps we can deprecate or even immediately remove that code path dealing with a single flat list.

I also wonder whether we should have a custom cythonized type to be used as key, instead of the generic CPython tuple or arbitrary size and types. Might make things a lot faster and memory-efficient again.

Right

Done

> I also wonder whether we should have a custom cythonized type to be used as key, instead of the generic CPython tuple or arbitrary size and types. Might make things a lot faster and memory-efficient again.


Nope. I think we sould get rid of Python there. Sparse graphs have a much better implementation (though not very much documented either). But you are right, having a customized Cython type for pair of Py_ssize_t would be indeed much faster. Let me have a try.

> As far as I can see, most other (non-generic) sparse matrix implementations <...>


Hash table is cool. But not in the way it is done currently. We should not use Python objects other than to wrap the ring elements.

An important question is whether you want to access quickly to the following data:

- nonzero entries in a fixed row
- nonzero entries in a fixed column

The best would be as you did: look at the literature and other softwares/libraries.

> The whole class has poor docstring and doctest coverage.


Right, I added some. But I will not go any further.

Right. And thinking more, I am not so sure about the overhead as Python int (for -5 <= i < 128) do not need allocation.

Very strange. Actually, when you try to convert matrix from a ring to another you might end up to call the constructor of `MatrixGenericSparse` with arguments `entries=[]`. And so, the case of the empty list needs to be treated!! I added a long comment in the constructor and it might be appropriate to actually modify the code in `MatrixSpace.matrix`.

Replying to [jhpalmieri](#comment%3A9)

True. I added two sentences in a `.. NOTE::`. Actually, I have no idea about the potential speed up.

It is like 0

```
sage: bool(0)
False
sage: 0.is_zero()
True
```

We have zero <-> False and non-zero <-> True

> Isn't one invariant the fact that all entries in the dict must be non-zero?


Yes, it is. So that the matrix is zero if and only if the dict is empty.

:-D

That would be a very professional excuse, but I guess I was thinking more along the lines `bool(…)` vs. `x.__nonzero__()` (which should behave the same) instead of `bool(x)` vs. `x.is_zero()` as the doctest used them.

Some more comments from reading the latest commit.
* `if entries is None or not entries` could be shortened to `if not entries`.
* `_cmp_backward` might use `if i != j: return i - j` in the first case as well. Not sure whether that makes much of a difference.

One more thing, not related to that last commit. Contrary to other sparse matrix implementations, we don't do a range check for inputs. Of course, that might be considered a bug in its own right, but if you feel like it, you could address this here as well.

```
sage: m = matrix(Zmod(5)['x'],2,2,{(3,3):2}) # this APPEARS to work at first
sage: m.is_zero()
False
sage: m
<repr(<sage.matrix.matrix_generic_sparse.Matrix_generic_sparse at 0x7fc795dcbf50>) failed: IndexError: list assignment index out of range>
sage: matrix(Zmod(5),2,2,{(3,3):2}) # this reports the problem early on
...
IndexError: invalid entries list

It depends on the school! "my_var is None" is a simple address lookup while "not my_var" implies a function call. So "my_var is None" is very fast compared to "not my_var". But I agree that is fighting for micro seconds that are negligible looking at the rest of the code...

> * `_cmp_backward` might use `if i != j: return i - j` in the first case as well. Not sure whether that makes much of a difference.


Actually this is what I tried. But if you do that, you end up with some warning claiming that the comparison routine returns something different from 0,1,-1!

> One more thing, not related to that last commit.


Indeed, this needs to be fixed. I thought that `MatrixSpace` would have taken care of that. I will add a commit.

Is there anything special about that one comment block? There are similar comments all over the file, although most come from [2076edf](http://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/commit/?id=2076edfc5e985d848980204f103a1157087350f1) while the one you wanted removed comes from [43baa1b](http://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/commit/?id=43baa1bbc23e4a0f84c37d72f411c1a04ad1fa72). Does that have anything to do with your choice, or is simply that this one comment appeared in the diff?

Valid point, so I won't object to leave the code as it is. Might even adapt that style.

Can't reproduce such a warning. Who is complaining when? Why no warning for the other pair component? I wonder whether one would want to put some bigger numbers in the test case, in order to make sure that steps with absolute value more than one are always involved in some comparison. But even then I don't see this warning you mention.

At some point, I had trouble with this but I do not remember exactly. I just learn a funny way to do it returning 1,0 or -1 fast:

```
return (i > j) - (i < j)
```
