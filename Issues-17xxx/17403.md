People try to TAB-discover a method for inversion of `PowerSeries` but can't find it (http://ask.sagemath.org/question/24904/how-to-compute-the-multiplicative-inverse-of-a-series/), so we need a wrapper for `^-1`, named analogously to `PowerSeries.reversion()`.

The same applies to `LaurentSeries`

Keywords: inverse, series
