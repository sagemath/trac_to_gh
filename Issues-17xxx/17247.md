Ah, this is just what came out of sws2rst, I don't think I was more than dimly aware of that.

Thanks for the review, very helpful.  

As it happens, the author actually always spells her name without capital letters, so I'll change that when I get around to fixing the Schlegel piece - I think it's the `show()` that is deprecated, not the projection.  In fact, this was apparently not doctested at #16625

```
+    def show(self, *args, **kwds):
+        from sage.misc.superseded import deprecation
+        deprecation(16625, 'use Projection.plot instead')
+        return self.plot(*args, **kwds)
```
so I may need to fix that as well for this ticket.
