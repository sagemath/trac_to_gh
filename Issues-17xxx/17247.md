Why don't you take a look at the rest of the content or whatever (pass doctests?) and once you have all things to fix, I'll do them all at once.

<a id='comment:10'></a>Thanks for the review, very helpful.  

As it happens, the author actually always spells her name without capital letters, so I'll change that when I get around to fixing the Schlegel piece - I think it's the `show()` that is deprecated, not the projection.  In fact, this was apparently not doctested at #16625

```
+    def show(self, *args, **kwds):
+        from sage.misc.superseded import deprecation
+        deprecation(16625, 'use Projection.plot instead')
+        return self.plot(*args, **kwds)
```
so I may need to fix that as well for this ticket.
