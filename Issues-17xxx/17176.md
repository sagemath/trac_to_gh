Tried the following to be able to use gdb:

* Made a `gdbc` certificate (can only be done in the GUI, wtf): http://blog.panks.me/posts/2013/11/install-gdb-on-os-x-mavericks-from-source/
* Sign: `codesign -fs gdbc ./gdb/gdb`
* Put the `gdb` binary in the `procmod` group and make it chgrp

  ```
  $ ls -al gdb
  -rwxrwsr-x  1 vbraun  procmod  6717344 Oct 19 12:31 gdb
  ```
* Add myself to the groups `admin`, `_developer`, `procmod`, `procview`:

  ```
  dscl . append /Groups/procmod GroupMembership vbraun
  ```
* Rebooted

Still can't run without root:

```
$ ./gdb ~/Sage/local/bin/patch 
....
Starting program: /Users/vbraun/Sage/local/bin/patch 
Unable to find Mach task port for process-id 476: (os/kern) failure (0x5).

This seems to work on an OSX 10.9 machine. I actually see both files `/usr/include/setjmp.h` and `/usr/include/machine/setjmp.h`, and they differ: the second one basically just contains these lines:

```
#ifndef	_MACHINE_SETJMP_H_
#define	_MACHINE_SETJMP_H_

#include <setjmp.h>

#endif	/* _MACHINE_SETJMP_H_ */
```
Is it an issue to not use that one? I also don't have access to earlier versions of OS X to test there.

Oh you said 10.9. Thats probably what it was, then.

In any case `/usr/include/setjmp.h` is the standard location (or anything directly in the system include path). There was probably some old Apple SDK that didn't do that right, which prompted gdb to include setjmp.h it from a somewhat weird place.

It worked for me before on OS X 10.9, and it works for me now on OS X 10.10. I have no way of testing earlier versions of OS X.

Is this good enough for a positive review, given that it's an optional package?
