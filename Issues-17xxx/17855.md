<a id='comment:3'></a>This incorporated a few additional changes

- there was an error in the error_bound canonical height computations which is now corrected

- heights and canonical heights are now computable for QQbar points

- methods to change QQbar points and maps to number field points and maps

- change_ring now accepts an embedding for points and maps
