The function will take a point and map as input and return a boolean of whether or not the point is preperiodic for the map. Perhaps there should be an option to also return the period if the point is preperiodic

This incorporated a few additional changes

- there was an error in the error_bound canonical height computations which is now corrected

- heights and canonical heights are now computable for QQbar points

- methods to change QQbar points and maps to number field points and maps

- change_ring now accepts an embedding for points and maps

H = Hom(P,P)
f = H([x^2,y^2,z^2])
Q = P([1,1,1])
