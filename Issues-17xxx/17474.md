<a id='comment:6'>**Comment 6:**</a>
In your implementation, there is no oriented edge associated to an edge of the polyhedron that belongs to the kernel of the linear form, hence the underlying undirected graph of your graph is only a subgraph of vertices and edges of the polyhedron, see for example:

```
sage: penta = Polyhedron([[0,0],[1,0],[0,1],[1,2],[3,2]])
sage: penta.vertex_digraph(vector([1,0]))
```

What is the purpose of this method ? Depending on this, the described behaviour may cause troubles. Other possibilities is to have two oriented edges facing eachother (just replace `> 0` by `>= 0`), or choosing one (but you lose some symmetry).

I have also added a keyword to ask for the reverse orientation.

How can I check if the input is a linear form ?

Replying to [@fchapoton](#comment%3A12):
> How can I check if the input is a linear form ?

I uploaded a patch that checks if the input is an instance of `VectorSpaceMorphism` whose codomain has dimension 1.

I removed from the doc the possibility to input a list or a tuple since it was not working in the previous version (it is doable to try/except `f = vector(f)` but i am not sure we have to think for the user).

> I have also added a keyword to ask for the reverse orientation.

It works well. Do you have some important reason to go in the decreasing direction by default ? If not, i would prefer to have it the other way by default, to be consistent with the MILP default, but perhaps i miss some other use case.

ok, thanks.

I have made it increasing by default, as you seem to prefer it so.

I have added a test to check that the orientation is correct.

I have also removed an usused import and made two minor pep8 changes.
