> How can I check if the input is a linear form ?


I uploaded a patch that checks if the input is an instance of `VectorSpaceMorphism` whose codomain has dimension 1.

I removed from the doc the possibility to input a list or a tuple since it was not working in the previous version (it is doable to try/except `f = vector(f)` but i am not sure we have to think for the user).

> I have also added a keyword to ask for the reverse orientation.


It works well. Do you have some important reason to go in the decreasing direction by default ? If not, i would prefer to have it the other way by default, to be consistent with the MILP default, but perhaps i miss some other use case.
