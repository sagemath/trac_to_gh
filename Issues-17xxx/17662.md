We introduce evenly distributed sets (EDS) to get more difference families and more BIBD in Sage. More precisely we add

- a database of small EDS
- a naive backtracker (that was actually used to build the database)

<a id='comment:4'></a>Helloooooooooooo,

For the moment it's only about form, but:

- In the desription of the EDS database that appear as a comment in
  `databases.py`: could you give it a better shape with lists and items?
  Something like:
  At position `[k][q]` there is:
      - False: no such set exists
      - (None, B) -- explanation
      - (polynomial, B) -- explanation
  It is a bit hard to read, as it is.

- can you also call `del` on `R,ZZ` and `a`?

- In the module doc of `database.py`, could you add a link toward a definition
  of `EDS`? From typing this in Google you don't get much.

- `cdef class EvenlyDistributedSets(object):` why do you inherit from
  `object`? What do you earn? `O_o`

- Jeroen's talk at Liege taught us that `check_malloc` existed `:-P`

  http://fossies.org/linux/sage/src/sage/ext/memory.pxd#l_97

- An ÌNPUT section is missing from at least two functions of your new file. In
  particular, it would be cool to know how exactly one is meant to build a
  `EvenlyDistributedSets` instance.

- About the name `EvenlyDistributedSets`... I don't find it overly specific. I
  know that the 's' means 'many', but welll....

<a id='comment:5'></a>Just some questions about some of your questions.

Replying to [ncohen](#comment%3A4):

It is currently in the class `EvenlyDistributedSets`. What should I do?
 
> - `cdef class EvenlyDistributedSets(object):` why do you inherit from
>   `object`? What do you earn? `O_o`


No idea.

> - An ÌNPUT section is missing from at least two functions of your new file. In
>   particular, it would be cool to know how exactly one is meant to build a

It is in the class documentation (not in `__init__`)

```
    INPUT:

    - ``K`` -- a finite field of cardinality `q`

    - ``k`` -- a positive integer such that `k(k-1)` divides `q-1`

    - ``check`` -- boolean (default is ``False``). Whether you want to check
      intermediate steps of the iterator. This is mainly intended for debugging
      purpose. Setting it to ``True`` will considerably slow the iteration.
```
Should I move it?

> - About the name `EvenlyDistributedSets`... I don't find it overly specific. I

What about `SomeEvenlyDistributedSetsWithSomeProperty`? It is exactly the evenly distributed sets up to isomorphisms (= relabeling by `x -> ax + b`). I will try to find something.

<a id='comment:13'></a>COooooooooooOOOOOOOOOOOoooooooollllllllll!! Perhaps we should think someday of having big tables of the BIBD (or other designs) that we can build. In the doc. A bit like how we do it for the 'database of small designs'. The La Jolla Covering Repository doesn't go that high.

<a id='comment:15'></a>Hello,

I added a commit with some small modifications. The replacement malloc->calloc is there because the following code triggers a segfault (during `__dealloc__`) when the second malloc fails.

```
self.ratio = <unsigned int **> check_malloc(q*sizeof(unsigned int *))
self.ratio[0] = <unsigned int *> check_malloc(q*q*sizeof(unsigned int))
```

I also have a couple of questions:

Could you explain somewhere why being an EDS is preserved by relabelling?

Also, why an 'if' there?

```
if BB > B:
   relabs.add(tuple(BB))
```

Yes, easy: $(ax+b) - (ax'+b) = a(x-x')$. So the cosets of the differences `x-x'` are just permuted by the multiplication by `a`. Because the condition is "hit each of them twice", it is invariant under permutation.

Will write it.

Right, can be safely removed. Will do.

- I have a commit with much cleaner/better branch cut, am I free to add it now?
- I can get rid of `sage.ratio` by reorganizing `self.list_K`  into `[x^i for i in range(self.q-1)]`. That way the ratio would just be `(x-y)%(q-1)`. Do you think it would be better?

If it makes the code simpler and easier, yes. If it makes it more efficient but more complicated, then in another ticket please.

> - I can get rid of `sage.ratio` by reorganizing `self.list_K`  into `[x^i for i in range(self.q-1)]`. That way the ratio would just be `(x-y)%(q-1)`. Do you think it would be better?


In terms of perf I have no idea. If you do this replacement please comment such lines with their meaning in term of groups element like `i-j # x<sup>i/x</sup>j`.

<a id='comment:24'></a>Hellooooooooooooooooooo,

- Isn't it weird that all EDS not considered 'up to isomorphism' always begin
  with `0,1`? Perhaps you should say somewhere that they are always normalized?
  {{{
  sage: E = EvenlyDistributedSetsBacktracker(Zmod(13), 4, up_to_isomorphism=False)
  sage: for B in E: print B
  [0, 1, 11, 5]
  [0, 1, 4, 6]
  [0, 1, 9, 3]
  [0, 1, 8, 10]
  }}}

- `to_difference_family` -- could you add a check that this is indeed a
  difference family? Like with the usual `check` argument?

- Same with `an_element`.

- "The value of the other" -- the value of the other what?
  {{{
  # Given one such function, the values of the other are 1/z, 1-z,
  # 1/(1-z), (z-1)/z and z/(z-1).
  }}}

- Why would that map `B[i]` to 1?
  {{{
  # We choose
  #    t -> (x - t)/ (x - B[j])
  #  (that maps x to 0 and B[i] to 1
  }}}

- I do not get this line
  {{{
  # try to append x
  if self._add_element(x,kk):
      # note: the element x is already added to B in ._add_element()
      if kk == k-1:
          ans = self._B_automorphisms()
          if ans is False:
	      continue
  }}}
  Wouldn't it be better to call `_B_automorphisms()` in `self._add_element`, and
  to not add the element if the min property is not satisfied?

- I do not understand why you do the same test twice:
  {{{
            if x == q-2:
                kk -= 1
                x = B[kk]
                self._pop(kk)
                if x == q-2:
                    kk -= 1
                    x = B[kk]
                    self._pop(kk)
                    if x == q-2:
  }}}
  Isn't it better to define x as "the last element in the list+1"? This way you
  couldn't have `x==q-2` when `B[kk-1]=q-2`

I added a small commit containing mostly doc. I also changed a bit the
management of `self.t`. I began by replacing your `if self.t[i]:
self.coset[i]=1` by a `self.coset[i] |= self.t[i]`, then noticed that it was
probably why you had been setting t to zero outside of the `_add_element`
function.

It actually took me some time to understand that `t` was always equal to 0 when
this function was called. Because you initialized it elsewhere, I thought for a
while that it used some values computed in another function.

<a id='comment:30'></a>Hello,

## Commits precision

The method `_check_cosets` was just wrong and not tested. I corrected it in `​0a750d9`. It is also optimized to not use Python data. In the end there is a new example which test the `check=True` in the class (and which indirectly uses this method).

In `0a750d9`:
- as you suggested, now `x = B[kk]`
- I simplified the `_add_element` and rename it into `_check_last_element` it is also much cleaner and a bit faster
- I removed `_pop` and copy/paste the corresponding code in two places
- To choose the next element x in the main loop, there are now some easy check and it results in a great speedup

## Answers

yes it is, now there is a comment in the `INPUT` section

> - `to_difference_family` -- could you add a check that this is indeed a
>   difference family? Like with the usual `check` argument?
 
>

done and done

it was value of the other functions. It is now clarified.

it was a typo, should be "(x - t) / (x - B[i])". Corrected.

> - I do not get this line
>   ...


it is now very different and I hope, simpler (see commit `0a750d9`)

>   Wouldn't it be better to call `_B_automorphisms()` in `self._add_element`, and

`_B_automorphisms` (now `_B_relabelled_copies`) is very slow. We should not use that seriously inside the main loop.

>   ...

this is completely modified in the commit `0a750d9`

Hopefully you are and I am, otherwise this ticket would not have been tested!!
