We introduce evenly distributed sets (EDS) to get more difference families and more BIBD in Sage. More precisely we add

- a database of small EDS
- a naive backtracker (that was actually used to build the database)

Helloooooooooooo,

For the moment it's only about form, but:

- In the desription of the EDS database that appear as a comment in
  `databases.py`: could you give it a better shape with lists and items?
  Something like:
  At position `[k][q]` there is:
      - False: no such set exists
      - (None, B) -- explanation
      - (polynomial, B) -- explanation
  It is a bit hard to read, as it is.

- can you also call `del` on `R,ZZ` and `a`?

- In the module doc of `database.py`, could you add a link toward a definition
  of `EDS`? From typing this in Google you don't get much.

- `cdef class EvenlyDistributedSets(object):` why do you inherit from
  `object`? What do you earn? `O_o`

- Jeroen's talk at Liege taught us that `check_malloc` existed `:-P`

  http://fossies.org/linux/sage/src/sage/ext/memory.pxd#l_97

- An ÌNPUT section is missing from at least two functions of your new file. In
  particular, it would be cool to know how exactly one is meant to build a
  `EvenlyDistributedSets` instance.

- About the name `EvenlyDistributedSets`... I don't find it overly specific. I
  know that the 's' means 'many', but welll....

Just some questions about some of your questions.

Replying to [@nathanncohen](#comment:4):

It is currently in the class `EvenlyDistributedSets`. What should I do?
 
> - `cdef class EvenlyDistributedSets(object):` why do you inherit from
>   `object`? What do you earn? `O_o`

No idea.

> - An ÌNPUT section is missing from at least two functions of your new file. In

It is in the class documentation (not in `__init__`)

```
    INPUT:

    - ``K`` -- a finite field of cardinality `q`

    - ``k`` -- a positive integer such that `k(k-1)` divides `q-1`

    - ``check`` -- boolean (default is ``False``). Whether you want to check
      intermediate steps of the iterator. This is mainly intended for debugging
      purpose. Setting it to ``True`` will considerably slow the iteration.
```
Should I move it?

What about `SomeEvenlyDistributedSetsWithSomeProperty`? It is exactly the evenly distributed sets up to isomorphisms (= relabeling by `x -> ax + b`). I will try to find something.

Hello,

I added a commit with some small modifications. The replacement malloc->calloc is there because the following code triggers a segfault (during `__dealloc__`) when the second malloc fails.

```
self.ratio = <unsigned int **> check_malloc(q*sizeof(unsigned int *))
self.ratio[0] = <unsigned int *> check_malloc(q*q*sizeof(unsigned int))
```

I also have a couple of questions:

Could you explain somewhere why being an EDS is preserved by relabelling?

Also, why an 'if' there?

```
if BB > B:
   relabs.add(tuple(BB))
```

Yes, easy: $(ax+b) - (ax'+b) = a(x-x')$. So the cosets of the differences `x-x'` are just permuted by the multiplication by `a`. Because the condition is "hit each of them twice", it is invariant under permutation.

Will write it.

Right, can be safely removed. Will do.

- I have a commit with much cleaner/better branch cut, am I free to add it now?
- I can get rid of `sage.ratio` by reorganizing `self.list_K`  into `[x^i for i in range(self.q-1)]`. That way the ratio would just be `(x-y)%(q-1)`. Do you think it would be better?

If it makes the code simpler and easier, yes. If it makes it more efficient but more complicated, then in another ticket please.

back to needs review (and I set you as a reviewer before forgetting it).

I did not get rid of `.ratio` as it is some work and might be less readable. I might reconsider it later.

Hellooooooooooooooooooo,

- Isn't it weird that all EDS not considered 'up to isomorphism' always begin
  with `0,1`? Perhaps you should say somewhere that they are always normalized?

  ```
  sage: E = EvenlyDistributedSetsBacktracker(Zmod(13), 4, up_to_isomorphism=False)
  sage: for B in E: print B
  [0, 1, 11, 5]
  [0, 1, 4, 6]
  [0, 1, 9, 3]
  [0, 1, 8, 10]
  ```

- `to_difference_family` -- could you add a check that this is indeed a
  difference family? Like with the usual `check` argument?

- Same with `an_element`.

- "The value of the other" -- the value of the other what?

  ```
  # Given one such function, the values of the other are 1/z, 1-z,
  # 1/(1-z), (z-1)/z and z/(z-1).
  ```

- Why would that map `B[i]` to 1?

  ```
  # We choose
  #    t -> (x - t)/ (x - B[j])
  #  (that maps x to 0 and B[i] to 1
  ```

- I do not get this line

  ```
  # try to append x
  if self._add_element(x,kk):
      # note: the element x is already added to B in ._add_element()
      if kk == k-1:
          ans = self._B_automorphisms()
          if ans is False:
	      continue
  ```
  Wouldn't it be better to call `_B_automorphisms()` in `self._add_element`, and
  to not add the element if the min property is not satisfied?

- I do not understand why you do the same test twice:

  ```
            if x == q-2:
                kk -= 1
                x = B[kk]
                self._pop(kk)
                if x == q-2:
                    kk -= 1
                    x = B[kk]
                    self._pop(kk)
                    if x == q-2:
  ```
  Isn't it better to define x as "the last element in the list+1"? This way you
  couldn't have `x==q-2` when `B[kk-1]=q-2`

I added a small commit containing mostly doc. I also changed a bit the
management of `self.t`. I began by replacing your `if self.t[i]:
self.coset[i]=1` by a `self.coset[i] |= self.t[i]`, then noticed that it was
probably why you had been setting t to zero outside of the `_add_element`
function.

It actually took me some time to understand that `t` was always equal to 0 when
this function was called. Because you initialized it elsewhere, I thought for a
while that it used some values computed in another function.

Replying to [@nathanncohen](#comment:24):
Thanks for your commit

I took care of all your comments in my 6 commits. I hope it is clearer now.

It seems also that the previous backtracker forgot some difference families!! Too bad!!

Hello,

## Commits precision

The method `_check_cosets` was just wrong and not tested. I corrected it in `​0a750d9`. It is also optimized to not use Python data. In the end there is a new example which test the `check=True` in the class (and which indirectly uses this method).

In `0a750d9`:
- as you suggested, now `x = B[kk]`
- I simplified the `_add_element` and rename it into `_check_last_element` it is also much cleaner and a bit faster
- I removed `_pop` and copy/paste the corresponding code in two places
- To choose the next element x in the main loop, there are now some easy check and it results in a great speedup

## Answers

> - Isn't it weird that all EDS not considered 'up to isomorphism' always begin
>   with `0,1`? Perhaps you should say somewhere that they are always normalized?

yes it is, now there is a comment in the `INPUT` section

> - `to_difference_family` -- could you add a check that this is indeed a
>   difference family? Like with the usual `check` argument?

>
>  - Same with `an_element`.

done and done
 
> - "The value of the other" -- the value of the other what?
> 
>   ```
>   # Given one such function, the values of the other are 1/z, 1-z,
>   # 1/(1-z), (z-1)/z and z/(z-1).

it was value of the other functions. It is now clarified.

it was a typo, should be "(x - t) / (x - B[i])". Corrected.

> - I do not get this line
>   ...

it is now very different and I hope, simpler (see commit `0a750d9`)

>   Wouldn't it be better to call `_B_automorphisms()` in `self._add_element`, and
>   to not add the element if the min property is not satisfied?

`_B_automorphisms` (now `_B_relabelled_copies`) is very slow. We should not use that seriously inside the main loop.

> - I do not understand why you do the same test twice:
>   ...
>   Isn't it better to define x as "the last element in the list+1"? This way you
>   couldn't have `x==q-2` when `B[kk-1]=q-2`

this is completely modified in the commit `0a750d9`
