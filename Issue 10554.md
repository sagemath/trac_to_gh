Looks like the output of phcpack might have changed, which breaks the parsing.  So the interface needs to be tweaked.

This seems to work on OS X 10.6, but I don't have access to OS X 10.5 to test it there.  I'm going to try it on on `OpenSolaris` (x86), but my guess is it won't work.  This is not a blocker for an optional spkg, but that is one of our supported platforms.

It also looks like the most recent version is 2.3.64; is it worth upgrading?

On OpenSolaris x86 (fulvia on skynet): when trying to execute `sol = phc.blackbox(start_sys1, R1, verbose=False)`, I get

```
