It was [reported](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-support/zWOWtjha-H0) that in some situations using the MeatAxe backend for matrices over finite fields won't work because the arithmetic tables cannot be found.

This ticket is to solve that problem. Sage uses a fork of MeatAxe anyway (called SharedMeatAxe) maintained by Simon King, and so one potential solution is to fix it in the fork.

In the original report, the problem was on CoCalC. From the description, it didn't become clear to me if the users do not have write permission on `DOT_SAGE` (which would explain the problem) or if `DOT_SAGE` is a symbolic link (which perhaps can be troublesome, too).

Currently, the arithmetic tables of (Shared)MeatAxe are sought in `$DOT_SAGE/meataxe`, and are created there when they aren't present. I see the following potential solutions:
1. Instead of using `DOT_SAGE`, use `SAGE_EXT`: The user may not have write permissions, but since MeatAxe can only deal with field sizes less than 255, it would be easy to just create *all* arithmetic tables during package installation (hence, in a situation where write permission is granted and from where all users can read).

I'd say that the communication with meataxe library can be done via sscanf/sprintf functions
rather than fscanf/fprintf, then nothing gets written to/read from the disk, problem solved via a relatively small change of the code.

The routine writing/reading the table doesn't invoke fscanf/fprintf, if I understand correctly (at least not directly). It uses fread/fwrite.

In any case, I think the first question to be addressed is whether we do want to keep the tables in memory (and potentially lose time for table creation), or want them permanently stored in a file (and potentially lose time because of a slow disk, and have the trouble with write permission).

I think the idea really is to avoid re-creation of the tables. Compute them once, store them, reload them another day.

It is (I think) required that the tables are created, BEFORE the optional `matrix_gfpn_dense` Cython module is available.

Therefore, I want to trigger creation of the tables using one of the MeatAxe executables. I find `zcv` convenient --- to some extent:
- Let `input` be a file consisting of the single line `matrix field=25 rows=0 cols=0`.
- Then, the command `zcv input output` will create a file called `output` describing an empty matrix in binary format, and will, as a side-effect, create `p025.zzz` in the current directory. Of course I am only interested in the side-effect; the file `output` can safely be deleted.

The question is how to do the above in a loop, where `field=...` runs over all available field sizes. According to [MeatAxe documentation](https://www.mankier.com/1/zcv), `zcv - output` should read the input from stdin, but apparently it doesn't.

Is there a way to pretend that a program such as `zcv` reads input from a file? If not: How do I create the input file using a shell script and apply `zcv` to it without risking to be affected by race conditions?

Thank you! That was exactly what I was looking for.

Before I create a branch: The upstream tarball will not change. But shall the Sage package version be bumped from `1.0` to `1.0.p0`?

The above spkg-install script is supposed to install the MeatAxe executables (including zcv) in `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin`. It DOES install it when the spkg-install script ends before `cd $MTXLIB`.

However, according to the error message, zcv is in fact not installed when it is needed. Why?

On the bright side, `... || sdh_die` works as expected.

Every env variable defined in sage-env has the same path set as fallback in env.py, I don't see why this one should be different - the env.py one is just a fallback, if the env variable is defined it will be used.

This is not only useful for distros that don't provide sage-env, but also for using sage as a python library - 'from sage.all import *' does not import the env variables defined in sage-env

I think it doesn't matter whether a system-wide meataxe or the meataxe spkg is used (except that the original `MeatAxe` is clearly inferior to its fork `SharedMeatAxe` and that the Sage wrapper uses some functions that only exist in the fork).

In any case, when a meataxe application or any program using meataxe library functions is executed, it will be needed to use arithmetic tables. When they cannot be found, they will be created.

So, the following implications hold regardless whether spkg-meataxe or system-meataxe is used:
- If the environment variable `MTXLIB` is undefined, meataxe applications will search and potentially write tables to the current directory. If the `extern char*` variable `MtxLibDir` is undefined, meataxe library functions will search and potentially write tables to the current directory.

  => Since we do not want to pollute the user's current directory, we **have to** define both environment and cdef extern variables.
- If the tables already exist at the location pointed at by the variables, we need that the user has read permission. Otherwise, there will be an error.
- If the tables do not already exist, the folder pointed at by the variables needs to exist and the user needs to have write permission. Otherwise. there will be an error.

So, our requirements, regardless what source we take meataxe from, are as follows:
- Sage needs to define one environment and one extern C variable. The former should be in sage-env, the latter in sage.libs.meataxe, I suppose.
- It is not a strict requirement that both variables are equal, but of course it would be nice. In any case, we have to make sure that either
  * the arithmetic tables are present at the given folder (and the user can read them), or
  * the user has write permission at the given folder.
  
  A system wide meataxe wouldn't mind that the folder is inside of the Sage tree.

**Question:** What should we do?

I don't know what you mean by "user's global env". It needs to be present when you call an executable in a sage shell.

IIUC the difference between this and the current state of the branch is whether MTXLIB is defined or not in sage-env, right? In that case, either way is fine for me - I'm only worried about what happens when sage-env is not imported, and the latest commit in env.py takes care of this.

- If the user exports `MTXLIB` and then installs `meataxe`, then the folder `$MTXLIB` will be created; otherwise a default location is chosen and the folder created.
- If the user exports `MTXLIB` and then starts Sage, then sage.env.MTXLIB will be set accordingly; otherwise, a default location is used.
- Sage will define the `extern char*` variable `MtxLibDir` to comply with sage.env.MTXLIB when sage.meataxe is first imported. That variable is all what we need in sage.matrix.matrix_gfpn_dense.
- If someone wants to use meataxe applications, then it is not Sage's responsibility to export MTXLIB.

I tested that `sage -f -c meataxe` works and `sage -t src/sage/matrix/matrix_gfpn_dense.pyx` works without error. So, needs review! And I guess it should be verified that meataxe now works in CoCalC.

I guess it is "keep" in the sense of "one early commit adds it, so, why did a later commit remove it?".

My rationale for not adding "environmental pollution" (i.e., adding the `MTXLIB` environment variable) is as follows: Even with the optional meataxe spkg installed, Sage will not call any meataxe standalone programs.

that's cause we try to modify the ticket more or less at the same time, this leads to such deletions etc often (there are apparently ways around it, I don't quite know).

I just tested what was happening in cocalc.

Apparently the DOT_SAGE folder does not contain a sub-folder `meataxe`. When MeatAxe tries to write tables into the non-existing folder, it just crashes instead of creating it. After I created `$DOT_SAGE/meataxe` manually, things worked.

The stupid thing was that during package installation I created `$DOT_SAGE/meataxe`, which of course doesn't work as soon as one has more than a single user for one Sage installation. Very stupid. VERY.

So, the potential fixes are:
1. Change the upstream SharedMeatAxe tarball so that it creates the folder `$MTX_LIB` when needed.
2. Change sage.libs.meataxe so that `import sage.libs.meataxe` creates the folder when needed.
3. Install all tables in a folder that exists during package installation and can be read by all users. That's what I suggest in the current branch.

Which of these solutions do you prefer?

I prefer 3., because it installs all tables once (spending a well-defined amount of disk space), rather than letting each user created his or her own tables (spending a potentially unlimited amount of disk space)
