4 years ago, we weren't ready to have NTL built with thread safety because of a lack of support for c++11.
What about now?


```
########## thread safety

NTL_THREADS=on

# Set to 'on' if you want to compile NTL in thread-safe mode.  This requires
# several C++11 features, including atomic types, mutexes, and thread_local
# storage.  Your compiler may not yet support these features.  Setting this
# flag will automatically set the NTL_STD_CXX11 flag (if neither NTL_STD_CXX11
# or NTL_STD_CXX14 is already set). It will also pass -pthread throught to the
# compiler via CXXAUTOFLAGS (if possible).
```


Also do we need to change any cython files? For example, add something like: 
`# distutils: extra_compile_args = -std=c++11`?
