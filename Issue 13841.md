# Issue 13841: Comparison of float('inf') and infinity

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/14045

Original creator: tscrim

Original creation time: 2013-01-31 20:41:17

Assignee: tscrim

Keywords: infinity, coercion

Currently infinity and float do not compare properly:

```
sage: oo > float('inf')
True
sage: oo == float('+inf')
False
```

because of

```
sage: InfinityRing(float('inf'))
A positive finite number
```

How was this patch file created?  It is missing a "User" field, you should create a `$HOME/.hgrc` file as explained in [http://sagemath.org/doc/developer/producing_patches.html](http://sagemath.org/doc/developer/producing_patches.html) and export the patch using `hg export tip`.
