```
        .. MATH::

            [z^n] \left(\frac{1}{1-z}\right)^\alpha
            \left(\frac{1}{z} \log \frac{1}{1-z}\right)^\beta
            \left(\frac{1}{z} \log
            \left(\frac{1}{z} \log \frac{1}{1-z}\right)\right)^\delta.
```

does not depend on the singularity `\zeta`, which is incorrect (and not mentioned at all).

We can either change to

```
        .. MATH::

            [z^n] \left(\frac{1}{1-z/\zeta}\right)^\alpha
            \left(\frac{1}{z/\zeta} \log \frac{1}{1-z/\zeta}\right)^\beta
            \left(\frac{1}{z/\zeta} \log
            \left(\frac{1}{z/\zeta} \log \frac{1}{1-z/\zeta}\right)\right)^\delta.
```

or prepend a `(1/\zeta)^n` to the formula.

The first choice does not look that bad, so I've prepared a patch.
