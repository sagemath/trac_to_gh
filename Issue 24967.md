Keywords: Python2, upgrade

Python 2.7.15 is coming.

Release candidate "Python-2.7.15rc1" is available:

    https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2715rc1/

**Tarball**:

- gz-compressed: https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.15/Python-2.7.15rc1.tgz
- xz-compressed: https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.15/Python-2.7.15rc1.tar.xz

Upgrading to Python 2.7.12 (#19735) and to Python 2.7.13 (#22037)
involved reverting some changes in Python.

Upgrading to Python 2.7.14 (#23815) was smoother, hopefully this one is too.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/25204
