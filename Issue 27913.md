Keywords: abelian group fpsac

The following raises an exception at least on versions 8.7 and 8.9.beta1:

```python
G = AbelianGroup([3, 3])
H = G.subgroup([G.gen()])
H.subgroups()
[snip]
RuntimeError: Gap produced error output
Error, families of <gens> and <M> are different

   executing H:=Subgroup(G,gensH);
```

From a brief overview of src/sage/groups/abelian_gps/abelian_group.py the docs for `AbelianGroup_class.subgroup()` mentions "The 'big' group must be defined using 'named' generators". But trying 

```python
G.<a, b> = AbelianGroup([3, 3])
H = G.subgroup([a])
H.subgroups()
```

gives the same error. Also `AbelianGroup_subgroup.gen()` does not have a default argument for the first generator, like `AbelianGroup_class.gen()` and many of the `gen()` methods in Sage.
