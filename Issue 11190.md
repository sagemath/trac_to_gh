# Issue 11190: showing a Cayley table fails in the notebook due to bad latex code

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: was

Assignee: joyner

In the notebook we have:

```
sage: T = SymmetricGroup(3).multiplication_table()
sage: show(T)
Unknown control sequence '\setlength'
sage: latex(T)
\setlength{\arraycolsep}{2\ex}
\begin{array}{r|*{6}{r}}
\multicolumn{1}{c|}{\ast}&a&b&c&d&e&f\\\hline
{}a&a&b&c&d&e&f\\
{}b&b&a&d&c&f&e\\
{}c&c&e&a&f&b&d\\
{}d&d&f&b&e&a&c\\
{}e&e&c&f&a&d&b\\
{}f&f&d&e&b&c&a\\
\end{array}}
```

I thought this was on #10787, but now I see it is not.  I'm going to point it here.

I've been waiting on `MathJax` before tackling this, on the hope it has better support for tables.

Changing keywords from "" to "latex, jupyter, mathjax".

Still a problem in Jupyter Notebook with Sage 9.2.rc0.

The PR adds a variable `sage.misc.latex_macros.sage_configurable_mathjax_macros` that holds a list of macro definitions that `pretty_print` will include in all LaTeX code that is sent to `MathJax`. The PR then solves the problem on this ticket by adding `\multicolumn` and `\setlength` to this list as no-ops that swallow their arguments.

I don't like the proposed solution. It seems a bandage.

A general solution that would also solve possible future problems would be to introduce a new magic method obj._mathjax_() which provides latex code renderable by mathjax and defaults to an alias of obj._latex_() when it is not defined for obj.

I sympathize with what you are saying, and I considered that solution (except that my idea was to add a keyword (maybe `style="MathJax"`) to the `_latex_` command. But I don't see how to make it will work without massive changes, because an object that does not have a `_mathjax_` method will presumably call the `_latex_` method of its subobjects (or subexpressions) and will therefore not do the right thing for MathJax.

I think of MathJax as being a version of latex, rather than a completely different format, so I think it is reasonable to just add a tweak to make it work better (as in my PR). The variable I added simply makes it possible to add definitions for latex macros that MathJax does not understand, and is completely analogous to the variable `sage_configurable_latex_macros` that is already in sage, which makes it possible to add definitions for sage macros that vanilla latex does not understand.

How about using `_rich_repr_`? This seems a general mechanism to serve the purpose that I have in mind about `_mathjax_`. There are many examples in Sage src.

`MathJax` is a javascript renderer for latex in html, and also sometimes means the subset of latex it supports. On the other hand `LaTeX` is a format for TeX which primarily targets printing.

It seems to me currently there is some unfortunate confused code in this respect in the rich output system in Sage. Perhaps straightening the confused code would give a natural solution of this ticket's problem. I will investigate more.

Stalled in `needs_review` or `needs_info`; likely won't make it into Sage 9.5.
