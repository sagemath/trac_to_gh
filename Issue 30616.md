Tested with https://sagecell.sagemath.org (sorry, I do not have access to 9.2 yet).

```
sage: version()
'SageMath version 9.1, Release Date: 2020-05-20'
```

These two results seem to me inconsistent with one another:

```
sage: limit((-1)^x*exp(x),x=+oo),limit((-1)^x*exp(ln(x)),x=+oo)
(Infinity, und)
```

(if I understand well, the first means "complex infinity", and the second "undefined").

Adding `assume(x,'integer')` or `assume(x>0)` seems to have no effet.

In https://cocalc.com, which has

```
sage: version()
'SageMath version 9.2, Release Date: 2020-10-24'
```

the results are the same.

In 9.3.beta7, it is no longer the same. However, the `und` might come from the `-1`.
If we consider `limit((a)^x*exp(ln(x)),oo)` or `limit((a)^x*x,oo)`, for `0<a<1` the limit is 0, whereas for `1<a`, the limit is `Infinity`.

Also, I think `Infinity` is specifically `Unsigned Infinity`.

If this is actually a bug, it is a Maxima bug.
