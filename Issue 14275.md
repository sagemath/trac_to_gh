Could you also add in the doctest

```
Polyhedron(point_list,base_ring=QQ)
```

and 

```
Polyhedron(point_list,backend='ppl',base_ring=QQ)
```

to give people more hints how to avoid that error?

By the way, is there any reason for having `cdd` as the default backend? On this example it's more than 10 times slower than `ppl`.
