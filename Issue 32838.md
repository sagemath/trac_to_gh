Am I correct in that the `conorm_*` depend on knowing this is an extension and what that extension is? Perhaps we can simplify the implementation by not having this extension class (which otherwise just differs by the base ring, correct?), but instead having the `conorm_*` take an extra argument for a subfield of the base field. This would mean less work to get this data, and we wouldn't have to find a name for a field extension by the field of constants (constant field extension is also awkward to me as a non-expert in this area).

First, thank you for your attention!

> Am I correct in that the `conorm_*` depend on knowing this is an extension and what that extension is? 

Extension of function fields. Yes, of course.

> Perhaps we can simplify the implementation by not having this extension class (which otherwise just differs by the base ring, correct?), but instead having the `conorm_*` take an extra argument for a subfield of the base field. 

`conorm_*` methods use the data `self._embedF` that is computed in the initialization method. If we do not have this extension class `ConstantFieldExtension`, then `conorm_*` methods will take more time to compute the return value. This is inefficient because they are supposed to be invoked many times for a fixed extension (in the code for Jacobians of function fields I am developing).

The name "constant field extension" is standard in the theory of function fields. And there are other "* extensions" like "Artin-Shreier", "Kummer", ..., which could be implemented in future in the same module `function_fields.extensions`.

Okay, thank you. Just take care of the pyflakes (which is also the doctest) failure, and then it is a positive review for me.

Replying to [comment:25 tscrim]:

I will wait for a green patchbot before setting it positive myself. Thank you!

The patchbot is morally green.
