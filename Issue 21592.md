Seems good, but there is 's' at "This functions returns".

Should "optimisation" be "optimization"? Is this some kind of GB-vs-US -english question?

ok, done : "returns" changed to "return"

I do not think that we should try here to do anything about the choice of language (american globish versus english globish).

I can review this later today.

Please see #21752. I think that we could decide that Sage uses US (or GB, whatever) english. Seems little odd to have parameter `line_color` with explanation "The colour to use for lines." Not that big thing of course.
