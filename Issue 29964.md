On mac, it should refer to Xcode.
The linux install instructions should be autogenerated.

I don't quite understand what ` linux install instructions should be autogenerated` mean in this context.

I'm guessing it means that for example in

```
Debian / Ubuntu
    sudo apt-get install git-core
```

the second line is constructed from something like `build/pkgs/git/distros/debian.txt`, or something along those lines.

Yes, that's what I meant - see also #29557

After #29655, we can just link to the spkg page of `git` in the reference manual

Sage development has entered the release candidate phase for 9.3. Setting a new milestone for this ticket based on a cursory review.
