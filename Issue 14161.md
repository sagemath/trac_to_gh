In cmdline.py, one of the doctest checks the exact shebang of ipython ; the attached patch checks there is a shebang trying to run python, but doesn't check exactly how python is run.

Just take another script from `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/` which is unlikely to use some system-wide version / differ in "repackaged" Sage releases?

Why at all did the test fail for you?

I'd like to dig the problem with the value from "ret" in 2 tests. The sqlalchemy tests really duplicate testing in another part of sage I am sure. My solution for that will be to eventually remove it surgically since the only sage spkg handling functionality that it is working and intend to keep is to produce spkg.

I have two like this in cmdline.py and another one in control.py.

And I have a few other places where sage expects an error and doesn't... like a place where it deliberately asks something about a polytope in dimension 7 to a palp program which is supposed to work in dimension at most 6... as debian's (future) palp package goes up to eleven [because sage goes as far], the test fails because the computation actually works.

But let's get back to this ticket : what do you propose it should test? I don't think there is such a thing as "another script from $SAGE_LOCAL/bin/ which is unlikely to use some system-wide version / differ in "repackaged" Sage releases" as Leif put it...

The test that this ticket is about is such a test. If it was only type 2 we could just remove it. But it's really meant as a test of type 1, namely that `sage-location` works.

Well that's interesting, I will drop the test in question shortly from sage-on-gentoo. We now have

```/usr/bin/python-exec-c\n
```

which comes from the new way to handle multiple simultaneous python install at the time in Gentoo. Like I said, it won't be missed if it just test that sage-relocation did its work. We don't do that in sage-on-gentoo anyway. And I am sure you don't want to do that either in a debian package that install sage as part of the system.

While it would be nice to have sage upstream completely distro friendly, there are some divergences at the moment because of slightly different objectives. I am absolutely ready to review this as invalid. As long as sage upstream support something like "sage-relocation" it will make sense to test it. And it won't ever for a project like sage-on-foo.

If you have a sure to work, in both world, alternative to the test I would be ok with it. In the meantime I am not really willing to spend much time on it.

All of this discussion is outdated : debian will patch out any test which doesn't make sense.

I suggest to close as invalid/outdated/obsolete (whatever the trac name is), thanks.

I'm interpreting this as "`sudo` set to invalid", although that's not necessary here.
