Keywords: docker, CI

It would be nice to update our docker images automatically through continuous integration services. Of course it's nice to have these images up-to-date without manual intervention but this is also convenient as a starting point for people who want to use CI for their own branches of Sage (besides the patchbot.)ยน

This ticket proposes recipes for [GitLab](GitLab) CI and CircleCI to build our docker images automatically. On the respective websites, the CI can be configured to push automatically to the Docker Hub. A webhook (on github) can also be used to update the README on Docker Hub automatically.

Steps that need to be taken for this to work:

* Replace all occurences of `saraedum` with `sagemath` in this branch.
* Merge this ticket (i.e., the content of https://github.com/saraedum/sage/tree/gitlabci)
* Setup repositories on Docker Hub for sagemath/sagemath, sagemath/sagemath-cli, sagemath/sagemath-dev to automatically build our github repository.
* Setup sagemath/sagemath on [GitLab](GitLab) to mirror our github repository.
* Increase the time limet on [GitLab](GitLab) (to 36 hours) or provide our own runners.
* Setup an account for sagemath on Circle CI.
* Add Docker Hub credentials on  Circle CI or [GitLab](GitLab).

ยน: I want to run unit tests of an external Sage package, https://github.com/swewers/MCLF. Being able to build a custom docker image which contains some not-yet-merged tickets makes this much easier.

I haven't played much with [GitLab](GitLab) CI and CircleCI, so can't really comment on the details for now. But +1 for the general idea. That would be very helpful.

Julian walked me through this last week and it is very good stuff and I'm +1 on it.

My one concern is that by including the CI configuration files directly in the main Sage repo, it may be difficult to update things quickly if/when they break.  In the long term I'd much prefer it if Sage's 'master' branch were used more like other projects typically do, as a fast-moving development branch where we can easily push changes quickly if need be, particularly for the CI config, for which perhaps we could make a special dispensation.

In the meantime, perhaps the CI builds should be based on a "ci" branch of Sage which, most of the time, would just be kept up to date with `develop`, but that we could also commit to more frequently *if needed*.

Is this still needs_review, or should it be needs_work?

My point was that Sage's "develop" branch moves at a slow pace as it currently does, but we have a separate branch (synced regularly to the current "develop") that is allowed to move faster, more like how most projects use "master".

So it wouldn't just be for continuous integration.  That is, the CI stuff would still be in the main branch, but we would have a separate development branch from "develop" that can be a bit more agile, accept merge requests, etc.

Why would you set `DOCKER_HOST` as a secret?

Forgive me if these are annoying questions--I'm just trying to understand how this all works so that I can continue to help with it in the future.

It looks like in the Dockerfile you've done away with the build for the `sagemath-jupyter` image.  I've always been somewhat split on my feelings about it, but I think in general it has been useful.  It's nice having an image whose default command is just the correct thing to start up the Notebook, because I've had users mess that up before and get confused (e.g. you have to make sure to pass `--ip='*'` and get the quoting right as well.

On a similar note, I was confused by the documentation for `.ci/test-jupyter.sh` where it reads:


```
# Usage: ./test-jupyter.sh sage-jupyter-image [host]
```


This gave me the impression that it should be used verbatim like `./test-jupyter.sh sage-jupyter-image`--as if there were actually an image called "sage-jupyter-image".  This might be clearer if it were documented in a more GNU-like style just as `./test-jupyter.sh IMAGE-NAME [HOST]`, making it clear that the first argument is the name (or hash for that matter) of some Docker image, not necessarily a *specific* image.

I haven't looked at how all the other scripts are documented yet, but I would do them similarly.

Environment variables that are injected into the scripts that are described in `.gitlab-ci.yml` are called secrets in [GitLab](GitLab). They are not necessarily "secret". The `docker` docker image detects whether there is a host called `docker` and then assumes that this host is running `docker:dind` (or something similar.) You can disable this behaviour by explicitly setting `DOCKER_HOST`.

No worries at all. This is all a bit confusing.

Okay, thanks for clarifying the "secrets" thing.  That was definitely confusing me.

I still had to stare at this for a while though to understand what was meant.

Not that I can think of.  It might be something to do with your environment.  The relevant line from the top-level `Makefile` is:


```
     $(MAKE) build/make/Makefile --stop
```


so you would get this error if the `$(MAKE)` variable were somehow set to empty.

I extended the section about docker:dind. Do you think that's enough? The section could go into the README but then again it's absolutely standard in the [GitLab](GitLab) CI world.

Thank you--that's much clearer now, I think.  I would still lean towards explaining this in the Readme, because what's bog standard in GitLab CI, I would think, is at this point virtually unknown to almost everyone else who works on Sage (including me).  Maybe with a link to https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/docker/using_docker_build.html#use-docker-in-docker-executor which helped me understand this.

I say that because this actually impacts how one configures their runner and/or their CI settings, and they're more likely to find it sooner in the README--most people aren't going to want to dig into the details of the `.gitlab-ci.yaml` if they don't have to.

It's only an analogue in the sense that it contains the things that developers usually care about. I think that `-dev` is good for people who are randomly looking for a sagemath image on docker (and know about the nomenclature in Debian,โฆ): with the `-dev` they should know immediately that that's not what they need.

https://github.com/sagemath/docker-images/commit/acbfc7d54d435cf11b6325e93eab2c3dfe9ee48c#diff-9cf7721d3a01b10049e0d9f6e29e4058R45

I think it would be good to keep something like this.  Actually, it's very important for binder to work correctly since it also ensures that it's running the Jupyter installed with Sage.

>  nthiery: I would like to automatically test that this is the case. So
>  actually what's the requirement here? How does binder run this image?

Binder just runs the docker image with appropriate port forwarding,
and then launches in the container the command 'jupyter notebook' from
the path, with the port flag and a few others. At some stage, it was
instead calling directly the command `jupyter-notebook` but presumably
this is no more the case.

The specific requirements are there:

https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dockerfile.html#preparing-your-dockerfile

Notes:

- We enforced the notebook=5 with with a pip install in our previous
  docker image. Since #24168, merged in 8.1, the notebook has been
  upgraded to v5, so the pip install should not be needed anymore.

- Items 4 and 5 do not apply to Sage's docker image; instead they are
  about the (essentially trivial) Dockerfile's that authors of
  binder-enabled repositories will write.

  Btw: Item 5 is new in the documentation; and seems optional at this
  stage.

IIRC it's a little less invasive and works for more use cases.  I can't remember though exactly why I didn't put `sage -sh` in the entrypoint.  I know I tried that and it had various problems.

I did not manage to create swap space inside docker, so we can only use (single core) GCE runners at the moment. Also we can not build from scratch (i.e., master & develop) on [GitLab](GitLab) anymore with shared runners.

We should maybe create a sage group on gitlab where developers get access to more powerful runners. Maybe something we can talk about in Cernay.

I'd be hesitant to move forward on this if it can't build the docs from scratch anymore (though maybe it's not actually that big a problem...?)

That said, I don't want to hold this up any longer.  I just wonder exactly what the plan is for "bootstrapping" the whole system if it can't build a working Sage image from scratch.

Also, have you tried using serial doc build?  I seem to recall that ends up using less RAM, but takes longer of course...

The serial runner might curiously be the culprit here. Somewhere in the sphinx build we seem to be leaking memory. Here I am plotting the memory usage in a serial build just before the call to `sphinxbuild()`:


```
[manifolds] process.memory_info()[0]): 280907776
[dynamics ] process.memory_info()[0]): 349028352
[polynomia] process.memory_info()[0]): 365514752
[repl     ] process.memory_info()[0]): 375050240
[tensor_fr] process.memory_info()[0]): 375050240
[combinat ] process.memory_info()[0]): 382959616
[plot3d   ] process.memory_info()[0]): 1632706560
```


And here is the same if I run this through the pool but with just one process:


```
[manifolds] process.memory_info()[0]): 230350848
[dynamics ] process.memory_info()[0]): 191688704
[polynomia] process.memory_info()[0]): 210935808
[repl     ] process.memory_info()[0]): 176205824
[tensor_fr] process.memory_info()[0]): 163934208
[combinat ] process.memory_info()[0]): 517341184
[plot3d   ] process.memory_info()[0]): 170418176
```


Btw, I am running `./sage -docbuild en/reference inventory` here but that's probably not that important.

that is, assuming my recursive getsizeof function is even right (though I think it has a bug somewhere because it actually goes haywire in `app.env.longtitles`--I don't even know what that object is so it requires some exploration...)

Not right now, but next week I think I will do some refactoring of the docbuild process a bit to ensure that `runsphinx()` is *always* run in a subprocess.  I think that will have a big impact at least in terms of keeping memory leaks under control.

I have some other thoughts I want to try out--that might go quite deep--in terms of keeping doctree sizes under better control too.  But that will probably be a longer effort.

Yes, in #21389 I changed things so that `SAGE_NUM_THREADS=1` meant that *no* subprocesses were created during the docuild.  Originally that was motivated by need for Cygwin, but I don't believe that's necessary anymore (all the fork-related bugs *that I know of*) appear to be fixed.  I also now recognize that this is not good behavior.  As I wrote above, there's an enormous amount of global state that `runsphinx()` leaves around, and trying to clean it all up manually would be very difficult, so it should always be run in a subprocess.

Likewise, simply in the process of building the docs, there is also a lot of global state left in Sage (cached values and the like) which it turns out can eat up a lot of memory, especially after some of the larger docs (like manifolds).  This is likewise difficult to manually clean up.

Even a reversion of #21389 wouldn't fully fix the issue though since there are other parts of the docbuild that call `runsphinx()` without calling it in a subprocess, and those are responsible for quite a bit of unnecessary memory leakage currently (even in parallel doc builds).  So I intend to fix that.

We can follow up on the docbuild discussion elsewhere though, since other than its impact on CI the details of that are orthogonal to this ticket.

There's nothing really major that has changed. The CircleCI setup looks a bit different now but on the inside its mostly the same. Here's a changelog of sorts since you gave it positive_review last:

* I had set SAGE_NUM_THREADS/MAKEOPTS from the host that ran the `docker build` commands not from inside the actual docker containers; the specs of these two machines are sometimes very different on CircleCI. That's fixed now.
* I worked around some docker build bug related to caching and multi-stage builds. I don't really understand what's the problem there but it works now.
* Most of the changes are to make builds for git tags work on CircleCI.
* I started using these images for actual Sage development and found some minor issues in the git setup inside the sagemath-dev image.
* I fixed the pip/openssl issue.

Soโฆdoes it work? It works fine for building from scratch. I've done that for 8.2 and all the betas since then.

I am not sure this is the right location to report on this. Maybe the README about our Docker image on dockerhub should contain some information on where to report issues?

Anyway, I am having trouble with using binder with the docker image for [SageMath](SageMath) 8.2 as currently posted on dockerhub compared to that for 8.1.

Namely, when binder launches Jupyter, its working directory is `/home/sage/sage`, instead of `/home/sage` as before. This means in particular that all the notebooks and files that are copied over from the github repository with the usual `COPY . ${HOME}` are not accessible anymore.

Should WORK_DIR be reset to ${HOME} at the end of the Dockerfile?

I have a problem though: since binder already downloaded an image with tag 8.2, it won't redownload the new version. Is there a way to add an alias tag such as 8.2-1 ?

IIRC, the binder doc suggests `COPY . ${HOME}`; in [sage-binder-env](https://github.com/sagemath/sage-binder-env/), I am indeed adding `--chown=sage:sage`.

I would tend to see the location of the sage install (and in general which ever software is installed) as an implementation detail; but this may be a bias from my use cases of the image!

> What's the status of the Circle-CI builds?  Looking at https://circleci.com/gh/saraedum/sage it hasn't updated in a month and the last 2 builds were failures.

The builds failed because "build-from-clean" does not work anymore (Sage takes too much time now to build.) I have not tried the build-from-latest for a bit. If everything else looks good to you I would run a test of every scenario that I can think of, including these CircleCI builds.

The runners are currently down because the credit card linked to the google cloud account expired. The owner is working on fixing that. The build-from-clean only works with non-shared runners because Sage takes too long to build. The build-from-latest still works with shared runners.

In this case what do you mean by "user namespace"?  You mean like, a personal fork?  I could try that.  Would I need to set up a self-provided runner?  I can do that too (and should practice that anyways).

The dev images are not relevant in this case but still this is unfortunate. More importantly I would like to understand why these are different in size as the docker builds should be the same on both platforms.

This is due to a difference in docker daemon version. I don't know what's the difference between the two images but I know tell CircleCI to build using the latest stable version and both are 635MB in size.

No clue really. `sage -pip` works afaik, so that's good enough for some I think.

I am not sure who would want to install more packages. Since you need to add a bunch of build dependencies, we could consider pointing people to the dev images instead maybe? Actually many optional dependencies should already be detected by the features framework so they could be installed through `apt-get`?

Not for anything that's installed with `sage -i`

For now that's what I've done, and what I suppose we can continue to do for now.  Installing optional packages works for the dev images.

Unfortunately I don't really know. My top showed a python2 process that did not do anything anymore but that apparently was the only thing that make was waiting for. I did not investigate further.

On [GitLab](GitLab) I could not see where it hung because we truncate the logs ourselves and we were already in that portion.

Yes, that's fine. I pushed one to a branch (that's not called develop and not called master) to see if the build-from-latest still works. However, due to quite a bit of SPKG changes, the build timed out in the 3h time limit that is in place for build-from-latest (we use the public shared gitlab runners, and they enforce that time limit.)

The other two runs are one build-from-clean for the develop branch and one build-from-clean for the 8.4.beta1 tag. That's intentional and how [GitLab](GitLab) CI works. The rules don't determine that there are several triggers that come from the same commit. CircleCI does that and it is imho very annoying to work around.

As a result, the develop and the 8.4.beta1 tag on docker hub do not come from the same run of "docker build". But since "docker build" should be reproducible anyway (in particular if we build-from-clean) I don't see this as a problem apart from the wasted resources.

I still feel like we ought to be able to work around that somehow.  I don't see why we would want to do two complete build-from-cleans of the same exact commit just so they wind up with different tags on Docker Hub.

I know you've thought about this more than I have so I'm probably missing something.

It's in the CircleCI configuration file:

```
# To make the build time not too excessive, we seed the build cache with
# sagemath/sagemath-dev:develop. When basic SPKGs change, this does not help much,
# still the full build does usually not exceed CircleCI's limits for open
# source projcets (five hours on 2 vCPUs as of early 2018.)
# You might want to try to build locally or with GitLab CI, see
# `.gitlab-ci.yml` for more options.

Why not build *just* the tags then?

Back to positive review. Only a minor documentation change.

So, I would not disable the CircleCI builds as it does not do any harm:

* We won't configure CircleCI on our sagemath github repository (because it does not work reliably and we are building on [GitLab](GitLab) CI anyway.) so there is not going to be confusing messages there.
* If somebody has a clone of our repo and CircleCI enabled, then these builds only happen if they push to master or develop or if they push a tag (something people usually don't do in forks).
* Finally, it sometimes works. It really seems to be about how much load is on the actual machine that runs your docker container. I've seen builds complete after 4:59 or sometimes after 4:45. If we dropped a standard SPKG (python 2 eventually?) or Cython 2.9.0 or the next GCC is compiling faster for some reason, the builds are going to work reliably.

That said, #26085 should comunicate such things more clearly in the actual CI output.

I would need some logic that decides whether this tag is a "develop" or a "latest" tag. And maybe even have to decide whether this is really "later" than what's currently there. It's certainly doable but I don't see enough of an advantage really.

No, the master branch pushes to the "latest" tag, the develop branch pushes to the "develop" tag. Or, was that not your question maybe?

I just don't see why we should build the exact same thing up to three times every time there's a release.  I looked at what happened when 8.3 was released and that added up to more than 15 hours worth of building (some of it was because push-dockerhub-dev took 2.5 hours??)--all the exact same thing--three times.

I don't know why we need to use the git branch/tag that happens to be being built to determine which docker-tag to push.

Every time 'develop' is updated a tag is created, and every time the tag is for a final release, 'master' also gets updated.  I don't like this process or the branch names but for now it is what it is.  Thus, it's only necessary to trigger a build-from-clean when a tag is created.  With docker you can re-tag the same image as many times as you want and push it to Docker Hub, and that can be done depending on what the version number in the tag is.

So what I'm proposing is to have one build, when a tag is created, with some `<version>` then,

1. Tag the image `sagemath:<version>`; push
2. If the version ends with `.betaN` or `.rcN`, re-tag the image `sagemath:develop`; push
3. Else re-tag the image `sagemath:latest`; push

One build resulting in 2 docker-tags for the same image, each time.

I think, theoretically, the way you do things currently makes sense, and might make sense to revert to at some point, but practically-speaking, right now, I don't see why we should do build-from-clean for anything but tags.

That's not correct, all tags should go to sagemath:develop.

Is it really an issue? It's a couple of hours of build time every week but it would be hardcoding knowledge about our release process which I don't like. Also, I'd like to add the release manager's integration branch to the list of build-from-clean at some point (though they should not go to the docker hub maybe) and then we'd need that one again anyway.

Somehow [7d85dc796](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/commit/7d85dc796c58c3de57401bc22d3587b94e205091) ("Something related to the sphinxbuild seems to be leaking memory") causes the docbuild to segfault on nix. Since the docbuild is running on 4 cores, as far as I can see the commit shouldn't actually change anything. Any idea?

Yet for some reason the documentation built fine on 8.2.beta1 and still builds if I revert that commit. Really weird.

I don't know, what kind of detail are you looking for? Do you happen to know how I can convince python/sphinx to give me a useful stacktrace?

You probably know about this, but try "make V=0" in the sage build. Everything will go into logs only and you can print them on error.
