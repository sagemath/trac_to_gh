Decoders objects in coding theory are associated with a list of types, which are a list of keywords describing to the user the specificites of the underlying decoding algorithm.

For now, the types are not listed nor defined anywhere.

This ticket proposes to create a proper list of types and their definitions.

Could you please mention the files you intend to point out in the sage directory tree ?

Hello,

I intend to create a list of types and their definitions in `decoder.py` (`sage.coding.decoder`), under the generic method `decoder_type`.

Actually, I originally did that in #19897, but after a discussion in #19623, we found that defining precisely types for decoders wasn't such an easy thing, hence this ticket.

Hi,

I do not clearly understand what is asked for.

Is a type something like "always_succes", "unique", "list" and so on ? I would then rather call that a property, since it is not a sage type.

Should that be done with a `codes.decoders.decoder_types()` call, which lists all decoder "types" , with an extremely clear docstring when querying with  `codes.decoders.decoder_types?` ?

I put my comments in the Issue #151 that Johan pointed out to me. It gives a suggestion on redefining the decoder types.

```

I made some improvements:

* Some reformulations.
* Used simpler table format for future modifications.
* The doc was not present on Decoder instances (which is where most users will see them). I wrote introspection code which propagates the doc of `decoder_type` to `_instance_decoder_type` to fix this.

If you're OK, let's get this thing in the air!
