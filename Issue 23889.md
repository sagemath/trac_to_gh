1. In `src/sage/numerical/mip.pyx` and `src/sage/numerical/sdp.pyx`, you can remove the `assert` statements.

2. In `src/sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_element.py`, you still have `list(x.dict().keys())[0]`

3. In `src/sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_element.py` you can simplify

```
range( 0 , max(m[var_idx] for m in monomial_coefficients.keys())+1 )
```

to

```
range(max(m[var_idx] for m in monomial_coefficients) + 1)
```


4. In `src/sage/graphs/graph.py` and `src/sage/graphs/digraph.py`, I would write

```
        if format is None and isinstance(data, dict):
            if not data:
                format = 'dict_of_dicts'

                if isinstance(val, list):
                    format = 'dict_of_lists'
                elif isinstance(val, dict):
                    format = 'dict_of_dicts'
