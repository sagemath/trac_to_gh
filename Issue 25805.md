Hi Pat,

You should not be creating `NestedIntervalRealSet` but use `RealLazyField`. The latter is far from being perfect, but it is exactly inteded for this purpose.

Hi Vincent,

Thank you. Sure, I'll try to switch to RealLazyField. I hadn't realized that you could get intervals from RLF.

The other thing I use is FunctionField. One issue I was having was that it seems not to cancel constants in the numerator and denominator:

```
sage: K.<x>=FunctionField(QQ)
sage: y = (2*x)/(2*(x+1)); y
2*x/(2*x + 2)
sage: y^2
4*x^2/(4*x^2 + 8*x + 4)
```

These constants build up when performing the kind of repeated operations I was doing and slow things down a lot. I deal with this by calling ".factor().expand()" on FunctionField elements at every step, but this also seems slow and I'm not sure if it will work in all fields...

This will not solve your simplification problem but I wonder why these two are different

```
sage: QQ['t'].fraction_field()
Fraction Field of Univariate Polynomial Ring in t over Rational Field
sage: FunctionField(QQ, 't')
Rational function field in t over Rational Field
```

It seems that the second is just a wrapper over the first one

```
sage: K = FunctionField(QQ, 't')
sage: t = K.gen()
sage: parent(t._x) is QQ['t'].fraction_field()
True
sage: 
```


Concerning simplification in fraction field, this is a non-trivial matter and you may want to have a look at

- https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/Pzkkfjhj3XI

If you really want to work with a transcendental extension of QQ then better work with `ZZ['x'].fraction_field()` that apparently works better with simplification.

I switched to `RealLazyField`. I also created a class (and parent) which represents a lazily computed random number in [0,1] (and created a `random_real` convenience function).

I did not address the simplifications problem. I'd like to work in the general case at first. Once people are happy with the general case, I think it will be worth doing some optimization when the base is `QQ` and perhaps also for number fields.

Hi Pat,

Some random thoughts

1. It does not make much sense to generate the bits by packets of 53. I know that 53 is the standard mantissa for double floating point, but in the present situation it would be more natural to use 64 bits. (idem in `_mpfr_` or `_richcmp_`)

2. I don't think that the following is necessary in `_coerce_map_from_`

```
+        if S == self:
+            return True
```


3. Why not make the `LazyRandomElement` an actual element of the real lazy field `RLF`? It would be better than having the ad-hoc `LazyRandomNumberSet_class`.

Hi Vincent,

3. I originally wanted to do this, but I ran into trouble with categories. I made changes in this direction, but I'm still having the issue. Namely `RLF.random()._test_category()` gives an error. It would be great if you could fix or tell me how to fix it.

1. In `LazyRandomNumber` I decided to store representations of `RealIntervalField`s with precision `64*2^k` for `k=0,1,2,...`. Previously, I was doing `53*k`. The new use of exponential growth here means that the memory requirements to get a random number of large precision drop from quadratic to linear (and presumably some algorithm times drop as well).

2. Fixed in second commit above.

4. I noticed a bug in `RealLazyField`: 

```
sage: float(sin(RLF.pi()))
AttributeError: type object 'float' has no attribute 'pi'
```

The same error appears with `RDF` replacing `float`.

I'm thinking we solve issue 3 above, then maybe it makes sense to make `RealTranscendentalExtensionField` support underlying functions fields such as `ZZ['x'].fraction_field()`. I wanted to see that people are happy with this scheme before I put more work in.

This fails for a very bad reason. One quick fix is to change the declaration

```diff
- class LazyRandomNumber(LazyFieldElement):
+ cdef class LazyRandomNumber(LazyFieldElement):
```

(and you probably want to copy the declaration in `real_lazy.pxd`)

For that machinery to work some extra inheritance construction is done on the fly. But this operates differently on Python classes (without cdef) and Cython classes (with cdef). For clearer explanation, you might want to have a look at [Simon King's tutorial](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/thematic_tutorials/coercion_and_categories.html#coercion-and-categories).

An alternative way to solve the problem is to call explicitely the inheritance machinery on your Python class... but the quick fix above is probably nicer.
