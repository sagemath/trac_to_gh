# Issue 14290: HG ignore for eclipse project

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/14494

Original creator: elixyre

Original creation time: 2013-04-26 15:42:03

Assignee: tbd

CC:  nthiery@users.sourceforge.net ncohen

Keywords: hgignore

Hi,

Could you put these following files in .hgignore

.preferences.xml
.project
.pydevproject
and .settings/org.eclipse.core.resources.prefs

These files are automatically created by pydev (Eclipse plugin for Python).

I know HG will die but this is available with Git too...

Replying to [comment:3 elixyre]:

You cannot review your own patch (which lacks author information btw.).

Or should we move this ticket to the "duplicate/invalid/wontfix" milestone (as everybody can add those patterns to his/her `.hgrc`)?

Alternatively, repurpose this ticket to add some information to the Sage Developer's Guide?

I think it doesn't cost us anything to put them in the .hgignore, so we may just as well add it.

The patch needs author and a commit message. While you are at it, it would be nice to have a comment in the `.hgignore` that this is for eclipse-generated files.

I added author, comment and commit message. That's ok?

If you want to add some information to the Sage Dev's Guide, it's ok but I can't do it, my english is too bad...

The fastest way to improve your English is of course to write an essay on how to use Sage with Eclipse....

I can't swear that you will sell many copies, but I'm pretty sure people would find it useful and read it.

Remember to put some ads on the webpage. You never know.. `:-D`

I can try to do that but eclipse is not really more efficient than emacs or whatever IDE... It will be short...
