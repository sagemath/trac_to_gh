Hi,

Could you put these following files in .hgignore

.preferences.xml
.project
.pydevproject
and .settings/org.eclipse.core.resources.prefs

These files are automatically created by pydev (Eclipse plugin for Python).

I know HG will die but this is available with Git too...

Jean-Baptiste

I think it doesn't cost us anything to put them in the .hgignore, so we may just as well add it.

The patch needs author and a commit message. While you are at it, it would be nice to have a comment in the `.hgignore` that this is for eclipse-generated files.
