It seems (but I am not entirely sure) that currently the Symbolic Logic module does not (optionally) use the SAT solver module for the `is_satisfiable()` method. As this can make this method more efficient, it can be a useful addition. (And allow returning a satisfying instance of the variables.)

(N.B.: Both modules seem to have a method outputting DIMACS format.)
