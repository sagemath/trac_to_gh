Assignee: mvngu

In the documentation of the function `tiny_integrals` one can
find:

```
sage: K = pAdicField(17, 5)
sage: E = EllipticCurve(K, [-31/3, -2501/108])
sage: E.tiny_integrals?
...
       P and Q MUST be in the same residue disk for this result to make
```

Here "disk" should read "disc".
