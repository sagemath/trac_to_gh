Keywords: Graph isomorphism

Here are two isomorphic multi-graphs, that are recognized by is_isomorphic as being isomorphic and cause is_isomorphic to crash on certify=True. (Sage-4.6 from source on 64bit-Fedora)


```
sage: G = Graph(multiedges = True, loops = True)
sage: H = Graph(multiedges = True, loops = True)
sage: G.add_edges([(0,1,0),(1,0,1),(1,1,2),(0,0,3)])
sage: H.add_edges([(0,1,3),(1,0,2),(1,1,1),(0,0,0)])
sage: G.is_isomorphic(H, certify=True)

Since there is no code here and the issue is fixed by #10549, which has been merged, I'm closing this ticket.
