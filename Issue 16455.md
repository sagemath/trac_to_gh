Mostly looks good. I think the script `spkg-src` should deleted: it won't work as currently written, and it doesn't look like it's needed with the current version. Otherwise this is good to go.

Concerning spkg-src, I simply renamed spkg-make. The reason is the section on Modified Tarballs at http://sagemath.github.io/git-developer-guide/packaging.html.
