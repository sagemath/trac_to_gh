Current version is 1.3.3, which comes with some improvements that can be useful for smooth integration into Sage. E.g. the nose.loader module is more complete now.

Mostly looks good. I think the script `spkg-src` should deleted: it won't work as currently written, and it doesn't look like it's needed with the current version. Otherwise this is good to go.

Thanks for looking at this so quickly.

Concerning spkg-src, I simply renamed spkg-make. The reason is the section on Modified Tarballs at http://sagemath.github.io/git-developer-guide/packaging.html.

I understand that you renamed spkg-make to spkg-src, but this script won't run successfully: first, it will quit if it doesn't find a file `spkg-make` in the current directory, and second, it expects to find the old-style spkg directory structure, so it expects to find a `src` directory which it will modify. Finally, all it does is remove `.pyc` files, and the most recent version of nose that I downloaded didn't have any of those. So I think it should be deleted.

Sorry about that. I made a copy in my account on boxen (see the modified description), and this should be accessible.
