there is a formatting issue:

```
sage: HilbertClassPolynomialDatabase?
...
       EXAMPLES:
          sage: db = HilbertClassPolynomialDatabase() sage: db[-4]
          # optional Kohel database required x - 1728 sage: db[-7]
          # optional x + 3375 sage: f = db[-23]; f         # optional x^3
          + 3491750*x^2 - 5151296875*x + 12771880859375 sage:
          f.discriminant().factor()    # optional -1 * 5^18 * 7^12 * 11^4
          * 17^2 * 19^2 * 23 sage: db[-23]                      # optional
          x^3 + 3491750*x^2 - 5151296875*x + 12771880859375
```

good work Jean-Pierre. I also checked the examples work with Kohel's database.
