So will this problem be solved once [SageMath](SageMath) is using pynac master? If so should we close this ticket?

The dependency on "pynac-0.7.9" will be replaced with the Pynac upgrade ticket number after that version was released. This ticket should add doctests for the issue. Usually its title is then prepended with "Doctest:" to give a hint to potential reviewers.
