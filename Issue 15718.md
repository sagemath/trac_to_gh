# Issue 15718: import GSoC 2012 Lattice Project

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/15955

Original creator: malb

Original creation time: 2014-03-16 20:37:37

The lattice project from GSoC 2012 was never merged for some reason. As far as I can tell no reason was given on public mailing lists. Perhaps part of the reason is that the author ignored Sage's version control. 

The project is described here:

This ticket was abandoned in favour of #15976. The Sage GSoc 2012 did not offer enough to warrant the trouble of importing it. However, the voronoi cell implementation of this ticket was imported into #15976.

Positive review always needed to close tickets.
