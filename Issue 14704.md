# Issue 14704: Two small issues with make micro_release

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/14908

Original creator: mmezzarobba

Original creation time: 2013-07-18 17:18:21

A trivial patch to experiment with the git workflow...

- the micro_release rule of the Makefile used |&, which is a bash4-ism
- the filtering of error messages did not work in non-English locales

The `working` branch was a workaround until #14781 got resolved.

Please rebase against the `build_system` branch.

I've merged this into the build_system branch at #14480, so I'm marking this as a duplicate so that we can close this ticket now.

Ok, so I've deleted the branch and filled in the Commit field instead.
