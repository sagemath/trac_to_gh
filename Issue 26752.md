There are a few place with code like

```
if(something):
```

This is turned into more pythonic shape.

Why didn't you remove parentheses here?

```
if (p_up[0] <= p_down[0] or p_down[1] <= p_up[1]):
```

Cython style comment: when comparing C pointers, I prefer `is` to `==` to make it clear that we are dealing with object identity (pointers are equal). So I would write `if r != currRing:` as `if r is not currRing:`

Cython performance comment: `product()` is not optimized by Cython, so

```
for (x,y) in product(range(n),range(m)):
```

is a lot slower than a nested loop

```
cdef Py_ssize_t x, y
for x in range(n):
    for y in range(m):
```

I'm not saying that this is necessarily a big problem here, but I thought I should mention it for future reference.
