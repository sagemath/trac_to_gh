# Issue 10439: spkg/install: implement newest_version using a shell function

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Keywords: scripts install newest_version

The shell script `newest_version` should become a shell function in `spkg/install`.  It should also do some error checking, since currently a non-existing package will not signal _any_ error.  A shell function should simply exit with an error message.

Changing component from build to scripts.

It would be nice if a shell function `newest_version()` would also be available for other spkg to check that required versions of dependencies are available. So I'd like it to be in 3rd file `install-functions` (or so) that is sourced by `install`. Perhaps with a better name, for example `requires_version(mpir,1,1,2)`...

Moreover, the current `newest_version` script does not check that it is called from `$SAGE_ROOT/spkg`. If it is called from the wrong directory, I get

```
/home/vbraun/Sage/sage/spkg/standard
[vbraun`@`volker-two standard]$ ./newest_version mpir
mpir-1.2.2.p2
```

on Linux and 

```
vbraun`@`t2:standard$ pwd
/home/vbraun/t2/sage-4.6.1-sunos-32bit-5.10-sun4v-SunOS/spkg/standard
vbraun`@`t2:standard$ ./newest_version mpir
```

(no output) on t2/Solaris.

Changing keywords from "scripts install newest_version" to "scripts install newest_version deps Makefile".

Is the code in data/extcode/debian dead? It uses `newest_version`, but is it relevant anymore?

Otherwise, the changes here make sense, and I've been using this (via #12369) for some time now with no problems. I'll test on a few more systems, and then (pending the answer to my question) I can give it a positive review.

I think that `make distclean` should delete `spkg/Makefile`.

For Debian, see #12470.  Yes, it's unused.

Yes, it should.  Fixed.

Thanks for the review!

Looks like the whole build system will be cleaned up nicely in sage-5.0 (#11073, #12479, #10492,...)

It would be nicer (and more appropriate) to use `basename` (which is POSIX) in `newest_version*()`.




Any reason to _copy_ `spkg/standard/deps` rather than include it by the generated `Makefile`?

It turns out that this change breaks the optional Sage package `database_gap`, since that package uses the `newest_version` script. See #12712.

1) because it looks cleaner to me to have just one Makefile.

2) because I was worried about the portability of including files inside Makefiles.

Well, after copying, we still have two... ;-)

Then you should avoid looking at the eclib package, which does (really) horrible things... B)

(Sage won't build with anything else but GNU `make` anyway, and this will not change in the foreseeable future, since many upstream packages rely on GNU `make` as well.)

Any nice idea of how one could pass some flags just to the top-level `make`, but not to the instances building spkgs?  (I'm thinking of `-k`.)

Assuming that `spkg/Makefile` exists:

```
cd spkg
MAKE="make -S" make -k
```

(not tested)
