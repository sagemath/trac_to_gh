Keywords: complex multiplication

Elliptic curves over the rationals have mathods ``has_cm()`` and ``cm_discriminant()``.  We extend these to curves over number fields, and add a function ``has_rational_cm()`` to indicate the the curve has CM which is defined over its base field (i.e. the CM discriminant is a square in that field), which is always False over QQ.

Done.  This probably counts as rewriting history, too bad.  #16743 will depend on this anyway.

While you're at it, could you change the wording in the first line of the documentation of has_cm for elliptic curves over the rationals to be less ambiguous?

I've seen Complex Multiplication to mean over the base field and to mean over the algebraic closure, so "Returns True iff this elliptic curve has Complex Multiplication." is ambiguous. It could be "Returns True iff this elliptic curve has Complex Multiplication over the algebraic closure." or "Returns True iff this elliptic curve has a CM j-invariant." as in the number field case.

What's the intention of the code

```
try:
    D = self._CMD
    if D:
        return D
    else:
        raise ValueError("%s does not have CM"%self)
except:
    pass
```


which is obviously equivalent to

```
try:
    D = self._CMD
    if D:
        return D
except:
    pass
```


I assume you meant something like

```
try:
    D = self._CMD
except AttributeError:
    pass
else:
    if D:
        return D
    else:
        raise ValueError("%s does not have CM"%self)
```


Apart from this issue, you really should never use `except:` since that catches also `KeyboardInterrupt`.

Apologies, of course I meant to write "except AttributeError".  I do know the rules.

To make absolutely sure:  the field _CMD stores 0 if it has already been determined that E does not have CM, and in this case the method cm_discriminant raises an error -- not my choice but for compatibility with curves over Q.
