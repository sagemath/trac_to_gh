Yeah well. I minimize my changes to the current scripts. So I adapted to what was already there. I loved that line in particular:

```
lbzip2 -d -c "$1" 2>/dev/null || bzip2 -d -c "$1" 2>/dev/null || gzip -d -c "$1" 2>/dev/null || cat "$1"

It does not work. UNIX sed does not understand any command line option with double dashes.

And, by the way, your original regexp does not work because you're confusing [] and \( \).

Do you mean the " ? Are those called "double dashes" ? Does it still fail if you use simple quotes instead, i.e. `sed --posix 's/[\.zip|\.tar|\.gz]*$//g'`

> And, by the way, your original regexp does not work because you're confusing [] and \( \).

Yep yep sorry, I noticed that while working on this new version. Which seems to work reliably, on my distro at least.

By double dashes, he meant the option `--posix`.

On OS X, use the `-E` flag for sed:

```
echo whatever.tar.2.0.zip.tar.gz.tar.tgz | sed -E "s/(\.zip|\.tar|\.gz|\.tgz)*$//g" 
```

But `-E` is not a posix option or a GNU sed option, so I guess we can't use it. A Python script would avoid these compatibility issues.

Hello !

I updated this ticket a bit in order to use the original .zip archive for the bliss package. It is the same version as the one we use, so it is not even a package update and there is no risk of anything. I used to test the ticket, and it works well: if you also agree with it, then we can get it merged.

Thanks,

Nathann
