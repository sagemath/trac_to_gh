# Issue 1182: update freetype.spkg to 2.3.5

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/1182

Original creator: mabshoff

Original creation time: 2007-11-16 02:22:09

Assignee: mabshoff

William did mention it somewhere on sage-devel and I cannot find the reference, but the freetype spkg we ship is very out of date. So update to the current (2.3.5 at the moment of this bug report) release.

Cheers,

Michael

I've put an spkg at http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mhansen/freetype-2.3.5.spkg .  It installs fine on 64-bit Linux.
