# Issue 18183: Uniformize truncated multiplication for polynomials

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: vdelecroix

Original creation time: 2015-05-14 14:09:44

The operation `_mul_trunc` on polynomials is currently only implemented in specialized classes with custom declaration. We define a global one in Polynomial with signature

```
class Polynomial:
    cpdef _mul_trunc(self, Polynomial right, long n)
```


We also add specialized implentation for integer polynomials (relying on `fmpz_poly_mullow`) and rational polynomials (relying on `fmpq_poly_mullow`).

`Polynomial._mul_trunc_` doctest example should have `_mul_trunc_`, not `_mul_trunc`

Why did you add the comment in
`cpdef ModuleElement _rmul_(self, RingElement c) # ??!?`

Because this has nothing to do in `sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_modn_dense_ntl.pxd`. Moreover, it seems to be never used.

It is a good idea to introduce special rule for multiplication by constants. But this should be done globally. I will make the comment clearer.

All right, I can just get rid of the declaration in the pxd file and everything is fine. Let me do it.
