The operation `_mul_trunc` on polynomials is currently only implemented in specialized classes with custom declaration. We define a global one in Polynomial with signature

```
class Polynomial:
    cpdef _mul_trunc(self, Polynomial right, long n)
```


We also add specialized implentation for integer polynomials (relying on `fmpz_poly_mullow`) and rational polynomials (relying on `fmpq_poly_mullow`).

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/18420

Because this has nothing to do in `sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_modn_dense_ntl.pxd`. Moreover, it seems to be never used.

It is a good idea to introduce special rule for multiplication by constants. But this should be done globally. I will make the comment clearer.
