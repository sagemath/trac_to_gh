CC:  was cremona mmezzarobba

This should raise some kind of warning about embeddings.

```
sage: GaussianIntegers = NumberField(x^2+1, 'I').ring_of_integers()
sage: A = GaussianIntegers([2,1])
sage: print A
I + 2
sage: print A.n()
<lots of junk>
RuntimeError: maximum recursion depth exceeded while calling a Python object
```
