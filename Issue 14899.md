# Issue 14899: spkg-install improvements

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/15136

Original creator: felixs

Original creation time: 2013-09-01 15:37:38

Keywords: spkg-install idempotence environment

The build system #14796 works better with some minor tweaks to some spkg-install scripts.

- with idempotence, "keepbuilt" starts to make sense
- without hardwired paths, compiling with packages disabled (=fallback to system) works
- with environment in `$SAGE_ETC/env.d/*`, run time environment is more flexible

these changes are minimal (for each package) and are intended to not break the old build system.

It's too bad this never went anywhere since it was a lot of work.  It seems to be redundant though with what I'm doing with #23160 #22509, and #22510.
