As reported in this sage-support thread:

http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support/browse_thread/thread/793c2bdb3db1f02c

We expect,


```
sage: integral( x / (exp(x) - 1) , (x,0,oo))
pi^2/6
```


but get,


```
sage: integral( x / (exp(x) - 1) , (x,0,oo))
-1/6*pi^2 + limit(-1/2*x^2 + x*log(-e^x + 1) + polylog(2, e^x), x, +Infinity)
```


The above might not be incorrect, but it is not very useful either.

Changing component from symbolics to calculus.

Changing priority from major to minor.

Same result from Maxima 5.27:


```
(%i1) display2d: false;

(%o1) false
(%i2) f: x/(%e^x - 1);

(%o2) x/(%e^x-1)
(%i3) integrate(f, x, 0, inf);

(%o3) 'limit(li[2](%e^x)+x*log(1-%e^x)-x^2/2,x,inf,minus)-%pi^2/6
```

more tests:


```
sage: giac('integrate(x / (exp(x) - 1), x, 0, inf)')
pi^2/6
sage: integrate(x / (exp(x) - 1), x, 0, oo, algorithm='sympy')
integrate(x/(e^x - 1), x, 0, +Infinity)
```


i think this is another reason to make more user friendly the functionality that is offered through giac; stay tuned at the [giac interface wiki](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/symbolics#Giacinterface).
