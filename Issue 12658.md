Keywords: spkg -march=native assembler error Darwin MacOS __GMP_CFLAGS __MPIR_CFLAGS gmp.h

Adding `-march=native` to `CFLAGS` may lead to assembler errors, e.g. on MacOS X with newer GCCs on newer CPUs (e.g. such supporting AVX, which Apple's assembler currently doesn't).

Newer versions of MPIR don't define `__GMP_CFLAGS` (in `gmp.h`) to a *string literal*, but instead to a *preprocessor macro* (`__MPIR_CFLAGS`), which in turn is defined to the string we want.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/12830

If you want MPIR and GMP to store the flags elsewhere, suggest them to create a `pkg-config` file (although "standard" `.pc` files don't have a variable for the compiler used).

We could of course create our own in MPIR's (and GMP's) `spkg-install`, but that doesn't make much sense to me, since then again our other spkgs using the `.pc` file would depend on Sage's versions (and a recent version of Sage itself).

It's for informational purposes; it's not bad to compare (potentially) MPIR's flags to those of a system-wide GMP (or MPIR) installation.

It doesn't hurt, and doesn't break anything.

On the contrary, removing it may break the installation of the spkg on older versions of Sage.

Probably.  Although `testcflags.sh` is currently broken... ;-)

I'm not sure if we should do such a complicated test whenever some arbitrary compiler flag is to be tested.  We'd never know whether the compiler, the assembler or the linker caused an error.

Using it again requires newer versions of Sage for little reason, which I don't like in general.


`testcflags.sh` might have an option to not use `CFLAGS` btw.; otherwise one would have to `(unset CFLAGS; testcflags.sh ...)` or specifically construct `CFLAGS` for the desired purpose.

In which sense is it broken???

Why does it matter whether the compiler, assembler or linker caused the problem?  What matters is that it doesn't work.

> Using it again requires newer versions of Sage for little reason, which I don't like in general.
That I noticed :-)

Using `testcflags.sh` looks like the cleaner and simpler solution to me.

> `testcflags.sh` might have an option to not use `CFLAGS` btw.; otherwise one would have to `(unset CFLAGS; testcflags.sh ...)` or specifically construct `CFLAGS` for the desired purpose.
I think 

```
CFLAGS= testcflags.sh -flag
```

is simple enough.

Why reinvent the wheel?

(And reading `gmp.h` isn't complicated at all, presumably because doing so is intended...)

I don't see the point.  First of all, that would be incompatible to any other MPIR or GMP installation / package, and we'd certainly have to change all packages using such a file whenever we change "Sage's format" (or handling) of MPIR's flags / settings.

You are already reinventing the wheel by manually `sed`ding the flags out of the header file, as opposed to using autoconf.  So if we reinvent the wheel, let's reinvent it as simple as possible.

In your `case` statement:

```
-march=*|-mcpu=*|-mtune*)
```

add `-mpower*` which MPIR also uses.

Of course, I still think the `spkg-install` is overly complicated and re-invents too many wheels.  But since you don't want to give in, I guess I'll have to, otherwise this will never get merged.

And we do use `egrep` in a couple of other spkgs (and probably scripts, too) since quite a while by the way.

In general, the safest way would be to use some `$EGREP`, determined by Sage's `configure`, but that's a different story...
