Keywords: mpc complex numbers multiprecision.org

With the current interface to the MPC library, you cannot add the symbolic i and complex numbers:


```
sage: from sage.rings.complex_mpc import MPComplexField
sage: MPC = MPComplexField()
sage: MPC(1)+i
...
TypeError: unsupported operand parent(s) for '+': 'Complex Field with 53 bits of precision' and 'Symbolic Ring'

```

This work with "usual" complex numbers:


```
sage: CC(1)+i
1.00000000000000 + 1.00000000000000*I

```

Updating ticket description after #18036 was merged in 9.3.beta2.

This, which was failing in the original report, now works:

```
sage: MPC(1) + i
1.00000000000000 + 1.00000000000000*I
```

but this still fails:

```
sage: MPC(1) + SR(i)
```
