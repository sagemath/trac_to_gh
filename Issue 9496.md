Keywords: cryptography, lattices

We introduce a generator for different types of integral lattice bases of row vectors relevant in cryptography.

It offers more variety and better usability than fplll's generator.

I think overall it looks fine, some small points:

* I think the function is too specialised to be in the main namespace, how about crypto.generate_lattice ?
* Could you break lines around 80 characters?
* One shouldn't need to pass a seed, but instead just change the seed with set_random_seed()
* Id' rename ntl_flag to ntl

Hi, I'm having trouble applying your patch on top of the other, many hunks fail. Did you forget to include an intermediate patch (14533?)? Or can you provide a patch with everything rolled into one patch?

I've just uploaded a referee patch which should be applied on top of your patch. It fixes a few formating issues I probably could do quicker than you.Â 

Note that this means that I cannot give this ticket a positive review anymore, I cannot referee my own patch. However, since I sign off on your patch iff my patch is applied afterwards, you can review my patch, i.e. accept my changes. Of course, if you have anything to criticise go for it!
