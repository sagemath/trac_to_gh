# Issue 9496: Crypto lattice basis generator

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/9496

Original creator: rlindner

Original creation time: 2010-07-14 13:36:13

Assignee: mvngu

Keywords: cryptography, lattices

We introduce a generator for different types of integral lattice bases of row vectors relevant in cryptography.

It offers more variety and better usability than fplll's generator.

I think overall it looks fine, some small points:

 * I think the function is too specialised to be in the main namespace, how about crypto.generate_lattice ?
 * Could you break lines around 80 characters?
 * One shouldn't need to pass a seed, but instead just change the seed with set_random_seed()
 * Id' rename ntl_flag to ntl

Changing status from new to needs_work.

Specifically:

 * function is now: sage.crypto.gen_lattice()
 * lines are broken at 79 chars
 * set_random_seed() is honored, but option to use seed remains
 * _flag indicator is removed

Hi, I'm having trouble applying your patch on top of the other, many hunks fail. Did you forget to include an intermediate patch (14533?)? Or can you provide a patch with everything rolled into one patch?

Candidate #2

I recreated 14532.patch to include all changes and could not delete the other file, so I did the next best thing.

apply after other patch

I've just uploaded a referee patch which should be applied on top of your patch. It fixes a few formating issues I probably could do quicker than you.Â 

Note that this means that I cannot give this ticket a positive review anymore, I cannot referee my own patch. However, since I sign off on your patch iff my patch is applied afterwards, you can review my patch, i.e. accept my changes. Of course, if you have anything to criticise go for it!

btw. this is how the result looks like:

Please open a new ticket for your bugfix since this ticket is already closed. Btw.:


```
sage: A
[   1    5   -3    1]
[-290  -14    1    1]
[ -13   -6    6   -1]
[  15   -1    3   62]

sage: A.matrix_from_rows(range(A.nrows())[::-1])
[  15   -1    3   62]
[ -13   -6    6   -1]
[-290  -14    1    1]
[   1    5   -3    1]

```
