I'm fine with these changes, but if we're going to remove the expansion deprecations for `padic_ZZ_pX_CA_element` we should really do it for the others too.


```
padics$ git grep "14825"
local_generic_element.pyx:            See http://trac.sagemath.org/14825 for details.
padic_ZZ_pX_CA_element.pyx:            deprecation(14825, "Interface to expansion has changed; first argument now n")
padic_ZZ_pX_CA_element.pyx:    list = deprecated_function_alias(14825, expansion)
padic_ZZ_pX_CA_element.pyx:    teichmuller_list = deprecated_function_alias(14825, teichmuller_expansion)
padic_ZZ_pX_CR_element.pyx:            deprecation(14825, "Interface to expansion has changed; first argument now n")
padic_ZZ_pX_CR_element.pyx:    list = deprecated_function_alias(14825, expansion)
padic_ZZ_pX_CR_element.pyx:    teichmuller_list = deprecated_function_alias(14825, teichmuller_expansion)

ok. Done. I have left the ones concerning "__getitem__" aside, as they seem to warn about some future change, not yet in sage.

Yeah, I think leaving `__getitem__` alone until we make the change mentioned there seems fine.  Looks good to me.
