Like Binomial Heap, Fibonacci Heap is a collection of trees with min-heap or max-heap property. In Fibonacci Heap, trees can have any shape even all trees can be single nodes (This is unlike Binomial Heap where every tree has to be Binomial Tree). Currently, the Fibonacci heap isn't implemented in stl of c++, but Boost has an implementation of [https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_50_0/doc/html/boost/heap/fibonacci_heap.html](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_50_0/doc/html/boost/heap/fibonacci_heap.html) 

As sage has an interface with Boost, we can have this heap instead of current python heap implemented in Bidirectional_dijkstra.
Using Fibonacci Heap we can reduce time complexity of Decrease-Key, which has importance in Dijkstra and Prim algorithms. With Binary Heap, time complexity of these algorithms is O(VLogV + ELogV). If Fibonacci Heap is used, the time complexity is improved to O(VLogV + E).

Priority queue in c++ implements Binomial heap which gives complexity of:

```
Algorithm      Average	Worst case
Space		O(n)	        O(n)
Search		O(n)	        O(n)
Insert		O(1)	        O(log n)
Delete		O(log n)        O(log n)
Peek		O(1)	        O(1)  
```
whereas 
Fibonacci Heap  reduces complexity Insertion and Decrease key

```
Algorithm      Average	
Insert		Θ(1)	
Find-min	Θ(1)	 
Delete-min	O(log n)	 
Decrease-key	Θ(1)	 
Merge		Θ(1)
```
