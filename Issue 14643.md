I've imported the patch, but currently there are three failing doctests:


```
Failed example:
    whittaker_function(omega[1], w, -1, v)
Expected:
    v^2*B[(-1, -1, 3)] + (v^2-v)*B[(-1, 1, 1)] + (v^2-v)*B[(-1, 0, 2)] + (v^2-v)*B[(0, -1, 2)] + (v^2-2*v+1)*B[(0, 0, 1)]
Got:
    B[(-1, -1, 3)] + (-v+1)*B[(-1, 1, 1)] + (-v+1)*B[(-1, 2, 0)] + (-v+1)*B[(-1, 0, 2)] + (v^2-2*v+1)*B[(1, 0, 0)] + (-v+1)*B[(1, -1, 1)] + (-v+1)*B[(0, -1, 2)] + (v^2-2*v+1)*B[(0, 1, 0)] + (v^2-2*v+1)*B[(0, 0, 1)]

This needs more documentation.

Maybe the failing doctests are due to a change in the behaviour of 'an_element' ?

If somebody is still interested, could she please check the doctests ?

Nicolas and I wrote #14102 at a semester program at ICERM and left this ticket for the number theorists at ICERM to get Sage experience. We were hoping they (Ben Brubaker, ...) would finish this!

I can ask Ben if he would like to (help) finish this when I see him on Monday.

so, six years after, and nobody showing any interest, maybe we should close this one ?

Changing status from needs_info to needs_review.

Changing status from needs_review to needs_work.

More wishlist, but IMO closing a ticket due to a lack of interest is not a good precedent to set.
