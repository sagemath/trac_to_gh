Review branch uploaded.

A few remarks:

I am not 100% sure whether the letter â„“ goes against coding standards, but I have replaced it by a regular l to be safe. The docstrings are sent to latex, and I think latex doesn't like things that aren't ascii.

Also removed all the trailing whitespace.

The error in the iterator I pointed out should either be fixed here or moved to another ticket. Other than this, the ticket is good to go if you think the review changes are fine!

Hi Darij (or Travis),

Could you please open a new ticket for the error in the iterator or else fix the error on this ticket? I don't know exactly what the error is or how to fix it. Then can we set this ticket to positive review? Thanks!
