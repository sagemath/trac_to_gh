# Issue 17591: Move SAGE_TMP to python's tempdir

Issue created by migration from Trac.

`SAGE_TMP` is currently located in `DOT_SAGE`. This patch moves it to [tempfile.tempdir](https://docs.python.org/2/library/tempfile.html#tempfile.tempdir).

This is part of #17185.

This is an important functional change which absolutely should be discussed on `sage-devel` first.

You need to consider also the security implications of this change.

In principle I prefer the real `tmpdir`, but in practice there is some sagenb legacy crud to be considered. In particular, sagenb is potentially a very long-running server that'll rely on fixed temporary directory for the duration of the user login. Might get deleted by tmpwatch while you are on holidays. For the security part: make sure that sagenb with `server_pool` doesn't do anything dangerous, it creates some world-writable directories in there.

If you need long lived temporary files, you need `/var/tmp`, not `/tmp` on Unix.

Maybe yes, maybe no. There is no guarantee that /var/tmp is not just a symlink to /tmp, though usually it is not. There is definitely no guarantee that old files are not cleaned there, too.

Files in `/var/tmp` are supposed to survive a reboot, so I conclude from this that they would be kept alive during a running Sage session too. It is not a problem if `/tmp` and `/var/tmp` point to the same directory, as long as it's not cleaned too often.

The "survive a reboot" part means that `/var/tmp` is supposed to be on a hdd/ssd, whereas most distributions put `/tmp` on a ram disk nowadays. You can count on temp files being kept alive for a few days but not forever.

I missed this ticket, but I've done this as part of #33213 which eliminates SAGE_TMP entirely after adjusting the library to use python's `tempfile` mechanisms instead.
