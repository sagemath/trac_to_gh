giac uses `libnauty` if it finds it, so it should be an optional dependency.

Also, if `libnauty` is not configured to be installed (nor present as a system package), then we should disable its use by `giac`. The corresponding test in `giac`'s configure script is not robust - it explicitly checks in `/usr/local`; which may be disabled on macOS using `-isysroot`.

This is just wrong. `libcliquer` is not a direct dependency of `giac`, it only depends on it through `nauty`.

`libcliquer` is present here. Of course when you look at `ldd`'s output you see all the libraries that are needed in a transitive fashion, so `libcliquer` shows up there. But `libcliquer` doesn't appear to be directly linked to `libgiac` or `giac` for that matter.

This misses the issue of system-wide nauty, which should only be used if it's linked to libcliquer, no?
E.g. on Debian stable I see

```
$ ldd /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libnauty.so
        linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007ffe223f8000)
        libcliquer.so.1 => /lib/libcliquer.so.1 (0x00007e4c9cd43000)
        libc.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0x00007e4c9cb7e000)
        /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007e4c9cfe4000)
```

but apparently this is not the case on Ubuntu 21.

If ubuntu 21 uses a vendored version of cliquer, it doesn't have to be linked to an external library.

That's one of the issue we have here. Some distribution will use external cliquer while some other will not. That's why the branch is just going with "let's just make sure it is always present".

Huh? The problem is that nauty must be linked to libcliquer (vendored or nor), not the other way around.

OK my phrasing may not have been the best. If ubuntu 21's nauty uses a vendored libcliquer - like the sage optional package does - it may not need libcliquer. 

If ubuntu 21's nauty does use an external libcliquer and it isn't installed along nauty then it is a bug in that version of ubuntu.

If it used a vendored libcliquer we won't be seeing this bug reported.
According to https://ubuntu.pkgs.org/21.10/ubuntu-universe-amd64/libnauty2_2.7r1+ds-2_amd64.deb.html `libcliquer` is "Required".
