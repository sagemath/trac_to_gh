giac uses `libnauty` if it finds it, so it should be an optional dependency.

Also, if `libnauty` is not configured to be installed (nor present as a system package), then we should disable its use by `giac`. The corresponding test in `giac`'s configure script is not robust - it explicitly checks in `/usr/local`; which may be disabled on macOS using `-isysroot`.

This is just wrong. `libcliquer` is not a direct dependency of `giac`, it only depends on it through `nauty`.

If it used a vendored libcliquer we won't be seeing this bug reported.
According to https://ubuntu.pkgs.org/21.10/ubuntu-universe-amd64/libnauty2_2.7r1+ds-2_amd64.deb.html `libcliquer` is "Required".
