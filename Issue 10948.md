During an `ask.sagemath.org` response (see [symbolic polynomial euclidean algorithm](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/461/symbolic-polynomial-euclidean-algorithm?answer=818#818)) I came across a bug in computing the GCD of two elements of a polynomial ring over an extension field. For example:


```
sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(QQ,'x')
sage: p = x^2-2
sage: q = x^2-3
sage: K.<a,b> = QQ.extension([p,q])
sage: S.<x> = PolynomialRing(K,'x')
sage: f = a*x^2 * (x-1); g = a*x^2 * (x-b)
sage: f.gcd(g)
x^2
```


However, the result should be `a*x^2`.

Mathematical mistake. ``a`` is a unit in $QQ(a,b)$ so it's not part of the GCD. This ticket is not an issue / defect.
