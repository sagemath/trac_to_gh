# Issue 29915: sage_setup: Modify clean_stale_files to support out-of-tree namespace packages

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/30152

Original creator: mkoeppe

Original creation time: 2020-07-16 04:24:10

Follow-up from #28925.

We modify `clean_stale_files` so that the incremental install logic of sagelib can work even if we want to install namespace packages in addition to sagelib, such as:

- `sage.numerical.backends.coin_backend`. The package `sage.numerical.backends` is turned into a namespace package. It serves as an example of a module in a namespace package that is maintained outside of the sage source tree (here: https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage-numerical-backends-namespace)
