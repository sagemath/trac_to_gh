A block to take care of when the 4.3.1 merge cycle starts is that mhansen did some merging in I think

   /scratch/mhansen/release/4.3/4.3.rc1

which might not have been reflected in the final 4.3 release.  This could have resulted in tickets marked as closed when they weren't closed.

See #7769 for one possible such issue.
