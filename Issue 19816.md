Keywords: singularity analysis

Refactor `singularity_analysis` (#19944) so that it accepts a singular expansion obtained by other means. Without #20050, this is a bit hard to explain. In the end, with #20050 implemented, the dual choice of output (with singular expansions) could be omitted: if users want to have singular expansions (in order to show them in their paper, for instance), they could convert it into a singular expansion by using #20050 (or its dependents) and then feed it into `singularity_analysis`.

See #17601 for the asymptotic expansions meta ticket.

* Option 1: forbid more than one singularity
* Option 2: `function` could be a list of singular expansions
* Option 3: `function` could be a dictionary, as it is the case for the output when selected.

I do not like option 3, as it is not relevant once #20050 is implemented.

This is now a complete rewrite following yesterday's discussions and #20056.

I now think that this is basically the point that we can reach without #20050, so this now awaits your review.

I've reviewed this implementation, and I only have one comment:

Could you revise the docstring of `AsymptoticExpansion._singularity_analysis_`? Because 

1. `var` can also be the generator of an asymptotic ring, 
2. `zeta` is the location of the singularity, and 
3. `precision` is **not** set to the default precision of the ring if it is omitted, but has the same behavior as the `SingularityAnalysis` method in the generators.

Do we want that the current behavior from 3 happens, so that the asymptotic contribution has the same precision as the singular expansion by default? Would be worth considering IMHO.

Other than that, `positive_review` form my side.

Yes, this would certainly be a new ticket, and I think that this is definitely worth opening one.
