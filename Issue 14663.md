Pari's qfminim function (see http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/dochtml/html.stable/Vectors,_matrices,_linear_algebra_and_sets.html for details ) takes an optional flag as a 3rd argument. (This is needed for non-integral quadratic forms). However, currently you can't call qfminim with a 3rd argument without specifying the 2nd argument, which is a limit on the number of vectors returned.

I have written a patch which allows us to set max = -1 which causes all vectors to returned.
I have also improved the documentation for this function somewhat.

Can you edit the docstring's INPUT section so that all the input parameters are listed (together with what they mean), and have an OUTPUT section after that?  Currently they are a bit mixed up.  (Surely the meaning of input param. B is that all vectors of norm <= B are returned, not =B?)

Also the indentation looks wrong in the changed line of code.

I'll come back and review this again when these are fixed!
