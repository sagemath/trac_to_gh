# Issue 31132: Support jupyter-qtconsole

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31369

Original creator: mmezzarobba

Currently:
* As far as I understand, there is no simple way to use the sagemath kernel from Sage-the-distribution with jupyter-qtconsole. In particular, running `jupyter qtconsole --kernel sagemath` from `sage -sh` doesn't do what I would expect.
* With a system-wide install of Sage from the Debian package, `jupyter qtconsole --kernel sagemath` sort of works, but crashes when one attempts tab completion on a Sage object.
