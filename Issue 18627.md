Hello!

Cool! Takes and Kosters algorithm! I really like the way it works (since it is also the base of one of my algorithms [1,2]) :)

I have a few doubts about the code:

* if I understood well your code, the starting vertices of the BFSes are chosen in decreasing order of degree. This way, upper bounds are quite good, but lower bounds are not very good, and the running time does not decrease much. Instead, you should alternate between vertices where UB is high and vertices where LB is low (if you want, you can also use degrees as tie-break).
* do you really need to store vector ecc? Can't it be replaced by LB or UB?
* I think you should handle separately the case when the graph is not connected. Otherwise, the first visits will start from the giant component, and for each vertex in the giant component the lower bound will be `ecc[v] - distances[w]=INT32_MAX-distances[w]`, and the upper bound will be `INT32_MAX`, so you will need a lot of BFSes, probably, instead of simply returning an array of `INT32_MAX` after the first BFS.
* `ecc[v] = INT32_MAX if tmp>n else tmp`: I think it is better to use an integer variable named `eccv`, since you use it O(n) times later.
* you return a vector `ecc` of length `3n`: why don't you use two different vectors for `LB` and `UB`, so that they are freed when the function returns?
* for i in range(n): UB[i] = INT32_MAX: can't you use memset?

Other, more general, remarks:

* this algorithm can be used to compute the radius (resp. diameter), by stopping as soon as LB is big enough (resp. UB is small enough). I think you could add a flag to stop the execution before, in case only the radius or the diameter is needed.
* maybe you could add this algorithm to the list of diameter algorithms (see previous remark).

This is true, but so far I don't know how to do this efficiently. Any guess?

Done

Otherwise, the first visits will start from the giant component, and for each vertex in the giant component the lower bound will be `ecc[v] - distances[w]=INT32_MAX-distances[w]`, and the upper bound will be `INT32_MAX`, so you will need a lot of BFSes, probably, instead of simply returning an array of `INT32_MAX` after the first BFS.
This is now handled directly in method `eccentricity`, plus I have some easy test in method `c_eccentricity_bounds`.
 
>  * `ecc[v] = INT32_MAX if tmp>n else tmp`: I think it is better to use an integer variable named `eccv`, since you use it O(n) times later.
Somehow done
 
>  * you return a vector `ecc` of length `3n`: why don't you use two different vectors for `LB` and `UB`, so that they are freed when the function returns?
Now returning `LB` of length `n`.

Now yes since I changed types to uint32_t.

Is it correct for both graphs and digraphs?

Thanks for all the comments.

You don't need to. This operation is done at each loop, and each loop performs a BFS (that needs time O(m)), so you can afford to spend time O(n) to find the right vertex. You can do it either when you update bounds, or in a new line, for instance:


```
cdef uint_32 next = UINT32_MAX
for w in W:
    LB[w] = max(LB[w], max(LB[v] - distances[w], distances[w]))
    UB[w] = min(UB[w], LB[v] + distances[w])
    if LB[w]==UB[w]:
        W.remove(w)
    else:
        if next == UINT32_MAX or (iter % 2 == 0 and LB[w] < LB[next]) or (iter % 2 == 1 and UB[w] > UB[next]):
            next = w

```

Obviously, then you need to replace v = W.pop() with v = next, you need to set next at the beginning (for instance, as the maximum degree vertex), and you have to remove the line where you sort W.

No, this algorithm only works for graphs. For digraphs, you need [1] in the case of strongly connected digraphs, [2] in general (anyway, if you define the eccentricity of a vertex to be infinite if it cannot reach all other vertices, the general case is easily solvable from the strongly connected case).

In any case, before running the algorithm, you need to check that the graph is undirected.

> Thanks for all the comments.

You are welcome! Thank you for implementing this nice algorithm!

I have implemented a new version of the next node selection.

Concerning the possible use for diameter and centers computation, since I don't know yet how to do it, I prefer to let it for another patch. Also, so far the eccentricity of all the vertices of non (strongly) connected (di)graphs is set to infinity.

Hellooooo!

Great, now the algorithm should be much faster!

I think there is still a problem with directed graphs: the Takes-Kosters algorithm works only on undirected graphs, so I think you should add a `ValueError` if the user asks the Takes-Kosters algorithm on directed graphs. I would add at the top of c_eccentricity_bounding


```
if G.is_directed():
    raise ValueError("The bounds method only works on undirected graphs.")

```

After you correct this, I will try to perform a more extensive testing, and I will provide a positive review!

Little bug: you set `next_v = W[0]` before computing bounds, but then `W[0]` might be eliminated from `W`, and you end up with a non-existing `next_v`. Example:


```
sage: from sage.graphs.distances_all_pairs import eccentricity
sage: tmp = eccentricity(graphs.PathGraph(50), method='bounds')
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    891     cdef uint32_t * ecc
    892     if method=="bounds":

--> 789         W.remove(v)
    790         cpt += 1
    791 

ValueError: list.remove(x): x not in list

```

Moreover, I don't like that if you ask for the eccentricity of a directed graph, then the default algorithm does not work.


```
sage: tmp = eccentricity(digraphs.Path(10))
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)

    886         elif not G.is_strongly_connected():
    887             return [Infinity]*n

ValueError: The 'bounds' method only works on undirected graphs.

```

Apart from these, build is OK, documentation is OK, and I still have to perform all tests (tests from this package are OK).

Have fuuuuuuuuuuuun!

Sorry, I forgot a few things:


```
sage: eccentricity(digraphs.Path(2), method='standard')
[+Infinity, +Infinity]

```

I think that the eccentricity of the first vertex should be 1.

> Do you know similar algorithm for digraphs?

Yep, the papers [1,2] from previous comments generalize this method to directed graphs (actually, they stop the computation as soon as diameter and radius are found, but they work also to compute all eccentricities). Intuitively, if the directed graph is strongly connected, you keep forward and backward eccentricities for all vertices (backward eccentricity means eccentricity in the reverse graph). Then, you need four bounds (UF, LF, UB, LB for forward and backward eccentricity, respectively), and at each step you perform a forward and backward visit from v. Then, you bound

UF[w] = d(w,v)+eccF(v)

LF[w] = max(d(w,v), eccF(v)-d(v, w))

UB[w] = eccB(v)+d(v,w)

LB[w] = max(d(w,v), eccB(v)-d(w,v)).

The remainder of the algorithm is quite similar to the existing one.

If you want to implement also the directed algorithm, or if this "intuitive idea" is not clear, please ask and I will provide more details.

Another correction in the documentation:


```
    INPUT:

    - ``G`` -- a Graph or a DiGraph.

    - ``method`` -- (default: 'standard') name of the method used to compute the
      eccentricity of the vertices. Available methods are `'standard'` which
      performs a BFS from each vertex and `'bounds'` which uses the fast
      algorithm proposed in [TK13]_ for undirected graphs.

    EXAMPLE:

        sage: from sage.graphs.distances_all_pairs import eccentricity
        sage: g = graphs.PetersenGraph()
        sage: eccentricity(g)
        [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]

```

I think you should write `EXAMPLE::` instead of `EXAMPLE:`. Since we are already here, I would also add ```` instead of ``` in the name of the possible methods (standard, bounds). The modification should be as follows.


```
``method`` -- (default: ``'standard'``) name of the method used to compute the
      eccentricity of the vertices. Available methods are ``'standard'`` which

Hello!

I am a bit puzzled by the use of bitset (probably because I know very little about it). You use the same bitset both for the BFS and to keep track of vertices in W. Hence, if the graph is connected, when you perform `while w!=-1:` the bitset contains everything and you iterate over all vertices. Why don't you simply use `for w in range(n):`? You can then replace the outer while loop with `while next_v!=UINT32_MAX:`, I think.

Otherwise, maybe you should use two different bitsets.

Am I missing something?

Michele

Ok, for me now the patch is good to go.

I have run the doctest for the whole Sage, and I got an error, but it is probably not related to this ticket.

Indeed, I run again the same doctest and it worked.

Last thing: if you have time, you just wrote


```
if LB[w]==UB[w]:
    continue
elif ...
    do something
```

Maybe it is better to write


```
if LB[w]==UB[w] and (...):
    do something

```

Anyway, I think you can also leave it as it is.

Thank you very much, David!

Can you guys settle on a pattern where you return Sage integers everywhere? Not only would that then work on 32-bit as well, it would also give Sage a consistent user interface. `graph.radius().factor()` should just work.
