ADD DESCRIPTION

On 2014-01-01 John Cremona published an update of his database

database_cremona_ellcurve should be updated accordingly.

Why the dependency?

Because your branch contains code from that ticket.

Ah, so you noticed that I had borrowed from the other spkg-install script.  OK, no hurry!

There is a merge conflict in `build/pkgs/database_cremona_ellcurve/spkg-install`.

I suppose that this is the sort of thing we will have to get used to.  I based my branch on what was then the develop branch, and that has now changed.  I don't think that I know how to fix this easily, but will have to learn!  But I have to go and teach now...

Am I right that while pulling this branch itself does work, merging with the current develop branch does not?

Comment by cremona created at 2014-01-06 21:04:21

I do not know what to do.  I have a rebased commit, but I can only push that here using the force option which comes with a lot of warnings.  Is that the right thing to do?

Once you have rebased, yes.

The merge conflict which I had to fix was in spkg-install.  I hope this commit is ok.

Just for future reference, we recommend that you don't rebase branches that are already on trac. Its better to only do merges once something is already out in public. If you rebase accidentally you can always go back (e.g. re-checkout from trac or using the reflog, see the developer guide) and perform a merge instead.

Volker I know that perfectly well but this was a trivial thing where no-one in their right minds could possibly have based new work on the original branch, and I did it only after consulting the reviewer.

I believe that we ought to be able to completely scrap a branch and start again;  if anyone else has based work on that branch then that is their responsibility.

Comment by vbraun created at 2014-01-07 09:38:55

Scrapping a branch (=abandoning) is perfectly fine, it just transfers the responsibility for the commits that you made to whoever branched off of them. The problem with rebase is that it'll create two distinct commits (different SHA1) that add/remove the same lines. This then results into conflicts if you try to merge both.

In any case, I'm not saying that we need to do anything on this ticket. I'm just trying to spread the word...

Comment by cremona created at 2014-01-07 10:27:13

OK so there is a new branch now called u/cremona/ticket/15614a which contains the same changes but I branched off the current develop instead.  Thtis seems like a very un-git-ish thing to do:  I copied the four changed files to a separate place, deleted my old branch, created a new one, copied the files back and made that into a new commit.  I certainly would not like to do this with a piece of real work.

I also deleted the old version using git push trac :u/cremona/ticket/15614

Now how many rules have I broken?!

John, I am preparing a small reviewer patch (mostly fixing some documentation).

However, I noticed the following in `src/sage/databases/cremona.py`:

```
        EXAMPLES::

            sage: c = CremonaDatabase()
            sage: c.elliptic_curve_from_ainvs([0, -1, 1, -10, -20])
            Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 + y = x^3 - x^2 - 10*x - 20 over Rational Field
            sage: c.elliptic_curve_from_ainvs([1, 0, 0, -101, 382])  # optional - database_cremona_ellcurve
            Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 + x*y = x^3 - 101*x + 382 over Rational Field

        Old (pre-2006) Cremona labels are not allowed::

            sage: c.elliptic_curve('9450KKKK1')
            Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 + x*y + y = x^3 - x^2 - 5*x + 7 over Rational Field
```

Is the "not allowed" simply a typo for "allowed" or is something deeper going on?

It's a typo.  I think it used to be true that the old labels were not allowed and this test showed an error.  It was probably me who changed that to a working test but slipped up.

I approve of your other changes, so if you would remove "not" we can proceed.  Thanks!

Thanks!  Future updates will be easier to implement since only the package name and checksum files will need to be changed from now on.

For the record, when I said "scrap a branch" then I meant abandon that approach. Just starting over and doing exactly the same changes on top of a different base commit == rebase (except in a very cumbersome way, git rebase would have done that automatically).

OK, so what I did was just that - a manual rebase, masquarading as a fresh start, to replace the git rebase.  I still don't know what I should have done instead, as merging seemed a lot more complicated to me (it is what I did first but never pushed): I had to manually edit out the conflicts in the spkg-install file and the resulting history was a lot messier.

I hope this will not stop you merging these changes, Volker, you have been extremely efficient at merging in the last few weeks!
