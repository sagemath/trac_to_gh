Volker I know that perfectly well but this was a trivial thing where no-one in their right minds could possibly have based new work on the original branch, and I did it only after consulting the reviewer.

I believe that we ought to be able to completely scrap a branch and start again;  if anyone else has based work on that branch then that is their responsibility.

John, I am preparing a small reviewer patch (mostly fixing some documentation).

However, I noticed the following in `src/sage/databases/cremona.py`:

```
        EXAMPLES::

            sage: c = CremonaDatabase()
            sage: c.elliptic_curve_from_ainvs([0, -1, 1, -10, -20])
            Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 + y = x^3 - x^2 - 10*x - 20 over Rational Field
            sage: c.elliptic_curve_from_ainvs([1, 0, 0, -101, 382])  # optional - database_cremona_ellcurve
            Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 + x*y = x^3 - 101*x + 382 over Rational Field

        Old (pre-2006) Cremona labels are not allowed::

            sage: c.elliptic_curve('9450KKKK1')
            Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 + x*y + y = x^3 - x^2 - 5*x + 7 over Rational Field
```

Is the "not allowed" simply a typo for "allowed" or is something deeper going on?

> Is the "not allowed" simply a typo for "allowed" or is something deeper going on?

It's a typo.  I think it used to be true that the old labels were not allowed and this test showed an error.  It was probably me who changed that to a working test but slipped up.

I approve of your other changes, so if you would remove "not" we can proceed.  Thanks!

For the record, when I said "scrap a branch" then I meant abandon that approach. Just starting over and doing exactly the same changes on top of a different base commit == rebase (except in a very cumbersome way, git rebase would have done that automatically).

I hope this will not stop you merging these changes, Volker, you have been extremely efficient at merging in the last few weeks!
