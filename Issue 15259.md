From google spreadsheet which no one reads `X-(`

```
sage: integrate(x^2/exp(-1/(x^2+1))/(x^2+1),(x,-infinity,infinity)).n()
-3.3357920860949157
```

Wolfram alpha [gives the correct answer](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=integrate+x<sup>2/exp(-1/(x</sup>2%2B1))/(x^2%2B1)+from+-infinity+to+infinity).

The problem comes from here:

```
sage: D=1.00000000000000*x^2*e^(1/(x^2 + 1.00000000000000))/(x^2 + 1.00000000000
....: 000)
sage: numerical_integral(D,-oo,+oo)
(-3.3357920860949157, 4.262178610048295e-09)
```
and in one specific algorithm

```
sage: numerical_integral(D,-oo,+oo, algorithm="qag")
(-3.3357920860949157, 4.262178610048295e-09)
sage: numerical_integral(D,-oo,+oo, algorithm="qng")
(nan, nan)
sage: numerical_integral(D,-oo,+oo, algorithm="qags")
(nan, nan)
```
and this case is handled by
`gsl_integration_qagi`

And the problem can be cut into two parts:

```
sage: numerical_integral(D,0,+oo)
(-1.6678960430474579, 2.1310893050241475e-09)
sage: numerical_integral(D,-oo,0)
(-1.6678960430474579, 2.1310893050241475e-09)
```

This is not a symbolic Maxima problem, as the integral is just returned, so it's something about how we evaluate `n` on these unevaluated integrals.
