From google spreadsheet which no one reads `X-(`


```
sage: integrate(x^2/exp(-1/(x^2+1))/(x^2+1),(x,-infinity,infinity)).n()
-3.3357920860949157
```


Wolfram alpha [gives the correct answer](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=integrate+x<sup>2/exp(-1/(x</sup>2%2B1))/(x^2%2B1)+from+-infinity+to+infinity).

This is not a symbolic Maxima problem, as the integral is just returned, so it's something about how we evaluate `n` on these unevaluated integrals.
