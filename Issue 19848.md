# Issue 19848: Upgrade pynac to next version

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/20085

Original creator: cheuberg

Original creation time: 2016-02-19 09:22:58

CC:  behackl rws

Keywords: pynac

Trac #20082 describes a bug which has since then been fixed in pynac's master branch. Thus upgrade pynac.

Until there is a new released version of pynac, we use commit  8dd22de of pynac master.

You're sure you want to serve the binary to all people installing Sage from source, even if the release maintainer allows it? Note also that I test Pynac fully before a new version, so you need to do a `make ptestlong` yourself before giving positive review.

I do not understand what you mean here.

The ticket is not even in `needs_review` state yet; if you intend to release a new pynac release soon, I would just wait for that (and update the branch then).

The main purpose of the ticket is to have a workaround for #20082 _now_ because it bites me in my current work.

I was wrong in thinking that the above link at benjamin.hackl.at is distributed by the release manager. Sorry for the confusion.

Is there a particular reason for choosing milestone "sage-7.2"?

I always change it blindly to the highest. I don't know why there is a 7.2 when usually the highest is the same as the current version.

Is it important? Wouldn't the release manager merge it anyway with positive review, regardless of version? Would he wait?
