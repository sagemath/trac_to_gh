I believe (almost?) all of these could be changed to `foo(x) for x in bar`.

Not really. I have changed 3 of them where this is true.

Other are either iterators, or documentation explaining how to work with iterators, and cannot or should not be changed to avoid map.

In the file combinat/tutorial, I am sort of undoing a wrong move of mine in a previous ticket, that was not correct in the context of the explanations about iterators.

I've changed the ones that are iterators to either return a generator object or to do the iteration explicitly.

ok, I see. Thanks. Looks good. Maybe one should also undo my change from xrange to range in src/sage/combinat/words/word_infinite_datatypes.py

otherwise, once the bot is green this is a positive review from me

maybe it would be worth to revisit #21364 with the idea of trying to avoid map also there..
