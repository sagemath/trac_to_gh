Not really. I have changed 3 of them where this is true.

Other are either iterators, or documentation explaining how to work with iterators, and cannot or should not be changed to avoid map.

In the file combinat/tutorial, I am sort of undoing a wrong move of mine in a previous ticket, that was not correct in the context of the explanations about iterators.
