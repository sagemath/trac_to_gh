# Issue 28369: CombinatorialPolyhedron: unbounded -> is_bounded

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28606

Original creator: @kliem

Original creation time: 2019-10-15 09:03:39

CC:  jipilab @laisrast

Keywords: polytopes, combinatorial polyhedron

In order to make `CombinatorialPolyhedron` to be more consistent with standard naming conventions replace the method `unbounded` by `is_bounded` and the attribute `unbounded` by `bounded`.

Just a very small change: The docstring of `is_bounded` should now say:

```diff
      cdef bint is_bounded(self):
         r"""
-         Return whether the polyhedron is unbounded.
+         Return whether the polyhedron is bounded.
         """
         return self._bounded
```

Actually the last commit is a small fix in doc and applying the changes to #28625.

There are failing doctests:

This seems to be caused by #28605.

Just removing `.cc` to get rid of the empty folder doesn't seems to work.

Rebased it to #28605 so that there is only one commit now.
