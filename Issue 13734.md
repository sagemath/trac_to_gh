This is a follow-up to #13032.  After consulting [sage-devel](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/sage-devel/QRIRSL4qk7I), it seems like a bad idea to set `CCACHE_DIR`, so let's not do this.

Blocker because #13032 is a regression for people using a system-wide ccache installation.

Diff for the ccache spkg, for review only

This appears to implement (1) from the sage-devel discussion, but to me it seemed like (3) was more the consensus from that thread. If (1) is the consensus, then this looks fine to me.

Yes, this implements (1).  After looking at the thread again, I'd say that (1) was the consensus.

This looks good to me. I installed the spkg and the patch, and got no surprises. Tried out some small package like cliquer and it finished within 2 sec, cython took 22sec.

`@`ohanar: since you are the main author of the ccache ticket, I will wait for your input - if you have no objection, then set it to positive review.
