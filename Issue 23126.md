Inspired by [this question on ask.sagemath](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/38163/how-to-set-options-to-sage-t-when-running-make-ptestlong/), we add a little documentation: what do you do if you want to run `make ptestlong` but with extra testing options like `--verbose` or `--show-skipped`?

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/23363
