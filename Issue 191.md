It would be very nice if SAGE had a large table/database of prime numbers.

For example, on the number theory list:


```
Look in the file
 
http://homes.cerias.purdue.edu/~ssw/bell/r1
 
for the factorizations of p^p - 1 for most p < 180.
 
(If you change "r1" to "r2", you get the factors of p^p + 1.)
 
For the meaning of the "L" and "M" notation, see the papers at
 
http://homes.cerias.purdue.edu/~ssw/bell/index.html
```

So a person really wanted to factor some numbers p^p -1, but couldn't
with PARI.  If SAGE had tables of the factorizations of those numbers,
it could have done it via a lookup, and the verbose message could have
given the above reference.  Something similar would be good for a huge
range of classes of prime numbers.   This would be an excellent student
project.

What I usually do in this situation is to set the ticket to "needs review" with a message saying I think it ought to be closed. Then if someone else agrees, we can set it to "positive review", and then it'll show up in the list of tickets to be merged in the next release. Then the release manager will close it. In this case, I've put it at "positive review", since I agree with your claim that it should be fixed. 

BTW, I'm not sure "duplicate" is fair; this ticket has been open for years, so #7239 was a duplicate of this one rather than the other way round. Perhaps "fixed" is the most appropriate resolution. But that is for the release manager to decide.
