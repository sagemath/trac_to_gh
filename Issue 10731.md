This patch takes Robert's patch and adds documentation to show it works, as well as adding a little so this module is at 100%.    Only the documentation needs review, hopefully should be fine.  Looks good in the ref manual, should check this out.

Followup ticket: There are some multiline plots in this file that do not work in the live documentation because of using slashes to continue lines, which apparently Sphinx doesn't pick up.  See #10922.
