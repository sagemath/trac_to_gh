This is essentially a wrapper around pari's `idealchinese` function (https://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/dochtml/html/General_number_fields.html#idealchinese) but I allowed arbitrary ideals rather than just primes.

This function is helpful for computing chinese remainder theorem type problems where the moduli are given by ideals in number fields.

Please add an empty line after the first line of the doc.

And use the pari link syntax in the doc

```diff
+        This is a wrapper around the pari function :pari:`idealchinese`.
```

Thanks for pointing out some issues in the docstring! I added an extra space and the pari link syntax as suggested.

A small nit: It seems like the patchbot is complaining about you using "Returns" rather than "Return" in the Output block.

Besides that, LGTM.

I think I changed the right "Return" now, but if I missed one let me know. Where can I see the output of patchbot?

Thanks!

https://patchbot.sagemath.org/ticket/30426/, it's also what's now the green check mark at the top right of the page.
