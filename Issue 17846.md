Just an idea:

Logically, we can't really ask an object to inject itself into "the" globals namespace, because the object doesn't really have access to what that namespace is in the relevant situation.

Instead what one *can* do from the REPL is to bind an object to its print name, which is what injection usually does. Then one actually doesn't need any special machinery on objects. See:
[http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/17958#comment:54](http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/17958#comment:54)

In principle then one can spell:

```
sage: x = SR.var('x')
sage: inject(x)
```
where `inject` could be defined in the "global scope" (by injecting its definition into the start-up, like `.sage`):

```
def inject(a):
    globals[str(a)]=a
```
except that we'd want to do some validation on `str(a)` before we do that.
It can also be shortened to `inject(SR.var('x'))` to avoid repetition.

Of course to *type* this is very inconvenient, so we'd need some further wrappers to make the syntax more palatable (the `%var` directive seems like a good step), but the simplicity of the implementation and the flexibility of the construction leads me to believe that this is the right way of providing injection capability.

So instead of calling `initialize_globals()` at global scope, you define `inject()` at global scope. That doesn't seem more simple or flexible.

And I don't understand how you would implement `cython()` using your approach.

That's a matter of import, isn't it? Compiling cython normally gives a module `tmp_cython_module` and with `cython` you basically do a `from tmp_cython_module import *`.

> That was exactly my question: how?

Logically the (very thin!) wrapper `cython` might be injected into the same global scope as inject is written in.

Alternatively, once "inject" has been defined, we could inject it:

```
sage.misc.cython.inject = inject #we don't need cython_c anymore
```
ready for use there. Or one could access the dictionary there via inject.func_globals (which wouldn't be so clean).

Admittedly, this is all not so much cleaner than what happens now. The central "cleaner" principle is that there is a way of capturing a "globals" dictionary: define a function there. That should be a portable principle (accessing func_globals directly is probably not strictly portable).

I don't think the python way is sacred, but since we're basing things on python, we should have good reasons every time we do deviate from it. And I'm not so sure that for injection we do have such a good reason.

One "python way" would be to define in, say, sage.misc.inject

```
def inject(...):
    raise RuntimeError("injecting code in an environment where injection isn't properly defined")
```

and then have the different interfaces/REPLs monkey patch an appropriate "inject" into sage.misc.inject.inject.

I'm not so sure how clean monkey patching is and how robust this is against `from sage.misc.inject import inject`, but at least it's an entirely python solution.

Sorry, I don't understand this sentence.

So everybody's Sage code should start with the boilerplate

```
sage.calculus.var.inject = inject
sage.calculus.function.inject = inject
sage.calculus.desolver.inject = inject
sage.misc.cython.inject = inject
sage.misc.fortran.inject = inject
```
Not an elegant solution. Of course you could say "let's define `inject` in just one place" and call it from there, which is essentially my proposal.

Just ran into this old ticket myself, looking at how we can work around `sage/calculus/var.pyx`:

```
    G = globals()  # this is the reason the code must be in Cython.
```
There is a way to write such code in python directly. Something like:

```
    G = sys._getframe(1).f_globals
```
should do the trick in most cases (if the caller's "globals" is a read-only dict itself, as a cython module "globals" would be, then one shouldn't be injecting variables in it anyway). I suspect that with `old_style_globals=False` the same line should work in cython code as well.

Cython doesn't generate a stack frame, so `sys._getframe(1).f_globals` is wrong, it should be `sys._getframe(0).f_globals`. But that's a complicated way to write the builtin `globals()`, so we might as well use that.

Indeed, using `old_style_globals` is basically equivalent to doing

```
from builtins import globals
```

This makes a difference because this overrides the Cython-specific `globals()`.
