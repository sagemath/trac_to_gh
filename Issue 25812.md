LGTM, except a few typos and pyflakes issues which I have corrected in the previous commit (the `mbox` was necessary to have the first term visible). If you agree with these changes, you may set `positive review`, as soon as the patchbot comes green.

Thank you. (I am a little surprised about that `\mbox` being necessary and dislike it because it will be there in the `?` doc, but I don't care that much.)

I was suprised, too. I also tried `\\[-5mm]` right behind `begin{...}`, which worked for the `pdf` but the `html` output looked a little bit ugly (`-5mm` being ignored, here).
