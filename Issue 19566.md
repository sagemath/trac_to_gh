sage: P_cdd = Polyhedra(ZZ, 3, 'cdd')
sage: P_ppl([[],[],[]], None)
The empty polyhedron in ZZ^3
sage: P_cdd([[],[],[]], None)
Traceback (most recent call last):

This might be related to #17339.

This is because the cdd backend does not have an `_init_empty_polyhedron` method. That should be an easy fix.

The problem in the description is that it tries to get the common length of elements in the v-representation while they are all `None`. This should be grabbed beforehand and initialize an empty polyhedron like we do in the other cases.

Changing keywords from "" to "empty polyhedron, cdd".
