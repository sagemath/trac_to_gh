This is because the cdd backend does not have an `_init_empty_polyhedron` method. That should be an easy fix.

The problem in the description is that it tries to get the common length of elements in the v-representation while they are all `None`. This should be grabbed beforehand and initialize an empty polyhedron like we do in the other cases.
