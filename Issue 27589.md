# Issue 27589: Deprecate __long__ for many classes

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27826

Original creator: jhpalmieri

Original creation time: 2019-05-13 20:08:27

CC:  embray chapoton

This is part of #27696. `long(...)` is not defined in Python 3, and so `__long__` methods should be deprecated. Notable classes which are not included: integers and rational numbers. This is mainly because those classes are used in so many places in the Sage library that deprecation warnings for them would get triggered many times during doctesting.

Are there really that many places where an integer/rational is explicitly converted to a `long`? That worries me. I really want to understand better why you're not applying this everywhere (needs_info for that reason).

About the patch itself:

1. in `src/sage/libs/mpmath/ext_main.pyx` you messed up the spacing of `"""`

2. I don't understand the comment `This is deprecated, but the ``TypeError`` takes precedence over the deprecation warning when this is run.` How does the error "take precedence" over the warning, what are you trying to say?

Regarding integer/rational: if I add deprecation warnings to those, I get over 800 files with failures. Many involve `set_random_seed` or other uses of randomization:

Easy to fix.

By "take precedence", I mean that no deprecation warning is printed, just the `TypeError`. I'm trying to explain why there is no doctest with a deprecation warning. That could be clearer.

The question is why do you get so many failures?

I would just remove that note, it's fine.

I would prefer to address that on another ticket: deal with the easy cases here (and also #27829) and then think about ZZ and QQ.

I haven't investigated at all, just saw that it was a mess and so I wanted to put it off. Does Python's `range` try to convert to `long` in Python 2? Or do some other Python built-ins do that?

-1

We clearly have no clue what we're doing or what the consequences are of that deprecation.

I have no idea what your objection is or what work you think needs doing on this ticket. Can you explain?


---

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2019-05-16 08:37:43

In some cases (for integers and rationals), deprecating `__long__` causes a large number of warnings. We don't know why there are so many warnings. So deprecating `__long__` seems to have unforeseen consequences. This is a sign that we should be prudent when deprecating `__long__`.

I would much prefer to deal with all cases of `__long__` together (this does not necessarily mean on one ticket, but it does mean understanding the consequences of deprecating all `__long__` methods).

We might also make a difference between plain Python classes and Cython cdef classes.


---

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2019-05-16 12:13:36

What's your plan for _external_ packages calling `long(...)`? For example, `fpylll` does this and I don't think it's wrong for them to do that.

This is especially true from the point of view of Cython and the Python/C API, where the `long` class in Python 2 is the same as the `int` class in Python 3 (you might think that Python 3 removed the `long` class but what really happened is they removed `int` and then renamed `long` -> `int`).

So I'm now leaning towards closing this ticket as "wontfix".


---

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2019-05-16 12:57:39

Also numpy uses `long` internally (in their C code at least).


---

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2019-05-16 15:14:18

As far as I can tell, `__long__` methods are not used in Python 3 (despite what you say about the renaming `long -> int`, `int(x)` does not call `x.__long__()`). Let me add a new goal to this, or rather make explicit a previously implicit goal: we want users to stop using the `long()` function, in order to ease the transition to Python 3. Deprecating `__long__` is a way to do this. Is there a better way to accomplish this?


---

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2019-05-16 15:25:58

I would point out that there are many calls to `long` in `sage.misc.randstate`, so fixing those will help with some of these issues.


---

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2019-05-16 15:28:35

Could we replace `long()` in the REPL by a custom `long()` which shows a deprecation warning and then calls the real `long()`?

But I don't agree that those calls are problematic. We really need a `long` there (or `int` in Python 3 terminology), so calling `long()` (which Cython understands as `int` on Python 3) seems the right thing to do.

Has this been tested on Python 3?  I fear it might have problems on Python 3, ironically, due to #24755 but I'm not sure.


---

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2019-05-31 17:04:58

Most of the new deprecation warnings are doctested with tests tagged `# py2`, so this shouldn't cause any issues with #24755. I believe as I was developing this, I was testing in parallel with both Python 2 and 3. I'm double-checking now...


---

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2019-05-31 18:31:46

I've just run doctests with Python 3, and I don't see any new failures coming from this ticket. `make ptest-python3` passes, and running tests on the other files changed here doesn't reveal any new problems.
