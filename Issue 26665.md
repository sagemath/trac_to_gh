# Issue 26665: convert all of Sage library code to libgap

Issue created by migration from Trac.

It's about time. The sooner this is done, the fewer code to cross pexpect gap/libgap boundary will have to be written.
Some concrete tickets aiming at this:

* #26750
* #26889
* ...

Retarging tickets optimistically to the next milestone.  If you are responsible for this ticket (either its reporter or owner) and don't believe you are likely to complete this ticket before the next release (8.7) please retarget this ticket's milestone to sage-pending or sage-wishlist.

I've created a follow up ticket #27234 to #26750, since by the improvements in connection with GAP 4.10 upgrade, the implementation of the `gap` method of class `PermutationGroupElement` can be done properly, right now.

Ticket retargeted after milestone closed (if you don't believe this ticket is appropriate for the Sage 8.8 release please retarget manually)

As the Sage-8.8 release milestone is pending, we should delete the sage-8.8 milestone for tickets that are not actively being worked on or that still require significant work to move forward.  If you feel that this ticket should be included in the next Sage release at the soonest please set its milestone to the next release milestone (sage-8.9).

Changing keywords from "" to "gap libgap".

Changing component from group theory to interfaces.

see #25477 for a long discussion on performance of GAP vs Cython.
Here is the current (Sage 9.8.beta3) list of modules using pexpect GAP, i.e.
`sage.interfaces.gap`

```
src/sage/coding/binary_code.pyx:                    from sage.interfaces.gap import gap
src/sage/coding/linear_code.py:from sage.interfaces.gap import gap

src/sage/combinat/matrices/latin.py:from sage.interfaces.gap import GapElement

src/sage/combinat/root_system/weyl_group.py:from sage.interfaces.gap import gap
src/sage/groups/class_function.py:from sage.interfaces.gap import gap
src/sage/groups/perm_gps/constructor.py:from sage.interfaces.gap import GapElement
src/sage/groups/perm_gps/cubegroup.py:from sage.interfaces.gap import gap
src/sage/groups/perm_gps/permgroup.py:from sage.interfaces.gap import GapElement
src/sage/groups/perm_gps/permgroup_element.pyx:            from sage.interfaces.gap import gap
src/sage/interfaces/gap3.py:from sage.interfaces.gap import Gap_generic, GapElement_generic
src/sage/libs/gap/element.pyx:        from sage.interfaces.gap import gap
src/sage/misc/randstate.pyx:            from sage.interfaces.gap import gap
src/sage/modular/arithgroup/arithgroup_perm.py:        from sage.interfaces.gap import gap
src/sage/rings/finite_rings/element_givaro.pyx:            from sage.interfaces.gap import gfq_gap_to_sage
src/sage/rings/finite_rings/element_ntl_gf2e.pyx:from sage.interfaces.gap import is_GapElement
src/sage/rings/finite_rings/element_pari_ffelt.pyx:from sage.interfaces.gap import is_GapElement
src/sage/rings/finite_rings/integer_mod_ring.py:                from sage.interfaces.gap import intmod_gap_to_sage
src/sage/topology/simplicial_complex.py:        from sage.interfaces.gap import g
```

In particular, even `libgap` is using `sage.interfaces.gap` - for GAP help system.
