# Issue 17713: make modular_decomposition an optional spkg

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/17950

Original creator: ncohen

Original creation time: 2015-03-13 19:54:44

CC:  dcoudert jdemeyer

The code on which Sage relies to compute modular decompositions has been displaying a stopgap for a while. It seems that the problem has been fixed with an update, but it seems to be architecture-dependent (see #13744).

This branch puts some distance between Sage and this code: its source code had been copy/pasted into Sage's source code (I did that), and this is far from being clean. Thus, we turn this into an optional spkg.

An interesting consequence of this move is that we will (at least) be able to use the updated version of the code on platforms for which it work. It will also make it easier to install and test on other architectures. It also means that we stop shipping in our own source code a program which has proved to be unreliable at times.

> What should I do to compile it?

My mistake. There is something I forgot to do, and unless I do it one cannot compile Sage without installing the new package. I just added a commit.

With this commit, should compile correctly. You will *not* be able to call `.modular_decomposition` as it should ask you to install a package first.

In order to install the package, copy the .tar.bz2 file (whose link appears in this ticket's description) into your upstream/ folder. Then, you will be able to run `sage -i modular_decomposition` and everything should be alright.

That's apparently not enough.

and at the end of the `Sage_crash_report.txt` we have:

True. This bug does not happen on my computer as `modular_decomposition` is installed. I just fixed it.

As I told you, we are making progress! I can now compile, start sage, pass all tests, etc. without installing the spkg.

In the online doc of the `modular_decomposition` method. After `Note: In order to use this method you must install the "modular_decomposition" optional package.`  you could add a `see blah blah blah`.

I'm now trying to install the spkg. I'm able to compile but:

```
sage: G = graphs.PetersenGraph()
sage: G.modular_decomposition()
/Users/dcoudert/sage/src/bin/sage-ipython:1:

Hello,

> In the online doc of the `modular_decomposition` method. After `Note: In order to use this method you must install the "modular_decomposition" optional package.`  you could add a `see blah blah blah`.

Done.

> I'm now trying to install the spkg. I'm able to compile but:

I cannot reproduce this bug with your commands. Is it deterministic on your computer ?

This may be related to the reports from #13744. The original code itself seems to have problems, and my repeated reports changed nothing. This is part of the reason why I am trying to move this code away from Sage. Are you using a Mac computer ?

Yes I'm using a mac.

I can reproduce the bug, but it's kind of random. Sometimes its working, sometimes not.

Well.. On my computer your loop with 1000 random graphs ends without any problem.


---

Comment by dcoudert created at 2015-03-14 18:38:49

With the loop, some times it crashes after 3 graphs, 600, or never. This is really random segfault.


---

Comment by dcoudert created at 2015-03-14 18:42:13

Also, have you seen that I don't always have the same answer on the Petersen?


---

Comment by ncohen created at 2015-03-14 19:38:38

It is very likely that this segfault comes from the code itself. Do you think that this should stop us from turning it into a module ?

What we currently ship in Sage returns wrong results, and this new version of the code fixes it. Though we have segfaults. Could you try to run this code with the old version of Sage, see if it works ?

I could build a package with the old version of the code, if it does not segfault. It would still return wrong results, though.

> Also, have you seen that I don't always have the same answer on the Petersen?

Yesyes. I cannot reproduce that on my computer either, but it was apparently reported in #13744.

Nathann

Comment by dcoudert created at 2015-03-14 21:59:27

I don't have problems with the previous version (branch develop): no segfault with the long loop.
I don't know what is the best to do.

I changed the branch and the package's name (please remove the previous one from your copy of Sage). It ships the .c files that are currently contained in Sage (and return wrong results too). You should not experience anything that does not already happen, however.

Nathann

Comment by dcoudert created at 2015-03-15 16:12:07

Well, now I have directly a segfault :(

What's the difference between the two versions ?


---

Comment by ncohen created at 2015-03-15 16:13:50

> What's the difference between the two versions ?

I had one at some point. Now that you have installed the package I just built, could you 'touch' `modular_decomposition.pyx` and run `sage -b` ?

Nathann

Comment by dcoudert created at 2015-03-15 16:37:45

It's apparently working: no segfault with the big for loop.

Should we consider it is better like that?

David.


---

Comment by ncohen created at 2015-03-15 17:35:30

Well technically it is better, as the code is a bit further from Sage's source code, as it should have been from the beginning. Plus it is optional. Plus those .c files have never been reviewed anyway, and they are in french `:-P`

And it will make it easier to test for bugs later, as we will only have to install the new files. And I hope that this will get solved someday `T_T`

Changing status from needs_review to positive_review.


---

Comment by dcoudert created at 2015-03-15 17:45:26

Since the patch is working and improves upon previous situation, I set it to positive review.

About the c code, Guillaume Ducoffe has a c++/boost implementation. It could be an interesting alternative to the current c code which is apparently no longer maintained by its author. But I don't know if we can use boost (portability).

David.

Yo !

> About the c code, Guillaume Ducoffe has a c++/boost implementation. 

Does it compute modular decompositions of graphs?

This ticket modified the unrelated `build/pkgs/latte_int/checksums.ini`, see #18139. Now i know why `git commit -a` is a bad workflow :P

Sorryyyy.. I have no idea how that happened, however `O_o`

should this be reimplemented from scratch, in cython? Unless there is correct external code somewhere that we can use?

The original code that we use is no longer maintained. Guillaume Ducoffe has not finalized his code in c++/boost yet. So I'm not aware of external code in c that can be used. 
We can find implementations in java
http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~mtedder/ or in perl https://metacpan.org/release/Graph-ModularDecomposition.
So it is certainly better to reimplement it with sufficient comments to maintain it.

The perl implementation is for digraphs, so that's a different story all together.
(we probably can interface perl with Sage, although it's probably a bit too much trouble).

If we are to reimplement the modular decomposition in cython, we should certainly finish first the implementation of `LexBFS` #11736
