With this ticket, I get the following error:


```
sage: a = acos(float(1/4) * sqrt(int(5)))
sage: CBF(a)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
AttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)
...
AttributeError: 'float' object has no attribute 'parent'
```

one already gets this error from `CBF(float(0.25)*sqrt(int(5)))`
