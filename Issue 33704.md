CC:  @davewittemorris slelievre

Finite fields have `.fetch_int()` to decode integers into finite-field elements by reinterpreting the base-`p` representation as a polynomial:

```sage
sage: F.<t> = GF(7^10)
sage: el = F.fetch_int(2424); el
t^4 + 3*t + 2
```


However, the inverse operation is a bit cumbersome:

```sage
sage: el.polynomial().change_ring(ZZ)(el.parent().characteristic())
2424
```


In this patch, we add an inverse to `.fetch_int()`, named `.to_integer()` in resemblance with the Python method `int.to_bytes()`. Also, some code cleanup and optimization while we're at it.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/33941

I just found out that #31605 already tracks this issue and that binary finite fields have `.integer_representation()`.

This leaves us with three options for naming these methods:
1. `.fetch_int()` / `.integer_representation()`    [backwards compatible]
2. `.from_integer()` / `.integer_representation()` [one deprecation]
3. `.from_integer()` / `.to_integer()`             [two deprecations]

Personally I'm still in favor of (3) because the others lack symmetry. Opinions?

The only reason I would see not to would be consistency
with other software.

Do Magma, Maple, Mathematica have similar functions,
and if so how they are named?

I could not find one for Magma and Maple. Mathematica has `ToElementCode` and `FromElementCode`

I think Sage is the leading software in this regard. No worry for consistency.

One more thing. I think the hyphen in `finite-field element` is legitimate but not really necessary. The hyphen is there to mean "(finite field) element" not "finite (field element)". But sage is mathematics software and there is zero risk that one reads it as "finite (field element)". "finite field", "elliptic curve", "cyclic group", etc are all mathematical terms, and rarely written in two forms (hyphened and not hyphened). For consistency, let us stick to one form.
