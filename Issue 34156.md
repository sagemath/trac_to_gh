I would actually go one step further and make it explicitly an ``@`abstract_method` like `Sets().CartesianProducts()` does with `cartesian_factors()`. Then you could implement

```python
def construction(self):
   return (TensorProductFunctor(self.category()), self.tensor_factors())

again following `Sets().CartesianProducts()`.

I think by putting a `try`-`except` block around it with a deprecation message (which nothing is being deprecated), you are increasing Sage's technical debt for people who are doing something fairly advanced and likely should know better than to do this.

No, they are not, as a deprecation (in software) means something that is going to be removed. They simply need to be patched.

Yes, and that "something" is the support for such user-defined implementation classes.

Fine. The nomenclature isn't a hill I am willing to die on.

However, I still am not completely convinced not breaking backwards compatibility is worth the technical debt in this case. (I originally wanted to use the pun "we should bend over backwards for backwards compatibility" but that is just a bit too dramatic.) Since the solution here is relatively simple, I can let it pass.

Side note: comment:22 is not a solution for ``@`abstract_method(optional=True)` simply becomes a `NotImplemented`:

"Technical debt" is a big scary word. But no, doing proper deprecation does not add to the debt.

No, we shouldn't, at least without also removing `TensorProducts()` from its category (thereby completely stripping the fact it knows and carries a tensor product of `R`-modules structure).

The problem is exactly what the test is failing for: The construction is not giving the parent back.
