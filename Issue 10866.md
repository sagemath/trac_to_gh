Keywords: riemann map complex plot

The Riemann mapping stuff is a great addition - excellent work!  

But there are lots of minor problems that should be fixed.

* Awkward phrasing:

```
    Note that all the methods are numeric rather than analytic, for unusual
    regions or insufficient collocation points may give very inaccurate
    results.
```

   This is hard to follow, though I see what it says.
* There is also a 'reimann' several times, and a 'correspondance'.
* A lot of the code is redundant with `plot/complex_plot.pyx`.   This should be factored out somehow, or imported, or whatever, unless it would lead to gross slowdowns.
   * Is there anything different about `complex_to_rgb` except that it's cdef'd (and the changes needed for that, including some efficiencies like the phase command)?  
   * Similarly, the `ColorPlot` class is apparently identical to the `ComplexPlot` class, except that it's better documented, uses only the default interpolation, and won't take options.  
   * Note that the documentation for `ColorPlot` only uses `complex_plot`!!!   I view this as an error by mvngu and wdj in reviewing #6648, though that was a long review process so it's easy to see how it slipped through.

Regarding the documentation, thanks for pointing that out. I'll get on it. Since I'm working on this as a senior project, I appreciate any documentation/setup feedback since I can stick that under the category of "usability testing".

I've separated the analytic tests under #10857. I'll get to work on that soon.

With regards to the plotting, I plan to do some reworking of that whole area. I'm going to add options for parallelization of the grid computation. I also intend to make the display function modular so that different "color schemes" can be used. For example I want the interested user to be able to specify the bright/dark ranges. I also want to add an error plot that shows estimates of the numerical error. 

Now the reason I made my "clone" of complex_plot in the first place was to minimize the function call overhead by keeping it all in-house where I can take advantage of the cdef. However some of the work I want to do could be pretty general, thus it might be worth it to put it somewhere in the plot package. 

Thoughts?

Description updated.

I'm not the Cython expert.  But if you cc: Jason and Robert Bradshaw, you should get some good help :)  I don't see why one couldn't cimport the complex plot, after all.  Maybe not?  Modularity is good, I don't think people will be plotting so very many of these as to worry about the millisecond it takes to import.
