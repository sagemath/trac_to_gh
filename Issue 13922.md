Posets appear to have no mechanism to count the number of linear extensions other than computing all the linear extensions and finding the length of that list. Using recursion, one can count the number of linear extensions without having to generate all the linear extensions.

I've moved the code to `sage.categories.finite_poset`, which I realise is not what you've said, and added a note in the docstring saying one may prefer to count linear extensions of `P` by using `P.linear_extensions().cardinality()`, which uses the iterator belonging to `LinearExtensionsOfPoset` and avoids all the cacheing.

Fair point. `cardinality()` doesn't seem to live in `sage.combinat.posets.linear_extensions`, though. It looks like it comes from the `FiniteEnumeratedSets` category. Is it legitimate to give `LinearExtensionsOfPoset` a cardinality function with an argument to choose between the `_cardinality_from_iterator` from `FiniteEnumeratedSets` and counting recursively? My understanding of how categories are meant to work does not extend this far.

My understanding of categories is that when they prevent you from doing something you need then categories should be changed to allow you to do whatever you wanted to do in the first place.

Technically I do not think that categories would mind an optional argument to .cardinality. I guess that they would not notice it, so that's all good.

To be precise, for an object in FiniteEnumeratedSets, cardinality is
set by default to _cardinality_from_iterator. So it indeed goes
through all linear extensions. However the counting is done along the
way, without storing them. So the memory complexity is roughly
constant (well, linear in the size of one linear extension).

Certainly: in any object oriented system, abstract classes are here to
provide you with default implementations. By design they are meant to
be overridden whenever there is a better algorithm in a special case
and the application in mind makes it worth it to implement that
algorithm

Categories are nothing but a way to organize those abstract classes.

What is it?

If there are several ways to do this, none of which is best from all sides, shouldn't we then have `algorithm`-keyword for the function? And in any version I guess that the poset should first be splitted to connected parts.

Is there something wrong with making a function with dumb implementation first? Then we would have a reference implementation, docstring and already thinked interface and place for the function.

Well, counting linear extensions is #P-problem, I think. Of course it's complexity can still be `O(1.001^n)`...

But I will wait and see. At least my quick and dirty implementation gives a way to check the results of better code.

The `#P` result you keep citing only applies to generating a list all linear extensions, not counting them. For example, I can tell you that the number of linear extensions of an antichain of size n is n!, independent of any complexity issues that arise when trying to generate all n! permutations.

The algorithm is used in Stembridge's Posets package. The general idea is that linear extensions are maximal chains in the lattice of order ideals.

If you want to enumerate (not generate) maximal chains, then you can use fact that if f(x) is the number of saturated chains from a minimal element to x, then f(y) = sum f(x) over all x covered by y.

If we wanted to keep the code simple, we could just create the lattice of order ideals `J(P)` using Sage. But then the elements of this poset would be subsets, and we'd have another (potentially expensive) computation to make the Hasse diagram and get a naturally labelled poset on `0...(|I|-1)` (where `|I|` is the number of order ideals). I think I tried this implementation in the past, and it was still an order of magnitude or two slower than the corresponding Maple code.

However, there should be some wizardry that lets us quickly create a dictionary on `0 .. (|I|-1)` corresponding to the up edges in `J(P)`. That wizardry is what I'm trying to figure out.

This algorithm works whether or not P is connected. However, there would be some significant speed-up for posets with a large number of connected components if we just counted the number of linear extensions on each connected component, and combined the results appropriately (if f(P) is the number of linear extensions on P, and P=P_1 U ...

For example, say we look at the anti-chain of 11 elements. Currently, we have to iterate over close to 40 million permutations.

After much staring at Maple code, I now mostly understand the algorithm to generate a naturally labelled poset isomorphic to the order ideal lattice given a naturally labelled poset. 

The idea is similar to what you mentioned. Run a loop that takes the lattice of order ideals for P restricted to `{1,...,k}`, and think about what happens when you add `k+1`. You need to know which order ideal `I_{k+1}` corresponds to the principal order ideal generated by `k+1` (but with `k+1` removed, since we haven't added it to the poset yet). 

Now, you create a list `K` of the order ideals that lie above `I_{k+1}` in your partial lattice of order ideals. Each of these is going to yield a new order ideal to add to your list (the corresponding ideal `I` plus the new `k+1`). Make sure that `K` is ordered so that our lattice of order ideals stayed naturally labelled. The relations you need to add are `I` is covered by `I` plus `k+1`, and for every relation `A` covers `B` in `K`, you're going to have to add `A` plus `k+1` covers `B` plus `k+1`.

The main subtlety is in creating and maintaining a helper list that will eventually tell you where `I_{k+1}` is by the time you reach the `k+1`st step. Call the list `L`, indexed by your poset elements, initialize it with all 1s. As you go along, after `k` iterations, the entry `L[j]` tells you which order ideal corresponds to `I_j` restricted to `1...k`. If you add something incomparable to `j`, then `I_j` restricted to `1...k+1` doesn't change. If you add something comparable to `j`, then `I_j` restricted to `1...k+1` is one of the things in `K` plus `k+1`. So if we started with `N` order ideals, and `I_j` restricted to `1...k` was the `r`th thing in `K`, then `I_j` restricted to `1...k+1` will be the `N+r`th thing, and we update `L` accordingly.


Since it might take me some time to actually sit down and implement this, I agree that it makes sense to just change the `P.linear_extensions().cardinality()` method to something simple like `P.order_ideals_lattice().chain_polynomial().leading_coefficient()` (maybe with an optional parameter allowing one to default back to the iterator). Then I can work on a separate ticket for generating a naturally labelled poset isomorphic to the order ideal lattice, which `P.linear_extensions().cardinality()` could eventually utilize.

Or at least it sounds funny to have `as_ideal` with possible values `True`, `False` and `'integers'`.

Yes. It probably makes sense to deprecate `as_ideals`, and change it to a keyword like `representative` that defaults to `ideal`, but can also be `antichains` or `integers`.

I guess I'd want to quantify how much overhead calculating connected components and a series-parallel decomposition of the original Hasse diagram introduces (my guess is a little and lot, respectively) before making it part of every single computation. I feel like unless you explicitly construct something as an ordinal/disjoint sum of smaller posets (and thus should already know the decomposition), almost every poset you'd throw at this where you'd really need optimal performance is going to be connected and not have a series-parallel decomposition.

That could be done now; a little less time for new users to learn a feature to be deprecated.

True, but then whole decomposition will be just one check to see that the poset can not be decomposed.

And in any case that should a place for it's own ticket.
