I skipped the two longest tests in the `TestSuite` since they require a significant iteration over the crystal.

```
sage: %time TestSuite(YLa).run(skip=["_test_enumerated_set_contains","_test_stembridge_local_axioms"])
CPU times: user 2.26 s, sys: 0.01 s, total: 2.27 s
Wall time: 2.53 s
```

Hi Travis,

Thanks for figuring this out. But why is this a new ticket and not a fix to http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/14454 ?

Because #14454 is already closed, I thought a new ticket was the proper procedure.

The new test should still be marked `# long time` if it takes more than 1 second (on `sage.math`)

Kept it as `# long time`.
