I plan to do this, but since it's only for 4.6.1, it can wait for now...

Changing keywords from "" to "pari spkg".

For reference. I switched to pari-2.4.3 for sage-4.6_rc0 and over in sage-on-gentoo
and it doesn't break any tests or anything.

Builds and run OK, long tests passes on at least linux x86 and amd64.
Patch looks good. I am giving this a positive review.
