There probably is something I don't understand, but I don't see why when the node is a leaf, the algorithm for `self._count_and_skip()` returns `implicit` just like if it stopped on an edge. For example, 


```
sage: T = ImplicitSuffixTree(Word("cacao"))
sage: T._count_and_skip(3,(2,5))
('implicit', (3, 1), 3)
```


It's coherent with the condition in the code `if (trans[0][1] != None [...]):`, but I don't see how it is coherent with the documentation.

Your last observation was in fact a mistake, it was introduced when I derecursify the `_count_and_skip` method.

The patchbot does not pass the pyflakes test but the error mentioned is completely unrelated to the changes that were made. Moreover, as far as I can tell, the error reported is not a real error since the if statement on line 123-125 won't be entered on the first pass of the loop when `old_s` is still undefined. Hence, I don't think any change to the code is needed.

Is there any way to silence the error?
