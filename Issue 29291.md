If this error occurs when running the tests, it is usually persistent and reproducible, but isolating the problem is difficult, as the corresponding doctest does not fail when run standalone.

See #25993 for more details.

see also #30745 where this raises again, with Flint 2.6.3. 

But interestingly with #25993 (with these tests reinstated) everything works.
