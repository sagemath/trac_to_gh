# Issue 29291: Singular: segmentation fault in plural.pyx

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29528

Original creator: @mwageringel

Original creation time: 2020-04-18 17:19:42

Keywords: singular, libsingular

This ticket tracks a random segmentation fault in `plural.pyx` that occasionally appears with Singular ≥ 4.1.1p3. The corresponding doctest is disabled in #25993.

If this error occurs when running the tests, it is usually persistent and reproducible, but isolating the problem is difficult, as the corresponding doctest does not fail when run standalone.

See #25993 for more details.

#13447 might solve this.

Thanks for the report. This confirms that this problem also occurs with Singular 4.1.1p2 – the version currently in Sage.

see also #30745 where this raises again, with Flint 2.6.3. 

But interestingly with #25993 (with these tests reinstated) everything works.

Moving to 9.4, as 9.3 has been released.
