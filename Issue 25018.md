This is at the moment a ticket for a nonexisting defect, as no standard package uses C++17 code at the moment.

The compiler situation is that C++17 is fully supported by `clang-4 --std=c++17` and `gcc-7 --std=c++17`. So, compiler-wise Sage could support it without raising requirements (currently at gcc-4.8) by building gcc if system has gcc<7. But for full support `libstdc++-gcc7` or `libc++-4` is needed too, so `gcc-7` would be the system requirement.

How much is gcc-7 already in the wild?

I have an implementation of commutative matching (needed to fix #25168) in the works that depends on `std::optional`. This ticket is useful to define the amount of changes needed for it, and for reference. Even if we won't fix #25168 in the near future I'm playing with a project that needs the matching algorithm too, and which I'll release in an experimental branch.
