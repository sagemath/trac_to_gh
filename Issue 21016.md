# Issue 21016: LatticePoset: is_complemented() with certificate

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/21253

Original creator: jmantysalo

Original creation time: 2016-08-15 12:48:58

This patch will add a `certificate`-option to `is_complemented()`; compare to `is_sectionally_complemented()` and `is_relatively_complemented()`.

At the same time this drops computation time. As an example after meets and joins are computed for `TamariLattice(7)` it took 140 ms to check that it is complemented; with this patch it is about 85 ms. It is also faster when filtering complemented lattices from all 10-element lattices.

Looks good. I have just made a pep8 reviewer's commit. You can set to positive review if you agree with my cosmetic changes.
