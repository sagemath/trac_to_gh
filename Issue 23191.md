# Issue 23191: Jupyter doesn't start browser on OSX 10.12.5

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/23428

Original creator: vbraun

Original creation time: 2017-07-13 21:19:52

The latest and greatest OSX has some Applescript braindamage that prevents it from opening a browser. Workaround is 

```
export BROWSER=open
```

I'd rather respect the value of `BROWSER` if it is set, and also add a little documentation:

This does fix the problem for me (which I've had for a while), by the way. If you approve my changes, I can change the branch if you want and then set it to positive review.

Nice fast work!  Does Jeroen's SagenbExport and Sagenb work normally with this as well?  Sorry I can't test this as I don't have 10.12.

Yes and yes.
