# Issue 18837: Conjugate Gradient method for solving modular sparse matrices

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/19074

Original creator: kartikv

Original creation time: 2015-08-23 04:08:24

Keywords: sparse, matrix

Implementation of vanilla conjugate gradient method for solving sparse matrices mod N. Should be faster than built-in methods for matrices that are highly sparse. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_gradient_method for details.
