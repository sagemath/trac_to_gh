When installing Sage with `SAGE_PYTHON3=yes`, the program `python` points to `python2`. This causes build-time problems like

Seems like python2 takes it upon itself to overwrite the symlink even when there is already one. So this is a race between python2 and python3 build, which is why I can't reproduce it.

Btw in #22582 I'm explictly using pip2 or pip3 to install dependencies instead of trusting some python/pip symlink. That way you can event install both py2/py3 versions of dependencies simultaneously, which is imho useful for testing and debugging.

Ops, I got confused with the local/lib/python symlink, ignore comment:5. 

PEP394 says that "for the time being, all distributions should ensure that python refers to the same target as python2".

Volker was very insistent at #22582 that `python` should always be `python2`, because that is a Python convention. So whether this has to do with the python3 build, there will be resistance to changing it. Perhaps this ticket should be closed, or perhaps it should be repurposed to using `sage-python23` in more places in the build process to call a version of Python depending on the setting of `SAGE_PYTHON3`.
