I just was adding myself on a bunch of tickets I might have time to look at over spring break.  If you are ready now, you should review it - I won't have time immediately.   Of course, make sure it applies and that the new built doc looks okay (`./sage -b; ./sage -docbuild reference html`) if this file is in the reference.
