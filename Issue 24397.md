I think this should be added to `isgci.py` too; compare to #24113.

OK.

(But someday we should check when to use `if not (self.has_loops() or self.has_multiple_edges())` and when `_scream_if_not_simple`.)

Is the proposed method (and definition) valid for both graphs and digraphs ?
If not, it must be moved to graph.py (we should do the same for other methods).

Concerning the faster 3-vertex-connectivity test, I fully agree. It is in the list of projects for the GSoC application.

Thank you jmantysalo and dcoudert! I didn't want to use `_scream_if_not_simple`, because I think it is actually better to return `False` in this case.

I have now moved the code to graph.py; it really doesn't make to much sense for digraphs. 
Also I opened  ticket:24648 to move some more functions.

The ticket for the faster 3-vertex-connectivity test is here: ticket:24635. (I hope it is not a duplicate; can I find the list of the GSoC application somewhere?)

In `isgci.py`, could you also complete the section `Predefined classes` (around line 200 in the file).
Thanks.

done! I hope I didn't foget anything else in isgci.py; I don't quite understand how it works..

You added link to `GenericGraph` but it is in `Graph` ;)
