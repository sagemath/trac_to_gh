Could you test https://github.com/fplll/fplll/pull/246 on the machine in question to see if it fixes the issue?

From the same 32bit VM, but outside Sage tree (hence using Debian compilation tools, not the ones provided by Sage), i pulled the master branch, and could reproduce the test error for `test_pruner`. Then by applying the pull request 246, the tests pass.

So i guess it will fix the issue when integrated into Sage.

If this isn't in a release, then IMO we should patch Sage until it is.

I was hesitating to do that, since i do not know when will be the next fplll release. Martin, do you have any idea on the next release schedule ? It could be nive to have the fix ready for 8.0.

Hi, I'm not to keen to cut a new release right now because we just merged a major new feature. I'd like to see it mature for a while. Also, we'll have a big development meeting in July and I expect to cut a new release a few weeks after. However, if you really, really, really want a release, I could make that happen. Let me know.

Well, this was more by laziness, a new release let us remove two existing patches instead of having to write a new one. However, this should not hurt your workflow, so let us make a patch.

I had to rename `tests-long-double.patch` to make explicit that both patches touch the same file and that they have to be applied in that order.

It works well on  my 64bit laptop. I still have to test it on my 32bit VM, i have no time right now.

OK, the current set of patches works on my 32bit machine as well:
