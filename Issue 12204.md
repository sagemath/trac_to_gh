It is natural to understand complement on BipartiteGraph object in the bipartite context, i.e. excluding possible edges between vertices in the same partition. Currently there is no such implementation in the BipartiteGraph object and call falls back to the GenericGraph implementation.

Hmmm.... I am sorry but these things are really dangerous... `:-/`

What would happen if one of the functions BipartiteGraph inherits has to compute the complement of the graph at some point ? The result would not be the one intended.... `:-/`

I think that the correct behaviour there would be to throw an exception whenever the Bipartite graph contains two vertices in the same partition (=> the result is not bipartite, or does not respect the bipartition stored), and to define a complement_bipartite() method. Actually bipartite_complement would be better, but it would be easier to find if named bipartite_complement.

Travis, can you comment this?

If I make a special case for `BipartiteGraph`, it will break if there will be another subclass of `Graph`. So I should just check for `isinstance(g, sage.graphs.digraph.DiGraph)` and `isinstance(g, sage.graphs.graph.Graph)` and then make a copy like `Graph(self)`. However the docstring for that says "Please use this method only if you need to copy but change the underlying implementation or weightedness.  Otherwise simply do `copy(g)` - -".

So what is the right thing to do?

But this will not help if there will be another subclass of generic graphs. Anyways, this corrects this particular problem for now.
