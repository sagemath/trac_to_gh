No, this has nothing to do with parallel. The parallel testing should be fixed now.

The parallel testing problem with #12415 on OS X was due to `Pdb()` importing `readline`. Importing readline hangs (probably because more than one process tries to take control over the terminal somehow). The solution is simply not starting `Pdb` if not needed.
