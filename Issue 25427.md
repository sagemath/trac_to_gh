#25472 introduces a non-ascii character, that beacks the docbuild on my 32bit VM:


```
[dochtml]   File "/opt/sagemath/sage-8.2/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/databases/findstat.py", line 77
[dochtml] SyntaxError: Non-ASCII character '\xc3' in file /opt/sagemath/sage-8.2/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/databases/findstat.py on line 78, but no encoding declared; see http://python.org/dev/peps/pep-0263/ for details
```

Thanks. I wasn't able to build 8.3.beta7 on my patchbot because of this.
