Hi Quentin,

1. there is no need to mention the first argument ```s``` in the `INPUT` section. Moreover, as you can see this argument is often denoted `self` in other methods. That way it is clear that it is not really an argument.

2. In the verbose output

```
The number of points must be k^2 + k + 1 =6, got 7
```

  it would be better to also have a space after the k^2 + k + 1, in other words

```
The number of points must be k^2 + k + 1 = 6, got 7
```


3. Why did you indent your comments (i.e. the lines starting with `#`)? If you look at other methods like `__contains__` or `degree` you will see that there is no indentation.

4. I think you would better move your method down in the file. At least below the comment at line 1279

```
    #####################
    # real computations #
    #####################
```

  As you can see, the file `incidence_structures.py` is rather long and it is important to keep it organized as much as possible.

5. It would be nice to add an example with labels which are not integers

```
    sage: B = ['abc', 'adf', 'age', 'bde', 'bgf', 'cgd', 'cef']
    sage: IncidenceStructure(B).is_projective_plane()
    True
    sage: B[-1] = 'cgf'
    sage: B[-2] = 'ced'
    sage: IncidenceStructure(B).is_projective_plane(verbose=True)
    More than one line through d and e
    False
```

  that way you test that your error message explicitely mentions the points (and not their internal indices).

6. I am not exactly sure but it might be that the method `is_t_design` already implements this. The parameters would be `v=k^2+k+1`, `t=2` and `lambda=1`.

Might be useful to have an alias directly on incidence structures. Though, not essential.

This is one is pretty unrelated

This one is useful but not complete (since it does not check for the existence of quadrilateral). Moreover, I found out that there is a wrong reference `sage.combinat.designs.designs_pyx.is_group_divisible_design` mentions `sage.combinat.designs.incidence_structures.GroupDivisibleDesign` which does not exists (it is `sage.combinat.designs.group_divisible_designs.GroupDivisibleDesign`).

this is automatic if you specify that the number of points and blocks is `v=k^2+k+1` where each block has cardinality `k+1`. The method is convenient because it avoids to input the parameters.

Could you precise what you think:
- there is no need for `is_projective_plane`
- `is_projective_plane` should call the existing `is_group_divisible_design`
- `is_projective_plane` would be better as a function in `designs_pyx.pyx`

What I see in this branch is mostly error messages, which have already been implemented in `is_pairwise_balanced_design`. Similarly, you check that every pair of vertices appears once, and this is already done in `is_pairwise_balanced_design`. In both cases, I do not see any reason to have them twice, especially when the second is faster.

If all this function does is call `is_pairwise_balanced_design`, then it can stay in a `.py` file, as it will not compute much.
