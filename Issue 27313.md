Method for comparing equality by simply checking if two elements have the same structure/description (compared to the possibly expensive invoking of exactify)

I don't understand your logic here. If you want cheaper equality tests, just implement shortcuts in the methods `__bool__` and `_richcmp_`. See for example the usage of `cmp_elements_with_same_minpoly` which also avoids exactification. If you have something else in mind than providing shortcus for equality, then I would like to understand what and why. And in this case much more refactoring is needed.

Tickets still needing working or clarification should be moved to the next release milestone at the soonest (please feel free to revert if you think the ticket is close to being resolved).

It makes sense to me that one wants to have a quick equality check that is guaranteed to be fast at the price of sometimes returning false negatives. I don't see how you could implement that just by adding shortcuts to the existing tests.
