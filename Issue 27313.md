I don't understand your logic here. If you want cheaper equality tests, just implement shortcuts in the methods `__bool__` and `_richcmp_`. See for example the usage of `cmp_elements_with_same_minpoly` which also avoids exactification. If you have something else in mind than providing shortcus for equality, then I would like to understand what and why. And in this case much more refactoring is needed.
