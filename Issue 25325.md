CC:  @fchapoton @tscrim

For dimension 1 check if the poset is chain; for dimension 2 check if the incomparability graph is a comparability graph for some other poset. Only then proceed to use MILP and hypergraphs.

Remove internal check from the function, add a randomized check to `tests/*`.

Do at least series-parallel decomposition first, compute by parts.

For lattices run `irreducibles_poset()` first.

To doc add a mention about this being NP-complete.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/25562

I forgot timings. I tested with `PP = list(Posets(7))` and before the patch it took about 17 seconds to run `sum(P.dimension() for P in PP)`. After the patch it dropped below 4 seconds.

Hi Jori,

I tried your patch, it looks good.  I have a few very minor and trivial documentation suggestions, reproduced below, use them as you see fit.

Good points. I used all of them, except one that is quite slow. Btw, there is ready-made posets.StandardExample available.
