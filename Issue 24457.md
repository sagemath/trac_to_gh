`configure.ac` makes sure not to install GCC when the GCC Sage package is already installed. The same should be done for gfortran: it should not be installed when the GCC Sage package is already installed.

Something like this branch then. Do we need to provide a new configure tarball?

In the ticket description I wrote `test x$SAGE_INSTALL_GCC = xexists` and I meant exactly what I wrote.

Both are needed, I am not fussy about doing it in a cascade rather than a "or" clause.

OK, please do the following: *carefully* read what you wrote and what I proposed in the ticket description. It's not the same.
