We have:


```
sage: ZZ()
0
sage: CC()
0.000000000000000
sage: RR()
0.000000000000000
sage: RIF()
0
sage: CIF()

sage: RBF()
0
sage: CBF()
0
sage: RDF()
0.0
sage: CDF()
TypeError: __call__() takes at least 1 positional argument (0 given)
```


Most real field implementations rely on `Parent.__call__` while complex ones have to define their own `__call__` method in order to accept constructions like `CC(a,b)`, but the implementation of `CDF` misses the empty case.
