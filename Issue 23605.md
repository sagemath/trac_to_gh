The constraint generation formulation of the `traveling_salesman_problem` method adds a single edge-cut constraints per round (only for one connected component of the graph of selected edges). With this patch, we add all the constraints we can (one per connected component).

Before

```
sage: G = graphs.Grid2dGraph(10,10)
sage: %timeit G.traveling_salesman_problem()
10 loops, best of 3: 89.8 ms per loop
```

After

```
sage: G = graphs.Grid2dGraph(10,10)
sage: %timeit G.traveling_salesman_problem()
10 loops, best of 3: 40 ms per loop
```
