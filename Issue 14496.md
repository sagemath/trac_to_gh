I don't know why that got removed, it's back now.

> Also, would you mind not updating the ticket's description every minute?
Well, it's not every minute :-)  Anyway, I just kept finding more and more files.

I will now test to build from scratch with these files removed. If that works, I will set the ticket to `needs_review`.
