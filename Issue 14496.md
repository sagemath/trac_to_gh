For upgrading, I would leave `.hgignore` alone.

Where did the originally mentioned (untracked, unused but shipped, at some point generated) `complex_double_api.h` end up?

(Also, would you mind not updating the ticket's description every minute? ;-) )

I don't know why that got removed, it's back now.

Well, it's not every minute :-)  Anyway, I just kept finding more and more files.

I will now test to build from scratch with these files removed. If that works, I will set the ticket to `needs_review`.

Building without all these files worked, now doctesting...

I can confirm that Sage builds, doctests fine with this ticket applied and that the removed files don't appear in the sdist. So the review should be easy...

Due to #14721, four files came back:

```
sage/libs/pari/gen.h
sage/modular/arithgroup/farey_symbol.h
sage/rings/real_mpfi.h
sage/symbolic/pynac.h
```
