I would suggest adding line breaks and using
formatted strings and raw strings as follows.

```



```diff

Perhaps it would be better to return the zero element of the base ring of the cohomology ring. However, it seems a pervasive convention in Sage just to return `0` regardless of the proper parent of the zero.

Anyway, it is not in the scope of this ticket to "fix" it. I just leave it as it is. 

Thank you for the review.
