There still remains a lot of finite (enumerated) sets that are not in the appropriate categories::


```
sage: CartesianProduct([1,2],[2,3]).category()
Category of sets
sage: Permutations().category()
Category of sets
sage: Set([1,2,3]).category()
Category of sets
sage: (GF(3) ^ 2) in FiniteEnumeratedSets()
False
sage: MatrixSpace(GF(3),2) in FiniteEnumeratedSets()
False
sage: DirichletGroup(5).category()
Category of sets
sage: LatticePolytope(matrix(ZZ, [[1,1],[0,1]])).category()
Category of objects
```


By the way, one should fix

```
sage: M = Family(NonNegativeIntegers(), Permutations)
sage: M.cardinality()
```

to uses len internally.

On sage-6.9.beta1 things get better... I modified the description accordingly

I have updated the description with the status as of version 7.4.beta0.

Regarding `LatticePolytope` (one of the examples in the description), I would be reluctant to consider it a finite enumerated set. There should be a distinction between the lattice polytope (an infinite set) and the set of its lattice points. The latter (which also makes sense for non-lattice polytopes) should be made a finite enumerated set.
