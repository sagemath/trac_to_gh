# Issue 33809: pycodestyle cleanup in src/sage/graphs/base/boost_graph.pyx

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/34046

Original creator: dcoudert

Original creation time: 2022-06-21 15:57:52

We fix issues reported by `./sage -tox -e pycodestyle -- src/sage/graphs/base/boost_graph.pyx` except:
- `E402 module level import not at top of file`. Certainly due to the fact that `cimport cython` is before other imports
- `E225 missing whitespace around operator` and `E227 missing whitespace around bitwise or shift operator`  which are related to cast and pointers
