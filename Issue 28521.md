# Issue 28521: random output in a giacpy_sage doctest

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28758

Original creator: @mwageringel

The following `giacpy_sage` doctest runs a probabilistic check and sometimes fails when it prints less than usual.


```
sage -t --long --warn-long 39.5 src/sage/libs/giac.py
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/libs/giac.py", line 209, in sage.libs.giac.?
Failed example:
    B1 = gb_giac(I.gens(),1e-16) # optional - giacpy_sage, long time (1s)
Expected:
    ...adding reconstructed ideal generators...
    ...
    Running a probabilistic check for the reconstructed Groebner basis.
    If successfull, error probability is less than 1e-16 ...
Got:
    Running a probabilistic check for the reconstructed Groebner basis. If successfull, error probability is less than 1e-16 and is estimated to be less than 10^-63. Use proba_epsilon:=0 to certify (this takes more time).
    // Groebner basis computation time 0.88 Memory 181.284M
```


This has occured a few times in the patchbot results, for example [here](https://patchbot.sagemath.org/log/14821/CentOS%20Linux/7.7.1908/x86_64/3.10.0-1062.4.1.el7.x86_64/r640/2019-11-18%2004:32:04).
