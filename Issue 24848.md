# Issue 24848: Add DESTDIR support for zn_poly, and additional cleanup

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/25085

Original creator: embray

Original creation time: 2018-04-03 09:43:12

Keywords: destdir zn_poly

A bit of cleanup for zn_poly's spkg-install:

    1) Implement DESTDIR support and use sage-dist-helpers where useful (#24024)
    
    2) Remove SAGE64 support (#23733)
    
    3) Improve Cygwin support--in particular don't install .so files to lib/ (#14208)

I still need to test this on Cygwin (it should be fine on OSX, but the changes on Cygwin are substantive).  If it works it should also finally resolve #14208, as `zn_poly.so` is the last library being installed on Cygwin as a ".so".

Rebased. Not sure why this wasn't needs_review--perhaps I was just waiting on its dependencies.

I believe this issue can reasonably be addressed for Sage 8.4.
