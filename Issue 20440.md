The fix looks simple.  I'll try it out.
One question: appears that the syntax for the 'dependencies' file is
somewhat loose.  Sometimes the separator for multiple entries is "|",
sometimes " ", and sometimes both.  Is that the case?

Thanks for the pointer.  After brief meditation, I've concluded that 
"six" is a normal prerequisite.  Corrections always welcome.
