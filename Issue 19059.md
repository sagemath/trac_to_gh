Yes, if you do this then there is a breakage, although trivial to fix.  I'm afraid you can get rid of `CollectionLevelsPrecomputed` only after the trivial fix is merged, which will very likely take some time.

That's great that you thought of this!

I fixed two trivial doctesting problems, and I have a few questions and suggestions:

1) the docstring of `oeis_search`

`Returns the OEIS search for the generating function of ``self``.`

could be improved: what's returned is actually the result of an OEIS search.  So perhaps:

`Search the OEIS for the generating function of the statistic.`

2) also, there should be an `OUTPUT` section, perhaps


```
OUTPUT:

- a tuple of OEIS sequences, see :meth:`OEIS.find_by_description` for more information.
```


3) not sure, but I think the blank-line `print` are unconventional.

4) the `EXAMPLES` section does not display correctly in html.

The html now looks almost fine, with the exception of the link to `OEIS.find_by_description()`, which does not work.

There is another, less minor thing: `generating_functions` currently only works for queries that yield statistics, i.e., of the form `findstat(number)`:

```
sage: s=findstat("Permutations", number_of_alignments); s
0: (St000222: The number of alignments of a permutation, [], 200)
sage: s.generating_functions()
...
AttributeError: 'FindStatStatistic' object has no attribute '_generating_function'

sage: s[0][0].generating_functions()
{2: 2,
 3: 3*q + 3,
 4: 12*q^2 + 8*q + 4,
 5: 20*q^4 + 45*q^3 + 35*q^2 + 15*q + 5,
 6: 100*q^6 + 180*q^5 + 198*q^4 + 140*q^3 + 72*q^2 + 24*q + 6}
```


While this is as expected, I think it shouldn't be that way.  In particular, if possible it would be nice to be able to use `oeis_search` even for new statistics.

Of course, this requires that the generating function is computed by the sage interface, and not retrieved from findstat.org.

I'll try to propose a patch shortly.

would you mind fixing this? I have built the documentation at the moment for a different ticket, so that would take me forever.

Here is another question concerning negative statistic values: so far, I had considered the generating function `2q + q^2` as the sequence `0,2,1` where the initial `0` corresponds to the constant term `0`. But if I consider negative statistic values, I might end up with the generating function `q^{-1} + 2q`, which I have to move to the sequence `1,0,2`.

So, should I always shift the sequence of a generating function such that it starts with the first nonzero term?

[I find this counter intuitive for nonnegative statistics, but it is unavoidable for partially negative statistics.]

Finally, it seems special wired if my generating functions are


```
f_1(q) = q^{-1} + q
f_2(q) = 2q + q^2
```

and then shift the first, but not the second, to finally get `1,0,1,0,2,1`.

Okay, if two tickets A and B do two different things, but to develop what I want in B I need A. How am I supposed to be doing that without merging A into B and having A as a dependency in B?

Sorry to get back to this, but `if len(set(all_elements)) != len(all_elements)` assumes the elements to be hashable.

FindStat internally this is totally fine, but that makes the following, very natural, findstat search fail:

```
sage: findstat( { g:g.wiener_index() for g in Graphs(4) if g.is_connected() } )
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
...
TypeError: This graph is mutable, and thus not hashable. Create an immutable copy by `g.copy(immutable=True)`

It will obviously take much longer to do the uniqueness test in a list, but I guess it's worth it. What do you think?

I wonder:

> Derzeit werden alle normalisiert, auch wenn's 17 Millionen sind

- Are really more normalized than used? A search should be restricted to `FINDSTAT_MAX_???` and a new statistic to `FINDSTAT_MAX_***`. Do you now normalize also all the others?

This is silly:

try:

it would be much better to write this is

```
if not foo:

You should also add doctests for these bad inputs.
