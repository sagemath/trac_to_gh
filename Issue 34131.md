Needs review?

Some quick comments:

- I would have expected something called triangle to be more, well, triangle-like. Could you include a definition in each of the triangle classes?
- It might be good to add “X-triangle:” to the start of each of the representation.
- “2-**variable** polynomial”
- Is “toutes” French? It is fine, but I just wanted to make sure the variable name makes sense in at least one language.
- Please spell out “with respect to”.

Thank you.

Last little things:

- I think it would be good to also have an `_ascii_art_` and `_latex_`.
- Should we add the type also to those and/or the `_unicode_art_`?
- Similarly, it would make more sense for the prefix to just be the letter rather than have the `: ` as well.
- Can you add a doctest for `F_triangle` using the empty complex? I have a hunch this will fail because `sum` will return an `int` in this case.

I am slightly worried about `f_triangle` and `F_triangle` causing confusion. Perhaps `F_triangle_polynomial`? I am not sure there is a better name though. I am cc-ing John in case he has an opinion about this.

This is a good suggestion. I am not sure that I want that, as usually it is very clear in my mind what kind of triangle I am seeing. And also, I would not know where to write the prefix. Maybe something like this:

```
    F-triangle
    ⎛ 1  0  0  0⎞
    ⎜ 3  3  0  0⎟
    ⎜ 3  8  5  0⎟
    ⎝ 1  6 10  5⎠
```

doctest added and it was not failing

Yes, this is certainly confusing. I have never heard of the other f-triangle outside of sage, but of course almost nobody has heard of the F-triangle. So, there is some kind of competition in the lack of fame..

First, I haven't heard of `f-triangle` or `F-triangle`. I might lean toward `F-triangle-polynomial` to avoid confusion, but I don't think it's important.

Second, the PDF docs have at least one error: in the docstring for `Gamma_triangle.h`, the displayed math should have `\gamma` rather than `gamma`. I would also use `\left(` and `\right)` for the parentheses. I think this is pretty minor since the PDF documentation for `combinat` is pretty useless: since it doesn't have a meaningful table of contents, you can't find anything, so I'm guessing that no one uses it. I see this for the table of contents:

1. Introductory material .... 1
2. Thematic indices .... 3
3. Utilities ..... 5
4. Related Topics ..... 7
5. Comprehensive Module List ..... 9
6. Indices and Tables ..... 3697
...

Having over 3000 pages under a single t.o.c. entry is just bad. I think there should be maybe two tables of contents: one organized by topic, and maybe one organized alphabetically (based on the current module list).

Anyway, back to the topic at hand: coming in as an outsider, I am left wondering why these polynomials are called "triangles." If it makes sense to address this in the documentation, then that could be added. If you think the people who care already know, then don't worry about it.

Removing `module_list.rst` and inserting its contents into `index.rst` works, sort of.
