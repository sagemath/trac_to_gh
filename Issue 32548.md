```
as compared with `build/make/Makefile.in`:

```
build/make/Makefile.in:SAGE_CHECK_PACKAGES_DEFAULT_yes := !python3
build/make/Makefile.in:SAGE_CHECK_PACKAGES_DEFAULT_warn :=
build/make/Makefile.in:SAGE_CHECK_PACKAGES_DEFAULT_no :=
```
We should unify these settings and document why these choices were made.

I've been doing some tests on two OS X machines, one Intel, one m2.

- `cmake` and `curl` have their test suites disabled by #30093, so we don't need to worry about them at all. `git` doesn't even have a Sage test suite any more.
- `giac` fails its test suite on both machines.
- `gp2c` fails its test suite on both machines.
- `openblas` fails to build at all on `m2`, builds and passes on Intel.
- `ppl` fails its test suite on both machines.
- `rpy2` fails its test suite on both machines.
- `python3` and `cython` have long test suites which often fail (although I didn't try them today), and I think they should be skipped. 

So I would propose that we always skip `giac`, `gp2c`, `ppl`, `rpy2`, `python3`, and `cython`. The other standard packages behaved perfectly well: passed their test suite and did it pretty quickly. Maybe they have problems on other platforms.

I didn't try any optional or experimental packages except for `igraph`, which I tried by mistake. It fails for stupid reasons: `No rule to make target `check'. Stop.`

The points of agreement between the buildbots and comment:7: `giac`, `python3`, `cython`, `rpy2`.

On the buildbots among the standard packages: `gsl`, `givaro`, `zeromq`, `curl` (disabled already), `arb`, `cvxopt`, `cmake` (disabled), `networkx`, `openssl`, `flint`

On the buildbots among other packages: `python2`, `r`, `normaliz`, `yasm` (not a package), `nose` (not a package)

From comment:7: `gp2c`, `openblas` (on m2), `ppl`

What about `meson_python`?

For what it's worth, I'm now seeing a failure with `pari` on OS X Intel, but the test suite passes on Apple Silicon.
