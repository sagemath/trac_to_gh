Currently, there are a bunch of confusing error codes that can show up at the end of CI builds. It would be nice to translate them to something more readable, e.g.,

* 137: the machine was preempted, please try again.
* timeout: there were too many SPKG changes and you are running on shared infrastructure that cannot handle that...
* no space left on device: essentially the same
* ...

For the 137s it would be nice to have a bot that clicks "Retry".

Forgot about this ticket.  Yes, that's a good idea about a bot.  

I wonder if there's a way--though it seems far-fetched--to detect how many packages need to be rebuilt for a given ticket and push the build off to a more powerful machine.

Changing keywords from "" to "ContinuousIntegration".

No, I don't think that's possible in [GitLab](GitLab) CI currently.
