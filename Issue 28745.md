Keywords: polyhedron, face lattice

We use `CombinatorialPolyhedron` to compute the face lattice of a polyhedron.

Along the way we implement `hasse_diagram` for `CombinatorialPolyhedron` and `Polyhedron_base`.

Instead of caching `face_lattice`, we cache `hasse_diagram` now.

This is much slower, but removes a memory leak. As `hasse_diagram` is hardly used with #28646, this seems to be reasonable.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28982

Few comments:


```
-        Test that face lattice give no memory leak::
+        Test that computing the face lattice does not lead to a memory leak::
```



```
-        Return the hasse diagram of ``self``.
+        Return the hasse diagram of the face lattice of ``self``.
```


I will go more in depth soon.

Does this mean that we can remove the file `hasse_diagram.py`?

Hasse is a lastname, so you can capitalize it within the documentation.

Could the function below have more information? Like which order is meant to be simulated here? Inclusion or lex on indices of vertices, etc? Just one more sentence to specify might be nice?


```diff

Is there a reason why the hasse diagram of the combinatorial polyhedron is not cached?

I don't fully understand what's happening in that hash function. If one uses the face iterator in non-dual mode, is the resulting order relation still correct?

You are right.
I'm surprised it worked that way.
The hash function should be consistent now. And `__lt__` returns `None` if the faces are clearly incompatible.
What's nice about this hash function, if I understand it correctly, is that it allows to store faces in sets etc.
