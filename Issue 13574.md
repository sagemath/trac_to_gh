Hmmm, haven't really checked the code, but there are a couple of typos (or grammatical errors) in the documentation (besides *"non**-**negative"*), and a few instances of missing mark-up (such as `self` without double-backquotes).

Wonder on which platform

```
sage: from sage.misc.lazy_list import lazy_list
sage: P = lazy_list(iter(Primes()))[10::4]
sage: P.info()
cache length 0
start        10
stop         2147483647
...
```

will fail (i.e., `INT_MAX` will differ)... ;-)

Hey Vincent,

I've written a review patch which is mostly docstring changes (I've explicitly put in the stop so it does not depend on `INT_MAX`), but I've changed the `_repr_()` by just calculating the number of elements instead of the try-catch blocks. Everything else looks good, so if you agree with the changes, set this to positive review.

Hey Vincent,

I like this implementation much better.

I've added a few tests and tweaked documentation, but I've changed the behavior of `list()` slightly by not checking if stop was large since I did not like the following behavior:

```
sage: L = lazy_list([0,1]); L
lazy list [0, 1]
sage: L.list()
Traceback
...
ValueError: stop is too large!!
```

There definitely is a problem with determining when iterators are infinite throughout sage (for example, `vector(RR, QQ)` in ticket #13556), however I'd rather have finite lazy lists always have a `list()` method not raise an exception.

I've also added a check if the input to lazy list is a list or tuple, then it sets `stop` to the length of the list if `stop` was not specified.

If you agree with the changes, feel free to set this to positive review.

Best,

Travis

Hi Travis,

The doctest for .info() fails on my machine and for patchbot (if the test pass on your machine, I guess that we do not have the same PY_SSIZE_T_MAX). So I changed it.

I also add a TODO in the method `._update_cache_up_to(n)` which may be enhanced (but I was not able to do it because of my poor knowledge of cython).

Best,
Vincent
