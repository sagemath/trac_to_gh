# Issue 21396: complete documentation for Singular interface related functions

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/21633

Original creator: jakobkroeker

Original creation time: 2016-10-03 19:19:03

Keywords: Singular interface documentation

The documentation of many functions in
`src/libs/singular/ `
is missing or incomplete. => fix it.

Some namings also seems unfortunate.

(Personally I was confused at least by `si2sa...()`' and `sa2si...()`' After a while I got that it was 'SingularToSage' and 'SageToSingular'
)
