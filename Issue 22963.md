This was noted in #22853:

```
sage: G = sage.plot.plot3d.base.Graphics3dGroup()
sage: G.texture_set()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
...
TypeError: reduce() of empty sequence with no initial value
```

This should not fail but instead return an empty set, which is consistent with other such objects.
