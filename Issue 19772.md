This should do the work.

This does not work. As such it returns the second element of the alphabet, as an element of the string monoid:


```
sage: b = BinaryStrings()
sage: b.one()
1
sage: b.one() * b('001')
1001

sage: b = AlphabeticStrings()
sage: b.one()
B
```



What we are looking here is the neutral element for the multiplication, which you can get as `StringMonoidElement(self, '')`.

You still need to add some doctests.

Also, why creating a `_identity_element` attribute while it is used only once, why not directly define the identity element in the `one` method ?

The identity element might be required somewhere else, so I thought let it be declared as a member of the class, though for now I'll move it locally.

Oh, I didn't think about this happening ! I will fix it in a commit quickly.
