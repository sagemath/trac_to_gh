```
.../share/texmf/tex/latex/sagetex/sagetexparse.py:135: SyntaxWarning: "is not" with a literal. Did you mean "!="?
  if t.format is not '':
```


This is [already fixed upstream](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetex/commit/3a22234a28e4850be169d98fba78d90369a4723e#diff-0b17ad5d149a4c8e23b977c2da6375d92582ee11347d8f5a6b9e365ca9399d28L499).

we should rather go ahead with updating sagetex to 3.6.

I hope to be able to have a look at it again next week.

I think this outdated after the update done in #32887.
