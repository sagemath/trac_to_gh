Apparently we have an option for that, `--initial`

The documentation of `--initial` says it only shows the first failure in each **file**, not each test block. Would it make sense to have one for test blocks, too?

I think the documentation is misleading. I think it shows the first for each function, not just each file. For example, in https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/runs/7511728534?check_suite_focus=true, if you look for `sage.repl.ipython_kernel.widgets_sagenb`
