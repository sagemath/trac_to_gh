# Issue 24367: No evaluation with some functions

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/24604

Original creator: rws

Original creation time: 2018-01-29 08:11:21

In a systematic search the following cases were found:

```
sage: arctan2(7,CDF(.92))
arctan2(7, 0.92)
sage: arctan2(7,CBF(.92))
arctan2(7, [0.9200000000000000 +/- 4.00e-17])
sage: elliptic_eu(7, CIF(1.7))
elliptic_eu(7, 1.7000000000000000?)
sage: elliptic_eu(7, complex(1.7))
elliptic_eu(7, (1.7+0j))
sage: jacobi_am(7, CIF(1.7))
jacobi_am(7, 1.7000000000000000?)
sage: jacobi_am(7, complex(1.7))
jacobi_am(7, (1.7+0j))
```

The systematic test will be committed with #24299.

The arctan cases were due to a case in `py_atan2` not converting to the common `P`.

The `beta` cases are fixed in Pynac-0.7.16.

For `jacobi_am` the eval function was enhanced. This revealed the conversion problem of #24630 which we now depend on.

Same applies to `elliptic_eu`.
