I just lost quite a lot of time because of the following:


```
sage: Partition([QQ(1)]).to_exp()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

   3037         for i in p:
   3038             a[i-1] += 1

I guess that `Partition` should check its input.

This is fixed in #27146

Are you sure this should be closed?  #27146 is still open.


---

Comment by tscrim created at 2019-02-22 05:59:22

Yes, I am very sure because, as you said, #27146 fixes the problem.
