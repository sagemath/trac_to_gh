Hey Jeff,

I've uploaded a review patch which reworks the documentation a little bit. If you could describe the algorithm to create the left/right key tableaux in less than 10 lines or so, could you please write that in (and fold the two patches if you have any other changes to make too). Otherwise if you agree with my changes, feel free to set this to positive review.

Thanks,

Travis,
Thanks for taking a look at my first attempt at a sage patch. I tried applying your patch but got this error:

patching file sage/combinat/tableau.py
Hunk #3 FAILED at 2314
1 out of 3 hunks FAILED -- saving rejects to file sage/combinat/tableau.py.rej
abort: patch failed to apply

This might be my error since I'm new at this, I'm not sure. However, the patch still shows your suggestions clearly and I'll work up another patch to incorporate them.

-Jeff

Hey Jeff,

In the descriptions of `left/right_key_tableau()`, could you format it in latex using single backticks as ``T`` instead of code (as double backticks ```T```) in everything but the first line. In case you are unaware, you can view the documentation (for the combinat directory) by running `sage -docbuild reference/combinat html`.

Looks good otherwise. Thanks, 

Travis
