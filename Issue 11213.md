The closure of the torus orbit associated to a cone of the fan is again a toric variety. This patch implements a method `toric_variety.orbit_closure(cone)` to construct this toric variety.

Um, I don't really understand the documentation of the first (private) function. Could you please expand/rewrite it a bit?-) In particular the INPUT section is a bit confusing given that there are two parameters and one of them is already called cone.

As a possible optimization

```
return ToricVariety(Fan(cones))
```

can be replaced with

```
return ToricVariety(Fan(discard_faces(cones), check=False))
```

where `discard_faces` is added to the fan module by #11200.

Thanks for having a look! Instead of `apply`, its probably better to use `import_patch` like this:

```
sage: hg_sage.import_patch('http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/raw-attachment/ticket/11385/trac_11385_orbit_closure_as_toric_variety.patch')
```

You probably downloaded the html-formatted patch instead of the raw patch file.

If you want to get more serious about Sage development then you should read about mercurial queues, though. This is a much better way to handle multiple patches.

Making it work properly with quotient lattices is a noble goal, of course.

Another question is where to put the method to restrict line bundles from the ambient to the orbit closure. Because of the quotient lattice it is not literally pull-back by a toric morphism. I tend to think that `ToricOrbitClosure` should derive from `ToricVariety` and add a `restrict_divisor()` method.

Though as far as this ticket is concerned, I think we all agree that there should be a `.orbit_closure(cone)` method for toric varieties that returns a toric variety. So maybe we should merge this ticket before improving the presentation of the resulting toric variety.

Ideally the toric variety of the orbit closure should come with the canonical embedding, even though it does not come from a fan morphism. So I think it would be better to have the restriction directly in the toric variety class.

The attached patch contains bits of code that move us closer to supporting quotient lattices, so I propose to add them - I wrote them while making the commented code work. It still does not work for cones, so I agree to leave the rest of necessary changes for the future. I also changed the docstrings quite a bit, hopefully for the best ;-)

If you are OK with the new stuff, please switch to positive review.
