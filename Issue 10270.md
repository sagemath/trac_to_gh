# Issue 10270: Make big_oh notation work for any element that has degree() and add_bigoh() properties

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/10271

On can use the big-oh notation

O(x^n)

when x is a generator of a power series or a laurent series. It is convenient to also be able to use this notation when the parent of x is another ring (for example, a subclass of a power series ring).

For this, we only need x to implement x.degree() and x.add_bigoh(). I made a patch for sage.rings.big_oh that tests for this and returns x.add_bigoh(x.degree()) when possible.

I just added the patch in the right format, i.e. the output of hg_sage.export() instead of a normal diff.

Applied patch to sage-4.7.1.alpha2, did 'sage -b', then 'make testlong'.  All tests passed.  Positive review!

I think this patch needs an extra doctest to demonstrate what it does and that it works as expected.

The following behavior is bad.  In both cases, I think one should get an error.

```
sage: R.<x> = QQ[[]]
sage: O(1+x^10)
O(x^10)
sage: f = x*(1/x + x^9); type(f)
<type 'sage.rings.laurent_series_ring_element.LaurentSeries'>
sage: O(f)
O(x^0)
```

I could have reviewed this sooner, sorry about that. However, the ticket's dependencies are still open, so maybe we should still wait for them to be accepted? 

This doesn't apply to v5.4 anymore. I also couldn't easily fix that myself. I'll set the status to needs_work.
