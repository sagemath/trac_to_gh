On can use the big-oh notation

O(x^n)

when x is a generator of a power series or a laurent series. It is convenient to also be able to use this notation when the parent of x is another ring (for example, a subclass of a power series ring).

For this, we only need x to implement x.degree() and x.add_bigoh(). I made a patch for sage.rings.big_oh that tests for this and returns x.add_bigoh(x.degree()) when possible.

The following behavior is bad.  In both cases, I think one should get an error.

I could have reviewed this sooner, sorry about that. However, the ticket's dependencies are still open, so maybe we should still wait for them to be accepted? 

This doesn't apply to v5.4 anymore. I also couldn't easily fix that myself. I'll set the status to needs_work.
