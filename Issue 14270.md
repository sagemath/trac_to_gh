The latter works if `optional=` is removed from the invocation of `sage -t`.

I would say that when you type --optional=nauty, ONLY the tests that are flagged with nauty are getting executed... Look at the number of doctests run with those commands :

```
~/sage$ sage -tp 4 --optional=nauty graphs/digraph.py 
Running doctests with ID 2013-04-25-09-19-33-f65408dd.
Doctesting 1 file using 4 threads.
sage -t graphs/digraph.py
    [0 tests, 0.0 s]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Total time for all tests: 0.1 seconds
    cpu time: 0.0 seconds
    cumulative wall time: 0.0 seconds
~/sage$ sage -tp 4 graphs/digraph.py 
Running doctests with ID 2013-04-25-09-19-39-5fd4f5f8.
Doctesting 1 file using 4 threads.
sage -t graphs/digraph.py
    [387 tests, 5.4 s]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Total time for all tests: 5.6 seconds
    cpu time: 5.3 seconds

Try this instead :

```
sage -tp 4 --optional=sage,nauty -l graphs/
```
