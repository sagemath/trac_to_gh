I would even go further than Travis: it would be better to completely avoid calling the characteristic. That way
- it will not trigger an error (so that you can remove `try/except`)
- faster, simpler
- avoid having a `FractionField` more aware of categories than the initial base ring

Better! One has to fix polynomial rings then (not their fraction fields).

```
sage: QQ['x'] in Sets().Infinite()
False
