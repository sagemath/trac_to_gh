Implement the solid angle measure of a three-dimensional cone, using formulas relying on basic trigonometry.

Examples:

The solid angle of the first octant `solid_angle_3d([[0,0,1],[1,0,0],[0,1,0]])` is 1/8.

The solid angle measure of `Cone([(1,0,0),(0,0,1),(-1,-1,-1)])` is `solid_angle_3d([[1,0,0],[0,0,1],[-1,-1,-1]])` which equals 7/24.

The upper half-space `Cone([(1,0,0),(-1,0,0),(0,1,0),(0,0,1)])` has solid angle measure`solid_angle_3d([[1,0,0],[-1,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,1]])` which equals 1/2.
