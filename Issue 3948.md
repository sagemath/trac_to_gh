# Issue 3948: [with spkg, needs review] Add 64 bit OSX build support for clisp

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/3948

Original creator: mabshoff

Original creation time: 2008-08-25 07:34:09

Assignee: mabshoff

AN updated spkg is at

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mabshoff/release-cycles-3.1.2/alpha1/clisp-2.46.p7.spkg

It disables readline since we cannot build clisp in 64 bit mode.

Cheers,

Michael
