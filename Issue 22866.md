# Issue 22866: Move richcmp stuff to new file

Issue created by migration from Trac.

The file `src/sage/structure/sage_object.pyx` contains a lot of stuff to deal with rich comparisons. Given that more of this will be added in #23102, I suggest to create a new file `src/sage/structure/richcmp.pyx` for this.

The fixes are totally trivial, so I'm setting this back to positive_review.
