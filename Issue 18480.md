Code looks good. Fixed some minor typos in the documentation. 

Two suggestions for the documentation would be to mention in the definition that `p_{\lambda(F)`} is referring to the power symmetric function, and to add a field for `.. INPUT::` mentioning that R can optionally specify the base ring. I could see them being left off if this were a method on symmetric functions, but as a method of graphs, people might not be familiar with those things.

Make those changes (unless you have a compelling reason to leave them off), then set positive review on my behalf.
