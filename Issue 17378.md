Like for #17614, the document entitled "Three Lectures about Explicit Methods in Number Theory Using Sage" is a document of its own though it is literally a thematic tutorial. This branch moves it where it belongs.

Note: in order to look at this branch's diff you should use `git diff -M HEAD ^develop`. Otherwise you will see files being added/removed while they are only renamed. The -M option makes this clear.

There was no localization problem that I saw, and in particular both html and pdf documentation were built successfully. There is not a single non-ascii character in any of those two folders.

> and I wonder where those would fit.

You mean "among the thematic tutorials" ? Nothing unusual there:
- "Numerical Computations" that contains the bordeaux2008 document and the LP tutorial
- "Number Theory" contains three documents, among which the moved 'three lectures [...]'.

> Also be careful about the actual Sage webpage which would need to have links change, probably (looks like you did the "website" in src/doc).

I learned the existence of that file while reviewing your patch recently, and modified it in those two branches. It looks good.

No, I meant I think that someone has translated at least one of these documents already!  So they live in some other doc/xy folder.  Maybe those are only under review.

Right, but what I mean is that the actual Sage website also has links, see https://github.com/sagemath/website which is not the same.

Hello,

> No, I meant I think that someone has translated at least one of these documents already!  So they live in some other doc/xy folder.  Maybe those are only under review.

It seems so. There is no folder with a name similar to any of those two in the folder corresponding to other languages.

> Right, but what I mean is that the actual Sage website also has links, see https://github.com/sagemath/website which is not the same.

There does not seem to be any link toward any of those two documents on sagemath.org.

Thank you for pointing this out, I missed it. Can it be done with a sage branch, or is it orthogonal ?

Okay. I will do this when those two tickets will be reviewed. There is always some time before a positive review and the next update of the online doc.
