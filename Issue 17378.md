# Issue 17378: Move bordeaux_2008 into thematic_tutorials

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/17615

Original creator: ncohen

Original creation time: 2015-01-11 09:30:05

CC:  kcrisman jhpalmieri

Like for #17614, the document entitled "Three Lectures about Explicit Methods in Number Theory Using Sage" is a document of its own though it is literally a thematic tutorial. This branch moves it where it belongs.

Note: in order to look at this branch's diff you should use `git diff -M HEAD ^develop`. Otherwise you will see files being added/removed while they are only renamed. The -M option makes this clear.

I won't be thinking about these two tickets immediately, but did want to point out that at least a couple of them may have localizations and I wonder where those would fit.  Also be careful about the actual Sage webpage which would need to have links change, probably (looks like you did the "website" in src/doc).

There was no localization problem that I saw, and in particular both html and pdf documentation were built successfully. There is not a single non-ascii character in any of those two folders.

> and I wonder where those would fit.

You mean "among the thematic tutorials" ? Nothing unusual there:
- "Numerical Computations" that contains the bordeaux2008 document and the LP tutorial
- "Number Theory" contains three documents, among which the moved 'three lectures [...]'.

> Also be careful about the actual Sage webpage which would need to have links change, probably (looks like you did the "website" in src/doc).

I learned the existence of that file while reviewing your patch recently, and modified it in those two branches. It looks good.

No, I meant I think that someone has translated at least one of these documents already!  So they live in some other doc/xy folder.  Maybe those are only under review.

Right, but what I mean is that the actual Sage website also has links, see https://github.com/sagemath/website which is not the same.

Hello,

> No, I meant I think that someone has translated at least one of these documents already!  So they live in some other doc/xy folder.  Maybe those are only under review.

It seems so. There is no folder with a name similar to any of those two in the folder corresponding to other languages.

> Right, but what I mean is that the actual Sage website also has links, see https://github.com/sagemath/website which is not the same.

There does not seem to be any link toward any of those two documents on sagemath.org.

Incorrect.  See http://sagemath.org/help.html#SageStandardDoc and 
> Numerical Sage, PDF — how to do numerical computing with Sage
> Explicit Methods in Number Theory, PDF — computing with number fields and modular forms

Thank you for pointing this out, I missed it. Can it be done with a sage branch, or is it orthogonal ?

Orthogonal (you can also email Harald for questions, or do a PR there), but obviously related.

Okay. I will do this when those two tickets will be reviewed. There is always some time before a positive review and the next update of the online doc.

For me this patch is working correctly, and since the modification of some links pointing to these pages cannot be done in this patch, I propose to change the status to positive review.

Nathann, don't forget to ask for the required modifications.

Pushes this test over the threshold:

```
sage -t --long --warn-long 70.4 src/sage/misc/sagedoc.py
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/misc/sagedoc.py", line 1039, in sage.misc.sagedoc.?
Failed example:
    len(search_doc('tree', whole_word=True, interact=False).splitlines()) < 1000  # long time
Expected:
    True
Got:
    False
```
