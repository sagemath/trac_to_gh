This is not the right direction. If I understand well, you have copy/paste the code of Yuki Kawata, and do various edits in different files.

I you want to use the code of Yuki Kawata, you can propose an interface to this code and make it an optional package of Sagemath (at first an experimental package). See the developper manual.

I don't have the expertise to check if this is the right way to make an experimental package. I will call for help.
Meanwhile, where can I find the tarball ?

Batch modifying tickets that will likely not be ready for 9.1, based on a review of the ticket title, branch/review status, and last modification date.

Information how to make a new package is here: https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/packaging.html

Note that a new feature is to provide the `upstream_url` directly in the checksums file, see for instance #30342.

Because the upstream url is not provided, I change the status to needs work.

Also it seems the branch is doing a `chmod` change to the file `src/sage/graphs/centrality.pyx` which is weird.
