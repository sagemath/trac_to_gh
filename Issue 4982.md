The point was to consolidate the three shift methods `shift`, `__lshift__`, and `__rshift__` by having `shift` do all the work and the other two call it.  (Right now there's significant code triplication going on.)

The attached patch does this.

```

The only issue I can see is the potential performance overhead.

Vanilla 4.2.1:


```
sage: P.<x> = GF(2)[]
sage: f = P.random_element(50)
sage: %timeit f<<50
1000000 loops, best of 3: 792 ns per loop
```


This patch:


```
sage: P.<x> = GF(2)[]
sage: f = P.random_element(50)
sage: %timeit f<<50
1000000 loops, best of 3: 952 ns per loop
```


Maybe a cdef method could be added which everyone (`shift`, `__lshift__`, `__rshift__`) calls?

Alex and I were discussing this off-list. The speedup patch does the following:

* added a new C function which all methods call now 
* I inlined it
* and I changed the code to avoid some initialisation

Here is what I got:

**Vanilla:**

```
sage: P.<x> = GF(2)[]
sage: f = P.random_element(50)
sage: %timeit f<<50
1000000 loops, best of 3: 730 ns per loop
```


**Patch:**

```
sage: P.<x> = GF(2)[]
sage: f = P.random_element(50)
sage: %timeit f<<50
1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.06 Âµs per loop
```


**Patch + Speed-up:**

```
sage: P.<x> = GF(2)[]
sage: %timeit f<<50
1000000 loops, best of 3: 761 ns per loop
```


So there is still some overhead, but I think its acceptable.

So I believe that Martin gave a positive review to my patch, except for the performance issue.

I have read and tested his patch, and I'm happy with it.
