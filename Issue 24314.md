Good to know is that there is a metaclass `InheritComparison` which is supposed to fix that problem.

Changing component from PLEASE CHANGE to python3.

Comment by embray created at 2018-01-16 16:00:42

I've also, at least, provisionally, implemented `__hash__`'s for a lot of classes.  I haven't pushed any of those changes yet because I've been lazy about adding docstrings for them and need to do that.

There are also lots of cases where it's fine to just assign `__hash__ = BaseClass.__hash__` (in fact this is the case for all classes).  That said, the default `__hash__` a lot of classes have is not very good, or sometimes problematic (e.g. I think some object are hashable even though they're not immutable).  So it's a good opportunity to check those on a case base case basis.

```
src/sage/combinat/rigged_configurations/bij_abstract_class.py
```

and its subclasses should never be used in a hash (it is a helper class to perform a bijection) and the `__eq__` is just there so the `TestSuite` with the pickling passes. Probably the better thing to do here is to remove the `__eq__` and skip the pickling test (this is some of the first code I contributed to Sage, memories...).

Comment by embray created at 2018-05-17 09:33:58

Quick question one of you can maybe answer:  If a class inherits from `UniqueRepresentation`, then should it even be implementing `__eq__`?  ISTM it should just use the `__eq__` implementation inherited from `UniqueRepresentation` (via `WithEqualityById`).

I've found several classes that inherit from `UniqueRepresentation` but that still implement their own `__eq__` like:


```
def __eq__(self, other):
    return isinstance(other, type(self)) and self.foo == other.foo and self.bar == other.bar
```


for some list of various attributes of the objects that are mostly determined at the object's construction.

I admit I don't fully understand yet how `UniqueRepresentation` is supposed to work though (I will read the docs for it carefully now).  But it seems like it should implicitly cover this use case (and thus eliminate the need for a lot of explicit `__eq__` and hence `__hash__` implementations).


---

Comment by embray created at 2018-05-17 09:39:43

Or could it be that in some of these cases their `__eq__` is defined more broadly than just equality by identity?  I admit in some of these cases I don't know the mathematical background well enough to determine this, and the given examples don't always make the intent clear either.


---

Comment by embray created at 2018-05-17 09:46:35

Okay, quoting the docs:

> Instances of a class have a _unique instance behavior_ when instances of this class evaluate equal if and only if they are identical.

So IIUC, a class really shouldn't be inheriting `UniqueRepresentation` unless they truly do define equality by identity.  So either these classes shouldn't be defining `__eq__`, or they aren't using `UniqueRepresentation` appropriately (and should perhaps just be using `CachedRepresentation` at the most).

That sounds reasonable.

I'm just going through `sage.algebras` and finding several cases like this (this is where I started since that's where I was recently toiling on the `__hash__` issue).  Indeed, it seems many of these classes predate, and/or have `__eq__` methods that predate `UniqueRepresentation`.


---

Comment by embray created at 2018-05-18 09:21:10

Another angle to this that Jeroen has already pointed out a couple times is that there is `InheritComparison`.  This could be extended to also automatically force the inheritance of `__hash__`.  I think that would solve a lot of this "for free".  But what I've also found is that this has exposed many cases where class's default inherited `__hash__`es are not well-defined w.r.t. their `__eq__`, or other issues like in #25387.

In other words, I think that the new behavior in Python 3, while annoying in terms of how much it breaks in Sage, is good that it forces us to think more carefully about this.  So I'd be hesitant to resort to such a brute-force fix except as a last resort.

Comment by egourgoulhon created at 2018-06-03 20:27:37

Among the files listed in the ticket description, the case 

```
src/sage/manifolds/continuous_map.py
```

is dealt with by #25502.
The other manifold cases: 

```
src/sage/manifolds/chart.py
src/sage/manifolds/chart_func.py
src/sage/manifolds/differentiable/affine_connection.py
src/sage/manifolds/differentiable/tensorfield.py
src/sage/manifolds/scalarfield.py
```

should trigger no Python3 issue since none of these classes is intended to be hashable. Same thing for 

```
src/sage/tensor/modules/comp.py
src/sage/tensor/modules/free_module_morphism.py
src/sage/tensor/modules/free_module_tensor.py
src/sage/tensor/modules/tensor_with_indices.py
```

fix many Python 3 doctest failures in `sage/homology`. I don't know if this is the correct approach, or perhaps there is something more systematic to make hashes inherit even when `__eq__` is defined.


---

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2018-07-25 22:51:33

If you're using the `__hash__` of `UniqueRepresentation` but not its `__eq__`, then you're doing it wrong. So this might indicate an actual bug.


---

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2018-07-25 23:00:44

That class has the line

```
    __eq__ = is_isomorphic
```

so that generator names (for example) don't affect equality. (`is_isomorphic` just checks whether the elementary divisors match up.) We could define `__hash__` correspondingly. For the simplicial complex code, the important thing (I think) is that the class of abelian groups is hashable. I assume that any reasonable hash function will work.

(I also don't know how or why the design decisions for `AbelianGroup_class` were made.)

+
     def is_isomorphic(left, right):
         """
         Check whether ``left`` and ``right`` are isomorphic
```

works just as well, at least as far as the homology code is concerned.

This is different from most other things in Sage though. For example

```
sage: GF(9, 'a') == GF(9, 'b')
False
sage: QQ['x'] == QQ['y']
False
```


I'm not saying that this is necessarily a bug. However, if you can change `__eq__` without breaking anything else, I would do that instead of changing `__hash__`.

I opened #25935 for `AbelianGroup_class`. Please continue the discussion there.


---

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2018-07-26 18:54:42

I opened #25940 for `ChainComplex_class`.

Added one for `HyperellipticCurve_generic` in #25946.

Comment by chapoton created at 2018-10-23 13:50:10

Maybe we can now close this one ? I think there remains one bad hash somewhere not returning int, but this is another issue.


---

Comment by chapoton created at 2018-10-23 13:50:10

Changing status from new to needs_review.


---

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2018-10-23 15:10:31

What about the underlying issue of the ticket, "defining `__eq__` breaks inheritance of `__hash__`"? Does that need to be addressed?


---

Comment by chapoton created at 2018-10-23 15:13:21

Well, we are not going to change this. This is the behaviour of python3, dot.


---

Comment by embray created at 2018-10-28 13:37:04

Is there some problem with setting the "milestone" to 8.5 and then closing it as "worksforme"?  This way we can say "as of 8.5" this should work, and any new instance of this issue that occurs after 8.5 is a regression against this ticket and should be addressed in a new ticket.

Are we sure we've gotten all of these?  Odile was saying to me just yesterday she thought there were more cases to fix...

No sorry `@`chapoton `@`embray. My mistake apparently.

I wouldn't put it in that milestone.  If we're calling this fixed as of Sage 8.5 then that's worth making note of.  It can just be closed as fixed.

Indeed, I haven't seen any new cases of this in a while.
