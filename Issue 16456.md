# Issue 16456: doctests of attributes and of end_doc are not tested

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/16693

Original creator: dkrenn

Original creation time: 2014-07-21 09:24:46

Keywords: doctests not tested

In #16677 we added a documentation for the attribute `is_initial` of the class `FSMState` in the file `sage/combinat/finite_state_machine.py` and added some doctests there. Those are not tested at all, which shouldn't be. 
MOreover, doctests which are in end_doc, as for example in `sage/combinat/dyck_word.py` are also  not tested.
