Let G be a group. A G-cycle index is a map from G to the ring of cycle index series. These objects are useful for enumerating G-species (species equipped with an equivariant G-action), where they serve a role analogous to the cycle indices of species.

This patch offers an implementation of G-cycle indices with their most important algebraic features (sum, product, and composition/plethysm). (The plethysm of G-cycle indices is defined in a funny way that really depends on having access to the whole G-cycle index at once; otherwise, there wouldn't be much point in having this code.)

This code is (believed to be) complete and functional. It could use a bit of attention of someone who understand the coersion system better than I do, though.

(This code weakly depends on #14846; the class implemented here has a `derivative` method which calls down to `CycleIndexSeries.derivative`, which does not currently do what it should.)

<a id='comment:4'></a>Hi Andrew!

Thanks for your patch; this sounds interesting! I am not sure I'll have the time to make a complete review, so if anyone wants to jump in, please do! In the mean time, here are some little comments:

A G-cycle index can be interpreted as a formal linear combination of elements of G, with coefficients which are symmetric powersum functions, right? If so, may I recommend to build on top of:

```
  CombinatorialFreeModule(SymmetricFunctions(QQ).p(), G)
```

Then you would get the data structure and the additive structure for free. And all the neat little accessors and such provided by CombinatorialFreeModule.

You may want to explore the tutorials "Using Free Modules and Vector Spaces" and "Implementing Algebraic Structures" from:

```
http://combinat.sagemath.org/doc/thematic_tutorials/index-sage-combinat.html
```

See also

```
http://combinat.sagemath.org/doc/thematic_tutorials/coercion_and_categories.html
```
which is now in Sage's official thematic tutorials.

You probably also want to link back to the cycle_index method of permutation groups.

Cheers,
                                        Nicolas

Thanks for the feedback! I'll take a look at those tutorials.

Implementing the ring of G-cycle indices as a CombinatorialFreeModule is an interesting idea. It's definitely appropriate from a formal perspective. At first glance, I'm concerned that it will make it harder to work with the (ordinary) cycle indices associated to the various elements of G, which are really the point of these objects, but maybe that's actually more straightforward than it looks to my naïve eyes. I'll have a go at it, in any case.

If you stumble on a concrete use case where the syntax seems to go in
your way, please post it here, and we will see what we can do!

By the way: we are in the process of finalizing those two first
tutorials. If you want to use the occasion to proofread them and send
feedback, that would be great!

Glad to hear that was the right infrastructure for you!

For a quick implementation of morphism between the two things you can probably do something like:

    KG2.module_morphism(KG1.monomial*G1, codomain=G1).register_as_coercion()

(where KG1 / KG2 are the cycle index rings for G1 / G2). I can be more precise later ...

Then comes the question of whether you want to have those morphism be defined automatically. I tend to be conservative and not add them until it really itches me so much that I can't do otherwise. It's easier for backward compatibility to add coercions than remove them!

Jumping on my train!

This appears to be a regression in 5.10 related to the string representations of linear combinations. It appears to be caused by a change in the misc.repr_lincomb method, which now assumes that the coefficients of abstract linear combinations can be compared to 0. I've submitted a ticket (#14751) to try to sort this out. 
> * you need to add 3 missing doctests


I have uploaded a new version of the patch which adds the missing doctests.
