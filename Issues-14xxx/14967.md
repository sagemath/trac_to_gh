I've found the following bug with DiGraph :

```python
sage: G=DiGraph({0:{},1/2:{}});G
DiGraph on 1 vertex
```
I've found where is the error. It's in the file $SAGE_ROOT/sage/graphs/base/c_graph.pyx, in function get_vertex :

```python
try:
    u_int = u
except StandardError:
    return -1
```
should be replaced by :

```python
from sage.rings.integer_ring import IntegerRing
if u in IntegerRing():
    u_int = int(u)
else:
    return -1
```
I've tried, and it corrects the problem.

But I'm not sure that it's the right way to correct the problem, because I don't understand exactly how this code works. For me it's very weird (and a source of bugs) to distinguish whether or not u is an integer : it should be any hashable vertex and that's all. Why they wants to have the integer corresponding to u (as an index in the hash table) be equal to u when u is an integer ?

I am worried that  `if u in IntegerRing` will take a long time due to coercion. Have you done any profiling to see the difference?

Ok, I understand.
So the test `if u in IntegerRing()` is not a good idea, it would be better to impose u to be of type int for example :

```python
if type(u) == int:
   u_int = u
else:
   return -1
```
This should be faster.
And it's better to impose a strict type for the number, because an 1 in a given number field is not the same that an 1 in an other number field for example (we can imagine a graph with differents vertex 1, although it's weird).

The last correction that I proposed doesn't work because `u` can also be of type `Integer` or `IntMod` in many tests (we should write `if type(u) == int or if type(u) == Integer or type(u) == IntMod:`).

I think that the right way to have fast algorithms with usuals graphs would be to use a different implementation for theses graphs, with vertex labeled by integers 0, 1, 2, ...
You will just have to check at the initialization which implementation we should use (and it's not a problem if it's slow here I think), and then it uses the best implementation to manipulate the graph.
I think it will not be difficult to do this.
Do you think it's a good idea ?
