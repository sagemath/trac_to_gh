PS: the value of a `KeyError` should be the missing key. So you should either

```
raise KeyError(username)
```
or

```
raise LookupError("no user '%s'"%username)
```

I don't know whether it really matters. As a matter of correct documentation, it is something which can easily be fixed (simply by stating that sagenb is really GPLv3).

Nothing, given that Sage-as-distribution already has GPLv3 as only applicable license. Sage-the-library is GPLv2+.

sage: notebook()

so Twisted got updated to version 13 along the way. 

But I have no clue how to tell what version is actually being run. Can one implement some functionality for this? Otherwise  this will keep causing trouble... Something like `notebook.version()`.

Correct, but I thought that was the only way to do *development* with the sagenb (which I needed for sws2rst).  I'm going to try this again.  I just did 

```
$ git pull upstream master
```
but maybe I also have to do some `python setup.py develop` command in addition, *even after I already had done so at some point*?  I hadn't done that.  In fact, reading the comments above, it seems I should do that, though

I agree about the 0.10.7 (or 0.10.6.1 or whatever).  Note that these are in master, so I think what you mean is you want is for release to get updated to master or something?

I'm also wondering whether the spkg eventually created will be from the release branch or master branch.  The master branch is missing things like some doctest fixes and of course anything new mentioned by Andrey et al. in the last while.  Maybe there should be a 0.10.7 release that includes all the fixes before finally merging this.

You must be right.    I thought that this was only run as an option, but closer scrutiny says not.   Mathjax isn't supposed to be killed off:

```
if el.tag=='script' and el.get('type')=='math/tex' and not el.get('src'):
    return True
```
but apparently it's not working right.  Maybe it's working okay but some other stuff around it is removed so that the Mathjax doesn't render?

In any case, I feel like it should be an *option* to have this happen, and now I see it's required for all published worksheets.  I could be persuaded otherwise, but at least this should work first :)

Then we need to push (force) this update to sagenb master.

Do we want to do that? Will this automatically revert the status of jason's pull request to "open" again?

Why does this ticket depend on #10637?

On the one hand, we need to update to version 0.10.7.1 of the notebook to be able to switch to the integrated git repository. On the other hand, we try to keep the number of changes to a minimum. Is it okay to update the sage notebook in the git repository without applying #10637 there?

Replying to [@tkluck](#comment%3A79):
> Why does this ticket depend on #10637?

The changes to the notebook to support sws2rst have already [been merged](https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb/pull/160) and is present in 0.10.7.1.

As such you don't really need to apply #10637 to Sage to get a functional notebook. You won't lose any functionality in Sage, except that the sws2rst option won't be present. Doctests in sagenb should not fail, as long as you do not doctest the optional parts.
