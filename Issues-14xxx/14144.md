Another issue with the new IPython: if someone has cloned their Sage library, then previous versions of Sage would print the branch name on startup:

```
Loading Sage library. Current Mercurial branch is: my-branch
```
With #12719, the branch no longer prints on startup. The sage-combinat group, for example, use branches all the time, so this behavior should be restored.

For the record, I removed the branch printing in #14024 because it was broken and nobody noticed (until it hit my patchbot, which uses branches). 

I don't mind putting it back in, but is view of the switch to git I don't think its worth the effort.
