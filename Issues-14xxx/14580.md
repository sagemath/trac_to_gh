Currently, it is not possible to change the legend font color in Sage at all. [This link](http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.python.matplotlib.general/24674) shows how to do it in matplotlib - it is not straightforward in matplotlib either.

I think the way to introduce it is

1. Allow a `legend_color` parameter to each plot.
2. Keep track of the individual legend colors via a key in the `Graphics._legend_opts` dictionary.
3. The key will contain a list of colors, defaulting to black or None (I prefer None, so that we use matplotlib's default).
4. After all the plots have been rendered and the legend as been set, we can follow the method in the link above to extract all the texts and set the colors individually, skipping the ones which are None (if the default is None).

I added a new attribute `self._legend_colors = []` to `Graphics`. This will hold the colors or `None` in case no colors are provided. Patch needs review.

*Edit*: It is now possible to get a graph [like this](http://i.imgur.com/1hpaBbw.png):

```
sage: p1 = plot(x, legend_label='this is x', legend_color='red', color='red')
