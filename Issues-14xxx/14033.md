In Singular/Makefile.in there is specific treatment no to link directly to libm but as a counterpart the other needed libs are hardcoded rather than deduced from the autotools NEED_LIBS variable.
And these hardcoded libs include ncurses rather than termcap (which we provided, is correctly detected by configure and put in NEED_LIBS and used on other oses).
