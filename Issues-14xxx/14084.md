```
The construction functor for fraction fields pretends that it takes any ring as input:

```
sage: Fract,R = QQ.construction()
sage: Fract.domain()
Category of rings
sage: Fract.codomain()
Category of fields
```

But of course that's wrong:

```
sage: Fract(ZZ.quo(15))
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: self must be an integral domain.
```

Hence, it would be better to declare right away that its domain is the category of integral domains.

No, this is very important for making the test `k in Fields()` fast without caching.

No. It is just "learning more and more about immutable properties of the parent".

Sure. It could always be that the reported category is a subcategory of what one wants to have. `R in C` is recommended, but `R.category() is C` is not.

I think this is currently not supported.

The above is in fact alright because Fields is a full subcategory of
Rings. So by going from one to the other, one don't change the
structure under consideration. One is just learning more properties of
this structure.

I certainly agree that I would not want the category of my parent to
change from Vector Space to Ring, because then I am adding a new
structure (the multiplication).

Full subcategories are not yet modeled in Sage, but this is in the
plans, because that's what we want to go further with homsets.

At first glance, changing the categories of Zp(p) and Qp(p) seems not totally easy, simply because the code base is formed by a lot of slightly differently sounding base classes. But, as it says in sage.rings.padic.local_generic:

```
Local Generic

Superclass for `p`-adic and power series rings.
```

So, if we are lucky, both Zp, Qp and power series rings can be fixed at the same time.

```
        self.Element = element_class
        Parent.__init__(self, base, names=(names,), normalize=False, category=getattr(self,'_default_category',None))

For the most part I probably agree with that. However, how does this relate to additional concepts such as "finitely generated"?

The following is probably not entirely kosher in terms of mathematical categories, but it may affect the colloquial use of them in computer algebra:

The Gaussian field `QQ(i)` would generally be considered a finitely generated field, but as a ring it would not be finitely generated (no characteristic 0 field is). Of course one should specify over what object they are finitely generated, and the discrepancy comes from the different default choices for fields and rings: The prime fields `QQ` and `GF(p)` for fields versus `ZZ` for commutative rings.

I would love to see that we can use the "category" field as a dynamic attribute as suggested, because it does make these `is_field` tests wonderfully fast without requiring complicated additional caching. But I am concerned that phenomena (or misconceptions) as above might come back and bite us if we're coming to depend on such tricks extensively. Can you ease that concern?

Implementing the category can result in a slow-down in the creation of parents. Let's see what happens here. Without the patch:

```
sage: %time L = [Zp(p) for p in prime_range(2,10^4)]
CPU times: user 2.00 s, sys: 0.09 s, total: 2.09 s
Wall time: 2.09 s

With the patch:

CPU times: user 2.10 s, sys: 0.05 s, total: 2.15 s
Wall time: 2.15 s
```

I hope that's acceptable.

I guess you pointed the key fact above: one can have some shortcuts
for the users convenience, but for a robust answer one should always
specify for which category the thing is finitely generated. For the
same reason .gens should only be a shortcut. For robust results, one
should always specify the category. Which is my motivation for
promoting the use of semigroup_generators / monoid_generators /
algebra_generators / ...  Luckily, in some cases we have nice names
(finite dimensional, basis,...) for those.

> For robust results, one should always specify the category.

But that's the issue: The category *is* specified:

Hypothetical dialogue (I'm sorry it has to be this academic--I don't presently have an actual example).

```
sage: QQ.category()
Category of Commutative Rings
sage: QQ.is_finitely_generated()
False
```
Sage confirms that at this point, it's considering `QQ` as a commutative ring and as such is not finitely generated.

```
sage: QQ in Fields()
True
sage: QQ.category()
Category of Fields
sage: QQ.is_finitely_generated()
True
```
Since the category here is `Fields` the question about finite generation should be considered there. Since it's a prime field I don't see how any other answer than `True` could be considered there.

This suggests to me that the concept of finite generation is not well-behaved w.r.t. restricting to *full subcategories*. I don't think that disqualifies it as a reasonable thing to ask. Instead, it suggests to me that it's not safe to implicitly change categories to full subcategories, since that change can affect what the answers to certain perfectly reasonable questions are.

It's important to keep in mind that by insisting on unique parents, sage is deviating from what most computer algebra systems choose to do. It makes the immutability of parents extremely important, because mutations can have extremely non-local consequences. Hence, every time immutability is violated one has to argue extremely carefully that the effect is immaterial. Changing categories sounds like a very dangerous thing to me.

Normally I'm not a fan of discussions about hypothetical code. However, here I think this issue is worth serious thinking because we're touching on fundamental infrastructure in sage:

The parent you get back when you ask for its construction can either be a fresh one, or one that is already referenced somewhere, or one that was already deleted but not yet found by the garbage collector (perhaps because it got trapped in a permanent cache somewhere), depending on what happened before.

I think we really need another way to cache whether a ring is a field then. What you describe is indeed the case:

```
sage: R=ZZ.quo(7)
sage: R in IntegralDomains() ##1
False
sage: R in Fields()
True
sage: R in IntegralDomains() ##2
True
```
you can see that the call `R in Fields()` has mutated the parent in an essential way. The kind of call that people HAVE to use to look at the category field because it is not trustworthy by itself even can change depending on what happens with the parent elsewhere!

Whether `##1` is a bug or not depends on how you interpret the question: Are we asking the mathematical truth (which in general might be undecidable) or are we asking what sage knows about the object by construction? The first would of course be nicer, but computer algebra systems often settle for the second.

The important thing here is to illustrate how easy it is to mutate parents in a significant way if you start mucking with their category.

Personally I think it's fine if `ZZ.quo(7)` doesn't advertise itself as a `field by construction`. People can ask for `GF(7)` instead, which luckily does give back a non-identical parent:

```
sage: R=ZZ.quo(7)
sage: R2=GF(7)
sage: id(R)
85206256
sage: id(R2)
17095856
```
By the way:

```
sage: R.category()
Join of Category of commutative rings and Category of subquotients of monoids and Category of quotients of semigroups and Category of finite enumerated sets
sage: R2.category()
Join of Category of subquotients of monoids and Category of quotients of semigroups and Category of finite fields
```
I have to say those values do a good job of dissuading people from ever looking at them!

Also, this discussion is not of direct relevance to this ticket, so perhaps we should take the discussion to sage-devel instead.

Another instance of a weak cache perhaps? But if I recall correctly, I played with weak caches of the "is_Field" function -- and the speed was not competitive.

Also note that changing the category of the ring has indirect advantages: There may be more parent and element methods become available when passing to a sub-category.

I would say the change of category is allowed when one could have chosen that category during initialisation, and if the only reason for *not* doing so during initialisation is efficiency: I have seen applications involving matrix spaces, for which it really did not matter whether the matrix space is a vector space or an algebra or just a set -- I just don't remember the ticket number. Hence, in these applications, one would *postpone* the initialisation of the category of a matrix space, and only do it when necessary.

And in the case of ring versus field, I could imagine that there are examples in which one just needs to know that a given parent is a ring. In these applications, it would be a waste of time to determine during creation of the parent whether it actually is a field or not (which may involve primality tests). Hence, for efficiency, one should postpone the test of "being a field" until it is really needed.

> Also, this discussion is not of direct relevance to this ticket, so perhaps we should take the discussion to sage-devel instead.

+1.

The "change of category" has not been introduced here, and not in #13370 either. In fact, in the good old times, it was possible to have `P in Fields()` and `P not in IntegralDomains()`. Hence, I think of the refinement of categories as a progress.

I therefore suggest to use a new ticket, if someone finds a more satisfying solution of the "speed versus immutability problem".

Sorry, I have been ambiguous. What I mean is that, for the answer to
be well defined, one should specify the category at the time one asks
whether the object is finitely generated. Something like:

```
     sage: Q.is_finitely_generated(Fields())
```
or

```
     sage: Q.is_finitely_generated_field()
```

Then,

```
     sage: Q.is_finitely_generated()
```
would return the answer for the current category of Q; but that's just
a lousy syntactic sugar, for the user convenience, when there is no
ambiguity.

> This suggests to me that the concept of finite generation is not

It's just not well defined if you don't specify explicitly for which
category you are asking the question.

The first would of course be nicer, but computer algebra systems often settle for the second.

By design, the category of an object in Sage describes:

(a) It's "operations" (additive structure, multiplicative
structure). This conditions what the morphisms are in the category.

(b) The properties of the operations that Sage is aware of at this
    point in time (either because they were specified by the user or
    discovered during some computation).

Note that the distinction between (a) and (b) will be made clearer
with the upcoming functorial construction patch #10963 which
introduces an infrastructure for "axioms" for (b).

I totally agree that (a) should not change over the lifetime of an
object. But I consider it a very important feature that (b) can change
over time: when we discover new properties of an object, we want to
exploit them to use better algorithms. And we might as well have every
reference to that object in the current Sage session benefit from the
improvement.

Of course, for that to make sense, changing (b) should only influence
efficiency, and not change the *semantic* of questions; for that the
questions should be unambiguous.

Note that GAP is doing (b) intensively for precisely that reason
(although they use a different mechanism, through method selection
rather than object orientation).

Working on that :-) With my current functorial patch, this should be
roughly "Category of finite commutative quotient fields."

> Simon, in `local_generic.py` you add a category parameter but seem to ignore it. Was that intended?

No. Originally I thought of a different way to initialise stuff, because I thought that `LocalGeneric` is the base class of *both* power series rings and p-adic rings. So, I expected that the sub-classes would eventually like to pass a `category` to the init method of `LocalGeneric`.

But since it is only used for p-adic rings, it isn't needed.

The questions remain:

- *Should* power series inherit from `LocalGeneric`? This would be for a different ticket.
- Since power series do not inherit from `LocalGeneric`, shouldn't the documentation of local_generic.py be corrected accordingly?

Anyway. I have updated the patch.
