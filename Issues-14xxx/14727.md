`module_list.py` contains manual dependencies. for example

```python
    depends = [SAGE_INC + '/ecl/ecl.h']
```

this will not work reliably if ecl is somewhere else.

it looks like dependencies are not tracked automatically. if that is the case, the build system is severely incomplete.

I think you'll find this throughout all of the Sage build system (in spkgs, etc.) is that certain dependencies' locations are hard-coded.
