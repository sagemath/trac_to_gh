The attached file provides doctests for examples in the chapter on Python/Sage programming. See #9395 for some background.

Though I prepared the patch, the main authors of the tests are Alexandre Casamayou and François Maltey.

All tests pass with Sage 5.9β0 on my machine.

Hello,

1) Strangely enough, in the patchbot log

```
**********************************************************************
File "/data/patchbot/sage-5.9/devel/sage/sage/symbolic/constants.py", line 203, in sage.symbolic.constants
Failed example:
    maxima('infinity').sage()
Expected:
    Infinity
Got:
    Maxima crashed -- automatically restarting.
    Infinity
**********************************************************************
```

2) The doctest framework for multiline statement has changed. You should replace

```
sage: for i in truc:
...     print bidule
```
by

```
sage: for i in truc
....:     print bidule
```

3) I do not understand why patchbot complains about non ascii characters...

Do you have any idea about 1) ?

patch modified to take into account the output ordering change due to #9880.
Works fine with Sage 5.11. Ready for review. See also #10983 and #14340.
I left `...` instead of `....:` since it works with the current doctest framework
(it would be better to do a global change for that).

I don't really understand this. You are strongly encouraged to use `....:` because it is what you get in the Sage interactive shell, it is like that in the book and because it makes the doctest examples line up better. I see absolutely no reason to add *new* doctests using the old `...` syntax.

Jeroen, ok I will change this, but since I spent about 4 hours today in updating or creating new doctests, I'd like to find a easy way.

I assume if I simply replace `...` by `....:` in the patch it won't work?
