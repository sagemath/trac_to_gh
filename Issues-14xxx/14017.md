```
In the following simple example, sage_getargspec does not correctly determine the arguments of a python function:

```
sage: cython("""
....: def f_cy(*args,**kwds):
....:     pass
....: """)
sage: sage_getargspec(f_cy)
ArgSpec(args=['*args', '**kwds'], varargs=None, keywords=None, defaults=None)
```
Writing the same in Python, one gets

```
sage: def f_py(*args,**kwds):
....:     pass
....: 
sage: sage_getargspec(f_py)
ArgSpec(args=[], varargs='args', keywords='kwds', defaults=None)
```

This bug is what currently prevents as to put `UniqueRepresentation` into a cython file.

Here is our problem:

```
sage: obj = UniqueRepresentation.__classcall__.f
sage: from sage.misc.sageinspect import sage_getsource, _sage_getargspec_from_ast, _sage_getargspec_cython
sage: source = sage_getsource(obj, is_binary=True)
sage: _sage_getargspec_cython(source)   # wrong
(['cls', '*args', '**options'], None, None, None)
sage: _sage_getargspec_from_ast(source) # correct
ArgSpec(args=['cls'], varargs='args', keywords='options', defaults=None)
```

Perhaps `_sage_getargspec_cython` (which is called if it is suspected that the function is defined in Cython) should first check whether `_sage_getargspec_from_ast` works.

Actually a part of the current doctests expect wrong answers:

```
        sage: from sage.misc.sageinspect import _sage_getargspec_cython as sgc

# That is ok:
        sage: sgc("cpdef double abc(self, x=None, base=0):")
        (['self', 'x', 'base'], None, None, (None, 0))
        sage: sgc("def __init__(self, x=None, unsigned int base=0):")
        (['self', 'x', 'base'], None, None, (None, 0))

# The following is wrong, and is the main reason why we couldnt' simply
# put UniqueRepresentation into a Cython file to make it faster:
        sage: sgc('def o(p, *q, r={}, **s) except? -1:')
        (['p', '*q', 'r', '**s'], None, None, ({},))

# That is ok:
        sage: sgc('cpdef how(r=(None, "u:doing?")):')
        (['r'], None, None, ((None, 'u:doing?'),))
        sage: sgc('def _(x="):"):')
        (['x'], None, None, ('):',))
        sage: sgc('def f(z = {(1,2,3): True}):\n    return z')
        (['z'], None, None, ({(1, 2, 3): True},))

# The following gives a valid function definition in a cython file,
# hence, there must be no error when determining the argspec
        sage: sgc('def f(double x, z = {(1,2,3): True}):\n    return z')
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        ValueError: Could not parse cython argspec
```

Last night I have coded something which I think is a finite state automaton that correctly parses any argspec, provided that the given input is valid in Cython. Hence, I do not claim that my code would detect all possible syntax errors; but if there is no syntax error, then the output should be the correct argspec.

In the above doctests, my code would give the correct results. But I need some more tests at this point, and also I am not sure whether I should try to detect some more syntactical problems.

For example, I currently have the reasonable answer

```
sage: sgc('def o(int * bla p, *q, r={}, **s) except? -1:')
(['p', 'r'], 'q', 's', ['{}'])
```
(here, `int * bla` is thought of as a type definition in Cython, which is of course wrong but doesn't matter), but I also get something that could easily be avoided:

```
sage: sgc('def o(int * bla p, *q, r={}, , **s) except? -1:')
(['p', 'r', 's'], 'q', None, ['{}'])
```
(here, `, **` is thought of as a type definition in Cython, but of course it would be straight forward to recognise that there is one illegal comma inserted).

I just realise that there is one more wrong expected result in the current doctests:

```
        sage: sgc('def _(x="):"):')
        (['x'], None, None, ('):',))
```

The function specification states that the string representation of the default values is returned. But of course `'):'` is not the string representation of `"):"`. Instead, we should have

```
sage: sgc('def _(x="):"):')
(['x'], None, None, ['"):"'])
```
and this is actually done by my experimental code.

```
sage:  sage_getargspec(P.__init__)
ArgSpec(args=['self', 'base_ring', 'n', 'names', 'order'], varargs=None, keywords=None, defaults=("'degrevlex'",))
```
and thus the expected answer looks suspicious to me.

Here is another example I am currently not happy with:

```
sage: cython("""
def test():
    return 1

"""
)
sage: sage_getargspec(f)
ArgSpec(args=['x', 'y'], varargs=None, keywords='kwds', defaults=({None: 2},))
```
Hence, the default for 'y' is given as `{None: 2}`, but in fact it should be `{1: 2}`.

As much as I know, Cython does not make the default values available via attributes of a function, unlike Python. And even if one would try to find the actual value by evaluating the string `'{test():2}'` in the module's name space, things could go terribly wrong.

Is someone reading this? How should we proceed in this situation?

I need a few questions answered before I can have a reasonable answer:

1. When are the argspec functions called, during compile, and roughly by what?
2. Would this be caught as an error by the cython compiler (or any other bad syntax for that matter)?
3. Would `_sage_getargspec_from_ast` would parse it correctly?

As a general design note, I would think all `sage_getargspec*` functions should return the same data in the same format (in regard to [your comment here](#comment%3A5)).

As for the patch, two quick things. Is there any reason to have that large commented out code block? Also I believe we should try to be python 3 compliant as much as possible, so the exceptions should be `raise ExceptionType("msg")`.

Thank you,

Travis

{
    "body": "<a id='comment:9'></a>\nHi Travis,\n\nReplying to [tscrim](#comment%3A8):\n> 1. When are the argspec functions called, during compile, and roughly by what?\n\n\nThe argspec functions have of course nothing to do with compilation. Their main use cases seem to be:\n\n* Creation of the docs. If you look into the Sage reference, you will see that any function or method shows its arguments. I think the documentation would not change with my patch, because from the point of view of documentation, it simply does not matter whether the method\n\n  ```\n    def foo(self, int n, *args):\n        ...\n  ```\n  has an argument name `*args` (including the `*`!!) or has varargs named `args` (ecluding the `*`).\n* Decorators. The reason for creating this patch is the cached_method decorator. Let foodec be obtained by applying the cached_method decorator to a method foo. When calling foodec, it is needed to determine the names of the arguments of foo, *including* varargs and keywords. This is done only once, of course.\n\n> 2. Would this be caught as an error by the cython compiler (or any other bad syntax for that matter)?\n\n\nWhat would be caught as an error? It really seems you are confusing some things. The compiler did its work already. sage_getargspec (or inspect.getargspec) is called on functions or methods. In the case of Python functions, inspect.getargspec can determine the arguments of a function by certain attributes that the function provides.\n\nBut in the case of a Cython function (def or cpdef), these attributes do not exist.

Hi Travis,

Replying to [tscrim](#comment%3A8):
> 1. When are the argspec functions called, during compile, and roughly by what?


The argspec functions have of course nothing to do with compilation. Their main use cases seem to be:

* Creation of the docs. If you look into the Sage reference, you will see that any function or method shows its arguments. I think the documentation would not change with my patch, because from the point of view of documentation, it simply does not matter whether the method

  ```
    def foo(self, int n, *args):
        ...
  ```
  has an argument name `*args` (including the `*`!!) or has varargs named `args` (ecluding the `*`).
* Decorators. The reason for creating this patch is the cached_method decorator. Let foodec be obtained by applying the cached_method decorator to a method foo. When calling foodec, it is needed to determine the names of the arguments of foo, *including* varargs and keywords. This is done only once, of course.

> 2. Would this be caught as an error by the cython compiler (or any other bad syntax for that matter)?


What would be caught as an error? It really seems you are confusing some things. The compiler did its work already. sage_getargspec (or inspect.getargspec) is called on functions or methods. In the case of Python functions, inspect.getargspec can determine the arguments of a function by certain attributes that the function provides.

But in the case of a Cython function (def or cpdef), these attributes do not exist. Hence, sage_getargspec will try to find the source code (via sage_getsource) and determine the argument list from the source.

Before my patch, the parsing process used to fail on typical function definitions in Cython -- as shown in the ticket description. With my patch, the arguments are correctly determined from the source code.

Relation with the compiler:

Let s be a string, which is some code supposed to define a function.

If `_sage_getargspec_cython(s)` raises a syntax error, then Cython is supposed to refuse compilation of s. Hence, `_sage_getargspec_cython(s)` will *never* raise an error on the source code of a successfully compiled function (otherwise it would be a bug).

> 3. Would `_sage_getargspec_from_ast` would parse it correctly?


Cython code can look like `"def foo(b, int a=1, *args)"`. `_sage_getargspec_from_ast` would not know what to do with that string. As I have explained in some post above, the new `_sage_getargspec_cython` will strip the type definitions; hence, it would first transform it into `"def dummy(b,a=1,*args)"` and then call `_sage_getargspec_from_ast`.

> As a general design note, I would think all `sage_getargspec*` functions should return the same data in the same format (in regard to [your comment here](#comment%3A5)).


That's what my patch does.

> As for the patch, two quick things. Is there any reason to have that large commented out code block? 


Oops, sorry, I'll remove that block and will submit a new patch after dinner.

> Also I believe we should try to be python 3 compliant as much as possible, so the exceptions should be `raise ExceptionType("msg")`.



Never heard of that rule. Could you ask on sage-devel whether this rule should be encouraged?

So it's not a requirement to actually check bad syntax, but only needs to guarantee that it will parse correct syntax. Correct?

Sorry I was unclear; I was thinking of if the function was in python:

```
sage: def test(): return 1
....: 
sage: def f(x,y={test():2},**kwds): pass
....: 
sage: sage_getargspec(f)
ArgSpec(args=['x', 'y'], varargs=None, keywords='kwds', defaults=({1: 2},))
```

I think I'm now starting I understand what the issue is. However I don't see how evaluating the default argument string in the modules namespace could cause an issue unless the user directly calls `_sage_getargspec_cython()` as you are in the tests. (I guess there is also some difficulty in parsing out functions `foo(args)` and replacing it with `module.foo(args)`...)

Here's the topic: https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/sage-devel/P35X-WjDuK4

Thank you for clarifying things and answering all of my (crazy/misguided) questions,

Travis

Edit - The reason for the drop in coverage is because `sage -coverage` doesn't correctly parse that the functions in the doctests are not "real" functions.

That's indeed tricky.

This example does work for Python functions, because inspect.getargspec can read off the default values from some attribute of the function -- hence, reading source code is not involved for Python.

But if you put the same definition in a .pyx file, then inspect.getargspec does not work, unless one compiles everything with the "binding" option (which is probably bad for performance). Hence, source code parsing probably is the only way to find the arguments. But as soon as you use external functions to define default values, source code parsing must fail sooner or later.

In this example, `_sage_getargspec_from_ast` (and thus `_sage_getargspec_cython`)  would return `{None: 2}` and not `{1: 2}` as default value.

I see no safe way to overcome this limitation. But note that knowing the correct default values is less critical than knowing the argument names. The bug that made me create this ticket was: Currently the argument names are not correctly determined, in some situations.

No, in examples of that kind, source code parsing *must* fail at some point. Two examples:

OK, let's see what is happening.

```
sage: from sage.misc.sageinspect import sage_getsource, sage_getargspec
sage: from sage.algebras.letterplace.free_algebra_element_letterplace import poly_reduce
sage: source = sage_getsource(poly_reduce.__call__)
sage: print source
    def __call__(self, *args, ring=None, bint interruptible=True, attributes=None):
...
```

This actually looks fine, and rather easy to parse.

But in fact, `_sage_getargspec_from_ast` is to blame, it seems:

```
sage: from sage.misc.sageinspect import _sage_getargspec_cython, _sage_getargspec_from_ast
sage: _sage_getargspec_from_ast("def __call__(self, *args, ring,  interruptible, attributes):")
------------------------------------------------------------
   File "<unknown>", line 1
     def __call__(self, *args, ring,  interruptible, attributes):
                                  ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```

Aha!!! That's very interesting!! Apparently Cython accepts this argument definition, but it is indeed a syntax error in Python!

```
sage: def dummy(self,*args,ring=None,interruptible=True,attributes=None): pass
------------------------------------------------------------
   File "<ipython console>", line 1
     def dummy(self,*args,ring=None,interruptible=True,attributes=None): pass
                             ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
sage: def dummy(self,ring=None,interruptible=True,attributes=None, *args): pass
....: 
sage:
```

So, what can one do? I could try to let `_sage_getargspec_cython` determine the varargs and keywords name, and put them to the very end of the argument list. The list of arguments/argspec would not change, but it would be correct syntax in Python.

Sounds reasonable.

Alternatively, actually change

```
def __call__(self, *args, ring=None, bint interruptible=True, attributes=None)
```
to the Python-compatible

```
def __call__(self, ring=None, bint interruptible=True, attributes=None, *args)
```

But similar syntax occurs all over the place. I think that should be done on a separate ticket, if people think it is a problem.

Needs review, including a look at the outcome of the documentation as mentioned in [comment:14](#comment%3A14).

Here is the outcome of building the reference guide from scratch, with the new patch:

```
/home/simon/SAGE/debug/sage-5.6.rc0/devel/sage/doc/en/reference/sage/numerical/backends/generic_backend.rst:11: WARNING: error while formatting signature for sage.numerical.backends.generic_backend.GenericBackend.problem_name: Pointer types not allowed in def or cpdef functions

```

So, in most cases, there is complaint about a '*' being inside of the type definition, making it a pointer type. Let's have a look:

```
cpdef problem_name(self, char * name = NULL)
```
Arrgh. I thought *no* pointer was allowed, but `char*` is an exception.

Since the only requirement is that sage_getargspec correctly parses correct syntax, a potential solution is to simply accept a "pointed" type definition, whether it is legal or not.

The last problem is different:

```
def mod_mon_set(BooleSet as, BooleSet vs):
```
`as` is a reserved name in Python -- so, it is hard to believe that Cython accepts it as a variable name!

But in this case, I suggest to simply change the name in pbori.pyx, rather than trying to make _sage_getargspec_cython swallow it.

I'll do the two changes tomorrow.
