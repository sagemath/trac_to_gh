There are a fair number of places that does stuff with the directory `SAGE_ROOT/spkg/installed`, so let's add an environment variable for this directory. This will help ease the transition to git.

**Installation Instructions**:
* apply [attachment:trac14226_library.patch] to the sage library
* apply [attachment:trac14226_root.patch] and [attachment:14226_root_review.patch] to the root repository
* apply [attachment:trac14226_scripts.patch] to the scripts repository

Maybe, but at the same time it makes it a lot easier to find offending cases if we do move to a pair of functions like you propose, so at the very least this would be a step in the right direction.

There are also instances in the Sage scripts repository (`$SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/`) which have to get fixed, e.g. in
`sage-update`:

```python
    installed = set(os.listdir(os.path.join(SPKG_ROOT, "installed")))
```

Same in `sage-list-packages`:

```python
try:
     installed = set(os.listdir(os.path.join(SPKG_ROOT, 'installed')))
except OSError:
     installed = set([])
```

There are presumably even more, but simple grepping yields false positives as well; I've found:

```
local/bin/sage-bdist:   cp $CP_OPT installed "$TMP/$PKGDIR/"

local/bin/sage-list-packages:     installed = set(os.listdir(os.path.join(SPKG_ROOT, 'installed')))

local/bin/sage-make_devel_packages:SPKG_INST="$SAGE_ROOT"/spkg/installed/

local/bin/sage-update:    installed = set(os.listdir(os.path.join(SPKG_ROOT, "installed")))
```

Looking at those, isn't `SPKG_INST` (or `SAGE_SPKG_INST`) a better name? ;-)

I meant just in the `Makefile`.  (`$SAGE_SPKG_INST` could still be absolute.)

> The problem with a relative path is that then there are issues if using `$SAGE_SPKG_INST` from some other directory (which can and does happen)


See above.

> `sage-make_relative` isn't available upon the first usage of `deps`.


I was just kidding.

> Making a symbolic link would work in the case that `$(INST) != $SAGE_SPKG_INST`.


Well, just change `INST = installed` to something else (`INST = this_is_always_the_relative_path_to_a_symlink`), and let it point to either `installed` or `$SAGE_SPKG_INST` (where the latter is absolute).  Not sure about performance issues.
