There are a fair number of places that does stuff with the directory `SAGE_ROOT/spkg/installed`, so let's add an environment variable for this directory. This will help ease the transition to git.

**Installation Instructions**:
* apply [attachment: trac14226_library.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket14226/trac14226_library.patch.gz) to the sage library
* apply [attachment: trac14226_root.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket14226/trac14226_root.patch.gz) and [attachment: 14226_root_review.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket14226/14226_root_review.patch.gz) to the root repository
* apply [attachment: trac14226_scripts.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket14226/trac14226_scripts.patch.gz) to the scripts repository

And although this variable is (or should be) only used internally, we should document it (with a warning that it doesn't refer to the location of a Sage **inst**allation, nor should be set/modified by the user).

There are also instances in the Sage scripts repository (`$SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/`) which have to get fixed, e.g. in
`sage-update`:

```python
    installed = set(os.listdir(os.path.join(SPKG_ROOT, "installed")))
```

Same in `sage-list-packages`:

```python
try:
     installed = set(os.listdir(os.path.join(SPKG_ROOT, 'installed')))
except OSError:
     installed = set([])
```

There are presumably even more, but simple grepping yields false positives as well; I've found:

```
local/bin/sage-bdist:   cp $CP_OPT installed "$TMP/$PKGDIR/"

local/bin/sage-list-packages:     installed = set(os.listdir(os.path.join(SPKG_ROOT, 'installed')))

local/bin/sage-make_devel_packages:SPKG_INST="$SAGE_ROOT"/spkg/installed/

local/bin/sage-update:    installed = set(os.listdir(os.path.join(SPKG_ROOT, "installed")))
```

Looking at those, isn't `SPKG_INST` (or `SAGE_SPKG_INST`) a better name? ;-)

So my only objection to `SPKG_INST` is that it follows the convention of `SPKG_ROOT` which has been replaced with `SAGE_PACKAGES`, so it seems like a slight regression.

On the other hand, `SPKG_INST` makes sense in the context of trying to move to a real package manager, and that this directory only records the installations of spkgs (as opposed to packages installed with other methods). From this perspective, I agree that `SPKG_INST` would be a better name (enough to outweigh my objection).

Or, how does `make INST="${SAGE_SPKG_INST:-installed}"` behave?  (I think this would be better.)

I meant just in the `Makefile`.  (`$SAGE_SPKG_INST` could still be absolute.)

> The problem with a relative path is that then there are issues if using `$SAGE_SPKG_INST` from some other directory (which can and does happen)

See above.

> `sage-make_relative` isn't available upon the first usage of `deps`.

I was just kidding.

> Making a symbolic link would work in the case that `$(INST) != $SAGE_SPKG_INST`.

Well, just change `INST = installed` to something else (`INST = this_is_always_the_relative_path_to_a_symlink`), and let it point to either `installed` or `$SAGE_SPKG_INST` (where the latter is absolute).  Not sure about performance issues.

After deep thinking...

```sh
make INST="`echo ${SAGE_SPKG_INST:-installed} | sed 's/ /\\\\ /g'`"
```

I think this should solve all issues.

I'd keep the "default" value of `INST` in `deps`.

Also, I think there's more than one instance of `$MAKE` in `spkg/install`, not sure whether also elsewhere.
