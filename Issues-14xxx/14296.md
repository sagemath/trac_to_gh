Sometimes, a system-wide GCC can be configured to use a different linker than simply `ld` (using `configure --with-ld=/path/to/linker`). The path to the linker used by GCC can be discovered by

```
buildbot@mark:~$ gcc -print-file-name=ld
/usr/local/binutils-2.22/sparc-SunOS-ultrasparc3-gcc-4.6.2-without-zlib/bin/ld
```

Unfortunately, there can be an inconsistency between `$LD` and the linker used by GCC, leading to build failures. We should do the following:
1. If `$LD` is unset, set it to `$CC -print-file-name=ld` by default instead of `ld`.
2. If `$LD` is set and the value differs from `$CC -print-file-name=ld`, force building of the GCC spkg (define these values to be equal if the output of `command -v VALUE` is equal).

Take care to support the case that `$CC` doesn't support the `-print-file-name` option.

Analogously, the same for the assembler `$AS`.

This affects only a few spkgs.  IMHO we should fix these, by changing their `spkg-install` scripts, or -- much better -- patching the upstream sources and reporting the fixes upstream.

Agreed.

That's a bit overkill.  Ok for a buildbot, but otherwise we should just issue a warning (or, more complicated, error  out unless some override setting is active).

Is it really a bug? I'd say that configuring GCC to use a different linker from `$LD` is an user configuration error...

Thinking more about that, it's probably too surprising (not respecting `PATH`), at least we shouldn't do that silently (if `which ld` differs from what GCC returns, unless GCC returns just `ld`, i.e., no absolute path).

Given that many (most?) packages actually link with `$CC` and therefore use the ld configured in `$CC`, I don't see the problem.

Well, if all spkgs used `$CC`, `$CXX` or `$FC` etc. for linking, there wouldn't be a problem (modulo generating linker scripts for the wrong, i.e., not "GCC's" linker), so setting `LD` would be pretty pointless.

In `sage-env`, `stdout` of `command -v ...` should also be redirected to `/dev/null`.

Replying to [@jdemeyer](#comment:10):
> leif, would you agree with keeping the changes to `sage-env` in [attachment: 14296_ld_as.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket14296/14296_ld_as.patch.gz)

This should be ok, although a user might still intentionally have a different `ld` or `as` first in his/her `PATH`.  (Then we'd have to document that setting `AS` and/or `LD` might be necessary to get the previous behaviour.)
  
> but changing the detection in `spkg/install` to an error if the values of as or ld don't match (where there would never be an error if we're building GCC, since the newly-built GCC would use the setting of `$LD` as default linker).

Hmmm.  It should be possible to override the error (probably by setting `SAGE_PORT`).

There are some subtle issues with the comparisons, not sure how artificial the following scenarios are:

* `AS` and/or `LD` are set to (e.g.) `as -foo` or `ld -foo`, respectively (likewise `/path/to/as -foo` etc.).
   Then e.g. `command -v "$AS"` gives an error (whilst `command -v $AS` probably doesn't.)
* `AS` and/or `LD` are set to something like `as-2.22`, while (e.g.) GCC was configured with something else.
* Opposite of the previous:  GCC was configured to (e.g.) use `as-2.22` (or `/path/to/as`, or `/path/to/as-2.22`), while e.g. `AS` is meanwhile just `as`, `as-2.23`, or `/other/path/to/as` etc. 
* Probably more weirdnesses.

Filename mismatches don't necessarily mean that the programs are different, or incompatible.

I don't think one couldn't work around the above situations by changing the setup, but this might be difficult for "ordinary" users, especially those without admin rights.

How does this fit your "If a user sets $VAR, assume he/she knows what he/she's doing, so don't override it; he/she doesn't need a nanny."? ;-)

Now looks ok (and reasonable) to me.

In case users report trouble, we can always "fine-tune" the behaviour later.

Still, the documentation (on env vars, in the Installation Guide IIRC) should get updated accordingly.

Minor issue:  In the messages, I wouldn't use `\$PROG` but `PROG`, since the former refers to the value of a variable rather than to the variable itself.

Will (have to) test this later<sup>TM</sup>...
