Write a doctest for the following:

```
sage: from sympy import Function, Symbol
sage: u = Function('u')
sage: n = Symbol('n', integer=True)
sage: from sympy import rsolve
sage: f = u(n+2) - u(n+1) + u(n)/4
sage: rsolve(f,u(n))
2**(-n)*(C0 + C1*n)
```
This was the original description:

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage: from sympy import Function, Symbol
sage: u = Function('u')
sage: n = Symbol('n', integer=True)
sage: from sympy import rsolve
sage: f = u(n+2) - u(n+1) + u(n)/4
sage: rsolve(f,u(n))
2**(-n)*C0*RisingFactorial(C0/C1 + 1, n)/RisingFactorial(C0/C1, n)
```
Since Sage does not know about `RisingFactorial`, this answer is not very useful...
| Sage Version 5.8, Release Date: 2013-03-15                         |

| Type "help()" for help.                                            |
Moreover:

```
sage: rsolve(f,u(n),{u(0):0,u(1):1})
sage:
```
The solution is (computed by Maple 15) `1/4*(8*n+8)*(1/2)<sup>n-2*(1/2)</sup>n`.

<a id='comment:1'></a>This is a pure Sympy question.

```

In [1]: import sympy

In [3]: u = sympy.Function('u')

In [5]: n = sympy.Symbol('n',integer=True)

In [6]: f = u(n+2) - u(n+1) + u(n)/4

In [7]: sympy.rsolve(f,u(n))
Out[7]: 2**(-n)*C0*RisingFactorial(C0/C1 + 1, n)/RisingFactorial(C0/C1, n)

In [8]: sympy.rsolve(f,u(n),{u(0):0,u(1):1})
In [9]:
```
I guess you could report it [upstream](http://code.google.com/p/sympy/issues/list) and we could verify a fix here eventually.

Second, the object you did is a Sympy object, so you would want to translate it to Sage first.

```
sage: sage: rsolve(f,u(n))
2**(-n)*C0*RisingFactorial(C0/C1 + 1, n)/RisingFactorial(C0/C1, n)
sage: _._sage_()
AttributeError: 'RisingFactorial' object has no attribute '_sage_'
```
But separately, it would be nice, true, to have a good translation of RisingFactorial.  I suggest you split this up into two different tickets, if that's okay, as the issues are quite different.

Let's keep this ticket to keep track of the SymPy issue (I have no google account, and don't want to have one, thus it seems I cannot report the problem to the SymPy developers...)

Short answer: we do this for other systems (e.g. Maxima, Pari) on occasion.  

Long answer: One of the nice things about Sage is that you can use those in Sage and it 'just works'.  For instance, one might have a computation that can really only be done inside Maxima or R (perhaps because we haven't wrapped functionality x or y), but then the final result is usable in Sage.  It's good to indicate this.  Also, often our doctests are slightly different or tested on different kinds of platforms.  It's not a bad thing to duplicate *some* of this - I agree that it's not reasonable to completely redo doctests, though of course `SAGE_CHECK` can provide some of that functionality.

That doesn't provide a 100% compelling argument, I agree - maybe 85% compelling, to me.  But it isn't really a big problem - if you prefer not to take the time to do that, which I totally understand (notice I haven't either!) then just leave it for someone who is practicing and learning how to develop  for Sage - marking as 'beginner'.
