I propose to implement another algorithm, which seems to be slightly faster than the existing implementation, at the cost of being defined on antichains instead of order ideals.

```
sage: P = Posets.ChainPoset(5)  
sage: Q = P.product(P)          
sage: R1 = Q.order_ideals_lattice();R1
Finite lattice containing 252 elements
sage: R2 = Q.order_ideals_lattice(as_ideals=False);R2
Finite lattice containing 252 elements
sage: R1.is_isomorphic(R2)
True
sage: timeit('Q.order_ideals_lattice()')
5 loops, best of 3: 5.25 s per loop
sage: timeit('Q.order_ideals_lattice(as_ideals=False)')                 
5 loops, best of 3: 3.45 s per loop
```
