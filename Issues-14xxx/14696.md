Gloops.... The mistake is just in the doc, not in the code ! The function `designs.steiner_quadruple_system` checks that the system exist for all integers n equal to 2 or 4 mod 6 `^^;`

More work for you: the file is littered with stuff written like `2,4 [12]`. I think it should be written as `2,4 \mod 12` since it is going to be rendered in latex. I haven't seen this notation `a [b]` to denote `a mod b` before.

I've seen that with round brackets, usually the mod is spelled out as `a \equiv b (mod c)` but sometimes people abbreviate it to `a \equiv b (c)`. Maybe square brackets are a French thing?

Patch updated !

I went into Florent's office and asked him if he had ever used this bracket notation, and he told me that he rarely if ever used it. That he mostly saw `\pmod` everywhere.

And I am almost sure that I never wrote "mod" of my whole life, and always used these brackets.. In lectures, in exams, everywhere `:-P`

Soooooooooooooo maybe I'm mad, but I still updated the patch. I also renamed an "height" into a "eight", because I am an idiot.

Turns out that this review was more complicated than expected `:-D`

One typo: the first mod should be `\pmod`.

```
267	    `n \equiv 1 mod 6` or `n \equiv 3 \pmod 6`, in which case

Yes, that's the problem with the old code in sage. If you touch at one place, you have to touch it at many places. ;)
