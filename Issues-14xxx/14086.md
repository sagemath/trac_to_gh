Hello,

you should not use

```
assert isinstance(n, (Integer, int)) and n >= 0, '%s is not a non-negative integer.' % n 
```
but rather write a test that raise a ValueError

Similar problem for all the other assert in your patch

Well, nothing works..

You have made a mistake in changing one of the assert into a test (you forgot to add a **not**)

Please run sage -t to catch the errors, before posting patches here.
