**Attachment:** [hyperplane.sage](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket14789/hyperplane.sage)

here is a patch, build from the proposed file

it need a lot of work, first to put coverage to 100% and make all tests pass..

for the moment, the coverage is

SCORE sage/geometry/hyperplane_arrangement.py: 61.6% (45 of 73)

and already 16 tests are failing

Very nice! I like the functionality but have a couple of suggestions to integrate it with the rest of Sage.

There is a lot of needless copy/deepcopy-ing. Most objects in Sage are immutable and don't need to be copied ever, you can just use/return the existing object. E.g. polyhedra are immutable. You should figure out whether you want your objects to be immutable, too. I suggest you make everything immutable, it is generally a big source of errors to make caching work with mutable stuff.

Caching can be done with the `@cached_method` decorator, this is much easier to understand/maintain than a `__getattr__` hack.

Please no version number for individual files, Sage already has a version number.

Instead of `__repr__`, you should implement `_repr_`, see http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/coding_in_python.html#special-sage-functions

I think its confusing to have a `Hyperplane` in the global namespace that is not a `Polyhedron`. How about you replace it essentially with the arrangement consisting of a single-hyperplane. So instead of a special `add_hyperplane`, just use union:

```
    A = HyperplaneArrangement([[1,0,0],[0,1,1],[0,1,-1],[1,-1,0],[1,1,0]]) 
    B = A.union(HyperplaneArrangement([[1,1,1]]) 
    B = A.union([[1,1,1]])    # syntactic sugar for adding list of hyperplanes
    B = A.union([1,1,1])      # syntactic sugar for adding single hyperplane
    B = A & [1,1,1]           # operator notation
```
and pick an operator to overload (probably either plus or ampersand) as an alias for union.

The HyperplaneArrangement should be a Parent and individual hyperplanes its elements. Roughly:

```
class Hyperplane(AffineSubspace, Element):

    Element = Hyperplane

    def __init__(self, ...):
        Parent.__init__(self, base=base_ring, category=Sets())
```
and always use `hyperplane_arrangement.element_class()` instead of the plain `Hyperplane` class. This automatically gives you a `base_ring()` method (Sage generally uses `base_ring` instead of `base_field` even if it is only implemented for fields).

This is a wonderful addition to Sage. Just a couple comments (not a review, not even close):

- There needs to be a way to call the empty hyperplane arrangement; this should not happen:

```
sage:  b = HyperplaneArrangement([])
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
IndexError                                Traceback (most recent call last)

----> 1 b = HyperplaneArrangement([])

/home/darij/sage-5.11.beta3/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/geometry/hyperplane_arrangement.pyc in __init__(self, A, K, check_for_duplicates)
   1398             self._hyperplanes = [Hyperplane(h,K) for h in eqns]
   1399         self._base_field = K

   1401         self._ambient_space = VectorSpace(K,self._dim)
   1402 

IndexError: list index out of range
sage: 
```

- The reference [RS] is available online ( http://math.mit.edu/~rstan/arrangements/arr.html ), and you should also correct its title (it's "An Introduction to Hyperplane Arrangements").

- "The default base field is QQ": when you write something like that in a docstring, there is no reason not to put the QQ in double-backticks (``QQ``).

- "A hyperplane arrangement is *essential* is the normals to its hyperplane span " the "is" should be an "if".

- "    Class for an affine space (a translation of a linear subspace). " You want to say "affine subspace", not "affine space"!

- Not sure if this is a good thing:

```
sage:  a = HyperplaneArrangement([[2,4,6],[1,0,1]])
sage:  b = HyperplaneArrangement([[1,0,1],[2,4,6]])
sage: a == b
True
sage: a.sign_vector((2, -2))
[-1, 1]
sage: b.sign_vector((2, -2))
[1, -1]
```

This, of course, is hard to avert unless you either make equality much more restrictive or use hyperplane arrangements that are lists, rather than sets, of hyperplanes. The latter might in fact be more useful in the long run -- e. g., what if I need to keep track of what happens to each hyperplane when I am changing base field, and I cannot assume that the hyperplanes keep their indices in the `.hyperplanes()` list because some hyperplanes might collapse on base change? I assume restriction to a hyperplane would lead to the same problem.

- Double "is" in "A *face* is is the".

- The [GZ] reference, like any other Transactions paper, is online: http://www.ams.org/journals/tran/1983-280-01/S0002-9947-1983-0712251-1/

- In the definitions of the Catalan and braid arrangements (in their respective docstrings), replace i \leq j by i < j.

to me, this is an indication of an issue that has to be carefully sorted out: namely, a notion of equality vs isomorphism.
Especially as one might think about creating arrangements from other data, e.g. often in my work I see arrangements obtained from a set of points by taking all the possible hyperplanes on them.

Until this is sorted out, I'd rather think of disabling `==` all together.

A hyperplane arrangement is a *set* of hyperplanes.  Two hyperplane arrangements are equal if their set of hyperplanes are equal.  So "==" perfectly clear and useful as it is.

The issue of isomorphism is separable and it would be nice to implement this.  There can be an isomorphism that arises from an affine change of coordinates of the ambient space, and there can be a combinatorial isomorphism, meaning an isomorphism of intersection posets (e.g., an arrangement and its essentialization).

Could you be more precise about the other type of data that should determine a hyperplane arrangement?  The input would be a set of points.  From this set, how does one create a hyperplane arrangement?

Thanks very much for you comments.

This needs to be said in the docs then. Indeed, currently one sees:

``` 
String Form:<class 'sage.geometry.hyperplane_arrangement.HyperplaneArrangement'>
File:       /usr/local/src/sage/sage-5.11.beta3/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/geometry/hyperplane_arrangement.py
Docstring:
   The argument "A" is normally a list of hyperplanes or a list of

```

 
> Could you be more precise about the other type of data that should determine a hyperplane arrangement?  The input would be a set of points.  From this set, how does one create a hyperplane arrangement?


Just take all the hyperplanes one obtains as affine spans of d-subsets of these points in d-dimensional space.

I have also seen papers talking about the arrangement associated with a triangulation (there one takes  the facets of the
simplices in the triangulation as hyperplanes).

Just as an FYI (not necessarily needed to implement this now!) we now have matroids in Sage at #7477.  So an enhancement request could be to have an arrangement return its associated matroid - and, for that matter, vice versa, if I understand correctly that matroids may be interpreted thus under some circumstances (but not related to the matroid of a central arrangement).  Anyway, whatever is right, we might want to do it someday.

+1 to the question

However, in this case maybe (maybe) it's okay.  Because the question is about "which side of the hyperplane the point is on" and that of course requires an orientation to each hyperplane, given by the equation, and naturally this list will depend on the order.  However, the documentation probably should include this example to point out that it definitely depends on the order you give the hyperplanes in, just in case some unsuspecting user might think otherwise.  A sign set probably wouldn't be of very much use.

By the way, I assume that we don't get

```
a is b
True
```
which I think *would* be a bug.

the layout is still weird, as I'd expect a box to be selected  and each line extending to the boundaries of the box. Currently it seems that each line has its own box, and they don't play together well.

Yes.  Each hyperplane is parametrized.  The "ranges" option allows the plotting parameters to be adjusted individually, e.g.,

sage: a.show(ranges=[[-10,6],[-3,10],[-3,3],[-6,6],[-6,6],[-5,5]])

Perhaps there is a way to make the parameters all large, then constrict the bounding box.

Inspect the current layout, hyperplane by hyperplane, and find the box by computing maxima and minima of coordinates.
Then adjust each hyperplane  to fit in the box.

Well, I'm not saying this must happen on this ticket, but please open a followup ticket to address this.

I'm still not particularly happy with the syntax. Especially handing around tuples isn't really that userfriendly. I would propose the following:

```
sage: H.<x,y,z> = HyperplaneArrangements(QQ)
```
as shortcut for

```
sage: H = HyperplaneArrangements(QQ, names='x, y, z')
sage: H.inject_variables()
```
and then construct hyperplanes as 

```
sage: hyperplane = x + 2*y + 3*z - 4
```
and hyperplane arrangements as

If nobody objects then I'll work on that since I kind of need hyperplane arrangements now...

The syntax you suggest is very nice for very small examples.  Using tuples is convenient for larger or for computer-generated examples.  (It's similar to the syntax for polyhedra in Sage, of course.)  So I would support your suggestion as long as it does not interfere with using tuples.

Thanks!

Yes, agree. That would be natural using conversion syntax:

```
sage: H.<x,y,z> = HyperplaneArrangements(QQ)
sage: H([4, 1, 2, 3])
x + 2*y + 3*z + 4
```

On a related note, I think the constant should be first for consistency with polyhedra:

```
sage: Polyhedron(ieqs=[(4,1,2,3)]).Hrepresentation()
(An inequality (1, 2, 3) x + 4 >= 0,)
```

Don't use "and". It explicitly has shortcutting behaviour specified on it:

```
sage: 1 and 2
2
sage: a = 1; b = 2
sage: b if a else a #it's specified to do this
2
```
so departing from this behaviour would be very surprising.

The operator possibly available would be the "bitwise" `&`, but I doubt you want to repurpose it for union.? Being smart with overloading operators often comes back to bite you (see `%` for string formatting in python).

Also, since these are hyperplanes given by equations describing them, `and` could easily be interpreted as *intersection*. That's the most direct interpretation coming from the boolean meaning of the operator in sage.

Multiplication would come closer if you think about the arrangement as a union of hyperplanes. Do you keep multiplicities?

If you think of the hyperplane arrangement as a collection of hyperplanes, then they should probably be modelled as a set of hyperplanes, and python does not overload any binary operation to take unions of sets.

Out of the binary ops available that's probably the one that makes most sense. I don't think overloading binops has much precedent in sage/python, though, so it looks a little odd to me. Given how non-compact this notation is anyway, do we really need a compact way of combining hyperplanes?

There's another small problem: vector spaces in sage do not have variable names. In principle, given a vector space, there is a well-defined set of all hyperplane arrangements in that space. If we insist on giving names to the standard basis of the dual vector space, there would be multiple (determined by the names) and the user would be forced to come up with names if he/she wants to construct the collection.

I agree that describing a hyperplane in n-space with a tuple of length n+1 feels a little uncomfortable: It should really be a vector in the dual space together with a scalar, i.e., a pair of an n-tuple and a scalar, which is awkward to work with by itself.

Would it be better to let (a,b,c,d) mean a*x+b*y+c*z+d=0 (note the sign on the constant)? That's a little more like standard homogenization.

Precedent in other software dealing with hyperplane arrangements might be instructive?

All sufficiently hard work is indistinguishable from magic ;-)

<a id='comment:52'></a>
The thing I was beefing about with my `sign_vector` copypasta wasn't so much the handling of `==` (which would require us to fix the definition of a hyperplane arrangement in place more formally than mathematicians do), as the unpredictability of the output:

```
sage: h = H(x, y, x-1, y-1, y-1)
sage: h.sign_vector((2,-2))
(-1, -1, 1, 1)
sage: h.restriction(y).sign_vector((2,))
(-1, 1)
```
How do I tell (without lots of overhead) which entry of the vector corresponds to which line?

EDIT: Also there is a failing longtime doctest (failing because you forgot to provide the answer):

```
File "src/sage/geometry/hyperplane_arrangement/arrangement.py", line 1438, in sage.geometry.hyperplane_arrangement.arrangement.HyperplaneArrangementElement.regions
Failed example:
    len(chessboard.bounded_regions())   # long time, 359 ms on a Core i7
Expected nothing
Got:
    64
```

EDIT2: Unfitting docstring:

```
    def unbounded_regions(self):
        r"""
        Return the relatively bounded regions of the arrangement.
```

EDIT3: It would be best to redefine `_an_element_` since it currently returns a hyperplane instead of a hyperplane arrangement:

```
sage: HyperplaneArrangements(QQ, ('x','y')).an_element()
Hyperplane x + 0*y + 0
```

```
so it seems like it's trying to coerce 0 into `H`, but that is failing. The second is that 0-dimensional hyperplane arrangements don't have an `_an_element_()`. If we can't create 0-dim hyperplane arrangements, then we shouldn't allow things like `HyperplaneArrangements(QQ)`.

I've taken care of the pyflakes report and the long doctest failure.

What is 

```
sage: H.<x,y,z> = HyperplaneArrangements(QQ)
sage: H(0)
```
supposed to return? You could either argue the empty arrangement (neutral element in the additive semigroup) or the entire space defined by the degenerate "hyperplane" 0=0. I really don't want to allow that kind of degenerate hyperplanes. So that leaves us with the former, but I still find `H(0)` confusing and, by extension, `H(x) == 0`. 

There is no easy way to find out which ambient hyperplane went where in `restriction()`, in particular it involves choices:

```
sage: H.<x,y> = HyperplaneArrangements(QQ)
sage: H(x-y, x+y, x).restriction(x)
Arrangement <y>
```
So its alwasy going to be convoluted. If you need to know the sign vector of a point in terms of the ambient space arrangement then just compute the sign vector there.

I can fix up the 0-dimensional and empty arrangement case...

Replying to [vbraun](#comment%3A56):
> Ok since `H()` is equivalent to `H(0)` we'll have to go with it... 


This is #8648.

Currently this works

```
sage: H.<x,y,z> = HyperplaneArrangements(QQ)
sage: 0*x
Hyperplane 0*x + 0*y + 0*z + 0
sage: H(0*x)
Empty hyperplane arrangement of dimension 3
```
but this doesn't:

```
sage: H(0*x, 0*x)
ValueError: linear expression must be non-constant to define a hyperplane
```
I think the best course of action is to make this consistent by stripping out the degenerate hyperplanes. Alternatively we could treat the special case of a non-hyperplane `0` as referring to the empty arrangement as a workaround for #8648 and the equality test. Your thoughts?
