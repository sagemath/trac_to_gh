Keywords: Family, Category of finite enumerated sets, CartesianProduct

This happens with Sage 5.10beta3:

```
sage: P=Permutations()
sage: print P.category()
Category of sets
sage: print P.cardinality()
+Infinity
sage: F=Family(Permutations(), lambda i:i)
sage: print F.category()
Category of finite enumerated sets
```

But clearly `F` is not finite...

Another bug, (also fixed in the attached patch):

```
sage: Family(CartesianProduct(ZZ,ZZ),lambda (x,y) : (x+y,x-y)).cardinality()
...
TypeError: cardinality does not fit into a Python int.
```

update: following example is still wrong (see second comment)

```
sage: X=CombinatorialFreeModule(ZZ,ZZ)
sage: print X
Free module generated by Integer Ring over Integer Ring
sage: print X.basis().category()
Category of enumerated sets
sage: TX = tensor((X,))
sage: print TX.basis().cardinality()
+Infinity
sage: print TX.basis().category()
Category of finite enumerated sets
```

Thanks for the report!

Hmm, that's annoying indeed. This stems from the fact that `Permutations` still uses the old CombinatorialClass, and for those it's not so easy to detect easily whether they are known to be finite.

As a workaround, line 832 of Family, when the input is a CombinatorialClass, we could ask whether x.cardinality() != infinity. The risk is to trigger the enumeration of the elements of the combinatorial class which might take a while ... Or check if cardinality actually is implemented (i.e. is not the default _cardinality_from_iterator), and if yes call it.

Of course, the proper fix would be to revamp permutations to be an enumerated set like has been done recently for tableaux.

Would you be willing to handle any of the above?

This sounds like a solution that might fix the issue that I'm seeing with my (still nascent) Steenrod algebra module package. I'll try to prepare a patch along these lines.

Attachment [14541.patch](tarball://root/attachments/some-uuid/ticket14541/14541.patch) by @cnassau created at 2013-05-07 15:01:57

The attached patch changes the category initialization of `LazyFamily` objects: if the keys `K` are an instance of `CombinatorialClass` the category choice now depends on "`K.cardinality() < Infinity`" in the obvious way.

(I have not tried to inspect the keys `K` further, because I could not find a `CombinatorialClass` without custom `cardinality` method.)

I have also added another exception to `LazyFamily.cardinality()`: the code used to check for `AttributeError` and `NotImplementedError`, but `CartesianProduct(...).__len__` raises a `TypeError` instead. I've added a doctest that fails otherwise.

The bug reported has been fixed in the meantime by #14772 : permutations do not use `CombinatorialClass` anymore.
This does not fix the general problem however, and indeed one should not force the computation of the cardinality of this set unless this operations has been explicitly requested.

Thus, I upload a git branch which just removes `CombinatorialClass` from the list of exceptions. There is apparently no reason why all instances of `CombinatorialClass` should represent finite sets.

(and I personally don't even see why an uncountable set should be said to be "enumerable", but that's another problem)

The first and second issues are fixed

```
sage: F = Family(Permutations(), lambda i: i)
sage: F.category()
Category of infinite enumerated sets
sage: Family(cartesian_product([ZZ,ZZ]),lambda (x,y) : (x+y,x-y)).cardinality()
+Infinity
```
However, the last issue is still outstanding:

```
sage: X=CombinatorialFreeModule(ZZ,ZZ)
sage: X.basis().category()
Category of infinite enumerated sets
sage: TX = tensor((X,))
sage: TX.basis().cardinality()
+Infinity
sage: TX.basis().category()
Category of finite enumerated sets
```
This seems to be due to falling into a default of finite (enumerated) sets instead of just pulling the information from the category of the keys:

```
sage: TX.basis().keys()
Image of Cartesian product of Integer Ring by <type 'tuple'>
sage: TX.basis().keys().category()
Category of sets
```

Also, the stopgap field is to be used for ticket(s) for the stopgaps.
