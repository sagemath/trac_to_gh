One common use model of Sage is to use tab completion to identify methods of a given object. For Sage integers, this will currently fail to reveal many standard functions such as the following.

```
number_of_divisors # d(n)
moebius            # mu(n)
euler_phi          # phi(n)
partitions         # tau(n)
```
I propose to add methods to the class of Sage integers. In the process, perhaps one can add a few standard functions which are missing even from the class of bare functions, like sum_of_divisors ("sigma(n)").

I doubt the general usefulness of such an undertaking. The notion that functions that take an object as parameter should be equivalent to member functions of that object is too broad.

I agree that the notion is too broad, but not in the way you have in mind: in Python, one generally tries to avoid clogging up the global namespace with things that really should be member functions of a particular class.

In any case, this case is much more special than the general discussion, because arithmetic functions are distinguished by the property of multiplicativity: if `gcd(m,n) == 1` then `f(m*n) = f(m)*f(n)`. So in a sense, they are more deeply linked to the class of integers than, say, the binomial or factorial functions.
