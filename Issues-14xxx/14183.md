The functions `convert_cnf` is simply the function `convert_cnf_table`. Although, this has been acknowledged in the docstring, the very implementation seems out of the way. We usually, declare the functions equal instead of having different docstrings and such. So, I have done this in this case with minor tweaks in the documentation.
