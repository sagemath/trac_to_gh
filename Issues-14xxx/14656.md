When building sage in sage-on-gentoo we get the following QA report from portage

```
 * QA Notice: Package triggers severe warnings which indicate that it
 *            may exhibit random runtime failures.
 * build/cythonized/sage/libs/flint/flint.c:664:3: warning: implicit declaration of function '_fmpz_cleanup_mpz_content' [-Wimplicit-function-declaration]
```
Which is quite correct as _fmpz_cleanup* functions are defined in flint/fmpz.h while the pxd file only includes flint/flint.h. It is possible that this file is included somehow, but it is cleaner just to add it.

While I haven't noticed any failures being triggered by it, correcting the cython declaration is the right thing to do.

I should also note that a similar warning existed with flint 1.x and we had a similar patch in sage-on-gentoo from sage-4.4.2 onwards. The QA at the time suggested that it could cause memory leaks.
