# Issue 14885: Very nonstandard convention used in multiplying permutations

    "body": "In most mathematical literature, the product `p * q` of two permutations `p` and `q` is defined to be the permutation given by first applying `q` and then applying `p`. This notation is so standard that (unlike either of the ways to draw a Young tableau, or considering 0 a natural number or not) authors don't even bother to say anything about it when they are using it. I have seen the opposite convention (\"left-to-right\", i. e., first apply `p`, then `q`) only in Herstein's \"Topics in Algebra\" (he no longer seemed to use it in his newer \"Abstract Algebra\") and GAP. Not until today did I know that Sage also belongs to this exclusive circle. I don't know how many computations I have made unaware of this, and how many of them gave wrong results. And I have a hunch that I might not be the only one. Both Herstein and GAP accompany their nonstandard definition of a product by a corresponding syntax for actions: permutations (and, in the case of Herstein, most maps in general) act on items from the right in their notation. This, at least, has the advantage of screaming \"nonstandard notations!\" to the reader/user, who will then (hopefully) be foresightful enough to check out how products are read. But this is not how it works in Sage (and is probably not possible in Python). In Sage, permutations act on numbers from the left but are multiplied right-to-left.

In most mathematical literature, the product `p * q` of two permutations `p` and `q` is defined to be the permutation given by first applying `q` and then applying `p`. This notation is so standard that (unlike either of the ways to draw a Young tableau, or considering 0 a natural number or not) authors don't even bother to say anything about it when they are using it. I have seen the opposite convention ("left-to-right", i. e., first apply `p`, then `q`) only in Herstein's "Topics in Algebra" (he no longer seemed to use it in his newer "Abstract Algebra") and GAP. Not until today did I know that Sage also belongs to this exclusive circle. I don't know how many computations I have made unaware of this, and how many of them gave wrong results. And I have a hunch that I might not be the only one. Both Herstein and GAP accompany their nonstandard definition of a product by a corresponding syntax for actions: permutations (and, in the case of Herstein, most maps in general) act on items from the right in their notation. This, at least, has the advantage of screaming "nonstandard notations!" to the reader/user, who will then (hopefully) be foresightful enough to check out how products are read. But this is not how it works in Sage (and is probably not possible in Python). In Sage, permutations act on numbers from the left but are multiplied right-to-left. If you ask me, this is a bug and as serious as a bug can get due to its enormous potential for misunderstanding between man and machine.

Actually, by setting a global variable one can make Sage work with the usual convention as well. Well, that requires knowing that the issue exists in the first place. This left aside, this might be a cure worse than the disease. Global variables affect computations inside methods, and at least some methods reliant on multiplication of permutations were not written with these variables in mind. Here is an example: The `characteristic_symmetric_function()` method on Dyck words breaks if the permutation option `mult` is set to `'r2l'`:

```
sage: R = QQ['q','t'].fraction_field()
sage: (q,t) = R.gens()
sage: f = sum(t**D.area()*D.characteristic_symmetric_function() for D in DyckWords(3)); f
(q^3+q^2*t+q*t^2+t^3+q*t)*s[1, 1, 1] + (q^2+q*t+t^2+q+t)*s[2, 1] + s[3]
sage: PermutationOptions(mult='r2l')
sage: f = sum(t**D.area()*D.characteristic_symmetric_function() for D in DyckWords(3)); f
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)
...
ValueError: (q^2+q)*F[1, 2] + q*F[2, 1] is not a symmetric function
```

The same error is cast if I use the new syntax introduced by #14772 (no offense to Travis, his patch is not about this). (Before #14772, you would switch from one convention to the other using `PermutationOptions(mult='r2l')` resp. `PermutationOptions(mult='l2r')`; now, it is `Permutations.global_options(mult='r2l')` resp. `Permutations.global_options(mult='l2r')`.)

Probably the "right" way to work around this issue is by doing what `sage/combinat/symmetric_group_algebra.py` does in its `epsilon_ik()` method, and temporarily reset the permutation options before starting the computation, then setting them back after the computation is done. I guess I'm not the only one who is finding this ugly and error-prone; moreover, it probably makes parallelization harder.

I have checked sage.combinat and not found any other visible errors of the above type, but this seems to be owed to the fact that we rarely ever multiply permutations! I have seen some permutations being coerced into larger symmetric groups by multiplying them with the appropriate identity permutations (#14883, #14884), and some doctests which don't really depend on the order of multiplication. Other than that, permutations getting multiplied inside methods seem rare and mostly contained in `permutation.py` and `symmetric_group_algebra.py`. This issue *is* fixable if we want to; the worst that will happen is backward incompatibility, but I don't think that would be worse than what we have now.

What are everyone's opinions on this?

What do you mean by "the action on[of?] one permutation on another"? Sage doesn't understand `Permutation([1,3,2])(Permutation([2,3,1]))`. Do you mean action on an int? It's the usual left action:

```
sage: Permutation([2,3,1])(3)
1
```

I think sage-devel is a good idea. I'm not on the list though (only sage-combinat-devel); will try to join now. EDIT: got no idea how :(

About methods breaking if we set the opposite convention, the `characteristic_symmetric_function()` one is an example, but probably various methods in `permutation.py` and `symmetric_group_algebra.py` will also; on the other hand, I am fairly sure that very few methods outside these two files will change.

I also think that this should be a thread on Sage devel, if only to let everybody know what has been going on until now. That's really scary `O_o`

Personally, I would vote for a backward uncompatible change that would set things how they should have been written since the beginning. Possibly with a warning the first time the multiplication is called to say that "there has been a change, and that the users should think for a couple of minutes of their past OR future computations, as one of the two is not returning what they think it should".

But this is definitely worth advertisement on sage-devel !
