}
```
The patch allows to prepend a (finite) list to a (potentially infinite) infinite list:

```
sage: from sage.misc.lazy_list import lazy_list
sage: from itertools import count
sage: l = lazy_list(i**2 for i in count()); l
lazy list [0, 1, 4, ...]
sage: ['toto', 'bibi'] + l
lazy list ['toto', 'bibi', 0, ...]
```

Hey Vincent,

Two minor things. First, you have a typo on line 40: `arround` should be `around`. Second, the commit message should have a short description on the first line; something like:

```
#14568: Allows to prepend a list to a lazy list.
```
Otherwise looks good.

Best,

Travis
