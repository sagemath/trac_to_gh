```
In Sage 5.6, the basis of the Steenrod algebra is not quite what it should be:

```python
sage: A=SteenrodAlgebra(7)
sage: for k in zip((1,..,5),A.basis()):
....:     print k
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
IndexError: tuple index out of range
```
The attached patch uses the new `set_from_iterator`-classes to fix this:

```python
sage: A=SteenrodAlgebra(7)
sage: for (idx,a) in zip((1,..,5),A.basis()):
...      print idx, a
1 1
2 Q_0
3 P(1)
4 Q_1
5 Q_0 P(1)
```


Depends on #13856

Should I be worried about calling another method (`self.is_finite()`) from the `__init__` method? Otherwise, this looks okay to me.
