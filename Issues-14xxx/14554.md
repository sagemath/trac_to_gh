The string representation for FilteredCombinatorialClass gives the description as "Filtered sublass of " instead of "Filtered subclass of " (note the missing 'c' in the first). This is a simple correction of this typo and all places where it occurs in doctests.

Sounds good. You can set a positive review on my behalf as soon as the patchbot light goes green!

Thanks for this first contribution!

By the way, don't worry too much for *CombinatorialClass: those are
meant to disappear at some point.

Cheers,
                            Nicolas
