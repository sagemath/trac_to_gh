The readline in IPython is broken if ncurses-devel is not installed in various modern Linux distributions. Installing the ncurses headers from the distribution (yum install ncurses-devel on Fedora) fixes this.

The problem seems to be that the ancient libtermcap (no new releases since March 2002) is not enough anymore. I suggest to replace the termcap spkg with ncurses. Sage-5.9.beta3 builds fine. The only downside is that it takes ~2mb instead of ~300k, but on the upside the terminal is no longer broken.

* Apply [attachment:trac_14405_replace_termcap_with_ncurses.patch] to the SAGE_ROOT repo
* Apply [attachment:14405_hgignore.patch] to `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin`
* Delete the termcap spkg
* Add http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/vbraun/spkg/ncurses-5.9.spkg
* Update http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/vbraun/spkg/readline-6.2.p4.spkg

If Python's readline did work before #12725 and #12725 broke it: please attach logs of the Python compilation, before and after (with the same Sage version, serial install).

This is on two different Ubuntu 12.04.1 installs where libncurses5 and libncursesw5 packages are installed but no -dev packages are.

OK, then please try the things I asked to Volker: try without #12725 and show the Python logs so we can see what the problem is.

But the end result is the same: the `_curses` module doesn't build (either due to "missing bits" or "failed to build"), neither with #12725, nor without. So I still doubt that #12725 is a problem.

What happens with other packages using readline, PARI/GP for example? How is the line editing in

```
$ ./sage --gp
```
And what is the header message when starting GP, it indicates whether or not readline is used.

And after removing the libncurses.a symlink and rebuilding the Python 2.7 spkg on the 5.9.beta2, the log looks similar to the one on the 4.8 install.
But Sage command line still seems broken (I've rebuilt ipython and run ./sage -b).

I could not test the new python on the 4.8 install as it does not like it that much and fails to rebuild.

No such problems on 5.6 and 5.7, so I guess that #12725 is not the culprit for the bug (although the error message about _curses I get shows it may not be that useful).
Maybe new ipython?

Ipython was updated in 5.7, so that's not it.

I've now rebuilt readline, ipython, pari as well, still without the libncurses.a symlink.
./sage -gp works fine (and shows realine 6.2 is enabled), and sage command line still broken.

The `sage -gp` readline also is different between the working and broken sage commandline. If I compile the working readline, `sage -gp` has correct multi-line readline (input is continued on subsequent lines. With the broken readline, `sage -gp` falls back to single-line readline (input scrolls horizontally if necessary).

Yup, and on Ubuntu, there is even no separate libtinfo.so file (except for the libncurses-dbg debug package).
The functions it should provided are actually provided by libncurses.so directly.

Can we consider it is broken because it uses single-line editing mode?
Isn't that to be expected with termcap?
(I really have no clue...)

Note that this single-line mode is ok in gp and python, it's only in ipython its broken, so there is a problem with ipython (and its been there since at least 0.10, we just encountered it recently in Sage because the way we use ipython must have changed).

Anyway, I agree that multi-line editing looks nicer so just ignoring this ipython/readline/termcap problem and using ipython/readlines/ncurses is a sensible workaround/fix.

Just a reminder for myself: HAVE TO FIX THIS.
Either find out how ipython breaks with termcap only or be lazy and use Volker spkgs.

The broken command line edit is just driving me crazy, I cannot understand why the google groups are not flooded by rants about that.
Does every one use the notebook?

We should switch to ncurses anyways, I don't see a point in adding workarounds for termcap.

I guess most users already have ncurses headers in their OS install, if you install any development packages then its very likely to be pulled in.

That's Jeroen's invention, the idea being to be able to (temporarily) "disable" a patch by `chmod -r ...` without having to change `spkg-install` (which usually unconditionally applies all [readable] patches in a loop).

And if there are no patches at all, `patch` doesn't bail out because the shell doesn't expand `.../*.patch` (where `[ -f ... ]` would be sufficient).

I did at first, but in a build from scratch the doc failed to build complaining about UP missing and after rebuilding readline with it, it was ok so I've left it in.

Another installation of just the two spkg after that on a system where Sage was already installed, with the patch in, also failed with the same error.
But it seems it was because a previous libtermcap.a was already in $SAGE_LOCAL/lib when the spkgs were built.
At least removing libtermcap.a and rebuilding once more let the doc build.
Note I've not looked deeply into this and this is mostly experimental.
But I seem to remember that in this latter case, the first libreadline.so produced was not linked with libtinfo (that ncurses should now provide, but I did not look to see if it was there during that try) and that the second one was.
Not completely sure about that though.

The spkg needs some trivial work:

In `SPKG.txt`, the license should be GPL v3+ and the following paragraph needs to be updated:

```
## Dependencies

 * GNU patch

 * libtermcap (or libncurses or libtinfo), but not Sage's one,
   since we only build a static version. I.e., the system has
   to provide one of these.
```

Also, the file `src/support/mkinstalldirs` is not user-writable, which is strange.

No, the issue that, despite the `-lncurses` in the gcc invocation, Python's `readline.so` does not actually link against `libncurses.so:

```

```
Some dynamic linking expert is needed here.

Running Python with `LD_PRELOAD="$SAGE_LOCAL/lib/libncurses.so"` solves the problem.

The issue is [https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel/2010-November/031991.html](https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel/2010-November/031991.html)

Adding `-Wl,--no-as-needed` to the linker invocation solves the problem.

```
gcc -pthread -shared -L/var/lib/buildbot/build/sage/arando-1/arando_full/build/sage-5.12.beta1/local/lib -L/var/lib/buildbot/build/sage/arando-1/arando_full/build/sage-5.12.beta1/local/lib build/temp.linux-i686-2.7/var/lib/buildbot/build/sage/arando-1/arando_full/build/sage-5.12.beta1/spkg/build/python-2.7.5.p1/src/Modules/readline.o -L/usr/lib/termcap -L/var/lib/buildbot/build/sage/arando-1/arando_full/build/sage-5.12.beta1/local/lib -L/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu -L/usr/local/lib -L. -lreadline -Wl,--no-as-needed -lncurses -lpython2.7 -o build/lib.linux-i686-2.7/readline.so

libcurses is just a symlink to libncurses. I don't have an account on any of those machines. Can you post the ldd output for libncurses.so and libreadline.so? I would guess that the latter is underlinked, and since python readline.so doesn't use UP directly we end up not pulling in ncurses.

Just a random rant on this closed ticket: not building the readline static library makes python fails to build on Cygwin.
