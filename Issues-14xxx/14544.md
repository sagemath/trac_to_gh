Install the PARI spkg from #14539:

```
./sage -i http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/spkg/pari-2.5.4.p0.spkg
```
Then rebuild the library:

```
./sage -b
```
Before #13031, this used to rebuild all files depending on PARI (good!), with #13031 absolutely nothing happens (bad!).

**apply** [attachment:14544-cythonize-deps.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket14544/14544-cythonize-deps.patch) to the Sage library
