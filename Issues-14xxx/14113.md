error is in combinat/root_system/type_affine.py

sage: L = RootSystem(["A",1,1]).ambient_lattice()

sage: L.simple_root(0)

returns rational coefficients when integers are expected,
yielding the error

TypeError: unsupported operand parent(s) for '*': 'Rational Field' and
'Ambient lattice of the Root system of type ['A', 1, 1]'
