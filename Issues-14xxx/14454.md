The following doctest really takes too long:

```
**********************************************************************
File "devel/sage/sage/combinat/crystals/generalized_young_walls.py", line 850, in sage.combinat.crystals.generalized_young_walls.HighestWeightCrystalOfGYW.__init__
Failed example:
    TestSuite(YLa).run() # long time
Test ran for 203.43 s
**********************************************************************
```

It is **by far** the longest doctest in all of Sage. Can this test be made faster? Or removed in the worst case?

Hey Jeroen,

Best,
