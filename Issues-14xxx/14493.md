As a very inexperienced person in this field I found it very difficult from the existing docs to understand the difference in syntax between the python and sage functions "minimize" - and I imagine this applies to other function handles as well: though I will need some guidance as to which function specs I need to amend.

See [this sage-support discussion](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-support/3mekDq5Stvk):

```
vars = var('x y')
def gg(x,y): return sin(x) + cos(y)
minimize(gg,[0,0])
```
gives a TypeError, while

```
vars = var('x y')
gg = sin(x) + cos(y)
minimize(gg,[0,0])
```
doesn't, but

```
sage: def gg(x): return sin(x[0]) + cos(x[1]) 
sage: minimize(gg,[0,0]) 
Optimization terminated successfully. 
          Current function value: -2.000000 
          Iterations: 72 
          Function evaluations: 139 
(-1.5707636272, 3.14159570731) 
```
does.

The relevant possibly confusing doc is [here](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/numerical/sage/numerical/optimize.html#sage.numerical.optimize.minimize).

<div id="comment:7" align="right">comment:7</div>

assuming that this ticket is for documentation only (not for the feature itself), i find that the docstring is currently well and clear in this respect. 

this is because it says:

```
    INPUT:

    - ``func`` -- Either a symbolic function or a Python function whose
      argument is a tuple with `n` components
```

for this reason i suggest to either close this ticket, or to add an extra note:

```
- If you use a Python function, the argument must be a tuple with `n` components, e.g. 
``def func(x): return sin(x[0]) + cos(x[1])`` instead of ``def func(x,y): return sin(x) + cos(y)``.
```
