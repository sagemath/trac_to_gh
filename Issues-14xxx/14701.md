Hey Amri,

Here's a review patch which does the following:

- Uses `**` instead of `^` since in python (which all `.py` files get interpreted as) the latter means bitwise-xor.
- Makes some simplifications to your code by using the `prod` function instead of `reduce`.
- Expands on the docstrings and changes them around for some formatting and default latex macros for sage.

If you're happy with my changes, you can go ahead and set this to positive review. Feel free to ask me any questions if you have any.

Best,

Travis

Dear Travis,

Thanks for the corrections; there was just one doctest that failed because of wrong spacing. I have corrected that, and I think this is ok now.

Amri.
