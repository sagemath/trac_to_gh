```
sage: sage.combinat.designs.block_design.WittDesign(24)
```
and I had no idea how to install a gap package in the copy of gap that Sage contains...

This patch works for me, applied to sage 5.8:

` sage: sage.combinat.designs.block_design.WittDesign(24)`

`Incidence structure with 24 points and 759 block `

However, after being prompted to run install_package("gap_packages"), gap_packages-4.5.7 is found. After you updated the spkg was I supposed to find gap_packages-4.6.3 ?

Nononono, `gap` and `gap_packages` are different spkg. Besides, when you ask Sage to install a package for you it will download the latest "accepted" package, so not the one from this ticket `:-)`

Then I will probaly remove the doctest.

My problem with exceptions and warnings is not so general : in that case, a warning is printed just before the exception is raised, and no one sees the warning as a result. It would make more sense to just raise an exception. I will try to make the error message shorter.
