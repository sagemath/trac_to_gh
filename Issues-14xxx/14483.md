Very short patch ! I met that problem while trying to run 

```
sage: sage.combinat.designs.block_design.WittDesign(24)
```
and I had no idea how to install a gap package in the copy of gap that Sage contains...

This patch works for me, applied to sage 5.8:

` sage: sage.combinat.designs.block_design.WittDesign(24)`

`Incidence structure with 24 points and 759 block `

However, after being prompted to run install_package("gap_packages"), gap_packages-4.5.7 is found. After you updated the spkg was I supposed to find gap_packages-4.6.3 ?

Nononono, `gap` and `gap_packages` are different spkg. Besides, when you ask Sage to install a package for you it will download the latest "accepted" package, so not the one from this ticket `:-)`
