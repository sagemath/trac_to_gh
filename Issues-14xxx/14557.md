any commands that are registered through atexit are not run if they are called through a `DocTestWorker`.

For example

```python
sage: import atexit, shutil, tempfile
sage: atexit.register(shutil.rmtree, tempfile.mkdtemp())
```
leaves a temporary file behind when run through the doctesting framework when there shouldn't be (the behaviour that you get when you run the same commands through the sage command line).
