Original issue: there is no problem buildind a polynomial over AA:

```
sage: R = AA[x]                       
sage: P = R(x^6+x^5+x^4-x^3+x^2-x+2/5)
```

But the same operation does not work on QQbar:

```
sage: S = QQbar[x]
sage: Q = S(x^6+x^5+x^4-x^3+x^2-x+2/5)
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
NotImplementedError: symbol
```

Hovewer, this workaround works:

```
sage: Q = P.change_ring(QQbar)
```


Moreover the following works : 

```
sage: S.<x> = PolynomialRing(QQbar,'x')
sage: Q = S(x^6+x^5+x^4-x^3+x^2-x+2/5)
sage: S == QQbar[x]
True
```

Weird isn't it ?

The weirdness is really just limited to the difference in behaviour between these:

```
sage: AA['x'](var('x'))
x
sage: QQbar['x'](var('x'))
NotImplementedError: symbol
```
The thing that's failing in the latter case is

```
QQbar._element_constructor_(x)
```
and

```
AA._element_constructor_(x)
```
fails in exactly the same way. That suggest that in the case of `AA['x']` something is tried before resorting to the thing that fails for `QQbar['x']`.

For instance,

```
AA['y'](var('x'))
QQbar['y'](var('x'))
```
both (rightly) fail,but with significantly different tracebacks. This might give some indication of what is tried for `AA` but not for `QQbar`.

The thing that goes wrong is the following:

```
sage: S=QQbar['x']
sage: S.base_ring().has_coerce_map_from(SR)
True
```
Once this is found, it's clear how an element of `SR` should be converted into `QQbar['x']`: `SR` already coerces into `QQbar` itself, so we should just convert the element into a "constant polynomial".

Except, of course, that `SR` doesn't really coerce into `QQbar`: Only "constant" expressions might (and even then, of course `pi` doesn't), and `x` of course isn't one of those. So the proper solution is probably to NOT install a coercion from SR to QQbar, because it isn't a coercion anyway. It's only a partial map. Doing so is probably going to be painful for something else.

This problem doesn't arise for `AA` because it's pretty clear that not even algebraic elements fit in `AA`, so no coercion is installed.

I was going to report another problem caused by the bogus coercion from `SR`:

```
sage: CC.has_coerce_map_from(QQbar)
True
sage: QQbar.has_coerce_map_from(SR)
True
sage: CC.has_coerce_map_from(SR)
False
```
So I'm all in favor of removing it, even if it breaks stuff that should never have worked in the first place.

We might want to put (or actually put back?) a coercion in the other direction, since symbolic expressions can embed elements of `QQbar`. But `SR` has coerce maps from `RR`, `CC`, `RLF`, etc., which yield other coercions from `QQbar` by composition. Can we consider that all these maps are the same because they only differ in the "precision" of the result? Or should all coercions from inexact rings to `QQbar` be removed? (Note that the coercion from `QQ` to `SR` has exactly the same problem.)

As it turns out, it is possible to remove the coercion from `SR` to `QQbar` without breaking too many things. Moreover, most of the workarounds I had to add are there to deal with the case of `I` and will no longer be necessary once #5355 (or #12715) and/or #18036 are fixed (but I suggest we *dont't* wait fix this to happen).

You should get rid of the function `_late_import` since it is not used anymore. And it would be better to simplify the code of `_coerce_map_from_` as

```
return from_par == ZZ or from_par == QQ or from_par == int or \
       from_par == long or from_par == AA or from_par == QQbar
```
Moreover, I am not sure if coercion from `int/long` is necessary here since a conversion would exists through `ZZ`.

`AlgebraicNumber_base.__init__` also has a code path for `int` and `long` initializers, but they end up being converted to `ZZ`, so I guess it won't hurt to remove these cases. Done.
