This patch contains the basic classes for fundamental domains for Hilbert modular groups.
The main purpose of the implementation of these domains is a reduction procedure, which has applications to e.g.
reduction of hyper elliptic curves.
Almost everything in the fundamental_domain_nf_reduction.py is taken directly  from the file stoll_cremona.py in #14756.

This ticket depends on #14977
