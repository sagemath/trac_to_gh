This spkg does the following:
1. it compiles cliquer not only as an executable, but also as a library -- here I can't help but notice that the patches do to likewise in debian look more complete [see here](http://anonscm.debian.org/gitweb/?p=debian-science/packages/cliquer.git;a=tree;f=debian/patches;h=dd20b2cb0ea811e0036506c1468cc39367ec027e;hb=HEAD) (and remember than when the header of a debian patch doesn't mention forwarding to upstream -- that means it was!)
2. it modifies the api by making parse_input exported (non-static) -- was this forwarded upstream?
3. it adds new functions, only for sage
4. it uses `make` instead of `$MAKE`.
5. it has testing code inside `spkg-install` instead of `spkg-check`.

Please clarify how you would add these functions to Sage? They need access to the cliquer internals, so they cannot simply be added to Sage.

I don't remember the details, but I think it was a case of bad use of static variables ; so probably helping upstream get around that is a better route.

(That involves putting those variables in a params structure which gets passed around. Perhaps with some getter/setter api for the new structure.)

Most of the "global variables" aren't global but local to the compilation unit of the command line parser and only used to keep track of command line options. Its likely that one could just move the additional `sage_...` functions to an auxiliary source file in the Sage library.

Maybe we should get a GSoC student working on the build system to clean that up? :-P

Unless there is some action on this ticket soon I'll just take the current patch, add all currently untracked files to the repo, and use that for #14781

Hellooooooooo !!!

This patch probably needs to be rebased atop the nice additions of #15410, but would it also be possible to not create those two cl.c and cl.h files right inside of the graphs/ folder ? Could it be put inside of a cliquer/ folder, and couldn't it even stay inside of the spkg, even if it is not used to patch the sources but (nicely) imported at compile-time ?

The trick is nice and efficient, thanks for this patch `:-)`
