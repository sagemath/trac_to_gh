This spkg does the following:
1. it compiles cliquer not only as an executable, but also as a library -- here I can't help but notice that the patches do to likewise in debian look more complete [see here](http://anonscm.debian.org/gitweb/?p=debian-science/packages/cliquer.git;a=tree;f=debian/patches;h=dd20b2cb0ea811e0036506c1468cc39367ec027e;hb=HEAD) (and remember than when the header of a debian patch doesn't mention forwarding to upstream -- that means it was!)
2. it modifies the api by making parse_input exported (non-static) -- was this forwarded upstream?
3. it adds new functions, only for sage
4. it uses `make` instead of `$MAKE`.
5. it has testing code inside `spkg-install` instead of `spkg-check`.

Please clarify how you would add these functions to Sage? They need access to the cliquer internals, so they cannot simply be added to Sage.

<a id='comment:17'></a>Hellooooooooo !!!

This patch probably needs to be rebased atop the nice additions of #15410, but would it also be possible to not create those two cl.c and cl.h files right inside of the graphs/ folder ? Could it be put inside of a cliquer/ folder, and couldn't it even stay inside of the spkg, even if it is not used to patch the sources but (nicely) imported at compile-time ?

The trick is nice and efficient, thanks for this patch `:-)`
