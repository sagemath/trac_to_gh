** This ticket is now obsolete: see the metaticket #18528 instead **

This is the first draft of [SageManifolds](http://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr), a project to implement differential geometry and tensor calculus in Sage. It is still at a very early stage; current functionalities include:

* differentiable mappings and submanifolds
* standard tensor calculus (tensor product, contraction, (anti)symmetrization)
* exterior calculus (wedge product, exterior derivative of differential forms)
* Lie derivatives
* affine connections
* curvature and torsion
* pseudo-Riemannian metrics
* Hodge duality

More details on the page [http://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr](http://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr)

The package is still very preliminary. Future developments will focuss on
- the implementation of Sage !Parent/Element scheme for a better  integration in Sage
- adding new functionalities (e.g. extrinsic geometry of submanifolds, spinors)
- producing faster code by migrating some parts to Cython
Volunteers are welcome ! 

*Note (added on 18 Jul 2014):* this ticket contains now version 0.5 (in the associated git branch) and the attached spkg are obsolete.

*Note (added on 13 March 2015):* SageManifolds has been updated to [version 0.7](http://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/changelog.html); the git branch associated with this ticket is (provisory) obsolete; the ticket should be reorganized soon.

Hellooooooo guys !!

Very recently a very large amount of code dealing with matroids was accepted into Sage (#7477). This project had been developped outside of Sage for a while (it was 21 000 lines long), and the authors then wanted ot make it a real part of Sage.

The problem is that the source code that makes it into Sage normally gets reviewed before, and we were not able to review the matroids code as we usually do as it was really, really too large.
(And appeared to be VERY clean, too).
Now it appears that your code is already 16 000 lines long, and so it would be very very very nice if you could begin to think right now of how it should be split into small "reviewable" pieces if you ever want to have you code included into Sage, not as a spkg but as a real standard code.

I personally felt very guilty to see all this code make it into Sage without discussions and reviews `^^;`

Have fuuuuuuuuuuun anyway !!

Nathann

Dear Nathann,

I see your point. However note that it was difficult to submit the package at an earlier stage for it was very fluctuating: various trials were performed and new classes/functionalities were introduced and then removed. The current version is, I think, the first one showable and to be discussed. It can be considered as a more or less stable root for expanding the package.

+1. Larger/more experimental projects need a more nimble approach to experimenting and trying out their interface. Including little tidbits into sage early on takes away the ability to easily change API/interface/design (that's hard enough without all the bureaucracy the sage patch system imposes).

The development system of sage is geared towards stable, production quality code (regardless of whether that's attained), and that is incompatible with experimental, fast development.

I suspect we'd get the best quality if someone would first write a package independently (building on sage or another computer algebra system) and, once that system proves its worth, reimplement it as sage library code. The duplication of effort in that system is a bit unfortunate and, in practice, probably prohibitive. I don't think we know yet what the best solution is.

Note that for attracting funding, the "independent package" system is better: First you may be able to attract funding for developing a brand new package with revolutionary functionality. Later you can attract funding for ensuring that this revolutionary package gets integrated with other math software, so that it can interoperate with other systems. It also helps the authors more, because there's the independent entity to point to as accomplishment, rather than just an amorphous set of patches or files in the sage library.

Hi, 

We have released a new version (0.4) of SageManifolds. There are almost no new functionalities in this version, but the internal code has been seriously amended with respect to version 0.3. In particular the coordinate charts and the vector frames have been made hashable and are used as keys in various dictionaries (like the dictionary of sets of components of a given tensor field with respect to various vector frames).
Besides, Sage's Parent/Element scheme has been implemented for Domain/Point, with Domain in the category of Sets. 
For the end user, the main modification lies in a simplified syntax for chart and frame declarations. More in the [changelog](http://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/changelog.html). Example worksheets based of version 0.4 are [here](http://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/examples.html) and the main documentation is [here](http://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/documentation.html) (including the [reference manual](http://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/doc/sagemanifolds/index.html))

The sources of version 0.4 are available in the branch u/egourgoulhon/SageManifolds of trac.sagemath.org.

The development version is at [https://github.com/sagemanifolds/](https://github.com/sagemanifolds/) and can be installed according to these [instructions](http://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/install_from_git.txt).

Yes the ultimate goal is that it is fully integrated into Sage library. 
Indeed the attached spkg are obsolete.

The branch attached to this ticket is sticked to version 0.5 (until version 0.6 is released), while the github repository mentionned in [comment:15](#comment%3A15) contains the development version. See also the section "Installing the latest development version" in [his page](http://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/download.html). If you want version 0.5 only, `git trac checkout 14865` is indeed sufficient (after you have installed #15916 of course).
