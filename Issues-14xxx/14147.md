```
Given a weight in a root system of infinite type, the orbit method
tries to generate an infinite set and hangs.

sage: la = RootSystem(['A',1,1]).weight_lattice().fundamental_weight(0)
sage: la.orbit()

There are probably other similar infinite set issues throughout
root system code.

LGTM.

I wonder slightly if we want to make the `_orbit_iter()` public and redirect the user to that if they really do intend to work with the orbit in some finite/iterative way.
