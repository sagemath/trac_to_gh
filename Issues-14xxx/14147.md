<div id="comment:0"></div>

Given a weight in a root system of infinite type, the orbit method
tries to generate an infinite set and hangs.

sage: la = RootSystem(['A',1,1]).weight_lattice().fundamental_weight(0)
sage: la.orbit()

There are probably other similar infinite set issues throughout
root system code.
