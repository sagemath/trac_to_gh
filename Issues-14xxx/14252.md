This patch cleans up the interface of CrystalOfLSPaths. In particular, the input is now a weight, whereas before it took a cartan type and a list of coefficients. The class call function still allows this input format.

In addition, a new implementation of one-column Kirillov-Reshetikhin crystals is given in terms of level-zero CrystalOfLSPaths together with the energy function and one-dimensional configuration sum.



Depends on #14192

I propose the implementation of the crystal class 

CrystalOfProjectedLevelZeroLSPaths

that takes as input an affine Cartan type and an element of its
finite weight space.
The result should be paths in the finite weight space,
together with a function that can recover the head and tail energy.
These crystals should know that they are finite as well.

KirillovReshetikhinCrystalFromLSPaths can be an instance of it.

One could doctest CrystalOfProjectedLevelZeroLSPaths
by isomorphism with tensor products of its single-column versions.

Another interesting function would be to write the Naito-Sagaki lift from
KirillovReshetikhinCrystalFromLSPaths
to the level zero LS paths living in the level zero affine weight lattice
(with the null root). Perhaps that is the way the energy function should be
implemented.

Hi Mark,

Thanks for the comments! The CrystalOfProjectedLevelZeroLSPaths are now implemented and I added tests to compare with tensor products of KR crystals. The energy functions are still missing (but can be added).

Three more small things:

- On lines 50-52 of `littelmann_paths.py`, the extra lines to the inputs list need to be de-indented by 2 spaces (to line up with the first non-whitespace character of the item).
- On line 813, could you use the (relatively new) arXiv linking: <code>:arXiv:\`1211.6019\`</code>
- Should `KirillovReshetikhinCrystalFromLSPaths` be imported into the global namespace?

Other than those things, this is a positive review.

Best,

Travis

Done. I also changed the two things requested by e-mail.

Since the eventual aim is to link to this class from KirillovReshetikhinCrystal itself, I think it is better to leave it as is and not import this into the namespace for right now.
