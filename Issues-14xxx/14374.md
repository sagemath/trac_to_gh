Volker, #14292 (I have a patch but it's on sage.math which is currently offline) should ensure that the JSON file cannot be corrupted anymore. So, *if* we get an error loading the JSON file, it should be a genuine error and we want to get a doctest failure.

So we could close this one as duplicate of #14292.
