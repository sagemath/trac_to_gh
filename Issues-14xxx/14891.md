Thanks, looks solid. I have a few implementation suggestions to harmonize it with the way points are counted on elliptic curves. There, you'd write

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve([3,2])
sage: E.change_ring(GF(11)).count_points()
13
```
The Python convention is to use underscore as method names (like `count_points`)
and CamelCase for class names. 

* Use the current `base_ring()` to get the field over which to count points 
* Maybe take an optional integer argument `n` for finite fields with `p^n` elements, see the elliptic curve `count_points()` method.
* If the base ring is not finite, then raise a `TypeError`
* If the toric variety is not smooth, raise a `NotImplementedError` since one can presumably implement it later.

Also, the docstring should start with a short title like "Return the number of points" before any explanatory sentences. You can use dollar signs or backticks for math (like `$F_q$`), try building the documentation with `sage -docbuild all html`

Meaning you agree with changes and want to set it to "positive review"?

Please also take a look at what is changed and why (for why http://sagemath.org/doc/developer/conventions.html is a good reference together with links to PEP8 and PEP257). In addition to Volker's comments and the fact that documentation did not have correct syntax for compiling, there were too long lines (over 79 characters), inconsistent whitespacing, and creating variables for stuff that is used only once to get further stuff:

```
fan = self.fan() 
cones=fan.cones()
```
has no advantage over

```
cones = self.fan().cones()
```
but is longer, and if `cones` are used only once, even better to plug `self.fan().cones()` directly there. (I may have overdone it with folding into 2 lines only, but original 10 were a bit over verbose.)
