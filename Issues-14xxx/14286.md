This test sometimes fails and should be removed, since it doesn't really test anything anyway:

```
sage -t --long devel/sage/sage/misc/getusage.py
**********************************************************************
File "devel/sage/sage/misc/getusage.py", line 107, in sage.misc.getusage.get_memory_usage
Failed example:
    get_memory_usage(t)
Expected:
    0.0
Got:
    -0.015625
**********************************************************************
```
or

```
sage -t --long devel/sage/sage/misc/getusage.py
**********************************************************************
File "devel/sage/sage/misc/getusage.py", line 107, in sage.misc.getusage.get_memory_usage
Failed example:
    get_memory_usage(t)
Expected:
    0.0
Got:
    0.015625
**********************************************************************
