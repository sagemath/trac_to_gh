`SkewTableau` should follow the same the conventions set in `Tableaux.global_options` for the method `.pp()`.  In particular, it should follow `convention="French"` displayed in reverse order.  This should be changed in the method `_repr_diagram`

I'm a little confused about what options are set where.

```
sage: SkewTableaux.global_options(latex="list")
...
ValueError: latex is not an option for skew tableaux
```
gives a traceback error.

That should read "list is not an option ..."

```
sage: Tableaux.global_options(display="diagram")
sage: SkewTableau([[None,1],[2]])
[[None, 1], [2]]
sage: SkewTableaux.global_options(display="diagram")
sage: SkewTableau([[None,1],[2]])
  .  1
  2
sage: SkewTableaux.global_options(display="compact")
...
ValueError: compact is not a valid value for display in the options for skew tableaux
```
I wouldn't know to look for the global options in `SkewTableaux` to set the diagram display given that "convention" and "latex" options can be set in `Tableaux.global_options`

Shouldn't they consistently follow a single global options?

Hey Mike,

Is everything that you'd want done taken care of in #14101? If so, we should set this to positive review.
