Currently, it is only implemented for ranked posets. This is, for posets admitting a rank function that is 0 on minimal elements and an upwards cover relations increases the rank by 1.

More generally, one can define more generally the rank of an element in a poset to be the distance  (in the graph sense of the Hasse diagram) to a minimal element. For this, every element should be supposed to have finite distance. In ranked posets, this is equivalent to the above definition.

Either way, your disjoint union of two chains of different lengths is therefore not rank-symmetric (the rank sizes are 2,2,...,2,1,...,1 with the number of 2's being the minimal of the two lengths, and the number of 1's being max-min.

I'd (obviously) be happy if you would take over this ticket!

Thanks, Christian

See the attached patch above, which is basically
`L = [len(x) for x in P.level_sets()]`
`return all( L[i] == L[-i-1] for i in range(len(L)/2))`

But I do not know whether level sets are given for non-ranked posets...

Level sets are defined on every poset, or actually on every acyclic digraph.

But still I don't know what is wanted. For example `Poset({0:[1,2], 1:[3], 3:[4], 4:[5], 6:[5]})` is ranked, is it rank-symmetric? For now only connected graded posets seems to have clear definition of what is rank-symmetry.

Side-note about graded vs. ranked: #16998.

You seems to already have working code. There is of course also many other ways to do it, for example to start with

```
L=P._hasse_diagram._rank_dict.values()
D=dict((i, L.count(i)) for i in L)
```

and so on. But if you do not know this to be time-critical, then don't bother with those. Just write an explanation of what function does and give some examples and non-examples of rank-symmetric poset. They are the hardest part with functions like this.

When then function is only defined to some specific type of posets, it should start with

```
if not self.is_graded() or not self.is_connected():
    raise ValueError("Rank symmetry is only defined for connected graded posets.")
```

1) in the raise statements, I would replace

```
the poset is assumed to be connected
```
by

```
the poset is not connected
```
and same for graded condition

2) the doc is not consistent with the code, symmetry should be between i and h-i-1

3) please use backticks instead of $

4) do not compute twice len(levels)
