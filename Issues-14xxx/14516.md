In order to speed up many of the crystals computations, I'm proposing the following:

- Cythonize `CrystalOfLetters`
- Make `index_set()` a cached method. Subsequently this requires it to be returned as a tuple instead of a list
- Make different letters classes, one for integers (classical types), one for tuples (exceptional/spin)
- Store by caching result of `_element_constructor_()` the elements of `CrystalOfLetters`.

See #14686 for a followup.
