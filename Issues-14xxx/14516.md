In order to speed up many of the crystals computations, I'm proposing the following:

- Cythonize `CrystalOfLetters`
- Make `index_set()` a cached method. Subsequently this requires it to be returned as a tuple instead of a list
- Make different letters classes, one for integers (classical types), one for tuples (exceptional/spin)
- Store by caching result of `_element_constructor_()` the elements of `CrystalOfLetters`.

See #14686 for a followup.

Here are some timings.

With the patch:

```
sage: B = InfinityCrystalOfTableaux(['B',3])
sage: S = B.subcrystal(max_depth=4)
sage: %time G = B.digraph(subset=S)
CPU times: user 19.55 s, sys: 0.62 s, total: 20.17 s
Wall time: 21.80 s

sage: C = CrystalOfTableaux(['D',4], shape=[2,1])
sage: %time G = C.digraph()
CPU times: user 0.30 s, sys: 0.06 s, total: 0.36 s
Wall time: 0.45 s
```

Before:

```

sage: S = B.subcrystal(max_depth=4)
sage: %time G = B.digraph(subset=S)
CPU times: user 48.83 s, sys: 1.42 s, total: 50.24 s
Wall time: 58.49 s

<a id='comment:2'>**Comment 2:**</a>
I'm also getting significant speedups now in creating `CrystalOfLetters` and doctests for `tensor_product.py` and `kirillov_reshetikhin.py`:

```
sage: %time C = CrystalOfLetters(['D',100])
CPU times: user 0.84 s, sys: 0.24 s, total: 1.08 s
Wall time: 1.67 s

sage -t tensor_product.py
    [349 tests, 13.05 s]
sage -t kirillov_reshetikhin.py
    [653 tests, 30.51 s]
```
Before:

```
sage: %time C = CrystalOfLetters(['D',100])
CPU times: user 2.33 s, sys: 0.42 s, total: 2.76 s
Wall time: 3.58 s

sage -t tensor_product.py
    [349 tests, 14.60 s]
sage -t kirillov_reshetikhin.py
    [653 tests, 47.96 s]

With patch:

```
sage: %time C = CrystalOfLetters(['D',100])
CPU times: user 1.54 s, sys: 0.03 s, total: 1.56 s
Wall time: 1.72 s

sage: B = InfinityCrystalOfTableaux(['B',3])
sage: S = B.subcrystal(max_depth=4)
sage: %time G = B.digraph(subset=S)

CPU times: user 0.33 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.34 s
Wall time: 0.34 s
```
Before:

```
sage: %time C = CrystalOfLetters(['D',100])
CPU times: user 1.84 s, sys: 0.02 s, total: 1.86 s
Wall time: 2.00 s

sage: B = InfinityCrystalOfTableaux(['B',3])
sage: S = B.subcrystal(max_depth=4)
sage: sage: %time G = B.digraph(subset=S)
CPU times: user 28.96 s, sys: 0.03 s, total: 28.99 s
Wall time: 29.94 s

sage: C = CrystalOfTableaux(['D',4], shape=[2,1])
sage: %time G = C.digraph()
CPU times: user 0.39 s, sys: 0.01 s, total: 0.40 s
Wall time: 0.39 s
```

So currently I'm seeing small performance gains, the bigger ones are likely going to come from #14686.
