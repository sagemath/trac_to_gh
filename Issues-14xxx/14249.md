We currently have

```
  sage: from sage.structure.element import ModuleElement
  sage: class MyElement(ModuleElement):
  ....:     def __init__(self, x, y, parent=None):
  ....:         ModuleElement.__init__(self, parent)
  ....:     def _mul_(self, other):
  ....:         return self

  ....:     def _lmul_(self, other):
  ....:         return self
  ....:
  sage: class MyParent(Parent):
  ....:     Element = MyElement
  ....:
  sage: P = MyParent(category=Rings())
  sage: P(1,2)
  Generic element of a structure
  sage: a = _
  sage: a*2
  Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
  NotImplementedError: please implement _an_element_ for <class '__main__.MyParent_with_category'>
```

I find this very annoying.

The background is that the coercion model tries to get a multiplication action, namely `RightModuleAction`. During initialisation of the module action, some sanity tests are performed. In particular, an element of the acting parent and the acted-upon set are taken and the action called on these two elements.

Problem: Where to get the two elements from? Currently, they are gotten from the method `an_element()`, which in turn relies on `_an_element_()` being implemented if the default implementation is not good enough (which is the case in the example above).

But normally, we do not want to have the `RightModuleAction` just out of the blue: Typically (in the example above, at least), we want to create it during the first multiplication. And in that moment we *do* have two elements.

So, I propose to make it possible to pass the two elements being multiplied to the constructor of `Left/RightModuleAction`, and let `an_element()` be called *only* if no element is passed.

I am afraid that my patch touches parent.pxd and thus forces rebuilding most of Sage.

Anyway. If an action of one parent on some object is requested *during arithmetic operations*, then the coercion model will now use the two given elements to construct/test an action, rather than calling an_element() of the parent and the object, which might not always be available.

My patch uncovered a bug in sage/schemes/hyperelliptic_curves/jacobian_morphism.py: An `IntegerMulAction` was to be created, but for testing it, `m+(-m)` is attempted for the given element m. But the involved element used to raise an error on `-m`.

So, that's an independent bug, which I fixed in #14264.

Isn't it a logical flaw that there should even be elements for an action to exist? I think it's entirely possible to have a group acting on an empty set. In fact, in number theory these things often arise. If C is a smooth projective genus 1 curve then it is a torsor under its jacobian E. This gives a functorial way for E(k) to act on C(k), for any extension k of the field of definition. In the interesting cases, C(k) is empty, so you have a finitely generated group E(k) acting on the empty set C(k).

This particular scenario isn't particularly relevant for the coercion framework, but it does show that actions on empty sets are natural to consider, so if we're not supporting that, there may be something wrong with our model.

Can't we just ditch the sanity check (or skip it if an element isn't easily obtained)?

For *general* actions I agree. But:
 
> This particular scenario isn't particularly relevant for the coercion framework, but it does show that actions on empty sets are natural to consider, so if we're not supporting that, there may be something wrong with our model.


Don't forget that what we are talking about here is in sage.structure.coerce_actions. So, this *is* for coercions, and it *is* to be applied to elements.

sage.categories.action is of course more general.

> Can't we just ditch the sanity check (or skip it if an element isn't easily obtained)?


Part of the problem is that we have different ways to define an action on elements. There is _rmul_/_lmul_, there is _l_action/_r_action (at least according to sage.structure.coerce_actions, but it isn't used in sage.structure.coerce), there is _act_on_, and there is _acted_upon_. Moreover, there is `IntegerMulAction`. And since they are all acting *on elements*, I think it somehow does make sense to test which of the different flavours is available for the elements.

Hey Simon,

Some minor things:

- Line 78 of `parent.pyx` needs the double colon `::`.
- Could you use the python 3 syntax for the exceptions on lines 332 and 336 of `coerce_actions.pyx`? (`raise CoercionException("msg")`)
- Use the new line continuations `....:` in `parent.pyx`.

Thanks,

Travis
