On some outputs, the top of the square root sign isn't visible with the "Typeset" checkbox, but does work with `show`. The attached screenshot shows the issue.

This is a problem because some expressions become ambiguous; in the screenshot `sqrt(x^2 + 3)` and `sqrt(x^2) + 3` cannot be distinguished.
