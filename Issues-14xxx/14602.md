The ticket stands to improve the `AlgebraicConverter` in `sage.symbolic.expression_converters` and make it works with number fields.

As mentioned on [ask](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/2581/convert-expression-to-quadraticfield) the following fails

```
sage: K = QuadraticField(3)
sage: K(sqrt(3))
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: ...
```
The following gives an answer with a wrong parent

```
sage: x = K(3)**(1/2); x
sqrt(3)
sage: a.parent()
Symbolic Ring
```
while it is possible to do

```
sage: y = K(3).sqrt(); y
a
sage: y == K.gen()
True
```
Finally, we hopefully have

```
sage: K.gen() == sqrt(3)
sqrt(3) == sqrt(3)
sage: bool(K.gen() == sqrt(3))
True
```

The PR adds doctests. Note that we still have

```
sage: (K(3)^(1/2)).parent()                                                  
Symbolic Ring
```
That seems ok to me, but if the parent should be `K`, then I think another ticket should be opened. (The parent of `sqrt(K(3))` is `K`, and is one of the new doctests.)
