Preliminary spkg, please torture it but nothing is commited or documented, I'll try to do that over the week end but as it may not happen here is some stuff to test.

In particular it should (not tested!) work:
* for non-threaded libraries anywhere, especially on computers with a single threaded unique core,
* threaded on debian/sparc,
* threaded on debian/powerpc,
whereas it used not to before.
(I just remembered that "-t 0" is passed to configure in spkg-install so threads will always be disabled unless you change that.)

I really uploaded that in a hurry.
And it's not intended to always disable threading all the time in the final version.
It is just what I was testing and forgot to comment again the "-t 0" line before uploading...
