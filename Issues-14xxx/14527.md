This patch fixes a minor memory leak in the chromatic polynomial code. It appears to me that the mpz variables should be freed at the end of the function.

I have also added additional tests.

The code appears not to be practical for graphs of order +15. I am wondering if we could gain some speed by using memoization. It would complicate the code quite a bit but it might be a drastic improvement!

m is a single mpz_t variable and is correctly freed in this patch. As for coeffs[i] you're right - nice catch. That should be freed as well IMO.

I've attached a patch fixing this remark as well. Can you check if it makes sense to stack patches like that?

PS. What is the status of the edge contraction code? I would like to test this memonization thing that I talk about..

Yeah it does. We do it often when we use Mercurial Queue, but if you don't perhaps it is not worth trying it... considering that we will switch to git soon (wheeeeeeeeeen ??)

The status ? Well, it has been there for years and never touched again :

Interesting. What is the reason for switching to Git? Its because Linus uses it right???

Nonono not this! I was asking about the code that you guys were doing that allows *contracting* an edge of a graph. I am not sure this thing was accepted yet?

I understand yes. Somehow I was thought to always extensively and insanely test software. The fact that i use this for research made me exaggerate even more.

I still think that's the way to go but I completely agree with you that in the current setting this might not be the best way to go :-)

From my point of view, it is because some Sage developpers think that it is great. And I've been contaminated by their enthusiasm, even though I barely used it `:-P`

Oh. I don't know where it stands. I hate that patch. But honestly, if you want efficient code, rewrite your own. It is not a long code anyway.

Yes but I just wanted to quickly test something and not bother writing an edge contraction routine :-/ Do you happen to be able to extract that quickly from the patch or something? I just need to be able to contract an edge of a graph (ignoring loops & multiple edges)
