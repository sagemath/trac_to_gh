Is this going to break anything?  There are probably at least a few "help" questions where spgk/logs is listed as the place to look.  I assume that no one wants it to be in both, of course.

Also, does `make test` still work, though, and put a log somewhere?  Is that still documented anywhere, or was the README the last place?  

Just checking in both cases, I presume by default these are silly questions.

If anything, `logs/pkgs` should be easier to find than `spkg/logs`. And also, when building fails, the error message is now a lot more clear.

> Also, does `make test` still work, though, and put a log somewhere?

Yes, but see #14328 for this (it is unrelated to this ticket, which deals with logs of building packages).

> Is that still documented anywhere

Not that I know.
