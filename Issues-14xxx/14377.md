If anything, `logs/pkgs` should be easier to find than `spkg/logs`. And also, when building fails, the error message is now a lot more clear.

Yes, but see #14328 for this (it is unrelated to this ticket, which deals with logs of building packages).

> Is that still documented anywhere

Not that I know.
