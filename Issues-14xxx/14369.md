For the record: Running `sage -t -optional -long` on a .py file does not work anymore, but used to work under sage-5.8. I tried to change this into `sage -t --optional --long`, but it does not work either.

It would be less disappointing if the changes in the doctesting framework would somehow be documented, or if at least the doctesting framework would give a hint what it is complaining about. All I get is

```
Running doctests with ID 2013-04-26-16-31-00-2eee1fc7.
Doctesting 1 file.
sage -t /home/simon/.sage/temp/linux-sqwp.site/11900/dir_vpH6Jb/file_5.py
    [0 tests, 0.00 s]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Total time for all tests: 0.0 seconds
    cpu time: 0.0 seconds
    cumulative wall time: 0.0 seconds

```
i.e., the tests are not even attempted to run, but it is reported that the tests pass.

I guess running `sage -t -optional=all -long ...` might be a solution.
