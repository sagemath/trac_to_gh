#9128 enabled links to the reference manual from other documents like the thematic tutorials. 
This import feature is currently broken. Until this is fixed, the updated thematic tutorial index from #14090 will look lame.

The issue to be due to a wrong initialization order for the sphinx app. At least the attached patch, which I am using for now for the Sage-Combinat tutorials, seems to work around it. Probably the sphinx internals were change in the mean time. #13057 may have had an influence too.

Note: I am not suggesting to merge or review the currently attached patch. It's just there to point where the problem seem to be.

<div id="comment:5" align="right">comment:5</div>

This seems to be fixed now. See e.g. the crosslink "Introduction to combinatorics in Sage" which points to the reference manual in:

http://www.sagemath.org/doc/thematic_tutorials/index.html

I thus mark this ticket as duplicate. If anyone has an idea of when this was fixed, it would be good to add a ref.
