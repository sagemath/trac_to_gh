The changes in #14499 introduce some failures in optional doctests.  The first one should be checked and fixed; the other two come from deprecation warnings.

```
$sage -t --long --optional=sage,gap_packages sage/combinat/designs/design_catalog.py

**********************************************************************

    Incidence structure with 24 points and 759 blocks

p.s.  Without the deprecation warning, I would have had a tough time figuring out where the first failure was coming from.  Thanks for the hint!!
