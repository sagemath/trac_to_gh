This patch caches all methods in KirillovReshetikhin crystals that compute crystal morphisms. This yields a significant speed-up of all methods involving the affine crystal operators.

With the patch applied:

```
sage: K = KirillovReshetikhinCrystal(['C',3,1],1,1)
sage: L = KirillovReshetikhinCrystal(['C',3,1],2,2)
sage: %timeit f = K.R_matrix(L)
5 loops, best of 3: 3.86 s per loop
```
Without the patch applied:

```
Loading Sage library. Current Mercurial branch is: combinat
sage: K = KirillovReshetikhinCrystal(['C',3,1],1,1)
sage: sage: L = KirillovReshetikhinCrystal(['C',3,1],2,2)
sage: sage: %timeit f = K.R_matrix(L)
5 loops, best of 3: 96.2 s per loop
```

It also fixes a doctest failure in /category/crystals.py

Does this also speed up the type `['D', n, 1]` spin KR crystals (right now they take a long time because `promotion_on_highest_weight_vectors()` iterates over the entire crystal and is called 3 times)?

Also, for the `index_set()` method in `categories/crystals.py`, could we change it so that it returns `self._cartan_type.index_set()`? It seems that `CrystalOfTableaux` is the only crystal which directly implements `cartan_matrix()` and does not have the `_cartan_matrix` attribute.

> Does this also speed up the type `['D', n, 1]` spin KR crystals (right now they take a long time because `promotion_on_highest_weight_vectors()` iterates over the entire crystal and is called 3 times)?

Yes, they should all be faster now. Before the patch

```
sage: K = KirillovReshetikhinCrystal(['D',4,1],4,1)
sage: L = KirillovReshetikhinCrystal(['D',4,1],3,1)
sage: %timeit L.R_matrix(K)
5 loops, best of 3: 186 ms per loop
sage: L = KirillovReshetikhinCrystal(['D',4,1],3,3)
sage: %timeit L.R_matrix(K)
5 loops, best of 3: 8.54 s per loop
```
After the patch

```
sage: K = KirillovReshetikhinCrystal(['D',4,1],4,1)
sage: L = KirillovReshetikhinCrystal(['D',4,1],3,1)
sage: %timeit L.R_matrix(K)
5 loops, best of 3: 763 ns per loop
sage: L = KirillovReshetikhinCrystal(['D',4,1],3,3)
sage: %timeit L.R_matrix(K)
5 loops, best of 3: 811 ns per loop
```

I can cache index_set, which should make it faster.

In fact, this breaks some doc tests since caching an object that is not immutable is dangerous. Unless there is really a significant speedup, I won't make this change for now.

Sorry, I wasn't specific enough. I meant their creation. I did some tests now that I have the patch (I wrote that comment last night before you had posted the patch).

Before patch:

```
sage: %time C = KirillovReshetikhinCrystal(['D',4,1], 3,3)
CPU times: user 4.89 s, sys: 0.41 s, total: 5.30 s
Wall time: 5.90 s
```
After patch:

```
sage: %time C = KirillovReshetikhinCrystal(['D',4,1], 3,3)
CPU times: user 2.11 s, sys: 0.28 s, total: 2.39 s
Wall time: 4.27 s
```
So it does help, but they still take a long time to initialize compared to their counterparts. However this can be an issue for another ticket.

As for the caching of the `index_set()`, the problem is (as you stated) this returns a mutable list rather than an immutable tuple. I tried doing this once and from what I recall, the rigged configurations code broke because it does something like

```
I = self.index_set()
I.pop(0)
```
which would have to be tweaked to

```
I = self.index_set()[1:]
```
but IDK if this behavior occurs anywhere else.

Thanks,

Travis

Yes, this also occurs in tensor_product in /combinat/crystals

by the way be safer w.r.t. affine types where the special node would
not be 0).
