Followup to #14516 which does the following:

- Instead of `e()`, `f()`, `epsilon()`, `phi()` checking the index set each time, these functions will check to make sure i is in the index set, then call `_e()`, `_f()`, `_epsilon()`, `_phi()` which assume i is valid input and respectively call the private methods.


Depends on #14516
