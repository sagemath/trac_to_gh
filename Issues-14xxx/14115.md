Consider the following

```
sage: x=PowerSeriesRing(QQ,'x').gen()
sage: x.exp()                        
1 + x + 1/2*x^2 + 1/6*x^3 + 1/24*x^4 + 1/120*x^5 + 1/720*x^6 + 1/5040*x^7 + 1/40320*x^8 + 1/362880*x^9 + 1/3628800*x^10 + 1/39916800*x^11 + 1/479001600*x^12 + 1/6227020800*x^13 + 1/87178291200*x^14 + 1/1307674368000*x^15 + 1/20922789888000*x^16 + 1/355687428096000*x^17 + 1/6402373705728000*x^18 + 1/121645100408832000*x^19 + O(x^20)
sage: x.log()
AttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)
...
AttributeError: 'sage.rings.power_series_poly.PowerSeries_poly' object has no attribute 'log'
```

I think it would be good to have log if one has exp, in order to be able to go back and forth. Of course, one should check that the constant term is 1.

Here is a patch that does the job.

Hey Frederic,

Looks good. I've uploaded a small review patch which tweaks the documentation. If you agree with my changes, go ahead and set this to positive review.

Best,
