The cycle index series of a species is a symmetric function in the power-sum basis. Expanding this symmetric function in a set of underlying variables can reveal interesting enumerative information about the species; the coefficients of this underlying power series count "partially-labeled" structures in a PÃ³lya-theoretic sense.

The attached patch adds an ``expand_as_sf`` method to the ``CycleIndexSeries`` class which performs this expansion. It essentially just calls the ``expand`` method of the underlying symmetric functions, then uses the result as the terms of a ``LazyPowerSeries``.

This code is doctested and ready for review.

I checked that the output of this function on a few examples agrees with the data from Table 4.1 (Cycle index series of particular species) from Bergeron, Labelle and Leroux's book "Combinatorial Species and Tree-Like Structures", so I believe that it's mathematically correct.

Also, the commit message issue is now fixed.

The only potential problem is the patchbot's startup_time plugin which failed in the latest round of testing. However, the patch only adds a small method to an existing class, so I can't believe that it would really cause a speed regression.

Positive review!
