The second "huge" database spkg:

http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/vbraun/spkg/polytopes_db_4d-1.0.spkg
http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/vbraun/spkg/polytopes_db_4d-1.0.md5


* William says its fine to host on UW servers
* The "huge" spkgs are not mirrored, so no issue there either

The interface to the database is in #12553, but its not a dependency.
