Hey Frederic,

For those blocks which are complete sentences (lines 23 and 33), I think it would be better to have a whitespace before the double colon `::` since this would cause a colon to be outputted in the doc (if it was ever built, but that won't happen until the file is linked).

Part of me would like to see this file brought up to ReST standards while we are going through its doc, but I don't know if we will ever link this file into the doc. If you don't think it's worthwhile, you can set this to positive review after you put in the aforementioned whitespace.

Thanks,

Travis

I have added one of the required whitespace, and remove a dot before the other "::"

I have also added a few "r" to prepare for Rest markup.
