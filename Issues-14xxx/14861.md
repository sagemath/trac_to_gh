There seems to be no hope for the last remaining three broken links. Possible choices are

- let the patch enter as it is   :-)
- remove the three broken links instead of keeping them
- let the patch be forgotten and rot  :-(

What do you think ?

I would prefer to clean all links. What do you think about writing an explicit **dead link** in the manual?

For the link for Kuen's surface in `parametric_plot3d`, there are lots of choices, for example http://virtualmathmuseum.org/Surface/kuen/kuen.html (or http://mathworld.wolfram.com/KuenSurface.html, if we want to link to Wolfram ;).

I think that the link for `graphs/generators/basic` should be http://www.orgnet.com/sna.html.

I don't know what to do about the link in `implicit_plot3d`, maybe just delete it altogether:

It doesn't take much searching to figure out that it's highly likely that [Kathryn Summers](http://www.ubalt.edu/cas/faculty/alphabetical-directory/kathryn-summers.cfm) is probably connected to it.  In fact, her research looks kind of interesting - how do people with 8th-grade reading skills (or below) navigate the text-heavy web?  

The [web archive](http://web.archive.org/web/20080529033738/http://iat.ubalt.edu/summers/math/platsol.htm) helps us more - apparently the originator of the graphic (not created in Sage, though) is [Douglas Summers-Stay](https://plus.google.com/116294795843827001984/posts).  Or at least that's where we found it.
