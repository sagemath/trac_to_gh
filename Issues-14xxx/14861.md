Great job !

I guess the last one is a dead end as everything was moved into Sage but there is still http://arxiv.org/abs/0710.1835 which is much more reliable then a link to a web page.

For the link for Kuen's surface in `parametric_plot3d`, there are lots of choices, for example http://virtualmathmuseum.org/Surface/kuen/kuen.html (or http://mathworld.wolfram.com/KuenSurface.html, if we want to link to Wolfram ;).

I think that the link for `graphs/generators/basic` should be http://www.orgnet.com/sna.html.

I don't know what to do about the link in `implicit_plot3d`, maybe just delete it altogether:

It doesn't take much searching to figure out that it's highly likely that [Kathryn Summers](http://www.ubalt.edu/cas/faculty/alphabetical-directory/kathryn-summers.cfm) is probably connected to it.  In fact, her research looks kind of interesting - how do people with 8th-grade reading skills (or below) navigate the text-heavy web?  

The [web archive](http://web.archive.org/web/20080529033738/http://iat.ubalt.edu/summers/math/platsol.htm) helps us more - apparently the originator of the graphic (not created in Sage, though) is [Douglas Summers-Stay](https://plus.google.com/116294795843827001984/posts).  Or at least that's where we found it.  It would be nice for us to acknowledge this somehow, and I feel like either it should be dealt with on this ticket *or* that deletion should not take place here and a new ticket should be opened.
