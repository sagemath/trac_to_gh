There seems to be no hope for the last remaining three broken links. Possible choices are

- let the patch enter as it is   :-)
- remove the three broken links instead of keeping them
- let the patch be forgotten and rot  :-(

What do you think ?

I would prefer to clean all links. What do you think about writing an explicit **dead link** in the manual?

For the link for Kuen's surface in `parametric_plot3d`, there are lots of choices, for example http://virtualmathmuseum.org/Surface/kuen/kuen.html (or http://mathworld.wolfram.com/KuenSurface.html, if we want to link to Wolfram ;).

I think that the link for `graphs/generators/basic` should be http://www.orgnet.com/sna.html.

I don't know what to do about the link in `implicit_plot3d`, maybe just delete it altogether:

It doesn't take much searching to figure out that it's highly likely that [Kathryn Summers](http://www.ubalt.edu/cas/faculty/alphabetical-directory/kathryn-summers.cfm) is probably connected to it.  In fact, her research looks kind of interesting - how do people with 8th-grade reading skills (or below) navigate the text-heavy web?
