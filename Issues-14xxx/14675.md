Somebody that was using finitely presented groups pointed me the following behaviour (which was very confusing for him):

```
sage: F1.<a,b,c>=FreeGroup()
sage: F2.<a,b>=FreeGroup()
sage: r=a*b/a
sage: r.parent()
Free Group on generators {a, b}
sage: r in F1
True
sage: F1/[r]

```

This is because the relations are not converted to the free group.

This patch just converts the relations to the parent, solving this and, besides, allowing things like 

```
sage: F1/[[1,2,3,-1,-2,-3],[1,3]]
Finitely presented group < a, b, c | a*b*c*a^-1*b^-1*c^-1, a*c >
```

This ticket prompts the following question:

```
sage: F1.<a> = FreeGroup()
sage: F2.<b> = FreeGroup()
sage: F1.quotient([b])
Finitely presented group < a | a >
```

Should this be the intended behavior, or should the user get a warning about `b` not being a generator of `F1`.

Perhaps this is the root cause:

```
sage: F1(b)
a
```

```
sage: F.<a,b>=FreeGroup()

sage: F(a)

The reason is that FreeGroup._self_element_constructor_ just considers the Tietze list of the argument, and constructs the element of self with the same list.

Definitely another ticket - the wording here just suggested the experiment so I tossed it on.  Let's not add anymore to this.  Let me know if you want me to initiate a ticket (though, I won't be writing the fix).
