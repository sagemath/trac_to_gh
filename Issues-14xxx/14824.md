This patch provides a method `frobenius_endomorphism` which returns the Frobenius endomorphism of a p-adic field.

Here is a small demo:

```
sage: K.<a> = Qq(5^3)
sage: Frob = K.frobenius_endomorphism()

sage: Frob
Frobenius endomorphism on Unramified Extension of 5-adic ... lifting a |--> a^5 on the residue field
sage: Frob^12
Identity endomorphism of Unramified Extension of 5-adic Field ...

sage: Frob(a) = a.frobenius()
True
```

* Why do you need to store `_degree_fixed`?
* There are a couple functions without doctests, and the implementation of hash can be easily improved (use power rather than the string representation).

Oops. It was because I was first planning to implement a method `fixed_points` but then I gave up. It seems that I forgot to remode `_degree_fixed`.

> * There are a couple functions without doctests, and the implementation of hash can be easily improved (use power rather than the string representation).

Done.

Fixed.
