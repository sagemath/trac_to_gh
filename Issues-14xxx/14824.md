This patch provides a method `frobenius_endomorphism` which returns the Frobenius endomorphism of a p-adic field.

Here is a small demo:

```
sage: K.<a> = Qq(5^3)
sage: Frob = K.frobenius_endomorphism()

sage: Frob
Frobenius endomorphism on Unramified Extension of 5-adic ... lifting a |--> a^5 on the residue field
sage: Frob^12
Identity endomorphism of Unramified Extension of 5-adic Field ...

sage: Frob(a) = a.frobenius()
True
```

Keywords: **Frobenius**
