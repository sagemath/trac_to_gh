What is the purpose of the unique non docstring line in the file ?

Vincent, that line was generated automatically by `sage -preparse domaines_doctests.sage`,
which is the way we produce the `xxx_doctests.py` file from `xxx_doctests.sage`.
Does it hurt?

Or you may modify the polynom to something invariant under permutation like `(x1 - x2)^2*(x1 - x3)^2*(x1 - x4)^2*(x2 - x3)^2*(x2 - x4)^2*(x3 - x4)^2` (which makes sense as Jeroen pointed out, subset are not ordered).
