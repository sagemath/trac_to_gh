Looks good to me.

What is the purpose of the unique non docstring line in the file ?

```
from sage.all_cmdline import *   # import sage library

Works fine with Sage 5.11, thus ready to review. See also #10983.

Vincent, that line was generated automatically by `sage -preparse domaines_doctests.sage`,
which is the way we produce the `xxx_doctests.py` file from `xxx_doctests.sage`.
Does it hurt?

If you care about ordering, use `itertools.combinations` instead of `Subsets`:

```
sage: from itertools import combinations
sage: list(combinations([x1,x2,x3,x4],2))
[(x1, x2), (x1, x3), (x1, x4), (x2, x3), (x2, x4), (x3, x4)]

the new patch checks whether the product equals `(x1 - x2)*(x1 - x3)*(x1 - x4)*(x2 - x3)*(x2 - x4)*(x3 - x4)` or its opposite.

Or you may modify the polynom to something invariant under permutation like `(x1 - x2)^2*(x1 - x3)^2*(x1 - x4)^2*(x2 - x3)^2*(x2 - x4)^2*(x3 - x4)^2` (which makes sense as Jeroen pointed out, subset are not ordered).

good idea, but since the book is already published, I prefer not to change the input.
