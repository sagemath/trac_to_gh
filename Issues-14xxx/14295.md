This is because on Solaris, a couple of C math functions get overloaded in C++ (and Solaris' math headers put them into the global namespace).

### singular-3-1-5.p5 (Leif Leonhardy, March 18th 2013)
* #14295: Singular fails to build with GCC 4.7.x on Solaris.
  On Solaris, with `__cplusplus >= 199711L`, `floor()` and `log10()` are
  overloaded functions which get pulled into the global namespace,
  such that calling them with an `int` gets ambiguous.
  Patch `kernel/bigintmat.cc` (`patches/sage_trac_14295.patch`)
  to cast parameters to `floor()` and `log10()` from `int` to
  `double`, making the calls unambiguous.
