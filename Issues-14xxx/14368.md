The Dirichlet group of modulus 1 should consist of the trivial character. 
Something in the .list() generator seems to be broken in this case and it returns a character which takes the value 0 instead of 1.
However, note that list(D) works as expected and allegedly list(D)[0] is equal to D.list()[0]. 

```python
sage: D=DirichletGroup(1)
sage: D.list()[0](1)
0
sage: list(D)[0](1)
1
sage: D.list()[0]==list(D)[0]
True
```

That said, this would definitely be a bug!

I actually forgot to check reproducibility.
And in fact I seem to only be able to reproduce this in Sage 5.8 (compiled from source, on  Fedora 17 with kernel 3.7.9-104) in my office after running (or at least initializing) some of my psage code.
It works as it should on Sage 5.8 on my laptop (also from source on ubuntu 12.04 with kernel 3.2.0-39).

I guess it was just a fluke. I will recompile everything (including sage) and see if I still have the problem. Otherwise I should probably just close the ticket.

For example, on mod.math.washington.edu with Sage 5.8 (the standard install in /usr/local/bin/) I get:
