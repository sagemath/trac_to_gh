The Dirichlet group of modulus 1 should consist of the trivial character. 
Something in the .list() generator seems to be broken in this case and it returns a character which takes the value 0 instead of 1.
However, note that list(D) works as expected and allegedly list(D)[0] is equal to D.list()[0]. 

```python
sage: D=DirichletGroup(1)
sage: D.list()[0](1)
0
sage: list(D)[0](1)
1
sage: D.list()[0]==list(D)[0]
True
```

I don't get this in Sage 5.7 or Sage 5.9.beta1.  What is your platform, what version of Sage are you using, etc?  Can you reproduce it from a new session, or does it only happen after other definitions perhaps do something weird?

That said, this would definitely be a bug!
