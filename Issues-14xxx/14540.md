```
sage: p = MixedIntegerLinearProgram()
sage: b = p.new_variable()
sage: int(1) <= b[0] <= int(2)
x_0 <= 2
```

```
sage: p = MixedIntegerLinearProgram()
sage: b = p.new_variable()
sage: float(0) <= b[0] <= int(1) <= b[1] <= float(2)
1 <= x_1 <= 2
```

```
sage: p = MixedIntegerLinearProgram()
sage: b = p.new_variable()
sage: b[0] <= 555*b[1] >= 2
2 <= x_0 <= 555*x_1
```

This can never work due to the way Python handles chained comparisons:

```
sage: p = MixedIntegerLinearProgram()
sage: b = p.new_variable()
sage: b[0] <= 3 <= 4
True
```

and it's not only `int`, but `float`, too, that gives this problem.

(The documentation should probably explain what is expected to work and what is not!)

I note that the unrelated comparison-hack code for SR silently throws away chained inequalities.

```
sage: var('x')
x
sage: x <= 2 <= 3
x <= 2
sage: x <= 2 <= x
x <= 2
```

Also, should `add_constraint` allow the user to add tautological constraints like this:

```
sage: p = MixedIntegerLinearProgram()
sage: p.add_constraint(0<=0)
ValueError: argument must be a linear function or constraint, got True
```

Someone should probably review your changes to `Parent` before this ticket is set to positive_review.

There are theoretical limits to what can work without fundamentally changing Python (or the preparser if you want to go that way), that's why it is called a "hack".

I could add a bit of documentation, although a full explanation would probably be too technical.

It would suffice to explain that you can chain linear expressions with the same comparison, and also use constants at the very left hand side and the very right hand side. If the user tries anything beyond that, there's either an error or weirdness.

Constants in the middle also work, just not two constants next to eachother. For example, `b[0] <= 0 <= b[1]` works as expected.
