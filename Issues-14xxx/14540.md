```
sage: p = MixedIntegerLinearProgram()
sage: b = p.new_variable()
sage: int(1) <= b[0] <= int(2)
x_0 <= 2
```

```
sage: p = MixedIntegerLinearProgram()
sage: b = p.new_variable()
sage: float(0) <= b[0] <= int(1) <= b[1] <= float(2)
1 <= x_1 <= 2
```

```
sage: p = MixedIntegerLinearProgram()
sage: b = p.new_variable()
sage: b[0] <= 555*b[1] >= 2
2 <= x_0 <= 555*x_1
```

This can never work due to the way Python handles chained comparisons:

```
sage: p = MixedIntegerLinearProgram()
sage: b = p.new_variable()
sage: b[0] <= 3 <= 4
True
```

and it's not only `int`, but `float`, too, that gives this problem.

<a id='comment:25'></a>
It seems to work, except for bizarre behavior if one does try to chain in comparisons between constants.

```
sage: p = MixedIntegerLinearProgram()
sage: b = p.new_variable()
sage: b[0] <= 2 <= 2
True
sage: 0<=b[0]<=b[0]<=b[0]<=1
0 <= x_0 <= 2 <= x_0 <= x_0 <= 1
```

(The documentation should probably explain what is expected to work and what is not!)

I note that the unrelated comparison-hack code for SR silently throws away chained inequalities.

```
sage: var('x')
x
sage: x <= 2 <= 3
x <= 2
sage: x <= 2 <= x
x <= 2
```

Also, should `add_constraint` allow the user to add tautological constraints like this:

```
sage: p = MixedIntegerLinearProgram()
sage: p.add_constraint(0<=0)
ValueError: argument must be a linear function or constraint, got True
```

Someone should probably review your changes to `Parent` before this ticket is set to positive_review.
