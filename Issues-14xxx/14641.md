# Issue 14641: Does the "promotion" method for tableaux really compute Schuetzenberger promotion?

**IGNORE** this ticket: it's all been fixed in #7983.

Both `promotion` and `promotion_inverse` methods in `combinat/tableau.py` take two inputs: the tableau `self` and an integer `n`.

What exactly does the `n` do? While `promotion` has some kind of docstring, I fail to understand it. I expected the `n` to be the `i` in the `\delta_i` of Ayyer-Klee-Schilling http://arxiv.org/pdf/1205.7074v2.pdf (identifying standard Young tableaux with saturated chains on the partition lattice), but then I would expect that for `X` being a standard tableau, `X.promotion(n)` would still be a standard tableau. This is not the case:

```
sage: X = StandardTableau([[1,2],[3,4],[5]])
sage: X.promotion(1)
[[1, 2], [4, 5], [6]]
```

It seems to me that `X.promotion(n-1)`, where `n` is the size of the standard tableau `X`, computes the good old Schuetzenberger promotion of `X`; but I am not quite sure and this seems to contradict the docstring.

When `X` is rectangular, the code works very differently and some completely strange things happen:

```
sage: S = StandardTableau([[1,3,5,6],[2,4,7,8]])
sage: S.promotion(0)    # This should make perfect sense going by the docstring...

The notion of promotion suffers from a wealth of different meanings, but what I am seeing here doesn't match any I know...

{
    "body": "<a id='comment:2'></a>\nHi Darij,\n\nSo I think the 'n' in this promotion operator specifies that the highest entry value we are allowing in the tableau is 'n+1'. Now for standard tableaux, we want 'n' to be the number of boxes minus 1. But when you're working with semistandard tableaux, you really do need to specify this, since it may be that no 'n+1's are present in the tableaux, in which case promotion just increments all the entries. \n\nIt would be good to change the code so that if no 'n' is specified, it takes n = (# boxes - 1) by default.\n\nI agree that the code is confusing in the case of rectangular tableaux, but it seems to be working correctly in the rectangular examples I've tried. It's likely just a computational shortcut.\n\nAlso, I think the code isn't designed to make sense with 'n' less than the largest entry minus 1. So it gives nonsensical answers. Perhaps the code should check that 'n' is at least as big as the largest entry minus 1.\n\nJessica",

Hi Darij,

So I think the 'n' in this promotion operator specifies that the highest entry value we are allowing in the tableau is 'n+1'. Now for standard tableaux, we want 'n' to be the number of boxes minus 1. But when you're working with semistandard tableaux, you really do need to specify this, since it may be that no 'n+1's are present in the tableaux, in which case promotion just increments all the entries. 

It would be good to change the code so that if no 'n' is specified, it takes n = (# boxes - 1) by default.

I agree that the code is confusing in the case of rectangular tableaux, but it seems to be working correctly in the rectangular examples I've tried. It's likely just a computational shortcut.

Also, I think the code isn't designed to make sense with 'n' less than the largest entry minus 1. So it gives nonsensical answers. Perhaps the code should check that 'n' is at least as big as the largest entry minus 1.

Jessica

Thanks! This looks like a very good guess. I'm wondering why it had to be n+1, not n...

It looks like the doc is the main issue here. I'll take care of this in the next patch I do for `tableaux.py`.

 Both `promotion` and `promotion_inverse` methods in `combinat/tableau.py` take two inputs: the tableau `self` and an integer `n`.
 
 What exactly does the `n` do? While `promotion` has some kind of docstring, I fail to understand it. I expected the `n` to be the `i` in the `\delta_i` of Ayyer-Klee-Schilling http://arxiv.org/pdf/1205.7074v2.pdf (identifying standard Young tableaux with saturated chains on the partition lattice), but then I would expect that for `X` being a standard tableau, `X.promotion(n)` would still be a standard tableau. This is not the case:
