As originally reported on sage-devel: https://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-devel/4QPBF_BDnfE/discussion

The problem is that coefficients are converted to the symbolic ring and then back, which does not work (and is a bug of symbolic ring / finite field coercion). A workaround which may help in other cases and improve speed is to go through symbolic ring only when direct conversion fails. (Which, of course, is the bug for the corresponding ring and has to be solved as well...)

When entering symbolic coefficients, I find it quite convenient to enter them as `coefficients=["a/b", "c^2", ...]` and it does not work unless we pass through SR. Ideally, having or not having SR conversion should make no difference (apart from speed), but apparently with strings things don't work without SR and with finite fields they don't work with SR.
