Consider this script `gap_race.sage`:

```
from multiprocessing import Process
import time

def rungap():
    gap("42")

P = [Process(target=rungap) for i in range(4)]
for p in P:
    p.start()
    time.sleep(0.1)
```

When executing with `./sage --nodotsage gaprace.sage`, this should run without producing errors. But it doesn't, due to race conditions in `gap_reset_workspace()`.

Looks good. But on Windows, `os.rename()` will raise an `OSError` if destination exists. Not sure if that applies to Cygwin, but better safe than sorry?
