There is a bug in the dilation of polyhedra (compare the ambient dimensions):

```
sage: p = Polyhedron(ambient_dim=2); p
The empty polyhedron in ZZ^2
sage: p.dilation(3)
The empty polyhedron in ZZ^0
```

The attached patch fixes this.

Could you replace the reference to the trac ticket by <code>:trac:\`14987\`</code> ? That's how we should write it now `:-)`

Once this is done, you can set this ticket to `positive_review` on my behalf.

Thaaaaaaaaaaaanks !

Nathann

P.S. : Oh, and there is also a `::` immediately after TESTS which should be a single `:`.
