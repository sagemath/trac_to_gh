This is essentially #13407 for upgrades: `sage-make_relative` is evil because it leads to race conditions.

This probably caused an upgrade problem on `rosemary`: the script `local/bin/ipython` wasn't installed:

```
running install_scripts
copying build/scripts-2.7/iplogger -> /home/buildbot/build/sage/rosemary-1/rosemary_upgrade_4.5.2/build/sage-5.7.beta1/local/bin
```

which normally looks like

```
running install_scripts
copying build/scripts-2.7/ipengine -> /release/buildbot/sage/sage-1/sage_upgrade_4.8/build/sage-5.7.beta1/local/bin
copying build/scripts-2.7/ipcontroller -> /release/buildbot/sage/sage-1/sage_upgrade_4.8/build/sage-5.7.beta1/local/bin
copying build/scripts-2.7/ipcluster -> /release/buildbot/sage/sage-1/sage_upgrade_4.8/build/sage-5.7.beta1/local/bin
copying build/scripts-2.7/iplogger -> /release/buildbot/sage/sage-1/sage_upgrade_4.8/build/sage-5.7.beta1/local/bin
copying build/scripts-2.7/ipython -> /release/buildbot/sage/sage-1/sage_upgrade_4.8/build/sage-5.7.beta1/local/bin
copying build/scripts-2.7/pycolor -> /release/buildbot/sage/sage-1/sage_upgrade_4.8/build/sage-5.7.beta1/local/bin
copying build/scripts-2.7/irunner -> /release/buildbot/sage/sage-1/sage_upgrade_4.8/build/sage-5.7.beta1/local/bin
copying build/scripts-2.7/iptest -> /release/buildbot/sage/sage-1/sage_upgrade_4.8/build/sage-5.7.beta1/local/bin
```

Distutils by default doesn't overwrite newer files, and `sage-make_relative` can make a file look newer, causing `distutils` to not copy a file.
