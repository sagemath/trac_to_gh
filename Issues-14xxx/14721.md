See #13245 and the sage-devel thread on useless rebuilding of the Sage library ...

The patch effectively reverts the change to `setup.py` made by [attachment: ticket:14570:trac14570.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket14721/eda7b1d72a76e585dcb876a3e5981075.gz) (btw. the only functional change of that patch).
