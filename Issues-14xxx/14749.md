Without this test, it takes some time to figure out whats wrong.

Depends on #14750

Keywords: **gp, expect, configuration**

done.

Why should it not be a symlink? It's just a big pain if it does not exist at all.

This is now two commits on top of #14750, and can be merged after #14750.

A name can be both a symlink and a file (a symlink to an ordinary file is both).
