#11287 introduced a `runsnake` command that tries to execute `runsnake` using the system python. However, it does so without `sage-native-execute` and without clearing `PYTHONHOME` and `PYTHONPATH`, so it has very little chance of ever working. It already comes a little closer by doing

```diff
-   os.system("/usr/bin/python -E `which runsnake` %s &"%tmpfile)
+   os.system("unset PYTHONHOME; unset PYTHONPATH; sage-native-execute runsnake %s &"%tmpfile)
```
in `sage/misc/dev_tools.py` (that makes the command `runsnake` work on my computer).

You can't really expect the system python to work properly when the environment variables point to libraries for other python installs. See also #9386, #10286, #17735.

Depends on #9386

No window appears in reasonable time. Is this any related?

Good for you! However, we cannot guarantee that this is the case. In general, if we run `/usr/bin/python` we have to ensure that the sage library and the sage-python library (via the PYTHON path variables) do not get in the way of standard python execution.\n\nAn alternative is to try and figure out how to install runsnake for sage's python (i.e., make an spkg out of it) but that seems like a hopelessly complicated solution relative to relying on system-provided runsnake. That said, fedora still only offers python-SquareMap-1.0.1, which is insufficient for the runsnake they offer. But at least the beast that is wxPython is available on the system Python by default ...",

:-) That means that your native python `/usr/bin/python` is binary compatible with sage's `python`. Good for you! However, we cannot guarantee that this is the case. In general, if we run `/usr/bin/python` we have to ensure that the sage library and the sage-python library (via the PYTHON path variables) do not get in the way of standard python execution.

An alternative is to try and figure out how to install runsnake for sage's python (i.e., make an spkg out of it) but that seems like a hopelessly complicated solution relative to relying on system-provided runsnake. That said, fedora still only offers python-SquareMap-1.0.1, which is insufficient for the runsnake they offer. But at least the beast that is wxPython is available on the system Python by default ...

If you google "suse runsnake" you'll get RPM hits, so at least third parties have packaged it for opensuse. I wouldn't go and install random rpms from the web, but for instance [this page](http://rpm.pbone.net/index.php3/stat/4/idpl/21440304/dir/opensuse_12.x/com/RunSnakeRun-2.0.2b1-6.2.noarch.rpm.html) lists the requirements of the rpm. With a bit of luck THOSE can be satisfied by yast (the main one probably being python-wxWidgets) so that from that point your easily installed runsnake might work.

I just tried to install runsnake in my Sage Python and it went flawlessly.

For `wxPython`, I followed [these instructions](http://www.wxpython.org/builddoc.php): all I had to do was download and extract the tarball and then

```
cd wxPython
python build-wxpython.py --prefix="$SAGE_LOCAL" --install
```

For runsnake, I used `easy_install`:

```
easy_install RunSnakeRun
```

(all this in a Sage shell of course)

Perhaps it used to be more complicated or it is highly system-dependent, but I don't see the problem...

If failed for me in the configuration process:

```

checking for GST... configure: WARNING: GStreamer 0.8/0.10 not available.

```
Runsnake as packaged by Fedora works well for me (apart from the fact that `SquareMap-1.0.3` was required but not packaged by Fedora. I presume this has been resolved in more modern distributions).

So, installing and building runsnake in the sage python seems a convenient solution for some people, but the building requirements are so heavy (the wxPython source tarball is 58Mb, and it requires all kinds of bells and whistles to be present on the host system that are not otherwise required for sage) that supporting a system runsnake should definitely be an option (and it's not hard to do).

The last couple of times I've just resorted to saving the profile data using "%prun -D <filename> <command" and opening it with the system runsnake afterwards (the pathnames allow the system runsnake to display all relevant source, so it doesn't need to run in the same python as where the profile comes from).

---

So something along these lines would probably give the best of both worlds:

```
  if os.path.exists( os.environ['SAGE_LOCAL']+'/bin/runsnake'):
      subprocess.call(["runsnake",tmpfile])
  else
      os.system("""sh -c "
        LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$SAGE_ORIG_LD_LIBRARY_PATH; export LD_LIBRARY_PATH
        if [ `uname` = 'Darwin' ]; then
            DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$SAGE_ORIG_DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
        fi
        unset PYTHONHOME; unset PYTHONPATH;
        runsnake %s
      "    
      """%tempfile)
```
This is assuming that the runsnake script itself addresses the python it wants by full name, which installed scripts usually do. We definitely need to reset the PYTHON variables, since those will be referring to sage-specific python modules, which may be incompatible with the system python. And we also do not want the sage libraries get in the way.

**optional:** catch if running the command led to an error condition and then print some message what the possible avenues are for getting runsnake installed.

I like your proposal from the last comment, but some comments:

You never need `os.system("sh -c ...")` since `os.system()` already uses a Shell.

And like I said before, use `sage-native-execute` instead of manually messing with environment variables.

Instead of `os.path.exists()`, you could instead use the more Pythonic

```
try:
    subprocess.call(os.path.join(SAGE_LOCAL, "bin", "runsnake"...)
except OSError:
    ...

To elaborate on `os.path.exists(file)`:

1. it checks only whether something by that name exists, not that it's an ordinary file. So at least use `os.path.isfile(file)` instead.

2. it doesn't check whether the file is executable. Removing executable bits from a program is a valid way to temporarily "disable" it, so you should also check `os.access(file, X_OK)`.

But really, the `try`/`except` style is preferred by Python...

Yes, I know that as a general rule, pythonistas seem to promote it, but one shouldn't apply this blindly. The problem is that checking that it's hard to write and "except" class that guarantees it only catches the particular OSError resulting from the relevant file not existing.

A priori, there may be loads of reasons why os.system might return an OSError, and I *only* want to try something else if `runsnake` is *not* installed in sage; otherwise I'd prefer to see an error. I certainly get that effect by testing the presence of `runsnake`. If `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/runsnake` exists but is not executable, an error is also more appropriate than silently trying something else, so not testing executability also leads to better error reporting.

I think it's good to be aware that `try/except` can be quite efficient in python and for some operations is less prone to race conditions, but one shouldn't apply it blindly. It's simply too hard to get a sufficiently fine filtering in the except clause.

You mean `subprocess.call`, not `os.system`. Yes, this is an important difference!

I would say it's highly unlikely that `subprocess.call` raises an `OSError` which is *not* because the file does not exist or is not executable. The only thing I can think of is running out of memory...

> If `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/runsnake` exists but is not executable, an error is also more appropriate

OK, executable lookup indeed ignores non-executable files that occur earlier in the path, so we should too. Strictly speaking the check should be

```
sage_runsnake=os.path.join(os.eviron("SAGE_LOCAL"),"bin","runsnake")
if os.path.isfile(sage_runsnake) and os.access(sage_runsnake,os.X_OK):
    ...
```
to emulate normal PATH behaviour (where lookup skips directories with the relevant name). Also, there's a comment on `os.access` that it tests against real uid rather than effective gid. Sigh ... it's almost worth running the risk of an improperly caught OSError.

That's true, but I would think it's unlikely that people run Sage as suid. But it's certainly odd that there is no system call to check whether a file is executable for the current user.
