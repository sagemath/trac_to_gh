This happens on some OS X installations:

```
sage -t  --long -force_lib devel/sage/sage/misc/interpreter.py
dyld: Library not loaded: /Users/buildbot/sage-5.2/local/lib/libreadline.6.2.dylib
  Referenced from: /Users/buildbot/build/sage/bsd-1/bsd_upgrade_5.2/build/sage-5.7.beta2/local/lib/R//lib/libR.dylib
  Reason: image not found
sh: line 1: 13937 Trace/BPT trap          R --version
**********************************************************************
File "/Users/buildbot/build/sage/bsd-1/bsd_upgrade_5.2/build/sage-5.7.beta2/devel/sage-main/sage/misc/interpreter.py", line 189:
    sage: os.WIFEXITED(status) and os.WEXITSTATUS(status) == 0
Expected:
    True
Got:
    False
**********************************************************************
```

The problem is that `split()` doesn't do what was intented:

```
sage: cmd="R --version"
sage: cmd.split(' |\n\t;&',1)
['R --version']
```

It's on OS X 10.6.  I haven't determined the actual circumstances under which it occurs, but there is clearly a bug in the use of the `split()` method.

Perhaps relocating the Sage tree causes the failure.

You're right about that bad use of split.  This doesn't happen on my 10.4 or 10.7.

This is pretty new code, in a 5.7 beta - maybe the people at that patch would know more?

I think that this is a combination of a bad use of split and Sage not relocating correctly. On my OS X 10.8.2 box, I see

```
sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/misc/interpreter.py"

  Referenced from: /Users/palmieri/Desktop/Sage_stuff/sage_builds/sage-5.7.beta1/local/lib/R//bin/exec/R
  Reason: image not found
```
But notice that the referenced library is supposed to be in `sage_builds/clean/...` while Sage has actually been moved to `sage_builds/...`.

So: the use of split should be fixed here. The rest of this is perhaps covered by #9668.
