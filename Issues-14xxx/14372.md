Why is this especially handy when using git?

I hope that ccache will not be enabled by default, because you don't want to force 4GB of additional data in the user's home directory. And if it's not enabled by default, why should the package be standard?

Note that I'm not against it being standard, it could be like GCC: shipped but not built by default.

Being optional for a while doesn't imply it should get standard;  there are many packages that are optional since quite a while, and you certainly won't want to include all of them.

IMHO we already have too many "standard" packages, some are only built on a few platforms, or under certain circumstances, some only useful to (or necessary for) a few people.

I don't think Robert was claiming that ccache should become standard *because* it has been optional for a while, but rather that it has been optional for long enough to satisfy that requirement for becoming a standard package.

We do have a bunch of standard packages, but I agree with Robert that ccache would be useful for almost every Sage developer (which is more than can be said of some of our current standard spkgs).

Well, it perfectly fits an *optional* package -- it doesn't require any specific support by the Sage library, just like gdb, autotools, valgrind, also GCC, or whatever, which are mostly there for convenience, but not needed by most Sage users.

Shipping (and reinstalling) it with each and every Sage release doesn't make sense to me;  <flame> any serious developer would have it installed [system-wide] anyway if it's of use to him/her </flame>.

Don't make the horse an elephant, otherwise it'll really lose its ability to fly.

If we switch to Portage Prefix as our build system, maybe we can have `sci-mathematics/sage-9999[dev]` (or whatever) depend on ccache and other versions of `sci-mathematics/sage` not need to. Developers would build a make target that unmasked `sci-mathematics/sage-9999` before building, say, whereas for users it would remain masked and stuff like the dev scripts and ccache would not be installed.

But of course that's not really relevant to this ticket.

So... what is this ccache thing?  If it's automatic and makes `sage -b` faster, should I just use this optional spkg?  I guess I agree that one potential resolution to this ticket would be to tell people to use it.

That's what it does indeed (in fact, it makes building all C/C++ code in Sage faster, not just `./sage -b`)

If you don't mind losing 4GB of disk space, yes you should.

It's automatic and makes `sage -b` faster, but it requires a lot of disk space (a few gigabytes), and the effect of making `sage -b` faster is most visible if you used ccache during your initial build of sage from the source tarball, I think.

Hi,

(ccing me)

I am against shipping ccache in Sage (following [comment:11](#comment%3A11)). On the other hand, if some OS fails to have it then why not doing the same as gcc? I have no strong opinion about this as I think that everybody should use a Unix/GNU distribution (with gcc+ccache available).

Nevertheless, it would be fantastic to document the usage of ccache
- for compiling **only** sage source code
- for compiling sage source code and third-party softwares
and I see two places where this might be important
- the Developer guide
- the README

I started using ccache today (thanks to Robert Bradshaw). The only thing I did is

```
 $ export PATH=PATH_TO_CCACHE:$PATH
 $ sage -b
```
Is that the right way to use it? (it seems so as my cache is much bigger now).

Tell me if I can help for something on that ticket.

Best
Vincent

I'm pretty sure even the first compilation is faster, because some files are used multiple times within an install.

Yes, see #16148. I think every developer should use it (4GB of hard drive space really isn't that much these days) and I think every user should be considered at least a potential developer (at least the ones who compile from source).

Though I don't think it should be in binaries anyway.  On a small USB key and some other situations 4 GB is quite a bit.

That said, I still don't know how to use this properly!  Taking a chance that just using the env var in my .profile was enough...

Which in many cases would be the wrong place.

While it only gets filled upon compilation, `sage -b` is sufficient, as is the installation of an optional spkg in many if not most cases.  The only difference of bdists is that they don't come with *upstream* source code (i.e., spkgs, or tarballs in `upstream/`.)

See above.

I added some information on `ccache` to the developer guide a couple months ago in #21500 without seeing this discussion. If that's the only point of this ticket, then it can be closed as duplicate.
