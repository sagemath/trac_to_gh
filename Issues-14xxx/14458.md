# Issue 14458: indentation problem with "except" in doctests

```
Consider the following doctest:

```
"""
  sage: try:
  ...      raise ValueError
  ...      print "Le probleme a une solution !"
  ...   except:
  ...      print "Le probleme est infaisable !"
  Le probleme est infaisable !
"""
```
Then with Sage 5.7, `sage -t doctest.sage` fails with:

```
      File "<doctest __main__.example_0[2]>", line 4
        except:
              ^
    IndentationError: unindent does not match any outer indentation level
```

However, with the following modified doctest, where `except` is wrongly indented, `sage -t` works:

```
"""
  sage: try:
  ...      raise ValueError
  ...      print "Le probleme a une solution !"
  ... except:
  ...      print "Le probleme est infaisable !"
  Le probleme est infaisable !
"""
```
This is annoying when using sagetex: either we use the first version and the doctest fails, or we use the second version and the printed code is badly indented.

the **printed** version of the example in the book will be ok, and will work with any version of Sage.

This is only a doctest issue, and as I said it is non-blocking for our book, since we have a workaround.

Sure.  Then I guess I would argue for closing this as a duplicate/wontfix, since #12415 introduces a syntax that essentially achieves what you're looking for.
