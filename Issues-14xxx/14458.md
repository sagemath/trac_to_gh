# Issue 14458: indentation problem with "except" in doctests

```
Consider the following doctest:

```
"""
  sage: try:
  ...      raise ValueError
  ...      print "Le probleme a une solution !"
  ...   except:
  ...      print "Le probleme est infaisable !"
  Le probleme est infaisable !
"""
```
Then with Sage 5.7, `sage -t doctest.sage` fails with:

```
      File "<doctest __main__.example_0[2]>", line 4
        except:
              ^
    IndentationError: unindent does not match any outer indentation level
```

However, with the following modified doctest, where `except` is wrongly indented, `sage -t` works:

```
"""
  sage: try:
  ...      raise ValueError
  ...      print "Le probleme a une solution !"
  ... except:
  ...      print "Le probleme est infaisable !"
  Le probleme est infaisable !
"""
```
This is annoying when using sagetex: either we use the first version and the doctest fails, or we use the second version and the printed code is badly indented.

unfortunately our book is currently based on 5.7, not 5.9.
And this would force us to change all

if I understand correctly. Btw, what is the ticket corresponding to this change?

the **printed** version of the example in the book will be ok, and will work with any version of Sage.

This is only a doctest issue, and as I said it is non-blocking for our book, since we have a workaround.

Sure.  Then I guess I would argue for closing this as a duplicate/wontfix, since #12415 introduces a syntax that essentially achieves what you're looking for.
