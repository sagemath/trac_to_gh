A few tickets have been using SAGE_ROOT directly or not used SAGE_INC since my last clean up. After cleaning direct calls to SAGE_ROOT in the rest of sage we need to spend some time here.

The use of SAGE_INC has also been normalized everywhere so it is not necessary to add a final "/". The use of predefined depend variables has been enforced as much as I could see it.

You only missed one instance (#14531), for an optional spkg.
