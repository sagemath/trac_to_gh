Can you add the following:
1. After every description `iterator`, add what it is an iterator of. In some cases it is clearly mentioned, whereas in other cases it is simply left as `iterator`.
2. There are some `INPUT` descriptions like this: <code>- \`\`new\`\` -- boolean or None</code> or <code>- \`\`new\`\` -- string or None </code>. I think it should be explicitly mentioned that `None` corresponds to retrieving the current value. In fact, I am very surprised how it works. The function definition should be like the definition below so that `G.loops()` gives the value straightaway, without having to enter `None` as a function argument:

```
def loops(self, new=None):
```


It is a painful and extensive cleanup of that file. Thanks for the effort. :)

Hellooooooo !

I just updated the patch (sorry for the delay, I had some problems with Sage because of #14737), and fixed all your points.

Except point 4, where I removed the backticks instead of adding them : the whole file is full of (u,v) without backticks, and to me marking them with double backticks makes less sense than writing them as LaTeX characters. To me an edge is a math thing.

Well, what do you think ? We can make it Python, Maths, or let it stay like that too `:-)`
