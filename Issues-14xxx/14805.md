<a id='comment:7'></a>Hellooooooo !

I just updated the patch (sorry for the delay, I had some problems with Sage because of #14737), and fixed all your points.

Except point 4, where I removed the backticks instead of adding them : the whole file is full of (u,v) without backticks, and to me marking them with double backticks makes less sense than writing them as LaTeX characters. To me an edge is a math thing.

Well, what do you think ? We can make it Python, Maths, or let it stay like that too `:-)`
