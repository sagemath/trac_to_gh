The following throws a SystemError:

```
sage: from sage.matrix.matrix_integer_2x2 import MatrixSpace_ZZ_2x2
sage: M2ZSpace = MatrixSpace_ZZ_2x2()
sage: A = M2ZSpace([-5, -3, 7, 4])
sage: B = M2ZSpace([1,0,-2,1])
sage: A < B
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
SystemError                               Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-60-e9066daab57d> in <module>()
----> 1 A < B

SystemError: error return without exception set
```

(I think this was probably found and fixed by David Roe, but he hasn't posted anything on trac, so I'm doing that).
