On [sage-devel](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/sage-devel/wt2mTIH80NM) I expressed my unease that negative integers have "negative bits". Strictly speaking, there is some inconsistency here, but the behavior is reasonable -- though it warrants some improved documentation.

Attached patch adds documentation for bits() to explain this.

Looks good.  Adding similar documentation to `digits` might be nice, but not necessary.

There's an example in the `digits` documentation which shows the same kind of thing, so I thought I'd leave it for now.

Thanks for the quick review!
