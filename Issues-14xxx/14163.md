The Hopf algebra of quasisymmetric functions is missing the counit method.

```
sage: QSym = QuasiSymmetricFunctions(QQ)
sage: F = QSym.Fundamental()
sage: F.counit
sage:
```
Without the counit, `_test_antipode` at #14161 fails for QSym

Apply: trac_14163_add_counit_qsym-fs.patch

This really should be added to GradedConnectedHopfAlgebrasWithBasis. But we don't have this category yet (it will be easy when the functorial construction patch will be there). So good for now, but please open a ticket to remind us to create this category and put the counit there!

Thanks!
