The Hopf algebra of quasisymmetric functions is missing the counit method.

```
sage: QSym = QuasiSymmetricFunctions(QQ)
sage: F = QSym.Fundamental()
sage: F.counit
sage:
```
Without the counit, `_test_antipode` at #14161 fails for QSym

Since the code is identical to that of NSym, I put the method in `ParentMethods` for bases of both algebras. Attached it an updated patch. Mike, if you like the change, then set this to positive review.
