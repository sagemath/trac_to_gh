sage: F = QSym.Fundamental()
sage: F.counit

Added `counit_on_basis` to the `ParentMethods` of the `Bases` class in QSym.  This is a copy of what is in NSym.

Since the code is identical to that of NSym, I put the method in `ParentMethods` for bases of both algebras. Attached it an updated patch. Mike, if you like the change, then set this to positive review.

This really should be added to GradedConnectedHopfAlgebrasWithBasis. But we don't have this category yet (it will be easy when the functorial construction patch will be there). So good for now, but please open a ticket to remind us to create this category and put the counit there!
