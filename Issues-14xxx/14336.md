It took two hours to compile it on my arm box, and the desktop interface was still running. Compared to the previous version which needed me to shut down X and kill as many services as possible, and where conversion.c took just by itself about six hours to compile, I think I can say this is a marked improvement!

Congrats!

when I try to import the patch in Sage 5.9 (with `hg_sage.import_patch("/tmp/m4rie_new_version.patch")`), I get a `diff -git` output,
then it enters my editor. It seems a commit log is missing in this patch.
