This bug was reported to me by Xavier ProvenÃ§al:

```
sage: M3 = matrix(3,[-1,1,0,-1,0,1,1,0,0])
sage: a = M3.eigenvalues()[0]
sage: a            
0.5436890126920763?
sage: a < oo            # <---- this should return True
False
sage: a > -oo      
True               
sage: float(a) < oo
True               
```

Component: **number fields**

In fact it could be argued that the result is correct, since `QQbar` is not ordered, and `AA(a) < infinity` works. I'm tempted to suggest closing the ticket as wontfix.

The second and third answers are "obviously" false at first sight, but there is probably no "good" way to compare with signed infinity in `QQbar`.  I think this should either be closed as wontfix (as in [comment:7](#comment:7)) or that `UnsignedInfinityRing` should be discovered as a common parent.
