This bug was reported to me by Xavier ProvenÃ§al:

```
sage: M3 = matrix(3,[-1,1,0,-1,0,1,1,0,0])
sage: a = M3.eigenvalues()[0]
sage: a            
0.5436890126920763?
sage: a < oo            # <---- this should return True
False
sage: a > -oo      
True               
sage: float(a) < oo

This happens because `QQbar` does not coerce into `InfinityRing` (which is probably correct), and the coercion model does not discover `UnsignedInfinityRing` as a common parent.  (Note that `a < unsigned_infinity` does work correctly.)

with recent sage we get

```
sage:  a <  oo

is that consistant/correct?

The second and third answers are "obviously" false at first sight, but there is probably no "good" way to compare with signed infinity in `QQbar`.  I think this should either be closed as wontfix (as in[comment:7](#comment%3A7)) or that `UnsignedInfinityRing` should be discovered as a common parent.

If there is no good way to compare with signed infinity in QQbar it should be incomparable?(IMHO)
