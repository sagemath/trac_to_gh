My patchbot http://patchbot.sagemath.org/ticket/?machine=openSUSE%20/12.3/x86_64/3.7.10-1.1-desktop/jehova.local&status=open just broke with the error

```
...

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/plethora/patchbot/sage-5.10.rc1/local/bin/patchbot/patchbot.py", line 793, in <module>
    main(args)
  File "/plethora/patchbot/sage-5.10.rc1/local/bin/patchbot/patchbot.py", line 777, in main

    print ticket['title']
UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode character u'\xe9' in position 40: ordinal not in range(128)
```

The last line in the log file was 

```
============================== 14339 ==============================
```
so presumably the bot broke when it tried to format the title of that ticket.

I just noted that there is a pretty recent test ticket #14974 for such issues. It would be good to put a Padé into its title to check utf-8 support there.

I removed the accents from #14720, much to the chagrin of the patch author.
