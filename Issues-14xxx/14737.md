One (variant of possible) symptom(s):

```
In file included from ../kernel/si_gmp.h:4:0,
                  from ../kernel/structs.h:15,
                  from weight0.c:13:
../factory/cf_gmp.h:2501:28: fatal error: bits/c++config.h: No such file or directory
  #include <bits/c++config.h>
                             ^
compilation terminated.
make[4]: *** [weight0.o] Error 1
```

This is still present in Singular 3-1-6.

---

The file `factory/cf_gmp.h` is supposed to contain *a copy* of the otherwise used `gmp.h` found on the system, with some C++ definitions removed, later on to be used both by Singular C and C++ files (i.e., those include `cf_gmp.h` instead of `gmp.h`).

The actual problem is getting the location (i.e., the absolute path) of the header file used by the C/C++ compiler / preprocessor, in order to create a modified copy of it.

The latter is achieved by using GCC's `-M` switch to output `Makefile` dependencies (also taking into account include directory search paths eventually specified by the user, probably via `--with-gmp=...`), but isn't robust w.r.t. the formatting of the generated rules.

In particular, undesired *additional header files* (which usually include others) may end up in `cf_gmp.h`, leading to (potentially arbitrary) problems at least when C files include it, as the folders searched for C headers usually differ from those used when compiling / preprocessing C++.  (This is the case in the rather obscure error above, where `bits/c++config.h` isn't found.)




The current patch to the Singular spkg both simplifies the generation of `cf_gmp.h` (no longer needing `gen_cf_gmp.template` and [to ship] `gen_cf_gmp.cc`, nor the generation of a temporary shell script, `gen_cf_gmp.sh`), and of course makes it more robust, also making sure *only the contents of `gmp.h`* ends up in its modified copy.
