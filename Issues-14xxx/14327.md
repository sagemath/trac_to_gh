When testing `sage.rings.padics.factory`, a failure in `Qq` is shown in the doctest report as `sage.rings.padics.factory.?` because of the indentation of the following lines.

This is due to a problem in the indentation tracking in `sage.doctest.sources`.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/14327
