In #2081 we introduced a `coefficients` method for univariate polynomials and power series, which only returns the nonzero coefficients.

```
sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
sage: (x^2+1).coefficients()
[1, 1]
```

* The result for `x^2 + 1` should be `[1, 0, 1]`.
* We should add a method `coefficients_nonzero` for univariate and multivariable polynomials and power series that does what `coefficients` now does.
* We should deprecate the `coefficients` method on multivariate polynomials.

See also #17518 and the sage-devel discussion linked there.

How about `nonzero_coefficients` instead of the french way.

Your desired behavior is already implemented in the `coeffs()` method. So +1 for making coefficients an alias to coeffs.

It would be nice to be able to iterate over (coefficient, exponent) without constructing a sparse dictionary (using the `dict()` method) first. Call it `iteritems()`? `monomial_iter()`?

Reading here

http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/

I do see `lower_case_with_underscores` as an example of a naming style, but I believe this is meant to indicate that the method names are all lower case and separated by underscores, not what order the words should go in.  It's in the "Descriptive" section anyway, not the "Prescriptive" section.  I didn't see anything about placement of adjectives; is there a different PEP for that?
