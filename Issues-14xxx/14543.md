In #14348, I submitted code which computes the cycle index of the virtual species Ω, which is the compositional inverse of the species E+ of nonempty sets. It is possible to compute the compositional inverse of (most) arbitrary cycle indices (subject to some conditions on the low-order terms). The attached patch implements this calculation by adding a compositional_inverse() method to the class CycleIndexSeries. This code is doctested and builds HTML docs without errors.

It should be noted that this algorithm is very slow; however, it is the best one I know for the general case. The algorithm for computing the cycle index of Ω in #14348 is *much* faster, and that specific species has real computational utility, so I believe it is worthwhile to have both in Sage.

I have uploaded a new version of the patch which moves the code to a different part of the class, eliminating the spurious dependency on #14542. I have also expanded and updated the documentation in two ways: by adding an ALGORITHM block explaining the (rather clumsy) method which is used here, and by adding a SEEALSO explaining the connection to CombinatorialLogarithmSeries.

darij has suggested in discussion on #14542 that this use of `assert` may cause problems when CycleIndexSeriesRing is based in a complicated ring (like another LazyPowerSeriesRing). Is the best option here to add something like an optional `check_input` option which allows the user to suppress these assertions?

In a `CycleIndexSeries` as implemented in Sage, the coefficient on `x^n` is a symmetric function in the power sum basis whose terms are all of degree n. Of course, `p_1` is the only such symmetric function for `n=1`, so the only actual freedom is the coefficient from the underlying base ring. This needs to be non-zero for this inversion method to work; assuming that it's 1 makes things much simpler and is, I think, not a significant restriction.

Or perhaps you meant the *species* `X`? If so, `p_1` is indeed its cycle index series, but this code isn't running at the level of `Species`, so `p_1` seemed clearer.

Either way, if you think there's a better way to write that docstring, I'm certainly open to it—I want the meaning to be as clear as possible!

> I'm surprised that this stuff is in a class named "CycleIndexSeries " -- I'd expect it to be defined for LazyPowerSeries  in full generality? Of course, it makes sense to also have a wrapper in CycleIndexSeries  that gives back the answer in the correct type. (I fear this will have to depend on #13433 .)

That would probably make sense; there's nothing about this algorithm that obviously depends on working at the level of `CycleIndexSeries` (at least to my eye). However, to do that, I'll need some mechanism for determining the compositional identity of an arbitrary `LazyPowerSeriesRing`, to stand in where `X` is now.

It's not clear to me how this should be done without some detailed knowledge of the specifics of the algebra in question. On the other hand, this does seem like information that each `LazyPowerSeriesRing` should know about itself. Maybe I should add a `compositional_identity` method to `LazyPowerSeriesRing`, move `compositional_inverse` there, and then override `compositional_identity` in `CycleIndexSeriesRing`?

Sorry then; please disregard what I wrote. It would still be nicer to have some explanation of what exactly this is, or a more precise reference (to a section number?).\n\nFormally, this is the inverse of the operation of \"cycle index plethysm\", which is handled by the `composition` method of `CycleIndexSeries`. As an abstract operation, it has many of the same properties as power series composition, but at the computational level it is somewhat different; in particular, the induced operation on coefficients is something a bit more subtle than simply multiplying things out.\n\nThat said, the inversion procedure as I've written it out doesn't actually depend on any of the details of the operation \u2218.

> Ooh -- this is not literally the compositional inverse of a power series? Sorry then; please disregard what I wrote. It would still be nicer to have some explanation of what exactly this is, or a more precise reference (to a section number?).

Formally, this is the inverse of the operation of "cycle index plethysm", which is handled by the `composition` method of `CycleIndexSeries`. As an abstract operation, it has many of the same properties as power series composition, but at the computational level it is somewhat different; in particular, the induced operation on coefficients is something a bit more subtle than simply multiplying things out.

That said, the inversion procedure as I've written it out doesn't actually depend on any of the details of the operation ∘. It suffices that there is a two-sided ∘-inverse (call it X) and that ∘ distributes over addition. Thus, writing this procedure up at the `LazyPowerSeries` level and letting `CycleIndexSeries` inherit it should work fine, since `CycleIndexSeries` appropriately overrides `composition`.

The standard reference on the subject is section 1.4 of "Combinatorial species and tree-like structures" by Bergeron, Labelle, and Leroux, although it is discussed at some length in many other sources as well.

I'm not sure of them myself, as some of them are just my guesses. And I have not filled in the definition of functorial composition since I don't fully understand it myself (I don't have the [BLL] reference, only [BLL-Intro]), but I've added a #TODO because it should eventually be filled in.

In the stretch doctest, I replaced `f = CIS([p([1])])` by `f = CIS([p([]), p([1]), p([2]), p.zero()])` because, as far as I understand, when you write a cycle index series as a power series in t, the coefficient before `t^n` has to be a symmetric polynomial homogeneous of degree n.

I have removed the reference to [BLL] from your method because the same reference appears in another method. Generally, every reference needs to exist only once in the source.

I added the `res._name = 'res'` line because the examples in the `define` method in `series.py` do that. Maybe it is cargo cult. I hope you can shed light on this.

In case you have troubles applying my patch: I've been working atop of #10227, #14685 and #14542. Maybe some of these are dependencies.

I don't claim to understand this entirely either, but I believe (presumably cultishly) that the _name field is meant for user-facing output and shouldn't be set to something not user-useful like "res".

I'll be glad to talk through the math of this code with any interested reviewers. It's not horribly complicated, but it's definitely going to look a bit weird if you're used to working with LazyPowerSeries in different contexts. (CycleIndexSeries is a strange creature, but it's super useful!)

Also, I've switched back over to using Git to manage this—the old Mercurial workflow is just too confusing. How do I tell the build bot to ignore the attachments and only use the branch?
