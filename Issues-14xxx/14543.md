In #14348, I submitted code which computes the cycle index of the virtual species Ω, which is the compositional inverse of the species E+ of nonempty sets. It is possible to compute the compositional inverse of (most) arbitrary cycle indices (subject to some conditions on the low-order terms). The attached patch implements this calculation by adding a compositional_inverse() method to the class CycleIndexSeries. This code is doctested and builds HTML docs without errors.

It should be noted that this algorithm is very slow; however, it is the best one I know for the general case. The algorithm for computing the cycle index of Ω in #14348 is *much* faster, and that specific species has real computational utility, so I believe it is worthwhile to have both in Sage.

I have uploaded a new version of the patch which moves the code to a different part of the class, eliminating the spurious dependency on #14542. I have also expanded and updated the documentation in two ways: by adding an ALGORITHM block explaining the (rather clumsy) method which is used here, and by adding a SEEALSO explaining the connection to CombinatorialLogarithmSeries.

darij has suggested in discussion on #14542 that this use of `assert` may cause problems when CycleIndexSeriesRing is based in a complicated ring (like another LazyPowerSeriesRing). Is the best option here to add something like an optional `check_input` option which allows the user to suppress these assertions?

In a `CycleIndexSeries` as implemented in Sage, the coefficient on `x^n` is a symmetric function in the power sum basis whose terms are all of degree n. Of course, `p_1` is the only such symmetric function for `n=1`, so the only actual freedom is the coefficient from the underlying base ring.

Or perhaps you meant the *species* `X`? If so, `p_1` is indeed its cycle index series, but this code isn't running at the level of `Species`, so `p_1` seemed clearer.

Either way, if you think there's a better way to write that docstring, I'm certainly open to it—I want the meaning to be as clear as possible!

Formally, this is the inverse of the operation of "cycle index plethysm", which is handled by the `composition` method of `CycleIndexSeries`. As an abstract operation, it has many of the same properties as power series composition, but at the computational level it is somewhat different; in particular, the induced operation on coefficients is something a bit more subtle than simply multiplying things out.

That said, the inversion procedure as I've written it out doesn't actually depend on any of the details of the operation ∘. It suffices that there is a two-sided ∘-inverse (call it X) and that ∘ distributes over addition. Thus, writing this procedure up at the `LazyPowerSeries` level and letting `CycleIndexSeries` inherit it should work fine, since `CycleIndexSeries` appropriately overrides `composition`.

The standard reference on the subject is section 1.4 of "Combinatorial species and tree-like structures" by Bergeron, Labelle, and Leroux, although it is discussed at some length in many other sources as well.

The `compose_inverse_with` method from your patch, it appears that you're using the Inverse Function Theorem. This actually *does* work at the level of cycle index series (by a sort of combinatorial chain rule!), but the resulting differential equation is intractable in general, because taking species-theoretic derivatives of cycle index series destroys *lots* of information (in particular, every term without a p_1 is destroyed).\n\nI haven't dug too deeply into the algebra, but I am fairly confident that using `LazyPowerSeries` derivatives instead is not mathematically meaningful and won't yield anything useful.\n\nLooking this over has, however, brought to my attention that Sage does not have a method for `CycleIndexSeries` implementing the *species-theoretic* derivative. Curiously, the `LazyPowerSeries` `derivative()` and `integral()` methods are used several times in the existing code-base to pull off algebra tricks, so factoring out these (in my opinion) deceptive names would be a bit of a hassle, but it might still be worthwhile. This is probably at least as much a cultural question as a code one, though, so perhaps I should steer clear until I get to know the environment better?\n\nAlso, since the patchbot now seems to be confused:\n\napply trac_14543_cycle_index_compositional_inverse.patch",

> For the record: I recently needed the compositional inverse for Lazy power series, and a couple other related operations; they are in the patch I am about to attach; you can also find it in the queue. Feel free to take over / recycle whatever might be relevant.

Unfortunately, I don't think this approach will work at the `CycleIndexSeries` level. The `compose_inverse_with` method from your patch, it appears that you're using the Inverse Function Theorem. This actually *does* work at the level of cycle index series (by a sort of combinatorial chain rule!), but the resulting differential equation is intractable in general, because taking species-theoretic derivatives of cycle index series destroys *lots* of information (in particular, every term without a p_1 is destroyed).

I haven't dug too deeply into the algebra, but I am fairly confident that using `LazyPowerSeries` derivatives instead is not mathematically meaningful and won't yield anything useful.

Looking this over has, however, brought to my attention that Sage does not have a method for `CycleIndexSeries` implementing the *species-theoretic* derivative. Curiously, the `LazyPowerSeries` `derivative()` and `integral()` methods are used several times in the existing code-base to pull off algebra tricks, so factoring out these (in my opinion) deceptive names would be a bit of a hassle, but it might still be worthwhile. This is probably at least as much a cultural question as a code one, though, so perhaps I should steer clear until I get to know the environment better?

Also, since the patchbot now seems to be confused:

apply trac_14543_cycle_index_compositional_inverse.patch

Replying to [@darijgr](#comment%3A14):

Thanks for your suggestions! I've uploaded a new version of my patch which incorporates some of your changes and applies on top of the current 5.12-beta3 source; see comments below.

> And I have not filled in the definition of functorial composition since I don't fully understand it myself (I don't have the [BLL] reference, only [BLL-Intro]), but I've added a #TODO because it should eventually be filled in.

I cleaned this up in #14809, which will go live when 5.12 ships.

> In the stretch doctest, I replaced `f = CIS([p([1])])` by `f = CIS([p([]), p([1]), p([2]), p.zero()])` because, as far as I understand, when you write a cycle index series as a power series in t, the coefficient before `t^n` has to be a symmetric polynomial homogeneous of degree n.

This sounds right to me, but I haven't rolled it in because it's not related to compositional inverses. I also left out your other small tweaks to other docstrings It looks like all of this documentation could use an overhaul, though.

> I have removed the reference to [BLL] from your method because the same reference appears in another method. Generally, every reference needs to exist only once in the source.

Whoops!

> I added the `res._name = 'res'` line because the examples in the `define` method in `series.py` do that. Maybe it is cargo cult. I hope you can shed light on this.

I don't claim to understand this entirely either, but I believe (presumably cultishly) that the _name field is meant for user-facing output and shouldn't be set to something not user-useful like "res".

Perhaps one day we'll all ascend to the inner temple of `define` and gain true wisdom.
