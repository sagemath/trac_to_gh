Add a module allowing step-by-step use of the simplex method and its variants.

It is likely to be much slower than "real solvers" - no comparison was made as the point of this module is to facilitate teaching and learning of the simplex method. (The most complicated parts of the module are `_latex_` methods of problems and dictionaries!)

Some worksheets showing it in action can be usually seen at https://sage373.math.ualberta.ca/pub/
and I can provide more upon request to interested people.

Dear Dima and Nathan: as you have some interest in linear programming, perhaps you will find this ticket interesting for teaching and would be willing to glance over it?

Preliminary versions of the module were used to teach 2 sections of Math 373 Mathematical Programming and Optimization I at the University of Alberta, the current one is planned to be actively used during the Spring term (May 8 - June 12) and it would be awesome to get some feedback before it, at least on whether someone else thinks that it should go into Sage ;-)

IMHO this should be an optional package. It's quite different from the rest of Sage library, as I cannot recall any place where an effort is made to "deconstruct" an algorithm, preparing it for undergraduate teaching.

I started to look at the patch. There seems to be a numeric discrepancy in the 1st example. Indeed, on line 38 `A = ([1, 1], [3, 1])`
corresponds to 1 kg per acre needed for barley, not 5.

Then, `"regular LP solvers"` on line 7 reads strangely. I'd have written `"regular" LP solvers`.

Also, `"the final answer"` on line 8 looks weird. This reads too fatalistic, and brings in `"the final solution"`, something that one should avoid due to its damned German translation.  I'd have just written `the result`, without quotes.

I've fixed The Example (thanks for catching it, I would always read it with the numbers I have in mind after so many hours of discussing it!) and rephrased the quoted bits.

Regarding "final" - I also used "final dictionary" to refer to the dictionary where the simplex method stops. It does not have to be optimal and can be for the auxiliary problem, so final seemed like a suitable choice to me, but perhaps there are better alternatives.

As for a module or an optional package, a module definitely has more visibility (and testing!) and there are efforts to make Sage better for undergraduate teaching, so it didn't seem to me that this one will be inappropriate. Of course, I am biased, so I'll be happy to repackage if necessary.

yes, certainly "final dictionary" (without quotes) is an established terminology in simplex method, 
but you **really** do not want to use
["Final Solution"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Solution), and "final answer" is too close to the latter, and is not established terminology anyway.

As a module, it would not belong to `sage/numerical/` (redesigning it as a backend to Sage LP functionality seems to be like way too much work for little gain, although I'm not 100% sure). Perhaps one can create `sage/teaching/` or something like this, for this kind of material, but this should be discussed and voted upon in sage-devel, I think.

a simplified way can be added to Sage LP frontend, e.g. allowing to enter matrices of constraints is very easy, I gather.

again, this could be worked on...

I suppose one can make things supported by your (not yet) backend interact nicely with Sage's frontend.
E.g., for a LP `p` do something  like `p.do_one_pivot(...)`, and e.g. `p.show_current_solution()`. 

The advantage would be that then it could become a part of `sage/numerical/`. But perhaps this is not worth the trouble, and this code just should go elsewhere.

In fact, the frontend has improved quite a bit in the past 6-10 months, thanks mainly to Volker.

Update on my thinking: after looking closer into backends I am quite convinced that I don't want to do it - the standard front-end for MILP in Sage is not what is need for learning the simplex method and having to always go to special backend features would be awkward and terrifying for a number of students.

So my plan it to keep the module as is now with gradual improvements to handling rounding errors for inexact fields and to latexing. The advantage of having it as a patch/branch as opposed to a completely separate module is that there is no need to have a load command in each worksheet and it is definitely important for me, so perhaps for some other people as well.

Can we please not do overall whitespace changes so that it is possible to see what actually has been done? "First pass" commit is mostly about white space and touches half the file, yet there are some other changes in it as well.
