You might want to have a look at #13624; it replaces \verb back to \text to help dot2tex. Not really your business, but maybe it would make sense to use \text in the easy cases, with no \phantom's? This is quite more readable!

Let's try this:

Doesn't work.

Looks okay except that `\tt` [is an obsolete command](http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/l2tabu/), and `\texttt` should be used instead. I've attached a new patch which does this, along with a `delta` patch which shows the difference between my patch and your two patches.
