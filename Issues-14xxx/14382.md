You might want to have a look at #13624; it replaces \verb back to \text to help dot2tex. Not really your business, but maybe it would make sense to use \text in the easy cases, with no \phantom's? This is quite more readable!

OK, how about this one: old-style verb in EMBEDDED_MODE and text-tt wrapping otherwise. `RubiksCube()` looks perfect when rendered through SageTeX! (I didn't change documentation/doctests yet.)

Note that both ways generate valid LaTeX code, although verb one does not work in command arguments and text-tt does not work in MathJax... Nevertheless I think it is the way to go - particular cases where this treatment is insufficient should provide adequate handling of LaTeX generation themselves.
