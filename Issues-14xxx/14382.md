You might want to have a look at #13624; it replaces \verb back to \text to help dot2tex. Not really your business, but maybe it would make sense to use \text in the easy cases, with no \phantom's? This is quite more readable!

Let's try this:

Doesn't work.

Running latex on this, then sagetex, then latex, I get this error:

From the notebook, I don't see anything useful, but that may be specific to this machine. I'll try it on another machine eventually.

From SageTeX, it works, but it requires the package `amsmath` because of the `\text{...}` command. I'm not sure that's ideal.
