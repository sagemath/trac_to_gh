You might want to have a look at #13624; it replaces \verb back to \text to help dot2tex. Not really your business, but maybe it would make sense to use \text in the easy cases, with no \phantom's? This is quite more readable!

Here's a LaTeX file:

```
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{sagetex}
\begin{document}

Let's try this:
\[
\sage{"1 2"}
\]
Doesn't work.

\end{document}
```
Running latex on this, then sagetex, then latex, I get this error:

```
! Missing } inserted.

l.7 \sage{"1 2"}

<a id='comment:16'>Comment 16:</a>
I think Nicolas's point has some merit. Could we instead have text-tt wrapping in general, and then in the MathJax eval method, do a regular expression search-and-replace to change `\text{\tt{...}}` into `\verb|...|`, or something like that?
