While fixing the error messages, I've tidied up a few other things.

1.  Error messages have been changed to being raised, and associated tests adjusted accordingly.
2.  Added a check on the first argument being a permutation group.  And an associated test as a result.
3.  The loop `for alpha in mapping[1]:` has been rearranged slightly to pull out some computations that can be done outside of the loop.  Strings and string formatting have been used to make the purpose of the loop clearer, along with how GAP commands are being employed.
4.  Use of `.format()` in a few places where strings are created (near the end of the code).
5.  Some minor formatting and spelling as I ran across them.
6.  All tests in the sage and doc directories pass on 5.10.beta5.

Hey Rob,

This needs to be rebased to `5.11.beta3` (I'd guess its due to #14014), otherwise seems good. Thanks.
