I've been making this change manually for a while!

Also, I'm raising the priority of this to a 5.11 blocker, since an optional package -- when installed -- totally breaks starting up Sage, so a lot of people will hit this.

Plus it's a simple 1-line fix.

Since this updates an *optional* spkg, and the patch to the Sage library is trivial (and shouldn't affect others), this could probably still make it into 5.10...

(Technically, the new optional spkg cannot get "merged" without also merging the patch, just because they belong to the same ticket.)
