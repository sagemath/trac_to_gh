I don't that has anything to do with it. I think it has to do with the fact that the Singular process dies and that therefore, writing to the pty fails. But unfortunately, it is more complicated than that.

I would guess that the issue is the absence of `forkpty()` on Solaris? I.e. no `os.forkpty` in Python, so `pty.fork` falls back to an alternate implementation which presumably triggers a race in Solaris. Contact upstream ;-)

It seems ridiculous to change the doctest here instead of adding a workaround to `sage.interface`. If this doesn't work then your platform just can't run Sage.

I was more thingking about that:

```
    except OSError, msg: 
        if sys.platform.startswith('sunos'):
            # OpenSolaris bug workaround
            time.sleep(5)

True, but I don't like special-casing operating systems. How can we be certain that it only affects (Open)Solaris? Since this failure (`OSError` when the process is truly alive) essentially never happens, I don't think it is a problem. On sane systems, this doesn't affect the doctest since those `time.sleep()` calls will not be done as `E.isalive()` is false.
