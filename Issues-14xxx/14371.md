I don't that has anything to do with it. I think it has to do with the fact that the Singular process dies and that therefore, writing to the pty fails. But unfortunately, it is more complicated than that.

I would guess that the issue is the absence of `forkpty()` on Solaris? I.e. no `os.forkpty` in Python, so `pty.fork` falls back to an alternate implementation which presumably triggers a race in Solaris. Contact upstream ;-)

It seems ridiculous to change the doctest here instead of adding a workaround to `sage.interface`. If this doesn't work then your platform just can't run Sage.

These are all true statements, but what's the point you're trying to make?

Perhaps you are confused by the use of `sys.exc_info()[2]`, which allows to raise a new exception with the old traceback. So it really is the `os.write()` which is failing.

True, but I don't like special-casing operating systems. How can we be certain that it only affects (Open)Solaris? Since this failure (`OSError` when the process is truly alive) essentially never happens, I don't think it is a problem. On sane systems, this doesn't affect the doctest since those `time.sleep()` calls will not be done as `E.isalive()` is false.

Volker, as release manager I need this bug to be fixed, so I'm going to apply your version, even though I still prefer to fix the potential problem on all systems.

Unfortunately, David Kirkby's OpenSolaris machine is down for the moment, so I cannot test your patch (although it should work).
