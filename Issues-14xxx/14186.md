On a coerced binary operator

```
@coerce_binop
__op__(x,y,**kwds)
}}

if y has to be coerced but x does not change its parent, the keyword arguments are not correctly passed.

A real example

{{{
sage: R1=QQ['x,y']
sage: R2=QQ['x,y,z']
sage: f=R1(1)
sage: h=R2(1)
sage: h.gcd(f,algorithm='modular')
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
...
TypeError: algorithm algorithm not supported
}}}

It is a one-line fix.

By the way, if a binary method with keyword values that is not decorated

```
__op__(self, y, method='z')
```

One can call it with `x.__op__(y, 'preferred_method')`

But once it is decorated this is not possible and key=value arguments are mandatory. Is this inteded?
