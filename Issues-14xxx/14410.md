Currently ATLAS build static libraries without problems on Cygwin, but the autotools build system crafted by Volker which uses libtool fail to repackage them into shared one.
Indeed:
* on usual platforms libtool already rants that it should not pack non-libtool objects (extracted from the static libs) together.
* on Cygwin it just refuses to do so, and I could not find a flag to get the usual behavior (i.e. "rant but do it").
The solution is to replace the libtool invokations by direct invocations to gcc and gfortran (or even ld if you feel adventurous).
See https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/10508#comment:392

Use:
* http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jpflori/spkg/atlas-3.10.1.p7.spkg

This also allows building ATLAS by default on Cygwin.

Why are you moving the build dir into src? The whole point of a separate build dir is to keep it separate from the sources.

Hum, don't really know.
I wanted to get something consistent with how the ATLAS-lib dir is treated so I made a choice between:
* moving ATLAS-build to the (first level of) src,
* making a copy of ATLAS-lib below src before building the autotools project,
* making something more sensible and more complicated.

I also hesitated, but I think keeping it in the spkg-install script, either as dead code or as a comment, cannot hurt.
You can argue that it is saved into the hg history anyway.

Replying to [@jpflori](#comment%3A10):
> I also hesitated, but I think keeping it in the spkg-install script, either as dead code or as a comment, cannot hurt.

It can, e.g. the next person might think that you really wanted to enable that but could not at that time for some unknown reason...

For the record this should only:
* fix a bug in spkg-install which thought that the serial shared libraries were built even when not and so left the sage install without any ATLAS libraries,
* let ATLAS build on Cygwin without any impact on other systems,
* clean spkg-check.
So this is not so intrusive for usual systems and I wouldn't mind that Jeroen includes it in 5.13 if it's not too late (as the two other easy and (hopefully) Cygwin-only spkg fixes at #15365 and #15366).

The Changelog inside `SPKG.txt` is wrong:

```
=== atlas-3.10.1.p6, lapack-3.4.2 (Volker Braun, 11 October 2013) ===
 * Trac #15270: Do not give up if the upstream shared library build
   fails
 * Solaris / ZFS fixes

=== atlas-3.10.1.p6, lapack-3.4.2 (Jean-Pierre Flori, 7 November 2013) ===
 * Trac #14410: Let ATLAS build and install shared libraries on Cygwin.
 * Bunch of modifications to the autotools project generating shared libraries
   so that it does not invoke libtool on Cygwin.
 * Fix a bug in spkg-install.
```

These two entries should be switched and the version number (atlas-3.10.1.**p7**) corrected.
