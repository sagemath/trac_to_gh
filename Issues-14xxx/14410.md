Currently ATLAS build static libraries without problems on Cygwin, but the autotools build system crafted by Volker which uses libtool fail to repackage them into shared one.
Indeed:
* on usual platforms libtool already rants that it should not pack non-libtool objects (extracted from the static libs) together.
* on Cygwin it just refuses to do so, and I could not find a flag to get the usual behavior (i.e. "rant but do it").
The solution is to replace the libtool invokations by direct invocations to gcc and gfortran (or even ld if you feel adventurous).
See http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/10508#comment:392

Use:
* http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jpflori/spkg/atlas-3.10.1.p7.spkg

This also allows building ATLAS by default on Cygwin.

Hum, don't really know.
I wanted to get something consistent with how the ATLAS-lib dir is treated so I made a choice between:
* moving ATLAS-build to the (first level of) src,
* making a copy of ATLAS-lib below src before building the autotools project,
* making something more sensible and more complicated.

I also hesitated, but I think keeping it in the spkg-install script, either as dead code or as a comment, cannot hurt.
You can argue that it is saved into the hg history anyway.

<a id='comment:20'></a>The Changelog inside `SPKG.txt` is wrong:

```
### atlas-3.10.1.p6, lapack-3.4.2 (Volker Braun, 11 October 2013)
 * Trac #15270: Do not give up if the upstream shared library build
   fails
 * Solaris / ZFS fixes

### atlas-3.10.1.p6, lapack-3.4.2 (Jean-Pierre Flori, 7 November 2013)
 * Trac #14410: Let ATLAS build and install shared libraries on Cygwin.
 * Bunch of modifications to the autotools project generating shared libraries
   so that it does not invoke libtool on Cygwin.
 * Fix a bug in spkg-install.
```

These two entries should be switched and the version number (atlas-3.10.1.**p7**) corrected.
