Hey Ben,

One small doc thing slipped past me in the new patch; on line 18, you have

```
    Does not work with :funct:`TensorProductOfCrystals`.
```

but the link should be <code>:func:\`TensorProductOfCrystals\`</code>. Could you repost the patch with this change please?

Thanks,

Hi Ben,

I just pushed some changes to your patch to the sage-combinat queue (since there were trailing white spaces). Please pull from there to get them .

Also, for the very last method "subcrystal" could you please add a description.

Other than that the patch looks good to me. Once you make the change and are happy with my changes, please upload on trac and set a positive review on my behalf!

Anne
