The semiring of species can be completed to form the ring of "virtual species", which are certain equivalence classes of formal differences of species. Among other benefits, this allows the "compositional inverse" of a species to be defined. It turns out that virtual species have well-defined cycle index series (which may have negative coefficients).

This patch adds code to compute the cycle index of the "combinatorial logarithm" virtual species, which is the compositional inverse of the species of nonempty sets. Among other things, this can be used to extract the cycle index of a species of "connected F-structures" from the cycle index for the species F. (The standard example is the case of the species G of simple graphs.)

I believe this code is functional and complete.
