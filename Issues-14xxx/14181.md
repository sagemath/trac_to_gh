```
Implement:

```
sage: square_from_vertices = Polyhedron(vertices = [[1, 1], [1, -1], [-1, 1], [-1, -1]])
sage: square_from_vertices.plot()
sage: square_from_vertices.plot(wireframe=False)
```
In the later case, only the two-dimensional piece of the polyhedron is drawn, and not its wireframe: vertices and edges.

This feature is implemented by #14175.

Depends on #14175

You can, in principle, only drawn projections in 2 or 3 dimensions. There is no such thing as "drawing a non-projected polyhedron".

If you want to implement your own plotting style then you should create the projection and use the methods of the `Projection` object directly.

I guess there is a misunderstanding here:-)

This ticket is just about drawing *without outline* Polyhedrons living in a dimension 2 ambient space. This is all I need for #4327.

If I mentionned projections that's just because, if someone would want the same feature for a Polyhedron that has been projected in dimension 2, then this is not yet handled by this patch.

I think I understand what you want, but it is at odds with the strict separation of polyhedron and its projection that I very much would like to keep in the code. 

Having more control about the plot output is definitely desirable, but I find `outline` as a keyword very confusing. `X.plot(outline=True)` sounds like it ought to plot **only** the outline of `X`, but thats not what you propose.

If you just want to draw a polygon you only need

```
sage: P = Polyhedron([(0,0),(1,0),(0,1)])
sage: polygon2d(P.vertices())
```

+Implement:
 
 ```
 sage: square_from_vertices = Polyhedron(vertices = [[1, 1], [1, -1], [-1, 1], [-1, -1]])
 sage: square_from_vertices.plot()
-sage: square_from_vertices.plot(outline=False)
+sage: square_from_vertices.plot(wireframe=False)
 ```
 In the later case, only the two-dimensional piece of the polyhedron is drawn, and not its outline: vertices and edges.
 
-This patch only handles for non projected polyhedron plots. But that's all we need for #4327 :-)
+This feature is implemented by #14175.
