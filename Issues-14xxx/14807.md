Sage ("the library") needs a build system that works inside and outside of sage ("the distribution").

This ticket integrates the build systems for the parts of `sagelib` into the current toplevel build system.

<a id='comment:22'></a>Hi Erik.

maybe you can reycle the configure.ac (and most path related patches) for sagelib. the canonical transition would be to reuse the python build system for a start (templatize setup.py, call it from make...)

i could not get anywhere before rewriting the whole thing to automake, as setup.py did/does not work (until today?). mostly due to

- lack of automatic dependency tracking
  (C/C++ compilers only write makefiles, setup.py does not use them. cython -MF is not ready yet)
- missing VPATH builds
  (requirement for mere sanity, also for distcheck, cf. #21469),

rendering the approach useless for debugging/development on foreign distros.

eventually all this was of no use for sage (the distribution) until a functional top-level build system would be in place. it might still facilitate packaging and use...

i am not totally up to date with the recent (last ~3 years) changes, and YMMV.

hi Jeroen

the reason i pulled in autotools was initially just autoconf. if you can make autoconf+setup.py.in work, then you don't need automake. likewise, if you reimplement autoconf in python etcpp. there are many ways, most of which involve "implement a viable alternative to autotools", which in my understanding is beyond the scope of this project.

> I don't know if that has ever been done.


automake supports python for a loong time. i am not "trying to use" rather than "suggesting" to use it. the cython rules i wrote for sagelib back then are now in use for another project (where, coincidentally, cython is used on some interface code).

> I guess that distros would hate us for doing that.


that i don't understand. package maintainers usually keep saying things like "people, use auto{conf,tools,make}". cannot think of a way that would make packageing any easier. (care to explain?)

...as alternative to home-brew build systems. But I have never seen a package maintainer say that as alternative to `setup.py`.

true/plausible. the typical python package has simple dependencies and does not use cython. no need for a chainsaw.

still, i see no evidence why someone might "hate us" for using auto* (for whichever sort of package). instead (let me repeat), the autotools implement
- VPATH
- (pre build) configuration
- (compile time) dependencies
- a make based build process
all of which immediately facilitate development, testing, debugging and thus packaging.

The autotools implement that for a typical C/C++ package. They don't really implement all that for Python packages. Which means that we have to implement that ourselves.

at least the four bullet points are intended to work for a lot more, including python packages [1]. arguably, to compile cython stuff, some custom (make) rules are required, but we had that. and it could be changed (=moved into automake).

> They don't really implement all that


what exactly do you mean? please give an example.
