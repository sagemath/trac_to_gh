Hi Erik.

maybe you can reycle the configure.ac (and most path related patches) for sagelib. the canonical transition would be to reuse the python build system for a start (templatize setup.py, call it from make...)

i could not get anywhere before rewriting the whole thing to automake, as setup.py did/does not work (until today?). mostly due to

- lack of automatic dependency tracking
  (C/C++ compilers only write makefiles, setup.py does not use them. cython -MF is not ready yet)
- missing VPATH builds
  (requirement for mere sanity, also for distcheck, cf. #21469),

rendering the approach useless for debugging/development on foreign distros.

eventually all this was of no use for sage (the distribution) until a functional top-level build system would be in place. it might still facilitate packaging and use...

i am not totally up to date with the recent (last ~3 years) changes, and YMMV.

hi Jeroen

the reason i pulled in autotools was initially just autoconf. if you can make autoconf+setup.py.in work, then you don't need automake. likewise, if you reimplement autoconf in python etcpp. there are many ways, most of which involve "implement a viable alternative to autotools", which in my understanding is beyond the scope of this project.

> I don't know if that has ever been done.

automake supports python for a loong time. i am not "trying to use" rather than "suggesting" to use it. the cython rules i wrote for sagelib back then are now in use for another project (where, coincidentally, cython is used on some interface code).

> I guess that distros would hate us for doing that.

that i don't understand. package maintainers usually keep saying things like "people, use auto{conf,tools,make}". cannot think of a way that would make packageing any easier. (care to explain?)

true/plausible. the typical python package has simple dependencies and does not use cython. no need for a chainsaw.

still, i see no evidence why someone might "hate us" for using auto* (for whichever sort of package). instead (let me repeat), the autotools implement
- VPATH
- (pre build) configuration
- (compile time) dependencies
- a make based build process
all of which immediately facilitate development, testing, debugging and thus packaging.

The autotools implement that for a typical C/C++ package. They don't really implement all that for Python packages. Which means that we have to implement that ourselves.

at least the four bullet points are intended to work for a lot more, including python packages [1]. arguably, to compile cython stuff, some custom (make) rules are required, but we had that. and it could be changed (=moved into automake).

> They don't really implement all that

what exactly do you mean? please give an example.

There's also progress being made on standardizing a \"source distribution\" format for Python packages that isn't necessarily tied to any one build system.  This means it will be fine, for example, to use autoconf to build Sage.

I have mixed feelings about the whole thing, but it's worth noting that it's getting closer and closer to the point where what's in `setup.py` won't matter as much as it does now.  distutils is still the "easiest" way to build Python modules, so somewhere in there there will still likely be a setup.py for a while.

But there's been *some* progress on better supporting binary wheels on Linux (see for example https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0513/, though that obviously doesn't cut it for Sage).  There's also progress being made on standardizing a "source distribution" format for Python packages that isn't necessarily tied to any one build system.  This means it will be fine, for example, to use autoconf to build Sage.  It's fine now, even, it just doesn't fit in as as well (yet) with the Python ecosystem.

I think regardless, it will also help to further break up sage so that Python wrappers for its various dependencies are external projects themselves.  I realize that's a much bigger problem though and not always practical.

Numpy has a similar system (used also by Scipy), but matplotlib's is a bit cleaner (even it has a few things I would do a little differently, but the concept is sound).
