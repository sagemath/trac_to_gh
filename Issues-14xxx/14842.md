Hellooooooooooooooooo !!!

Wow ! Very nice patch, very clean, nothing to say about that. Thouuuuuuuuuughh could you make your doctest a bit faster to check ? Right now listing all benzenoids with 12 hexagons eats all my memory and listing all those that have 10 vertices is already quite resource-consuming. Would you mind making this a 9 instead ? It's already around 6505 graphs, and takes 10 seconds on my computer `^^;`

By the way it is nice that the code is GPL, maybe this package will eventually make it to Sage's standards spkg `:-)`

Added a new version of the patch. I accidently forgot to overwrite the previous one, so only the second patch is needed.

Changes the doctest is no problem. I more or less randomly choose the value, but indeed, it is quite high.
