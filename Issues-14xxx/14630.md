Symbolic expressions in sage are by default assumed complex. There is a maxima variable, called the "simplification domain," which affects whether or not it simplifies `sqrt(x^2)` to `abs(x)`. Since our expressions are complex, we set the simplification domain to complex, but provide no easy way to change it.

By adding a `simplify_real()` method to Expression, we give the user a way to perform the aforementioned simplification by declaring his expression real.

This might provide a quick fix for #14305. See also:

Whoops, I forgot to call `forget()`; the comment was correct. I fixed it and added a doctest to ensure that no new assumptions remain after the call.

I didn't mean that the user has to `assume()` anything, only that we have to assume things are real in the traditional sense. You can call `simplify_real()` on an expression containing complex variables, but the answer might not make sense.

Expressions *should* be complex everywhere. I believe there are one or two functions which treat them as real, but they're documented to do that, so it's fine.

If instead of `simplify_rational`, `simplify_log`, etc. we had `simplify(rational=True, log=True,...)` that's what I would have done. As it is, if you want to do both rational and log simplifications, you just have to do `expr.simplify_rational().simplify_log()`.

Particularly with `simplify_real()`, it only does one specific thing that isn't done by other methods so you can be somewhat confident that `simplify_foo().simplify_real()` will give you both simplifications. In other words I don't think you'd get a nicer expression back by setting the simplification domain to real before `simplify_rational()` than you would by calling the two in succession.

Well I'd say this feels like mixing different concepts. The log, radical, etc. are about the form of the expression that's going to be transformed, whereas the domain is about the values the variables in the expression may take.

You're right that sometimes the application of simplifications in different order yields different results. But I find this rather annoying (not that I know how to fix it). By adding even more functions to the mix we make this situation even worse. 

I usually use simplify_full(). So as I understand it I'd always need to call simplify_full() and simplify_real() in some order to benefit from the knowledge about the domain.

And then I'm still left wondering if there are simplifications in simplify_full() hat could benefit from this knowledge too, but didn't get it because there's only simplify_real() and not simplify_full_real().

Is there a list of which simplify_* function could use this domain parameter?

The `simplify_radical()` method will change the expression `sqrt(x^2)` to either `x` or `-x` "consistently but arbitrarily.". This is not really a simplification, since it gives the wrong answer in the default case, so beware using `simplify_full()`. All of the rest could be combined with `simplify_real()` in some way.

This is way better than what we currently have to do:

```
sage: maxima_lib.eval('domain: real;')
'real'
sage: (sqrt(x^2)).simplify()
abs(x)
sage: maxima_lib.eval('domain: complex;')
'complex'
```

but still does two things undesirably:

1. The user has to know about the maxima_domain() call, and there's no easy way to find out about it. This is in contrast with `x.<tab>` "what can I do with this expression?"

2. It ties the simplification to the maxima backend. If we ever want to use sympy or some other backend, we're going to have a mess.

You'd need to document that the user of the context manager should make sure to not relinquish control inside the context manager. Thanks to "yield" in python, lexical enclosure doesn't necessarily mean runtime enclosure.

This seems fine, given that it is extremely unlikely a context manager will appear and that having many options seems undesirable.  However, if someone gets a sage-devel discussion on this going I'm not going to stop them.

```
sage: A = e^(sqrt(x^2))
sage: A
e^(sqrt(x^2))
sage: A.simplify_real()
e^abs(x)
```
I was pleased this worked, wasn't sure how much it would do.  Maybe the following would be a useful test to show what it does and doesn't do.

```
sage: var('y z')
(y, z)
sage: A = e^(sqrt(x^2)+sqrt(y^2)+sqrt(i*z^2))
sage: A.simplify_real()
e^((-1)^(1/4)*abs(z) + abs(x) + abs(y))
```
Here's another one that, again, pleasantly works as one would think.

```
sage: C = (x^2+y^2).imag()
sage: C
2*imag_part(x)*real_part(x) + 2*imag_part(y)*real_part(y)
sage: C.simplify_real()
0
```
Now if only we *had* to use this for the following simplification!

```
sage: B = conjugate(z)
sage: B.simplify_real()
z
sage: B.simplify()  # wa-wa "you lose" noise - #6862
z
```
