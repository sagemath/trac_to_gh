```

sage -t plot.py

     ('legend_label', None), ('rgbcolor', 'green'), ('thickness', 4),

Got:

So it's probable that something changed between `5.11.rc0` and `5.12.beta3` which is not reflected in the combinat queue. I'm going to set this to positive review and build `5.12.beta3` today and report back if I get a doctest failure.
