This small patch implements some little improvements to root system plots:

- Configurable arrow tip size
- Thicker 0-walls to highlight the fundamental polygon and its translates

TODO, in this ticket or later: "a4" "a4l" options for bounding box to optimize the bounding box for print outs on a4 / a4 landscape paper.

Should we wait until the patchbot raises from the deads, before we give a positive review ?

Now I get (with `sage-5.11.rc0` in the combinat queue):

```
sage -t root_lattice_realizations.py

sage -t plot.py

So it's probable that something changed between `5.11.rc0` and `5.12.beta3` which is not reflected in the combinat queue. I'm going to set this to positive review and build `5.12.beta3` today and report back if I get a doctest failure.
