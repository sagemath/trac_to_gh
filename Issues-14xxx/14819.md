- Configurable arrow tip size
- Thicker 0-walls to highlight the fundamental polygon and its translates

TODO, in this ticket or later: "a4" "a4l" options for bounding box to optimize the bounding box for print outs on a4 / a4 landscape paper.

Should we wait until the patchbot raises from the deads, before we give a positive review ?

Now I get (with `sage-5.11.rc0` in the combinat queue):

```
sage -t root_lattice_realizations.py
    [450 tests, 49.10 s]
sage -t plot.py

File "plot.py", line 1091, in sage.combinat.root_system.plot.PlotOptions.?
Failed example:

Expected:
    [('alpha', 0.500000000000000), ('legend_color', None),
     ('legend_label', None), ('rgbcolor', 'green'), ('thickness', 4),
     ('zorder', 1)]
Got:
    [('alpha', 0.500000000000000), ('legend_label', None), ('rgbcolor', 'green'), ('thickness', 4), ('zorder', 1)]

```

So it's probable that something changed between `5.11.rc0` and `5.12.beta3` which is not reflected in the combinat queue. I'm going to set this to positive review and build `5.12.beta3` today and report back if I get a doctest failure.

Replying to [tscrim](#comment%3A6):
> So the patchbot responds with a doctest failure, which has the extra option of `('legend_color', None),`. I have no idea where this comes from, nor why it only shows up for the patchbot... Nicolas, Frederic, any ideas? Or since we're getting different outputs, should we just mark the test as `# random`?


Or with some properly placed "..." ?

In any cases, thanks guys for reviewing this ticket!
