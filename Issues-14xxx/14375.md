It's essentially undefined, it could be anything. But it could be UTF-8 with a `\x9b` byte appearing not from a CSI.

Unrelated: I really like Python's `.*?` for regular expressions, this is a nice use of that.

Indeed, see #14153.

Put it a different way: imagine we see a `\x9b` in doctest output, which is more likely:
1. It is part of a UTF-8 sequence.
2. It is a CSI code in a different encoding.

I would say the first is more likely.

If we ever have a `\x9b` byte coming out of a doctest, I'd like it to fail doctesting so that we can figure out what it actually was.  Perhaps we should look for that byte and raise an error message referencing this ticket?

Which simply means that the encoding is "undefined". It's not the opposite of UTF-8. It's maybe UTF-8, maybe something else.

> Once we switch to unicode

"We" already partially switched to UTF-8: Sage source files are UTF-8 and some terminals (more and more these days) use UTF-8 encoding by default.

> At no point is it a good idea to match for UTF-8 encoded escape sequences imho.

Fair enough, but I think matching literal `\x9b` bytes is even worse.

The terminal has no say in doctesting. The "want" is UTF-8 (or at least comes from the UTF-8 encoded sage source), but the "got" is whatever byte string was printed by the worker.
