It's essentially undefined, it could be anything. But it could be UTF-8 with a `\x9b` byte appearing not from a CSI.

Unrelated: I really like Python's `.*?` for regular expressions, this is a nice use of that.

Indeed, see #14153.

What I'm trying to say is that the current string version of the doctesting framework might see byte strings encoded as UTF-8, even when not using the `unicode` type. Remember that Sage uses UTF-8 encoded source files, so any strings defined in doctests will be encoded as UTF-8.

Which simply means that the encoding is "undefined". It's not the opposite of UTF-8. It's maybe UTF-8, maybe something else.

> Once we switch to unicode

"We" already partially switched to UTF-8: Sage source files are UTF-8 and some terminals (more and more these days) use UTF-8 encoding by default.

> At no point is it a good idea to match for UTF-8 encoded escape sequences imho.

Fair enough, but I think matching literal `\x9b` bytes is even worse.

The terminal has no say in doctesting. The "want" is UTF-8 (or at least comes from the UTF-8 encoded sage source), but the "got" is whatever byte string was printed by the worker.
