This is similar to #14883 in that it removes a multiplication of a permutation by the identity permutation. This time the multiplication was not useless (it was meant to coerce the permutation into a symmetric group of large enough size), but that is easier done by just concatenating lists (given that the result is only needed as a list). There is a minor speedup (577µs to 496µs on the one of the doctested examples), but the purpose of this patch is really to replace a hack by a more logical manipulation.

Travis, feel free to fold this into your patch if you wish.

Depends on #14101

<a id='comment:4'>**Comment 4:**</a>
Hey Darij,

I believe taking the copy slice `w[:]` of `w` is unnecessary.

```
sage: L = [1, 2, 3]      
sage: k = L + [3, 5, 6]
sage: L
[1, 2, 3]
```
Could you remove this and repost?

Thanks,

Travis
