It turns out that, in principle, one could download a binary of Sage, and then *before starting* try to install an optional spkg.  If that spkg depends on one of the things which `sage-location` changes the hardcoding location of, then compilation will fail.

This happened with graphviz, for example; see [comment:5](#comment%3A5):ticket:7438.  See also [this sage-devel thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/sage-devel/KVaRN7l-5oo).

Then please add the file triggering the run of `sage-location` to any bdist.

`sage-location` is already run too often, and meanwhile does a lot of things regardless whether it's necessary or not, taking pretty long on slow media.

Yes, I totally agree, just am not sure how else to resolve this.

Basically, we just need a way to ensure that before *anything* else happens with a bdist run for the first time, including a new spkg, `sage-location` is run.

We now run `sage-location` at `./sage -b` instead.

It's not really a problem since `sage-location` only does something if needed (e.g. install moved or package installed).

`sage-location` is always run when starting Sage (and this has always been so).

Maybe I misread this, then.

```
    if [ "$SAGE_BANNER" != "no" ]; then
        cat "$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/sage-banner"
    fi
```
So... now we *will* be printing the banner when doing a search, since you removed

```
SAGE_BANNER="no" 
```
this?  Or... I guess if you don't run `sage_setup` you don't have to use that at all, huh.

Okay.  I haven't got a recent enough version of Sage built to check that this applies and really does work, but in principle this is good, thank you for the quick work!

I just tried it and it seems that `sage-location` is indeed run:

```
