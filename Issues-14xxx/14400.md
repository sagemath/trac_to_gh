It turns out that, in principle, one could download a binary of Sage, and then *before starting* try to install an optional spkg.  If that spkg depends on one of the things which `sage-location` changes the hardcoding location of, then compilation will fail.

This happened with graphviz, for example; see [#7438 comment:5](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/7438#comment:5).  See also [this sage-devel thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/sage-devel/KVaRN7l-5oo).

`sage-location` is already run too often, and meanwhile does a lot of things regardless whether it's necessary or not, taking pretty long on slow media.

Yes, I totally agree, just am not sure how else to resolve this.

Basically, we just need a way to ensure that before *anything* else happens with a bdist run for the first time, including a new spkg, `sage-location` is run.

We now run `sage-location` at `./sage -b` instead.

It's not really a problem since `sage-location` only does something if needed (e.g. install moved or package installed).

But my point is that one might do the following.
* Install a package (sage-location run)
* Start Sage without `-b`
And sage-location isn't run, but maybe it should be.  One ordinarily only has to do `sage -b` after an spkg if some files depend on that spkg somehow, but for some optional ones it might not (or one might forget to do it).

Anyway, just trying to make sure that we don't incur the converse problem to the one this ticket is about.

Point taken.

`sage-location` is always run when starting Sage (and this has always been so).

Maybe I misread this, then.

```
    if [ "$SAGE_BANNER" != "no" ]; then
        cat "$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/sage-banner"
    fi
```
So... now we *will* be printing the banner when doing a search, since you removed

```
SAGE_BANNER="no" 
```
this?  Or... I guess if you don't run `sage_setup` you don't have to use that at all, huh.

Okay.  I haven't got a recent enough version of Sage built to check that this applies and really does work, but in principle this is good, thank you for the quick work!

I just tried it and it seems that `sage-location` is indeed run:
