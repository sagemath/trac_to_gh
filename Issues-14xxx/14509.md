sage: K.< alpha,b > = FreeAlgebra(SR)
sage: latex(alpha*b)
\alphab
```
Someone we are not using `repr_lincomb` correctly, and in fact that function itself looks pretty hackishly defined.  I couldn't even find a very good workaround.

See [the first report at ask.sagemath](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/2535/latex-form-of-product-of-non-commuting-variables).

This fixes the latex, but the raw latex doesn't look good any more.
