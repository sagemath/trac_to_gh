I was trying to understand how doctesting work, and found "make ptestlong" was calling sage with a "--sagenb" option I didn't know -- and which neither "sage -h" nor "sage -advanced" knew.

I think the documentation for this switch should be added to the "sage -advanced" output.

I'd propose a patch, but I'm still trying to know what it does exactly...
