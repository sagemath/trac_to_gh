Unfortunately this is not limited to RDF:

```
sage: A = Set([QQ(0), QQ(1)/QQ(2)])                                                      
sage: A 
{0, 1/2}
sage: G = Graph()
sage: G.add_vertices(A)
sage: G.vertices()
[0]
```

My attempts at debugging this stop here:

```

                      self._cg_rev is not None)) # this will add the vertex

What is that mysterious `check_vertex` method and where can I find it?

EDIT: Oh, I found it. I have been grepping for "def check_vertex" but it is "cdef int check_vertex". Let me see.

I suspect the error is in `sage/graphs/base/c_graph.pyx`:

```
cdef int get_vertex(object u, dict vertex_ints, dict vertex_labels,
                    CGraph G) except ? -2:
    """
    Returns an int representing the arbitrary hashable vertex u (whether or not
    u is actually in the graph), or -1 if a new association must be made for u
    to be a vertex.

    TESTS:

    We check that the bug described in #8406 is gone::

        sage: G = Graph()
        sage: R.<a> = GF(3**3)
        sage: S.<x> = R[]
        sage: G.add_vertex(a**2)
        sage: G.add_vertex(x)
        sage: G.vertices()
        [a^2, x]

    And that the bug described in #9610 is gone::

        sage: n = 20
        sage: k = 3
        sage: g = DiGraph()
        sage: g.add_edges( (i,Mod(i+j,n)) for i in range(n) for j in range(1,k+1) )
        sage: g.vertices()
        [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]
        sage: g.strongly_connected_components()
        [[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]]

    """
    cdef int u_int
    if u in vertex_ints:

This "try/except" has apparently been written in the hope that if `u` is anything other than an integer, there will be an exception; but that reasoning fails because rationals and reals are silently converted into integers. Am I right? I'm unable to import methods from cython files into the sage console, so I can't test my conjectures...
