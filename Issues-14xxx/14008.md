(At least) some R packages can no longer be installed.

This is due to upstream's change of management of "lazy loading" : some packages version available through default repositories now expect to use this new mechanism, which is not available in R 2.14.0.

The best solution is probably to update the R version shipping with Sage. I have packaged  and tested it

I tried to download the spkg, but I keep getting a corrupt file (and it goes veeeery slow too). Could you upload it to a more reasonable hosting place?

* Another option is to ask for an account on the UW sage cluster (write directly to William). 
* You might also try Dropbox or Google Drive, I think they are much faster than free.fr...

An example is easy (but dangerous, see below), a doctest is not : installing an R package is **supposed** to have a **permanent** effect on the state of the installed system (an installed package stays installed between sessions). This, as far as I can tell, cannot be checked in a doctest.

Furthermore, a newly installed R package needs a restart of Sage to be usable (or so says the final message given by r.install.packages()).

An example is trivial : take example given for r.install_package(, which installs the R aami package). But :

* the side effect is to have the R package aami permanently installed, which is not necessarily a Good Thing(TM).
* if aami is already installed in the user's system, the example will fail.

One could implement the following pseudocode :

```
if (aami is installed) {
	uninstall it
	demonstrate the uninstallation
	reinstall it
	demonstrate the installation
} else {
	install it
	demonstrate the installation
	uninstall it
	demonstrate the uninstallation
}

```
But this might be a bit contrived for an example, no ?

An example which demonstrates the usefulness of this newer R version is to install the R package coda, I couldn't do that with sage 5.6 and R 2.14.0, I can do that with sage 5.6 and R 2.15.2.

HTH,

Somewhere I have a new doctest or something... some ticket talks about this.  I have tried many times, and I am convinced the restart is not necessary and we just added that message "to be sure".

This is consonant with my (limited) trials in Sage and my (somewhat more extensive) R experience. In less busy times, I'll have a look into this... But I have other fishes to fry first.
