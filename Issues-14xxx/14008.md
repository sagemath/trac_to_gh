(At least) some R packages can no longer be installed.

This is due to upstream's change of management of "lazy loading" : some packages version available through default repositories now expect to use this new mechanism, which is not available in R 2.14.0.

The best solution is probably to update the R version shipping with Sage. I have packaged  and tested it
Install the spkg from http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/dima/packages/r-2.15.2.p0.spkg
and apply the [patch](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/raw-attachment/ticket/14008/trac-14008.patch)

Sorry for the inconvenience : I didn't know that the trac server did not accept large files, and I had to jury-rig this a bit quickly...

A formal patch is on its way (I botched my first attempt by recompiling my modified sage too early, and I have to go back...).

An example is easy (but dangerous, see below), a doctest is not : installing an R package is **supposed** to have a **permanent** effect on the state of the installed system (an installed package stays installed between sessions). This, as far as I can tell, cannot be checked in a doctest.

Furthermore, a newly installed R package needs a restart of Sage to be usable (or so says the final message given by r.install.packages()).

An example is trivial : take example given for r.install_package(, which installs the R aami package). But :

* the side effect is to have the R package aami permanently installed, which is not necessarily a Good Thing(TM).
* if aami is already installed in the user's system, the example will fail.

One could implement the following pseudocode :

```
if (aami is installed) {
	uninstall it
	demonstrate the uninstallation
	reinstall it
	demonstrate the installation
} else {
	install it
	demonstrate the installation
	uninstall it
	demonstrate the uninstallation
}

```
But this might be a bit contrived for an example, no ?

An example which demonstrates the usefulness of this newer R version is to install the R package coda, I couldn't do that with sage 5.6 and R 2.14.0, I can do that with sage 5.6 and R 2.15.2.

HTH,

Somewhere I have a new doctest or something... some ticket talks about this.  I have tried many times, and I am convinced the restart is not necessary and we just added that message "to be sure".

Thanks to all people who guided my first (stumbling) steps in Sage maintenance and coped with somewhat stupid-in-hinsight questions.

This is consonant with my (limited) trials in Sage and my (somewhat more extensive) R experience. In less busy times, I'll have a look into this... But I have other fishes to fry first.

There are a few administrative issues with your package:
1. `SPKG.txt` mentions the deleted patch `install_parallel.patch` in the section "`Special Update/Build Instructions`", simply remove that item.
2. The Changelog header should be

```
### r-2.15.2.p0 (Emmanuel Charpentier, 25 January 2013)
```
1. You should commit (`hg rm patches/install_parallel.patch` and `hg commit`) the changes, `hg status` now reports

```
M SPKG.txt
! patches/install_parallel.patch
```
when it should report nothing.
