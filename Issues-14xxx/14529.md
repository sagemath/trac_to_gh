Hello!

I am not sure I have the energy to do that at the moment but its a nice task that we might want to address at some point. Hence I am leaving some stuff here for further reference.

The current implementation of the chromatic_polynomial uses the deletion-contraction recurrence directly. This gives us an exponential branching tree. The neat thing is that at some point some of the branches compute the chromatic polynomial for the same graphs (multiple - exponential) times!

A very dumb implementation in Python (see below) that is faster than the C code. It takes 700us to compute the chromatic polynomial of a random dense graph of order 15 and 74 minutes (!) with the C code currently used by Sage.

Of course this code needs more work and can be optimized even further  (perhaps by calling the C implementation under a threshold) but for now here it is.


```
global cache
cache = {}
def chrompoly(G):
    
    global cache 

    s = tuple(G.canonical_label().edges(labels=False))

    if s in cache:
        return cache[s]
    if not G.is_connected():
        return prod([chrompoly(C) for C in G.connected_components_subgraphs()])

    R = ZZ['x']
    x = R.gen()
    
    n = G.order()
    m = G.size()

    #  Since we know that G is connected it is enough to check the number of edges
    #  to test if it is a tree
    if m == n-1:
        return x*(x-1)**(n-1)

    u,v = G.edge_iterator(labels=False).next()

    G.delete_edge(u,v)
    p = chrompoly(G)
    G.add_edge(u,v)

    G2 = G.copy()
    G2.add_edges(((u,x) for x in G.neighbor_iterator(v)))
    G2.delete_vertex(v)

    ret = p - chrompoly(G2)
    
    cache[s] = ret 

    return ret 
```

Good! 

How do you think we should handle the global cache if this is to be made into a proper patch?

What I would like to do is have a global `____sage_very_very_private__cache__chrompoly___dict = {} ` variable outside the function and delete the cache each time the computation is over. In addition I would have a parameter keep_cache that keeps the cache alive (convenient when you're computing the polynomial in a loop)

What do you think?

Also whom would you send an email to?

Helloooooooo !

> How do you think we should handle the global cache if this is to be made into a proper patch?

Hmmm... Well, there is the `@`cached_method decorator, that automatically manages the cache of any function. But you can't empty it automatically when the computations are done though.

Technically, what you can do is write a function A (without the decorator) which call function B (the real one, with the cached_method decorator). Before returning B's result, A would clear the cache of B.

I wouldn't go to such lengths before there is a real need, actually... If somebody computes one chromatic polynomial perhaps he will compute two, and ... well. It's up to you. To me caching the method with the cached_method decorator would do the job. and you can add in its documentation an explanation of how the cache can be cleared manually, with the `clear_cache` method.

The file seems to have been written by Robert Miller and Gordon Royle (just reading the copyright in the file itself). Robert Miller does not work on Sage anymore but should be interested (he's the one who initially wrote all the graph-related stuff in Sage. Backends included). And Gordon Royle may be interested too, though I probably never wrote to him `:-)`

Great thanks for the info! I'll read through that stuff and produce a proper patch. 

As for the "compute one or two,.." I would for example like to test the Birkhoff-Lewis conjecture for all planar graphs of some order and having such a cache alive through all the computation would be very nice.

Attached it is a proposed patch for the chromatic polynomial.

The new code is short, self-explanatory and incorrect. Due to the nature of the incorrectness I suspect that the edge contraction part of the code may not be correct.

Anyone happens to see the issue?

Helloooooooooooooooo Jernej !

Would it be possible to keep the old implementation too, and have the two reachable through the same function ? Something like ``g.chromatic_polynomial(implementation="Python/C")`` ?

We would be able to check correction of each of them with the other, and if we ever notice that we can do better by caching inside of the C function.

I have refreshed this ticket in a new branch. 

For caching, I prefer to avoid the `cached_function` tool as it forces repeated conversions between mutable and immutable graphs. So I use a method similar to the one used in `tutte_polynomial.py`. The only difference is the use a frozenset of edges instead of a sorted list (not sure if it's faster or not).

Concerning potential speed up, the new code is fast on graphs like `graphs.RandomGNP(14,0.8)` but very slow on `graphs.LCFGraph(24, [12,7,-7], 8)`. I have therefore let the previous implementation as default.

Nitpick: if you put the new "algorithm" argument at the end of the list, then existing code using e.g. `chromatic_polynomial(G, True)` won't suddenly start trying to pass in `algorithm=True`.

I still think the cache is still a good idea, but it probably won't be possible to keep your nice decorator implementation inside of a loop.

You can almost do it mechanically, although it looks pretty ugly at first. At the end of the function, you can imagine setting `G=H` and then replacing `chromatic_polynomial_with_cache(H)` with the body of the `chromatic_polynomial_with_cache` function. Then you'll be looking at two copies of the same code, and at the end, you can replace `chromatic_polynomial_with_cache(H)` once again with the body of the function; now you've got three copies of the code... and so on. "Stare long enough" and it will begin to look like something that can be written as a loop.

Which makes it sound easier than it usually is. I can give it a try. I've had to do this plenty of times to avoid running into python's recursion limit.

I pushed a new branch with a version without recursion.
It can certainly be improved, but it's so far the easiest solution I found.
It's faster than the recursive version, but still not competitive with the cython version.

Replying to [@dcoudert](#comment:32):
> I pushed a new branch with a version without recursion.

I really like this version, I think using a digraph to track the computation is rather elegant. And it performs much better than the recursive version on my machine.

I ran the non-recursive version under `%prun`, and found that much of the time is spent in `canonical_label()`. As a result, I was able to speed it up even more by installing bliss. That may be worth mentioning in the docs.

You might also want to reinstate the `cache` parameter, to allow the user to pass in his own cache? I haven't checked, but being able to maintain the same cache across multiple computations sounds like it would help, and it was specifically requested in [comment:8](#comment:8).

Finally, here are some micro-optimizations that don't really make a noticeable difference, but help in theory -- you can take them or leave them:

Thanks for the review. It's a nice algorithm that can be useful to some users.

It is often faster than the original implementation, even without reusing the cache. And recursive algorithms are IMO easier to teach and verify... not to mention the sanity check that it provides on the original implementation.

I have a confession to make: when I suggested removing the tail recursion, I was only talking about the *final* recursive call, not the earlier one. That would have provided less of a speedup, in exchange for being much easier to implement. So I feel a bit guilty that you spent so much time rewriting the whole thing. But your version is much faster than it would have with a recursive call remaining, and I learned a very nice way to model these computations in the future (that I intend to steal). So not that guilty =)

Anyway, thank you.
