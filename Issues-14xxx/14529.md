Hello!

I am not sure I have the energy to do that at the moment but its a nice task that we might want to address at some point. Hence I am leaving some stuff here for further reference.

The current implementation of the chromatic_polynomial uses the deletion-contraction recurrence directly. This gives us an exponential branching tree. The neat thing is that at some point some of the branches compute the chromatic polynomial for the same graphs (multiple - exponential) times!

A very dumb implementation in Python (see below) that is faster than the C code. It takes 700us to compute the chromatic polynomial of a random dense graph of order 15 and 74 minutes (!) with the C code currently used by Sage.

Of course this code needs more work and can be optimized even further  (perhaps by calling the C implementation under a threshold) but for now here it is.


```
global cache
cache = {}
def chrompoly(G):
    
    global cache 

    s = tuple(G.canonical_label().edges(labels=False))

    if s in cache:
        return cache[s]
    if not G.is_connected():
        return prod([chrompoly(C) for C in G.connected_components_subgraphs()])

    R = ZZ['x']
    x = R.gen()
    
    n = G.order()
    m = G.size()

    #  Since we know that G is connected it is enough to check the number of edges
    #  to test if it is a tree
    if m == n-1:
        return x*(x-1)**(n-1)

    u,v = G.edge_iterator(labels=False).next()

    G.delete_edge(u,v)
    p = chrompoly(G)
    G.add_edge(u,v)

    G2 = G.copy()
    G2.add_edges(((u,x) for x in G.neighbor_iterator(v)))
    G2.delete_vertex(v)

    ret = p - chrompoly(G2)
    
    cache[s] = ret 

    return ret 
```

Attached it is a proposed patch for the chromatic polynomial.

The new code is short, self-explanatory and incorrect. Due to the nature of the incorrectness I suspect that the edge contraction part of the code may not be correct.

Anyone happens to see the issue?

I don't.. It looks like I removed that check (which is present in the above code) when merging the patches.. FML... TNX for the spot on!

The code now works correctly!

Helloooooooooooooooo Jernej !

Would it be possible to keep the old implementation too, and have the two reachable through the same function ? Something like ``g.chromatic_polynomial(implementation="Python/C")`` ?

We would be able to check correction of each of them with the other, and if we ever notice that we can do better by caching inside of the C function.

I have refreshed this ticket in a new branch. 

For caching, I prefer to avoid the `cached_function` tool as it forces repeated conversions between mutable and immutable graphs. So I use a method similar to the one used in `tutte_polynomial.py`.

Nitpick: if you put the new "algorithm" argument at the end of the list, then existing code using e.g. `chromatic_polynomial(G, True)` won't suddenly start trying to pass in `algorithm=True`.

But my main question is: does cython optimize the tail call for a python "def" function in a pyx file? Since performance is the goal here... python itself will not turn the recursive call `return p - chromatic_polynomial_with_cache(H)` into something efficient. Instead, for large graphs, it will build up all of those function calls on the stack, and only evaluate them all when the entire computation is done. In short, it's just plain slow.

Cython may do better, since it compiles to C, and the C compiler is pretty smart. But does it in this case? I have no idea but I think it's worth investigating. If not, I would suggest rewriting the recursive call as a loop, since it's guaranteed to be much faster.

I still think the cache is still a good idea, but it probably won't be possible to keep your nice decorator implementation inside of a loop.

Which makes it sound easier than it usually is. I can give it a try. I've had to do this plenty of times to avoid running into python's recursion limit.

I pushed a new branch with a version without recursion.
It can certainly be improved, but it's so far the easiest solution I found.
It's faster than the recursive version, but still not competitive with the cython version.

I really like this version, I think using a digraph to track the computation is rather elegant. And it performs much better than the recursive version on my machine.

I ran the non-recursive version under `%prun`, and found that much of the time is spent in `canonical_label()`. As a result, I was able to speed it up even more by installing bliss. That may be worth mentioning in the docs.

You might also want to reinstate the `cache` parameter, to allow the user to pass in his own cache? I haven't checked, but being able to maintain the same cache across multiple computations sounds like it would help, and it was specifically requested in[comment:8](#comment%3A8).

It is often faster than the original implementation, even without reusing the cache. And recursive algorithms are IMO easier to teach and verify... not to mention the sanity check that it provides on the original implementation.

I have a confession to make: when I suggested removing the tail recursion, I was only talking about the *final* recursive call, not the earlier one. That would have provided less of a speedup, in exchange for being much easier to implement. So I feel a bit guilty that you spent so much time rewriting the whole thing. But your version is much faster than it would have with a recursive call remaining, and I learned a very nice way to model these computations in the future (that I intend to steal). So not that guilty =)

Anyway, thank you.
