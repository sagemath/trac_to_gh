### ntl-5.5.2.p2 (Leif Leonhardy, Jean-Pierre Flori, 6 June 2013)
* #14692: Patch upstream to use `$(MAKE)` (instead of `make`) in the generated
  Makefile (and in two scripts called from the Makefile which in turn invoke
  `make`).  As a consequence, also some parts are now properly built in
  parallel if `make` was told to use multiple jobs.
* Minor clean-up of `spkg-install` and `spkg-check`.
* Refactor and rename patches.

### ntl-5.5.2.p3 (Volker Braun, July 10 2013)
* #14692: Add spkg-src and track all files.

<a id='comment:5'></a>I guess I'm the culprit for the Cygwin patch...
As all the previous patches only have one purpose and touch only one file, it may be a good time to rename them, DoConfig and mfile are not really talkative.

Of course patching the same file multiple times with your new set of patches might be problematic.

<a id='comment:10'></a>Yeah, let's just do that.

To properly refactor we should split the libtool part in DoConfig.patch and merge it with mfile.patch into a libtool_flag.patch later and put the remaining part into a disable_help.patch.
Maybe move new.h.patch to new_singular.patch.
And properly document everything in SPKG.txt by reflecting what is done by which patch (although the names should be then more talkative).
But I can do that in a folow up ticket.
