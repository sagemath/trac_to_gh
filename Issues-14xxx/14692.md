I think it would be much better to have just one patch fixing this issue, instead of 3 (one per file). This makes it easier to document what the patch does (`SPKG.txt` should mention this patch).

Also, having just one patch makes it easier to report upstream (which should be done).

I guess I'm the culprit for the Cygwin patch...
As all the previous patches only have one purpose and touch only one file, it may be a good time to rename them, DoConfig and mfile are not really talkative.

Of course patching the same file multiple times with your new set of patches might be problematic.

Yeah, let's just do that.

To properly refactor we should split the libtool part in DoConfig.patch and merge it with mfile.patch into a libtool_flag.patch later and put the remaining part into a disable_help.patch.
Maybe move new.h.patch to new_singular.patch.
And properly document everything in SPKG.txt by reflecting what is done by which patch (although the names should be then more talkative).
But I can do that in a folow up ticket.

   `make`).  As a consequence, also some parts are now properly built in

I haven't checked if the "make writeable" part is really needed. But since it also depends on umask and since wrong permissions in tarballs are not that uncommon, I think its better to include it.

The ntl tarball is tiny and on a fast server, so I didn't need an option to use a local copy for writing/testing the script. If you need it, feel free to open a ticket with that feature request.
