### ntl-5.5.2.p2 (Leif Leonhardy, Jean-Pierre Flori, 6 June 2013)
* #14692: Patch upstream to use `$(MAKE)` (instead of `make`) in the generated
  Makefile (and in two scripts called from the Makefile which in turn invoke
  `make`).  As a consequence, also some parts are now properly built in
  parallel if `make` was told to use multiple jobs.
* Minor clean-up of `spkg-install` and `spkg-check`.
* Refactor and rename patches.

### ntl-5.5.2.p3 (Volker Braun, July 10 2013)
* #14692: Add spkg-src and track all files.

I guess I'm the culprit for the Cygwin patch...
As all the previous patches only have one purpose and touch only one file, it may be a good time to rename them, DoConfig and mfile are not really talkative.

Of course patching the same file multiple times with your new set of patches might be problematic.

Yeah, let's just do that.

To properly refactor we should split the libtool part in DoConfig.patch and merge it with mfile.patch into a libtool_flag.patch later and put the remaining part into a disable_help.patch.
Maybe move new.h.patch to new_singular.patch.
And properly document everything in SPKG.txt by reflecting what is done by which patch (although the names should be then more talkative).
But I can do that in a folow up ticket.
