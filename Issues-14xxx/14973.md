The idea of this work is to add some functions to linear_code.py and new decoding algorithms.
Theory and algorithms are taken from:  *I. Marquez-Corbella. A combinatorial Commutative Algebra Approach to Complete Decoding PhD thesis, University of Valladolid, 2013*.

Please document and test `__insert_nextnew()` as well. All new functions introduced in a patch should be tested.

You should rename `covering_rad()` to `covering_radius()`.

The documentation needs a spell check. Did you try building the documentation? I'm not sure if all of it is formatted properly.

The output of `weight_distribution_coset()` and `groebner_representation()` should be immutable, i.e., a tuple instead of a list. It might be better to reconsider the format of `groebner_representation()` altogether. A list of lists is not very mathematical. There are quite a few possibilities in Sage to represent various mathematical structures.

Please run your code through a pep8 checker: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pep8

In Python, you don't need to write `CC[len(CC) - 1]` to get the last element of a list. You can just say `CC[-1]`.

It seems that all your examples/tests use the same code. Can you add different examples which stress the code properly, covering corner cases, etc.?

Here goes the real patch:

-Right tests (Doctests already run)

-`_insert_nextnew()` documented and tested

-The functions `covering_rad()` was merged with `covering_radius()`, this function was already implemented but required optional GAP package guava.
Now you can indicate which method use. `Algorithm = "guava"` does the same that
the old `covering_radius()`  using guava. And `Algorithm = None` is my implemented
function.

-The output of `weight_distribution_coset()` is now a tuple.

About making output of `groebner_representation()` immutable: This function has been implemented
because in next step I'm going to use it for a decoding algorithm. And actually it's going to be more convenient
to change the output to a dictionary, though.

I'll document more examples. I'm testing `coset_leaders()` to determinate how big can be the length and dimension of the code before
the algorithm gets slow.

`degrevlex` in most of the cases reduce the number of operations to compute the `grobner_basis`.
Even that I'd like to leave it as option to the user, but maybe I should do this only for the function `groebner_basis()`(still at work)
In other cases like `grobner_representation()` and `coset_leaders()` I should use only `degrevlex`.

You're right
Actually the set of coset leaders it doesn't depend on the order, so at least for this function I'm doing the implementation without using `ETuple`. I also think that should speed up the computations.

`grobner_representation()` is going to be used in one of the decoding algorithm, so maybe I can also only use `degrevlex`, I'll discuss it with my mentors.

I will just add some comments about the last question: as Veronica already mentioned, for the decoding algorithm that Veronica is implementing (whose code will be public in the following days), the term ordering is important.

Note that for those cosets for which more than one coset leader exists the degree compatible ordering chosen will play an important role.

However, in general I will suggest to leave as default the "degrevlex" ordering for several reasons related to the preprocessing of the mentioned decoding algorithm.

Here is the patch with the last details fixed. And I added the GDDA algorithm. This algorithm with Hamming Codes and Random linear codes seems to be faster. 
For example I have tested(among others):

```
sage: C = HammingCode(5,GF(2))                                                                                                                                
sage: v = random_vector(GF(2),C.length())  
sage: v

I've been suggeste to use `timeit` instead of `time`  for benchmarking, so that's next. But with this results of time we can appreciate the differences among the differents decoding algorithms

The next patch is presented as result of a  GSoC  project 2013.


The work contains implementation of new decoding algorithms for linear codes proposed in "Combinatorial Commutative Algebra Approach to Complete Decoding", PhD Thesis, University of Valladolid, 2013  by Irene Marquez-Corbella.
Algorithms are called `"groebner representation"` and `"groebner basis"` and has been added to `sage.coding.decoder.py`
This algorithms has been hooked up with the `decode` function in `sage.coding.linear_code.py`, adding also a block of tests in which is explained the cases where this new algorithms performs better.

The patch  contains functions added to `sage.coding.linear_code.py` such as `coset_leaders`, `error_correcting_capacity`, `newton_radius`, `weight_distribution_coset`, and new algorithm to `covering_radius`.

Hmm.. I didn't notice these two issues before:

1. The `syndrome()` function is (strangely) duplicated in `decoder.py`

2. At some point during the GSOC, we made the output of `groebner_basis_singular` a list, to make the output similar to the output of the other `groebner_basis_fglm` function (which was probably named differently). Now, I feel that the generator itself should be returned, i.e., the return statement should be `return I.groebner_basis('libsingular:stdfglm')` because the output of this function is used sequentially, and used only once. Consequently, all the doctests should be changed to `list(groebner_basis_singular..)`.

Gitified, doctested and fixed some minor problems. `sage/coding/decoder` didn't use to show up in the reference manual, I added it to the "Coding theory" section and fixed some docstring bugs.

There where conflicts while importing the mercurial patches. It'd be better if the original author could check the merge was done right.
