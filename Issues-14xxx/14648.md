The FSF config.guess and config.sub shipped with MPIR 2.6.0 and some other packages are very old (timestamp says 2003 for the MPIR ones) and fail to recognize Cygwin64.
Latest upstream files at:
* http://git.savannah.gnu.org/gitweb/?p=config.git;a=blob_plain;f=config.guess;hb=HEAD
* http://git.savannah.gnu.org/gitweb/?p=config.git;a=blob_plain;f=config.sub;hb=HEAD
solves this issue.

MPIR report at:
* https://groups.google.com/d/msg/mpir-devel/kas57nK3UCU/li5-MMsEk_4J
* will be fixe by #15015

Other spkg affected:
* sqlite fixed at #16098.
* ecl (twice because of shipped but not used old GMP...) #9493.
* IML fixed here!

I'm changing this ticket to only take care of the outdated fsf config.* scripts.

The further problems with MPIR should go elsewher.

ROFL, three years ago: #9493.

(No idea whether the patch w.r.t. `install-sh` still applies or is at all still necessary.)

This patch is very bad. MPIR's `config.guess` is a custom script, it is not the autotools' version. See also the thread you linked to.

For example, it detects my machine as `sandybridge-unknown-linux-gnu`. With this patch, this becomes `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`.

Also, `Initial attempt.` is obviously a bad commit message.

Note that this vile hack just use standard files distributed by autoconf, not some files specifically crafted (well, the exact version is) by configure when it's run.

Not contacted IML though, I though the project was dead.
If not we should really work more with them to deal with the BLAS/linking hell in their build system.

Well we could give it a try. If there is no response then we should just make our own tarball with updated autoconf. Its not exactly a moving target ;-)  

I agree that the hack works, but its ugly and fragile if we change anything in the sage autoconf files (e.g. move to a different directory).

Got a reply and Arne would be very happy to make a new release.
Now it's time to think about what we should push upstream with regard to the build system (it may be a good time to provide support for different BLAS implem than ATLAS), bug fixes and so on.

Best post to sage-devel, such that the usual suspectives will notice, and/or cc some of those involved in the previous IML tickets (#748 (!), #9568 ...).
