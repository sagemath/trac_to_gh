The FSF config.guess and config.sub shipped with MPIR 2.6.0 and some other packages are very old (timestamp says 2003 for the MPIR ones) and fail to recognize Cygwin64.
Latest upstream files at:
* http://git.savannah.gnu.org/gitweb/?p=config.git;a=blob_plain;f=config.guess;hb=HEAD
* http://git.savannah.gnu.org/gitweb/?p=config.git;a=blob_plain;f=config.sub;hb=HEAD
solves this issue.

MPIR report at:
* https://groups.google.com/d/msg/mpir-devel/kas57nK3UCU/li5-MMsEk_4J
* will be fixe by #15015

Other spkg affected:
* sqlite fixed at #16098.
* ecl (twice because of shipped but not used old GMP...) #9493.
* IML fixed here!

This patch is very bad. MPIR's `config.guess` is a custom script, it is not the autotools' version. See also the thread you linked to.

For example, it detects my machine as `sandybridge-unknown-linux-gnu`. With this patch, this becomes `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`.

Also, `Initial attempt.` is obviously a bad commit message.

Hey Travis, I'll up my working (hopefully not only for me) branch a little later today.
In this very ticket I'll only update the FSF scripts.
In another one I'll put the magic needed for MPIR to build the correct ABI.

Note that this vile hack just use standard files distributed by autoconf, not some files specifically crafted (well, the exact version is) by configure when it's run.

If not we should really work more with them to deal with the BLAS/linking hell in their build system.
