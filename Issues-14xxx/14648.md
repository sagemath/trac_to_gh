The FSF config.guess and config.sub shipped with MPIR 2.6.0 and some other packages are very old (timestamp says 2003 for the MPIR ones) and fail to recognize Cygwin64.
Latest upstream files at:
* http://git.savannah.gnu.org/gitweb/?p=config.git;a=blob_plain;f=config.guess;hb=HEAD
* http://git.savannah.gnu.org/gitweb/?p=config.git;a=blob_plain;f=config.sub;hb=HEAD
solves this issue.

MPIR report at:
* https://groups.google.com/d/msg/mpir-devel/kas57nK3UCU/li5-MMsEk_4J
* will be fixe by #15015

Other spkg affected:
* sqlite fixed at #16098.
* ecl (twice because of shipped but not used old GMP...) #9493.
* IML fixed here!
