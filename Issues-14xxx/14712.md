Helloooooooooooo !!

This patch implements a veeeeeeeery basic Hypergraphs class whose only purpose is to draw them. It's very hard to get something meaningful, and I implemented it as I needed to draw many many many hypergraphs with less than 5 or 6 sets.

And it takes time to manually go through all the sets, and wonder how it should be drawn on a sheet of paper. I have heaps of them. This code made my life easier, and that's why I submit it as a patch even though it is pretty basic. If somebody thinks that it can prove useful to somebody else ...

In particular, even though I have been thinking hard about this for a long time, this patch does not contain any data structure for hypergraphs, nor the most basic hypergraphs functions. I haven't had the need to write one until now, and I don't want to write code that I do not need, for I don't believe that you can write good code that you don't use yourself `^^;`

.... though I will probably work on that in not so long.

Have fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuun !

P.S. : Oh, and this patch also fixes an awkwardness with TikZ and LaTeX : if you need to add a package to LaTeX in a `._latex_` method, you can now add the package to the preamble in the `._latex_` method itself and everything will run smoothly.

Excellent! That's been annoying for a while, and this seems the way to
do! I'd make it a separate ticket though since it's a pretty different
feature and could get a positive review almost instantly by itself
(though I would want to have the point of view of John or ...).

Hey Nathann,

Here's a review patch which removed the info from the latex output, does a basic explanation of a hypergraph, and makes some docstring tweaks.

The reason why I moved the info into the class definition is that the first thing I tried was `view(H, tightpage=True)` and I got a latex error. Also if you want to create a list of hypergraphs, there's no point in outputting the description everytime. Furthermore, putting it at the class level means it's easily available in the interactive documentation (where you are creating the pdfs).

If you're happy with my changes, go ahead and set this to positive review.

Best,

Travis

PS - I also would've preferred the latex part to be in a separate patch.

Hello !!

> I think a warning is a better approach to this than explicitly putting text in the pdf output because that broke my (basic) test. 


Methinks that it is a problem with `tightpage` more than a problem with my `_latex_` output.

> However there are many things in sage which have conventions that user may not necessarily see immediately (or wonder about particular outputs), but as long as it is clearly documented what our convention choices are, it's okay. 


It depends. Sometimes it is sufficient, when you believe that the user may not understand what the output means, and will then look for the documentation. But in this case I am 100% sure that the users will believe that they understand the output, and that it would be the same as returning a wrong result. The users definitely HAVE to read this thing once.

I will make it a warning in a split second.

The warning looks okay, but look at this hypergraph:

```
sage: H = Hypergraph([{1,2,3},{2,3,4},{3,4,5},{6,8},{7}])
sage: view(H)
```
I don't see an edge between 6 and 8. Also I get the following:

```
sage: H = Hypergraph([{1,2}])                    
sage: view(H)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-13-b92aa03e5aba> in <module>()
----> 1 view(H)
...
/home/travis/sage-5.10.rc1/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/graphs/hypergraph.pyc in _latex_(self)
    232             # "center", i.e. the vertex representing the set s
    233             cx,cy = pos[s]
--> 234             s = map(lambda x:pos[x],s)
    235             s = sorted(s, key = lambda (x,y) : arctan2(x-cx,y-cy))
    236 

TypeError: argument 2 to map() must support iteration
```
so something isn't quite working (similarly for any one set of vertices).

Edit/PS - For the next version of the patch which fixes the above, could you fold all of the patches into one?

We're getting there. Sets of size 1 are are drawn as isolated vertices. From the current construction which does not allow vertices not part of some (hyper)edge, there is no ambiguity with vertices not in some edge (and is not also rendered). Although you could draw them as a loop.

However now I'm not getting any colors. Also, why are the tests in `edge_coloring()` and `_spring_layout()` not test? Is it because their outputs are random? If so, I'd rather have them marked as `# random`. Thanks.

Hellooooooooo !

Wow cool. This code was much smarter than I thought `:-P`

> Although you could draw them as a loop.


Hmmm... I have a personal problem with loops.

> However now I'm not getting any colors. Also, why are the tests in `edge_coloring()` and `_spring_layout()` not test? 


Well, they are tested. One of the tests is disabled in each case because it may depend on the architecture indeed.

Done done ! `:-)`
