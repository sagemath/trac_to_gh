Two hardcoded timeouts default valued make some tests fail on Cygwin (presumably because Cygwin is slow, and forking is horribly slow):
* sage/tests/cmdline.py, the timeout value (current default 50.0 secs) of test_executable;
* sagenb/misc/misc.py, the alarm value (current default 1 sec) when launcing the notebook (which makes lauching the notebook tricky.
See [#6743 comment:144](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/6743#comment:144) and [#6743 comment:146](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/6743#comment:146)

Just slightly (from a human point of view) increasing these values let the tests pass on recent and even not so recent and powerful harware running Cygwin, so let's increase these default values unconditionnally rather than adding Cygwin specific code, or warnings about expected to fail tests or whatever; let's say:
* 100.0 secs in test_executable,
* 5 secs when launching the notebook.
