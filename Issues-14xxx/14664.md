Essentially what the ticket title says. Some publications require all the fonts to be embedded in the document and require the use of type-1 fonts. It is not very hard to enable these fonts.

This isn't really about type 1 fonts, right? You are switching TeXing labels on/off. How about calling it `plot(latex=bool)`. 

It would be nice if we could autodetect the prerequisites and default to the right thing.

It *is* about type 1 fonts, as far as I can tell. The first thing publications tell is that type 3 fonts should not be present in the document. Some of them silently fail when you try to upload your document - the upload website just says that the upload didn't succeed.

As for references, I found these links earlier:

* http://brainlogging.wordpress.com/2011/11/16/type-1-vs-3-fonts/

*About using `latex=bool`*:
Unless someone knows that matplotlib has its own math renderer and doesn't use latex by default for rendering math, it will not be clear that something like `latex=True` will switch fonts to type 1 fonts.

False
```
matplotlib [does not require latex](http://matplotlib.org/users/mathtext.html#mathtext-tutorial) to render math fonts.

Replying to [@vbraun](#comment%3A14):

I will do that in a day or two. I need to compile 5.10rc0 first.

> * If you change matplotlib rcParams then you should switch it back when you are finished

Not resetting the rcParams actually affects only those plots which are a mixture of Sage and (direct) matplotlib calls. Currently, there is nothing in Sage that actually does this. I will make the change nevertheless because there might be someone doing this manually.
