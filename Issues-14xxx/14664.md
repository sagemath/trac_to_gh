This isn't really about type 1 fonts, right? You are switching TeXing labels on/off. How about calling it `plot(latex=bool)`. 

It would be nice if we could autodetect the prerequisites and default to the right thing.

It *is* about type 1 fonts, as far as I can tell. The first thing publications tell is that type 3 fonts should not be present in the document. Some of them silently fail when you try to upload your document - the upload website just says that the upload didn't succeed.

As for references, I found these links earlier:
* http://nerdjusttyped.blogspot.sg/2010/07/type-1-fonts-and-matplotlib-figures.html
* http://matplotlib.1069221.n5.nabble.com/Type-1-font-in-figures-needed-td10294.html
* http://brainlogging.wordpress.com/2011/11/16/type-1-vs-3-fonts/

*About using `latex=bool`*:
Unless someone knows that matplotlib has its own math renderer and doesn't use latex by default for rendering math, it will not be clear that something like `latex=True` will switch fonts to type 1 fonts.

I am not sure if the latter is possible.
