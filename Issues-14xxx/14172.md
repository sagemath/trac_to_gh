The build of sage 5.7 stops during the build of the mpir-2.6.0.p0 package.

spkg/logs/mpir-2.6.0.p0.log is pasted at http://paste.debian.net/237529/

The problem seems related to some 32-bit architecture:

```
Building a 32-bit version of MPIR.
Building MPIR with the C++ interface and (also) static libraries.
** Building with "fat binary" support for 32-bit CPUs **
[...]
configure: error: ABI=32 is not among the following valid choices: standard
Error configuring MPIR (with CFLAGS unset).
```

The machine is running Debian wheezy, Linux 3.2.0-4-686-pae #1 SMP Debian 3.2.35-2 i686 GNU/Linux

I used the following sage variables :
- SAGE_FAT_BINARY='yes'
- SAGE_BINARY_BUILD='yes'
- SAGE_CHECK="yes"
- MAKE="make -j2"

Exporting ABI='standard' globally (see http://ask.sagemath.org/question/1713/error-installing-package-mpir-240p6) allows the mpir spkg to be built but then gap-4.5.7.p3 cannot be built since it also uses the ABI variable for which the value 'standard' does not make sense (it only accepts ABI=32 or ABI=64).


---

Just for completeness:  The previous spkg (and of course also vanilla MPIR 2.6.0) failed in exactly the same way when configured on (or with [`MPIR_CONFIGURE=`]`--host=`)`prescott-pc-linux-gnu`:

```
...
using ABI="standard"
      CC="gcc -std=gnu99"
      CFLAGS="-O2"
      CPPFLAGS=""
      CXX="g++"
      CXXFLAGS="-O2"
      MPN_PATH="  generic"
...
```

The new spkg also fixes this.

---

**New spkg:** [http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/leif/Sage/spkgs/mpir-2.6.0.p1.spkg](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/leif/Sage/spkgs/mpir-2.6.0.p1.spkg)

**md5sum:** `6e65bb989b0e5513371a35447b43b0da  mpir-2.6.0.p1.spkg`

Now patches `acinclude.m4`, `configure.in`, and `configure`.

(Changes now committed, and [bug report](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/mpir-devel/TyfWY6Mcm1A) and patches submitted upstream, too.)

### mpir-2.6.0.p1 (Leif Leonhardy, February 27th 2013)
* #14172: MPIR 2.6.0 (but also older versions) fails to configure on Intel
  "Core" CPUs (expecting ABI to be "standard" rather than "32", which is
  just one symptom).  (Similar for Pentium4 Prescott.)
  Add patch (`core-prescott-configure.patch`) fixing `acinclude.m4`,
  `configure.in`, and the generated `configure`, rebased to the patches we
  apply in advance.
  Patch(es) have been submitted upstream.

For reference, this is the current logic (originally for MPIR 2.4.0):

                echo "Building a 32-bit version of MPIR."
                ABI=32
            else
                # It seems the compiler does not support -m32 nor -m64 (e.g.
                # GCC on Itanium rejects both); do not set ABI at all.
                echo "Your compiler does not support '$CFLAG32' nor '$CFLAG64'.  Leaving ABI unset."
            fi
            rm -f foo foo.c
        fi
        ;; # Linux
```

---

If only MPIR (2.6.0) requires `ABI=standard` (rather than `ABI=32`, or left empty/unset), one should presumably only set it for building MPIR:

```
$ unset ABI # (or set it to "32" on 32-bit operating systems running on a 64-bit CPU)
$ make -k # continue as far as possible
$ env ABI=standard ./sage -i spkg/standand/mpir-2.6.0.p0.spkg
$ make # build the rest
```

That way (not *globally* setting `ABI=standard`) shouldn't cause problems with other spkgs (such as GAP).

We'll see whether we can tweak `spkg-install` (or patch MPIR's `configure`) to not require this manual intervention, although [from a previous thread on a similar problem]

It doesn't seem to matter whether the OS is 32- or 64-bit, it's just `core-*` that doesn't allow `ABI=32` nor `ABI=64`.

Note that (on `core-*`) with `ABI=standard`, the *generic C implementation* is chosen, which is odd.

Thierry, could you paste the output of `cat /proc/cpuinfo`?

I will see if i can found a log for the sage 5.6 build somewhere.

Note that is is sometimes good to be able to build a 32-bits sage system on a 64-bits machine. For example, i need this when building sage for a live USB key that aims to boot on a widest range of machines.

Sorry, I meant the output of running `config.guess` (you uploaded the file itself), but I guess it is just `core-pc-linux-gnu`.  (Its output would also be interesting for MPIR 2.4.0, although I doubt it'll differ.)

If you still have the Sage 5.6 installation (but not the logs in `spkg/logs/`), you could try reinstalling MPIR 2.4.0 with `./sage -f -s spkg/standard/mpir-2.4.0.p6.spkg`. (`-s` keeps the spkg build directory, where the source code (including `config.guess`) and `config.log` are located, even if no error occurred during the installation.)

Yes.  Some also prefer 32-bit versions for virtual machines (on 64-bit machines).

The safest way to produce (32-bit) binary dists is still to create them natively, on old machines.  (E.g., `ECM_CONFIGURE=--disable-sse2` is currently necessary for Pentium III and some older CPUs, which I only noticed while actually building on a Pentium III ...)

Thierry, could you give [this preliminary spkg](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/leif/Sage/spkgs/mpir-2.6.0.p1-preliminary.spkg) a try on your Intel Core machine?

Especially **without** `SAGE_FAT_BINARY=yes`, and `ABI` either unset or set to `32`.

(`SAGE_FAT_BINARY=yes` should also work; you could of course try that as well, but the former is more important / interesting.)

And attach the resulting spkg log(s) here...

Thanks.


P.S.:  If you're going to rebuild Sage or other spkgs depending on it with that, you should copy the spkg into `$SAGE_ROOT/spkg/standard/`.  (You can use `env SAGE_UPGRADING=yes make` after doing so, in order to rebuild all dependent spkgs as well, although this is likely to take quite some time.)

Attachment: **[mpir-2.6.0.p0-p1.diff.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket14172/mpir-2.6.0.p0-p1.diff.gz)**

Replying to [@nexttime](#comment%3A15):
> [Note to myself:]  I'll upload a slightly fixed spkg (also patching `acinclude.m4` and `configure.in` later<sup>TM</sup>, presumably tomorrow.  (I missed some places when manually patching [just] `configure`, but these are minor *I think<sup>TM</sup>*.)

Done.  Note: [New spkg](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/leif/Sage/spkgs/mpir-2.6.0.p1.spkg) also has a new name (`-preliminary` dropped).

Looks fine and build on a my (non problematic) system.

Just a little remark, I think you should tag the commit yourself as this is automatically done by Jeroen's scripts, though I think they are smart enough to realize you did it, so no worry.

I prefer tagging the changesets myself (and I'd appreciate if others did as well -- some do); doing so makes it easier to base spkgs on previous ones which haven't been merged yet (otherwise tags may even be missing).

The merger script shouldn't do anything with spkgs unless necessary, i.e., it should only perform sanity checks, and in case some of these fail, automagically modify the spkg if appropriate (which includes adding a missing revision tag).
