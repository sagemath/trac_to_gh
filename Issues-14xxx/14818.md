To access the PARI library functions related to the `t_FFELT` type for finite fields (see #12142), these functions need to be declared in `sage/libs/pari/decl.pxi`.  Also, wrappers for the functions `ffgen()` and `ffinit()` are missing.

I am attaching a patch, which will become a dependency of #12142.

Please add some doctests.

I know this will be indirectly doctested through further tickets, but it would be nice to have some example directly in the docstrings of ffgen and ffinit.

There is also a problem with the docstring for ffinit which mentions a polynomial P.

And the doc avout the v variable is kind of obscure.
In the docstring for get_var it's mentioned it should be a string or -1.
Here it seems you suggest it can be an integer.
Indeed, the PARI ffinit functions wants a long and will treat negative input in a special way, but the point of the call to get_var is to convert the var's string to the correct integer.
So either skip the get_var call or correcte the docstring.
I think the second option is better, and is what you wanted, isn't it?
