Pynac-0.7.0 uses Flint to get univariate series expansions. For comparison,

```
                                             now     previously
sin(x*sin(x*sin(x*sin(x)))).series(x,8)     50-55µs    13.7s
sin(x*sin(x*sin(x*sin(x)))).series(x,12)      69µs      >1min
sin(x*exp(x)).series(x,100)                  3.7ms     11.3s
sin(x*exp(x)).series(x,500)                  215ms       n/a
(sin(x+x^2)*cos(x+x^2)).series(x,1000)       2.86s       n/a
```

Extensive tests are added with #21730 under `tests/`. Pre-Pynac 0.7.0 the tests need 11s vs 0.2s with pynac-0.7.0.

Previous ticket description:

The following

```
f=sin(x*sin(x*sin(x*sin(x))))
f.series(x,8)
```
takes something like 30s, which seems a bit too much. Maybe there is some bottleneck somewhere ?
On the other hand, 

```
f.taylor(x,0,8)
```
is faster, but not lightning fast.

In the same spirit, one could try

```
sage: x=PowerSeriesRing(QQ,'x').gen()
sage: sin(x)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: cannot coerce arguments: no canonical coercion from Power Series Ring in x over Rational Field to Symbolic Ring
```
It would be good if one could apply symbolic functions to power series and get power series when possible.

Being able to apply functions to power series would be useful.

For anyone looking to implement this, note that flint can now natively evaluate elementary functions over `Q[This is the Trac macro *x* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#x-macro)` and `(Z/nZ)[This is the Trac macro *x* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#x-macro)` (using `fmpq_poly_sin_series` in this case).

GiNaC's series expansion code seems to be designed for very small orders only. It is incredibly inefficient otherwise:

```

> time(series(sin(x*sin(x*sin(x*sin(x)))), x==0, 8));
2.352s                                                                          
> time(series(sin(x*sin(x*sin(x*sin(x)))), x==0, 12));                         
40.104s                                                                         
```

Judging by the number of calls to `gcd`/`lcm` reported by `%prun f.series(x==0, k)` for successive `k`, the number of operations in ℚ seems to grow at least exponentially with `k`, and perhaps like `k!` (while it should be something like `O(k³)` in a naive implementation, and essentially linear in a careful one).

I think that's the heart of the problem, and the difference between the timings with sage and with ginsh is pynac overhead (which should of course be minimized, but only costs a constant factor).
