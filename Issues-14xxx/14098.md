I suspect that the problem is triggered when enabling the debugging code, furthermore zn_poly itself is built with -DNDEBUG regardless of SAGE_DEBUG=yes. I am wondering if it could cause the problem.

n is supposed to be a size_t so I think we have a gross overflow somewhere earlier. The value originates from here:

```

int
test_mpn_smp_kara (int quick)

   int success = 1;
   size_t n;

   for (trial = 0; trial < (quick ? 300 : 30000) && success; trial++)
      success = success && testcase_mpn_smp_kara (n);

   // now a few larger problems too
   for (trial = 0; trial < (quick ? 100 : 3000) && success; trial++)
   {
      n = random_ulong (3 * ZNP_mpn_smp_kara_thresh) + 2;      <======= n generated here.

<a id='comment:6'></a>On power7 it appears that ZNP_mpn_smp_kara_thresh is equal to SIZE_MAX which according to /usr/include/stdint.h is

```
/* Limit of `size_t' type.  */
# if __WORDSIZE == 64
#  define SIZE_MAX              (18446744073709551615UL)
# else
#  define SIZE_MAX              (4294967295U)
# endif
```
random_ulong is defined by

```
ulong
random_ulong (ulong max)
{
   return gmp_urandomm_ui (randstate, max);
}
```
so n needs to be size_t which is at most SIZE_MAX but the test generate a random number between 0 and 3 * SIZE_MAX + 2.
<sarcasm>
Oh dear! I wonder why that doesn't work.
</sarcasm>

I guess it is potentially fine if ZNP_mpn_smp_kara_thresh is not SIZE_MAX, I don't know how it is on other systems.

<a id='comment:8'></a>I am certainly poking at that. The value of ZNP_mpn_smp_kara_thresh is computed by the tuning code and it is clearly allowed to be equal to SIZE_MAX

```
   // generate tuning.c file
   printf (header);

   x = ZNP_mpn_smp_kara_thresh;
   printf ("size_t ZNP_mpn_smp_kara_thresh = ");
   printf (x == SIZE_MAX ? "SIZE_MAX;\n" : "%lu;\n", x);
```
So someone potentially set themselves for trouble in the test. However after inserting a few printf in the code the mystery deepens

```
mpn_smp_basecase()... ok
mpn_smp_kara()... test: src/mpn_mulmid.c:241: ZNP_mpn_smp_kara: Assertion `n >= 2' failed.

I didn't have the assertion before and after putting these we Abort rather than segfault.

<a id='comment:10'></a>I am the author.... thanks Paul for drawing my attention to this.

I haven't looked at this code for years so it's almost as mysterious to me as to everyone else here!

My guess is that the bug is in the test code rather than in the tuning code. I suspect that the threshold is allowed to be SIZE_MAX, but that the line

```
n = random_ulong (3 * ZNP_mpn_smp_kara_thresh) + 2; 
```
should be replaced by e.g.

```
if (ZNP_mpn_smp_kara_thresh == SIZE_MAX)
   n = random_ulong (100) + 2;
else
   n = random_ulong (3 * ZNP_mpn_smp_kara_thresh) + 2; 
```

It could also be a bug in the tuning code, but that would be much harder to fix. If I remember correctly what this threshold means, it is very surprising to me that its optimal value is SIZE_MAX on any real system.

power7 is a strange beast but it is unlikely that it is the optimal value. The tuning probably assume something that is wrong on this platform and that would indeed be difficult to find.
