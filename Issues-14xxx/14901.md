Initial implementation of Lie algebras in sage.

This will contain the following:

- Free Lie algebras
  * Hall basis
  * Lyndon basis
- Abelian Lie algebras
- Lie algebras from an associative algebra
- Lie algebras from structure coefficients
- Finite type Lie algebras
  - As matrices for types ABCD
  - In the Chevalley basis
- **gl**<sub>n</sub>
- Untwisted affine Lie algebras constructed from a finite type
- Untwisted affine Kac-Moody Lie algebras (i.e. the above and the Lie derivative)
- Universal enveloping algebras
  * PBW bases
- Quotient, sub, and direct sum Lie algebras and Lie algebra ideals
- Other examples:
  * Upper triangular matrices
  * Strictly upper triangular matrices
  * Heisenberg algebra
  * Witt algebra
  * Virasoro algebra
  * Some nilpotent Lie algebras
- Kac-Moody algebras based only on a (generalized) Cartan matrix
- Lie algebra (co)homology
- Chargeless and Verma modules for the Virasoro algebra
- Fock space
- **su**<sub>n</sub>

There might also be the following:

- recovery of Lie group from Lie algebra (#26344 for nilpotent Lie groups)
- connection between the quantum group and the Hall algebra (coming from representations of a quiver over F<sub>q</sub>)

With this, one will be able to do basic computations, as well as compute things such as the lower central series (depending on the type).

* #16820 - the categories and the basic framework and finite dimensional given by structure coefficients
* #17416, #26078 - subalgebras
* #16821 - classical Lie algebras
* #16822 - PBW basis for the universal enveloping algebra
* #16823 - the free Lie algebra (follow-up #25166)
* #16824 - quotients (#26079 for quotients of finite-dimensional Lie algebras) and finitely presented Lie algebras
* #16825 - untwisted affine Lie algebras
* #16826 - Kac-Moody algebras
* #22883 - Lie algebra (co)homology
* #23037 - Chargeless and Verma modules for the Virasoro algebra
* #22949 - Add method to construct a `FiniteDimensionalAlgebra` isomorphic to the Lie algebra
* #23517 - Verma modules
* #25013 - Add coercions between classical Lie algebras
* #16860 - Interface with Gap (not part of the current branch)
* #16861 - Interface with LiE (not part of the current branch)
* #26036 - Morphisms defined only on generators
* #28149 - Compact real forms (including **su**<sub>n</sub>)

At some point, when linear algebra works in combinatorial free modules, I'll want (and probably make) the Lie algebra of primitives of a Hopf algebra.

It does about 80% or so of the functionality I want, but it probably could use some restructuring. It's also missing a lot of documentation (most importantly doctests). Here's what's done and (mostly) working:

- Free Lie algebras in the Hall basis
- The Lyndon basis for the free Lie algebra
- Abelian Lie algebras
- Lie algebras from an associative algebra
- Lie algebras from structure coefficients
- Finite type Lie algebras
  - As matrices for types ABCD
  - In the Chevalley basis

- The Lie algebra of strictly upper triangular matrices

- Untwisted affine Lie algebras constructed from a finite type
- Untwisted affine Kac-Moody Lie algebras (i.e. the above and the Lie derivative) [done]
- Universal enveloping algebras
- Kac-Moody algebras based only on a (generalized) Cartan matrix
- LLT basis and Fock spaces for U<sub>q</sub>(**sl**<sub>n</sub>) [done]
- PBW(-type) bases of universal enveloping algebra (quantum group) [done for Lie algebras up to abstracting internal structure]
- canonical bases of quantum groups [90% done]
- the Heisenberg Lie algebras and some other misc examples
- quotient, sub, and direct sum Lie algebras and Lie algebra ideals [doesn't always seem to reduce properly]

Everything else:

- twisted affine Lie and Kac-Moody algebras via loop groups/diagram automorphims [I want to do this, but haven't started and might push to a later ticket]
- the Goodman and Wenzl modified LLT algorithm [haven't started yet]
- polynomial representations for **sl**<sub>n</sub> [doesn't give the correct results]
- implementation of quantum groups [65% done]
- connection between the quantum group and the Hall algebra (coming from representations of a quiver over F<sub>q</sub>) [I would need to understand Hall algebras better to do this]
- **su**<sub>n</sub> [possibly to be dropped as the Sage infrastructure does not seem to be there]
- recovery of Lie group from Lie algebra (where it makes sense) [0% done, likely to be dropped]

+Initial implementation of Lie algebras in sage.
 
+This will contain the following:
+
+- Free Lie algebras
+  * Hall basis
+  * Lyndon basis
+- Abelian Lie algebras
+- Lie algebras from an associative algebra
+- Lie algebras from structure coefficients
+- Finite type Lie algebras
+  - As matrices for types ABCD
+  - In the Chevalley basis
+- **gl**<sub>n</sub>
+- Untwisted affine Lie algebras constructed from a finite type
+- Untwisted affine Kac-Moody Lie algebras (i.e. the above and the Lie derivative)
+- Universal enveloping algebras
+  * PBW bases
+- Quotient, sub, and direct sum Lie algebras and Lie algebra ideals
+- Other examples:
+  * Upper triangular matrices
+  * Strictly upper triangular matrices
+  * Heisenberg algebra
+  * Witt algebra
+  * Virasoro algebra
+  * Some nilpotent Lie algebras
+- Kac-Moody algebras based only on a (generalized) Cartan matrix
+- Lie algebra (co)homology
+- Chargeless and Verma modules for the Virasoro algebra
+- Fock space
+- **su**<sub>n</sub>
+
+There might also be the following:
+
+- recovery of Lie group from Lie algebra (#26344 for nilpotent Lie groups)
+- connection between the quantum group and the Hall algebra (coming from representations of a quiver over F<sub>q</sub>)
+
+With this, one will be able to do basic computations, as well as compute things such as the lower central series (depending on the type).
