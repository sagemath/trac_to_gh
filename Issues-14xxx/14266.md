My patch creates a simple ascii-art module to manipule several structure: list,dict,tuple, linear expression:

```
sage: R = NonCommutativeSymmetricFunctions(QQ).R()
sage: R[1]**5

Whats the difference between `_repr_`, `_pretty_repr_normal_`, and `_pretty_repr_term_`? I think there should be only one `_repr_`, using ascii art unconditionally if printing the object benefits from it. Why would you want to turn it off? I don't see the need for a different display handler, we aleady have one that does handle ascii art.

Then thanks to the method

I didn't know but... after try...

I am a bit new on this discussion, but I want to add my contribution.

I think having `` _pretty_repr_`` as a plus for combinatorial objects is a good idea and useful. It is not the same as ``_repr_``. 

First, you don't want to change the repr of every combinatorial objects to have pretty prints, this will just break everything every where. (I am thinking of trees, Dyck paths, partitions...). Most objects already had a way being pretty printed, it was just not centralized and could not be used in linear combinations.

I actually think having the two ``_repr_`` and ``_pretty_repr_`` is useful. I have started to work with Jean-Baptiste's patch and depending on what I want to do with the output, I use both the pretty prints and usal prints.

I think there should be only one `_repr_`, using ascii art unconditionally if printing the object benefits from it. Why would you want to turn it off? I don't see the need for a different display handler, we aleady have one that does handle ascii art. 


There is definitely a need for a configurable display. In combinatorics
depending on the context we really need to be able to be able to print various
object in several different ways: The simplest example is
partitions. Sometimes you need to see:
   (3,3,2,1,1)
sometime you need

```
   ###
   ###
   ##
   #
   #
```
or if you are french

```
   #
   #
   ##
   ###
   ###
```
Another example is graphs. Currently we only have
   Graph on 6 vertices
Probably many user will rather have
   Graph on 6 vertices with 5 edges
Or to see the incidence matrix...

So I definitely see a need for configurable output.

Looks pretty nice! I'm fine with the functionality, but the documentation needs to be improved. Especially since you want to provide other developers a framework to enable ascii art output. 

Some of the names are awkward in English. Pretty console representation means that the console is pretty, not the repr(esentation). It would be nice (and it would make writing doctests easier) if we install a global function analogous to `repr()` to get the ascii art representation. I would suggest we call it `display()` and the magic `%display` (instead of `%pcp`, unless you want to use it as a pun on the hallucinogenic drug).

Similarly, I don't like `__pretty_repr__`. Its not a variant of `__repr__` with pretty output since it returns a specialized object instead of a string. Its also not a Python builtin, so Sage coding style would use only single underscores. How about we call it `_ascii_art_()`? Similarly, `set_display` instead of `set_pretty_repr`.

Also, since this should be a general framework we should add a default `_ascii_art_` method (with suitable documentation to benefit developers) to `SageObject`. For example (in `sage_object.pyx`):

```
    def _ascii_art_(self):
        '''
        Return an ASCII art representation.

        To implement multi-line ASCII art output in a derived class
        you must override this method. Unlike :meth:`_repr_`, which is
        sometimes used for the hash key, the output of
        :meth:`_ascii_art_` may depend on settings and is allowed to
        change during runtime. For example,
        :meth:`~sage.combinat.tableau.Tableaux.set_display` can be
        used to switch the ASCII art of tableaux between different
        mathematical conventions.

        OUTPUT:

        An :class:`~sage.misc.ascii_art.AsciiArt` object, see
        :mod:`sage.misc.ascii_art` for details.

        EXAMPLES:

        You can use the :func:`~sage.misc.ascii_art.display` function
        to get the ASCII art representation of any object in Sage::

            sage: display(integral(exp(x^2)/(x+1), x))
            ⌠         
            ⎮  ⎛ 2⎞   
            ⎮  ⎝x ⎠   
            ⎮ ℯ       
            ⎮ ───── dx
            ⎮ x + 1   
            ⌡

        Alternatively, you can use the `%display on/off` magic to
        switch all output to ASCII art and back::
        
            sage: tab = StandardTableaux(3)[2];  tab
            [[1, 2], [3]]
            sage: %display on
            sage: tab
            1  2
            3
            sage: Tableau.set_display("normal")
            sage: tab
            +---+
            | 3 |
            +---+---+
            | 1 | 2 |
            +---+---+
            sage: %display off

        TESTS::

            sage: 1._ascii_art_()
            1
            sage: type(_)
            sage.misc.ascii_art.AsciiArt
        '''
        from sage.misc.ascii_art import AsciiArt
        return AsciiArt(repr(self))
```

Finally, __every__ function must be documented and doctested. Please follow http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/conventions.html#docstring-markup-with-rest-and-sphinx for the markup. For example, we use an `OUTPUT:` block instead of ``@`postcondition`.

I played with `tex2mail` a bit and it was quite nice, although I never got to trying to include it into Sage.

New version with several tests for lot of methods... with `AsciiArt` inherit `SageObject `.
I purpose to use `%display ascii_art` and `display repr` to select one use.

I hope I don't forget anything.

Enjoy.

```

* Any block should be in all caps, such as `EXAMPLES::`
* I'd prefer using triple double-quotes rather than triple single-quotes for consistancy, but this is not a big issue

I added some test... but sometime when the method it just a capsule:

```
def meth(self):
    return self.other_meth()
```
or something similar, I just put `see :meth:other_meth`.

I think it's okay now.

I hope it's okay too.

I try to do that when it's not my files and I think (but I don't verify) it is consistant in mine.

In the last patch I put that and this one must work on 5.9.

I don't like your approach for changing the output, you are monkey-patching sage.misc.displayhook to change its behavior from another module. Thats usually a no-no in production code (unless you cannot control the source that you are patching, which is not the case here). The problem is that if anybody is going to edit sage.misc.displayhook later on, they will inadvertently break your construction since noting in the source code of the displayhook knowns that this is not the actual code that is used when Sage is running. The standard solution to associating state with a function is to use a functionoid, that is, a class with a `__call__` method:

```
class FormatObj():
    def __init__(self):
        self._display = False

    def set_ascii_art(self, ascii_art):
        self._display = bool(ascii_art)

    def __call__(self, obj):
        if self._display:
             ...
        else:
             ....

format_obj = FormatObj()
```
As a bonus, your code then wouldn't need layers of indirection `format_obj` -> `pretty_format` -> `simple_format_obj`.

The need doc*tests* not just docstings (there are still non-trivial methods without tests). However if they are simple wrappers like that, just make it an alias:

```
other_meth = meth
```

This is not done in other files you've modified (ex. `tableau.py`), and again, to be consistent with the project as whole, I would recommended using double quotes. However in new files you've created, this is a very minor issue to me (i.e. I won't let it hold up a positive review).

Thanks,

I make some modifications to use correctly displayhook.

I have several problems for make tests: I use the fact to be in a terminal to take the width of the window... excepted in test context it seems to be differents...

```
File "ascii_art.py", line 25, in sage.misc.ascii_art
Failed example:
    ascii_art(integrate(n^2/(pi*x),x))
Expected:
     2       
    n *log(x)
    ---------
        pi   
Got:
    stty: stdin isn't a terminal
     2       
    n *log(x)
    ---------
        pi 
```

There is an other points, if we use utf8 in the terminal, it is not utf8 during the tests...

Why don't pass sage to utf8?

Thanks,
Jean-Baptiste

The doctesting should be mostly utf-8 clean, I think. See also #14153. What exactly is the problem?

The stty: stdin isn't a terminal comes because the controlling terminal isn't a terminal for doctests. You should set a fixed width (probably 80) independent of the actual terminal size during doctests, something like this:

```
def terminal_width():
    import os, sys
    from sage.doctest import DOCTEST_MODE
    isatty = os.isatty(sys.stdout.fileno())
    if DOCTEST_MODE or not isatty:
        return 80
    import fcntl, termios, struct
    rc = fcntl.ioctl(int(0), termios.TIOCGWINSZ,
                     struct.pack('HHHH', sys.stdout.fileno(), 0, 0, 0))
    h, w, hp, wp = struct.unpack('HHHH', rc)
    return w
```

The "pcp" abbreviation is still floating around in a few places, can you replace those?

Hi,

I'm really bad with mercurial but it seems to be good...

- Tests works,
- normally, all methods and functions pass test

I made that module for see quickly trees in terminal so I added `_ascii_art` methods for trees. (depends of #8703).

And all "pcp" abbreviation are disappear.

Thanks,

Jean-Baptiste

Looks great! I just have some minor nitpicks:

* The `revenir dessus` is still there
* There is a big chunk of commented-out code in `misc/sage_extension.py`, you probably want to delete that, too.
* Catch-all `except:` statements are not allowed in Sage (the user might have pressed Ctrl-C and a KeyboardException was raised). Jeroen's merger script will check for that...

Apart from that it is good to go.
