Or did someone already implement them?

Here's my code. Its weakest point is probably the input; instead of an actual pair of a poset and a map from its elements to {1,2,3,...}, it takes a pair of a poset and a linear order on it represented as a tuple of its elements. (See docstring for details. By the way, I'm hoping the LaTeX does work... no idea how to check that.)

I've uploaded a small review patch which does some additional tweaks to the documentation and removes the print statements. I'm also getting the same error, and even adding this method above it:

```
def test(self, R):

the error gets pushed into this method. I'm thinking we should post something to sage-devel about this (since the error cannot be reproduced in sage), and as a possible solution, just copy the output of the doctest with a comment about it basically saying we have no idea what is happening.

Have you asked the question on sage-devel ?

You have introduced a typo "parition" in your review patch.

Without the patches, there does appear to be deprecations associated with the `QuasiSymmetricFunctions` class that points to

```
DeprecationWarning: object.__init__() takes no parameters
```
A Traceback of the warning may be obtained by converting warnings to errors, i.e.

```
sage: import warnings
sage: warnings.simplefilter('error', DeprecationWarning)
sage: QuasiSymmetricFunctions(QQ)
```
which is fairly lengthy. It is curious that the patches now *expose* the warning. FWIW, the `SymmetricFunctions` class doesn't exhibit the warning:

```
sage: import warnings                                   
sage: warnings.simplefilter('error', DeprecationWarning)
sage: SymmetricFunctions(QQ)                            
Symmetric Functions over Rational Field
```

Where/how did you see this? In particular, was this placed in another doctest somewhere?

It seems like the `BoundClass` (of `Monomial`) is calling up to the base `object` and at this point I don't understand why.

uses a class BoundClass that inherit from functools.partial. And there seems to be an issue there:

```
    sage: import warnings
    sage: warnings.simplefilter('error', DeprecationWarning)
    sage: import functools
    sage: def f(x): return x
    sage: g = functools.partial(f,1)
    sage: g()
    1
    sage: class mypartial(functools.partial):
    ....:     def __init__(self, f, i):
    ....:         functools.partial.__init__(self, f,i)
    sage: g = mypartial(f,1)
    Traceback (most recent call last)
    ...
    ----> 3                 functools.partial.__init__(self, f,i)
    DeprecationWarning: object.__init__() takes no parameters
    sage: g()
    1
```

I had never noticed this. Please explore what's the best workaround!

This is somewhat non-intuitive but the following seems to work

```
sage: import warnings
sage: warnings.simplefilter('error', DeprecationWarning)
sage: import functools
sage: def f(x, y): return x^y
sage: g = functools.partial(f, 2, 3)
sage: g()
8
sage: class mypartial(functools.partial):
....:     def __init__(self, f, i, j):
....:         functools.partial.__init__(self)
....:         
sage: g = mypartial(f, 2, 3)
sage: g()
8
```
or

```
sage: class mynewpartial(functools.partial):
....:     def __init__(self, f, i, j):
....:         super(mynewpartial, self).__init__()
....:         
sage: g = mynewpartial(f, 2, 3)
sage: g()
8
```
This perhaps suggests the `__init__` method of the `BoundClass` should be

```
    def __init__(self, *args):
        super(BoundClass, self).__init__()
        self.__doc__ = self.func.__doc__
```
instead of

```
        super(BoundClass, self).__init__(*args)
```
I don't know whether this breaks anything?
