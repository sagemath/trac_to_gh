Or did someone already implement them?

Here's my code. Its weakest point is probably the input; instead of an actual pair of a poset and a map from its elements to {1,2,3,...}, it takes a pair of a poset and a linear order on it represented as a tuple of its elements. (See docstring for details. By the way, I'm hoping the LaTeX does work... no idea how to check that.)

I've uploaded a small review patch which does some additional tweaks to the documentation and removes the print statements. I'm also getting the same error, and even adding this method above it:

```
def test(self, R):
    """
    EXAMPLES::

        sage: P = Poset([[],[]])
        sage: P.test(QQ)
    """
    from sage.combinat.ncsf_qsym.qsym import QuasiSymmetricFunctions
    return QuasiSymmetricFunctions(R)
```
the error gets pushed into this method. I'm thinking we should post something to sage-devel about this (since the error cannot be reproduced in sage), and as a possible solution, just copy the output of the doctest with a comment about it basically saying we have no idea what is happening.

Best,

Travis

Where/how did you see this? In particular, was this placed in another doctest somewhere?

It seems like the `BoundClass` (of `Monomial`) is calling up to the base `object` and at this point I don't understand why.

This perhaps suggests the `__init__` method of the `BoundClass` should be

```

instead of

I don't know whether this breaks anything?
