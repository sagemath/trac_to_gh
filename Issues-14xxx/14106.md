```
sage: R = Zp(5,7)
sage: a = R(300)
sage: a
2*5^2 + 2*5^3 + O(5^9)
sage: a[:5]
4*5^2 + O(5^5)
```

This results from the following:

```
sage: a.slice(None, 5, 1) # correct
2*5^2 + 2*5^3 + O(5^5)
sage: a.slice(None, 5, None) # incorrect
4*5^2 + O(5^5)
```

This is also done in #13299. (Which I should probably set to needs_review again). Should I make #13299 depend on #14106 or should we rather get #13299 into sage?
