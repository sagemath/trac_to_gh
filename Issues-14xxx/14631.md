Thank youuuuuuUUUUUUUUUuuuuuu Brouwer !!! `:-P`

Nathann

P.S. : This patch "does not really" depend on #14589, but here is what happens when calling "is_strongly_regular" on a big graph. With the patch :

```
sage: g
Affine Polar Graph VO^+(10,2): Graph on 1024 vertices
sage: %time g.is_strongly_regular(parameters = True)
CPU times: user 3.30 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 3.30 s
Wall time: 3.31 s
(1024, 527, 270, 272)
```

Without the patch

```
sage: %time g.is_strongly_regular(parameters = True)
CPU times: user 316.33 s, sys: 0.08 s, total: 316.41 s
Wall time: 317.20 s
(1024, 527, 270, 272)
```

Annnnnd the doctests that this patch adds are a bit faster as a result `:-P`

I sent you a link to a text about them, didn't I? Here is another link:

I have about 10 other things I must work on now (if not last month or year :)), and organization of this:
http://web.spms.ntu.edu.sg/~dima/IMS2013/
And I don't even have a fixed job, as you know, so you don't feel the pressure I do feel from this side...

That's what happens when a patch stays in "needs_review" for one year.

I will add a commit in a second `:-P`
