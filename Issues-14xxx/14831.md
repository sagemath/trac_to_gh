In the doc of the method `.is_similar()` (located in in `sage/sage/matrix/matrix2.pyx`), we get this unreadable block:

```
      sage: A = matrix(QQ, [[ 19, -7, -29], ...
      [-16, 11,  30], ...                   [ 15, -7, -25]]) sage: B =
      matrix(QQ, [[-38, -63,  42], ...                   [ 14,  25,
      -14], ...                   [-14, -21,  18]]) sage: A.charpoly()
      == B.charpoly() True sage: A.jordan_form() [-3| 0  0] [--+-----]
      [ 0| 4  1] [ 0| 0  4] sage: B.jordan_form() [-3| 0| 0]
      [--+--+--] [ 0| 4| 0] [--+--+--] [ 0| 0| 4] sage:
      A.is_similar(B) False
```

This is due to a missing `::`.
