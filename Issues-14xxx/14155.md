One thing that whoever reviews this should check is whether there are any resulting time regressions.  I'm still slightly embarrassed that I didn't notice that my SR gcd patch slowed things down dramatically, because it didn't affect the overall runtime and it didn't really occur to me that Sage performance could depend so critically upon certain gcd calls failing quickly.

I *think* that improving the behaviour in this case shouldn't have any time effects, because it's a lot less fundamental than messing with SR, but if there's one thing I've learned it's that my intuitions about Sage performance are worth about what I paid for them.

I think that these changes are okay:

```
File "/mnt/storage2TB/patchbot/Sage/sage-5.7.rc0/devel/sage-14155/sage/symbolic/expression.pyx", line 2804:
    sage: (Mod(2,7)*x^2 + Mod(2,7))^7
Expected:
    128*(x^2 + 1)^7
Got:
    (2*x^2 + 2)^7
**********************************************************************
File "/mnt/storage2TB/patchbot/Sage/sage-5.7.rc0/devel/sage-14155/sage/symbolic/expression.pyx", line 2809:
    sage: t = Mod(2,7); gcd(t, t)^7
Expected:
    128
Got:
    1
**********************************************************************
File "/mnt/storage2TB/patchbot/Sage/sage-5.7.rc0/devel/sage-14155/sage/symbolic/expression.pyx", line 2811:
    sage: gcd(t,t).parent()
Expected:
    Integer Ring
Got:
    Ring of integers modulo 7
```

It would be a bit nicer to get `2*(x^2 + 1)^7` in the first case, but I think that would require a change to GiNaC.

Changed some of the wording in the documentation of ``self.gcd()``:

```
This returns the "smallest" representative generating the same 
ideal as this one in `\ZZ / N\ZZ`.
```
becomes

```
Returns the "smallest" generator in `\ZZ / N\ZZ` of the ideal
generated by ``self`` and ``other``.
```
and for clarity the line in the doctest

```
sage: mod(72*5, 3^3*2^2*17^8).gcd(mod(48*17, 3^3*2^2*17^8))
```
to

```
sage: mod(2^3*3^2*5, 3^3*2^2*17^8).gcd(mod(2^4*3*17, 3^3*2^2*17^8))
```
I also made the analogous changes in the other 2 versions of ``self.gcd()``.

Otherwise fine.
