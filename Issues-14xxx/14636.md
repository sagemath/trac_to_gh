My debian/sage experiments have uncovered that sage's ecl package was compiled with a few tweaks:

(1) it is compiled with unicode disabled ; this is to avoid errors, like those which can be read about in [this gentoo report](https://github.com/cschwan/sage-on-gentoo/issues/2). But that doesn't look like a real solution!

(2) SIGCHLD is disabled by directly patching the sources (`patches/disable_sigchdl_handler.patch`)

(3) threading is disabled ; I'll open another ticket for that, so let's that aside for now (and for this ticket)

To fix this ticket:
(1) use [this ecl spkg](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jpuydt/ECL_Maxima/ecl-12.12.1.p5.spkg) ([spkg diff](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket14636/ecl_p4_to_p5.patch)) ;
(2) apply [and [attachment:trac_14636_2.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket14636/c191fd9a1030db3036f189e7f3c75015.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket14636/2bfb5fd9a17de16ff0ca08dd527c686a.patch)) to sagelib (in that order).

This fix is against sage 5.12.beta4.

A ticket isn't just about something which will happen just now ; it's a central place where ideas get gathered about an issue. In this case, a ticket listing what is holding back sage for the switch to python3 would probably be worthy.

Ah, indeed! You should just add that in `ecl.pxd` and do

```
    ecl_set_option(ECL_OPT_TRAP_SIGCHLD, 0)
```
before the boot call. Looked like Volker went for the quick-and-dirty solution there on #14055.

Note that even with that option, ECL still does install a SIGCHLD handler. However, we're not putting that back when we call ECL. Does SIGCHLD also need special treatment in `eclsig.c`? Jeroen is the expert on that file.

Please add the following doctest (`sage/tests/interrupt.pyx` is a good place for this test):

```
"""
Show that `SIGCHLD` is completely ignored by default. If the process
`p` finishes, there should be no `SIGCHLD` signal, so ``select()`` will
simply time out::

    sage: from select import select
    sage: import subprocess

    sage: p = subprocess.Popen(["sleep", "1"])  # long time
    sage: select([], [], [], 1.5)               # long time
    ([], [], [])
    sage: p.poll()                              # long time
    0

We now do the same but after installing a dummy `SIGCHLD`
handler::

    sage: import signal
    sage: def dummy_handler(a,b):
    ....:    pass
    sage: signal.signal(signal.SIGCHLD, dummy_handler)  # random
    sage: p = subprocess.Popen(["sleep", "1"])  # long time
    sage: select([], [], [], 1.5)               # long time
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    error: (4, 'Interrupted system call')
    sage: p.poll()                              # long time
    0

Reset the `SIGCHLD` handler::

    sage: signal.signal(signal.SIGCHLD, signal.SIG_IGN)  # random

You have to dig deeper (on trac and sage-devel); there have been related tickets and threads years ago, as the Python devs keep claiming *"There will be no further 2.x release after ..."*, and they do so since at least 2.4 IIRC.

(AFAIK the tickets mainly addressed removing [future] incompatibilities to Python 3.x from the Sage library, but also mention which upstream packages don't or won't [ever :-) ] work with Python 3.x, to that time of course.)

W.r.t. "holding back":  There's *no need* to switch to Python 3.x ... ;-)

What needs reviewing here is what is point (2) in the description : the move of the SIGCHLD code from a dirty patch within the ECL spkg to a correct ECL-library call in the sage library.

+(2) SIGCHLD is disabled by directly patching the sources (`patches/disable_sigchdl_handler.patch`)
 
-**TO REVIEW**
-* compile ecl-12.12.1.p4.spkg
-* apply trac_14636_sigchld.patch to the sage library
-* recompile the sage library
-* run the long tests
-* confirm it's ok
-**AFTER APPLYING**
-* remove those two paragraphs
-* add a nice **DONE** to the (1) point above
-* put the ticket as new again, as there is still point (2) to clear before actually closing
+(3) threading is disabled ; I tried to remove this restriction, and it only made a single doctest fail ; a zero was expected and a 139 was obtained:

It's great if you can get that to work.

I considered enabling threading in ECL as fundamentally incompatible with the way we use it in Sage. It will cause ECL to split off a dedicated thread to handle asynchronous events and it will cause Boehm to repurpose some exotic signals to synchronize thread on garbage collection, and those signals will confuse the sage signal handler if it happens to receive them.

We are switching signal handlers upon entry/exit of ECL. With multiple threads it is not clear anymore whether sage or ECL should be in control of asynch signals at any one time.

We won't get much benefit from the change either: our main use, Maxima, uses global data structures everywhere and wasn't built with multi-processing in mind at all. It will not be able to utilize multiple threads for a long time.

I am not sure that's correct. I'll have to check. From the git clone I have Juan hadn't committed asdf 3.0.1 yet. However I think it was not many commits away from 3.0.

One of the main point is that ecl use to have the asdf-bundle extension (né asdf-ecl as they say) and that extension has been merged in asdf (2.66?) and underwent some changes in the process.

We have a formula to build a maxima.fas with the new ecl but it leads to segfault when we load it (from sage or even from ecl itself).

In Gentoo the lisp team has decided to move things to asdf 3.0.1 as fast as they can, but the harm for maxima_lib has been somewhat before 3.0.1.
See [https://github.com/cschwan/sage-on-gentoo/issues/226](https://github.com/cschwan/sage-on-gentoo/issues/226) for our status.

This is our current formula to build maxima.fas

```
		cd src
		ecl \
			-eval '(require `asdf)' \
			-eval '(push "./" asdf:*central-registry*)' \
			-eval "(asdf:initialize-output-translations \
				'(:output-translations :disable-cache :inherit-configuration))" \
			-eval '(load "maxima-build.lisp")' \
			-eval '(asdf:make-build :maxima :type :fasl)' \
			-eval '(quit)'
		ECLLIB=`ecl -eval "(princ (SI:GET-LIBRARY-PATHNAME))" -eval "(quit)"`
		insinto "${ECLLIB#${EPREFIX}}"
		newins maxima.fasb maxima.fas

Thanks for the encouragement Nils. It is not impossible that we have in fact uncovered some kind of bug.  If Martin is right we go through an initialisation twice and the second time we fall into an infinite loop.

I finally found the time to have look ; the spkg-src script fails with "mv: cannot stat `gmp': No such file or directory"... this is with upstream's 12.12.1 tarball.

Now that I am starting to remember stuff, removing the "dirty workaround" discussed in this ticket will break one doctest at least. But then I haven't tested your patches either.

I have problems getting enough time to work on sage these days and it will probably become worse until September. I cannot give you expectation that I will make the two spkgs in question in a timely fashion.
