This ticket changes SageNB from a distribution to a normal Python package. This means unbundling everything which used to be part of the SageNB distribution.

The package `webassets` is simply removed, since it doesn't seem to be used by anything in Sage or SageNB. [This thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/sage-devel/fEeGgVWuk7I/nDOHbclqLUAJ) indicates that `webassets` is used by the `newui` branch of SageNB but not in vanilla SageNB. So it has no reason being in Sage currently.

Reasonably I will not be able to recompile again before the end of the weekend either but I will gladly take care of this on Monday if nobody beats me to it.

Is there actually a place where the "official" sagenb tarballs are hosted? If not, then we can just define my tarball as the official one.

My impression was that, whenever you made a new SageNB release, you just host it somewhere on a personal website. So then I don't see why my sagenb-0.12 on this ticket would be less official than your previous sagenb releases.

But please tell me if I'm wrong...

IMHO sagenb should not drag all of its dependencies into sage. Why can't the installation script simply run 
`sage --pip`?

perhaps it's time for it to change; after all we tell users to install ssl support via pip, creating a lot of pain and confusion along the way, as we don't package the corresponding script thanks to exactly this prohibition. If we changed this policy we would only improve the nb-related procedures here.

Inconsistent access is a nightmare if you need to get a large file (e.g. current Sage source tarball), as opposed to several small files.

Besides, mind you, much more popular than Sage software distribution systems, e.g. ones for Python, Haskell, OCaml do require internet access, by default. Convenience for the majority (and for developers) ought to come before exotic usage cases.

If/when we make sagenb into an optional or experimental package, I have no objections to doing the same with these dependencies. But until then, in what way is including a dozen packages an inconvenience? It doesn't take up any extra disk space or extra time building Sage since we're already including them, it just adds a few directories in `build/pkgs`.

And how are Sage developers supposed to know about this, if they are going to be traveling and without good internet access for a while? It sounds like a good idea, but I still don't see what it saves vs. making these standard Sage packages (for as long as sagenb is a standard Sage package, but no longer).
