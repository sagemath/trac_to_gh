This bug was discovered by RÃ©mi Maurice and I did double check this bad behavior on my own machine...

When using the Sage notebook. here is the way to reproduce the bug:

1 - Produce a too long output in a cell 
example:

```
print "Version 1"
for i in range(1000):
    print "too long output"
```

2 - Visualize the full_output

3 - Erase the content of the cell (if you want...), restart the worksheet (if you want...)

4 - produce another code in the *SAME* cell that have a too long output
example:

```
print "Version 2"
for i in range(1000):
    print "foo bar pouet"
```

5 - Click to visualize the full_output

At the end, you will only see the first too long output, any new too long computation in the same cell is ignored...

Sorry for my English, feel free to update the description and double check this bug (the two machine were using Sage 5.9).

I've thought of this as a "known problem" with the notebook for a long time and I hated that it was something that seems like it wouldn't be fixed soon.  I just found that by reloading the page (e.g. command-R on Mac in Firefox, Chrome and Safari) that the full_output.txt is updated to the current version.  This isn't ideal since sometimes you re-use a cell and you don't notice that the output isn't what you want it to be.

I found a hack however that might solve the problem.

Right now the text

```
WARNING: Output truncated!  
full_output.txt
```

Links to an address like `http://localhost:8080/home/admin/187/cells/114/full_output.txt`.  If instead it links to an address like `http://localhost:8080/home/admin/187/cells/114/full_output.txt?blah` where blah is a random bit of text that is generated whenever the cell is recalculated then the browser generally reloads the page correctly.

Incidentally, this same bug is reported in #13648 and #13585

Alternately, jdemeyer has the following suggestion, from #13585:

Or perhaps even both could be done.
