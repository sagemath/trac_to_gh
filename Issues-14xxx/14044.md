At [this ask.sagemath.org question](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/417/exact-syntax-for-bdist), mhansen does a nice job clarifying the Mac app env variables for making a binary.

Problem: these are apparently nowhere in the developer guide or other guide.  They're not even in the Mac app readme!

So we should put this somewhere, and at least where bdisting is mentioned (assuming it is, which is not clear to me at all).
