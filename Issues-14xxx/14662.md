It seems that the following doesn't work:

1. build `ecl`
2. move Sage tree
3. build `maxima`

This can be fixed by simply adding a symbolic link local/lib/ecl/ecl -> local/include/ecl such that ECL finds its ecl/config.h.

All I can say is that my fix solves the problem for me... but I admit I cannot really explain why ECL would look for its `config.h` file inside `$SAGE_LOCAL/lib/ecl/ecl`.
