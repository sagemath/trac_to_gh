It seems that the following doesn't work:

1. build `ecl`
2. move Sage tree
3. build `maxima`

This can be fixed by simply adding a symbolic link local/lib/ecl/ecl -> local/include/ecl such that ECL finds its ecl/config.h.

**Assignee:** @jdemeyer

**Reviewer:** Volker Braun

**Author:** Jeroen Demeyer

**Merged:** sage-5.10.rc1

**Resolution:** fixed
