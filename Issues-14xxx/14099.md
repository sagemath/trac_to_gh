Well... It is sligthly smarter than what you do (it would not enumerate all chains of length 'n' beginning with an element v, if this element v is comparable with an element of the chain of length 'm' you already picked) and it is implemented in Cython.

I'd say that it's definitely worth a try.

I don't think subgraph_search answers the same question....

Using induced=True results in the poset Poset({0 : [], 1 : [2], 2 : [3]}) which is 3+1 being (3+1)-free:

```
# g is the transitive closure
sage: g = DiGraph({0 : [], 1 : [2, 3], 2 : [3]})
sage: g.subgraph_search(DiGraph({0 : [1], 1 : [2]}) + DiGraph({0 : []}), induced=True)
```

Using induced=False results in the poset Poset({0 : [1, 2], 2 : [3]}) which is (3+1)-free containing (3+1):

```
# g is the transitive closure
sage: g = DiGraph({0 : [1, 2, 3], 2 : [3]})
sage: g.subgraph_search(DiGraph({0 : [1], 1 : [2]}) + DiGraph({0 : []}), induced=False)
Subgraph of (): Digraph on 4 vertices
```

you definitely need to use `induced = True`, but not on the digraphs. As I said you need to work on their transitive closure :

```
def test(g,n,m):
    n = 3
    m = 1
    pattern = digraphs.Circuit(n+1); pattern.delete_vertex(n)
    pattern += digraphs.Circuit(m+1); pattern.delete_vertex(n+m-1)
    c = g.transitive_closure().subgraph_search(pattern.transitive_closure(), induced = True)
    if c:
      print "Pattern found with chains", c.connected_components()
    else:
      print "No pattern in this graph"

g = DiGraph({0 : [], 1 : [2, 3], 2 : [3]})
test(g,3,1)
```

I just created ticket #14122 because of this ticket.

With that ticket, the following code 

```
mchain = digraphs.Circuit(m+1)
mchain.delete_vertex(m)
nchain = digraphs.Circuit(n+1)
nchain.delete_vertex(n)
return g.transitive_closure().subgraph_search((mchain + nchain).transitive_closure(), induced = True) is None
```
can be replaced by 

```
twochains = digraphs.Tournament(n) + digraphs.Tournament(m)
return g.transitive_closure().subgraph_search(twochains, induced = True) is None
```

As #14122 just got reviewed, could you rebase your patch on top of it and use the Tournament cnstructor ? `:-)`

By the way, could your merge your two functions into only one ? It would accept a list as a parameter and run the "real code" if the list has length one, and call itself on each pair of the list when it has a larger length.

One advantage is that you only have to write documentation and doctests for only one function instead of two, and documentation and doctests are actually the largest part of this patch. Then 50% of the actual code is only there to deal with the input and not actual computations. If you want to improve clarity, you can also dramatically decrease the tests you do at the beginning. Something like that :

```
def i_take_lists_of_pairs_or_just_a_pair_as_input(u,v=None):
    if v is None:
        return all(i_take_lists_of_pairs_or_just_a_pair_as_input(*x) for x in u)
    u,v = Integer(u), Integer(v)
    if u<0 or v<0:
        raise ValueError("Both elements of a pair must be positive integers") 
    # No I can do some actual computations
    print u,v
    return True
```

But honestly I think that only one method (taking a pair as input) should exist in Sage. To me the rest is "personal code".

Here is a patch that rewrites the reference to Stanley's book as we usually do in Sphinx, and as it is done in ``Graph.average_distance??`` and other functions.

I don't know why you set the ticket to `positive_review` twice even though the guy who was doing the review (=me) never said that he agreed with it. I don't get why Chris set it to positive review while there was a comment which had not been fixed either. Anyway, I think that this small [attachment:trac_14099-rev.patch] patch has to be added to this ticket too, unless you can explain why you prefer it to be left out.

I set the ticket to positive review, once, after I asked if there was anything else and you said "Okayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy I see ......" which I took to mean that everything was okay.

Chris set it to positive review after I addressed your latest comment, which was not specific at all.  I improved the typesetting of the variables.  Apparently this was not what you had in mind, but you hadn't said that.

You need to be more clear in your communication with people who are learning how to contribute.  At this point I am tired of making point modifications every time you think something should be changed, so please just finish the patch up yourself as you want it.
