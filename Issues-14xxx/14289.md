`sage -t --debug`, a new doctesting feature introduced by #12415, doesn't work for me on OS X 10.6.8 (it starts the tests but then just hangs). Strangely, the tests in `sage.doctest.forker.SageDocTestRunner.report_unexpected_exception` seem to succeed.

Can anyone else duplicate this problem on another platform? 

Depends on #12415

I think that

```
:trac:`14249`
```
should be used in and only in docstrings.

So I propose to leave the comment (unless you prefer `Trac #14289` to the full URL).
