The flint spkg fails in the patch phase on FreeBSD, because the patch file for `longlong.h` uses `//` as a path separator instead of `/`. This is very easy to fix.

Yes.  At the very least, we should split off the (hopefully) vanilla `src/` tree from Sage's part.

(Even worse, Jeroen's merger script currently keeps modifying some "unchanged", already released spkgs from beta to beta.  The differences are subtle changes in the metadata due to needless repackaging, but of course mtimes and md5sums differ afterwards.  But you have to download and unpack them to check/see this...)

Spkg looks ok, except that the changelog entry (and the commit message) should contain the ticket number (`#14241`).

I'd also use (bzip2) compression, although it'll (currently) get repackaged upon merging, as mentioned above.

FWIW, as the filenames do not *start* with `//`, I think FreeBSD's `patch` is broken here, but never mind.

Yeah, I agree. This is the first time I use bsd, too, and I'm having a hard time adjusting in general. I guess portability is good, though.
