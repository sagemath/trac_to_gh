The flint spkg fails in the patch phase on FreeBSD, because the patch file for `longlong.h` uses `//` as a path separator instead of `/`. This is very easy to fix.

(Even worse, Jeroen's merger script currently keeps modifying some "unchanged", already released spkgs from beta to beta.

Spkg looks ok, except that the changelog entry (and the commit message) should contain the ticket number (`#14241`).

I'd also use (bzip2) compression, although it'll (currently) get repackaged upon merging, as mentioned above.

Ok.

FWIW, as the filenames do not *start* with `//`, I think FreeBSD's `patch` is broken here, but never mind.
