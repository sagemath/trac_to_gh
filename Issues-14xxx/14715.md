If older versions of Sage try to upgrade to Sage 6.0, this should break gracefully. There should be a nice message explaining that it cannot be done, perhaps pointing to [http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/release/sage-5.13/](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/release/sage-5.13/) where the upgrade to Sage 5.13 can be done.
