The displayhook pretty-prints lists/tuples of matrices in a readable way:

```
sage: m = random_matrix(GF(5),2)                                      
sage: [ m, m^2, m^3 ]  
[
[1 4]  [4 2]  [3 0]
[2 2], [1 2], [0 3]
]
```
But this is hardcoded to only apply to matrix types:

```
sage: MatrixGroup([m,m^2,m^3]).gens()
[[1 4]
[2 2], [4 2]
[1 2], [3 0]
[0 3]]
```
This ticket aims to add a `_repr_option(key)` method to **parents** to be able to return meta-information on the `_repr_()` output. In particular, `_repr_option('element_ascii_art')` will return a boolean that switches between the list display hooks.

I've also change the displayhook to switch to the list pretty printing if *any* entry is an ascii-art element, not just the first one. This upsets a handful of doctests, but is still quite low impact.

I've also folded the `is_atomic_repr()` methods that some parents carried into this framework. Here is the method docstring for reference:

```
    def _repr_option(self, key):
        """
        Metadata about the :meth:`_repr_` output.

        INPUT:
        
        - ``key`` -- string. A key for different metadata informations
          that can be inquired about.

        Valid ``key`` arguments are:
        
        - ``'ascii_art'``: The :meth:`_repr_` output is multi-line
          ascii art and each line must be printed starting at the same
          column, or the meaning is lost.

        - ``'element_ascii_art'``: same but for the output of the
          elements. Used in :mod:`sage.misc.displayhook`.

        - ``'element_is_atomic'``: the elements print atomically, that
          is, parenthesis are not required when *printing* out any of
          `x - y`, `x + y`, `x^y` and `x/y`.

        OUTPUT:
        
        Boolean.

        EXAMPLES::

            sage: ZZ._repr_option('ascii_art')
            False
            sage: MatrixSpace(ZZ, 2)._repr_option('element_ascii_art')
            True
        """

Hey Volker,

I have a few questions/comments:

- Just to make sure, these are options that belong to individual `Parent` subclasses, not a global setting, correct?

- There's some strange formatting of commas, for example on line 71 of `quadratic_form__local_field_invariants.py`:

```
( 
Quadratic form in 4 variables over Rational Field with coefficients:  
[ 1 0 0 0 ]                                                          #
[ * 3 0 0 ]                                                          #
[ * * 5 0 ]                                                          #
[ * * * 7 ]                                                          ,
<BLANKLINE>
[1 0 0 0]
[0 0 0 1]
) 
```
  I've put the pounds `#` to signify where the whitespace ends.

- Could you put the None in code formatting: <code>``None``</code> on line 129 in `displayhook.py`.

It currently looks good to me otherwise.

Thank you,

Travis

    "body": "<a id='comment:13'></a>\nThe `_repr_option()` is meant for a particular parent, though its not a good idea to change it during the parent's lifetime (parents must be immutable). So in this sense its global, too.\n\nThe strange formatting for commas is because the displayhook treats ascii art as a square block. In this case, the width is set by \"Quadratic form in 4 variables over Rational Field with coefficients:\" and the comma is placed at the bottom right corner. It would probably be nicer if the displayhook would place the comma after the last non-whitespace character in the bottom row, but thats not the aim of this ticket.",

The `_repr_option()` is meant for a particular parent, though its not a good idea to change it during the parent's lifetime (parents must be immutable). So in this sense its global, too.

The strange formatting for commas is because the displayhook treats ascii art as a square block. In this case, the width is set by "Quadratic form in 4 variables over Rational Field with coefficients:" and the comma is placed at the bottom right corner. It would probably be nicer if the displayhook would place the comma after the last non-whitespace character in the bottom row, but thats not the aim of this ticket.

Okay.

One last thing I noticed in the housekeeping on line 273:

```
.. TODO:: 

Eventually, category should be Sets() by default
```
I would like to see this as

```
.. TODO:: 

    Eventually, category should be :class:`Sets` by default.
```
In particular, this should be indented. Once this is done, then I'll set this to positive review.

Thank you,

Travis
