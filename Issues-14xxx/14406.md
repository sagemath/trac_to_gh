* Allow Sage to build on Cygwin without setting `SAGE_PORT`.
* Don't check for `sqrtl()` which is apparently not needed (Cygwin doesn't have it, yet Sage builds).
* Remove all checks for the deprecated variable `SAGE_FORTRAN_LIB`.
* Remove `AC_ARG_VAR(SAGE_FORTRAN)` which is a deprecated variable.
* Check for `tar` before actually untarring the prereq tarball (originally #14407), only do these checks if `SAGE_PORT` is unset.

<a id='comment:6'></a>In the prereq install script, the Solaris part could be a little bit polished.
The first sentence includes a disturbing also:

```
You MUST also use the GNU version of tar...
```
whereas nothing precedes it.

I don't really like the fact that both tar and make are tested together in the constructions

```
if [ -f "/usr/sfw/bin/gtar" ]  && [ -f "/usr/sfw/bin/gmake" ] ; then
```
The only advantage of doing this is to easily suggest to do 

```
   echo "$ mkdir \$HOME/bins-for-sage" 
   echo "$ cp /usr/sfw/bin/gmake \$HOME/bins-for-sage/make" 
   echo "$ cp /usr/sfw/bin/gtar \$HOME/bins-for-sage/tar" 
   echo "$ export PATH=\$HOME/bins-for-sage:\$PATH" 
```
I think we'd better split the two tests, i.e. only check for tar in the tar part and for make in the make part.
At worst, a naive user will have to run make twice before it passes the prereq checks and will have twice $HAME\bins-for-sage in its PATH.

There are also ugly double spaces before "&&" on the (new) lines 132 and 165 :)

<a id='comment:7'></a>We could also include the Solaris parts together with the HP-UX and other strange Unix oses as elif clauses a little down below.

That may look nicer and prevent running "tar --version" twice.

If so, the commented out comments will need just a little rewriting and relocation.

We don't build Cephes on Cygwin.
On Cygwin, the only *l functions actually needed anywhere in Sage and which caused troubles (and that Cygwin libm does not provide, not sure what it actually provides, but I seem to remember it provides no "long double" functions at all) was "logl" because of R, but we patched R so that its not needed anymore, and the next R upstream version provides a configure option to disable the use of "long double" functions anyway.

IIRC, because we (still) have some special-casing on Cygwin w.r.t. at least (just?) the (`long double`) gamma functions.




To repeat Karl-Dieter's question:  What is Cephes then needed for at all [on e.g. FreeBSD]?

I.e., we should probably check for those functions Cephes provides (and Sage needs) [unless we're on FreeBSD where Cephes gets built anyway, or `SAGE_PORT` is set].

Indeed, we cheat for logl/sqrtl/tgammal/lgammal in sage/symbolic/pynac_cc.h just as we do with the R patch for logl.

And as we only cheat on Cygwin, this implies Cephes is definitively needed on FreeBSD for this file already.

Don't really know.
Check for sqrtl, logl, tgammal and lgammal everywhere except where:
* we cheat, which is currently Cygwin,
* we install Cephes, which is currently FreeBSD.
And if that fails, rant that supported platform should provide "long double" functions (except for the the two categories filtered out above) and suggest:
* setting SAGE_PORT to something non-empty,
* and:
  * either try installing the Cephes spkg,
  * or cheating as on Cygwin.
Both of these will be non-trivial anyway.

Depends on who tries it...
* Cheating as on Cygwin is easy if you know where to look, although you should know a little bit of Sage to modify the R spkg, but I somehow agree it is not a long term solution, we don't want to patch every part of Sage which at some point will use "long double" functions... but then we can hope that Cygwin also include these functions in their libm, as they did for the "complex" functions, if every piece of software in the world need them.
* Don't really know if installing Cephes just works out of the box, i.e. "oh I have a non-C99 compliant libm, let's just install cephes and every piece of Sage looking for C99 libm functions will find them now", that's surely the case but I've never tried.

<a id='comment:29'></a>For Jeroen:

I guess we should check that the lapack (in fact its dependency liblapack0) and liblapack-devel packages are installed on Cygwin.
In fact it should be enough to check the existence of the import libraries for libblas (and liblapack once we get #10508 in) as I do in the spkg-install file of ATLAS from #10508:

```
    libraries = ['/usr/lib/libblas.dll.a', '/usr/lib/liblapack.dll.a']
    for lib in libraries:
        if not os.path.exists(lib):
            print '*'*75
            print 'Could not locate required file: "' + lib + '".'
            print 'On Cygwin you must install the following standard LAPACK Cygwin packages'
            print 'via the Cygwin setup.exe program in the "Math" category:'
            print '* lapack,'
            print '* liblapack-devel.'
            print 'Alternatively you can try building your own ATLAS by setting'
            print 'SAGE_ATLAS_ARCH to something sensible although that is not'
            print 'officially supported.'
            print '*'*75
            sys.exit(1)
```
Modifying the spkg from #10508 so that it correctly builds will be slighlty non-trivial, or rather the way we include that in Volker's autotools stuff needs some thoughts.

> Depends on who tries it...
> * Cheating as on Cygwin is easy if you know where to look, although you should know a little bit of Sage to modify the R spkg, but I somehow agree it is not a long term solution, we don't want to patch every part of Sage which at some point will use "long double" functions... but then we can hope that Cygwin also include these functions in their libm, as they did for the "complex" functions, if every piece of software in the world need them.
> * Don't really know if installing Cephes just works out of the box, i.e. "oh I have a non-C99 compliant libm, let's just install cephes and every piece of Sage looking for C99 libm functions will find them now", that's surely the case but I've never tried.
 
I think that for the long term, especially if a lot of standard stuff we need use "long double" functions by default and provide no way of easily disabling their use (as R will do), the best solution would be to:
* check for sqrtl (or any random "long double" function);
* if that's not available, then set some SAGE_INSTALL_CEPHES variable which triggers the installation of Sage;
* remove all the Cygwin "long double" hacks.

But please, let's do that later...
For the moment, just:
* check for sqrtl except on FreeBSD and Cygwin,
* rant if not available, provide links to C99 standard, suggest the user to use a mainstream OS, invite him to have coffee or whatever (and maybe mention the fact that if he dares to set SAGE_PORT, then he could also try to manually install the cephes spkg when something fails because of the lack of "long double" functions).

On Cygwin the lapack packages provide both BLAS and LAPACK.
And the current Sage's ATLAS spkg, or the one from #10508, does not build ATLAS on Cygwin.
It will not be really hard, but requires some more thoughts and work.

Assuming not, the check for SunOS is redundant anyway.

It all goes back to the philosophy of not checking the system, but checking features.

Ive got a slight preference for the SAGE_INST_CEPHES solution, espoecially it "could" be easier to maintain, but for the moment I could go with not even testing sqrtl anywhere assuming that its in the libm of supported platforms or were dealing with Cygwin or FreeBSD.

I don't really know what that "solution" would be.

The main thing I don't want is to spread the same checks in different places. For example, the lapack check should be either in prereq, either in ATLAS, not in both. Since it currently cannot be done only in prereq, it must be done in ATLAS.

That would be:

I thought that was basically what I was saying... not sure what happened here.

Anyway, as to the check, the reason to have it early is that atlas might build quite late in a process, and then someone says "Oh, Mxyzptlk, why did I waste all that time building Sage and I didn't have the right prereqs?"  Which I guess JP just said too.

And how would a prereq check "trigger" the installation of the cephes spkg? I don't think that can currently be done.

I certainly don't disagree with this, but for this to work (and also jpflori's idea of "triggering"), we need to change the prereq mechanism which is a lot less trivial than this ticket.

Just a little more details of the way I see this, but that may be wrong:
* at prereq time (or whenever the gcc version checks are done), set an env variable if the test fails (or the user can override it if he wants),
* then either our spkg system is smart enough to build the cephes spkg iff this variable is set, or the spkg-install script from cephes spkg checks its value by itself and decide whether it should build or not (just like it now checks it is running on FreeBSD).

Not really, the check for GCC is done in `spkg/install`, not prereq.

I agree that all these checks should eventually move to a new file `$SAGE_ROOT/configure`, but that would require some refactoring of the build system. Since the Sage+GIT people are also refactoring the build system, it might make sense to wait for sage-6.1 to do this.

Yes, I made #14447 but I'll let you write the patch.

As for the Cygwin version thing: I propose

```
if uname | grep CYGWIN >/dev/null; then
    ...
fi
```
