There is also this inconsistency in the output of the following two functions. In language, they say the same thing, but they are not mathematically equal (according to the current implementation):

```python
sage: G.<a,b> = FreeGroup()
sage: test = (a).fox_derivative(a)
sage: f = test.parent()
sage: g = GroupAlgebra(G, ZZ)
sage: print f
Group algebra of Free Group on generators {a, b, c, d, e} over Integer Ring
sage: print g
Group algebra of group "Free Group on generators {a, b, c, d, e}" over base ring Integer Ring
sage: print f == g
False
```

You don't understand the problem. They should be the same object because they are suppose to be the same group algebra since it comes from the same group.

I do not want to fix the comparisons between the two group algebra objects above. I just want to point out that from my point of view either
- asking sage for  f==g and expecting something mathematical is invalid and thus this ticket is  (1)
Or 
-  the way how comparisons are done in sage are unfortunate.(2)

if (1) holds, then I'm immediately questioning what would be the usual way to ask sage
if 'f' is equal to 'g' mathematically for any mathematical objects 'f' and 'g', regardless whether sage can answer this question or not. And, I expect that sage would NOT return 'false' in case sage is not able to answer the question. 'false' already has a meaning which is NOT 'cannot answer the question'

If that's your question then make a new ticket. This one is specifically about the group algebras being different objects, hence fundamentally not about comparisons.

Also, we have already had quite a number of discussions about trinary logic and `==` versus "isomorphic". sage-devel has probably a dozen such threads.
