This ticket implements plot options to control the graphical display of polygons:

```
    def plot(self, 
             point={}, line={}, polygon={},
             wireframe={}, fill={},
             **kwds):
        """
        Return a graphical representation.

        INPUT:

        - ``point``, ``line``, ``polygon`` -- Parameters to pass to
          point (0d), line (1d), and polygon (2d) plot
          commands. Allowed values are

          * Python dictionary: Passed as keywords to the plot
            commands.

          * String or triple of numbers: The color. This is equivalent
            to passing the dictionary ``{'color':...}``.
          
          * ``None`` or ``False``: Switch off drawing of the
            corresponding graphics options.

        - ``wireframe``, ``fill`` -- Similar to ``point`` / ``line`` /
          ``polygon``, but ``fill`` is used for the graphics objects
          in the dimension of the polytope and ``wireframe`` is used
          for all lower-dimensional graphics objects.

        - ``**kwds`` -- optional keyword parameters that are passed to
          all graphics objectcs.

        OUTPUT:

        A graphics object.

        TESTS::

            sage: square = polytopes.n_cube(2)
            sage: plt = square.plot()
            sage: for p in plt:
            ...       print p.options()['rgbcolor'], p
            (0, 0, 1) Point set defined by 4 point(s)
            (0, 0, 1) Line defined by 2 points
            (0, 0, 1) Line defined by 2 points
            (0, 0, 1) Line defined by 2 points
            (0, 0, 1) Line defined by 2 points
            (0, 1, 0) Polygon defined by 4 points

        Draw the lines in red and nothing else::

            sage: plt = square.plot(point=None, line='red', polygon=False)
            sage: for p in plt:
            ...       print p.options()['rgbcolor'], p
            red Line defined by 2 points
            red Line defined by 2 points
            red Line defined by 2 points
            red Line defined by 2 points

        Draw vertices in red, no lines, and a blue polygon::

            sage: plt = square.plot(point={'color':'red'}, line=False, fill=(0,0,1))
            sage: for p in plt:
            ...       print p.options()['rgbcolor'], p
            red Point set defined by 4 point(s)
            (0, 0, 1) Polygon defined by 4 points
        """

> As you remarked on #14181, this is not quite correct. If you have a 1-d polyhedron in 2-d ambient space then the fill color (and not the outline color) should apply to the line.

All I need for #4327 is to be able to specify the color for all of the polyhedron. The patch implements just that, and leaves things as they were before the patch otherwise. If someone wants to go further and allow for customizing both the fill color and the ouline color, please go ahead!

But I for myself need to focus on those things were I am already way too late (like #4327, and more importantly the functorial construction patch.

Cheers,

It's documented and tested at a low level. I let Volker decide whether we want to advertise it right now at a high level, or wait until the interface is set in stone.

Hi Volker!

Yes, the user interface is much better as you did it! Thanks for the gift :-)

I ran some systematic tests and added them to the documentation/tests
of plot. I stumbled on a couple corner cases, and reworked a bit the
logic in plot. In particular, the default value for the colors is now
handled by plot. A consequence is that the default coloring is uniform
for all dimension, whereas we used to have:

- 2D: blue wireframe, light green (0,1,0) fill
- 3D: light green (0,1,0) fill, blue wireframe
- 0D, 1D: everything blue

Is that ok?

The default is currently set to "green" for the fill and "blue" for
the wireframe, but feel free to change it to your taste. I also did a
couple micro improvements to the doc. If you are happy with the
reviewer patch, feel free to fold it in, customize the default colors
and set a positive review on my behalf (assuming I did not screw up
and the patchbot remains green of course).

Cheers,
                       Nicolas
