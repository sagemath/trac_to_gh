When building the PDF documentation, if there is problem while running `latex`, then the docbuilder just hangs forever *after building all documentation*. There is no obvious clue what the problem is apart from a message like the following (example from #9107) in the log file:

```

Also: the docbuilder should use $MAKE instead of make.

The cause of the crash seems to be a combination of:
1. `subprocess.CalledProcessError` instances cannot be unpickled properly.
2. The `multiprocessing` module uses pickles to transfer exceptions from the child process to the master process and apparently doesn't gracefully handle unpickling errors.

John, I still cannot reproduce your problems, can you say the exact steps that you did.

I am doing the following on `sage.math`:

1. Extract a Sage 5.9 binary:

```
jdemeyer@sage:/release$ tar xzf /home/release/sage-5.9/sage-5.9-boxen-x86_64-Linux.tar.gz
jdemeyer@sage:/release$ cd sage-5.9-boxen-x86_64-Linux
```

2. Apply the patch:

```
jdemeyer@sage:/release/sage-5.9-boxen-x86_64-Linux$ ./sage --hg -R devel/sage qimport -P http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/raw-attachment/ticket/14626/14626_workaround.patch
adding 14626_workaround.patch to series file
applying 14626_workaround.patch
now at: 14626_workaround.patch
```

3. Break LaTeX:

```
jdemeyer@sage:/release/sage-5.9-boxen-x86_64-Linux$ ( cd devel/sage && patch -p1 )
diff --git a/sage/algebras/steenrod/steenrod_algebra.py b/sage/algebras/steenrod/steenrod_algebra.py

Okay, sorry, you're right. It looked to me as though it was hanging, but that's because the shell prompt was buried in output from the still-running processes. I stupidly didn't think to hit RET to see if I got a shell prompt.

At some point we might want to provide an error message at the very end, which won't get lost amidst the output from parallel processes, but that can go on another ticket.

Do you remember the shell command that you ran (in particular, did you use any unusual redirections or piping)? Because otherwise I don't see how it can happen what you describe.

I just logged into sage.math and did

```
$ cd /scratch/palmieri/sage-5.10.beta4
$ ./sage --docbuild reference pdf
```
Then I see, in the middle of a lot of output,

```

 [23][36] [24]>] [70]
Chapter 11.
```
`palmieri@boxen:sage-5.10.beta4$` is my shell prompt. At the end of the output:

```
Output written on homology.pdf (117 pages, 651759 bytes).
Transcript written on homology.log.
```
but no shell prompt because it was already printed earlier.  With `make doc-pdf`, I see a proper error message at the end.

John: probably the "output after shell prompt" problem is caused by parallel docbuilding: it seems that, if one thread fails, the docbuilder master process exists and the other threads simply continue working...

Not really a bug, just a peculiarity of `multiprocessing.Pool` I guess.
