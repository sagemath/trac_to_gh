<a id='comment:2'></a>1) **Design** 

- the min-plus convention is standard ? I thought it was max-plus. I think that it might be an option of the ring to chose between min and max.

- Why did you choose to base it on real fields ? It seems more like a wrapper that call `+` and `max` (or `min`) appropriately. What if I want tropical integers ? Tropical real intervals ? (note: I do want those).

- It would be better to call `x.min(y)` (optimized mpfr stuff) instead of `min(x,y)` (Python generic stuff)

- For sake of optimization you should implement a `cdef _new` method that duplicate the object instead of calling `self.__class__(my_parent, my_new_value)`. It is the way it is for most cythonized elements.

2) **Documentation** the file is not included in the documentation. Moreover it might be nice to have more examples in the headers of the file (with a link to :wikipedia:Tropical_geometry... actually it might be a good idea to rewrite the wikipedia article ;-)

3) **Question** Do you know how I can build a tropical matrix ?

<a id='comment:5'></a>So just to make sure, you want tropical operations being performed with regular matrix multiplication, i.e.

```
[a b] * [c] = min(a+c, b+d)
        [d]
```
Which makes more sense, I was thinking of the set of all `n x m` matrices over a [totally ordered] ring R where the `min` would be the minimum of all the entries.

In general, creating a matrix space requires something in the category of `Rings`:

```
sage: MatrixSpace(NN, 3)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: base_ring (=Non negative integer semiring) must be a ring
```
(which is the same reason why the `matrix()` constructor fails). We could probably loosen the restriction to the `Semirings` category since we still have a `+` and `*`.

Best,

Travis

I'm going to review this (at least mathematically) in the next time, but one question first: does TropicalSemiring(R) really work only for rings R as the doc says, or also for ordered additive groups R (as it should imho)?

(Also I see a typo "parituclar".)

Oops, I forgot the most important part: If _use_min is set to False, then infinity() should be the smallest, not the largest element of the semiring.
