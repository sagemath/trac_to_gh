This is a follow-up to #13605. I think that several `__classcall_private__` methods in sage.combinat.partition are not needed.

There are some `__classcall_private__` methods that do an extensive preprocessing, or that deal with optional arguments. I work on making the latter automatic. But currently, thee `__classcall_private__` applications make sense.

However, I doubt that a `__classcall_private__` method makes sense that simply puts a `Integer(k)` around an argument `k` that is supposed to be an integer (python int or whatever). Since caching is by equality and since k as int, Integer, NN, QQ etc. evaluates equal, caching is not an issue here.

Depends on #13605
Depends on #11410
