Wow.

This patch is scary.

Really scary.

The construction is awful, and there's not much that I could do to make the code clear.

The point is that I do not understand the construction myself, and I did not try either, I just wanted to implement it. And it already took Quiiiiiiiiiiiiiite a lot of time, and headaches `:-)`

This patch implements a method that returns a Steiner Quadruple System whenever it exists. It follows the construction from Haim Hanani in a paper from 1960, which gives 6 differents constructions to make a large system from a small one, and all must be used to solve all cases.

Considering that I was able to test this code until `n =300`, and that all constructions have been tested for different values of `n`, I believe that this code is a correct counterpart of the paper itself.

Hi Nathann,

concerning typos, i think that the new doctest trick

```
....: 
```

was created to correctly align the indentations. Hence, it could be better to add 4 spaces in your examples, instead of 3.

Meuuuuuuuuuh non t'es pas tout seul a chialer dans ta chambre.

Oh ? Well, I added four. But I don't get why : I think that the purpose was to align the length of this with the length of "sage:". So I thought that the number of spaces put use in front of an "if" is irrelevant `O_o`

Ahahahah. Yeah, right. And in that case I wanted to store them `:-D`

The point is that while I was writing this patch I had a loop trying to build all SQS from 4 to 100, and it was slightly faster when cached. If you think that it is useless here I will remove it. I don't mind much `:-)`

Hello!

Don't ask how I came to this ticket.

I have a question. Is there a reason you use

{{{ for i in range(n) 
}}}

instead of 

```
for i in xrange(n)
```

?

Best,

J

> If speed is really an issue then you should switch to Cython, which will expand `for i in range()` directly into the corresponding C loop. So there isn't that much need for `xrange()` in Sage. 

Speed is not a problem for me at the moment. I can generate Steiner Quadruples Systems on 300 vertices, and to be honest I don't even have any use for such systems in Sage right now. I just love them very much `:-P`

Come on.. People write rules on that ? `O_O;;;`

I'll try to use less blank lines in the future... But I really think that it helps make the code more readable. And a blank line only weight 1 byte `:-P`

It might make it more readable for you since you know the big picture. But if you see the code for the first time you'll want to get an overview, and not wasting vertical screen estate is essential for that.
