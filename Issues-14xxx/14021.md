Some other time we may want to revisit the xmin versus horizontal min issue - but not here.  Nice work.

> Some other time we may want to revisit the xmin versus horizontal min issue - but not here.

I had opened #13368 to track this. I can't touch this unless I have more time. It will be a fairly intrusive change to enable xmin/xmax from plot, with lots of opportunity for breakage.
