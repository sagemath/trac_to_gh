This is broken, and there is an easy fix.

The fix seems to work as expected. Could you please:
* Add your real name in the "Author" Field of the ticket
* Improve the documentation of the function (as discussed)
* Add a doctest enforcing that the problem is fixed

After that, the tickets get a positive review (if the patchbot agrees).
