The problem on OS X is:

```
sage: import select
sage: f = open(os.devnull)
sage: select.select([],[],[f])
([], [], [<open file '/dev/null', mode 'r' at 0x113ac7420>])
```
For some reason, most files have an "exceptional condition" by default on OS X. I have no idea why or what this means.

The parallel testing problem with #12415 on OS X was due to `Pdb()` importing `readline`. Importing readline hangs (probably because more than one process tries to take control over the terminal somehow). The solution is simply not starting `Pdb` if not needed.
