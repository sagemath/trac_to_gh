When PARI objects are wrapped into Python objects, they are copied from the PARI stack to a `malloc`'ed memory block.  This is done by the function `deepcopy_to_python_heap()` in `sage/libs/pari/gen.pyx`.  To determine how much memory to allocate, this function creates a dummy copy on the stack and measures by how much the stack pointer goes down.  This is inefficient and can be improved by calling PARI's `gsizebyte()` function, which does exactly what we want.

Also, copying the object to the `malloc`'ed block is done inelegantly by temporarily changing the global variables `top`, `bot` and `avma` defining the PARI stack.  Again, there is a PARI function that does what we want: `gcopy_avma()` does the same as `gcopy()`, but copies to a user-specified address.

I am attaching a patch that replaces `deepcopy_to_python_heap()` by a simpler and faster implementation.  (It also deletes a comment that seems to refer to code that no longer exists.)

Could you provide some timing here demonstrating the speed up?
It would be nice to keep track of it at least here (obviously theres no way to provide doctests for that).
