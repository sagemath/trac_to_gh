It appears that the strongly regular thing does not handle complete graphs

```
sage: G.is_strongly_regular()

what it should return is false. I am currently too lazy to fix this so I am reporting it in case anyone of you guys is willing to fix it. Otherwise I might do it at some undefined time in the future.
