```
The permutation group method to_presentation wraps the GAP function IsomorphismFpGroupByGenerators which yields an isomorphism from a given group to an isomorphic finite presentation. to_presentation takes the image of the isomorphism returned by this function and wraps it as a Sage finitely presented group.

```
sage: G = DihedralGroup(8); G
Dihedral group of order 16 as a permutation group
sage: G.to_presentation()
Finitely presented group < a, b | b^2, b*a^-1*b*a^-1, a^8 >
```
Depends on #14790 which gives the python generator object needed for variable names.

I don't like the whole conversion to string and then evaluating it. You should convert the generators to Tietze words which are just tuples of integers and hence don't depend on the generator names.

For consistency with the other group theory code, I'd rather call the method `as_finitely_presented_group()`. For example, we also have

```
sage: G.<a,b> = FreeGroup()
sage: H = G / (a^2, b^3, a*b*~a*~b)
sage: H.as_permutation_group()
Permutation Group with generators [(1,2)(3,5)(4,6), (1,3,4)(2,5,6)]
```
Small nitpicks:
* Empty line after the title ("Return a finitely presented group...")
* Two dashes after input: <code>- \`\`reduced\`\` --\`</code>, this is the ReST code for en dash

Comments:

1.  Volker's Tietze word suggestion is a good one.  Capitalize Tietze where you use it, isn't a person's name?

2.  `to_` or `as_`?  Seems Sage uses "to" more often, but you do see "as" in group theory code.

3.  Drop # in text of TESTS in doc tests and make this actual text that will appear properly in documentation.

4.  When you illustrate "reduced" in doctest, write  `(reduced=True)` to make it clearer what you are illustrating.

5.  Drop `sage_eval` import.  Check othrs-

6.  In code.  I'm sympathetic to aligning equals sign in four assignments, but I would drop it.

Ready for review?

Its better to break overly long lines, e.g.

```
        ret_rls = tuple([F(rel_word.TietzeWordAbstractWord(image_gens).sage()) 
                         for rel_word in image_fp.RelatorsOfFpGroup()])  
```
instead of

```
        ret_rls = tuple([F(rel_word.TietzeWordAbstractWord(image_gens).sage()) for rel_word in image_fp.RelatorsOfFpGroup()])  
```
