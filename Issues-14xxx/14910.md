<div id="comment:0"></div>

The permutation group method to_presentation wraps the GAP function IsomorphismFpGroupByGenerators which yields an isomorphism from a given group to an isomorphic finite presentation. to_presentation takes the image of the isomorphism returned by this function and wraps it as a Sage finitely presented group.

```
sage: G = DihedralGroup(8); G
Dihedral group of order 16 as a permutation group
sage: G.to_presentation()
Finitely presented group < a, b | b^2, b*a^-1*b*a^-1, a^8 >
```
Depends on #14790 which gives the python generator object needed for variable names.

Small nitpicks:
* Empty line after the title ("Return a finitely presented group...")

Comments:

1.  Volker's Tietze word suggestion is a good one.  Capitalize Tietze where you use it, isn't a person's name?

2.  `to_` or `as_`?  Seems Sage uses "to" more often, but you do see "as" in group theory code.

3.  Drop # in text of TESTS in doc tests and make this actual text that will appear properly in documentation.

4.  When you illustrate "reduced" in doctest, write  `(reduced=True)` to make it clearer what you are illustrating.

5.  Drop `sage_eval` import.  Check othrs-

6.  In code.  I'm sympathetic to aligning equals sign in four assignments, but I would drop it.

Its better to break overly long lines, e.g.

```
        ret_rls = tuple([F(rel_word.TietzeWordAbstractWord(image_gens).sage()) 
                         for rel_word in image_fp.RelatorsOfFpGroup()])  
```
instead of

```
        ret_rls = tuple([F(rel_word.TietzeWordAbstractWord(image_gens).sage()) for rel_word in image_fp.RelatorsOfFpGroup()])  
```
