It looks like it's exactly that problem. Look at line 573 of plural.pyx

```
    def __hash__(self):
...
        return id(self)
```
The special method `__hash__` is supposed to return a `Py_hash_t` (probably a "long"). The code is trying to return `id`, which is a python integer, and on a machine where ints are 32 bits, can easily exceed `2^31`. So it won't be able to convert to an int. Explicitly cast instead, via something like

```
    return <Py_hash_t><void*>self
```
which will be orders of magnitude faster too.

Incidentally, Python itself shifts right by 2 any time an id gets used as a hash, because the lowest two bits are almost certainly 0.

Looks like this line is due to #4539, patch `trac4539_fix_docs_rel10903.patch`. This is liable to fail on any 32-bit platform (64 bit too, very few systems make it into the upper half of the address space there).

I'm pretty sure that the proposed fix would be safe.

It's a standard type in CPython, so then it simply doesn't get imported into cython. Something along the lines of

```
    cdef extern ctypedef int Py_hash_t
```
should do the trick (as far as cython is concerned, typechecking on `int` is close enough. The generated `C` will see the proper definition).

If you feel that's too heavy handed  you can also just cast `<long><void *>self`, which will be close enough.

Cygwin is 32 bits only so I don't think the fact that Windows is or not matters.
Anyway I'll check on a completly 32 bits setup later.

Same result with 5.9.beta1 on the completely 32 bits system, I mean no error for me.

Karl-Dieter, I know it will take some time, but could you give sage-5.9.beta* a shot?

Anyway, if the id(self) looks really fishy, we could just relpace it, even if the error disappear in 5.9.

Yes, that just means that the pointers in question happen to end up in the lower half of the memory map on your machine.
