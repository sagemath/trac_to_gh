Notwithstanding that the [tour of algebra and calculus](http://sagemath.org/doc/tutorial/tour_algebra.html) dates from years and years ago in Sage time, someone at the [public bug reports](https://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=pCwvGVwSMxTzT6E2xNdo5fA) seems to have noticed that in some of the `math::` markup regions there are extra asterisks that aren't necessary.

A typical example is [here](http://hg.sagemath.org/sage-main/file/9519a7bb2f42/doc/en/tutorial/tour_algebra.rst#l306)

```
.. math::   y(x+h) \approx y(x) + h*f(x,y(x)).
```
doesn't need the `*`, or it should have `\cdot`.
