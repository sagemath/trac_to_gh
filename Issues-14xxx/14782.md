The axes do not get plotted in this

```
plot_loglog(x^2,(x,1,100),base=10,ticks=[[],[]])
```
whereas they do get plotted in linear scale

```
plot(x^2,(x,1,100),base=10,ticks=[[],[]])
```

Here is a "minimal" (really???!!!) code to reproduce it in matplotlib

```
from matplotlib.figure import Figure
from matplotlib.ticker import NullLocator
from matplotlib.backends.backend_agg import FigureCanvasAgg
import matplotlib.lines as lines
figure=Figure()
subplot = figure.add_subplot(111)
subplot.add_line(lines.Line2D(range(10), range(10)))

subplot.spines['right'].set_visible(False)
subplot.spines['left'].set_position(('outward',10))
subplot.spines['top'].set_visible(False)
subplot.spines['bottom'].set_position(('outward',10))

subplot.xaxis.set_major_locator(NullLocator())
subplot.yaxis.set_major_locator(NullLocator())

figure.set_canvas(FigureCanvasAgg(figure))
figure.savefig('a.png', bbox_inches='tight', bbox_extra_artists=[])
```

Things which bring back the axes:
1. Set the `outward` parameter a bit less

```
subplot.spines['bottom'].set_position(('outward',7)) # just barely
subplot.spines['left'].set_position(('outward',7))
```
2. Either remove `bbox_inches='tight'` or `bbox_extra_artists=[]` from the `savefig` command.

**Edit**: Note that the above is *not* in log scale!

Weird, though I believe this probably is minimal, after reading the graphics code for the axes again.  I'll let you decide whether this is a mpl bug and whether to report it upstream; it may be intended behavior.


In fact, what this also fixes is the following, which was missed before because the axes were so big they were drawn to touch.

```
sage: plot(x^2,(x,1,2),ticks=[[],[]])
```
while

```
sage: plot(x^2,(x,1,2),ticks=[[],[3,4]])
```
was only missing one axis.  So it is really tight, no extra artists, and no (or few) ticks that does it!  Quite a combination.

So positive review to your fix!  Do you want to include a doctest?  I don't know that we could automatically check for this - I poked around with `P.matplotlib()` for a while trying to get access to this but couldn't find something telling me it was invisible, and in fact it still seems to have all the attributes that would automatically accrue to it.

I do not know how to doctest this. That's why there is no doctest included.

As for whether it is an mpl bug or not, I am quite divided. It is the Sage code which sets `(outward,10)` for the axis. I am not sure if this is intended behavior. It is definitely not default behavior for mpl.

> I do not know how to doctest this. That's why there is no doctest included.

I suppose one could just include a plot like `plot(x^2,(x,1,2),ticks=[[],[]])` as a doctest, with a comment pointing out "fixes :trac:`14782`" or something.  We do that occasionally when there is no other way to do so.  If it's not too much trouble, I think that would be good - could certainly go in an obscure part of `TESTS:` or something.
