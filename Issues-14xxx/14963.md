In Sage-5.11, there is a lot of functionality for computing with S-units (see #14746) but no support for this in the `UnitGroup` class in `sage/rings/number_field/unit_group.py`.   This ticket adds such support, also adding a wrapper for the PARI function `bnfissunit`.

The old number field method S_units is probably now redundant; I added a note there directing users to S_unit_group for great functionality, as we do for units.

I will do that, though it is exceedingly annoying to have to do so in order to satisfy some third party whose patch touched hundreds of files and therefore causes many other people such an inconvenience.  There should be a fine for that!

Reviewer patch updated to make the `bnfissunit()` wrapper use `pari_catch_sig_on()` (the new name of the PARI version of `sig_on()`, see #15124).

Tests pass on my 64-bit system, but there might possibly be some doctest failures on 32-bit systems due to different PARI behaviour for 32/64 bits.
