In Sage-5.11, there is a lot of functionality for computing with S-units (see #14746) but no support for this in the `UnitGroup` class in `sage/rings/number_field/unit_group.py`.   This ticket adds such support, also adding a wrapper for the PARI function `bnfissunit`.

> Did you write this patch on a 32-bit system?  I am getting two doctest failures in my 64-bit Sage 5.11.rc0, which are almost certainly due to 32/64-bit differences in PARI (this also occurred in the two dependencies of this ticket).

Yes, I did this on my laptop at the Leiden Sage Days and that's 32-bit.  Sorry for not testing on 64-bit too, and thanks for makinf the necessary fixes.  Sorry too for the trailing whitspace in my cut-and-paste doctests, I usually remember to get rid of it.

And thanks for the positive review!

> Apart from that, I can only suggest a few cosmetic changes (mostly trailing whitespace).  I will upload a reviewer patch and am planning to give this a positive review once doctesting has finished.

I will do that, though it is exceedingly annoying to have to do so in order to satisfy some third party whose patch touched hundreds of files and therefore causes many other people such an inconvenience.  There should be a fine for that!

Reviewer patch updated to make the `bnfissunit()` wrapper use `pari_catch_sig_on()` (the new name of the PARI version of `sig_on()`, see #15124).

Tests pass on my 64-bit system, but there might possibly be some doctest failures on 32-bit systems due to different PARI behaviour for 32/64 bits.
