In Sage-5.11, there is a lot of functionality for computing with S-units (see #14746) but no support for this in the `UnitGroup` class in `sage/rings/number_field/unit_group.py`.   This ticket adds such support, also adding a wrapper for the PARI function `bnfissunit`.

Reviewer patch updated to make the `bnfissunit()` wrapper use `pari_catch_sig_on()` (the new name of the PARI version of `sig_on()`, see #15124).

Tests pass on my 64-bit system, but there might possibly be some doctest failures on 32-bit systems due to different PARI behaviour for 32/64 bits.
