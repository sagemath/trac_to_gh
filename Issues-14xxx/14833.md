This patch makes the `FiniteField` constructor call the implementation-independent code for choosing irreducible polynomials from #14832.

With this patch, the generic constructor always passes an actual polynomial (not a string specifiying an algorithm to construct one) to the finite field implementation class.  For backwards compatibility, the existing classes still recognise a string `modulus`.  Checking if the finite field is a Conway polynomial is now done by an implementation-independent function.

This is a dependency of #12142.

It may be better to use a function decorator to do the caching of the is_conway method, i.e. use `@`cached_method.

And is there any point to prevent setting the default return value for finite fields explicitely constructed with conway polynomials?
(i.e. removing what would be the equivalent of "self._is_conway = True" after the "modulus == "conway"" tests? to set the default value of the cached_method you can use "self.is_conway.set_cache(True)".)

OK, I'll fix this as soon as I have time, unless you or someone else does it first.

> And is there any point to prevent setting the default return value for finite fields explicitely constructed with conway polynomials?
