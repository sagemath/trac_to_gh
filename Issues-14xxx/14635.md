Even though Chris has added some combinatorial maps to Dyck paths in #14302, some are still missing:

- reading_permutation
- to_permutation
- to_noncrossing_partition
- to_ordered_tree
- decomposition_reverse
- area_dinv_to_bounce_area_map
- bounce_area_to_area_dinv_map

But to get this running we have to make sure that any map applied to a DyckWord_complete is again a DyckWord_complete (similar to our issues with Tableaux - StandardTableaux).

All these maps seem to exist now. Can we close this old and empty ticket ?
