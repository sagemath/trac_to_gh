On `hawk`, importing `scipy` fails with

This seems to come from GCC, so I'll try again with Sage's GCC (the error above was with GCC-4.4.3)

Indeed.
Some pointers:
* http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=43980
and a bunch of similar ones on other systems alos closed as invalid,
or
* http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=47460
For GCC 4.4.x you should explicitely pass -march=something-that-works to get that function, whereas for more recent GCCs it seems to be implied automatically from the value of target.
