It would be nice to have a function which converts algebraic numbers to symbolic expressions using radicals, at least for those cases where this is possible (i.e. the cases where the minimal polynomial of the algebraic number has a degree less than 5). For the quadratic case, I have a code snippet to illustrate what I'm asking for:

```
def AA2SR(x):
    x = AA(x)
    p = x.minpoly()
    if p.degree() < 2:
        return SR(QQ(x))
    if p.degree() > 2:
        raise TypeError("Cannot handle degrees > 2")
    c, b, a = p.coeffs()
    y = (-b+sqrt(b*b-4*a*c))/(2*a)
    if x == AA(y):
        return y
    y = (-b-sqrt(b*b-4*a*c))/(2*a)
    assert x == AA(y)
    return y

def QQbar2SR(x):
    x = QQbar(x)
    return AA2SR(x.real()) + I*AA2SR(x.imag())
```

These functions could then be applied to vectors or matrices over algebraic real or complex numbers in order to obtain an exact description of the relevant values using radicals.

This request is a spin-off from [my question on Ask Sage](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/2209/radical-expression-for-algebraic-number).

I think the feature you are looking for sort of exists. But it is available for elements of number fields, not algebraic numbers. And it is pretty inconvenient to use with algebraic numbers because `alg.as_number_field_element()` returns `alg` as an element of an abstract number field (plus an embedding of that number field into `QQbar` or `AA`), while conversion to symbolic expressions expects a number field with a registered embedding into `CC` or `RR`.

Yet, with the example from your question on AskSage, one can do:

```
sage: a = N[0][0]
sage: nf, val, nf2alg = a.as_number_field_element()
sage: approx = CC(nf2alg(nf.gen()))
sage: embedded_nf = NumberField(nf.polynomial(), 'a', embedding=approx)
sage: nf2nf = sage.rings.number_field.number_field_morphisms.NumberFieldEmbedding(nf, embedded_nf, embedded_nf.gen())
sage: SR(nf2nf(val))
1/5*sqrt(5)
```

So I disagree with the approach you take in your patch: IMO, we should make something like the above example work automatically and share the actual conversion code between algebraic numbers and number fields instead of implementing essentially the same feature twice.

[edit: add missing word]

I notice that in real world applications, the check for `self == QQbar(res)` takes excessively long. Example:

`QQ[x](16*x^6 - 392*x^4 + 133*x^2 + 900).roots(AA, False)[-1].radical_expression()`

It gets stuck in several layers of `exactify`, but eventually the keyboard interrupt ends up here:

a == b

The problem is, an expression like this:

```
(2/9*I*sqrt(443)*sqrt(3) + 53/27)^(1/3)
```
has (at least) 3 possible values. You need to specify branch cuts to single out a particular value in, say, CC. Algebraically, `sqrt(443)`, `sqrt(3)`, and `I` have the same problem. So when you first construct this element you are making essentially the ring

```
QQ[x,y,z,w]/(x^2-443,y^2-3,z^2+1,w^3-(2/9*z*x*y + 53/27))
```
which is of rather high degree.

The other elements you add to this will just add to the degree, since the next time a `sqrt(443)` is encountered, it is not algebraically clear that this is supposed to be the same as the one designated by `x`. The complex embedding that comes with AA or Qbar specifies some of the ambiguity (e.g., the branch cut of `sqrt(443)` will ensure the "positive" root always), but once you start taking roots of complex numbers, the cuts might not even do what they algebraically are supposed to (e.g., `-(z)^(1/3) != (-z)^(1/3)` ).

While in the expression for `b` that you give, it is exactly the same expression that you are taking the cube root of repeatedly, one can only see this after careful inspection. For a human it's clear you're meaning the "same" cube root every time, but the computer has no immediate way of finding that out. A priori, all the choices made by `sqrt...` and `(...)^(1/3)` are considered as algebraically unrelated and only with laborious computations using the embedding in `CC` does one rediscover those relations. If instead you do

```
u=Qbar(sqrt(-3))
v=Qbar(sqrt(443))*u
w=Qbar( (2/9*v+53/27)^(1/3))
```
and then construct b from that, you should already get a little faster results.

The problems you are running into are fairly well-understood and real. Symbolic notation as you use it fails to express the full algebraic relations once you start repeating related expressions.

**EDIT:** apologies. The fact that the value didn't match was due to a missubstitution on my part. I've corrected the result below. The value `b` computed does match what it's supposed to be:

```
sage: u=QQbar(sqrt(-3))
sage: v=QQbar(sqrt(443))*u
sage: w=(2/9*v + 53/27)^(1/3)
sage: b = -1/1296*((9*u*w + 9*w - 37*u/w + 37/w + 18)*(9*u*w + 9*w - 37*u/w + 37/w - 12) - 3456)*sqrt(-9/2*u*w - 9/2*w + 37/2*u/w - 37/2/w + 6)
sage: b
4.904821984561304? + 0.?e-16*I
sage: 16*b.minpoly() #still takes a long time
16*x^6 - 392*x^4 + 133*x^2 + 900
```
The fundamental problem remains, though: the symbolic version doesn't quite carry the same information. In addition, some of the slowness might be due to ``QQbar` itself, since:

```
sage: t=(-9/2*u*w - 9/2*w + 37/2*u/w - 37/2/w + 6)
sage: t.minpoly() # this is fast
x^3 - 18*x^2 - 891*x + 2916
sage: r=sqrt(t)
sage: r.minpoly() # this is quite slow
x^6 - 18*x^4 - 891*x^2 + 2916
sage: b = -1/1296*((9*u*w + 9*w - 37*u/w + 37/w + 18)*(9*u*w + 9*w - 37*u/w + 37/w - 12) - 3456)*r
sage: b.minpoly() #this is now pretty quick
x^6 - 49/2*x^4 + 133/16*x^2 + 225/4
```
so QQbar is slow exactifying an element `r` for which it has all relevant algebraic information (it's the square root of `t`, which has a known minimal polynomial)

Computer algebra systems such as maple have their own symbolic ways of dealing with the ambiguity introduced by defining elements as "roots" of polynomials:

```
> lprint(solve(x^5+4*x+1));
RootOf(_Z^5+4*_Z+1,index = 1), RootOf(_Z^5+4*_Z+1,index = 2), RootOf(_Z^5+4*_Z
+1,index = 3), RootOf(_Z^5+4*_Z+1,index = 4), RootOf(_Z^5+4*_Z+1,index = 5)
```
which allows it to simplify `RootOf(_Z^5+4*_Z+1,index = 1)-RootOf(_Z^5+4*_Z+1,index = 1)` to 0 but leave `RootOf(_Z^5+4*_Z+1,index = 1)-RootOf(_Z^5+4*_Z+1,index = 2)` alone. This doesn't capture the algebraic dependencies between the roots, but at least allows identification of each root individually.

    "body": "<a id='comment:13'>Comment 13:</a>\nThanks for explaining a bit of what's going on here to cause such delays. Alternate ways to compute things more efficiently are all very well, but won't be of use unless I can make this automatic somehow. After all, on the high level all I do is compare two numbers, without wanting to think about implementation details.\n\nWhile investigating this problem, I noticed that for my original length expression `b` the call `b.minpoly()` works *really* fast, whereas `QQbar(b).minpoly()` takes ages. Makes me wonder whether the exactification should be somehow based on the minimal polynomial of the symbolic expression. Or at least leverage some of the machinery which makes that so fast. That should speed up the kind of comparison I'm using. Or is that computation somehow inexact?\n\nLet me try to think this through. Naively I'd rewrite `sage.symbolic.expression_conversions.algebraic` to first compute the minpoly of the expression in question. I fear that this might take long, which is a problem in those cases where we don't need the exact representation. So it would probably be better to only do this on demand. Which raises several related questions.\n\n* Can we store a reference to a symbolic expression without having to worry that it will get modified? Are symbolic expressions read-only after construction?\n* Can we afford the cost of storing whole symbolic expressions in addition to their AA or QQbar converted forms?

<a id='comment:13'>Comment 13:</a>
Thanks for explaining a bit of what's going on here to cause such delays. Alternate ways to compute things more efficiently are all very well, but won't be of use unless I can make this automatic somehow. After all, on the high level all I do is compare two numbers, without wanting to think about implementation details.

While investigating this problem, I noticed that for my original length expression `b` the call `b.minpoly()` works *really* fast, whereas `QQbar(b).minpoly()` takes ages. Makes me wonder whether the exactification should be somehow based on the minimal polynomial of the symbolic expression. Or at least leverage some of the machinery which makes that so fast. That should speed up the kind of comparison I'm using. Or is that computation somehow inexact?

Let me try to think this through. Naively I'd rewrite `sage.symbolic.expression_conversions.algebraic` to first compute the minpoly of the expression in question. I fear that this might take long, which is a problem in those cases where we don't need the exact representation. So it would probably be better to only do this on demand. Which raises several related questions.

* Can we store a reference to a symbolic expression without having to worry that it will get modified? Are symbolic expressions read-only after construction?
* Can we afford the cost of storing whole symbolic expressions in addition to their AA or QQbar converted forms? Or should we try to reconstruct the symbolic expression from the descriptor DAG when needed?
* How do we link the symbolic expression with the algebraic number? We could invent a descriptor which is layered around the one returned from the current conversion approach, but whose `exactify` method will compute the minimal polynomial of the whole expression instead of recursing.
* On the other hand, we might need access to the current interval, so an alternative would be storing such information in `AlgebraicNumber_base` and modify its `exactify` method to take the additional information into account.
* Are there cases where a symbolic `minpoly` would take significantly more time than the corresponding recursive `exactify`? If so, can we somehow detect these cases before we start the symbolic `minpoly` computation?
* We need to find roots for that polynomial, which I'd so via a simple `p.roots(self.parent(), False)` unless someone suggests otherwise.
* Wen need to compare them to the approximation returned by the nested descriptor. Which is probably the main reason to have this in `AlgebraicNumber_base` instead of some `ANDescr` descendant.
* We might have to increase precision until the interval contains no more than a single solution. Simple with `AlgebraicNumber_base._more_precision` but difficult or wasteful for `ANDescr`.

Does this approach make sense?

Created spinn-off ticket:16222 for this.

For this one here, I have another solution in mind which I'll push shortly.

I found that my branch still has some problem. In particular, in the following situation Sage will do the conversion even though it is inexact.

```
sage: sorted(QQ[x](x^7 - x - 1).roots(QQbar, False), key=imag)[0].radical_expression()
-3775/3963*I - 2573/7076
```

So my assumption that an inexact solution will always leas to floats embedded into SR appears to be wrong. Is there some other way to check whether a given result is exact? Or perhaps even to not try any inexact conversion at all? I found no such thing, but it seems to me I haven't found the core of this conversion either.

> IMHO #16651 should be fixed instead of adding workarounds for #16651 elsewhere.

Even with #16651 fixed, there are several reasons why I'd consider the detour via `NumberFieldElement` to be inferior to my approach here.

1. In case of no exact solution, `NumberFieldElement` will use an approximation, while my idea here is to never loose precision. So you'd have to either declare all uses of approximation in `NumberFieldElement` to be undesired as well, or add some flag to suppress approximate solutions. Or detect them after the fact, and hope I get it right this time around.

2. In some cases, the degree used for the conversion to a number field element is much bigger than that of the minimal polynomial. In [one case](https://gist.github.com/gagern/7fc8ebccfdff9b545771) I've seen the number field to have a dense defining polynomial of degree 24, while the minpoly only had even degrees up to 6. This might of course well be considered a bug in its own right.

3. My code can deal with a situation where the number of distinct roots found by the symbolic solver does not equal the degree of the polynomial. `NumberFieldElement` will give up in that situation. I don't know yet whether we might encounter polynomials with multiple roots, and I don't know how likely it is for the solver to find only a subset of all roots. But with a too high degree and the use of `to_poly_solve=True` I consider both likely.

4. I'm not sure I trust the root matching in `ambient_field=ComplexField(53)`. There are cases where the different roots cannot be distinguished in this field, and I believe that in these cases the approach of “taking the closest root” is unreliable at best.

If you are confident that most of the issues raised above should be fixed for `NumberFieldElement` as well, then I'll investigate options to share code between both implementations.

They don't do the *same* thing. Please read my [comment:26](#comment%3A26). Looking at the code, the common functionality is essentially two and a half lines:

```python
poly = self.minpoly()
var = SR(poly.variable_name())
for soln in SR(poly).solve(var, …
```

Where I pass `explicit_solutions=True`, number field elements pass `to_poly_solve=True`. Where they collect all roots and do a closest root matching in a 53 bit ambient field, I only collect roots which fall into our separating interval and hope (but don't require) that only one of the roots found does that. Where they give up in cases where not all solutions were found, I try each found solution to check whether it's the one I need. I do the same verification if I got more than one root into my isolating interval, contrary to my hope stated above.

Perhaps a `def isolating_interval(self)` method of `NumberFieldElement` and an analogous function for `QQbar`?

Using such a function properly, you wouldn't need to consider the case of multiple `candidates`, it's better to *ensure* a priori that you have only a single candidate.

NumberFieldElement [only converts the field generator](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/blob/develop/src/sage/rings/number_field/number_field_element.pyx?id=4e629501a164188d17dfce651d9854f3d91f25da#n2200) to symbolic, everything else is accomplished by plugging that into a polynomial.\n2. The image of the generator comes from the embedding, and as such will be [either from an exact field or from a lazy field](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/blob/develop/src/sage/rings/number_field/number_field_morphisms.pyx?id=4e629501a164188d17dfce651d9854f3d91f25da#n494).\n3.

Digging for that myself, I found that

1. NumberFieldElement [only converts the field generator](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/blob/develop/src/sage/rings/number_field/number_field_element.pyx?id=4e629501a164188d17dfce651d9854f3d91f25da#n2200) to symbolic, everything else is accomplished by plugging that into a polynomial.
2. The image of the generator comes from the embedding, and as such will be [either from an exact field or from a lazy field](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/blob/develop/src/sage/rings/number_field/number_field_morphisms.pyx?id=4e629501a164188d17dfce651d9854f3d91f25da#n494).
3. If it comes from an exact field, it is likely already from `QQbar` or `AA` or easily converted to those. If it comes from a lazy field, [it's a LazyAlgebraic](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/blob/develop/src/sage/rings/number_field/number_field_morphisms.pyx?id=4e629501a164188d17dfce651d9854f3d91f25da#n64) and as such [essentially an element of AA or QQbar](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/blob/develop/src/sage/rings/real_lazy.pyx?id=4e629501a164188d17dfce651d9854f3d91f25da#n1626) as well, at least if you want guaranteed isolation.

So I wonder whether instead of moving the common code to some common function, we should simply replace the relevant portion of `NumberFieldElement._symbolic_` with a call to this newly provided `AlgebraicNumber_base.radical_expression()`. That would leave my code where it currently is, would avoid code duplication and should have about the same kind of performance unless I overlooked something in my investigation above.

What do you think?

> Perhaps a `def isolating_interval(self)` method of `NumberFieldElement` and an analogous function for `QQbar`?

The latter would be easy: simply return the `_value` of the descriptor. The former might be more tricky. As outlined above, the image of the generator can be different things, and the best way to avoid a million case distinctions is probably by casting it to `AA` or `QQbar` as appropriate. The isolating interval of a non-generator would depend on the minimal polynomial of that element, and the best way I can think of to find an isolating interval for that as well would again be to cast it to `AA` resp. `QQbar`.

If we build `NumberFieldElement._symbolic_()` on `AlgebraicNumber_base.radical_expression()` as suggested above, then we have no need for such a method.

I don't follow you. You have isolating intervals. So say you have two roots, then you have some interval around each root. Then you take that interval field with its precision, and evaluate the symbolic expression in that. Nothing I can think of will ever guarantee a priori that the resulting interval for the symbolic expression doesn't overlap the intervals of both your roots. After all, the symbolic expression might be fairly involved, leading to high errors in the final interval.

No, it was a very general comment of the form "don't work around bugs". If you say "I implemented this by doing B instead of the more obvious A, since A is broken", then that's a sign that you should fix A first and then use A.

> deciding whether to algebraic numbers are equal is hard

Really, why? Isn't it just a matter of comparing the minimal polynomials first and then a floating-point interval approximation second? What's hard about that?

> If I understand you correctly, in [comment:43](#comment%3A43) you suggest that I wrap the whole candidate collection process in a big loop which increments precision until there is exactly one candidate left.

Exactly.

> The interval of the current algebraic number is known to be small enough to be isolating. But by sheer bad luck it might still be big enough that it almost touches a neighboring root, in which case increasing its precision once might lower the need for precision when evaluating the symbolic expressions.

Well yes. I think a large enough precision should always work.

Can that actually happen? I wouldn't mind to just give up in this case and don't return a radical expression.

You don't have to do that. You could just work with the minimal polynomial of the number field element (which is trivial to compute).

<a id='comment:53'>Comment 53:</a>
In my opinion it makes sense to have the special case for cyclotomics in number field element. Take the example from the doctest:

```
sage: K.<zeta> = CyclotomicField(19)
sage: SR(zeta) # indirect doctest
e^(2/19*I*pi)
```

Yes, this is a conversion of a number field generator to the symbolic ring, so it should be the output of a conversion from number field to symbolic. On the other hand, this is *not* a radical expression, therefore it would be unsuitable for `AlgebraicNumber_base.radical_expression()`. That's the reason I didn't move that code.

Of course, you could argue that we should have `AlgebraicNumber_base.symbolic_expression()`. But I'd still like to keep access to the radical expressions, for those cases where both make sense. Example:

```
sage: K.<z10> = CyclotomicField(10)
sage: a = z10 + z10^9
sage: SR(a)
-(e^(1/5*I*pi) - 1)*e^(2/5*I*pi) + 1
sage: AA(QQbar(SR(a))).radical_expression()
1/2*sqrt(5) + 1/2
```

The first thing makes sense if you are explicitely working in a cyclotomic field, where the symbolic expression for `z10` is something you can reasonably expect in your output. If, on the other hand, you work with algebraic numbers, you shouldn't have to care about the internal representation. Hiding the different internal implementations behind a common interface therefore felt good. *Every* algebraic number has a minimal polynomial. So I'm using that as the basis for my conversion. Special-casing the cyclotomics in qqbar would be a lot harder. It would depend on the actual descriptors, which in turn depend on the number fields used in their leafs, which in turn makes this conversion closer to number fields than what I did with the radical expressions.

So if I can convince you, I'd like to keep the current split as it is in my commits, and suggest a follow-up ticket for `AlgebraicNumber_base.symbolic_expression()`, where the best approach to implement that might still be subject to discussion.

1. Plugging symbolic expressions into polynomials tend to give more complicated expressions. So the conversion to symbolic should be done as very last thing.
2. With my code, the result doesn't depend on the choice of generator or number field: elements which are equal in `QQbar` yield equal symbolic expressions.
3. My code works in cases where the generator of the field doesn't have a radical expression, but the element does.

I understand your unhappiness, but consider that #17495 should be quite easy to fix and that #16964 is very much in need of a fix anyway (for various reasons, not just this ticket).

> I also have some doubts about the `refine_embedding` approach.

Perhaps, but those comments really belong to #17495.

However, it fails in cases where we are unable to find a radical expression for the element even though we would have been able to find one for the generator. Case in point:

```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(QQ['x']([6, -65, 163, -185, 81, -15, 1]), embedding=4.9)
sage: b = a + a^3
sage: SR(b)
120.55238677055798?
sage: b.polynomial()(SR(a))
1/8*((sqrt(4*(1/9*sqrt(109)*sqrt(3) + 2)^(1/3) - 4/3/(1/9*sqrt(109)*sqrt(3) + 2)^(1/3) + 17) + 5)^2 + 4)*(sqrt(4*(1/9*sqrt(109)*sqrt(3) + 2)^(1/3) - 4/3/(1/9*sqrt(109)*sqrt(3) + 2)^(1/3) + 17) + 5)
```

Not sure how to proceed here. One approach would be to try conversion of the non-generator element first, and if that fails (as evidenced by `x.radical_expression().parent() != SR`) try again for the generator and plug that into the polynomial.

Looking back to [comment:3](#comment%3A3) I find that for the example from [comment:67](#comment%3A67) that approach is able to find a radical expression on the level of the algebraic numbers, without knowledge of the original number field:

```
sage: c = AA.polynomial_root(b.minpoly(), RIF(120,121))
sage: nf, val, nf2alg = c.as_number_field_element()
sage: val.polynomial()(nf2alg(nf.gen()).radical_expression())
1/8*((sqrt(4*(1/9*sqrt(109)*sqrt(3) + 2)^(1/3) - 4/3/(1/9*sqrt(109)*sqrt(3) + 2)^(1/3) + 17) + 13)*(sqrt(4*(1/9*sqrt(109)*sqrt(3) + 2)^(1/3) - 4/3/(1/9*sqrt(109)*sqrt(3) + 2)^(1/3) + 17) + 1) + 52)*(sqrt(4*(1/9*sqrt(109)*sqrt(3) + 2)^(1/3) - 4/3/(1/9*sqrt(109)*sqrt(3) + 2)^(1/3) + 17) + 1) + 10
```

So in a certain sense, `as_number_field_element` makes it easier to find a symbolic expression for a given algebraic number, even though the expression found in this way may be more complicated. I wonder whether I should include that into my `radical_expression` method. Probably with a switch to allow disabling it.

That introduces regressions: stuff that used to convert to SR in the past will fail to do so once this gets merged. I'd prefer to avoid such breaks in backward compatibility, even if it means less elegant behavior.

That is true, but I can think of no way to maintain backwards compatibility and avoid that dependence.

I've essentially been toying with the original two polynomials until I got something real and with reasonable conversion to symbolic. There is no deeper meaning behind the actual values of the coefficients. The conversion to symbolic is possible because the polynomial in `y` is cubic, so one can express `y` using radicals, and once you know `y` the polynomial in `x` is quadratic so that, too, can be expressed using radicals. I was somewhat surprised that the symbolic expression could avoid complex numbers along the way, since usually solving cubic equations requires those.

I then did my performance test using `SR(a + k)` for some integer `k`. And at some point decided that I should try more complicated elements of that field as well, tried the `a + a^3` and was really surprised by the result.

So, I would say that your example was quite artificial and so perhaps the regression isn't so bad...

At least that example could certainly work using Galois theory (the splitting field has degree 48 and the Galois group can easily be computed using PARI).

OK, here is a compromise: remove the `via_nf` argument (just pretend that it's always `True`), add fallback code only to `qqbar.py` (i.e. undo df036339e25fcac24a3497b0cd74f4bf34d5816c) and clearly comment the fallback code as being a fallback in case that Maxima's `solve` doesn't work.

Could it be you are seeing the wrong patch direction here as well? We are *dropping* the `__symbolic` member and its caching functionality, since we don't expect to need it except in rare cases as a temporary solution.

Yes, you are definitely seeing the patch in the wrong direction. A good thing that you pasted the patch lines above, otherwise I would have ben thoroughly confused.

I must confess that I was a bit unhappy with that myself when I read it. But the code just changed place and location, it wasn't really changed. And I figure that if you ever have a cyclotomic field of such a great order that you are affected by rounding errors here, its dimension would be high enough that you'd not get any real work done with it in any case. So I decided not to complain or modify this, since it's not directly related to the issue at hand and I feard that discussing one more item might prevent stuff from getting accepted.

Are you sure you want this handled with this ticket here? If so I'll have to work out how to find the right `k` using exact arithmetic. I guess the integers are all there somewhere, but I'll have to look closer. It's been a while.

Thanks, that should be a quick and obvious improvement. Will push a commit to that effect once I know whether to address the approximation issue above as well.

It should be easy, `NumberField_cyclotomic` does have a method `.zeta_order()`. But then, the exact root of unity depends on the embedding... and I do not see how to avoid going to `QQbar` (or using in an ugly way interval approximations). It is really a pity that we use embedding into `RLF/CLF` by default and not `AA/QQbar` (see also #18103, #18104).

That won't work: at that point (since the `refine_embedding` line a bit above that), the object in question is a `morphism.NumberFieldHomomorphism_im_gens` and not a `number_field_morphisms.NumberFieldEmbedding` any more, so it doesn't have a `gen_image` method. I have no idea whether that's how it should be, but I'm fairly certain that if this should change, some other ticket should take care of that.

So I'm back to asking for review, even though I changed nothing.
