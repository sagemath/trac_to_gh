The tokenize() function in logic/logicparser.py is called when a new formula of propositional calculus is created using propcalc.formula(<formula_expression>).  The tokenize() function enters an infinite loop if the characters '<', '>', or '-', are used in <formula_expression> incorrectly (i.e. not as a part of one of the operators '<->' or '->').  The following code would cause an infinite loop because of the '-':

```python
sage: import sage.logic.propcalc as propcalc

sage: f = propcalc.formula("a-b")
```

The BooleanFormula class located in logic/boolformula.py also needs a method that returns the full syntax parse tree of a boolean formula, so that each formula has a unique parse tree.  The BooleanFormula tree() method does not serve this purpose.

[ ] Rewrite polish_notation to use 

```
   ''.join(sage.misc.flatten(logicparser.polish_parse(repr(self))))
```

[ ] Move this comment (below) so it aligns correctly, and there is a space after #:

```
    tree = tree_parse(toks, polish = True)
        #special case where the formula s is a single variable
    if type(tree) is StringType and len([tree]) == 1:
```

[ ] This looks suspicious since it is always tautologically true -- see if you can figure out what's up with this craziness:

```
    len([tree]) == 1
```

[ ] The Python way to do this

```
type(tree) is StringType
```
is to do this:

```
isinstance(tree, StringType)
```

[ ] Clean up this comment:

```
 #check to see if '-', '<' or '>' are used incorretly 
```
to

```
 # check to see if '-', '<' or '>' are used incorrectly 
```

[ ] Typo: `When true, caues the function to produce the full `  (missing letter in "caues")

[ ] Mention the default values in docstrings.

[ ] In python replace `if polish == False:` by the more idomatic `if not polish`

<a id='comment:6'></a>Almost there:

- typo "a boolean formlua".  

- typo "incorretly" 

Positive review once you post another little patch to fix those two typos.
