I'm surprised the bzip2 spkg-install doesn't start by checking if bzip2 is in the path... and just bail out if so: why build it anyway? As asked in the summary: was there ever a case where the system bzip2 wasn't suitable for sage?

> Was there ever a case where the system bzip2 wasn't suitable for sage?

I strongly doubt that... ;-)

As with many other spkgs, Sage simply doesn't bother to use a system-wide version.




Ceterum censeo Sage should (ship and) use `xz`.  (And make bzip2 a prerequisite + an *optional* spkg.)


Btw., zlib and similar are (redundantly) included in many upstream packages...

System bzip2 has probably always be suitable... provided that all the interesting bits are installed. I am guessing headers may be required and I am willing to bet that the library may not always installed by default (and that may have been more frequent in the past).

I know for sure that Python checks for and links against the bzip2 library. And I guess that the non-Darwin implementation of `sage --pkg` uses this.
