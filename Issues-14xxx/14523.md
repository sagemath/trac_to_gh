It seems like the only way to continue using this Sage session is to fix the error first. But suppose you have some reason not to (e.g. are in a hurry, and the error is hard to fix). I think it would be much better if Sage was to evaluate "1+1" and especially "exit" and "detach" even when unable to reload one of the attached files.

Possible ways to fix this are discussed on [sage-devel](http://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/sage-devel/FM7EAAmJhuk).

There is a behaviour of "attach" which bugs me.  If the file you try to attach generates an error when you attach it, then it doesn't actually get attached.  I don't see the point of this.

I do also have one comment about the current patch -- if it wouldn't be too complicated, I think it would be nice to get a new sage prompt after the reloading is finished, to indicate that it has completed.

We should keep a user-accessible list of loaded/attached files with some state, preparsed form, etc. Any debugging that you can do with temporary files can be done much nicer by querying the files on the command line.

Just checked in vanilla Sage 5.10.beta1, and there indeed three doctests fail (in `sage/misc/preparser.py`) if it is set to something non-empty.

So apparently this is not new, but could you also fix it here?

Although it's apparently not documented (at least not in Sage's documentation besides the docstring; it may get mentioned in some 3rd party documentation), I bet a couple of people will complain (probably much) later if we remove it... ;-)\n\nBut I'd rather tend to leave the (IMHO convenient) functionality, probably documenting it more prominently (it doesn't really fit into the Sage *Installation* Guide, just like other environment variables, which is a different story), and fixing potential doctest failures (which is a minor issue anyway) -- elsewhere, on another ticket.\n\n\n\n  \n> There should be a Python-level way to set the search path if desired. If you really need the functionality then you just have to call `sage.path(os.environ['SAGE_LOAD_ATTACH_PATH'])` in your own code.

Replying to [@vbraun](#comment%3A15):
> I think the undocumented `SAGE_LOAD_ATTACH_PATH` should be removed, not groomed further.

I have no strong opinion on doing so.  Although it's apparently not documented (at least not in Sage's documentation besides the docstring; it may get mentioned in some 3rd party documentation), I bet a couple of people will complain (probably much) later if we remove it... ;-)

But I'd rather tend to leave the (IMHO convenient) functionality, probably documenting it more prominently (it doesn't really fit into the Sage *Installation* Guide, just like other environment variables, which is a different story), and fixing potential doctest failures (which is a minor issue anyway) -- elsewhere, on another ticket.



  
> There should be a Python-level way to set the search path if desired. If you really need the functionality then you just have to call `sage.path(os.environ['SAGE_LOAD_ATTACH_PATH'])` in your own code. But that should be done on another ticket.

So you don't intend to remove it here either?  (Ok for me, just asking.)

Hey Volker,

Looks good for the most part. It's somewhat minor, but is there some way we can get it so that we get it to end with the sage prompt? For me it currently ends at a blank line, although it still accepts input correctly.

Thanks,

Also fixed Jeroen's doctest failures. First is stale python file (you need to run `sage -sync-build` to reproduce it), second is filesystem timestamp granularity.

Slightly beautified so the old command line is erased:

```
sage: attach('foo.py')
output from attached file
sage: 123_<-- cursor here 456
```
Now edit and save attached file, and you get

```
sage: attach('foo.py')
output from attached file
### reloading attached file t.py modified at 18:04:08 ###
output from changed attached file
sage: 123_<-- cursor here 456
```

On a related note, attaching files in the notebook is completely broken (with and without this ticket).

Hey Volker,

Sorry for letting this sit for so long. Looks good to me (I remembered to run sync-build this time to remove the old files before testing).

(Side note, does the patchbot run sync-build after applying patches? If not, I think doing this would be beneficial.)

Best,

Travis
