Configuration files should be placed into 'sysconfdir' [1]. Files such as gprc.expect in $(SAGE_LOCAL)/etc or default.qepcadrc in $(SAGE_LOCAL) will break future sagelib packaging.
SAGE_LOCAL will supposedly be set to 'prefix' for Sage-the-library packages.

It might make sense to add SAGE_ETC=sysconfdir to the environment (and use that whereever appropriate). sysconfdir defaults to prefix/etc (=SAGE_LOCAL/etc) but can be overridden for custom installations.

Go ahead (letting `SAGE_ETC` default to `$SAGE_LOCAL/etc`)...

(It's a bit funny to say Sage doesn't repect that `Makefile` variable when it doesn't even have a `configure`; Sage's top-level Makefile certainly doesn't follow any of those conventions, and the Sage library currently doesn't use `make` at all.)

My copy of Sage has a configure. I must have repressed the previous state. ;)

Replying to [@nexttime](#comment:2):
> P.S.:  Other config files end up below `$DOT_SAGE` (which defaults to `$HOME/.sage/`).

While I'm at it: How about use something like the following to access config files in general?

```python
def configfile(name):
  if os.exists(HOME + "/.sage/" + name)
    return open(HOME + "/.sage/" + name)
  return open("SAGE_ETC"+name)
```

This might increase readability and enable overrides.
