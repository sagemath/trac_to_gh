Could you also add in the doctest

```
Polyhedron(point_list,base_ring=QQ)
```
and 

```
Polyhedron(point_list,backend='ppl',base_ring=QQ)
```
to give people more hints how to avoid that error?

By the way, is there any reason for having `cdd` as the default backend? On this example it's more than 10 times slower than `ppl`.

cdd is the only backend for floating-point numbers, and therefore the default. Does anybody know a better floating-point implementation?

The `verbose` keyword argument just wasn't patched through correctly.
