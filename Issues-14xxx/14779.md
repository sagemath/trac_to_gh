The original example is no longer valid as of Sage 8.2-beta6. The following works nicely and the reason for why it was not working for Sage 5 and 6 was apparently never found.

This is correct and expected behaviour:

```
sage: G=FreeGroup(2)
sage: G.inject_variables()                                                                                                                          
sage: H=G.quotient([x0*x1^2])                                                                                                                       
sage: H.as_permutation_group()
Defining x0, x1
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-2-2fcc9750489e> in <module>()
      2 G.inject_variables()
      3 H=G.quotient([x0*x1**Integer(2)])
----> 4 H.as_permutation_group()

/home/vit/bin/sage-dev/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/groups/finitely_presented.pyc in as_permutation_group(self, limit)
   1008                 coset_table = self.gap().CosetTable(trivial_subgroup).sage()
   1009             except ValueError:
-> 1010                 raise ValueError('Coset enumeration exceeded limit, is the group finite?')
   1011         from sage.combinat.permutation import Permutation
   1012         from sage.groups.perm_gps.permgroup import PermutationGroup

ValueError: Coset enumeration exceeded limit, is the group finite?
```

But the problem persists in some form as the following (real life) example shows.

```
sage: k = 3
sage: p = 18
sage: d = 2*p/(p-6)
sage: l = 2*p*k/(p*k-2*k-2*p)
sage: F.<J,P,R1,R2> = FreeGroup()
sage: G = F / [J^3, P^(3*d), R1^p, R2^p, (F([-2,1]))^k, (F([4,3,1]))^l, F([-4,2,3,-2]), F([-4,1,3,-1]), F([-2,3,4])]
sage: k = G.rewriting_system()
sage: x = k.reduce(P^8)
sage: y = k.reduce(G([-4,2,3]))
sage: t = k.reduce(x*y)
sage: t == G.one()
gap: cannot extend the workspace any more!
vit@HP-EliteBook-8460p:~/bin/sage-dev$ 
```

Sage should gracefully recover from errors and crashes of external libraries. (Moreover, the notebook interface doesn't give you any clue as to what went wrong. In this case you don't even know that it was GAP who caused the crash.)

But checking for equality in a finitely presented group can still lead to the error described here. 


```

k = G.rewriting_system()
x = k.reduce(P^8)
y = k.reduce(G([-4,2,3]))
t = k.reduce(x*y)
t == G.one()
```

<a id='comment:14'></a>It seems that I get a segmentation fault, which is to be expected. But at least it's caught by cysignals and raised as a Python exception and everything seems to recover fine. So I think that's what we want here? I'm not sure that there's a better solution.

<a id='comment:17'></a>With gappy this example results in:

```
GAPError: Error, reached the pre-set memory limit
(change it with the -o command line option)
```

But there is not actually a way to change the pre-set memory limit through the libgap/gappy interface.  Of course, this needs to be done before initializing the GAP interpreter.

But according to the GAP docs for `-o`:

> If more than this amount is required during the GAP session, GAP prints an error message and enters a break loop. In that case you can enter return; which implicitly doubles the amount given with this option.


Apparently this doesn't happen with libgap/gappy since they do not enter the break loop.  I'll have to figure out where exactly in GAP this is implemented and see if we can reproduce that functionality.  I think it should just happen automatically, but with a warning.

I still think maybe we could catch this specific error and reproduce it as a warning (cypari2 does something similar when it needs to extend PARI's workspace).
