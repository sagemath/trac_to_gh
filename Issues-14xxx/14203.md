This patch puts `DOCTEST_MODE` in `sage/doctest/__init__.py`. It also removes it entirely from `sage/plot/plot.py`, since it wasn't used there at all. Should we leave it there for backwards compatibility with optional/experimental packages and third party code?

At some point, we might do the same with `EMBEDDED_MODE`, but this will also require patches to sagenb, and therefore is more annoying.

We need a combined `lazy_import`/`deprecate` for this situation.  :-)

Where would `EMBEDDED_MODE` move to?

And rename `EMBEDDED_MODE` to `HTML_MODE` or something else which describes the usage better.

And `EMBEDDED_MODE` is actually independently defined in 6 different modules:

```
devel/sagenb/sagenb/misc/support.py
devel/sage/sage/misc/pager.py
devel/sage/sage/misc/sageinspect.py
devel/sage/sage/misc/latex.py
devel/sage/sage/plot/plot.py
devel/sage/sage/server/support.py
```

Is `NOTEBOOK_MODE` a good name?

Maybe we should import it from `sagenb.misc.support` for now, and then rename it later. Or we could do this once somewhere in the Sage library:

```python
try:
    from sagenb.misc.support import NOTEBOOK_MODE
except ImportError:
    from sagenb.misc.support import EMBEDDED_MODE as NOTEBOOK_MODE
```
Then there can be an independent sagenb patch eventually.
