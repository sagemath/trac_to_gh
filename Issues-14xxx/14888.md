Ticket #12142 implements an interface to PARI's t_FFELT type for finite fields, which is much faster than the one currently used by Sage, in which finite field elements are PARI objects like `Mod(Mod(1, 3)*a, Mod(1, 3)*a^17 + Mod(2, 3)*a + Mod(1, 3))`.  The attached patch makes the new implementation the default for those finite fields that currently use the slow PARI implementation, namely those of cardinality *p<sup>n</sup>* with *p* > 2 prime, *n* > 1 and *p<sup>n</sup>* > 2<sup>16</sup>.

The actual switch is just a trivial change in the `FiniteField` constructor.  The only other real addition is construction of `Integer` from `t_FFELT`; the rest of the patch fixes doctests.  Almost all fixes are for doctests that assumed `FiniteField_elt_pari` to be the default.  One somewhat notable point is that certain finite elements now compare differently (see the changed doctest in `polynomial_zz_pex.py`).  This is because `gcmp_sage` (in `sage/libs/pari/misc.h`) compares all non-real PARI types via their string representations.  With the new `FiniteFieldElement_pari_ffelt`, string comparison gives the same result as lexicographic comparison of polynomials expressing finite field elements in terms of the chosen generator, which is nice.

The first problem is in the following code:

```
        elif isinstance(x, int) or isinstance(x, long):
            g = (<pari_gen>self._parent._gen_pari).g
            sig_on()
            x_GEN = stoi(x)
            self.construct(INT_to_FFELT(g, x_GEN))
```
The Python `long` type doesn't convert to a C `long` (confusingly, a C `long` corresponds to a Python `int`).

To see the problem on 64 bits (let this inspire a doctest):

```
sage: GF(7^20, 'a')(long(2^63))

```
ret = ret + c

where ret is a `pari_ffelt` element equal to zero, `c` is the C `long` equal to 2. The result is 0, while it should be 2.

I wondered about the same line yesterday evening when I was looking at the surrounding function, but thought that it hardly looked like something that could fail with some small probability.  Does this line always give the wrong result (and for some reason just isn't called most of the time)?

I noticed that c is defined by `cdef int c` (i.e. C int, not Python int), but is later used as a long; is that something to be suspicious about?

If not, then (since `c` is wrapped into a Python `int` before being added to `ret`) it must be the conversion from Python `int` to `pari_ffelt` that is causing the problem, but in that case it is strange that it only fails here.

No, it *rarely* gives the wrong result.

It's not the cleanest coding (`c = <int>napGetCoeff(z)` would be better), but I don't see how that could make a difference, especially since this doesn't seem to be a case of overflow.

> it must be the conversion from Python `int` to `pari_ffelt` that is causing the problem

I also guess that this is the problem.

In the line `ret = ret + c`, could you replace `c` by `base(c)` to do the coercion explicitly, just to make sure it isn't some quirk in the coercion system?  Or insert a line verifying that `c == base(c)` to test directly whether it is the conversion that is at fault?

Here is one more guess: in `sage/rings/finite_rings/element_pari_ffelt.pyx` the Python int `x` is first converted into a PARI t_INT as follows (lines 209-210):

```
pari_catch_sig_on()
x_GEN = (<pari_gen>pari(x)).g
```
The order of these two lines should be interchanged.

Before #15125, the second line was `x_GEN = stoi(x)`; here `pari_catch_sig_on()` must be called first since we call the un-wrapped PARI function.  However, now we call `pari(x)`, which does its own `pari_catch_sig_on()...pari_catch_sig_off()`.  As we know, the current error-handling code is non-reentrant.  I don't see exactly how this could cause our bug, but maybe my imagination is too limited.

There is a similar mistake in the `__pow__` method in the same file.

I agree that is a mistake, but on the other hand, we are not handling any errors here, so the non-reentrant error handling code isn't called. So that cannot explain the problem.

With that change, I no longer get the error (which unfortunately doesn't imply that the bug is fixed).

Mysterious.  I checked that the coercion system does exactly the same thing internally, as it should (convert the Python int `c` to `pari_ffelt` and then add this to `ret` in `base`), so there is no other intermediate conversion that could go wrong.

How did you check? I think it's more and more likely that the coercion system is the problem here, because

1) The coercion system is notorious for generating hard-to-reproduce bugs since it relies on (hashes of) memory addresses.

2) Making the conversions explicit (see diff below) fixes the problem.

I did the following (and I agree that this doesn't prove that the coercion always goes like this):

```
sage: F.<a>=FiniteField(7^20)
sage: from sage.structure.coerce import CoercionModel_cache_maps
sage: cm=CoercionModel_cache_maps()
sage: cm.explain(a,int(0))
Coercion on right operand via
    Conversion map:
      From: Set of Python objects of type 'int'
      To:   Finite Field in a of size 7^20
Arithmetic performed after coercions.
Result lives in Finite Field in a of size 7^20
Finite Field in a of size 7^20
```

Got it! The following line is no good:

```
x_GEN = (<pari_gen>pari(x)).g
```
Python can destroy the object `pari(x)` because there are no references to it (the pointer `x_GEN` doesn't count as a reference for Python's garbage collecting).

Beautiful!  I checked the C code generated by Cython and it does indeed decrease the reference count of this temporary object too early.

I have never been able to reproduce the bug, but I'm convinced that you nailed the problem.  I'll run doctests and then give this a positive review.
