<div id="comment:2" align="right">comment:2</div>

Can you give an example of where this would be useful? Are you trying to construct symbolic functions where the custom methods are compiled (hence have no `func_code` attribute)?

This patch causes problems in the way we detect if a new symbolic function is being created:

```
sage: f = function('f', evalf_func=Graph.wiener_index)
sage: f(5)
f(5)
sage: f(5).n()
TypeError: unbound method wiener_index() must be called with Graph instance as first argument (got ComplexNumber instance instead)
sage: f = function('f', evalf_func=Expression.is_one) 
sage: f(5).n()                                       
TypeError: unbound method wiener_index() must be called with Graph instance as first argument (got ComplexNumber instance instead)
```

Note that the second error message still refers to `wiener_index()`.

The documentation for `SymbolicFunction` states:

```
    This is the basis for user defined symbolic functions. We try to pickle or
    hash the custom methods, so subclasses must be defined in Python not Cython.
```

So using compiled (Cython) methods for the custom evaluation methods is not supported. If you describe your application we can think about a different solution.
