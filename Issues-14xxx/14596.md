Package all optional PARI databases (except `galdata` which is standard and including in Sage's PARI spkg).

A little harder would be to catch cases where the default installation fails to compute some `ellap()` and output a helpful message to the user suggesting that installing this additional package would be a good idea.

We may as well I suppose, though elldata is another 33MB and only duplicates (partially) our own optional database.  However, why should someone not be able to use a fully functional gp with all extras from Sage?  Let's do it.  In the first instance, let's just make the spkg and make no changes at all to the Sage library.

I think this is too complicated.  Only seadata and elldata are of any size, and they are not that big, and this will be optional.

re PS: no, we should avoid functions which only work when Sage is running on an online machine.  It could hardly be simpler than

```
sage: install_package("pari-optional-packages")
```

Since this is an optional spkg, I'd not rely on `SAGE_SRC` (and `SAGE_SHARE`, which you don't use [yet]) being defined, both being relatively new, but use `${SAGE_SRC:-${SAGE_ROOT}/devel/sage}` etc. instead, or do

```sh
[[ -z "$SAGE_SRC" ]] && SAGE_SRC="${SAGE_ROOT}/devel/sage"

[[ -z "$SAGE_SHARE" ]] && SAGE_SHARE="${SAGE_LOCAL}/share"
```

(Then I'd use `"${SAGE_SHARE}/pari/" as the destination directory.)

I'd also rather use `gp` in `spkg-check`, or do some simpler sanity check on the installed files.

Why verbose?  Especially the combination seems weird.\n\n(Hopefully the doctesting framework doesn't parse the `--long` into a number of threads, don't know.)\n\nIf installing it with `SAGE_CHECK=yes` (probably not specifically set for that installation) requires the Sage library (or likewise, perhaps `gp`), you can't (successfully) install it in advance.\n\nIMHO unnecessary pitfalls.",

Well, why use `-p`?  Why verbose?  Especially the combination seems weird.

(Hopefully the doctesting framework doesn't parse the `--long` into a number of threads, don't know.)

If installing it with `SAGE_CHECK=yes` (probably not specifically set for that installation) requires the Sage library (or likewise, perhaps `gp`), you can't (successfully) install it in advance.

IMHO unnecessary pitfalls.

Sure, and it **should** fail in such a case.

<a id='comment:18'></a>Replying to [comment:16 leif]:

Because I expect

```
env SAGE_CHECK=yes MAKE="make -j20" ./sage -i database_pari
```
to use 20 threads, both for installing (which is pointless for this spkg) and for testing.

> Why verbose?

Because one test takes an annoyingly long time (about 2 minutes), and with `--verbose` you will at least see something happening, at least the message "# long time" should be seen. But I can certainly change this if it means positive_review.

> Hopefully the doctesting framework doesn't parse the `--long` into a number of threads

No, it doesn't.

> If installing it with `SAGE_CHECK=yes` requires the Sage library (or likewise, perhaps `gp`), you can't (successfully) install it in advance.

Another true statement... many optional packages cannot be installed "in advance", so why would this be a problem?

All tests pass, and I also tested installing the spkg with SAGE_CHECK=yes, and doctesting the patched file before and after installing the spkg.  Positive review.

Perhaps you can send me the file `logs/install.log` so I can have a look for a possible explanation.
