Yoooooooooooooo !

> Hi, i do not like the need to fetch a file from the internet to let this work. My question for a future ticket is the following: if i understand correctly, `src/ext` is a kind of place where we put external source code that is not big enough to deserve a package, am i right ? In this case, is this the right place to copy the file d3.v3.min.js for offline use ?

HMmmmmmm.... I am interested by Volker's answer, but I would say that stuff in src/ should be reviewed... Sooooooo no third-party code should be there. Besides, it is very easy to write spkg now with git. 

This being said, I do not know which files we are allowed to read at runtime...
