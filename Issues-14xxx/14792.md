The current build mechanism unconditionally deletes `build/pkgs/$packagename/src`. This should be triggered manually (or upon package update).

* it's impossible to install twice or create packages without recompilation
* creating/editing/testing patches is irksome without the source code
* it's impossible to use packages that don't copy/move to $SAGE_LOCAL (future?)

Fixing this requires
* rename `src` to `src-$version` (or something equivalent), to avoid confusion
* keep track of the patch state (don't try to patch twice)
* ... ?

In Sage right now, you can set the variable `SAGE_KEEP_BUILD_SPKGS` to not delete the temporary build directories.

I see your point about space consumption. Maybe it should be switched on with some sort of `developer mode`, or just if .git is present.

Exactly, that's why i have created the ticket. Rebuilding, installing or exporting packages should not require manual intervention (nor recompilation).

SAGE_KEEP_BUIL**T**_SPKGS that is...

Another odd thing is that you can't just test an spkg (after it's been built / installed) even if you kept its build directory [other than by starting a Sage subshell, changing to the directory and running `./spkg-check`].

And rerunning (parts of) `spkg-install` is usually also an adventure.

You speak in mysteries to me. But I will do as you suggested and close the ticket.
