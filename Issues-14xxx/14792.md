```
The current build mechanism unconditionally deletes `build/pkgs/$packagename/src`. This should be triggered manually (or upon package update).

* it's impossible to install twice or create packages without recompilation
* creating/editing/testing patches is irksome without the source code
* it's impossible to use packages that don't copy/move to $SAGE_LOCAL (future?)

Fixing this requires
* rename `src` to `src-$version` (or something equivalent), to avoid confusion
* keep track of the patch state (don't try to patch twice)
* ... ?

In Sage right now, you can set the variable `SAGE_KEEP_BUILD_SPKGS` to not delete the temporary build directories. For an individual spkg installation, you can also do `sage -i -s blah.spkg`: the `-s` flag says to save (keep) the build directory. Note that keeping all of the build directories can take up a lot of disk space, so it is not a good idea to turn it on by default.

(This also doesn't quite do what you want: if you install an spkg once and then again, it will start over from scratch. You can manually change to the build directory, though, and do whatever recompilation or reinstallation you need.)

These features are documented in [the installation guide](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/installation/source.html#environment-variables).

I see your point about space consumption. Maybe it should be switched on with some sort of `developer mode`, or just if .git is present.

SAGE_KEEP_BUIL**T**_SPKGS that is...

Another odd thing is that you can't just test an spkg (after it's been built / installed) even if you kept its build directory [other than by starting a Sage subshell, changing to the directory and running `./spkg-check`].

And rerunning (parts of) `spkg-install` is usually also an adventure.

You speak in mysteries to me. But I will do as you suggested and close the ticket.
