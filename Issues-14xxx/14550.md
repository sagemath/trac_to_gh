As discussed in this sage-devel thread

https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/sage-devel/ZvN_rtDavnk

I wrote a tutorial for German school teachers on gymnasium level on how they could use Sage to do the calculations they need for math on this level. 

The attached patch creates a section called "thematische anleitungen" in the German documentations, similar to the "thematic tutorials" in the English documentation.

I've started to look at it briefly. The first issue is, that as far as I know no images are allowed. They bloat the already largish Sage codebase by something which can be replicated at any time. I don't know the best solution w/ regards of â for example â the interactive help, but it's certainly example possible to include the plotting command as an example without showing the plot.

Do we meanwhile have a spell- and grammar checker plug-in as well? ;-)

<div id="comment:15" align="right">Comment 15</div>

> (MÃ¼sste jetzt in meinen Notizen graben;  OTOH: Definitiv *wenige* Typos, aber z.B. "Zahlen -> Ziffern", inkonsistentes "[Gg]raf*" vs. "[Gg]raph*", und paar inhaltliche Sachen...)
