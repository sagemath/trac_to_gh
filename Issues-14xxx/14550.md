As discussed in this sage-devel thread

https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/sage-devel/ZvN_rtDavnk

I wrote a tutorial for German school teachers on gymnasium level on how they could use Sage to do the calculations they need for math on this level. 

The attached patch creates a section called "thematische anleitungen" in the German documentations, similar to the "thematic tutorials" in the English documentation.

I've started to look at it briefly. The first issue is, that as far as I know no images are allowed. They bloat the already largish Sage codebase by something which can be replicated at any time. I don't know the best solution w/ regards of – for example – the interactive help, but it's certainly example possible to include the plotting command as an example without showing the plot.

Ok, removed the pictures again. I just included them today because there were some part that were hard to understand without visualisation. But of course this works without the pictures, also it's not the best solution as long as the document isn't accessible in a interactive mode.

I thought since there are thematic tutorials in the English documentation containing pictures, this should be fine.

Do we meanwhile have a spell- and grammar checker plug-in as well? ;-)
