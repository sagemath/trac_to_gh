I wrote a tutorial for German school teachers on gymnasium level on how they could use Sage to do the calculations they need for math on this level. 

The attached patch creates a section called "thematische anleitungen" in the German documentations, similar to the "thematic tutorials" in the English documentation.

Ok, removed the pictures again. I just included them today because there were some part that were hard to understand without visualisation. But of course this works without the pictures, also it's not the best solution as long as the document isn't accessible in a interactive mode.

I thought since there are thematic tutorials in the English documentation containing pictures, this should be fine.

?  That thread refers to patchbot testing.

Do we meanwhile have a spell- and grammar checker plug-in as well? ;-)
