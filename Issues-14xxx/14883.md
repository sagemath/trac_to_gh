See the attached patch which, I hope, speaks for itself. I don't see any reason why that permutation had to be multiplied by an identity permutation. I thought it might have been meant to coerce the permutation into a larger symmetric group or to avoid some corner-case bugs, but this doesn't seem to be an issue (cf. the doctests I added). Also, notice that `OrderedSetPartitions` class does already check for the set and the composition to be of the same size, whereas the un-exported `OrderedSetPartitions_scomp` class throws various errors if they aren't (both before and after my patch). The patch has a minor but nontrivial effect on speed:

```
sage: timeit("list(OrderedSetPartitions([1,2,3,4,5],[3,2]))")
```
now takes 6.75 rather than 7.67 ms.
