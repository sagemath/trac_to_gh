In several spkgs we use a SAGE_TUNE_<spkg> variable to enable/disable (potentially) long tuning, but this is not documented in the installation guide.

Affected spkgs:
* gf2x -- supports "yes" (meaning "quick", the default), "no" and "full"
* PARI -- supports "yes" and "no" (default)

---

The ATLAS spkg has a similar mechanism, but [ab]uses (e.g.) `SAGE_ATLAS_ARCH=base` and `SAGE_ATLAS_ARCH=fast`, which in contrast is already documented.
