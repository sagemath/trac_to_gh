The second patch replaces the first, but there does not appear to be a way to do that if one forgets to click "replace patch with the same name" when submitting the patch initially.

Edit: The third patch is the  latest one. It would be nice to be able to remove the first two.

Hi Arthur,

I just did a trivial rebase of your patch in the queue: it did not apply on all.py due to the addition of CrystalOfProjectedLevelZeroLSPaths yesterday.

By the way: there is no reason to import CrystalOfAlcovePathsElement in the global name space. So I removed that. Also your patch removes the former ClassicalCrystalOfAlcovePaths. This is good since the new version is more general; however a deprecation link should inserted.

See: http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/coding_in_python.html#deprecation

Cheers,
                                       Nicolas

Hi Arthur,

Thanks for your patch on alcove paths. Here are some further comments that would be good to incorporate!

- Please specify what the default value of `good_zero_arrows` is. Do you want to merge this experimental code into main sage, or rather separate it out into a personal patch that can be used by yourself and your collaborators (and me :-) )?

- "Littlewood paths" in the documentation of sage.combinat.crystals.alcove_path.CrystalOfAlcovePaths should be "Littelmann paths"

- "We verify the alcove path crystal with the LS path crystal" should probably be "We verify that the alcove path crystal is isomorphic to the LS path crystal".

- The interface for the LS paths has changed and now the preferred way is to input an actual weight rather than the coefficients of the fundamental weights. The advantage is that weights are typed whereas a list of coefficients is not. Do you think you could have a look at LS paths and make the user interface for Alcove paths consistent with it? I think this would be good for the users!

- Since you mention Demazure 0-arrows in your documentation, please define what they are!

- For the method `vertices` please explain how you compute all crystal elements without the crystal operators (since you say that they cannot all be reached by crystal operators; so you must have an alternative way!).

- For the method :meth:`digraph_fast` perhaps give an example of how the speed compares to the usual digraph method and max_depth setting. You can do this with %timeit for example.

- Why is the method static sign(root) in alcove paths and not in root_systems? The same question holds for max_level.

- Typo in :meth:`words`:  "finte Cartan types" -> "finite Cartan types"

- Please explain the inputs of sage.combinat.crystals.alcove_path.compare_graphs(g1, g2, node1, node2).

- I get some doctest failures:

Would it then permanently live \n    at the very bottom of the queue? Or just something available in\n    private (which may be easier to implement).\n\n  - The interface for the LS paths has changed and now the preferred way is\n  to input an actual weight rather than the coefficients of the fundamental\n  weights. The advantage is that weights are typed whereas a list of\n  coefficients is not. Do you think you could have a look at LS paths and\n  make the user interface for Alcove paths consistent with it? I think this\n  would be good for the users!\n   \n    Still need to do this part.  It's a bit tricky and I don't have much\n    time at the moment.  When I find some time...  I guess in order to\n    stay compatible with the old ClassicalCrystalOfAlcovePaths code I have\n    to do the same implementation as the LS paths code, instead of just\n    changing the parameters by hand. \n\n  - Why is the method static sign(root) in alcove paths and not in\n  root_systems? The same question holds for max_level.\n\n    root_systems already has a is_positive_root method, sign is just\n    something convenient for my purposes.

Hi Anne,

    If it's not mentioned below, I addressed it in the new patch on combinat queue.

- Do you want to merge this experimental code into main sage, or
  rather separate it out into a personal patch that can be used by yourself and your collaborators (and me :-) )?

    A patch would probably be ideal. Would it then permanently live 
    at the very bottom of the queue? Or just something available in
    private (which may be easier to implement).

  - The interface for the LS paths has changed and now the preferred way is
  to input an actual weight rather than the coefficients of the fundamental
  weights. The advantage is that weights are typed whereas a list of
  coefficients is not. Do you think you could have a look at LS paths and
  make the user interface for Alcove paths consistent with it? I think this
  would be good for the users!
   
    Still need to do this part.  It's a bit tricky and I don't have much
    time at the moment.  When I find some time...  I guess in order to
    stay compatible with the old ClassicalCrystalOfAlcovePaths code I have
    to do the same implementation as the LS paths code, instead of just
    changing the parameters by hand. 

  - Why is the method static sign(root) in alcove paths and not in
  root_systems? The same question holds for max_level.

    root_systems already has a is_positive_root method, sign is just
    something convenient for my purposes. Should I rename it to _sign?
    max_level is something specific to the alcove model. Can be renamed to
    _max_level. Since that is part of a private class
    (doesn't get imported into sage) I don't see the point.


    FYI, On line 284, TestSuite(C).run() (in the affine case( is now
    taking around 150sec, which it didn't used to (I added a #long time). 
    Not sure why this is happening.

Arthur

Look at `__classcall_private__` line 121 in littelmann_path.py and `__init__` line 158. That allows both inputs and hence you would stay compatible with the old code!

Ok, then please make them underscore methods!

Yes, I noticed that for me the code also took a long time to run! Perhaps some profiling would be a good idea to see what is taking up so much time.

Hi Anne, 

    I've removed the 'good_zero_arrows' option, as requested.  
    It may be easiest to put back in once sage moves to git, so I
    would rather do that.  

    The interface is changed to that of LS paths, using the 
    'preferred way'.

    Requested methods are now private.

    I've briefly ran a profiler on TestSuite(C).run() (now line 277).
    It seems to be calling the usual processor intensive methods more
    than before.  Perhaps it is searching deeper in this affine
    crystal?  This may or may not be related, but doc testing for LS
    paths code is also taking quite a bit longer than before. 
                                                                                                    
    I've pushed the changes to combinat, but didn't make a patch.
    This ticket already has too many patches ( my fault ).

thanks
Arthur

Hi Arthur, again,

Also, you mentioned that CrystalOfAlcovePath now has the same entries as LittelmannPath. However, you did not change the documentation of the input to reflect this. Could you please do so? Also, you will need to add some examples such as

```
    sage: R = RootSystem(['A',2])
    sage: P = R.weight_lattice()
    sage: La = P.fundamental_weights()
    sage: CrystalOfAlcovePaths(La[1])
    Highest weight crystal of alcove paths of type ['A', 2] and weight Lambda[1]
    sage: C = CrystalOfAlcovePaths(La[1])
    sage: B = CrystalOfAlcovePaths(['A',2],[1,0])
    sage: B==C
    True
```

Is the following really the correct behavior? Do you want alcove paths crystal labeled by level zero weights to be highest weight crystals?

```
sage: R = RootSystem(['A',2,1])
sage: P = R.weight_lattice()
sage: La = P.fundamental_weights()
sage: C = CrystalOfAlcovePaths(La[1]-La[0])
sage: C
Highest weight crystal of alcove paths of type ['A', 2, 1] and weight -Lambda[0] + Lambda[1]
```

Hi Anne,

    I mostly fixed the patch header.  I'm not sure how to add the Node
    Id to the header (It should be automatic, but it's not working for 
me. I'm using the hgrc from
    http://wiki.sagemath.org/combinat/MercurialStepByStep )

    Patch is updated on trac server.

    You are correct.  I only want dominant integral weights.  It  
    should now raise a ValueError.  Some examples of LS paths style
    inputs are added as requested.  Please let me know if more are needed.

    I also replaced the word level with height as was suggested by you 
    some time ago, as level has another meaning, (as in LevelZeroLSpaths)

The header looks ok to me now. I usually do

```
hg qrefresh -e
```
and then edit the header to put the line #14143. Then you need to do

```
hg export trac_14143.... /home/arthur/trac_14143...
```
where ... stands for the rest of the name and then upload to trac.

I will look at your changes more closely soon and will report back if I find anything else.

Greetings from Tel Aviv,

There are problems with the documentation:

```

```

I also recommend you to use the new doctest continuations (`....:` instead of `...`), as follows:

```
sage: for e in g.edges():  # long time 
....:     if e[0].phi(0) == 1 and e[2] == 0:
....:         g.delete_edge(e)
```

Hi Arthur,

Did you actually fold my review patch? Looking at the patch I still see some issues with the documentation that I had fixed in the review patch I had posted on the sage-combinat queue.

Hi Anne, 

       You are correct.  Even though I folded your patch, I mistakenly
       discarded the changes afterwards.  My apologies!  The latest
       version of the patch has your changes applied.

Arthur
