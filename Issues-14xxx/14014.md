Does it handle GAP's BlockMatrix ? This would allow a seamless interface between Sage's sparse matrices and GAP, as BlockMatrix
can be used as a sparse matrix:

```
gap> n:=10^16;
10000000000000000
gap> a:=BlockMatrix([[1,2,[[5]]]],n,n);
<block matrix of dimensions (10000000000000000*1)x(10000000000000000*1)>

I started to look at `sage/groups/libgap_wrapper.pyx`, and wonder what the following two lines would do:

```
sage: G.<a,b> =FreeGroup()
sage: G
Free Group on generators {a, b}
```
there was a doctest like this, marked `"# indirect doctest"`, but it's removed by this patch. Shouldn't one just remove the

Can we have a bit longer explanation of what happens on this ticket. Do matrix groups get libGAP as the default backend, while the old one remains available as `G.gap()` ?

Is it assumed in libGAP that GAP long integers are GMP/MPIR integers? For there is the following comment in the patch, in `sage/libs/gap/element.pyx`, lines 1150-2:

```
 An immediate integer is one that is stored as a C integer, and 
 is subject to the usual size limits. Larger integers are 
 stored in GAP as GMP integers.
```


Or it actually just calls the appropriate GAP long integer functions?
Note that GAP itself allows for different  long integer backends, e.g. it has its own implementation of them, used exclusively before version 4.5, although Sage does not use this.

Whatever it is, it should be possible to discover without reading the full source.

Something I don't get happens in `sage/groups/matrix_gps/orthogonal.py`.
You changed docstring to say

```
The general orthogonal group `GO(n,R)` consists of all orthogonal 
 `n\times n` matrices over the ring `R`.
```
but it doesn't always work, as for finite fileds it's still the same GAP backend:

```
sage: GO(6,GF(3))
...
ValueError: must have e=-1 or e=1 for even degree
```

IMHO, speaking about `the orthogonal group over a ring` is not right. Generally speaking one would have lots of inequivalent bilinear scalar products to choose from, leading to different groups. Even in physics, where the Lorenz group is an example of this...

In fact, the behaviour of even dimension orthogonal groups over a field is not so special in the finite field case. This is just a manifestation of the fact that there are two Dynkin diagrams (or Lie algebras) giving such groups, namely B_n (you get e=-1) and D_n (you get e=1).

This is the `_repr_` doctests, which previously was incorrectly
labelled as indirect doctest. In fact, it just showed the output that
was generated in a derived class. I replaced it with an explict
doctest that actually tests `ParentLibGAP._repr_`.

My goal is to replace the GAP interface with LibGAP everywhere. During the transition the `gap()` method will return the wrapped object, which may be in the GAP interface or in LibGAP. 

### [comment:15](#comment%3A15)

I just want to allow the GMP backend for long integers, I don't think
we gain anything from trying to support the old home-grown one. Though
at this point you can still use both, the conversion from long
integers to Sage is done via strings. But I'd like to change that in
the future and directly access the GMP limbs.

The libgap before this ticket doesn't handle long its correctly
because I didn't understand what GAP docs mean by "immediate
integers". This is why I wrote the explanatory comment.

### [comment:16](#comment%3A16)

That file has been renamed to just `morphism.py`, if you have all
patches you might have to run `sage -sync-build`

### [comment:17](#comment%3A17)

I agree that there is no unique bilinear scalar form, though I would
call **the** orthogonal group (in absence of any further qualifiers)
over a ring the one with the standard (identity matrix) bilinear
form. In particular since the orthogonal groups for other bilinear
forms have sometimes other names, as you said. The next paragraph
explains how the notation for finite fields differ, so I think thats
clear enough:

```
The general orthogonal group `GO(n,R)` consists of all orthogonal 
`n\times n` matrices over the ring `R`.  

In the case of a finite field and if the degree `n` is even, then 
there are two inequivalent quadratic forms and a third parameter 
``e`` must be specified to disambiguate these two possibilities. 
```
My aim was to start the docstring with a friendly
paragraph that says what GO/SO is before hitting the user with the finite
field technicalities.

Actually, it's not even correct to talk about bilinear forms; one should talk about quadratic forms, 
in case you do not want to exclude the case of fields of characteristic 2 (it's more or less a coincidence that
in other characteristics the automorphisms of the associate bilinear form coincide with the (linear) automorphisms of the quadratic form. 

As well, in characteristic 2 orthogonal matrices have little to do with orthogonal groups; indeed they fix the quadratic form `f(X)=<X,X>`, but this form is (sesqu)linear, i.e. `f(aX+bY)=<aX+bY,aX+bY>=a^2 <X,X>+b^2<Y,Y>+2<aX,bY>= a<sup>2<X,X>+b</sup>2<Y,Y>`, and this is not a one one cares much about. The ones which are interesting cannot even be diagonalized.

And what happens for rings in general is much more mysterious, even for ZZ. I don't know much about this topic, but number theorists might start pulling their hairs out upon reading this part; already binary quadratic forms over ZZ are a big topic.

One has to start with a correct paragraph (see above). It's also strange to see that 'in case of finite fields' clarification. Orthogonal groups over fields are a family of classical groups, which are the same as the D_n and B_n groups "of Lie type". And for the latter there will be two different groups for n even, something like this. Another way to talk about them is to talk about automorphism groups of nondegenerate quadratic forms, and for each class of equivalent forms one will have its "own" orthogonal group.

No luck on the comment 16 problem. I just built 5.9.beta1, installed the  libgap spkg from #14323, and applied the patches from #14187 and from this ticket, did `sage -synch-build` and `sage -b `and still have the same failure on `sage/groups/matrix_gps/morphism.py`.
I have 

```
dima@arando:~/sage/sage-5.9.beta1/devel/sage$ hg qapp
trac_14187_lazy_import_test.patch
trac_14187_lazy_everywhere.patch

trac_14014_deletions.patch
trac_14014_parents_for_matrix_groups.patch
trac_14014_parents_group_dependents.patch
```
and `libgap-4.5.7.p2` from #14323. (It's on arando from the buildbot, by the way).

Updated patch fixes the problem from [comment:16](#comment%3A16), which hides behind a `# long time`.

Hey Volker,

With some of the patches merged in `5.10.beta4` (I'm pretty sure it's #4327), the patchbot is saying there is a (trivial) doctest failure in `root_lattice_realization.py`. It should be because the order of the group elements changed.

Also in `groups/matrix_gps/catalog.py`, could you give the file a proper title line (the first docstring line) in case at some point we include the file in the documentation?

Volker, do you remember what other tests were non-trivial changes? I'm cc-ing Sebastien Labbe since the quantumino code was originally written by him.

Thanks,

Travis

Volker, a few more things on the patch.

* `matrix_gps/pickling_overrides.py` is missing a doctest for the last `__setstate__()`.
* Would it be possible to not import `libs.gap*` at startup?
* (more trivial), could you change the line continuation on line 260 of `matrix_gps/finitely_generated.py` to the new `....:`?

Thanks,

Replying to [vbraun](#comment%3A34):
> Only very few are non-trivial (like the quantumino one)


I checked the patch fixing non-trivial doctest for the quantumino code, and it is ok. The ordering of the matrices changed the ordering of rotated copies of polyominos, which changed the ordering of the rows passed to the dlx solver, which explains the doctest update for the list of rows indices (a solution is given as a subset of rows).

>, and there the corresponding Sage module already does checks. Has anybody ever verified by hand that the quantumino puzzle has 5484 distinct solutions?


The related doctest is the following one :

```
    sage: q = QuantuminoSolver(0)
    sage: T = q.tiling_solver()
    sage: rows = T.rows()                            # not tested (10 s)
    sage: len(rows)                                  # not tested (but fast)
    5484
```

This is not the number of solutions. 5484 is the number of rows (of a matrix) given to the dlx solver. The number of solutions of the Quantumino game when one block is chosen aside is counted in the order of `10^9`. On my machine I estimated the following line to take one month :

```
    sage: T.number_of_solutions()
```

I never run it enough time to get the result...
