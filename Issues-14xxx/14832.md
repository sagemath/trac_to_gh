Currently, every finite field implementation (integers mod *p*, Givaro, NTL, PARI) has its own code for constructing an irreducible polynomial when given a string as the `modulus` keyword.  This ticket does the following:

- implement a new class `PolynomialRing_dense_finite_field`
- create methods `PolynomialRing_dense_{finite_field,mod_p}.irreducible_element(n, algorithm=None)`.

In a separate ticket (#14833), the `FiniteField` constructor is adapted to call the new function.

The default choice is now deterministic: Conway polynomials if available, otherwise lexicographically first (via NTL/GF2E) in characteristic 2, Adleman-Lenstra (via PARI) in characteristic > 2.

Since it uses PARI's `ffinit`, this depends on #14818.

Is there any reason for removing the implementation arg to the PR_field constructor?
I agree it's not used, but maybe at some point :)

And why not test in the PR_field constructor if the field is finite and call the new constructor in that case?

By the way, I'm not sure using is_FiniteField is the right way to check for finite fields.
Using the category framework and doing something like "R in FiniteFields()" is surely better unless you really rely on implementation details of the FiniteField class and subclasses.

You also need to use two consecutive colons to introduce examples:

```
EXAMPLES::

    sage: 1+1

```
or

EXAMPLES:

We check that 1+1 is equal to 2::

I think it is better to be conservative with the `implementation` parameter: allow it for the generic `PolynomialRing` constructor and pass it to subclasses that actually have different implementations, but do not add (or keep) the flag in subclasses where it does not do anything.

I did not introduce this way of checking for finite fields; I just moved it to a more specific `__init__` method.  Having said that, I wouldn't agree that using the category framework here is a good thing.

First, a finite field might be in different categories (e.g. `FiniteFields` or the future category of subfields of an algebraic closure of **F**<sub>*p*</sub> that we were discussing at #8335); probably the polynomial ring constructor shouldn't have to care about that.

Second, one reason to have different implementations of `PolynomialRing` *is* so that we can take advantage of implementation details of (subclasses of) `FiniteField`.  There already is an implementation for polynomials over NTL finite fields; similarly, for PARI finite fields it would be desirable to have an implementation for polynomials over those fields.  (I have some code that is much slower than necessary because it uses PARI finite field elements but NTL polynomials over the same finite fields.)

I'd say that a subfield of an algebraic closure would be in the category of finite fields and the new one, just as it is as well in that of integral domains. 
> Second, one reason to have different implementations of `PolynomialRing` *is* so that we can take advantage of implementation details of (subclasses of) `FiniteField`.  There already is an implementation for polynomials over NTL finite fields; similarly, for PARI finite fields it would be desirable to have an implementation for polynomials over those fields.  (I have some code that is much slower than necessary because it uses PARI finite field elements but NTL polynomials over the same finite fields.)

I agree, but I don't think the test performed by is_FiniteField is to ensure implementations details, but really the fact that the robject represents a finite field.

Anyway, as you pointed out you just moved the test  so let's keep this for later.

If you fix the doc, I'll happily positive review that.
