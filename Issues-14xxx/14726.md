Assignee: felixs

CC:  @jondo

Keywords: build system, c_lib, gsoc

this patch implements a gnu build system for c_lib. no existing files are touched.
IT is indended to be merged into the git transition repo.

the glue code at toplevel is under construction. but if desired, it may be possible to hook it into the current static toplevel makefile.

(this build system might finally be merged with the python module build system. this is currently not necessary and would just complicate things due to the directory structure.)

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/14726

Felix, if you buy a new harddrive, would you mind also buying a new shift key?

(I'd also appreciate that for the news groups posts, at least the longer ones.)

Good idea.

this is included within the "WIP" branch at git://github.com/felix-salfelder/sage.git.

I think for distributions != sage, it should already be possible to build all parts of sagelib at once. there's a "build system" at the root of sagelib (i.e. src), which is meant to put together the pieces (currently just AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS). if you feel adventurous, please have a look.

`make dist`. if it doesnt work, it should in the end.

not that currently, the build system for the python part is missing (#14834), i'll push it as soon as I have a functional alpha.

what exactly do you disagree with? are packages that are required for development `standard` packages?

what would be the problem with development requiring autotools (alternatives?).

> Autotools are meant to be used by package maintainers, not by end users.


no. autotools is meant to be used by developers only, and that's the whole point. (and yes, not by end users).

what is a `normal` developer? do you imply that a package maintainer is a different sort of developer?

usually (in my world?) no package maintainer will ever want to tinker with a build system (or other source code) if she doesn't have to. unlike make, autotools is written/designed exclusively for developers.

so clearly, 1. and 2. need to be exchanged, if a `normal` developer is a developer (?). 

are we lost in terminology? it doesn't really look that complicated... Look out for the term `software development person` and `developer` in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_build_system#Usage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_build_system#Usage).

yes. you shouldn't. and that should be achievable.

you will of course need autotools to expand the build system, if you don't start with a dist tarball or anything similar. is building-from-git (as opposed to building-from-tarball) not considered a development task?
