This ticket does the following:

1. The current version of itensor (the Kronecker product on the ring of symmetric function) only works when the ground ring is an algebra over the rationals. This is not a mathematically reasonable restriction. Fix this.

2. The Kronecker coproduct on the ring of symmetric function has to be implemented. Implement it.

3. The antipode on the ring of symmetric functions uses coercion into the powersum basis. This means it, too, is not getting computed over arbitrary base rings. Fix this.

4. The forgotten basis of Symm is defined by duality rather than by explicit formulas. Our duality methods use the powersum basis, again leading to errors for ground rings not being QQ-algebras.

5. The Witt symmetric functions form another basis of Symm. Implement them.

6. Implement Frobenius and Verschiebung operations on Symm without recourse to plethysm.

3 is done. Anyone has a better name than `degree_negation` for the algebra automorphism of ``SymmetricFunctions`` which acts as 1 in even degrees and 0 in odd ones?

The changes in the antipode method not only made it work over any rings, but also sped it up on each basis except for the powersum one (and the monomial one, but I improved that with a trivial fix):

Test suite:

```
def testall():
    Sym = SymmetricFunctions(QQ)
    print "m"
    timeit("SymmetricFunctions(QQ).m()([4,3,2]).antipode()")
    print "h"
    timeit("SymmetricFunctions(QQ).h()([4,3,2]).antipode()")
    print "e"
    timeit("SymmetricFunctions(QQ).e()([4,3,2]).antipode()")
    print "s"
    timeit("SymmetricFunctions(QQ).s()([4,3,2]).antipode()")
    print "p"
    timeit("SymmetricFunctions(QQ).p()([4,3,2]).antipode()")
```

Results:

```
original version:

sage: testall()
m
125 loops, best of 3: 1.86 ms per loop
h
25 loops, best of 3: 10.8 ms per loop
e
25 loops, best of 3: 10.8 ms per loop
s
25 loops, best of 3: 30.6 ms per loop
p
625 loops, best of 3: 146 µs per loop

after change of generic antipode to go via omega rather than via coercion to powersum basis:

sage: testall()
m
125 loops, best of 3: 2.16 ms per loop
h
125 loops, best of 3: 2.92 ms per loop
e
125 loops, best of 3: 2.92 ms per loop
s
625 loops, best of 3: 250 µs per loop
p
625 loops, best of 3: 148 µs per loop

after microoptimization in the antipode of powersum (replacing (-1)**blah by case distinction):

sage: testall()             
m
125 loops, best of 3: 1.79 ms per loop
h
125 loops, best of 3: 2.88 ms per loop
e
125 loops, best of 3: 2.95 ms per loop
s
625 loops, best of 3: 252 µs per loop
p
625 loops, best of 3: 113 µs per loop

I've attached two files which show some timings for conversions from and to f. The times over a base ring which is a QQ-algebra have become a tad worse, although probably not significantly (what are our criteria for that?). The times over a base ring which is a QQ-algebra differ significantly from those over a base ring which is not, although not in a sufficiently consistent way for me to prefer one method over the other.\n\nIn other news, this patch has profited much from input by Nicolas Thiery, Mike Zabrocki, Florent Hivert and Simon King.

Attachment [forgotten-speed-reg2](tarball://root/attachments/some-uuid/ticket14775/forgotten-speed-reg2) by @darijgr created at 2013-06-21 15:09:59

New version up, with forgotten functions working over every base ring. I've attached two files which show some timings for conversions from and to f. The times over a base ring which is a QQ-algebra have become a tad worse, although probably not significantly (what are our criteria for that?). The times over a base ring which is a QQ-algebra differ significantly from those over a base ring which is not, although not in a sufficiently consistent way for me to prefer one method over the other.

In other news, this patch has profited much from input by Nicolas Thiery, Mike Zabrocki, Florent Hivert and Simon King. Thank you!

Only practice will tell, and you'll probably be the one putting this
most to practice; I'd say don't cache for now, and see later if
you need it.

And at some point in the future we would want a mechanism that would
allow the user to specify which caches he want to use for his own
preferred application.

Go ahead. For most classical basis, Symmetrica provides a direct
conversion, and when there is one the coercion system is not as stupid
as using his depth first search :-)

In any case, if something would need to be fixed, it's the coercion
system, not the usage of coercions as above.

Cheers,
                              Nicolas

It's fun how s(w) is quickest with the e-coercion but the advantage disappears when all three coercions are on (because it doesn't know where to go)...

Hey Darij,

Here's a review patch which is basically just formatting changes and compacts the implementation of `degree_negation()`. If you're happy with my changes, you can set this to positive review.

Best,

Hey Darij,

Sorry I didn't get back to you yesterday. I don't like the phrasing you used (and canonical to me means there is a clear/special reason why this basis is "better" than the others). How about something like

1 - "there is no natural choice for a basis",

2 - "there are multiple natural bases"?

Looking at the arithmetic product (which should go here I think), I have some suggestions:

- The math equation on line 2842, could you set it in a `.. MATH::` block?
- I think the OUTPUT block should be a sentence (it really just needs to be capitalized and have a period).
- Remove the `else` on line 2929 since it makes the code more clear (at least to me since the function ends on the same indent level it started at; and do the de-indent of course).
- Remove some of the comments, in particular the ones describing the variables in the for loops since they are cluttering up the code IMO.

Last, could you fold all of the patches into a single patch? This will make it easier for me to do the final review.

Thank you,

Travis

Here's a new version of my tweak patch which builds the pdf:

```
Build finished.  The built documents can be found in /home/travis/sage-5.11.rc0/devel/sage/doc/output/pdf/en/reference/combinat

Darij, unfortunately `\lcm` and `\gcd` are actually not standard latex commands (as counter-intuitive as it is).

It seems like there is something special happening for negative numbers / 1 / -1:

```
sage: %timeit (-1)**1000
1000000 loops, best of 3: 993 ns per loop
sage: %timeit (-1)**2000                    
100000 loops, best of 3: 968 ns per loop
sage: %timeit (-1)**5000
1000000 loops, best of 3: 924 ns per loop
sage: %timeit (-1)**10000
100000 loops, best of 3: 881 ns per loop
```
It probably is doing an if/then via modulus for "large" powers. So having it as `(-1)**x` is faster. Good caveat to know.

I agree that we should avoid doing the sum twice, but it's faster to store it as a variable instead of a lambda function:

```
sage: y = lambda a: 5
sage: %timeit y(2)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 770 ns per loop
sage: %timeit x = 5; x
1000000 loops, best of 3: 336 ns per loop
```

Any doc typos are my fault from copy/pasting.

Thanks for the comments Mike.

Best,

Travis

Done. Someone (Mike? Travis?) should take a look at this as I've been making a lot of manual whitespace changes and who knows whether they're really all whitespace. ;)

The threshhold is easy: anything that is not purely a trailing-whitespace change. Fixing typos is good, rewriting docstrings is good, changing non-trailing whitespace (in a [PEP-8](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) compliant way) is good.

I seem to recall that the git workflow will ignore trailing spaces anyway, so the "problem" will disappear anyway.
