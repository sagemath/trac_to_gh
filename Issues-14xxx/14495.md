In the developer's guide, in `conventions.rst`, it says

```
      Any words after ``# optional`` are
      interpreted as a list of package names, separated by spaces.
      Any punctuation (periods, commas, hyphens, semicolons, ...)
      after the first word ends the list of packages.
      Hyphens or colons between the word ``optional`` and the first
      package name are allowed.
      Also, all text is converted to lower case.
```
So the case-insensitivity is mentioned, but could be emphasized more.
