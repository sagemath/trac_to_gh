In [Ask Sage question 691](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/691/subticks-in-2d-plot#3839),
the very reasonable question of controlling subticks was asked.
Meanwhile, Mark Edgington has implemented this!

Here is a description, from the Ask Sage question and answer,
of the new functionality:

> Here's an example which should achieve what was sought after
> by the questioner (except that minor ticks are smaller than
> major ticks, which may not have been desired):
> 
> ```
> var('x')
> p = plot(5*sin(x/10)*sin(x), (x, 0, 20*pi))
> p.show(ticks=[[0, 5*pi, 10*pi, 15*pi, 20*pi], 5],
>        minor_ticks=pi, tick_formatter="latex")
> ```
> If the `minor_ticks` option is not specified, then minor-tick
> behavior will follow previous Sage defaults. If the option is
> specified, then the following examples describe the behavior:
> - `minor_ticks=None`, or `=[None, None]` -- no minor ticks
>   will appear on either x or y axes
> - `minor_ticks=3` -- minor ticks every 3 units on x axis;
>   Sage defaults on y axis
> - `minor_ticks=[3, None]` -- minor ticks every 3 units
>   on x axis; none on y axis
> - `minor_ticks=[3, [2, 7]]` -- minor ticks every 3 units
>   on x axis; at 2 and 7 on y axis

This was made available, as based on Sage 5.10,
on [bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/edgimar/sage-main/compare#diff).

A branch would be needed, with doctests.
Some of the stuff on that branch is
also [for other issues](https://bitbucket.org/edgimar/sage-main/commits/8f2d381fae7eb0e8de92ecab9f12f4b1d3ef951e) like #8478.

The bitbucket repo is gone,
but [archived at Software Heritage](https://archive.softwareheritage.org/browse/origin/directory/?origin_url=https://bitbucket.org/edgimar/sage-main).

Not sure if this is really relevant for this specific ticket.
The following code can be used to get some control about the appearance of the major or minor ticks: 

```
import matplotlib
from pylab import figure, show
matplotlib.rcParams.update({'xtick.major.size':4})   #length
matplotlib.rcParams.update({'ytick.major.size':4})   #length
matplotlib.rcParams.update({'xtick.minor.size':2})   #length
matplotlib.rcParams.update({'ytick.minor.size':0})   #length 0 = no minor ticks on y-axis
matplotlib.rcParams.update({'lines.markeredgewidth':2})  #width of ticks
matplotlib.rcParams.update({'lines.markersize':6})       #size of ticks
```

However, implementing fine grained control, may be beyond the scope of this ticket. 

Currently (Sage 9.2)   `None` is used if the major ticks on an axis are NOT changed. If ticks should not be shown this is used: `ticks=[[],[]])`
Note that this is different from what is proposed in the description of this ticket for minor_ticks.
