All of the instances I found were for problems that we never expect to arise (out of memory errors, etc).  So I don't see a reasonable way to doctest these exceptions.

I know.  :-)  I told Julian you didn't like them, but he claimed it was okay since we raised after catching in each case.  Anyway, I've changed them to `except BaseException:`.

<a id='comment:20'></a>For the record, the Python docs say

    exception BaseException

    The base class for all built-in exceptions. It is not meant to be directly 
    inherited by user-defined classes (for that, use Exception).

Nested exception blocks are generally hard to read, quadruply nested exception try/except/finally blocks even more so. Besides the usual advice of breaking long functions up into shorter ones, for the heap cleanup in the face of exceptions make sure that invalid / not yet allocated pointers are NULL. To simplify the cleanup part, `free(NULL)` is a no-op.

The `for i from 0 <= i <= n` construct is old, Cython nowadays produces the same C code for the (preferred) Python syntax `for i in range(n)`.

I had a look at the code and the current code actually is never going to work. The C-level functions like `fmpz_poly_init` and `mpz_init` never raise exceptions. So, the `try`/`except` is pointless. As far as I can tell, there are two kinds of exceptions which can happen: a `MemoryError` in MPIR or a `KeyboardInterrupt`. In both cases, the exception will be raised by `sig_on()` and none of the `except` blocks are executed.

If you want to be absolutely correct, every single allocation should be wrapped individually in `sig_on()`/`sig_off()`. Example for 2 allocations:

```
sig_on()
alloc1()
sig_off()

try:
    sig_on()
    alloc2()
    sig_off()
except BaseException:
    free1()
    raise
```

But at least the very deeply nested block on this ticket is allocating extremely little memory (surely less than 1000 bytes), so why not simply

```
alloc1()
alloc2()
```

Not directly, as far as I know. You can do

```
cdef extern from *:
    ctypedef int volatile_int "volatile int"
