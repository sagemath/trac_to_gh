There is invalid use of `sig_on()` in many places. The following is wrong:

```
sig_on()
if condition:
    raise Exception
sig_off()
```
You must put a `sig_off()` before the `raise` (or use `try`/`finally`).

I also recommend to doctest these exceptions. The doctesting framework catches such invalid use of `sig_on()`.

I also don't like bare `except:` statements. Be explicit and use `except BaseException:` or `except Exception:` instead.

For the record, the Python docs say

    exception BaseException

    The base class for all built-in exceptions. It is not meant to be directly 
    inherited by user-defined classes (for that, use Exception).

Nested exception blocks are generally hard to read, quadruply nested exception try/except/finally blocks even more so. Besides the usual advice of breaking long functions up into shorter ones, for the heap cleanup in the face of exceptions make sure that invalid / not yet allocated pointers are NULL. To simplify the cleanup part, `free(NULL)` is a no-op.

Yes, they will and Sage will crash, or at least could.
On Linux you can set _MALLOC_CHECK=3 to ensure (or have a higher probability) it will crash in such cases.

So, does anyone have suggestions on how to rewrite the ugly nested try blocks in `PowComputer_flint_unram.__cinit__`?  Julian and I couldn't think of a better way to do it that would never have a memory leak or a double free.

I had a look at the code and the current code actually is never going to work. The C-level functions like `fmpz_poly_init` and `mpz_init` never raise exceptions. So, the `try`/`except` is pointless. As far as I can tell, there are two kinds of exceptions which can happen: a `MemoryError` in MPIR or a `KeyboardInterrupt`. In both cases, the exception will be raised by `sig_on()` and none of the `except` blocks are executed.

If you want to be absolutely correct, every single allocation should be wrapped individually in `sig_on()`/`sig_off()`. Example for 2 allocations:

```
sig_on()
alloc1()
sig_off()

try:
    sig_on()
    alloc2()
    sig_off()
except BaseException:
    free1()
    raise
```

But at least the very deeply nested block on this ticket is allocating extremely little memory (surely less than 1000 bytes), so why not simply

```
alloc1()
alloc2()
```

```python

I guess that can still be broken by creative reordering of the pointer initialization, so to be 100% safe one would need to split the setting to NULL from the `fmpz_init` either by  
1. a compiler barrier (`asm volatile("" ::: "memory")` in gcc) 
2. move the `fmpz_init` into `__init__`
3. RAII (separate classes for each `fmpz_poly_t`)

Just a few technical comments (I don't plan to formally review this):
1. You don't need to add `include_dirs = [SAGE_INC + '/flint']` (just add `flint/` to the path to the `.h` files)
2. You don't need to add `__richcmp__` calling `_richcmp`
3. You don't need to add `__hash__` which just raises `TypeError`: all `Element`s are now unhashable by default.
4. For consistency with other `.pxd` files, could you move all declarations of FLINT types to `sage/libs/flint/types.pxd`?
5. In this block

```
            try:
                padic_ctx_init(self.ctx, self.fprime, 0, prec_cap, PADIC_SERIES)
            except:
                mpz_clear(self.top_power)
                raise
```
given that `padic_ctx_init` is a C function, how could it ever raise a Python exception? Moreover, I find it bad style to use `except:`, you should be more explicit and catch `except BaseException:` instead (the reason I say this is because most people write `except:` by mistake).
