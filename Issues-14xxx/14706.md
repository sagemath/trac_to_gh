* **Status** changed from *new* to *needs_review*

1) New spkg : available on Google drive (https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B1gfn4_V_wm3clctVFFhUnlINVU/edit?usp=sharing)

2) What this ticket is about :

a) Having an up-to-date R is a sine qua non to get answers from R Core.

b) R in Sage is rarely up to date (more talented Sage developers work on more important issues).

c) Therefore, R-in-Sage users have trouble communicating with R Core

d) I am able to create "drop-in replacements" of the R spkg, thus giving R-in-Sage users an up-to-date R, thus allowing them to get answers from R Core...

e) Since this is routine work that few people seem to tackle, and since it is in my limited ability range, I'll try to do it after R upstream upgrades.

Is that clearer ?

Why not just say "Upgrade R to version 3.0.1" like leif said?

For the spkg, I really need a URL to the spkg, not some link to some website where I have to click on something...

Also: fill in your real name as Author.

Because I intend to re-open/re-close it as upstream  spits out new versions... I see no point in cluttering the ticket stream with identical repeats of the same trivial point...

There's a lot of redundant stuff in different src directories:

```sh
$ diff -qr --report r-3.0.1-p0/src/src/ r-3.0.1-p0/src/R-3.0.1/src/ | grep identical | wc -l
1502

Wups ! Done (and uploaded)... I oversaw the relevant part of the developer's guide (had to upload Mercurial : this can't be done from Sage AFAICT).

No explanation : R-3.0.1 is  a tag larger than R-2.15.2 but by about 2 MB. Your guess is about as good as mine...

if test "${with_readline+set}" = set; then :
  withval=$with_readline; if test "${withval}" = no; then
  use_readline=no

Ok, this is IMHO rather unrelated to R, or more precisely, a general problem, caused by **ap**pending `$SAGE_LOCAL/lib` to `LIBRARY_PATH` instead of prepending, so I'll open a separate ticket for that.

Or maybe not (just).  Dropping `-L${SAGE_LOCAL}/lib` and abusing `LIBRARY_PATH` simply doesn't work, since GCC may add system folders to the library search path **before** those specified in `LIBRARY_PATH`.

It's rather luck that the error so far showed up on CentOS only; others appear to have either no or compatible readline versions installed system-wide.

Can you create a `.p1` and test that on Cygwin?

(Interestingly, the patches still apply, modulo offsets for the patch to `configure`, which IMHO aren't worth fixing, since that just bloats Mercurial history).

And if so, also change `--with-readline=...` to `--with-readline=yes`, with a remark that only yes/no is supported.

Yes, Cygwin libm has no long double functions.
>  For R, we currently just rename `logl()`, so using `--disable-long-double` may have other impacts I don't know...

That's the point, we want to disable all uses of long double in R, I cannot say that the only place it is currently used in 3.0.1 is with this logl() call, nor if that will be the case in future version of R.
So using --disable-long-double is safer.
Or we should reenable Cephes on Cygwin to provide long double functions but I cannot say if that will be easy or not.

That was my question (whether doing so was intended; the basic operations on long doubles are provided by GCC / libgcc) ... ;-)

Messing around with the dynamic library mechanism does not seem to be such a great idea.  The 3.0.1.p1 patch gives (on Debian amd64 testing) an executable which is unable to install some packages using external libraries ( among them tcl/tk, curl, sqlite3 and more important, cpp libraries). I had oddles of trouble trying to install packages depending on RcppArmadillo. Reverting to the 3.0.1.p0 patch solved this problem.

I'd be sorely tempted to change the status to "needs work" ... if I knew how to do this.

I'd like to recommend :

1. to keep the (simple) fix to get the 3.0.1 sources (which, AFAIU, compile fine on Unices and Mac OS X) and leave the dynamic library gizmoes alone, and
2. to open ***another*** ticket for the dynamic library issues, which, if I understand the history, aim to compile this cleanly on cygwin.

That's really strange.

The difference between the p0 and the p1 has nothing to do with *LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
It merely triggers an upstream compilation option on Cygwin only.
Not on any other OS (unless uname on that os contains CYGWIN which would be strange outside of Cygwin).
Just have a look at [attachment:r-3.0.1.p1.diff](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket14706/r-3.0.1.p1.diff)...

Nor has the diff between the p0 and the previous 2.* R version.

The *LD_LIBRARY_PATH comes from $SAGE_ROOT/spkg/bin/sage-env (or $SAGE_LOCAL, too lazy to check) or R itself, not from the spkg scripts.
If you're not convinced, just grep them.

Currently R doesn't build on sage.math, dying with 

```
../../lib/libR.so: undefined reference to `rl_sort_completion_matches'
```
Can we clean this ticket up? 

Just a few comments from cursory reading this ticket:

* Delete anything that can interfere with installation at the beginning of `spkg-install` (yes one could try to catch errors, but we don't have a framework for testing that so it won't ever work)

* try to mess with library paths as little as possible.

* Cygwin issues can go to a different ticket.

<a id='comment:80'></a>
What was done in this ticket was really trivial.
Basically:
* drop in replacement of the upstram sources,
* a trivial fix for the Cygwin fixes (basically using the now upstream provided option rather than our custon patch + add an upstream patch not in the current stable version to fix the new upstream option; this has really no reason to affect any other systems than Cygwin unless it makes your computer proner to attracting gamma rays) so I don't see any reason not to keep them in.

So if R is now broken, its surely because of some hell with *LDLIBRARY_PATH either on Sage sideor on R side itself (as R seems to be as bad as Sage as far as hacking LDLIBRARY_PATH is concerned).

I agree that cleaning up the spkg-install would be a good idea as well.

Also note that R 3.0.2 was released a few days ago, so maybe the patch fixing the disable_long-double option is now included.

I've updated a trivially updated spkg, could you give it a shot?
And post or link the failing log?

It doesn't seem the failing line you mentioned changed.
(Note that the line I get is slightly different, I don't get the -lRblas.)
Before that line at least, on my install, when libR.so is built, -lreadline is correctly passed, so maybe this changed for 3.0.2.

At this point, I changed nothing to deal with a potentially conflicting old version of R 2.x as mentioned earlier on this ticket.

Same behavior for me on sage.math on top of 5.12.rc1 (with Sage's GCC built) with the provided 2.x spkg and the new 3.0.2 one.
Still no -lRblas and no error.
So I cannot do much about Volker's problem without further info...

I guess this is at the root of the "-lRblas" you get and I don't.
What version of ATLAS or BLAS did you use?
Not sure it will then lead us to the readline problem.

In the working case, when libR.so is built the gcc command includes:

```
-L/home/jpflori/build/sage.git/local/lib -lf77blas -latlas -lgfortran -lm -lquadmath   -lreadline  -lrt -ldl -lm
```
whereas in the other case it includes:

```
-L../../lib -lRblas -lgfortran -lm -lquadmath   -lreadline  -lrt -ldl -lm
```
The "-L" stuff is here because it is passed through --with-blas to configure, and I guess gets dropped and replace in the latter case because R does not like the systm wide ATLAS.

Now what's strange is that we pass --with-readline="$SAGE_LOCAL" to configure but it does not seem to care about the location we give it.

I guess the real problem on OS X is that as shown above, R does not modify DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH, but rather DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH through etc/ldpaths in R.sh, whereas Sage modifies directly DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH.
See

```
## We already added -L's from LDFLAGS (except on Darwin): 
## seem to be doing it again
for arg in ${LDFLAGS} ${FLIBS} ${BLAS_LIBS} ${LAPACK_LIBS} ${X_LIBS} \
           ${TCLTK_LIBS}; do
  case "${arg}" in
    -L*)
      lib=`echo ${arg} | sed "s/^-L//"`
      r_want_lib=true
      ## don't add anything for Darwin
      case "${host_os}" in darwin*) r_want_lib=false ;; esac
      ## Do not add non-existent directories.
      test -d "${lib}" || r_want_lib=false
      if test x"${r_want_lib}" = xtrue; then
        ## Canonicalize (/usr/lib/gcc-lib/i486-linux/3.3.4/../../..).
        lib=`cd "${lib}" && ${GETWD}`
        ## Do not add something twice, or default paths.
        r_save_IFS="${IFS}"; IFS="${PATH_SEPARATOR}"
        for dir in ${R_LD_LIBRARY_PATH}${IFS}${r_ld_library_defaults}; do
          if test x"${dir}" = x"${lib}"; then
            r_want_lib=false
            break
          fi
        done
        IFS="${r_save_IFS}"
        if test x"${r_want_lib}" = xtrue; then
          R_SH_VAR_ADD(R_LD_LIBRARY_PATH, [${lib}], [${PATH_SEPARATOR}])
        fi
      fi
      ;;
  esac
done
fi
```
at the end of configure.ac.

So when R is not installed, at installation time, when R is run, no libR.dylib is found in DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH, but it is in the FALLBACK variant.
But when R is already installed, then libR.dylib is found in DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH and that's potentially a wrong version...

I guess you actually tried to update from R 2.x to R 3.x and not a build from scratch with the spkg replaced?

So you might give a positive review as the OS X issue was the only thing which made this go from positive_review back to needs_work?

Hopefully, I fixed the problem.
The Matrix module wants to use the gettext dngettext function.
On usual system this is provided by the system libc or the system libintl.
On Solaris the system libintl does not provide it so R decides to build its own libintl (in src/extra/intl) but with symbols hidden by default (-fvisibility-hidden) and only publicize a few of them, but not dngettext.
So I treated that last function as the few others one already visible.

spkg at same address.
diff updated.

Anyone familiar with `R` building system around?
I tried this, and got weird stuff:

note that linker is called twice, once with `-o latticeSHLIB_EXT`, and then with `-o .so` !? wtf...
I can only speculate that the generation of `SHLIB_EXT` is still broken and injects unprintable chars into the string, which leads to the linking command executed twice.

it turns out that `SHLIB_EXT` is set up in more than 1 place in `install.R`. So this workaround has to be done for all these places to work right. 

I've opened a new ticket with the patch. See #15762.
