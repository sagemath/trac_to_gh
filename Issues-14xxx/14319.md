DUBIOUS ? Come on, it has no meaning whatsoever. Other than what "domain" returns.

Why don't you just add some lines to the constructor of `Permutation` ? You could just write `p = Permutation(your_permutation_group_element)`. That would have a meaning.

What would a `.list()` function do in `PermutationGroupElement` otherwise ? Hell, what does `.tuple()` do there too ? It's not like `tuple(a.domain())` is so long that it needs a function of its own `O_o`

Sure, I take the blame for not spotting this and suggesting something
different back then.

> DUBIOUS ? Come on, it has no meaning whatsoever. Other than what "domain" returns.

Yes it does! When the domain is 1...n it gives you the permutation in
the usual list notation, which is a basic feature! And otherwise it
still shows how the elements of the domain are permuted which is a
worthwhile information; it does not seem ridiculous to me to do:

```
sage: for sigma in SymmetricGroup(['a','b','c']): print sigma.list()
['a', 'b', 'c']
['a', 'c', 'b']
['b', 'a', 'c']
['b', 'c', 'a']
['c', 'a', 'b']
['c', 'b', 'a']
```

If there is something to be contested it's that self.domain() returns
the domain with its elements permuted; I would just return the domain
of the parent (like other functions do in Sage).

I understand that this information is useful in this case, the scope of `PermutationGroupElement` is much larger than that.

Isn't that machine-dependent when domain is a set ?

No objection to that.

What would be the problem of a `.to_permutation` method (the findstat guys would love that) which would output the permutation of `1...n` corresponding to the element ? When the domain is not 1...n they could be relabeled "in any way" (i.e. the ordering of `.domain()`) to return a permutation of 1...n, and when the domain IS 1...n then it could return the list that you expect ?

Or you could also implement something in the constructor of `Permutation` which would do the same, what do you think ?

Why the hell do we have both `Permutation` and `PermutationGroupElement` by the way ?

At first, it sounded like if `p` was a permutation group element, then `p.domain()` would just give me back the original domain of the permutation group, and `p.list()` would do what it has done in the past---a list representation of the permutation (exactly what nthiery describes).  Even after reading the patch, I had to double-check that domain actually did permute the domain, because it sounds like it shouldn't to me.

Put another way: to me, it's confusing that `p.parent().domain()` and `p.domain()` return different lists.

How are `p.parent().domain()` and `p.domain()` different ? If it is only the order, there is nothing wrong in that. Those things are morally "sets", and only returned as tuples/lists for efficiency reasons I guess.
