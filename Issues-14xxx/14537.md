The following code leads to a TypeError:

```
sage: F.<a> = GF(4)
sage: f = F.Hom(F).identity()
sage: g = F.hom([a])
sage: h = (g*f)
sage: f*h
...
TypeError: right (=Composite map:
  From: Finite Field in a of size 2^2
  To:   Finite Field in a of size 2^2
  Defn:   Identity endomorphism of Finite Field in a of size 2^2
        then
          Ring endomorphism of Finite Field in a of size 2^2
          Defn: a |--> a) must be a morphism to multiply it by Identity endomorphism of Finite Field in a of size 2^2
```

The problem is solved by relaxing the type checking in the multiplication procedure to accept Maps and not only Morphisms
