Salut!

Great idea. And very natural once you think about it.

I don't think this should be activated by default though. For simple
product rules, or when there is a cache on the product on basis, this
most likely induces a regression. On the other hand, this suggests
that it should be possible to easily configure at least to options for
products in an algebra with basis:

- Whether to cache the product on the basis
- Whether to use parallelism

There just remains to find and implement a good idiom :-)

On a technical note: it might be better to move the implementation of
the `@`parallel-decorated method outside of the body of the methods to
avoid recreating them each time. I am not sure as well of the logic to
handle _multiply_on_basis (but that could be an occasion to finally
deprecate it).

Cheers,
                           Nicolas
