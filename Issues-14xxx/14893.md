<div id="comment:0"></div>

At the moment, the following code

```
    R.<x>=PolynomialRing(Qp(2));
    P=2*x^2+1;
    K.<a>=P.root_field();
```
returns a univariate polynomial quotient ring object. It should return a p-adic field object, consistently with the case of `root_field` for polynomials over QQ and number fields.
