At the moment, the following code

```
    R.<x>=PolynomialRing(Qp(2));
    P=2*x^2+1;
    K.<a>=P.root_field();
```
returns a univariate polynomial quotient ring object. It should return a p-adic field object, consistently with the case of `root_field` for polynomials over QQ and number fields.

When trying to run this example, we get the following:

```
ValueError: negative valuation
```

This error occurs in the calling of `extension` by `root_field`. At the moment, there is no implementation of extensions for polynomials with coefficients of negative valuation. (See #20073: the polynomial gets divided by its leading coefficient if it's not monic.)
