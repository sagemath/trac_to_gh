As of now, passing a list, tuple, or set to `cartesian_product` returns an AssertionError.


```
sage: cartesian_product([[0,1]])
AssertionError: 
sage: cartesian_product([FiniteEnumeratedSet([0,1])])  
The cartesian product of ({0, 1},)
```

I understand that this function can construct Cartesian products on different categories, so I see why it requires specific types. However, the error message should be more descriptive, especially considering that `cartesian_product_iterator([This is the Trac macro *0,1* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#0,1-macro))`, `CartesianProduct([0,1])`, and `permutations([This is the Trac macro *0,1* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#0,1-macro))` all work.

Hello,

I propose to close this one as duplicate since with #18411 tuple/list input are automatically converted into `FiniteEnumeratedSet` and set/frozenset converted to `Set`

```
sage: C = cartesian_product([[1,2], (3,4), set([1,2,3]), frozenset([1,2])])
The cartesian product of ({1, 2}, {3, 4}, {1, 2, 3}, {1, 2})
sage: for c in C.cartesian_factors():
....:     print c.__class__.__name__
FiniteEnumeratedSet_with_category
FiniteEnumeratedSet_with_category
Set_object_enumerated_with_category
Set_object_enumerated_with_category
```
