<a id='comment:5'>**Comment 5:**</a>
It would make much more sense if the messages were printed *at the end* of (the whole) docbuilding; just restoring the previous code means they now appear even more "in the middle" (between messages for other parts of the documentation). 

FWIW, the locations hardly ever change anyway.
