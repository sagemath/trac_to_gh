When cloning Sage (eg: for combinat), the doc is copied but not properly:
Before the clone in `doc/output/html/en/reference/numerical` there is a symlink `_static` to `../_static`. After the clone, it is an empty directory. Also the directories such as

```
doc/en/reference/algebras/sage
doc/en/reference/calculus/sage
...
```
are note copied at all.
