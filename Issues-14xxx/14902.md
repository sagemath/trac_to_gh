(Duplicate of #12188)

The following returns the right thing in the end, but exhibits a problem with calling Singular in the process:

```
sage: K.<t> = FunctionField(QQ)
sage: A.<x,y> = PolynomialRing(K, 2)
sage: B = A.quotient(y^2 + (t + 1)*x*y + t*y - x^3 - t*x^2)
sage: B.gens()
verbose 0 (3490: multi_polynomial_ideal.py, groebner_basis) Warning: falling back to very slow toy implementation.
singular_ring_delete(ring*) called with NULL pointer.
  File "/home/staff/pbruin/src/sage-5.11.beta3/local/bin/sage-ipython", line 18, in <module>
    app.start()
...
  File "/home/staff/pbruin/src/sage-5.11.beta3/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_ideal.py", line 910, in _groebner_strategy
    return GroebnerStrategy(MPolynomialIdeal(self.ring(), self.groebner_basis()))
Exception KeyError: (The ring pointer 0x0,) in 'sage.libs.singular.ring.singular_ring_delete' ignored
(xbar, ybar)
```
Probably Gr√∂bner bases shouldn't even be invoked in this example, but that is another question.
