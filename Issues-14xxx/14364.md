This script would be better in the sage-scripts spkg, as it's sage-specific, probably as sage-testjava.sh or some such. The change will break one doctest in devel/sage/sage/interfaces/jmoldata.py, where it is looking for it using the full path.

I would argue the move is only appropriate if any other package in Sage depends on java.  To my knowledge, nothing in the base install other than Jmol does.

[ping]

Is there anything to test beyond (re)installing the spkg and testing `src/sage/interfaces/jmoldata.py`?

If not, works for me...

Ok, I was finally able to test, and it works.

I think reinstalling the spkg won't do the trick for a review, because you'll still have testjava.sh from the previous installation (sage-as-a-distribution doesn't have uninstallation if I don't err). And you'll also need to recompile the sagelib since one of the files has been modified.

The fix for this ticket is two patches:
* one to detect java directly in sagelib ;
* the other to remove testjava.sh from the build/pkgs/jmol/ data.

If they go in, doesn't it update things (in particular the spkg) correctly and automatically?
