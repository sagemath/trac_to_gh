This script would be better in the sage-scripts spkg, as it's sage-specific, probably as sage-testjava.sh or some such. The change will break one doctest in devel/sage/sage/interfaces/jmoldata.py, where it is looking for it using the full path.

I would argue the move is only appropriate if any other package in Sage depends on java.  To my knowledge, nothing in the base install other than Jmol does.

Is there anything to test beyond (re)installing the spkg and testing `src/sage/interfaces/jmoldata.py`?

If not, works for me...

Ok, I was finally able to test, and it works.

I think reinstalling the spkg won't do the trick for a review, because you'll still have testjava.sh from the previous installation (sage-as-a-distribution doesn't have uninstallation if I don't err). And you'll also need to recompile the sagelib since one of the files has been modified.

The fix for this ticket is two patches:
* one to detect java directly in sagelib ;
* the other to remove testjava.sh from the build/pkgs/jmol/ data.

If they go in, doesn't it update things (in particular the spkg) correctly and automatically?
