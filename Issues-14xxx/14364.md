This script would be better in the sage-scripts spkg, as it's sage-specific, probably as sage-testjava.sh or some such. The change will break one doctest in devel/sage/sage/interfaces/jmoldata.py, where it is looking for it using the full path.

The fix for this ticket is two patches:
* one to detect java directly in sagelib ;
* the other to remove testjava.sh from the build/pkgs/jmol/ data.

If they go in, doesn't it update things (in particular the spkg) correctly and automatically?
