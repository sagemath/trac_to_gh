As noted [on sage-support](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/sage-support/e0FQYUZnDMw), the installation guide claims that the SageTeX documentation is in `SAGE_ROOT/local/share/texmf/tex/generic/sagetex`, but it is actually in `SAGE_ROOT/local/share/doc/sagetex`.

Also, it may be appropriate to install the `example.tex` file into that doc directory, instead of the texmf directory. 

*Apply:* attachment:trac_14246.patch and include the new spkg: http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/drake/code/sage/st/sagetex-2.3.4.spkg.

Hmm, there are two PDFs -- `sagetex.pdf` and `example.pdf`. But `example.tex` should be the only thing duplicated.

Okay, I'll check again.  I can't believe it was added so quickly!

Okay, you were right on that, but there is however something additional - namely, the checksum.  Do other spkgs come with their own checksum?  I don't believe so.  (That is what confused my computer, I think.)

That's what I meant.  No pdfs in the texmf directory, so only one *additional* document, as you said.  I guess I should have so "any additional pdfs".

The only change in the spkg should be that `setup.py` also installs example.tex into the "doc" directory, and an entry in SPKG.txt.

I know that there's a bunch of ancient cruft in there that should get cleaned up but perhaps we'll do that in another ticket.
