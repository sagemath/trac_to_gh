As noted [on sage-support](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/sage-support/e0FQYUZnDMw), the installation guide claims that the SageTeX documentation is in `SAGE_ROOT/local/share/texmf/tex/generic/sagetex`, but it is actually in `SAGE_ROOT/local/share/doc/sagetex`.

Also, it may be appropriate to install the `example.tex` file into that doc directory, instead of the texmf directory.

The spkg seems to have an spkg inside it, or at least a directory, and also has a `.DS_Store` file at the top level.  Did you create this correctly?

The patch is fine, and bitbucket corresponds to this, and the 20K is no problem - you didn't include any pdfs! - so otherwise this is ready to go.

I just downloaded the linked spkg and did `tar tjvf sagetex-2.3.4.spkg | grep DS` and it returns nothing. So that file is from you, most likely. Also, when I unpack it, I get a regular directory structure.

> The patch is fine, and bitbucket corresponds to this, and the 20K is no problem - you didn't include any pdfs!

Hmm, there are two PDFs -- `sagetex.pdf` and `example.pdf`. But `example.tex` should be the only thing duplicated.

Okay, you were right on that, but there is however something additional - namely, the checksum.  Do other spkgs come with their own checksum?  I don't believe so.  (That is what confused my computer, I think.)

That's what I meant.  No pdfs in the texmf directory, so only one *additional* document, as you said.  I guess I should have so "any additional pdfs".

The only change in the spkg should be that `setup.py` also installs example.tex into the "doc" directory, and an entry in SPKG.txt.

I know that there's a bunch of ancient cruft in there that should get cleaned up but perhaps we'll do that in another ticket.
