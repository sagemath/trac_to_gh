I think that `spkg/bin/sage-env` is the only place in Sage which refers to `DOT_SAGE/tmp`:

```
if [ -z "$SAGE_TESTDIR" ]; then
    SAGE_TESTDIR="$DOT_SAGE"/tmp && export SAGE_TESTDIR
fi
```
So this could be changed from `tmp` to `temp`.

Patches attached.

Can't we simply get rid of `SAGE_TESTDIR` for now? I don't think the logfile for the testing is that important and besides, this would change anyway in the git layout.

doctest/control.py is the only place `SAGE_TESTDIR` is used: 

```python
        if options.all and options.logfile is None:
            options.logfile = os.path.join(os.environ['SAGE_TESTDIR'], 'test.log')
