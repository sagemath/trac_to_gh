I think that `spkg/bin/sage-env` is the only place in Sage which refers to `DOT_SAGE/tmp`:

```
if [ -z "$SAGE_TESTDIR" ]; then
    SAGE_TESTDIR="$DOT_SAGE"/tmp && export SAGE_TESTDIR
fi
```
So this could be changed from `tmp` to `temp`.

Patches attached.

Can't we simply get rid of `SAGE_TESTDIR` for now? I don't think the logfile for the testing is that important and besides, this would change anyway in the git layout.

That's fine with me. What should we use for the default location for the logfile?
doctest/control.py is the only place `SAGE_TESTDIR` is used: 

```python
        if options.all and options.logfile is None:
            options.logfile = os.path.join(os.environ['SAGE_TESTDIR'], 'test.log')
```
