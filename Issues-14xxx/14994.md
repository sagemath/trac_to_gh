Implementation for the wrapping of GAP's `DirectProduct` function for finitely presented groups. 

```
sage: G = FreeGroup()
sage: C3 = G / [G([1,1,1])]
sage: C3.direct_product(C3)
Finitely presented group < a, b | a^3, b^3, a^-1*b^-1*a*b >
```
My approach is object oriented as a `FinitelyPresentedGroup` method, as opposed to a function call such as `direct_product_fpgroups` taking a list of groups as input.
Depends on #14790 for variable names, and #14913 for fp group computations in doctests.

1.  On 5.11.beta3, I get a doctest error for

```
C7.direct_product(C6).is_isomorphic(C14.direct_product(C3)) 
```

that indicates the `is_isomorphic` is missing.  Is my version too old, or does this have a missing dependency?

2.  If you have to rebase or edit at any point, you might move spelling errors to another ticket.  Otherwise, other changes elsewhere might give you some rebasing pain as this patch moves through the review/relase process.
