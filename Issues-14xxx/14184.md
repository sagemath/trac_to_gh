Isn't this exactly the kind of huge intrusive patch we've been trying to avoid?  ;-)  That said, it would be really nice to have standardization for people to look at, so I'm not opposed to this.

Stuff to fix and/or think about doing as long as this ticket is opened.

* The sage/coding/guava.py should have the same message as the ones in sage/coding/code_bounds.py and sage/coding/linear_code.py 
* `# long time; optional - internet ` and in another place, reversed - I assume that won't matter, but just asking in case
* `# optional - database_hohel` - I don't know of a Hohel in Sage development, but I bet [the database_kohel spkg](http://sagemath.org/packages/optional/database_kohel-20060803.spkg) is what is meant :-)
* Did we change the `convert` ones to `ImageMagick`, or vice versa?  Anyway, that should be standardized if it wasn't already elsewhere (this feels familiar)
* I'm not sure why something can depend on dot2tex but not graphviz, and even more weirdly, graphviz is experimental, but not dot2tex ?!?!?  Though I guess it is okay...
* sometimes `octave`, sometimes `Octave` - does capitalization matter?  Same with `Axiom`.
* `somewhat random` - is that an official designation?
* `< 1/100th of a second ` - well, I guess it might be!  I guess we can leave that.
* What is the `time` command?  The one that we always have?  I'm confused here.

```
sage: q = qsieve(n, block=False, time=True)           # optional - time 
```
* The `sage/lfunctions/sympow.py` test seems ... odd.  Should it instead be long test?  Note that the previous command just says optional, with no indication of why.
* `# optional - FES, random` - does it matter if random is before or after?  I would think this is going to look for the `random` spkg.  Same with `# optional; randomly growing. `

Otherwise looks good - I did look at all of them by hand, not the script.  Though obviously I am not going to try to test all of these optional tests by hand.

Replying to [kcrisman](#comment%3A7):
> Isn't this exactly the kind of huge intrusive patch we've been trying to avoid?  ;-)

Not really. Huge intrusive patches are okay as long as they serve a purpose. Removing whitespace all over the place doesn't serve a purpose, this patch certainly does.

This patch is mainly motivated by #12415, which has different (more strict) parsing for `# optional`, leading to less false positives (but also less true positives, hence this patch).

>  * The sage/coding/guava.py should have the same message as the ones in sage/coding/code_bounds.py and sage/coding/linear_code.py
 
OK, I'll have a look.

>  * `# long time; optional - internet ` and in another place, reversed - I assume that won't matter, but just asking in case
 
Doesn't matter.

>  * `# optional - database_hohel` - I don't know of a Hohel in Sage development, but I bet [the database_kohel spkg](http://sagemath.org/packages/optional/database_kohel-20060803.spkg) is what is meant :-)
 
OK, so that's a typo.

>  * Did we change the `convert` ones to `ImageMagick`, or vice versa?  Anyway, that should be standardized if it wasn't already elsewhere (this feels familiar)
 
I have no idea.

>  * I'm not sure why something can depend on dot2tex but not graphviz, and even more weirdly, graphviz is experimental, but not dot2tex ?!?!?  Though I guess it is okay...
 
I have no idea what these packages are.

>  * sometimes `octave`, sometimes `Octave` - does capitalization matter?  Same with `Axiom`.
 
OK, changing to all lowercase.

>  * `somewhat random` - is that an official designation?
 
The doctester looks for "random", so it will be recognized. I think it's fine.

>  * `< 1/100th of a second ` - well, I guess it might be!  I guess we can leave that.
 
This can be seen as "just a comment" without further meaning.

>  * What is the `time` command?  The one that we always have?  I'm confused here.
 
I have no idea.

>  * The `sage/lfunctions/sympow.py` test seems ... odd.  Should it instead be long test?  Note that the previous command just says optional, with no indication of why.
 
True, it's odd. I think it means that you need to run `sympow` first to create some tables, but I don't know more.

>  * `# optional - FES, random` - does it matter if random is before or after?  I would think this is going to look for the `random` spkg.  Same with `# optional; randomly growing. `
 
At least with the *new* doctester (which is what we're aiming for), `optional - FES, random` will only require `FES`.

> Though obviously I am not going to try to test all of these optional tests by hand.

That is also most certainly not the point of this ticket.

I figured :)

> I have no idea.
I was right - we did change it to the program needed.  `search_src('ImageMagick')` gets me a lot of hits, particularly in plot/animate.py

```
plot/animate.py:430:            sage: a.show()       # optional -- ImageMagick
plot/animate.py:435:            sage: a.show(iterations=3)    # optional -- ImageMagick
plot/animate.py:439:            sage: a.show(delay=50)        # optional -- ImageMagick
```
I think this needs to be uniformized.  See #11170, where this was done, except apparently to the guys here (see also #10655 and #7981 for background).  By the way, is the `--` versus `-` important?

It's ok, I think this is okay after looking at the various package lists.

Ok

Just wanted to make sure that additional comments were okay in doctest lines.

> I have no idea.
Got it - see the line above them (which your script didn't catch)?

```
sage: v, t = qsieve(n, time=True)   # uses the sieve    (optional: time doesn't work on cygwin) 
```
This line should be changed to "look nice", and now we know why this was marked optional.  It hardly seems fair to make something optional that only doesn't work on a not-yet-supported platform... maybe we should remove these as optional?  I'll leave that to you.
> >  * The `sage/lfunctions/sympow.py` test seems ... odd.  Should it instead be long test?  Note that the previous command just says optional, with no indication of why.
 
> True, it's odd. I think it means that you need to run `sympow` first to create some tables, but I don't know more.
I believe you are right.  But the doctest makes no sense as an automatic doctest in that case.  See [the relevant note](http://hg.sagemath.org/sage-main/file/5714ed3eab6a/sage/lfunctions/sympow.py#l116).  In fact, I get the bizarre (newlines not rendered)

```
sage: a = sympow.L(EllipticCurve('11a'), 2, 16); a 
"Inertia Group is  C1 MULTIPLICATIVE REDUCTION\nConductor is 11\n**ERROR** P02L not found in param_data file\nIt can be added with './sympow -new_data 2'"
```
So I believe that both of them should probably be made `optional - precomputations`, or perhaps even better to add 

```
sage: sympow('-new_data 2') # not tested
```
to the doctest and make them all not tested, since by definition someone would have to do something "by hand" to make them testable.  Or do you have another creative solution?  I can think of a couple, but they are annoying and probably pointless.   

There should also be better error catching there, but I figure anyone using sympow knows what they are doing enough to read the documentation - or is that worth a ticket as well?

Done, changed all to `optional -- ImageMagick`.

No, I used a double dash for consistency here.

Technically, it's worth a ticket but I have no plans to work on it.

Note that technically <code>\`\`sympow -new_data 2\`\`</code> isn't needed; `sage: sympow('-new_data 2') ` is just as good, and has the advantage of being able to be included in the doctests (`# not tested`, of course).
