```
At [sage-devel](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/sage-devel/Gnw389Bd-0k), Nils suggests to use some kind of lazy object for the error messages of errors that are deeply buried in the coercion model.

This approach is similar to what we already do with `sage.structure.misc.AttributeErrorMassage`. However, this is specifically restricted to error messages of attribute errors. In the more general case, it makes sense to use either `sage.misc.lazy_format.LazyFormat` or `sage.misc.lazy_string.lazy_string`. The latter seems to be faster, according to these timings that are according to Nils' example:

```
sage: from sage.misc.lazy_string import lazy_string
sage: f = lambda op,A,B:"unsupported operand parent(s) for '%s': '%s' and '%s'"%(op,A,B)
sage: R = GF(5)
sage: S = GF(3)
sage: %timeit Exception(lazy_string(f, '+', R, S))
1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.47 us per loop
sage: lazy_string(f, '+', R, S)
l"unsupported operand parent(s) for '+': 'Finite Field of size 5' and 'Finite Field of size 3'"
sage: %timeit Exception("unsupported operand parent(s) for '%s': '%s' and '%s'"%('+', R, S))
100000 loops, best of 3: 5.04 us per loop
sage: from sage.misc.lazy_format import LazyFormat
sage: ErrMess = LazyFormat("unsupported operand parent(s) for '%s': '%s' and '%s'")
sage: %timeit Exception(ErrMess%('+', R, S))
10000 loops, best of 3: 23.1 us per loop
sage: ErrMess%('+', R, S)
unsupported operand parent(s) for '+': 'Finite Field of size 5' and 'Finite Field of size 3'
```
We're better off making a fresh `LazyFormat` object every time, due to an inefficiency in the copying operation required for rebinding such an object:

```
sage: %timeit LazyFormat("unsupported operand parent(s) for '%s': '%s' and '%s'")%('+', R, S)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 2.08 Âµs per loop
```
Luckily, present use of `LazyFormat` follows this pattern.

So, it would already make sense to replace all error messages using string formatting by a call to `lazy_string`, while `LazyFormat` seems to be quite sluggish.

Two tasks:
1. Make `lazy_string` and `LazyFormat` a lot faster (perhaps by using Cython)
2. Use it for errors raised when trying to find coercions. The problem is particularly urgent if the string representation of an object is difficult to compute.

**__Note__**

For the second task, we meanwhile have #14592

Apart from making coercion faster, there is the following problem that we would fix as well. Consider creation of a parent. It may happen that relatively early during initialisation, a coercion is needed, but only later, the string representation of the parent will become available. Hence, if there is an error raised (and caught) inside of the coercion system that relies on the string representation of the parent, then we are in trouble.

Here is a first patch, that cythons lazy_string. Result:

```
sage: from sage.misc.lazy_string import lazy_string
sage: f = lambda op,A,B:"unsupported operand parent(s) for '%s': '%s' and '%s'"%(op,A,B)
sage: R = GF(5)
sage: S = GF(3)
sage: lazy_string(f, '+', R, S)
l"unsupported operand parent(s) for '+': 'Finite Field of size 5' and 'Finite Field of size 3'"
sage: %timeit Exception(lazy_string(f, '+', R, S))
1000000 loops, best of 3: 595 ns per loop
```
So, the time for raising the exception drops by more than 50% compared with the old Python lazy_string.

Next will be lazy_format.

```
cdef _LazyString _DummyLazyString = _LazyString(None, (), {})

def lazy_string_dummy(f, *args, **kwds):

    return _DummyLazyString

And then, then one can raise errors even quicker:

sage: f = lambda op,A,B:"unsupported operand parent(s) for '%s': '%s' and '%s'"%(op,A,B)
sage: R = GF(5)

sage: lazy_string_dummy(f, ('+', R, S), {})

sage: %timeit Exception(lazy_string_dummy(f, ('+', R, S), {}))

```

Do you think this would be feasible to have a unique message object for the errors raised and caught internally?

Replying to [@simon-king-jena](#comment%3A3):

> sage: %timeit Exception(_LazyString(f, ('+', R, S), {}))

- do we need the `{}` for kwargs?
- does ditching it provide a worthwhile speedup?
- how do we do if we instead have a `*kwargs` collect the arguments in a tuple rather than pass them as a tuple preformed?

Note that `LazyFormat` would be completely analogous. In fact, internally they could be the same code, with just a flag that says "interpolate f with args" rather than "call f with args".

The latter has the advantage that it's a little easier: You don't have to prewrap a string in a lambda to get decent performance.

Then this would be bad. In fact, if they're hashable they NEED to be caching, which goes counter to existing use of lazy_string, where it's used as a window on an environment variable.\n\nI'd say at least underscore this method to make it clear it's bad.

> OK, I have updated the second patch accordingly. There is now not just a single lazy dummy, but an arbitrary existing lazy string (with fixed underlying function) can be updated by providing new arguments to the underlying function.

Hm ... are these strings hashable (and hence immutable)? Then this would be bad. In fact, if they're hashable they NEED to be caching, which goes counter to existing use of lazy_string, where it's used as a window on an environment variable.

I'd say at least underscore this method to make it clear it's bad. And only use it in our code if you can show that in real-world examples it makes a considerable difference (which I doubt: producing exceptions is only going to be a small percentage of total processing time, so possible gain is limited)

No, it is not hashable.

Or: cimport `_LazyString` in the coercion code and modify the arguments directly.

In fact, perhaps just allow `LazyString` to be initialized with a string or a callable and interpolate with arguments rather than call with arguments if it's a string. That should be a very cheap test when the value gets requested.

The only difference with (present) `LazyFormat` would be that `LazyFormat` caches its value after first interpolation, but that's likely not an important trait (certainly not for our applications). Then you can basically just do away with `LazyFormat`.

I did a quick experiment. For reference, I first tried the patch as given here:

```
sage: E=Exception(_LazyString(f, ('+', R, S)))
sage: %timeit repr(E)
100000 loops, best of 3: 6.76 us per loop
```

Then I tried it with

```
    @property
    def value(self):
        cdef object f=self._func
        if PyString_Check(f):
           return f%self._args
        return f(*self._args)
```

which resulted in

```
sage: s="unsupported operand parent(s) for '%s': '%s' and '%s'"
sage: E=Exception(_LazyString(s, ('+', R, S)))
sage: %timeit repr(E)
100000 loops, best of 3: 6.48 us per loop
sage: E=Exception(_LazyString(f, ('+', R, S)))
sage: %timeit repr(E)
100000 loops, best of 3: 6.54 us per loop
```
from which I don't dare to conclude that the code is MORE efficient with the branching, so I'll settle for not slower. (it seems putting or not putting a kwargs in there hardly makes a measurable difference, so we might as well).

You really do want to do a `PyString_Check` there. Doing an `isinstance` is noticeably slower.

OK, I'll change the patch accordingly, also deprecating `LazyFormat`, and creating a pxd file for lazy_string, so that it will later become possible to change a lazy string in-place without calling a function (but instead by cimporting it and then directly inserting stuff into the cdef attributes).

How about just changing `LazyFormat` to a factory function for `_LazyString` objects? Then we at least get the benefit (provided chaching behaviour is not required for it. Otherwise `LazyString` might grow a `cache_result` flag, if that doesn't affect performance.

Also, I think `_LazyString` has an easy enough interface to be called `LazyString` and be used directly (and then just leave `lazy_string` around for compatibility reasons).

I also realized that the following spelling leads to more efficient code in cython:

```
    property value:
        def __get__(self):
            cdef object f=self._func
            if PyString_Check(f):
               return f%self._args
            return f(*self._args)
```
With the old code:

```
sage: from sage.misc.lazy_string import lazy_string, _LazyString
sage: f=lambda :"hi"
sage: s=_LazyString(f,())
sage: %timeit str(s)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 425 ns per loop
```
and with cython property spelling:

```
sage: %timeit str(s)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 282 ns per loop
```
Finally:

```
sage: f=lambda n:"hi%s"%n
sage: s=_LazyString(f,('ho',))
sage: %timeit str(s)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 428 ns per loop
sage: %timeit str(s)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 423 ns per loop
sage: f="hi%s"
sage: s=_LazyString(f,('ho',))
sage: %timeit str(s)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 319 ns per loop
sage: %timeit str(s)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 316 ns per loop
```
so special casing string values to directly interpolate seems to be a measurable saving (on something that doesn't seem to contribute much to total running time anyway)

Is this the Cython spelling of "@property"? Why can't Cython automatically transform Python's `@`property accordingly?

return PyObject_CallObject(f,self._args)

or

```
return PyObject_Call(f,self._args,self._kwargs)

Cython still generates some code to ensure that the resulting bit from * is a tuple and not a general iterable, but we've already forced it to be a tuple.

Part of why `LazyFormat` seems so sluggish presently is the strategy how it copies itself when asked to rebind. It will usually be cheaper to make a fresh `LazyFormat` object (in other words, we should make the rebinding just do that). The problem presently is that the use of `copy` leads to the desperate act of using `__reduce__` (!) to do the copying. Much better already:

```
sage: class A(str): pass
sage: a=A("a")
sage: %timeit copy(a)
100000 loops, best of 3: 13 Âµs per loop
sage: %timeit A(str.__repr__(a))
1000000 loops, best of 3: 558 ns per loop
sage: %timeit A("a")
10000000 loops, best of 3: 258 ns per loop
```
so at the very least we should use the latter incantation in `LazyFormat.__mod__`, and it would be even nicer be able to get the string value of a in a cheaper way.

<a id='comment:44'>Comment 44:</a>
If you never *use* the fact that `_args` is a tuple and `_kwds` is a dict, there is no point in doing

```
cdef tuple _args
cdef dict _kwargs
```

You can simplify this (and also drop the ugly underscores) to

```
cdef args
cdef kwargs
```
(which is actually an epsilon faster since there are no checks needed)

Don't we use it being tuple/dict when we use `CallObject`?

object PyObject_CallObject(object callable_object, object args)

I tried it, and to my surprise it seems slightly slower:

Current code

```
sage: from sage.misc.lazy_string import lazy_string
sage: f = lambda: "laziness"
sage: s = lazy_string(f)
sage: %timeit s < 'laziness'
The slowest run took 17.05 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached 
1000000 loops, best of 3: 294 ns per loop
sage: %timeit s <= 'aziness'
The slowest run took 19.35 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached 
1000000 loops, best of 3: 308 ns per loop
sage: %timeit s == 'laziness'
The slowest run took 20.48 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached 
1000000 loops, best of 3: 291 ns per loop
sage: %timeit s != 'aziness'
The slowest run took 40.70 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached 
1000000 loops, best of 3: 293 ns per loop
```

With `PyObject_RichCompare`:

```
sage: from sage.misc.lazy_string import lazy_string
sage: f = lambda: "laziness"
sage: s = lazy_string(f)
sage: %timeit s < 'laziness'
The slowest run took 17.50 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached 
1000000 loops, best of 3: 341 ns per loop
sage: %timeit s <= 'aziness'
The slowest run took 20.08 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached 
1000000 loops, best of 3: 344 ns per loop
sage: %timeit s == 'laziness'
The slowest run took 20.68 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached 
1000000 loops, best of 3: 334 ns per loop
sage: %timeit s != 'aziness'
The slowest run took 21.79 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached 
1000000 loops, best of 3: 328 ns per loop
```

So, we shouldn't do that.

<a id='comment:55'>Comment 55:</a>
Instead of

```
def __init__(self, f, tuple args, dict kwargs):
```
better use

```
def __init__(self, f, args, kwargs):
```

If you really want to check the types, you can do that by

```
self.args = <tuple?>args
self.kwds = <dict?>kwds
```
(this also disallows `None` for `args` and `kwds`)
