Looks good.  You didn't add a doctest: is there one that consistently fails in the new framework?

Replying to [roed](#comment%3A2):
> is there one that consistently fails in the new framework?

To be honest, I cannot say for sure why the problem occurs.

I'm fairly certain the problem is the big gap between

```
pid = os.wait()[0]
```
and

```
del workers[pid]
```
If some exception would occur in between, then `workers[pid]` would still be in the list of workers, even though we saw it exit. However, I cannot really explain where the exception could come from (can `yield` raise exceptions?)

How consistently is this error occurring in the new framework?  Every time?  Do the fixes here make the problem disappear?  If so, I'm willing to give this a positive review, since there is a doctest failing that will no longer fail.

You should fix the unpickling after breaking it.  Add 

```
sage: from sage.structure.sage_object import unpickle_override
sage: del unpickle_override[('sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_rational_flint', 'Polynomial_rational_flint')]
```

after the end of the `TESTS` block.  Otherwise it looks good.
