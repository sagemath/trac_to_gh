> is there one that consistently fails in the new framework?

To be honest, I cannot say for sure why the problem occurs.

I'm fairly certain the problem is the big gap between

```
pid = os.wait()[0]
```
and

```
del workers[pid]
```
If some exception would occur in between, then `workers[pid]` would still be in the list of workers, even though we saw it exit. However, I cannot really explain where the exception could come from (can `yield` raise exceptions?)
