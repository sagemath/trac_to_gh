The vertex-connectivity of a complete graph on k elements is defined to be equal to k-1. Unfortunately, this special case is also triggered when the input graph is directed, and that is a problem.

Hello,

For me the patch is already good to go, but I have a few remarks

* For directed graphs: can't we say that when `D.allows_loops()==False and D.allows_multiple_edges()==False and D.size()==D.order()*(D.order()-1)` then we can safely return N-1?
* Could you also get rid of the 0.0 and 1.0?

David.

What about this one ? The LP is actually infeasible when the input graph is complete, so it isn't only about optimization after all.

In the test `(g.is_directed() and g.size() >= (g.order()-1*g.order()) and all(g.has_edge(u,v) for u in g for v in g if v != u)))` you should add () around g.order()-1.

Furthermore, you should add the simple test I have proposed because it is way faster for digraphs without loops or multiple edges. 

So the test could be:

```
( g.is_directed() and g.size()>=(g.order()-1)*g.order() and 
   ( (not g.allows_loops() and not g.allows_multiple_edges())
     or all(g.has_edge(u,v) for u in g for v in g if v != u) ) )

Create a complete digraph, add a loop and compute the vertex connectivity --> an exception is raised by the LP solver. That's why I wrote this version instead.

Hmmmm.... I think you went too quickly on what I wrote: If you know that the digraph has N*(N-1) arcs **and** that loops and multiple arcs are forbidden, then you know that the digraph is a clique, isn't it? If loops or multiple edges are allowed, clearly you have to go through all edges.

Do you mean that you want me to add both sets of constraints to the list ?

**Attachment:** [trac_14856.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket14856/trac_14856.patch)

I agree this is an ugly test, but it is efficient ;-)

```
sage: G = DiGraph(graphs.CompleteGraph(10))
sage: %timeit G.vertex_connectivity()
100000 loops, best of 3: 4.98 us per loop
sage: G.allow_loops(True)
sage: G.add_edge(0,0)
sage: %timeit G.vertex_connectivity()
1000 loops, best of 3: 266 us per loop
```


Install OK, functionality OK, test OK => the patch is good to go.
