On Solaris, things are more complicated. If we use `cp -pr`, then it behaves like OS X, i.e., badly. If we use `cp -pR`, then it still doesn't work; instead, `cp -pPR` almost works. The only problem is that file permissions can get messed up, at least when a file in one directory is a link pointing to another directory. Consider this directory TEST:

```
$ ls -l TEST/
total 6
drwxr-xr-x   2 palmieri other          3 Feb 25 04:07 dir/
-rw-r--r--   1 palmieri other         79 Feb 24 21:13 FILE
lrwxrwxrwx   1 palmieri other          4 Feb 25 04:06 link1 -> FILE
$ ls -l TEST/dir/
total 1
lrwxrwxrwx   1 palmieri other          4 Feb 25 04:07 link2 -> FILE
```
Now copy it:

```
$ cp -pPR TEST X
$ ls -l X
total 6
drwxr-xr-x   2 palmieri other          3 Feb 25 04:07 dir/
-rwxrwxrwx   1 palmieri other         79 Feb 25 04:06 FILE*
lrwxrwxrwx   1 palmieri other          4 Feb 25 04:08 link1 -> FILE*
$ ls -l X/dir
total 1
lrwxrwxrwx   1 palmieri other          4 Feb 25 04:08 link2 -> FILE
```
Note the permissions on FILE. The way around this seems to be to use `/usr/xpg4/bin/cp -pPR@ SOURCE TARGET`, naturally.

Let's ignore the scripts patch and just focus on the patch for the Sage library.

 According to [http://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/autoconf/manual/autoconf-2.68/html_node/Limitations-of-Usual-Tools.html#Limitations-of-Usual-Tools](http://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/autoconf/manual/autoconf-2.68/html_node/Limitations-of-Usual-Tools.html#Limitations-of-Usual-Tools), we should avoid the "-r" flag for `cp`. On linux, using "-r" or "-R" doesn't make a difference, but on OS X, the man page for cp says that with the -r flag, "it does not correctly copy special files, symbolic links, or fifo's."
 
-As a result, after building from scratch using #6495 on OS X or OpenSolaris, the various files `doc/en/reference/MODULE/conf.py`, which are all supposed to by symlinks to `doc/en/reference/conf_sub.py`, are copies of that file instead, and the hg repo is not clean. So I'm marking this as a blocker. I think that to fix the real problem, only the Sage library needs to be patched, but we might as well apply the scripts patch as well. I think that the only other instance of "cp -pr" in any spkg is in the R spkg, and I don't think those instances are worth fixing right now.
