On Solaris, things are more complicated. If we use `cp -pr`, then it behaves like OS X, i.e., badly. If we use `cp -pR`, then it still doesn't work; instead, `cp -pPR` almost works. The only problem is that file permissions can get messed up, at least when a file in one directory is a link pointing to another directory. Consider this directory TEST:

```
$ ls -l TEST/
total 6
drwxr-xr-x   2 palmieri other          3 Feb 25 04:07 dir/
-rw-r--r--   1 palmieri other         79 Feb 24 21:13 FILE
lrwxrwxrwx   1 palmieri other          4 Feb 25 04:06 link1 -> FILE
$ ls -l TEST/dir/
total 1
lrwxrwxrwx   1 palmieri other          4 Feb 25 04:07 link2 -> FILE
```
Now copy it:

```
$ cp -pPR TEST X
$ ls -l X
total 6
drwxr-xr-x   2 palmieri other          3 Feb 25 04:07 dir/
-rwxrwxrwx   1 palmieri other         79 Feb 25 04:06 FILE*
lrwxrwxrwx   1 palmieri other          4 Feb 25 04:08 link1 -> FILE*
$ ls -l X/dir
total 1
lrwxrwxrwx   1 palmieri other          4 Feb 25 04:08 link2 -> FILE
```
Note the permissions on FILE. The way around this seems to be to use `/usr/xpg4/bin/cp -pPR@ SOURCE TARGET`, naturally.

Let's ignore the scripts patch and just focus on the patch for the Sage library.
