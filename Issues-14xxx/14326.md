consider the following in Sage 5.8:

```
sage: u(n) = n^100 / 100^n; u(1.)
1/100
```
This is inconsistent with:

```
sage: n=1.; n^100 / 100^n
0.0100000000000000
```
and with:

```
sage: v = lambda(n): n^100 / 100^n; v(1.)
0.0100000000000000
```
and:

```
sage: def w(n): return n^100 / 100^n       
sage: w(1.) 
0.0100000000000000
```

Wow, this is weird.  Here is a *much* simpler example.

```
sage: w(n) = n
sage: w(1.)
1.00000000000000
sage: w(n) = n^2
sage: w(1.)
1
```
In fact, even

```
sage: (x^2).subs(x=1.)
1
```
works.  Yuck.

Somehow the custom power method is not doing its job when you substitute .  But I don't see an obvious place in Ginac where this would get screwed up...

Aha.

```
sage: z = x^2
sage: z.subs(x=1.)
1
sage: z.subs(x=2.)
4.00000000000000
```
Because one does get treated differently.  Though

```
sage: z = x
sage: z.subs(x=1.)
1.00000000000000
```
so it also has something to do with the coercion that happens in the power method for symbolic expressions.

Okay, I think this *might* be a bug in Ginac, or possibly in how we *use* Ginac.  In the Ginac definition of [automatic rewriting of power::eval](http://www.ginac.de/reference/power_8cpp_source.html#l00371), we have

```
00399     // ^(x,1) -> x
00400     if (eexponent.is_equal(_ex1))
00401         return basis;
...
00413     // ^(1,x) -> 1
00414     if (ebasis.is_equal(_ex1))
00415         return _ex1;
```
The other rewriting rules are probably harmless, though if

```
sage: z
x^n
sage: z.subs(x=0.)
0.000000000000000^n
sage: z.subs(x=0)
0^n
sage: z.subs(n=0)
1
sage: z.subs(n=0.)
1
```
where the `0^n` business is because Ginac checks if the exponent is numerical because it doesn't want to evaluate something that could, in principle, still become `0^0`.

Unfortunately, I'm not sure how to monkey-patch Pynac into recognizing this situation, and I certainly don't want to do a catch in the symbolic expression code, that is really the wrong place.  Here's hoping someone really intimately familiar with our back-and-forth to Pynac sees an easy fix.

please could you ask the Ginac developers if this is a bug in Ginac?
And if not, how to replace `_ex1` to get the correct "one"?

I am really not familiar enough with Ginac proper to do either of these with any technical knowledge, unfortunately.

Of course!  That makes perfect sense - once you say it, before it was murky :(

What about for the other case, of `x^1.0`?  We have

```
sage: (x^2).subs(x=1.)
1
sage: (2^x).subs(x=1.)
2
sage: (x^2).subs(x=2.)
4.00000000000000
sage: (2^x).subs(x=2.)
4.00000000000000
```
so it would seem that if the exponent is not exact, we want the whole thing to be numerical.  I guess we could just strip out that simplification completely, but I don't know if that would give us anything useful either.
