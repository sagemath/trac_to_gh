<div id="comment:0"></div>

consider the following in Sage 5.8:

```
sage: u(n) = n^100 / 100^n; u(1.)
1/100
```
This is inconsistent with:

```
sage: n=1.; n^100 / 100^n
0.0100000000000000
```
and with:

```
sage: v = lambda(n): n^100 / 100^n; v(1.)
0.0100000000000000
```
and:

```
sage: def w(n): return n^100 / 100^n       
sage: w(1.) 
0.0100000000000000
```

Wow, this is weird.  Here is a *much* simpler example.

```
sage: w(n) = n
sage: w(1.)
1.00000000000000
sage: w(n) = n^2
sage: w(1.)
1
```
In fact, even

```
sage: (x^2).subs(x=1.)
1
```
works.  Yuck.

Somehow the custom power method is not doing its job when you substitute .  But I don't see an obvious place in Ginac where this would get screwed up...

Aha.

```
sage: z = x^2
sage: z.subs(x=1.)
1
sage: z.subs(x=2.)
4.00000000000000
```
Because one does get treated differently.  Though

```
sage: z = x
sage: z.subs(x=1.)
1.00000000000000
```
so it also has something to do with the coercion that happens in the power method for symbolic expressions.

Okay, I think this *might* be a bug in Ginac, or possibly in how we *use* Ginac.  In the Ginac definition of [automatic rewriting of power::eval](http://www.ginac.de/reference/power_8cpp_source.html#l00371), we have

```
00399     // ^(x,1) -> x
00400     if (eexponent.is_equal(_ex1))
00401         return basis;
...
00413     // ^(1,x) -> 1
00414     if (ebasis.is_equal(_ex1))
00415         return _ex1;
```
The other rewriting rules are probably harmless, though if

```
sage: z
x^n
sage: z.subs(x=0.)
0.000000000000000^n
sage: z.subs(x=0)
0^n
sage: z.subs(n=0)
1
sage: z.subs(n=0.)
1
```
where the `0^n` business is because Ginac checks if the exponent is numerical because it doesn't want to evaluate something that could, in principle, still become `0^0`.

Unfortunately, I'm not sure how to monkey-patch Pynac into recognizing this situation, and I certainly don't want to do a catch in the symbolic expression code, that is really the wrong place.  Here's hoping someone really intimately familiar with our back-and-forth to Pynac sees an easy fix.

please could you ask the Ginac developers if this is a bug in Ginac?
And if not, how to replace `_ex1` to get the correct "one"?

I am really not familiar enough with Ginac proper to do either of these with any technical knowledge, unfortunately.  And the Ginac developer(s) are not particularly responsive right now to any but the most informed pieces of information, apparently.  If someone can figured out how to replicate this in Ginac that would be great, but again it could be us misusing it, I'm not sure.

I would be surprised if #17130 fixed this, based on my experiments above.

Looking at the code snippet from [comment:8](#comment%3A8) only, I don't think this is a bug in Ginac. The intended behavior is just different in Pynac, so we have to patch Pynac.

Ginac wants to keep unique reference counted expression objects for expressions that are equal. That is why they return `_ex1` on line 415. In Pynac, we do not have a unique "one", we should just return `ebasis` in this line to keep the precision/type of the base.

Replying to [@burcin](#comment%3A13):

Thanks for replying!

Of course!  That makes perfect sense - once you say it, before it was murky :(

What about for the other case, of `x^1.0`?  We have

```
sage: (x^2).subs(x=1.)
1
sage: (2^x).subs(x=1.)
2
sage: (x^2).subs(x=2.)
4.00000000000000
sage: (2^x).subs(x=2.)
4.00000000000000
```
so it would seem that if the exponent is not exact, we want the whole thing to be numerical.  I guess we could just strip out that simplification completely, but I don't know if that would give us anything useful either.
