This method makes a few additions/changes to p-adics.

* If `K` is an extension of `Z_p` whose generator is `a`, we add a method `polynomial` which takes as input an element `x` in `K` and outputs a polynomial `P` with coefficients in `Z_p` such that `P(a) = x`.

```
sage: K.<a> = Qq(5^3)
sage: a.polynomial()
(1 + O(5^20))*x + (O(5^20))
```
* Rename the `list()` method to `expansion()` and have it return a custom iterable instead of a list
* Rename the `teichmuller_list()` method to `teichmuller_expansion()` and have it return a custom iterable instead of a list
* Add an optional argument `n` to `expansion()` and `teichmuller_expansion()`, providing a single digit in the p-adic expansion.
* Fix inconsistencies in `teichmuller_expansion()` for different precision types
* Deprecate `padded_list` since this functionality is available either from `expansion` or from `Integer.digits` using the `padto` keyword.
* Copy sections of inclusions `ZZ->Zp` when they’re used within the coercion system

There are followup tickets at #23827, #26406.

Yeah, this is intended.  When you pass in a value for `n` it gives you the coefficient of p<sup>n</sup>, rather than the `n`th term in the list.  I've updated the test (but haven't pushed yet).

Ok. Then the documentation should be more explicit. I thought it's just a shortcut to get the n-th element in the list.

The docstring says that (since this is not a field) summing these with powers of pi should return the original element, i.e., `(1 + O(2<sup>19))*2</sup>0 == 2`.
