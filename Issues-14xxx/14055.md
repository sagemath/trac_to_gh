In the line

```
pidfile = os.path.join(DOT_SAGE, 'tmp', 'cleaner-%s.pid'%HOSTNAME)
```
would it make sense to use `'temp'` instead of `'tmp'`, so all of the sage-cleaner information is in the same directory?

(Is there any good reason for having both directories `tmp` and `temp`? At some point, we should clean this up.)

THERE ARE STILL SOME INSTANCES OF UPPERCASE SAGE.

I don't like the mixture of tmp, temp, TMP and TEMP or whatever.




`temp` and `tmp` shouldn't be hardcoded.

"Deleting `.../spawned_processes`" gets printed even if `.../spawned_processes` is not a directory (`not e`), and also `rmtree()` is attempted, ignoring any `OSError`.




I don't like `"%s" % i` where `i` is (or should be) an `int`. 




Command line option handling is certainly suboptimal.  (`argv[1]` could be a `float` as well, there's no usage, and additional parameters simply get ignored.)

Likewise, if `DOT_SAGE` isn't set, an ugly `KeyError` is raised, instead of printing a meaningful message.

I am having a problem with this patch, but I don't know why. I am repeatedly running `sage -tp 2 devel/sage/sage/homology/s*`. Without the patch applied, everything is fine. With the patch, after the first successful run, I get this (I also removed the `&>/dev/null` after the call to `sage-cleaner` in `spkg/bin/sage`):

```
Without the patch, the file `simplicial_complex.py` passes tests in under 7 seconds; cpu time and cumulative wall time are each around 6 or 7 seconds. With the patch, the time out is pretty consistent for each run after the first. I'm seeing this on two different OS X 10.8 machines.

Also, if I delete the directory `DOT_SAGE/tmp`, then the pidfile won't get written at all during doctesting or when running sage. What script is responsible for creating that directory? If this directory is missing, I don't get the time-out any more, so the problem is really with sage-cleaner.

On the bright side, it seems to be cleaning out the appropriate files, directories, and processes.

Where is `DOTSAGE/tmp` used? Certainly the `temp` version is used in the definition of `SAGE_TMP`, so that is ubiquitous. For the file `cleaner-HOSTNAME.pid`, is that referenced anywhere in the Sage library? It looks like we could put that file in `temp` instead of `tmp` safely. Indeed, I can't find any other references to `DOTSAGE/tmp`...

I wouldn't rely on some wall time.

Unfortunately the cleaner cannot `wait()` for its parent, but it could poll whether it is still running (or -- much better I think -- wait for another signal), and do nothing until its parent has "vanished" (terminated, and no other process with the same PID is meanwhile running -- that's also a potential, although probably unlikely, problem with left-over Sage cleaner and `spawned_processes` PID files; in the latter case, even unrelated processes of the same user could get killed.)

If there's already another Sage cleaner instance running, it could of course exit immediately (modulo the problem mentioned before).

Once or twice, after running Sage, quitting, and starting it again, or doing doctests and then running Sage, I've seen this (again, I have allowed sage-cleaner to print its output to the screen):

Sure enough, in this case sage-cleaner isn't running while Sage is. Is this a problem? (It does start up if asked to by `interfaces/cleaner.py`.)

I can, not very reliably, reproduce this by starting Sage, letting the count go above 10, quit Sage, wait a second or two, and then restart it.

Otherwise, I think I'm happy with this.

> #14323 fixes the doctest failures, but not ecl processes...


I'm now among the lucky few who get these greedy, immortal ECL processes:

With Sage 5.9.beta2 (which includes #14323), GCC 4.8.0, on Ubuntu 10.04.4 x86_64, during `make` **testlong** (as opposed to `make ptestlong` -- others previously reported only the latter caused problems).

Two ECL processes show up while testing `sage/interfaces/lisp.py` (as I had guessed), quickly start eating up memory, and keep running even after the file has been tested without any errors.

Same on Ubuntu 10.04.4 x86, GCC 4.7.2, and `ptestlong`.  I also got an orphaned Maxima process (running at 100%) in the first run.  (Sage 5.9.beta2, no patches from here applied.)

So I've continued experimenting with Sage 5.8 vs. 5.9.beta2 (same system, same compiler and flags), and it turns out that the rogue ECL processes are solely caused by the new doctesting framework, so we should probably open another ticket for that issue.  (I did the tests with the Sage cleaner "disabled" in both releases, too, with the same results: 5.8, with the old doctesting framework: No problems at all.  5.9.beta2: ECL orphans every time I run doctests from the Makefile, no problems when run from the command line, i.e., without using `make`.)

Minimal receipt to reproduce the orphans here:

```make
testlisp:
        ./sage -t devel/sage/sage/interfaces/lisp.py
```
Running `make testlisp`.

The (un)setting of `MAKE`, using `make -j1`, `./sage -t` vs. `./sage -tp` etc. doesn't matter, nor does using `$(PIPE)` (or `spkg/bin/pipestatus`), or `tee`ing the output with a "normal" pipe;  it just works when running `./sage -t ...` from the command line, while I get the busy orphans as soon as I run the exact same command(s) from the Makefile.

(Note that also ECL didn't change between 5.8 and 5.9.beta2.)

So fixing the Sage cleaner alone *may* alleviate the problem, but won't really solve it.

Did a little more testing ...

With (Ubuntu 10.04.4's) GNU Make 3.81, I do get the orphans, while I don't get them with (vanilla) GNU Make 3.82.  (I haven't found any particularly interesting change in 3.82's NEWS.)

Still, at least John Cremona reported getting the orphans on Ubuntu 12.04 as well, and I strongly doubt Precise still ships GNU Make 3.81 (released 2006, while 3.82 was released in 2010, although Ubuntu might [still] patch its version, haven't checked that).

Here is my view on this ticket:

- `sage-cleaner` used to be completely broken.
- this ticket mostly fixes it.
- the only flaw I see is a [race condition](#comment%3A24), but that looks pretty rare. Fixing it can wait.
- there are undoubtedly other ways in which `sage-cleaner` could be fixed up, but they can wait.

So I'm willing to give this a positive review. Any dissenting views?

I actually didn't have problems with it recently (more precisely, for meanwhile a few years), until 5.9.x.

I haven't seen problems with processes, but the subdirectories of `DOT_SAGE/temp/` have been polluted with many directories dating back to 5.8 at least, because sage-cleaner was looking in the wrong directory.

The ECL processes' PIDs should be in the `spawned_processes` text file, with the patches from here now located in the directory `sage.misc.SAGE_TMP` (usually some `$DOT_SAGE/temp/<hostname>-<pid>/...` or `$DOT_SAGE/temp/<hostname>/<pid>/`?).

Volker's patch seems to work for me.

A slight problem with changing how Sage processes the hostname: for me, at least, the directory `DOT_SAGE/temp/HOSTNAME` is filled with old directories which were never properly cleaned up. On my machines, `'HOSTNAME'` is not a valid key in `os.environ`, so the hyphens have been replaced by underscores. If we change sage-cleaner (etc.) to not do the replacement, we will start to use a new HOSTNAME directory, so the old one won't get cleaned up.

On one hand, this is minor, and perhaps people should clean up their own `DOT_SAGE/temp` directories. On the other hand, the directory is polluted because of a bug in Sage, so maybe we should clean it up for them. So is it worth applying a patch like [my suggestion above](#comment%3A67) for Sage 5.9, and then in Sage 5.10, applying Volker's changes?

I'm curious: why is `'HOSTNAME'` sometimes in `os.environ` and sometimes not?

I ran `strace -ff -o /tmp/log/trace -s 128 sage -tp doc/en/constructions/linear_algebra.rst` on my desktop and there isn't much going on in the file system:

```
$ grep ^unlink *

The only obvious race is #13826, though I don't think that could cause the lisp failure. All communication with Maxima goes through a pty.

I've been running repeated doctests and the only thing that I see on taurus is occasional (about 5% of doctests runs) failure with the maxima pty interface. The trouble always starts with the assertion failure where input != echo:

```
File "devel/sage/doc/en/constructions/plotting.rst", line 52, in doc.en.constructions.plotting
Failed example:
    L = [(i/100.0, maxima.eval('jacobi_sn (%s/100.0,2.0)'%i))for i in range(-300,300)]
Exception raised:
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/home/vbraun/opt/taurus/sage-5.10.beta1/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/doctest/forker.py", line 466, in _run
        self.execute(example, compiled, test.globs)
      File "/home/vbraun/opt/taurus/sage-5.10.beta1/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/doctest/forker.py", line 825, in execute
        exec compiled in globs
      File "<doctest doc.en.constructions.plotting[0]>", line 1, in <module>
        L = [(i/RealNumber('100.0'), maxima.eval('jacobi_sn (%s/100.0,2.0)'%i))for i in range(-Integer(300),Integer(300))]
      File "/home/vbraun/opt/taurus/sage-5.10.beta1/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/interfaces/expect.py", line 1208, in eval
        for L in code.split('\n') if L != ''])
      File "/home/vbraun/opt/taurus/sage-5.10.beta1/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/interfaces/maxima.py", line 754, in _eval_line

```
And that has nothing to do with this ticket...

I don't know why there are random spaces sprinkled in, but it certainly doesn't have anything to do with this ticket. I haven't found any other failures on taurus.

Running with `nice -19` and background load seems to trigger it, I now get some maxima segfaults somewhat reliably. They look like a race in the multi-threaded ecl to me, for example the following failure:

I've attached an strace from a failed ECL startup on taurus. It seems that during dlopen of ECL an unrelated thread (id 16046) happens to finish which causes a SIGCHLD. If the ECL signal handler is not turned off during init then that would explain things going south. Nils, since you wrote it maybe you have an opinion on that?

Replying to [vbraun](#comment%3A102):
> For the record, we build ECL with `--disable-threads` so it shouldn't have any multithread support. It does link with pthreads, though perhaps boehmgc needs that. 


OK, good.

So perhaps this should go on a different ticket then?

I took a quick look at [unixint.d](http://sourceforge.net/p/ecls/ecl/ci/master/tree/src/c/unixint.d) and it seems ECL does install a handler for SIGCHLD. Perhaps you're just unlucky that the SIGCHLD gets delivered at a very inopportune moment when ECL hasn't quite finished setting up its handlers? Or are we just sloppy in how we change handlers? The handler they use is defined in [unixsys.d](http://sourceforge.net/p/ecls/ecl/ci/master/tree/src/c/unixsys.d) as `si::wait-for-all-processes`.
