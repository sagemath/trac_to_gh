<a id='comment:1'></a>First draft of this patch.  Still needs to be better documented and streamlined.  For instance, currently, creating primitive period 1 quivers by going through matrices instead of directly through digraph.  But, the examples appear to work.  Although sign convention should be double-checked.

Should other types such as quivers associated to other Brane Tilings, like dP3, F0, etc. also be hard-coded?

An update to this patch will come in the next few days, but should be working for now.

This patch has now been updated and works directly with digraphs as opposed to matrices.

It also automatically re-interprets the primitive period 1 quivers as the associated affine A quivers.

A future ticket or patch will possible include general period 1 quivers or other quivers from Brane Tilings.


Should be ready for review now.

apply trac_14444-Period-Quivers.patch

then the bot will only apply this patch.

One remark: 

For links to arxiv, you should use the arxiv role, like for example `:arxiv:`0904.0200``

Frederic, I am still interested in getting this into sage.  I have a SAGE research assistant this semester who should have time to do this if I don't have a chance to get to this first.  What did you mean exactly by "further changes"?  Are you recommending I open a new ticket regarding implementing these quivers?

I could open up a separate ticket for the period 1 functionalities.
