First draft of this patch.  Still needs to be better documented and streamlined.  For instance, currently, creating primitive period 1 quivers by going through matrices instead of directly through digraph.  But, the examples appear to work.  Although sign convention should be double-checked.

Should other types such as quivers associated to other Brane Tilings, like dP3, F0, etc. also be hard-coded?

An update to this patch will come in the next few days, but should be working for now.

Attachment [trac_14444-period-quivers-gm.patch](tarball://root/attachments/some-uuid/ticket14444/trac_14444-period-quivers-gm.patch) by gmoose05 created at 2013-05-23 20:51:35

This patch has now been updated and works directly with digraphs as opposed to matrices.

It also automatically re-interprets the primitive period 1 quivers as the associated affine A quivers.

A future ticket or patch will possible include general period 1 quivers or other quivers from Brane Tilings.


Should be ready for review now.

It was not necessary to replace the duplicate/unused patch by an empty patch. You can give instructions for the bot in comments, as follows:

apply trac_14444-Period-Quivers.patch

then the bot will only apply this patch.

One remark: 

For links to arxiv, you should use the arxiv role, like for example `:arxiv:`0904.0200``

As far as you know, do these two patches still work in the current sage?  If so, we can change this from needs work to needs review.

I could open up a separate ticket for the period 1 functionalities.
