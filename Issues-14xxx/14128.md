`linear_arboricity` has a parameter `k` which appears to define the number of colors, but does not. This patch renames is to `plus_one`. Plus the function did not compute the decomposition with a minimum number of colors. 
Plus Andrew Juell reported "a counter example to a very old conjecture" which turns out to be a Sage bug ! Too bad `:-)`
