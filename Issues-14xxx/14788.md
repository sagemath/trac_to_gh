looks good to me

I have made a small review patch that

* remove all trailing whitespaces
* add one doctest to derivative of lambert
* change link to wikipedia
* add two spaces after a comma (pep8 standard)
* remove one unused import statement and modify another one

if you are happy with my changes, and once the bot is green again, you can set a positive review on my behalf.

Frederic

I'm switching to positive review. Thanks for the reviewer patch.

In principle, I would like to restrict white space fixes to lines I touch already. The reviewer patch may conflict with other patches waiting to be merged on trac. While rebasing a patch on top of these changes is routine, it is nevertheless cumbersome and IMHO a waste of time.
