Implement a wrapper for tables/matrices which are indexed by arbitrary sage objects. For example, this would allow for things like

```
EXAMPLES::

    sage: ct=CharacterTable( SymmetricGroup(5) ).display()
    Character table of Symmetric group of order 5! as a permutation group
    -------------------------
       | 1a 2a 2b 3a 6a 4a 5a
    ---|---------------------
    X0 |  1 -1  1  1 -1 -1  1
    X1 |  4 -2  0  1  1  0 -1
    X2 |  5 -1  1 -1 -1  1  0
    X3 |  6  0 -2  0  0  0  1
    X4 |  5  1  1 -1  1 -1  0
    X5 |  4  2  0  1 -1  0 -1
    X6 |  1  1  1  1  1  1  1
    sage: ct['X3']
    [6, 0, -2, 0, 0, 0, 1]
    sage: ct[3]
    [6, 0, -2, 0, 0, 0, 1]
    sage: ct[:,'3a']
    [1, 1, -1, 0, -1, 1, 1]
    sage: ct['X3','3a']
    0
    sage: ct.html_display()   # display in web browser using #14104
```

There should also be an HTML interface as per #14104.

This is related to #13131, which provides better formatting for tables in sage, however the main thrust here is different as we want to index matrices/tables by other sage objects.

**Preliminary** patch is attached. It has quite a lot of documentation, however, I would like to add sections on how the labelled, reordering, options, ... all work. Some of the examples depend upon #13605 which gives extended options for printing partitions. The are a few minor issues to be fixed including refactoring the _repr_/latex/html methods.

Comments welcome.
