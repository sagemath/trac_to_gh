On some systems, when executing

```
./sage -tp --long devel/sage/sage/interfaces/lisp.py
```
there are two ECL processes which do (strace log)

```
read(0, "(setq sage0 2)\n", 1024)       = 15
write(1, "\n", 1)                       = 1
write(1, "2", 1)                        = 1
write(1, "\n", 1)                       = 1
write(1, ">", 1)                        = 1
write(1, " ", 1)                        = 1
read(0, 0x7f2c263b1000, 1024)           = -1 EIO (Input/output error)
--- SIGHUP (Hangup) @ 0 (0) ---
--- SIGCONT (Continued) @ 0 (0) ---
select(1, [0], NULL, NULL, {0, 0})      = 1 (in [0], left {0, 0})
select(1, [0], NULL, NULL, {0, 0})      = 1 (in [0], left {0, 0})
read(0, "", 1024)                       = 0
write(2, "\n", 1)                       = -1 EIO (Input/output error)

after which they either segfault or keep running forever.

**apply**: [attachment:14426_doctest.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket14426/14426_doctest.patch)

### ecl-12.12.1.p2 (Jeroen Demeyer, 9 April 2013)
* #14426: write_error.patch: avoid an infinite loop when reporting
  an error while writing to stderr.
* Rename spkg-make to spkg-src.
* Don't unset MAKEFLAGS (it was not clear why this was needed).
* It seems no longer needed to disable Altivec.
* Support ECL_CONFIGURE environment variable for options to
  ./configure.

You of course have to rebuild the spkgs that depend on ECL as well, i.e., Maxima, and do `sage -b` afterwards.

`SPKG.txt` lacks a "Patches" section, and the following "Special Update/Build Instructions" should get corrected:

```
 * Note: the way we configure Sage, CXX and CXXFLAGS are unused.
 * Note: for the time being, ECL is built single threaded library as it
   seems to interact badly with the pexpect interface and Sage's signal
   handling when built multithreaded.
