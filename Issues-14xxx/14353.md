Hey Volker, thanks for opening this ticket!

As I was thinking more about it, toric morphisms naturally factor into THREE: if `f: Sigma --> Sigma'`, then we have

`Sigma --f_s--> Sigma_s --f_b--> Sigma_i --f_i--> Sigma'`

where `f_s` is surjection onto the fan which is the image of Sigma, `f_i` is injection of Sigma' intersected with the image sublattice, and `f_b` is a birational map between the intermediate toric varieties which does not have to be surjective or injective. The map from a single blowup chart into the original variety is precisely `f_b` with the other two being identities.

I would like to do the following:
- adjust factoring to return three morphisms instead of two;
- make intermediate fans live in the `image_sublattice`;
- name them, perhaps, `domain_fan_image` (under the map of lattices) and `codomain_fan_restriction` (to the `image_sublattice`);
- get rid of `restrict_to_image` method as it is misleading, if not wrong: restriction to the image of a toric morphism is not necessarily a toric morphism (it is not for the blow up chart). It does not seem like it is used anywhere but one place and basically it was trying to do the factoring in a not very good way.

I am working on it now on top of your patches, so let me know if you have severe objections!

I don't think there are particularly good names for the intermediate fans. Instead of trying to invent some name, we can just let a user use `domain_fan()` / `image_fan()` on the factored morphism.

We have a choice for `Sigma_i`. Just the intersection with the image sublattice will in general contain cones whose preimage under `f_b` is empty. We can leave (some of) those out and get a smaller `Sigma_i`. E.g. take the composition of the half blowup chart with the embedding `C^2-> P^2`. The natural thing to do is probably take this smaller fan. So `f_i` would be the embedding `C<sup>2->P</sup>2` in the example. 

I'm happy to get rid of `restrict_to_image`, I was tempted to do that myself....

Here is some work in progress, does not look good in the patch, but it removes `restrict_to_image` in the end and adds `factor` instead, diff blends these activities.

No other new methods apart `is_birational` which is not proper yet and there are some failures with composition of morphisms - I completely agree that these fans have to be accessed through morphisms, no need for new names.

As for `Sigma_i` indeed we have a choice, but I'd rather stick with "the big one" because:
- it makes it independent of the domain fan, which is symmetrical to `Sigma_s` not depending on the codomain fan;
- the corresponding variety will be a closed subvariety of the codomain;
- it is easier to implement/faster to compute;
- last but not least - I already have it in the patch ;-)
