Hey Volker, thanks for opening this ticket!

As I was thinking more about it, toric morphisms naturally factor into THREE: if `f: Sigma --> Sigma'`, then we have

`Sigma --f_s--> Sigma_s --f_b--> Sigma_i --f_i--> Sigma'`

where `f_s` is surjection onto the fan which is the image of Sigma, `f_i` is injection of Sigma' intersected with the image sublattice, and `f_b` is a birational map between the intermediate toric varieties which does not have to be surjective or injective. The map from a single blowup chart into the original variety is precisely `f_b` with the other two being identities.

I would like to do the following:
- adjust factoring to return three morphisms instead of two;
- make intermediate fans live in the `image_sublattice`;
- name them, perhaps, `domain_fan_image` (under the map of lattices) and `codomain_fan_restriction` (to the `image_sublattice`);
- get rid of `restrict_to_image` method as it is misleading, if not wrong: restriction to the image of a toric morphism is not necessarily a toric morphism (it is not for the blow up chart). It does not seem like it is used anywhere but one place and basically it was trying to do the factoring in a not very good way.

I am working on it now on top of your patches, so let me know if you have severe objections!

Here is some work in progress, does not look good in the patch, but it removes `restrict_to_image` in the end and adds `factor` instead, diff blends these activities.

No other new methods apart `is_birational` which is not proper yet and there are some failures with composition of morphisms - I completely agree that these fans have to be accessed through morphisms, no need for new names.

As for `Sigma_i` indeed we have a choice, but I'd rather stick with "the big one" because:
- it makes it independent of the domain fan, which is symmetrical to `Sigma_s` not depending on the codomain fan;
- the corresponding variety will be a closed subvariety of the codomain;
- it is easier to implement/faster to compute;
- last but not least - I already have it in the patch ;-)

For fan morphisms I just added `__mul__` as they are standalone (although it may make sense to change that...), but toric morphisms should follow coercion rules, so implementing the double underscore method as it is done now is not acceptable. And even with it there is an issue of comparing, although it does seem that the result is correct.\n\nAnyway: let me know what you think of composition and if the rest looks OK!",

Anyway: let me know what you think of composition and if the rest looks OK!
