Working on #14909, we discovered some failing doctests for the GAP package GUAVA.  For example:

```
sage: F.<a> = GF(4)
sage: C = HammingCode(2,F)
sage: v = vector(F, [1,0,0,a,1])
sage: C.decode(v)
(a + 1, 0, 0, a, 1)
sage: C.decode(v, algorithm="nearest neighbor")
(a + 1, 0, 0, a, 1)
sage: C.decode(v, algorithm="guava")  # optional - gap_packages (Guava package)
BOOM!
```

There are other failures for `permutation_automorphism_group` too.
