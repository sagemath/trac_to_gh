I don't have any recent version of Sage installed -- do compositions now only accept valid input? In that case, this ticket is obsolete.

I was wrong, too bad.

The problem is still there in 5.12.beta5. It was only the ascii-art that was not able to draw these bad "compositions" !

So the ticket is open !

The thing that mainly surprises me is that

sage: Composition(a,b)
```
fails. Composition is such an overused term in mathematics that I think it's ill-advised to expose some specialist combinatorial notion of the term in the global scope.

sage: a=Hom(ZZ,ZZ)(1)
sage: b=Hom(ZZ,ZZ)(1)
sage: a*b
Ring endomorphism of Integer Ring
  Defn: 1 |--> 1

As there already is a really good way to compose maps in sage I don't find the argument for changing the meaning of `Composition` very compelling.

We don't, and the composition of maps can be obtained using `phi*psi` (which will have its own clashes if you want pointwise products for maps into a multiplicative group). However, the fact that the slot in the global namespace is in principle available doesn't imply it should be used for a special notion.

The title of the ticket already shows the confusion that can arise: The ticket complains that `Composition` is too lax with its argument checking and at the same time it seems `Composition` doesn't accept inputs that are perfectly valid for a mathematically widely accepted meaning of the word. 

Note that the full name is fine:

```
sage.combinat.composition.Composition
```
[Note that it is a function, not a class, by the way]. I just think it's inappropriate to import it into the global namespace under such a generic name. If you make that

```
from sage.combinat.composition import Composition as IntegerComposition
```
you should be fine and a lot less ambiguous already. With a system that is the scope of sage we really have to be careful with the global namespace. It is a very scarce resource.

I like `IntegerComposition`, by the way, and I don't think `Partition` is that problematic. If that becomes problematic, we can probably write a generic Partition routine to be imported in the global namespace that dispatches to the appropriate routine (IntegerPartition or SetPartition or whatever) based on type of the input parameters.

It is a class:

```
class Composition(CombinatorialObject, Element):
```

Shouldn't a function "composition" be written in lowercase?

Do you have timings to back that up? It shouldn't (depending on what "It" is).

If you mean using a `from ... import ... as ...` construction: that should lead to exactly the same performance. It just means the link in the relevant namespace dict is stored under a different key than would be chosen by default. There is no extra link step to follow.

If you mean the extra redirection in a global namespace generic dispatch routine: yes, that would have a bit of overhead. But that's always the case: it's much better to use specific routines, that are likely not available directly from the global namespace.

I wouldn't have expected this at first blush, but after reading `Composition.__classcall_private__` it's pretty obvious why
in terms of performance, `Composition` should not be called directly:

```
sage: timeit("Composition([1,2,3,4])",number=100000)
100000 loops, best of 3: 8.01 µs per loop
sage: timeit("Compositions()([1,2,3,4])",number=100000)
100000 loops, best of 3: 6.8 µs per loop
sage: C=Compositions()
sage: timeit("C([1,2,3,4])",number=100000)
100000 loops, best of 3: 4.64 µs per loop
```
so perhaps the best solution is indeed to deprecate `Composition` as an entry in the global namespace?

Note that the reported behaviour in the ticket still needs fixing. The currently attached patch doesn't solve the problem below. I expect that the fix has to go into the `__init__` rather than into the `classcall_private`.

```
sage: Compositions()('ASDF')
['A', 'S', 'D', 'F']
sage: Compositions()('ASDF').parent()
Compositions of non-negative integers

The weak compositions are suppose to be `IntegerVectors`, but as I recall, there is abuse of `Composition` as I believe those failing doctests imply.

Also I'm not against adding checks to `Composition`, but I do not want to change the name (including `Partition`).

I'm not sure what is slated for the tableaux rewrite (is this just the plan to move over to ClonableIntArray?), but from a representation theoretic perspective we should definitely allow the parts of compositions to be zero.
