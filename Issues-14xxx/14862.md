I don't have any recent version of Sage installed -- do compositions now only accept valid input? In that case, this ticket is obsolete.

Thanks, Christian

The problem is still there in 5.12.beta5. It was only the ascii-art that was not able to draw these bad "compositions" !

sage: a=Hom(ZZ,ZZ)(1)

sage: a*b
Ring endomorphism of Integer Ring

As there already is a really good way to compose maps in sage I don't find the argument for changing the meaning of `Composition` very compelling.

We don't, and the composition of maps can be obtained using `phi*psi` (which will have its own clashes if you want pointwise products for maps into a multiplicative group). However, the fact that the slot in the global namespace is in principle available doesn't imply it should be used for a special notion.

The title of the ticket already shows the confusion that can arise: The ticket complains that `Composition` is too lax with its argument checking and at the same time it seems `Composition` doesn't accept inputs that are perfectly valid for a mathematically widely accepted meaning of the word. 

Note that the full name is fine:

```
sage.combinat.composition.Composition
```
[Note that it is a function, not a class, by the way]. I just think it's inappropriate to import it into the global namespace under such a generic name. If you make that

```
from sage.combinat.composition import Composition as IntegerComposition
```
you should be fine and a lot less ambiguous already. With a system that is the scope of sage we really have to be careful with the global namespace. It is a very scarce resource.

I like `IntegerComposition`, by the way, and I don't think `Partition` is that problematic. If that becomes problematic, we can probably write a generic Partition routine to be imported in the global namespace that dispatches to the appropriate routine (IntegerPartition or SetPartition or whatever) based on type of the input parameters.

Do you have timings to back that up? It shouldn't (depending on what "It" is).

If you mean using a `from ... import ... as ...` construction: that should lead to exactly the same performance. It just means the link in the relevant namespace dict is stored under a different key than would be chosen by default. There is no extra link step to follow.

If you mean the extra redirection in a global namespace generic dispatch routine: yes, that would have a bit of overhead. But that's always the case: it's much better to use specific routines, that are likely not available directly from the global namespace.

<a id='comment:19'></a>I wouldn't have expected this at first blush, but after reading `Composition.__classcall_private__` it's pretty obvious why
in terms of performance, `Composition` should not be called directly:

```
sage: timeit("Composition([1,2,3,4])",number=100000)
100000 loops, best of 3: 8.01 µs per loop
sage: timeit("Compositions()([1,2,3,4])",number=100000)
100000 loops, best of 3: 6.8 µs per loop
sage: C=Compositions()
sage: timeit("C([1,2,3,4])",number=100000)
100000 loops, best of 3: 4.64 µs per loop
```
so perhaps the best solution is indeed to deprecate `Composition` as an entry in the global namespace?

Note that the reported behaviour in the ticket still needs fixing. The currently attached patch doesn't solve the problem below. I expect that the fix has to go into the `__init__` rather than into the `classcall_private`.

```
sage: Compositions()('ASDF')
['A', 'S', 'D', 'F']
sage: Compositions()('ASDF').parent()
Compositions of non-negative integers

I'm not sure what is slated for the tableaux rewrite (is this just the plan to move over to ClonableIntArray?), but from a representation theoretic perspective we should definitely allow the parts of compositions to be zero.
