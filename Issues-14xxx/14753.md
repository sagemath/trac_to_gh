There are some problems with generic binaries (`SAGE_FAT_BINARY=yes`) in the new ATLAS spkg. In order not to delay the release of Sage 5.10 any longer, I will revert #10508.

Fixing the issues below (and upgrading ATLAS to 3.10.x) is #14754.

On cicero (Fedora 16 i686), the build fails: [http://build.sagemath.org/sage/builders/Skynet%20cicero%20%28Fedora%2016%20i686%29%20bin/builds/90/steps/shell_5/logs/atlas](http://build.sagemath.org/sage/builders/Skynet%20cicero%20%28Fedora%2016%20i686%29%20bin/builds/90/steps/shell_5/logs/atlas)

Note the use of `-DATL_3DNow` and lots of "Illegal instruction" messages, proving that this likely is not a generic binary, unlike what it should be.

On arando (Ubuntu 13.04 i686), the build works but there is doctest failure:

The fact that 3DNow is used was discussed at #13706.

Of course we can remove that.

Jeroen: could you try to modify spkg-install: replace

```
isa_ext = ('3DNow',)
```
by

```
isa_ext = ()
```
on line 404 (in some version of the p0 spkg I have access to right now.)
It's in the configure_base function, the part about "Generic configuration on Intel i386 compatible CPUs"; and then try to rebuild on cicero? (I have no access to it)

I posted a spkg at #14754 doing that, I'll try it on cicero (a single-core Pentium 4 machine).

In any case, this will not change my decision to revert #10508. I want to release Sage 5.10 as soon as possible.
