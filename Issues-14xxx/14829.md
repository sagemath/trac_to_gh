This small package provides the functions `uniformizer_name` and `latex_uniformizer_name` that returns a "pretty" string/latex representation of the uniformizer of a discrete valuation ring/field (either a padic ring/field or a ring of Laurent series or a field of power series).

These functions can be useful because, in the padic world, a uniformizer prints itself together with some O(...).
