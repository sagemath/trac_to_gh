When doctesting Sage with #14136 the following `DeprecationWarning` appears:

`doctest:201: DeprecationWarning: object.__init__() takes no parameters`

which was reported on sage-devel ([https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/sage-devel/wQoCEeKrZ3w](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/sage-devel/wQoCEeKrZ3w)). The warning seems to be associated with the use of the `BoundClass` which inherits from  functools.partial ([https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/14136#comment:19](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/14136#comment:19)). The attached patch is an attempt to work around the warning.

This doesn't seem to break anything, and the failing patchbot test doesn't seem to be related and passed for me:

```
sage -t --long ../interfaces/expect.py
    [81 tests, 79.66 s]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Total time for all tests: 80.3 seconds
    cpu time: 1.6 seconds
```
So I'm giving this a positive review.

Quoth Nicolas (he just asked me to post this quote from one of his emails):

```
The warning comes when trying to
inherit from it functools.partial:


    sage: import warnings
    sage: warnings.simplefilter('error', DeprecationWarning)
    sage: import functools
    sage: def f(x): return x
    sage: g = functools.partial(f,1)
    sage: g()
    1
    sage: class mypartial(functools.partial):
    ....:     def __init__(self, f, i):
    ....:         functools.partial.__init__(self, f,i)
    sage: g = mypartial(f,1)
    Traceback (most recent call last)
    ...
    ----> 3                 functools.partial.__init__(self, f,i)
    DeprecationWarning: object.__init__() takes no parameters
    sage: g()
    1

I had never noticed this. Please explore for a good workaround!

Hey Steven,

Could you please format the doctests in the following format:

```
    Make sure classes which inherit from functools.partial have the correct syntax, see
    :trac:`14136` and :trac:`14748`::

        sage: import warnings
        sage: warnings.simplefilter('error', DeprecationWarning)
        sage: import functools
        sage: def f(x, y): return x^y
        sage: g = functools.partial(f, 2, 3)
        sage: g()
        8
```
In particular, there are 2 colons at the end of the text line and a blankline immediately following it. Also for the line above, I autolinked to the trac tickets which uses the syntax <code>:trac:\`12345\`</code>. Could you fix these?

Thanks,

Travis

Thanks Travis. Before I make changes, additionally what is the correct way to format the returned expression

```
----> 3         functools.partial.__init__(self, f, i, j)
```
The `----> 3` only appears when things are entered from the Sage prompt. I suspect it is ignored when doctesting. When doctesting a file that which is returned is something like

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
    functools.partial.__init__(self, f, i, j)
```
Doctesting seems to be insensitive to either of the above when comparing Expected: to Got: as long as there is some whitespace before

Insensitivity to the whitespace is the expected (and often useful) behavior. The correct way to return an error being raised is what you had (but it is generally at the same indentation level):

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
functools.partial.__init__(self, f, i, j)

The most important thing is that all tests pass when running `sage -t bindable_class.py`.

Best,
