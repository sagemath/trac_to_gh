right. I have added a reverse=True.

> * I am not sure that the ordering of the degrees in `.degree()` is the same as `g.vertices()`. You probably want to use `g.degree(labels =True)`.


That's of course safer. I'm now using the degree_iterator instead since .degree(labels=True) returns a dictionary. 

> * seen is a set, not a dictionary


I was wondering if it is faster to use a dict or a set in this case. I'm now using a set.

> * Why do you remove all this `h>=2` code ?


What we had before was incorrect. We were assuming that as soon as h>=2 it was not necessary to consider some vertices anymore (hence the h>=2 code). Since, we have proved that this is not true due to (a|b1,b2,b3) 4-tuples.

Now, the method is given a distance matrix and a set of vertices that we should not considered during computations. We order the pairs in such a way that pairs incident to vertices that should not be considered are above last_pair in the arrays. Observe that these orderings are done in linear time (in the number of pairs).

The other option was extract from the distance matrix the submatrix containing only distances between vertices we want to consider. I don't know which method is the fastest, but it was trivial to update the code the way I did it.

I'm just combining the cost of taking the subgraph with the cost of relabeling the vertices. I think it's overall faster than splitting the calls, even if the new relabel method is fast.


I'm now also improving upper bounds since delta <= D/2.

Thanks,

The "cuts+" algorithm is an approximation algorithm with additive constant one (ALG <= OPT <= ALG+1). Therefore, additive/multiplicative approx factors are irrelevant in this case.
However, these parameters are still used with the "cuts" version.

We could may be combine additive approx with "cuts+", for instance asking for "2*(additive_gap-1)". I'm not sure it is really interesting.

Does it make more sense?

When you remove simplicial vertices and compute the hyperbolicity on what is left you make an error of at most 1. Now, if you do not compute the hyperbolicity of what is left but if you just want an approximation of the hyperbolicity on what is left then you will compute this approximate hyperbolicity FASTER (because you do not have to go through all pairs), and you will get a lower bound `hyp` and an upper bound `ub`. Hence, because you first removed simplicial vertices, what you can say for sure is that the hyperbolicity of your graph is between `hyp` andd `ub+1`.\n\nWith what you do, it looks like you force the computation of the exact hyperbolicity on the reduced graph, which can take a lot of time.

Yep. But the code did something different.

> I have now implemented a set of modifications to use the additive_gap with 'cuts+' and updated documentation accordingly.


Cool. Could you also add a doctest for `algorithm="dom"` ? It looks like there's a bug there :

```
sage: g = graphs.PetersenGraph()
sage: hyperbolicity(g,algorithm="dom")
(0, [], 0)
```

I would say that the dominating set has `<4` vertices. Note that it isn't a problem per se, but the upper bound is clearly wrong.

Bloody hell, the Petersen!

The `__hyperbolicity__` method was implicitly assuming that delta(G)>0 since graphs such that delta(G)=0 are tested before. But with 'dom' the situation may happen. I have added what is needed to prevent such problem (also with cuts+).

Should be better now.

Why do you add more code ? I don't get it. The fact that there is no quadruple in the answer to Petersen's graph hyperbolicity is not a problem as the lower bound is zero. The only problem is that the upper bound is 8 ! You just had to test this case before returning the result, didn't you ?
