```

The original ticket description whose case does work now:

This is so trivial that I am surprised this bug even exists. :) Present since at least sage-5.2 till present versions.

The following integral works

```
H = exp(-x)
H.integral(x, 0, 1)

-e^(-1) + 1
```

But the following integral errors out

```
H = exp(-1.0 * x)
H.integral(x, 0, 1)

Almost certainly the same error (see [this sage-support thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-support/zpbCOeljVqI):

```
sage: integral(exp(-300.0/(-0.064*x+14.0)),x,0.0,120.0) 
```
and also [this ask.sagemath question](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/2028/def-fx-evaluvates-individually-but-not-inside-plot).

The real underlying issue is the one [at this Maxima bug](https://sourceforge.net/p/maxima/bugs/2510/); basically, we use `keepfloat:true` in Maxima so that things like the integral of `e<sup>(-x</sup>2)` come out right, but this causes things to go wrong in these examples.

And [Nils' comment](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/JZ54xk51F-E) still applies, that it's not clear why something with a float in it should be integrated symbolically (rather than numerically) at all.  I think this is an important point, though I'm not sure how to resolve it in such a ridiculously simple case as yours.  Note that I updated the Maxima bug, and with `keepfloat:false` it is ridiculously accurate as a float.

That said, we should still have a better error message, and ideally just a correct answer.

Wait, I'm confused.  What does the value of the derivative have to do with `keepfloat` and this behavior?  

```
sage: H = exp(-.00001*x)
sage: H.integral(x,0,1)
<same error>
sage: plot(H,(x,0,1),ymin=0)
<essentially constant plot>
```

The reason why Nils and others consider this to be close to user error is that it's not clear what a non-numerical integral of an integral with floats in it should mean.  The indefinite integral would be inaccurate by definition.  Or am I misrepresenting something, Nils?

One possible workaround I see is that we could catch this error and ask the user whether they wanted a numerical integral, or even return a numerical integral.    We haven't seen this in circumstances without exponentials of floats.

When running the following cell:


```
u(x,t)=0;
for n in [1..10]:
    u=u+exp(-n^2*(pi^2/4)*t)*sin(n*(pi/4)*x);
plot(u(x,1.80),(0,4))
```

The output presents a sinus like curve with huge amplitude for t = 1.80, 1.79 or 1.78. This cannot be, for the exponential should make the values very small.

It seems to me a problem with the evaluation of the exponential for these  values. What am I missing?

I added a doctest for this and rebased on 9.3b5, so I hope we can close this old ticket.

The issue in [comment:14](#comment%3A14) is invalid. The plot has an amplitude of approximately 0.12, which is correct.  The only reason it looks large in the picture is that the y-axis has been scaled to fit the graph.
