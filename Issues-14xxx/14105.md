Hellooooooooooooo !!

What would you think of setting `int_colors = True` to be the default ? Actually, what would you think of renaming this argument as `hex_colors = False` (as it already appears in other coloring functions) ?

Btw, lines have to be 80 characters long at most.

Have fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuunnn ! `:-)`

Hello,

Thanks for the comment. I changed the path so that the default is hex_colors = False. 

There is another option count_only=False which returns a generator that just returns 1. Shouldn't this just return the number of colorings?

Indeed ! I guess that the best is to add a counter inside of the function, and return the result once all the colorings have been listed.
