This patch implements height functionality from the initial dynamics functionality problems proposed at the 2012 ICERM semester in Complex and Arithmetic dynamics.

Builds on Trac #13130 and Trac #14217

Implements height functionality:

* height of points
* height of morphisms
* local green's functions
* canonical heights

Fixed all the issues described above. The only change of note was that fixing the 'precision' keyword required more than just a rename. The use of the precision needed to be included throughout the green's function computation.

Since that patchbot seems to be trying to apply the patches from the *closed* dependencies #13130 and #14217, I've removed those from the dependency field. Hopefully that will allow the patchbot to test this patch.

```

This actually shows a bigger problem: it shows that some computations depend on machine floats and therefore are done only to 53 bits precision. In the code I see:

```
RealField(prec)(log(m))
```
this should be

```
RealField(prec)(m).log()
```
(the best solution to avoid this is simply removing `from math import log`)

Also, I recommend you to write *once*

```
R = RealField(prec)
```
and then use `R(a)` every where.

Also, comparisons to `None` should be done with `is`: `a is None` or `a is not None`.

Hello,

I have added a patch which mainly cleans the doc a little bit.

for the patchbot:

apply trac_14218_heights.patch trac_14218_remove_imports.patch trac_14218_addon1.patch

By the way, did you know that you could run your own patchbot on your own tickets instead of waiting for the bot of someone else ?
