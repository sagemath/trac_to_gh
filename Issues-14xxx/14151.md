GMP-ECM 6.4.4 is available at
[https://gforge.inria.fr/frs/download.php/32159/ecm-6.4.4.tar.gz](https://gforge.inria.fr/frs/download.php/32159/ecm-6.4.4.tar.gz).

With respect to 6.3 currently used in Sage:

```

Hi Paul,

Hi Leif,

I wonder how sse2 can be enabled on a Pentium3, since configure.in only enables it (when not requested by the user) for `pentium4-*-* | viac7-*-* | i686-*-* | i786-*-*`.

Unless we have a concrete example of a computer where it fails, I'm reluctant to add a patch one could not test.

Replying to [@zimmermann6](#comment%3A3):
> I wonder how sse2 can be enabled on a Pentium3, since configure.in only enables it (when not requested by the user) for `pentium4-*-* | viac7-*-* | i686-*-* | i786-*-*`.

Hmmm, it seems somehow `pentium3-*` gets mapped to `i686-*`, which then triggers the use of SSE2 (if "supported"; the test apparently doesn't try to *run* a program with SSE2 instructions, as mentioned).

Just tried configuring GMP-ECM 6.4.4-rc2 on a Pentium4 (i.e., a 32-bit machine) with `--target=pentium3-linux-gnu`, which results in

```

(Similar for `--build=pentium3-linux-gnu`, and `configure ... pentium3-linux-gnu`.)


> Unless we have a concrete example of a computer where it fails, I'm reluctant to add a patch one could not test.

Well, it's a minor issue, and we could probably also work around that in Sage's `spkg-install`, at least for the moment...

(I guess not many people will use a "stand-alone" GMP-ECM on such old processors. ;-) )

Leif, `configure --target=...` is not valid, see `configure --help`, you should use either
`--build=...` or `--host=...`

Note that your run did choose Pentium4 as target and not Pentium3:

That doesn't really matter, i.e., same with `--host=...` or just the (deprecated) `pentium3-pc-linux-gnu` parameter.  (It always gets mapped to "checking host system type... i686-pc-linux-gnu", although `configure` is also "checking for pentium3-pc-linux-gnu-gcc... gcc-4.4.3".)

Quick check on configure --help..... This is automagic detection, as a Gentoo packager of ecm I object. Furthermore the test is for a generic cblas function (I know generic detection of blas into autoconf is not trivial). It would be better to provide a --with-cblas switch on which you could pass appropriate linking flags for cblas. 

I am done with the packaging rant.

FWIW, GMP-ECM's `config.guess`/`config.sub` and `configure[.in]` are currently at least inconsistent (which can be seen without having access to a Pentium III ;-) ).

* `config.guess` on my Pentium 4 yields `i686-...`, not `pentium4-...`.

* `config.sub` canonicalizes `{pentium2,pentiumii,pentium3,pentiumiii}-*` to `i686-*` (and `pentium4-*` to `i786-*`, as mentioned).

* `configure[.in]` uses `$host` (rather than `$host_alias`), which in the relevant checks is -- as is -- always the *canonicalized* name (which especially means `i686-*` on Pentium II and III machines), such that any test for (e.g.) `pentium3-*` or `pentium4-*` can never match.

* The SSE2 test doesn't try to *execute* SSE2 instructions, even when not cross-compiling.

leif@restless:~/src$ gmp-5.1.1/config.guess 
pentium4-pc-linux-gnu
leif@restless:~/src$ ecm-6.4.4-rc2/config.guess 
i686-pc-linux-gnu
leif@restless:~/src$ gmp-5.1.1/config.sub pentium3-linux-gnu
pentium3-pc-linux-gnu
leif@restless:~/src$ ecm-6.4.4-rc2/config.sub pentium3-linux-gnu
i686-pc-linux-gnu
leif@restless:~/src$ gmp-5.1.1/config.sub pentium4-linux-gnu
pentium4-pc-linux-gnu
leif@restless:~/src$ ecm-6.4.4-rc2/config.sub pentium4-linux-gnu
i786-pc-linux-gnu
```

So yes, you could probably take both from GMP 5.1.1.




> Does $host_alias give pentium4-... on your Pentium 4?

`host_alias` contains the name specified on the command line, so it contains `pentium4-*` (only) if I explicitly configure with `[--host=]pentium4-linux-gnu`.  (It's otherwise empty.)

sorry Francois was quicker than myself. Here are my 2 cents.

In SPKG.txt:

```
 * We currently work around a linker bug on MacOS X 10.5 PPC (with
   GCC 4.2.1) which breaks 'configure' if debug symbols are enabled.
   This *might* get fixed in later upstream releases.
```
Is that still true, since there is no patch any more?

I notice you don't run "make check". It is highly recommended (maybe in a
future revision of the spkg), especially since spkg-install uses different
values of CC/CFLAGS than the upstream package would choose.

I believe it is fixed as from the description of the patch:

```
* configure.patch: 
 	   - Disable "asm-redc" on 32-bit Darwin PPCs (upstream revision 1516 / bug 
 	     #10646). 
 	     (Note that this upstream patch is likely to slow down GMP-ECM on 64-bit 
 	     PPC CPUs running (32-bit) MacOS X, since the extended instruction set of 
 	     the CPU is no longer exploitet.  A proper fix would just pass an option 
 	     to Apple's assembler to allow the use of the extended instruction set.)   
	 	   - Fix compilation error on x86 CPUs supporting SSE2. (Sage trac #10252, 
 	     upstream revision 1546). 
```
So there is mention of two revisions in gmp-ecm taking care of the problem from that patch. But good spotting, SPKG.txt needs cleaning to remove that statement.

In this case checks are run if SAGE_CHECK is set during building. There are few spkg where the test suite is systematically run. I guess there would be a call for it if the packge was troublesome on a regular basis.

The comment referred to the following part of `spkg-install` (which is still in, and presumably still necessary -- perhaps ask Dima, so should have been kept):

```sh
    case "`uname -srm | tr ' ' '-'`" in
        Darwin-9*-[Pp]ower*)
            # Don't add debug symbols because configure otherwise
            # fails due to a bus error in Apple's 'ld' when trying
            # to determine if global symbols are prefixed with an
            # underscore (cf. https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/5847#comment:35 ff.):
            echo >&2 "Warning: Disabling debug symbols on MacOS X 10.5" \
                "PowerPC because of a linker (?) bug."
            echo >&2 "See https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/5847#comment:35" \
                "ff. for details."
            echo >&2
            CFLAGS="-O3 $CFLAGS"
            ;;
        *)
            CFLAGS="-g -O3 $CFLAGS"
    esac
```

By the way, the attached diff doesn't reflect the latest spkg version.

I am looking at it. Remarks so far:

* properly link without adding extra `-lgmp` flags :) 
* still issues when assembly is enabled if you don't add `-Wl,-z,noexecstack` to `LDFLAGS` :(

```
 * QA Notice: The following files contain writable and executable sections
 *  Files with such sections will not work properly (or at all!) on some

 * 
 *  Please include the following list of files in your report:
 *  Note: Bugs should be filed for the respective maintainers
 *  of the package in question and not hardened@g.o.
 * RWX --- --- usr/lib64/libecm.so.0.0.0
```
* testsuite fails here (log on request) with or without asm-redc :(

Now I will test drive sage with it.

the -cofdec option was removed in GMP-ECM 7.0, thus it should be disabled in the Sage interface.

And my comment [comment:44] was before the rc2 was out.

I have increased the version info to 1.0.0.
