Hi Leif,

I wonder how sse2 can be enabled on a Pentium3, since configure.in only enables it (when not requested by the user) for `pentium4-*-* | viac7-*-* | i686-*-* | i786-*-*`.

Unless we have a concrete example of a computer where it fails, I'm reluctant to add a patch one could not test.

Hmmm, it seems somehow `pentium3-*` gets mapped to `i686-*`, which then triggers the use of SSE2 (if "supported"; the test apparently doesn't try to *run* a program with SSE2 instructions, as mentioned).

Just tried configuring GMP-ECM 6.4.4-rc2 on a Pentium4 (i.e., a 32-bit machine) with `--target=pentium3-linux-gnu`, which results in

```

(Similar for `--build=pentium3-linux-gnu`, and `configure ... pentium3-linux-gnu`.)

Well, it's a minor issue, and we could probably also work around that in Sage's `spkg-install`, at least for the moment...

(I guess not many people will use a "stand-alone" GMP-ECM on such old processors. ;-) )

That doesn't really matter, i.e., same with `--host=...` or just the (deprecated) `pentium3-pc-linux-gnu` parameter.  (It always gets mapped to "checking host system type... i686-pc-linux-gnu", although `configure` is also "checking for pentium3-pc-linux-gnu-gcc... gcc-4.4.3".)

Actually, GMP-ECM's `config.sub` "canonicalizes" `pentium3-*` (as well as `pentium2-*` and similar) to `i686-*`, so i686 is not sufficient to assume SSE2 support.  (`pentium4-*` gets `i786-*`.)

Quick check on configure --help..... This is automagic detection, as a Gentoo packager of ecm I object. Furthermore the test is for a generic cblas function (I know generic detection of blas into autoconf is not trivial). It would be better to provide a --with-cblas switch on which you could pass appropriate linking flags for cblas.

FWIW, GMP-ECM's `config.guess`/`config.sub` and `configure[.in]` are currently at least inconsistent (which can be seen without having access to a Pentium III ;-) ).

* `config.guess` on my Pentium 4 yields `i686-...`, not `pentium4-...`.

* `config.sub` canonicalizes `{pentium2,pentiumii,pentium3,pentiumiii}-*` to `i686-*` (and `pentium4-*` to `i786-*`, as mentioned).

* `configure[.in]` uses `$host` (rather than `$host_alias`), which in the relevant checks is -- as is -- always the *canonicalized* name (which especially means `i686-*` on Pentium II and III machines), such that any test for (e.g.) `pentium3-*` or `pentium4-*` can never match.

* The SSE2 test doesn't try to *execute* SSE2 instructions, even when not cross-compiling.

pentium4-pc-linux-gnu
leif@restless:~/src$ ecm-6.4.4-rc2/config.guess

pentium4-pc-linux-gnu
leif@restless:~/src$ ecm-6.4.4-rc2/config.sub pentium4-linux-gnu

```

So yes, you could probably take both from GMP 5.1.1.




> Does $host_alias give pentium4-... on your Pentium 4?


`host_alias` contains the name specified on the command line, so it contains `pentium4-*` (only) if I explicitly configure with `[--host=]pentium4-linux-gnu`.  (It's otherwise empty.)

sorry Francois was quicker than myself. Here are my 2 cents.

In SPKG.txt:

```
 * We currently work around a linker bug on MacOS X 10.5 PPC (with
   GCC 4.2.1) which breaks 'configure' if debug symbols are enabled.
   This *might* get fixed in later upstream releases.
```
Is that still true, since there is no patch any more?

I notice you don't run "make check". It is highly recommended (maybe in a
future revision of the spkg), especially since spkg-install uses different
values of CC/CFLAGS than the upstream package would choose.

I believe it is fixed as from the description of the patch:

```
* configure.patch: 
 	   - Disable "asm-redc" on 32-bit Darwin PPCs (upstream revision 1516 / bug 
 	     #10646). 
 	     (Note that this upstream patch is likely to slow down GMP-ECM on 64-bit 
 	     PPC CPUs running (32-bit) MacOS X, since the extended instruction set of 
 	     the CPU is no longer exploitet.  A proper fix would just pass an option 
 	     to Apple's assembler to allow the use of the extended instruction set.)   
	 	   - Fix compilation error on x86 CPUs supporting SSE2. (Sage trac #10252, 
 	     upstream revision 1546). 
```
So there is mention of two revisions in gmp-ecm taking care of the problem from that patch. But good spotting, SPKG.txt needs cleaning to remove that statement.

In this case checks are run if SAGE_CHECK is set during building. There are few spkg where the test suite is systematically run. I guess there would be a call for it if the packge was troublesome on a regular basis.

*"We work around ..."* != *"We patch ...*", and the comment was in "Special !Update/Build Instructions", not its "Patches" subsection.

The comment referred to the following part of `spkg-install` (which is still in, and presumably still necessary -- perhaps ask Dima, so should have been kept):

```sh
    case "`uname -srm | tr ' ' '-'`" in
        Darwin-9*-[Pp]ower*)
            # Don't add debug symbols because configure otherwise
            # fails due to a bus error in Apple's 'ld' when trying
            # to determine if global symbols are prefixed with an
            # underscore (cf. http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/5847#comment:35 ff.):
            echo >&2 "Warning: Disabling debug symbols on MacOS X 10.5" \
                "PowerPC because of a linker (?) bug."
            echo >&2 "See http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/5847#comment:35" \
                "ff. for details."
            echo >&2
            CFLAGS="-O3 $CFLAGS"
            ;;
        *)
            CFLAGS="-g -O3 $CFLAGS"
    esac
```

By the way, the attached diff doesn't reflect the latest spkg version.

a release candidate for GMP-ECM is available.
See https://lists.gforge.inria.fr/pipermail/ecm-discuss/2016-February/004328.html.
It would be nice if someone could try it within Sage.

```

 * RWX --- --- usr/lib64/libecm.so.0.0.0

* testsuite fails here (log on request) with or without asm-redc :(

Now I will test drive sage with it.

I have increased the version info to 1.0.0.
