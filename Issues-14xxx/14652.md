I am not sure I should post this here or on #14014 but ...

With #14014 it now takes a long time the first time one creates a matrix group:

```
sage: %time WeylGroup(["A",3]) 
CPU times: user 10.10 s, sys: 0.11 s, total: 10.21 s
Wall time: 10.23 s
```

I guess that's the time needed to start gap. This feels like a lot
though, and is quite annoying.

Note that just starting gap takes roughly half of that time::

```
mistral-~s/sage/algebras>time (echo "quit;" | sage -gap)
gap: halving pool size.
 ┌───────┐   GAP, Version 4.5.7 of 14-Dec-2012 (free software, GPL)
 │  GAP  │   http://www.gap-system.org
 └───────┘   Architecture: x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu-gcc-default64
 Libs used:  gmp, readline
 Loading the library and packages ...
 ...
5,44s user 0,16s system 98% cpu 5,661 total
```

And before #10414, starting Sage *and* creating a Weyl group took far less time:

```
time (echo "WeylGroup(['A',3])" | ../../sage)
...
sage: WeylGroup(['A',3])
Weyl Group of type ['A', 3] (as a matrix group acting on the ambient space)
Exiting Sage (CPU time 0m0.30s, Wall time 0m0.29s).
( echo "WeylGroup(['A',3])" | ../../sage; )  3,04s user 0,54s system 89% cpu 3,998 total
```


Well, the above measurement are probably very rough, but this still
seems to be saying that there would be room for improvement. Does
libgap load by default more libraries and packages than the usual gap
loaded in Sage?

Cheers,
                            Nicolas
