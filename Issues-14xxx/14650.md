> The license must be a GPL version 3 compatible license.

I think it would be helpful (just in that one spot, not elsewhere where the context is clearer) to say that this means it has to be a license which can be included in GPL v3, not a license under which GPL v3 code can be included.  Unless that it universally what "compatible" means.  My sense is that this is not the case, based on having read many confused people's emails on this over the years.
