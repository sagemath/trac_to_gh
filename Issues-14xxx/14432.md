The following code raises an exception

```
sage: S=Set(ZZ).union(Set([infinity]))
sage: hash(S)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
RuntimeError: maximum recursion depth exceeded
```

The same should happen for intersections, differences, and symmetric differences.

To test hashing, it is better to do tests like `hash(s) == hash(s)` that do not depend upon the specific value but instead show that the object is hashable and it's value does not change.
