Minimal test case:

```
sage: import sympy
sage: SR(sympy.RisingFactorial(x,x))
AttributeError: 'RisingFactorial' object has no attribute '_sage_'
sage: SR(sympy.FallingFactorial(x,x))
AttributeError: 'FallingFactorial' object has no attribute '_sage_'
```
Original ticket description:

This is related to #14437:

```
sage: from sympy import Function, Symbol
sage: u = Function('u')
sage: n = Symbol('n', integer=True)
sage: from sympy import rsolve
sage: f = u(n+2) - u(n+1) + u(n)/4
sage: rsolve(f,u(n))
2**(-n)*C0*RisingFactorial(C0/C1 + 1, n)/RisingFactorial(C0/C1, n)
```
The result returned by `rsolve` is a SymPy object:

```
sage: s = rsolve(f,u(n))
sage: type(s)
<class 'sympy.core.mul.Mul'>
```
Ideally, it should be automatically converted to Sage.

However, if we try to convert it manually, we get:

```
sage: s._sage_()

```
so apparently there was some extra simplification that should have happened.  Doesn't mean this ticket is invalid, of course.

I tried adding a doctest with those commands:

```
$ git clone git://git.sagemath.org/sage.git
$ cd sage
$ git branch u/zimmerma/14446
$ git co u/zimmerma/14446
$ patch -p1 -i /tmp/patch
$ git commit -a
$ git push --set-upstream origin u/zimmerma/14446
```
but it failed with:

```
$ git push --set-upstream origin u/zimmerma/14446
fatal: remote error: access denied or repository not exported: /sage.git
```
Am I doing something wrong?

For the record:

```

That is very interesting.  Is it possible to have this sympy file doctested whenever *Sage* runs doctests?  (I don't know how many people would run the package doctests, and in any case this probably isn't automatically tested as easily within sympy itself.)  That would be very helpful.

Just copy it at SymPy installation time into `src/sage/tests`.

You're right. Their Travis doesn't have a Sage installation AFAIK.

So I opened #23960.
