Minimal test case:

```
sage: import sympy
sage: SR(sympy.RisingFactorial(x,x))
AttributeError: 'RisingFactorial' object has no attribute '_sage_'
sage: SR(sympy.FallingFactorial(x,x))
AttributeError: 'FallingFactorial' object has no attribute '_sage_'
```
Original ticket description:

This is related to #14437:

```
sage: from sympy import Function, Symbol
sage: u = Function('u')
sage: n = Symbol('n', integer=True)
sage: from sympy import rsolve
sage: f = u(n+2) - u(n+1) + u(n)/4
sage: rsolve(f,u(n))
2**(-n)*C0*RisingFactorial(C0/C1 + 1, n)/RisingFactorial(C0/C1, n)
```
The result returned by `rsolve` is a SymPy object:

```
sage: s = rsolve(f,u(n))
sage: type(s)
<class 'sympy.core.mul.Mul'>
```
Ideally, it should be automatically converted to Sage.

However, if we try to convert it manually, we get:

```
sage: s._sage_()

I tried adding a doctest with those commands:

```
$ git clone git://git.sagemath.org/sage.git
$ cd sage
$ git branch u/zimmerma/14446
$ git co u/zimmerma/14446
$ patch -p1 -i /tmp/patch
$ git commit -a
$ git push --set-upstream origin u/zimmerma/14446
```
but it failed with:

```
$ git push --set-upstream origin u/zimmerma/14446
fatal: remote error: access denied or repository not exported: /sage.git
```
Am I doing something wrong?

For the record:

```

Just copy it at SymPy installation time into `src/sage/tests`.

You're right. Their Travis doesn't have a Sage installation AFAIK.

So I opened #23960.
