It looks like there is more numerical noise than expected.
Changing 1e-14 to 1e-13 might be a sensible solution.

I've not looked at the code, so I don't know if we really expect the coefficients rounded to zero to be less than 1e-14, or if that's just an arbitrary bound which looked close enough to zero.

Please note this happened with ATLAS 3.10.1.p0 from #10508 which may be used in the linear algebra step of the algorithm.

And the bound seems quite random, at least there is no justification for this choice, nor a precise error bounding stated anywhere.
