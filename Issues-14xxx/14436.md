It looks like there is more numerical noise than expected.
Changing 1e-14 to 1e-13 might be a sensible solution.

<a id='comment:3'></a>Please note this happened with ATLAS 3.10.1.p0 from #10508 which may be used in the linear algebra step of the algorithm.

And the bound seems quite random, at least there is no justification for this choice, nor a precise error bounding stated anywhere.
