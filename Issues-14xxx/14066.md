quit = "Use Ctrl-D (i.e. EOF), %Exit, or %Quit to exit without confirmation."

(That is, call `run_cell` on the contents of the init file, instead of calling `run_cell(%%run ...)` on the init file itself.)

I've noticed that attach no longer works. It says it's been deprecated and to use %attach, but then this appears to have a bug.

If I have a file "test.py" which contains one line

print "hello"

then when I attach:

%attach 'test.py'

then it prints hello. But if I rewrite the line to:

print "hey"

and then hit enter on sage, it doesn't print anything.

I think that `%attach` sort of works, maybe even mostly works, but printing does not. If my file contains the line `a=3`:

```
sage: %attach test.py
sage: a
3
sage: # now I edit test.py to say a=12.0
sage: a
12.0
```
Function definitions get updated just fine, but as you point out, print statements don't seem to work right. What else needs to be tested to know if print statements are the only issue?

Note that if I attach a file with print statements, then change it, then attach it again, the print statements appear twice. So I think the change is being detected, but the output isn't showing up when it should.

I don't quite understand what the problem is. Is it a problem that simply hitting ENTER doesn't reload the file, that the file is only reloaded before executing an actual command?

Because other than that, I find that `%attach` works fine. So, I'm willing to give this positive_review.
