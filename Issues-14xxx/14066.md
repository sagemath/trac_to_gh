<a id='comment:15'></a>I've noticed that attach no longer works. It says it's been deprecated and to use %attach, but then this appears to have a bug.

If I have a file "test.py" which contains one line

print "hello"

then when I attach:

%attach 'test.py'

then it prints hello. But if I rewrite the line to:

print "hey"

and then hit enter on sage, it doesn't print anything.

I don't quite understand what the problem is. Is it a problem that simply hitting ENTER doesn't reload the file, that the file is only reloaded before executing an actual command?

Because other than that, I find that `%attach` works fine. So, I'm willing to give this positive_review.
