For (1): In devel/sage/sage/all.py, we find this code at the very top:

```
# Error message that matches the Sage/IPython defaults
quit = "Use Ctrl-D (i.e. EOF), %Exit, or %Quit to exit without confirmation."
exit = quit
```
Who put that there?  Deleting those lines restores exit and quit to act just as expected.

I've noticed that attach no longer works. It says it's been deprecated and to use %attach, but then this appears to have a bug.

If I have a file "test.py" which contains one line

print "hello"

then when I attach:

%attach 'test.py'

then it prints hello. But if I rewrite the line to:

print "hey"

and then hit enter on sage, it doesn't print anything.

I don't quite understand what the problem is. Is it a problem that simply hitting ENTER doesn't reload the file, that the file is only reloaded before executing an actual command?
