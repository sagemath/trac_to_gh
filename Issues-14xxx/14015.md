Hey Volker,

Here's a rebased version with my review changes. I've removed the need for the `*_generic` classes and made the docstrings be at the class level so that they are visible using introspection. I've also added a method to get the lifted matrix space (representation of affine transformations as linear transformations) as `linear_space()`, and made a few docstring tweaks. If you're happy with my changes, you can set this to positive review.

Best,

Travis
