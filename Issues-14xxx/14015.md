Hey Volker,

Here's a rebased version with my review changes. I've removed the need for the `*_generic` classes and made the docstrings be at the class level so that they are visible using introspection. I've also added a method to get the lifted matrix space (representation of affine transformations as linear transformations) as `linear_space()`, and made a few docstring tweaks. If you're happy with my changes, you can set this to positive review.

Best,

Travis

In terms of complexity / lines of code, I think its pretty much a draw. Which is to say, you end up using a lot of complicated machinery for no real advantage. And it gets even more complicated if you start deriving the class. And it breaks the symmetry between different implementations. If I had seen a real advantage with the `__classcall__` mechanism then I would have used it myself.",

And you need some way to circumvent the enforced argument normalization for internal use where you know that the arguments don't have to be normalized. In terms of complexity / lines of code, I think its pretty much a draw. Which is to say, you end up using a lot of complicated machinery for no real advantage. And it gets even more complicated if you start deriving the class. And it breaks the symmetry between different implementations. If I had seen a real advantage with the `__classcall__` mechanism then I would have used it myself.
