Right now, when we try to convert elements between free groups, they just get converted to the Tietze list, forgeting about the names of the generators. This can cause strange behaviour like: 

```
sage: F.<a,b>=FreeGroup()
sage: G.<b,a>=FreeGroup()
sage: F(a) 
b
```

This patch solves this, looking for generators with matching names.

Hello,

I created a branch from the ticket with `sage -dev`. The review can starts from there.

What's the point of the following code in `_element_constructor_`?

```
if hasattr(P, '_freegroup_'):
    if P.FreeGroup() is self:
        return self.element_class(self, x.Tietze(), **kwds)
```
As far as I looked, there is no object in Sage with a `_freegroup_` attribute.

It is an error. It should be _free_group (finitely presented groups have that attribute, that contains the free group after which they are defined).


Apparently it works even without that because the element_class init first tries to get the Tietze list anyways.
