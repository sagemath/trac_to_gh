During Sage installation, I sometimes see an spkg fail to build, for example [zn_poly](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/13947). Then I run

```
$ ./sage -i spkg/standard/zn_poly-0.9.p10.spkg
```
If this installs successfully, it still has a return code of 127 (on OS X, at least), because the installation runs `sage-location` at the end, which hasn't been installed yet. So perhaps `sage -i ...` should only run `sage-location` if it already exists.  This way something like

```
$ make || ./sage -i spkg/standard/zn_poly-0.9.p10.spkg && make ptestlong
```

might work the way I want, and building Sage would require less babysitting.

Here's a first patch. I wouldn't be surprised if there were better ways of doing this.

You should check Python also. I would go for

```
if [ -x "$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/python" -a -x "$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/sage-location" ]
```

Just for completeness, you could also use the more "Pythonic"

```
sage-location
status=$?
if [ $status -eq 126 -o $status -eq 127 ]; then
    # Python or sage-location doesn't exist
    exit 0
fi
exit $status
```
but I wouldn't, since it might use system Python if Sage's Python isn't installed and you would still an error message if it fails to run `sage-location`.
