It's done too late in spkg/base/prereq-1.1-install.
Around line 134, one already tries to untar the prereq tarball which will fail with the Sun tar (at least on the Solaris I have access to... I just get "nothing" after tar completed) and exit without giving much clue (the cd command will fail as the directory does not exists).
The tests are only done around line 264.
