Succeeded with `SAGE_CHECK=yes` on SunOS 5.10 UltraSPARC III (ABI=32) with GCC 4.7.0 as well as GCC 4.7.2, modulo the usual expected three segfaults:

```
./check-subst
Segmentation Fault - core dumped
Segmentation Fault - core dumped
Segmentation Fault - core dumped
```

I haven't rebuilt anything *depending on iconv* though.

Is that documented somewhere?
