Indeed, thanks.
I only tested it builds on Cygwin64, not on anything else yet.

Succeeded with `SAGE_CHECK=yes` on SunOS 5.10 UltraSPARC III (ABI=32) with GCC 4.7.0 as well as GCC 4.7.2, modulo the usual expected three segfaults:

```
./check-subst
Segmentation Fault - core dumped
Segmentation Fault - core dumped
Segmentation Fault - core dumped
```

I haven't rebuilt anything *depending on iconv* though.

IIRC I at least successfully rebuilt MPIR (which depends on iconv) afterwards.

Yes.

Just a matter of time (and my ability to keep this ticket in mind).

Slight modifications to `spkg-install` and `spkg-check` may be possible, but since you didn't touch them at all ...

Assuming you've successfully tested it on Cygwin![64], positive review.




Out of curiosity, how does Cygwin64 identify itself (`uname`, Sage's `$UNAME`)?
