Because of some weird graphs built by ennemies of The Good Graph People, it seems that most of the work done by GenericGraph.relabel() is totally useless.
This patch adds two optional arguments to this method, which let the users enable/disable tests.

A timing, just for the show :

Before :

```
sage: g = graphs.KneserGraph(11,4)
sage: %time g.relabel()           
CPU times: user 0.37 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.37 s
Wall time: 0.37 s
```

After :

```
sage: g = graphs.KneserGraph(11,4)
sage: %time g.relabel()           
CPU times: user 0.01 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.01 s
Wall time: 0.01 s
```

Ready for review again ! `;-)`

Precisely ! I wrote that in the doctest itself :

"Checking that all vertices have an image can require some time, and this feature can be disabled (at your own risk)"

If you "rename" the vertices of a graph in such a way that two vertices end up having the same name at the end of the procedure, I can totally imagine that some data will be lost on the way `:-P`
