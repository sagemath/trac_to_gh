The theory behind it is explained in Britz-Fomin, arXiv:9912126 (and briefly discussed in EC1, exercise 77 in chapter 3). It is a map associating to any poset P a partition \lambda(P) of |P|. For P being a permutation poset, this partition is the shape of the RSK tableaux of the permutation; the tableaux themselves can also be reconstructed by taking the sequences of \lambda(P_i) where P_i are the initial resp. final intervals of P.

This functionality appears in Macaulay ( http://www.math.uiuc.edu/Macaulay2/doc/Macaulay2-1.5/share/doc/Macaulay2/Posets/html/_greene__Kleitman__Partition.html ) but is apparently not exposed in Sage. I also don't like the Macaulay implementation, since (as far as I understand the sourcecode at http://www.math.uiuc.edu/Macaulay2/doc/Macaulay2-1.5/share/Macaulay2/Posets.m2 ) it goes by brute force despite the existence of a polynomial-time algorithm.

So I've implemented the algorithm given in Britz-Fomin.

greene_shape is the most important method here. The stuff after it is what I needed for checks; maybe it has its use too, but I wouldn't expect too much.

Hey I've uploaded a review patch which fixes up some of the documenation. The doc of `_ford_fulkerson_chronicle` will still need to be standardized following [the conventions page](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/conventions.html).

As for the potential conflect with #14136, I was able to apply this after but has some fuzz. All that means is it will need a `qrefresh` to be run.

Also the first patch is missing a commit message. Let me know when these are done and I can give it another code review. I'd prefer if someone else (Frederic) can give this a math review.

Best,

Thanks a lot for the comments, Travis!

I've uploaded a new patch [trac_14131-greene_shape_v2.patch], which contains both of our changes and a few more. I've standardized the docstring of the Ford-Fulkerson chronicle, though it wouldn't harm to check whether standardized really means standardized. I've also added a (very simple) method to permutations.py to compute the permutation poset of a permutation, and while being there fixed a couple typos in the RSK docs (the changeset isn't very informative, but what I've done is replacing some "right" by "left" in the doc).

I'm not sure what "fuzz" exactly means; is it something like "the line numbers have shifted, but it's kinda clear where the changes belong"?

I don't know how to add a commit message...

to add a commit message, you can use 

```
hg qrefresh - m "trac #14131 patch for doing really serious things"
```
or just

```
hg qrefresh -e
```
which will open a text editor

There is one thing I don't understand: [Travis] "Note that the export does not have to override the patch file, but you only would have to do it once if changes are subsequently made to the patch." Do what once?

I deliberately used 1 backtick for the variables since their font should match the font in which they appear in later LaTeX formulae. Is this against some convention?
