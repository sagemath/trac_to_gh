Funny that. We did face the upgrade in sage-on-gentoo in sage 5.8 and we had the same issue. Christopher was supposed to open a ticket with his solution but he never did.

I have no idea, but I assume that SQLite is sufficiently fast. There are other place too where `ORDER BY` is used. In any case, your patch is not good because it assumes that there is no curve of conductor 10001 for example. This assumption is false if the large Cremona database has been installed.
