I have some comments regarding the set of patches in #12339. I myself can not give much technical input, but I have a colleague here who has been trying to use this and has come across some inconsistencies.

1. Is there a reason why a `FreeGroupElement` does not have the `__call__` method? A `FreeMonoidElement` does have the `__call__` method. This is needed to make the following work

```python
sage: G.<a,b> = FreeGroup()
sage: a.subs(a=1,b=2) # We would expect the answer to be 1
a
```
2. Related to the implementation of the `__call__` method is the following problem. Suppose in order to make `subs()` work, we implement the `__call__` method. The current code has to call `a.Tietze()` to get the index of the free generator `a` and its exponent. For a more complicated expression the output is as follows, and we would have to go along and parse the output tuple to find out the exponent by counting. Is there any method (maybe in GAP) which outputs just a list of tuples `[(generator1, exponent1), (generator2, exponent2),...]`. This is again how `FreeMonoid` is implemented.

```
sage: (a^2 * b^-3).Tietze()
(1, 1, -2, -2, -2)
sage: (a^2 * b^-3).some_function() # some function which gives (generator, exponent) tuples
[(a, 2), (b, -3)]
```

Fantastic! It looks like a final patch to me! Do you plan to add anything else? It works nicely here (substituting matrices also works).
