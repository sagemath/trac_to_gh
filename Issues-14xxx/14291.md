<a id='comment:4'></a>There are more useful permutation group actions, see http://www.gap-system.org/Manuals/doc/ref/chap41.html

Namely, `OnPairs, OnSetsSets, OnSetsDisjointSets, OnSetsTuples, OnTuplesSets, OnTuplesTuples` all should work just fine.

One has to canonize the representative to start with, for some of them, [see here](http://www.gap-system.org/Manuals/doc/ref/chap41.html#X82181CA07A5B2056). E.g.

```
Orbit(SymmetricGroup(5),Set([[2,4],[1,3]]),OnSetsSets);
```
is OK, but

```
Orbit(SymmetricGroup(5),[[2,4],[1,3]],OnSetsSets);
```
gives an error.

Less sure about `OnIndeterminates`.

There is also a support for user-defined actions, but this would mean either specifying a piece of GAP code, or providing a callback, which seems to be too crazy to implement.

Cool `:-P`

Well, for a start `sage -coverage` will not like the documentation of `supported_actions` at all. Why do you want to create a function just to list them ? Why don't you just include in the methods, or make it a variable in the module ? (anyway you still have to split cases in `orbits` in order to know what to return).

Would it be possible to add a link toward GAP's documentation where all those actions are defined ?

The current setup allows it to be extended by the user. One can install via `gap.eval()` a GAP function, say, `"OnBlah"`, and then  use it. You can't do this with a module variable.

sure this can be done as you prefer. However, there is a more serious issue with `self.action`:

```
sage: G = PermutationGroup([ [('c','d')], [('a','c')] ])
sage: xx=G.orbit(('a','c'),"OnPairs")
sage: G.action(xx,"OnPairs")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
RuntimeError                              Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-4-540be1338037> in <module>()
----> 1 G.action(xx,"OnPairs")
...
```
Indeed, `_domain_to_gap[x] ` needs to be applied onto such orbits. I am thinking that one should have recursive function version of
`_domain_to_gap[x] `  and of `_domain_from_gap[x] ` to deal with things like sets, sets of sets, etc in one go rather
than  call them explicitly. 

One can also (or instead) attach such a pair of functions to each action in `supported_actions` to do this rewriting.

Well, if a action is being used that is not already in the source code, then there is no way for Sage to guess how to translate the result before returning it, is there ?

Otherwise we could just get rid of this list, cross our fingers when GAP is fed with something we ha not thought of, as it would raise an Exception in the worst case ?..

Hmmmm... I don't like it very much to be honest... In these situations I think that a bit of code duplication is better than a weird generic way to handle it.

This does not seem to present a problem, as the action of the group is the same (trivial).

But the real problem is with tuples vs sets. E.g. if your domain has tuples, it will not be possible to compute the action on subsets.

Hmmmmmmmmm.... I have no idea how, an I would hate to have to use the Parent/Element stuff to do that `:-P`

Well, I guess the best is to do as you first did and to split according to the value of `action`.

By the way, I noticed in the code source of `Graph.is_edge_transitive` a trick we could use there :

```
"OrbitLength("+str(A._gap_())+",Set(" + str(e) + "),OnSets);"
```

If we wrap the lists with a Set, then GAP itself reorders them and there is nothing to fear when giving sets at Sage level `:-)`

this is too ugly, uglier than using a class, or whatever. Actually, I think it is simply wrong to let groups act on some totally unstructured arbitrary sh*t, and this is exactly what happens right now with allowing arbitrary domain elements, for which any relation to the original domain is lost.

Say, if the domain of a group is {1,2,3,4,{1,2},{2,3}}, the very notion of the orbit of {1,2}  is becoming ambiguous, as in a sane world {1,2} is a subset of {1,2,3,4}, and not a random label.

I don't think this is relevant. Here we have an example of a group acting on triples, and this is a kind of "primitive" action, all the other actions originate from it.

Anyhow, there is a hack which might fix all our sorrows: namely, add an extra level of () to the "most primitive" elements of the
domain. I.e. if instead of {1,2,3,4,{1,2},{2,3}} there was a domain `{{1},{2},{3},{4},{1,2},{2,3}}` then the ambiguity does not arise, for {1,2} and `{{1},{2}}` are different things now.

Come on Dima. Let's just rewrite the method as it was previously... If the action is on points we know what to do, if it is on something else we also know what to do, case by case.

It's not worth adding another layer just for that ...

it's for the general sanity of the setup. Let me post on sage-devel asking opinions, as I do think that this is a fundamental semantic problem of the design.

Needless to say, if I am declared insane there, then I would happily review whatever patch you would be willing to put here :)

The curiosity of the reviewer is sacred, don't you think so? :-)

Besides, it's easy to backport the patch here directly into the smallgraphs patch it came from, and put this ticket on hold.

On wrong instances, yes. On instances like (1,2,{1,2},...), which make no sense, because they lead to horrible bugs. Here is how.

Take, say, directed 3-cycle, and label its vertices, in the cyclic order, 1, 2, (1,2). So you get G=Z_3, the automorphism group of this digraph, acting on the domain V=(1,2,(1,2)).  Next, ask for the orbit of the **arc** (1,2) of the digraph under G. OK, fine, it is A=((1,2),(2,(1,2)),((1,2),1). Now, note that the intersection of V and A equals {(1,2)}. The intersection of two distinct orbits of a group is not empty...

Would Évariste Galois raise from his grave and chase the designer of this? :–)

**Edit.** Or implement the action on tuples of tuples, and ask for the orbit of ((1,2),(1,2)).

That's true. But the two problems are totally unrelated, though !

There is a "permutatino" somewhere. Could you also replace `x = sorted(x)` with ``x.sort()` ?

This being said, your patch does not apply on my version of Sage... But I still use beta1, perhaps that's the reason why.
