To reproduce: in a notebook, type

```

```
bla? <tab>
```

I cannot reproduce it on the command line.

I can confirm that the problem is gone in 5.11.beta1. The problem occurred with the "matroids" keyword from #7477, and that gives a normal documentation now.

Can I mark it as "duplicate/invalid/wontfix" or is that up to the release manager?
