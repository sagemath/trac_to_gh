By the way, nobody would expect this {{{
sage: graphs.CompleteBipartiteGraph(3,2).is_circular_planar()
True
}}}

The same way that nobody would expect Sage to return "True" when `is_planar` is called on `K_5`. And this was one of the doctests `-_-`

Aaargh, I had expected `./sage -docbuild reference html` to summarise any errors encountered at the end. But I guess this is not the case. Luckily, I meanwhile discovered `./sage -docbuild reference/graphs html`. The rest is still the same, so OK for me.
