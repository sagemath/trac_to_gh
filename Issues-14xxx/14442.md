As reported there https://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-edu/ivWea0Gk3_Q/discussion

By the way, nobody would expect this {{{
sage: graphs.CompleteBipartiteGraph(3,2).is_circular_planar()
True
}}}

The same way that nobody would expect Sage to return "True" when `is_planar` is called on `K_5`. And this was one of the doctests `-_-`
