Hi Karl-Dieter,

You need to edit spkg-install and remove the line that says "print .....". There are a couple more things we have done in sage-on-gentoo that could be interesting. Currently this spkg depends on sage-runtime and I think the change we made could enable us to drop that in favor of just sage.

Long story short I had problems with gap and that prevented this to be installed. sage-runtime implies that gap for example can be loaded and it is in the current incarnation of the spkg. With what we did it is not necessary anymore.

spkg-install in sage-on-gentoo look like this:

```
#!/usr/bin/env python

import os
from sage.structure.sage_object import save

install_root = os.path.join('/scratch/portage/sci-mathematics/sage-data-conway_polynomials-0.4-r1/image/usr/share/sage', 'conway_polynomials')

def create_db():
    db = {}
    from src import conway_polynomials
    for p,n,v in conway_polynomials:
        if not db.has_key(p):
            db[p] = {}
        db[p][n] = v
    if not os.path.exists(install_root):
        os.makedirs(install_root)
    save(db, os.path.join(install_root, 'conway_polynomials.sobj'))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    create_db()
```
the definition of install_root is gentoo specific, so you shouldn't use that bit. The rest is ok for consumption in "vanilla" sage.
