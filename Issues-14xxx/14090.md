This ticket adds three tutorials that have been developped and extensively used during Sage(-Combinat) events:

- Tutorial: Using the Sage notebook, navigating the help system, first exercises
- Tutorial: Programming in Python and Sage
- Tutorial: Comprehensions, Iterators, and Iterables

There is some redundancy with the PREP's tutorial, but that's fine:
the point of views are complementary.

At this occasion, this ticket also refactors the main Thematic
Tutorials page, grouping them by theme, and cross-linking to thematic
tutorials that are already in the Sage sources (combinatorics, padics)
or other documents (PREP).

A preview of the result is available here:

http://combinat.sagemath.org/doc/thematic_tutorials/

It might be slightly outdated w.r.t. the latest version of the
patch. Also one should ignore the SEEALSO section which is added by a
later patch in the Sage-Combinat queue.

Yes, I remember vaguely but I can't remember exactly... Maybe, it was a bigger patch no? with more sections? Anyway, I looked at it and I think the sections and their order are fine.

1. However, some links do not appear as links (see attached png).

2. Also, links to PREP tutorials do not work.

Yes. That's what #14091 is about (links to the reference manual). My
opinion is that we should ignore them, especially since this should be
fixed shortly by #6495.

Yes, I am not sure how to handle this. The toctree approach is not
well suited here since we want the index to include a mix of
references to local files and external files. I lamely silenced those
warnings by adding a separate "toctree.rst" document which is just
referenced from index.rst.

What do you think?

Yup. That's #14091

They work in the live documentation ... The right thing to do would be
to put :ref`...`'s. John: do you know whether #6495 also enables links

At the time the thematic tutorials were pretty clearly *thematic* tutorials.  Not really a lot of overlap between abelian sandpiles and an intro to doing calculus in Sage.  In any case, one should keep existing links working.\n\nMaybe that would be a next step - re-organizing *all* information in the Sage references.  Currently there is also\n* Three Lectures about Explicit Methods in Number Theory Using Sage \n* Numerical Sage \n* A Tour of Sage \n* Constructions \n\nSome of these things have been translated, which gives additional annoyance...\n\n```\nThis is an index, grouped by theme, of Sage demonstrations, quick reference cards, primers, and thematic tutorials:\n```\nI only see primers and thematic tutorials.  Is this old language?\n\nAlso, what is the reason for the different formatting - there is italic, regular, bold, and even tt - on the front page?\n\n---\n\nWith respect to the iteration tutorial, on request of nthiery h\u00f6chstpers\u00f6nlich!  Mostly very minor English stuff.\n* What is the plural of \"syntax\"?

Here come some comments.  First, generalities about the front page.

> Or should the PREP tutorial be simply merged in the thematic tutorials (is there a compelling reason to have separate documents?)

Maybe not any more.  At the time the thematic tutorials were pretty clearly *thematic* tutorials.  Not really a lot of overlap between abelian sandpiles and an intro to doing calculus in Sage.  In any case, one should keep existing links working.

Maybe that would be a next step - re-organizing *all* information in the Sage references.  Currently there is also
* Three Lectures about Explicit Methods in Number Theory Using Sage 
* Numerical Sage 
* A Tour of Sage 
* Constructions 

Some of these things have been translated, which gives additional annoyance...

```
This is an index, grouped by theme, of Sage demonstrations, quick reference cards, primers, and thematic tutorials:
```
I only see primers and thematic tutorials.  Is this old language?

Also, what is the reason for the different formatting - there is italic, regular, bold, and even tt - on the front page?

---

With respect to the iteration tutorial, on request of nthiery höchstpersönlich!  Mostly very minor English stuff.
* What is the plural of "syntax"?  I would use "syntaxes" as a common variant. 

```
 You can use either of the following syntax:
```
* Needs comma, probably.

```
For example here 
```
* An *extremely* useful addition is

```
sage: [i^2 if i%2 == 1 else 2 for i in range(10)]
[2, 1, 2, 9, 2, 25, 2, 49, 2, 81]
```
   The syntax has to be perfect.  Does this work for ones with also `for j in range(10)` and so forth?
* This phrase has no end-parenthesis.

```
(hint:use srange() ...
```
* "built"

```
Iterators are build using parentheses:
```
* "Iterators can be used as arguments" or "An iterator can be used ..." - I think you mean the latter, though.

```
An iterators can
```
* With respect to this:

```
You can get the list of the results that are not yet consumed:
```
   What happens if you try to continue the iterator now?  I think that would be useful to warn folks.

```
sage: it.next()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
StopIteration                             Traceback (most recent call last)

StopIteration: 
```
* "give the same result; however, the second"

```
give the same results; however the second 
```
* Show this with an example and `timeit` or something.  Maybe untested.

```
Using a list would be much slower here:
```
* "counter example" should be one word in English.
* "and a function with tests" should be "and a function which tests
* "interesting but demonstrating" *could* be "interesting beyond demonstrating", though that is more of a style choice
* "Finally many" should be "Finally, many"
* Make sure these are marked ` # not tested`!

```
sage: for p in Partitions(): print p
sage: for p in Primes(): print p
```
* Finally, I think that something about iterables should mention `zip` and friends.  Or is that in a previous tutorial?

Overall I like it, though!

Hi Karl!

Thanks for the proofreading and suggestions!

Replying to [@kcrisman](#comment:18):

Link fixed. It remains good stuff!

I added a TODO at the end about those.

This is just using the standard Sphinx markup `.. TODO::`

> * With `range`, probably you should at least make some mention of `xrange`, `srange`, `sxrange`, and friends and what they do.  Edit: point to further down where you do.

Done.

Yeah, indeed. This stems from the fact that we usually run this tutorial by having someone gloss over the first part and then have the student work on their own on the rest.

+1. It's mentionned later on.

Done.


Altogether, it could use some reorganisation and complements not perfect. However I would go for getting this in and improving it further in a later ticket! Ok with that?

Agreed, this is ugly. But it's about style and not content. So yes,
that should be for another ticket.

I just added a link from the intro to the programming tutorials.

I see the potential confusion. Yet I am strongly attached to the word
Modeling, because that's really what we are doing (in the sense of
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_modeling, though we don't
necessarily have to use only object-oriented techniques). I changed
the title to "Modeling Mathematics on a computer". Is this better?

:-)

This sounds nice! I'll try to have a more detailed look! For now I'll
focus on getting those in before they rot away.

The \ is there in the .rst file.

I think it is.

I changed this to "idioms" :-)

Added.

I am not sure what you mean here.

Better be indeed :-)  Done!

It is!

Status: ready to go, assuming the patchbot goes green.

- The two first tutorials have been reviewed in depth by Samuel Lelièvre
  during the Sage days in Bobo Dioulasso.

- Sébastien, John, Karl checked the index page

- I proofread the last tutorial

- Karl and Darij reproofread all documents. I implemented all changes by Darij.

- The link to the PREP document seem to work. Intersphinx linking
  would be nicer. But that is for later!

Thanks everybody!

I have a couple minor quibbles yet but not worth mentioning as they are to some extent stylistic.

HOWEVER I think you should ask Harald to reorganize [the standard doc page](http://www.sagemath.org/help.html#SageStandardDoc) in light of this, AND I think that somewhere in there is also the source for [the Sage doc](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/index.html) which should be reorganized in light of this.
