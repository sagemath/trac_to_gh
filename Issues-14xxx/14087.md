From [this ask.sagemath question](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/2231/backslash-operator-on-rdf-matrices):

```
sage: A = matrix(QQ, 3, [1,2,4,2,3,1,0,1,2])
sage: B = matrix(QQ, 3, 2, [1,7,5,2,1,3])
sage: A\B
[  -1    1]
[13/5 -3/5]
[-4/5  9/5]
sage: A = matrix(RDF, 3, [1,2,4,2,3,1,0,1,2])
sage: B = matrix(RDF, 3, 2, [1,7,5,2,1,3])
sage: A\B
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
...
TypeError: vector of constants over Real Double Field incompatible with matrix over Real Double Field
```
Paraphrasing from my reply there:

The problem arises because when A is a matrix over QQ and when A is a matrix over RDF, you will find that the former allows B to be a matrix, but the latter does not. Only vectors are supported/implemented for RDF fields. As such it is not a bug, but I think this should raise a `NotImplementedError` when a matrix B is used over RDF A.

The problem is that there is too much and too restrictive "error" handling, when really no error is necessary.  I've attached a preliminary patch, but lots of the doctests will fail that check the error messages.  Also, 0-column/row matrices probably aren't handled nicely.

Out of all the doctests in the sage/matrix directory only 6 of them failed, all in `matrix_double_dense.pyx`. Let's allow the patchbot to run the doctests, and then we can fix any other failing doctests. The current patch seems good enough since there is apparently no need to solve selectively for vectors or matrices - scipy seems to handle both just fine.

I think the `try: except:` statement should remain. It seems to give a decent error message when we try to solve linear equations over a matrix which is over RDF, but a vector which is over some incompatible field like a finite field. In its absence an absurd implementation-specific error message is returned:

```
   AttributeError: 'sage.modules.free_module_element.FreeModuleElement_generic_dense' object has no attribute 'numpy'
```

I am curious though - how does `vector(scipy_output)` or `matrix(scipy_output)` work? How does it know which field or ring to convert to, since we are not specifying the ring explicitly?
