Cython's `Nodes.relative_position` makes file names relative by stripping off the first `len(os.path.abspath(os.getcwd()))` characters. This is totally wrong if the file is from the include search path and not relative to `cwd`

Upstream bug report: http://trac.cython.org/cython_trac/ticket/817

The first patch makes the last two includes in Sage absolute, which triggers the bug.
