What do you think that extra

```
if axes is None
```
was there for?  It seems okay to remove it.

What do you think would happen with

```
yaxis='right'
```
instead of `'left'` at the end?  I'm just curious if it would make a difference.  I suppose I could try it out... it doesn't *seem* to make a difference.  Does it need to be set at all?  Answering my own question... hmm, I think we need to decide what to do here.

```
sage: plot(x,(x,-10,-8),axes=[False,True],axes_labels=['x','y'])
sage: plot(x,(x,8,10),axes=[False,True],axes_labels=['x','y'])
```
Should this be valid?  And currently the `x`-axis in the first one shows up at the bottom, which is wrong (in some sense).  Probably it should just be turned off.  Putting needs work, but maybe it's closer to needs info.  Otherwise I like this.

The `axes is none` was just setting the default if the user did not specify axes.

I don't understand why this is working when the `if` statement is removed; in fact I don't remember much about this patch. Will need some time to revisit this.

I get the x-axis turned off in both the plots. Is that not what you are getting? The x label is still there and the labels don't seem centered any more.

Yeah, but it was there *twice*.

Sorry, that's what I meant - the `x` label for the axis.

Sorry, why should the label be removed? Maybe the user actually wants the label. There is always the option of passing `axes_labels=['', 'y']` if the user does not want the axis to be labeled either.
