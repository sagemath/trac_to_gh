Yes, this is why well-designed languages feature strong typing. ;-)

Speaking seriously, it looks to me as if the most successful approach would be to patch `matplotlib()`, beginning in line 2079 of `sage/plot/graphics.py`, to make sure the arguments we sent it are `float`s rather than `MPFR` data types.

Or is this the wrong idea?

Incidentally, I'm rather surprised that such a method doesn't already exist. It would seem useful to a user who knew what s/he was doing.

```
try:

since I'm pretty sure that floating-point numbers are the only Sage field that can be used as matplotlib parameters.

Also, it would be nice to save a copy of options and restore them after the call to matplotlib.
