Incidentally, I'm rather surprised that such a method doesn't already exist. It would seem useful to a user who knew what s/he was doing.

Its not just RealLiteral that we have to worry about, somebody might compute linewidth from some numerical formula and hand down elements of other "real fields", like RealField, RealDoubleField, or RealIntervalField. I would suggest a more relaxed check, something like

```
try: 
    if v.parent() in Fields():
        v = float(v)
except (AttributeError, TypeError):
    pass
```
since I'm pretty sure that floating-point numbers are the only Sage field that can be used as matplotlib parameters.

Also, it would be nice to save a copy of options and restore them after the call to matplotlib.
