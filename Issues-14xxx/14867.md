Also the indentation looks wrong in the changed line of code.

I'll come back and review this again when these are fixed!

I'm looking at it.  The chenges look good but I cannot checkout the branch for some reason:

```
$ ./sage -dev checkout --ticket=u/jdemeyer/ticket/14867
Ticket name "u/jdemeyer/ticket/14867" is not valid or ticket does not exist on trac.
```
This is the usual way I check out tickets to reivew and worked before.  I have not yet tried a manual git checkout.

For the record: that should have been 

```
 ./sage -dev checkout --ticket=14867
```
