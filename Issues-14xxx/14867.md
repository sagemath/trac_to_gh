<a id='comment:2'></a>Can you edit the docstring's INPUT section so that all the input parameters are listed (together with what they mean), and have an OUTPUT section after that?  Currently they are a bit mixed up.  (Surely the meaning of input param. B is that all vectors of norm <= B are returned, not =B?)

Also the indentation looks wrong in the changed line of code.

I'll come back and review this again when these are fixed!
