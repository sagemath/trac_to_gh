I'm looking at it.  The chenges look good but I cannot checkout the branch for some reason:

```
$ ./sage -dev checkout --ticket=u/jdemeyer/ticket/14867
Ticket name "u/jdemeyer/ticket/14867" is not valid or ticket does not exist on trac.
```
This is the usual way I check out tickets to reivew and worked before.  I have not yet tried a manual git checkout.

 ./sage -dev checkout --ticket=14867
```
