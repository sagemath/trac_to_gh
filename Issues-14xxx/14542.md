In a 2008 paper (see below), Maia and Méndez define an operation on combinatorial species which they dub the "arithmetic product". This operation corresponds to a nice combinatorial operation: the arithmetic product F⊡G corresponds to the species of "F-assemblies of cloned G-structures", which are structures of the partitional composite species F∘G with the additional requirement that all the G-structures be isomorphic.

As shown in the paper, the cycle index of the arithmetic product F⊡G can be computed in terms of the cycle indices of the species F and G. The attached patch adds code to calculate the result of this operation. It includes a doctest which verifies a nontrivial computation related to the species of "regular octopuses".

Since the numbers involved here are small, just using range instead won't hurt anything, so I've switched it over.

It computes each lcm and each gcd very often (maxval times), whereas the definition I gave would only have to compute it once. On the other hand, the definition I gave requires sorting (or, better, insort) and probably handles repeated entries suboptimally.

On review, I think your way is much better; if nothing else, it results in much cleaner and (to my eye) more mathematical code. I've added comments explaining what happens in each method and how they connect to the paper.

Also fixed.

The sum_generator method takes finite lists, but they need to represent infinite objects, so it assumes that the last element of the list is meant to repeat. Thus, the zero.

It looks like a nice application of species to proving a nontrivial algebraic result. Is there a species-theoretical proof of the integrality of \Delta_3 in http://mathoverflow.net/questions/120924/is-the-renormalized-third-comultiplication-on-mathbfsymm-integral as well?

I'll need to give this some more thought, but I wanted to go ahead and get the revised code up. I'm much more a combinatorialist than an algebraist, so I may not be the best person for the job, but I will definitely give it a thinking-over.

> **EDIT:** This patch made me aware that I have no idea what the `sum_generator` method in `sage/combinat/species/series.py` does. Is it possible to have a docstring for it that actually explains its behavior? The examples given only confuse me.

This would definitely be helpful. My understanding of it is very limited; I seem to have managed to bend it to my will, but I'm quite far from mastery. The basic idea seems to be that it formally constructs a LazyPowerSeries by adding over an infinite iterable of "generators", but the details are buried deep in Stream and LazyPowerSeries.

Thanks for the update! I'll have to take a closer look at it.

Meanwhile, are you sure you want those `assert`s in lines 606-607? I don't know what a typical use case of this method should be, but I can imagine applying it in a case where the **base ring** is not discrete (i. e., you cannot check for equality) and these `assert`s will throw a NotImplemented. Think of a lazy power series ring in 2 variables implemented as a lazy power series ring over a lazy power series ring; then the base ring itself is lazy and this stuff breaks. I have a similar issue with your #14543 patch. Maybe add a `check_input=True` keyword which can optionally be set to `False` to avoid these `assert`s?

In other news:

```
sage: L = LazyPowerSeriesRing(QQ)                             
sage: L.sum_generator([L([0]),L([1])]).coefficients(10)       
[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
sage: L.sum_generator([L([0]),L([1]),L([0])]).coefficients(10)
[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
```

I don't think the 1 repeats because it's the last element -- it is not, in the second case. I think it repeats because of the "sum" in "sum_generator". But like you, I don't have a clue what's going on with `sum_generator` really (I actually think I have less of a clue than you do). I'll try to ask around in Orsay...
