In a 2008 paper (see below), Maia and Méndez define an operation on combinatorial species which they dub the "arithmetic product". This operation corresponds to a nice combinatorial operation: the arithmetic product F⊡G corresponds to the species of "F-assemblies of cloned G-structures", which are structures of the partitional composite species F∘G with the additional requirement that all the G-structures be isomorphic.

As shown in the paper, the cycle index of the arithmetic product F⊡G can be computed in terms of the cycle indices of the species F and G. The attached patch adds code to calculate the result of this operation. It includes a doctest which verifies a nontrivial computation related to the species of "regular octopuses".

line 602: "g" should be inside double backticks.

line 620: Where does the "1 +" come from? Is there a regular octopus on 0 vertices? (I don't think so.)

line 623: xrange will be deprecated in Python 3.0; just saying.

line 643: Please explain what the arithmetic product of partition is supposed to mean. The Maia-Mendez paper defines the arithmetic product of polynomials; as far as I understand, by the arithmetic product of two partitions \lambda and \mu you mean the partition obtained by writing down gcd(\lambda_i, \mu_j) times the integer lcm(\lambda_i, \mu_j) for every i and every j, and then sorting the resulting sequence in nonincreasing order. That's fine, but you should clarify the relation between
- this operation on partitions,
- the Maia-Mendez operation on polynomials, and
- the operation on symmetric functions that you have actually implemented.
(You are interpreting the x_i of Maia-Mendez as the i-th power sum, as far as I understand, and the partition \lambda corresponds to the product p_\lambda = p_{\lambda_1} p_{\lambda_2} ....)

About your implementation of `arith_prod_of_partitions`: I'm not sure how fast it is.

On another note rather unrelated to Sage: The species viewpoint on the arithmetic product shows that the arithmetic product on the ring of symmetric functions (the one given by

p_\lambda \boxdot p_\mu = \prod_{i,j} p_{\lcm(\lambda_i, \mu_j)}^{\gcd(\lambda_i, \mu_j)}

for all partitions \lambda and \mu) is defined over the integers, not just over the rationals (despite the p_\lambda not forming a Z-basis of Symm). Is there an algebraic proof of this? It looks like a nice application of species to proving a nontrivial algebraic result. Is there a species-theoretical proof of the integrality of \Delta_3 in http://mathoverflow.net/questions/120924/is-the-renormalized-third-comultiplication-on-mathbfsymm-integral as well?

**EDIT:** This patch made me aware that I have no idea what the `sum_generator` method in `sage/combinat/species/series.py` does. Is it possible to have a docstring for it that actually explains its behavior? The examples given only confuse me.

The sum_generator method takes finite lists, but they need to represent infinite objects, so it assumes that the last element of the list is meant to repeat. Thus, the zero.

This would definitely be helpful. My understanding of it is very limited; I seem to have managed to bend it to my will, but I'm quite far from mastery. The basic idea seems to be that it formally constructs a LazyPowerSeries by adding over an infinite iterable of "generators", but the details are buried deep in Stream and LazyPowerSeries.

Thanks for the update! I'll have to take a closer look at it.

Meanwhile, are you sure you want those `assert`s in lines 606-607? I don't know what a typical use case of this method should be, but I can imagine applying it in a case where the **base ring** is not discrete (i. e., you cannot check for equality) and these `assert`s will throw a NotImplemented. Think of a lazy power series ring in 2 variables implemented as a lazy power series ring over a lazy power series ring; then the base ring itself is lazy and this stuff breaks. I have a similar issue with your #14543 patch. Maybe add a `check_input=True` keyword which can optionally be set to `False` to avoid these `assert`s?

In other news:

```
sage: L = LazyPowerSeriesRing(QQ)                             
sage: L.sum_generator([L([0]),L([1])]).coefficients(10)       
[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
sage: L.sum_generator([L([0]),L([1]),L([0])]).coefficients(10)
[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
```

I don't think the 1 repeats because it's the last element -- it is not, in the second case. I think it repeats because of the "sum" in "sum_generator". But like you, I don't have a clue what's going on with `sum_generator` really (I actually think I have less of a clue than you do). I'll try to ask around in Orsay...

Yes, the semantics of `sum_generator` and `LazyPowerSeriesRing` are quite mysterious. I did some investigating while working on #14906 and learned a bit about working with them. I now think the correct way to handle this kind of construction is with `LazyPowerSeriesRing.term`, but unfortunately I am away from my build machine for the rest of the week (I'm at MathFest), so I won't be able to update this until I get back.

Alternately, if you'd be willing to put together a new patch, the correction is simple. The lines

```
    # Build a list which has res in the nth slot and 0's before and after
    # to feed to sum_generator
    res_in_seq = [p.zero()]*n + [res, p.zero()]
            
    return self.parent(res_in_seq)
```

should be replaced by the single line

```
    return self.parent.term(res, n)    
```

You want `self.parent().term`, not `self.parent.term`. The fact that `self.parent(res_in_seq)` works (and is equivalent to `self.parent()(res_in_seq)`) is due to syntactic sugar.

You are correct that `self.parent.term(res, n)` works and makes more sense, but it's also 3 times slower than `self.parent(res_in_seq)` (not sure why), so I'd keep what I've written.

Whoops! This is what I get from trying to write code from a browser after a day of workshops.

How strange! I'll add this to my pile of things to investigate once I get back on my feet. Using `res_in_seq` for this is fine for now, though.
