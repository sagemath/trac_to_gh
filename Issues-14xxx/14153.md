This seems to be broken on lines having unicode characters in comments such as:

Some doctests come from the notebook, I made a pull request.

Regarding this commit, and others like it--is this not going to be a problem on Python 3, where the strings won't be repr'd as `u'...'`?

In other projects I've modified the doctest checker to ignore the `u` marker in strings by default.  If a test needs to explicitly check whether or not a string is unicode there are other ways.  But most of the time that isn't relevant.
