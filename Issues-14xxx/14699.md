You'd still need a line

```
    cmd += ' --incdir=' + os.path.join(conf['SAGE_LOCAL'],'include') 
```
in `configure_atlas_library()` for the header files to go the correct place?

And currently numpy is built without Atlas (it uses another blas): local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/numpy/core/_dotblas.so normally contains ATL_* symbols (for an old Atlas 3.8.3 version, at least).

I don't think so.
We use prefix and that should be enough from what I've seen in ATLAS configure script.

On my gcc110 install (where IML testsuite fails), numpy uses ATLAS correctly.
There is no ATLAS symbols in the file you pointed because we now use a shared version of ATLAS.
But if I run ldd on the file it points to the ATLAS libs.

And I seem to remember we had lots of troubles correctly biulding numpy and scipy with the new ATLAS so hopefully it was actually used.

Having static libraries rather than nothing on systems where building shared ones is problematic might be nice...
Also note it's the only option upstream really supports.

Well, if we used ATLAS' install rather than further hacking, we'd get both the headers and the static libraries.

I don't see any reason why **discarding** static libraries should be done by default; if someone feels they're dangerous to him/her, we could add some option to *automatically* remove them, although that's IMHO a pretty unimportant feature.

This doesn't at all work with `SAGE_ATLAS_LIB` [unless the headers happen to be installed system-wide, which is the same situation as before], since headers don't get copied / symlinked.




What happens on MacOS X (where Sage's ATLAS by default doesn't get built)?

(Similar for Cygwin perhaps.)

Not really wonderful as the src directory still includes a modified upstream source, but maybe a little bit better looking.

IML spkg needs review, I restored upstream sources and added patches in the `patches/` directory. I know the patches can be catalogued and documented better, but let's leave that for next time...

Tested on Linux and OS X x86_64, IML (with testsuite) works.

What does that achieve exactly?
Just looking at the patch, I cannot really guess.
Does it force upgrading the sage-env script?

A question for Volker: How does the SO_VERSION variable in the ATLAS autotools project be updated?

In the IMl spkg, you don't reexport CFLAGS after checking for SAGE64 (both in spkg-check and spkg-install).

And when looking through trac there is a strange .patch part about renaming sage3_memleak, but that may just be a trac issue.
