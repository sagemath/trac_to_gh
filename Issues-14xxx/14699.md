On my gcc110 install (where IML testsuite fails), numpy uses ATLAS correctly.
There is no ATLAS symbols in the file you pointed because we now use a shared version of ATLAS.
But if I run ldd on the file it points to the ATLAS libs.

And I seem to remember we had lots of troubles correctly biulding numpy and scipy with the new ATLAS so hopefully it was actually used.

Well, if we used ATLAS' install rather than further hacking, we'd get both the headers and the static libraries.

I don't see any reason why **discarding** static libraries should be done by default; if someone feels they're dangerous to him/her, we could add some option to *automatically* remove them, although that's IMHO a pretty unimportant feature.

What happens on MacOS X (where Sage's ATLAS by default doesn't get built)?

(Similar for Cygwin perhaps.)
