Surely an ATLAS problem, see http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/10508#comment:526 for a solution.

I suggest we call at least install_inc and potentially install_lib from ATLAS build system to install headers and static libs.

I don't think so.
We use prefix and that should be enough from what I've seen in ATLAS configure script.

On my gcc110 install (where IML testsuite fails), numpy uses ATLAS correctly.
There is no ATLAS symbols in the file you pointed because we now use a shared version of ATLAS.
But if I run ldd on the file it points to the ATLAS libs.

And I seem to remember we had lots of troubles correctly biulding numpy and scipy with the new ATLAS so hopefully it was actually used.

I don't see any reason why **discarding** static libraries should be done by default; if someone feels they're dangerous to him/her, we could add some option to *automatically* remove them, although that's IMHO a pretty unimportant feature.

This doesn't at all work with `SAGE_ATLAS_LIB` [unless the headers happen to be installed system-wide, which is the same situation as before], since headers don't get copied / symlinked.




What happens on MacOS X (where Sage's ATLAS by default doesn't get built)?

(Similar for Cygwin perhaps.)

Replying to [jpflori](#comment%3A49):
> Indeed, the ticket original title was about IML testsuite, so we should also provide an IML spkg (quite trivial just remove the horrible patch disabling test for cblas.h).


So I'm not sure if it's really that easy.

Not really anything useful to do when a system-wide ATLAS is used.

Does really no software linking to ATLAS expect to find headers in some standard or provided place?
Do they all provide their own BLAS headers and expect everything to be fine?

A test spkg is at:

Not really wonderful as the src directory still includes a modified upstream source, but maybe a little bit better looking.

What does that achieve exactly?
Just looking at the patch, I cannot really guess.
Does it force upgrading the sage-env script?

A question for Volker: How does the SO_VERSION variable in the ATLAS autotools project be updated?

In the IMl spkg, you don't reexport CFLAGS after checking for SAGE64 (both in spkg-check and spkg-install).

And when looking through trac there is a strange .patch part about renaming sage3_memleak, but that may just be a trac issue.
