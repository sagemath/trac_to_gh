Continued fractions (in sage.rings.contfrac) do not do what we expect:

1. categories are not properly initialized nor used.
2. all arithmetic operations go back and forth with the underlying rational (there are much more direct solutions for taking the negative, inverse and to compare two continued fractions)
3. it only deals with rational numbers
4. there is no dedicated method for numerical approximations (which is one of the first aim of continued fractions)
5. there is no bridge with quadratic numbers (see also #11345)
6. there is no bridge with words (sage.combinat.words)
7. continued fractions are not included in the documentation

The patch proposed here develop some general design for dealing with continued fractions and solve all issues above.

With the patch applied we can do

```
sage: (117/253).continued_fraction()
[0; 2, 6, 6, 3]

sage: K.<sqrt2> = QuadraticField(2)
sage: cff = (sqrt2/3 + 1/4).continued_fraction(); cff
[0; 1, (2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 5, 1, 1, 14, 1, 1, 5)*]
sage: cff.period()
(2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 5, 1, 1, 14, 1, 1, 5)
sage: cff.preperiod()
(0, 1)
sage: cff.value()
1/3*sqrt2 + 1/4
sage: cff.n(digits=50)
0.72140452079103168293389624140323269285655729179232

sage: cf_pi = continued_fraction(pi)
[3; 7, 15, 1, 292, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 14, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, ...]
sage: cf_pi.quotient(1500)
1

sage: cf_fib = continued_fraction(words.FibonacciWord([1,2]))
sage: cf_fib
[1; 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2...]
sage: cf_fib.n(digits=42)
1.38795458796714233691931385987318547787815
```
In particular we solve the question in #11345.

The ticket is not yet finished but the review may start (all test pass on my computer... waiting for patchbot). Here are some questions I am not sure how to deal about.
* How to cleanly implement numerical approximations of continued fractions (see the current (stupid) implementation of `_mpfr_` in sage.rings.continued_fraction_element`) ?

* The link with words is not yet done and perhaps should be delayed to another ticket as the patch is yet 2500 lines long.
* some of the stuff about continued fractions in `sage.rings.arith` should move to `sage.rings.continued_fraction_field` (I think I do prefer `sage.rings.continued_fractions` to `sage.rings.continued_fraction_field`...).

Ralf, commit 7e0af96 is the wrong way to do fix it (take a look at the compiled documentation). Instead you should have removed the second colon from the `EXAMPLES::`. In other words, it should be formatted like this:

```
EXAMPLES:

Some docstring talking about the example::

    sage: 2 + 2
    4

Some more docstrings::

    sage: 4 - 2
    2
```

Thierry (or Vincent), did you have any comments about the current state of the branch?

This review is not polished, but i provide it as is, so that we can discuss. I also uploaded a (beginning of a) patch containing minor modifications, even if this corresponds to the old workflow.

---

`CFF` is not fully autonomous and behaves like an overlay over other Sage
fields, thus sacrificing reliability over expressivity.

```
sage: a = CFF(0.1)
sage: a.value()
1/10
```
vs

```
sage: a = CFF(0.1+sqrt(2))
sage: a.value()
sqrt(2) + 0.100000000000000
```

Hence the mess:

```
sage: a = CFF(0.1+sqrt(2))       
sage: b = CFF(0.1) + CFF(sqrt(2))
sage: a == b
True
```
but

```
sage: a
[1; 1, 1, 17, 11, 3, 1, 8, 2, 1, 2, 2, 281, 1, 10, 3, 2, 3, 21, 5, ...]
sage: b
[1; (1, 1, 17, 11, 3, 1, 8, 2, 1, 2, 2, 282, 2, 2, 1, 2, 8, 1, 3, 11, 17, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 2, 10, 1, 5, 1, 69, 1, 5, 1, 10, 2, 5, 3, 2)*]
```


I have not much problems with this overlay design as long as it is clearly
stated and consistent.

Note that this behaviour is not uniform, since `CFF(a).value()` is sometimes not
equal to `a`, but this is not clear when.

```
- << Return the value of "self" (the number from which it was built). >>

- << Return the value of "self" as a quadratic number (with square free
  discriminant). >>
```

This is not the role of `CFF` to canonicalize Sage real numbers, though one
could imagine such a class/function `GoodRealField`.

```
sage: CFF(sqrt(2))
[1; (2)*]
sage: CFF(sqrt(2)).value()
sqrt2

sage: CFF(0.1)
[0; 10]
sage: CFF(0.1).value()
1/10

sage: CFF(pi)
[3; 7, 15, 1, 292, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 14, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, ...]
sage: CFF(pi).value()
pi

sage: (2^(1/3)).parent()           
Symbolic Ring
sage: CFF(2^(1/3)).value().parent()
Algebraic Real Field
```


Another consequence of the overlay structure is that the inverse of a
continued fraction is not as expected (the inverse should only shift the
sequence of partial quotients):

```
sage: a = CFF(pi+0.1) ; a
[3; 4, 7, 5, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 4, 33, 4, 2, 6, 10, 3, 1, ...]
sage: ~a
[0; 3, 4, 7, 5, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 4, 33, 4, 4, 1, 1, 1, ...]
```


I do understand that this may be a transitional behaviour. But how to tell
that to sage users ?

I see two ways:

- be always an "overlay field"
- restrict the code to words (cf your issue 6) you really handle (rationals
  and quadratic irrationals, corresponding to finite and ultimately periodic
  words) ?
 
Perhaps a solution is to have two very distinct classes (with conversions) ?

---

Another issue is:

```
sage: CFF.is_exact()
True
```

I disagree with that statement, since there are approximate elements in CFF,
for example `CFF(pi+0.1)`.


---


Problems with `SR`:

```
sage: sqrt(2) == QQbar(sqrt(2))          
True

sage: CFF(sqrt(2)) == CFF(QQbar(sqrt(2)))
Wait for a long time...

sage: CFF(sqrt(2)).value().parent()
Number Field in sqrt2 with defining polynomial x^2 - 2

sage: CFF(sqrt(2)).value() == CFF(QQbar(sqrt(2))).value()
False
```


Transitivity of equality:

```
sage: bool(CFF(sqrt(2)).value() == sqrt(2))
True

sage: bool(sqrt(2)) == sqrt(QQbar(2)) 
True

sage: CFF(sqrt(2)).value() == sqrt(QQbar(2))
False
```



---

in `_element_constructor_()`

```
 - ``nterms`` -- integer (optional)

??? is that an old remaining thing ?

 - ``check`` -- boolean (optional) -- whether or not we check the

"the" what ?
```

---

When you test whether an element of `SR` is a real number, you use `RIF(x)`.
Why not using `x.is_real()` (and make this method more reliable if needed) ?

---

Another problem:

```
sage: a = RDF(0.1)
sage: CFF(a)
[0]
```

The reason is :

```
sage: (1/RIF(RDF(0.1))).unique_floor()
ValueError: interval does not have a unique floor
```

---


In the doc: "It is quite remarkable that".

Add : "- any real number admits a unique continued fraction expansion"

---

"It is also possible to create a continued fraction from a list of digits::"

I would propose : "from a list of numbers corresponding to its partial
quotients."
 

"For quadratic numbers, the syntax is quite similar and the digits are
represented as a pair of tuples, the preperiod and the period::"

Again, "digits" vs "partial quotients"

---

Another problem: 

```
sage: cf = CFF([(1,2,3),(1,2,4)]); cf.value()         
-1/86*sqrt229 + 139/86

sage: sqrt229
....
NameError: name 'sqrt229' is not defined
```


`CFF` outputs an element of a quadratic field that can not be used
furthermore.  Of course, one can get it back with `cf.parent().gen()`. Perhaps
inject those variables ?

---

"two_last_convergents" -> "last_two_convergents"

---

`_pn` and `_qn` looks good for internal variables, but i would suggest to
replace `pn()` and `qn()` methods by `numerator()` and `denominator()` to stay
consistent with rationals.

---

In the `_mpfr_` method: "It is guaranteed that the result is exact"

Floating point number are not exact, perhaps "accurate" is a better word ?

Replying to [tmonteil](#comment%3A33):

agreed. There is no transformation on input now. Most problem disappear. The only trouble might be with floating point as I decided to first convert the input into a rational. Note however that

```
sage: RR.random_element() in QQ
True
```

It is !

I do not want to make CFF inexact. The trouble comes from the unstability of CFF... If you want a friendly CFF you either have to rebuild the symbolic ring or do with it.

This is now removed

you can not believe in `is_real` but I used it.

It is now correct.
{{{
sage: continued_fraction(0.1)
[0; 10]
}}}

All occurrences of digits are removed and replaced by partial quotients.

I agree. It is quite hard to make it works. I only documented how to do
that in the method `value`.

Hello,

I am still working on this.

Firstly, it is easy to implement a class for continued fractions given by an infinite expansion... so I propose to include it in that ticket.

Secondly, I have a big open question: what should be the parent (if any) of a continued fraction? As Thierry M. already mentioned, the `CFF` class does not fit very well.

Non fast forward commit (I have just one commit from 6.2.rc0 now).

This new implementation is cleaner and needs review !

I guess we might deprecate `CFF` in an other ticket (but I will not do it).

Ralf,

the one line you add to the file was wrong. I just replace it.

I guess we should close the ticket has nobody answered on the sage-devel thread since a month now.

Hey, I just hit an annoying case...

```
sage: continued_fraction_list(1.575709393346379)
Error in lines 1-1
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: does not know how to compute the continued fraction of 1.57570939334638
```

However,

```
sage: continued_fraction_list(0 + 1.575709393346379)
[1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 18, 1, 5, 2, 22909319]
```

The problem is that RealLiteral and continued fractions no longer work together...
