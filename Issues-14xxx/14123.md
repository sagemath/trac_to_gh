Hi Viviane,

could you maybe do a little change in the `@`combinatorial_map names like in

"recursive map 'L 1 R 0' (Tamari)" -> "recursive map L1R0 (Tamari)"

to make it look a little less scary?

Hi Viviane --

I updated the patch with tons of minor changes (unfortunately, I didn't do it in a separate file to actually show the diff, sorry):

- I removed tons of trailing white spaces, and empty lines
- it's worth looking at the docbuild outcome to see what code is not yet rendering as desired.
  - you often tried to use math code, but sphinx wasn't able to figure it out (like in <code>a string, either \`1L0R\`,\`1R0L\`,\`L1R0\`,\`R1L0\`</code>). I replaced these.
  - when writing rst over multiple lines, please see that the indention is right, I also fixed several itemize going over several lines.
- I replaced the assert by a ValueError.
I hope I fixed everything, but feel free to look over it, and possibly do further changes. Otherwise, I'll give it a positive review as soon as the patchbot is happy.

Cheers, Christian

Oh ok, I see the name of the maps have been changed on the other ticket.

Thank's a lot for your review and changes. As you said, I hadn't checked the docbuild (my wrong).
I've had a look and it seems ok.
