sage: for R in [QQ, ZZ, RR, CC, NumberField(x^2+1,'a')]:
....:     print type(polygen(R).degree())
....:     
<type 'sage.rings.integer.Integer'>
<type 'int'>
<type 'int'>
<type 'sage.rings.integer.Integer'>
<type 'sage.rings.integer.Integer'>
```
At least these should be the same for QQ and K. I would prefer Integer.

1. Everywhere else it's already a Python (`def`) method.
2. If you want something fast, use the `_degree` attribute.

So I don't see any problem.
