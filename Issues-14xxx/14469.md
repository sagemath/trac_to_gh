Graphical output of plots (or other graphics objects) is hooked into `_repr_()`. Obviously, Python doesn't expect `repr` to have side effects so we get fun stuff like

```
sage: g = Graphics()
sage: g?
```
showing a plot in addition to the help. Or `(g,g)` opening two plot output windows if used on the command line. You don't want to try `[g]*100`

This patch moves the decision logic into the displayhook, and makes `repr` always return a string representation as it should.

Also, deprecate the `show_output()` function. Wat?

I've totally done something analogous to `[g]*100`.  Making lists of plots is useful, but the previous behavior was not good, and no one should have been relying on it.

I don't have time to learn about displayhook now, but the rest looks good, assuming it works properly in the notebook.

Unless... you don't suppose someone would actually want to be able to change the default behavior of (say) `[g]*100` to show all these graphics *in addition to* printing the list?  Just a crazy thought.

Two things on the current patch:

- Is there a reason why you're importing `DOCTEST_MODE` in `displayhook.py`? You don't seem to be using it.
- The method `_graphics_()` in `sage_input.py` will need a doctest.

Also I think if someone wants `[g]*100` to display all plots, we can just tell them to use `map(lambda x: x.show(), L)` where `L` is the above list since (to me) this is not likely to be very desirable...
