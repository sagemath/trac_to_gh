The issues in #14798 depend on the implementation of the PGF backend in matplotlib. I decided to check the current status by installing today's (2013/06/24) git snapshot of matplotlib in sage-5.11beta3; this is a report on this installation for future reference.

I built a spkg by crudely hacking mathplotlib-1.2.1.spkg: it is enough to replace the content of src with the new source code and edit spkg-install accordingly (comment out the patch section and the section printing MPLCONFIGDIR).

The good news is that the new package installs without problems and all the doctests run properly. 
The bad news is that none of the issues in #14798 has been addressed in the current version of matplotlib yet.

What's the problem with `MPLCONFIGDIR`?

I am not sure: it looked like the building directory was not the one the script was expecting so the file that the scripts looks for was not there. I did not want to spend time fixing it so I just commented those lines since they were was just printing the path on screen.

Are you sure mpl got installed correctly? If it can not find the file it means that mpl installed in a path different from the previous versions. That's quite strange, if it is indeed happening.
