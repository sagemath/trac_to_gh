Currently, the Partition/Diagram Algebra implementations in Sage need to be redone. This problem was identified at Sage Days 38. The documentation is not very clear on how it should be used, and although it is supposed to be an algebra, it does not follow the standard form for algebras in Sage (most likely because these algebras have not been modified since 2007.) 

This attached program seeks to provide an alternate implementation for, and eventually replace once dependencies are resolved, the existing PartionAlgebra package. More detail about these specific algebras can be found in a 2005 paper by Halverson and Ram titled "Partition Algebras." This new implementation restructures the Partition/Diagram Algebras to use the category structure in Sage, so that they are actually implemented as Algebras_with_basis.

I talked to my co-authors and we seem to agree that "PropagatingIdeal" might be a better name for a few reasons:

1) There are actually many ideals in the PartitionAlgebra.

2) It is defined based on the propagating number of the diagrams.

3) It is technically a non-unital algebra, which makes calling it an algebra debatable amongst some circles.

Once this is done, I think this enhancement is good to go.

This is a very promising patch! Some errors I found:

```
    An propogating ideal.

    A propogating ideal of rank `k` is a non-unital algebra with basis indexed
    by the collection of ideal set partitions of `\{1, \ldots, k, -1, \ldots,
    -k\}`. We say a set partition is ideal if its has propogating number is
    less than `k`.

    This algebra is thus a subalgebra of the partition algebra.
    For more information, see :class:`PartitionAlgebra`
```

I don't like this. First of all, it should be "propagating", not "propogating" (fortunately the method name is correct). Second, this should be "The", not "A", propagating ideal. Otherwise it sounds like **some** ideal generated by ideal partitions -- and there are many of those.

Actually I see the "propogating" typo elsewhere too. Also, a "with with" in the definition of `ideal_diagrams`.

Also, typo: "ommitted".

I'm not very happy with the use of floats (as in "2.5") for the "intermediate" partition algebras. Is it safe to assume that, say, `range(1,int(k+0.5))` always ends at k-0.5, or can it happen that k-0.5 is a tad smaller than an integer due to a rounding error and k-0.5 no longer falls in the interval?

There is a more serious issue with the intermediate algebras, and it's this (from your doctest):

```
        sage: da.partition_diagrams(1.5)
        [{{2, -2}, {1, -1}}, {{-1}, {2, -2}, {1}}]

If I am to follow the Halverson-Ram conventions, this should contain three more partition diagrams, e. g., {{1, -1, 2, -2}}.

Another reason why floats are a bad thing:

```
sage: da.PartitionAlgebra(3+1/2, 1, QQ, 'part') == da.PartitionAlgebra(3+1/2, 1, QQ, 'part')
True
sage: da.PartitionAlgebra(3+1/2, 1, QQ, 'part') == da.PartitionAlgebra(3.5, 1, QQ, 'part')  
False
```
I think the code should use rationals, and floats in the input should be normalized to the nearest semi-integer.

Remove the word "with" from `with propogating number less than`, since there is already a "with" on the preceding line.

There is a typo ("usualy") here:

```
        Returns the product of two basis diagrams. Usually it is not called
        directly, but indirectly through usualy arithmetic operators.
```
but actually the word can be removed.

I think the docstrings should mention the fact that the partition-to-diagram correspondence is not 1-to-1, and diagrams are usually seen just as intuitive representations of set partitions, with several different diagrams corresponding to the same set partition.

Put "k" in backticks in `The Brauer algebra of rank k`.

The docstring `        ambient returns the partition algebra the Brauer algebra is a sub-algebra of.` should be adjusted as it is defined not just for a Brauer algebra but for any subalgebra.

It seems to me that the `SubPartitionAlgebra` docstring should say that the subalgebra is spanned by a subset of the basis of the partition algebra. Otherwise the code of the `retract` method makes no sense.

There are two reasons why I left it as `0.5` instead of `1/2`, the first is that `floor` is being called and it seemed somewhat troublesome to covert it to an integer, and the second is this what the old partition algebras used (which is why I didn't look too hard to getting around the first problem). Also IMO you're abusing the input with your `==` example, so it's an unfair test.

I think that `da.partition_diagrams` is okay since its more of an internal helper function, but I'll change the output to be a list in both cases to match the output of the other such functions.

For the `0.5 +/- 0.5`, since there is no division being performed and they are specified floating points, their bit representations are the same and it's a power of two, so +/- are both okay (here). If it was say `0.1` added 10 times, then it's slightly more worrisome (but I think it's still okay...)

In any case, I'll look more deeply into seeing if I can convert this to using rationals, make sure the 1/2's are correct (and fix it if it's not), and fix those typos (including my spelling of propagate `:P`).

Thanks for your comments Darij.

Here's the folded patch which replaces asserts with raising `ValueError`s.

Sorry for not noticing that the microchange patch was not listed in the apply section.
