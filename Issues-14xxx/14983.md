[A search for “patchbot”](http://trac.sagemath.org/search?q=patchbot&noquickjump=1&changeset=on&wiki=on) yielded a list with one entry: a reference to

> [a4ddf299584ba04b3204f40161573c9fab01aaef]: Trac 10702: add patchbot to the developers guide


with the above line linked to http://trac.sagemath.org/changeset/a4ddf299584ba04b3204f40161573c9fab01aaef.

But when I follow that link, I get an error message:

> Error: Invalid Changeset Number
