Plain and simple :

```
sage: d = DiGraph({2:[1],3:[1]})   
sage: p1 = Poset(d)
sage: p2 = p1.relabel({1:1,2:3,3:2})
sage: p1.hasse_diagram() == p2.hasse_diagram()
True
sage: p1 == p2
False
```

This can be fixed by saying that two posets are equal if their hasse diagrams are equal, as it should have been since the beginning.

This will probably make poset equality much slower. On the bright side it will work correctly.

Of course this patch could have been almost trivial, but there is in the FinitePoset class a "key" argument, whose purpose is to make two posets different if they have different keys. So this patch checks that too.

And the next time that somebody will need to store pairs "(a poset, a key)", the best will be to store pairs "(a poset, a key)". And not "A poset with a key included inside, which is useful just for my own code" as one could easily believe.

Oh. And the same with linear orderings, of course.

Ok guys, you did it, I have no way to write a new `__eq__` method in `Poset` which is not "self is other" without getting an infinite loop. 

If I want to actually compare the data of the posets (hasse diagram, vertices), then  comparing the data will raise a call to compare their parents, and I'm gone for another loop.

Now what ?

We discussed this at the Sage Days last week (unfortunately you were not there). The best way might be to have an option in Posets which would allow to create posets with and without an attached linear extension. Your use case would be in the new default case of no linear extension attached.

I'm pretty sure that I was, but I admittedly have a very poor memory.

And the one without fancy stuff would be the default Poset.

My use case is the definition of what a Poset is. In any book. Also, do we overlook the fact that this is a conceptual problem of categories, and equalities, an parents, and all that stuff ?

Obviously. We all agree that this is the rationale for the new default
value.

This has nothing to do with categories. This is a consequence of the
choice of having unique representation for posets. The constructor
should do the right thing and then equality be simply tested by "is".

Now if you would not mind stopping spreading FUD on unrelated things
for no reason except that you happen to not need them yourself, «ça
nous ferait des vacances».

Nice. Now, if I have a class that I define myself which contains elements which belong to the category framework : does it mean that this class has to be `UniqueRepresentation` ? That seems to be the source of my problem above.

No. Some parents don't have unique representation.

I know it's frustrating when one can't have an influence to improve the world. But in the case at hand the only step you can take is to stop wasting our time repeating the same things over and over.

Helloooooooooooooo !!!

Okayyyyyyyyyy, I just had a nice evening with Florent which had begun with a conversation about this patch, and he said that he'd have a patch for this one month from now.

This being said, I still have no answer for a problem with categories : you say that some parents do not have a unique representation, but here is the reason behind the infinite loop I got today :

1) My Poset parent implements `__eq__` by first comparing the hasse diagrams, which leads to check that the elements of the digraph are equal.

2) In order to know whether the elements are equal, the category mechanism makes them check that they have the same parents

3) I check that the parents are equal again, and loop ...

That's why I asked whether Parents need to be UniqueRepresentation. Because if they aren't, they sure cannot compare their elements !

Generally, `==` should mean identical and not just isomorphic. Up to automorphism there is only one set of a given size. But surely we don't want all sets of fixed size to compare equal, right? 

Any two objects that satisfy `==` may be substituted for each other in cached method calls. 

If you want "isomorphic with possibly non-unique isomorphism" then just implement a `is_isomorphic()` method.

Ok, I get your point now.

That's a situation we never met before; parents not often compare
themselves by comparing (some of) their elements. When this is the
case, this probably means that those elements were part of the
definition of the parent, and thus constructed from some data that
preexisted the parent.

To break the loop, one could thus compare that data. In the case at
hand, that would amount to compare the digraph that was use as input
to the Poset constructor.

Even if this occurred from time to time, I guess I would not see this
as a recurrent problem of elements/parent, but of data structures with
loops in general.

Cheers,
                     Nicolas

Hi Nathann,

I moved your patch over to git and I found a hack which stops the infinite loop: it turns out that posets have an attribute `_hasse_diagram` and checking this seems to be better for some (unknown) reason. A few of the doctests still fail:

```
sage -t posets.py
**********************************************************************
File "posets.py", line 456, in sage.combinat.posets.posets.Poset
Failed example:

**********************************************************************

    True
**********************************************************************

Failed example:

    Hasse diagram of a poset containing 6 elements
Got:
    Digraph on 6 vertices
**********************************************************************
```
I guess that the failing equality tests are bad, but I am happy that the infinite loop is gone.

Florent, Nicolas: it would be good if you could take some time to look at this too as this has been sitting around unloved for quite awhile.

Arggggggg ! No, I think I understood ! I think that it is incorrect to compare the `._hasse_diagram` digraphs, because they are always labelled with integers, so when you do that you do not compare the vertice' labels :

```
sage: list(posets.IntegerCompositions(3)) 
[[3], [1, 2], [2, 1], [1, 1, 1]]
sage: list(posets.IntegerCompositions(3).hasse_diagram())
[[3], [1, 2], [1, 1, 1], [2, 1]]
sage: list(posets.IntegerCompositions(3)._hasse_diagram) 
[0, 1, 2, 3]
```

And of course as you compare digraphs defined on integers there is no problem, for they don't have parents. But it may say that two posets are equal even if they are defined on disjoint sets of elements.

Hello,

20 months ago, I thought that this problem would be fixed in a month. Yesterday Jori created ticket #17051 which is a bug report, apparently linked with what this ticket was meant to address.

Today is saturday. Unless somebody has a different way to solve the problem and is meaning to solve it during the week, I will create a ticket here that makes `.relabel()` return a Poset.

You cannot defend that Posets are both `UniqueRepresentation` and mutable. So `.relabel()` cannot change self. There will be no deprecation, for it is a bugfix.

`relabel()` does return a new poset. The issue is a little more subtle in regards to the ordering on the set of elements of the poset:

```
sage: list(p1)
[3, 2, 1]
sage: list(p2)
[2, 3, 1]
```
because

```
sage: p1._elements
(3, 2, 1)
sage: p2._elements
(2, 3, 1)
```
That is why they don't compare as equal (as it is part of the construction data). The simplist change (FTR, I don't consider this to be a bug, but instead a lack of documentation) would be to make the Hasse diagram the only part of the construction info, however this would mean we'd have to relabel the Hasse diagram at construction time rather than when calling `hasse_diagram()`. This also has the drawback of not being able to use the same digraph for all relabelings of a poset, which is probably used by the linear extensions and creates a much larger memory usage (and data duplication).

Hopefully before you have gotten angry, I think better standardization could be used here too.

I'm also not quite sure #17051 is because of this behavior, but I haven't really looked into it.

Yo !

> `relabel()` does return a new poset.

Oh, True, True, I had forgotten what exactly the problem was. Two years ago, after all `:-D`

Cool, then the interface will not even change.

> The simplist change would be to make the Hasse diagram the only part of the construction info, however this would mean we'd have to relabel the Hasse diagram at construction time rather than when calling `hasse_diagram()`.

Indeed.I will do just that.

I was angry two years ago, because I was told that the problem would be fixed, and it was not. Jori had been doing a lot of work to fix/improve the poset class in the last two days, and I just don't want to tell him that this bug will stay because nobody is willing to make a move.

I will write the branch that rewrites .relabel properly, and that will be all.

Okay, I am wasting my week-end on this bug that had been left to rot for 20 months again, and here is where I am:

In the `__init__` of FinitePoset you have a hasse diagram on `0,...,n-1` and a list of labels for the n points. Those are used as the key for the equality inherited from `UniqueRepresentation`.

Of course, if you apply a graph isomorphism to the list of labels it still represents the very same poset. But the key is different, so equality answers 'no'.

Guys this bug is hard to fix because there is a LOT of code that uses these functions, and there are two layers of pre-treatment (`Poset` and `FinitePoset.__classcall__`). I would appreciate it if somebody felt responsible of that and fixed it.

Nathann

P.S.: I created #17059 that fixes some other stupid bug.

Hi Nathann,

To be honest, I cannot even reproduce the bug that you reported

```
sage: d = DiGraph({2:[1],3:[1]})   
sage: sage: p1 = Poset(d)
sage: sage: p2 = p1.relabel({1:1,2:3,3:2})
/Applications/sage/src/bin/sage-ipython:1:
********************************************************************************
Relabelling posets is known to break equality between posets (P == Q)
This issue is being tracked at https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/14019.
********************************************************************************
sage: sage: p1.hasse_diagram() == p2.hasse_diagram()
True
sage: p1 == p2
True 
```
Is it possible that this was already fixed with #17059? I am running sage-6.4.beta4.

Anne

The current branch fixes the bug. The rationale is to allow posets to not have a specified linear extension. This is achieved by changing the input behavior of `FinitePoset`. If `elements` is specified, this is used for the underlying linear extension. If `elements` is None, then the default linear extension is now computed in the `__init__`, so that posets where linear extensions are not specified now compare equal.

They were all trivial failures and are fixed now!

Fixed.

If this is only for HIM, I am sure this is now in your ability range to fix it, if it is important to you!

Re docbuilding:

It definitely was, but it was fixed by commit ["e575472"](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/e575742951572b4b383abeae1e21e934b9e1683f).

You are right (I was in the wrong branch when running the tests whilst trying to investigate the doc build failure). I get the same doc failures.

Posets are used in `src/sage/modular/modform_hecketriangle/analytic_type.py`

Hello !

I think that there is something wrong with the code for canonical label:

```
sage: Poset(digraphs.Path(10)).canonical_label().linear_extension()
[0, 9, 7, 5, 3, 2, 4, 6, 8, 1]
```

In particular, the code looks like you suppose that `range(n)` is a linear extension of a canonically labelled digraph, and this is wrong:

```
sage: digraphs.Path(10).canonical_label(certify=True)[1]
{0: 0, 1: 9, 2: 7, 3: 5, 4: 3, 5: 2, 6: 4, 7: 6, 8: 8, 9: 1}
```

This seems to work fine with the latest beta release

```
sage: Poset(digraphs.Path(10)).canonical_label().linear_extension()
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```

Hi Nathann,

I am not quite sure why this is supposed to be wrong. As you wrote the output of `canonical_label` of `DiGraph` is 

```
sage: D = digraphs.Path(10)
sage: D.edges()
[(0, 1, None),
 (1, 2, None),
 (2, 3, None),
 (3, 4, None),
 (4, 5, None),
 (5, 6, None),
 (6, 7, None),
 (7, 8, None),
 (8, 9, None)]
sage: D.canonical_label().edges()
[(0, 9, None),
 (2, 4, None),
 (3, 2, None),
 (4, 6, None),
 (5, 3, None),
 (6, 8, None),
 (7, 5, None),
 (8, 1, None),
 (9, 7, None)]
```
I do not understand why (the documentation says that this is supposed to be unique, but there seems nothing unique about this particular choice to me). But with this we obtain

```
sage: P = Poset(digraphs.Path(10))
sage: Pp = P.canonical_label()
sage: Pp.cover_relations()
[[0, 9], [9, 7], [7, 5], [5, 3], [3, 2], [2, 4], [4, 6], [6, 8], [8, 1]]
sage: Pp.linear_extension()
[0, 9, 7, 5, 3, 2, 4, 6, 8, 1]
```
which is indeed the single linear extension for this poset. If this is not the desired output, perhaps someone should rewrite the documentation and specify precisely what this *unique* poset is supposed to be. Is it supposed to be naturally labelled perhaps? Is that what your problem is? It does not say so in the documentation.

Yo !

My mistake, I was convinced that I had displayed the poset with a `.show()` and looked at a path labelled with 0,1,2,3,... while the linear extension was 0,9,... There is nothing wrong with this example indeed.

This being said, i still do not understand the code. Is the following behaviour correct ?

```
sage: P = Poset(digraphs.Path(4),['a','b','c','d'],linear_extension=True)
sage: list(P.canonical_label())
[0, 1, 2, 3]
```

I do not understand what you do with the `elements` list in `canonical_label` given that the output is labelled with `0,1,2,3`. Especially when `linear_extension=False` `O_o`

Ok. Why does the documentation say *unique* though? It does not make sense to me.

I think so. The documentation says that `canonical_label` is supposed to label the poset with elements `\{0,1,\ldots,n-1\}`. I changed the code slightly, so that [0,1,2,...]
is a linear extension of the canonical relabeled poset.

> I do not understand what you do with the `elements` list in `canonical_label` given that the output is labelled with `0,1,2,3`. Especially when `linear_extension=False` `O_o`

The documentation says that canonical relabeled means indexed by `0,1,\ldots,n-1`. I did not write this code, so am not sure what this is used for. 

Internally, now the poset code still stores `P._hasse_diagram` as a Hasse diagram on `0,1,\ldots,n-1` to make it light-weight and only compare integers internally. The elements are taken from the Hasse diagram, when `elements` is not specified. So passing a Hasse diagram that is on `0,1,\ldots,n-1` will automatically make the element set equal to this.

Hello !

> Ok. Why does the documentation say *unique* though? It does not make sense to me.

Take two digraphs `D1,D2` labelled on whatever you want, and such that `D1.is_isomorphic(D2)` is True. Then `D1.canonical_label()==D2.canonical_label()` is True. In such a way, the output of `canonical_label` is unique on its isomorphism class.

To me this is a sufficient reason to raise an exception in `canonical_label` when an linear extension is defined: `DiGraph.canonical_label` ignores the linear extension, and so the output is not unique for a pair "Poset, linear extension".

I also believe that `is_isomorphic` should raise an exception in that case.

Okay, but now the code totally ignores the linear extension that may be stored within the poset. I have nothing against that, but it would be more honest to raise an exception in that case, to say to the "PosetWithLinearExtension" users that they should first explicitly convert their poset to a 'normal one' before computing that.

That condition is fine, but the labeling of the "canonical" labeling is still arbitrary and not unique (as you can see, it has changed).

> To me this is a sufficient reason to raise an exception in `canonical_label` when an linear extension is defined: `DiGraph.canonical_label` ignores the linear extension, and so the output is not unique for a pair "Poset, linear extension".

Why? Your isomorphism property is still satisfied:

```
sage: p1 = Poset(d, linear_extension=True)
sage: p2 = p1.relabel({1:1,2:3,3:2})
sage: q1 = p1.canonical_label()
sage: q2 = p2.canonical_label()
sage: q1.is_isomorphic(q2)
True
sage: q1._linear_extension
True
sage: q2._linear_extension
True
```

> I also believe that `is_isomorphic` should raise an exception in that case.

No, it checks that the posets are isomorphic (which has nothing to do with the linear extension chosen).

No, it is unique. And it is always integers from 0 to n-1.

Try it in Sage: take a graph `D1` labelled on whatever you want, then compute its canonical representative `R`. Then relabel the vertices of `D1` into a graph `D2` in any way you like: the representatie of `D2` will be equal to `R`.

> Why? Your isomorphism property is still satisfied:

Two pairs "Poset, linear_extension" are "isomorphic" if there is an isomorphism of the two posets that sends the first linear extension on the second linear extension. But we never check this second part (and similarly for the canonical representatives).

For instance, if `P` is a poset on three points 0,1,2 where the cover relations are only (1<2), then the pair "Poset, linear extension" equal to `P,[0,1,2]` is not isomorphic to `P,[1,0,2]`.

> No, it checks that the posets are isomorphic (which has nothing to do with the linear extension chosen).

Indeed, and to me that is incorrect. It is quite simple: you cannot say that two "posets with linear extension" `P1,P2` are isomorphic unless there is a relabel function `f` such that `P1.relabel(f)==P2`.

As it is implemented right now this does not hold.

However the labeling itself is not unique. Consider the path on 3 vertices with labelings `0 - 1 - 2` and `1 - 0 - 2`. The first one is no more canonical than the second.

It depends on what we want to actually check. Yet as currently stated in the documentation of `is_isomorphic`, it does return the correct value as it checks "if both posets are isomorphic". My thought is that *if* we decide we want to also check with a specified linear extension, then we add another argument to `is_isomorphic`. At present, the method should not raise an error, and this should probably be done on another ticket.

Anyways, doctests are now all fixed.

Besides Jori's report, I have one question. Why did you do this change ?

```diff
-        G = DiGraph(self._hasse_diagram).relabel(self._list, inplace=False)
+        G = DiGraph(self._hasse_diagram).relabel(self._elements, inplace=False)
```

Did the meaning of `self._list` changed in some way ? If it did, this function probably isn't the only one that needs to be updated `O_o`

More importantly: aren't `self._list` and `self._elements` the same thing ? It would be nice in a later patch to change this name is something like `linear_extension`, for it really is a pain to work with this class when variables are not named according to what they represent. And perhaps one day it will become trustworthy `:-P`

Thanks,

As long as doctests pass and the documentation builds, I'm happy. I'm also not seriously reviewing this ticket -- I haven't looked at any of the code and I don't plan to -- so everyone else needs to be happy, too.

Okay. Do you have any objections if later the following variables are renamed

- `_list` -> `_linear_extension_of_wrapped_elements`
- `_elements` -> `_linear_extension_of_unwrapped_elements` 

By the way, what would you think in this ticket of renaming the `linear_extension` parameter you added ? The name does not sound at all like it is a boolean variable, and you create a `Poset._linear_extension` variable which is boolean. If you renamed it to `Poset._carries_linear_extension` or something (whose name sounds like a boolean variable) we could rename `_list` to `_linear_extension` and `_elements` to `_linear_extension_unwrapped_elements` (which I think is better/shorter).

The thing is that if we have to rename `linear_extension` later we will have to deprecate it --> loss of time.

Thanks so much everyone for your work on this! Big kuddos to Anne and Travis for taking the lead!

I read the discussion, and the decisions taken make sense to me. I still need to have a look at the code, but what I had seen in an earlier version Anne had pointed me too was looking good, so feel free to proceed anyway.

Just one thing: I would prefer `_with_linear_extension rather` than `_carries_linear_extensions` since we already use this convention in our "WithBasis" and friends. I can do this change if you wish.
