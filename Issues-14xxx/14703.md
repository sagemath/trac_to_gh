The problem is that the group is in fact infinite (and thus cannot be represented as a permutation group). This should be handled more graciously...

Its still a fixed memory pool, with details of the size depending on whats available at startup.

GAP always used an arbitrary limit for the number of cosets, and never filled all available memory. Whether or not you hit the coset limit depends on if `4096000` cosets fit RAM or not.
