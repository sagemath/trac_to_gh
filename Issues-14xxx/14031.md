Rebasing half-built, or fully built, Sage Cygwin installation currently
needs manual labour. This patch provides shell scripts and MSDOS batch files to make this more automatic, using 'rebaseall' or 'rebase -O'. One will only needs to adjust `SAGE_ROOT` in the batch file once (per Sage install). 
The documentation (outside of within the script themselves) will be provided at #14465.

**Apply** to `sage_scripts`:

`rem` means that the whole line is commented out, same as `#` for Unix shells.
Indeed, this line can be deleted (a debugging leftover).

the batch file does the right thing, if your Cygwin is in `C:\cygwin`. Otherwise the corr. line there needs to be changed.

>since one could imagine people helping who don't know how to set paths in Windows, or even how to make env vars in Windows (e.g., I have no idea how to set `SAGE_ROOT` in the Windows command line).


no, it is meant to be changed in the batch file body. Perhaps I should mention that it is meant to call the dash script from the batch file, and not directly. 


By the way, setting `BLAH` to `foo` in the Windows command line is just

```
set BLAH=foo
```
And if you need to evaluate `BLAH` you do `%BLAH%`, e.g.

```
echo %BLAH%
```
will print `BLAH`'s value. You might also want to know that if you call dash after setting `BLAH`, it will be known to dash, and can be evaluated as usual, i.e. as `$BLAH`. dash will also treat `PATH` in a special way, by trying to translate it into Cygwin's PATH in some cases. But I digressed. :-)

<a id='comment:17'></a>I had a situation when I needed to rebase before sage_scripts spkg was installed (while building python spkg), so sage-rebase was not installed.

This is a kind of bug I don't know how to address properly (although installing the spkg with ./sage -f did help).
At least this got to be documented.

Move the scripts to `$SAGE_ROOT/spkg/bin`. That's really the place for scripts which are needed at build-time.
