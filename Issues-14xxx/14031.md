Rebasing half-built, or fully built, Sage Cygwin installation currently
needs manual labour. This patch provides shell scripts and MSDOS batch files to make this more automatic, using 'rebaseall' or 'rebase -O'. One will only needs to adjust `SAGE_ROOT` in the batch file once (per Sage install). 
The documentation (outside of within the script themselves) will be provided at #14465.

I don't know what you mean by "right way".  I usually go into `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin` and do hg commands from that repository...

```
rem dash %SAGE_ROOT%\local\bin\s.sh 
```
But the script isn't called `s.sh`?  I know nothing about DOS so maybe this is obviously right.

An additional remark in the script about just using `C:\cygwin\bin\dash.exe` in the command prompt would not be amiss, since one could imagine people helping who don't know how to set paths in Windows, or even how to make env vars in Windows (e.g., I have no idea how to set `SAGE_ROOT` in the Windows command line).

I was wondering whether I need to wrap it up in an spkg...

`rem` means that the whole line is commented out, same as `#` for Unix shells.
Indeed, this line can be deleted (a debugging leftover).

> 
> An additional remark in the script about just using `C:\cygwin\bin\dash.exe` in the command prompt would not be amiss, 

the batch file does the right thing, if your Cygwin is in `C:\cygwin`. Otherwise the corr. line there needs to be changed.

>since one could imagine people helping who don't know how to set paths in Windows, or even how to make env vars in Windows (e.g., I have no idea how to set `SAGE_ROOT` in the Windows command line).

no, it is meant to be changed in the batch file body. Perhaps I should mention that it is meant to call the dash script from the batch file, and not directly. 


By the way, setting `BLAH` to `foo` in the Windows command line is just

```
set BLAH=foo
```
And if you need to evaluate `BLAH` you do `%BLAH%`, e.g.

```
echo %BLAH%
```
will print `BLAH`'s value. You might also want to know that if you call dash after setting `BLAH`, it will be known to dash, and can be evaluated as usual, i.e. as `$BLAH`. dash will also treat `PATH` in a special way, by trying to translate it into Cygwin's PATH in some cases. But I digressed. :-)

I'm not sure #14465 should be an explicit dependency.
The script are already self documented, so we could merge this even without #14465.

Fair enough.

By the way, I give positive review to the actual commands, as does no doubt J-P.    But I haven't (and won't have) had the chance to try out the actual scripts "in production" as my Cygwin is not available currently, and someone should try them in such a situation just to make sure we didn't miss a typo or something, or that the extreme minimality of the shells in Windows doesn't cause one of them to hiccup (`dash` doesn't even have an `ls` command!).

I had a situation when I needed to rebase before sage_scripts spkg was installed (while building python spkg), so sage-rebase was not installed.

This is a kind of bug I don't know how to address properly (although installing the spkg with ./sage -f did help).
At least this got to be documented.
