Old description

In #8386 we decided to only move iet to sage/dynamics. This ticket stands for the creation of the new datatype and the correction of the following bug

```
sage: p = iet.Permutation('a b','b a')
sage: q = iet.Permutation('b a','a b')
sage: p == q
True
```

Assignee: sage-combinat

CC:  fougeroc

Keywords: iet, flat surfaces

Reviewer: Frédéric Chapoton

Resolution: fixed

<a id='comment:8'></a>Hi Frederic,

Your comment on trac will not appear in the git history. So please, set your message to "rebase #14683 on sage-X.betaY" or something meaningful. The fact that it is "just a rebase" is not an argument to have an ugly commit message.

And yes it is in needs review.

<a id='comment:12'></a>Hello Vincent,

I am in the middle of the process of reading quickly the code, making small cosmetic changes, like putting doctest continuation and raise statements to new standards, etc. Once done, I will run the tests.

If the tests pass, I could give a positive review, but without checking the new data structure. would it be ok to you ? Have you used this branch heavily, so that you know that it works (and is really better than the current state) ?

Bad design choice ;-P

This ticket is pending since it needs some more intensive testing/proof of concepts.
