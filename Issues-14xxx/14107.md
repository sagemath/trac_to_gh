Beside Littlewood-Richardson coefficient calculations and fusion
products, Anders Buch's lrcalc C library implements quantum products,
using the rim-hook rewriting rule (this corresponds to cup products in
the cohomology of quantum Grassmanian variety). The latter
functionality needs to be exposed in Sage's interface to lrcalc.

Roadmap:

Change mult to accept a "quantum" argument:

```
def mult(part1, part2, maxrows=None, level=None, quantum=None):
    """

    ...

    - ``quantum`` -- an element of a ring


    ...

    EXAMPLES::

        sage: var('q')
        sage: mult([1],[2,1],2,2, quantum=q)
        {[2, 2]: 1, []: q}
        sage: mult([2,1],[2,1],2,2, quantum=q)
        {[2]: q, [1,1]: q} 
   """
```

If `quantum` is set, then `maxrows` and `level` should be
set.  Looking at <lrcalc>src/mult.c one would just need to call the
quantum_reduce function function on the result of lrcalc's
`mult_c`. The result is a list of hash tables, each giving one
homogeneous pieces of the result w.r.t. `q`.

Here is a patch which **is not working** !

I have been unable to sort things out.

Maybe some Cython expert can help to correct it ?
