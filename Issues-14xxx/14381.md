Even though we don't make m4 spkg standard yet, I think it's a good idea to split it from the big autotools one.

And as it's a Sage prereq on all platform and it may happen that the usually installed system-wide one can be broken, it will ease things to have it as a separate spkg for people who want to install a recent m4 through m4, or for us if one day we decide to make it standard.

I don't think so.
Note that m4 is a prereq on every platform anyway.
