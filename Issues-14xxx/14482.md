For the record I've built on the current code at https://github.com/vbraun/SageUI/tree/release/src/sageui/model. Changes incude

* Use proxy objects instead of having to import magic constants:
  {{{
In [3]: git.status()   # return stdout by default, the most desirable behaviour
Out[3]: '# On branch dev_scripts\nnothing to commit, working directory clean\n'

In [4]: git.exit_code.status()
Out[4]: 0

In [5]: git.silent.status()

In [6]: git.echo.status()
# On branch dev_scripts
nothing to commit, working directory clean
  }}}
* Don't hardcode the Sage repo directory, this is probably going to be useful elsewhere
* Use the `GIT_DIR` and `GIT_WORK_TREE` environment variables instead of `--git-dir` (though warning: there seems to be a bug in `git status`, it is not respecting `GIT_WORK_TREE`)
* Split the git interface (handling the mechanics of interfacing with the git binary) from the logical repository handling (like the `create_ticket` method)
* Put all the doctesting setup into a utility class instead of having lengthy sections creating `Doctest*` classes and sample repos.

Right, this is syntactically much nicer. I changed this in my branch.
> * Don't hardcode the Sage repo directory, this is probably going to be useful elsewhere
 
Where is the repo hardcoded?
> * Use the `GIT_DIR` and `GIT_WORK_TREE` environment variables instead of `--git-dir` (though warning: there seems to be a bug in `git status`, it is not respecting `GIT_WORK_TREE`)
 
Could you explain the benefit of GIT_DIR and GIT_WORK_TREE?
> * Split the git interface (handling the mechanics of interfacing with the git binary) from the logical repository handling (like the `create_ticket` method)
 
`create_ticket` is not part of the git interface anymore. Are there any other methods you want to move?
> * Put all the doctesting setup into a utility class instead of having lengthy sections creating `Doctest*` classes and sample repos.
 
Good point. I was not sure initially what the doctests would look like. Now it seems that there are only two cases (one user, two users). I'll put the usual setup into special functions.

> Functionally, setting `GIT_DIR` and `GIT_WORK_TREE` is basically equivalent to setting `--git-dir` and always chdir-ing to the right directory.


Not quite, setting `GIT_WORK_TREE` doesn't behave the same as chdir-ing to a given directory, it simply specifies what git should consider is the root of work tree -- it will still display relative paths to the current directory (for all commands, as far as I can tell) if the current directory is a within the specified work tree.

If you are using the dev scripts then you never get to see the actual branch name, so it shouldn't matter. If not then you should have tab-completion for git branches, making it into a non-issue as well. 

In any case, we can easily add that later so its not important for the first release of the dev scripts.

<a id='comment:0'></a>I used INFO to log messages about how to proceed, this is one of the crucial features that make git usable:

```
$ git status
# On branch dev_scripts
# Your branch is ahead of 'trac/u/vbraun/dev_scripts' by 11 commits.
#   (use "git push" to publish your local commits)
#
# Untracked files:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
#
#	test
nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```
Everything with comment markers is what I call INFO. I spent a lot of time observing people trying to use the dev scripts last week and not being told about the next logical step is a huge obstacle.

There are lots of DEBUG messages (=stuff that protocols the execution flow like "operation completed successfully") that are mislabeled as INFO. If you don't want to see unless you are trying to debug the program then it should be DEBUG.

We can have an intermediate INFO < HELP < NORMAL level if somebody really has a use for non-debug informational messages but I think that would be overkill.
