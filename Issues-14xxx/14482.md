Also, I'm not entirely happy with the git interface. Though I also think its good enough to use in the git scripts and its probably a bad idea to do any architectural changes at this point. For the record I've built on the current code at https://github.com/vbraun/SageUI/tree/release/src/sageui/model. Changes incude

* Use proxy objects instead of having to import magic constants:
  {{{
In [3]: git.status()   # return stdout by default, the most desirable behaviour
Out[3]: '# On branch dev_scripts\nnothing to commit, working directory clean\n'

In [4]: git.exit_code.status()
Out[4]: 0

In [5]: git.silent.status()

In [6]: git.echo.status()
# On branch dev_scripts
nothing to commit, working directory clean
  }}}
* Don't hardcode the Sage repo directory, this is probably going to be useful elsewhere
* Use the `GIT_DIR` and `GIT_WORK_TREE` environment variables instead of `--git-dir` (though warning: there seems to be a bug in `git status`, it is not respecting `GIT_WORK_TREE`)
* Split the git interface (handling the mechanics of interfacing with the git binary) from the logical repository handling (like the `create_ticket` method)
* Put all the doctesting setup into a utility class instead of having lengthy sections creating `Doctest*` classes and sample repos.

Where is the repo hardcoded?
> * Use the `GIT_DIR` and `GIT_WORK_TREE` environment variables instead of `--git-dir` (though warning: there seems to be a bug in `git status`, it is not respecting `GIT_WORK_TREE`)
 
Could you explain the benefit of GIT_DIR and GIT_WORK_TREE?

`create_ticket` is not part of the git interface anymore. Are there any other methods you want to move?

Good point. I was not sure initially what the doctests would look like. Now it seems that there are only two cases (one user, two users). I'll put the usual setup into special functions.

Not quite, setting `GIT_WORK_TREE` doesn't behave the same as chdir-ing to a given directory, it simply specifies what git should consider is the root of work tree -- it will still display relative paths to the current directory (for all commands, as far as I can tell) if the current directory is a within the specified work tree.

Thanks!

There is a minor annoyance left, I have already set up ssh keys yet the dev scripts insist on doing it again and prompt for username/password. We should first check if authetication to gitolite works, and only upload keys if it doesn't. I suggest the following test: Run

```
ssh -o "StrictHostKeyChecking yes" -o "PasswordAuthentication no" -o "PubkeyAuthentication yes" -p 2222 git@trac.sagemath.org help
```
If the exit code is 0, then the host key and ssh keys are already set up.

No it does not. man git says:

Higher level SCMs may provide and manage additional information in the $GIT_DIR.

Do you want to spit in the original author's face and delete his description [Y/N]?

If you are using the dev scripts then you never get to see the actual branch name, so it shouldn't matter. If not then you should have tab-completion for git branches, making it into a non-issue as well. 

In any case, we can easily add that later so its not important for the first release of the dev scripts.

I'm pretty happy with the rename. Two things remain:

```
    reset-to-clean-working-directory
                        Drop any uncommitted changes in the working directory.
```
should be something like

```
    clean               Delete all uncommited changes.
```
And `unstash` is not a word, its akin to "unspend" not being the opposite of "spend". It should be removed (my favorite) or renamed to `stash apply' (preferably) or 'stash-apply' (if we really must).

I'm happy with the `clean` rename, but I think `unstash` is better than either of the alternatives you've suggested, even if it's not a word.

I tried out the "stash" feature and it doesn't stash anything. It reimplements something that is similar but using branches instead of the git stash stack. So if this is the desired effect then we shouldn't call it stash, which also resolves the unstash naming question. Just call its save/restore or something like that.

I used INFO to log messages about how to proceed, this is one of the crucial features that make git usable:

```
$ git status
# On branch dev_scripts
# Your branch is ahead of 'trac/u/vbraun/dev_scripts' by 11 commits.
#   (use "git push" to publish your local commits)
#
# Untracked files:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
#
#	test
nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```
Everything with comment markers is what I call INFO. I spent a lot of time observing people trying to use the dev scripts last week and not being told about the next logical step is a huge obstacle.

There are lots of DEBUG messages (=stuff that protocols the execution flow like "operation completed successfully") that are mislabeled as INFO. If you don't want to see unless you are trying to debug the program then it should be DEBUG.

We can have an intermediate INFO < HELP < NORMAL level if somebody really has a use for non-debug informational messages but I think that would be overkill.

I am having trouble importing Hg patches. I added an issue to the Github page with the details.

EDIT - Also I don't like that when aborting patch imports that it deletes all untracked directories (in particular, documentation output). I'd prefer if we could only delete newly created directories.

Thanks for all your work on this.

I'm sure there are a lot of small things that could be improved, but improvement requests should go into a separate ticket by now. Unless you think that the deleting of documentation output merits delaying the git transition.
