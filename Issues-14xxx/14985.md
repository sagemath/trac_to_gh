Maybe we could make this a blocker for 5.11?
Note that different fixes are already proposed on the upstream bugtracker, so that crafting an spkg will not take ages.

I'm sorry I had no time to test the 5.10 rc's on Cygwin and let that go in...
let's try to release a 5.11 version compilable on Cygwin(32)!
