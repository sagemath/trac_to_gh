This also breaks the show() function of this trivial binary tree.

Patch coming in a couple minutes.

Warning: compatibility with queue not checked, I'm still working off 5.9 sage-main with only #8703 installed.

Apply: nothing. This is a duplicate ticket.

Hellooooooooooooo !

You change the associated graph of an empty binary tree to a non-empty graph, but what about these things ?

```
sage: t1 = BinaryTree()
sage: t1
.
sage: t1.graph().vertices()
[0]
sage: list(t1)
[]
sage: list(t1.paths())
[]
sage: t1.depth()
0
```

There is now a similar problem with the new method `to_undirected_graph` (since #14784):

```
sage: bt=BinaryTree()
sage: bt.to_undirected_graph()
Graph on 1 vertex
```
It should return the empty graph. The problem come from

```
sage: bt.as_ordered_tree()

which should raise an exception.

Patch functionality moved over to #14498.

`as_ordered_tree` now raises an exception on empty tree.\\
`to_undirected_graph` on empty tree gives the empty graph.\\
Instead of renaming the currently existing `graph` method as `completed_graph`, I added a `reduced_graph` method. (My fix for the `graph` method is also in.) I did not implement anything similar for `to_undirected_graph`, because that was already done (modulo the bug I fixed) using an optional keyword variable.

I did not do anything about `list` and `paths` since these methods seem to be in a different file.

Anyone look at my #14498 patch and tell me if I'm on the right track?

Hello Darij,

yes, what you do seems correct.

Instead of having two methods `graph` and `reduced_graph`, I would rather have a keyword `with_leaves` added to the method `graph`.

I have discussed this matter with Viviane recently, and she had suggestions on how to do that, and even code, but she is probably very busy at the moment.

Cheers,

Frederic

    "body": "<a id='comment:15'>**Comment 15:**</a>\nHi Frederic,\n\nthanks for the comments.\n\nHaving a keyword for `graph` seems more reasonable indeed, but there is a problem with this. If I set the default option to ignore leaves, then it changes the semantics of the method (currently it doesn't ignore leaves). If I set the default option to use leaves, then it is the opposite of the default option in `to_undirected_graph`. So I would be either planting a backwards compatibility landmine or a false analogy landmine. Which is better?\n\nOr, wait. Should I deprecate `graph` and introduce a `to_graph` method instead (for better analogy with `to_undirected_graph`)?\n\nBest regards,\\\\\nDarij",

Hi Frederic,

thanks for the comments.

Having a keyword for `graph` seems more reasonable indeed, but there is a problem with this. If I set the default option to ignore leaves, then it changes the semantics of the method (currently it doesn't ignore leaves). If I set the default option to use leaves, then it is the opposite of the default option in `to_undirected_graph`. So I would be either planting a backwards compatibility landmine or a false analogy landmine. Which is better?

Or, wait. Should I deprecate `graph` and introduce a `to_graph` method instead (for better analogy with `to_undirected_graph`)?

Best regards,\\
Darij

Hello,

I would vote for keeping the current behaviour as default behaviour. If this is documented, the lack of coherence with another distinct method is not a problem i.m.h.o.

Hi,

I've uploaded an improved version on the #14498 ticket (twice -- sorry for that). If you can greenlight my changes, I'll continue reviewing #14498.

As far as I understand now, `list` and `paths()` work fine already, so there is nothing to fix about them.

Best regards,\\

Yes, looks good, you have my green light.

In the `is_full` method, I have found that the sentence

```
A full binary tree is a tree in which every node either has two 
child nodes or has two child leaves. 
```
is not quite correct. It should say that every node which is not a leaf has two children.
