This also breaks the show() function of this trivial binary tree.

Patch coming in a couple minutes.

Warning: compatibility with queue not checked, I'm still working off 5.9 sage-main with only #8703 installed.

Apply: nothing. This is a duplicate ticket.

You change the associated graph of an empty binary tree to a non-empty graph, but what about these things ?

```
sage: t1 = BinaryTree()
sage: t1

sage: t1.graph().vertices()
[0]
sage: list(t1)

I do not use these classes, and I do not really understand what they had in mind indeed. But what I believe is that changing the graph function to return a graph one 1 vertex instead of 0 does not match what they had in mind when they wrote it either, so I think that it makes more sense to keep the graph as it was before, and fix the plot problem in a different way.

Just my opinion, of course, and I really do not use those classes. So if you think that it is better to change the output of this graph() function I will let somebody who understands all this better than I do review that patch !

<a id='comment:14'></a>Hello Darij,

yes, what you do seems correct.

Instead of having two methods `graph` and `reduced_graph`, I would rather have a keyword `with_leaves` added to the method `graph`.

I have discussed this matter with Viviane recently, and she had suggestions on how to do that, and even code, but she is probably very busy at the moment.

Cheers,

Frederic

<a id='comment:19'></a>I've been following what seems to be the more common notation in the sourcecode, and understanding "node" to mean "interior node", i. e., "non-leaf vertex". Should I change this or better document this?

Also, this is not really relevant to #14564, but since we're discussing in this ticket already: The q-hook length formula in #14498 still uses a q from the SymbolicRing. Should I change it to take any arbitrary input as q, defaulting to a polynomial variable over ZZ?
