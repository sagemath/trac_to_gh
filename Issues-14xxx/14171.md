As reported on sage-devel (https://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-devel/K1ytSY-3Uro/discussion)

I tried "./sage -i database_gap" but it died with an error:

```
Installed tomlib database.
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/.../sage-5.7/local/bin/sage-eval", line 14, in <module>
    eval(compile(s,'<cmdline>','exec'))
  File "<cmdline>", line 1, in <module>

    for F in os.listdir(GAP_DIR):
OSError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/home/NewUser/.sage/gap'
