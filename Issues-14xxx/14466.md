as mentioned on https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=fr&fromgroups=#!topic/sage-devel/wuwWfhWnbCg, there is an issue with `type` in doctests. When using `type` in an interactive session we get for example:

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
| Sage Version 5.8, Release Date: 2013-03-15                         |
| Type "notebook()" for the browser-based notebook interface.        |
| Type "help()" for help.                                            |
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage: type(ZZ)
sage.rings.integer_ring.IntegerRing_class
```
However, when we put that in a doctest, we get an error:

```
tarte% cat /tmp/a.py
def test():
    """
    EXAMPLE::

        sage: type(ZZ)
        sage.rings.integer_ring.IntegerRing_class
    """
    pass
tarte% /localdisk/tmp/sage-5.8/sage -t /tmp/a.py
sage -t  "/tmp/a.py"                                        
**********************************************************************
File "/tmp/a.py", line 5:
    sage: type(ZZ)
Expected:
    sage.rings.integer_ring.IntegerRing_class
Got:
    <type 'sage.rings.integer_ring.IntegerRing_class'>
**********************************************************************
1 items had failures:
   1 of   4 in `__main__`.example_0
***Test Failed*** 1 failures.
For whitespace errors, see the file /users/caramel/zimmerma/.sage//tmp/a_11238.py
         [2.1 s]
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The following tests failed:


        sage -t  "/tmp/a.py"
Total time for all tests: 2.2 seconds
```
A workaround is to put `print type(...)` in the doctest, but this prints the form `<type 'sage.rings.integer_ring.IntegerRing_class'>` which is not so nice...

David, yes, however this workaround describes how to get `<type ...>` in the interactive session.

We want the opposite: get `sage.rings.integer_ring.IntegerRing_class` in the doctest, like the user gets in her/his interactive session.

Thus we want that the result "Got" in doctests matches what we get in an interactive session.
If this means we should add a special instruction at the beginning of **our** doctests, it is fine for us. No need to change all Sage doctests.

Do you mean that book has already been printed? I'd say you can just update the book (immediately for the online version; in the next edition for a printed version, if that exists) to work correctly.

I think we've had a very small window where the new IPython has been printing different `type` representations.

It's pretty clear to me that we want to ensure that our doctests test the same output as produced by an interactive session (they are documentation as well as tests!).

The string `<type '...'>` is the straight `str` of a type. Changing the doctest framework to test against anything else in a robust way means that we'd have to change the doctest framework so that any return value gets passed through the same print hooks that IPython offers.

The alternative seems much easier: Change IPython to (mostly) just produce the straight `str` or `repr`. 

> Thus we want that the result "Got" in doctests matches what we get in an interactive session.


Which we can accomplish by ensuring that the interactive session does give the same result as it did a while ago. Are you particularly married to this new, modified interactive result we're getting due to the IPython upgrade?

**EDIT:** In fact, in [the latest version 1.0.9](http://purple.lateralis.org/sagebook-r1014.pdf), your book on page 47 has

```
sage: o = 12/35
sage: type(o)
<type 'sage.rings.rational.Rational'>
```
so I think you *do* want to go back to the old printing. We can easily do so by catching `type` objects in `sage.misc.displayhook.format_obj`. That unifies our printing again.

An additional reason to do so is that printing a type in the notebook still gives the normal `<type '...'>` result as well. I think that really shows that we don't want the special `IPython` behaviour in sage (doctest and notebook outvote IPython in my opinion).
