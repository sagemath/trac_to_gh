If the GCC spkg has been installed and MPIR (or MPFR, MPC) gets rebuilt, then GCC doesn't work properly during the "install" phase of MPIR, because GCC uses the MPIR libraries.

Therefore we must ensure that nothing gets built in parallel with MPIR, MPFR, MPC if the GCC spkg has been installed.

Since "non-Sage" GCCs may use Sage's shared libraries as well, the patch now (re)builds them serially regardless of whether Sage's GCC is installed or not.

Hopefully nobody uses `${SAGE_LOCAL}/bin/gcc`  just as a wrapper script (or a link to some `gcc`)... ;-)




Regarding useless rebuilds, doesn't `sage-spkg mpir` (e.g.) always `touch` `spkg/installed/mpir-...` such that `make` will (at least attempt to) rebuild anything depending on it (same for MPFR, MPC)?

This will usually just lead to "foo is already installed" (although again `touch`ing the corresponding file `spkg/installed/foo-...`), but if `SAGE_UPGRADING=yes`, all packages depending on it/these will actually (recursively) get rebuilt.

:-)

If any of MPIR, MPFR or MPC (or ZLIB, wow!) changed, GCC gets rebuilt (in upgrades) anyway, so I'd move rebuilding MPIR/MPFR/MPC (with the just-built GCC) just to the GCC build rule.

In case anybody is wondering:

The rebuild of MPIR, MPFR and MPC gets triggered by the GCC spkg's `spkg-install`:

```sh
...
# Force re-installation of mpir, mpfr and mpc with the GCC we just built.
cd "$SAGE_ROOT/spkg/installed"
rm -f mpir-* mpfr-* mpc-*
```

(It would IMHO be much clearer if that was part of the `make` receipt for GCC.)

Ok, it doesn't cause *more* rebuilds than now, but...

Imagine (just) zlib got upgraded, and GCC gets (re)built:  Then any spkg (directly or indirectly) depending on any of MPIR, MPFR or MPC will also get rebuilt.  (You may argue that if GCC got rebuilt, it's "ok" or "necessary" to rebuild the rest as well, but compare this to the situation when Sage's GCC is *not* installed/used...)

Anyway, the patch here fixes the race condition *with Sage's GCC* (although actually only small parts of the `make install` of MPIR, MPFR and MPC are critical, and the race conditions can still happen with "non-Sage" GCCs).

So if Karl-Dieter is happy (and doesn't object), I'd reluctantly say "positive review"...

To be more precise:  You could actually drop the `if [ -x "$$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/gcc" ]; then ...`, because such race conditions could happen with "non-Sage" GCCs as well, and because of what you said above (and because building these spkgs serially doesn't significantly increase the overall build time).

Now probably for a follow-up:

`$(INST)/$(GCC)` should also depend on `toolchain-deps`, since otherwise MPIR, MPFR, MPC and ZLIB may (still) get built in parallel as prerequisites of the GCC spkg (i.e., when built the first time, and GCC gets installed).


We could also be a bit smarter regarding whether `CC` is GCC, and whether we're using a GCC version >= 4.5 (as older versions don't use GMP/MPFR/MPC).

(Re)building PPL may also break a running GCC (if LTO is used);  fortunately our PPL spkg is pretty outdated... ;-)

Ooops, >= 4.4?  I don't recall right now.  (At least Ubuntu's GCC 4.4.3 already uses GMP and MPFR.)
