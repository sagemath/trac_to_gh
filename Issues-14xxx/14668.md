There are several bitset tools in the matroid code:

* pickling/unpickling
* rev_lex comparison
* bitset_morph

These should be moved into sage.misc.

Hellooooooooooooooo !!

Just a couple of comments :

I thought at first that your `bitset_rev_lex_cmp` function was wrong, and I noticed later that I had read "reverse lexicographic order" as "co-lex order" (i.e. the lexicographic order on words when you read them from right to left instead). Turns out that this "reverse lexicographic order" can be obtained by adding a "-" to a call to the previous function.

I personally think that risking this confusion is not worth saving a `-` in a source code, and that this '-' is not worth the space it takes to store the code of this function in bitset.pxi either. Well, that's just my advice, I don't mind much, I just say it aloud, do as you wish.

I also did not understand from its docstring what `bitset_morph` does, and so I read the code. First, I think that "function" would be better than "morphism" in this context. And as this actually computes the image of a bitset by a function, renaming it to `bitset_image` or `bitset_function_image` would make sense to me... What do you think ?

Anyway, have fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuunnn !!!

Hello,

I'm giving here some comments that could either be used to improve this patch or be considered for a future patch.

With path #13352, I tried to speed-up the `bitset_len` method using popcount. I have not finalized the patch because the solution I have proposed is not satisfactory. In particular, it has been suggested to use the low level `__builtin_popcount()` method, but my trials were not successful. Another remark was that GMP has functions like `mpz_popcount()` for `mpz_t`.

In fact, the `mpz_t` type of GMP is similar to the `bitset_s` type we have here, and the `bitset_lex_cmp` method proposed in this patch corresponds to the `mpz_cmp` method of GMP.

Since GMP is optimized for most processors (and used for arbitrary length numbers in sage), it would be nice to use it here. But may be this is relevant for (Frozen)Bitset only?

David.
