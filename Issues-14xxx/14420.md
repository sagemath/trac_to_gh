<div id="comment:0"></div>

Try the following after setting your ulimit

```
$ ulimit -v 2000000 # 2G max of virtual memory
$ sage
...
sage: Compositions(2, min_part=0).list()
...
MemoryError:
```
I suspect the Compositions code goes into an infinite recursion or something which eats up all the memory on the system.

This memory error can be easily avoided by checking that the `length` keyword is nonempty or that the `max_length` (or `outer` -- it seems to affect the max length) is set by the user whenever `min_part=0` is passed as an argument.

You are actually asking for an infinite list:

```
sage: l = Compositions(2, min_part=0)
/home/data/Sage-Install/sage-5.8/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/combinat/composition.py:1036: RuntimeWarning: Currently, setting min_part=0 produces Composition objects which violate internal assumptions.  Calling methods on these objects may produce errors or WRONG results!
  warn("Currently, setting min_part=0 produces Composition objects which violate internal assumptions.  Calling methods on these objects may produce errors or WRONG results!", RuntimeWarning)
sage: it = iter(l)
sage: it.next()
[2]
sage: it.next()
[1, 1]
sage: it.next()
[1, 0, 1]
sage: it.next()
[1, 0, 0, 1]
sage: it.next()
[1, 0, 0, 0, 1]
sage: it.next()
[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
sage: it.next()
[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
sage: it.next()
[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
sage: it.next()
[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
sage: it.next()
[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
sage: it.next()
[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
sage: it.next()
[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
sage: it.next()
[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
sage: it.next()
[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
...
```

So what is needed is to detect if the set is finite or not and to set up the proper category `EnumeratedSet.Finite()` or `EnumeratedSet.Infinite()` as in

```
sage: Compositions().list()
[...]
NotImplementedError: infinite list
```
