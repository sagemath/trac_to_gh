Try the following after setting your ulimit

```
$ ulimit -v 2000000 # 2G max of virtual memory
$ sage
...
sage: Compositions(2, min_part=0).list()
...
MemoryError:
```
I suspect the Compositions code goes into an infinite recursion or something which eats up all the memory on the system.

This memory error can be easily avoided by checking that the `length` keyword is nonempty or that the `max_length` (or `outer` -- it seems to affect the max length) is set by the user whenever `min_part=0` is passed as an argument.

You are actually asking for an infinite list:

```
sage: l = Compositions(2, min_part=0)
/home/data/Sage-Install/sage-5.8/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/combinat/composition.py:1036: RuntimeWarning: Currently, setting min_part=0 produces Composition objects which violate internal assumptions.  Calling methods on these objects may produce errors or WRONG results!
  warn("Currently, setting min_part=0 produces Composition objects which violate internal assumptions.  Calling methods on these objects may produce errors or WRONG results!", RuntimeWarning)
sage: it = iter(l)
sage: it.next()
[2]
sage: it.next()
[1, 1]
sage: it.next()
[1, 0, 1]
sage: it.next()
[1, 0, 0, 1]
sage: it.next()
[1, 0, 0, 0, 1]
sage: it.next()
[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
sage: it.next()
[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
sage: it.next()
[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
sage: it.next()
[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
sage: it.next()
[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
sage: it.next()
[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
sage: it.next()
[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
sage: it.next()
[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
sage: it.next()
[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
...
```

So what is needed is to detect if the set is finite or not and to set up the proper category `EnumeratedSet.Finite()` or `EnumeratedSet.Infinite()` as in

```
sage: Compositions().list()
[...]
NotImplementedError: infinite list
```

Shouldn't `IntegerVectors` be called directly from inside `Compositions` if `min_part=0` is passed as an argument? If we already have a solution which can handle this case of `min_part=0`, why are we still providing the big scary warning?

Or, is it the case that `Compositions` is more general than `IntegerVectors`, even if we restrict ourselves to the case `min_part=0`?

If it should do anything, it should adjust `min_part` to fit it's own internal assumptions. Nevertheless we still need this mentioned in the doc, but probably not so buried in it. I'm cc-ing Nicolas to get his opinion on this.
