Using unicode, one can get the banner to look like that:

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

│ Type "help()" for help.                                            │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

ok, you are right. But what to do ?
It seems to be sufficient to replace the line 343 in $SAGE_ROOT/spkg/bin/sage by

```
    exec sed -n -e '/Version/s/^[ │]\{1,\}//;/Version/s/[ │]\{1,\}$//p' \
```
But maybe one has to declare the unicode encoding in the first line of this file too ? I do not know is bash is friendly with unicode.

And I have no idea how to deal with this kind of change, I have only worked with patches so far, never with any spkg.

I wonder whether coloured UTF-8 passes easily on most terminal, in particular quite a lot of users use sage through a ssh connection. I didn't test further, but on `xvt` (Debian wheezy) i got:

Acces via various ssh connection (especially Putty on windows connecting to various server settings) should be tested as well.

While i find this banner very pretty, i do not have any idea how to fix this encoding issue. Any idea ?

This is somewhat unrelated comment, but the following may be considered by the patch writer.

The first line  "Sage Version 5.8, Release Date: 2013-03-15" may be simplified to

"Sage 5.8, released on 2013-03-15"

I think currently "Version" is unduly prominent and "Date" seems redundant. Too much minimalistic? :-)

I used the patch, and I think it is beautiful.  I completely disagree with the comments such as " I dislike the UTF-8 banner because it looks too nice." and "Keep the banner short and simple ; people don't come to sage to enjoy that sight!"    Clean beauty is exactly what people (at least me!) want in software.  The banner in Sage right now, which I probably wrote (?), looks frankly ugly and like a hack, compared to the one on this patch.   

Also, UTF is clearly the future of strings, having native default support in modern interpreters, editors, etc., and also being critical to supporting users who aren't using English.

This patch is along the same lines as the recent inclusion of a nice color prompt (thanks volker), in that it makes Sage prettier and more pleasant to use. 

So my strong vote *for* this ticket.  Moreover, I like it so much I'll be henceforth applying it to the standard system-wide version of Sage at https://cloud.sagemath.com, even if it doesn't get into Sage.     In particular, I disagree with " If you're doing something that requires nice output you should probably be using a notebook interface anyways" -- since the terminal interface *is* part of the notebook interface now, and it must look nice.
