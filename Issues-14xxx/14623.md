The test will call a Python subprocess at a random moment and verify that GP/Pari shuts down. But depending on timings I get two different outputs: Either

```
An exception has occurred, use %tb to see the full traceback.

SystemExit

sage: 
Exiting Sage (CPU time 0m0.02s, Wall time 0m0.11s).
Exiting spawned PARI/GP interpreter process.
```
or

```
Traceback (most recent call last)...
TypeError: 'int' object is not callable
Exiting Sage (CPU time 0m0.36s, Wall time 0m0.38s).
Exiting spawned PARI/GP interpreter process.
```
But the doctest

```
    sage: P.stdout.read()  # long time
    '...Exiting spawned PARI/GP interpreter process...'
```
matches only the former because of the somewhat convoluted quotation rules if the string contains quotes:

```
sage: repr("my 'foo' bar")   # output starts with single quote
'"my \'foo\' bar"'
sage: repr("my foo bar")     # output starts with double quote
"'my foo bar'"
```

For the record, the doctest failure looks like this:

How about

sage: print P.stdout.read()
