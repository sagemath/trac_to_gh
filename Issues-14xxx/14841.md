Frobby interface didn't work too well. For instance, it didn't parse correctly a sequence of several ideals, leading  to error messages like this:

```

sage: R.<x,y,z>=QQ[]
sage: I=R.ideal([x^2*y,z^2*y,x*z])
sage: frobby.irreducible_decomposition(I)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    125         frobby_output = self('irrdecom', input=frobby_input)

    153             gens = [v ** e for v, e in zip(ring.gens(), exps) if e != 0]
    154             return ring.ideal(gens or ring(1))
--> 155         return map(to_ideal, self._parse_4ti2_matrix(string)) or [ring.ideal()]
    156

    195 
    196         if term_count * var_count != len(ints):
--> 197             raise RuntimeError("Format error: incorrect matrix dimensions.")
    198 
    199         exponents = []

RuntimeError: Format error: incorrect matrix dimensions.
```

This patch solves this problem, implements calls to more frobby functions (note for instance the speed to compute the alexander dual, it beats the `SimplicialComplex alexander_dual` method by several orders of magnitude), and makes the doctets optional dependendent on frobby.

The added methods are: alexander_dual, hilbert, associated_primes, dimension, associated_primes.

Install the new [spkg](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/dima/packages/frobby-0.9.0.p1.spkg)

actually, not only on OSX. The proper fix is to include <unistd.h>

The patch itself looks good. Please test the new spkg, and then we can make it positive review.
