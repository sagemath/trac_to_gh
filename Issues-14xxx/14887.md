libgap is a gap fork that installs a library that exposes all gap internals. this can be implemented as a wrapper library, without forking much, without exposing and without an extra libgap package. This is planned with libgap-2.0.

The known workarounds don't work with OSX toolchains, so it doesn't make sense to merge them. For now, sagelib must be patched for packaging on systems without libgap.

The discussion so far has not lead to a solution for the issue, I didn't mean to bug you more about it until I have a clear concept... but here you are:

I have implemented a wrapper library that wraps all symbols that don't match lib[gG][aA][pP]_*. currently this is in proof of concept state and is intended to work without libgap package (everything compiles and links, but something's wrong).

I have not factored in that you might want to experiment with python/cython, but it should be easy to switch to another libgap.so to replace the the wrapper (of course somebody would have to maintain the fork...)

How is your planned c++-wrapper intended to implement experiments with gap internals?

That would be after libgap integration in Sage is complete, which would end up a fairly comprehensive api to the gap kernel. Then we wouldn't need to eperiment with the gap kernel regularly, so it would be fine to hide all the gap private symbols and only expose a C++ api that matches the class hierarchy in Sage. 

But first we need to wrap GAP permutations and then switch permutation groups from the gap interface to libgap.

there are no upstream changes involved. and it has nothing to do with debian, the implementation also works (well, almost...) on top of sage, no more no less.

for the experiments one could adapt your gapify script to generate modified headers and a more `complete` linker script.

Won't it be easier to implement the permutation thing only once, after the C++-wrapper exists?

Will the planned C++ wrapper be a part of sagelib or replace libgap or be another gap fork or something else (before it will be merged into gap-upstream)?

The problem isn't implementing it, the problem is figuring out how to interact with the GAP kernel correctly.

While we are on the topic of feature requests: GMP integers don't work with libgap currently, only GAP's older native integer implementation.

I am not so sure whether experiments without libgap are necessary, but we can talk about that later. also, I am not "changing" things, i'm implementing a way aroung libgap (which is not packageable), I am not going to break libgap use.

And the kernel is changing that fast?

fPIC is a compile flag, not an upstrem change. the signal handler and i/o can be compiled independently.

Maybe not, but if it does make development of libgap significantly more difficult then its not going into Sage anytime soon.

Is packageable and has been packaged before.

I have pushed a preview into my WIP branch on github. it uses a linker script to prefix the symbols and does not recompile anything. now, sagelib works with or without libgap on sage and on debian (but the gap debian package has not been uploaded yet).

currently, libgap_wrap.h is generated manually. it probably should just contain all typedefs, the definitions and the externs from the gap headers eventually. if you don't insist on keeping libgap, i can adapt the libggapify script to do that automatically.

> (libgap) Is packageable and has been packaged before.


yes, like the patched cliquer has been packaged.

into sagelib? I agree.

> Also, the GAP shared library should be usable as a stand-alone project. Having it used outside of Sage is probably the only chance to convince upstream to integrate patches for a shared library.


as long as it's not a stand alone project it should not be packaged as such, because that exposes the hacked/duplicate headers/library.

> Your github WIP branch doesn't have `libgap_wrap.h` or the linker script, so I haven't seen them yet.

because i forgot to add them. i intended to autogenerate them earlier (sorry)

isn't sage gcc only? are there any limitations to libtool that i should know about?

hopefully this isn't a real problem. gap/spkg-install also needs to compile the objects accordingly on cygwin...

Not really unfortunately.

The problem is that libtool will refuse to gather object files into a shared library if it does not find the corresponding .lo files he produces when it is used to compile the files.
A "fix" for that is to directly invoke the linker (ld, or ld through gcc/g++, on Cygwin), but of course you lose the benefits from using libtool.

In fact on Linux already you can see it ranting about that.
On Cygwin it will not only rant, but also abort.

We rely on GCC as the compiler, but the linker is not necessarily GNU ld. On OSX the Darwin linker is totally different. On Solaris one can in principle use both GNU ld and !Sun/Oracle ld but in practice Sage can only be built with Sun ld. I decided on renaming symbols before compilation because I didn't want to wade into that portability mess, though perhaps it could be sorted out. We'd need to be quite sure that it can be done on all supported and suppported-soon platforms, though.

A similar approach would be to use the objcopy utility from the GNU binutils to rename symbols in object files, but that is not portable to OSX either.

if objcopy doesn't work for OSX, there must be some alternative. all that is required is the --redefine-syms functionality. here, e.g. somebody claims that an ld will cut it:
