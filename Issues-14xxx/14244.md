Jacobi forms are a generalization of modular forms, with a two-variable Fourier expansion.  See Eichler-Zagier, The Theory of Jacobi Forms for more details.

This ticket adds a `JacobiForms` class to Sage and includes an efficient algorithm for computing a Jacobi form (a Jacobi theta series) from a quadratic form on a lattice and a vector in that lattice.
