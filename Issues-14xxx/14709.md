# Issue 14709: (Ab)using LIBRARY_PATH instead of using -L${SAGE_LOCAL}/lib doesn't necessarily work

In `sage-env`, we meanwhile add (more precisely, **ap**pend) `${SAGE_LOCAL}/include` to `CPATH`, and `${SAGE_LOCAL}/lib` to `LIBRARY_PATH`.

Besides that this is non-portable, or rather a GCC feature, it is **not** equivalent to adding / prepending `-I${SAGE_LOCAL}/include` to `CPPFLAGS`/`CFLAGS`/`CXXFLAGS` and `-L${SAGE_LOCAL}/lib` to `LDFLAGS`.

First of all, search paths / folders specified *on the command line* **precede** all others, and second, those specified through `CPATH`, `LIBRARY_PATH` etc. are not necessarily searched before system folders.

This currently leads to problems with e.g. readline and R (which doesn't support configuring with `--with-readline=<prefix>`, but just `=yes` or `=no`), where adding Sage's directories was dropped from `spkg-install`.

To test this, try for example

```sh
$ mkdir -pv /tmp/LOOK_HERE

$ env LIBRARY_PATH=/tmp/LOOK_HERE $CC -print-search-dirs | egrep '^libraries|LOOK_HERE'

# (and/or)

$ env LIBRARY_PATH=/tmp/LOOK_HERE $CC -v -x c /dev/null -o /dev/null 2>&1 | egrep '^LIBRARY_PATH|LOOK_HERE'

```
where `$CC` is the compiler / GCC of your choice (e.g. just `gcc`).

Isn't LIBRARY_PATH for runtime whereas LD_LIBRARY_PATH is for linking?
