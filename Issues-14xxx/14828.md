Factorization over the p-adics is currently broken (or at least not very useful.) This implements slope factorization and adds some structure for polynomial rings over discrete valuation rings.

Hello,

maybe it would be a good idea to close first the simpler ticket #6667 ?

I have made there a patch which is rather "local" but also careless about precision issues.

I see that here you are changing the behaviour of the general Newton polygon, which I would prefer to avoid. 

What would you think of trying to use for #6667 a mixture of my patch there and the part of your patch here dealing with that ?

It seems that the NewtonPolygon class is not doing what I would have expected. It gives

```
sage: NP = NewtonPolygon([ (0,0), (1,45), (3,6) ]); NP
Finite Newton polygon with 2 vertices: (0, 0), (3, 6)
```
So it is implicitely assuming that the polytope is rather a kind of "lower envelope". In my opinion, the doc needs to be enhanced, with more explanations and a link to the newton_polytope method below.

Compare to

```
sage: x,y=polygen(QQ,'x, y')
sage: p = 1 + x*y**45 + x**3*y**6
sage: p.newton_polytope()
A 2-dimensional polyhedron in ZZ^2 defined as the convex hull of 3 vertices
sage: p.newton_polytope().vertices()
(A vertex at (0, 0), A vertex at (1, 45), A vertex at (3, 6))
```
which is for me the expected behavior.

Anyway, I still think that this has rather to be solved in #6667.

The mercurial patch conflicted with 5.12-beta4.

I manually solved the conflicts. It seems it passes doctests, but I'll feel much more confident if Xavier reviews the new branch.

Replying to [@saraedum](#comment:39):
> I believe that if the authors can find a reviewer then it stay in one ticket.

True, but you might find it easier to find reviewers if you split it up.

That's certainly true, but I don't think it is splitting "just for the sake of it". Besides potentially easier reviewing, there is also less chances of conflicts or breakage with smaller tickets.
