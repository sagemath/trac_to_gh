As the title says !!

With the patch applied 

```
sage: g = graphs.PaleyGraph(primes_first_n(70)[-1])
sage: %time g.is_strongly_regular()
CPU times: user 0.16 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.16 s
Wall time: 0.16 s
True
```

Without it

```
sage: g = graphs.PaleyGraph(primes_first_n(70)[-1])
sage: %time g.is_strongly_regular()
CPU times: user 20.43 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 20.43 s
Wall time: 20.44 s
True
```

Ahhhh.. It is so nice to implement an algorithm with the right data structure ! `:-P`

I think it would make much sense to test the "is_triangle_free" thing with this data structure as well. It should be much more efficient using the same approach.

I don't know which kind of speedup we can expect, but that's definitely something  that should be implemented, if only to run that test `:-)`

Could we make this another ticket ? Then you can implement it or I will, it's up to you !

Hello,

I am a bit naive but would like to understand the following
* **pxi against C** why do you use a pxi file ? It would cause multiple compilation wherever it is included. I think a pure C file would be much more suited to that purpose (I know that this is the way it is for bitset)
* **mutability** why don't you mimic what is done for `DenseGraph` to allow mutability (ie having a bitset of active vertices that allow to use any subset of 0, ..., n-1 as vertices). Virtually there will be the good number of vertices but in backend you treat your graph with many isolated vertices. Augmenting the number of vertices may then be done with realloc.
* **sparse graphs** What do we do with current implementation of `SparseGraph` ?

Hellooooooo !

> I am a bit naive but would like to understand the following

If you compile the file independently then the functions cannot be inlined.

> * **mutability** why don't you mimic what is done for `DenseGraph` to allow mutability (ie having a bitset of active vertices that allow to use any subset of 0, ..., n-1 as vertices).

Because I want to write simple things. It is not meant to replace a real graph backend, and it will probably be used later on by the future dense backend, but I would really like to have a simple structure somewhere, that does nothing but store bits.

> * **sparse graphs** What do we do with current implementation of `SparseGraph` ?

Well, first I will have to read your patch #14690. Then, each time we read this file it would be nice to add comments to it, to explain the parts of it that we have understood. Then we can do whatever we want with this backend : rewrite it or improve it if we can. We can't really throw it out right now, can we ? `:-P`

The fact that it was not reviewed for so long makes me wonder if I am overlooking some non obvious caveat?\n\nAnyways, before giving another check let me ask\n\n1. Line 67 - can we always assume that g.vertices() will return a sorted list of vertices? Also, it looks like this can be written in a better way?\n\n2. Line 48 function inline binary_matrix_free. Shouldn't you free m.rows[1],...,m.rows[n_rows] as well?\n\n3.

Hello!

As promised I took the time to review your patch. The entire thing is easy to read and looks good. The fact that it was not reviewed for so long makes me wonder if I am overlooking some non obvious caveat?

Anyways, before giving another check let me ask

1. Line 67 - can we always assume that g.vertices() will return a sorted list of vertices? Also, it looks like this can be written in a better way?

2. Line 48 function inline binary_matrix_free. Shouldn't you free m.rows[1],...,m.rows[n_rows] as well?

3. Line 69 in inline binary_matrix_set0 the comment should really say set matrix entry to 0

Also off topic to this patch - am I the only one being tempted to change the function edges() and set edge_labels to false as default?

Yooooooo !

Thaaaaaaaaaaanks !! `;-)`

> The entire thing is easy to read and looks good. The fact that it was not reviewed for so long makes me wonder if I am overlooking some non obvious caveat?

The "someone else with do it" syndrome. And the fact that with git the developpers as a whole probably suffered a loss of enthusiasm `:-P`

> 1. Line 67 - can we always assume that g.vertices() will return a sorted list of vertices? Also, it looks like this can be written in a better way?

Unfortunately I think we can. Though I try not to rely on that. Did I do it in this patch ?

The problem is that while the vertices are indeed "sorted" before being returned, but that this sorting can be meaningless : the "natural" ordering on the vertices may be a partial ordering from time to time (i.e. when the vertices are set : `graphs.KneserGraph`) and well, that causes bugs from time to time.

> 2. Line 48 function inline binary_matrix_free. Shouldn't you free m.rows[1],...,m.rows[n_rows] as well?

No, because only `m.rows[0]` is allocated on line 39. All of `m.rows[i]` point toward some part of this very long vector, but regardless of that if you deallocate `m.rows[0]` the whole segment is deallocated.

> 3. Line 69 in inline binary_matrix_set0 the comment should really say set matrix entry to 0

Oh. Right `:-PPPPPPPPP`

> Also off topic to this patch - am I the only one being tempted to change the function edges() and set edge_labels to false as default?

`T_T`

I hate labels. And I also type `.edges(labels=False)` much more often than `.edges()`. Well. I didn't try to change this kind of stuff because I consider that it is just "my own use of graphs"... But well, if many of us begin to hate labels/loops/multiple edges now that's a different story `:-P`
The combinat/word guys may probably not agree, though... But really, I have no idea. I just never did that because I don't want to change stuff just because it makes it easier for me, without knowing how useful it can be for others.

For me they are veeeery annoying so I assumed they were for everyone .

Anyways, this is all I got to say about the patch. It looks good to me provided u changed the above things and ran the doctests (which I did not)

Indeed. Of course there is the stupid, thing of checking that the sum is n(n+1)/2 but I think that looks even more weird in this context?

`O_o`

Instead of that test, you mean ?

Well, we have no way to be sure that the vertices CAN be summed. I mean, this test is meant to check whether there is any need to store a label_to_int dictionary. If the vertices are 0...n-1 there is no need and so we do without. But if the vertices are... I don't know, anything ! Strings, Sets, partitions, tuples.. immutables graphs ? Well in that case we remember labels. And we cannot be sure that those can all be summed together.

Yes sure! That's what I said its stupid cause you also have to make sure every element is actually an int. 

As said this was more of a stupid comment than anything else, as far as I am concerned the patch is good to go!
