Ok, I'll try to add this though I never actually use a Mac.

It's still in the installing the notebook with ssl support part.
And in the prereq part i mention that Sage ships all the needed stuff (alhtough you need an internet connection, what the "to download separatly" should suggest, any better phrasing welcome, I'm no native english speaker so excuse my french).
Of course I could mention that you can run ./sage -i openssl in the prereq part, but the whole point of this section is to suggest to install system wide openssl (which on Linux/Solaris/Cygwin/FreeBSD should be quite default, at least for ssh users)

Correct!

Ok, I'll add that, makes sense with the usual current hardware.

Could you provide more info about the current situation?
The only online ressource I could find is https://developer.apple.com/xcode/.
I also registered for an Apple dev account, but apart from Java stuff and old versions of Xcode there is not much to download on the website.
I guess that only actual Mac owners can download Xcode from the "Mac App Store".
It seems to be free now though.
Is there still a separate "Command line tools" download?
On the Xcode page it is mentioned as an optional download for Xcode.

[Still haven't applied the patch... ;-) -- some random remarks:]

Not sure how much you intended to change on this ticket, but IMHO the overall structure is still suboptimal.

From what I've read, it e.g. sounds like building Sage's GCC was the "standard" way (or recommended), and the main advantage of building Sage from source was something like "full development capability", rather than (potentially much) better performance and compatibility (w.r.t. to available system libraries).  Also, it is suggested to build in a directory below `$HOME` (instead of some temporary directory on fast[er] media and moving the Sage directory afterwards).

The information a sysadmin needs certainly differs from that of a less experienced user; it doesn't seem the document currently reflects this.




Regarding `CC` and `CXX` (to some extent `CFLAGS` etc. as well), the warnings are rather confusing, and to my best knowledge obsolete.  (On the other hand, it is misleadingly emphasized that Sage would build with almost any C compiler [assuming Sage's GCC gets built and used, but that in contrast isn't that explicitly stated].)

It would IMHO be better to move the whole Sage Environment Variables section somewhere else (of course still mentioning the relevant ones here, and referring to their full description).




There's no mention of `ccache`... ;-)

NO!!!  Feel free to create a minimal version of this patch that just documents the Cygwin changes and then open a new ticket with Glanz und Gloria derer von Leonhardy or whatever ;-)  We want Cygwin out there for people to play with, and having this properly documented is part and parcel of it.

Of course most of the documentation could use extra work - it always can, and that's largely the nature of such open-source projects.  But let's not keep that from making smaller improvements when we can.

Yes, we can!  (Which doesn't exclude non-Cygwin-related smaller improvements; the ticket's title doesn't suggest it's limited to Cygwin stuff...)

AFAIK, Xcode 4 does not install command line tools by default. However, it appears to be possible to install command line tools only, and use them to build Sage, instead of the full-blown Xcode. 

https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action for me (I just have a free developer account) mentions Xcode 4.6.2, and two versions of command line tools, dated April 2013, one for OSX 10.7, another for OSX 10.8. I can't test these, as I only have OSX 10.6.

Ive slightly reworked the top introduction, and the first mention of C++ and Fortran compilers in the deps part.

I'm not completely sure of the current status, i.e. if all or even most spkg take CC, CPP, CFLAGS ets correctly into account, I know there have been imporvements lately but i don't want to go through the hassle of checking the spkgs now.
What I checked because I found it surprising is that CC, CPP and so one get overwritten if Safe has its own ones.
> emphasized that Sage would build with almost any C compiler [assuming Sage's GCC gets built and used, but that in contrast isn't that explicitly stated].)

>

In the "using alternative compilers" seciton, it's stated:

```
 Sage developers tend to use fairly recent versions of GCC, but Sage should
compile with any reasonable C compiler.
This is because Sage will build GCC first (if needed) and then use that newly
built GCC to compile Sage.
```
Isn't that explicit enough?

I've slightly modified the first time comilers are mentioned in the next patch version as well as this part.
> It would IMHO be better to move the whole Sage Environment Variables section somewhere else (of course still mentioning the relevant ones here, and referring to their full description).

Sure, but let's keep the fun for later.

Ive rethought about that for maybe wo seconds, but as it needs an internet connection I've chosen to be lazy and not to mention it already in the install procedure, so for now its still hidden in the env var part.

But that will change when we refactor everything :)

ARM is now mentioned as well, I've upped the free disk space to 4GB, that's about the space my 5.9.beta5 install takes.
I've not added anything about virtual memory as I have no clue with the new build system for the documentation, feel free to add it in a reviewer patch, or suggest it in the comments.

A few small comments:

* Make [http://wiki.sagemath.org/SupportedPlatforms](http://wiki.sagemath.org/SupportedPlatforms) more prominent in the "Supported platforms" sections. I would start that section by "See also [http://wiki.sagemath.org/SupportedPlatforms](http://wiki.sagemath.org/SupportedPlatforms) for more details".

* remove "or mismatching versions of the GCC compilers" (which is wrong)

* the paragraph starting with "If the build is successful, you will not see the word ERROR in the last 3-4 lines of output" should be improved because Sage now mentions the locations of the log files such that grepping `"^Error"` by hand is no longer needed.

* replace Sage 5.8 by Sage 5.10 at the end.
