This ticket changes SageNB from a distribution to a normal Python package. This means unbundling everything which used to be part of the SageNB distribution.

The package `webassets` is simply removed, since it doesn't seem to be used by anything in Sage or SageNB. [This thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/sage-devel/fEeGgVWuk7I/nDOHbclqLUAJ) indicates that `webassets` is used by the `newui` branch of SageNB but not in vanilla SageNB. So it has no reason being in Sage currently.

That shouldn't be a problem as long as we can verify that installation and use of sagenb is still smooth with this - indeed, it would simplify things rather substantially for upstream sagenb.

can you please answer this important question:

Replying to [comment:42 jdemeyer]:
> Is there actually a place where the "official" sagenb tarballs are hosted? If not, then we can just define my tarball as the official one.


My impression was that, whenever you made a new SageNB release, you just host it somewhere on a personal website. So then I don't see why my sagenb-0.12 on this ticket would be less official than your previous sagenb releases.

But please tell me if I'm wrong...

Yeah, as long as I don't have to create an extra merge commit (which is not possible on GH but should be possible command line, as you say) then that is fine.

In fact, without the weird packaging thing, the "official" tarball would indeed be the ones on Github now; the reason they aren't currently is because of the subpackage stuff, I believe.  I'm only concerned about the repos looking the same, not where some "official" package lives.

I'm sorry I can't do anything "officially" on GH now regarding this (I mean merging, because then I feel responsible and have to do testing etc.).  But this solution is fine with me, and I am one of the few people who cares about this, so no worries.

I presume one just has to look that it builds and runs. It's merely re-packaging of the same thing, right?

perhaps it's time for it to change; after all we tell users to install ssl support via pip, creating a lot of pain and confusion along the way, as we don't package the corresponding script thanks to exactly this prohibition.

Inconsistent access is a nightmare if you need to get a large file (e.g. current Sage source tarball), as opposed to several small files.

Besides, mind you, much more popular than Sage software distribution systems, e.g. ones for Python, Haskell, OCaml do require internet access, by default. Convenience for the majority (and for developers) ought to come before exotic usage cases.

Hence tarballs on thumb drives.

If/when we make sagenb into an optional or experimental package, I have no objections to doing the same with these dependencies. But until then, in what way is including a dozen packages an inconvenience? It doesn't take up any extra disk space or extra time building Sage since we're already including them, it just adds a few directories in `build/pkgs`. How is this more of an inconvenience than requiring internet access during compilation of Sage?

And how are Sage developers supposed to know about this, if they are going to be traveling and without good internet access for a while? It sounds like a good idea, but I still don't see what it saves vs. making these standard Sage packages (for as long as sagenb is a standard Sage package, but no longer).
