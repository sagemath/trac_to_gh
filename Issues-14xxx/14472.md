This was reported by Alejandro Argaez:

```
sage: K1.<w>=NumberField(x^2+x+1)             
sage: m=polygen(K1)
sage: K2.<v>=K1.extension(m^2-w+1)
sage: E=EllipticCurve([0*v,-432])
sage: E.global_minimal_model()
<boom>
```
The error is that the degree() function is called on the ring of integers of a relative number field.

In fixing this bug (which should be easy) it would be a good idea to add relative examples to as many functions as possible in `ell_numberfield.py`

Follow-up:  the old code for _reduce_model() was flawed, as follows:   to reduce a1,a2,a3 modulo 2,3,2 respectively, it attempted to reduce their coordinates as given by list(a1), etc.  Firstly this fails for relative extensions, but it is also misguided since there is no reason why the list() coordinates should be integral.  I have changed this to work with the coordinates with respect to an integral basis, which is good for relative extensions.  Only one small problem:  the doctest on line 860 which used to return (as a minimal model over Q(a) where a=sqrt(5))

```
(0, 1, 0, a - 33, -2*a + 64)
```
but now  gives

```
(0, -3/2*a - 1/2, 0, 3/2*a - 59/2, 27/2*a + 155/2)
```
which does not look so nice.  Note that the integral basis here is [1/2*a + 1/2, a] and that with respect to this basis 1 has coordinates (2,-1) while -3/2*a - 1/2 has coordinates (-1,-1) so (counterintuitively) 1 is not reduced mod 2 but -(3a+1)/2 is!

Note that the integral basis computed does depend on the polynomial used to generate the field:

```
sage: QuadraticField(5,'a').ring_of_integers().gens()                                                   
[1/2*a + 1/2, a]
sage: NumberField(x^2-x-1,'a').ring_of_integers().gens()                                                
[1, a]
```

All the examples seem to be *quadratic* number fields, is this intentional?

I don't know why Sage returns the basis of `ZK` like that, because it's not what PARI gives:

```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^2-5)
sage: K.integral_basis()
[1/2*a + 1/2, a]
sage: K._pari_integral_basis()
[1, 1/2*y - 1/2]
```

As for reducing an element modulo an ideal (which is what you do here), you could use PARI's `nfeltreduce()`.

No, probably just laziness.

Well spotted.  The integral_basis method calls maximal_order which does call _pari_integral_basis, but then applies some Order constructor to the generators (order.absolute_order_from_module_generators) which is where this non-canonical ( to my mind) basis comes from.  If that is to be chaned for quadratic fields then that would be a separate ticket, and would surely have a lot of doctest output consequences.

> As for reducing an element modulo an ideal (which is what you do here), you could use PARI's `nfeltreduce()`.

Sure, but here we are only reducing modulo (2) or (3) so it seemed easier to do it manually.

I made a new patch using PARI's `nfeltdiveuc`. This gives simpler code and has the advantage that 1 is reduced, so there is no need to change the field.
