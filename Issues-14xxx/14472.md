This was reported by Alejandro Argaez:

```
sage: K1.<w>=NumberField(x^2+x+1)             
sage: m=polygen(K1)
sage: K2.<v>=K1.extension(m^2-w+1)
sage: E=EllipticCurve([0*v,-432])
sage: E.global_minimal_model()
<boom>
```
The error is that the degree() function is called on the ring of integers of a relative number field.

In fixing this bug (which should be easy) it would be a good idea to add relative examples to as many functions as possible in `ell_numberfield.py`

```
(0, 1, 0, a - 33, -2*a + 64)
```
but now  gives

```
(0, -3/2*a - 1/2, 0, 3/2*a - 59/2, 27/2*a + 155/2)
```
which does not look so nice.  Note that the integral basis here is [1/2*a + 1/2, a] and that with respect to this basis 1 has coordinates (2,-1) while -3/2*a - 1/2 has coordinates (-1,-1) so (counterintuitively) 1 is not reduced mod 2 but -(3a+1)/2 is!

Note that the integral basis computed does depend on the polynomial used to generate the field:

```
sage: QuadraticField(5,'a').ring_of_integers().gens()                                                   
[1/2*a + 1/2, a]

[1, a]
```

All the examples seem to be *quadratic* number fields, is this intentional?

I don't know why Sage returns the basis of `ZK` like that, because it's not what PARI gives:

```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^2-5)
sage: K.integral_basis()
[1/2*a + 1/2, a]
sage: K._pari_integral_basis()
[1, 1/2*y - 1/2]
```

As for reducing an element modulo an ideal (which is what you do here), you could use PARI's `nfeltreduce()`.

Well spotted.  The integral_basis method calls maximal_order which does call _pari_integral_basis, but then applies some Order constructor to the generators (order.absolute_order_from_module_generators) which is where this non-canonical ( to my mind) basis comes from.  If that is to be chaned for quadratic fields then that would be a separate ticket, and would surely have a lot of doctest output consequences.

> As for reducing an element modulo an ideal (which is what you do here), you could use PARI's `nfeltreduce()`.

Sure, but here we are only reducing modulo (2) or (3) so it seemed easier to do it manually.

I made a new patch using PARI's `nfeltdiveuc`. This gives simpler code and has the advantage that 1 is reduced, so there is no need to change the field.
