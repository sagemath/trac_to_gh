As discusses in #13767, there is some doctests for the `random_set` function in polybori that have inherent random results. Because of that, they might break if the implementation of random functions changes, such as what happened in that ticket.

This is a rare occasion, but still it might be worthwhile to change these kind of doctests to only check for documented behavior. 

For example, the doctests could check that `result = random_set(monomial, n)` should obey `len(result) == n` and `result.diff(monomial.divisors()).empty()`. (suggested by Alexander Dreyer)

Or we could test against theorems (such as: One has random data, but the test is using an identity that must hold for any data). (suggested by Simon King)

Well, I understood from the discussion here, that the test should not depend on the random generator:
https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/sage-devel/uSEWZrE-T_8

Also, sage-on-gentoo and sage-on-debian may use different versions of boost than the original Sage.

An alternative could be that we **additionally** add (and document) the generic tests and keep the explicit ones. This would simplify the bug hunt next time.

Doctesting the random sequence (see `sage.misc.randstate`) and doctesting the correctness of the output are two different things. And ideally we'd have both, though its better to have randstate-dependent tests than none at all.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but the failing doctests were pretty much directly tests of the random number generator. If thats the case then I'd keep them since they test the rng seeding.
