Looks good, but the commit message should be more descriptive and you need to put the ticket number on a line of the test that checks that this bug was fixed, i.e. add a comment

`... # Trac #14508`

I failed to find a reference in the developer's guide, but I am pretty sure that was the consensus.

Helloooooo !

It looks good to me, but when you add

```
if base_ring.is_field():
    A = self.change_ring(base_ring) 
```
Then you make a copy of `A` even if ``base_ring`` is equal to ``A.base_ring()``, aren't you ? Is that necessary ?

So it shouldn't be a bad slowdown or something. And with my patch, it happens only if the user explicitly specifies the `base_ring` variable. So is this still an issue?",

BTW, the `change_ring` methods on all the matrix classes I've checked (dense integer matrices, dense rational matrices, dense generic matrices) start out (more or less -- sometimes, the ring is first checked for being a ring) by checking whether the ring to map into is already the base ring, and if so, do nothing or simply copy the matrix if it's mutable. So it shouldn't be a bad slowdown or something. And with my patch, it happens only if the user explicitly specifies the `base_ring` variable. So is this still an issue?
