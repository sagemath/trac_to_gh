<div id="comment:0"></div>

This fixes the following side effect in the affine method of relabelled cartan types::

```
sage: C = CartanType(["A",3]).relabel({1:2,2:3,3:1})
sage: C
['A', 3] relabelled by {1: 2, 2: 3, 3: 1}
sage: C.affine()
['A', 3, 1] relabelled by {0: 0, 1: 2, 2: 3, 3: 1}
sage: C
['A', 3] relabelled by {0: 0, 1: 2, 2: 3, 3: 1}
```
The patch also removes a couple trailing white spaces.

Depends on #4327
