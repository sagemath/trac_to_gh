This example was spotted by Dino Lorenzini:

```
sage: t = QQ['t'].0
sage: K.<g> = NumberField(t^4 - t^3-3*t^2 - t +1)
sage: x=-3/5*g^3 + 2/5*g^2 + 3/5*g + 4/5
sage: y=1/15*g^3 - 3/5*g^2 + 3/5*g + 17/15
sage: r = (x^2*y - x*y + y - 1) / (x^2*y - x)
sage: s = (x*y - y + 1) / (x*y)
sage: c = s*(r - 1)
sage: b = c*r
sage: E = EllipticCurve(K,[1-c,-b,-b,0,0])
sage: E.local_data()
```

which causes a `TypeError` in `_reduce_local`.
Tickets that may be linked to this are #11630 and #9410.

**Added later:** Moreover I can add another bug that he showed me

```
sage: R.<t> = QQ[]
sage: K.<g> = NumberField(t^4 - t^3 - 3*t^2 - t + 1)
sage: E = EllipticCurve([ -43/625*g^3 + 14/625*g^2 - 4/625*g + 706/625, -4862/78125*g^3 - 4074/78125*g^2 - 711/78125*g + 10304/78125,  -4862/78125*g^3 - 4074/78125*g^2 - 711/78125*g + 10304/78125, 0,0])
sage: E.global_integral_model()
```

ends in a `AssertionError: bug in global_integral_model`.

The reason is this:

```
sage: E.is_global_integral_model()
False
```
and if one replaces E by a global integral model then all is well:

```
sage: E1 = E.global_integral_model()

Of course it would be possible to have local_data() do this.  At the very least, local data should give a more polite message.

Not only that. The documentation says that non-integral model are allowed. And I firmly believe they should be. I am not in favour of making the model globally integral beforehand, again because it should stay a local algorithm.

Just so that I don't forget what I found out so far :

The issue, as silly as it sounds, comes up from `__repr__` this class. This does not display `_Emin` the minimal equation that Tate's algorithm found, instead it wants to compute `minimal_model`. This does nothing but calling `_reduced_model` in `ell_number_fields.py`. And that is global again. So in `_reduce_model` it checks if the coefficients are integers, while we only need that they are local integers here.

The quick solution I see is to add to the local class a function to reduce the model locally. But I will have to check what that is going to break.

<a id='comment:18'>Comment 18:</a>
Indeed, the uniformizer is not unique:

On 64-bit:

```
sage: K.<t> = NumberField(x^4 - x^3 - 3*x^2 - x + 1)
sage: [K.uniformizer(P) for P,e in factor(K.ideal(5))]
[t^2 - t + 1, t^3 - t^2 - 4*t - 1, -t^3 + 2*t^2 + 3*t - 1]
```

On 32-bit:

```
sage: K.<t> = NumberField(x^4 - x^3 - 3*x^2 - x + 1)
sage: [K.uniformizer(P) for P,e in factor(K.ideal(5))]
[t^2 - t + 1, t^2 - t - 1, -t^3 + 3*t + 2]
```
