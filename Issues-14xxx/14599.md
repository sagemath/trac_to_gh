In [this ask.sagemath question](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/943/in-sage-plot-fill-the-area-under-a-curve-between), the issue is raised whether

```
sage: f = x*(x-1)*(x-2)+1
sage: p = plot(f, 0.5, 1.5, fill=True) + plot(f, 0, 2)
```
should be doable in a single command, such as with a `fillxmin`/`fillxmax` keyword (or some better name).

Look at the following interesting behavior.

```
sage: plot([x^3,x^2,x], xmin=0, xmax=4, fill={0:[1], 1:1, 2:1-x}, fillxmin=1, fillxmax=2)
```
It's definitely obeying the `fillxmax` but not in the way one might expect.

Similarly, I'm not sure that

```
sage: plot((cos(x),sin(x)), xmin=0, xmax=2*pi, parametric=True, fill=True, fillxmin=0.5)
```
is behaving as expected.

And I'm completely flummoxed as to why

```
sage: plot((cos(x),sin(x)), xmin=0, xmax=2*pi, parametric=True, fill=True, fillxmin=1)
<boom>
KeyError: 'text/plain'
```
due to the new display hook stuff!

One possible workaround would be to disallow the custom fill (for now) in parametric plots (i.e. raise an error) and make that a new ticket.  I do think that the first 'bad' example should be dealt with, though.

the problem is probably that the plot object is invalid (it can't actually show a plot). Because there is insufficient validation this only causes issues later when you actually try to plot it.
