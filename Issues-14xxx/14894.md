Instead of catching whatever PARI writes to `pariErr`, we should use a callback function `cb_pari_err_handle`. That way, we don't need special tricks for warnings anymore.

Moreover, we also get access to the "error data" (a `t_ERROR` object) which we store in the exception.

The new macros do require more keystrokes -- or things like `replace-regexp` in Emacs, which I ought to list as a co-author of these patches. 8-)  On the other hand, they make the code easier to understand in the sense that one doesn't have to remember or guess where the error catching block ends.

In fact, I spent quite a bit of thought on the names, and altogether, I think that there are good reasons for the `sage_pari_` prefix:

My first idea was `pari_catch` / `pari_endcatch` / `pari_catch_reset`.  Then I decided that this set of names looks better with `catch_end` than with `endcatch`.

The variable `sage_pari_catcherr` in your patch for #14873 then gave me the idea of prefixing the names with `sage_`.  It is true that this makes them a bit long (which is why I did not change `sage_pari_catch` to `sage_pari_catch_begin`).

As I understand it, the two purposes of `sage_pari_catch()` are equally important, namely
- catching signals
- catching PARI errors.
It would be nice to have a name that mirror this.  Maybe the prefix `sage_` is somewhat redundant, as Volker Braun suggested, and we could call them `pari_catch_on()` and `pari_catch_off()`?

> What about `pari_sig_on()` and `pari_sig_off()` which would mirror `ecl_sig_on()` and `ecl_sig_off()` which we already have?

Maybe I can convince you by giving the definition of the decorator:

```
def pari_catch_function(f):
    """
    Decorator to wrap a function in sage_pari_catch() ... sage_pari_catch_end().
    """
    def g(*args):
        cdef object _x
        sage_pari_catch()
        _x = f(*args)
        sage_pari_catch_end()
        return _x
    return g
```
I put this in a Cython file and tested it.  It works, but probably it is not very good for efficiency.

Something that I do *not* see how to do easily, on the other hand, is a context guard (context manager) for use with the `with` statement, i.e.

```
with pari_catch:
    ...code...
```
giving you catching of PARI errors and signals within the block.

That might be true, but in this case I don't think it justifies the overcomplication of two-liners like

```
sig_on() 
return P.new_gen(gcos(x.g, pbw(precision))) 
```
to the five-liner

```
cdef gen result_gen 
sage_pari_catch() 
result_gen = P.new_gen(gcos(x.g, pbw(precision))) 
sage_pari_catch_end() 
return result_gen

I can't say I'm completely happy with the code increase, either, and by now I'm really inclined to try one of two opposite strategies:
- either find out how (in)efficient context managers (the `with` statement) are in Cython; I still think being able to say `with pari_catch: code` (as in comment:15) would be ideal, and perhaps the overhead is not so big compared to the overhead that we already have by using Cython;
- or translate this part of `gen.pyx` from Cython to C, both for speed and to be able to use a macro for signal and error handling.  This macro, say `pari_catch_wrap()`, should call `pari_catch_on()`, execute `code` (and remember its return value), call `pari_catch_off()` and return the return value of `code`, so one could type (in C)

```
return pari_catch_wrap(code);
```

> After looking at the PARI 2.6 sources, I think the best solution for Sage would be to use the (admittedly undocumented) variable `iferr_env` from PARI.

This is bad, for example for performance reasons (I made a lot of effort in making `sig_on()` fast).

There is a trade-off between execution time and developer time here.

What you suggest seems to require a new set of macros, merging `sig_on()/sig_off()` and PARI's error handling macros, that only do one `sigsetjmp()` but then have to distinguish within the error-handling code whether a signal or a PARI error occurred.

I would hope that `setjmp()` is very fast on most systems, so that it doesn't really hurt to use it twice: once to set up signal handling and once to set up PARI error handling.  I would certainly be happy to pay this price in order to cleanly separate between handling signals and handling PARI errors.

Of course this would be ideal. But as I said, this needs Cython patches. I recently looked into this for implementing `sig_on()` and it currently cannot be done in Cython.

> What you suggest seems to require a new set of macros, merging sig_on()/sig_off() and PARI's error handling macros, that only do one sigsetjmp() but then have to distinguish within the error-handling code whether a signal or a PARI error occurred. 
Exactly. I know it's far from trivial, otherwise I would have done it already in the past. But I can say that I **thought** a lot about signal/error handling.

> I would hope that setjmp() is very fast on most systems

It's not. I remember it being particularly slow on BSD (and therefore OS X) systems.

I just found a discussion about this on the pari-dev mailing list: [http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/archives/pari-dev-0909/msg00007.html](http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/archives/pari-dev-0909/msg00007.html).

The reason is that in BSD, `setjmp()` saves the signal mask (which apparently is very expensive), while in System V-like systems it does not.  BSD does have `_setjmp()` and `sigsetjmp(, 0)`, which are comparable to `setjmp()` on other systems.  According to the link above, the `setjmp()` variant that does not touch the signal mask is 2.5 to 12 times as fast as the one that does.

Of course, for signal handling you are stuck with the slow version, but for other purposes one could use the fast version.  In our situation the question is whether we do one slow system call, or the slow one for signal handling plus the fast one for handling PARI errors.

Finally, the discussion cited above mentions the idea of letting the user of the PARI library specify a function to call when an error occurs instead of the `setjmp()/longjmp()` construction.  This doesn't currently seem to be implemented, though.

There is the callback function `cb_pari_handle_exception`, but I don't quite see how to use this without any `longjmp()`; see comment:34.  Hence two questions:
- Would a new callback function really be needed (e.g. because it has to be called at a different moment than `cb_pari_handle_exception`)?

The problem with that callback is that it is called after printing the error message. For Sage, we don't want the error to be printed.

My approach would still use a `longjmp()` to jump to the `setjmp()` inside `sig_on()`. It would avoid an additional `setjmp()` call for PARI.

Couldn't we prevent printing the error message by using a custom `pariErr` like we already do for `pariOut`?  Besides not having to patch PARI to add another callback, this has the additional advantage that the error text can be stored for possible inspection.
