Instead of catching whatever PARI writes to `pariErr`, we should use a callback function `cb_pari_err_handle`. That way, we don't need special tricks for warnings anymore.

Moreover, we also get access to the "error data" (a `t_ERROR` object) which we store in the exception.

-Pari GIT has made significant changes to the error handling code, which will require us to make some changes to Sage. See also https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/14873#comment:9 for a list of issues with the current approach.
+Pari GIT has made significant changes to the error handling code, which will require us to make some changes to Sage.
 
+This ticket reimplements PARI error handling inside Cython code using macros provided by 'pari/paricom.h' instead of undocumented functions that no longer exist in PARI 2.6.  The new syntax is
+
+```
+sage_pari_catch()
+... code ...
+sage_pari_catch_end()
+```
+Inside such a block one can put conditions like
+
+```
+if [some condition]:
+    sage_pari_catch_reset()
+    [return or raise exception]
+```
+
+The new functions catch PARI errors and also call `sig_on()` and `sig_off()` to enable interrupt handling.  This replaces the current hack of overriding `sig_on()` and `sig_off()`.
+
+Since `sage_pari_catch()` and `sage_pari_catch_end()` are C macros, they `_must_` be on the same level in Cython code.  This means that several functions in `sage/libs/pari/gen.pyx`, most importantly `new_gen()`, no longer automatically call `sig_off()`.  Instead of
+
+```
+sig_on()
+return new_gen(something returning GEN)
+```
+one therefore has to write
+
+```
+cdef gen result
+sage_pari_catch()
+result = new_gen(something returning GEN)
+sage_pari_catch_end()
+return result
+```
+
+This new approach fixes several (potential) problems with the existing one; see https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/14873#comment:9.
+
+When upgrading to PARI 2.6, the only remaining change to be made (hopefully) is to replace the macros `CATCH`, `ENDCATCH`, `RETRY` and `CATCH_RELEASE` by `pari_CATCH`, `pari_ENDCATCH`, `pari_RETRY` and `pari_CATCH_reset`.

The new macros do require more keystrokes -- or things like `replace-regexp` in Emacs, which I ought to list as a co-author of these patches. 8-)  On the other hand, they make the code easier to understand in the sense that one doesn't have to remember or guess where the error catching block ends.

Maybe just `catch_begin` / `catch_end` / `catch_reset` since its usage should be pretty much only in `sage/libs/pari`.

In fact, I spent quite a bit of thought on the names, and altogether, I think that there are good reasons for the `sage_pari_` prefix:

My first idea was `pari_catch` / `pari_endcatch` / `pari_catch_reset`.  Then I decided that this set of names looks better with `catch_end` than with `endcatch`.

As I understand it, the two purposes of `sage_pari_catch()` are equally important, namely
- catching signals
- catching PARI errors.
It would be nice to have a name that mirror this.  Maybe the prefix `sage_` is somewhat redundant, as Volker Braun suggested, and we could call them `pari_catch_on()` and `pari_catch_off()`?

Maybe I can convince you by giving the definition of the decorator:

```
def pari_catch_function(f):
    """
    Decorator to wrap a function in sage_pari_catch() ... sage_pari_catch_end().
    """
    def g(*args):
        cdef object _x
        sage_pari_catch()
        _x = f(*args)
        sage_pari_catch_end()
        return _x
    return g
```
I put this in a Cython file and tested it.  It works, but probably it is not very good for efficiency.

Something that I do *not* see how to do easily, on the other hand, is a context guard (context manager) for use with the `with` statement, i.e.

```
with pari_catch:
    ...code...
```
giving you catching of PARI errors and signals within the block.

That might be true, but in this case I don't think it justifies the overcomplication of two-liners like

```
sig_on() 
return P.new_gen(gcos(x.g, pbw(precision))) 
```
to the five-liner

```

sage_pari_catch_end()

But why?  When I started looking at `gen.pyx`, the names `sig_on()` and `sig_off()` really confused me, because they suggest that they are just signal handling macros.  It seems to me that in practice, PARI errors (e.g. zero division) occur more often than signals, so the names should not suggest otherwise.  If you ask me, this problem is not fixed by renaming them `pari_sig_on()` and `pari_sig_off()`.

I can't say I'm completely happy with the code increase, either, and by now I'm really inclined to try one of two opposite strategies:
- either find out how (in)efficient context managers (the `with` statement) are in Cython; I still think being able to say `with pari_catch: code` (as in [comment:15](#comment:15)) would be ideal, and perhaps the overhead is not so big compared to the overhead that we already have by using Cython;
- or translate this part of `gen.pyx` from Cython to C, both for speed and to be able to use a macro for signal and error handling.  This macro, say `pari_catch_wrap()`, should call `pari_catch_on()`, execute `code` (and remember its return value), call `pari_catch_off()` and return the return value of `code`, so one could type (in C)

```
return pari_catch_wrap(code);
```

There is a trade-off between execution time and developer time here.

What you suggest seems to require a new set of macros, merging `sig_on()/sig_off()` and PARI's error handling macros, that only do one `sigsetjmp()` but then have to distinguish within the error-handling code whether a signal or a PARI error occurred.

I would hope that `setjmp()` is very fast on most systems, so that it doesn't really hurt to use it twice: once to set up signal handling and once to set up PARI error handling.  I would certainly be happy to pay this price in order to cleanly separate between handling signals and handling PARI errors.

Of course this would be ideal. But as I said, this needs Cython patches. I recently looked into this for implementing `sig_on()` and it currently cannot be done in Cython.

Exactly. I know it's far from trivial, otherwise I would have done it already in the past. But I can say that I **thought** a lot about signal/error handling.

It's not. I remember it being particularly slow on BSD (and therefore OS X) systems.

I just found a discussion about this on the pari-dev mailing list: [http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/archives/pari-dev-0909/msg00007.html](http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/archives/pari-dev-0909/msg00007.html).

The reason is that in BSD, `setjmp()` saves the signal mask (which apparently is very expensive), while in System V-like systems it does not.  BSD does have `_setjmp()` and `sigsetjmp(, 0)`, which are comparable to `setjmp()` on other systems.  According to the link above, the `setjmp()` variant that does not touch the signal mask is 2.5 to 12 times as fast as the one that does.

Of course, for signal handling you are stuck with the slow version, but for other purposes one could use the fast version.  In our situation the question is whether we do one slow system call, or the slow one for signal handling plus the fast one for handling PARI errors.

Finally, the discussion cited above mentions the idea of letting the user of the PARI library specify a function to call when an error occurs instead of the `setjmp()/longjmp()` construction.  This doesn't currently seem to be implemented, though.

Actually, in `[PARI source]/language/init.c` (and in the header file `paricom.h`) there is a declaration

```
int  (*cb_pari_handle_exception)(long);
```
if this is non-zero, `pari_err()` calls it (with an error code as argument) when no saved environment is present to do a `longjmp()` to.  I could imagine setting this to a Cython function that converts a PARI error into an appropriate Python exception, and raising that exception.

It appears that the function to which `cb_pari_handle_exception` points should return non-zero if and only if the error was handled succesfully; if it was, `pari_err()` simply returns.

The current implementation has its problems (see the ticket description), but I know of nothing that is broken in practice.  Whether to do it now or during the upgrade depends on which solution is chosen.

There is the callback function `cb_pari_handle_exception`, but I don't quite see how to use this without any `longjmp()`; see [comment:34](#comment:34).  Hence two questions:
- Would a new callback function really be needed (e.g. because it has to be called at a different moment than `cb_pari_handle_exception`)?
- Does the option 3 that you have in mind somehow avoid `longjmp()`, or do you propose to do the `longjmp()` inside a common error-handling function for signals and PARI errors?

The problem with that callback is that it is called after printing the error message. For Sage, we don't want the error to be printed.

My approach would still use a `longjmp()` to jump to the `setjmp()` inside `sig_on()`. It would avoid an additional `setjmp()` call for PARI.

-Pari GIT has made significant changes to the error handling code, which will require us to make some changes to Sage.
-
-This ticket reimplements PARI error handling inside Cython code using macros provided by `pari/paricom.h` instead of undocumented functions that no longer exist in PARI 2.6.  The new syntax is
-
-```
-sage_pari_catch()
-... code ...
-sage_pari_catch_end()
-```
-Inside such a block one can put conditions like
-
-```
-if [some condition]:
-    sage_pari_catch_reset()
-    [return or raise exception]
-```
-
-The new functions catch PARI errors and also call `sig_on()` and `sig_off()` to enable interrupt handling.  This replaces the current hack of overriding `sig_on()` and `sig_off()`.
-
-Since `sage_pari_catch()` and `sage_pari_catch_end()` are C macros containing complementary braces, they *must* be on the same level in Cython code.  This means that several functions in `sage/libs/pari/gen.pyx`, most importantly `new_gen()`, no longer call `sig_off()` or its replacement `sage_pari_catch_end()`.  Instead of
-
-```
-sig_on()
-return new_gen(something returning GEN)
-```
-one therefore has to write
-
-```
-cdef gen result
-sage_pari_catch()
-result = new_gen(something returning GEN)
-sage_pari_catch_end()
-return result
-```
-
-This new approach fixes several (potential) problems with the existing one; see https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/14873#comment:9.
-
-When upgrading to PARI 2.6, the only remaining change to be made (hopefully) is to replace the macros `CATCH`, `ENDCATCH`, `RETRY` and `CATCH_RELEASE` by `pari_CATCH`, `pari_ENDCATCH`, `pari_RETRY` and `pari_CATCH_reset`.
-
-Apply: [attachment: trac_14894-pari_catch-folded.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket14894/trac_14894-pari_catch-folded.patch.gz)
+Instead of catching whatever PARI writes to `pariErr`, we should use a callback function `cb_pari_prehandle_exception`. That way, we don't need special tricks for warnings anymore.
