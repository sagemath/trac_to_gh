Sage interprets the Maxima factorial operator as the inequality symbol in some cases:

```
sage: factorial(x) == 6                                                   
factorial(x) == 6
sage: _.simplify()
x != 6
```

I set the priority to critical because this can produce wrong answers. For example,

```
bool((factorial(x) == 6).simplify().subs(x=2))
```
