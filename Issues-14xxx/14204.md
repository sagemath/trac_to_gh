Even with #14156, rebuilding the documentation when nothing needs to be done (`make doc` right after `make doc`) still takes a very long time.

In sage-5.7:

```
real    0m48.142s
user    0m37.120s
sys     0m10.110s
```

In sage-5.8.beta2:

```

sys     1m5.140s

Should this really be a blocker?

That's a personal opinion of course.

In my opinion, the answer is absolutely "Yes". If you regularly run `make ptestlong`, this really is a massive regression. I think the problem mentioned in this ticket is much worse than the problem solved in #6495.

OK, with 4 processes on `sage.math`, the documentation takes 188s and the doctesting (without `--long`) takes 1065s, with #12415. So, it's certainly noticable.

It's not that those extra minutes matter that much, but those lost minutes matter much more to me than the minutes saved by #6495.

If I put a call to `cProfile` in the docbuild command in `spkg/bin/sage` when building `reference/homology`, it doesn't tell me much:

```

I tried to do that, but I think Sphinx has a memory leak (this has been suggested before). For whatever reason, after a little while it uses a lot of memory and slows way down. Actually, the inventory build sped up (from almost 2 minutes before down to about half a minute on an OS X machine with 2 cores), but the html build does not.

In more detail, I tried importing sage.all once, and then using a Python function call to build each document: I basically stuck all of custom-sphinx-builder.py into builder.py, and replaced the `subprocess.call(...)` with 

```
        from sphinx.cmdline import main
        main(args)
```
This way sage.all would be imported just once, not 75 times. But there are issues. Maybe we should call `main(args)` some other way, so the memory is guaranteed to be released afterward? Any suggestions?

> Why did we care so much about speeding up the initial build of the documentation (#6495) at the expense of rebuilds of the documentation?

When I was thinking about #6495, I was imagining the following situations, among others:

- the initial `make`
- some people still clone the Sage repo, which usually triggers a full rebuild of the docs
- edit some files (say in `combinat`) and run `sage --docbuild reference/combinat html`
- building the pdf docs

For all of these, #6495 helps considerably. When I think about running `make ptestlong` (which I do more frequently than `make ptest`), I didn't think a little added time was much of an issue.

All the more reason to set `MAKE` so it uses multiple threads! On my (not reasonably modern) OS X machine, rebuilding the documentation after modifying one file, with `MAKE` unset, takes

```
real	2m44.637s
user	2m7.278s
sys	0m22.776s
```
With `MAKE` set to use two cores:

```
real	1m55.552s
user	2m12.224s
sys	0m24.907s
```
On sage.math, with `MAKE='make -j12'`:

```
real	0m34.899s
user	1m34.650s
sys	0m16.800s
```
So using multiple cores is very advantageous. Note also that if you are only modifying a single file, or files within one section of the reference manual, be aware that you can do

```
sage --docbuild reference/homology html
```
(or `reference/combinat` or `reference/matrices` or ...). This will be very fast (except when rebuilding the `combinat` docs ;), even with a single core.

On my reasonably modern Gentoo laptop, this takes about 40 seconds (with 1 thread), which I personally find reasonable.

> I do think it is a pretty nasty (non-mathematical) regression.

I don't think it's such a big regression. With 1 thread, it is slightly slower than before, but not by much.

I see, so this isn't something we can fix more without getting rid of parallel documentation building.  I think this was a lot faster before because it only had to do a sweep through one directory.

With Sage 5.2, after touching one file and `sage -b`, the documentation build takes well under 15 seconds, but in 5.9 the same thing took about 80 seconds (I had to use a watch for this, since it didn't print it out).

Maybe we could add something about *both* of John's solutions to [the Sage manuals developer page](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/sage_manuals.html#building-the-manuals)?  I'd be open to opening such a ticket.  Maybe my student could even write the patch ;-)
