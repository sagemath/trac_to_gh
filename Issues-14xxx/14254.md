With the new doctesting framework (#12415), I sometimes see errors like

```

These appear randomly non-reproducibly in doctests.

There is a comment

```
# A note about how to store "id" keys in python structures:
#
# In python a "pointer length integer" (size_t) normally, is encoded
# as a *signed* integer, of type Py_ssize_t. This has an advantage in that
# if the value gets encoded as a *python integer* it can do so in a sign-preserving
# way and still make use of all the bits that python offers to store (small) integers.
#
# There is one place where we have to be careful about signs:
# Our hash values most naturally live in Py_ssize_t. We convert those into
# an index into our bucket list by taking the hash modulo the number of buckets.
# However, the modulo operator in C preserves the sign of the number we take the
# modulus of, which is not what we want.
# The solution is to always do
# (<size_t) h)% modulus
# to ensure we're doing an unsigned modulus.
```

Could it be that this is relevant here?

Is it really safe to do

```
        cdef Py_ssize_t k1,k2,k3
        cdef int offset
        k1,k2,k3,offset = r.key
        cdef Py_ssize_t h = (k1 + 13*k2 ^ 503*k3)
        PyList_GET_ITEM(buckets, (<size_t>h) % PyList_GET_SIZE(buckets))
```
?

Yes, we need to care about the sign. But we also have

```
 Py_ssize_t PyList_GET_SIZE(object list)
 PyObject* PyList_GET_ITEM(object list, Py_ssize_t i)
```
(hence, the modulus is Py_ssize_t, and the result will be translated into Py_ssize_t, too)

I am afraid I have no 32 bit machine to test.

<div id="comment:10" align="right">comment:10</div>

How many bytes is Py_ssize_t using? On 32-bit machines, is Py_ssize_t perhaps using more bytes than size_t? Then, the problem could be here:

```
        cdef Py_ssize_t h1 = <Py_ssize_t><void *>k1
        cdef Py_ssize_t h2 = <Py_ssize_t><void *>k2
        cdef Py_ssize_t h3 = <Py_ssize_t><void *>k3
        cdef Py_ssize_t h = (h1 + 13*h2 ^ 503*h3)
```
While h1, h2, and h3 should be fine (they are obtained from a pointer and are thus using 32 bit), I could imagine that Python tries to be clever and uses more byte (long versus int) for h, if 13*h2 or 503*h3 happen to be larger than the greatest number representable by 32 bit.

If this is the case, then the line

```
cdef list bucket = <object>PyList_GET_ITEM(all_buckets, (<size_t>h) % PyList_GET_SIZE(all_buckets))
```
(when the "long" Py_ssize_t h is converted down to 32 bit of size_t) could overflow, isn't it?

Caveat: I am not an expert for the subtleties of Py_ssize_t on 32 versus 64 bit...

I found the following on [PEP 353](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0353/):

```
Conceptually, Py_intptr_t and Py_ssize_t are different things: Py_intptr_t needs
to be the same size as void*, and Py_ssize_t the same size as size_t. These could
differ, e.g. on machines where pointers have segment and offset. On current
flat-address space machines, there is no difference, so for all practical purposes,
Py_intptr_t would have worked as well.
```
Note that we actually *do* want a conversion from and to <void*>. So, shouldn't we actually use Py_intptr_t, not Py_ssize_t?

Does Py_intptr_t even exist in Sage? I did a grep for it, to no avail.

Well, you didn't tell yet were exactly the error is located.

Lacking more information, my guess was that an overflow could occur on systems where `sizeof(Py_ssize_t)==sizeof(size_t)` differs from `sizeof(Py_intptr_t)==sizeof(void*)`. So, why are you sure that the problem is *not* related with conversion between size_t and pointers?

        cdef size_t h2 = <size_t><void *>k2
        cdef size_t h3 = <size_t><void *>k3

```

Hence, the three items of the key originally were size_t. But they are assigned to Py_ssize_t.

Indeed.

And `r.key` does indeed take values like `k1,k2,k3 = (3043219468L, 154417500, 150140108)`, the first of which would not fit in a `Py_ssize_t`.

So the question is: where does this tuple come from?

In sage/categories/homset.py:

```
    _cache[key] = KeyedRef(H, _cache.eraser, (id(X),id(Y),id(category)))
```

`id()` returns `<type 'int'>`. I don't know if assigning `int` to `Py_ssize_t` can be a problem.

There are (as much as I know) only the two places that I mentioned (by the way, #14159 would change it).

Is `size_t-->Py_ssize_t` a potential problem? Or is `id(...)-->Py_ssize_t` a potential problem?

I don't think so.

In any case, the machine in question managed to build the documentation without errors, so that's a good sign. I'm running tests now, but it's a slow machine so I'll report back tomorrow.

Regardless, I think you can review the patch without access to a 32-bit system and assume that I have done my duty in testing the patch.
