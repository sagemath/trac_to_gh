There is a comment

```
# A note about how to store "id" keys in python structures:
#
# In python a "pointer length integer" (size_t) normally, is encoded
# as a *signed* integer, of type Py_ssize_t. This has an advantage in that
# if the value gets encoded as a *python integer* it can do so in a sign-preserving
# way and still make use of all the bits that python offers to store (small) integers.
#
# There is one place where we have to be careful about signs:
# Our hash values most naturally live in Py_ssize_t. We convert those into
# an index into our bucket list by taking the hash modulo the number of buckets.
# However, the modulo operator in C preserves the sign of the number we take the
# modulus of, which is not what we want.
# The solution is to always do
# (<size_t) h)% modulus
# to ensure we're doing an unsigned modulus.
```

Could it be that this is relevant here?

Is it really safe to do

```
        cdef Py_ssize_t k1,k2,k3
        cdef int offset
        k1,k2,k3,offset = r.key
        cdef Py_ssize_t h = (k1 + 13*k2 ^ 503*k3)
        PyList_GET_ITEM(buckets, (<size_t>h) % PyList_GET_SIZE(buckets))
```
?

Yes, we need to care about the sign. But we also have

```
 Py_ssize_t PyList_GET_SIZE(object list)
 PyObject* PyList_GET_ITEM(object list, Py_ssize_t i)
```
(hence, the modulus is Py_ssize_t, and the result will be translated into Py_ssize_t, too)

I am afraid I have no 32 bit machine to test.

<a id='comment:10'></a>
How many bytes is Py_ssize_t using? On 32-bit machines, is Py_ssize_t perhaps using more bytes than size_t? Then, the problem could be here:

```
        cdef Py_ssize_t h1 = <Py_ssize_t><void *>k1
        cdef Py_ssize_t h2 = <Py_ssize_t><void *>k2
        cdef Py_ssize_t h3 = <Py_ssize_t><void *>k3
        cdef Py_ssize_t h = (h1 + 13*h2 ^ 503*h3)
```
While h1, h2, and h3 should be fine (they are obtained from a pointer and are thus using 32 bit), I could imagine that Python tries to be clever and uses more byte (long versus int) for h, if 13*h2 or 503*h3 happen to be larger than the greatest number representable by 32 bit.

If this is the case, then the line

```
cdef list bucket = <object>PyList_GET_ITEM(all_buckets, (<size_t>h) % PyList_GET_SIZE(all_buckets))
```
(when the "long" Py_ssize_t h is converted down to 32 bit of size_t) could overflow, isn't it?

Caveat: I am not an expert for the subtleties of Py_ssize_t on 32 versus 64 bit...

```
Conceptually, Py_intptr_t and Py_ssize_t are different things: Py_intptr_t needs
to be the same size as void*, and Py_ssize_t the same size as size_t. These could
differ, e.g. on machines where pointers have segment and offset. On current
flat-address space machines, there is no difference, so for all practical purposes,
Py_intptr_t would have worked as well.
```
Note that we actually *do* want a conversion from and to <void*>. So, shouldn't we actually use Py_intptr_t, not Py_ssize_t?

Well, you didn't tell yet were exactly the error is located.

Lacking more information, my guess was that an overflow could occur on systems where `sizeof(Py_ssize_t)==sizeof(size_t)` differs from `sizeof(Py_intptr_t)==sizeof(void*)`. So, why are you sure that the problem is *not* related with conversion between size_t and pointers?

        cdef size_t h2 = <size_t><void *>k2
        cdef size_t h3 = <size_t><void *>k3

```

Hence, the three items of the key originally were size_t. But they are assigned to Py_ssize_t.

Indeed.

And `r.key` does indeed take values like `k1,k2,k3 = (3043219468L, 154417500, 150140108)`, the first of which would not fit in a `Py_ssize_t`.

There are (as much as I know) only the two places that I mentioned (by the way, #14159 would change it).

Is `size_t-->Py_ssize_t` a potential problem? Or is `id(...)-->Py_ssize_t` a potential problem?

No, I wouldn't mind (rebasing #14159 should be easy enough).

But how can one change the id() thingy in sage/categories/homset.py? After all, it is a Python file, hence, one can not just do `<size_t><void*>X`.

The patch looks fine to me, and it applies cleanly after #13387. Now I wonder what the patchbots have to tell.

Problem: I have no 32-bit machine available. Will the machines on which you first noticed the problem report here, in the hopefully green) blob?

I don't think so.

In any case, the machine in question managed to build the documentation without errors, so that's a good sign. I'm running tests now, but it's a slow machine so I'll report back tomorrow.

Regardless, I think you can review the patch without access to a 32-bit system and assume that I have done my duty in testing the patch.

Good work guys! That line made me feel uncomfortable when I was reviewing it, because it was reaching into implementation details of `_cache.eraser` and indeed, it *wasn't* properly doing that, in a way I did not spot. This is even more confirmation that #14159 is the right solution and not just over-engineering.
