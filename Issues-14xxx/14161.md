Add a method that tests the antipode of a Hopf algebra. We know that the antipode satisfies certain conditions, so check these conditions for the antipode method using the elements output by `some_elements`.

```
Test the antipode. 

An *antipode* `S` of a Hopf algebra is a linear endomorphism of the 
Hopf algebra that satisfies the following conditions (see 
:wikipedia:`HopfAlgebra`). 

- If `\mu` and `\Delta` denote the product and coproduct of the 
  Hopf algebra, respectively, then `S` satisfies 

  .. MATH:: 

      \mu \circ (S \tensor 1) \circ \Delta = unit \circ counit 
      \mu \circ (1 \tensor S) \circ \Delta = unit \circ counit 

- `S` is an *anti*-homomorphism 

These properties are tested on :meth:`some_elements`. 

TESTS:: 

    sage: R = NonCommutativeSymmetricFunctions(QQ).ribbon() 
    sage: R._test_antipode() 

:: 

    sage: s = SymmetricFunctions(QQ).schur() 
    sage: s._test_antipode() 
```
This would have caught the bug in #14160.

<a id='comment:18'></a>Replying to [comment:15 chrisjamesberg]:
> I vote to keep as a Hopf algebra! If you call something a Hopf algebra, do you have to implement the antipode? Isn't "Not implemented" acceptable? It's still a Hopf algebra even if it doesn't know how to compute the antipode.


I'd like to keep it as a Hopf algebra, too. Especially since we know how to compute the antipode (see Mike's comment). Can you implement it?

> I think the description of this ticket could be a little more informative than just a few doctests. Without reading the code, I'm not exactly sure what this ticket is about.


I thought it was pretty self-explanatory based on the understanding that the purpose of all the `_test_*` methods is to make sure that something isn't obviously wrong with the code by running a few tests. Such a test would/should have caught the bug we found with the antipode of NSym because it failed the defining condition for an antipode.
