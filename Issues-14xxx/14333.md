Sage should probably upgrade to this version; it won't be painless though, since my experiments show that what in the changelog is lightly documented as "interface to iiMake_proc changed" (in the "Internal changes" section) -- impacts sage.
The API for `iiMake_proc` changed from

```
sleftv * iiMake_proc(idhdl pn, package pack, sleftv* sl);
```
to

```
BOOLEAN iiMake_proc(idhdl pn, package pack, sleftv* sl);
```

---

Probably also take care of #12442.

Use git branch.

<a id='comment:16'></a>I uploaded a patch to take care of the API change.

New (preliminary) spkg adds two commits from singular git ([1](https://github.com/Singular/Sources/commit/ddb348e97a991972e5dfee690a66663ba0418f40) and [2](https://github.com/Singular/Sources/commit/561842a06ad4b44f3b85b28ac35e7946eaba9a30)) to add compatibility with NTL 6 (#14867) and some template instantiation errors from gcc 4.7. I didn't check if the NTL stuff works.

Changing our libSingular interface to be compatible with version 4.0 is a major effort. We should backport the fix or find out the corresponding patch in the Singular master branch and add it to the spkg.

Ok thanks for the details.
i may be dumb but once more I did not find anything on the singular website (or at least the first thing that Google pointed at) about 4-0-0.
Note that there is indeed something here:
* http://www.mathematik.uni-kl.de/ftp/pub/Math/Singular/SOURCES/
Is there another hidden channel where annoucements are made?
> As I wrote before, it would be a major effort to port the libsingular interface to 4-0-0. I don't have time to do that in the near future.

Ok, so let's go for the 3-1-x upgrade.
I'll port the latest spkg to the new layout.

<a id='comment:29'></a>I'm ok with Burcin changes: it's mostly patches cleanup, integration of a few backported patches and modification for the new API as documented in the ticket description.
I also removed the description of old patches which was still there.

If someone could check I did not screw up the new layout transition I guess it can go in.
(Note that the version should be 3-1-6 but the new scripts don't support it when extraction version number, so as was done for 3-1-5, I put 3.1.6 everywhere.)
