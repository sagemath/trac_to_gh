Sage should probably upgrade to this version; it won't be painless though, since my experiments show that what in the changelog is lightly documented as "interface to iiMake_proc changed" (in the "Internal changes" section) -- impacts sage.
The API for `iiMake_proc` changed from

```
sleftv * iiMake_proc(idhdl pn, package pack, sleftv* sl);
```
to

```
BOOLEAN iiMake_proc(idhdl pn, package pack, sleftv* sl);
```

---

Probably also take care of #12442.

Use git branch.

Pardon?

(I haven't submitted *a patch* upstream, but only a [bug report](http://www.singular.uni-kl.de:8002/trac/ticket/479).  The patch from #14295 is of course against 3-1-5, our current version, not 3-1-6.)

Changing our libSingular interface to be compatible with version 4.0 is a major effort. We should backport the fix or find out the corresponding patch in the Singular master branch and add it to the spkg.

Unless 3-1-7 gets really released in the next few days?
Ok there are bugs in Singular but they were already here and should be dealt with other tickets.
Stucking with the current version we have prevent other packages to be updated (at least NTL).

I am switching to `needs_review`. Singular 4-0-0 was released on Friday. I don't know if they plan to make bug-fix releases on the 3-1 series any more.

As I wrote before, it would be a major effort to port the libsingular interface to 4-0-0. I don't have time to do that in the near future.

Ok thanks for the details.
i may be dumb but once more I did not find anything on the singular website (or at least the first thing that Google pointed at) about 4-0-0.
Note that there is indeed something here:
* http://www.mathematik.uni-kl.de/ftp/pub/Math/Singular/SOURCES/
Is there another hidden channel where annoucements are made?

Ok, so let's go for the 3-1-x upgrade.
I'll port the latest spkg to the new layout.

I'm ok with Burcin changes: it's mostly patches cleanup, integration of a few backported patches and modification for the new API as documented in the ticket description.
I also removed the description of old patches which was still there.

If someone could check I did not screw up the new layout transition I guess it can go in.
(Note that the version should be 3-1-6 but the new scripts don't support it when extraction version number, so as was done for 3-1-5, I put 3.1.6 everywhere.)
