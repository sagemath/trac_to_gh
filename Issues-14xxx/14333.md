Sage should probably upgrade to this version; it won't be painless though, since my experiments show that what in the changelog is lightly documented as "interface to iiMake_proc changed" (in the "Internal changes" section) -- impacts sage.
The API for `iiMake_proc` changed from

```
sleftv * iiMake_proc(idhdl pn, package pack, sleftv* sl);
```
to

```
BOOLEAN iiMake_proc(idhdl pn, package pack, sleftv* sl);
```

---

Probably also take care of #12442.

Use git branch.

Pardon?

(I haven't submitted *a patch* upstream, but only a [bug report](http://www.singular.uni-kl.de:8002/trac/ticket/479).  The patch from #14295 is of course against 3-1-5, our current version, not 3-1-6.)

 Sage should probably upgrade to this version; it won't be painless though, since my experiments show that what in the changelog is lightly documented as "interface to iiMake_proc changed" (in the "Internal changes" section) -- impacts sage.
-
-To be more precise, in sage/libs/singular/function.pyx, there is the following code:
+The API for `iiMake_proc` changed from
 
 ```
-    cdef leftv* handle_call(self, Converter argument_list, ring *_ring=NULL):
-        if _ring != currRing: rChangeCurrRing(_ring)
-        return iiMake_proc(self.proc_idhdl, NULL, argument_list.args)
+sleftv * iiMake_proc(idhdl pn, package pack, sleftv* sl);
 ```
-
-but the new api for iiMake_proc is:
+to
 
 ```
 BOOLEAN iiMake_proc(idhdl pn, package pack, sleftv* sl);

I am switching to `needs_review`. Singular 4-0-0 was released on Friday. I don't know if they plan to make bug-fix releases on the 3-1 series any more.

As I wrote before, it would be a major effort to port the libsingular interface to 4-0-0. I don't have time to do that in the near future.

Ok thanks for the details.
i may be dumb but once more I did not find anything on the singular website (or at least the first thing that Google pointed at) about 4-0-0.
Note that there is indeed something here:
* http://www.mathematik.uni-kl.de/ftp/pub/Math/Singular/SOURCES/
Is there another hidden channel where annoucements are made?
> As I wrote before, it would be a major effort to port the libsingular interface to 4-0-0. I don't have time to do that in the near future.

Ok, so let's go for the 3-1-x upgrade.
I'll port the latest spkg to the new layout.

I'm ok with Burcin changes: it's mostly patches cleanup, integration of a few backported patches and modification for the new API as documented in the ticket description.
I also removed the description of old patches which was still there.

If someone could check I did not screw up the new layout transition I guess it can go in.
(Note that the version should be 3-1-6 but the new scripts don't support it when extraction version number, so as was done for 3-1-5, I put 3.1.6 everywhere.)
