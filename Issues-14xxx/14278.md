I have seen doctests that try to demonstrate how to clear a cache of class instances. See sage/modular/abvar/abvar_ambient_jacobian.py, for example.

This made me think: It would be nice to be able to define a class method for `CachedRepresentation` that clears the cache from all instances of this class.

With my patch, the following works:

```
            sage: class A(UniqueRepresentation):
            ...    def __init__(self, x):
            ...        pass
            sage: class B(A):
            ...    @staticmethod
            ...    def __classcall__(cls, *args, **kwds):
            ...        return super(B,cls).__classcall__(cls,*args,**kwds)
            sage: class C(B): pass
            sage: a = A(1)
            sage: b = B(2)
            sage: c = C(3)
            sage: a is A(1)
            True
            sage: b is B(2)
            True
            sage: c is C(3)
            True
            sage: B._clear_cache_()
            sage: a is A(1)
            True
            sage: b is B(2)
            False
            sage: c is C(3)
            False
```
Note that B overloads `__classcall__`, but nevertheless the `_clear_cache_` methods finds the cache and removes all instances of B and its subclass C.

Sorry, I have no idea what component to choose. Let it be misc, then...

The failure reported be one of the patchbots was a maxima crash. I suppose that's unrelated. In any case, I kicked the bot, so, we will see of the maxima crash is reproducible.

Hey Simon,

Could you also add tests with a `__classcall_private__()`? Thanks.
