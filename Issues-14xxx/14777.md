G=Graph()
H=Graph()

G.is_isomorphic(H) returns False

It should return True.

The same problem occurs in the Digraph case.

Hey Austin,

There are two minor things I see:

- Line 16803 should be:

  ```
  Ensure that :trac:`14777` is is fixed::
  ```
  in order for the autolinking to work.

- Line 16812 should be:

  ```
  if self.num_verts() == 0 and other.num_verts() == 0:
  ```
  there was a second `=` missing from the second part.

Once these are fixed, this should be a positive review.
