I brought this up in #8392 but was told to post it as a new ticket.

```
sage: Permutation([])  # This is be the identity permutation in S_0.
[]
sage: Permutation([]).cycle_string()    # OK.
'()'
sage: Permutation('()')    # This should give the S_0 identity back -- but it doesn't.
[1]
sage: Permutation('')     # Does this maybe? No.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)

----> 1 Permutation('')

/home/darij/sage-5.10.beta2/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/combinat/permutation.pyc in Permutation(l, check_input)
    430         cycle_list = []
    431         for c in cycles:
--> 432             cycle_list.append(map(int, c.split(",")))
    433 
    434         return from_cycles(max([max(c) for c in cycle_list]), cycle_list)

ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: ''
sage: Permutation(())       # What about this?
[1]

```

A corner case it is, but I think it should be done right...

This is now fixed in the attached patch.

Helloooooooooooooooooooo !!

Make sense ! Though shouldn't `if len(flattened_and_sorted) == 0:` in `from_cycles` return the identity on `n` elements instead ? If the user asked for `n` elements, after all...
