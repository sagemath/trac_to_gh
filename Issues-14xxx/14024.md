Another problem happens with upgrading.  On `rosemary` (RHEL 5.6 x86_64), the scripts in `local/bin` aren't properly installed.  In particular `local/bin/ipython` isn't copied and the pre-upgrade `local/bin/ipython` doesn't work.  Full log: [http://build.sagemath.org/sage/builders/UGA%20rosemary%20%28RHEL%205.6%20x86_64%29%20up%26nbsp%3B4.5.2/builds/53/steps/shell_7/logs/ipython](http://build.sagemath.org/sage/builders/UGA%20rosemary%20%28RHEL%205.6%20x86_64%29%20up%26nbsp%3B4.5.2/builds/53/steps/shell_7/logs/ipython)

But note this part:

```
running install_scripts
copying build/scripts-2.7/iplogger -> /home/buildbot/build/sage/rosemary-1/rosemary_upgrade_4.5.2/build/sage-5.7.beta1/local/bin
```
which normally looks like

```
running install_scripts
copying build/scripts-2.7/ipengine -> /release/buildbot/sage/sage-1/sage_upgrade_4.8/build/sage-5.7.beta1/local/bin
copying build/scripts-2.7/ipcontroller -> /release/buildbot/sage/sage-1/sage_upgrade_4.8/build/sage-5.7.beta1/local/bin
copying build/scripts-2.7/ipcluster -> /release/buildbot/sage/sage-1/sage_upgrade_4.8/build/sage-5.7.beta1/local/bin
copying build/scripts-2.7/iplogger -> /release/buildbot/sage/sage-1/sage_upgrade_4.8/build/sage-5.7.beta1/local/bin
copying build/scripts-2.7/ipython -> /release/buildbot/sage/sage-1/sage_upgrade_4.8/build/sage-5.7.beta1/local/bin
copying build/scripts-2.7/pycolor -> /release/buildbot/sage/sage-1/sage_upgrade_4.8/build/sage-5.7.beta1/local/bin
copying build/scripts-2.7/irunner -> /release/buildbot/sage/sage-1/sage_upgrade_4.8/build/sage-5.7.beta1/local/bin
copying build/scripts-2.7/iptest -> /release/buildbot/sage/sage-1/sage_upgrade_4.8/build/sage-5.7.beta1/local/bin
```

EDIT: I initially though this was because of #14026 but thinking further, it was probably #14027.

The "you are on branch X" message was implementing a third bannering system besides sage-banner and IPython banner, and I removed all of it. We can think about putting it back in after we switch to git.

Ideally Sage itself should function even if all version control data is stripped from the installation. After we switch to git this might actually become feasible. "You are on branch X" is a nice thing to have, but it should fail gracefully. I like this patch though because the "branches" referred to by this message are not even used by anyone except the patchbot anymore.

Just testing that the patchbot succeeds in testing sage-0 on arando before I give this positive review.
