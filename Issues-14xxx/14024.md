Ideally Sage itself should function even if all version control data is stripped from the installation. After we switch to git this might actually become feasible. "You are on branch X" is a nice thing to have, but it should fail gracefully. I like this patch though because the "branches" referred to by this message are not even used by anyone except the patchbot anymore.

Just testing that the patchbot succeeds in testing sage-0 on arando before I give this positive review.
