You should use `isa_ext=('None',)` if you want to explictly disable it, see `ATLAS_ISAEXT`.

And the real question: does it improve the build time on ancient i386 chips without SSE? The only real improvement would be if the pure x87 archdef would be used and is actually faster to compile than the full tuning.

Volker, you obviously understand this stuff better than me, so if you want to make a reviewer patch, go ahead.

My main concern is that `configure_base()` should produce a generic binary, meaning it runs on all processors of a given architecture.

(although note that the oldest i386-architecture processor that we test Sage on is a Pentium 4, which has SSE and SSE2)

I suggest to use:

* x86 plus SSE2 for 64 bits.
Note ATLAS provide archdefs for the former and Volker added archdefs for the latter.

In spkg-install, the "archdef_dir = PATCH_DIR" line for the base target on x86 64 bits should be removed.
I've moved the tarballs into a ARCH subdir and reenabled copying of archdefs tarballs into ATLAS proper dir, so it should find them without tweaking archdef_dir.
Or you could disable the copying and set archdef_dir...

By the way, for the fast target we could also refactor the archdef_dir setting and isa_ext, potentially setting isa_ext = ('None',) by default as for the base target.

Question for Volker, how to tell for sure that archdefs are used? apart from a shorter building time?

Apart from this, should we wait for the patchbots reports before putting this to positive_review?
Or the other way around?

Great that you provided a proper spkg-src script.
I'll try to review the spkg tomorrow.

And about 3DNow (I saw you did not put it in back), we don't want to put it in base or fast anyway because it's AMD only, so if you happen to build a dist tarball of Sage, typically by setting the FAT option, on a computer with 3DNow, it will get in and later segfault if you run it on an Intel computer.

It does not tackle the problem that 3DNow is AMD only...
I could imagine someone wanting to distribute a sage bdist with a "fast" but still somehow portable ATLAS.
You can still argue that in that case he can very well remove 3DNow himself if he wants ot play with fire...

I just don't like to add non-universal extensions to predifined targets although I completely agree that if we consider that someone who builds with fast should only expect it to work on the machine where it was built then trying 3DNow makes sense.

Anyway, does using 3DNow in addition of SSE or SSE2 gives any speedup?
I guess not, so let's forget about 3DNow for "fast" because we have SSE2 and for "base" because we don't want people to end up distributing AMD only binaries (though it's highly unlikely, I agree)...

Is this really because of the VM (or the OS?) being 32 bits?
It seems strange.
Or did you also get mixed symbols?

Anyway, I agree the base target should disable threading.
For the fast one, if we go for "the "fast" target should only run on the machine where it is built" interpretation, then it's kind of bad. But if threading is indeed broken on all 32 bits OSes, then we don't have a choice.
If we want to consider that the "fast" build is also "generic" and could be redistributed, then disabling threading is completely ok, till we decide that recent enough computers have more than one core :)

I could even build shared libraries by replacing libtool calls to gcc calls for linking.

I built base, fast, and the default (no `SAGE_ATLAS_ARCH`) on a variety of machines and `make ptestlong` succeeds in all cases. Wall time to build ATLAS:

The new patches introduce a typo:

```
raise ValuError
```

I guess you could also get rid of "autom4te.cache" in spkg-src.

Maybe document the new options threads and static.

Otherwise everything looks fine, I'm testing it right now.
