The following crashes Sage hard:

```
sage: i = CDF.0
sage: fz=animate([line([zeta(s+i*t) for t in srange(0,50,0.01)]) for s in srange(0,0.9,0.01)],xmin=-1.5,ymin=-2,xmax=2.5,ymax=2)
  ***   the PARI stack overflows !
  current stack size: 16000000 (15.259 Mbytes)
  [hint] you can increase GP stack with allocatemem()

  ***   Error in the PARI system. End of program.
```

The problem is simple: instead of using the **proper PARI interface** in `sage/libs/pari/gen.pyx`, for some reason PARI is called directly in `sage/rings/complex_double.pyx`. This interface misses some features, such as cleaning up the PARI stack :-)

This code goes back to

```

summary:     Finished the 2nd draft of the double precision complex numbers.
```

Solution: use the proper PARI interface instead.

Depends on #13618
