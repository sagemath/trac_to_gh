Sage is numerically approximating this integral, even though it's divergent:

```
sage: integrate(x^3/sqrt(x^7+1), x, 1, oo).n()              
-2.0585298599983344
```

It seems that if we don't allow Maxima to detect its divergence (`numerical_integral` passes it directly to GSL), GSL will also fail on simpler divergent integrals:

```
sage: numerical_integral(1/x, 1, oo)
(65.94931131932763, 8.156214940519742)
sage: numerical_integral(x,1,oo)                    
(-0.4999999993521234, 1.3615531480049015e-09)
```

See also [this ask question](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/30620/sage-says-that-a-divergent-integral-converges/):

```
sage: numerical_integral(e^(-x)/x,0,oo)
(37.191280375549404, 6.239196965189217)

<a id='comment:2'></a>Regarding the first one; basically, when we return a noun form

```
sage: integrate(x^3/sqrt(x^7+1), x, 1, oo)
integrate(x^3/sqrt(x^7 + 1), x, 1, +Infinity)
```
and call `n` we do

```
sage: A._convert(RR)
-2.0585298599985333
```
because we do

```
sage: sage.symbolic.integration.integral.DefiniteIntegral._evalf_??

        from sage.gsl.integration import numerical_integral
        # The gsl routine returns a tuple, which also contains the error.
        # We only return the result.
        return numerical_integral(f, a, b)[0]
```
So these are both manifestations of the same thing.

So... is it user error to numerically integrate a divergent integral?  I certainly don't know that we should be checking every numerical integral for divergence, particularly since Maxima apparently can't (yet) do the first one in any case!
