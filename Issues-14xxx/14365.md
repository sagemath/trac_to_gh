    Check that ``sage-location`` did its job in making Python scripts

Furthermore, for Sage-on-foo, there might not even be a `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/ipython` [script], so I think the whole test should be changed.

Just take another script from `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/` which is unlikely to use some system-wide version / differ in "repackaged" Sage releases?

Why at all did the test fail for you?

Sage contains :
1. test for features
2. test for very specific tests (on places of files, on very specific version of various things)

The first are important. The others wouldn't be a problem if they were all in the same file, which distributions could then not package and not suffer through. But they're scattered everywhere!

I'd like to dig the problem with the value from "ret" in 2 tests. The sqlalchemy tests really duplicate testing in another part of sage I am sure.

I have two like this in cmdline.py and another one in control.py.

And I have a few other places where sage expects an error and doesn't... like a place where it deliberately asks something about a polytope in dimension 7 to a palp program which is supposed to work in dimension at most 6... as debian's (future) palp package goes up to eleven [because sage goes as far], the test fails because the computation actually works.

But let's get back to this ticket : what do you propose it should test? I don't think there is such a thing as "another script from $SAGE_LOCAL/bin/ which is unlikely to use some system-wide version / differ in "repackaged" Sage releases" as Leif put it...

In reality there is also a lot of
3. tests combining a type 1 and a type 2 test

The test that this ticket is about is such a test. If it was only type 2 we could just remove it. But it's really meant as a test of type 1, namely that `sage-location` works.

Well that's interesting, I will drop the test in question shortly from sage-on-gentoo. We now have

```/usr/bin/python-exec-c\n
```
which comes from the new way to handle multiple simultaneous python install at the time in Gentoo. Like I said, it won't be missed if it just test that sage-relocation did its work. We don't do that in sage-on-gentoo anyway. And I am sure you don't want to do that either in a debian package that install sage as part of the system.

I am absolutely ready to review this as invalid. As long as sage upstream support something like "sage-relocation" it will make sense to test it. And it won't ever for a project like sage-on-foo.

If you have a sure to work, in both world, alternative to the test I would be ok with it. In the meantime I am not really willing to spend much time on it.
