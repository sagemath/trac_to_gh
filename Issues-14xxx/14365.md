In cmdline.py, one of the doctest checks the exact shebang of ipython ; the attached patch checks there is a shebang trying to run python, but doesn't check exactly how python is run.

    Check that ``sage-location`` did its job in making Python scripts
    relative.  We test it on the ``ipython`` script::

```

Furthermore, for Sage-on-foo, there might not even be a `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/ipython` [script], so I think the whole test should be changed.

Just take another script from `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/` which is unlikely to use some system-wide version / differ in "repackaged" Sage releases?

Why at all did the test fail for you?

Sage contains :
1. test for features
2. test for very specific tests (on places of files, on very specific version of various things)

The first are important. The others wouldn't be a problem if they were all in the same file, which distributions could then not package and not suffer through. But they're scattered everywhere!

I'd like to dig the problem with the value from "ret" in 2 tests. The sqlalchemy tests really duplicate testing in another part of sage I am sure. My solution for that will be to eventually remove it surgically since the only sage spkg handling functionality that it is working and intend to keep is to produce spkg.

I have two like this in cmdline.py and another one in control.py.

And I have a few other places where sage expects an error and doesn't... like a place where it deliberately asks something about a polytope in dimension 7 to a palp program which is supposed to work in dimension at most 6... as debian's (future) palp package goes up to eleven [because sage goes as far], the test fails because the computation actually works.

But let's get back to this ticket : what do you propose it should test? I don't think there is such a thing as "another script from $SAGE_LOCAL/bin/ which is unlikely to use some system-wide version / differ in "repackaged" Sage releases" as Leif put it...

That's because upstream Python very stupidly refuses to add a patch fixing [an important security issue](http://bugs.python.org/issue16202).

In reality there is also a lot of
3. tests combining a type 1 and a type 2 test

The test that this ticket is about is such a test. If it was only type 2 we could just remove it. But it's really meant as a test of type 1, namely that `sage-location` works.
