terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::runtime_error'
  what():  Number_T::hash() python function (__hash__) raised exception
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGABRT: An abort() occurred in Sage.
This probably occurred because a *compiled* component of Sage has a bug
in it and is not properly wrapped with sig_on(), sig_off().
Sage will now terminate.

<div id="comment:8" align="right">Comment 8</div>

Minimal case given. In Sage `hash(matrix())` will not allow hashing probably because `PyObject_Hash` will fail and to prevent that. The fail happens in Pynac nevertheless because the check is avoided due to function expansion and there leads to the crash.

One part of the fix is preventing Sage from crashing. Surrounding the call to Pynac in `Expression::__nonzero__` with guards:

```
            sig_on()
            pynac_result = relational_to_bool(self._gobj)
            sig_off()
```
leads to:

```
sage: bool(f(x)==f(x))
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::runtime_error'
  what():  Number_T::hash() python function (__hash__) raised exception
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError: mutable matrices are unhashable
```
which is the same you get with `hash(matrix())`, so quite sensible. What more? Why are matrices generated by `vector*vector` (the original case) or those in a function definition (like above) mutable at all?

Are you sure this is the sole problem, though? If we try this:

```
def imm_mt(*args,**kwargs):
    M=matrix(*args,**kwargs)
    M.set_immutable()
    return M
f(x)=imm_mt()
```
then we get

```
sage: hash(f(x))
0
```
but `bool(f(x)==f(x))` still crashes. is it trying to see if `f(x)*f(x)^(-1)` is one?

I have reopened the Pynac issue. The crash is in exactly the same call tree. It happens while trying to multiply the rhs with `-1` to get `lhs-rhs`. So:

```
sage: f(x)=matrix()
sage: bool(f(x)==1)
True
sage: bool(1==f(x))
<crash>
```
Also no, I don't think it's the sole problem. Either Sage or Pynac will have to check somewhere before evaluating that all mutable Python objects of the expression are switched to immutable (or make immutable copies).

EDIT: But that would be a different ticket: #18360

My best guess at the moment is that somewhere in between a copy is made which, as you suggested, is then mutable again. This can only be fixed by a dedicated ticket such as #18360. 

As to this code, the reviewer should check doubly if what I did here was right. There was not a single example in Sage with a special function catching exceptions from which I could have learned.
