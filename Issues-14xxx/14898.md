Implements:
- the Poincaré-Birkhoff-Witt basis of the free algebra and several related functions
- the dual basis of the previous one in the shuffle algebra.

Also puts `FreeAlgebra` in the category of `AlgebrasWithBases`.

What exactly is the Poincaré-Birkhoff-Witt basis of a free algebra? Free algebras have exponential growth, and PBW bases have polynomial growth, so I don't see how a free algebra can have a PBW basis.

I may very well be missing something, but I think you need to explain what this term means in this context, and probably provide a reference.

The name I gave is probably confusing. Indeed, the basis is in fact the Poincaré-Birkhoff-Witt basis of the free Lie algebra whose enveloping algebra is the free algebra.
Is it clearer?

<a id='comment:7'></a>Right now I'm working on an initial version of Lie algebra's on #14901 (of which, I have a good amount of work done on the combinat queue and can post the [incomplete] patch on trac if desired), and it sounds like we should make sure to say in sync to not duplicate code and to have these play together.

Currently #14901 depends on #10963, so I think we're better of finishing the part on the free algebra first and making #14901 depend on this ticket.

A few things from glancing over the patches:

- Make sure all methods you add have docstrings and doctests.
- Could you fold all of the patches into a single patch? This makes it easier to review.
- Set it to "needs_review" when you're ready for someone to do the review. (which I volunteer)
- Did you work on this during Sage Days 49? If so, could you add "days49" to the keywords.

Hope everything is going well.

Thanks,

Travis

Could you fold all of the patches into a single patch? This makes it easier to review.

<a id='comment:9'></a>Hey Matthieu,

Sorry for falling behind on this.

So to fold a patch, start at "base.patch", then run 

```
sage -hg qfold second.patch third.patch ...
```
(also for the record, if you want to rename your patch, you can run `sage -hg qrename renamed.patch`).

Once that is done and the new version is uploaded, I'll continue the review. One other thing, if you keep the same name, please check the "replace previous file" box in the uploads.

Thanks,

Travis

They should be in `$SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/.hg/patches`, however you will want to run those commands in the source folders, i.e. in a subfolder of `$SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/sage/`.

> Should I download the different patches attached to this ticket, fold them and upload the result? 


You can if you've removed them from your queue (or installed a new version of Sage); just make sure to run `sage -hg qimport first.patch ...` in the source folders.

> Since I did not change anything since the last time I uploaded something, when I try to produce a new patch, there is nothing in the diff...


Because nothing has changed, there is no need for a new patch, which just records the differences.

> Sorry for these questions but I am a not-so-quick newbie! 


Not a problem. Hope this helps.

<a id='comment:13'></a>It seems like you are in the right folder, but just to make sure could you tell me what folder were you in?

Also the patch you want to fold everything into should be the top patch.

EXAMPLE: You have the patches `first.patch`, `second.patch`, `third.patch` in that order in your queue and you want to fold `second.patch` and `third.patch` into `first.patch`. You will run: `sage -hg qfold second.patch third.patch` when `sage -hg qtop` returns `first.patch`. If it does not, you will have to run `sage -hg qpop` to "pop off", i.e. unapply, those patches until you're at `first.patch`.

Hope that makes sense and helps.

<a id='comment:20'></a>From your series file, `trac_13898_r.patch` is the *last* patch that is applied, i.e. all the previous patches are also applied and why you are gettign the error message. Just to make sure we are on the same page, you should get the following

```
$ sage -hg qapplied
trac_14898_Lyndon.patch
trac_14898_PBW.patch
trac_14914_stuffle.patch
status
trac_14898.patch
trac_14898_r.patch
```
where `$ blah` means you run command `blah` from the terminal in the `$SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/sage` folder.

So what you should do is the following (the `#` and anything after is a comment):

```
$ sage -hg qpop trac_14898_Lyndon.patch    # This is the first patch applied
$ sage -hg qfold trac_14898_PBW.patch trac_14898.patch trac_14898_r.patch     # Fold all subsequent patches in (in order)
$ sage -hg qrename trac_14898-folded-md.patch   # Give the new patch a different name
$ sage -hg qrefresh -e     # Make sure there is a good commit message
```

Hope that helps,

<a id='comment:30'></a>It seems like the patches got out of order...post the `trac_14898_r.patch` and I'll fold the results together along with some of my review changes.

After I post the folded patch, you'll want to run

```
$ sage -hg qpop -a         # this pops off all patches
$ sage -hg qunapplied
$ sage -hg qremove [all patches outputted from above related to #14898]
$ sage -hg qimport [my folded patch that you'll download]
```

Also, when you copy output text, it's best to put it in triple squiggly brackets: ``` and ```. This gives it the nice formatting like what I have in this comment and you don't have to put in the `
`.

Best,

Travis

<a id='comment:36'></a>Hey Matthieu,

Here's the folded patch which:

- Makes your functions into methods of the correct classes.
- Implements coercion between the bases.
- Moves `FreeAlgebra` into the category of `AlgebrasWithBases`.
- Makes every function have a doctest.

This is the patch which applies for me on sage 5.11 and 5.12.beta3. You'll probably want to delete using `sage -hg qremove` all of the patches related to this ticket and then `sage -hg qimport /path/to/this/file` and `sage -hg qpush`.

Let me know if you're happy with my changes.

Best,

Travis

<a id='comment:42'></a>Does this patch require the patches of Sage Combinat to be installed?

When I (successfully) apply the patch, I get an error when I rebuild the library:  

File "/home/matthieu/sage-5.11/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/combinat/permutation.py", line 211, in <module>

    from sage.combinat.composition import Composition

ImportError: cannot import name Composition

<a id='comment:43'></a>As for why the files in `sage-main` were modified, did you run the `sage -hg qimport` in the `sage-main` folder?

Hmmm....strange. I'm guessing my import statements are causing a circular dependency without #14772? (I did some reworking of the import statements and I recall they were very fickle.) Try moving the added import statements into the functions where we actually call the imported object(s).

If that doesn't work, perhaps it is worthwhile (IMO, it is even if the above does work) to install sage-combinat by doing the following:

```
$ sage -b main
$ cd /to/sage-main
$ sage -hg qpop -a     # Because cloning will take the current changes to any patches that are applied
$ sage -combinat install    # This will take a few minutes
$ cd /to/sage-combinat
$ sage -hg qpop trac_14898-pbw_folded-ts.patch   # It's in the combinat queue already
```

Best,

Travis

PS - Sorry for the delay
