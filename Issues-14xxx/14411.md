<a id='comment:2'></a>A few things I would like to see:

- Reference the ticket number in the commit message
- Use double quotes instead of single quotes for consistency
- Since dictionaries are non-deterministic in their ordering, could you change the last test to something like

```
sage: L = [s for s in d]
sage: len(L)
3
```
Also you probably could just return `self.root_to_elements_dict().itervalues()` since it is an iterator object (it avoids a level of indirection).

Thanks,

Travis

<a id='comment:3'></a>I made a new version. It's ok with that?

Furthermore, I added a new method ``_getitem_`` which return the set associated to the argument:

```
sage: d =  DisjointSet(range(4))
sage: d.union(1,2); d
{{0}, {1,2}, {3}}
sage: d[2]

```

(My opinion is when we write ``d.find(2)`` we expect ``[1,2]`` and not ``1`` (that means nothing for user) but I don't want reimplement all so... what is your opinion about that?)
