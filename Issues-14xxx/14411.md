A few things I would like to see:

- Reference the ticket number in the commit message
- Use double quotes instead of single quotes for consistency
- Since dictionaries are non-deterministic in their ordering, could you change the last test to something like

```
sage: L = [s for s in d]
sage: len(L)
3
```
Also you probably could just return `self.root_to_elements_dict().itervalues()` since it is an iterator object (it avoids a level of indirection).

Thanks,

Travis

PS - I'm assuming this was suppose to be set to needs_review. Sorry if it wasn't.

I made a new version. It's ok with that?

Furthermore, I added a new method ``_getitem_`` which return the set associated to the argument:

```
sage: d =  DisjointSet(range(4))
sage: d.union(1,2); d
{{0}, {1,2}, {3}}
sage: d[2]
[1,2]
```

(My opinion is when we write ``d.find(2)`` we expect ``[1,2]`` and not ``1`` (that means nothing for user) but I don't want reimplement all so... what is your opinion about that?)

Thanks,

Jean-Baptiste

Hi,

Last time I answered little bit quickly (and my code is false). For me, a disjoint union is roughly a list of list (set of disjoint sets) with two particular method `union` and `find`. It seems natural (and consistent with the representation), if there is a `_getitem_` method that returns one of these lists. It will be disturbing and irrelevant to have 

```
__getitem__ = find
```
And if you are agree with that my question is : what's the input? An element in the union of the sets or an indice? I think it could be interesting to have an element.
(I imagine a disjoint sets on all permutations of size `k`, it seems cool and agradable to visualize easily the class of a particular permutation)
