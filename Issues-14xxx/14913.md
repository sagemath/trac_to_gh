Adding `GroupMixinLibGAP` to the class `FinitelyPresentedGroup` adds basic functionality
to finitely presented groups such as `is_abelian`, which previously threw a NotImplementedError.

```
sage: F = FreeGroup(2)
sage: G = F / [F([1,2,-1,-2])]
sage: G.is_abelian()
True
```

I discovered the following behavior while writing doctests for a direct_product function for finitely presented groups.

```
sage: from sage.groups.finitely_presented import wrap_FpGroup
sage: F = FreeGroup("a")
sage: G = FreeGroup("b")
sage: C4 = F / [F.0^4]
sage: C3 = G / [G.0^3]

sage: C12 = wrap_FpGroup(libgap.DirectProduct([C3.gap(), C4.gap()]))
sage: C12
Finitely presented group < f1, f2 | f1^3, f2^4, f1^-1*f2^-1*f1*f2 >
sage: C12.is_isomorphic(F / [F.0^12])
False
sage: C12.as_permutation_group().is_isomorphic(CyclicPermutationGroup(12))
True

# Again, constructing C12 by hand as C3 x C4.
sage: K = FreeGroup(2)
sage: C_12 = K / [K.0^4, K.1^3, K([-1,-2,1,2])]
sage: C_12
Finitely presented group < x0, x1 | x0^4, x1^3, x0^-1*x1^-1*x0*x1 >
sage: C_12.is_isomorphic(F / [F.0^12])
False
sage: C_12.as_permutation_group().is_isomorphic(CyclicPermutationGroup(12))
True
```
To replicate this behavior you must apply the patch attached to this ticket, #14913.

This failure of the `is_isomorphic` call seems to recur in similar instances of cyclic groups being constructed as a direct product. I'm not sure if I should make a new ticket for this apparent bug, but at the very least it seems as though it should halt this ticket.

Added `check=True` as last argument for `FinitelyPresentedGroupElement` python constructor. Adding this argument to `__init__` for `FinitelyPresentedGroup` did not appear to have the desired affect. The examples below now run smoothly.

```
sage: G = FreeGroup("a")
sage: F = G / [G([1,1,1,1,1])]
sage: F.is_abelian()
True
sage: F.order()
5
sage: [i for i in F]
[1, a, a^-1, a^2, a^-2]
sage: F([1,1,1]).inverse()         
a^-3
sage: F([1,1,1]).inverse() in F
True
```
Is this what you meant by adding the `check=<bool>` argument? If so then ready for review.

Yes, thats what I meant: the element constructor needs to accept a dummy check argument.
