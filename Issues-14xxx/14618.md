In the discussion of ticket #9136, it was mentioned that a generator for fullerenes would be a great addition. The fullerene generator fullgen by Gunnar Brinkmann can't be added due to licensing problems. Brinkmann's student Jan Goedgebeur implemented a new version using a different algorithm which is faster for the `small' cases: http://caagt.ugent.be/buckygen/ This program is available under the GPL 3, so I assume it can be integrated in Sage.

"Planar graphs are not supported" ? What do you mean ? Do you mean that the embedding, or the positions are lost ? May it be what you need ?

http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/graphs/sage/graphs/generic_graph.html#sage.graphs.generic_graph.GenericGraph.get_embedding

I never used it myself, though it looks "useful" if you really, really work on planar graphs `:-)`

You have to build a spkg.

So, I think I have a first version ready. You will need the following spkg:

http://users.ugent.be/~nvcleemp/buckygen-1.0.spkg

I guess this can become a standard package, since it is GPL v3.

Helloooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo !!!

NIiiiiiiice to have this in Sage ! I already know a couple of persons who will be interested in this feature `:-)`

Some comments:
* I think that the method should be renamed "fullerenes". Or "fullerenes_buckygen" if you must, but really I think that it has to indicate what it does. And "fullerenes" is pretty nice in this attempt. Of course do cite buckygen wherever you can, it's not made to steal credit or anything, it's just that if I wanted to generate fullerenes I wouldn't know that this is what "buckygen" does.
* In sage we usually use long names ... But it's true that `isolated_pentagon_rule = True` is really long `:-/`
* Here is what happens when the spkg is not installed 
  {{{
sage: list(graphs.buckygen(60))

---

}}}
   Could you add a message saying something like "To use this method you must install the buckygen spkg" ?
* Your doctests do not pass when buckygen is not installed, so you should flag them with `# optional - buckygen`. You can see how it is done in 
  {{{
sage: graphs.nauty_geng?
}}}
* For LaTeX expression in Sphinx (Sage's documentation builder) you can't use `$`, and you should use ` instead. See `Graph.dominating_set?` for an example.
  You can rebuild the documentation (and check that it works) by running this 
  {{{
  sage -b && sage -docbuild reference/graphs html
}}}
* There is a special syntax for references in Sphinx. Take a look at `sage.graphs.comparability??`

* When `n < 20`, why don't we just yield an empty iterator ? Is there any reason to raise an exception in this case ?

* Whenever a new generator is added, it muuuuuuuusst appear in the module's doc, i.e. there : http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/graphs/sage/graphs/graph_generators.html. Can you add yours to the "Families of graphs" section ? All this appears at the top of graph_generators.py.

That's all I can think of right now `:-)`

And thank you very much again for adding this. That's good stuff !

OK, I'll change all of that. I used ipr, because also in the literature this is almost always referred to as IPR and hardly ever as Isolated Pentagon Rule.

The naming buckygen was only based on nauty_geng: it's certainly no problem to rename it to fullerenes. Btw, that's the way we do it in CaGe.
