In the discussion of ticket #9136, it was mentioned that a generator for fullerenes would be a great addition. The fullerene generator fullgen by Gunnar Brinkmann can't be added due to licensing problems. Brinkmann's student Jan Goedgebeur implemented a new version using a different algorithm which is faster for the `small' cases: http://caagt.ugent.be/buckygen/ This program is available under the GPL 3, so I assume it can be integrated in Sage.

Well, buckygen supports export in graph6, sparse6 and planar_code format. Using the first two is no problem, since they are already supported by Sage. However, this looses some information: buckygen generates plane graphs. This doesn't seem to be supported in Sage. Is that correct? Is it something that might be added in the near future?

So, I think I have a first version ready. You will need the following spkg:

http://users.ugent.be/~nvcleemp/buckygen-1.0.spkg

I guess this can become a standard package, since it is GPL v3.

I looked at different spkg and copied what they did, so I hope that everything is in order. The same goes for the patch. Let me know what needs to be changed.

Helloooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo !!!

NIiiiiiiice to have this in Sage ! I already know a couple of persons who will be interested in this feature `:-)`

Some comments:
* I think that the method should be renamed "fullerenes". Or "fullerenes_buckygen" if you must, but really I think that it has to indicate what it does. And "fullerenes" is pretty nice in this attempt. Of course do cite buckygen wherever you can, it's not made to steal credit or anything, it's just that if I wanted to generate fullerenes I wouldn't know that this is what "buckygen" does.
* In sage we usually use long names ... But it's true that `isolated_pentagon_rule = True` is really long `:-/`
* Here is what happens when the spkg is not installed 

  ```
  sage: list(graphs.buckygen(60))
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  AssertionError                            Traceback (most recent call last)
  <ipython-input-2-b82c592bf78f> in <module>()
  ----> 1 list(graphs.buckygen(Integer(60)))
  
  /home/ncohen/.Sage/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/graphs/graph_generators.pyc in buckygen(self, order, ipr)
     1006         header = out.read(13)
     1007 
  -> 1008         assert header == '>>planar_code', 'Not a valid planar code header'
     1009 
     1010         c = out.read(1)
  
  AssertionError: Not a valid planar code header
```
   Could you add a message saying something like "To use this method you must install the buckygen spkg" ?
* Your doctests do not pass when buckygen is not installed, so you should flag them with `# optional - buckygen`. You can see how it is done in 

  ```
  sage: graphs.nauty_geng?
```
* For LaTeX expression in Sphinx (Sage's documentation builder) you can't use `$`, and you should use ` instead. See `Graph.dominating_set?` for an example.
  You can rebuild the documentation (and check that it works) by running this 

  ```
  sage -b && sage -docbuild reference/graphs html
```
* There is a special syntax for references in Sphinx. Take a look at `sage.graphs.comparability??`

* When `n < 20`, why don't we just yield an empty iterator ? Is there any reason to raise an exception in this case ?

* Whenever a new generator is added, it muuuuuuuusst appear in the module's doc, i.e. there : http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/graphs/sage/graphs/graph_generators.html. Can you add yours to the "Families of graphs" section ? All this appears at the top of graph_generators.py.

That's all I can think of right now `:-)`

And thank you very much again for adding this. That's good stuff !

Hi, thanks for the feedback. I've modified the spkg, it is still at 

 http://users.ugent.be/~nvcleemp/buckygen-1.0.spkg 

I've indeed found the explanation that a spkg should first be optional for a while on the wiki. I had missed that at first.

I'll also add a new version of the patch.

```
sage: list(graphs.fullerenes(30))

sage: list(graphs.fullerenes(20))

sage: list(graphs.fullerenes(10))

sage: list(graphs.fullerenes(15))

There's no problem to me if the method returns an empty list when no graph exists.... Tell me what you think !
