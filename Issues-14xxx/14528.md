Hello!

This patch introduces new tests and documentation for the graph.py file. The previous version of the tests took 10 seconds to finish, the new one takes ~3 minutes.

Please consider suggesting new tests as well and telling which one should be marked with #long time (if any)

Best,

Jernej

HMmm... This, on the other hand, is probably a bad idea... You make some tests very long to check and we are supposed to run tests very often (I got yelled at recently for not doing it). 

Most of the tests you added are good, but you increased several constants a lot : `trees(6)` bbecomes `trees(15)`, and you test twice that a bipartite graph with more than 1000 vertices is bipartite `:-P`

And computer the chromatic number of Kneser graphs is very slow if I remember correctly `O_o`

Plus I'm not very sure that Jeroen would like that ... `:-P`

If a test takes more than 5 seconds I guess you should put a # long time somewhere. Perhaps it is even written somewhere in the developper's manual.

Agreed. But then what we need is a way to record past performances, not make tests longer. I an quite unaware of the time Sage takes to compile because it is usually so long that I run it before leaving my office. So compiling Sage "takes one night", whatever is added to it `:-P`

Hmmm... What we need is a way to record performances I guess. That's an interesting problem though `O_O`

Yes! Also considering the fact that your hardware setup may change drastically over the years...

BTW do you use the make flag that makes use of parallelization when building sage?

We need a better framework for extensive tests. Something that you can run over the night, as is I don't feel relieved when the tests pass with success.

From time to time. Actually, I run all tests on my lab's computer, not on my laptop. This parallel tests do make a difference !

Yep. It's mostly to check different input, and to "remember" that some things have been fixed if we ever reimplement it.

Tests? I meant the export "MAKE -j ncores" thing!

Yes, maybe a good proposal for next year.

Anyways, I still think some of the tests here could still be integrated and I can remove the ones you find too slow.

Oh. I thought that you had "make ptestlong" in mind. I also do this export MAKE="make -j2" then.

> Anyways, I still think some of the tests here could still be integrated and I can remove the ones you find too slow.

Most of them should, indeed, But testing a graph on 1000 vertices is probably too much, and enumerating all trees up to 15 vertices too `^^;`

Not to mention that most of them are very path-shaped... A random tree is not that interesting :-P

```
sage: graphs.RandomTree(100).show(layout="spring",iterations =5000)

Hmmmmmm... This is still very long `:-/`

```
sage: g = graphs.RandomBipartite(7,7,0.7) 
sage: %time g.line_graph().is_perfect() 
CPU times: user 104.32 s, sys: 0.07 s, total: 104.39 s
Wall time: 104.86 s
True
```

Could you make the graph smaller, or at the very list add a "# long time" flag to those two lines ?

By the way, perhaps it could make sense now to add some code in `is_perfect` to check if the graph is the line graph of a bipartite graph... As we can now compute the root graph `:-P` I wonder what the performances would be `:-)`

Thanks for the comment I'll fix that.

As for the is_perfect method. The line graph of a bipartite graph is in fact the Cartesian product of complete graphs. Hence an even faster way to recognize them is use the Cartesian factorisation algorithm and check that each component is a clique.

In the near future I'd really love to have the poly time algorithm for testing perfect graphs.

Yepyep, but line graphs of bipartite graphs are a larger class of perfect graphs. May even be included in ISGCI !

Ahahahah. Yep, now that would be something we could boast about `:-)`

Hellooooooooooooo !!

Agreed. Though I really have no idea what someone who has a use for this method will run it on.

> Yeah! I think it *should* not be that hard to implement but I don't think anyone is really using this test that much...

Agreed too. But at this level, we mostly code algorithms for our own pleasure, even if sometimes, much later, some guys comes up saying that it helped him.

I spent a crazy amount of time writing #14562 and I really have no use for it `:-P`

> PS. I have updated the patch, could you please check if its fine with you?

Immediately !
