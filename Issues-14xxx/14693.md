```
Converting a power series to the symbolic ring doesn't work as expected:

```
sage: R.<t> = PowerSeriesRing(QQ)
sage: p = R([1,2,3])
sage: SR(p).variables()
()
sage: diff(SR(p))
0
```

Perhaps it could be converted to a polynomial first and then converted to the symbolic ring?

```
sage: SR(p.polynomial()).variables()
(t,)
sage: diff(SR(p.polynomial()))      
6*t + 2
```

Or maybe just raise an error (as per #13360)?
