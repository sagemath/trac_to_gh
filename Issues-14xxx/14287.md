Currently ``_test_elements_eq`` tests for reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity. However, transitivity does not hold in padic rings. This tickets splits ``_test_elements_eq`` into these three subtests, so they that we can override the transitivity test for padic implementations.

<div id="comment:11" align="right">Comment 11</div>

Just a micro comment about the use of this ticket; not its
implementation.

``However, transitivity does not hold in padic rings''

Sounds scary! Well, as long as you know what you are doing :-)

``so they that we can override the transitivity test for padic
implementations''

I am not sure what's your plan for this; just in case, and unless this
becomes too cumbersome, I prefer writing explicitly each time:

```
    sage: TestSuite(...).run(skip="....transitivity")
```

rather than systematically disabling the transitivity test. First,
that's the occasion to warn the user about an atypical behavior.  And
to get more people to thing about creative ways of fixing that.
Second, the test might actually pass in certain cases, and it's a
useful information to record.

Cheers,
                         Nicolas

I see your point. However, these tests will not pass and there is no way to avoid this (other than disabling `==` completely). It's an intrinsic problem with padics (or anything that is stored to different precision).

I agree that we could use a `skip` to warn the user but on the other hand it is probably more confusing...
