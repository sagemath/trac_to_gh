Jeroen ran "pyflakes" on the sage code, which detects certain kinds of problems (which can then be confirmed by testing).  

```
sage: X=QuiverMutationType('F',4,(2,1))
sage: X.class_size()
...
NameError: global name 'twist' is not defined
```

Same issue for type G.

<a id='comment:4'></a>Thanks for catching this Jeroen and Hugh!

Just to clarify, when you say "this wasn't the only problem in the code", does trac_14048-fix-cluster-class_size-bug-ht.patch appear to fix the issue that Jereon found or was there an additional issue that we had to deal with?

Also to update you: 10527 and 10538 are merged into 5.5 and 5.6.

     Christian, Salvatore, and I are nearing completion of 13369 (perhaps by next week), and 13424 should be ready shortly after.

If the ticket really is just these couple lines, and I don't believe 13369 or 13424 alter quiver_mutation_type.py, we could double-check that this fix would be independent of our current work and then possibly give it a quick positive review.

Also, Christian and I will both be at ICERM Feb 11-15 so can discuss it there, if this ticket is still outstanding then.

Gregg

<a id='comment:5'></a>I fixed the issue Jeroen found and also the issue I found.  So this ticket is ready to go and, so far as I know, makes class_size work correctly.  

It sounds like the easiest thing might be if you can check it doesn't play badly with the new patches, and give it a green light.  

cheers,
