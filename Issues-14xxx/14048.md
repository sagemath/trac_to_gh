Jeroen ran "pyflakes" on the sage code, which detects certain kinds of problems (which can then be confirmed by testing).  

```
sage: X=QuiverMutationType('F',4,(2,1))
sage: X.class_size()
...
NameError: global name 'twist' is not defined
```

Same issue for type G.

Oh, also, turns out we were checking that twist be a tuple, and it is never a tuple, so this wasn't the only problem in the code!

Patch coming soon.

It would also be fine with me if you want to fold this into one of the big cluster patches.

Thanks for catching this Jeroen and Hugh!

Just to clarify, when you say "this wasn't the only problem in the code", does trac_14048-fix-cluster-class_size-bug-ht.patch appear to fix the issue that Jereon found or was there an additional issue that we had to deal with?

Also to update you: 10527 and 10538 are merged into 5.5 and 5.6.

     Christian, Salvatore, and I are nearing completion of 13369 (perhaps by next week), and 13424 should be ready shortly after.

If the ticket really is just these couple lines, and I don't believe 13369 or 13424 alter quiver_mutation_type.py, we could double-check that this fix would be independent of our current work and then possibly give it a quick positive review.

Also, Christian and I will both be at ICERM Feb 11-15 so can discuss it there, if this ticket is still outstanding then.

Gregg

I fixed the issue Jeroen found and also the issue I found.  So this ticket is ready to go and, so far as I know, makes class_size work correctly.  

It sounds like the easiest thing might be if you can check it doesn't play badly with the new patches, and give it a green light.  

cheers,

Hugh
