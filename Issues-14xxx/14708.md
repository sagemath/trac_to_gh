I think that these "vertex labels" are meant to associate non-hashable values to a vertex (whose name must be hashable).

I never used it, I also think that it is useless (just use an external dictionary..) and that we would be better without it.

<div id="comment:9" align="right">comment:9</div>

I would like to address the issue raised in the comments section.

This is the source code for the ***set_vertex()*** function for generic graphs

```python
def set_vertex(self, vertex, object):
    if hasattr(self, '_assoc') is False:
        self._assoc = {}

    self._assoc[vertex] = object
```

Since _assoc is a dictionary, even if the vertex isn't added beforehand (as in the example demonstrated in the comments section), the dictionary adds an entry into it. For example,

```python
>>> vert = {}
>>> vert['foo'] = 'bar'
>>> vert
{'foo': 'bar'}
```

But we are adding a new vertex only on the call of the method ***_backend.add_vertex()*** in the graph. Hence, on calling the method ***get_vertices()***, 'foo' was not displayed.

But remember that **_alloc** already has the dictionary entry {*foo*: *bar*}. So once the method ***add_vertex('foo')*** is called, the entry *foo* is added to the list of vertices in the graph, and so on calling get_vertices, the entry {*foo*: *bar*} is displayed.

This solution did not work. The problem still persist

```
sage: g.set_vertex(0, 'foo')
sage: g.get_vertices()
{0: 'foo', 1: None, 2: None, 3: None, 4: None}
sage: Graph(g).get_vertices()
{0: None, 1: None, 2: None, 3: None, 4: None}
```
I think the problem is in not communicating the labels of vertices in `g` to `Graph(g)`.

If we look at the `.set_vertex` method, we have

```
self._assoc[vertex] = object
```
which, I believe, is not being transferred to Graph(g). On the other hand, in the `.set_edge_label` method, we have

```
self._backend.set_edge_label(u, v, l, self._directed)
```
I am not yet sure how these two different implementations affect Graph(g), but edge labels are retained in Graph(g) but not vertex labels

I went through the `__init__` constructa of both `Graph` and `DiGraph` classes and found this line in both of them:

```python
self.add_vertices(data.vertex_iterator())
self.add_edges(data.edge_iterator())
```
Now in the `vertex_iterator` there is no field for the labels

```sage
sage: g = digraphs.DeBruijn(2,2)
sage: for v in g.vertex_iterator():
....:     print(v)
....:     
11
10
00
01
```
But the labels are displayed in the case of `edge_iterator`

```sage
sage: for v in g.edge_iterator():
....:     print(v)
....:     
('11', '10', '0')
('11', '11', '1')
('10', '00', '0')
('10', '01', '1')
('00', '00', '0')
('00', '01', '1')
('01', '10', '0')
('01', '11', '1')
```
If we need to modify into the `vertex_iterator` method. we must change the back-end code.

```python
def vertex_iterator(self, vertices=None):
    return self._backend.iterator_verts(vertices)
```
I'll have to look into the Pyrex file `basic/c_graph.pyx` to modify `_backend.iterator_verts(vertices)`, but can I do it? I generally would not like to touch the backend files because there could be many more methods using it
