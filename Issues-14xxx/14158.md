#13370 changed

```
def bint _is_Field(x)
```
to

```
cpdef bint _is_Field(x)
```
*without* an `except` declaration.

For example, I have seen in between doctests:

```
sage -t  --long -force_lib devel/sage/sage/graphs/generic_graph.py
Exception RuntimeError: RuntimeError("Gap produced error output\nError, Variable: 'is_field' must have a value\n\n   executing is_field();",) in 'sage.rings.ring._is_Field' ignored
```
