I have uploaded an add-on patch which  
- puts the raise statements into python3 syntax
- adds the links to the trac tickets

But there is a problem with your patch: one doctest is failing, there is no curve called '50700u1', even after installing the extended Cremona database.

?? Yes there is!  However, in order for this test to be usable without the optional database I suggest replacing it with

```
EllipticCurve([0,1,0,-4788,109188]).galois_representation().image_type(13)
```
(I have inserted the a-invariants of 50700u1).

Chris, can you give us (here) a quick note about the new el5 assignment from roots of a quadratic instead of whatever it was before?

Also, we need to put instructions in the descriptions about applying both patches in sequence.

Seconded -- thanks for the explanation.   I think it is better to have that written on this ticket, though I know I could have worked that out for myself, if it had not been the week of exam marking for me...

<a id='comment:15'>**Comment 15:**</a>
Too late for this ticket, but unfortunately a typo causes this:

```
EllipticCurve([0, 0, 0, -1129345880,-86028258620304]).galois_representation().image_type(11)
```
gives

```
NameError: global name 'nonsplit_str' is not defined
```
because the identifier non_split_str is referred to wrongly on lines 1054 and 1108 in gal_reps.py.  I have another patch which I will put onto a new ticket: #14752.
