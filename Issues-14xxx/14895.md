```
Try, for example, `2^I.pyobject()`.

This is a critical issue since any method of a class inheriting from `BuiltinFunction` will receive the I pyobject if I is passed as an argument to the function.

This in turn leads to segfaults like:

```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^2+1)
sage: 2^a
```
or

```
sage: K.<sqrt2> = QuadraticField(2)
sage: 2^sqrt2
```
