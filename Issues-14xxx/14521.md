Works fine for me on 10.8. 

If someone else can test on 10.5/6, that'll be good, though I can't see anything different happening (the change is more a post/pre-10.5 change inside OS X), hence the positive review.

I'm asking the dumb question... did anyone test the actual built Sage.app on these systems, not just building Sage.app?  Though I can't imagine this is going to be a problem, but still, without this patch

```
$ cd mac-app/
$ grep -R NSInteger .
./PreferencePanelController.m:- (void)alertDidEnd:(NSAlert *)alert returnCode:(NSInteger)returnCode contextInfo:(void *)contextInfo {
$ grep -R long .
./AppDelegate.m:// From here down are methods from NSApplicationDelegate, which probably do belong in another file.
./loading-page.html:  <h3>If you think you have waited long enough...</h2>
```
for what it's worth.

I can try building the app on 10.7 later today.  I agree that it probably will not make a difference, though it's still worth trying on a few different ones *just* to make sure.

Not a dumb question. On OS X 10.4 PPC, I only tried *building* the Sage App.

I'm having trouble getting things to start on 10.7 with this.  The Sage terminal stuff works fine but in the notebook

```
exceptions.ImportError: No module named openid

Failed to load application: No module named openid

```
and

```
sage/devel/sagenb/sagenb/notebook/run_notebook.py", line 608, in notebook_run
    raise socket.error
socket.error
```
This sounds familiar with the NB upgrade but I don't know why this one change would have made it happen.  This is with 5.9.rc1, I believe.

I'm currently bdisting 5.8.beta4 on 10.4 PPC but it will probably only be ready on Monday.

No, same as jdemeyer, I just built it.

I ran it just now, and it worked fine. I'm with 5.9.rc1 as well.

I don't really understand this sentence. If you mean that you're using the upgraded notebook (not the one that came with Sage), then probably the problem isn't this ticket, but the notebook upgrade.

Indeed, I was using the upstream sagenb linked in, which definitely has something to do with it.  This *does* actually work on 10.4 - I have tried a bdist!  I am going to try this on a non-corrupted one on 10.7 now, and if that works then I think we should be okay.
