Works fine for me on 10.8. 

If someone else can test on 10.5/6, that'll be good, though I can't see anything different happening (the change is more a post/pre-10.5 change inside OS X), hence the positive review.

I'm asking the dumb question... did anyone test the actual built Sage.app on these systems, not just building Sage.app?  Though I can't imagine this is going to be a problem, but still, without this patch

```
$ cd mac-app/
$ grep -R NSInteger .
./PreferencePanelController.m:- (void)alertDidEnd:(NSAlert *)alert returnCode:(NSInteger)returnCode contextInfo:(void *)contextInfo {
$ grep -R long .
./AppDelegate.m:// From here down are methods from NSApplicationDelegate, which probably do belong in another file.
./loading-page.html:  <h3>If you think you have waited long enough...</h2>
```
for what it's worth.

I can try building the app on 10.7 later today.  I agree that it probably will not make a difference, though it's still worth trying on a few different ones *just* to make sure.

Not a dumb question. On OS X 10.4 PPC, I only tried *building* the Sage App.

I'm having trouble getting things to start on 10.7 with this.  The Sage terminal stuff works fine but in the notebook

```
exceptions.ImportError: No module named openid

Failed to load application: No module named openid

```
and

```
sage/devel/sagenb/sagenb/notebook/run_notebook.py", line 608, in notebook_run
    raise socket.error
socket.error
```
This sounds familiar with the NB upgrade but I don't know why this one change would have made it happen.  This is with 5.9.rc1, I believe.

I'm currently bdisting 5.8.beta4 on 10.4 PPC but it will probably only be ready on Monday.
