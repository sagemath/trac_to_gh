If the origin is on the boundary of the polytope then FaceFan fails to raise an appropriate error:

```
sage: FaceFan(Polyhedron([(-1,0), (1,0), (0,1)])).generating_cones()       
(2-d cone of Rational polyhedral fan in 2-d lattice N,
 1-d cone of Rational polyhedral fan in 2-d lattice N,
 2-d cone of Rational polyhedral fan in 2-d lattice N)
```

Depends on #13194
