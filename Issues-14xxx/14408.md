With the current optional dot2tex spkg, some doctests are failing:

```
sage: g = digraphs.ButterflyGraph(2)
sage: g.plot(layout = "graphviz", prog = "neato") # optional - dot2tex, graphviz
Traceback (most recent call last): 
...
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '67.297'
```

This is due to a bug in dot2tex which was fixed in the upstream
development branch (but there was no official release since then):

    http://code.google.com/p/dot2tex/issues/detail?id=20

See also the top of sage.graphs.doc2tex_utils.

A first step toward is available at:

A second step towards is available at:

http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/leif/Sage/spkgs/dot2tex-2.9.0-dev-20120520.p0.spkg

(This one is [technically] based on the `2.8.7.p2` spkg from #14594, rather than on Nicolas' `2.8.7-dev` spkg above.)

So revision 259 (from late 2009!) seems to be the latest one; I *guess* that's the one in Nicolas' `2.8.7-dev` spkg.

Nope, the subversion repo is no longer updated, the last commit to the (newer) Mercurial repo is

```
changeset:   52:c31a5296fc1b
tag:         tip
user:        Kjell Magne Fauske
date:        Sun May 20 11:11:13 2012 +0200
summary:     Removed an unused method+ typos
```

But that's in turn a newer version than in Nicolas' `-dev` spkg.

(And I'm happy that Kjell decided to rename the `2.8.x-dev` to `2.9.x[-dev]`, since 2.8.7 is released and hence `2.8.7-dev` as a *successor* of `2.8.7` is illogical, i.e., sounded more like a *prerelease* of `2.8.7`.)

```

Oops, that mean I screwed up my upgrading the package the other day
:-) Thanks for catching this.

Rebuild? ;-)

And we may also take care of currently failing (optional dot2tex) doctests here [afterwards].

Oops, the optional flag above is wrong: in this example, the latex is
produced by plain Sage, using tkz-graph/..., not by dot2tex/graphviz.


I believe that this test, and all the others, would have already
failed with the previous spkg, and are probably the failing optional
tests that Sébastien mentioned he was working on another ticket.

Sébastien: can you comment? Can I let you synchronize the two efforts?

Thanks!

<a id='comment:17'></a>I went through the diff showing the changes in the spkg and they look good to me!

The blurb about upgrading the sources from upstream could go in the developpers manual at some point :-)

As for the failing tests in dot2tex itself: we should report them upstream, but we can probably ignore them.

Thanks again!

Cheers,

We're switching to git... ;-)

Well, some look pretty scary, and the following sounds familiar:

```
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '30.139'
```
(I thought that was an issue you reported upstream and which was supposed to have been fixed in the devel version.)

I think (haven't really checked exactly) these are the same I reported for the (stable) `2.8.7.p2` spkg at  #14594.

Just reinstalled both spkgs and reran the tests; the doctest failures are exactly the same.

P.S.:  The pop-up windows are really annoying!  (Especially since they get the focus, such that you can't type at the same time.)

Since it patches the Sage library rather than `dot2tex` (i.e., the spkg), I think it deserves its own ticket.

(Also, it's a different component, so needs to really get merged into some release, as opposed to just updating the package repository.)

The version there isn't based on the spkg here.  Also, both are based on a 2.9.0-dev version / snapshot (as opposed to the last stable release, 2.8.7), last updated in April 2012, so having 20140329 in the (upstream!) tarball filename is pretty misleading.
