On a serious note, what I do mean is all the "is_Vector", "is_Polynomial", "is_Matrix", and what not. The patch will be trivial but tiresome. I don't know any means of listing and testing whether they give a deprecation warning automatically. So, it has to be a slow, manual, and visual process.

for x in globals().keys():
    if re.match("is_[A-Z]", x) is not None:
        try:

        if re.match(".*DeprecationWarning", output) is not None:

is a hack but should work.
