Thanks Charles, this is very good to have!

A comment and a question:

* The doctest with output "doctest:311" will likely break later on. Better is to write "doctest:..." in the output.

* Why an error in one situation and a warning in another? Why not a warning in both? You are disallowing some functionality with the error, as seen from the following in an unpatched Sage 5.7:

```
sage: k.<i> = NumberField(x^2+1)
sage: l.<b> = k.extension(5*x^2 + 3)
sage: c = b + b
sage: c^2 == -12/5
True
sage: c^2 == b
False
```

* There is a discrepancy between the absolute and the relative case. With your patch on Sage 5.7:

```
sage: k.<a> = NumberField(5*x^2+3)
NotImplementedError: number fields for non-monic polynomials not yet implemented.
sage: k.<i> = NumberField(x^2+1)
sage: l.<b> = k.extension(5*x^2+3)
ValueError: the polynomial must be monic
```
I prefer the `NotImplementedError`, and it would be good to add a reference to #252 to that error message.

Fine with me. I looked at this in a bit more detail, and have some questions:

* Why import "warn" from "sage.misc.superseded" and not directly from Python's "warnings" module as is done in `superseded.py`?

* When I try the examples in a Sage session, I get the warning printed twice. Is that supposed to happen?

I did some of the corrections myself that I did not get an answer to:

* "..." instead of a doctest number
* `NotImplementedError`, because it is more appropriate than `ValueError` and also more in line with the absolute case
* import `warn` more directly

However, I still don't understand why I get the warning printed twice:

```

I know why the warning is printed twice: the line that caused the warning is printed, after the warning is printed. You can specify how deep in the stack this line needs to be found:

Without specifying stacklevel or when giving stacklevel=1:

```
/Users/marcostreng/sage-5.9.beta1/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/rings/number_field/number_field_rel.py:310: UserWarning: PARI only handles integral absolute polynomials. Computations in this field might trigger PARI errors
  warn("PARI only handles integral absolute polynomials. Computations in this field might trigger PARI errors", stacklevel=1)
```
stacklevel=2:

```
/Users/marcostreng/sage-5.9.beta1/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/rings/number_field/number_field.py:4116: UserWarning: PARI only handles integral absolute polynomials. Computations in this field might trigger PARI errors
  return NumberField_relative(self, poly, str(name), check=check, embedding=embedding)
```
stacklevel=3:

```
/Users/marcostreng/sage-5.9.beta1/local/bin/sage-ipython:1: UserWarning: PARI only handles integral absolute polynomials. Computations in this field might trigger PARI errors
  #!/usr/bin/env python
```

Anyway, no value of stacklevel seemed to provide me with anything useful for .py or .sage files or the IPython console, so we might as well keep it as it is.
