    "body": "<a id='comment:7'>Comment 7:</a>\nThanks Charles, this is very good to have!\n\nA comment and a question:\n\n* The doctest with output \"doctest:311\" will likely break later on. Better is to write \"doctest:...\" in the output.\n\n* Why an error in one situation and a warning in another? Why not a warning in both? You are disallowing some functionality with the error, as seen from the following in an unpatched Sage 5.7:\n\n```\nsage: k.<i> = NumberField(x^2+1)\nsage: l.<b> = k.extension(5*x^2 + 3)\nsage: c = b + b\nsage: c^2 == -12/5\nTrue\nsage: c^2 == b\nFalse\n```\n\n* There is a discrepancy between the absolute and the relative case.

Thanks Charles, this is very good to have!

A comment and a question:

* The doctest with output "doctest:311" will likely break later on. Better is to write "doctest:..." in the output.

* Why an error in one situation and a warning in another? Why not a warning in both? You are disallowing some functionality with the error, as seen from the following in an unpatched Sage 5.7:

```
sage: k.<i> = NumberField(x^2+1)
sage: l.<b> = k.extension(5*x^2 + 3)
sage: c = b + b
sage: c^2 == -12/5
True
sage: c^2 == b
False
```

* There is a discrepancy between the absolute and the relative case. With your patch on Sage 5.7:

```
sage: k.<a> = NumberField(5*x^2+3)
NotImplementedError: number fields for non-monic polynomials not yet implemented.
sage: k.<i> = NumberField(x^2+1)
sage: l.<b> = k.extension(5*x^2+3)
ValueError: the polynomial must be monic
```
I prefer the `NotImplementedError`, and it would be good to add a reference to #252 to that error message.

Fine with me. I looked at this in a bit more detail, and have some questions:

* Why import "warn" from "sage.misc.superseded" and not directly from Python's "warnings" module as is done in `superseded.py`?

* When I try the examples in a Sage session, I get the warning printed twice. Is that supposed to happen?

I did some of the corrections myself that I did not get an answer to:

* "..." instead of a doctest number
* `NotImplementedError`, because it is more appropriate than `ValueError` and also more in line with the absolute case
* import `warn` more directly

However, I still don't understand why I get the warning printed twice:

```

sage: l.<b> = k.extension(x^3-1/2)

I know why the warning is printed twice: the line that caused the warning is printed, after the warning is printed. You can specify how deep in the stack this line needs to be found:

Without specifying stacklevel or when giving stacklevel=1:

Anyway, no value of stacklevel seemed to provide me with anything useful for .py or .sage files or the IPython console, so we might as well keep it as it is.

<a id='comment:17'>Comment 17:</a>
All tests pass. Positive review to [attachment: 14146_number_fields.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket14146/14146_number_fields.patch.gz) except for what I changed in the reviewer patch. Could someone (Charles?) review my reviewer patch? Thanks!

The reviewer patch is fine. Still, the example given above by Marco is now disallowed. This one :

```
sage: k.<i> = NumberField(x^2+1)
sage: l.<b> = k.extension(5*x^2 + 3)
sage: c = b + b
sage: c^2 == -12/5
True
sage: c^2 == b
False

I know, it is too bad. I justified it to myself by noting that it is in line with the absolute case.
