Thanks Charles, this is very good to have!

A comment and a question:

* The doctest with output "doctest:311" will likely break later on. Better is to write "doctest:..." in the output.

* Why an error in one situation and a warning in another? Why not a warning in both? You are disallowing some functionality with the error, as seen from the following in an unpatched Sage 5.7:

```
sage: k.<i> = NumberField(x^2+1)
sage: l.<b> = k.extension(5*x^2 + 3)
sage: c = b + b
sage: c^2 == -12/5
True
sage: c^2 == b
False
```

* There is a discrepancy between the absolute and the relative case. With your patch on Sage 5.7:

```
sage: k.<a> = NumberField(5*x^2+3)
NotImplementedError: number fields for non-monic polynomials not yet implemented.
sage: k.<i> = NumberField(x^2+1)
sage: l.<b> = k.extension(5*x^2+3)
ValueError: the polynomial must be monic
```
I prefer the `NotImplementedError`, and it would be good to add a reference to #252 to that error message.

> I did not touch the absolute case.

Fine with me. I looked at this in a bit more detail, and have some questions:

* Why import "warn" from "sage.misc.superseded" and not directly from Python's "warnings" module as is done in `superseded.py`?

* When I try the examples in a Sage session, I get the warning printed twice. Is that supposed to happen?

**Attachment:** [14146_reviewer.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket14146/14146_reviewer.patch.gz)

I did some of the corrections myself that I did not get an answer to:

* "..." instead of a doctest number
* `NotImplementedError`, because it is more appropriate than `ValueError` and also more in line with the absolute case
* import `warn` more directly

However, I still don't understand why I get the warning printed twice:

```

sage: l.<b> = k.extension(x^3-1/2)

I know why the warning is printed twice: the line that caused the warning is printed, after the warning is printed. You can specify how deep in the stack this line needs to be found:

Without specifying stacklevel or when giving stacklevel=1:

```
/Users/marcostreng/sage-5.9.beta1/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/rings/number_field/number_field_rel.py:310: UserWarning: PARI only handles integral absolute polynomials. Computations in this field might trigger PARI errors
  warn("PARI only handles integral absolute polynomials. Computations in this field might trigger PARI errors", stacklevel=1)
```
stacklevel=2:

```
/Users/marcostreng/sage-5.9.beta1/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/rings/number_field/number_field.py:4116: UserWarning: PARI only handles integral absolute polynomials. Computations in this field might trigger PARI errors
  return NumberField_relative(self, poly, str(name), check=check, embedding=embedding)
```
stacklevel=3:

```
/Users/marcostreng/sage-5.9.beta1/local/bin/sage-ipython:1: UserWarning: PARI only handles integral absolute polynomials. Computations in this field might trigger PARI errors
  #!/usr/bin/env python
```

Anyway, no value of stacklevel seemed to provide me with anything useful for .py or .sage files or the IPython console, so we might as well keep it as it is.

The reviewer patch is fine. Still, the example given above by Marco is now disallowed. This one :

```
sage: k.<i> = NumberField(x^2+1)
sage: l.<b> = k.extension(5*x^2 + 3)
sage: c = b + b
sage: c^2 == -12/5
True
sage: c^2 == b
False
