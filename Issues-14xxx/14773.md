In Coxeter groups and Weyl groups, we have the method 'from_reduced_word'.  This method doesn't check that the word is actually reduced.  Removing the 'reduced' would make the name more accurate and save millions of characters of typing over the course of a month, reducing the overall incidence rate of carpal-syndrome in the Sage community, and thus raising the overall productivity of the community at large.

We recommend that 'from_reduced_word' either be deprecated or made to check that the word is reduced, and that 'from_word' be introduced in the relevant categories.
