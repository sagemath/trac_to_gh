Automatically replace

```
sage:
...
...
```
by

```
sage:
....:
....:
```

in all documentation files, since those are changed rarely and we should certainly teach the right thing there. The patch also adds some manual fixes for doctest formatting, including the removal of trailing backslashes in most places.

Maybe eventually we should do this (and then we could also allow doctests whose expected output starts with `...`). But I think it's better to allow for a period where `...` still works but `....:` is encouraged.

I think it would be good to change these doctests. If we disallow the `...` syntax, then we could finally write doctests with expected output starting with ellipsis `...`.

> Well, luckily it should not be too hard to rebase the patches, and it might get less noticed in the middle of the change of workflow.

With some small modifications, the script on this ticket could be used to auto-rebase patches. I could run this script when merging patches and I could also run it on the sage-combinat queue for example. I think that should ease most of the pain.

Well, I very much hope the "..." syntax won't be disallowed right
away: people have a *lot* of .sage files out there which include
doctests. Dropping backward compatibility will force them to update
them at once. Which means they won't be able to share them properly
with other people running older versions of Sage (ok, the files are
still usable, but one won't be able to run the tests; for example to
make sure that everything works fine with all versions in use).

There are also printed or about to be printed *books* that have been
written with this syntax and sagetex. It's useful to be able to test
the examples in those books on various versions of Sage over a non
trivial amount of time.

I appreciate the gain of tests starting with "...:. All our "Traceback
..." lines are kind of silly. But it's really not critical either. We
lived without it for years, we could wait a bit more.

I appreciate the offer! Please take into account that, once rebased,
the patch won't apply anymore on "older" versions of Sage. Well,
unless you duplicate the patch in the queue, with guards, and all the
usual pain of duplication for things that are still evolving.

So as much I could be ok with this change occurring right at the time
the Sage-Combinat queue gets reborn as a git tree (with e.g. the
patches being auto-rebased when they are imported into git). As much I
would oppose a change before that. I guess that means not in any 5.*.

There will be a lot of turmoil ahead for us to handle the
transition. Please don't add yet another hurdle!

Way to go! Or even requesting that any new/changed doctest should use the new syntax right away, like we have been doing for whitespaces and other things.

And hopefuly, once we have switched to the new workflow, merging/rebasing will be much smoother. In that case, large scale changes like the above could become reasonable (which would be good!).
