Well if your goal is to eventually have both proper locking and atomic writing separately then thats fine. But the name should still convey why we are doing that, not how. 

Obviously many Sage developers are not familiar with which file system operations are atomic, so they will rightfully be confused when they see code that writes a cache with `write_via_temp`. Clearly there is an optimization where you take out that extra step ;-)

How about `atomic_write`?
