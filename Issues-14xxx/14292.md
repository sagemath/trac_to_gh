There could be when testing the doctester in parallel. Anyway I have a patch ready but it's on `sage.math` which is currently down.

Not always. Locking has different goals. Locks should be held as short as possible, which cannot be guaranteed (for example when writing the GAP workspace). My solution also solves the problem of exceptions/crashes during the write and it doesn't need any changes to the reading of files.

Obviously many Sage developers are not familiar with which file system operations are atomic, so they will rightfully be confused when they see code that writes a cache with `write_via_temp`. Clearly there is an optimization where you take out that extra step ;-)

How about `atomic_write`?
