Some objects with dynamical classes use `hash(self.__class__)`. Since this is not an invariant of dynamical classes bad things will happen.

One such instance is that, under some circumstances, a WeakValueDictionary remove callback is being called but cannot find the object in the dictionary since the hash changed.

The [attachment: debug_ignored_exceptions.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket14471/debug_ignored_exceptions.patch.gz) is a backport from Python-3.3 to give better diagnosis of ignored exceptions. With it, I get

    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/home/vbraun/opt/sage-5.9.beta5/local/lib/python/weakref.py", line 51, in remove
        del self.data[wr.key]
    KeyError: (((<class 'sage.categories.algebras.Algebras'>, Callable function ring with arguments (x, y)), ()),)

so the KeyError really comes from the WeakValueDictionary remove callback.

`WeakValueDict` is a standard python library class, not one of our own brew. So once we can put the finger on the bug we should likely report upstream. See also #13394, although I doubt the issue pointed out there is what is at play here.

My first guess would be that the cache at play is a "cached_method" or a "cached_function" cache, probably the one from `UniqueRepresentation`, but I'm not entirely sure. The entries in:

```
super(MatrixSpace,sage.matrix.matrix_space.MatrixSpace).__classcall__.get_cache().keys()
```
aren't quite of the shape you're finding.

A quick analysis; This is `WeakValueDictionary.__init__`:

```
    def __init__(self, *args, **kw):
        def remove(wr, selfref=ref(self)):
            self = selfref()
            if self is not None:
                del self.data[wr.key]
        self._remove = remove
        UserDict.UserDict.__init__(self, *args, **kw)
```
As you can see, `remove` only stores a link to the dictionary via a weak reference, so that the dictionary can get deallocated before the callback (and the callback finds that the dict doesn't exist anymore and simply does nothing). So that's correct.

We also see that `remove` *only* removes the key. It doesn't check whether the value is still what it's supposed to be and it also doesn't check if the key is still there in the first place. That would be safe if there's a guarantee that as soon as a value gets removed from the dictionary, the `KeyedRef` gets removed as well (in which case the callback dies without getting executed).

The bug we're seeing indicates that we end up with:
- `weakvaluedict[key]=value`
- `key:KeyedRef(value)` pair gets removed from dict - this *should* more or less atomically destroy the `KeyedRef(value)`.
- somehow, the callback from the `KeyedRef(value)` stored gets called before it gets destroyed.

Since the `KeyedRef(value)`  should really only be referenced from the `weakvaluedict`, it's a bit hard to let it survive: As soon it gets decreffed it should get deallocated.

My guess is that this happens IN cyclic garbage removal, where callbacks do get separated from deletions. Python tries hard to avoid calling such callbacks unnecessarily or in situations where it's unsafe to do so, but perhaps cleaning up extremely complicated cyclic structures (which we do create) could fool the detection.

If this is right, then these keyerrors should be relatively harmless: They would be happening on a dictionary that is slated for demolition anyway. That would suggest we could just catch and ignore the keyerror in the WeakValueDictionary removal function. It would be good to identify the scenario that justifies doing so, however.

If I change the remove() callback to

```
                import sys
                print >> sys.stderr, 'removing', wr.key in self.data.keys()
                del self.data[wr.key]

then I get 

```

    removing True

Replying to [@vbraun](#comment%3A5):
> So the weakvaluedict (self.data) is in a bad state...

`self.data` is a normal dict. Your example doesn't quite show the dict is in a "bad state". It shows that between testing whether the key is in the dict and doing the delete, the key has been removed. That's not quite the same as `self.data` beng corrupted.

Something is going wrong of course, though. Something seems to be mutating self.data in between. The only methods that seem to be mutating the underlying `self.data` for a  `WeakValueDictionary` are `__setitem__`, `popitem`, `pop`, `setdefault`, `update` (and of course `__delitem__` and `clear` it inherits from `UserDict`). Perhaps I don't have enough imagination, but indeed the only scenario in which I could see one of those happening during a callback is when a GC gets triggered and basically the whole dict gets cleaned up.

Some of the "iterator" methods on `WeakValueDict` don't quite seem safe to me, by the way. The `iteritems` method, for instance, iterates over `self.data.itervalues()`, but `self.data` can be mutated outside of your control due to GC callbacks, and iterators over a mutating dict are generally not safe.
I doubt that's what's hurting us here, though.

Fair enough, but even after I catch the KeyError the `wr.key in self.data.keys()` is still `True`. So the `self.data` dict is in a weird place for sure.

I agree that this smells like something else is mutating `self.data` in-between. It is possible that deallocation somewhere triggers a call to `CachedRepresentation`, but I don't see where that would be the case.

> Fair enough, but even after I catch the KeyError the `wr.key in self.data.keys()` is still `True`. So the `self.data` dict is in a weird place for sure.

That is weird, and sounds to me like `self.data` is indeed corrupted. Given that key/value pairs are stored together in a dictionary, it's very hard for this to be true too. Caching the result from data.keys wouldn't make sense at all, so I don't think python will be doing that. Perhaps check that something like `wr.key in self.data` or `self.data.__contains__(wr.key)` returns true and/or if `value=self.data[wr.key]` succeeds (and what kind of value you get back: whether it's `wr`)

That might give you some indication of what exactly is wrong with the entry and hence where the problem might be coming from.

One thing your traceback is confirming:
- There is no GC going on, so callbacks are happening when you think they should.
- Hence there's also not a circular data structure directly involved
- Things are happening during cleanup, so these callbacks are probably indeed happening on a dict that will be deleted too. It's still bad they don't properly execute, of course, but we've seen before that order in cleanup can sometimes lead to subtle problems (i.e., whether things are stored in a cdef attribute or in a conventional dict).

One possible scenario:
- self.data is in the process of being cleared. The dict is actually emptied then before any entries are decreffed (to prevent dict reshaping during deallocation).
- One of the weakreffed values also occurs as a key in the dict (and that's the only strong ref)
- decreffing that key causes the callback, but the callback finds a dict that is now empty, so of course we get a key error.

Your diagnosis that `wr.key in self.data` is still true is not consistent with that, but the scenario indeed leads to ignored keyerrors:

```
import weakref

class A(object):
  def __init__(self,n):
    self.n=n
  def __repr__(self):
    return "A(%d)"%self.n

def mess(n):
  D=weakref.WeakValueDictionary()
  L=[A(i) for i in range(n)]
  for i in range(n-1):
      j=(i+10)%n
      D[L[i]]=L[j]
  return D

D=mess(10000)
D.clear()
```

(how many you ignored keyerrors you get depends a bit on memory layout etc.)

This is definitely a bug in the python library. The problem is that `remove` does check if the dict still exists (via the weakref, which is mainly to ensure that presence of callbacks doesn't extend the life of the dict), but doesn't check if the dict is otherwise in a funny state, such as "in the process of a `clear`".

This is now [Python issue 17816](http://bugs.python.org/issue17816). Python3 does not seem to have this problem and it may not be the problem we're running into here.

I've looked at the Python 3 code and there weakref keeps a separate list of keys to remove to work around this issue.

Any further non-Sage related discussion should probably move to the Python bugtracker.

As for Sage, should we patch Python for this? I hit this bug in #14469 and its likely that we'll trip over it again.

> As for Sage, should we patch Python for this? I hit this bug in #14469 and its likely that we'll trip over it again.

I would suggest a paranoid `remove` function for this:

```
        def remove(wr, selfref=ref(self)):
            self = selfref()
            if self is not None and self.data.get(wr.key) is wr:
                del self.data[wr.key]
```
The `get` method avoids exception handling and hopefully avoids allocation as much as possible (thus avoiding triggering GC) and will return `None` if the reference is not present. Furthermore, we verify that the correct value is still stored in the dictionary, in case a callback gets delayed so much that another value makes it into that dict under the same key (that shouldn't really happen, so that's the paranoid bit).

I tried. Making the test

```
            if self is not None and wr.key in self.data:
```
also makes the error go away (but is less paranoid than the option above), but indeed, making the test

```
            if self is not None and wr.key in self.data.keys():
```
does not!! So there is something wrong with self.data.keys(). Indeed, putting

```
        def remove(wr, selfref=ref(self)):
            self = selfref()
            if self is not None:
                if wr.key in self.data.keys() and wr.key not in self.data:
                    raise RuntimeError("BAD KEY:%s"%(wr.key,))
                del self.data[wr.key]
```
in there makes for "ignored runtime error". On the other hand, if I run the example above with the `BAD KEY` test, I do not get these problems. Therefore, the discrepancy between `in data.keys()` and `in data` does not occur in the example above.

So:
- there is a fix that apparently solves both problems
- there is something different in the problem originally reported here, since `keys()` seems to report an erroneous list.

One difference between `data.keys()` and `__contains__` is that `dictobject.c/dict_keys` just iterates over the table storing the dict and extracts the keys of all dictentries that have a non-NULL value field, whereas `__contains__` will go through a `dictlookup`.
Given that some of the key components may well be in the process of being torn down, could it be that their hash is broken? One would still be able to find the corresponding key by iterating through all of them (as `wr.key in data.keys()` does), but finding it by hash would not work. Both `__contains__` and `__delitem__` would suffer from that.

This could happen if the MRO of some class changed to insert/remove `WithEqualityById` in it. Changing the hash on a key component for which a callback happens would have exactly this effect. So my bet is that it's an artifact of the mro voodoo the dynamical category stuff does or it's an unfortunate clearing/changing of a cached hash value somewhere due to a deletion-in-progress.

This entry is produced by the `__call__` doctest in `matrix0.pyx`:

I think this illustrates the problem rather well:

```
sage: f(x,y) = x^2+y
sage: P=parent(f)
sage: P.__class__
sage.symbolic.callable.CallableSymbolicExpressionRing_class
sage: H=hash(P.__class__)
sage: m = matrix([[f,f*f],[f^3,f^4]])
sage: H == hash(P.__class__)
True
sage: hasattr(m,'a')
False
sage: P.__class__
sage.symbolic.callable.CallableSymbolicExpressionRing_class_with_category
sage: H == hash(P.__class__)
False
```
We have that `P.__hash__` looks like:

```
    def __hash__(self):
        return hash((self.__class__, self._arguments))
```
Obviously, when class is not fixed, it's a bad ingredient for a hash. Given that

```
sage: T=type(P)
sage: [t for t in T.mro() if '__hash__' in t.__dict__]
[sage.symbolic.callable.CallableSymbolicExpressionRing_class,
 sage.symbolic.ring.SymbolicRing,
 sage.structure.category_object.CategoryObject,
 sage.structure.sage_object.SageObject,
 object]
```
we do need to do something about hashing, since `sage.symbolic.ring.SymbolicRing.__hash__` is just a fixed value and these CallableExpression rings do come in different flavours. The `__cmp__` method there also depends on `self.__class__` which should obviously not be relied upon.

Given that this code stems from #5930, it predates these dynamic classes voodoo by quite a bit, so the fact that it doesn't operate well with it is a bug in the dynamic classes stuff. A job for Simon, Nicholas and the gang!

Furthermore, note that `type(parent(m))` inherits from `UniqueRepresentation` but that `type(parent(f))` does not.  It doesn't seem easy to do, but it might be possible to make two equal-but-not-identical callable expression rings. Building matrix rings over them will wreak havoc, because the constructor will use equality testing on the ingredients (and hence return identical matrix rings), but the coercion framework will not honour "equality" between the non-identical base rings.

**EDIT:** The last bit is not the case. `CallableSymbolicExpressionRing` is a `UniqueFactory`. Furthermore, it seems the coercion framework does detect "equal but nonidentical" parent and can sometimes figure out coercions between them.

All tests pass (based on sage-5.11.b3). I think the patch solves the problem in a clean way.

I think one should add a new test to `_refine_category`, demonstrating that the class is *not* changed, if its hash depends on it. I plan to add this in a review patch.

One might argue that any new class (such as `DebugOptions_class`) requires new doctests. But it is just a means to store certain attributes, hence, I think doctests will not be needed in this case.

Unfortunately the patchbot has not finished testing yet. But unless there is a clear regression in startup time, I'll give it a positive review (as soon as I have posted my review patch).

There is no regression in startup time. However, I did not succeed to get the warning when changing the hash. I tried:

```
        Here is a test against :trac:`14471`. Refining the category will issue
        a warning, if this change affects the hash value (note that this will
        only be seen in doctest mode)::

            sage: class MyParent(Parent):
            ....:     def __hash__(self):
            ....:         return hash(type(self))
            ....: 
            sage: a = MyParent(category=Rings())
            sage: h = hash(a)
            sage: a._refine_category_(Algebras(QQ))
            hash of <class '__main__.MyParent_with_category'> changed in Parent._refine_category_
            sage: h == hash(a)
            False
```

If I understand correctly, the check of refine category will by default be done in doctests. But I get:

```
Failed example:
    a._refine_category_(Algebras(QQ))
Expected:
    hash of <class '__main__.MyParent_with_category'> changed in Parent._refine_category_
Got:
    <BLANKLINE>
```

So, what shall one do?
