Equal objects must have the same hash if they are hashable (http://docs.python.org/2/reference/datamodel.html#object.__hash__):

```
sage: my_func = function('func',nargs=1)
sage: f = my_func(0)
sage: bool(f == f.simplify())
True
sage: hash(f) == hash(f.simplify())
False
```
As reported on http://ask.sagemath.org/question/2587/simplify-shenanigans, hash lookup errors then leads to undesirable behavior:

```
sage: ex = my_func(0) + my_func(1)
sage: ex.subs(my_func(0)==1)
func(1) + 1
sage: ex.simplify().subs(my_func(0)==1)
func(0) + func(1)
```

Within Sage it is impossible to satisfy "equal objects must have the same hash if they are hashable" because equality is too laxist.

```
sage: RIF(2) == 2
True
sage: hash(RIF(2))
6400019251
sage: hash(2)
2
```
Or

```
sage: bool(pi == RR(pi))
True
sage: hash(pi)
2650685528
sage: hash(RR(pi))
1826823505
```
You can not hope to solve this problem with one ticket (because the Symbolic ring contains all Sage objects) !

Now that we've decided to sacrifice readability for reducing the chance of name collisions with variables in conversion from SR to maxima:

```
sage: x._maxima_()
_SAGE_VAR_x
```
we could ensure that name translation for functions from SR to maxima is injective as well. Theoretically, we could have

```
sage: function('f')._maxima_()
_SAGE_FUNC_NAME_f
sage: function('f',nargs=1)._maxima_()
_SAGE_FUNC_NARGS_1_NAME_f
```
or something similar. Since LISP uses interned strings for symbols, it wouldn't even be inefficient in the "enhanced" interface to maxima_lib: once the dictionaries are seeded, the strings wouldn't be parsed. The strings-based interface would of course have a bit of a penalty, because it does all kind of regex stuff, so string length actually affects performance (but you'd probably have to work very hard to notice it)
