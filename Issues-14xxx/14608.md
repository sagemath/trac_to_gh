Equal objects must have the same hash if they are hashable (http://docs.python.org/2/reference/datamodel.html#object.__hash__):

```
sage: my_func = function('func',nargs=1)
sage: f = my_func(0)
sage: bool(f == f.simplify())
True
sage: hash(f) == hash(f.simplify())
False
```
As reported on http://ask.sagemath.org/question/2587/simplify-shenanigans, hash lookup errors then leads to undesirable behavior:

```
sage: ex = my_func(0) + my_func(1)
sage: ex.subs(my_func(0)==1)
func(1) + 1
sage: ex.simplify().subs(my_func(0)==1)
func(0) + func(1)
```

Within Sage it is impossible to satisfy "equal objects must have the same hash if they are hashable" because equality is too laxist.

```
sage: RIF(2) == 2
True
sage: hash(RIF(2))
6400019251
sage: hash(2)
2
```
Or

```
sage: bool(pi == RR(pi))
True
sage: hash(pi)
2650685528
sage: hash(RR(pi))
1826823505
```
You can not hope to solve this problem with one ticket (because the Symbolic ring contains all Sage objects) !

Now that we've decided to sacrifice readability for reducing the chance of name collisions with variables in conversion from SR to maxima:

```
sage: x._maxima_()
_SAGE_VAR_x
```
we could ensure that name translation for functions from SR to maxima is injective as well. Theoretically, we could have

```
sage: function('f')._maxima_()
_SAGE_FUNC_NAME_f
sage: function('f',nargs=1)._maxima_()
_SAGE_FUNC_NARGS_1_NAME_f
```
or something similar. Since LISP uses interned strings for symbols, it wouldn't even be inefficient in the "enhanced" interface to maxima_lib: once the dictionaries are seeded, the strings wouldn't be parsed. The strings-based interface would of course have a bit of a penalty, because it does all kind of regex stuff, so string length actually affects performance (but you'd probably have to work very hard to notice it)

It seems to me that the hash issue mentioned in the ticket description has been fixed since at least Sage 9.1. In particular, in Sage 9.1 and Sage 9.3.beta8, we have

```
sage: my_func = function('func',nargs=1)                                                            
sage: f = my_func(0)                                                                                
sage: bool(f == f.simplify())
