The word crystallographic should be spelled with two "l".

The spelling with one "l" is very rare.

<a id='comment:2'></a>Hi Frédéric,

While I definitely see this as a worthwhile improvement, one will need to devise a plan for:

- maintaining backward compatibility, with appropriate deprecation, for some time
- making sure that this does not conflict with too many patches outthere

Cheers,
                       Nicolas

I don't think this will break much, if anything, in the queue. I'll try this out later tonight and can do the review then too.

Best,

Travis

<a id='comment:7'></a>Hi Frédéric!

Thanks for fixing this original typo of mine :-)

I went through the patch and am happy with it up to two details:

- Unless I missed it, there lacks a backward compatibility alias for CartanType.samples(crystalographic=True).

- It would be good to add tests for the backward compatibility aliases.
