### mpir-2.6.0.p2 (Leif Leonhardy, April 3rd 2013)
* #14399: MPIR 2.6.0's test suite fails with GCC 4.8.0
  Rather surprisingly, this bug, now causing a segfault in MPIR's test suite,
  apparently never showed up before.
  Add patch (`mpz__t-scan-bugfix.patch`) fixing an invalid array access in
  the test code.
  Patch has been submitted upstream.
