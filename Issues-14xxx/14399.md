### mpir-2.6.0.p2 (Leif Leonhardy, April 3rd 2013)
* #14399: MPIR 2.6.0's test suite fails with GCC 4.8.0
  Rather surprisingly, this bug, now causing a segfault in MPIR's test suite,
  apparently never showed up before.
  Add patch (`mpz__t-scan-bugfix.patch`) fixing an invalid array access in
  the test code.
  Patch has been submitted upstream.

Thanks.  I guess using GCC 4.8 will become less "unusual" soon.  (Ubuntu tends to incorporate patches from later versions into their "previous" GCC versions anyway, and as mentioned, it's rather surprising this long-lasting bug never caused problems before.
