Ok, I've put up four different patches which should achieve the same goal :
* the uname, echo and sed version make minimal changes by modifying UNAME on Cygwin only using the corresponding command to detect we are on Cygwin (uname was suggested by Jeroen on #14406, echo avoid recalling uname, sed is what is used in sage/bin/sage-env to modify UNAME on Cygwin)
* the case version does not modify UNAME but replace the if/elif/elif/.../else construction used to filter OSes by a case statement.

This last one is my preferred one, but I'll let Jeroen decide.

I tested it on Linux, Cygwin and Solaris this time, so the patches should be fine.

This still works fine on Linux and Cygwin.

Just a remark about SunOS release filtering.
According to Wikipedia, there are 4.1.x releases and a 5.5.1 whence the filtering I used, i.e. only keep 5.1[0-9]* thinking that would be enough for the next decade unless Oracle decides to go for 6.x.
But I guess nobody will ever try to build Sage on 4.1.x or 5.5.1 so it's not that problematic.
Not even sure more than a couple of people actually build it for actual usage on 5.10 and 5.11...

And I guess there is a spurious space at the end of

```
export UNAME=`uname | sed 's/CYGWIN.*/CYGWIN/' ` 
```
