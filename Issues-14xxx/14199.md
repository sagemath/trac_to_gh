-Installing and using SageTeX
-============================
+.. nodoctest

-SageTeX is a system for embedding computations and plots from Sage into
-LaTeX documents. It is included by default with Sage, so if you have
-installed Sage, you already have SageTeX. However, to get it to work,
-you need to make TeX aware of SageTeX. Instructions for that are in the
-"Make SageTeX known to TeX" section of the `Sage installation guide
-<http://sagemath.org/doc/installation/index.html>`_ (`this link
-<../../installation/index.html>`_ should take you to a local copy of the
-installation guide).
+.. _sagetex:
+
+MISSING TITLE
+=============
+
+.. This file has been autogenerated.
+
+
+.. automodule:: sagetex
+   :members:
+   :undoc-members:
+   :show-inheritance:
+
+
```
If this an autogenerated file, it should not be tracked by Mercurial. And why did all content get removed?

Making the file `sagetex.rst` unwritable shows where the file is written:

```

I don't remember, it was on a buildbot machine (`bsd.math`), but I guess it was a build from scratch. On `bsd.math` look for `/Users/buildbot/sage-5.8.beta2-14199.tar.bz2` which is a build with this problem.
