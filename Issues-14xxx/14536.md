`digraphs.Tournament` use to return a transitive tournament. I have no idea why I named it "tournament", as there is a wealth of tournaments on `n` vertices. Hence I rename it in this patch. I think that it does not need to be deprecated first, because the former name really is ill-adapted, and because the patch that added it was merged three months ago only. Let's not keep this bad name for another year.

The segfault is rather shameful... `:-P`

Yo,

I just had a look, and it sounds very reasonnable.

Three details:

- Why not displaying anymore the number of vertices in the name method of TransitiveTournament? Since other graphs do the same that would be consistent.

- A potential alternative name would be "chain"

- In the tournament generator using Nauty, once the nauty command is constructed, it seems that all the rest is generic (calling Nauty, parsing the output, building and yielding the graphs). What about extracting this into a generic function?

In the long run, it would be nice to have a uniform interface for generating graphs using either Sage's engine or nauty (say with an algo=nauty/Sage optional switch, which would default to Sage, unless nauty become a standard package some day.).

Cheers,
                                       Nicolas

Hellooooooo !!

> - Why not displaying anymore the number of vertices in the name method of TransitiveTournament? Since other graphs do the same that would be consistent.

Well. This is the result with the patch as it is :

```
sage: digraphs.TransitiveTournament(5)
Transitive Tournament: Digraph on 5 vertices
```

If the number of vertices is included in the name, you get "Transitive Tournament on 5 vertices: Digraph on 5 vertices".

> - A potential alternative name would be "chain"

For what ? Transitive tournament ? `O_o`

Hey, it's not a Poset ! It's a digraph ! `:-P`

Plus it would really make people think of this :

```
sage: digraphs.Path(5)
Path on 5 vertices: Digraph on 5 vertices
```

Oh, by the way the name contains the number of vertices in this case. What do you think ?

> - In the tournament generator using Nauty, once the nauty command is constructed, it seems that all the rest is generic (calling Nauty, parsing the output, building and yielding the graphs). What about extracting this into a generic function?

Nauty is not a part of Sage because of license problems... And it knows how to enumerate things that are not implemented in Sage yet (like hypergraphs `:-PPP`).

It goes in both directions, though. It is easy to enumerate through Sage the list of graphs satisfying some specific property, and the property is actually tested *during* the enumeration. No way to do this with Nauty, unless we *REALLY* rewrite the interface and call Nauty's C functions directly `:-P`

I see. It would be consistent to fix Circuit then:

```
	sage: digraphs.Circuit(5)
	Circuit on 5 vertices: Digraph on 5 vertices
```

But that can be for later.

Fair enough :-)

Yup. Still it would be nice if there was a single entry point for
both generators, even if some features only work in one case.

Brendan McKay is like MY own personnal Chuck Nurris.
He is right.
But perhaps he can decide that licensing his software under the GPL would be even greater. We would not convince him to do that, of course, but he could decide it by himself. And this would not be related in any way with our emails.
Of course.

He chose the license for Nauty a while ago. In the mean time the world
of software as evolved quite some. It can be useful to him to have
feedback on what can be helpful to us and to the math open source
community at large nowadays. And then he can take whatever informed decision he wants. He is the author anyway.
