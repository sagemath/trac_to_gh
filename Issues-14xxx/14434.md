<a id='comment:7'>**Comment 7:**</a>
I update a patch with several corrections in the documentation. If you are happy, make it positive review.

Two curiosities:

I just learn that for verbosity, there is `sage.misc.misc.verbose`.

Why

```
[v for v in self if p.get_values(b[v]) < .5]
```
instead of

```
[v for v in self if p.get_values(b[v]) == 0.]
```

`>_<`

Yeah... Right `>_<`

Pretty good idea... But this will require a LARGE patch `:-PPPPPP`

I have one thousand different functions with a verbosity level, though most of them are LP-related. I wonder if it's a good idea to have a global function to do that rather than a flag for each function... HMmmmmmm `O_o`

Because this is old code, written before integer values were automatically rounded. I will update this in a second.
