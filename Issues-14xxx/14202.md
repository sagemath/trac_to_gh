On some systems (including but not limited to Cygwin), there is a bash "`time`" keyword but no `time` command.

This is problematic in sage/interfaces/qsieve.py (see `optional - time`) doctests.

Try this:

```
sage: ?walltime
Type:       function
String Form:<function walltime at 0xb9d488>
File:       /usr/local/src/sage-5.7.beta1/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/misc/misc.py
Definition: walltime(t=0)
Docstring:
   Return the wall time in second, or with optional argument t, return
   the wall time since time t. "Wall time" means the time on a wall
   clock, i.e., the actual time.

   INPUT:

   * "t" - (optional) float, time in CPU seconds

   OUTPUT:

   * "float" - time in seconds

   EXAMPLES:

      sage: w = walltime()
      sage: F = factor(2^199-1)
      sage: walltime(w)   # somewhat random
      0.8823847770690918
```
