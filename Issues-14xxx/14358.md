When a Sage notebook server needs to create a static 3D image, it runs JMol server-side to create this image (if Java is available). However, it does this inside a directory to which the worker process might not have access to.

**Old report** (before we diagnosed the problem):

We have been running the sage worksheets as an unprivileged user. The setup is as follows.

1. A user, say user1, starts the sage server using

```
sage -n port=8888 accounts=True interface='' server_pool=['sagenb@localhost'] openid=True automatic_login=False port_tries=0 directory=/home/user1/a.sagenb
```
2. Because of the server_pool command, any worksheet is opened as an unprivileged user called *sagenb*. Here is some more info on how to set up the environment.
   1. Create user sagenb by doing (as root)

```
$ groupadd sagenb
$ useradd -g sagenb -m sagenb
```
2. Create a ssh key for user1

```
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa # run as user1 and make it passwordless
```
3. Copy the id_rsa.pub to `~sagenb/.ssh/authorized_keys`.

```
$ cp -a ~user1/.ssh/id_rsa.pub /tmp/authorized_keys # Run as user1
$ mkdir ~sagenb/.ssh # Run as sagenb
$ cp /tmp/authorized_keys .ssh # Run as sagenb
```
3. With default sage-5.2 there is no problem with this and everything works.
4. With sage-5.2 + "#13121 without new jmol", jmol works but one needs to close the worksheet and then reopen the worksheet and then the jmol pops up.
5. With sage-5.2 + #13121, jmol works partially:
   1. First, the static image can not be created and there is a permission denied error. See [attachment: permission_error.jpg](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket14358/permission_error.jpg).
   2. However, once the 3D output is toggled, jmol loads fine. The permission denied error is still there.
   3. The error obtained is of the form

```
script ERROR: script ERROR: io error reading
/home/user1/a.sagenb/home/__store__/0/09/098/098f/te\
st/0/cells/7/sage0-size500-499889951.jmol.zip|SCRIPT:
java.io.FileNotFoundException:
/home/user1/a.sagenb/home/__store__/0/09/098/098f/te\
st/0/cells/7/sage0-size500-499889951.jmol.zip (Permission denied)
Sleeping...Make Interactive
```
6. When run locally, i.e., without server_pool, the jmol loads and runs fine. For instance, this is fine:

```
sage -n directory=a.sagenb
```

This problem has made it difficult for me to upgrade a server from 5.2 and I think the error is introduced by some change in jmol. The error itself stems from some java component. A diff of the changes between the directory `$SAGE_ROOT/devel/sagenb/sagenb/data/sage3d` for sage-5.2 and sage-5.7.rc0 has not yielded any difference. So, I believe the difference is really in the jmol spkg introduced in #12299.

I have traced it back and reproduced it in sage-5.2 + new notebook + new jmol. Although I wrote sage-5.2 above, the error is present in all the sage versions I have tried - sage-5.4 till sage-5.9.beta0.

> I haven't done anything to the way Jmol is set up, although somebody else might have.  The error actually looks like the errors associated with Jmol running in a web page and directly accessing local resources without a server.  In that case all files accessed must be below Jmol in the directory tree to satisfy Java security requirements.  Another possibility is that somebody has changed the way files are created in the notebook and Jmol can no longer find the files.

The permissions in the worksheet directories haven't changed. They are the same as the worksheets from two years ago.

>   A third possibility relates to MacOS and Windows having become so Java in browsers unfriendly that they mess up file access as well.   A pure javascript (although slower) alternative is in the works to deal with the Java in browsers problem.

All these problems were replicated on Linux - Debian-6 and Gentoo, both 64bits. Also, the bug was found with sage-5.2 + new notebook + new jmol, and not with vanilla sage-5.2. sage-5.4 onwards already have the new notebook and jmol and so all of them exhibit this bug.
 
> Unfortunately, I do not have time to look at this particular problem in detail now.  Maybe later this week.

There is no immediate rush. I have held up the upgrade for two months now and have been able to pinpoint the (hopefully) exact reason only now. Just wanted to bring this bug to your attention.

jmol files for the image are stored in some cell directory with permissions 0700 for the server user, thus worker processes cannot get access to them.

This is not the problem. Or, at least, it wasn't the problem before sage-5.4. The permissions have always been 0700 (belonging to the server user), and it has remained the same for years. I am not sure how it worked earlier, but it did use to work.

The problem is the the worker processes may be restricted in their users and groups - for instance I have been running a server using sagenb:sagenb as the user/group for the worker process, and this user belongs to no other groups, and no other user shares this group sagenb.

If the change is only in granting of permissions, then the server user should have the same group as the worker and the permissions should be probably 0740 or 0750.

```
Sage Version 5.12, Release Date: 2013-10-07
```
I am using the patch from #11679, but I don't see how that could make a difference.

Notebook started with

```
server_pool = ['worker@sage3', 'worker@sage4']
ulimit='-v 1200000 -t 86400'


# Import sage library
from sage.all_cmdline import *

notebook(
        port=8081,
        secure=False,
        accounts=False,
        automatic_login=False,
        quiet=True,
        timeout=3600*3,
        ulimit=ulimit,
        server_pool=server_pool)
```

The workers most certainly do not have access to the server's `.sage` directory (it can even be on a different machine!) but JMol works...

Since we want the `server_pool` thing to keep working, changing permissions is not the right solution, since you should assume that the workers can only access `/tmp` (or whatever temporary directory you choose with #11679).

I just ran an `strace` on the worker process and there is only one point where it even tries to access the `.sage` directory (called `dotsage` in my case):

```
open("/home/sagenb/dotsage/sage_notebook.sagenb/home/J.Demeyer/197/data/c_lib.pyx", O_RDONLY) = -1 EACCES (Permission denied)
```
(this is because that directory is added to `sys.path` of the worker, see `sagenb/notebook/worksheet.py`, see #3844)

The worker creates a `jmol.zip` file:

```
open("sage0-size500-863868640.jmol.zip", O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC, 0666) = 3
```
but it does so after

```
chdir("/var/sage/tmpmJfHuO")            = 0
```
(`/var/sage` plays the role of `/tmp` in my setup and is shared between the server and the workers).

The [strace output](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket14358/sagenb_strace.log) here shows that it tries to create the jmol file in some other directory. I am trying to understand if that directory is in `/home/sagenb` or in the "dotsage" directory of the server process.

The change to `fg` should be kept. I do not understand why it was set so low at `fg=2`. The default image size seems to be not `fg=2` but rather `fg=5`. The change is needed to ensure that the java process does not run out of memory. For example `cube(figsize=40)` returns a memory error from jmol now.

That was already the case, it's not because of my patch.

> Do you plan to include the fix in 5.13? Or, do you want to make a git patch out of it?

I haven't decided. It looks a pretty safe patch, which isn't going to break anything else and only affects the notebook.

Oops. Sorry. I read and re-read it several times, but failed to notice that it was commented code. That explains why the default size was 5 - I was wondering why that if statement wasn't getting executed.

Then, the patch looks good to me. It is up to you if you want to include it in 5.13 or later.
