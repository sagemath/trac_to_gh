When a Sage notebook server needs to create a static 3D image, it runs JMol server-side to create this image (if Java is available). However, it does this inside a directory to which the worker process might not have access to.

**Old report** (before we diagnosed the problem):

We have been running the sage worksheets as an unprivileged user. The setup is as follows.

1. A user, say user1, starts the sage server using

```
sage -n port=8888 accounts=True interface='' server_pool=['sagenb@localhost'] openid=True automatic_login=False port_tries=0 directory=/home/user1/a.sagenb
```
2. Because of the server_pool command, any worksheet is opened as an unprivileged user called *sagenb*. Here is some more info on how to set up the environment.
   1. Create user sagenb by doing (as root)

```
$ groupadd sagenb
$ useradd -g sagenb -m sagenb
```
2. Create a ssh key for user1

```
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa # run as user1 and make it passwordless
```
3. Copy the id_rsa.pub to `~sagenb/.ssh/authorized_keys`.

```
$ cp -a ~user1/.ssh/id_rsa.pub /tmp/authorized_keys # Run as user1
$ mkdir ~sagenb/.ssh # Run as sagenb
$ cp /tmp/authorized_keys .ssh # Run as sagenb
```
3. With default sage-5.2 there is no problem with this and everything works.
4. With sage-5.2 + "#13121 without new jmol", jmol works but one needs to close the worksheet and then reopen the worksheet and then the jmol pops up.
5. With sage-5.2 + #13121, jmol works partially:
   1. First, the static image can not be created and there is a permission denied error. See [attachment:permission_error.jpg](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket14358/permission_error.jpg).
   2. However, once the 3D output is toggled, jmol loads fine. The permission denied error is still there.
   3. The error obtained is of the form

```
script ERROR: script ERROR: io error reading
/home/user1/a.sagenb/home/__store__/0/09/098/098f/te\
st/0/cells/7/sage0-size500-499889951.jmol.zip|SCRIPT:
java.io.FileNotFoundException:
/home/user1/a.sagenb/home/__store__/0/09/098/098f/te\
st/0/cells/7/sage0-size500-499889951.jmol.zip (Permission denied)
Sleeping...Make Interactive
```
6. When run locally, i.e., without server_pool, the jmol loads and runs fine. For instance, this is fine:

```
sage -n directory=a.sagenb
```

This problem has made it difficult for me to upgrade a server from 5.2 and I think the error is introduced by some change in jmol. The error itself stems from some java component. A diff of the changes between the directory `$SAGE_ROOT/devel/sagenb/sagenb/data/sage3d` for sage-5.2 and sage-5.7.rc0 has not yielded any difference. So, I believe the difference is really in the jmol spkg introduced in #12299.

I have traced it back and reproduced it in sage-5.2 + new notebook + new jmol. Although I wrote sage-5.2 above, the error is present in all the sage versions I have tried - sage-5.4 till sage-5.9.beta0.

The permissions in the worksheet directories haven't changed. They are the same as the worksheets from two years ago.

I think group should have read/execute permission too, not sure about write. I tried to change it manually before in the filesystem, but doing anything with the worksheet would revert it to user-only, so I couldn't test if it works. If you know where to do the changes in Sage code - please do!

This is not the problem. Or, at least, it wasn't the problem before sage-5.4. The permissions have always been 0700 (belonging to the server user), and it has remained the same for years. I am not sure how it worked earlier, but it did use to work.

The problem is the the worker processes may be restricted in their users and groups - for instance I have been running a server using sagenb:sagenb as the user/group for the worker process, and this user belongs to no other groups, and no other user shares this group sagenb.

If the change is only in granting of permissions, then the server user should have the same group as the worker and the permissions should be probably 0740 or 0750.

For the record using 5.12.beta4: it is possible to descend through "cells" directory, but numbered directories for each cell and files within are only accessible by the server user.

Meanwhile Java's appetite grew and it is not satisfied with 5Gb ulimit on virtual memory (10Gb was enough).

 Linux sage4 3.2.1-gentoo-r2 #15 SMP Tue May 15 10:40:50 CEST 2012 x86_64 Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU X5660 @ 2.80GHz GenuineIntel GNU/Linux
```

```
Sage Version 5.12, Release Date: 2013-10-07
```
I am using the patch from #11679, but I don't see how that could make a difference.

Notebook started with

```
server_pool = ['worker@sage3', 'worker@sage4']
ulimit='-v 1200000 -t 86400'


# Import sage library
from sage.all_cmdline import *

notebook(
        port=8081,
        secure=False,
        accounts=False,
        automatic_login=False,
        quiet=True,
        timeout=3600*3,
        ulimit=ulimit,
        server_pool=server_pool)
```

The workers most certainly do not have access to the server's `.sage` directory (it can even be on a different machine!) but JMol works...

Since we want the `server_pool` thing to keep working, changing permissions is not the right solution, since you should assume that the workers can only access `/tmp` (or whatever temporary directory you choose with #11679).

I just ran an `strace` on the worker process and there is only one point where it even tries to access the `.sage` directory (called `dotsage` in my case):

```
open("/home/sagenb/dotsage/sage_notebook.sagenb/home/J.Demeyer/197/data/c_lib.pyx", O_RDONLY) = -1 EACCES (Permission denied)
```
(this is because that directory is added to `sys.path` of the worker, see `sagenb/notebook/worksheet.py`, see #3844)

The worker creates a `jmol.zip` file:

```
open("sage0-size500-863868640.jmol.zip", O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC, 0666) = 3
```
but it does so after

```
chdir("/var/sage/tmpmJfHuO")            = 0
```
(`/var/sage` plays the role of `/tmp` in my setup and is shared between the server and the workers).

Please see #7771 with respect to the R doctest issue.  I'd rather have that issue fixed there than here.

By the way, apparently it wasn't obvious before that a doctest shouldn't try to install a package... but this fix is fine too, though it's not always clear what R will output (see #7771 reviewer patch and discussion).

Oops. Sorry. I read and re-read it several times, but failed to notice that it was commented code. That explains why the default size was 5 - I was wondering why that if statement wasn't getting executed.
