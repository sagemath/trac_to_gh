Oh, I thought that was somehow abstractly packed to allow arbitrarily long rows..

Anyways, I think the main reason this is not faster is that we first need to build the matrix and then do the checking...

Hmmm... Yeah, probably. It would be nice to have instances in which the algorithm really has `n^3` complexity.

....

Stupid guy. Ok, I'll give it a try on a complete bipartite graph `:-P`

```
sage: g = graphs.CompleteBipartiteGraph(200,200)       
sage: %time g.is_triangle_free()

sage: %time g.is_triangle_free(algorithm="dense_graph")
CPU times: user 0.18 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.18 s
Wall time: 0.18 s
True
```

I really like to have access to a thing as basic as an array of "long" fields, though. But we could definitely has something similar, at a slightly higher level. An array of Python bitsets ?...

The problem of this data structure is addition/removal of vertices.
