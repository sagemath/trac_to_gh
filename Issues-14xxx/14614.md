Hmmm... Yeah, probably. It would be nice to have instances in which the algorithm really has `n^3` complexity.

....

Stupid guy. Ok, I'll give it a try on a complete bipartite graph `:-P`

```
sage: g = graphs.CompleteBipartiteGraph(200,200)       
sage: %time g.is_triangle_free()

Wall time: 0.69 s
True
sage: %time g.is_triangle_free(algorithm="dense_graph")
CPU times: user 0.18 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.18 s
Wall time: 0.18 s
True
```

I really like to have access to a thing as basic as an array of "long" fields, though. But we could definitely has something similar, at a slightly higher level. An array of Python bitsets ?...

The problem of this data structure is addition/removal of vertices.
