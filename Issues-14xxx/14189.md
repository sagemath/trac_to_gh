The modular degree of m an elliptic curve is defined as the degree of the map from X_0(N) down to E, when N is the conductor of E. See [Agashe/Ribet/Stein's paper: The Modular Degree, Congruence Primes and Multiplicity One](http://wstein.org/papers/ars-congruence/current.pdf).

The congruence number for E is defined as the largest integer r such that there exists a cusp form of level N that is orthogonal to the cusp form attached to E w.r.t. the Petersson inner product, but congruent to it modulo r.

One of the major results known connecting the two values is that for elliptic curves over QQ, the modular degree divides the congruence number.

Both of these invariants generalize to higher level. Maps also exist from X_0(M*N) down to E for any positive integer M, so one can define modular degrees for any multiple of N. Likewise, we can ask, for any M*N, what the largest integer r is such that the space of cusp forms at level M*N forms generated by E for which mod r congruences exist between orthogonal cusp forms of level M*N.

This enhancement would allow us to compute the generalized notions of modular degree and congruence modulus and investigate whether divisibility still holds.
