This patch allows  to produce PGF/TikZ output than can than be included in LaTeX documents. It is based on the new pgf backend included in matplotlib-1.2+. 

The backend still has some issues that cripple this patch:
* the first time that it is run it produce this warning:

```
sage: line([(0,0), (1,1)],axes=False).save("/tmp/sage.pgf")
/opt/sage/sage-5.10.rc2/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/matplotlib/tight_bbox.py:55: UserWarning: bbox_inches option for pgf backend is not implemented yet. 
"implemented yet." % (format))
```

* closing sage after using save() give this other error:

```
Exception AttributeError: "'NoneType' object has no attribute 'isdir'" in <bound method LatexManager.__del__ of <matplotlib.backends.backend_pgf.LatexManager instance at 0x7d375a8>> ignored
```

* finally not all the graphics primitives can be plotted at the moment: printing some text() will trigger 

```
RuntimeError: Cannot get window extent w/o renderer
```

This doesn't apply cleanly to Sage 5.11.beta3. I would recommend *not* making all of the white space changes: it makes your patch much more likely to lead to conflicts.

Sorry for the issue with the last patch: I was working on 5.10. I also followed your advice on spaces.

I clicked on attach file twice so now there are two copies of the patch; is there a way to remove one of them.

Yes, I could delete one of them, or both (as I can't rename attachments, so you could afterwards reupload your current patch without a sequence number).

Next time make sure you check the "replace existing bla" box, then the attachment will get updated.

Simply speaking, the `__del__` method is doing too much at a critical moment.

I don't know the appropriate way of dealing with this (bug?). Should it be dealt in Sage or at upstream?

Looks good to me too. 

What do you mean by "view"?

It should return the pgf/latex code so the behavior remains consistent.

Also you have to do some setup for tikz code:

```python
from sage.graphs.graph_latex import setup_latex_preamble
setup_latex_preamble()
```
That could be why `view` is broken.

<a id='comment:39'></a>
Dear All,
thank you for dealing with this while I had not sage to play with. 
I am back at it now and I agree with the changes made so far. 

One thing I am not convinced of is how the output of `view` looks like: the
figure is all squashed to the right side. 

A possible fix to this is to enclose the output of `latex()` into a
`\makebox[\textwidth]{` `}`.  This unfortunately creates some problem with latex
itself. Somehow if we put things inside a `\makebox` environment then latex
complains about undefined control sequence `\pgfsys`. The latex code works
perfectly without the `\makebox`. To replicate this do as follows:

With the current code

```
sage: c = plot(sin(x))
sage: view(c)
```
works but the figure is all squashed to the right.

Apply this patch then and try again

```
diff --git a/src/sage/misc/latex.py b/src/sage/misc/latex.py
index de63252..ee62c3e 100644

             else:
                 s += '%s'%L
```

```
sage: c = plot(sin(x))
sage: view(c) #fails with undefined control sequence \pgfsys
sage: c._show_axes = False
sage: view(c) #works and places the figure nicely
```
Apparently the issue is with the axes.

To get the code that sages tries to compile you can do

```
sage: from sage.misc.latex import _latex_file_
sage: s = _latex_file_(latex(c))
sage: f = open('/tmp/sage.tex','w'); f.write(s); f.close()
```

Any idea on how to tackle this?

One more issue (this, I think, is a bug upstream):

```
sage: c = text('Hello World!',(1,0))
sage: latex(c)
...
IOError: [Errno 32] Broken pipe
```

It would be nice if the poseidon buildbot would come around to this ticket again, but the test will get skipped unless someone specifically adds `latex` to the optional flags. So based on this fact and this [sage-devel thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/K1xtiWcNjvw), I'm going to set this back to a positive review.
