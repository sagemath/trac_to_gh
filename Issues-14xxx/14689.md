I was trying to build sage 5.10.rc0 on a brand new box, and failed to build because the atlas spkg doesn't fall back to anything if 'fast' doesn't work.

Ok, I have tried to use the erratum to get around the issue and go further ; indeed I manage to compile quite a few things afterwards, but matplotlib fails because numpy doesn't work:

```
ImportError: /home/jpuydt/sage-5.10.rc1/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/numpy/linalg/lapack_lite.so: undefined symbol: dpotrf_
```
and the reason it doesn't work can only be found in numpy's log:

```
    Lapack library (from ATLAS) is probably incomplete:
      size of /home/jpuydt/sage-5.10.rc1/local/lib/liblapack.so is 215k (expected >4000k)
```
I'll try to find out if the problem comes from:
1. the upstream workaround not being complete ;
2. my own repackaging of said workaround

I had issues with ATLAS not building LAPACK on Solaris because it used the non POSIX -r option, but we patch that, so the reason is elsewhere...

I'll give it a shot on an ARM devboard, but I fear it will be in two weeks from now...

I could try on a Raspberry Pi inbetween but that will surely take as long to fail :)

Could you post ATLAS log obtained after using the upstream workaround.

From your posts I understand the spkg built successfully (or said so at least).
