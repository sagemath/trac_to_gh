The unique representation of homsets is taken care of by ``Hom``. What's missing is:

- Fast hash and comparison by id. This can be implemented by having Homset inherit from WithEqualityById 
- Pickling by construction, calling back Hom(domain, codomain, category)

Observation: If one uses `WithEqualityById`, many tests in sage.modular and sage.schemes fail with unprintable assertion errors.

We need to discuss whether we "simply" fix them, or better continue to compare homsets by *equality* (not identity) of domain and codomain.

In other words, we might end up with just providing a default pickling for homsets, which is currently missing.

Just a crazy idea (brain storm):

We do not want `WithEqualityById` by default, because it makes no sense to have Homset be a unique parent, if domain and codomain are no unique parents.

However, if both domain and codomain are unique parents, it *is* a good idea to use `WithEqualityById`.

So, we could check whether both domain and codomain inherit from `UniqueRepresentation`. If they do, then they are unique parents, and then we could create a dynamic class out of `WithEqualityById` and the class of the homset, and overload the `__class__` of the homset.

In that way, we would automatically have fast homset comparison and hash, for those parts of sage that use unique representation.

I am running tests with an according patch now...

No, I did not find the solution.

The problem seems to be that the modular symbols space M is pickled the *OLD* python way, hence, its `__dict__` is pickled. When M is unpickled, some homspace accessible from an attribute of M is unpickled. Codomain and domain of this homspace happen to be M --- and if the Hom function is called with an uninitialised version of M, then stuff fails.

Solution: Provide a "proper" pickling for modular symbols.
Problem: I don't understand the modular symbols code.

If I recall correctly, people do explicitly not want to use a cache (such as: `UniqueRepresentation`) on modular symbols. They have some cache, but make a point of being able to disable it.

Here is a minimal example, that fails when using a proper `__reduce__` method for homsets:

```
            sage: sage.modular.hecke.morphism.is_HeckeModuleMorphism_matrix(ModularSymbols(6).hecke_operator(7).matrix_form().hecke_module_morphism())
            True
            sage: M = ModularSymbols(6)
            sage: t = M.Hom(M)(matrix(QQ,3,3,srange(9)), name="spam"); t
            Hecke module morphism spam defined by the matrix
            [0 1 2]
            [3 4 5]
            [6 7 8]
            Domain: Modular Symbols space of dimension 3 for Gamma_0(6) of weight ...
            Codomain: Modular Symbols space of dimension 3 for Gamma_0(6) of weight ...
            sage: t == loads(dumps(t))
            True
```
The first line actually is important. With the first line, we get this error in the last line:

Here is the problem and a potential solution.

While unpickling of the modular symbols M, we need to construct a homset with domain and codomain M. At this point, calling M.category() results in an error, since M.base() returns None and M.category() wants to return Modules(M.base()).

Hence, in the code of the Hom function from sage.categories.homset, the lines

```python
            cat_X = X.category()
            cat_Y = Y.category()
```
crash.

The point is: When Hom is called in the process of unpickling a homset, then the correct category is supplied. Hence, the argument "category" of Hom is not None. And I think if in this situation `X.category()` raises an error then we can simply ignore the error and skip the consistency check `cat_X.is_subcategory(category)`.

Hence, I'd do:

```
    if category is None:
        category = X.category()._meet_(Y.category())
        # Recurse to make sure that Hom(X, Y) and Hom(X, Y, category) are identical
        H = Hom(X, Y, category)
    else:
        # while unpickling, it is possible that the
        # categories of X and Y are not initialised
        # and a default category can't be determined.
        # Since cat_X/Y.is_subcategory(category) is just
        # a sanity check anyway, we will ignore an error
        # that is raised when determining cat_X/cat_Y
        if not isinstance(category, Category):
            raise TypeError, "Argument category (= %s) must be a category."%category
        try:
            cat_X = X.category()
        except BaseException:
            cat_X = category
        try:
            cat_Y = Y.category()
        except BaseException:
            cat_Y = category
        if not cat_X.is_subcategory(category):
            raise TypeError, "%s is not in %s"%(X, category)
        if not cat_Y.is_subcategory(category):
            raise TypeError, "%s is not in %s"%(Y, category)

        # Construct H
        try: # _Hom_ hook from the parent
            H = X._Hom_(Y, category)
...
```

Do you think this is a feasible idea?

I don't know if it is valid, but at least it is easily possible to get None:

```
sage: Parent().base() is None
True
```

> At this point, is there enough information available on `M` to derive what `base()` should return?


I don't think so---unless modular symbols are *always* defined over the rationals. That's not my field of mathematical expertise.

> In that case, I'd think the cleanest way would be to make `base()` a caching routine: return a stored value if available and otherwise derive the correct value, store it, and return that.

`base` is usually set when you call `Parent.__init__`.

Anyway. If it is really the case that the base of modular symbols will always be the rational field, then it is fine.

Simon

Perhaps the following idea works and is clean.

What does Python currently do when unpickling a modular symbol? Well, it creates a new instance of the underlying class, and fills its `__dict__`.

I guess it is possible to compute the base ring from the contents of the `__dict__` (need to find out how, but I am sure it is encoded there somewhere. Indeed, we have

```
sage: M = ModularSymbols(6)
sage: M._ModularSymbolsSpace__character.base_ring()
Rational Field
sage: M.base()
Rational Field
```

And that means, we could create an unpickling function doing the following, where dct is the `__dict__` and cls is the class of the modular symbol to be unpickled:

```python
    M = cls.__new__(cls)
    ParentWithAdditiveAbelianGens.__init__(M,base=dct['_ModularSymbolsSpace__character'].base_ring(), category=Modules(dct['_ModularSymbolsSpace__character'].base_ring()))
    M.__dict__ = copy(dct)
    return M
```

Well, I will try it later...

I'm afraid it does not work. The problem is: We need the homset to finish initialisation of the parent, and Python decides to try and create the homset rather early in the reconstruction of the parent. Hence, when we need the character or the base ring or any other information, it is simply not available yet.

I tried to provide a `__reduce__` method for `HeckeModule_generic`, which solved the problem of pickling modular symbols. But then, a different problem arose: An infinite loop when pickling an abelian variety (to be precise: of `ModularAbelianVariety_modsym`). And it is not clear to me how to write a `__reduce__` method for abelian varieties such that the loop does not occur.

Probable I should provide the code that I have so far. In about 24 hours, I guess...

And a different approach: We should try to understand why

```
sage: M = ModularSymbols(6)
sage: loads(dumps(M)) == M
True
```
works, while

```
sage: sage.modular.hecke.morphism.is_HeckeModuleMorphism_matrix(ModularSymbols(6).hecke_operator(7).matrix_form().hecke_module_morphism())
True
sage: M = ModularSymbols(6)
sage: loads(dumps(M)) == M
True
```
crashes.

This works:

```
sage: M = ModularSymbols(6)
sage: f = M.hecke_operator(7).matrix_form()
sage: loads(dumps(M)) == M
True
```
Continuing the example, this makes it fail:

```
sage: phi = f.hecke_module_morphism()
sage: loads(dumps(M)) == M
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
<type 'str'>: (<type 'exceptions.AttributeError'>, AttributeError('ModularSymbolsAmbient_wt2_g0_with_category' object has no attribute '_HeckeModule_generic__level',))
```
Continuing the example, this makes it work again:

```
sage: del M._HeckeModule_generic__hecke_algebra
sage: loads(dumps(M)) == M
True
```

Hence, I think the following happens.

- `s = dumps(M)` pickles the content of `M.__dict__`. `loads(s)` then starts with unpickling the stored content of `M.__dict__`, after creating a would-be-copy N of M, which is not initialised at this point (this is what Python does in those cases). The unpickled content of M.__dict__ would later be assigned to N.__dict__
- The Hecke algebra of M is stored as an attribute of M. `Hom(M,M)` somehow becomes stored as an attribute of `M.hecke_algebra()` when calling `.hecke_module_morphism()`. Hence, when deleting the attribute containing `M.hecke_algebra()`, all is good.
- When unpickling the content of `M.__dict__`, Python eventually tries to unpickle `Hom(M,M)`, but replaces M with its would-be-copy N. But since N is not initialised, `Hom(N,N)` fails.

This suggests a way out: We could implement "proper" unpickling of `M.hecke_algebra()`, so that `Hom(M,M)` will not be called prematurely.

It might also be a good idea to use `@`cached_method when a method is cached. Namely, I often see stuff like

```python
    def free_module(self):
        """
        Return the free module underlying this ambient Hecke module (the
        forgetful functor from Hecke modules to modules over the base ring)

        EXAMPLE::

            sage: ModularForms(59, 2).free_module()
            Vector space of dimension 6 over Rational Field
        """
        try:
            return self.__free_module
        except AttributeError:
            M = sage.modules.all.FreeModule(self.base_ring(), self.rank())
            self.__free_module = M
            return M
```
which uses `__dict__` and hence will result in errors during unpickling.

It is a can of worms. The problem will always arise under the following conditions:

- We have `Homset.__reduce__` returning `Hom, (self._domain, self._codomain, self.__category)`
- We have a parent X whose pickling is done via pickling `__dict__` using the default Python way
- `Hom(X,X)` (or any other homset involving X) is stored in `X.__dict__`.

In this situation, unpickling X means that we have an uninitialised copy Y of X and want to call Hom(Y,Y).

My previous suggestion was: "In Hom(X,Y,cat), if X.category() fails and cat is given, then trust that X will eventually become sufficiently initialised to see that X is in cat".

Perhaps a modified suggestion is better: "In `Hom(X,Y,cat)`, if `X.category()` fails, then at least test `isinstance(X, cat.parent_class)`." This test is almost as good as `X in cat`, since the two tests are actually equivalent, unless a base ring is involved. **IF** a base ring is involved, then X is in cat up to a change of the base ring.

Do you have a better suggestion? I really would not like to implement `__reduce__` methods everywhere in sage.schemes and sage.modular.

```
sage -t sage/modular/abvar/homspace.py  # 1 doctest failed
```
which is some automatic test suite.

The situation in sage.schemes is still not good, as we get:

sage -t sage/schemes/affine/affine_space.py  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t sage/schemes/generic/homset.py  # 1 doctest failed

If we are lucky, this boils down to an improper initialisation of the category of some schemes.

The only failing test of sage/modular boils down to

```
sage: E = J0(11).endomorphism_ring()
sage: loads(dumps(E))
```
where again Hom is called on a not sufficiently initialised parent.

Here, the problem is that during unpickling, `J0(11).category()` does *not* raise an error, but returns the category of sets, which is the wrong to do in this situation.

I think I have solved all remaining problems. I needed to modify the suggested logic of "relaxing the category test when there is reason to believe that Hom is called on a domain that is in the process of being unpickled".

It now reads like this:

```python
    # Determines the category
    if category is None:
        category = X.category()._meet_(Y.category())
        # Recurse to make sure that Hom(X, Y) and Hom(X, Y, category) are identical
        H = Hom(X, Y, category)
    else:
        if not isinstance(category, Category):
            raise TypeError, "Argument category (= %s) must be a category."%category
        # See trac #14793: It can happen, that Hom(X,X) is called during
        # unpickling of an instance X of a Python class at a time when
        # X.__dict__ is empty.  In some of these cases, X.category() would
        # raise a error or would return a too large category (Sets(), for
        # example) and (worse!) would assign this larger category to the
        # X._category cdef attribute, so that it would subsequently seem that
        # X's category was properly initialised.

        # However, if the above scenario happens, then *before* calling
        # X.category(), X._is_category_initialised() will correctly say that
        # it is not initialised. Moreover, since X.__class__ is a Python
        # class, we will find that `isinstance(X, category.parent_class)`. If
        # this is the case, then we trust that we indeed are in the process of
        # unpickling X.  Hence, we will trust that `category` has the correct
        # value, and we will thus skip the test whether `X in category`.
        try:
            unpickle_X = (not X._is_category_initialized()) and isinstance(X,category.parent_class)
        except AttributeError: # this happens for simplicial complexes
            unpickle_X = False
        try:
            unpickle_Y = (not Y._is_category_initialized()) and isinstance(Y,category.parent_class)
        except AttributeError:
            unpickle_Y = False
        if unpickle_X:
            cat_X = category
        else:
            try:
                cat_X = X.category()
            except BaseException:
                raise TypeError, "%s is not in %s"%(X, category)
        if unpickle_Y:
            cat_Y = category
        else:
            try:
                cat_Y = Y.category()
            except BaseException:
                raise TypeError, "%s is not in %s"%(Y, category)
```

Note the comment on simplicial complexes: They do have a `.category()` method, but they do not derive from `CategoryObject` and thus have no `._is_category_initialized()` method. Shame on them.

In addition, some changes needed to be done for `SchemeHomsets` and the like. I think one can now start with reviewing.

<a id='comment:35'></a>
Here is an overview of my patch, to facilitate reviewing.

__sage.categories.homset__

- A homset is provided with inheritance from `WithEqualityById` (which means: Faster comparison), provided that the type of domain and codomain shows that domain and codomain and thus the homset are unique parents.
- It must be tested in some way whether domain and codomain of the to-be-created homset belong to the given category. This can fail on parents that are not completely initialised during unpickling. If this parent is an instance of a Python class, then *by virtue of the category framework* its class tells whether it belongs to the correct category, up to the choice of a base ring. I think that in this case we can assume that the parent will be fine as soon as its reconstruction/unpickling is complete.
- Homsets should be pickled using the `Hom` function, hence, with a cache.

__sage.modular.abvar.abvar__

- A category should be accepted when creating an endomorphism ring of a variety X. Previously, the correct category was read off of X.category(). However, during unpickling, X.category() might not work, and thus the category should be explicit part of the pickle data (and must hence be passed to the construction of the endomorphism ring).

__sage.modular.abvar.homspace__

- Pass the category parameter to the construction of homspaces (see above)
- Provide homspaces with an element class
- Use the element class for constructing its elements.
- The `_matrix_space` attribute used to be defined during initialisation, with information obtained from domain and codomain. Again, during unpickling, domain and codomain may be unable to provide such information. Hence, I turn `_matrix_space` into a lazy attribute, that will only be called *after* initialisation, hence, *after* finishing unpickling of domain and codomain.

__sage.modules.fg_pid.fgp_module__

- The modules should better rely on the default implementation of the `.Hom()` method. Hence, I renamed `.Hom()` into `._Hom_()`.

__sage.modules.fg_pid.fgp_morphism__

- The category should be passed when calling `Homset.__init__`
- I provided the homsets with an element class

__sage.modules.matrix_morphism__

- The constructor of a matrix morphism should accept another matrix morphism as an input. This is to make conversion of matrix morphisms (between distinct but equal homsets) possible. Aim: Let `TestSuite` pass to greater extent.
- **TODO**: To make `TestSuite` fully pass, it would be needed that the morphisms have a `_mul_` (single underscore) method. Currently, they only have a `__mul__` (double underscore) method. This shall be topic of a ticket that implements the coercion framework for homsets (I created such ticket already, but don't recall the number).

__sage.schemes.generic.homset__

- I believe that `SchemeHomset` should not rely on a `UniqueFactory`, but should rather rely on the cache of the `Hom` function. However, I did not remove the factory. Instead, I overload the `__reduce__` method inherited from `Homset` and use the `SchemeHomset` factory for pickling.

I hope this explanation makes the reviewer happy!

None; there were no conflicts. Although it might conflict with #10963..... *gulp*

Actually, I noticed that I missed an added `__reduce__()` in `categories/homset.py` -- it has a docstring but no doctests. Could you add one since I won't have access to a computer with Sage for another 6-8 hours (I will do it then if you haven't done it)? Thanks.

Anyway, I am adding a test for the `__reduce__` method now. We should then have another look at the "patch" and see what hasn't been tested.
