The goal of this ticket is a basic implementation of algebraic closures of finite fields.  Most importantly, it provides the following:

- class `AlgebraicClosureFiniteField_generic` (abstract base class)
  - method `subfield(n)` returning a tuple consisting of the subfield of order *p<sup>n</sup>* and a `RingHomomorphism_im_gens` giving the canonical embedding into the algebraic closure
- class `AlgebraicClosureFiniteField_pseudo_conway` (implements the specific defining polynomials of the finite subfields and the relations between the generators of these subfields)
- class `AlgebraicClosureFiniteFieldElement`
  (mostly a wrapper around `FiniteFieldElement`, so actually an element of a finite subfield, but having the algebraic closure as its parent and taking care of coercion into larger subfields)
- factory class `AlgebraicClosureFiniteField` (to get unique parents)
- method `FiniteField.algebraic_closure()` (invokes the factory class)

An example using the new functionality is the following analogue of the example from #8335:

```
sage: Fbar = GF(3).algebraic_closure('z')
sage: Fbar
Algebraic closure of Finite Field of size 3
sage: F2, e2 = Fbar.subfield(2)
sage: F3, e3 = Fbar.subfield(3)
sage: F2
Finite Field in z2 of size 3^2
```
To add, we first embed into `Fbar`:

```
sage: x2 = e2(F2.gen())
sage: x3 = e3(F3.gen())
sage: x = x2 + x3
sage: x
z6^5 + 2*z6^4 + 2*z6^3 + z6^2 + 2*z6 + 1
sage: x.parent() is Fbar
True
```
One can also do this without explicitly invoking the embeddings; as a shortcut, `Fbar` has a method `gen(n)` returning the fixed generator of the subfield of degree *n*, but as an element of `Fbar`:

```
sage: x2 == Fbar.gen(2)
True
sage: x == Fbar.gen(2) + Fbar.gen(3)
True
```

It is conceivable that there will be different coexisting implementations (deriving from `AlgebraicClosureFiniteField_generic`).  The current implementation uses Conway polynomials and the pseudo-Conway polynomials from #14958, as well as the functionality for finite field homomorphisms provided by #13214.

Another important question is to know what the AlgebraicClosure structure should cache.
If its possible not to store all data that was previously cmputed when some finite fields aren't used anymore, then it can make sense to discard it (imagine working with pseudo-Conway polynomials and only going up and up, at some point you won't care about polynomials used for small finite fields).
This is really arguable, but we (or I at least) had several problems before (and we still have) because pieces of Sage tend to cache too much.

This could become problematic, especially when working with fields whose degree over the prime field is highly composite.  There are at least two solutions:\n- convert references to fields (polynomials) that are not maximal elements in the lattice (w.r.t. divisiblity of degrees) into weak references, so the can be garbage-collected and reconstructed from the maximal elements as needed;\n- generalise the algorithms for generating pseudo-Conway polynomials in such a way that in order to generate a pseudo-Conway polynomial of degree *n*, it doesn't need to generate pseudo-Conway polynomials for all degrees dividing *n*, but just uses a small set of polynomials that suffices to guarantee compatibility.  For example, when you have compatible fields of degrees 30 and 200 and you want to construct a field of degree 600 containing both of them, it is of course better to use only the given polynomials of degree 30 and 200, and avoid implicitly creating subfields of degrees 300, 150, 120 etc.",

Nice work. I agree this is the way to go for Fp-bar. Here's some thoughts.

1. It'd be nice to implement a `_latex_` method in the elements.

2. There's a quote problem in the first paragraph of the docstring:

  ```
  '[\Bold{F}_n:\Bold{F}]=1`
   ```

3. I'm perplexed about the `_cmp_` function in `conway_polynomials.py`:

  ```
  sage: PCL3 = PseudoConwayLattice(3, use_database=False)
  sage: PCL5 = PseudoConwayLattice(5, use_database=False)
  sage: PCL3 == PCL5
  True
   ```

   Is this the intended result?

4. `F.inclusion(1, a).section()` is `None` for any `a`, this makes `_change_level` fail.

5. I wonder: wouldn't it be more efficient if `_coerce_2` had a shortcut for when `x` and `y` are in the same level? (I really don't know, just wondering)

6. This patch lacks some obvious coercions, for example, `F._subfield(2)(F.gen(2))`. Should this wait for another ticket, or should this ticket do it?

I'd like to play around with different implementations of Fp-bar. This would help understand if the abstract class `AlgebraicClosureFiniteField_generic` is abstract enough, or if we need to think more carefully about its interface.

I don't know what's best: make this ticket enter 5.13, then start experimenting? Or, rather, keep experimenting and wait the different implementations to have settled before giving positive review?

If you want to go for the first, I'd be happy to give positive review as soon as the minor problems mentioned above are solved. If you prefer the second option, would you mind switching to git, so to ease collaboration?

Stupid rant: I don' like the name _coerce_2, I don't think it really fits with our current naming scheme, nor that it really suggests what the function does (I first thought of coerce_to... of course it is two, not to).

About the shortcut, why not, but it does not seem that urgent.
Maybe we should do some timings.

I don't really know.
I'm usually for fast inclusion.
But for this one I might be inclined to wait for 6.0 to give it a little more testing.

In particular, I'd like to make sure that this gets well with #715, #11521, #14711, #15303 and other coercion related stuff, though there should be no problems from what I currently see.
We should also to check that when the user deletes an algebraic closure objects, everything gets garbage collected.

Maybe it needs some more thinking on the category framework integration with more general algebraic closures (not even sure it would make sense though)?
I see the Factory currently sets it to Fields().
Additional question: how does it interact with the AlgebraicClosureFunctor from sage.categories.pushout?
Not sure how harmful it would be to modify that after the current ticket is merged.

Hi,

Thanks for the nice patch! I played a little bit with the patch and here are few comments (from a user point of vue).

For the `FiniteFieldAlgebraicClosure`

- the method .cardinality() fails
- .some_elements() returns a very stupid list
- .gens() is not happy. I guess we can return a `Family`. The problem is that in the specification it is written that the method should return a tuple.

For elements

- many methods can be implemented in two lines as

```
   def my_method(self):
       return self._value.my_method()
```
   this concerns `minimal_polynomial`, `trace`, `norm`, `multiplicative_order`, ...
- in a similar way (calling apropriate method of _value and applying a morphism) it is straightforward to implement `frobenius`, `pth_power`, `pth_root`, ...
- to mimic AA or QQbar I would like a method ``as_finite_field_element(self, minimal=False)`` which return a triple (finite_field, value, homomorphism)

Vincent

Hi Peter,

I switch to git only recently and it is not easy to go from git to patches (the other way around is quite easy using the sage dev scripts). I modified several things from your patch, in particular: algebraic_closure now works without argument (the name is 'z' by default). I think that I will modify the following two problems
- .is_finite() fails on GF(3).algebraic_closure() (raise a NotImplementedError). On the other hand it will be fixed with the new category schemes which allows Field().infinite())
- Zmod(3) does not support algebraic_closure()

From the last version #15390 (roots of polynomial and eigenvalues) works nicely !

Your work is really nice!

Cheers,
Vincent

Hi,

In order to speed up a bit, you could add the following lines at the very begining of the method _to_common_subfield(self, x, y) (lines 561-580)

```
if x._level == y._level:
    return x._value, y._value
```
(when the level is the same I go from 3ms to 0.8ms)

What do you think about what I suggest in [comment:15](#comment%3A15) namely, implementing .is_finite() (returning False) and do something for Zmod(3) ?

I can not have write access to your branch on trac. But nevertheless it is still possible to synchronize our works. I will do the modification inside my branch u/vdelecroix/14990 and then you can update the changes to your local branch with

```
$ git checkout THE_NAME_OF_MY_LOCAL_BRANCH_FOR_14990

```
Once it is done you can just push the changes to your branch u/pruin/14990 on trac. The second command above pull the changes but do not reset the HEAD. The third one is precisely here for that purpose: it reset the head to the current FETCH_HEAD obtained from pull.

I will tell you when I am done.

Hey,
I'm not sure using pull/reset is the safer and best way to share your work together.
What I would do, but I might be wrong, is to track the other one branch as a remote.
Then go to my local branch and merge the other one latest changes.
* "git fetch --all" (or just the remote name if you don't want --all) to update the remote branch.
* "git checkout my_local_branch" to go to my branch.
* "git merge remote_name" to merge the remote change locally.
Best,
JP

Hi,

I push my changes to u/vdelecroix/14990. For the Zmod(p) suggestion it is actually possible to obtain the algebraic closure with

```
sage: Zmod(3).field().algebraic_closure()
Algebraic closure of Finite Field of size 3
```
So I think there is nothing to change here.

In fact, doing "pull" is the same thing as doing "fetch+merge" at once in your local branch.
It's just I find it nicer to have a bunch of remotes synchronized locally to be able to have a look at them, make local branch from them for experimentation and so on, before merging them into actual working branches.
Then you don't need the "reset --merge" trick (that I didn't know!).


To add a branch to an existing remote (as trac already exist and you surely want to track all branches coming from the trac server in the same remote), you can issue:
* git remote set-branches trac --add u/pbruin/14990

Are you sure we should remove `is_finite()` and `cardinality()` after #10963 is done?  Maybe a user wants to pass a custom category to `__init__()` (say `Ring()` or `Fields()`); then the magic wouldn't work anymore, it seems.

After a combination of Git commands and editing `.git/config` by hand, it looks as follows:

I implemented 1 using self._value._latex_().

For 4, why is there a method _change_level, it is nowhere used ? Anyway, what do you expect as a section ? It needs to be compatible with embeddings of subfields.

For 6, it is definitely not a coercion but rather a conversion. It would be nice to have it but I am in favor of having it for a next ticket.

That seems like the right solution.  The last doctest was wrong, at least on my system; this will be fixed in my next commit.

> For 4, why is there a method _change_level, it is nowhere used ? Anyway, what do you expect as a section ? It needs to be compatible with embeddings of subfields.


The bug involving the prime subfield has been fixed.  The section of the embedding between two subfields is just the map that sends an element of the larger subfield to the unique preimage in the smaller one if it exists, and raises a `ValueError` otherwise.

The reason for `_change_level()` is just that it would be nice to be able to change to a smaller internal representation of the same element, for example if one knows in advance that the result of a computation is going to be in a smaller subfield.  Probably the function shouldn't have a leading underscore, though; I'm changing this.

In principle we could register a conversion map from our algebraic closure to any finite subfield at the moment we construct this subfield, but this feels somewhat like a waste.  Alternatively, we could create a class for embeddings of a finite field into an algebraic closure, and equip that with a `section()` method, or we could (less elegantly) teach the element constructors of the various finite field classes to accept elements of an algebraic closure.

On the other hand, QQ.algebraic_closure() works and if you want a generic method for roots of polynomials and eigenvalues of matrices (have a look at #15390) then you do not want to guess about what kind of argument the algebraic closure needs. More precisely, you do

```
P.change_ring(P.base_ring().algebraic_closure()).roots()
```

I would not be in trouble if we have a default for the generator of finite field, polynomial ring, etc. Actually, `GF(9)` looks more natural to me than `GF(9, 'a')` as there is only one field of cardinality 9.

I see. But then, as a user, you do not want to guess what should be the level. If you have a look at `.as_finite_field_element()` there is a `minimal` option if set to True make the method returns the "optimal" level. If you compare with AA and QQbar the methods is called `exactify` or `simplify` (I do not understand the subtle difference between those two methods). The two latter do not accept arguments.

Fair point; as far as I am concerned, this is the main argument for allowing a default argument in `FiniteField.algebraic_closure()`.
> I would not be in trouble if we have a default for the generator of finite field, polynomial ring, etc. Actually, `GF(9)` looks more natural to me than `GF(9, 'a')` as there is only one field of cardinality 9.

That is true, but it is only unique up to non-canonical isomorphism, unlike **Z**/9**Z**, for example.  To me the notation `GF(9)` looks too much like it is canonical, and insisting on a variable name is a good way to remind the user that a choice of a defining polynomial is being made.

For algebraic closures, I am inclined to say that the current status is not bad: keep `'z'` as the default name for `FiniteField.algebraic_closure()`, but don't extend this to a default name for the `AlgebraicClosureFiniteField` constructor.

Hi,

I'm still baking my own experimental version of Fp-bar on top of this ticket. I have a question: shouldn't `_subfield()` use `check_irreducible=False` in the `FiniteField` constructor? It looks like a waste to check twice for irreducibility.

What do you mean by "duplicate commits"?

It's not a big deal for me, I can easily rebase my branch on yours. It's not meant to enter Sage anyway: it's just some experiments.

But it might be a problem for Vincent, if you still want to share work. If you want to go back in time, you can do something like this (make sure you have no uncommited work)

```
git reset --hard ​5fe4189
git cherry-pick ​4265b4f
git merge master
git push -f
```

assuming the only commit that really did something was the last one, ​4265b4f.

Anyway, as I said, I don't care. If this history is better for you, it's ok for me. I'll just rebase on top of your new history. Just try this if Vincent needs it.

The previous branch looked (on the Trac "commits" page) like two parallel and unconnected linear "chains" of commits, with all commits in the first also appearing in the other.  When I was rebasing this, Git spit out several messages saying something to the effect that the patch had already been applied (in some cases I had to resolve a conflict first).

Just to get an idea of what would be good to do before setting this to "needs-review", here is the status of the items from Vincent's list (comment:9):

>  - .some_elements() returns a very stupid list


This can be made less stupid by implementing `_an_element_()` to return `self.gen(2)`.

>  - .gens() is not happy. I guess we can return a `Family`. The problem is that in the specification it is written that the method should return a tuple.


I think returning a `Family` is acceptable given that there is no finite set of generators.

>  - many methods can be implemented in two lines as
 
> {{{
>    def my_method(self):
>        return self._value.my_method()

> }}}
>    this concerns `minimal_polynomial`, `trace`, `norm`, `multiplicative_order`, ...


I agree for `minimal_polynomial` and `multiplicative_order`; the latter was implemented by Vincent.

The trace and norm, on the other hand, are not well-defined since the definition requires a *finite* extension, for which there is no canical choice.

It remains to implement `minimal_polynomial`, which can of course be done in two lines as above.

>  - in a similar way (calling apropriate method of _value and applying a morphism) it is straightforward to implement `frobenius`, `pth_power`, `pth_root`, ...


We now have `pth_power` and `pth_root`, again thanks to Vincent, and the field itself has `frobenius`.  I don't think an additional `frobenius` on elements would be useful.

Hello,

Sorry, the story started already long time ago. I would be happy to finish the review of this ticket and work again on #15390 (no trouble about the possible rebase, I will try the cherry-pick proposed by Luca).

In case you do not want to recompile your Sage over the 6.2.rc0, I put a version that merge the develop release at u/vdelecroix/14990 (with some extra, see below).

I am in trouble because of the `UniqueFactory`. Firstly, in some doctests there is a direct call to `AlgebraicClosureFiniteField_pseudo_conway` but in practice this should be avoided as we have

```
sage: F = AlgebraicClosureFiniteField_pseudo_conway(GF(5),'z')
sage: z = F.an_element()
sage: z == loads(dumps(z))
False
```
I had no idea how to make it clear. On the other hand, what it the purpose of a factory if there is only one implementation? Note that there will be a problem with the generic `__reduce__` when there will be several implementations and I am pretty sure that many others trouble will show up.

Minor issues that I solved in a commit on my branch:

- the doctest must be in an `EXAMPLES` bloc and not an `EXAMPLE` bloc.

- I was wondering what was the point of `__getstate__` (line 473) and `__setstate__` (line 487) in the base class. It becomes clear after reading the code for the pseudo_conway class. Please, put some specification (better than "used for pickling") in `__getstate__` and `__setstate__` that would be useful to anybody who wants to implement their own algebraic closure (all right, there should not be a lot of them, but at least it will help people, like me, who are reading the code).

- Add optional keywords to `FiniteField.algebraic_closure` that are sent to the factory in order to be able to do

```
sage: GF(5).algebraic_closure(implementation='pseudo_conway')
```

- for `_get_polynomial` and `_get_im_gen` we could use the decorator `@abstract_method` (from `sage.misc.abstract_method`). That way, their existence become part of the `TestSuite` and there is no need for the `NotImplementedError`. There are many example of its usage in `sage/categories`.

- It would be better to move the test lines 41-44 inside the constructor of `AlgebraicClosure` and rather use `AlgebraicClosureFiniteField_pseudo_conway` directly. That way we are sure that the good class is tested.

- Implement `some_elements`: this is important for having better automatic tests

Feel free to reuse the merge commit or the extra one from my branch. As soon as the situation of the factory is clear to me, the branch is good to go.

Thanks
Vincent

This is exactly the reason why Conway polynomials were invented, and we could have unique representation if we only used Conway polynomials.  However, the idea of this implementation was to use *pseudo*-Conway polynomials, which do not have the same uniqueness property.\n\nIt is not clear to me at the moment that trying to get unique representation at all in this case is the right thing to do.  Especially with the current implementation, given that pseudo-Conway polynomials are not unique, it may be better to just (1) ensure that pickling works and (2) put some warnings in place that algebraic closures are not globally unique and that users should be careful if they want to ensure all elements live in the same algebraic closure.",

It is hopefully clear from the general structure, and the fact that these classes are not in the global namespace, that they are not meant to be called directly.  I do not find it too important, but we can add a remark if you think it is useful.  The above behaviour is quite bad, though...

There are indeed problems here.  First, looking at the code again, I think that in the current implementation, the interaction between the factory and the pickling code is flawed.  Second, I have been thinking about unique representation in other contexts (e.g. number fields and elliptic curves), and there seems to be something more fundamentally problematic.

From my perspective, the guiding philosophy should be that you can use `UniqueRepresentation` or `UniqueFactory` for objects that are defined *up to unique isomorphism* by a certain amount of "defining data", which corresponds to the arguments of the `__init__()` method of an object derived from `UniqueRepresentation`, resp. to the `key` used by a `UniqueFactory`.

The problem with of algebraic closures of finite fields is that in principle they are *not* defined up to unique isomorphism by a finite amount of defining data.  This is exactly the reason why Conway polynomials were invented, and we could have unique representation if we only used Conway polynomials.  However, the idea of this implementation was to use *pseudo*-Conway polynomials, which do not have the same uniqueness property.

It is not clear to me at the moment that trying to get unique representation at all in this case is the right thing to do.  Especially with the current implementation, given that pseudo-Conway polynomials are not unique, it may be better to just (1) ensure that pickling works and (2) put some warnings in place that algebraic closures are not globally unique and that users should be careful if they want to ensure all elements live in the same algebraic closure.

Hello Peter,

I do not like

```
sage: GF(5).algebraic_closure() is GF(5).algebraic_closure()
False
```

As far as I understand, a pseudo Conway polynomial is not uniquely defined. But nevertheless, the implementation of `PseudoConwayLattice.polynomial` is, no? The only thing that today prevents the uniqueness is the use of the database as shown in the following example:

```
sage: P1 = PseudoConwayLattice(5,use_database=True)
sage: P2 = PseudoConwayLattice(5,use_database=False)
sage: P1.polynomial(2)
x^2 + 4*x + 2
sage: P2.polynomial(2)
x^2 + x + 2
```
Maybe I am wrong and there is more than that.

So, I propose to restore some kind of unique representation based on the lattice. More precisely (if you agree)
- Make `AlgebraicClosureFiniteField_pseudo_conway` inherit from `UniqueRepresentation`
- add a non optional argument `lattice` in the constructor of `AlgebraicClosureFiniteField_pseudo_conway` that can also be used from something like

```
GF(5).algebraic_closure(implementation='pseudo_conway',lattice=MyFunnyLattice())
```
  (that way we would have two **different** implementations of the algebraic closure depending if we use or not the database)
- possibly restore a `__reduce__` in `AlgebraicClosureFiniteField_pseudo_conway` that avoid the factory (but I guess that it should be taken care by the `UniqueRepresentation`)

And then, it remains to find a nice way to avoid rebuilding new lattices each time a user asks for

```
sage: GF(5).algebraic_closure()
```

What do you think?

Vincent

I think there are some random choices of roots in the pseudo-Conway algorithm. Am I wrong? And even then, in practice a pseudo-Conway lattice can never be computed completely, and when you are given a partial pseudo-Conway lattice, there are many different ways of completing it.

Anyway, I agree with Peter. This ticket is not only about pseudo-Conway polynomials. There's plenty of algorithmic ways of constructing the algebraic closure of GF(p), each with its pros and cons. None of them is canonical: even the famous "canonically embedded lattices" of Lenstra and De Smit, use an arbitrary lexicographic order at some point to make things canonical.

Hello,

Thanks Peter and Luca for the lights.

1) For the comparison of `AlgebraicClosureFiniteField` you rely on the equality in `PseudoConwayLattice`... which is not exactly what you want. It compares the nodes which is something dynamical by definition. We have for example

```
sage: P1 = PseudoConwayLattice(5, use_database=False)
sage: P2 = PseudoConwayLattice(5, use_database=False)
sage: P1 == P2
True
sage: _ = P1.polynomial(1)
sage: P1 == P2     # hum!?
False
sage: _ = P2.polynomial(1)
sage: P1 == P2     # hum hum!!??
True
```
It is fine for the lattices but not for the fields. The simplest fix would be

```
class AlgebraicClosureFiniteField_pseudo_conway:
   ...
   def __cmp___(self, other):
      ...
      return self._pseudo_conway_lattice is other._pseudo_conway_lattice
```

2) It makes sense to have something more flexible like

```
sage: AC = AlgebraicClosureFiniteField_pseudo_conway
sage: AC(GF(3), lattice=my_pc_lattice)
```
where "my_pc_lattice" is an instance of a subclass or `PseudoConwayLattice` or something with the same specifications (i.e. at least a method `polynomial`). That way we can already have two implementations of the algebraic closure (calling `PseudoConwayLattice` with the option `use_database=True` or `use_database=False`).

3) In the example above, there is some redundancy as the pseudo-Conway lattice already knows the finite field... so it would be nice if the pseudo-Conway lattice implements a method `base_ring` that returns the finite field it is based on.

4) It would also make sense in `PseudoConwayLattice` to have a method `associated_finite_field_algebraic_closure` (with a better name if possible).

Vincent

PS: will see later for the unique representation problems.

Is it really fine for lattices?
I would say lattices with different polynomials shouldn't evaluate equal.

That sounds like a good idea.

Would that be really useful?
That does not really make sense, but one might want to create a lattice without the corresponding algebraic closure :)

Ok, I answered too quickly here.
The problem is that polynomials are added to the lattices but not at the same time.

In this case, the fact that when the polynomials of the same degree added to the two lattices are actually the same is pure luck.
As Luca remarked, there is some randomness (ok, maybe not so random if you look at what is actually happenning, but it is designed in a way it should be random), and the polynomials may be different.

Anyway, I do agree with the fact that the lattice are once equal, then different and then equal again.
The only sensible thing to do to compare the lattices is to chek they have the same polynomials at every degree.
Maybe in the case where `database=True` or conway polynomials are used we could make the lattice unique or consider two lattices with different degrees computed equal (but then we should also forbid lattices with `database=True` to overflow the database limits) and whatsoever that's not really the issue here.
In the case of algebraic closure, I feel the same is enough. We don't really need identity of the underlying lattices.
It's dynamical indeed, but there's no other way to do that (except for construction where you have something canonical or at least unique, let's say with Conway polynomials).
But if we have that's even better (and would be easier to test: only a pointers comparison).

Hi Peter,

Either I badly explained something or there is something contradictory in your argument. First of all you said

> The main use for it [the equality] is in deciding whether

> to another.


Fine. But that was my point, equality is broken as we currently have with your branch applied

```
sage: p = next_prime(100000)
sage: K = GF(p)
sage: F1 = K.algebraic_closure()
sage: F2 = K.algebraic_closure()
sage: F1 == F2
True
sage: _ = F1.gen(3)   # force computation in PCL 1
sage: F1 == F2
False
sage: _ = F2.gen(3)   # same computation in PCL 2
sage: F1 == F2
True
```
So depending in which stage of the computation you are, there will or will not be a coercion between your fields! Do you agree that there is a problem here? 

> we do definitely want to check "only" equality, not identity [of PCL].


Here it depends on what you mean by "equality". If it is equality as mathematical object I do agree if it is equality as Python comparison I strongly disagree. The Python equality of PCL currently is: "two PCL are equal if they agree on their already made computations". And, as Jean-Pierre mentioned, it is not the purpose of that ticket to improve that.

I don't see in what sense you can really say that equality is broken, since it is not designed to be a mathematically meaningful property in this case.  I think we should use the most restrictive notion possible that still allows non-identical fields to compare equal.  (In this way we stay as close to unique representation as possible, in the sense that two non-identical objects only compare equal under very precise circumstances.)

In this context I really think that the only sensible notion of equality is to compare the finite sublattices that have already been computed.  I understand that this does not fit the idea of "equality as mathematical object", but this is out of necessity, because an `AlgebraicClosureFiniteField_pseudo_conway` object simply doesn't define a unique mathematical object.

I think it is not even desirable in principle to improve this, because PCL's are non-unique by design.  If you want a mathematically well-defined notion of equality (that is preserved under future extension of the lattices), you have to stick to (non-pseudo) Conway polynomials or use other canonical lattices of finite fields.

Great. Thanks.

Here I am not sure I agree. But anyway it would be better not to touch `PseudoConwayLattice` anyway.

Agreed.

Hi Peter,

I still think that the equality of algebraic closures is broken for several reasons. I think (please correct me if you do not agree) that
- we do not want that the equality between unmutable objects changes: if two unmutable objects are equal at a given time they still should be equal a minute later (this is true for parents and elements)
- comparisons with == and != may never raise an error.
This is why the example I gave you before is a bug (see the other one below if you are not convinced). I am in favour of a **more** restrictive equality for fields based on identity of the pseudo conway lattice. It will allow less coercion but at least it will be consistent with the two things above.

Within your branch

```
sage: p = next_prime(100000)
sage: K = GF(p).algebraic_closure()
sage: x = K.gen(2)
sage: y = loads(dumps(x))
sage: x == y        # sanity check
True
sage: _ = K.gen(5)  # force computation
sage: x.parent() == y.parent()
False
sage: x == y
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
RuntimeError: BUG in map ...
```
In principle we could hope for a False above but the coercion system has a cache. This is the reason for the `RuntimeError`.

This is not an easy problem.  First of all, I have to say I don't understand precisely what it means for an object to be immutable.  Roughly speaking it is supposed to mean that "its value cannot change", but that doesn't seem to be a completely well-defined notion either.

It seems to me that in the case of `AlgebraicClosureFiniteField_pseudo_conway`, the indeterminacy of pseudo-Conway lattices forces us to say that (1) the "value" of an instance has to include the set of subfields that have been computed, and (2) the only way to guarantee immutability is to define equality using identity of the lattices.

If this reasoning is correct, *and* we accept that parents should be immutable (which does sound like a reasonable condition, although I'm not immediately convinced that it should hold in this situation), then we have to accept Vincent's opinion that for two instances to compare equal it is a necessary condition that the lattices be identical.  In that case I guess we may as well go all the way back to comparing by identity of the fields themselves.

It is a bit annoying, and I do not see how to easily avoid breaking the sanity check `loads(dumps(x)) == x` if we take this approach.  Maybe we should just capitulate on this point and disable this check in the `TestSuite`, or explicitly give the error as the expected result of the `TestSuite`.

Hi,

Given that `PseudoConwayLattice` is what it is, I agree to (1) and (2) in your [comment:75](#comment%3A75).

Coercion are cached and I guess it forbids to have a mutable `Parent` (unless they coerce with nothing).

And you are right, we have a big trouble as we can not loads/dumps `PseudoConwayLattice` in the way we would like them to be. It seems reasonable to me to keep the error on `x == loads(dumps(x))` and document it.

Nevertheless, we can fix it for most use cases by avoiding calling loads/dumps on the lattice. More precisely, when the user does not provide directly a lattice argument to the algebraic closure, we might cache the pseudo conway lattice used. In other words do something along the lines of

```
@cached_function
def cached_pseudo_conway_lattice(p, use_database):
    return PseudoConwayLattice(p, use_database)

def AlgebraicClosureFiniteField(p, implementation='pseudo_conway', **kwds):
    if implementation == 'pseudo_conway':
        lattice = kwds.get('lattice')
        use_database = kwds.get('use_database', True)
        if lattice is None:
            lattice = cached_pseudo_conway_lattice(p, use_database)
        ...
```
And then the pickling must be adapted by calling `AlgebraicClosureFiniteField`. I am sure that it can work but I am not sure at all it is reasonable.

Hi Vincent,

Both: mathematically speaking, algebraic closures are not unique up to unique isomorphism unless you fix some standard model, and therefore we necessarily have a similar non-uniqueness in Sage reflecting this mathematical fact.  I tried to make clear how the mathematical fact influences the Sage implementation, but let me know if you have a concrete idea for improving this paragraph.
> Moreover, this weirdness only concerns pseudo-Conway implementation (which is right now the only one).

Certainly, that is why the new paragraph starts with "In the current implementation".
> In a future, we might implement Jean-Pierre idea: deal with Conway polynomial or have a certified- non-random version of pseudo-Conway.

Of course, but we are still in the present... 8-)

(Actually, I'm sceptical about the possibility of defining "certified-non-random version of pseudo-Conway" in a way that would improve on the original Conway polynomials.  Besides, I would say that the "idea" of using Conway polynomials should be attributed to Conway!)
> 2) It must absolutely be clear in the documentation of `.algebraic_closure` that the pickling is broken! This is the main entry point for users.

OK, I'll add some explanation there too.  But I am against phrasing it as "pickling is broken"; we should really say that this is an inherent "feature" of the non-unicity of algebraic closures, at least until we support any standard model.
> 3) Do you agree to add to the documentation the different weirdnesses I described in my comments ? (possibly in a TODO section)

I don't see quickly which "weirdnesses" are still remaining, could you give me a list?

Dear Peter,

I like very much the documentation in `algebraic_closure`. Thank you.

For each problem below, I think we need to find a solution which might be: either write specifications in the documentation or provide a fix that change the behaviour.

1) Equality among algebraic closures is not constant over time:

```
sage: F1 = AlgebraicClosureFiniteField(GF(3), 'z', use_database=False)
sage: F2 = AlgebraicClosureFiniteField(GF(3), 'z', use_database=False)
sage: F1 == F2
True
sage: F1.gen(3)
z3
sage: F1 == F2
False
sage: F2.gen(3)
z3
sage: F1 == F2
True
```
It becomes really weird when we play with pickling

```
sage: p = 100003
sage: K = GF(p).algebraic_closure()
sage: K2 = loads(dumps(K))
sage: K.gen(3)
z3
sage: K == K2
False
```
One fix is to use identity in comparisons of the parent themselves as I suggested in previous comments. The only drawback I see is that `K == loads(dumps(K))` will be `False`. I think it would be safer that way.

2) Get a very strange error from conversions between different algebraic closures that can be fixed introducing more type checking in the methods.

```
sage: from sage.rings.algebraic_closure_finite_field import AlgebraicClosureFiniteField
sage: F1 = AlgebraicClosureFiniteField(GF(3), 'z')
sage: F2 = AlgebraicClosureFiniteField(GF(3), 'z')
sage: F1(F2.gen(1))
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: no canonical coercion from Algebraic closure of Finite Field of size 3 to Finite Field of size 3
```

3) (minor) The cache in `algebraic_closure` does not take into account the default arguments.

```
sage: K1 = GF(5).algebraic_closure(implementation='pseudo_conway', use_database=True)
sage: K2 = GF(5).algebraic_closure(implementation='pseudo_conway')
sage: K4 = GF(5).algebraic_closure()
sage: K1 is K2 or K1 is K3 or K2 is K3
False
```
One fix is to move the cache at the level of `AlgebraicClosureFiniteField`, but on the other hand it is good to have the cache at a Cython level.

That's all
Vincent

Hi Peter,

I agree with your analysis of (3).

All test pass and the documentation builds.

There is a typo which becomes ugly in the compiled documentation. At line 960 of `algebraic_closure_finite_field.py` you wrote <code>\`:meth:~sage.rings.finite_rings.finite_field_base.FiniteField.algebraic_closure\`</code> instead of <code>:meth:\`~sage.rings.finite_rings.finite_field_base.FiniteField.algebraic_closure\`</code>.

Once the change done, you can set to positive review.

Vincent
