Dear David, I have been working on a major overhaul of the Farey symbols including among other major improvements the latex code 
for Farey symbols e.g. 


sage: f=FareySymbol(Gamma0(23))
sage: latex(f)
\xymatrix{& -\infty \ar@{-}@/_{1pc}/[r]_{1}& 0 \ar@{-}@/_{1pc}/[r]_{2}& \frac{1}{5} \ar@{-}@/_{1pc}/[r]_{3}& \frac{1}{4} \ar@{-}@/_{1pc}/[r]_{5}& \frac{1}{3} \ar@{-}@/_{1pc}/[r]_{3}& \frac{1}{2} \ar@{-}@/_{1pc}/[r]_{4}& \frac{2}{3} \ar@{-}@/_{1pc}/[r]_{2}& \frac{3}{4} \ar@{-}@/_{1pc}/[r]_{4}& \frac{4}{5} \ar@{-}@/_{1pc}/[r]_{5}& 1 \ar@{-}@/_{1pc}/[r]_{1}&\infty}

In my patch which I have to rework because the Farey symbol code in sage has been changed between 5.9 and 5.10 
will include cusp_class and reduce_to_cusp. I have to remove some experimental features which are probably not 
useful for everybody. 

So should I merge your changes into my patch?

Hi Martin,

The second part of the patch, which you are proposing to reject, wasn't intended as a speedup: if I remember correctly (this was a while ago) the special-case code was there to correct a wrong output that was being returned in a specific corner case, the unique index 2 subgroup of PSL2Z. Anyway it indeed has nothing to do with latex formatting, so it should probably have been a separate ticket all along.
