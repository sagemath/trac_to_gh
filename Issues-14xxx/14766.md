In #11143 we weren't careful about Python ints.  There are lots of examples of this, so one will want to go through the whole file.

I'm guessing this occurs in other files too.

I think it's unreasonable to expect everyone adding symbolic functions to worry about this, and certainly users to be aware of it; maybe we could make `BuiltinFunction.__call__` automatically convert `int` to `Integer`? Or have it raise an error if an `int` is in the parameters? Allowing `int` into `_eval_` causes other problems too, such as getting expressions with `int` pyobjects in them, making arithmetic slower, etc.

At the very least, we could temporarily add `from __future__ import division` in all files that implement symbolic functions; then exact answers wouldn't be returned in all cases where they should, but at least mathematically wrong answers wouldn't occur.

I think my preference would be either raising a `TypeError` (and clearly documenting what the allowed types are) or doing Python 3 style division. I don't like the idea of adding an implicit coercion `int` -> `Integer`.

If we do type checking in `BuiltinFunction.__call__`, we should make sure that there isn't  a significant performance penalty.
