In #11143 we weren't careful about Python ints.  There are lots of examples of this, so one will want to go through the whole file.

I think it's unreasonable to expect everyone adding symbolic functions to worry about this, and certainly users to be aware of it; maybe we could make `BuiltinFunction.__call__` automatically convert `int` to `Integer`? Or have it raise an error if an `int` is in the parameters? Allowing `int` into `_eval_` causes other problems too, such as getting expressions with `int` pyobjects in them, making arithmetic slower, etc.

At the very least, we could temporarily add `from __future__ import division` in all files that implement symbolic functions; then exact answers wouldn't be returned in all cases where they should, but at least mathematically wrong answers wouldn't occur.
