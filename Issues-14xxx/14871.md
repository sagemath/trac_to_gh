I can do this if you prefer, sure. But will it really be simpler ? 

Gain : one method less

Loss : a more complicated method, with more parameters

I hesitate..

Yeah, I know... Having two is simpler.

I just don't like it, and I don't have any good argument for it. Sorry for that `:-/`

Could you add some documentation saying what the tree actually returns ? I would have expected the output graph to be a block graph (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_graph), i.e. the graph that you obtain from the input by adding an edge between any two vertices contained in the same block.

What you do makes sense, but it would be nice to say that the new graph has different vertices, some of which representing the blocks some other vertices from the graph.

I cannot see your code without thinking of 

```
sage: g = Graph(); 
sage: g.add_path([0,(1,2),1,2]);
sage: g.blocks_and_cuts_tree().is_tree()
False
```

I know it's a stupid use case... What do you think ?

Thanks !

> Do you think I should handle your code-breaking use-case ? I would rather keep the code simple.

It would be nice indeed. What do you use this graph for, however ? Would the other definition of a "block tree" I gave above work for you ? It would be a way to avoid the problem, but if this tree does something you need that this other definition would not provide...

I also think that it would be better to have a simple code `^^;`

ok, here is a new patch.

I am not really **using** these trees in this way (attached to the block/cut decomposition  of graphs), but they have a role in what I am doing. And no other variant would be correct.

Well, with these names for blocks and vertices we should be fine `:-)`
