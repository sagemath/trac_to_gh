Currently, trying to plot a function which uses mpmath and returns a complex number in the plotting domain will return an error. For example,

```
sage: from sage.libs.mpmath import utils
sage: import mpmath
sage: class Test(BuiltinFunction):
....:     def __init__(self):
....:         BuiltinFunction.__init__(self, name='test', nargs=1)
....:     def _evalf_(self, x, parent):
....:         return utils.call(mpmath.log, x, parent=parent)
....:     
sage: test = Test()
sage: plot(test, x, -1, 1)
AttributeError: type object 'float' has no attribute 'complex_field'
```

The patch fixes the problem by making `call` in `libs.mpmath.utils` return the `complex` type if a complex number is returned from the mpmath call and `float` is the parent. This is consistent with the behaviour for Sage types, as the documentation explains: "the result will be coerced to P (or the corresponding complex field if necessary)".

What are the possible inputs of the `parent` keyword? For example, it will still crash if `parent=int` or `parent=Integer`. I think it should be modified to return `complex(y)` only after either doing something like this

```
    try:
        return parent(y)
    except TypeError:
        if hasattr(parent, 'complex_field'):
            return parent.complex_field()(y)
        else:
            return complex(y)
```
or, by doing something like this:

```
    try:
        return parent(y)
    except TypeError:
        try:
            return parent.complex_field()(y)

With the patch, if `float` is the parent and it gets complex output then it coerces to `complex`, which makes sense since it is has the same precision and is also a Python builtin type. I think the scope of the patch should be to just fix this issue, which affects plotting as noted in the description.

What do you think of this solution? I think it makes the most sense.
