Back in #7004 I introduced some more flexibility for the color_by_labels option for graphviz, in order to allow for specifying a dictionary or function mapping labels to color. The attached patch extends this feature to plot and plot3d, by having them call _color_by_label uniformly. It also implements vertex labels for 3D plots.

In the long run, one would want to factor out the edge/vertex/color/labels option handling to guarantee uniformness; but that's for another ticket.

Apply: trac_14177-graph-color_by_labels-nt.patch, trac_14177-badref.patch

This being said, what would you think of a `color_by_label` argument that can be set to `False` (all edges receive the same color), to a dictionary like you do right now, or to `True`, in which case you can give each label a specific color (with `g.edge_labels()` and `rainbow`) ?

Yes, really! Just take a slightly larger extract :-)

```
        - ``color_by_label`` - a boolean (default: False)
           whether to color each edge with a different color according
           to its label; this can also take as value a function or
           dictionary mapping labels to colors; this option is
           incompatible with ``edge_color`` and ``edge_colors``.
```

I agree it's not perfect, as you may at first glance miss the information that the value can be something else than a boolean. But I did not find a better formulation without being heavy in the formaluation. Better suggestions welcome. Maybe something like:

```
        - ``color_by_label`` - a boolean, dictionary or function (default: False)
           whether to color each edge with a different color according
           to its label; the value can be a function or
           dictionary mapping labels to colors; this option is
           incompatible with ``edge_color`` and ``edge_colors``.
```

This is exactly what this is doing currently, isn't it?
