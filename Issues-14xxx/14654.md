Flow polytopes (or cones) of a directed graph is a polytope formed by assigning a nonnegative flow to each of edges of the graph such that the flow is conserved on internal vertices, and there is a unit of flow entering the sources and leaving the sinks.

The faces and volume of these polytopes are of interest. Examples of these polytopes are the Chan-Robbins-Yuen polytope and the Pitman-Stanley polytope.

Implement a class for these polytopes to compute the faces and the volume (maybe using #13249 or implementing known triangulations of them).

Yepyep.

This should probably be a digraph method. It should also appear in `polytopes.<tab>` I guess.

(You can also write the code in geometry/polyhedron and create a fake digraph function that calls it, btw)

Also, the docstring mentions sources/sinks but the code never heard of it.

On the other hand, beware of another `src/sage/graphs/generic_graph.py` which just contains too much stuff.

Note that you can `import` methods into classes just the same way as you can `import` other stuff.

Yo !

There is, but it may be a bit awkard for in one version the function takes a graph as an argument, and in the other `polytopes.flow_polytope(G)` it needs to be provided explicitly... But maybe that is not a problem.

About importing the method:

```
sage: class A:
....:     def hey(self):
....:         print self
sage: A.hey(1)
...
TypeError: unbound method hey() must be called with A instance as first argument (got Integer instance instead)
sage: A.hey.__func__(1)
1
```

But I am afraid that it does not preserve the docstring...

On the other hand it is possible to take a 'normal' function and make a copy of it inside of a class. You have many functions like that at the end of `graphs/graph.py`

> Well, for quiver guys like me, a source is a vertex with only outgoing edges, and a sink with only incoming edge. Maybe you give them other names. So there is no need to provide them as arguments. Of course one needs to have as many sources as sinks for the flow polytope to make sense. Every source gets an input of 1 and every sink an output of 1.


Oh I see `O_o`

Well, for graph guys like me we expect the sources to be explicitly given, like in `GenericGraph.flow`.

HMmmm... Well, if you are positive that this is the standard that people who call this method would expect, could you make it a bit clearer for the graph guys ? Something like:

```
... and there is a unit of flow entering the sources (i.e. vertices of indegree 0) and leaving the sinks (i.e. vertices of outdegree 0)
```

The point is that I would understand if you talk about "the sinks/sources of a graph", but in the context of flow problem we expect the sources/sinks to be specific vertices. Could you also add a sentence about the necessity to have as many sinks as sources ?

Helloooooo !

Sorry for having delayed this patch for so long. I am about to leave for a couple of months and I had a lot of things to attend to `T_T`

I found a way to make this `polytopes.<tab>` thing work. Wasn't that hard after all. I also merged the branch with the latest release.

It seems all good to go, still I have one question: from the way your code is written, a digraph obtained from "any digraph + an isolated vertex" has an empty flow polyhedron. I don't think that it is the expected behaviour, but might it be what you want for your applications ?

OOPS, please don't regard my comments as blockers! I indeed wanted to do changes, but then I noticed that the polytopes class doesn't work the way I want it to and all these changes have to wait for my other patch, which has to wait for my end-of-term work... so this might take some time. Meanwhile, feel free to review and merge this patch -- whatever I want to change I will change later with my BZ polytopes patch.

Okay, then let it get in. And you are welcome to make those source/sinks explicit, it also feels more natural to me `;-)`
