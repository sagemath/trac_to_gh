```
$ ./sage -c 'from sage.misc.interpreter import get_test_shell; shell = get_test_shell()'
[SageTerminalApp] File not found: u'from sage.misc.interpreter import get_test_shell; shell = get_test_shell()'
```

This is because `get_test_shell()` interpretes `sys.argv` and causes doctest failures with #12415.
