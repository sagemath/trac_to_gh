That is of course not the same Newton polygon as 

```
sage: R.<x,y> = QQ[]
sage: (1+x+y).newton_polytope()
A 2-dimensional polyhedron in ZZ^2 defined as the convex hull of 3 vertices
```
There might be a better place that does not require another global name, maybe as method of local fields? At the very least the `NewtonPolygon` docstring should make an effort to disambiguate.

A less scary way than `_normalize()` to compute the hull is to use some of Sage's existing polyhedral computation facilities:

```
sage: hull = Polyhedron([(0,0), (1,1), (2,-1), (3,0)], rays=[(0,1)])
sage: hull.vertices()
(A vertex at (0, 0), A vertex at (3, 0), A vertex at (2, -1))
```

Docstrings frequently need `INPUT` / `OUTPUT`, see the sage developer manual

PEP 8 spacing, e.g. 

```
    def __le__(self,other):    # no
    def __le__(self, other):   # yes
```


* `ParentNewtonPolygon.__repr__` should be `_repr_`
* `NewtonPolygon_lastslope._repr_` docstring has unused import

If there is some risk of confusion, the best is probably to remove the import of the constructor `NewtonPolygon`. Indeed, as you say, these Newton polygons are mainly used for polynomials or series over padics (see tickets #14828 and #14830) and the user is definitely supposed to write `f.newton_polygon()` if `f` is such a polynomial or a series and not to construct a Newton polygon by himself.

> A less scary way than `_normalize()` to compute the hull is to use some of Sage's existing polyhedral computation facilities:

I wonder if it makes sense to derive the class `NewtonPolygon` (provided by this patch) from `Polyhedron_QQ`.

There are obviously similarities (Newton polygons are polyhedrons in **Q**<sup>2</sup>) but also differences (the sum of two Newton polygons are their convex hull, the product of two Newton polygons are their Minkowski sum).

What is your opinion?

Thanks. I will fix it.

If your aim is to construct newton polygons from polynomials over local fields anyways then I would just make it a method there. 

Inheriting from `Polyhedron` would give you a lot of undesirable methods, so I would probably use composition over inheritance (than is, have a `self._polyhedron` attribute instead of superclass). Though at the end of the day both ways would work.

<a id='comment:10'>Comment 10:</a>
nice and useful code! 

after testing a bit myself I only found one possible issue:

self._lastslope has not necessarily been set when it is used on line 602 resulting in bug in plot()

```
sage:NP=NewtonPolygon([(0,0),(1,0)],last_slope=2)
sage:NP.plot()
```

there are also some unimportant typos like:


```
line 85: explicitly mentioned
line 90: greater than or equal to
line 272: is infinite
line 351: are the union of those
line 614: image of this
```


I hope this is useful, I'm currently at the SAGE days in Leiden and using this as practice

Attachment: **[18484.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket14826/18484.patch.gz)**

Try the `@cached_method` decorator instead of caching manually.

The docstrings should start with a short (ideally one-line) description

```
def vertices(self, copy=True): 
    """ 
    Return the vertices of the Newton polytope.

    INPUT: 
    ...
```

Are you going to add a method to polynomaials or is that going to be in a future ticket?

You should run the testsuite for parents and elements somewhere in your code (see http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/misc/sage/misc/sage_unittest.html#sage.misc.sage_unittest.TestSuite)

Hmm. In order to make this testsuite work, it seems that I need to put ``ParentNewtonPolygon`` in a category and I don't know which one is appropriate. Do you have a suggestion?

I can skip the category test, but it is also included in the elements tests. So, should I skip both?

It should. Nevertheless, I just realized that the set of Newton polygons is not a ring but just a semiring (there is no additive inverse).
The category of semirings exists in sage (it seems that it is only used for the parent `NN`) but there is apparently no generic class for elements in semirings. So, I don't know what I am supposed to do:
- should I implement a generic class for element in semirings (in `sage.structure.elements`)
- can I derive my class from `RingElement` and raise an error in the `_neg_` function?
- something else...

Thanks!

I've tried to review my patch following your answer but I got a problem: it seems that the specials functions `+` and `*` are not catched correctly by the category framework (although it works for `__add__` and `__mul__`).
As far as I understand, the reason is that the method `Element.__getattr__` is not called in these cases (and, as a consequence, the methods in `category().element_class` are not examined).

I don't know if it is supposed to be a bug; if it is, I can open a new ticket about it.

In the attached patch, I've implemented a dirty hack (cf. lines 195-198) to get around this problem and make additions and multiplications of Newton polygons work correctly.

You must never use the bare element class (`NewtonPolygon_class` in your case). Always use `parent.element_class`

```
sage: from sage.combinat.newton_polygon import *
sage: NewtonPolygon_element
<class 'sage.combinat.newton_polygon.NewtonPolygon_element'>
sage: ParentNewtonPolygon().element_class
<class 'sage.combinat.newton_polygon.ParentNewtonPolygon_with_category.element_class'>
```
My patch fixes that, and `_add_` is now called the way it is supposed to.

Various docstrings need to be formatted according to http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/conventions.html#docstring-markup-with-rest-and-sphinx

Also, you need to get to 100% coverage:

```
$ sage -coverage sage/combinat/newton_polygon.py 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
SCORE sage/combinat/newton_polygon.py: 82.6% (19 of 23)

Missing documentation:
     * line 656: def _an_element_(self)

Missing doctests:
     * line 488: def plot(self, **kwargs)
     * line 650: def _repr_(self)
     * line 659: def _element_constructor_(self, arg, sort_slopes=True, last_slope=Infinity)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

I would put the file in `sage/geometry` instead of `sage/combinat`.

Can you double-check the docstrings? I see a couple that aren't typeset correctly. E.g.

```        
- polyhedron -- a polyhedron defining the Newton polygon        # no
- ``polyhedron`` -- a polyhedron defining the Newton polygon    # yes

- repetition -- a boolean (default: True)           # no
- ``repetition`` -- a boolean (default: ``True``)   # yes


Returns ``self`` dilated by `exp`    # no
Returns ``self`` dilated by ``exp``  # yes  
```

You can implement the comparison operators much easier via

```
def __cmp__(self, other):
    c = cmp(type(self), type(other))
    if c != 0:
        return c
    return cmp(self._polyhedron, other._polyhedron)
```
though doing it the hard way is also acceptable.

I've posted a revised patch.

Concerning comparison, I'm not sure I can use the `__cmp__` construction because the natural order on Newton polygons is not total (and I've read that - I don't remember where presently - that `__cmp__` is only used to implement total order). Am I wrong?

Comparison deviates slightly in Sage vs. Python, especially for equality testing. If you don't have a total order then `sort()` will have undefined behavior. But apart from that there is nothing wrong with it. The `Element` base class already implements `__cmp__`, so you can only override it but not get rid of it.

Did you upload the right patch? I get doctest failures in `_test_prod`
