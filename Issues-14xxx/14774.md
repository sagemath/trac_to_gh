Adds the Simion-Schmidt map to the permutation class.

This map implements the Simion-Schmidt map which sends an arbitrary permutation to a pattern avoiding permutation, where the permutation pattern is one of four length-three patterns.  This method also implements the bijection between (for example) ``[1,2,3]``- and ``[1,3,2]``-avoiding permutations.
