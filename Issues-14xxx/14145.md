}
```
The following three commands all lead to errors:

```
sage: 1 in Tableaux()
sage: 1 in TableauTuples()
sage: 1 in PartitionTuples()
```

In all cases, sage reports

```
TypeError: 'sage.rings.integer.Integer' object is not iterable
```
The place where sage is failing is in CombinatorialObject.__init__ where we have:

```python

        if isinstance(l, list):
            self._list = l
        else:
            self._list = list(l)
```

The error arises because l==1 is not a list. The discussion on [sage combinat](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/sage-combinat-devel/J22BDid0sZw) concluded that this was more a bug in the `__contains__` methods of these classes rather than in CombinatorialObject.__init__ -- although, I do think that CombinatorialObject should trap this error and print a more informative error message.

Anyway, contains should never give rise to an error, so the contains methods of these classes need to be fixed.

Hi Travis,

I finally got back to this. I looked more closely at the changes in timing before and after the patch and I think that they are not in fact due to element creation but instead are caused by the lazy imports. For example, the biggest slowdown (from 0s to 6.51s) occurs with the lines

```python
G = SymmetricGroup(8)
g = G([(1,2,3,4,5),(6,7,8)])
```

I have just pushed a slight modification to the patch to the combinat queue which changes the sanity checking in Partition.__init__. I ran a few tests and the new code is slightly faster than the old code.

Finally, as my first review patch was more 4 times bigger than your patch I have made us both authors and reviewers.

If you are happy with it then let's make this a positive review.

Andrew
