Homsets are parents that, up to now, do not use Sage's coercion model and do not use element classes. Morphisms are elements that, up to now, would define a custom `__mul__` and `__add__` and so on.

The purpose of this ticket is to use the new framework. As you can imagine, this involves many changes. One important change: I let `sage.categories.map.Map` inherit from `sage.structure.element.ModuleElement`. Not all homsets are modules, of course, but when they are, then one can simply define single underscore `_add_`, `_rmul_` and `_composition_` (the latter is for composition of maps) as usual, so that one does not need to overload `__mul__` so often.

Another important change: Domain and codomain of a morphism used to be parents, but that's wrong, because parents are `CategoryObject`s that contain elements, but we can speak of morphisms (purely categorically) without elements. Hence, I changed domain and codomain into `CategoryObject`.

In sage.homology, no reasonable base classes were used: Everything was directly inheriting from `SageObject`. I improved this.

While I was at it, I was fixing some homset related pickling problems, and I implemented a cache for a parent where that has been previously tried unsuccessfully.

It is difficult to say what component this ticket belongs to. I try "categories".

I change it into "needs review", in order to let the patchbot do some work.

However, it will need a second patch, that improves documentation. But I certainly would like to get some input at that point.

I think it makes sense to introduce a new type of action (i.e., a subclass of sage.categories.action.Action) for multiplying maps by composition.

The advantages:

* Actions are cached. Hence, only when the action is created for the first time, it is needed to check whether the codomain of the right factor matches the domain of the left factor. Currently, this is checked in every single multiplication.
* Moreover, the action can keep a reference on the homset that contains the composed map, so that there is no need to call the Hom function in every single multiplication.
* Using actions is, I think, part of using the new coercion model.

The disadvantage:

* `_get_action_` is a cpdef method. Unfortunately, Python/Cython tends to confuse cpdef/cdef methods when one creates a class inheriting from two different cdef classes. Here, it means that `Homset._get_action_` is not available when one defines `sage.modular.abvar.homspace.EndomorphismSubring` as subclass of both Homset and Ring.

Solution of this problem: Drop Ring. Instead, implement the ring properties of `EndomorphismSubring` by using the category framework.

These timings show the advantage of using actions (in each example, the first timing is with both patches, the second timing is with the first patch only):

1. Both patches

```
        sage: A = ModularForms(1, 4)
        sage: B = ModularForms(1, 16)
        sage: C = ModularForms(1, 28)
        sage: F = A.Hom(B)(matrix(QQ,1,2,srange(1, 3)))
        sage: G = B.Hom(C)(matrix(QQ,2,3,srange(1, 7)))
        sage: %timeit x=G*F
        10000 loops, best of 3: 95.8 us per loop
```
  Only first patch:

```
        sage: %timeit x=G*F
        10000 loops, best of 3: 117 us per loop
```

2. Both patches

```
        sage: from sage.categories.morphism import SetMorphism
        sage: X.<x> = ZZ[]
        sage: Y = ZZ
        sage: Z = QQ
        sage: phi_xy = SetMorphism(Hom(X, Y, Rings()), lambda p: p[0])
        sage: phi_yz = SetMorphism(Hom(Y, Z, CommutativeAdditiveMonoids()), lambda y: QQ(y)/2)
        sage: %timeit x = phi_yz * phi_xy
        100000 loops, best of 3: 6.37 us per loop
```
  Only first patch:

```
        sage: %timeit x = phi_yz * phi_xy
        100000 loops, best of 3: 14.8 us per loop
```

3. Both patches:

```
        sage: R.<x,y> = QQ[]
        sage: S.<a,b> = QQ[]
        sage: f = R.hom([x+y,x-y],R)
        sage: f = R.hom([a+b,a-b])
        sage: g = S.hom([x+y,x-y])
        sage: %timeit x = f*g
        1000 loops, best of 3: 274 us per loop
```
  First patch only:

```
        sage: %timeit x = f*g
        1000 loops, best of 3: 389 us per loop
```

`__TODO__`

Provide another patch, namely for documentation.
