When running `make doc`, the whole documentation is always rebuilt, even if no source file has changed.

Before #6495, only **changed** files would be rebuilt:

```
$ make doc  # Initial build
[...]

$ time make doc  # Nothing changed

real    0m51.266s
user    0m36.840s

Hi there,

I'm sorry not being able to help more: this is my last message from my flat in Paris. I'm moving today and tomorrow to a suburb house and I won't have access to the network until Monday.

This is strange. When declaring a sphinx environment variable, there is a way to tell sphinx that changing this variable triggers the rebuild.

Even with this patch, rebuilding the documentation when nothing needs to be done still takes a very long time.

In sage-5.7:

```
real    0m48.142s
user    0m37.120s
sys     0m10.110s
```

In sage-5.8.beta2:

```
real    5m52.020s
user    4m39.910s
sys     1m5.140s
```

Do you think this can be improved? See #14204 for a ticket.
