When running `make doc`, the whole documentation is always rebuilt, even if no source file has changed.

Before #6495, only **changed** files would be rebuilt:

```
$ make doc  # Initial build
[...]

$ time make doc  # Nothing changed
[...]
real    0m51.266s
user    0m36.840s

Note that running `sage --docbuild reference html` doesn't rebuild everything, so I guess the problem is that running `sage --docbuild reference inventory` rebuilds the inventory files no matter what, and then the html build sees that something has changed, so it rebuilds everything.

Doesn't that open us up to races again? The `if not (os.path.exists(refpath) and os.path.exists(invpath)):` saves us the first time round, but subsequent inventory builds will again read and write simultaneously in the inventory directory. It might be difficult to trigger since you usually don't do that much in subsequent runs...

We could just use an environment variable to sneak information past the command line interface...

Hi there,

I'm sorry not being able to help more: this is my last message from my flat in Paris. I'm moving today and tomorrow to a suburb house and I won't have access to the network until Monday. 

Replying to [jhpalmieri](#comment%3A5):
> It's easy enough to bypass the `multidoc_first_pass` argument with an environment variable, but to get around `app.config.intersphinx_mapping = {}`, I think we will have to rewrite another chunk of Sphinx (intersphinx.py, maybe?).


This is strange. When declaring a sphinx environment variable, there is a way to tell sphinx that changing this variable triggers the rebuild. See [Sphinx doc of add_config_value](http://sphinx-doc.org/ext/appapi.html#sphinx.application.Sphinx.add_config_value). Maybe I screwed up, but this shouldn't triggers rebuild.

Even with this patch, rebuilding the documentation when nothing needs to be done still takes a very long time.

In sage-5.7:

```
real    0m48.142s
user    0m37.120s
sys     0m10.110s
```

In sage-5.8.beta2:

```
real    5m52.020s
user    4m39.910s
sys     1m5.140s
```

Do you think this can be improved? See #14204 for a ticket.
