Fixes several ill indented examples in doc/en/thematic_tutorials/lie/weyl_character_ring.rst introduced by #7922.

While I was at it, I fixed the same things in the other files of the lie thematic tutorial, as well as missing spaces around "=", and replaced `.. link` by the now available and less invasive `..linkall`. I also removed the "long time" on the f(n,k) example line 498 of weyl_character_ring.rst, since it only takes 0.22s now on my machine (probably thanks to #13391).
