The current spkg fails to detect (Sage's) LAPACK.
It uses the same linker option to detect it as to detect BLAS and it obviously fails.

It also fails to build on (some?) Solaris system with the new ATLAS from #10508 which is threaded ATLAS and needs to link with realtime library (-lrt).

The dependency of fflas-ffpack to LAPACK is optional and really not relevant to sage. It is only used for benchmarks, in order to compare its timings with LAPACK's.

It is safe to assume that Sage should build fflas-ffpack without LAPACK dependency and I suggest to close this ticket.
