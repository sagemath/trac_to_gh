I've attached a well-formed patch. I had to modify two things with respect to the book (which was with Sage 5.9), due to some recent changes in RDF:

* I added "abs tol 0.05" somewhere to avoid a failing test with 5.11

* `exact-sommation compensee` now gives 0.0 with 5.11 (instead of -0.001953125 with 5.9).
  I thus changed to 0.0 in the doctest. This will thus differ from the book, which should be
  updated to 5.11 (adding "abs tol" is not enough).
