in one of the examples of our book (in french) about Sage, we get the following
warning:

```

sage: g = plot([c*e^(-1/x) for c in srange(-8, 8, 0.4)], (x, -3, 3))
sage: y = var('y')
sage: g += plot_vector_field((x^2, y), (x,-3,3), (y,-5,5))
sage: g.show(ymin = -5, ymax = 5)
Warning: overflow encountered in arctan2
Warning: overflow encountered in arctan2

Note that this is **not deterministic**. Sometimes we do not get this warning.
