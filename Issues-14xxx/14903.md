When one tries to create a point with given coordinates on an elliptic curve over a polynomial ring, a strange error is produced ("parent must be a Homspace"):

```

sage: P = E.point([0, 0])

The elliptic curve's point homsets need to be harmonized with the rest of the schemes code in Sage. Though perhaps not right now, so in that sprit here is a fix until that rewrite happens.

An easy workaround is to define your E as over R.fraction_field().  Elliptic curves over rings have little support in Sage now.

The patch looks good as a fix until the elliptic curve code is reworked, it is a step towards solving the problem I needed this for (I just ran into difficulties elsewhere in Sage), and doctests pass.

That is how I encountered the bug #14902 (reformulated without mentioned E, but it is still visible)!
