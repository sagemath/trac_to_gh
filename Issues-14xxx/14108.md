This seems similar to #13114 but still buggy in Sage 5.6:

```
sage: G=DiGraph([[0,0],[0,0],[0,0],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]])
sage: H=DiGraph([[0,0],[0,0],[0,0],[0,0],[1,1],[1,1]])
sage: G.is_isomorphic(H)  
True
sage: G.is_isomorphic(H,certify=true)
(True, {0: 0, 1: 1})
```

Seems to be equivalent to 

```
sage: G=DiGraph([[0,0,0],[1,1,0]])      
sage: H=DiGraph([[0,0,0],[1,1,1]])
sage: G.is_isomorphic(H)                                    
True
```
But there I have no idea what to do. Deep down, the isomorphism routines for G1,G2 accept a partition for G1, but not fo G2.

No idea how to fix that `O_o`

at least one could call `is_isomorphic` with `certify=true`, and check that permuting the labels
of G with the given permutation one finds H.

That would be too easy `:-P`
It's not just a "local thing". That's really something that changes the isomorphism test I fear.

```
sage: H=DiGraph([[0,0],[0,0],[0,0],[0,0],[0,0],[1,1],[1,1]]) 
sage: HH=DiGraph([[0,0],[0,0],[0,0],[0,0],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]])
sage: H.is_isomorphic(HH)
True
```

Actually, I think that these two graphs should not be isomorphic. That's the same problem, considering how multiple edges are translated into labels.

```
sage: Graph([(0,1,1)]).is_isomorphic(Graph([(0,1,2)]))
True
```
