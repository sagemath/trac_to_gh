To change the Sage banner, you need to modify the file `devel/sage/sage/misc/banner.py`. The file `local/bin/sage-banner` is auto-generated from that file.

How about

```

| Sage Version 5.9, Release Date: 2013-04-30                         |
| Type "notebook()" for the browser-based notebook interface.        |

\--------------------------------------------------------------------/
```
?

Maybe we should make the style configurable...

Maybe we should introduce half a dozen new environment variables to control this. Right, Leif? ;)

More seriously, I'm happy with the current patch. Do we want to get that merged soon and deal with further customization on another ticket, or deal with everything here?
