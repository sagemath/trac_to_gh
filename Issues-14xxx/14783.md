Hey Darij,

A few more things:

- There's a "TODO" on line 371 of `finite_posets.py`, I believe that should be removed,
- `element_constructor` of `rowmotion_orbits` is not documented,
- "Returns" -> "Return",
- In `categories/posets.py`, could you make the <code>\`I\`</code>'s into <code>\`\`I\`\`</code> and similar for <code>\`v\`</code> and <code>\`vs\`</code> (i.e. code formatting),
- Could the `is_order_*` methods be moved into the category `Posets`?

Thanks,

Travis

Good points, done! The diff for finite_posets.py is a bit weird, but it should work. I've also caught and fixed two wrong docstrings in sage/categories/posets.py.

The discrepancy between the lines 376 and 381 in finite_posets.py might itself be worth a ticket...
