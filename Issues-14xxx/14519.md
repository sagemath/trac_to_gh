Hi Travis,

I am finally looking at the patch now. Thanks for your work on this!

Some points:

- In those places where the patch touches a "..." continuation, use the occasion to make it a "....:"
- Line 312 of the coercion tutorial: missing space before D (it was missing already)
- In all the calls to MyElement: proper spacing between arguments
- universal_cyclotomic_field.py: 
  - Unless unavoidable, don't change the order of the imports, and keep CombinatorialFreeModule imported in the `__init__` instead of in the module.
  - Mention in the code that UCFElement can't multiple inherit from the two extension types FieldElement and ElementWrapper, which is why at this point the methods `_latex_` and friends have to be duplicated (in the long run we can hope not to need anymore to inherit from FieldElement).
  - Check the spacing between the arguments in the call to element_class
- disjoint_union_enumerated_sets.py: why did the type of ``el`` change?
- The `__nonzero__` feature is new, right? I'd rather avoid it at this point, since the semantic of being zero might differ quite some depending on the use case.

Let me know when you will have posted an updated patch fixing those as well as the failing tests detected by the patchbot.

Done.

I think done; if not I'll need something more specific.

> - disjoint_union_enumerated_sets.py: why did the type of ``el`` change?

Because it because an extension class.

> - The `__nonzero__` feature is new, right? I'd rather avoid it at this point, since the semantic of being zero might differ quite some depending on the use case.

Done.

> Let me know when you will have posted an updated patch fixing those as well as the failing tests detected by the patchbot.

The updated patch fixes almost everything except 1 doctest in `misc/nested_class_test.py` (as opposed to 2 previously) and I'm not quite sure what the problem is currently. I don't think I need a `__reduce__()` in the element wrapper since it has a `__dict__` (and my `__reduce__()` was causing pickling to fail). If you have any insight into this, I'd appreciate it.

Thanks,

Travis

Okay, I figured out what was going wrong. For the nested class, `TestParent4` did not implement a `__ne__` and is not a `UniqueRepresentation`, so it does not by default check `not __eq__`. In the `ElementWrapper`, I'm testing using `__ne__`.

For the posets, the problem was that `ElementWrapper` was checking if the second argument was a `Parent` class, rather than if the first argument is not a `Parent`. Thus wrapping a `Set`, which is a `Parent`, caused the deprecation warning and a swap to occur.

The rest of the errors were trivial in the sense I needed to put a parent as the first argument. In summary: err0rz b3 pwnd.

Best,

Travis
