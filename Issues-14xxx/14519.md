Hi Travis,

I am finally looking at the patch now. Thanks for your work on this!

Some points:

- In those places where the patch touches a "..." continuation, use the occasion to make it a "....:"
- Line 312 of the coercion tutorial: missing space before D (it was missing already)
- In all the calls to MyElement: proper spacing between arguments
- universal_cyclotomic_field.py: 
  - Unless unavoidable, don't change the order of the imports, and keep CombinatorialFreeModule imported in the `__init__` instead of in the module.
  - Mention in the code that UCFElement can't multiple inherit from the two extension types FieldElement and ElementWrapper, which is why at this point the methods `_latex_` and friends have to be duplicated (in the long run we can hope not to need anymore to inherit from FieldElement).
  - Check the spacing between the arguments in the call to element_class
- disjoint_union_enumerated_sets.py: why did the type of ``el`` change?
- The `__nonzero__` feature is new, right? I'd rather avoid it at this point, since the semantic of being zero might differ quite some depending on the use case.

Let me know when you will have posted an updated patch fixing those as well as the failing tests detected by the patchbot.

Done.

I think done; if not I'll need something more specific.

> - disjoint_union_enumerated_sets.py: why did the type of ``el`` change?

Because it because an extension class.

> - The `__nonzero__` feature is new, right? I'd rather avoid it at this point, since the semantic of being zero might differ quite some depending on the use case.

Done.

> Let me know when you will have posted an updated patch fixing those as well as the failing tests detected by the patchbot.

The updated patch fixes almost everything except 1 doctest in `misc/nested_class_test.py` (as opposed to 2 previously) and I'm not quite sure what the problem is currently. I don't think I need a `__reduce__()` in the element wrapper since it has a `__dict__` (and my `__reduce__()` was causing pickling to fail). If you have any insight into this, I'd appreciate it.

Thanks,

Travis
