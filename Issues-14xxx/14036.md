I'm in IT support at a University and I was asked to install SAGE a few days ago for one of our mathematicians.  There didn't seem to be a suitable binary so I built from source as per http://www.sagemath.org/doc/installation/source.html using the current official release. ("Sage Version 5.5, Release Date: 2012-12-22",
"GAP4, Version: 4.4.12 of 17-Dec-2008, x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu-gcc")

When running sage, we found that the gap_console() command failed with symptoms identical to what is reported here:

  https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/sage-support/bfswsbOuHn8

Although that ticket refers to a solution ("Fixed in http://trac.sagemath.org/13211") I wasn't able to locate the relevant patch or any other details at the latter address, just a comment "Also gap_console() was broken. Fixed it and added a meaningful doctest."

It may have slipped by regression testing as it is still present in the source.  I tracked it down and the cause is that when the command line to call gap is generated, there is a space missing between the "-L <workspace>" option and the following console.g script name.

The problem is in gap.py, and can be fixed in two ways.

1) if you prefer to consistently plant a space after every command-line item, then change the line

```C
             return "%s -L %s"%(gap_cmd, WORKSPACE), False
```
to

```C
             return "%s -L %s "%(gap_cmd, WORKSPACE), False
```
or

2) if you would rather add the spaces before each item, then modify

```C
    cmd, _ = gap_command(use_workspace_cache=use_workspace_cache)
    cmd += os.path.join(SAGE_EXTCODE,'gap','console.g')
    os.system(cmd)
```
to

```C
    cmd, _ = gap_command(use_workspace_cache=use_workspace_cache)
    cmd += ' '
    cmd += os.path.join(SAGE_EXTCODE,'gap','console.g')
    os.system(cmd)
```
(Personally I prefer the first option)

Could you also add a regression test to see that this doesn't come up
again please?


thanks,


Graham
