Hello!!

The patch is fine! I would only add the following test. 

```
The graph has eigenvalues 20,2,-7

sage: set(G.spectrum()) == set([20,2,-7])
True
```

So that we have as much new tests as possible! Otherwise the whole testing of the graph theory module  finishes too quickly !!!


BTW. I was wondering if its time to redesign this graph database thing. If we keep adding "specific" graphs the codebase will explode with code that basically just constructs new objects.

One thing that I would suggest for all fixed graphs, compute their sparse6/graph6 string (whichever is shorter) and simply have Graph(thestring) in the given method?

Or perhaps have a data file with graphs/sparse6 strings/layouts and load that at runtime or something?

What do you think ??

I think that we will need to have an index of all sparse6 string of the graphs we have in Sage at some point. When we will want Sage to answer questions like "Have you ever seen this graph ?". But if we do have such an index, I think that we will still have the methods around at the same time. They don't have the same purpose.

But still, I don't like it either `:-P`

What do you think ?

Patch updated, by the way !

I agree. Somehow we want to balance usability and performance without making a bloated module. I don't see a solution for that though :-)

Yes. I was also thinking about that. To have some method of the form "nameGraph()" returning the name of a given graph (if known) or perhaps a construction of it in the sense "cartesian product of petersen and 5-cycle"

But this again sounds like a messy thing to implement :-)

Oh, and by the way we already have a small database of graphs from ISGCI #14396.

It's a good thing to have around, though it also looks like there will be a lot of duplicated information if we ever do that ;-)
