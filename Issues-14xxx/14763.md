I agree with most of your review; thanks for catching the non-ascii copypasta in particular. I've made checking optional and reinstated the "length = m" condition in the docstring since various people (like me) consider (2, 1), (2, 1, 0) and (2, 1, 0, 0, 0, ...) to be three equivalent ways to write one and the same partition.

Please put the exp vs. n/2 check back.

Lines 1781-1784 are redundant. That's my bad, sorry. I thought if the empty partition case was necessary in the positive exp case, it would also be in the negative exp one; but it isn't.

Lines 1785-1786 have a (now redundant) check.

Thanks for reviewing!
