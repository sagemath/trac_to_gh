Running `add_face` on a simplicial complex doesn't clear various data related to homology calculations:

```
sage: T = SimplicialComplex([range(1,5)]).n_skeleton(1)
sage: T.homology()
{0: 0, 1: Z x Z x Z}
sage: T.add_face([1,2,3])
sage: T.homology() # should be free of rank 2
{0: 0, 1: Z x Z x Z, 2: 0}
sage: SimplicialComplex(T.facets()).homology()
{0: 0, 1: Z x Z, 2: 0}
```
