This is just a needless slap in the face of OOP ;-)

Also, a better name should be picked. How about `plot().describe()`

Finally, sort by zorder and then alphabetically for doctesting sanity.

<a id='comment:7'></a>Hi Volker,

+1 for the change: I was just lazy at this point touching yet another
thing outside of root systems and risking to create a conflict; and
also launching a discussion about what would be the right output,
etc. Thanks for fixing my lazyness!

As for the name, why is active better? Isn't the convention to use a
noun describing the result for methods whose main purpose is to return
something, and a verb describing the action for methods whose main
purpose is to change ``self``? At this point I would lean for
"description".

Oh, and we might want to check if e.g. matplotlib does not have
already a convention for this. Related things are the x3d_str and
mtl_str methods in 3d plots.

Anyway, just throwing ideas in the air. Please proceed as you see fit!

Oh it does? Yikes! And I wrote this? Oops!

Ok, that explains the confusion; we agree on the naming conventions :-)

I'd rather have it return a string and use the idiom:

```
print ....plot().description()
```
so that we could reuse the result elsewhere in the of code.

Thanks!
