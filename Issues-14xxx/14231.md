At https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/sage-devel/EQzNB7vkN3o , a user tries this:

```
sage: t=(1,2,3)
sage: type(t)
tuple
sage: len(t)
3
sage: len(t)=4
sage: t
t
sage: type(t)
sage.symbolic.expression.Expression
```

This strange behavior is because of the preparser:

```
sage: preparse('len(t) = 4')
'__tmp__=var("t"); len = symbolic_expression(Integer(4)).function(t)'
```

I propose that when the preparser is about to redefine a Python built-in function, we issue a warning. This will allow users to clobber the builtins, but also tell them they are possibly doing something unwise.

If the problem is detected you could insert a warning printing message into the preparsing result. Then the warning printing gets executed together with the symbol binding.

The real problem here is that previously mistyping `len(t)==4` as `len(t)=4` resulted in invalid syntax, whereas now it results in an assignment. The same surprise happens when someone types

```
t = 0
sin(t) = 0 # mistyping of sin(t) == 0
```
Do you want to guard against that as well? Then quickly the whole `f(t)=...` notation should lead to a warning (which I wouldn't mind because I think it's one of the places where the preprocessor is too intrusive)

In fact, always printing:

```
sage: f(u,v)=u+v
Defining symbolic function f and symbolic variables u,v
```
might not be so bad. We're defining new syntax. We can define new semantics for that syntax, right?
We could have that result by ensuring that

```
sage: preparse('f(u,v)=u+v')
'__tmp__=var("u,v"); f = symbolic_expression(u+v).function(u,v); print "Defining f and u,v"'
```
or whatever (terse) message would be reasonable.

I like that. It alleviates the clobbering problem (both for "len" and "sin"), and makes it clear to the user what we are doing. I taught the MAA PREP workshop on Sage last summer, and defining symbolic functions and variables was a sticky point. This would at least give the user a warning and something to report ("Sage said it defined a symbolic function...").

However, fixing all the doctests will turn this into a bit of a patchbomb. With the above, there's about 35 files and about 300 doctests to fix. And such a change in behavior will require appropriate bikeshedding arguments on sage-devel. :)

If you want to get rid of the quotes in printing:

and return

```
NonQuoteRepr("Defining f and u,v")

instead. Perhaps we already have a class for representing messages that does this.

The part that I have always found surprising is that

```
f(x)=...
```
*also* binds `x`. The typographically similar

```
f[x]=...
```
does no such thing. Of course

```
f,x=...
```
does bind both so there is precedent of binding multiple names in one Python statement, but the construction feels unpythonic to me anyway, mainly because semantically the `x` is not there to be defined. It's there as a placeholder. That's why I think an (unpythonic) warning might fit the (to me unpythonic) syntactic construct. It does clobber our wonderful shorthand

```
_(x,y,z)=0
```
for

```
var('x,y,z')
```
with an ugly warning.
