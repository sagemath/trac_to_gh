At https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/sage-devel/EQzNB7vkN3o , a user tries this:

```
sage: t=(1,2,3)
sage: type(t)
tuple
sage: len(t)
3
sage: len(t)=4
sage: t
t
sage: type(t)
sage.symbolic.expression.Expression
```

This strange behavior is because of the preparser:

```
sage: preparse('len(t) = 4')
'__tmp__=var("t"); len = symbolic_expression(Integer(4)).function(t)'
```

I propose that when the preparser is about to redefine a Python built-in function, we issue a warning. This will allow users to clobber the builtins, but also tell them they are possibly doing something unwise.

How about the list:

```
__builtin__.__dict__.keys()
```
If the problem is detected you could insert a warning printing message into the preparsing result. Then the warning printing gets executed together with the symbol binding.

The real problem here is that previously mistyping `len(t)==4` as `len(t)=4` resulted in invalid syntax, whereas now it results in an assignment. The same surprise happens when someone types

```
t = 0
sin(t) = 0 # mistyping of sin(t) == 0
```
Do you want to guard against that as well? Then quickly the whole `f(t)=...` notation should lead to a warning (which I wouldn't mind because I think it's one of the places where the preprocessor is too intrusive)

In fact, always printing:

```
sage: f(u,v)=u+v
Defining symbolic function f and symbolic variables u,v
```
might not be so bad. We're defining new syntax. We can define new semantics for that syntax, right?
We could have that result by ensuring that

```
sage: preparse('f(u,v)=u+v')
'__tmp__=var("u,v"); f = symbolic_expression(u+v).function(u,v); print "Defining f and u,v"'
```
or whatever (terse) message would be reasonable.

I like that. It alleviates the clobbering problem (both for "len" and "sin"), and makes it clear to the user what we are doing.

Or, slightly modified:

```
sage: preparse('f(u,v)=u+v')
'__tmp__=var("u,v"); f = symbolic_expression(u+v).function(u,v); "Defining f and u,v"'
```
would provide another flavour. Here, essentially the warning is the "value" of the assignment, so it only gets printed if values of statements do (i.e., in interactive environments).

If you want to get rid of the quotes in printing:

```
class NonQuoteRepr(str):
    def __repr__(a):
        return a
```
and return

```
NonQuoteRepr("Defining f and u,v")
```
instead. Perhaps we already have a class for representing messages that does this.

The typographically similar\n\n```\nf[x]=...\n```\ndoes no such thing. Of course\n\n```\nf,x=...\n```\ndoes bind both so there is precedent of binding multiple names in one Python statement, but the construction feels unpythonic to me anyway, mainly because semantically the `x` is not there to be defined. It's there as a placeholder. That's why I think an (unpythonic) warning might fit the (to me unpythonic) syntactic construct. It does clobber our wonderful shorthand\n\n```\n_(x,y,z)=0\n```\nfor\n\n```\nvar('x,y,z')\n```\nwith an ugly warning.",

> Although I agree that this can be a problem, I wonder if this is too far from "standard" Python.  Maybe it's better to teach people that you can clobber things, like [here](http://sagemath.org/doc/prep/Programming.html#gotchas-from-names-and-copies).  I guess I'm agnostic on this proposal as of yet, though I suppose `var('y')` does something sort of similar - maybe it should have a longer message, too?

The part that I have always found surprising is that

```
f(x)=...
```
*also* binds `x`. The typographically similar

```
f[x]=...
```
does no such thing. Of course

```
f,x=...
```
does bind both so there is precedent of binding multiple names in one Python statement, but the construction feels unpythonic to me anyway, mainly because semantically the `x` is not there to be defined. It's there as a placeholder. That's why I think an (unpythonic) warning might fit the (to me unpythonic) syntactic construct. It does clobber our wonderful shorthand

```
_(x,y,z)=0
```
for

```
var('x,y,z')
```
with an ugly warning.

I never realized that shorthand until just now! Very cute. But I think we can tell anyone who uses that to just ignore the message.
