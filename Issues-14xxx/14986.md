Some users report locale errors with ssh commands to trac, see https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/ZX_k2USc7bI/6DLqoi8jPAwJ

All `AcceptEnv` options in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` should be commented out.

I can verify that `ssh -p 2222 git@trac.sagemath.org info` no longer prints warnings the way it used to. Thanks a lot!

Of course it might be that under some obscure error conditions, the error messages will now be English where they might have been localized before. But I believe that under normal operations, the git server should not generate any messages for the end user, and in any case, a developer with insufficient understanding of an English error message will probably have a hard time contributing to sage in any case. If this last sentence should one day be considered incorrect, then you'd have to install more locales before turning that setting back on.
