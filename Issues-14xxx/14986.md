All `AcceptEnv` options in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` should be commented out.

I can verify that `ssh -p 2222 git@trac.sagemath.org info` no longer prints warnings the way it used to. Thanks a lot!

Of course it might be that under some obscure error conditions, the error messages will now be English where they might have been localized before. But I believe that under normal operations, the git server should not generate any messages for the end user, and in any case, a developer with insufficient understanding of an English error message will probably have a hard time contributing to sage in any case.
