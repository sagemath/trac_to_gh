Some users report locale errors with ssh commands to trac, see https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/ZX_k2USc7bI/6DLqoi8jPAwJ

All `AcceptEnv` options in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` should be commented out.

I can verify that `ssh -p 2222 git@trac.sagemath.org info` no longer prints warnings the way it used to. Thanks a lot!

Of course it might be that under some obscure error conditions, the error messages will now be English where they might have been localized before.
