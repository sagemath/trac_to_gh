<a id='comment:9'></a>in our book we originally had the example in the description (at that time we were using Sage 5.1) but
we had to change the last equation from `x*y*z^4==6` to `x*y*z^4==3` to get Sage to really solve the system (the final version of the book is based on Sage 5.9).

With `x*y*z^4==6` as last equation, Sage 6.2 is still unable to solve the system as Sage 5.1 did in the description, thus the problem is still open for me.
