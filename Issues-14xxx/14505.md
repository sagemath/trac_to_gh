CSDP is a fast semidefinite programming solver, one of the very best around, written in C, with a callable
shared library
https://projects.coin-or.org/Csdp/
(unfortunately is has a GPL-incompatible licence, which means it cannot be made standard package)

This ticket adds CSDP: a stand-alone executable, a libtool-made shared library, and headers, to Sage. One interesting software component, using Sage and CSDP, is Flagmatic : http://flagmatic.org/

The modifications to CSDP needed for Sage support, basically, libtoolization and the spkg infrastructure, 
is hosted here: https://github.com/dimpase/csdp

A Cython interface will be added on a separate ticket.

The spkg is here:  http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/dima/packages/csdp-6.2.spkg

Apply to `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/`

How the hell one is supposed to libtoolize the thing otherwise?
That's the only modification (and some header layout was changed to conform to autotools standards).
I also wanted to stay with git rather than using svn, so I imported the original svn repo.
(and the latter was not changed for, like, 6 years, you know...)

I hope that my changes will be accepted by upstream, eventually. It is certainly possible to create the cumulative diff of my changes against the original source, I just don't see the point of this, given that all this can be extracted from the public git repo the source lives in.

But this is kind of stupid... What actually **makes sense** to review, my autotools config files, are  going to be buried under lots of automatically generated files.

I mean. Generate all the extra files you want to generate and create a single diff file which you can attach to the spkg. Something like this:

```
$ tar xf csdp-source.tbz2
$ cp -a csdp-source{,.new}
$ cd csdp-source.new && # create your configure.ac
$ ./autoreconf etc etc
$ cd ..
$ diff -Naur csdp-source csdp-source.new > csdp.patch
```
And then use the patch file to patch the src/ directory.

... making sure that `configure` etc. are newer than the files they're generated from.

However, if upstream's (almost) dead, simply treating Dima's fork as upstream is probably better.  But even in that case, everything outside `src/` isn't upstream, no matter whether upstream happens to be a Sage developer, so should properly get tracked by Sage, in a separate, independent repo.

As I already said, libGAP spkg does not follow the latter "requirement":

Aren't we moving away from plain patches towards more sanity?

I hope do not need to resort to do more shell script programming in order to patchify the setup, for this means doing poor man revision *control* instead of  the proper (and present) one. Yes, I can create a git mega-patch and apply it to the old revision at the spkg buildtime, but I don't see the benefit of this - to the contrary, it's much less clear this way. 


I am already doing more than is done in libGAP: I am shipping the full history of the spkg infrastructure, i.e. of SPKG.txt and spkg-install.
spkg is created [fully automatically](https://github.com/dimpase/csdp/blob/master/spkg/make-spkg.sh), from a github repo, with all the changes preserved. So one can see my changes to the original upstream (changed the layout of headers and added autotools). And, as I mentioned, the latter hasn't been changed in 6 years...

It seems that what you are doing with csdp isn't much different from what I am doing with `lrcalc`, see comment [comment:28]. The only real difference is that I don't host anything on github but all code is inside the spkg itself.

Could you also explain somewhere how this spkg can be built from scratch ? I remember having seen somewhere in a spkg a "create spkg" file with an internal variable equal to the url of the .tar.gz file, and running that ended up in creating the SPKG itself.

There is no problem with using commands like git or anything else at this level, since it is only run by the guy who builds the SPKG, not by everybody who installs Sage.

Oops, sorry.

Welcome to the autoHell :-)

I've added  the detailed instructions on bilding the spkg to the [SPKG.txt](https://github.com/dimpase/csdp/blob/master/spkg/SPKG.txt) and updated the spkg file. Hopefully it's clear now.

OK, I've updated SPKG.txt mentioning this, as well as git and autotools/libtool requirements for spkg creating.


> Even so, it fails with the following error on running `make-spkg`.

weird. Do have have an old/super-new hg?

Does it create csdp-hg/ in some other place for you?

(I presume you do ./make-spkg.sh)

There is no csdp-hg anywhere and I suppose it is using sage's hg when I am running `./make-spkg.sh`

```
/tmp/csdpnew» sage -sh

Starting subshell with Sage environment variables set.  Don't forget
to exit when you are done.  Beware:
 * Do not do anything with other copies of Sage on your system.
 * Do not use this for installing Sage packages using "sage -i" or for
   running "make" at Sage's root directory.  These should be done
   outside the Sage shell.

Bypassing shell configuration files...
