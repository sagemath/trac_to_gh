4.6.4 and 4.8.0 are out, let's package them:
* **optional spkg**: http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jpflori/spkg/gcc-4.6.4.spkg
* **experimental spkg**: http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jpflori/spkg/gcc-4.8.0.spkg

For the first one I picked up the three relevant archives on GCC mirrors then removed zlib directory, for the second one I picked upped the only big archive available and ran Jeroen's script.
