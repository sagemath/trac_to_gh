sage: random_matrix(ZZ,60).det()
[...]
RuntimeError: maximum recursion depth exceeded while calling a Python object
```

The problem was an infinite recursion where we compute a determinant over ZZ by working mod p and we compute a determinant over GF(p) by lifting to ZZ...

This recursion got broken because the bound to use LinBox for matrices mod p changed in #12883.  This patch fixes this bound.

It also does various clean-up of doctests and removes `_det_4x4_unsafe()` which only added an extra level of indirection (`determinant() -> _det_4x4_unsafe() -> four_dim_det()`)
