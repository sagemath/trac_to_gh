We need a better implementation of minimal_quadratic_twist(), for example if the conductor is square-free then there is no need to do so much work as is currently done.  Additionally, when j(E)=0 or 1728 the curve returned is a minimal quadratic twist, but not necessarily the minimal twist, and it would be a good thing for the documentation to make this clear.

I am CC-ing Chris W since the only place where this function is used (according to `search_src()`) is in `sha_tate.py`, line 540, and whatever we do must be compatible with what is needed there!

Of course this is in addition to adding one line to return self of `self.conductor().is_squarefree()`.

I have implemented the small improvement (do nothing if the conductor is square-free) with a new doctest, and also expanded on the documentation in the exceptional cases j=0, 1728 to remove any confusion, with an example!

I decided not to implement a new `minimal_twist()` function since 

```
EllipticCurve(j=E.j_invariant())
```
does that.  But I could.
