Currently, all evaluation (numeric and symbolic) of the Jacobi elliptic functions is done through Maxima. No derivatives or arbitrary-precision numeric evaluation are defined. Worse still, the Maxima numerical evaluation is wrong for some of the inverse Jacobi functions; see https://sourceforge.net/p/maxima/bugs/2615/.

Sure, you're very welcome to supply a patch if you have time.

Better put this code in Sage now though, and then perhaps replace it with calls to mpmath in the future (can't guarantee when the next release of mpmath will happen, regrettably).

New patch rebases to Sage 5.11, gets coverage to 100%, adds tons of new tests, and makes all Python `int`s in simplifications and derivatives Sage integers.

Please don't be worried about the length of the patch, much of it derives from identities and tests. Since there are 12 Jacobi elliptic functions and all their inverses, this adds up to a lot.

I did some tests, and the doctest for plot/line.py failed (it tries to plot a Jacobi elliptic function at line 413 and this goes awry in trying to convert a complex number which is very close into a real number to a real number).

A small issue is that perhaps `jacobi` should complain if one passes to it as the first argument a string which is not of the form 'pq' with p, q one of s, c, n, d.  Moreover, if the argument is 'pp' then it could perhaps use the convention used in the documentation and return 1?

I'm new to sage, apologies for the inanity of my comments.
