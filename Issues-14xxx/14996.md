Currently, all evaluation (numeric and symbolic) of the Jacobi elliptic functions is done through Maxima. No derivatives or arbitrary-precision numeric evaluation are defined. Worse still, the Maxima numerical evaluation is wrong for some of the inverse Jacobi functions; see https://sourceforge.net/p/maxima/bugs/2615/.

The patch rewrites the Jacobi functions as standard symbolic functions. I wrote a new numerical routine for the inverse Jacobi functions, since it didn't seem to be available elsewhere. I've also added the Jacobi amplitude function.

I did some tests, and the doctest for plot/line.py failed (it tries to plot a Jacobi elliptic function at line 413 and this goes awry in trying to convert a complex number which is very close into a real number to a real number).

A small issue is that perhaps `jacobi` should complain if one passes to it as the first argument a string which is not of the form 'pq' with p, q one of s, c, n, d.  Moreover, if the argument is 'pp' then it could perhaps use the convention used in the documentation and return 1?

I'm new to sage, apologies for the inanity of my comments.
