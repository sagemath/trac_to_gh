The current latex output for simple strings is a bit overkill:

```
    sage: latex("hello world")
    \verb|hello|\phantom{\verb!x!}\verb|world|
```

There is a rationale behind it: namely this allows for a nicer rendering of multi-line ascii art by emulating a fixed-width font. However, for a simple one line string, the following would be more readable:

```
    sage: latex("hello world")
    \text{hello world}
```

The attached preliminary patch does this. However more work would need to be done, as this requires changing quite a few doctests. In fact some code seem to assume that the output use `\verb` before stripping this away, so maybe some cleanup is in order there.

I for myself won't work any further on this patch; feel free to take over!

With #14382:

```
sage: latex("hello world")
\text{\tt hello{ }world}
```
Will this be better than verb? Middle { } are for dealing with multiple spaces, I guess we can avoid inserting them for a single space, but it will complicate the code...
