Set partitions need to be completely reorganized. In particular, there is no element class, and it is not possible to construct a set partition

```
sage: SetPartition([[1,3],[2,4]])
```
It would be great to have in order to provide statistics on set partitions.

I have been doing some work on diagram / partition algebras, which make extensive use of SetPartitions in their implementation. I think these modifications are definitely helpful.

That being said, this reorganization is definitely needed because the current SetPartitions class is a pain to work with when you only want specific ones.

Also, Chris, what are the 9 different classes of set partitions currently in Sage? Are all of these encompassed by this patch, or do they need more work? I am almost done with some code that would implement structures such as "SetPartitionsAk" as an algebra, since they are better understood and used that way.

I've uploaded the new version of the patch which fixes `partition_algebra.py` and the other misc doctests. I also made `to_partition` an alias for `shape` and added the combinatorial map decorators.

I would like to have the classes `SetPartitionsXk` removed from the global namespace and instead created through one unified interface/`UniqueFactory` (if even necessary) such as in `CartanType`. However I don't feel like taking care of that here.

I would appreciate if we could make the string representation of a set that is totally ordered to be ordered the same way. This is, each part is ordered increasingly, as are the sets by their first element:

Currently, I get

```
sage: SetPartition([[1,2,4],[3,5]])    
{{3, 5}, {1, 2, 4}}
```
but I would prefer to get

```
{{1, 2, 4}, {3, 5}}
```
Does that sound reasonable?
