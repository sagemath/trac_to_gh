Set partitions need to be completely reorganized. In particular, there is no element class, and it is not possible to construct a set partition

```
sage: SetPartition([[1,3],[2,4]])
```
It would be great to have in order to provide statistics on set partitions.

I would appreciate if we could make the string representation of a set that is totally ordered to be ordered the same way. This is, each part is ordered increasingly, as are the sets by their first element:

Currently, I get

```
sage: SetPartition([[1,2,4],[3,5]])    
{{3, 5}, {1, 2, 4}}
```
but I would prefer to get

```
{{1, 2, 4}, {3, 5}}
```
Does that sound reasonable?

This is a long patch, thanks Travis! I'd prefer if someone else could review it -- but I could also give it a quick review and let further complaints be solved in other tickets...
