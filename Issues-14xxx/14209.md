<a id='comment:3'></a>Just a couple of notes:
- we patch maxima to throw an error rather than print "Principal Value".
- internally, maxima has a flag that gets set if Principal Value has already been printed, to prevent it from being printed repeatedly.
- this flag also gets used to suppress the "Principal Value" warning in certain cases where their integration code apparently knows it's safe to take a principal value.
- so we don't throw an error if maxima wouldn't print the warning.

It would seem something about this setting gets messed up. My guess it's the way maxima deals internally with the doubly infinite integral:

```
sage: integrate(exp(-abs(x))/cosh(x),x,-oo,0)
log(2)
sage: integrate(exp(-abs(x))/cosh(x),x,0,oo)
log(2)
sage: integrate(exp(-abs(x))/cosh(x),x,-oo,0)
log(2)
sage: integrate(exp(-abs(x))/cosh(x),x,0,oo)
log(2)
sage: integrate(exp(-abs(x))/cosh(x),x,-oo,oo)
2*log(2)
sage: integrate(exp(-abs(x))/cosh(x),x,0,oo)
log(2)
sage: integrate(exp(-abs(x))/cosh(x),x,-oo,0)
ValueError: Integral is divergent.
sage: integrate(exp(-abs(x))/cosh(x),x,0,oo)
log(2)
```
At this point it can hardly be anything in the way we translate things for maxima. It's got to be in the internals in maxima. They may have changed something internally in maxima that doesn't jive well with our patch (see `maxima_lib.py`):

```
ecl_eval('(defun principal nil (cond ($noprincipal (diverg)) ((not pcprntd) (merror "Divergent Integral"))))')
```
For instance, in sage 4.7.1, which uses maxima 5.23.2, this problem does not arise. 

In fact, when you look at the message that is returned, it's:

```
ECL says: Error executing code in Maxima: defint: integral is divergent.
```
which is the error message that gets generated by `diverg`. So it seems the second time around, this code is executed with `$noprincipal` set.

BEWARE: both `noprincipal` and `pcprntd` are "special" variables, which means they are dynamically scoped. That's different from what you're probably used to.

Furthermore, the definition of `diverg` is:

```
(defun diverg nil
  (cond (*nodiverg (throw 'divergent 'divergent))
	(t (merror (intl:gettext "defint: integral is divergent.")))))
```
which shows the behaviour can be influenced by yet another special variable, `*nodiverg`. In `defint.lisp` this really gets used: they sometimes prefer a condition thrown that they catch rather than generate an `merror`. If you compare the `defint.lisp` between 5.26.0 and 5.29.1 (sage 5.0 uses the former and does not have this problem. sage 5.7 uses the latter), you'll find some changes that look like they might change behaviour around such constructs, but I wasn't able to detect a smoking gun. And of course the problem may lie in a different file and/or a bug in how the new ECL handles dynamic variables (which is unlikely and would be disconcerting, because they form a basic component of CL)

<a id='comment:4'></a>I don't think it has anything to do with `principal` or with `diverg`. I think there is an assumption on `x` that sticks around so that `abs(x)` gets simplified to `x`. Of course, `integrate(exp(-abs(x))/cosh(x),x,-oo,oo)` really is divergent. Evidence:

```
sage: maxima_calculus.eval("facts()")
'[kind(sinh,one_to_one),kind(log,one_to_one),kind(tanh,one_to_one),kind(log,increasing)]'
sage: integrate(exp(-abs(x))/cosh(x),x,-oo,oo)
2*log(2)
sage: maxima_calculus.eval("facts()")
'[kind(sinh,one_to_one),kind(log,one_to_one),kind(tanh,one_to_one),kind(log,increasing),x>0]'
```
Indeed, if we subsequently do

```
sage: maxima_calculus.eval("forget(x>0)")
'[x>0]'
sage: integrate(exp(-abs(x))/cosh(x),x,-oo,oo)
2*log(2)
```
we see the damage is undone (and redone with the second line of course).

The fact that we have a problem here and maxima itself doesn't seem to have a problem suggests that we are handling contexts differently from what maxima is doing. See maxima's documentation.

maxima's `defint.lisp` contains plenty of `assume` commands, but very little seems to have changed in how they're used. I don't know where the change comes from.

<a id='comment:6'></a>Cool. It's not our fault. It's an error in `abs_integrate.mac`, which we load:
