with Sage 5.7 I get:

```
sage: a, q, k = var('a, q, k'); assume(q > 1)                            
sage: try:
....:     sum(a*q^k, k, 0, infinity)
....: except ValueError:
....:     0
....:     
#0: simplify_sum(expr='sum(q^k,k,0,inf))
#1: simplify_sum(expr=a*'sum(q^k,k,0,inf))
0
```
Why do I get the `#0` and `#1` lines?

Paul

PS: this is one of the examples of our book (in french) about Sage at
http://sagebook.gforge.inria.fr/, and it makes our doctests fail.

This is just what maxima does. It prints a bit of a stack backtrace:

```
(%i1) t(a):= if a = 0 then 1/0 else t(a-1);

(%o1)                t(a) := if a = 0 then - else t(a - 1)
                                           0
(%i2) t(10);

expt: undefined: 0 to a negative exponent.
#0: t(a=0)(stdin line 0)

Thanks! that error finally make me find the better routine in maxima to execute maxima code while getting lisp errors rather than maxima's own funny throw/catch signalling. This simplifies code considerably.

Indeed!  Took me a while to figure out what was going on there but I agree this is probably better than printing the backtrace (though see [here](http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.mathematics.maxima.general/40253) for some other discussion; we could have just commented that out in a patch).  The only downside is that it now talks only about ECL and not Maxima, which may be confusing for some folks.  What do you think?  Otherwise this is fine, modulo doctests...

my opinion is that it is better to get rid of those debug lines from Maxima,
that couldn't be caught at all before. Thanks.

I'm not so keen on the ECL says -- Maxima says bit. It makes debugging feel like marriage counselling. I only put that in when I was writing the error catching and I wanted to confirm which code was catching/producing the errors. We can of course regain this behaviour quite easily without patching merror or writing the horrible shim we had before. If errcatch is true then merror raises a very clearly marked condition (CL for exception) so we could just catch that and raise another error with the "Maxima says" thrown in. I'd rather stick to what maxima offers already, though.

I would normally think it's not a good idea to catch that error so broadly -- you really only know *something* went wrong (and having Maxima in the error message hardly improves that -- Checking the "ECL" is hardly more generic). On the other hand, it's in solve. Those answers aren't trustworthy if there's no error either.

In this particular case, I guess we noticed that 

```
cot: argument 0 isn't in the domain of cot.
```
which is true, and so solve should give the empty solution.  Would it be fairly easy to change that solve code to catch this type of wording `argument 0 isn't in the domain` in which case presumably no solution *is* correct?  Though...

```
(%i6) solve(x*acot(x),x);

cot: argument 0 isn't in the domain of cot.
(%i7) acot(0)
;
                                      %pi
(%o7)                                 ---
                                       2
```
which is not ideal.  I opened https://sourceforge.net/p/maxima/bugs/2844/ for this.

Anyway, one way or another that doctest failure needs to be dealt with, and so much the better if it improves the solve code.
