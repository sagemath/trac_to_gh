Assignee: @williamstein

with Sage 5.7 I get:

```
sage: a, q, k = var('a, q, k'); assume(q > 1)                            
sage: try:
....:     sum(a*q^k, k, 0, infinity)
....: except ValueError:
....:     0
....:     
#0: simplify_sum(expr='sum(q^k,k,0,inf))
#1: simplify_sum(expr=a*'sum(q^k,k,0,inf))
0
```
Why do I get the `#0` and `#1` lines?

Paul

PS: this is one of the examples of our book (in french) about Sage at
http://sagebook.gforge.inria.fr/, and it makes our doctests fail.

Thanks! that error finally make me find the better routine in maxima to execute maxima code while getting lisp errors rather than maxima's own funny throw/catch signalling. This simplifies code considerably.

I would normally think it's not a good idea to catch that error so broadly -- you really only know *something* went wrong (and having Maxima in the error message hardly improves that -- Checking the "ECL" is hardly more generic). On the other hand, it's in solve. Those answers aren't trustworthy if there's no error either.

In this particular case, I guess we noticed that 

```
cot: argument 0 isn't in the domain of cot.
```
which is true, and so solve should give the empty solution.  Would it be fairly easy to change that solve code to catch this type of wording `argument 0 isn't in the domain` in which case presumably no solution *is* correct?  Though...

```
(%i6) solve(x*acot(x),x);

cot: argument 0 isn't in the domain of cot.
(%i7) acot(0)
;
                                      %pi

                                       2
```
which is not ideal.  I opened https://sourceforge.net/p/maxima/bugs/2844/ for this.
