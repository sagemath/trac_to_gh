```
with Sage 5.7 I get:

```
sage: a, q, k = var('a, q, k'); assume(q > 1)                            
sage: try:
....:     sum(a*q^k, k, 0, infinity)
....: except ValueError:
....:     0
....:     
#0: simplify_sum(expr='sum(q^k,k,0,inf))
#1: simplify_sum(expr=a*'sum(q^k,k,0,inf))
0
```
Why do I get the `#0` and `#1` lines?

Paul

PS: this is one of the examples of our book (in french) about Sage at
http://sagebook.gforge.inria.fr/, and it makes our doctests fail.

> Amazingly, I personally am responsible for the [code](http://trac.sagemath.org/attachment/ticket/7745/trac_7745-upgrade-maxima.patch) that catches this.   Now that we have the lib etc., what do you think?  I think it's still okay that we catch an error in solve and just return that we can't do it, but in retrospect the way I did it was just enough to get by.


I would normally think it's not a good idea to catch that error so broadly -- you really only know *something* went wrong (and having Maxima in the error message hardly improves that -- Checking the "ECL" is hardly more generic). On the other hand, it's in solve. Those answers aren't trustworthy if there's no error either.

<a id='comment:14'></a>> On the other hand, it's in solve. Those answers aren't trustworthy if there's no error either.

In this particular case, I guess we noticed that 

```
cot: argument 0 isn't in the domain of cot.
```
which is true, and so solve should give the empty solution.  Would it be fairly easy to change that solve code to catch this type of wording `argument 0 isn't in the domain` in which case presumably no solution *is* correct?  Though...

```
(%i6) solve(x*acot(x),x);

cot: argument 0 isn't in the domain of cot.
(%i7) acot(0)
;
                                      %pi
(%o7)                                 ---
                                       2
```
which is not ideal.  I opened https://sourceforge.net/p/maxima/bugs/2844/ for this.

Anyway, one way or another that doctest failure needs to be dealt with, and so much the better if it improves the solve code.
