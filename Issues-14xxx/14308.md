```
with Sage 5.7 I get:

```
sage: a, q, k = var('a, q, k'); assume(q > 1)                            
sage: try:
....:     sum(a*q^k, k, 0, infinity)
....: except ValueError:
....:     0
....:     
#0: simplify_sum(expr='sum(q^k,k,0,inf))
#1: simplify_sum(expr=a*'sum(q^k,k,0,inf))
0
```
Why do I get the `#0` and `#1` lines?

Paul

PS: this is one of the examples of our book (in french) about Sage at
http://sagebook.gforge.inria.fr/, and it makes our doctests fail.

expt: undefined: 0 to a negative exponent.

Thanks! that error finally make me find the better routine in maxima to execute maxima code while getting lisp errors rather than maxima's own funny throw/catch signalling. This simplifies code considerably.

for reference: the printing of 3 lines of traceback is hardcoded in `merror` (in the file `merror.lisp`), just prior to throwing the `macsyma-quit`.

my opinion is that it is better to get rid of those debug lines from Maxima,

I'm not so keen on the ECL says -- Maxima says bit. It makes debugging feel like marriage counselling. I only put that in when I was writing the error catching and I wanted to confirm which code was catching/producing the errors. We can of course regain this behaviour quite easily without patching merror or writing the horrible shim we had before.

In this particular case, I guess we noticed that 

```
cot: argument 0 isn't in the domain of cot.
```
which is true, and so solve should give the empty solution.  Would it be fairly easy to change that solve code to catch this type of wording `argument 0 isn't in the domain` in which case presumably no solution *is* correct?  Though...

```
(%i6) solve(x*acot(x),x);

cot: argument 0 isn't in the domain of cot.
(%i7) acot(0)
;
                                      %pi
(%o7)                                 ---
                                       2
```
which is not ideal.  I opened https://sourceforge.net/p/maxima/bugs/2844/ for this.

Anyway, one way or another that doctest failure needs to be dealt with, and so much the better if it improves the solve code.

I get several doctesting failures when applying this patch to master, but they look unrelated:

```
Features detected for doctesting: 4ti2,gfan,graphviz,imagemagick,nauty,palp,pandoc,pdftocairo,sage.combinat,sage.geometry.polyhedron,sage.graphs,sage.groups,sage.misc.cython,sage.plot,sage.rings.number_field,sage.rings.padics,sage.rings.real_double,sage.symbolic,sagemath_doc_html,sphinx
pytest is not installed in the venv, skip checking tests that rely on it
```
Thus this seems ok for me.
