```
with Sage 5.7 I get:

```
sage: a, q, k = var('a, q, k'); assume(q > 1)                            
sage: try:
....:     sum(a*q^k, k, 0, infinity)
....: except ValueError:
....:     0
....:     
#0: simplify_sum(expr='sum(q^k,k,0,inf))
#1: simplify_sum(expr=a*'sum(q^k,k,0,inf))
0
```
Why do I get the `#0` and `#1` lines?

Paul

PS: this is one of the examples of our book (in french) about Sage at
http://sagebook.gforge.inria.fr/, and it makes our doctests fail.

Thanks! that error finally make me find the better routine in maxima to execute maxima code while getting lisp errors rather than maxima's own funny throw/catch signalling. This simplifies code considerably.

for reference: the printing of 3 lines of traceback is hardcoded in `merror` (in the file `merror.lisp`), just prior to throwing the `macsyma-quit`.

my opinion is that it is better to get rid of those debug lines from Maxima,

I'm not so keen on the ECL says -- Maxima says bit. It makes debugging feel like marriage counselling. I only put that in when I was writing the error catching and I wanted to confirm which code was catching/producing the errors. We can of course regain this behaviour quite easily without patching merror or writing the horrible shim we had before.

In this particular case, I guess we noticed that 

```
cot: argument 0 isn't in the domain of cot.
```
which is true, and so solve should give the empty solution.  Would it be fairly easy to change that solve code to catch this type of wording `argument 0 isn't in the domain` in which case presumably no solution *is* correct?  Though...

```
(%i6) solve(x*acot(x),x);

cot: argument 0 isn't in the domain of cot.
(%i7) acot(0)
;
                                      %pi
(%o7)                                 ---
                                       2
```
which is not ideal.  I opened https://sourceforge.net/p/maxima/bugs/2844/ for this.

Anyway, one way or another that doctest failure needs to be dealt with, and so much the better if it improves the solve code.

I get several doctesting failures when applying this patch to master, but they look unrelated:

```
Features detected for doctesting: 4ti2,gfan,graphviz,imagemagick,nauty,palp,pandoc,pdftocairo,sage.combinat,sage.geometry.polyhedron,sage.graphs,sage.groups,sage.misc.cython,sage.plot,sage.rings.number_field,sage.rings.padics,sage.rings.real_double,sage.symbolic,sagemath_doc_html,sphinx
pytest is not installed in the venv, skip checking tests that rely on it
```
Thus this seems ok for me.
