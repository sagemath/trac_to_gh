It would be good to have Padé approximants for formal power series

```
sage: z = PowerSeriesRing(QQ, 'z').gen()
sage: exp(z).pade(4,0)      
1/24*z^4 + 1/6*z^3 + 1/2*z^2 + z + 1
sage: exp(z).pade(3,1)
(1/144*z^3 + 1/24*z^2 + 1/8*z + 1/6)/(-1/24*z + 1/6)
```

Yes, the patchbot is wrong. But if you write "Padé" in the title of a Sage ticket then

- your ticket will not be tested
- the patchbot that tried to test your ticket will stop

I suggest to revert to the proper "Padé" after ticket #14707 has been fixed. Maybe you can help to get somebody interested in actually fixing it.

Hi Frédéric,

I had a look at your new version and started changing a few things in `u/mmezzarobba/14720-pade`, but I stopped midstream. (I'm intentionally not setting the ticket's branch field to my branch, because it is half-broken.)

Here are some remaining issues.

* The code does not work over `RR`:

  ```
  sage: R.<z> = RR[[]]
  sage: f = exp(2*z)
  sage: f.pade(3,3)
  ...
  ValueError: variable names must be alphanumeric, but one is '0.000000000000000 + 1.00000000000000*z' which is not.
  ```
  I fixed the `ValueError` by changing the definition of `polyring` to `self.parent()._poly_ring()`, but this is not enough: the degrees of the resulting polynomials are wrong due to round-off errors.
* The doc should mention how large the order of `self` needs to be (and/or the function should raise a meaningful error when it is too small).
