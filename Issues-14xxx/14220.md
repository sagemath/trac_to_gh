Recent tickets which changed the symmetric function code (potentially #5457, #13399, #13404, #13762, but maybe others) included unnecessary import statements and lines that raise warnings with pyflakes.  This ticket corrects most of these warnings plus minor cleanup of the symmetric function code.

This sort of cleanup in new_kschur.py and k_dual.py is done in #13743, #14235, #14237
