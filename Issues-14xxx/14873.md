On Fedora 19 32-bit I get the following doctest failure:

```
sage: a = pari('2^100000000')
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
RuntimeError                              Traceback (most recent call last)

RuntimeError: evaluating PARI string
```
This doctests checks that Pari errors are caught since the result doesn't fit into the default stack, so the pari stack needs to be enlarged during the computation.

Curiously, this works correctly on Fedora 19 x86_64. I haven't completely thought through if its an error in our code, but marking the variables used in the setjmp branch volatile fixes it. I am tempted to say that treating pari_errno as constant and optmizing it out / putting it in a register is legal if its not declared volatile.

In fact, that is one of the classic cases where you must declare the variable `X` volatile: First `setjmp()`, then change variable `X`, then `longjmp` back. If you want the value of the variable `X` to reflect the change between the `setjmp` and `longjmp` then it must be declared volatile.

If it doesn't occur on your system then that is just because your optimizer is not smart enough.

There isn't anything special about 32 vs 64 bit here, it just happened to be triggered in 32 bit only.

The fact that we pass a pointer to the jump buffer down to err_catch just before leaving its scope

```
#define _pari_catch {                                                         \
        jmp_buf __env;                                                        \
        ...
        __catcherr = err_catch(CATCH_ALL, &__env);                            \
    }
```
is very worrying. And by that, I mean: does not work as intended in my 32-bit VM. Pari `err_catch()` saves the pointer and dereferences it later when the memory location has potentially changed.

I agree that `pari_errno` would not be a problem if `setjmp()` were a normal function call.

This bug is also in the pari version we are shipping (in `paricom.h` the `#define CATCH` macro), but fixed in the upstream git version.

Updated patch fixes all that is wrong in `pari_err.h`, including the use of reserved C/C++ identifiers (double underscores and leading underscore for globals are reserved).

It may be that (after applying this patch) `_pari_catch_env` remains in the scope long enough in all or most current uses in Sage, but there is nothing that guarantees this.\n- The function `_pari_trap()` from `sage/libs/pari/gen.pyx` is not declared in any header files; this led to it not being found in some cases when I was experimenting with it.\n- PARI's undocumented `err_catch()` and `err_leave()` functions no longer exist in current versions of PARI; one now has to use macros.  This means that the current error-catching code will certainly break when we upgrade to a newer PARI.  The following comes from a recent version of `pari/paricom.h`:\n\n```\npari_CATCH(numer) {\n  recovery\n} pari_TRY {\n  code\n} pari_ENDCATCH\nwill execute 'code', then 'recovery' if exception 'numer' is thrown\n[ any exception if numer == CATCH_ALL ].\npari_RETRY = as pari_TRY, but execute 'recovery', then 'code' again [still catching]\n```\nIn the PARI version that Sage currently uses, similar macros exists without the prefix `pari_`, and they are implemented differently.\n\nI made a patch that, as an alternative to `sig_on()...sig_off()`, implements new Cython macros `sage_pari_catch()`, `sage_pari_catch_end()` and `sage_pari_catch_reset()`.  (I am open to suggestions for different names.)  They use the PARI macros described above, as well as (the unmodified) `sig_on()...sig_off()`, and do not directly call `setjmp()`.  The syntax is as follows:\n\n```\nsage_pari_catch()\n...code...\nsage_pari_catch_end()\n```\nWithin such a block, one can put things like\n\n```\nif [some error or early return condition]:\n    sage_pari_catch_reset()\n    [return or raise exception]\n```\nNote that `sage_pari_catch()` and `sage_pari_catch_end()` must be on the same level, which is more restrictive than `sig_on()...sig_off()`.  The advantage is that it is less of a hack (cf. #14817), and there is less potential for errors.  I think that the new macros are cleaner and more portable to newer PARI versions.\n\nI have not yet tried to change the hundreds of instances of `sig_on()...sig_off()` in `gen.pyx`, but I did make another version of my patch at #12142 that uses the new macros, and everything worked fine.\n\nPerhaps we could first apply Volker Braun's patch to fix the doctest problem, and later do something along the lines of my patch?",

Attachment: **[trac_14873_pari_volatile.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket14873/trac_14873_pari_volatile.patch.gz)**

There are a few more points that I am worried about, which are not strictly about this patch but about PARI error handling in general:

- The file `sage/libs/pari/pari_err.pxi` causes `sig_on()` and `sig_off()` to be reinterpreted as `_pari_sig_on()` and `_pari_sig_off()`, which leads to confusion because (1) `sig_on()` and `sig_off()` already exist; (2) the names don't hint at the fact that one of the purposes is to catch PARI errors.
- The functions `sig_on()` and `sig_off()`, modified as above, are very often called in different scopes by Sage (see `sage/libs/pari/gen.pyx`).  It may be that (after applying this patch) `_pari_catch_env` remains in the scope long enough in all or most current uses in Sage, but there is nothing that guarantees this.
- The function `_pari_trap()` from `sage/libs/pari/gen.pyx` is not declared in any header files; this led to it not being found in some cases when I was experimenting with it.
- PARI's undocumented `err_catch()` and `err_leave()` functions no longer exist in current versions of PARI; one now has to use macros.  This means that the current error-catching code will certainly break when we upgrade to a newer PARI.  The following comes from a recent version of `pari/paricom.h`:

```
pari_CATCH(numer) {
  recovery
} pari_TRY {
  code
} pari_ENDCATCH
will execute 'code', then 'recovery' if exception 'numer' is thrown
[ any exception if numer == CATCH_ALL ].
pari_RETRY = as pari_TRY, but execute 'recovery', then 'code' again [still catching]
```
In the PARI version that Sage currently uses, similar macros exists without the prefix `pari_`, and they are implemented differently.

I made a patch that, as an alternative to `sig_on()...sig_off()`, implements new Cython macros `sage_pari_catch()`, `sage_pari_catch_end()` and `sage_pari_catch_reset()`.  (I am open to suggestions for different names.)  They use the PARI macros described above, as well as (the unmodified) `sig_on()...sig_off()`, and do not directly call `setjmp()`.  The syntax is as follows:

```
sage_pari_catch()
...code...
sage_pari_catch_end()
```
Within such a block, one can put things like

```
if [some error or early return condition]:
    sage_pari_catch_reset()
    [return or raise exception]
```
Note that `sage_pari_catch()` and `sage_pari_catch_end()` must be on the same level, which is more restrictive than `sig_on()...sig_off()`.  The advantage is that it is less of a hack (cf. #14817), and there is less potential for errors.  I think that the new macros are cleaner and more portable to newer PARI versions.

I have not yet tried to change the hundreds of instances of `sig_on()...sig_off()` in `gen.pyx`, but I did make another version of my patch at #12142 that uses the new macros, and everything worked fine.

Perhaps we could first apply Volker Braun's patch to fix the doctest problem, and later do something along the lines of my patch?

Since the error handling significantly changed with the new Pari version I would be in favor of doing both the update and necessary changes of our code on a future ticket. 

I agree that there are no checks on whether `_pari_catch_env` stays in scope but at least it does not definitely fall out of scope so we should at least fix this asap.
