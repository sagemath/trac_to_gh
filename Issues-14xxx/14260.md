Right now, if I have a standard tableau, I can't cast it as a tableau. For instance:

```
sage: t = StandardTableau([[1]])
sage: type(Tableau(t))
sage.combinat.tableau.StandardTableaux_all_with_category.element_class
```

This just comes from 

```
sage: t = StandardTableau([[1]])
sage: isinstance(t,Tableau)
True
```
and before trying to construct a tableau from some input this is tested... I wouldn't consider this a bug but more a feature: a standard tableau has all features of a tableau, plus extra. So for Sage users, I think this is the desired behaviour...

This casting is used all over the place. Immutability has nothing to do with it, a tuple is immutable and yet I can cast it as a list.

One can cast a Partition as a Composition:

```
sage: Composition(Partition([3,2,1]))
[3, 2, 1]
sage: isinstance(c, Composition)
True
sage: isinstance(c, Partition)
False
```

Which is the correct behavior?

You're not casting when you do that, you're creating a new object altogether, including tuples/lists:

```
sage: T = tuple(1, 2, 3)
sage: L = list(T)
sage: L
[1, 2, 3]
sage: L.append(4); L
[1, 2, 3, 4]
sage: T
(1, 2, 3)
```
In python, I believe the copy is done lazily, so if it's an immutable type, it is safe to just return the original object. Sage follows this paradigm. With your example above, `Composition` and `Partition` are different classes (with methods for `Composition` not in `Partition`), and the above behavior is a reflection of this. Why isn't `Partition` a subclass of `Composition`? I think that's more of a question for Nicolas. (A guess might be because of some overhead, but I don't really know. The explicit conversion has been sufficient for me.)

Casting is something which tells the program that the *same* object is a different *type*. For example in C++

```c++
class Foo {
};
class Bar : public Foo {
   public:
   B() { }
};

Foo *f = new Bar();
Bar *b = (Bar) f;
```
The last line is casting because a priori, the computer doesn't know `f` is pointing to a type `Bar`, so it wouldn't know what to do. Also note that both `f` and `b` point to the same object in memory.
