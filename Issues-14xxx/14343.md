The installation guide for SageTeX needs to be rearranged to be more friendly to beginning users. See https://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-edu/yhQoMuuLLv8/discussion  which links to [this review of Sage](http://cunymathblog.commons.gc.cuny.edu/2012/04/09/sage/). 

I will base any patch here on the results of #14246.



Depends on #14246

* I put the installation instructions above the example, since the example is useless until TeX can find `sagetex.sty`.
* The review of Sage describes a spectacularly unpleasant experience getting SageTeX to work. Some of his problems, I am sure, were related to the errant `sagetex.sty` that was included in TeXLive 2009 and which caused much misery. But it seems like he spent a long time trying to define systemwide environment variables. Yikes. So I demoted the `TEXINPUTS` bit in the installation guide.

* I updated the location of the source code, which is now in `...texmf/tex/latex/sagetex` instead of `...texmf/tex/generic/sagetex`.
* Some other cruft was deleted.

Our releases have version and system stuff in the name, so users will have to copy the TeX stuff over...or rename their download so the symlink works. They have to do something and I don't know a good way to automate it. I wanted to add the symlink idea because that's what the TeXShop people suggest now -- and it's what I do.

Also, how do people actually run Sage? Don't they need to rename the sage-x.y.z directory? In the SageTeX documentation we always assume that "``sage``" is in their path, so how are users accomplishing that?

Should I just remove the symlink suggestion?

<div id="comment:10" align="right">Comment 10</div>

Unfortunately, sage-6.9.beta7 still ships a version of sagetex which puts its files into `tex/generic`, cf. #15900. So the note on "older versions of SageTeX" is not quite correct.
OTOH, this point will be moot once SageTeX 3.0 is merged (#19072).
