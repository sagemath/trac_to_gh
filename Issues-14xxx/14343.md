The installation guide for SageTeX needs to be rearranged to be more friendly to beginning users. See https://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-edu/yhQoMuuLLv8/discussion  which links to [this review of Sage](http://cunymathblog.commons.gc.cuny.edu/2012/04/09/sage/). 

I will base any patch here on the results of #14246.



Depends on #14246

Our releases have version and system stuff in the name, so users will have to copy the TeX stuff over...or rename their download so the symlink works. They have to do something and I don't know a good way to automate it. I wanted to add the symlink idea because that's what the TeXShop people suggest now -- and it's what I do.

Also, how do people actually run Sage? Don't they need to rename the sage-x.y.z directory? In the SageTeX documentation we always assume that "``sage``" is in their path, so how are users accomplishing that?

Should I just remove the symlink suggestion?

> Also, the "spectacularly unpleasant experience" is very similar to #18951, or at least to the email I got which precipitated my opening that ticket... I wonder if sometimes following even one step wrong causes the other steps to just "not work"?

For a certain class of users, I'm sure it does. If you have a poor understanding of Unix-like filesystems, paths, etc, then I'm sure it's easy to take one misstep and find yourself hopelessly lost.

Unfortunately, sage-6.9.beta7 still ships a version of sagetex which puts its files into `tex/generic`, cf. #15900. So the note on "older versions of SageTeX" is not quite correct.
OTOH, this point will be moot once SageTeX 3.0 is merged (#19072).
