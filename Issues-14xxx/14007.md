PARI does require that the characteristic is prime, or at least that it won't encounter non-invertible elements:

```
gp> matdet([2,1,0;2,3,0;0,0,1]*Mod(1,4))
  ***   at top-level: matdet([2,1,0;2,3,0;
  ***                 ^--------------------
  *** matdet: impossible inverse modulo: Mod(2, 4).
```

> Another longer-term objective would ben when the modulus is too large, to use the chinese reminder theorem to work only modulo small primes

This is what newer versions of PARI do.

What I understand from your timings is that (apparently) over the larger ring (where the modulus does not fit on 64 bits), things are slower with the patch.
