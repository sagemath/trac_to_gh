This patch improves on the heuristics to decide which algorithm to use for determinants over `ZZ` and `GF(p)`.

Also misc improvements to `integer_mod.pyx`

There are already doctests computing determinants over `GF(p)`, so I don't see why we should add a new one.

There is a convincing improvement : 

```
sage: M = random_matrix( Integers( next_prime( factorial(10) ) ), 400 )
sage: time M.det()
Time: CPU 0.04 s, Wall: 0.03 s
```
versus :

```
sage: M = random_matrix( Integers( next_prime( factorial(10) ) + 1), 400 )
sage: time M.det()
Time: CPU 4.65 s, Wall: 3.99 s
```

Positive review !

There are cases where the patch is in fact a huge regression !

I ran the following test : 

```
sage: sage: for i in range(1,6):
    M = random_matrix( Integers(p), 75*i )
    time d = M.det()
```
with ``p = next_prime( factorial(20) )`` and ``sage: p = next_prime( factorial(21) )``

Before patch:

Sounds good. I don't know how to detect the word size inside sage (?). It amazes me that moving from "less than 64 bits" to "more than 64 bits" actually speeds up the process instead of slowing it down in the integer case...

I also checked that the corresponding PARI routine (`Flm_det_sp_OK` in `src/basemath/linalg1.c`) does not require the characteristic of the ring to be prime. The same procedure in PARI deals with determinants in ZZ/6ZZ and ZZ/11ZZ.

I tried to get rid of the prime limitation but failed with an error I did not understand... Jeroen, could you try?

Also, note that the PARI implementation is rather naïve : is performs a simple gaussian elimination (no strassen, no fancy stuff). A longer-term objective would be to let FFLAS do this.

Also, another longer-term objective would ben when the modulus is too large, to use the chinese reminder theorem to work only modulo small primes (this can also be done  modulo the integers). But this would require PARI to handle the non-prime cases.

PARI does require that the characteristic is prime, or at least that it won't encounter non-invertible elements:

```
gp> matdet([2,1,0;2,3,0;0,0,1]*Mod(1,4))
  ***   at top-level: matdet([2,1,0;2,3,0;
  ***                 ^--------------------
  *** matdet: impossible inverse modulo: Mod(2, 4).
```

> Another longer-term objective would ben when the modulus is too large, to use the chinese reminder theorem to work only modulo small primes

This is what newer versions of PARI do.

This seems to suggest that improvements are needed in the integer `determinant()` function.

What I understand from your timings is that (apparently) over the larger ring (where the modulus does not fit on 64 bits), things are slower with the patch.

Agreed, on another ticket?
