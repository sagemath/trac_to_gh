The attached file provides doctests for examples in the chapter on solving nonlinear equations, which I am posting on behalf of Matthias Meulien. See #9395 for some background.

(Matthias, I took the liberty of marking two of the tests with `# long time`.)

All tests pass with Sage 5.9β0 on my machine.
