To you...

If the folders are sorted (or more precisely, get processed in alphabetical order), you at least get an idea of the progress.

W.r.t. performance:  It certainly doesn't matter *here* (at least currently ;-) ), that's why I wrote *stylewise*.  People<sup>*</sup> tend to get used to such, adding overhead here and there, and at some point it *does* matter.

(<sup>*</sup> which includes people *reading* such code, not necessarily their author(s))

Step out for a few hours and you miss a lot.  ;-)

I just used this to build the reference manual on 5.10.beta5 by nuking `doc/output` and doing

```
sage -docbuild reference inventory
sage -docbuild reference html
```

and it seemed to work just fine.  At least the matroid documentation rendered fine.  So I'm all for a positive review based on my testing.  I'll stay out of the sorted discussion.
