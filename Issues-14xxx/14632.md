Essentially what the title says. If it doesn't support the option, then there are two ways it can be handled:
1. it will give an error from show just like the other plot functions do.
2. it will check the dict from sage.plot.graphics.Graphics.SHOW_DEFAULT and raise an error from the generic_graph.plot() or generic_graph.graphplot() itself.

Thanks. You should learn some of the graph*ics* code too! Then you can review my patches `;-)`. Anyway, I updated the patch with a [one character change](https://github.com/ppurka/sage-patches/commit/3beb2941461e94a45fec0e1f233e3c6f93fd1fc7) that I didn't notice for days.

unfortunately, no. That's just my repo to keep track of my patches. I need to apply a bunch of them every time I need to do any work.

Well, some of them are trivial but some are not so trivial :)

You can get the numbers from the [file names here](https://github.com/ppurka/sage-patches/tree/master/sage_devel).

As for the patches themselves, I would say that

1. You can ignore the first six patches because the first two were being reviewed, while the next four will probably never get in.
2. Trivial patch: #13690
3. For improving consistency the tickets are #14229, #13834, #13660
4. For my own work, I always need to apply #13422, #13528, #14580, #12798 (which is slow *during doctesting* on Solaris and has no future of getting in), and the type1-fonts (which I haven't made into a proper patch),
5. New features: #13246, #14580, #14112, #13576

(I just realized that two of them should have been set to needs review!)
