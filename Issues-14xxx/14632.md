Essentially what the title says. If it doesn't support the option, then there are two ways it can be handled:
1. it will give an error from show just like the other plot functions do.
2. it will check the dict from sage.plot.graphics.Graphics.SHOW_DEFAULT and raise an error from the generic_graph.plot() or generic_graph.graphplot() itself.

Hmmmm... What can we do about that ?

```
sage: graphs.PetersenGraph().plot(aewarehaerhaerherh=8)
```

This is the line that used to return a warning

```
sage: graphs.PetersenGraph().plot(aewaerh=8)

This method may soon be updated so that the method raises an exception instead of this warning, which will break your code : to be on the safe side, update it !
See http://trac.sagemath.org/13891 for details.
  return GraphPlot(graph=self, options=options)
```

Could we check that all arguments given as input are actually used somewhere ?

unfortunately, no. That's just my repo to keep track of my patches. I need to apply a bunch of them every time I need to do any work.

Well, some of them are trivial but some are not so trivial :)

You can get the numbers from the [file names here](https://github.com/ppurka/sage-patches/tree/master/sage_devel).

As for the patches themselves, I would say that

1. You can ignore the first six patches because the first two were being reviewed, while the next four will probably never get in.
2. Trivial patch: #13690
3. For improving consistency the tickets are #14229, #13834, #13660
4. For my own work, I always need to apply #13422, #13528, #14580, #12798 (which is slow *during doctesting* on Solaris and has no future of getting in), and the type1-fonts (which I haven't made into a proper patch),
5. New features: #13246, #14580, #14112, #13576

(I just realized that two of them should have been set to needs review!)
