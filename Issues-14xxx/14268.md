IIRC we had trouble with `typedef`ed `ulong` on Solaris.

It does indeed. I'd say this is a bug.

I disagree with this conclusion, since over-riding `CFLAGS` also removes other mandatory flags, like `-fno-strict-aliasing`. So you're basically saying that my patch breaks something which is already broken.

Nope.  It *further* breaks building extension modules, IMHO without any gain.

(Btw., exporting `CFLAGS=""` is sufficient.)
