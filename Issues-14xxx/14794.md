While working on quivers `sage.quivers.*` we ran into some confusing documentation in `DiGraph` about the `boundary` argument of the constructor:

```
    -  ``boundary`` - a list of boundary vertices, if none,
       digraph is considered as a 'digraph without boundary'
```

Here, it turns out that `None` is not actually allowed, and instead an empty list `[]` should be used instead. This is described more clearly in the `Graph` docstring:

```
    -  ``boundary`` - a list of boundary vertices, if
       empty, graph is considered as a 'graph without boundary'
```

An example of a problem:

```
sage: DiGraph()
Digraph on 0 vertices
sage: show(DiGraph())
sage: show(DiGraph(boundary=[]))
sage: show(DiGraph(boundary=None))
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
...
TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()
```

As a separate point, both `Graph.__init__` and `DiGraph.__init__` have mutable default arguments (`def __init__(..., boundary=[], ...)`) which is frowned upon.

The patch is now up.

The `_boundary` attribute seems to be only used in the files:

```
graphs/graph_plot.py: GraphPlot.set_vertices assumes _boundary is iterable
graphs/generic_graph.py: Lots of code assumes (or enforces) that _boundary is a list
graphs/graph.py: only used in __init__
graphs/digraph.py: only used in __init__, wrong documentation
```

None of the code modifies the list, and in fact some of it goes to some pains to make sure appropriate copies are made. Would there be any objections to replacing the list by a tuple everywhere?

I never used this thing, and to me a code which is not documented might as well not be there, if it is only meant to be used by the guy who added it in the first place.

This being said, has it become illegal to use list as an object's attribute ? I understand that you want an immutable version of everything that is in Sage, but if it means preventing people from writing code as they want to perhaps you should change your plans `O_o`

By the way, who "frowns upon" mutable arguments ? It's useful to have a list somewhere, from time to time `O_o`

I'm not the one who added it, but it did cause a functional problem (did you see the failing test in the ticket description?), namely the `show()` method blowing up.

> This being said, has it become illegal to use list as an object's attribute ? I understand that you want an immutable version of everything that is in Sage, but if it means preventing people from writing code as they want to perhaps you should change your plans `O_o`

I know I got a previous patch rejected for using a list instead of a tuple or `None` as a default argument before, and I now agree with this policy (which is part of PEP 8). Why potentially shoot yourself in the foot for no benefit at all?

> By the way, who "frowns upon" mutable arguments ? It's useful to have a list somewhere, from time to time `O_o`

The problem is only with mutable `_default_` arguments. Go ahead and pass a list when you call a function whenever you want.

It's true, I'm fixing the problem in two different ways. Maybe this is overkill. Still, bringing the documentation of `DiGraph` in line with the documentation of `Graph` seemed like a good idea. Another fix would be to use `()` instead of `None` as the default argument, and then either turn it into a list later (or change the rest of the code to deal with `_boundary` begin a tuple, which I volunteer to do if no one objects).

I'm happy with any solution where:
* the attribute `_boundary` is always an iterable, and not `None`, since the rest of the code expects this, and
* the `__init__` method does not have mutable default arguments.

If you have more/different requirements, let me know.

Replying to [@nathanncohen](#comment%3A7):
> (and you probably removed a ' by mistake at the end of a line)

Yes, good catch, sorry about that. The updated patch should fix this.

Yeahyeah of course. I don't like this code either. Not documented, don't know what it does. Actually I would like to have a non-authoritarian way to get rid of it. Otherwise we'll jkust be shipping useless codes forever.

> I know I got a previous patch rejected for using a list instead of a tuple or `None` as a default argument before, and I now agree with this policy (which is part of PEP 8). Why potentially shoot yourself in the foot for no benefit at all?

What exactly is the problem with default mutable arguments ? PEP8 even tells me that I should not put blank lines in my code when I think that it improves readability (cf #14562), so to me PEP8 is like the new version of my high school internal rules.

> It's true, I'm fixing the problem in two different ways. Maybe this is overkill. Still, bringing the documentation of `DiGraph` in line with the documentation of `Graph` seemed like a good idea. Another fix would be to use `()` instead of `None` as the default argument, and then either turn it into a list later (or change the rest of the code to deal with `_boundary` begin a tuple, which I volunteer to do if no one objects).

Oh. I see. It's just that as it is, you set the default value to something that the documentation does not claim to be admissible.

> I'm happy with any solution where:
> * the attribute `_boundary` is always an iterable, and not `None`, since the rest of the code expects this, and
> * the `__init__` method does not have mutable default arguments.

I don't have any requirements. Well, short of understanding why mutable default arguments are now against the Dogma `O_o`
