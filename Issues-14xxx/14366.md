```
The following is mathematically wrong:

```
sage: 0 in CyclotomicField(3).ideal(0)
False
```

It comes from the function _contains_(self, x) in the class NumberFieldIdeal (file sage/rings/number_field/number_field_ideal.py), which tries to compute the coordinates of the element in a basis (over ZZ) of the ideal. The function coordinates(self, x) fails for the zero ideal, raising a TypeError (in fact when _contains_ is called directly, a TypeError is raised).
A workaround is to replace

```
def _contains_(self, x):
    return self.coordinates(self.number_field()(x)).denominator() == 1
```

with


```
def _contains_(self, x):
    return x==0 or self.coordinates(self.number_field()(x)).denominator() == 1
```

but I am not sure if it is the "right" way to do it.
Is it desirable to have the _contains_ function in sage/rings/ideal.py catch the TypeError (silently)?

Yep, in vector spaces:

```
sage: V = QQ^1
sage: W = V.subspace([0])
sage: W.coordinates(0)
[]
sage: W.coordinates(1)
TypeError
```

We could just reimplement ` coordinates(self, x)` as 

```python
def coordinates(self, x):
     K = self.number_field()
     V, from_V, to_V = K.absolute_vector_space()
     return self.free_module().coordinates(to_V(K(x)))
```
