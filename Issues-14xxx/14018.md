```
With my setup I get this pretty often:

```
The Sage installation tree has moved
from /waste/cn/sage-5.6
  to //waste/cn/sage-5.6
Updating various hardcoded paths...
```
Source of the confusion appears to be an extra symbolic link `/jehova -> /` (that I need if I want to follow the link through an nfs share):

```
cn@jehova:/waste/cn> ll -d sage*
lrwxrwxrwx 1 cn users   25 Jan 26 13:19 sage -> /jehova/waste/cn/sage-5.6
drwxr-xr-x 8 cn users 4096 Jan 26 14:45 sage-5.6
cn@jehova:/waste/cn> ll -d /jehova
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 1 Jan 10  2009 /jehova -> /
```
The attached patch uses `os.path.samefile` for path comparison and fixes this.

It seems that `bash` treats `//` different from `/`:

```
jdemeyer@sage:/$ cd //
jdemeyer@sage://$ pwd
//
```

So it seems to be a feature rather than a bug.  It only happens for the root though:

```
jdemeyer@sage:/$ cd /usr//bin
jdemeyer@sage:/usr/bin$ pwd
/usr/bin

Indeed, a google search reveals [from  http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2012/Nov/141 ]

  The following quote is from IEEE Std 1003.1, 2004 Edition:

    A pathname consisting of a single slash shall resolve to the root
    directory of the process. A null pathname shall not be successfully
resolved. A pathname that begins with two successive slashes may be
    interpreted in an implementation-defined manner, although more than
    two leading slashes shall be treated as a single slash.

  http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/000095399/basedefs/xbd_chap04.html#tag_04_11

I think this means that processes **can** choose to interpret "`//whatever`" in some special, unforeseeable way. But this doesn't happen on my system where "`os.path.samefile(...)`" correctly verifies the identity between the two locations. So I think my patch is doing the right thing here.

But `/jehova` **does** resolve to `/`, not `//`. 
It seems `pwd` is to blame here:

```
cn@jehova:/waste/cn/sage> pwd
/waste/cn/sage
cn@jehova:/waste/cn/sage> pwd -L
/waste/cn/sage
cn@jehova:/waste/cn/sage> pwd -P
//waste/cn/sage-5.6
```
But maybe this is `HIS` way to let me know, that `HE` doesn't want to point to '/', either...

I wonder why `./sage` uses the `-P` variant:

```
# Make SAGE_ROOT absolute
SAGE_ROOT=`cd "$SAGE_ROOT" && pwd -P`
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo >&2 "$0: cannot determine SAGE_ROOT directory"
    exit 1
fi
```
Probably this is normalizing the path somehow, which is probably a good thing and shouldn't be changed.

The real question is if there is a problem with using 'os.path.samefile' in 'sage-location'. According to the python docs that function only works under unix but that probably covers all Sage supported platforms for the foreseeable future, doesn't it?

I'm just using a plain 'cd'

```
