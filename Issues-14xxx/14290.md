Running doctests from within Sage results in any test that has output failing.  For example:

```
sage: run_doctests(sage.algebras.algebra)
Doctesting /Users/roed/sage/sage-5.9.beta0/devel/sage/sage/algebras/algebra.py
Running doctests with ID 2013-03-17-01-02-17-09f21e8e.
Doctesting 1 file.
sage -t /Users/roed/sage/sage-5.9.beta0/devel/sage/sage/algebras/algebra.py
**********************************************************************

**********************************************************************
File "/Users/roed/sage/sage-5.9.beta0/devel/sage/sage/algebras/algebra.py", line 31, in sage.algebras.algebra.is_Algebra
Failed example:
    sig_on_count()
Expected:

Got:
    0
**********************************************************************
1 item had failures:
   2 of   4 in sage.algebras.algebra.is_Algebra
    [3 tests, 2 failures, 0.1 s]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage -t /Users/roed/sage/sage-5.9.beta0/devel/sage/sage/algebras/algebra.py  # 2 doctests failed
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Total time for all tests: 0.1 seconds
    cpu time: 0.1 seconds
    cumulative wall time: 0.1 seconds
```

This is the result of IPython coloring the output.

Positive review to your patch. 

I still think that it would be nice to have a note added to the diff that there were ansi escape sequences, since they don't get printed and you are otherwise just left with two identical strings which makes it non-obvious why the doctest failed. So I rescued that piece of the patch from #14359.

That is not a color code but smm = "turn meta on". Most likely coming from readline if you have the wrong TERM set. 

I'll update the patch to generate better diagnostic for escape sequences.

**Attachment:** [trac_14290_ansi_escapes_indication.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket14290/trac_14290_ansi_escapes_indication.patch.gz)

The updated patch now makes all escape sequences visible (and doctestable):

```
EXAMPLES::

    sage: print 'This ist \x1b[1mbold\x1b[0m text'
    This ist <CSI-1m>bold<CSI-0m> text
```

What does `CSI` mean? I prefer to use `ESC` always.

Also, are you sure want to mess with `\x9b`? I think that won't go well with UTF-8.
