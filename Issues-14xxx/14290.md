Running doctests from within Sage results in any test that has output failing.  For example:

```
sage: run_doctests(sage.algebras.algebra)
Doctesting /Users/roed/sage/sage-5.9.beta0/devel/sage/sage/algebras/algebra.py
Running doctests with ID 2013-03-17-01-02-17-09f21e8e.
Doctesting 1 file.
sage -t /Users/roed/sage/sage-5.9.beta0/devel/sage/sage/algebras/algebra.py
**********************************************************************
File "/Users/roed/sage/sage-5.9.beta0/devel/sage/sage/algebras/algebra.py", line 29, in sage.algebras.algebra.is_Algebra
Failed example:
    is_Algebra(R)
Expected:
    True
Got:
    True
**********************************************************************
File "/Users/roed/sage/sage-5.9.beta0/devel/sage/sage/algebras/algebra.py", line 31, in sage.algebras.algebra.is_Algebra
Failed example:
    sig_on_count()
Expected:
    0
Got:
    0
**********************************************************************
1 item had failures:
   2 of   4 in sage.algebras.algebra.is_Algebra
    [3 tests, 2 failures, 0.1 s]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage -t /Users/roed/sage/sage-5.9.beta0/devel/sage/sage/algebras/algebra.py  # 2 doctests failed
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Total time for all tests: 0.1 seconds
    cpu time: 0.1 seconds
    cumulative wall time: 0.1 seconds
```

This is the result of IPython coloring the output.

Concerning escapes: on OS X 10.8 I am seeing

```
\e[?1034h
```
(where `\e` stands for the escape character).
Could you also check for this code (no idea what it does).

That is not a color code but smm = "turn meta on". Most likely coming from readline if you have the wrong TERM set. 

I'll update the patch to generate better diagnostic for escape sequences.

The updated patch now makes all escape sequences visible (and doctestable):

```
EXAMPLES::

    sage: print 'This ist \x1b[1mbold\x1b[0m text'
    This ist <CSI-1m>bold<CSI-0m> text
```

What does `CSI` mean? I prefer to use `ESC` always.

Also, are you sure want to mess with `\x9b`? I think that won't go well with UTF-8.
