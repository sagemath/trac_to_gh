Running doctests from within Sage results in any test that has output failing.  For example:

```
sage: run_doctests(sage.algebras.algebra)
Doctesting /Users/roed/sage/sage-5.9.beta0/devel/sage/sage/algebras/algebra.py
Running doctests with ID 2013-03-17-01-02-17-09f21e8e.

This is the result of IPython coloring the output.

**Attachment:** [trac_14290_ansi_escapes_indication.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket14290/trac_14290_ansi_escapes_indication.patch)

The updated patch now makes all escape sequences visible (and doctestable):

```
EXAMPLES::

    sage: print 'This ist \x1b[1mbold\x1b[0m text'
    This ist <CSI-1m>bold<CSI-0m> text
```

What does `CSI` mean? I prefer to use `ESC` always.

Also, are you sure want to mess with `\x9b`? I think that won't go well with UTF-8.
