Running doctests from within Sage results in any test that has output failing.  For example:

```

Running doctests with ID 2013-03-17-01-02-17-09f21e8e.

Positive review to your patch. 

I still think that it would be nice to have a note added to the diff that there were ansi escape sequences, since they don't get printed and you are otherwise just left with two identical strings which makes it non-obvious why the doctest failed. So I rescued that piece of the patch from #14359.

Attachment [trac_14290_ansi_escapes_indication.patch](tarball://root/attachments/some-uuid/ticket14290/trac_14290_ansi_escapes_indication.patch) by @vbraun created at 2013-03-28 14:14:31

The updated patch now makes all escape sequences visible (and doctestable):

```
EXAMPLES::

    sage: print 'This ist \x1b[1mbold\x1b[0m text'
    This ist <CSI-1m>bold<CSI-0m> text
```

What does `CSI` mean? I prefer to use `ESC` always.

Also, are you sure want to mess with `\x9b`? I think that won't go well with UTF-8.
