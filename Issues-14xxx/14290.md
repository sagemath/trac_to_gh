Running doctests from within Sage results in any test that has output failing.  For example:

```
sage: run_doctests(sage.algebras.algebra)
Doctesting /Users/roed/sage/sage-5.9.beta0/devel/sage/sage/algebras/algebra.py
Running doctests with ID 2013-03-17-01-02-17-09f21e8e.
Doctesting 1 file.

The updated patch now makes all escape sequences visible (and doctestable):

```
EXAMPLES::

    sage: print 'This ist \x1b[1mbold\x1b[0m text'
    This ist <CSI-1m>bold<CSI-0m> text
