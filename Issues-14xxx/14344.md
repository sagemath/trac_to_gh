Here is a request from a [sage-devel thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/sage-devel/cffoTAv0Zxo):

```

The following test fails because I have some optional packages installed - 

$ sage -t  --long -force_lib devel/sage/sage/misc/package.py 
sage -t --long -force_lib "devel/sage/sage/misc/package.py" 
********************************************************************** 
File "/home/rajeev/software/general/sage/devel/sage/sage/misc/package.py", 
line 119: 
    sage: install_package() 
Expected: 
    ['atlas...', 'blas...', ...] 
Got: 
    ['PyQt_x11-4.9.1.p0', 'atlas-3.8.4.p1', 'blas-20070724', 
'boehm_gc-7.2.alpha6.p2', 'boost-cropped-1.34.1', 
```

The consensus seemed to be simply adding more ellipses.

```
> Just add periods *before* 'atlas...' as well. 

And after it (between 'atlas...' and 'blas...'), just in case. Maybe something like

        ['atlas...', ..., 'python...', ...]
 
This is a better idea, IMO. 
```

How's this patch?

The filter thing I posted on sage-devel is semantically nicer, IMO, but I agree it looks pretty ugly and hard to read in Python, and this test isn't exactly run in a tight loop so performance is sort of irrelevant :)
