This might be sporadic, but if you don't have tikz installed on your systems, then initializing a graph will break latex:

```
sage: view(matrix(GF(3), [1])) # works fine
sage: DiGraph(2) # adds '\usetikzlibrary{arrows,shapes}' to the preamble of all subsequent tex files
sage: view(matrix(GF(3), [1])) # is now broken
```

I suppose that you can't plot a graph without having tikz installed...? But this is not what the ticket is about:

It says, if you initialize a graph within a session, then it will break all your latex files for any other object you will initialize in the same session.
