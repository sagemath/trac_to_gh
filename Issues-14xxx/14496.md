In sage 5.8, one can find the gaussian q-binomial coefficients in (at least) **three** places :

- sage.combinat.sf.kfpoly.q_bin
- sage.combinat.q_analogues.q_binomial
- sage.rings.arith.gaussian_binomial

The syntax is not quite the same for q_bin as for the two others.

Some timings:

```
sage: timeit("sage.combinat.sf.kfpoly.q_bin(7,5)")
625 loops, best of 3: 819 µs per loop
sage: timeit("sage.combinat.q_analogues.q_binomial(12,5)")
625 loops, best of 3: 1.12 ms per loop
sage: timeit("sage.rings.arith.gaussian_binomial(12,5)")  
625 loops, best of 3: 294 µs per loop
```
The parents :

```
sage: sage.combinat.sf.kfpoly.q_bin(7,5).parent()
Fraction Field of Univariate Polynomial Ring in t over Integer Ring
sage: sage.combinat.q_analogues.q_binomial(12,5).parent()
Univariate Polynomial Ring in q over Integer Ring
sage: sage.rings.arith.gaussian_binomial(12,5).parent()
Fraction Field of Univariate Polynomial Ring in q over Integer Ring
```
The behaviour with an added integer parameter

```
sage: sage.combinat.sf.kfpoly.q_bin(7,5,2)               
114429029715
sage: sage.combinat.q_analogues.q_binomial(12,5,2)
DOES NOT WORK
sage: sage.rings.arith.gaussian_binomial(12,5,2)    
114429029715
```
The behaviour with a polynomial parameter

```
sage: w=polygen(ZZ,'w')
sage: sage.combinat.sf.kfpoly.q_bin(4,2,w)
w^8 + w^7 + 2*w^6 + 2*w^5 + 3*w^4 + 2*w^3 + 2*w^2 + w + 1
sage: sage.combinat.q_analogues.q_binomial(6,2,w)   
w^8 + w^7 + 2*w^6 + 2*w^5 + 3*w^4 + 2*w^3 + 2*w^2 + w + 1
sage: sage.rings.arith.gaussian_binomial(6,2,w) 
w^8 + w^7 + 2*w^6 + 2*w^5 + 3*w^4 + 2*w^3 + 2*w^2 + w + 1
sage: sage.combinat.sf.kfpoly.q_bin(4,2,w).parent()             
Univariate Polynomial Ring in w over Integer Ring
sage: sage.combinat.q_analogues.q_binomial(6,2,w).parent()      
Univariate Polynomial Ring in w over Integer Ring
sage: sage.rings.arith.gaussian_binomial(6,2,w).parent()        
Fraction Field of Univariate Polynomial Ring in w over Integer Ring
```

Maybe it would be better to have a single function ?

Here is already a seemingly faster function. There remains to deprecate the two others. The most annoying one is q_bin, with a different syntax and with a global variable inside.

But `n//d` can causes problems if `q` takes a real value, and similarly in some other cases.  Perhaps this should be a "`try:`", with the exception giving `n/d` or even `gaussian_binomial(n, k)(q)`.  [It is surely not necessary to introduce `var` when this occurs before.]

I also don't like the way (inherited from the existing code) that `n` plays two very different rôles; the line

```
        n = prod([1 - q**i for i in range(n-k+1,n+1)])
```
is particularly bad style.  It would make the code more readable to call them "`numerator`" and "`denominator`" (possibly abbreviated)

Here is a new version of the patch. I have modified the names d and n and introduced a try statement. I am not sure what kind of exceptions I need to catch.


Still it remains to choose if one keeps the gaussian_binomial or rather the q_binomial function.

1. There's a doctest failure at line 341 of `sage/combinat/sf/kfpoly.py`.  I don't know what's being computed here, so I don't know what's going wrong.

2.  I thought the standard spacing was as

```
def gaussian_binomial(n, k, q=None): 
```

3. I think `TypeError` is enough; I never saw anything else when I was testing your code.

4. Is it intentional not to alter `sage/combinat/q_analogues.py` ?

So it's nearly ready for a positive review.

Here is a new patch. 

Point 1 is indeed a problem. I do not understand either what is computed in the weight function. The procedure q_bin was returning 1 for any negative values of n and any k. This is not a very natural behaviour.

Point 4 : I have chosen that the name to be kept would be q_binomial.

There is another problem remaining. The existing algorithm in sage.combinat.q_analogues uses cyclotomic polynomials and become faster than the naive one when the arguments are big (and of similar size ?), but is much slower in some cases (when n is small or k is small ?).

```
sage: timeit("sage.combinat.q_analogues.q_binomial(85,3)")
625 loops, best of 3: 246 µs per loop
sage: timeit("sage.combinat.q_analogues.q_binomial_via_cyclotomic(85,3)")
125 loops, best of 3: 2.78 ms per loop
sage: timeit("sage.combinat.q_analogues.q_binomial(85,43)")               
25 loops, best of 3: 9.21 ms per loop
sage: timeit("sage.combinat.q_analogues.q_binomial_via_cyclotomic(85,43)")
25 loops, best of 3: 8.18 ms per loop
```
So one needs to keep both and find a strategy of choice..

I'll take a look at why the weight function in SF fails; but the best way to fix it is in the weight, have a check for negative `n` or `k` and just circumvent the call to `q_binomial()` and return 1.

As for the speed of the naive vs. cyclotomic polys, I would pick a cutoff value which you think is about the breakeven point(s) for the two, and call which ever function is faster based on that.

Also, have you tried implementing it by computing the q-binomial, then substituting in a user defined `q` value to the result (in particular, have you compared the speed)?

Some timings were given in the ticket #13166

According to my own timings, it seems that for n <= ~ 78 the naive algorithm is faster than the cyclotomic algorithm for computing the gaussian polynomial.

I get much the same.  For `gaussian_binomial(2*k, k)` I found the naive method faster for `k < 30`, and the cyclotomic method faster for `k > 30'.

One point about the naive method:

```
sage: %timeit gaussian_binomial(50, 4)
1000 loops, best of 3: 287 µs per loop
sage: %timeit gaussian_binomial(50, 46)
100 loops, best of 3: 3.41 ms per loop
```
Since the code contains two loops of length `k`, it's obviously better to evaluate `gaussian_binomial(n, k)` as `gaussian_binomial(n, n-k)` if `k > n/2`.

Here is a new patch

* using the minimum of k and n-k in the naive algo

* implementing the following strategy :

if n <= 70 or k <= N/4 or q is not a polynomial, use the naive algo

otherwise use the cyclotomic algo

I have found this strategy using some timings (I only timed the polynomial case).

Hey Frederic and Francis,

I've uploaded a review patch which does two things I wanted, an input for the algorithm and handling objects which may not have division (by computing it using a formal variable and then substituting in `q`). If you're happy with my changes, feel free to set this to a positive review.

Best,

ah, well, sorry. 

This is because I defined an alias in an incorrect way, using
`gaussian_binomial = q_binomial`

But what is the correct way ?

There are two workarounds I can see:

1. Put the reference in a place that isn't duplicated such as at the module level.
2. Write in `gaussian_binomial()` which calls `q_binomial()` and it's doc just says "see `q_binomial()`"

Option 2 is more work and less clean IMO. Option 1 isn't perfect to me either but is the lesser of 2 evils. Up to you; either way would be okay with me.

Hey Frederic,

Two minor things on the doc for `gaussian_binomial()`:

- There should be periods '.' at the end of the sentences.
- The 'this function' is slightly ambiguous to me, I would explicitly put <code>:func:\`q_binomial()\`</code> to avoid this.

Otherwise I'm also happy with the patch. Thanks.
