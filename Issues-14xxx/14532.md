Hello!

Sry for comming back at you so late. I had some other stuff lately!

Anways, the code looks fine (read it, run it, and obviously run sage -t) I only have two remarks.

1. Maybe we should check if d is even and also nonzero (perhaps >= 2) since that is also a invalid parameter.

2. I would change the line  

```
 Graph([map(tuple,PV), lambda x,y:V(x)*(M*V(y)) == 0], loops = False) 
}}} to

{{{
{{{
 Graph((map(tuple,PV), lambda x,y:V(x)*(M*V(y)) == 0), loops = False) 
}}} 
}}}

which should be 2x faster.

Best,

Jernej

Done

`O_o`

Here is what I get when I change it : 

```
sage: graphs.SymplecticGraph(4,4)         
...
NetworkXError: Input is not a known data type for conversion.
```

But what do you think it should do, and why do you think that it should be 2x faster ? `O_o`

I may be shooting random nonsense of course but in general it is much better to not create lists [] but iterators (). Since in the former case a list has to first be created (1 for loop) and then iterated over (2 for loop). Example

```
sage: %timeit max((i for i in xrange(100)))
100000 loops, best of 3: 14.5 us per loop
sage: %timeit max([i for i in xrange(100)])
10000 loops, best of 3: 30 us per loop
```

and even faster in this case would be

```
sage: %timeit 99
1000000 loops, best of 3: 429 ns per loo
```

Yepyep but no list is created in this case. A list of size 2 is given to the Graph constructor : the first element is a list of vertices, the second element is a function that gives adjacent pairs.

In this case the patch is ofc OK. If I were to do this I would make the additional test check (since we're already doing them) but its fine as is as well.

Helloooooooo !

> maybe Sage should have "polar space" graphs in general, not, only symplectic ones?

Well, yes it would be nice indeed, but I do not know how to build them. I guess that it only takes 5~6 lines, like for the symplectic ones, but I don't know which ones. Actually, I have no idea on earth what these graphs are, except what I could read (and understand, which is even less) from Brouwer's website.

http://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/graphs/srg/srgtab.html

I believe I created what he calls a `VO^-` graph (`graphs.BrouwerHaemersGraph`), and the same code worked for different parameters but I was not able to make it work in characteristic two, and so I did not write this more general patch.

If you know how to make it work, I would be glad to see it in Sage too `:-P`

To construct these, you need to be able to create the corresponding forms, which are well-studied by group theory, as they lead to finite classical groups. GAP has code to create these forms; it's not completely trivial in characteristic two. You can actually just call GAP!
E.g.

```
gap> Display(InvariantQuadraticForm(GO(1,6,2)).matrix);
 . 1 . . . .
 . . . . . .
 . . . 1 . .
 . . . . . .
 . . . . . 1
 . . . . . .
gap> Display(InvariantQuadraticForm(GO(-1,6,2)).matrix);
 . 1 . . . .
 . . . . . .
 . . 1 1 . .
 . . . 1 . .
 . . . . . 1
 . . . . . .
gap> Display(InvariantSesquilinearForm(GU(6,2)).matrix);
 . . . . . 1
 . . . . 1 .
 . . . 1 . .
 . . 1 . . .
 . 1 . . . .
 1 . . . . .
gap> Display(InvariantBilinearForm(Sp(6,3)).matrix);
 . . . . . 1
 . . . . 1 .
 . . . 1 . .
 . . 2 . . .

Isn't it obvious? All these graphs you construct lately have huge automorphism groups, often arc-transitive and/or distance-transitive.
