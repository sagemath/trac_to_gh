<a id='comment:9'></a>Dear Prof.Stefan,

I have implemented the matroid union (for 2 matroids) using Rank Matroid.The rank function I used is
rank_(M1UM2)(X) = max ( |Y|+rM2(X)) where Y belongs to M1 intersection M2*, Y subset of X

```
def MatroidUnion(M0,M1):

	#Constructing matroid union from two matroids
	#rank(X) = max ( |Y| + rM2(X) ) where Y subset of X, and Y belongs to M0 \cap M1.dual()

	common_ground_set = M0.groundset()
	common_ground_set = common_ground_set.union(M1.groundset())

	def f(X):
		ground_set = common_ground_set.intersection(X)
		delSet = common_ground_set-ground_set

		def h(X):
			return M0.rank(set(X).intersection(M0.groundset()))

		#Extending matroid M0 to the union of groundsets
		I0 = RankMatroid(groundset=common_ground_set,rank_function=h)

		def g(X):
			return M1.rank(set(X).intersection(M1.groundset()))

		#Extending matroid M1 to the  union of groundsets
		I1 = RankMatroid(groundset=common_ground_set,rank_function=g)

		#Restricting matroid M0 to set X
		I0 = I0.delete(delSet)

		#Taking M1 dual and restricting to set X
		I1 = I1.dual()
		I1 = I1.delete(delSet)

		# rank(X) = max ( |Y| + rM2(X) ) where Y subset of X, and Y belongs to I0 \cap I1
		r1 = len(I0.intersection(I1))
		r2 = M1.rank(set(X).intersection(M1.groundset()))
		return r1+r2


	return RankMatroid(groundset=common_ground_set,rank_function=f)
```

This works just fine. What are your comments on this?
I plan to implement MatroidUnion for any no.of matroids, by calling MatriodUnion for 2 matroids each time.

Thanks!
