cython does not write out make rules for dependencies, like other code-processors to.
this complicates dependency tracking a lot.

this is a known bug, http://trac.cython.org/cython_trac/ticket/655

my patch (minimal changes required in frontend) might need some scrubbing, but it works well for me.

i dont like -MF either (does it violate POSIX?), but thats what gcc (and others) do. -M is something else -- related but different -- and will cause confusion. there are even other -M[A-Z] options that might be useful. i would just stick to long options, if they didn't waste so much space...

gcc writes exactly one space character. i will do it like that, as it minimizes wrapping.

MF is at least not politically correct.

Well, that's `cython`, not GCC, and Cython (so far) uses either single-letter short options or long options, so one day<sup>TM</sup> `-MF` might get interpreted as `-M -F`, with a different meaning.

> -M is something else -- related but different


It just outputs the dependencies to `stdout`.

Oh, you're right; we're writing just (escaped single-line) dependencies as opposed to receipts.

Exactly, that's why i dont like it. on second thought it cannot cause problems, if -MF (gcc) translates to -F (cython, unused) and -M (gcc) will be implemented as -M (on cython side, currently unused).

> > but thats what gcc (and others) do.

clearly, -MF will be interpreted as -M -F but not with a different meaning.
For gcc "-M -MF <file>" is also equal to "-MF <file>". thats the same with the other -M[A-Z] options as far as i can see.

I would favor wasting the -F short option to implement gcc-style, rather than choosing new option names for well established functionality. but my patch needs to reflect that, and allow "-F" as well.

unfortunately i'm not the one who will decide, so i will have to contact upstream about it.

See also `man 3 getopt` (and for the GNU version, especially `POSIXLY_CORRECT` ;-) )

I leave that to your interpretation.

Note that GNU `cpp` / `gcc` / `g++` do not accept `-MF <outputfile>` alone; you have to also give `-M` or `-MM` in addition.

(And you'd probably also have to support `-FM ...`, and ignore `-F`.)

Indeed. Particularly I am wrong in post number 5 about the gcc options.
-MM is be not very much needed nor useful, so defaulting to -M might be sufferable.

> (And you'd probably also have to support `-FM ...`, and ignore `-F`.)


-FM sets the output filename to "M", standalone -F will not require one of -M and -MM. if there is no -MM, it should just be equivalent to -MF...

(I'm getting closer, thanks for your help)
