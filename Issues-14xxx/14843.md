```
Here is a patch that introduces these two minor improvements to 4ti2 interface:
-It allows to pass the lattice to the methods instead of the matrix, using the lat parmeter.
-Changes the verbose default to False, so we only get the output.

Example:

```
sage: four_ti_2.graver(lat=[[1,2,3],[1,1,1]])
[ 1  0 -1]
[ 0  1  2]
[ 1  1  1]
[ 2  1  0]
```

Do you mean #13498?

In my case, 4ti2 spkg compiled without complaining... but it didn't detect GMP, and hence, didn't build the 4ti2gmp binary (which is used, for instance, by the groebner binary).

In order to use it, i had to link my system-wide 4ti2gmp to $SAGE/local/bin

The work on the interface to `4ti2` ought to be based on the version 1.6, for 1.3 is very old. Thus I made the ticket dependent on #15172, and attached the corresponding rebased patch.

It seems that `lat=` only makes sense for `zsolve`, but not for `qsolve`, `circuits`, `rays`. This is confirmed by the doctests as well as by the source code comments. Please rectify this.

I can't reproduce this, I just tried installing 4ti2 on the latest Sage beta (on 64-bit Fedora Linux), and got it all there:

```
sage-6.3.beta6/local/bin]$ ls -l 4ti*
-rwxr-xr-x 1 dimpase tcs-staff 55501 Jul 25 16:17 4ti2gmp
-rwxr-xr-x 1 dimpase tcs-staff 55553 Jul 25 16:17 4ti2int32
-rwxr-xr-x 1 dimpase tcs-staff 55553 Jul 25 16:17 4ti2int64
```

please look into your install log to see is something has failed...

PS. It also works for me on OSX 10.9.4.

hmm, do you know where the log is ?

found in the log:

4ti2 will be built without support for arbitrary-precision computations.
