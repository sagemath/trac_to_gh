```
Here is a patch that introduces these two minor improvements to 4ti2 interface:
-It allows to pass the lattice to the methods instead of the matrix, using the lat parmeter.
-Changes the verbose default to False, so we only get the output.

Example:

```
sage: four_ti_2.graver(lat=[[1,2,3],[1,1,1]])
[ 1  0 -1]
[ 0  1  2]
[ 1  1  1]
[ 2  1  0]
```

Just curious:  Is anyone of you working on fixing (/upgrading) the optional 4ti2 spkg?

(IIRC there's a ticket for doing so, but I don't recall right now.)

In my case, 4ti2 spkg compiled without complaining... but it didn't detect GMP, and hence, didn't build the 4ti2gmp binary (which is used, for instance, by the groebner binary).

In order to use it, i had to link my system-wide 4ti2gmp to $SAGE/local/bin

The work on the interface to `4ti2` ought to be based on the version 1.6, for 1.3 is very old. Thus I made the ticket dependent on #15172, and attached the corresponding rebased patch.

It seems that `lat=` only makes sense for `zsolve`, but not for `qsolve`, `circuits`, `rays`. This is confirmed by the doctests as well as by the source code comments. Please rectify this.
