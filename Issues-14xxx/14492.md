Because of several backward incompatible internal changes in Sage (e.g., removing SAGE_DATA and moving it to SAGE_SHARE), the current version of the optional group cohomology package `p_group_cohomology` did not work.

Moreover, tmp_dir used to return a string, but now it also creates a directory; for this reason, many tests failed.

And also some random generators (in GAP?) seem to have changed. For this reason, some ring presentations have changed (i.e., the rings are isomorphic, but a different presentation is obtained with an old or with a new Sage version). Hence, doctests needed to change.

In any case: The new group cohomology spkg copes with these changes. However, it will therefore *not* work with old Sage versions.

__Further implementation changes__

* Since this spkg *is* the upstream source, the source code is still contained in the mercurial repository. Change: Now, mercurial queues are used (this made it a bit easier for me to manage the changes while developing).
* urllib2 is used, which to me seems to work a bit better than urllib.
* The new version uses `os.path.join` and `os.path.split`, rather than string concatenation using a non-portable path separator `'/'`.
* The old version had a bug related with pickling: In order to keep the data base created by a user separate from the data base that is shared by all users of an installation, soft links were used. But when one saves new data into a file that used to be the name of a soft link, one should unlink the link first. This is fixed in the new version.
* The protocol output has changed. In a typical cohomology computation, several cohomology rings are involved (the ring to-be-computed, the cohomology ring of a Sylow subgroup, or of a maximal elementary abelian subgroup, etc). The new protocol output tells in which ring the current computation happens.

__Change of algorithms__

The first change: If no new relation has been found in degree n-1, then a *complete* Gröbner basis of the relation ideal is computed, even if a completeness criterion can not be applied yet. This simple change reduces the computation time for the mod-3 cohomology of J3 by several days.

The second change: By mistake, the old version would attempt to prove completeness with the Hilbert-Poincaré criterion, even if the Symonds criterion has already shown that the ring is incomplete. Now, the Hilbert-Poincaré criterion is only used if the Symonds criterion has not been conclusive.

The third change: In the old version, it was first tested that the current ring approximation contains parameters for the complete cohomology ring, and then such parameters have been constructed using the relations in the ring approximation. These relations can be rather complicated. Therefore, we now compute parameters via restriction to maximal elementary abelian subgroups. It is known that a set of elements of the ring approximation yields parameters for the cohomology ring, if and only if the cohomology of the maximal elementary abelian subgroups is finite over the restriction of these elements.

Hence, we can detect parameters even if the ring approximation is far from being complete, and we can compute in rings that are much easier to deal with. By consequence, it is now in most cases possible to prove completeness by the Symonds criterion, which relies on the explicit construction of parameters in small degrees. Our other criteria, which are able to use an *existence proof* for parameters of small degrees (without the need of their explicit construction) are of course still part of the package, but it became difficult to show examples in which they are actually used.

__New features__

There is no substantially new functionality. However, depending on how fast the reviewing goes, I could imagine to soon add a method so that `gap(H)` returns an algebra in the GAP interface, isomorphic to a cohomology ring H.

I did not test the package on OS X yet, but only on my `openSuse` laptop.

The new package version should be able to compute the mod-3 cohomology of the third Janko group without manual intervention, but the verification will take a couple of more days.

In any case, it needs review!

Hm. This should work. But there is something much more urgent concerning "should work":

I tested the package on my laptop by running the test script explicitly, which worked. But When I run it as part of the installation procedure (i.e., by `export SAGE_CHECK=yes` before `sage -i ...`), I get a *total* failure! There was not even a single test that passed.

Reason:

```
sage-runtests: error: no such option: -o
list index out of range
Usage: sage -t [options] filenames
```

I don't know where the "-o" comes from. To be investigated.

Aha. So, here I check against an error that is supposed to occur in certain settings. Hm.

I don't understand why the result is just a blank line, not the error that is actually due in this case. The line preceding this test removes the existing cohomology ring from memory but not from disk; and a computation from scratch should then fail, because it does not like to find the data in a location in which new data are supposed to be written.

Aha, now I think I understand what is happening!

The output looks as if you did not run the test suite (by `export SAGE_CHECK=yes` before installing the package), but you did run `sage -t` on the source files (or on their copies in local/lib/python/site-packages).

The test suite considers each doc string separately. Hence, it recursively finds out which modules, classes functions and methods are defined, extracts the doc of one item after the other, each time writing one doc string into a temporary file, and running sage -t on this temporary file. But it is *not* supposed to run sage -t on, say, `pGroupcCohomology/factory.py`.

Reason: The doc tests are supposed to demonstrate how the different sub-problems of cohomology computations are done. Hence, in the vast majority of cases, we want a computation from scratch. But if the first test puts a result into the cache, then the second test might be disturbed.

Example: One test creates the computational set-up for the cohomology of the `SmallGroup(8,3)` (that's the dihedral group) from scratch, but does *not* complete the computation. This test will create an item in the cache that is only computed out to degree zero. Another test might then demonstrate that some *completely* computed cohomology rings can be found in the data base, accessible by, say, `CohomologyRing(8,3)`.

However, the factory `CohomologyRing` would first try to find the result in the cache, before accessing the data base on disk or in internet. Hence, it will return the degree-zero approximation of the ring. This explains why you got

It can not be part of the sage library, since it strongly depends on the Small Groups library, which can only be in an optional package, since it is not GPL.

But before you set it to positive review: Could you see if my spkg-install script is correct? As I have stated above, it happened to me (in preliminary versions) that there was a compilation error, but the installation script happily unpacked the data base and finished by claiming that installation of the package was successful.

Do you actually need anything fancy from the SGL or just the list of the first N groups? I'm getting more annoyed about this stupid licensing issue, so I'll probably write a GPL replacement at one point ;-)

The `spkg_install` looks good to me.

I guess the main reason for using it is: Get a concise identifier of a group with a fixed set of generators.

If I want to know the cohomology of a group G, then I need to consider restrictions to "interesting" subgroups: Maximal p-elementary abelian subgroups; Sylow p-subgroup; normalizer in G of the centre of a Sylow p-subgroup; intersection of two conjugates of a Sylow p-subgroup; ...

If I know the small groups library address of the interesting group, then I can easily look up in my data base whether the cohomology of this particular group has already been computed. Otherwise, I needed to compute the cohomology of multiple isomorphic copies of one group repeatedly.

Mathematically, it would of course be possible to lift the dependency on the small groups library. In fact, if the address in the small groups library can not be found, then a "descriptive" name (that describes the construction of this group) is chosen to access the data base. So, in these cases, my code is independent of the small groups libary.

Making it totally independent would require...
* to rewrite a couple of constructions; this would, in particular, be needed if the use of the small groups library should become optional.
* to totally rewrite the code that accesses my data bases; but actually I would like to use a "real" data base (sql?), so that rewriting will sooner or later be needed anyway.
* to rewrite almost *all* doctests. Since all functions and methods are tested, this would be a long and very annoying task.

So, there is no reason why I saw it happily continue to install the package after a compilation error? Strange.

So, perhaps this is not a problem of my script but a problem of the script of Sage that is called by "sage -i".

I thought this could be it. However, if I put the following into an spkg, then the error is correctly reported, even though the exit code of setup.py is not checked:

spkg-install:

```/usr/bin/env bash

if [ "$SAGE_LOCAL" = "" ]; then
   echo "SAGE_LOCAL undefined ... exiting";
   echo "Maybe run 'sage -sh'?"
   exit 1
fi

# test whether we are on an intel mac
if [ `uname` = "Darwin" -a "$SAGE64" = "yes" ]; then
   echo "64 bit MacIntel"
   DARWIN64=-m64; export DARWIN64;
else
   DARWIN64=""; export DARWIN64;
fi

cd src

DISTUTILS_DEBUG='debug'
python setup.py install
```
src/setup.py

```python
from distutils.core import setup
from distutils.extension import Extension
from Cython.Distutils import build_ext

import shutil
import os
import subprocess

setup(
  name = "bad",
  version = "0.0",
  author = "Simon A. King",
  author_email = "simon.king@uni-jena.de",
  maintainer = "Simon A. King", 
  maintainer_email = "simon.king@uni-jena.de",
  description = "A bad example",
  ext_modules=[ 
    Extension("bad",
              sources = ["bad.pyx"],
              ),
  ],
  cmdclass = {'build_ext': build_ext}
)
```
src/bad.pyx

```python
import os
bad
```

If I remove the last line of src/bad.pyx, then the mock package does install, and I can then do

```
sage: from bad import os
```

The exit code is checked implicitly in `spkg/bin/sage-spkg` because it's simply the last command in the script. Try putting `echo Hello` or something after `python setup.py install` to see the difference.

Originally, my main reason has been to run the tests on a per-method basis, not on a per-file basis. This concerns
- running tests in parallel, 
- the summary of test failures (I would like that the test suite ends with a list of methods whose tests fail or which appear not to be tested)
- execution time for each test

Also I originally wanted to work around some bugs in the sage-coverage script: Sometimes the coverage script could not correctly determine the functions defined in a module.

It could be that in the last three years the doctest and coverage framework of Sage has improved.

I just tested: Meataxe does not build with `MAKE="make -j2`, even if you then say `$MAKE -j1`. Apparently, `$MAKE` is called internally, in some of the makefiles of `MeatAxe`. Since I patch these makefiles, it could be that I am to blame...

They certainly did. I think everything in your list now works correctly, except for the per-method testing and modulo the fact that doctests and coverage are a different script.

I least I understand your motivation now, perhaps you should document this in the `spkg-check` file ("for historical reasons, this reimplements part of the doctest and coverage scripts, but these could (should?) be replaced by calls to the standard doctest and coverage frameworks.")

Computing group cohomology is difficult. Therefore, this package does a lot of effort to recycle previous computations. But in the tests, I typically need to use a fresh computation, for otherwise I couldn't demonstrate the effect of the method being tested.

Therefore, testing on a per module basis won't be easy. I suggest that I will try to find a solution for version 3.0 of the spkg.

I am currently waiting for `pGroupCohomology.factory.unit_test64` to finish with `-O3`, and will later try to compare the result with the other options.

Question: Is it OK to hard-code `OO="-O3"` in the Makefile? Or shall this be at the choice of the user? Is there a default optimization level used by Sage when installing an spkg?

Here are the remaining timings.

```
...
#267: Walltime  50:08.55 min
      CPU-time  24:06.87 min
      Singular   2:51.00 min

```

`OO=-O2`, `extra_compile_args=['-O1']`:

```
...
#267: Walltime  51:33.45 min
      CPU-time  24:48.10 min
      Singular   2:49.59 min
      Gap-time   0:39.57 min
```

`OO=-O2`, `extra_compile_args=['-Os']`:

```
...
#267: Walltime  54:59.40 min
      CPU-time  26:07.43 min
      Singular   2:50.38 min
      Gap-time   0:40.53 min
```

So, at least on my laptop, it seems like a good idea to use -O2 on `MeatAxe` and David Green's programs, while -O3 seems best on the Cython code.

I will now try to incorporate all your remarks and update my spkg accordingly.

It could be that I should improve the Makefiles, but I hope this can be left for the next version.

It has turned out that, with the increased optimization level, the package won't build with old compiler versions (e.g., not with gcc 4.4.5).

Since this spkg version does not seem to be copied to the "official" list of optional spkgs: Is there still time to add a test that makes sure to install the package only when it works with the available gcc? In later versions (but not in 2.1.4 yet), I could imagine to make the optimization level depend on the available compiler.
