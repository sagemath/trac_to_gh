Some fun I came across:

```
sage: int(5) % QQ(2)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-4-8ec0f9994ded> in <module>()
----> 1 int(Integer(5)) % QQ(Integer(2))

TypeError: Argument 'self' has incorrect type (expected sage.rings.rational.Rational, got int)
```

Note that this works:

```
sage: 5 % QQ(2)
1
```

You shouldn't check the type exactly, derived classes of rational should be treated like a rational.

Also, the whole `PY_*` macro usage that you see in the sources is mostly historical, nowadays Cython understands `isinstance(x, Rational)` just fine and this is the preferred form of a type check.
