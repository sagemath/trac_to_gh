(repost from sage-git)

I started some work on the new developer guide covering the git workflow. I created a repository at https://github.com/vbraun/sage-developer-git with a self-contained copy of the docbuild steps, so you can make changes without an extra Sage tree. Once this is in good shape, I'm planning to replace the current developer guide with it. If you want to help let me know and I'll add you to the collaborators. I think this is the quickest way to get off the ground while having all of the usual sphinx extensions at our disposal.

The result is also served as github page at http://vbraun.github.io/sage-developer-git

I would like to review the new doc, but this is really too large.

* In the "Writing Code for Sage" chapter the only thing that is really new are the packaging sections. I removed all mercurial stuff and references to the old file system layout, of course.

* The "Sage Notebook Developer Guide" is unchanged except that I moved general tips&tricks for using git (not specific to the notebook) elsewhere.

The rest is new.
