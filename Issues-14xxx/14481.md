(repost from sage-git)

I started some work on the new developer guide covering the git workflow. I created a repository at https://github.com/vbraun/sage-developer-git with a self-contained copy of the docbuild steps, so you can make changes without an extra Sage tree. Once this is in good shape, I'm planning to replace the current developer guide with it. If you want to help let me know and I'll add you to the collaborators. I think this is the quickest way to get off the ground while having all of the usual sphinx extensions at our disposal.

The result is also served as github page at http://vbraun.github.io/sage-developer-git

I've fixed the warnings. 

I moved sections around to have a coherent document, so it can't be "split into sections". Just read one section at a time. If you want to know how a single file changed then just run, e.g., `git diff master HEAD doctesting.rst`.

Replying to [@robertwb](#comment%3A21):
> What sections are new that actually need to be reviewed (other than vetting the new general layout, which looks fine to me so far, though I think the table of contents is a bit deep on the landing page).

* In the "Writing Code for Sage" chapter the only thing that is really new are the packaging sections. I removed all mercurial stuff and references to the old file system layout, of course.

* The "Sage Notebook Developer Guide" is unchanged except that I moved general tips&tricks for using git (not specific to the notebook) elsewhere.

The rest is new.

The github repo is old, current work is done on the branch on this ticket. Can you rebase your patches?

I've reviewed the first three chapters (not including possible English language issues, given my English level!) and pushed a patch with minor changes to `u/mmezzarobba/dev_guide`. These are only suggestions, I leave it to you to merge them or not.

I agree with Volker's comment that we should get this merged as soon as possible and keep improvements to future tickets.

Commit 67a76032fda3ee140c3bc52422020ef722cbee52 on this ticket **reverted** the documentation changes introduced by #13311. You might want to investigate what happened, I hope that there aren't a lot of tickets from Sage 5.13 which are accidentally reverted in Sage 6.0.
