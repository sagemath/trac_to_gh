(repost from sage-git)

I started some work on the new developer guide covering the git workflow. I created a repository at https://github.com/vbraun/sage-developer-git with a self-contained copy of the docbuild steps, so you can make changes without an extra Sage tree. Once this is in good shape, I'm planning to replace the current developer guide with it. If you want to help let me know and I'll add you to the collaborators. I think this is the quickest way to get off the ground while having all of the usual sphinx extensions at our disposal.

The result is also served as github page at http://vbraun.github.io/sage-developer-git

YOooooooo Volker !

I would like to review the new doc, but this is really too large. It would really help if you could split that for each section or something like that, for keeping trac of everything that happens in [@67a7603](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/67a7603) without any explanation is scary `O_o`

By the way, there are some warnings when I build the developper's doc with.

Replying to [@robertwb](#comment%3A21):
> What sections are new that actually need to be reviewed (other than vetting the new general layout, which looks fine to me so far, though I think the table of contents is a bit deep on the landing page).

* In the "Writing Code for Sage" chapter the only thing that is really new are the packaging sections. I removed all mercurial stuff and references to the old file system layout, of course.

* The "Sage Notebook Developer Guide" is unchanged except that I moved general tips&tricks for using git (not specific to the notebook) elsewhere.

The rest is new.

The github repo is old, current work is done on the branch on this ticket. Can you rebase your patches?
