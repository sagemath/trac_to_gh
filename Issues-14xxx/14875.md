Use the bijection [Knu1973]_ to send ``self`` to a `321`-avoiding
permutation.
```

This reference (to TAOCP III without any further pointer) might not be very helpful. It should specify pp. 60-61. Better, add a reference to 3.1 of http://arxiv.org/abs/0805.1325 which defines it explicitly.

Uploading some modifications, yet far from an actual review. One thing I'm doing is eliminating the dependency on the order of multiplication of permutations.

I don't understand what the aliases here are for (copypasta?):

```
    display=dict(default="list",

                 values=dict(list='displayed as a list',

Hey Darij,

That whole latex option is a copy/paste (copypasta) error and should be removed since there are (currently) no other latex output types.

Also if we review this before #12453, I can easily commute the patches.

Thanks,

Uploaded my review patch. Please look over it as I'm not 100% sure I always caught your correct intentions.

I took the freedom to remove `def is_a_prefix` (and replace all reference to it by ones to `is_a`), since it was doing precisely the same thing as `def is_a`. This might theoretically have caused some issues in other places, but at least the sage/combinat/*.py files doctest correctly (I have only done `./sage -bt devel/sage-main/sage/combinat`; for doctesting the whole library I don't have the time right now).

Why did you remove the `an_element()` doctests?

Yes, please commute this ante #12453, as I don't feel I have very much to say about Cython structs.
