Uploading some modifications, yet far from an actual review. One thing I'm doing is eliminating the dependency on the order of multiplication of permutations.

I don't understand what the aliases here are for (copypasta?):

```
    display=dict(default="list",
                 description='Specifies how Dyck words should be printed',
                 values=dict(list='displayed as a list',
                             lattice='displayed on the lattice defined by ``diagram_style``'),
                 alias=dict(exp="exp_low", compact="compact_low", array="diagram",
                           ferrers_diagram="diagram", young_diagram="diagram"),

Hey Darij,

That whole latex option is a copy/paste (copypasta) error and should be removed since there are (currently) no other latex output types.

Also if we review this before #12453, I can easily commute the patches.

Thanks,

Travis

Uploaded my review patch. Please look over it as I'm not 100% sure I always caught your correct intentions.

I took the freedom to remove `def is_a_prefix` (and replace all reference to it by ones to `is_a`), since it was doing precisely the same thing as `def is_a`. This might theoretically have caused some issues in other places, but at least the sage/combinat/*.py files doctest correctly (I have only done `./sage -bt devel/sage-main/sage/combinat`; for doctesting the whole library I don't have the time right now).

Why did you remove the `an_element()` doctests?

Yes, please commute this ante #12453, as I don't feel I have very much to say about Cython structs.

Hey Darij,

Thanks for doing the full review. I commuted it past #12453, folded in your review patch so I could make one small change of making `is_a_prefix` a deprecated function alias of `is_a`.
