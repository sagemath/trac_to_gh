Helloooooooooooooooo !

This patch is nice ! It adds in Sage the list of smallgraphs used in ISGCI [1], which can now be obtained like that :

```
sage: d = graph_classes.smallgraphs()
sage: d['P_5']                                                                                                                                                           
Graph on 5 vertices
sage: d['P_5'].is_isomorphic(graphs.PathGraph(5))
True
```

Now that we have this information, we can do another veeeeeeery nice thing : write a generic recognition algorithm for graph classes defined by a list of forbidden subgraphs.

```
    sage: g = graphs.PetersenGraph()                                                                                                                                      
    sage: g in graph_classes.ClawFree                                                                                                                                     
    False                                                                                                                                                                 
    sage: g.line_graph() in graph_classes.ClawFree                                                                                                                        
    True                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
    sage: gc = graph_classes.get_class("gc_441")                                                                                                                          
    sage: gc                                                                                                                                                              
    diamond--free graphs                                                                                                                                                  
    sage: graphs.PetersenGraph() in gc                                                                                                                                    
    True   
```

Of course there is no specific code written for these classes. The list of subgraphs is obtained from the ISGCI database, and each of them is tested.... Nice generic stuff. Of course many graph classes are not defined in such a way, so everything is not done on that front `;-)`

And of course, it's an occasion to update the version of ISGCI we ship in Sage.

**Howto:**

After applying the branch's commits, one has to save **graphs-20130920.tar.bz2** to the build/upstream/ directory and run ``sage -i graphs`` again.

Hello,

I tried this patch and indeed it is cool :)

If I understand well, each time we implement a new membership test to a graph class, we should try to include it in isgci module, right? 
Also, is there a simple way for the user to know which recognition tests are available?

A small error:

```

I had almost forgotten about it. Two years old `:-P`

Yes, if we want the syntax `g in graph_classes.X` to use it.

> Also, is there a simple way for the user to know which recognition tests are available?


Do you mean "to get the list of all classes defined by forbidden subgraphs"? If so, I don't think so. For specific recognition problems, however, they often correspond to our "Graph.is_*" functions.

> A small error:

In the description of method `graph_classes.smallgraphs` is weird:

```
sage: graph_classes.smallgraphs?
Type:            CachedMethodCallerNoArgs
String form:     Cached version of <function smallgraphs at 0x1132b62a8>
File:            /Users/dcoudert/sage/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/misc/cachefunc.so
Definition:      graph_classes.smallgraphs(self)
Docstring:
   Returns a dictionary associating a graph to a graph description
   string.

   Upon the first call, this loads the database from the local XML
   files. Subsequent calls are cached.

   EXAMPLES:

      sage: t = graph_classes.inclusions()
      sage: type(t)
      <type 'list'>
      sage: t[0]
      {'sub': 'gc_1', 'super': 'gc_2'}

Class docstring:
   Utility class that is used by "CachedMethod" to bind a cached
   method to an instance, in the case of a method that does not accept
   any arguments except "self".

   Note: The return value "None" would not be cached. So, if you
     have a method that does not accept arguments and may return
     "None" after a lengthy computation, then "@cached_method" should
     not be used.

   EXAMPLE:

      sage: P.<a,b,c,d> = QQ[]
      sage: I = P*[a,b]
      sage: I.gens
      Cached version of <function gens at 0x...>
      sage: type(I.gens)
      <type 'sage.misc.cachefunc.CachedMethodCallerNoArgs'>
      sage: I.gens is I.gens
      True
      sage: I.gens() is I.gens()
      True

   AUTHOR:

   * Simon King (2011-04)
Init docstring:
   EXAMPLES:

      sage: class Foo:
      ....:     def __init__(self, x):
      ....:         self._x = x
      ....:     @cached_method
      ....:     def f(self):
      ....:         return self._x^2
      sage: a = Foo(2)
      sage: print a.f.get_cache()
      None
      sage: a.f()
      4
      sage: a.f.get_cache()
      4
Call docstring:
   Call the cached method.

   EXAMPLE:

      sage: P.<a,b,c,d> = QQ[]
      sage: I = P*[a,b]
      sage: I.gens()    # indirect doctest
      [a, b]
      sage: I.gens() is I.gens()
      True
```

Furthermore, the example exposes `graph_classes.inclusions()` but not `graph_classes.smallgraphs()`.

The rest seems ok.

David.
