Sadly not my love, unless someone teaches me enough of the stuff that I understand it myself.

http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/structure/sage/structure/unique_representation.html

One thing I don't understand is:

```
the preprocessing on the arguments should be idempotent. Namely, If MyClass2.__classcall__ calls CachedRepresentation.__classcall__(<some_arguments>), then it should accept <some_arguments> as its own input, and pass it down unmodified to CachedRepresentation.__classcall__().
```
What is meant by "accept <some_arguments> as its own input"?

Something that possibly should be added is some explanation of the difference between `__classcall__` and `__classcall_private__`. Maybe it doesn't belong there, but then again I have no idea where it belongs as it seems not documented at all...

Also there seems to be a typo:

```
The UniqueRepresentation and UniqueFactory classes provide two alternative implementations of this design pattern. Both implementations have their own merits. UniqueRepresentation is very easy to use: a class just needs to derive from it, or make sure some of its super classes does. Also, it groups together the class and the factory in a single gadget; in the example above, one would want to do:
```

I think it's UniqueFactory, not UniqueRepresentation, which is easy to use etc.

You couldn't be more mistaken, I think. In the wast majority of cases, if you have defined a class C,

```
class C(base1, base2):
    code
```
then you only need to change it into

```
class C(UniqueRepresentation, base1, base2):
    code
```
and have caching *and* pickling for free. Setting up a `UniqueFactory` is a lot more work.

OK, if this is the case, then indeed it is a bad example.

One question, though: What do you mean by `UniqueRepresentation` tutorial? Is there a separate tutorial, or is it just the pages for sage.structure.factory and sage.structure.unique_representation, respectively?

<a id='comment:7'></a>I think both `sage.structure.unique_representation` and `sage.structure.factory` need more care.

Certainly it is a severe fault that `GF(...)` appears as example of `UniqueRepresentation`.

And I think both parts of the documentation should give hints on when to use `UniqueRepresentation` and when to use `UniqueFactory`.

For example, a `UniqueFactory` can return different implementations of the same algebraic structure, depending on the input data. This would be impossible (or at least not so easily possible) with `UniqueRepresentation`. And you would not be able to use `UniqueRepresentation` with a cdef class---you can define your class in a pyx file, but it has to be `class Foo(UniqueRepresentation, ...)`, not `cdef class Foo(UniqueRepresentation, ...)`, simply since `UniqueRepresentation` uses meta-classes, which is not possible in a cdef class, if I am not mistaken (and of course, multiple inheritance does not work yet in Cython, and after all `UniqueRepresentation` is a python class.

These are reasons for using a factory.

On the other hand, using `UniqueRepresentation` would automatically provide your class with very fast hash and comparison methods implemented in Cython (`UniqueRepresentation` is a Python class, but also inherits from the Cython class `sage.misc.fast_methods.WithEqualityById`). If you use a factory instead, you'd need to take care of hash and comparison all by yourself---and this means: It is possible that a `UniqueFactory` returns objects that are *not* unique parents!! And moreover, using `UniqueRepresentation` is very easy---in most cases, it is enough to take an existing class and add `UniqueRepresentation` as base.

So, these are reasons for using a unique representation.

Or not? I now see that `GF(...)` appears in order to demonstrate the design pattern that is common to both unique representation and unique factory. And it is clearly stated that one would like to have something like

```
isinstance(GF(p), GF)
```
which is *not* possible with a unique factory but is the case for `UniqueRepresentation`.

<a id='comment:9'></a>I think it is a good idea to have GF mentioned *both* in the documentation of unique representation and unique factory, since it explains one detail one can base one's choice on.

Namely, as an example of a behaviour one can not get with `UniqueRepresentation`:

```
sage: type(GF(5))
<class 'sage.rings.finite_rings.finite_field_prime_modn.FiniteField_prime_modn_with_category'>
sage: type(GF(25,'x'))

Is the difference just in the fact that a `__classcall_private__` method will not be inherited by subclasses while a `__classcall__` will be? (But I thought all methods would be inherited by subclasses?)\n\n\nYour question really is about `sage.misc.classcall_metaclass.ClasscallMetaclass`, which is where methods such as `__classcall__`, `__classget__`, `__classcontains__` and `__classcall_private__` take effect.\n\nHere, we look at `sage.misc.classcall_metaclass.ClasscallMetaclass.__call__`, which implements the creation of instances of a class. Of course, if a class C defines `__classcall_private__` and a class D inherits from C, then D also has a `__classcall_private__` method. However, you can find this method in `C.__dict__` but not in `D.__dict__`.\n\nAnd the rule is: If an instance of a class (here: C or D) is created by calling `ClasscallMetaclass.__class__`, then\n* it will be checked whether the class has a `__classcall_private__` in its own `__dict__`. If this is the case, then `__classcall_private__` will be called. Otherwise,\n* it is checked whether the class has a `__classcall__` method (which is not necessarily in `__dict__`, as it could be inherited from a base class). If this is the case, then `__classcall__` will be called.\n\nI just said \"we look at `ClasscallMetaclass.__call__`\". Well, in fact we look at `CLasscallMetaclass.__cinit__`, because this is where the choice between `__classcall__` and `__classcall_private__` is made.\n\nWhat does all this mean for this ticket?\n\nQuestion: Do you think it would be enough to state in the documentation of `CachedRepresentation` that it has the `ClasscallMetaclass` and that it provides a `__classcall__` implementing the cache, and that one can use `__classcall_private__` or `__classcall__` as explained in the docs of `ClasscallMetaclass` to overload the default way of caching?\n\nOr I guess it would still be a good idea to have examples in place, without the need to read the `ClasscallMetaclass` docs...",

<a id='comment:12'></a>Replying to [comment:11 darij]:
> I fear the doc of `_clear_cache_()` is beyound my comprehension... Is the difference just in the fact that a `__classcall_private__` method will not be inherited by subclasses while a `__classcall__` will be? (But I thought all methods would be inherited by subclasses?)


Your question really is about `sage.misc.classcall_metaclass.ClasscallMetaclass`, which is where methods such as `__classcall__`, `__classget__`, `__classcontains__` and `__classcall_private__` take effect.

Here, we look at `sage.misc.classcall_metaclass.ClasscallMetaclass.__call__`, which implements the creation of instances of a class. Of course, if a class C defines `__classcall_private__` and a class D inherits from C, then D also has a `__classcall_private__` method. However, you can find this method in `C.__dict__` but not in `D.__dict__`.

And the rule is: If an instance of a class (here: C or D) is created by calling `ClasscallMetaclass.__class__`, then
* it will be checked whether the class has a `__classcall_private__` in its own `__dict__`. If this is the case, then `__classcall_private__` will be called. Otherwise,
* it is checked whether the class has a `__classcall__` method (which is not necessarily in `__dict__`, as it could be inherited from a base class). If this is the case, then `__classcall__` will be called.

I just said "we look at `ClasscallMetaclass.__call__`". Well, in fact we look at `CLasscallMetaclass.__cinit__`, because this is where the choice between `__classcall__` and `__classcall_private__` is made.

What does all this mean for this ticket?

Question: Do you think it would be enough to state in the documentation of `CachedRepresentation` that it has the `ClasscallMetaclass` and that it provides a `__classcall__` implementing the cache, and that one can use `__classcall_private__` or `__classcall__` as explained in the docs of `ClasscallMetaclass` to overload the default way of caching?

Or I guess it would still be a good idea to have examples in place, without the need to read the `ClasscallMetaclass` docs...

And yes, some doc on metaclasses and the instantiation process (I'm confused about what goes in __new__, what in __init__ and what in __classcall__) would be great.

As for the "why" of cached/unique representation, for me it's pretty clear already, and I think the definition in your doc is very readable.

Thanks a lot for the patience!

<a id='comment:23'></a>Sorry for letting this slip off my to-do list!

I'm pretty sure that I've understood the important points of the doc now except for some that concern pickling (I don't know how it works and frankly I didn't plan on learning that). I'd feel better if I knew what exactly `__classcall__` does and (as I said) how it is distinguished from `__new__` and `__init__` (and if it calls them, in which order), but that might as well be a different patch.

Is the comment I've added correct and is it relevant?

I've replaced "extension class" by "Cython extension-type class", since they seem to be called either "extension types" or "cdef classes" but never "extension classes".

I'd like more details on this:

```
104	    In addition, it is required that a unique factory instance is provided 
105	    with a name that allows to find its definition.
```
I assume this refers to the string parameter, e. g., in `F = MyFactory("__main__.F")`; but what kind of path should it contain if it is to be used somewhere in a .py file rather than in a doctest? Just `F = MyFactory("F")` ? What if it is defined inside a class?

Not sure about this:

```
And 
 	408	with a factory, it is possible to create the resulting instance by arguments 
 	409	that are different from the key used for caching.
```
Doesn't that also work with CachedRepresentation if one preprocesses by declaring `__classcall_private__`?

`@`Travis: thank you, too.

Same here...

> I'm pretty sure that I've understood the important points of the doc now except for some that concern pickling (I don't know how it works and frankly I didn't plan on learning that). I'd feel better if I knew what exactly `__classcall__` does and (as I said) how it is distinguished from `__new__` and `__init__` (and if it calls them, in which order), but that might as well be a different patch.


In a nutshell: If `C` is a class with `ClasscallMetaclass`, then `__classcall__` (or `__classcall_private__`) is what is executed when you do `C(*args, **kwds)`.

Your `__classcall__` can do *anything*. Really. It could return an instance of `C`, but it could also return something totally different.

Consequence: `__new__` or `__init__` are *only* called if you did not forget to call them inside of your `__classcall__`. If you look at what `CachedRepresentation.__classcall__` does, you see that indeed `__new__` and `__init__` are called explicitly.

Exactly.

It is exactly as it is stated: A name is needed that allows to find the factory's definition. Hence, if you put `F` into the global name space, then `F = MyFactory("F")` is fine. If `F` is in a module `sage.foo.bar`, then it is `F = MyFactory("sage.foo.bar.F")`.

> What if it is defined inside a class?


If the class is `sage.bar.foo.MyClass` and you want to use a factory for the attribute `F` of this class, then I guess it is `F = MyFactory("sage.bar.foo.MyClass.F"). Not tested, though.

Yes. This could be clarified.

Kind-of; on the other hand, the preprocessing probably needs to be idempotent for pickling to work well, so we have a serious restriction...

<a id='comment:32'></a>Replying to [comment:31 chapoton]:
> beware of unvisible characters ! 


Indeed. The third patch introduces some blank space.

```
Notice that the objects created by the factory inherit neither from 
the factory class, nor from the factory instance (which is not even a 
class). In fact, they don't even know about the factory that created 
them! 
```
Apart from the blank space after the "!" (AFAIK, there is no blank space *before* "!", ":" and ";", in contrast to French), I am not happy with the statement that the instances don't even know about the factory that created them:

```
sage: F = GF(5)
sage: F._factory_data
(<class 'sage.rings.finite_rings.constructor.FiniteFieldFactory'>,
 (5, 13, 'beta3'),
 (5, None, None, 'modn', '{}', 5, 1, True),
 {})
sage: _[0] is GF
True
```
This actually is how pickling is implemented (namely: By keeping a reference to the creating factory, plus the arguments used to call the factory).

Again, if I run the same thing as doctest, then the answer in the last line is "True", not "False". Hence, the symmetric group gets collected in an interactive session, but not in a test!

Sorry, my mistake. In order to find trailing whitespace, I went to the html page of the patch and marked some lines, thus highlighting all characters. And it did look like a highlighted blank spaces after the exclamation mark. But when I looked at the patch itself, it was fine.

Isn't deletion of this instance supposed to be *immediate*? After all, Python's cyclic garbage is not involved in this example, since the to-be-deleted objects are not part of any reference cycle.

Weird. Any idea about (1) the reason and (2) how to fix it?

OK, but I am also talking about the failure reported by travis:

<a id='comment:67'></a>The patches apply fine on 6.0rc0, and the print no longer leaks.

But I've got another question on this paragraph:

```
.. NOTE::

    For technical reasons, it is needed that ``__classcall__`` respectively
    ``__classcall_private__`` are "static methods", i.e., they are callable
    objects that do not bind to an instance or class. For example, a
    :class:`~sage.misc.cachefunc.cached_function` can be used here, because it
    is callable, but does not bind to an instance or class, because it has no
    ``__get__()`` method. A usual Python function, however, has a
    ``__get__()`` method and would thus under normal circumstances bind to an
    instance or class, and thus the instance or class would be passed to the
    function as the first argument. To prevent a callable object from being
    bound to the instance or class, one can prepend the ``@staticmethod``
    decorator to the definition; see :class:`staticmethod`.

    For more on Python's ``__get__()`` method, see:
    http://docs.python.org/2/howto/descriptor.html
```
In `src/sage/groups/perm_gps.py`, I see:

```
    @weak_cached_function
    def __classcall__(cls, *args, **kwds):
        """
        This makes sure that domain is a FiniteEnumeratedSet before it gets passed
        on to the __init__ method.

        EXAMPLES::

            sage: SymmetricGroup(['a','b']).domain() #indirect doctest
            {'a', 'b'}
        """
        domain = kwds.pop('domain', None)
        if domain is not None:
            if domain not in FiniteEnumeratedSets():
                domain = FiniteEnumeratedSet(domain)
            kwds['domain'] = domain
        return super(PermutationGroup_unique, cls).__classcall__(cls, *args, **kwds)
```
This is NOT decorated with ``@`staticmethod`. Isn't this contradictory to the NOTE above?

There is some argument pre-processing: `kwds['domain']` might change. And this *changed* argument is used as a cache key when calling `super(PermutationGroup_unique, cls).__classcall__(cls, *args, **kwds)`. Apparently the author of this `__classcall__` found it desirable that the instance is pulled from the cache when the original value of `kwds['domain']` is provided next time, *without* losing time by the preprocessing.
