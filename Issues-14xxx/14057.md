There is an updated p5 python spkg at #13867 which looks definitely more important than this one and is positively reviewed.

I say more important because I feel this ticket is in fact not needed, it would if we built Python in a non-framework from (whatever that means, but it seems it is OS X specific anyway, and we build build Python in a framework way on OS X because that must be the default way it gets configured I guess).
