Matplotlib 1.3.1 was released.  Here is what is new: http://matplotlib.org/1.3.1/users/whats_new.html#new-in-matplotlib-1-3

Of particular note is that pytz, dateutil, and pyparsing are no longer included and need to be installed separately: http://matplotlib.org/1.3.0/users/whats_new.html#new-setup-script

Files to be added to the `upstream` directory:

- http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/palmieri/SPKG/matplotlib-1.3.1.tar.gz (not vanilla source, as explained in SPKG.txt: a lot of graphics files have been removed)
- http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/palmieri/SPKG/dateutil-2.2.tar.gz
- http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/palmieri/SPKG/pyparsing-2.0.1.tar.gz
- http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/palmieri/SPKG/six-1.4.1.tar.gz
- http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/palmieri/SPKG/tornado-3.1.1.tar.gz

Regarding the dependency on #15510: that ticket provides a recent version of `setuptools`. Without that, the matplotlib build will (on-the-fly) download the deprecated Python package `distribute`. It seems to work fine either way.

Regarding all of these new files in `upstream`: as noted, matplotlib now no longer includes various dependencies. I thought it would be helpful to include them as separate files, in case other packages need them: then the dependencies in `build/deps` can be made precise and explicit.

Regarding the patch to `setupext.py`: I'm not sure I converted it properly from the old version to the new one. It works on OS X 10.9, but there might very well be a better way to do it.

I just gave it a try but gave up not very long after
1) Sage patches matplotlib for some libpng detection issue, and this patch does not apply
2) As it only seemed useful on Mac OS X I tried without that patch
3) There is an error during the installation because of some "https" protocol that isn't supported

That's when I lost hope `^^;`

Ooops sorry, I had not noticed you had updated it.

Well, I gave it another try with those files and this part worked fine, but I still get the error I saw when I first tried it by myself :
http://www.steinertriples.fr/m.log

By the way, for some reason the .log file that Sage claims should be located at /home/ncohen/.Sage/logs/pkgs/matplotlib-1.3.1.log does not exist.. But well `O_o`

I don't know why the error is occurring, but it looks like it is happening because of downloading the `distribute` package. 

On one hand, I think if you updated `setuptools` (that is, ticket #15510), it would avoid this error. On the other hand, updating `setuptools` will cause problems with building and (if you get past that) doctesting the notebook.

Maybe you can try downloading and installing `distribute` manually:

```
curl -O http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/d/distribute/distribute-0.6.28.tar.gz
tar xfz distribute-0.6.28.tar.gz
cd distribute-0.6.28
sage -sh
python setup.py install
exit
```
?

This ticket seems to cause massive problems with view, dot2tex and latex. None of the crystal viewing tools work any longer! See comments on http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/16026 . For example

```
