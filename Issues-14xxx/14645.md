tested with `SAGE_CHECK=yes` on Sage 5.9 OSX10.6.8 (native lapack/blas), all good. 

I understand that cvxopt docs not integrated into Sage Reference manual, but are installed in `SAGE_LOCAL/share/`. Wouldn't it be good to add a link somewhere in Reference manual to `SAGE_LOCAL/share/` ? Otherwise it's quite hard to find, unless you know something either not really documented, IMHO.

How does one force doc building/installing? I tried 

```
SAGE_SPKG_INSTALL_DOCS=yes sage -f cvxopt-1.1.6.p1.spkg
```
to no avail.

rather, to `SAGE_LOCAL/share/doc/`, The main problem is how to add a relative link. One can in principle do `../../../../...../local/share/doc/`
somewhere in `doc/<LANG>/website/templates/index.html`, but I'm not sure it's a good idea (IMHO the idea to put any docs in `$SAGE_LOCAL/share/doc/` is not so good... )

Perhaps at least there should be a symbolic link `sage/doc/local` pointing there, although I'm not sure how well this works with webservers.

The docs should link to upstream (http://cvxopt.org) and not to a local file that isn't even installed unless you build with `SAGE_SPKG_INSTALL_DOCS=yes`. Also, the link in http://www.sagemath.org/doc/numerical_sage/cvxopt.html is broken.

we can have `SAGE_LOCAL/share/doc/cvxopt/index.html` redirecting to  `cvxopt.org` by default, and overwrite it with the local docs if `SAGE_SPKG_INSTALL_DOCS=yes` during the cvxopt installation.

But there is much more stuff there than just cvxopt docs. E.g. I have currently, on Sage 5.9, 

```
NTL				ipython				ppl
cvxopt				mpfr				pwl
eclib				networkx-1.7.dev_20130506064154	sagetex
```
and again these docs are largely lost to a typical user. I wonder why are they (except cvxopt, that was explicitly installed with `SAGE_SPKG_INSTALL_DOCS` on) 
there in the first place. It looks like the other packages ignore the value of `SAGE_SPKG_INSTALL_DOCS`, no?

Generally speaking, do  Unix webservers allow symbolic links in the docs they serve?

Any feature requests beyond installing cvxopt should go to a different ticket.

Some packages just install their docs by default. Unfortunately, correct usage of autotools often eludes upsteam, requiring manual copying of documentation if desired. The latter is only attempted if `SAGE_SPKG_INSTALL_DOCS` is set.

Apache disallows symlinks by default. Not that that would help with http://sagemath.org, there we serve only the Sage docs and not a complete Sage installation afaik.

yes, but i don't know enough about sagenb/notebook server to give you any answer, sorry. there are also related issues, e.g. that the sagenb/notebook server doesn't show documentation in other languages – but that's in my eyes outside of the scope of this ticket.

> Generally speaking, do  Unix webservers allow symbolic links in the docs they serve?

yes and no. the documentation on the sage website is served as static file via apache. Following symlinks is explicitly enabled and it's basically just a copy/paste of the output files.
What the notebook server does is different, because it serves the files via its own server – there is also this live-documentation served via /doc/live/… 

So, in conclusion, there are (at least?) three independent things moving around:
* local installation of Sage
* Sage Documentation at sagemath.org/doc (that's where mvngu and I can weight in, we also have our own script that updates sagemath.org/help.html) 
* sagenb.org [and others] /doc/live/ <- and the menu that's in the help popup window.

I was actually first going to add that, but then did not for a couple of reasons:

* I hate absolute paths there (as have unfortunately been added back to (additional) messages in the "main" docbuilding, although the messages there are even worse, since they claim the documents had been built even upon errors), but was 100% sure at least some would complain about a relative path in the message.

* Most other packages don't.

* Then I'd also added a message in case `SAGE_SPKG_INSTALL_DOCS!=yes`, telling that the [HTML] docs have not been installed (and why), and how one can change that, which is pretty redundant, as that *should be* the same for all spkgs.

Orthogonal to that:

if they are in "wrong" location, yes. Otherwise, that's probably too much trouble --- although I as proposed on #14646, there ought to be a default `SAGE_SHARE/doc/cvxopt/index.html` forwarding to cvxopt website, so, ideally, `SAGE_SPKG_INSTALL_DOCS!=yes` would mean putting this forwarding back in place...

That's kind of a relative path... [I would have used] ;-)

(E.g. if one reinstalls an spkg just with different flags, or in order to run its test suite, but forgets to set `SAGE_SPKG_INSTALL_DOCS` to the previous setting?  Does anyone use that variable on a per-package basis?  To me it seems a few people have it set in their shell rcs, and most people don't use it, probably just because they don't know about... B) )
> >

Otherwise, that's probably too much trouble --- although I as proposed on #14646, there ought to be a default `SAGE_SHARE/doc/cvxopt/index.html` forwarding to cvxopt website, so, ideally, `SAGE_SPKG_INSTALL_DOCS!=yes` would mean putting this forwarding back in place...  Well, even more ideally, this functionality shouldn't be on the `spkg-install` level, but above, at `sage -i` level.

So, should I move the `rm -rf ...` out of the `if [ "$SAGE_SPKG_INSTALL_DOCS" = yes ] ...` branch?  (With a separate message on what's going on ... :-) )

sphinxcontrib-webuspport provides a Python API to easily integrate 
Sphinx documentation into your Web application.

From this one concludes that it is useless without sphinx, and thus it is its optional component. Do you know other uses for it? I don't.

-Now, the documentation of `cvxopt` uses the `sphinx-build` script of Sphinx (this is the usual entry point to run Sphinx). This script requires that all dependencies of Sphinx are installed. That is handled in #24972.

On  ​http://cvxopt.org/userguide/fftw.html there is no MathJax, they generate png images for formulae. E.g.

```
<dd><p>Replaces the columns of a dense complex matrix with their inverse
discrete Fourier transforms: if <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">X</span></code> has <img class="math" src="_images/math/e11f2701c4a39c7fe543a6c4150b421d50f1c159.png" alt="n"/> rows,</p>
<div class="math">

    \frac{1}{n} \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} e^{2\pi j k \sqrt{-1}/n} X[j,:],
    \qquad k=0,\ldots,n-1."/></p>
</div></dd></dl>
```

I don't know whether we should follow the suit, or leave it as it is, or
make it use MathJax...
