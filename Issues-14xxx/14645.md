I understand that cvxopt docs not integrated into Sage Reference manual, but are installed in `SAGE_LOCAL/share/`. Wouldn't it be good to add a link somewhere in Reference manual to `SAGE_LOCAL/share/` ? Otherwise it's quite hard to find, unless you know something either not really documented, IMHO.

How does one force doc building/installing? I tried 

```
SAGE_SPKG_INSTALL_DOCS=yes sage -f cvxopt-1.1.6.p1.spkg
```
to no avail.

rather, to `SAGE_LOCAL/share/doc/`, The main problem is how to add a relative link. One can in principle do `../../../../...../local/share/doc/`
somewhere in `doc/<LANG>/website/templates/index.html`, but I'm not sure it's a good idea (IMHO the idea to put any docs in `$SAGE_LOCAL/share/doc/` is not so good... )

Perhaps at least there should be a symbolic link `sage/doc/local` pointing there, although I'm not sure how well this works with webservers. 

If this is OK then I can create a patch (hmm, but how? Does hg understand symbolic links? Or it should be in some script, this link creation?)

oops, I meant the setup when the sagenb server is run on a remote host (rather than on localhost); then the docs are served somehow via a web interface, isn't it?

Generally speaking, do  Unix webservers allow symbolic links in the docs they serve?

Any feature requests beyond installing cvxopt should go to a different ticket.

Some packages just install their docs by default. Unfortunately, correct usage of autotools often eludes upsteam, requiring manual copying of documentation if desired. The latter is only attempted if `SAGE_SPKG_INSTALL_DOCS` is set.

Apache disallows symlinks by default. Not that that would help with http://sagemath.org, there we serve only the Sage docs and not a complete Sage installation afaik.

yes, but i don't know enough about sagenb/notebook server to give you any answer, sorry. there are also related issues, e.g. that the sagenb/notebook server doesn't show documentation in other languages – but that's in my eyes outside of the scope of this ticket.

> Generally speaking, do  Unix webservers allow symbolic links in the docs they serve?

yes and no. the documentation on the sage website is served as static file via apache. Following symlinks is explicitly enabled and it's basically just a copy/paste of the output files.
What the notebook server does is different, because it serves the files via its own server – there is also this live-documentation served via /doc/live/… 

So, in conclusion, there are (at least?) three independent things moving around:
* local installation of Sage
* Sage Documentation at sagemath.org/doc (that's where mvgnu and I can weight in, we also have our own script that updates sagemath.org/help.html) 
* sagenb.org [and others] /doc/live/ <- and the menu that's in the help popup window.

actually my idea about the main index.html is not listing individual packages, but just a general link to  `SAGE_LOCAL/share/doc` for "more stuff"... OK, I will open a separate ticket, and set this one to positive review, as soon as my request for a message saying that docs were installed (and where to) in `spkg-install` is honoured.

> OK, I will open a separate ticket, and set this one to positive review, as soon as my request for a message saying that docs were installed (and where to) in `spkg-install` is honoured.

I was actually first going to add that, but then did not for a couple of reasons:

* I hate absolute paths there (as have unfortunately been added back to (additional) messages in the "main" docbuilding, although the messages there are even worse, since they claim the documents had been built even upon errors), but was 100% sure at least some would complain about a relative path in the message.

* Most other packages don't.

* Then I'd also added a message in case `SAGE_SPKG_INSTALL_DOCS!=yes`, telling that the [HTML] docs have not been installed (and why), and how one can change that, which is pretty redundant, as that *should be* the same for all spkgs.

Orthogonal to that:

Should I delete previous (potentially outdated) docs regardless of `SAGE_SPKG_INSTALL_DOCS`, which could probably be considered unexpected behaviour?

1. The dependencies are not quite right: `sphinx` depends on `sphinxcontrib-websupport`, not the other way around. Also, it makes little sense to add `sphinxcontrib-websupport` as direct dependency of `cvxopt`. Adding `sphinx` should be sufficient.

In `cvxopt/spkg-install`:

2. You can simplify

```
    if [ -d $SAGE_LOCAL/share/doc/cvxopt/html ] ; then
       rm -rf $SAGE_LOCAL/share/doc/cvxopt/html

```
to

```
       rm -rf "$SAGE_LOCAL/share/doc/cvxopt/html"
```

3. You should quote `"$SAGE_LOCAL"`

4. It would be good to fix the indentation: use 4 spaces and also indent the comments.

I don't understand, are you saying one can install `sphinxcontrib-websupport` without installing `sphinx` first? This sounds strange to me, as the former is a component of the latter.

Also, it makes little sense to add `sphinxcontrib-websupport` as direct dependency of `cvxopt`. Adding `sphinx` should be sufficient.

sphinxcontrib-webuspport provides a Python API to easily integrate

```

From this one concludes that it is useless without sphinx, and thus it is its optional component. Do you know other uses for it? I don't.

Replying to [@dimpase](#comment%3A66):

I had to set it back to "needs work" because it was wrong and I didn't want anybody accidentally setting this to "positive review" in that state.

The reason for the silence is that I need more time to test things, gather evidence and explain you properly why it is wrong.
