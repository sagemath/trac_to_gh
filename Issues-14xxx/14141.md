Hi Franco,

The patch is basically ready to go now. Could you please look over my changes? Also, there is one method which is currently broken (namely _plot_color_edges), which would still be good to have around.

Thanks!

Well, it depends. If it's about checking the internal state of the program, asserts are *good*; we want more of them! If it's about checking the arguments provided directly by a user that's more arguable. See the discussion we had on sage-combinat-devel.

General comments on the patch:
- This patch has not been rebased: it fails to apply on 5.9.beta5 (and on 5.9.rc0 according to the patchbot).
- All tests pass on 5.9.beta5.
- some methods are missing `INPUT` blocks, some do not describe all the possible input arguments, some do not test all the possible input options

Comments on the interface:
- I don't think that `PuzzlePiece, PuzzlePieces, PuzzleSolver` should be imported into the global namespace. These names are too generic to apply to only KT puzzles.
- Is it expected that the average user will create new puzzle pieces? or is it that `PuzzleSolver` will be the most used command?
- I think it would be preferable to have one entry point to the module, from which users import what they need.
- And this entry point should have appropriate documentation describing all the features (kind of like the current documentation to the module, but with some enhancements).
- Perhaps `KnutsonTaoPuzzleSolver`?

Comments on documentation to the module (top of the file):
- If I do `import knutson_tao_puzzles` followed by `knutson_tao_puzzles?`, I see `1/0  0/1` as a puzzle piece. I don't know what this piece is. Is this a problem with the documentation rendering system?
- The string representations should be explained: most people won't know what `1/0 0\1` means.
- The `TODO` section describes a possible speed up. Isn't this what `_fill_strip` and `_fill_puzzle_by_strips` does?

Comments on `PartialPuzzle`:
- `LR_tab_from_puzzle` is not a good name. Perhaps just call it `skew_lr_tableau`.
- `plot_thru_puzzle` is not a good name. `thru` is not an English word.
- the error from comment 7 above should be included as a doctest.
- `assert` should be avoided.
- `partition_from_string`: I don't know what this method does. The documentation is not descriptive. What is the "string data" of a partition? If this is a standard partition constructor, then should it be in `Partition` instead?

Comments on `PuzzleSolver`:
- "Initialize the puzzle solver" is not a sufficient 1-line description since it doesn't mention the kind of puzzles dealt with.
- there is an option called 'maxLetter' in the INPUT section, but the init doesn't take maxLetter as an argument ... oh wait, it's in `__classcall_private__`. Why is `__classcall_private__` needed here?
- there should be doctests that show how to use "maxLetter"
- The output is not a function (but instances of the class happen to be callable).
- several methods are missing the mandatory 1-line string documentation and instead just include examples / tests.

Comments on `SchubertCalculusAlgebra`:
- should this really be in this module? it seems to experimental (there is also some commented out code that shouldn't be included)
- it was implemented as a proof of concept and has no special features; perhaps it should be deleted and further developed in a separate patch?
- in the doctest for `product_on_basis`, the base ring of the algebra is `QQ`, but the coefficients belong to a different ring:

```
sage: from sage.combinat.knutson_tao_puzzles import SchubertCalculusAlgebra
sage: Sc = SchubertCalculusAlgebra(QQ, (3,3)).basis()
sage: x = Sc[Word('001011')] * Sc[Word('010101')]
sage: x.parent().base_ring()
Rational Field
sage: x.coefficients()[0].parent()
Multivariate Polynomial Ring in y0, y1, y2, y3, y4, y5, y6 over Integer Ring
```

I don't have the time to address my comments myself this week with a proper review patch, but I can at some point over the next week. There are a few things to decide beforehand, so we can at least discuss these here in the meantime.

> General comments on the patch:

I think it depends trivially on #14299 which was merged in sage-5.10.beta0.

> Comments on the interface:
> - I don't think that `PuzzlePiece, PuzzlePieces, PuzzleSolver` should be imported into the global namespace. These names are too generic to apply to only KT puzzles.


How would the user then find information about puzzles? If we do not import anything in the namespace, then there is no entry point via tab completion.

> - Is it expected that the average user will create new puzzle pieces? or is it that `PuzzleSolver` will be the most used command?


I think `PuzzleSolver` will be the most common command. And currently the user does not have to create his/her own puzzle pieces since `PuzzleSolver("H")` is an option. That's also why I think `PuzzleSolver` should be in the global namespace.

> - I think it would be preferable to have one entry point to the module, from which users import what they need.
> - And this entry point should have appropriate documentation describing all the features (kind of like the current documentation to the module, but with some enhancements).

Sure, we could rename it this way.

> Comments on documentation to the module (top of the file):
> - If I do `import knutson_tao_puzzles` followed by `knutson_tao_puzzles?`, I see `1/0  0/1` as a puzzle piece. I don't know what this piece is. Is this a problem with the documentation rendering system?


I do not seem to see this!?

> - The string representations should be explained: most people won't know what `1/0 0\1` means.
> - The `TODO` section describes a possible speed up. Isn't this what `_fill_strip` and `_fill_puzzle_by_strips` does?


Ok, then please remove this comment!

> Comments on `PartialPuzzle`:
> - `LR_tab_from_puzzle` is not a good name. Perhaps just call it `skew_lr_tableau`.
> - `plot_thru_puzzle` is not a good name. `thru` is not an English word.


Ok, feel free to change the names.

> - the error from comment 7 above should be included as a doctest.
> - `assert` should be avoided.
> - `partition_from_string`: I don't know what this method does. The documentation is not descriptive. What is the "string data" of a partition? If this is a standard partition constructor, then should it be in `Partition` instead?


Yes, in fact you can do

```
        sage: Partitions().from_zero_one([1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0])
        [5, 4]
```

But I think the only problem is that one needs the partition to be padded by 0s.

> Comments on `PuzzleSolver`:
> - "Initialize the puzzle solver" is not a sufficient 1-line description since it doesn't mention the kind of puzzles dealt with.
> - there is an option called 'maxLetter' in the INPUT section, but the init doesn't take maxLetter as an argument ... oh wait, it's in `__classcall_private__`. Why is `__classcall_private__` needed here?


To mend the input, so that UniqueRepresentation works!

> - there should be doctests that show how to use "maxLetter"
> - The output is not a function (but instances of the class happen to be callable).
> - several methods are missing the mandatory 1-line string documentation and instead just include examples / tests.


I think private methods are not required to have the one line description.

> Comments on `SchubertCalculusAlgebra`:
> - should this really be in this module? it seems to experimental (there is also some commented out code that shouldn't be included)


Ed and Liz really liked this feature, to be able to compute structure coefficients in an easy way.

> - it was implemented as a proof of concept and has no special features; perhaps it should be deleted and further developed in a separate patch?
> - in the doctest for `product_on_basis`, the base ring of the algebra is `QQ`, but the coefficients belong to a different ring:
> 
> ```
> sage: from sage.combinat.knutson_tao_puzzles import SchubertCalculusAlgebra
> sage: Sc = SchubertCalculusAlgebra(QQ, (3,3)).basis()
> sage: x = Sc[Word('001011')] * Sc[Word('010101')]
> sage: x.parent().base_ring()
> Rational Field
> sage: x.coefficients()[0].parent()
> Multivariate Polynomial Ring in y0, y1, y2, y3, y4, y5, y6 over Integer Ring
> ```


That is indeed a problem!

I just found a doctest that passes, but should fail:

```
        sage: from sage.combinat.knutson_tao_puzzles import BK_pieces
        sage: BK_pieces(3)

        Deltas : [0/0\0, 1/1\1, 2/2\2, 3/3\3]
```
Whoever added this code and doctest should explain what is going on.

And I included a doctest that fails: we need an example of a puzzle with BK pieces.

```
            sage: ps = KnutsonTaoPuzzleSolver("BK", 3)

Attachment [trac_14141-BK-fix-fs.patch](tarball://root/attachments/some-uuid/ticket14141/trac_14141-BK-fix-fs.patch) by @saliola created at 2013-05-14 04:16:03

Attached a patch to fix the issues with the BK puzzle pieces. Essentially, a for loop was not indented properly, so puzzle some BK pieces were missing.

Apply: trac_14141-knutson_tao_puzzles-as.patch, trac_14141-review-fs.patch, trac_14141-BK-fix-fs.patch

Hi Franco!

Thanks for the patches. I folded them and looked them over. One "major" change I made is to put the documentation that was in the init method of KnutsonTaoPuzzleSolver in its header, so that it actually shows up in the documentation! Before it was invisible to the user from the documentation, but contained the explanation about the main use cases of the code. I also fixed some small issues with the referencing.

If you are happy with the changes, I am happy to set a positive review!

Anne

Ok, thanks! I added r""" in front of most documentation and removed a link to http which might have caused the problem.

Without more specific instructions on how to debug this, I am not sure what else to do.
