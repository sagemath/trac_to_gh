your patch did not apply (seems to be some problem with the encoding of carriage returns)

so I used it to make a new one, with some corrections to the documentation formatting

for the bot:

When the algorithm is 'pari' it doesn't return an element in the p-adic ring:

sage: R = Zp(3)

sage: x = R(5).padic_gamma()

sage: x.parent()

Interface to the PARI C library

But coerce seems to work, so maybe just adding a coerce before returning the result will fix it:

sage: R(x).parent()

3-adic Ring with capped relative precision 20
