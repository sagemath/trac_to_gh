With #10170, for at least `n >= 30`, mpmath's `bell(n)` is incorrect:

```
sage: bell_number(30, 'mpmath') 
846749014511809388871680
sage: bell_number(30, 'gap')   
846749014511809332450147
```
The GAP implementation is the correct one (it agrees with OEIS and the implementation in #10170 for `n > 200`). I don't know if this is a me (i.e. this is fixed in an upgrade of mpmath not yet merged as of `5.8.beta1`), sage, or an mpmath issue.

Depends on #10170

It's not enough to call mpmath.bell(n) and convert to an integer since it gives a floating-point approximation; you need to set the precision to slightly more than log_2(B_n) bits.

It doesn't make sense to return an incorrect value by default.

A better solution would be to set the precision to say 10 bits, compute p = mpmath.mag(mpmath.bell(n)) + 10, set mpmath.prec = p, then compute ret = ZZ(int(bell(n))).
