```
In sage 5.5 I see the following behaviour:

```
sage: Matrix(AA, [[1]]).gram_schmidt()
[…]
AttributeError: 'AlgebraicReal' object has no attribute 'conjugate'
sage: AA(1).conjugate()
[…]
AttributeError: 'AlgebraicReal' object has no attribute 'conjugate'
sage: conjugate(AA(1))
1
```

So I'd say either gram_schmidt (or its backends) should be modified to use the `conjugate` function instead of the `conjugate` method. Or the base class for real algebraic numbers should be changed to provide that method. The latter would be more likely to resolve issues similar to this one, in existing and future code, shipped with sage or written by third parties. The former might help for other fields which don't support a `conjugate` method either.

The algebraic reals should definitely have a conjugate method, so I've added that. I also added a doctest in gram_schmidt to test that it now works with algebraic reals (I used the example for QQbar that only has integers and doing the computation with algebraic reals instead of QQbar is in fact faster!).
