Keywords: NumberField, embeddings

The embeddings function for number fields just checks for roots in the argument. For example:


```
sage: K = NumberField(x^3-2, 'a')
sage: K.embeddings(GF(3))

This looks good to me.  I suppose the underlying problem is that Sage is happy to coerce K.defining_polynomial() into the polynomial ring over the finite field.

Applies fine to 5.12.beta1 and tests pass.
