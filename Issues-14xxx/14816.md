I think Kevin worked on this at Sage days 49, but IDK who the user "sam" is (if you're reading this, please add in your real name).

I agree that we should review this. I've moved stuff into the `CoxeterGroups` category, which is where the comments suggested they belong, and I added the methods to make it all work.
