On [sage-devel](https://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/ec5afc6027106c52?hl=en) it was observed that at least in 5.7 and 5.8 we have in the notebook:

```
sage: 1/0
ZeroDivideError
```
(as expected)

```
sage: debug()
IndexError: string index out of range
```
due to `inspect.getinnerframes` failing on a seemingly otherwise valid traceback object.

**Attachment:** [trac_14338-strip_frames.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket14338/trac_14338-strip_frames.patch.gz)

One fix is to avoid the frames on which `inspect.findsource` chokes, since those are frames that have to do with the notebook, not with the user code, so they don't get displayed anyway.

The other fix would be to

`python/inspect.py:526`

```diff 
     file = getfile(object)
     sourcefile = getsourcefile(object)
-    if not sourcefile and file[0] + file[-1] != '<>':
+    if not sourcefile and (not file or file[0] + file[-1] != '<>'):
         raise IOError('source code not available')
     file = sourcefile if sourcefile else file
```
but that's a change to python, not to sage.
