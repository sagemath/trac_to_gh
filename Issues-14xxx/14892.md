`>_<`

If we were japanese guys you would not have written such a patch, for it is shameful to me `>_<`

God. How did I write this thing in the first place ? Please forgive me `>_<`

Anyway, thank you very much ! This `ADD_EDGE` method looks useful indeed. And all tests pass, the sun shines and the birds sing outside.

`Thaaaaaaaaaaaaaanks` !

Any reason why you use

```
for patch in `ls ../patches/*.patch`; do
```
instead of the standard

```
for patch in ../patches/*.patch; do
```
(both work correctly but the first wastes a process and will display a confusing error if no patch files are found)
