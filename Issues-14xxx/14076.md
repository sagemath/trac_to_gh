Currently (Sage 5.7.beta3) on `OpenSuse 12.2` with gcc version 4.7.1 20120723 the CHomP package (version chomp-20100213.p2) can't be installed. This is all fixed in the latest upstream version.

Updated optional spkg: http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/vbraun/spkg/chomp-20130518.p0.spkg

By the way, this should be added to the **optional** spkgs, not the experimental ones (and the old one should be removed from the experimental list): there was a [vote on this in sage-devel](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/HLxXNpykXm8/ncLCEUrVaJQJ) over two years ago to make this change, but I think it never happened.

The required fixes seem to be included in the current version 2013-01-02 of the CHomP package, so an update should fix this issue.

Its a bit of a variant of #14578: caching for mutable objects is fragile. Its difficult to get right, and even if you do you'll break it when you make changes in the future.

The right thing to do is to make cell complexes immutable, and `add_face` / `remove_face` return new cell complexes. With an `add_faces` analogue to add multiple faces in one go to avoid performance issues. Bonus: the cell complexes can then be parents for chains. Thoughts?

The answers given by CHomP and Sage without CHomP for the homology generators of `C_k` are different: without CHomP:

```
{0: [(Z, (1))], 1: [(C2, (1, 0, 0)), (Z, (0, 0, 1))], 2: [(0, ())]}
```
With CHomP:

```
{0: (Z, [(1)]), 1: (Z x C2, [(0, 1, -1), (0, 0, 1)])}
```
As far as I can tell, the non-CHomP answer is correct: (1,0,0) generates a copy of `C_2`, because (2,0,0) is in the image of the differential `d_2`, while (0,0,2) is not in the image, so (0,0,1) does not generate a copy of `C_2`. I haven't yet investigated whether this is a problem in CHomP (which I doubt) or a problem in how we are translating CHomP's answers (more likely).

Making simplicial complexes immutable isn't something that can be done gradually, so code that relies on them being mutable will necessarily break. 

Having said that, I never was very fond of the `add/remove_face`. To me, that implies that you have already a higher-dimensional cell to which you are adding a boundary cell. I would prefer `add_simplex` (for simplicial complexes) or maybe just `add_cell` (same interface for all cell complexes).

I agree that components of the torsion generator are reversed, will have a look at that.

ChomP actually uses `(0,1,-1)` as `Z_2` generator and `(0,0,1)` as free generator, we are mixing up the free and torsion part:
