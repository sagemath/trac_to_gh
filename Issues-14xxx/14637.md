```
sage: assume(x > 0)
sage: assume(x < pi/2)
sage: F = asin(sin(x))
sage: F.simplify() # sends to Maxima, nothing else
x
sage: G = acos(cos(x))
sage: G.simplify()
arccos(cos(x))
```
This has been [reported upstream](http://sourceforge.net/p/maxima/bugs/2570/) and resolved.

So we just need a patch to doctest this once we upgrade to whatever upstream release will have this.
