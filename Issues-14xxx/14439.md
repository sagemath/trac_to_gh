When the graph has a single vertex u, the method should return `[This is the Trac macro *u* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#u-macro), []`, but it currently returns `[u], []`. This is fixed in this patch.

No, I'm also changing the result when the graph has only one vertex.
This is to be consistent.
