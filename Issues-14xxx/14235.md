At t=1 the space where the k-Schur functions live is a Hopf algebra but the antipode and counit were never implemented because they were not required.  Ticket #14161 adds a test for the antipode that requires a counit method and so doc tests in new_kschur.py will fail unless these methods are implemented.

Not sure whether to call this a 'defect' or an 'enhancement'.  I am going with the latter.

I also am moving the `coproduct` method from the `ElementMethods` to the `ParentMethods`.
