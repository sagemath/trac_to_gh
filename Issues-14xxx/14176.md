The attached patch enables ``&`` and ``in`` operators for polyhedrons::

```
            sage: cube = polytopes.n_cube(3)
            sage: oct = polytopes.cross_polytope(3)
            sage: cube.intersection(oct*2)
            A 3-dimensional polyhedron in ZZ^3 defined as the convex hull of 12 vertices
            sage: cube & oct*2
            A 3-dimensional polyhedron in ZZ^3 defined as the convex hull of 12 vertices
```

```
            sage: P = Polyhedron(vertices=[[1,1],[1,-1],[0,0]])
            sage: P.center() in P
            True
            sage: [-1,-1] in P
            False
```
