```

I.e., while the library version of libppl got bumped, libppl_c is still at 4 (the same version as in PPL 0.x!).

So we still have to build PPL "serially" (not in parallel with *other* packages) to avoid potential race conditions with *old* system GCCs linked against that version;  GCC 4.8 and any later version use ISL instead of PPL.  (And PPL was optionally used since GCC 4.4 IIRC, so the "critical" versions are 4.4.x to 4.7.x.)

Replying to [vbraun](#comment%3A29):
> necroposting on long-closed tickets ;-)


ROFL.  I was just wondering whether it's still an issue (i.e., whether we could remove PPL from the sequential toolchain build) -- it is, so I didn't open a ticket for changing that; and as of Sage 6.7.beta3, `build/Makefile` still refers to this ticket:

```
# TOOLCHAIN consists of dependencies determined by build/install,
# including for example the GCC package.
toolchain: $(TOOLCHAIN)

# Build all packages that GCC links against serially, otherwise this
# leads to race conditions where some library which is used by GCC gets
# reinstalled. Since system GCCs might use Sage's libraries, we do this
# unconditionally. We still use the dependency checking from $(MAKE),
# so this will not trigger useless rebuilds.
# See #14168 and #14232.
toolchain-deps:
        $(MAKE) $(INST)/$(ZLIB)
        $(MAKE) $(INST)/$(SAGE_MP_LIBRARY)
        $(MAKE) $(INST)/$(MPFR)
        $(MAKE) $(INST)/$(MPC)
        $(MAKE) $(INST)/$(PPL)
```

You can open a new ticket for letting `build/Makefile` refer to some further new ticket of course.
