It's annoying when other people move something around in the Sage library and it's no longer available in the previous location to be imported.  Sage currently has some mechanisms for alleviating this problem (`sage.misc.superceded.deprecated_callable_import` and `sage.structure.sage_object.register_unpickle_override` for example).  This ticket adds another option: lazily import the old name so that a deprecation warning is issued whenever it is referred to.

Hey David,

The doctest is failing because the mismatch of the trac numbers. Also could you add a doctest with a message as well?

Thanks,

<a id='comment:9'>**Comment 9:**</a>
Comment from the sage-combinat thread :

the way it is implemented you add a "deprecation" 
feature to lazy import. But lazy imports can be used a lot, so 
wouldn't it be better to instead add a "lazy" feature to 
"deprecation_function_alias" ?

No, because then we'd have to import `deprecated_function_alias` (which doesn't currently accept a message too) and import the original object just to do something like

```
x = deprecation_function_alias(14275, x)
```
Otherwise we completely change the syntax and functionality to include `lazy_import`. Both of which are asinine.

Ahahaahha. Well, for as long as you know that the two reasons you gave me are bad reasons and can be easily avoided, all is fine. It is not so bad.
