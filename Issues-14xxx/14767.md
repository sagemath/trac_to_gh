```
Here is an example:

```
sage: import_statements('NN')
from sage.misc.lazy_import import NN
sage: from sage.misc.lazy_import import NN
...
ImportError: cannot import name NN
```

That's because `NN` is a not-yet-resolved lazy imported object.

Solution: if the object is a `LazyImport` then get the corresponding
object with `._get_object`. With the patch applied:

```
sage: import_statements(NN)
from sage.rings.semirings.non_negative_integer_semiring import NN
sage: import_statements('NN')
from sage.rings.semirings.non_negative_integer_semiring import NN
```

A potential bonus feature would have been to set lazy=True by default for lazy imported object:

```
sage: import_statements(NN)
lazy_import('from sage.rings.semirings.non_negative_integer_semiring', 'NN')
```
but the idea was dropped.

I strongly disagree by putting lazy as True for lazy imported objects. The behavior is nevertheless corrected with a two line patch which needs review (but the description of the ticket needs to be modified accordingly if you agree with my solution).

What's your rationale? If something is lazy imported in the global
name space, then it's likely that whoever needs it will want to lazy
import it, no?

The only drawback is that lazy imported classes are a bit more fragile
due to the isinstance issue.

I'll have a look.

I am not an expert of the lazy import buisness, but I do not want an extra layer on the objects I import. If I use a standard import statement inside a module it will neither affect the global namespace nor the starting time, right ?

Assuming your module is lazy imported, yes.

So your point is that, if a module is lazy imported (which should
progressively become the case most of the time), then within it the
modules it depends upon may as well be imported rather than lazy
imported. Ok, this sounds fair enough!

So positive review assuming the patchbot goes green.

<a id='comment:13'>Comment 13:</a>
The patch works for me as well, and fixes the bug i mentionned.

However, i think both points of view are valid:

- it is useless to add a layer when one imports a module for a direct use.
- on the other hand, developpers using this to modify Sage's source code
  should know that the module is currently only lazy imported. Indeed, if
  they "hard" import the module, this will lose the benefits of related
  lazy imports in terms of startup time.

As a limited developper, if i didn't fall on the bug when writing #10358,
i would have written 
`from sage.rings.semirings.non_negative_integer_semiring import NN`
instead of
`lazy_import('sage.rings.semirings.non_negative_integer_semiring','NN')`.

Hence, what i may suggest it to keep Vincent's behaviour as first output, and
when the module is only lazy imported in the Sage code, then add a warning
explaining this, and output the lazy statement as well.

Does this make sense ?

Maybe not an issue, since now Sage complains if a lazy imported module is resolved at startup time. Ah but this might not be the case if the module is imported through another path ...

Well, let's get this patch in and think about it for the future.
