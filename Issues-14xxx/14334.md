So far (in sage 5.10), the integral of multivariable polynomial is not clean, and belongs to the symbolic ring

```
sage: x,y = polygen(QQ, ['x','y'])
sage: (x*y).integral(x)
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
AttributeError: 'sage.rings.polynomial.multi_polynomial_libsingular.MPolynomial_libsingular' object has no attribute 'integral'
```
But one can do this:

```
sage: integrate(x*y,x)
1/2*x^2*y
sage: integrate(x*y,x).parent()
Symbolic Ring
```

It would be much better to have a .integral attribute and to stay within polynomial rings, like it happens with just one variable

```
sage: x = polygen(QQ, 'x')
sage: x.integral().parent()
Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Rational Field
```

Keywords: **integral of polynomials**

Also, with the patch I get

The problem is that this is handled by singular. If the base ring is **more complicated**, everything works well.

The patch does not apply for me on 5.11.rc1 because of empty lines conflict - probably needs rebasing!

This can be done later as well: Isn't it a bit overly restrictive to demand QQ is a subfield? Everything should be fine as long as factorial(degree(f,x)) is invertible in the base ring.

Perhaps just try the computation:
- If you end up with an exponent that is divisible by the characteristic, you'll get a `ZeroDivisionError`.
- If you try to convert the newly computed coefficient into the base ring, you'll get an error for things like `integrate(5*x^2*y,y)` in `ZZ[x,y]`, because `ZZ(5/3)` will fail.
You could catch these errors and raise a `ValueError: polynomial does not have an antiderivative over this ring`.
