So far (in sage 5.10), the integral of multivariable polynomial is not clean, and belongs to the symbolic ring

```
sage: x,y = polygen(QQ, ['x','y'])
sage: (x*y).integral(x)
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
AttributeError: 'sage.rings.polynomial.multi_polynomial_libsingular.MPolynomial_libsingular' object has no attribute 'integral'
```
But one can do this:

```
sage: integrate(x*y,x)
1/2*x^2*y
sage: integrate(x*y,x).parent()
Symbolic Ring
```

It would be much better to have a .integral attribute and to stay within polynomial rings, like it happens with just one variable

```
sage: x = polygen(QQ, 'x')
sage: x.integral().parent()
Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Rational Field
```

<a id='comment:4'></a>Well, I think that top level function `integral` should work in this case, perhaps with symbolic ring as parent. If integral method is called directly, it still would be better to have a less cryptic message than that rationals cannot be integrated.

Also, with the patch I get

```

and somehow here it feels that the method should succeed, since

```

Perhaps just try the computation:
- If you end up with an exponent that is divisible by the characteristic, you'll get a `ZeroDivisionError`.
- If you try to convert the newly computed coefficient into the base ring, you'll get an error for things like `integrate(5*x^2*y,y)` in `ZZ[x,y]`, because `ZZ(5/3)` will fail.
You could catch these errors and raise a `ValueError: polynomial does not have an antiderivative over this ring`.
