If I generate two `Partition`-objects with some side-paramters I get different objects:

```
sage: A=Partitions(4, min_length=2)
sage: B=Partitions(4, min_length=2)
sage: id(A), id(B)
(116527952, 116528976)
```
But when I do the same without side-parameters I get the same object:

```
sage: A=Partitions(4)
sage: B=Partitions(4)
sage: id(A), id(B)   
(116529232, 116529232)
```
Both should behave in the same way (AFAIK, like the second example)

This is actually not a bug, but instead a consequence of the different classes needed to handle some inputs. In particular, we can't hash the arguments since sometimes they need [lambda] functions as input. Unfortunately I don't think we can work around this, so I'm thinking we should close this ticket as won't-fix.
