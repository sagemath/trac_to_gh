Keywords: fpLLL

Acording to the documentation, the method LLL for integer matrices allows the parameter delta to take a value <=1, however, for delta=1 the method always fail. It did not failed with previous version of sage.

```
sage: m=random_matrix(ZZ,2,2)
sage: m.LLL(delta=1)
...
RuntimeError: fpLLL returned -1 != 0
```

Either the documentation should be updated or the code should be fixed.
