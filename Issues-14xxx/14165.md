Adds a method to algebraic field for computing the subfield spanned by some elements.

It may be useful, for example, to transform polynomials over QQbar, or over AA, into polynomials over a number field (which can be then treated by singular).

The only thing that my patch adds to the existing function is the possibility to choose the name of the generator. As far as i am concerned, it would be ok to close this ticket as wontfix, and, if somebody considers that the name of the generator is important, open a ticket to add that option to the existing function.

Anyways, i would like to run some tests to compare my code with the existing one. Most likely my code will be worse, but it would be worth to check it, just in case.
