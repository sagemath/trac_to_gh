Adds a method to algebraic field for computing the subfield spanned by some elements.

It may be useful, for example, to transform polynomials over QQbar, or over AA, into polynomials over a number field (which can be then treated by singular).

Anyways, i would like to run some tests to compare my code with the existing one. Most likely my code will be worse, but it would be worth to check it, just in case.
