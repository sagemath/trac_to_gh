On Cygwin, libraries are stored in "bin" together with executables.
As we add Sage's bin directory to PATH (to be able to use the executables we generated!), the system-wide GCC may pick up some Sage's libraries (e.g. gmp, mpfr or mpc) rather than the system-wide ones it is supposed to if versions are identical.
Unfortunately, this may raise incompatibilities: I experienced a bunch of segfaults when building different spkgs.
