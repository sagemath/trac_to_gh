We should add a check to check that the doctesting framework correctly checks the value of `_signals.sig_on_count`. We should also keep it in check by setting it to zero, because a non-zero value is a blank cheque for the doctester to fail every subsequent `sig_on_count()` check.

Depends on #13610
