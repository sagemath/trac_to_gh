# Issue 14169: Let %attach behave like the old attach, and provide a doctest for %attach

Currently (sage-5.8.beta0), when using `attach /path/to/file.pyx`, one gets a deprecation warning and is told to use `%attach` instead of `attach`.

Problem: If one changes the file that is attached with `%attach` then no automatic re-compilation happens. But that would be the main point of attaching a file! And the automatic re-compilation used to be a feature of `attach`. Hence, changing from `attach` to `%attach` is a regression.

Moreover, it seems that `%attach` is not doc-tested.

Not clear if "user interface" is the right component, but `attach` is used in interactive sessions, after all...

This is presumably due to #12719.  Note that you can still use `attach('foo.spyx')`, apparently, without receiving the warning.

when ipython was upgraded to 0.13.  Apparently it wouldn't be so easy to change.  But it should work as I described in my comment; if it doesn't that's definitely a bug.
