This is a requirement for making minimal changes to the build system for the git transition. The alternatives all would require expanding the functionality of the git build system, further differentiating it from the current one.

The standard spkgs that currently violate this assumption:

1. atlas-3.10.x (autotools output and lapack tarball)
2. mpfr (upstream patches)
3. singular (shared directory)
4. ntl (custom libtool)
5. cliquer (some of the patch files)

The proposed solution is to track all patches, and for directories/tarballs, move `src` to `src/pkgname` down one layer and move the extra directories/tarballs to be under `src`.

Sure and you are welcome to work on extending the build system to handle all these inconsistent untracked files that are hidden behind the archiving process in the current structure (but which is gone in the unified git repository). I just have no interest in continuing to extend the (IMO) very hackish current build system in such ways when it can easily be resolved using a simpler hack.

So just to be clear, the proposed solution is to 
1. move all non-patch files into `src/` 
2. tar the resulting `src` directory up as our "source tarball" 
3. postpone any further work on the build system until after the git transition
That sounds reasonable to me.

Yes, with the slight modification

1. for each un-tracked file, either begin tracking it, or move it into `src/`

There are two packages (cliquer and mpfr) that have untracked patch files, which also cause issue.
