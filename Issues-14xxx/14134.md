Reproducible (and originally noticed) on the online "alpha" server.

Under the following conditions a cell will not produce any readable ouput in the notebook. However, output produced by html( ) will still appear - but anything typesetted (including tokens inside the html( ) such as

html( "This will still be visible - $But this wont$" )

will no longer be visible and the only solution is to delete the cell alltogether:

Typeset is ON
There occurred an Error
The error was "expanded" into details by clicking left of it
The error was fixed

Reproduce like that:
Enable Typeset. In a cell, type

k+;
5

Press Shift-Enter - an Error will appear. Expand the error by clicking left of it. Delete the "k+;" line, press Shift-Enter again - no output will appear.
