This spkg is an addition to #13425.

It contains data of exceptional mutation classes that are precomputed. The package is found at

spkg: http://spkg-upload.googlecode.com/files/cluster_seed-1.0.spkg

This package is not necessary for the features in #13425 to work but speed things quite a bit (up to minutes down to less than a second to compute a quiver mutation type).

**Keywords:** quiver, cluster, mutation type

I never wrote a package before, so I don't know the procedure to get it in Sage as a standard package. If that's okay, I'd like to make it standard.
