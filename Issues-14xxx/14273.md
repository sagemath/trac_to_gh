def fixed_default_email_address():
    import socket

sagenb.notebook.sage_email.default_email_address = fixed_default_email_address
```
to `sage.doctest.forker`.  These whould be removed once the newer version of sagenb is incorporated into Sage.

These changes were apparently used as workarounds for the old sagenb in #12415. I ran the following

```
...allations/sage-5.11.beta3» ./sage -btp 2 --sagenb
```
and all the tests passed. So, removing this workaround looks ok to me now.
