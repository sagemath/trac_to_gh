The function call syntax for symbolic expressions has been deprecated for about 12 years. It is about time it raised some errors. This will prevent people from getting confused because of behavior [like this](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/2357/the-difference-between-fx3-and-f3-of-callable).

I am able to fix all the doctests except for the following one in combinat/tutorial.py.

The example which fails seems to make no sense to me. A `substitute_function` method is being used to substitute a function with a symbolic expression.

```
sage: C, z = var('C,z');
sage: sys = [ C == z + C*C ]
sage: sol = solve(sys, C, solution_dict=True); sol
[{C: -1/2*sqrt(-4*z + 1) + 1/2}, {C: 1/2*sqrt(-4*z + 1) + 1/2}]
sage: s0 = sol[0][C]; s1 = sol[1][C]

...

sage: C = s0; C
-1/2*sqrt(-4*z + 1) + 1/2

...

sage: equadiff
(4*z - 1)*D[0](C)(z) - 2*C(z) + 1 == 0
sage: Cf = sage.symbolic.function_factory.function('C')
sage: equadiff.substitute_function(Cf, s0)  # Original answer is the deprecation + answer
...
TypeError: %d format: a number is required, not NoneType
```
Let us try to "fix" this (`z` is a symbolic variable). Somehow the following works (beats me why it does):

```
sage: equadiff.substitute_function(Cf(z), s0)
(4*z - 1)*D[0](C)(z) - 2*C(z) + 1 == 0     # OK, so this seems to work
```
But now the next command in the tutorial gives `False` instead of `True`

```
sage: bool(equadiff.substitute_function(Cf(z), s0))  
False
```

Why is all this happening? Looking at the documentation of `substitute_function` shows that it should be used for substituting *functions*, not anything else

```
    def substitute_function(self, original, new):
        """
        Returns this symbolic expressions all occurrences of the
        function *original* replaced with the function *new*.
```

And what exactly are we substituting above?

```
sage: type(Cf)
sage.symbolic.function_factory.NewSymbolicFunction
sage: type(s0)
sage.symbolic.expression.Expression
```
We are substituting a symbolic function with a symbolic expression! How was this even working earlier?

What should I do with this portion of the tutorial? Delete this?

> I am able to fix all the doctests except for the following one in combinat/tutorial.py.

OK, from what you've written down here, I can come up with one way of rewriting the example.

> ```
> sage: C, z = var('C,z');
> sage: sys = [ C == z + C*C ]
> sage: sol = solve(sys, C, solution_dict=True); sol
> [{C: -1/2*sqrt(-4*z + 1) + 1/2}, {C: 1/2*sqrt(-4*z + 1) + 1/2}]
> sage: s0 = sol[0][C]; s1 = sol[1][C]
> ```

> ```
> sage: C = s0; C
> -1/2*sqrt(-4*z + 1) + 1/2
> ```

I think this should be deleted. Use s0 if you want that and just leave C bound to the variable. It's already bad enough that we need "C as a function" further down.

> ```
> sage: equadiff
> (4*z - 1)*D[0](C)(z) - 2*C(z) + 1 == 0

> ```

Didn't we need Cf before to arrive at `equadiff`? How did `C(z)` get into that expression in the first place?

> ```
> sage: equadiff.substitute_function(Cf, s0)  # Original answer is the deprecation + answer
> ...
> TypeError: %d format: a number is required, not NoneType
> ```

I think the following should work (it does in vanilla, without a deprecation warning):

```
sage: equadiff.substitute_function(Cf, s0.function(z))
```
> Let us try to "fix" this (`z` is a symbolic variable). Somehow the following works (beats me why it does):
> 
> ```
> sage: equadiff.substitute_function(Cf(z), s0)
> (4*z - 1)*D[0](C)(z) - 2*C(z) + 1 == 0     # OK, so this seems to work
> ```

I'm not so sure it "works". It doesn't give an error (which is surprising in its own right; perhaps that should change), but I don't think it gives the same answer. In vanilla:

```
sage: equadiff.substitute_function(Cf(z), s0)
(4*z - 1)*D[0](C)(z) - 2*C(z) + 1 == 0
sage: equadiff.substitute_function(Cf, s0.function(z))
(4*z - 1)/sqrt(-4*z + 1) + sqrt(-4*z + 1) == 0
```

> But now the next command in the tutorial gives `False` instead of `True`

Rightly so, judging from the results above.

> Why is all this happening? Looking at the documentation of `substitute_function` shows that it should be used for substituting *functions*, not anything else

I guess because symbolic expressions were deprecated "functions": you could call then with symbolic arguments and get a symbolic expression, at the cost of a deprecation warning.

> What should I do with this portion of the tutorial? Delete this?

No, just do

```
sage: equadiff.substitute_function(Cf, s0.function(z))
```
That's probably a useful example to have anyway. It shows how to turn a symbolic expression into a function in a non-ambiguous way, because you need to specify argument order.

I actually agree and I don't see why a function call with non-relational argument should not be allowed IF there is only one variable in the expression. The confusion comes from the fact that things like `sqrt(2)(x+y)` almost always are typos where the `*` is missing. These should be marked as error. Now Sage cannot distinguish between `f=x^2; f(2)` and `sqrt(2)(x+y)` because `f` is replaced immediately with `x^2` and so in both cases an expression has its `__call__` member executed. BUT, first with `sqrt(2)(x+y)` the expression has no variables and so it can be doubtlessy marked as error; secondly, before `f` is silently expanded to `x^2` it is seen by the parser---maybe the parser can distinguish between calls that are done to `f` (like calls to functions) and other calls, and only allow the former?

That would be adding even more special cases just for Sage.

In Python, you expect the following two to do the same thing

```
f = x^2
print(f(2))
```
and

```
print((x^2)(2))
```
It would be very surprising if somehow these would become different.
