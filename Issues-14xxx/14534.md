When composing a `RingHomomorphism` and an instance of `RingHomomorphism_im_gens` then
the images of the generators are again checked for their validity.

This patch avoids this unnecessary test.

With the patch

```
sage: F.<a> = GF(3^100, 'a')
sage: f= F.hom([a^(3^5)])
sage: %timeit f^100
1 loops, best of 3: 290 ms per loop
```

before:

```
1 loops, best of 3: 1.73 s per loop
```
