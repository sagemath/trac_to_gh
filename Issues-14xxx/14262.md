Where should this appear, other than of course [the current location](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/packaging_old_spkgs.html?highlight=sage_local) where it is defined?  Maybe [here](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/coding_basics.html?highlight=sage_root#files-and-directory-structure), where `SAGE_ROOT` is defined?  (I don't see `SAGE_PACKAGES` any more, but I didn't look hard.)
