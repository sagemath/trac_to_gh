Apparently, there is a list of [huge packages](http://www.sagemath.org/sagedb/).
But these packages are not automatically searched when doing `sage -i`:

```
jdemeyer@tamiyo:/usr/local/src/sage-5.9.beta5$ ./sage -i stein-watkins-ecdb.spkg
Attempting to download package stein-watkins-ecdb
>>> Checking online list of optional packages.
[.]
>>> Checking online list of experimental packages.
[.]
>>> Checking online list of standard packages.
[.]
>>> Checking online list of archive packages.
[.]
Error: could not find a package matching stein-watkins-ecdb in http://www.sagemath.org/packages
```

We should
1. add server-side support to make the page look like the other package pages.
2. change the `spkg/bin/sage-spkg` script to support these packages.

**Apply** [attachment:14538_spkg_huge.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket14538/14538_spkg_huge.patch) to `SAGE_ROOT`

<a id='comment:6'>**Comment 6:**</a>
I don't like the hardcoding of `www.sagemath.org` for huge spkgs.

Everyone is free to "mirror" whatever he/she likes, and especially for huge spkgs [unfortunately still manually] choosing an (alternate) near/fast server certainly makes even more sense.

(I know one could still specify the full URL to the spkg and just do `sage -i <URL>`, but that was possible before anyway.)

---

Is there at all a way (i.e., an option to `sage`) to list all available/archive[d]/huge spkgs?

IMHO `sage --optional` (which I don't like anyway, just like `--experimental`, so I wouldn't like `sage --huge` either) should [now] list huge spkgs as well, of course with a remark (or as a separate list/category).
