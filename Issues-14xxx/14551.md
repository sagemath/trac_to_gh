As of #7931, Sage uses an algorithm due to Johnston for computing the `n`th root of finite field elements and elements modulo `n`.  In `GF(p)` for very large `p` and small `n` this algorithm is inferior to just factoring `x^n-a`, since it requires a primitive root modulo `p`.  Preliminary timings indicate that Johnston's algorithm is sometimes faster even in the range of `80` decimal digits, but it sometimes fails spectacularly with runtime 300 times slower than factoring the polynomial.

We should add the polynomial option as an algorithm to `n`th root and have a reasonable default based on the size of `n` and `p`.
