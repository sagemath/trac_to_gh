I need some help in checking the new package. What I did is simply replace the old ppl spkg with the new one in 
$SAGE_LOCAL/spkg/standard then rerun sage -upgrade. It result in an error as well.

I tried to apply to patch however, the way I know is by issuing hg_sage.patch('filename') inside sage but since I don't have a running copy of sage on the machine. I'm lost. How can I (or do I need to) apply the patch using my system hg instead?

Also I make myself a reviewer.

Just to make sure Volker, do you have the gmp 5.1 headers from your system installed? It strikes me that this problem wouldn't be apparent on most distributions because the headers are not installed by default.

I think if you don't have the headers installed it may be a good idea to try with a fake header in /usr/include that would stop the compilation.

Hi Volker, unfortunately I got the same error message after issuing

```
sage -f http://www.stp.dias.ie/~vbraun/Sage/spkg/ppl-1.0.spkg
```

Please see the attached log for details.

Hi François,

    1) I don't even know that SAGE is not using my distro gcc. I just type sage -upgrade or sage -f http://www.stp.dias.ie/~vbraun/Sage/spkg/ppl-1.0.spkg
        
        How can I force sage to use the system gcc?

     2) gmpxx.h is not present in /home/pong/sage-current/local/include/
         (only gmp.h is there).

It didn't happen - instead the build moved on to other things until it came to ppl where the lack of c++ headers from sage meant that it looked for headers in system location leading to the point this report has been filled.

It is likely that on another distro the following would have happened:

1) gmp headers of an appropriate version are installed and the build proceed with a mismatch between libgmp and libgmpxx and no one is the wiser when something breaks at run time if any.

2) No headers are installed and the problem is easily spotted as a lack of headers.

I wonder if that tell us something about the number of people running sage with gmp headers installed. Of course the problem can only occur during an upgrade.

Pong, just rebuilding mpir should solve the problem.

Here is my install.log. I've just browsed through it... I'm puzzled by a "jump" of dates towards to end when the dealing with ppl. What does this file actually log?

Who knows, I might have screwed things up between various sage -upgrade, sage -b and sage -f...
However, I should point out that after I rebuilt mpir (so that gmpxx.h is in the local directory), the first run of sage -upgrade (or sage -b), I forgot which one I issued, still failed. It's the second run that fixed everything.

It's hard to reproduce exactly what happened post-mortem. I don't understand why I don't see the GCC build in the `install.log` for example.

I'd say let's close this ticket as "invalid".
