It didn't happen - instead the build moved on to other things until it came to ppl where the lack of c++ headers from sage meant that it looked for headers in system location leading to the point this report has been filled.

It is likely that on another distro the following would have happened:

1) gmp headers of an appropriate version are installed and the build proceed with a mismatch between libgmp and libgmpxx and no one is the wiser when something breaks at run time if any.

2) No headers are installed and the problem is easily spotted as a lack of headers.

I wonder if that tell us something about the number of people running sage with gmp headers installed. Of course the problem can only occur during an upgrade.

Pong, just rebuilding mpir should solve the problem.

Who knows, I might have screwed things up between various sage -upgrade, sage -b and sage -f...
However, I should point out that after I rebuilt mpir (so that gmpxx.h is in the local directory), the first run of sage -upgrade (or sage -b), I forgot which one I issued, still failed. It's the second run that fixed everything.

I'd say let's close this ticket as "invalid".
