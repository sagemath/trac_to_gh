Is it possible to ask SAGE to sage to use other headers during compilation? If so, I will try to fix this issue but need some pointers to start.
As Fran√ßois said, looks like the spkg-install file already export flags to instruct SAGE to look for the libraries that comes with SAGE instead of those system-wide. What else should I look for?

I need some help in checking the new package. What I did is simply replace the old ppl spkg with the new one in 
$SAGE_LOCAL/spkg/standard then rerun sage -upgrade. It result in an error as well.

I tried to apply to patch however, the way I know is by issuing hg_sage.patch('filename') inside sage but since I don't have a running copy of sage on the machine. I'm lost. How can I (or do I need to) apply the patch using my system hg instead?

Also I make myself a reviewer.

For the record, the compilation of `Box.o` in my log used

```
libtool: compile:  g++ -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I. -I.. -I.. -I../src -I/home/vbraun/opt/sage-5.8.beta2/local/include -g -O2 -frounding-math -I/home/vbraun/opt/sage-5.8.beta2/local/include -W -Wall -MT Box.lo -MD -MP -MF .deps/Box.Tpo -c Box.cc  -fPIC -DPIC -o .libs/Box.o
```
which has the correct header path.

Just to make sure Volker, do you have the gmp 5.1 headers from your system installed? It strikes me that this problem wouldn't be apparent on most distributions because the headers are not installed by default.

I think if you don't have the headers installed it may be a good idea to try with a fake header in /usr/include that would stop the compilation.

It didn't happen - instead the build moved on to other things until it came to ppl where the lack of c++ headers from sage meant that it looked for headers in system location leading to the point this report has been filled.

It is likely that on another distro the following would have happened:

1) gmp headers of an appropriate version are installed and the build proceed with a mismatch between libgmp and libgmpxx and no one is the wiser when something breaks at run time if any.

2) No headers are installed and the problem is easily spotted as a lack of headers.

I wonder if that tell us something about the number of people running sage with gmp headers installed. Of course the problem can only occur during an upgrade.

Pong, just rebuilding mpir should solve the problem.

There is still the question of why. One possibility is that the build of GCC got interrupted and left in a partially installed state (enough to make `spkg/install` think that GCC is installed).

Here is my install.log. I've just browsed through it... I'm puzzled by a "jump" of dates towards to end when the dealing with ppl. What does this file actually log?

Who knows, I might have screwed things up between various sage -upgrade, sage -b and sage -f...
However, I should point out that after I rebuilt mpir (so that gmpxx.h is in the local directory), the first run of sage -upgrade (or sage -b), I forgot which one I issued, still failed. It's the second run that fixed everything.

It's hard to reproduce exactly what happened post-mortem. I don't understand why I don't see the GCC build in the `install.log` for example.

I'd say let's close this ticket as "invalid".
