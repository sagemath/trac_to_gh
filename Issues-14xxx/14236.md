The patch looks okay to me, and it seems to work, although I have a bit more testing to do.

Unrelated to this patch, but related to sage-bdist: running sage-bdist does not produce the link as given by `ln -s local/share "$SAGE_ROOT/data"` in `spkg/install`. Can that cause problems?

I also added a check in the release management script that the bdist repositories are clean (i.e. `hg status` shows nothing). This would prevent this problem in the future.
