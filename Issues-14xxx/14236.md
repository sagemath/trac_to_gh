After unpacking a binary built using #6495, the various files doc/en/reference/MODULE/conf.py, which are all supposed to by symlinks to doc/en/reference/conf_sub.py, are copies of that file instead, and the hg repo is not clean. So I'm marking this as a blocker.

The patch looks okay to me, and it seems to work, although I have a bit more testing to do.

Unrelated to this patch, but related to sage-bdist: running sage-bdist does not produce the link as given by `ln -s local/share "$SAGE_ROOT/data"` in `spkg/install`. Can that cause problems?
