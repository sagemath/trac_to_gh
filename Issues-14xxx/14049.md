This looks good, passes tests etc. - yes, talk about premature optimization!

My dumb question is whether we should, in fact, have such nonsensical matrices.  In particular

```
sage: m = identity_matrix(QQ, 4)[4:,:] 
sage: m
[]
```
Should we instead have something that shows we have four columns?  But of course that wouldn't be about this ticket.

We should certainly have zero-row and zero-column matrices.  That's an explicitly and deliberately supported feature in Sage.

I think kcrisman's question is whether a 0x4 matrix should be displayed differently, somehow, than a 0x0 matrix. I'm not sure what the answer is, and it's low priority, but it's an interesting question.
