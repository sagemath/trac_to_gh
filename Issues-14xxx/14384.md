Here is a doctest you can use:

```
"""
    sage: 3 - 1 - 6
    -4
    sage: 3-1-6

"""
```

Anyone who writes subtraction without spaces is a barbarian so this shouldn't cause any ambiguity.

So we're seriously going to do this?

Some comments:
1. Move `class VersionNumber` somewhere else (probably `sage/misc/versionnumber.py` for lack of a better place)
2. How can I get the raw patch for this commit from github?
3. Error messages are going to be very confusing, try

```
sage: x = 4.5
sage: x.denominator()

I don't think it makes sense to support software version numbers (i.e., literals of that type) as a "native" type in a CAS;  nobody will mind adding a *class* for versions, its constructor(s) taking a string (or probably also a float) argument, but this ticket is (currently) about the former.

Prepending a "v" could perhaps be a compromise, avoiding trouble (i.e., ambiguities) with floating-point literals, but I personally wouldn't like it either.

I have to say I got a little confused seeing something associated with mpfr that had alphabet characters in it too.

Personally, I think it's not worth the cost (confusion, yet another incompatibility, etc.) to introduce these to the preparser.

Yes.

If we ever move the useful constructions into the reference manual and get rid of the constructions thing, we could replace it with "cool Sage hacks".

Oh, like the move to Lisp...

I'm +1 for going into standard Sage, but I don't feel strongly enough about it to argue.

Sure.

I don't think this works as well as an April Fools e-mail, since it's not actually a very major change.  And we'd have to wait almost a year anyway.  ;-)
