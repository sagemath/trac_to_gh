I don't think it makes sense to support software version numbers (i.e., literals of that type) as a "native" type in a CAS;  nobody will mind adding a *class* for versions, its constructor(s) taking a string (or probably also a float) argument, but this ticket is (currently) about the former.

Prepending a "v" could perhaps be a compromise, avoiding trouble (i.e., ambiguities) with floating-point literals, but I personally wouldn't like it either.

Yes.

If we ever move the useful constructions into the reference manual and get rid of the constructions thing, we could replace it with "cool Sage hacks".
> +1 to going into the Sage April Fools collection

Oh, like the move to Lisp...

I'm +1 for going into standard Sage, but I don't feel strongly enough about it to argue.

Sure.

I don't think this works as well as an April Fools e-mail, since it's not actually a very major change.  And we'd have to wait almost a year anyway.  ;-)
