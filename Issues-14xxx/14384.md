Here is a doctest you can use:

```
"""
    sage: 3 - 1 - 6
    -4
    sage: 3-1-6
    3-1-6
"""
```

Anyone who writes subtraction without spaces is a barbarian so this shouldn't cause any ambiguity.

So we're seriously going to do this?

Some comments:
1. Move `class VersionNumber` somewhere else (probably `sage/misc/versionnumber.py` for lack of a better place)
2. How can I get the raw patch for this commit from github?
3. Error messages are going to be very confusing, try

```
sage: x = 4.5
sage: x.denominator()
```

    "body": "<a id='comment:14'></a>\nApparently you have a rather authoritative-sounding voice, Jason :P\n\nAs for the rationale for doing this, well, I can recall approximately the conversation which led to this patch:\n\n>Should we tag our releases as just bare numbers like 5.9 or should we put a v in front like v5.9?\n\n>Well, I think it should be just 5.9 since I'm going to type stuff like `vanilla(5.9)` into the Sage prompt and expect it to just work.\n\n>Is it that much trouble to write `vanilla('v5.9')`... wait, you're going to call `vanilla` with a *float*?\n\n>Yes! Why not?\n\n>Well then what about 4.7.2? That isn't a float...\n\n>True. But it could be an MPFR real! *hack hack*\n\n>!?\n\n>Behold, the first git-based trac ticket!\n\nBy the way, Jeroen, I noticed you semi-recently (8 months ago) merged a ticket by pulling a branch rather than applying a patch: #418. So while this might be the first git-based ticket, it's not the first pull request to the modern Sage codebase.

Apparently you have a rather authoritative-sounding voice, Jason :P

As for the rationale for doing this, well, I can recall approximately the conversation which led to this patch:

>Should we tag our releases as just bare numbers like 5.9 or should we put a v in front like v5.9?

>Well, I think it should be just 5.9 since I'm going to type stuff like `vanilla(5.9)` into the Sage prompt and expect it to just work.

>Is it that much trouble to write `vanilla('v5.9')`... wait, you're going to call `vanilla` with a *float*?

>Yes! Why not?

>Well then what about 4.7.2? That isn't a float...

>True. But it could be an MPFR real! *hack hack*

By the way, Jeroen, I noticed you semi-recently (8 months ago) merged a ticket by pulling a branch rather than applying a patch: #418. So while this might be the first git-based ticket, it's not the first pull request to the modern Sage codebase. Does this mean we could already be using a pull-request based model right now, for the Sage library at least? :)

I don't think it makes sense to support software version numbers (i.e., literals of that type) as a "native" type in a CAS;  nobody will mind adding a *class* for versions, its constructor(s) taking a string (or probably also a float) argument, but this ticket is (currently) about the former.

Prepending a "v" could perhaps be a compromise, avoiding trouble (i.e., ambiguities) with floating-point literals, but I personally wouldn't like it either.

I have to say I got a little confused seeing something associated with mpfr that had alphabet characters in it too.

Personally, I think it's not worth the cost (confusion, yet another incompatibility, etc.) to introduce these to the preparser.

If we ever move the useful constructions into the reference manual and get rid of the constructions thing, we could replace it with "cool Sage hacks".

I'm +1 for going into standard Sage, but I don't feel strongly enough about it to argue.

Sure.

I don't think this works as well as an April Fools e-mail, since it's not actually a very major change.  And we'd have to wait almost a year anyway.  ;-)
