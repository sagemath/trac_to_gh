So we're seriously going to do this?

Some comments:
1. Move `class VersionNumber` somewhere else (probably `sage/misc/versionnumber.py` for lack of a better place)
2. How can I get the raw patch for this commit from github?
3. Error messages are going to be very confusing, try

```
sage: x = 4.5
sage: x.denominator()
```

I don't think it makes sense to support software version numbers (i.e., literals of that type) as a "native" type in a CAS;  nobody will mind adding a *class* for versions, its constructor(s) taking a string (or probably also a float) argument, but this ticket is (currently) about the former.

Prepending a "v" could perhaps be a compromise, avoiding trouble (i.e., ambiguities) with floating-point literals, but I personally wouldn't like it either.

I'm +1 for going into standard Sage, but I don't feel strongly enough about it to argue.
