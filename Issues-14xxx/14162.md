                sage: complete = NonCommutativeSymmetricFunctions(ZZ).complete()
                sage: I = Composition([1,1])
                sage: x = complete.alternating_sum_of_fatter_compositions(I)
                sage: [c.parent() for c in x.coefficients()]
                [Integer Ring, Rational Field]
```
Of course, all the coefficients should be in the Integer Ring.

<a id='comment:3'></a>Ouch! 1/-1 is indeed a rational number! There are probably other
occurrences of this elsewhere in the code. We probably should have
some mantra for -1^n in a given ring.

In the mean time thanks for catching and fixing this!  It's probably
even slightly faster than before since the arithmetic is done with
plain ints.

Cheers,
