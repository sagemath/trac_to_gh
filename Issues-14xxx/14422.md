`sage.symbolic.units.is_unit` should be renamed, since there are `is_unit` methods for `Expression` and `Integer`, for example, with completely different functionality. This is confusing, especially since you can do the following:

```
sage: units.length.meter.is_unit()
True
sage: x.is_unit()
True
sage: sage.symbolic.units.is_unit(units.length.meter)
True
sage: sage.symbolic.units.is_unit(x)                
False
```

Perhaps something like `is_measurement_unit` would be better?

I believe (I haven't checked this) that those `is_unit()` methods are on instances of `Expression` and `Integer`, not for direct use. Plus by explicitly calling `sage.symbolic.units.is_unit()`, you should know what you're doing. However the `is_*` functions are deprecated from the global namespace (not to mention that it seems like this is not even in the global namespace) and this might even be a simple enough function that it can be removed, see #12824.

Thus I'm thinking this ticket should be closed, but a small patch to change the name might not hurt...
