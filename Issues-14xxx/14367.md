I have found what Sage claims is a bug in the coercion code.

```
sage: Q7 = Qp(7)
sage: r1 = (3 + 7 + 2*7^2 + 6*7^3 + 7^4 + 2*7^5 + 7^6 + 2*7^7
....:       + 4*7^8 + 6*7^9 + 6*7^10 + 2*7^11 + 7^12 + 7^13
....:       + 2*7^15 + 7^16 + 7^17 + 4*7^18 + 6*7^19 + O(7^20))
sage: N.<b> = NumberField(x^2 - 2, embedding=r1)
sage: K.<t> = N[]
sage: f = t^3 - 2*t + 1
sage: f(r1)
RuntimeError: There is a bug in the coercion code in Sage.
Both x (=1 + O(7^20)) and y (=3 + 7 + 2*7^2 + 6*7^3 + 7^4
+ 2*7^5 + 7^6 + 2*7^7 + 4*7^8 + 6*7^9 + 6*7^10 + 2*7^11 + 7^12
+ 7^13 + 2*7^15 + 7^16 + 7^17 + 4*7^18 + 6*7^19 + O(7^20))
are supposed to have identical parents but they don't.
In fact, x has parent '7-adic Field with capped relative precision 20'
whereas y has parent '7-adic Ring with capped relative precision 20'
Original elements 1 (parent Number Field in b with defining polynomial x^2 - 2)
and 3 + 7 + 2*7^2 + 6*7^3 + 7^4 + 2*7^5 + 7^6 + 2*7^7 + 4*7^8
+ 6*7^9 + 6*7^10 + 2*7^11 + 7^12 + 7^13 + 2*7^15 + 7^16 + 7^17
+ 4*7^18 + 6*7^19 + O(7^20) (parent 7-adic Ring with capped
relative precision 20) and maps
<type 'sage.rings.number_field.number_field_morphisms.NumberFieldEmbedding'>
Generic morphism:
  From: Number Field in b with defining polynomial x^2 - 2
  To:   7-adic Ring with capped relative precision 20
  Defn: b -> 3 + 7 + 2*7^2 + 6*7^3 + 7^4 + 2*7^5 + 7^6
  + 2*7^7 + 4*7^8 + 6*7^9 + 6*7^10 + 2*7^11 + 7^12 + 7^13
  + 2*7^15 + 7^16 + 7^17 + 4*7^18 + 6*7^19 + O(7^20)
<type 'NoneType'> None
```

Note that here the embedding of `N` is into `Qp(7)`
and that `r1` is an element of `Zp(7)`.
If I define `r1` as an element of `Qp(7)`
then the evaluation of `f` works.

If I now do

```
sage: Z7 = Zp(7)
sage: r1 = Z7(3 + 7 + 2*7^2 + 6*7^3 + 7^4 + 2*7^5 + 7^6 + 2*7^7
....:         + 4*7^8 + 6*7^9 + 6*7^10 + 2*7^11 + 7^12 + 7^13
....:         + 2*7^15 + 7^16 + 7^17 + 4*7^18 + 6*7^19)
sage: M.<b> = NumberField(x^2 - 2, embedding=r1)
sage: K.<t> = M[]
sage: f = t^3-2*t+1
sage: f(r1)
RuntimeError
...
```

I see here two problems. The most obvious is that I would
expect `f(r1)` to work. The second one is in the latter.

```
sage: M.coerce_embedding()
Generic morphism:
  From: Number Field in b with defining polynomial x^2 - 2
  To:   7-adic Ring with capped relative precision 20
  Defn: b -> 3 + 7 + 2*7^2 + 6*7^3 + 7^4 + 2*7^5 + 7^6
  + 2*7^7 + 4*7^8 + 6*7^9 + 6*7^10 + 2*7^11 + 7^12 + 7^13
  + 2*7^15 + 7^16 + 7^17 + 4*7^18 + 6*7^19 + O(7^20)
```

This morphism should NOT be an embedding.
It is not defined for 1/7:

```
sage: phi = M.coerce_embedding()
sage: phi(M(1/7))
7^-1 + O(7^19)
sage: phi(M(1/7)) in phi.codomain()
False
```

give an error if `r1` (or the root of `x^2-2` close to `r1`) is not invertible in its parent? I guess we are supposing that the embedding implied here is into `parent(r1)`? Note that the definition of `Q7` in the above example is entirely irrelevant. The `NumberField` constructor is in no way indicating that an embedding into *that* `Q7` is requested.

I guess one option would be to let `embedding` try to construct a parent in which the image of b is invertible, based on the parent inferred from `r1`.

(rant)

In general, I think the rule "when in doubt, refuse the temptation to quess" has served python extremely well and sage would do well to follow that rule as much as possible too. At least the "fundamental functionality" in sage should be free from guess-work.

If people then want to layer convenience functions and constructors on top that try to guess what the user meant from underspecified or malformed input, that's fine, but it should not contaminate the layer that provides the real functionality.

(/rant)

So perhaps just fail, citing that sending `b` to `r1` does not map `N` into a subfield of `parent(r1)`.

I have added a patch to this issue. The code did not check if there is an embedding.

My opinion is that embeddings should be pretty explicit. So if the embedding parameter is set to an exact root of the defining polynomial and there is no embedding to the parent of the value raise a ValueError. If the value is a (rDF, integer etc.) approximate root then the code is notchanged. This can lead to some unexpected behavior, 

```
sage: NumberField(x-1, 'a', embedding=1)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: there is no embedding into Integer Ring
sage: NumberField(x-1, 'a', embedding=2).coerce_embedding()
Generic morphism:
  From: Number Field in a with defining polynomial x - 1
  To:   Real Lazy Field
  Defn: a -> 1
```

The alternative would be to create a new parent, but I would like to eliminate guessings as much as possible.

I have not changed the behavior of Sage, only rise an error when the current code provides a wrong result. I agree that it is strange.

Just to clarify, current behavior of Sage:

* When there is an exact root of the polynomial, use the parent of the element to determine the codomain of the embedding (wrong, since the codomain may not contain a subfield isomorphic to the number field).

* When the embedding provides only an approximation of the root, use real/complex lazy field. (Note that this does not work for p-addic approximation of the root for instance).

I see the following solutions. I only describe possible outcomes where given an exact root p with parent P, I would not change approximate solutions.

1) My patch approach. If there is not an embedding from QQ to P, raise a ValueError, no exceptions.

2) Take R = coercion_model.common_parent(QQ,P) to determine the codomain of the embedding. Still check that there is an embedding from QQ to R (so no zero ring as codomain, for instance).

3) A compromise, usually in Sage, exceptions are made for Integer inputs and treat them as rationals if necessary, we could take that into account. But then, I would expect the following behaviour:

* `NumberField(x-1,'a',embedding=1)` creates the number field with an embedding to QQ
* `NumberField(x-1,'a',embedding=2)` creates the number field with an embedding to real lazy field.

There are other cumbersome options, like specifying the codomain, but I do not see a lot the point. Personally, I do not like 2. Nils, what would you think what would you think that would make a sensible approach?
