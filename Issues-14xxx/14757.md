sage: Poset({1: [], 2: [], 3: []}).show()
```

It shows all three elements as the same point. I suspect this hails from the `plot` method on Poset, since a digraph with no edges shows fine.

In the docstring of the `plot` method on Poset, there's also a typo: `empy`.

EDIT: This one can only be reproduced without dot2tex installed, since the methods branch depending on whether it is there or not.

Here is my queue on sage-5.10rc1:

```
darij@travis-virtualbox:~/sage-5.10.rc1/devel/sage-main$ hg qapplied
trac_8392-check_permutation-ts.patch
trac_14724-tableau_to_permutation_and_friend-cs.patch
trac_7983-major_index-dg.patch
trac_14748_deprecationwarning.patch
trac_14136-p_partition_enumerator_folded.patch
trac_14757-acyclic_layout-dg.patch
```

I don't see which of these should conflict with the patch...
