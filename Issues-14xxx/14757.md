sage: Poset({1: [], 2: [], 3: []}).show()
```

It shows all three elements as the same point. I suspect this hails from the `plot` method on Poset, since a digraph with no edges shows fine.

In the docstring of the `plot` method on Poset, there's also a typo: `empy`.

EDIT: This one can only be reproduced without dot2tex installed, since the methods branch depending on whether it is there or not.
