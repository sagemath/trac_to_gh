I'm glad you're working on this stuff.  Here are some comments:

* There are test failures to fix but they look simple.
* Rather than `@abstract_method` you should use the `required_methods` function from `sage.categories.Category`.  Most of the functions on these categories should not actually be implemented on the category but rather included in the output of `required_methods`.
* In power series rings it's probably worth giving some examples with infinite precision to highlight the difference with p-adic rings.

I am not sure I understand your point. Looking at the patch, those
methods are not implemented on the category (just declared as abstract
methods), and it's those declarations that get them included in
``required_methods``.

Other than this, just for checking (and showing off my incompetence on
the topic at hand), it's on purpose that a discrete valuation field is
not a discrete valuation ring?

Cheers,
                         Nicolas

Fixed.

> * Rather than `@abstract_method` you should use the `required_methods` function from `sage.categories.Category`.  Most of the functions on these categories should not actually be implemented on the category but rather included in the output of `required_methods`.

cf Nicolas' answer: I think that the "right way" is to decorate these functions by `@abstract_method`, so that they are automatically discovered by `required_methods`.

> * In power series rings it's probably worth giving some examples with infinite precision to highlight the difference with p-adic rings.

I don't understand what you are saying: do you mean that I should add some doctests in `sage.rings.power_series_ring` and `sage.rings.power_series_ring_element` to highlight this difference?
