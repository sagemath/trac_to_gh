I am not sure I understand your point. Looking at the patch, those
methods are not implemented on the category (just declared as abstract
methods), and it's those declarations that get them included in
``required_methods``.

Other than this, just for checking (and showing off my incompetence on
the topic at hand), it's on purpose that a discrete valuation field is
not a discrete valuation ring?

Cheers,
                         Nicolas

cf Nicolas' answer: I think that the "right way" is to decorate these functions by ``@`abstract_method`, so that they are automatically discovered by `required_methods`.

> * In power series rings it's probably worth giving some examples with infinite precision to highlight the difference with p-adic rings.


I don't understand what you are saying: do you mean that I should add some doctests in `sage.rings.power_series_ring` and `sage.rings.power_series_ring_element` to highlight this difference?

Because it uses sage-git with the dev scripts. It cannot really go in before #14482 gets in (and it might need fiddling with the branch, then, I'll keep an eye on it).

Any idea why David's branch does not have a link?
