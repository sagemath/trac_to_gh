<a id='comment:6'></a>The errors are because pycrpto wants a secure (hum, let's say more side channel attacks resistant) implem of modular exponentiation or issues a warning.
It's available as mpz_powm_sec from recent GMP releases, but MPIR does not supply that.
(Also note that wiith FLINT 2.4 we should be able to build all of Sage IIRC on top of gmp, time for a new spkg?)
So we should just ignore the warnings (or add them to the doctests but would fail with Sage on top of GMP).
Anyway, we don't really care within Sage, at least that's my point of view, nobody would or should use Sage to do real crypto.
