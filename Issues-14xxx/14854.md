The errors are because pycrpto wants a secure (hum, let's say more side channel attacks resistant) implem of modular exponentiation or issues a warning.
It's available as mpz_powm_sec from recent GMP releases, but MPIR does not supply that.
(Also note that wiith FLINT 2.4 we should be able to build all of Sage IIRC on top of gmp, time for a new spkg?)
So we should just ignore the warnings (or add them to the doctests but would fail with Sage on top of GMP).
Anyway, we don't really care within Sage, at least that's my point of view, nobody would or should use Sage to do real crypto.

The solution I've implemented is to filter pycrypto warnings in the warnings module.
Feel free to say it is a bad solution and we should rather modify the tests, or move the piece of code I've added somewhere else (maybe it really slows down Sage startup, I don't know).

Unfortunately I'm not sure I can do anything else as what I did as the warning only comes up the first time the BinaryStrings().encoding("") is used so it depends on the order the tests within the file will be run.

Maybe better reimplement bytes_to_long and long_to_bytes directly.

The order of doctests is top to bottom, isn't it?
