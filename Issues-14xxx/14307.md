When run inside nohup test are failing to run with the new doctesting framework in 5.9.beta0. An example

```
fbissey@QCD-nzi3 /home/work/fbissey/sandbox/sage-5.9.beta0 $ ./sage -t --long "devel/sage-main/sage/misc/inline_fortran.py"

----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Total time for all tests: 1.1 seconds
    cpu time: 0.1 seconds
    cumulative wall time: 1.1 seconds
```
But when the same thing is run with nohup 

```
nohup ./sage -t --long "devel/sage-main/sage/misc/inline_fortran.py" &
```
The output is

```

`nohup` is crazy. It opens the standard **input** for **writing** and claims it's a feature. From `nohup` sources:

```
  /* If standard input is a tty, replace it with /dev/null if possible.
     Note that it is deliberately opened for *writing*,
     to ensure any read evokes an error.  */
  if (ignoring_input)
    {
      if (fd_reopen (STDIN_FILENO, "/dev/null", O_WRONLY, 0) < 0)
        {
          error (0, errno, _("failed to render standard input unusable"));
          exit (exit_internal_failure);
        }
      if (!redirecting_stdout && !redirecting_stderr)
        error (0, 0, _("ignoring input"));
    }

From the info page this is a GNU extension

```
   If standard input is a terminal, it is redirected from `/dev/null'
so that terminal sessions do not mistakenly consider the terminal to be
used by the command.  This is a GNU extension; programs intended to be
portable to non-GNU hosts should use `nohup COMMAND [ARG]... </dev/null'
instead.
```
I guess I will try the last bit.
