Hey Frederic,

This is a good first implementation. Perhaps as a follow-up at some point, exterior and super-commutative algebras should has specific implementations to take advantage of their structure for speed; as well as special functions for these algebras (such as differentiation/integration for exterior algebras). Anyways, for a later ticket.

Thanks,

Travis
