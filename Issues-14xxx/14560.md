Since they currently are not hashable:

```
sage: GT = GelfandTsetlinPattern([[3,1],[2]])
sage: GT
[[3, 1], [2]]
sage: hash(GT)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
...
TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'
```
