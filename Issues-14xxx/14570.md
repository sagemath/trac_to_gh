Nice for at least two reasons:

1. Can grep through source code and not pick up any matches from autogenerated c files
2. (mostly for git) Don't have to have all c/cpp files ignored by revision control

Apply:
* new SPKG: http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/ohanar/spkgs/cython-0.19.1.p0.spkg ([spkg diff](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket14570/cython-0.19.1.p0.diff.gz))
* [attachment: trac14570.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket14570/trac14570.patch.gz) to sage library

Depends on #14569

We should probably wait with this feature until Cython supports a true `VPATH`, or at least symlinks the source files instead of copying all of them.

P.S.: GNU `grep` supports inclusion / exclusion of files / dirs /  filename patterns, to be specified on the command line or taken from a file (similar to `tar`).  And (probably dynamically) generating `.gitignore` files shouldn't be too hard either.

gnu autotools has VPATH support. it should be implemented with the usual interface, not with ad-hoc hacks.

once sage (the distribution) is configurable (im working on it...) it will be extemely convenient to be able to have differently configured sage builds without complicating/breaking the internal sage build logic even more.

if the cythonize doesnt support VPATH cleanly (yet?) use autotools for the build. it's much simpler, straightforward, faster and well designed. no need to reinvent the wheel.

This kind of feedback should really be directed to Cython upstream. If somebody is reinventing the wheel here, it's Cython, not Sage.

The build system choice is clearly on the sage side. Just because the
"build system" that cython provides lacks functionality, doesn't mean
that I expect them to fix it.

What are you trying to say (I dont want python to use automake.)?

Do you agree that
- Sage is built mostly by cython and gcc,
- gcc does not use distutils and
- Sage is not python?

> So what you ask might not easily be doable.

I am not asking for anything. Its just a proposal on how to fix it.

Most things are implemented and ready-to-use within autotools, much more
than distutils can ever dream of. Currently, just cython build rules
need to be added manually (and are supported like any other custom build
rules). native support for pyx->c->so within autotools is just a
question of time.

Note that one alternative would be autogenerating setup.py and
module_list.py from templates with autoconf (yes, autoconf implements
the checks we need). I doubt that this can either be as functional nor
maintainable as a clean-room autotools-based implementation...

And yes, it's doable with autotools. Any better ideas?

Sage uses Cython's `cythonize()` as build system. There is Cython-the-compiler and `cythonize+distutils`-the-build-system.

For different meanings of "built by": yes.

Really, does autotools support Cython dependency checking?

Thats a question of wheter cython supports writing out dependencies. See #14728 for a patch.
