`Parent.discover_coerce_map_from` used to always give priority to coercions that start with applying an embedding over those provided by `_coerce_map_from_`. This leads to coercion failures such as the following:

```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^2+1/2, embedding=CC(0,1))
sage: L = NumberField(x^2+2, 'b', embedding=1/a)     
sage: R = PolynomialRing(L, 'x')

This patch series modifies the coercion discovery algorithm to fix the issue, and fixes or works around a few weaknesses in existing code exposed by the change. See the individual commit messages for details.

Apparently, the problem is more general stems from the policy of `Parent.discover_coerce_map_from` of always giving priority to coercions that start with applying an embedding over those provided by `_coerce_map_from_`.

In the special case of this ticket, a workaround would be to revert part of a3c5958b8e6983a3ef8466d0bd0b6ce09fd32d41 so that the `BaseringInjection` gets registered as early as possible:

(I didn't check whether this breaks anything else.)

But the same issue potentially affects anything constructed over a base ring with `coerce_embedding`. At best, a suboptimal coercion is found:

```
sage: M = MatrixSpace(L, 2, 2)
sage: M.coerce_map_from(L)
Composite map:
  From: Number Field in b with defining polynomial x^2 + 2
  To:   Full MatrixSpace of 2 by 2 dense matrices over Number Field in b with defining polynomial x^2 + 2
  Defn:   Generic morphism:
          From: Number Field in b with defining polynomial x^2 + 2
          To:   Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^2 + 1/2
          Defn: b -> -2*a
        then
          Call morphism:
          From: Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^2 + 1/2
          To:   Full MatrixSpace of 2 by 2 dense matrices over Number Field in b with defining polynomial x^2 + 2

  Defn:   Generic morphism:

          To:   Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^2 + 1/2
          Defn: b -> -2*a
        then
          Conversion map:
          From: Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^2 + 1/2
          To:   Power Series Ring in x over Number Field in b with defining polynomial x^2 + 2
```

and at worst the construction itself fails (well, I'm assuming it's the same issue as above, but I didn't check in detail):

Here's an attempt to fix the problem with a small change to the coercion discovery algorithm. It does break a few things, but I'd argue it only does so by exposing weaknesses in existing code. The other patches in the series fix (or, in one case, work around) these weaknesses.

See the commit messages for details.

If you already have a git-based installation of sage (i.e. you once did something like `git clone https://github.com/sagemath/sage.git && git checkout -b origin/build_system && make build`) and a remote that refers to the trac server, you just need to fetch and checkout the branch `u/mmezzarobba/coerce_embeddings` from trac and review the three commits on top of `build_system` just like you would if they were patches you just applied.

Otherwise, hmm, I guess it is easier to set up a git-based installation than to try to do the review with Mercurial... See
http://sagemath.github.io/git-developer-guide/
(or ask!) in case you need more information on how to do that.

If the branch was based off an old version of sage, I guess you might also want to check that it merges cleanly, but here it is already a descendant of the last beta.

All three commits need review, and none of them is part of any other ticket.

I have. But at least on one of my machines I get several doctest errors with the latest git version.

I did store my ssh keys on trac. But "having a remote" sounds like I need to inform git about the existence of the trac server.

I hope the meaning and how-to of "fetch" and "checkout" will be clear to me from the git-developer-guide.

I saw this (or an old version) before, which made me register my ssh keys, for example.

It fails totally, it seems.

Namely, in my git install of sage (which I kept up to date by `git pull` followed by make), I tried

```
simon@linux-sqwp:~/SAGE/GIT/sage> ./sage -dev create-ticket
sage-run received unknown option: -dev 
usage: sage [options]
Try 'sage -h' for more information.
```
`sage -dev create-ticket` is about the first example of using the development scripts in the development guide!

Yes. These are rather minor issues that are handled elsewhere.

Yes:

```
git remote add trac ssh://git@trac.sagemath.org:2222/sage.git
```

(With this setup, `git fetch trac` will automatically download copies of all branches available on the trac server. This will likely mean hundreds of branches when everyone switches to git. They don't live in the same namespace as your local branches and don't pollute the output of most commands. But if you don't like that behaviour, you can use `-t` to limit the subset of branches to track.)

* fetch = synchronize your local repository's view of the branches on trac (!= your local branches) with their remote state:

```
git fetch trac
```

* checkout = get the contents of a given revision in the form of actual files in your working directory:

```
git checkout -b my_local_review_branch -t trac/u/mmezzarobba/coerce_embeddings
```

* The last command also sets up a local branch for you to work on (e.g., to prepare a reviewer patch). If you only want to have a look at some remote branch, you can omit the `-b` and `-t` options. git will issue a scary warning about detached heads. That "detached head state" is when you don't have anywhere to commit your changes if you make any.

If you want to prepare a reviewer patch, you will need to:

* Make your changes.

* Commit them to your local review branch (`git commit -a` to commit everything).

* (Repeat if there are several unrelated changes.)

* Once you are happy with your local changes, push them somewhere on trac:

```
git push trac my_local_review_branch:trac/u/SimonKing/coerce_embeddings
```

* Tell me about the new branch you created on trac, or just put its name in the Branch: field.

> No idea about this. From the discussion on sage-git, it seems to me that the git branches can be totally orthogonal to what one used to do with patches. A branch may span over different tickets,

A git branch is just a pointer to a commit (and thus implicitly to everything that precedes it history-wise). So in some sense it every branch spans the whole history of sage, but otherwise a branch cannot really span several tickets.

(There are several other kinds of "pointers to commits" in git. Branches are pointers to commit that move up  automatically when new commits are added "on" them.)

> and it is totally unclear *from the commits themselves* which of them belong to a ticket and which of them belong to a dependency. That's bad for reviewing. In the old model, one would talk about a list of patches *attached to the ticket*, which makes it crystal clear what ticket a patch belongs to.

I agree, and that's why I started this thread...

Sorry for the late reply. There were a few conflicts indeed. I did the merge, and the tests still pass, except that I'm getting a timeout with `sage/rings/number_field/number_field.py` and random segfaults with some other files.

For instance:

```
$ sage -t -a
...
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage -t src/sage/rings/number_field/number_field.py  # Time out
sage -t src/sage/rings/number_field/number_field_element_quadratic.pyx  # Killed due to segmentation fault
sage -t src/sage/groups/abelian_gps/values.py  # Killed due to segmentation fault
----------------------------------------------------------------------
```

but then:

```
$ sage -t src/sage/rings/number_field/number_field_element_quadratic.pyx
Running doctests with ID 2013-11-27-23-09-47-2b207575.
Doctesting 1 file.
sage -t src/sage/rings/number_field/number_field_element_quadratic.pyx
    [420 tests, 7.97 s]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
----------------------------------------------------------------------
```


```
$ sage -t src/sage/groups/abelian_gps/values.py
Running doctests with ID 2013-11-27-23-10-03-7a10efd7.
Doctesting 1 file.

    [81 tests, 0.11 s]

All tests passed!

```

Hello,

I have a question related to number fields (in particular #18226 and #17830). I do want a direct coercion `number field -> RIF` based on the (future) `_mpfr_` method of elements. Right now, the route is long as the discoevery algorithm tells me that I need to do `number field -> RLF -> RIF` (and actually there is `QQbar` hidden in the middle). I guess that the proposition here would solve this issue! That would be fantastic.

Vincent

you refer to `__an_element`. But you changed the attribute's name to `_cache_an_element`.

The hack for quadratic number field is horrible... At least could we replace

You are the one who introduced it, aren't you? `;-)` So I guess you understand what it is for better than I do. In any case I just tested the change you suggested (on top of my branch + the current master) and it doesn't seem to break anything.

Thanks, your fix is much better than what I did (even though the particular issue would probably have been solved by the ticket about `I`). Just one question: why are you doing

```
    try:
        zero = R.zero()
    except AttributeError:
        zero = R(0)
    try:
        one = R.one()
    except AttributeError:
        one = R(1)
```
instead of just

```
    zero = R(0)
    one = R(1)
```
(Are there cases where `R.zero()` would work but not `R(0)`? Or is it faster that way when `R` is a `Parent`, despite the `try`/`catch` block? And then, does speed matter?)

> If you like it just cherry-pick it on top of your branch.

I guess I will even rebase the whole thing and merge related commits when we're done talking about it.

Here is an example:

```
sage: C = GF(5).cartesian_product(GF(5))
sage: C(0)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: 'sage.rings.integer.Integer' object is not iterable
sage: C(1)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: 'sage.rings.integer.Integer' object is not iterable
sage: C.zero()
(0, 0)
sage: C.one()
(1, 1)
```
But I guess that it should work because there always is a canonical morphism `ZZ -> ring`. And here not

```
sage: C.has_coerce_map_from(ZZ)
False
```
So do not worry about this example. The version with `zero = R(0)` and `one = R(1)` is much simpler. And anyway it is completely broken

```
sage: cyclotomic_value(4, C.one())
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: unsupported operand parent(s) for '-':
'The cartesian product of (Finite Field of size 5, Finite Field of size 5)'
and '<type 'int'>'
sage: q_binomial(4, 2, C.one())
Traceback (most recent call last):
..
RuntimeError: maximum recursion depth exceeded while calling a Python object
```
Actually, this last example with infinite recursion is related to coercions... so potentially there is something to dig further.

> But this example already didn't work before this ticket, did it?

Nope. Completely unrelated. Actually, it is related in the sense that the was appearing in `prod(1 - q**i ...)`. And apparently it was the unique reason of this huge `try/except` block that is removed by my commit.

Hello,

I am not sure I am the best person to do the complete review. But...

1. Is this really the example you wanted to show `MatrixSpace(L, 2, 2).coerce_map_from(L)`. Wouldn't be better to test `MatrixSpace(K, 2, 2).coerce_map_from(L)`? Idem for the one with `PowerSeriesRing` that follows.

2. With your modifications the following changes. Old version:

```
sage: C12.<zeta12> = CyclotomicField(12)
sage: C4.<zeta4> = CyclotomicField(4, embedding=zeta12**3)
sage: PowerSeriesRing(C12, 'x').coerce_map_from(C4)
Composite map:
  From: Cyclotomic Field of order 4 and degree 2
  To:   Power Series Ring in x over Cyclotomic Field of order 12 and degree 4
  Defn:   Generic morphism:
          From: Cyclotomic Field of order 4 and degree 2
          To:   Cyclotomic Field of order 12 and degree 4
          Defn: zeta4 -> zeta12^3
        then
          Conversion map:
          From: Cyclotomic Field of order 12 and degree 4
          To:   Power Series Ring in x over Cyclotomic Field of order 12 and degree 4
```
  Versus new version:

```
sage: PowerSeriesRing(C12, 'x').coerce_map_from(C4)
Conversion map:
  From: Cyclotomic Field of order 4 and degree 2
  To:   Power Series Ring in x over Cyclotomic Field of order 12 and degree 4
sage: timeit("mor(a)", number=5000, repeat=6)
5000 loops, best of 6: 120 µs per loop
```
  whereas for `PolynomialRing` the behavior is identical (similar to the "old version" above). Is it the kind of thing that you expected?

Vincent

Yes, I think it is, because I wanted to illustrate that the way coercions are discovered in the presence of an embedding makes it difficult to work with structures that have the “embedded” parent as a base ring, even if the parent into which it is embedded plays no role in the construction. But I wrote this comment more than 1½ years ago, so I'm not sure I remember correctly!

Sorry, I'm not sure I understand the question. Let me try to answer it anyway: the goal of these patches is to make the coercion discovery algorithm *consider* paths that don't start with the embedding. These paths may or may not be selected depending on each particular case.

Are these lines a copy-paste error, or did you observe a speed regression with some coercions? (On my machine, applying the morphism returned by `PowerSeriesRing(C12, 'x').coerce_map_from(C4)` takes almost exactly as much time before and after my patches.)

Salut Marc,

I am quite confused by the following

```
sage: K = QuadraticField(2)
sage: RR.coerce_map_from(K)
Composite map:
  From: Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^2 - 2
  To:   Real Field with 53 bits of precision
  Defn:   Generic morphism:
          From: Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^2 - 2
          To:   Real Lazy Field
          Defn: a -> 1.414213562373095?
        then
          Conversion via _mpfr_ method map:
          From: Real Lazy Field
          To:   Real Field with 53 bits of precision
```
But elements of `K` do implement directly an `_mpfr_` method

```
sage: K.an_element()._mpfr_
<built-in method _mpfr_ of sage.rings.number_field.number_field_element_quadratic.NumberFieldElement_quadratic object at 0x7f3e3d94ff68>
```
So why the discovery does not choose this direct conversion map instead of going through the real lazy field? (note: this method `_mpfr_` is completely broken, but it does not change anything to the story)

Vincent

Salut Vincent,

I think the reason is that `RR` explicitly asks for coercions into it through `RLF` (see the very last line of `RealField_class._coerce_map_from_`. So the step of the coercion discovery algorithm that calls `_coerce_map_from_` (step 2 with my patch) succeeds. The map it finds is of type `FormalCompositeMap`, so the next step (which would consider the coercions defined using `_populate_coercion_lists_`, including `_mpfr_`) is not even tried.

As far as I understand, this is the intended behavior from the point of view of the coercion discovery algorithm—`_coerce_map_from_` “knows better”, do as it says. In any case the fact that the coercion from `K` to `RLF` is an embedding doesn't come into play. (But this ticket should make it possible to chose the coercion via `_mpfr_` by modifying `RealField_class._coerce_map_from_`, while this wouldn't work now due to the special treatment of embeddings.)

Yield the domain of self. In general, iterate over the domains of
the factors of a composite map.
```
Could you be more precise in the documentation and precise why is it here?
