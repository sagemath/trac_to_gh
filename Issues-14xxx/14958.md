Reasons for status change to needs_info:

- the 'tree' terminology (see http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/14958#comment:6); I think that `PseudoConwayPolyTree` should be changed to `PseudoConwayLattice` or something similar.

- during Sage Days 51, Jenny Cooley found a paper claiming that there is a mistake in one of the algorithms in the article of Heath and Loehr cited in the code.  We should check that the error is not in this patch.

I agree.
I also don't really feel satisfied with the way all these polynomials are stored right now, but I'm not sure I'll come up with anything quickly.

I think it's fixed in David's implementation.
That's what got me confused at http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/8335#comment:55 because I thought the addition David made were not needed, and then i realized they were: http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/8335#comment:57.

These changes all look good to me.

Actually, I realised that we never call `irreducible_element(n, algorithm='pseudo-conway')` in #8335, so it is not even necessary to allow this parameter.  In fact, it may cause confusion, since creating a single pseudo-Conway polynomial really only makes sense in the context of a lattice.  Without that, a pseudo-Conway polynomial is nothing more than a primitive polynomial!

I confess that I never got around to learning what exactly `weakref` does, until now.  I just read the relevant parts of [http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0205/](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0205/) and see why we may have to be careful.  I think this question is mostly relevant to #8335, so let's not move that discussion here; let me just say for now that I agree that `weakref` does not appear to be the ideal solution to our caching problem.

<a id='comment:13'></a>While working on #14990, it occurred to me that this patch could be simplified substantially.  I am attaching a new version that gives an extremely intuitive interface to pseudo-Conway lattices:

```
class PseudoConwayLattice(SageObject)
    def __init__(self, p, use_database=True)
    def polynomial(self, n)
```
This is morally equivalent to a construction of an algebraic closure of **F**<sub>*p*</sub> with a method that returns the unique subfield of degree *n*.

The method `get_pseudo_conway_polynomial()` is now simply called `polynomial()`.  The functions `find_pseudo_conway_polynomial_tree()` and `compute_pseudo_conway_polynomial()` have been dissolved into `__init__()` and `polynomial()`.  The global variables to implement caching are gone.
