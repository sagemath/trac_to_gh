I rebased and updated the code written by David Roe and Jean-Pierre Flori.

One important question before me or someone else reviews this: why does this patch introduce objects that are called pseudo-Conway polynomial ***trees***?  This strongly suggests that the system of compatible finite fields that it represents forms a tree, which is definitely NOT the case.  This is the whole reason why all of this work needs to be done to get such a system of finite fields!

Reasons for status change to needs_info:

- the 'tree' terminology (see [#14958 comment:6](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/14958#comment:6)); I think that `PseudoConwayPolyTree` should be changed to `PseudoConwayLattice` or something similar.

I agree.
I also don't really feel satisfied with the way all these polynomials are stored right now, but I'm not sure I'll come up with anything quickly.

I think it's fixed in David's implementation.
That's what got me confused at [#8335 comment:55](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/8335#comment:55) because I thought the addition David made were not needed, and then i realized they were: [#8335 comment:57](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/8335#comment:57).

I'd say David used the term tree because a PCPT objecgt only contains one layer of references, i.e. a pseudo-conway poly and refs to the PCPTs for n/q where q is a prime divisor of n.

Some minor remarks:
* I think we should add a warning that PCPTs are only weakrefed. I saw that you correctly took care of that in #8335, thanks for that.
* At some point the new doc says "The following demonstrate coercions", shouldn't it be "demonstrates"? (please pardon me if I'm wrong, I'm no english expert).
* The doc changes corresponding to the fix mentionned in [#8335 comment:59](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/8335#comment:59) are missing; it should not read:

```
            If False, then `n` is prime and 
            no references are stored (since there is no compatibility 
            condition).
```
  but:

  ```
            If ``False``, then `n == 1` and no references are stored 
            (since there is no compatiblity condition).
  ```

These changes all look good to me.

Actually, I realised that we never call `irreducible_element(n, algorithm='pseudo-conway')` in #8335, so it is not even necessary to allow this parameter.  In fact, it may cause confusion, since creating a single pseudo-Conway polynomial really only makes sense in the context of a lattice.  Without that, a pseudo-Conway polynomial is nothing more than a primitive polynomial!

I confess that I never got around to learning what exactly `weakref` does, until now.  I just read the relevant parts of [http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0205/](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0205/) and see why we may have to be careful.  I think this question is mostly relevant to #8335, so let's not move that discussion here; let me just say for now that I agree that `weakref` does not appear to be the ideal solution to our caching problem.

While working on #14990, it occurred to me that this patch could be simplified substantially.  I am attaching a new version that gives an extremely intuitive interface to pseudo-Conway lattices:

```
class PseudoConwayLattice(SageObject)
    def __init__(self, p, use_database=True)
    def polynomial(self, n)
```
This is morally equivalent to a construction of an algebraic closure of **F**<sub>*p*</sub> with a method that returns the unique subfield of degree *n*.

The method `get_pseudo_conway_polynomial()` is now simply called `polynomial()`.  The functions `find_pseudo_conway_polynomial_tree()` and `compute_pseudo_conway_polynomial()` have been dissolved into `__init__()` and `polynomial()`.  The global variables to implement caching are gone.
