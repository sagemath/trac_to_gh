Helloooooooooooo !!!

Recently a test did not pass in `generic_graph.py` when using CPLEX. And I got the same problem with a MILP I am work on, the two of them being probably related by their common use of constants with many decimals.

```

This is because the two variables that are currently used in Sage to detect whether the problem is unfeasible or unbounded do not actually say whether the PROBLEM has this property, but whether the "current solution" has "been checked to satisfy" this property. Hence, a difference.

This patch uses the correct variable. And the doctest pass, and my MILP which are NEVER unbounded are not unbounded either `:-P`

The patch is working and solves the issue. However, I don't understand why you put commas after some declarations. Is it a mistake or is it useful?

Mistake ! It has no interest that I know of, and seems to be ignored by Cython. Patch updated !
