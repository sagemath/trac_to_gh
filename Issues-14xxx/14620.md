It would be nice to have an adaptive algorithm for numerical evaluation of expression and number field elements. This would avoid the following behavior

```
sage: a = (106*pi - 333) / (355 - 113*pi)
sage: a.n(digits=5)
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
ValueError: power::eval(): division by zero
sage: a.n(digits=6)
289.000
sage: a.n(digits=7)
289.0000
sage: a.n(digits=8)
293.65079
sage: a.n(digits=9)
292.772502
sage: a.n(digits=10)
292.6277805
sage: a.n(digits=11)
292.63234726
```
where we can not rely on the last digits.
