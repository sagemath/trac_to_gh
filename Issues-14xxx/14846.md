<div id="comment:0"></div>

The *CycleIndexSeries* class inherits *derivative*, *integral*, and *exponential* methods from its parent class *LazyPowerSeries*. However, these operations (which are perfectly reasonable at the *LazyPowerSeries* level) are not combinatorially natural. In fact, there is a differentiation operator on cycle index series, but it's something entirely different, and anti-differentiation is in general impossible!

In addition to being confusing, this discrepancy has the potential to hinder work using the *CycleIndexSeries* class. The combinatorial operation of cycle index differentiation is very useful in enumerative work.

All that said, the existing *exponential* and *derivative* methods are used for algebraic magic tricks in some of the existing code, so it's important not to take it away altogether.

The attached patch makes the following changes:

* Adds *_lps_derivative*, *_lps_integral*, and *_lps_exponential* methods to *CycleIndexSeries* which call up using *super*.

* Refactors the internal code which previously used *exponential* and *derivative* to use *_lps_exponential* and *_lps_derivative* instead.

* Implements a new *derivative* method which computes the combinatorial derivative of a cycle index series.

* Implements a new *pointing* method which implements a related combinatorial operation.

* Implements a new *integral* method which raises a *NotImplementedError* to prevent any user confusion (since, as explained in the docstring, there may be infinitely many very distinct cycle indices with a given derivative).

* Implements a new *exponential* method which returns the composition E(self) for E the cycle index series of *SetSpecies*. 

* Implements a new *logarithm* method which returns the composition Ω(self) for Ω the cycle index series implemented in *CombinatorialLogarithmSeries*.

Docstrings and doctests are included for everything but the _lps_* methods, which just call up to ``super``. I'm not sure what a doctest for these would even look like, but I'm open to suggestions.

Skeletal doctests added for the three _lps_* functions. I have no idea whether this is the *right* way to test this sort of method, but at least it's *a* test.

Additionally, I've switched back over to using Git to manage this—the old Mercurial workflow is just too confusing. How do I tell the build bot to ignore the attachments and only use the branch?

Hi Andrew,

I'd suggest to really remove access to the three inherited methods, and rewrite the methods that use _lps_exponential accordingly:

* in set_species, we really want to return the "true" exponential cycle index series
* in partition_species, the "true" exponential of the "true" exponential - 1
* in subset_species, the square of the "true" exponential

Finally, the implementation of the "true" exponential can be taken from what's in set_species in sage 6.0.

As far as I can see, the other two methods _lps_derivative and _lps_integral are not used anywhere.

This might have a speed penalty, but I'd worry about that only if it's serious.  I think it's not a good idea to make the cycle index series depend on the species code, as in the proposed patch.

I would perhaps also put the definition for the combinatorial logarithm into the same file.  I think at some point we should reorganise the files in the species directory..

Martin

Thanks for the suggestions!

Replying to [@mantepse](#comment%3A14):
> I'd suggest to really remove access to the three inherited methods, and rewrite the methods that use _lps_exponential accordingly:

Sounds good to me. Done, in the latest push.

> * in set_species, we really want to return the "true" exponential cycle index series
> * in partition_species, the "true" exponential of the "true" exponential - 1
> * in subset_species, the square of the "true" exponential

I have rewritten all of these to use algebraic operations on the exponential CIS.

> As far as I can see, the other two methods _lps_derivative and _lps_integral are not used anywhere.

Seems to be true. I just included them for completeness. They're gone now.
 
> This might have a speed penalty, but I'd worry about that only if it's serious.  I think it's not a good idea to make the cycle index series depend on the species code, as in the proposed patch.

Actually, I think the new way should actually be *faster*, there's just one instance of the exponential series which gets cached and handed around.

> I would perhaps also put the definition for the combinatorial logarithm into the same file.

Once I wrote the other stuff, this seemed very reasonable, so I've done that as well.

Replying to [@mwhansen](#comment%3A21):
> One (minor) issue is the removal of combinatorial_logarithm.py which might need to be deprecated.  

Ah, yes, this is an important point. I sometimes forget that other people might have used my code… =D

> I've also done a "rebase" of this on top of #15673 which makes the code a little bit cleaner.  This is in branch "u/mhansen/ticket/14846" .  Ideally, I'd prefer to have #15673 go in first since the rebase/merge of this ticket is easier than the other way around.

I don't yet understand everything that's happening with #15673, but I'm starting to take a look at it. I'm definitely open to the idea, though—better series code will make all our work easier! I've taken a look at your rebased version of this, and have a few thoughts up-front:

* In the docstring for the deprecated `CombinatorialLogarithmSeries()`, you point the reader to `CycleIndexSeriesRing(R).exponential()`, but in fact this should be to `CycleIndexSeriesRing(R).omega()`.

* Relatedly, I'd argue that the `CycleIndexSeriesRing(R).omega()` and `CycleIndexSeriesRing(R).exponential()` methods should instead be named `logarithm_series()` and `exponential_series()`. In the first place, the Ω notation is not totally standard (it's used by Labelle, but other authors have called this virtual species "Con" or other things); in the second, I think it's conceptually important to emphasize that these objects are *series* and not *operations*, since the operations are implemented as `CycleIndexSeries().exponential()` and `CycleIndexSeries().logarithm()` respectively. (Of course, the documentation should mention the relationship between the two!)

* `CycleIndexSeriesRing.LogarithmStream` appears to be internal, so the docstring of `CycleIndexSeries.logarithm()` should refer instead to `CycleIndexSeriesRing.logarithm_series`.

I've updated the ticket branch to use your code with these changes. I've also set a dependency on #15673. (Evidently, I bungled the ticket modifications a bit, but I think it's all sorted now.)

I played with the code and the examples, and found myself happy.  For example,

```
sage: T = CombinatorialSpecies()
sage: X = species.SingletonSpecies()
sage: E = species.SetSpecies()
sage: T.define(X*E(T))
sage: s = T.cycle_index_series()
sage: oeis(s.logarithm().generating_series().counts(12))
0: A133297: a(n) = n!*Sum_{k=1..n} (-1)^(k+1)*n^(n-k-1)/(n-k)!.
sage: oeis(s.pointing().generating_series().counts(12)[1:])
0: A000312: Number of labeled mappings from n points to themselves (endofunctions): n^n.
1: A177885: (1-n)^(n-1).
2: A086783: Discriminant of the polynomial x^n - 1.
sage: oeis(s.pointing().isotype_generating_series().counts(12)[1:])
0: A000107: Number of rooted trees with n nodes and a single labeled node; pointed rooted trees; vertebrates.
```

Thanks for the code and thanks for the patience!
