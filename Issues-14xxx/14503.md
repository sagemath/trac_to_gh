Makes sense, and it is not likely to do anything very bad `:-D`

This being said, could you replace the line containing the link with the following ?

```
See the `Wikipedia page of Weyl Groups <Weyl_group>`.
```

That's how we now refer to Wikipedia pages `:-)`

Thanks !

Attached is an extra patch with proper Wikipedia links. In the process of learning Sage's ReST rules, I stumbled upon another broken Wikipedia link: [multicommodity flow](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/graphs/sage/graphs/generic_graph.html#sage.graphs.generic_graph.GenericGraph.multicommodity_flow). I hope that piggybacking this ticket is OK.

Gloops. The one from `generic_graph.py` is probably one of my mistakes `:-)`

Thank you for those patches ! There is no problem at all with having several patches on the same ticket. You just need to explicitly say in the ticket's description how they are to be applied in that case (just one, or the other, or both).
