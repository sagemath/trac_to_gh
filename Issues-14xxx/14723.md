When SymPy can't evaluate an integral, such as `integrate((log(x)*log(log(x))), x, algorithm='sympy')`, it returns "AttributeError: 'Integral' object has no attribute '_sage_'". It should just return an unevaluated integral, the way it does when Maxima is used.

Another example from #15256:

```
sage: a = integrate(sin(x)*tan(x), x, algorithm='sympy') 
...

 
/usr/local/sage/sage-5.11/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/symbolic/integration/external.pyc in sympy_integrator(expression, v, a, b)
     37     else:
     38         result = sympy.integrate(ex, (v, a._sympy_(), b._sympy_()))
---> 39     return result._sage_()
     40
     41 def mma_free_integrator(expression, v, a=None, b=None):
 
AttributeError: 'Integral' object has no attribute '_sage_'

---> 39     return result._sage_()
     40

<a id='comment:13'></a>
The original case is now working in sympy:

```
sage: integrate(sin(x)*tan(x), x, algorithm='sympy') 
1/2*log(sin(x) + 1) - 1/2*log(sin(x) - 1) - sin(x)
```
so we need a more complicated one:

```
sage: integrate(sin(x)*tan(x)/(1-cos(x)), x, algorithm='sympy')
integrate(-sin(x)*tan(x)/(cos(x) - 1), x)
```
However,[comment:7](#comment%3A7) is right regarding definite integrals:

```
sage: integrate(sin(x)*tan(x)/(1-cos(x)), x, a, b, algorithm='sympy')
integrate(-sin(x)*tan(x)/(cos(x) - 1), x)
```

It is a matter of either
* adding a `_sage_` method to the upstream sympy code in `sympy/integrals/integrals.py` or     
* catching the exception in `sage.symbolic.integration.external.sympy_integrator()`

EDIT: The problem with the latter is, all sorts of elementary sympy functions have a `_sage_` method, so why not add one to `sympy.Integral` or even do a bulk upgrade of sympy (e.g. `gamma._sage_` is missing too)?

The indefinite integral value at the given point. I.e., if `F(x) = integral(f(x),x)` then `F(a) = sympy.Integral(f(x), x, a)`.

> Maybe Maxima has something like this that we already translate for them?

Couldn't find such a thing.

> Do you think there is a way to deal with this by raising an error upon translation back to Sage (if that's appropriate)?  Sorry for the questions; each software has a slightly different philosophy.

Computation would be 1. compute the indef. integral; 2. if succesful substitute. So not difficult I guess.

Yeah, I never know what to do with this - even though there is no "the" indefinite integral most systems just return a convenient one.  I think that there is a problem with actually having this syntax, though, because in general there are lots of times (esp. with complicated trig stuff) that the integral you get before simplifying is one thing, the one you get if you simplify or do some trig expansion first is different, **and** they differ by a non-zero constant!  It would be very bad to have

```
sage: F(x) = complicated stuff
sage: integral(f, x, 0, hold=True).simplify()
0
sage: integral(f.some_simplification_routine(), x, 0, hold=True).simplify()
1/2
```

See also #13221 for the thought process behind #12438, though hopefully without too much of a hack it would be possible to support both, if that were desired.

I presume that the latest commit, with its`class UndefinedFunction(FunctionClass):` is the equivalent of one of the changes in the same file at [the pull request](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/8592/files), or does that need to be added upstream as well?

Given that asmeurer has also weighed in here, I think I am happy with accepting this before the pull request upstream formally joins in, though, so I'll give a positive review once I have a chance to test this a bit more (not this morning EST, my apologies).

Along these lines, we have

```
sage: integrate(integrate(integrate(f,x),y),z)
integrate(integrate(integrate(f(x, y, z), x), y), z)
```
but

```
sage: var('y z')
(y, z)
sage: f = function('f',x,y,z)
sage: f
f(x, y, z)
sage: integrate(integrate(integrate(f,x,algorithm='sympy'),y,algorithm='sympy'),z,algorithm='sympy')
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
<snip>
    690             return f_sympy(*sympy.sympify(g, evaluate=False))
    691         else:
--> 692             raise NotImplementedError("SymPy function '%s' doesn't exist" % f)
    693 
    694 sympy = SympyConverter()

NotImplementedError: SymPy function 'f' doesn't exist
sage: integrate(integrate(integrate(f,x),y),z)
```
Perhaps it would be good to fix that here, or elsewhere?

But I like that

```
sage: integrate(integrate(integrate(abs(x),x,algorithm='sympy'),y,algorithm='sympy'),z,algorithm='sympy')
integrate(y*z*abs(x), x)
sage: integrate(integrate(integrate(abs(x*y*z),x,algorithm='sympy'),y,algorithm='sympy'),z,algorithm='sympy')
integrate(integrate(integrate(abs(x*y*z), x), y), z)
```
so otherwise I think we should be good to go.

Glad I ran the tests - this is a good one to have fail, though :-)

```
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/symbolic/function.pyx", line 634, in sage.symbolic.function.Function._sympy_init_
Failed example:
    g(x)._sympy_()
Expected:
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    NotImplementedError: SymPy function 'gg' doesn't exist
Got:
    gg(x)
**********************************************************************
```
I do love that we code errors in the tests, because it's always gratifying to see when someone has fixed one.  (Can you think of another way to test that error branch, incidentally? I have to admit I can't offhand, unless it's a (very unusual!) Sage symbolic function not in Sympy, maybe something number-theoretic, or maybe just a fake function?)

No success with that, there are commits where sage fails to build or similar situations that make it a pain.

If I understand correctly, the `n` in `result = h.args[0].match(n + k)` (`recurr.py:727`) somehow ends up being different than the one in appearing in the argument of `h`, so that the match fails. I suspect there is a conversion from sympy to sage and back going on somewhere, but I have no idea how this all works...

Summary:

The Sympy patch of this branch contains two hunks, one patches `integral.py`, the other `function.py`. The latter one adds a `_sage_` method to `AppliedUndef` but uses a deprecated call method. The added `_sage_` method is already there in sympy-1 but gets deleted by a patch in #20185 because it triggers the same error in #20185 as Marc reported here (I was too stupid to rebuild Sympy to see it). So the problem actually exists. However, without the patch this branch does not work.

The first part (the one for `integral.py`) is no longer necessary because it is in Sympy already.

So what needs to be done is to fix in Sympy and/or Sage the described error. It is investigated in #20185 and its dedicated ticket is #20204, so we depend on that.
