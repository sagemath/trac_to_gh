The patch applied by ticket #13735 changes the behavior of the repr_lincomb method in misc/misc.py so that it now evaluates the comparison "c < 0" for every coefficient. However, since this method is called by CombinatorialFreeModule, which can create lienar combinations whose coefficients are elements of arbitrary rings, this comparison is not always mathematically meaningful.

For example, in the code I submitted in #14347, I build a CombinatorialFreeModule whose basis is a specified finite group G and whose coefficients are elements of a CycleIndexSeriesRing. In 5.9, this was perfectly functional; in 5.10-rc2, with the new patch, any call to `_repr_` on an element of this CombinatorialFreeModule results in a NotImplementedError because of this comparison.
