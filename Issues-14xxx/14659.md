This patch exist because I am an idiot. A C array was allocated and freed at each iteration of a loop, while it makes much more sense to allocate it BEFORE the loop begins, and free it when it ends. And the same memory segment is used all along. That's all.

This should also solve the other problem of this class : it often segfaults when using CTRL+C while it computes.

Not spending its lifetime allocating and freeing memory is definitely a step in the right direction.

And this will have to be rewritten with a real data structure someday, like the one from #14589 `>_<`

Before :

```
sage: g = graphs.CompleteMultipartiteGraph([9]*5)     
sage: %time g.subgraph_search(graphs.CompleteGraph(6))
CPU times: user 18.31 s, sys: 0.01 s, total: 18.32 s
Wall time: 18.36 s
```

After:

```
sage: g = graphs.CompleteMultipartiteGraph([9]*5)
sage: %time g.subgraph_search(graphs.CompleteGraph(6))
CPU times: user 6.95 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 6.95 s
Wall time: 6.96 s
```

Hi,

Why do you write

```
sequence[i] = 1 if self.has_arc_unsafe(vertices[i], v) else 0
```
instead of

```
sequence[i] = self.has_arc_unsafe(vertices[i], v)
```
?
