This seems to be a general weakness in Maxima's solve; if someone wants to change this to a bug and not an enhancement, be my guest.

The suggestion was made there that Sympy might be better at this.  Is it?  At least here it is giving answers - I don't think any are erroneous or missing, but I didn't check very hard, either.

```
sage: from sympy import solve as ssolve
sage: ssolve(x-sqrt(x),x)
[1, 0]
sage: ssolve(x^2-sqrt(x),x)
[1, 0]
sage: ssolve(x^2+sqrt(x),x)
[-1/2 + 3**(1/2)*I/2, -1/2 - 3**(1/2)*I/2, 0]
sage: ssolve(a*x^2+sqrt(x),x)
[(-1/a)**(2/3),
 0,
 (-1/a)**(2/3)*(-1 - 3**(1/2)*I)/2,
 (-1/a)**(2/3)*(-1 + 3**(1/2)*I)/2]
```
Does anyone know whether sympy's solve capabilities is a strict superset of Maxima's?  I assume not.
