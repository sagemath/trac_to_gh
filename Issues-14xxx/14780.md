Attached patch allows embedding Python tuples in symbolic expressions:

```
sage: t = SR._force_tuple((1, 2, x, x+1, x+2))
sage: t
(1, 2, x, x + 1, x + 2)
sage: t.subs(x = 2*x^2)
(1, 2, 2*x^2, 2*x^2 + 1, 2*x^2 + 2)
sage: t.op[0]
1
sage: t.op[2]
x
```
 
Includes pynac 0.3.2 update for explicit template instantiatitons

Yeah, I guess it could have been expected and that it is not a completely random choice that Python does not set it by default as it might expect to load a bunch of libraries and get symbols conflicts.
Though the fact that it is set by default on Darwin does not really point in that direction...

What about linking sage/symbolic/ring.pyx/so with libpynac.so? that is modify module_list.py to achieve that.

I'm playing around with marking the pynac templates external in the Sage library (C++11 feature, but unofficial in gcc for a while now). This is one way to avoid the clash. The problems seems that, on redhawk, `GiNaC::exprseq` a.k.a. `GiNaC::container<std::vector>` is not completely instantiated inside `libpynac.so`:

```
vbraun@redhawk:~/test/pynac/sage$ readelf -sW local/lib/libpynac.so  | grep _ZN5GiNaC9containerISt6vectorEC.Ev
  2014: 0000000000169620   162 FUNC    WEAK   DEFAULT   12 _ZN5GiNaC9containerISt6vectorEC2Ev
  3594: 0000000000169620   162 FUNC    WEAK   DEFAULT   12 _ZN5GiNaC9containerISt6vectorEC2Ev
```
vs. on my laptop:

```
$ readelf -sW local/lib/libpynac.so  | grep _ZN5GiNaC9containerISt6vectorEC.Ev
   468: 000000000017c46e   147 FUNC    WEAK   DEFAULT   11 _ZN5GiNaC9containerISt6vectorEC2Ev
  7994: 000000000017c46e   147 FUNC    WEAK   DEFAULT   11 _ZN5GiNaC9containerISt6vectorEC1Ev
  4012: 000000000017c46e   147 FUNC    WEAK   DEFAULT   11 _ZN5GiNaC9containerISt6vectorEC2Ev
  5629: 000000000017c46e   147 FUNC    WEAK   DEFAULT   11 _ZN5GiNaC9containerISt6vectorEC1Ev
```
If you know gcc name mangling by heart (and I don't blame you if you don't) then the `C1` is the full constructor while `C2` is only the base object constructor. If you use `c++filt` then that distinction is not shown (!).  

So after marking that template external in `ginac_wrap.h`, Sage still works on my lapop but fails on redhawk since the full constructor is never instantiated. I think we should just push explicit instantiation of all necessary templates into pynac, this will probably fix the bug here.

I had a look at the changes in Sage and in Pynac and both look fine (though I cannot completely ensure that some dark magic use of C++ features could still break the templating stuff).

It also compiles fine and passes long tests on a ppc system.

The only change in my branch is a typo correction.
