Attached patch allows embedding Python tuples in symbolic expressions:

```
sage: t = SR._force_tuple((1, 2, x, x+1, x+2))
sage: t
(1, 2, x, x + 1, x + 2)
sage: t.subs(x = 2*x^2)
(1, 2, 2*x^2, 2*x^2 + 1, 2*x^2 + 2)
sage: t.op[0]
1
sage: t.op[2]
x
```
 
Includes pynac 0.3.2 update for explicit template instantiatitons

Yeah, I guess it could have been expected and that it is not a completely random choice that Python does not set it by default as it might expect to load a bunch of libraries and get symbols conflicts.
Though the fact that it is set by default on Darwin does not really point in that direction...

What about linking sage/symbolic/ring.pyx/so with libpynac.so? that is modify module_list.py to achieve that.

<a id='comment:48'></a>I had a look at the changes in Sage and in Pynac and both look fine (though I cannot completely ensure that some dark magic use of C++ features could still break the templating stuff).

It also compiles fine and passes long tests on a ppc system.

The only change in my branch is a typo correction.
