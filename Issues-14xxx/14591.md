<a id='comment:7'></a>The answer cosh(*x*) is completely wrong, even in a neighbourhood of *x* = 0:

```
cosh(x) = integrate(sqrt(1 - 1/4*cosh(x)^2),x)
=> sinh(x) = sqrt(1 - 1/4*cosh(x)^2)
=> sinh(x)^2 = 1 - 1/4*cosh(x)^2
=> 0 = 3/4  (substitute x = 0)
```
According to the ask.sagemath.org link in the ticket description, the correct answer can be expressed in terms of an elliptic integral function, which I trust much more.

Yes, I just wanted to give a clear reason here why the answer couldn't possibly be right.
> So, does #13973 fix this or not?

No, it doesn't.  I have been doing some debugging of the Maxima command

```
trigsimp(integrate(sqrt(4 - cosh(x)^2),x));
```
which returns `cosh(x)` when executed after loading `abs_integrate`.  It seems that the problem arises in `ratsubst`, when substituting `1 + sinh(x)^2` for `cosh(x)^2`.  What makes it more tricky is that calling `ratsubst` directly with the same arguments gives a correct answer.  Possibly some flag is set at some intermediate point that triggers the bug.
