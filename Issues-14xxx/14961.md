I made a typo and sage crashed:

```
R.<t> = QQ{]
```
Note that there is one opening squigly bracket `{` and one closing square bracket `]`.

Here's the backtrace

```

In the meantime, the proposed workaround looks good. However, it has an unrelated change to in `sage/algebras/lie_algebras/kac_moody.py` that needs to be removed.
