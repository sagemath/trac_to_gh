I made a typo and sage crashed:

```
R.<t> = QQ{]
```
Note that there is one opening squigly bracket `{` and one closing square bracket `]`.

Here's the backtrace

The IPython devs acknowledged that this currently does not work. It sounds like they would accept a patch but don't plan on fixing this in the near future themselves. So fixing this properly will take some time.

In the meantime, the proposed workaround looks good. However, it has an unrelated change to in `sage/algebras/lie_algebras/kac_moody.py` that needs to be removed.
