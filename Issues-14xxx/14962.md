we support them, so we need to make sure they will continue to work

Script to systematically try out all optional spkgs: http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/vbraun/Sage/Testing/test_optional_packages.sh

The optional databases will be dealt with here, other packages should make separate tickets. Use the following new "upstream" tarballs:
* http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/vbraun/upstream/database_cremona_ellcurve-20121022.tar.bz2

Leave for later, don't work and no SPKG.txt:
* cunningham_tables
* database_jones_numfield
* database_kohel
* database_odlyzko_zeta
* database_sloane_oeis
* database_stein_watkins_mini.p0

Move to experimental (broken with or without git, probably for a long time):
* fricas (doesn't build with our ecl)
* fricas-aldor (dito)
* libcocoa (doesn't build with our gmp/mpir)

Delete for other reasons:
* jsmath_image_fonts (we switched to mathjax)

For right now I would say no dependency management -- any other solution at this point in time would require messing with the build system, which I don't want to do at the moment (so that we can get through this git transition).

On top of our current faux package manager I would say the best solution would be to replace (at least most of) `deps` with `<packagename>/deps`, but I'm not particularly interested in continuing the development of the current build system.

There are four tests of the following kind:

So where would we check the "newest version" now?   That's all one would need to do, or even check "presence" if the spkg placeholder txt files are no longer there.

I just don't remember why that was introduced.  #9675 doesn't make it clear, so when I open this ticket, I'll cc: the original author.  Otherwise I agree we should get rid of this.  I'll update the patch situation as well and perhaps upgrade Brian if I find time for all this- should be able to in the next couple days.

I'm setting this to positive review since clearly nobody else has the guts to review this ticket.

The `database_cremona_ellcurve-20121022.tar.bz2` tarball is already in the upstream dir, apparently.

Harald, can you delete/move to trash: `fricas`, `fricas-aldor`, `libcocoa`, and `jsmath_image_fonts`? They are (and have been for a while) useless with or without git.

<a id='comment:30'>Comment 30:</a>
My copy of database_stein_watkins_mini.p0.spkg does contain SPKG.txt:

```
jec@atkin:~/spkg/database_stein_watkins_mini.p0$ ls -l
total 12
-rwx------ 1 jec jec   49 Mar 12  2010 spkg-install
-rw------- 1 jec jec  389 Mar 13  2010 SPKG.txt
drwx------ 2 jec jec 4096 Nov  7  2005 stein-watkins-ecdb
```
so I think this one should be easy -- no compilaton, it just copies recurseively the directory to SAGE_DATA:

```
jec@atkin:~/spkg/database_stein_watkins_mini.p0$ cat spkg-install 
#!/bin/sh

cp -rf stein-watkins-ecdb $SAGE_DATA/
```

It's a large collection of elliptic curves compiled by William Stein and Mark Watkins about 10 years ago, stored in simple compressed text files.  I'll put a reference to their paper in the SPKG.txt (it is already cited properly in the docstrings).
