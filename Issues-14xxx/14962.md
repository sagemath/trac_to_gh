we support them, so we need to make sure they will continue to work

Script to systematically try out all optional spkgs: http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/vbraun/Sage/Testing/test_optional_packages.sh

The optional databases will be dealt with here, other packages should make separate tickets. Use the following new "upstream" tarballs:
* http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/vbraun/upstream/database_cremona_ellcurve-20121022.tar.bz2

Leave for later, don't work and no SPKG.txt:
* cunningham_tables
* database_jones_numfield
* database_kohel
* database_odlyzko_zeta
* database_sloane_oeis
* database_stein_watkins_mini.p0

Move to experimental (broken with or without git, probably for a long time):
* fricas (doesn't build with our ecl)
* fricas-aldor (dito)
* libcocoa (doesn't build with our gmp/mpir)

Delete for other reasons:
* jsmath_image_fonts (we switched to mathjax)

For right now I would say no dependency management -- any other solution at this point in time would require messing with the build system, which I don't want to do at the moment (so that we can get through this git transition).

On top of our current faux package manager I would say the best solution would be to replace (at least most of) `deps` with `<packagename>/deps`, but I'm not particularly interested in continuing the development of the current build system.

I'm setting this to positive review since clearly nobody else has the guts to review this ticket.

The `database_cremona_ellcurve-20121022.tar.bz2` tarball is already in the upstream dir, apparently.

Harald, can you delete/move to trash: `fricas`, `fricas-aldor`, `libcocoa`, and `jsmath_image_fonts`? They are (and have been for a while) useless with or without git.

<div id="comment:30" align="right">comment:30</div>

My copy of database_stein_watkins_mini.p0.spkg does contain SPKG.txt:

```
jec@atkin:~/spkg/database_stein_watkins_mini.p0$ ls -l
total 12
-rwx------ 1 jec jec   49 Mar 12  2010 spkg-install
-rw------- 1 jec jec  389 Mar 13  2010 SPKG.txt
drwx------ 2 jec jec 4096 Nov  7  2005 stein-watkins-ecdb
```
so I think this one should be easy -- no compilaton, it just copies recurseively the directory to SAGE_DATA:

```
jec@atkin:~/spkg/database_stein_watkins_mini.p0$ cat spkg-install 
#!/bin/sh

cp -rf stein-watkins-ecdb $SAGE_DATA/
```

It's a large collection of elliptic curves compiled by William Stein and Mark Watkins about 10 years ago, stored in simple compressed text files.  I'll put a reference to their paper in the SPKG.txt (it is already cited properly in the docstrings).
