Using the existing groups catalog framework, users are given the capability to
create "named" groups as finite presentations. The goal of this addition to Sage is to make the concepts of free groups and group presentations more accessible to the typical undergrad, allowing them to work with standard groups introduced in an introductory level abstract algebra course. 

```
sage: groups.presentation.Cyclic(17)
Finitely presented group < a | a^17 >
sage: groups.presentation.Dihedral(8)
Finitely presented group < a, b | a^8, b^2, a*b*a*b >
sage: groups.presentation.DiCyclic(5)
Finitely presented group < a, b | a^10, b^2*a^-5, b^-1*a*b*a >
sage: groups.presentation.KleinFour()
Finitely presented group < a, b | a^2, b^2, a^-1*b^-1*a*b >
```

More groups are to be implemented soon. Feedback/suggestions on implementation
details are highly encouraged.

<a id='comment:5'></a>The printing of free group elements changed in the latest GAP update, this leads to doctest failures of the kind

```
Failed example:
    D = groups.presentation.Dihedral(7); D
Expected:
    Finitely presented group < a, b | a^7, b^2, a*b*a*b >
Got:
    Finitely presented group < a, b | a^7, b^2, (a*b)^2 >
```
The patch should be rebased to the latest sage beta (5.11.beta3 as of today)

Minor nitpick: Don't end docstrings with a blank line. It just wastes vertical space needlessly. The `"""` end marker is enough visual cue that the docstring is finished.

Hey,

Here's a small review patch which fixes a few typos and formatting in the documentation, and if you're happy with my changes, we can set this (back to) positive review.
