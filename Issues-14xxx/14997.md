1. Minor change in `LinearCode.shortened()`, as mentioned in the title. The following two lines are not required since we already get a `LinearCode` instance from the `dual_code()` method.

```
         Cdpd = Cdp.dual_code()
-        Gs = Cdpd.gen_mat()
-        return LinearCode(Gs)
```
2. `LinearCode.punctured()` goes through the row space and then generates the basis vectors. This is very inefficient. Simply echelonizing the matrix speeds up the computations 4x for small generator matrices and over 18x for larger generator matrices.

```
def puncture(C, coords):
    G = C.gen_mat()
    G = G.matrix_from_columns([i for i in range(G.ncols()) if i not in coords])
    r = G.rank()
    if r < G.nrows():
        G.echelonize()
        G = G[:r]
    return LinearCode(G)

C = BinaryReedMullerCode(1, 3); C
Linear code of length 8, dimension 4 over Finite Field of size 2

timeit('C.punctured([0, 1, 2, 3, 7])'); C.punctured([0, 1, 2, 3, 7])
125 loops, best of 3: 946 µs per loop
Linear code of length 3, dimension 3 over Finite Field of size 2

timeit('puncture(C, [0, 1, 2, 3, 7])'); puncture(C, [0, 1, 2, 3, 7])
625 loops, best of 3: 221 µs per loop
Linear code of length 3, dimension 3 over Finite Field of size 2

C = BinaryReedMullerCode(3, 9); C
Linear code of length 512, dimension 130 over Finite Field of size 2

timeit('C.punctured([0, 1, 2, 3, 7])'); C.punctured([0, 1, 2, 3, 7])
5 loops, best of 3: 164 ms per loop
Linear code of length 507, dimension 130 over Finite Field of size 2

timeit('puncture(C, [0, 1, 2, 3, 7])'); puncture(C, [0, 1, 2, 3, 7])
25 loops, best of 3: 8.27 ms per loop
Linear code of length 507, dimension 130 over Finite Field of size 2
