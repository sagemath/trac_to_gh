Not saying this is an actual issue, since it seems to depend on bad user input.

Since I don't know how to reliably do function declarations in the console, I'm making a py file and then importing it:

PY file:

```
def diag_func(p):
      if len(p)==0: return 1
      else: return p[0]
```

Console:

```
sage: attach ../diagbug.py #file quoted above
sage: X = CombinatorialFreeModule(ZZ, Partitions(), prefix='x'); x = X.basis();
sage: Y = CombinatorialFreeModule(ZZ, Partitions(), prefix='y'); y = Y.basis()
sage: xty = X.module_morphism(diagonal=diag_func, codomain=Y)
sage: ytx = ~xty                
sage: ytx(y[Partition([3,2,1])])
1/3*x[[3, 2, 1]]
sage: ytx(y[Partition([3,2,1])]).parent()
Free module generated by Partitions over Integer Ring
```

Since I'm working over ZZ, I'd have expected the "ytx(y[Partition([3,2,1])])" to throw an error, but definitely I'd have expected the parent to not be defined over ZZ.
