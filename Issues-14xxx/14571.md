Does not seem to be shipped in Ubuntu's TeXLive packages... surely because using the TeXLive package manager on top of Ubuntu's one is not supported and will never be and I don't really want to use my own TeXLive install rather than what Ubuntu/Debian provides.
I can still do "apt-file search utf8x.def", but my Debian install already uses some preview of TeXLive 2013, and it still provides utf8x.def in the texlive-latex-extra package which from its description might indeed not be from vanilla TeXLive.

OK; I also checked that this patch works with `TeXLive 2012` distribution (with Russian support installed, naturally). On the other hand, it also has

```
-rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel  8036 Apr 21  2012 texmf-dist/tex/latex/ucs/utf8x.def
```

So " that doesn't even ship with `TeXLive-2012`" is not correct.

I was asking whether we can replace the current patch with one-char patch, removing `x` from `utf8x` in the line

```
latex_elements['inputenc'] = '\\usepackage[utf8x]{inputenc}'
```

so it seems that the answer is "no". I just stumbled upon this tex.stackexchange [discussion](http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/13067/utf8x-vs-utf8-inputenc). Tricky stuff... One comment is actually saying that `utf8x` is being maintained again...

By itself this is not necessarily a problem, there are certainly Sage packages which are no longer developed. Of course it's better to use newer packages, but my impression is that there is no obvious replacement for `utf8x`, so maybe we should just leave it...

But I don't know much about `TeX`, I'm just guessing based on the discussion above.

<a id='comment:20'></a>I don't get it. There **is** an obvious replacement, utf8. Its a base LaTeX package and not squirreled away in the ancient ucs package. Every LaTeX developer seems to agree that its better to use utf8 than utf8x. A patch to switch is right here. Why would one even consider sticking with the old stuff?

the fact that `biblatex` (a `contrib` package we don't use, AFAIK) is not compatible with `ucs` (another `contrib` package) does not mean we should rush to change what we have, I think. Note that `biblatex` is incompatible with lots of other packages, cf. [Sect 1.5.4](http://www.math.upenn.edu/tex_docs/latex/biblatex/biblatex.pdf). 

Do you know any other packages incompatible with `ucs`? I don't.
