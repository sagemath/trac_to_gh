That's surely not the best solution, but could do the trick.
Is it still shipped with TeXLive?
By the way, how do you figure out what is shipped within a given TeXLive distribution?

Does not seem to be shipped in Ubuntu's TeXLive packages... surely because using the TeXLive package manager on top of Ubuntu's one is not supported and will never be and I don't really want to use my own TeXLive install rather than what Ubuntu/Debian provides.
I can still do "apt-file search utf8x.def", but my Debian install already uses some preview of TeXLive 2013, and it still provides utf8x.def in the texlive-latex-extra package which from its description might indeed not be from vanilla TeXLive.

OK; I also checked that this patch works with `TeXLive 2012` distribution (with Russian support installed, naturally). On the other hand, it also has

```
-rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel  8036 Apr 21  2012 texmf-dist/tex/latex/ucs/utf8x.def
```

So " that doesn't even ship with `TeXLive-2012`" is not correct.

I was asking whether we can replace the current patch with one-char patch, removing `x` from `utf8x` in the line

```
latex_elements['inputenc'] = '\\usepackage[utf8x]{inputenc}'
```

so it seems that the answer is "no". I just stumbled upon this tex.stackexchange [discussion](http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/13067/utf8x-vs-utf8-inputenc). Tricky stuff... One comment is actually saying that `utf8x` is being maintained again...

By itself this is not necessarily a problem, there are certainly Sage packages which are no longer developed. Of course it's better to use newer packages, but my impression is that there is no obvious replacement for `utf8x`, so maybe we should just leave it...

But I don't know much about `TeX`, I'm just guessing based on the discussion above.

I agree with Volker, let's get away from utf8x if possible, it has been unmaintained for a long time and is not in the basic texlive distribution (at least on Debian its in a "-extra" archive).

What may be misleading in the patch is that a \usepackage{utf8x} is removed but no \usepackage{utf8} appears but I guess the utf8 is imported somewhere else at some point.

the fact that `biblatex` (a `contrib` package we don't use, AFAIK) is not compatible with `ucs` (another `contrib` package) does not mean we should rush to change what we have, I think. Note that `biblatex` is incompatible with lots of other packages, cf. [Sect 1.5.4](http://www.math.upenn.edu/tex_docs/latex/biblatex/biblatex.pdf). 

Do you know any other packages incompatible with `ucs`? I don't.
