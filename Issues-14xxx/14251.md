Hello,

* I have read somewhere that imports should now be at module level, but I'm not sure...
* You should test that n>=0
* You should check that integers is an iterable (list, set, dict?) with valid numbers (can we have negative numbers? what if a number is larger than n? what to do with 0?)

David.

Yo !

> * I have read somewhere that imports should now be at module level, but I'm not sure...


Cython imports should be, but that's all. Anyway you cannot have all imports at module level, it wouldn't work. You need to use graph generators in digraph.py, and you need to use digraphs indigraph_generators too. 

> * You should test that n>=0


Why not... 

> * You should check that integers is an iterable (list, set, dict?) with valid numbers (can we have negative numbers? what if a number is larger than n? what to do with 0?)


If it is not iterable the "for j in integers" would fail with a clear message :

```
sage: digraphs.Circulant(4,5)      
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

    410 
    411         return G

TypeError: 'sage.rings.integer.Integer' object is not iterable
sage:
```
I will add some checks.. And I really hate when a 3-lines code takes 10 lines to check bad input... Users should learn to deal with them too.

That's much better ;-)

I have plenty of warnings when building the documentation (with 5.8.beta4), but this has nothing to do with your patch (a sample bellow).


For me the patch is good to go.
