Oh, I like this feature!!!

Could we add a quick test to it? Maybe something like (not tested):

```
    sage: sage.misc.lazy_import.startup_guard = True
    sage: lazy_import(something)
    sage: something
    warning ...
    sage: sage.misc.lazy_import.finish_startup()
    sage: sage.misc.lazy_import.finish_startup()

Once done, and assuming that the patch bot goes green, you can put a positive review on my behalf!

<a id='comment:6'></a>
Ok, I investigated that, and the issue is as follow:

- On Sage's startup, one create NN which is a facade set (in Sets().Facade())
- Sets lazily imports FacadeSets to avoid an import loop: FacadeSets uses Sets,
  but we want a reference Sets.Facades -> FacadeSets

  Note that with the upcoming functorial construction that will be a
  very common idiom even for low level categories like
  Magma().Commutative() that we certainly will load on startup.

So the problem we are having is that LazyImport serves to purposes:
- avoiding to load stuff on Sage's startup
- break import loops.

Granted, it's not soo nice to setup a safety guard and immediately
provide a way to work around it ... but what about adding an explicit
option so that one could explicitly disable the warning when we know
that the lazy import is really just about breaking an import loop?

      LazyImport('sage.categories.facade_sets', 'FacadeSets', dont_warn_on_startup=True)

or

      LazyImport('sage.categories.facade_sets', 'FacadeSets', can_be_evaluated_on_startup=True)

Cheers,
                       Nicolas

Hi Volker!

Thanks for the updated patch! I am almost ready to put it a positive
review. Just one thing about the import of NN in
sage/combinat/integer_vectors_mod_permgroup.py: I think one should
repeat the lazy import there rather than importing from `all`
where it's lazy imported. Otherwise, lazy import misses information to
complete its job.

Quick example: in a file all.py, put:

```
from sage.misc.lazy_import import lazy_import
lazy_import('sage.rings.semirings.non_negative_integer_semiring', 'NN')
```

and in blah.py:

```
import all
from all import NN

print type(all.NN)
print type(NN)

NN(1)

print type(all.NN)
print type(NN)
```

With those we get:

```
sage: import blah
<type 'sage.misc.lazy_import.LazyImport'>
<type 'sage.misc.lazy_import.LazyImport'>
<class 'sage.rings.semirings.non_negative_integer_semiring.NonNegativeIntegerSemiring_with_category'>
<type 'sage.misc.lazy_import.LazyImport'>
```

Interpretation: upon using NN, lazy import substitutes the lazy import
object by NN in the module where it was lazy imported. But not in
blah! And that won't happen either if use explicitly the NN from blah:

```
sage: blah.NN
Non negative integer semiring
sage: type(blah.NN)
sage.misc.lazy_import.LazyImport
sage: blah.NN(1)
1
sage: type(blah.NN)
sage.misc.lazy_import.LazyImport
```

Btw, you may want to write the output description in is_during_startup
as `OUTPUT: a boolean`, but that's more a question of taste.

Cheers,

I agree, this certainly is a missing feature. But I would not be surprised if figuring out all modules where it's imported could get tricky. I don't remember seeing any hook for an object to take some action when it's imported somewhere.

Anyway, for the problem at hand, let's just do the lazy import explicitly.

+1, I see this as a "best effort" kind of a thing anyways.

In terms of efficiency, I think it might make sense to try to attempt a lookup before iterating over the (potentially very large) dict.

This is intentionally creating a partially-constructed tuple and using the fact that  get_referrers() can refer to it. "partially-constructed" dicts are safe, if we ever run across one. 

> I'd think that looming segfaults are a high price to pay for the convenience of writing `NN=module.NN` rather than `lazy_import("other_module",NN)`.


The convenience is in being abel to write "from sage.foo.all import X" and not worry about whether X was (possibly transitively) lazily imported. I think that's a big win.

It's intentionally exposing one of the dangers. That's the point of an example. We need to convince ourselves that this will never happen with a dictionary. And then probably only do replacements when `type(ref) is dict` rather than `isinstance(ref,dict)` and document that lazy imports only work in conventional `globals()` (one never knows what comes of subclassing).\n> \"partially-constructed\" dicts are safe, if we ever run across one. \n\nDo you have a reference that they are? Are you sure it's just partially constructed ones? Note that as soon as a value in a `dict` we iterate over is `NULL`, we're done for, since the value fetch will cause an `INCREF` on that `NULL` pointer. Lazy imports can be triggered to resolve at funny times, quite possibly when a class definition is being processed.

Agreed. It's intentionally exposing one of the dangers. That's the point of an example. We need to convince ourselves that this will never happen with a dictionary. And then probably only do replacements when `type(ref) is dict` rather than `isinstance(ref,dict)` and document that lazy imports only work in conventional `globals()` (one never knows what comes of subclassing).
> "partially-constructed" dicts are safe, if we ever run across one. 

Do you have a reference that they are? Are you sure it's just partially constructed ones? Note that as soon as a value in a `dict` we iterate over is `NULL`, we're done for, since the value fetch will cause an `INCREF` on that `NULL` pointer. Lazy imports can be triggered to resolve at funny times, quite possibly when a class definition is being processed. At that time, the `dict` of that class has not been given out yet, so it would be under construction and I don't immediately see why it should abstain from putting a key with a null value in there already.

For infrastructure like this I'd be rather reluctant to just rely on "it seems to work in all the cases we've tried", especially because it would be nice if this code were robust in the face of python upgrades.

(Concerning cost: the call basically requires a full `GC` sweep, so it's very expensive. If you can make sure that there are very few `lazyimport` instances then the cost may be acceptable, because the resolution of any single such instance will trigger a GC)

Note that in sage, a GC can trigger the callback of a `WeakValueDict`, which can trigger an `__eq__` on an arbitrary object, which can possibly trigger the resolution of a `LazyImport`. Are you still sure `dict`s are safe to examine under those conditions?

Totally fine with that.

There's neither an API nor motivation to insert key with a NULL value.

Fair enough. I don't think this is a huge problem, it's basically deferred startup. It could be interesting to have the ability to force all lazy imports to be resolved (perhaps even in the background...) but that could be trickier.

I don't see why not. For instance, `dicts` follow the GC protocol of removing themselves from the loop when they're being destructed.
