Whittaker functions can be easily implemented similarly; the reason I didn't include them in this patch is because the Maxima conversion is a bit more complicated.

No. Confluent hypergeometric functions are a specific type of hypergeometric function, which are solutions to [Kummer's differential equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confluent_hypergeometric_function#Kummer.27s_equation).

Thanks for offering to review, Kannappan! I'm new to the Git workflow, but I'll try to create the branch as soon as possible.

Seems I found a Maxima interface problem with `hypergeometric`:

```
sage: hypergeometric_M(1,b,x).simplify_hypergeometric()
(b - 1)*x^(-b + 1)*e^x*gamma_greek(b - 1, x)
sage: hypergeometric([1],[b],x).simplify_hypergeometric()
(b - 1)*x^(-b + 1)*e^x*gamma_greek(b - 1, x)
```
Of course that should be `gamma`.

I'm not so sure: according to the maxima documentation:

- gamma - gamma function (complete)
- gamma_greek - lower incomplete gamma function
- gamma_incomplete - upper incomplete gamma function

in sage, gamma(a,z) is documented to be the upper gamma function, which gets translated appropriately. We might not have a lower gamma function yet.

Good catch.

Maybe we can make it by gamma - upper incomplete?

Ralf, I'm trying to merge existing commits to a branch that already includes #16697 but I'm getting errors:


```
    STDOUT: Auto-merging src/sage/symbolic/expression_conversions.py
    STDOUT: CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in src/sage/symbolic/expression_conversions.py
    STDOUT: Auto-merging src/sage/symbolic/expression.pyx
    STDOUT: Auto-merging src/sage/functions/special.py
    STDOUT: Auto-merging src/sage/functions/other.py
    STDOUT: CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in src/sage/functions/other.py
    STDOUT: Auto-merging src/sage/functions/hypergeometric.py
    STDOUT: Auto-merging src/sage/functions/all.py
    STDOUT: CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in src/sage/functions/all.py
    STDOUT: Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
```

Am I doing something wrong or do these commits need updating after all this time? Would like to get this one reviewed.

I assumed I needed keep track of changes from#16697 manually, but clearly Trac does that automatically.

Running a `doctest` on symbolic/expression_conversions.py gives an error:

```
ValueError: line 93 of the docstring for sage.symbolic.expression_conversions.InterfaceInit.derivative has inconsistent leading whitespace: '======='
```

This is the same file that had a merge conflict.
