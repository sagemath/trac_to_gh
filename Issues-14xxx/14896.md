Whittaker functions can be easily implemented similarly; the reason I didn't include them in this patch is because the Maxima conversion is a bit more complicated.

I'm not so sure: according to the maxima documentation:

- gamma - gamma function (complete)
- gamma_greek - lower incomplete gamma function
- gamma_incomplete - upper incomplete gamma function

in sage, gamma(a,z) is documented to be the upper gamma function, which gets translated appropriately. We might not have a lower gamma function yet.

Good catch.

Maybe we can make it by gamma - upper incomplete?

(e.g., for numerical work: do you really want to evaluate gamma_lower(a,z) as gamma(z)-gamma_upper(a,z) ?)

Without strong indications in either direction, I'd be hesitant to make a choice and rather follow the lead of our main underlying engine: implement gamma_lower.
