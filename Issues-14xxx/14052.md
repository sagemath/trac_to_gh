What my patch do not do for now is to deprecate this `TransitiveIdealGraded` class. This could be done in another ticket (in #6637 perhaps?). Anyhow, since I believe we should deprecate that class, I also think we should avoid to add new features to it.

Salut Sébastien!

Thanks much for working on the refactoring of backtrack.py; we need it!

That being said, TransitiveIdeal itself is going to get deprecated in
the process since we want a consistent naming scheme around
RecursiveSet (that's the name we converged to on the mailing list,
right?). So either way, adding an argument to TransitiveIdealGraded or
adding a breath first search iterator in TransitiveIdeal is also
adding features to to-be-deprecated classes.

Also, in the long run, we will want the following features:

(1) RecursiveSet(generator, operators, max_depth=n)

    A parent modeling the top piece of S (all elements of depth <= n)

(2) RecursiveSet(generator, operators, predicate=...)

    A parent modeling an upper ideal of S defined by a predicate

(3) RecursiveSet(generator, operators, enumeration="depth")

    A parent modeling S, with depth first enumeration

(4) RecursiveSet(generator, operators, enumeration="breath")

    A parent modeling S, with breath first enumeration

(5) ...

and not only have iterators for the above. And it's helpful for Anne
to have the feature right away for (1).

(note: the exact syntax is another topic of discussion; I don't mean
that it should be exactly as above)

So altogether, given that Anne's ticket is ready to go and is
important for later development here during the semester, do you mind
letting it go as is and rebasing your patch on top of it? We can add a
quick note saying that this feature will be refactored (as all the
rest).

Cheers,
				Nicolas

Hey Sebastien,

I agree with you that there needs to be a more comprehensive class rather than two smaller classes, and I thank you for working on refactoring the code. However I believe that the depth should be an attribute of the class rather than an optional argument for an iterator method because these classes model a (sub)set obtained by (recursive) iteration.

If you want a note that `backtrack.py` will be refactored, I would be fine with that. However, I would prefer `braktrack.py` to be refactored after this patch and so I am setting this back to positive review.
