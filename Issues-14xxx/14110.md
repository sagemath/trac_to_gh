Currently (sage 5.6), Sage generates the posets on n elements by generating all digraphs with n vertices and checking which of those give posets. A paper of Brinkmann and McKay gives an algorithm for generating posets which they used to generate posets up to 16. Sage uses a related algorithm of McKay to generate the digraphs.

I attached the code I got from Brinkmann. It contains a slightly modified version of nauty; hence copyright is free "- - with the exception of sale for profit or application with nontrivial military significance." So it must be made to an optional package.

It compiles with `gcc -O4 -o /tmp/posets posets.c nauty_poset.c nautil_poset.c`. Code to use it in non-optimal way seems to be quite easy:

```
import subprocess
def generate_posets(n):  # Add check for the argument etc.
    cmd=["/tmp/posets"]
    args=[str(n), 'o']
    sp=subprocess.Popen(cmd+args, shell=False, stdin=subprocess.PIPE, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE, close_fds=True)
    reader=iter(lambda: sp.stdout.read(2+2*n), '')
    while True:
        bin=reader.next()[2:]
        L=[]
        for i in range(0, n):
            t=ord(bin[1+2*i])*256+ord(bin[2*i])
            for j in range(0, n):
                if (t << j) & 32768:
                    L.append((i,j))
        G=DiGraph()
        G.add_vertices(range(0, n))
        G.add_edges(L)
        yield Poset(G, facade = True)
```

There is much to make it even faster: for example to check linear extension and use FinitePoset directly, or even add to static sparse graphs an initializer that takes plain list as argument.

First test of packing files to .spkg is now attached to this ticket. Needs to add license information etc. Also I will do a test file and one line test script to check output.

However, now somebody could test if also 32-bit Linux and Mac OS X are able to install this.

Line `cmd=["/tmp/posets"]` must be changed to `cmd=[sage.env.SAGE_LOCAL+"/bin/genposets"]`.

True, but I think that it does not contain a code for generating posets.

Or do you mean to append this poset generation to nauty package?

Indeed. Do you think is is possible to rely on the existing nauty package for the nauty-part, and only add the poset-specific stuff ? Maybe it does not worth the work if the nauty part is too modified and is a small part of posetgen.

Also, do you think upstream could officially distribute its poset code (within nauty or in a separate tarball) ?


> Or do you mean to append this poset generation to nauty package?


Definitely not, i think we should keep upstream tarball's integrity as much as possible (in particular moving nauty to the new spkg layout could be nice).

`nauty_poset.c` starts with "modified by Gunnar Brinkmann for use with posets." Hence I guess it is inpractical to merge.

Whole code for poset generation is about 7000 lines, so there is not much space to save.

Upstream will be that trac ticket. And each modified version (e.g. to compile on particular architecture) will become the next upstream without clear distinction.

Having a well identified upstream source whose checksum can be checked by anyone is preferable. If i come with a modified code that is attributed to someone else, there is no way to check my modifications (disclaimer: i am not insinuating anything with respect to the current package !).

This works for me (in the sense : i can compile and run the program, i did not check the results) on Linux 32 bits (Debian wheezy).

However, i can not run the tests because of the `#!/usr/bin/sh` at the beginning of `spkg-check` (note that you used `#!/bin/sh` in `spkg-install`). Perhaps could you use `#!/usr/bin/env sh` instead.

Also, it is unlikely this test will work since `spkg-install` creates a binary named `posetgen` and `spkg-check` calls a binary named `genposets`.

Any idea what "It applies to all of the nauty files, but for incorporation into Sage you can ignore it" actually means? The problem is that it really needs to be GPL v3 to be standard in Sage. And once it's GPL, it's GPL for everybody, not just for Sage.

The "sale for profit" isn't an unlikely scenario given William Stein's plans to make money from SMC.

Final remark: it's allowed by the GPL to run Sage and nauty as separate programs (using Python's `subprocess` for example), but not to link nauty as a library.
