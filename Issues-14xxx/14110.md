Currently (sage 5.6), Sage generates the posets on n elements by generating all digraphs with n vertices and checking which of those give posets. A paper of Brinkmann and McKay gives an algorithm for generating posets which they used to generate posets up to 16. Sage uses a related algorithm of McKay to generate the digraphs.

Brinkmann was kind and send me C-code that he used. However, on sage-devel list Nathann Cohen said that at least Nauty is not available as GPL and can not be directly added to Sage. As an optional package it should be fine.

To glue C code to Sage or to read the paper and make same code in [c|p]ython?

Attachment: **[poset_package.zip](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket14110/poset_package.zip)**

I attached the code I got from Brinkmann. It contains a slightly modified version of nauty; hence copyright is free "- - with the exception of sale for profit or application with nontrivial military significance." So it must be made to an optional package.

It compiles with `gcc -O4 -o /tmp/posets posets.c nauty_poset.c nautil_poset.c`. Code to use it in non-optimal way seems to be quite easy:

```
import subprocess
def generate_posets(n):  # Add check for the argument etc.
    cmd=["/tmp/posets"]
    args=[str(n), 'o']
    sp=subprocess.Popen(cmd+args, shell=False, stdin=subprocess.PIPE, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE, close_fds=True)
    reader=iter(lambda: sp.stdout.read(2+2*n), '')
    while True:
        bin=reader.next()[2:]
        L=[]
        for i in range(0, n):
            t=ord(bin[1+2*i])*256+ord(bin[2*i])
            for j in range(0, n):
                if (t << j) & 32768:
                    L.append((i,j))
        G=DiGraph()
        G.add_vertices(range(0, n))
        G.add_edges(L)
        yield Poset(G, facade = True)
```

There is much to make it even faster: for example to check linear extension and use FinitePoset directly, or even add to static sparse graphs an initializer that takes plain list as argument.

First test of packing files to .spkg is now attached to this ticket. Needs to add license information etc. Also I will do a test file and one line test script to check output.

However, now somebody could test if also 32-bit Linux and Mac OS X are able to install this.

Line `cmd=["/tmp/posets"]` must be changed to `cmd=[sage.env.SAGE_LOCAL+"/bin/genposets"]`.

What should be the interface for this? If the package is installed, should `Posets(n)` use it automatically? What if we later got algorithm for generating for example all lattices or all modular lattices? Maybe this could be something like

`Posets.PosetGenerator(n, properties='all')`

And then later we could have something like `properties='lattice'`. Same arguments could be available also on `Posets.RandomPoset()`. Plain `Posets(n)` could be modified to use this, if the package is available.

Indeed. Do you think is is possible to rely on the existing nauty package for the nauty-part, and only add the poset-specific stuff ? Maybe it does not worth the work if the nauty part is too modified and is a small part of posetgen.

Also, do you think upstream could officially distribute its poset code (within nauty or in a separate tarball) ?

Definitely not, i think we should keep upstream tarball's integrity as much as possible (in particular moving nauty to the new spkg layout could be nice).

`nauty_poset.c` starts with "modified by Gunnar Brinkmann for use with posets." Hence I guess it is inpractical to merge.

Whole code for poset generation is about 7000 lines, so there is not much space to save.

I haven't asked that. But if they are not going to maintain poset code, then what difference would that do?

Upstream will be that trac ticket. And each modified version (e.g. to compile on particular architecture) will become the next upstream without clear distinction.

This works for me (in the sense : i can compile and run the program, i did not check the results) on Linux 32 bits (Debian wheezy).

However, i can not run the tests because of the `#!/usr/bin/sh` at the beginning of `spkg-check` (note that you used `#!/bin/sh` in `spkg-install`). Perhaps could you use `#!/usr/bin/env sh` instead.

Also, it is unlikely this test will work since `spkg-install` creates a binary named `posetgen` and `spkg-check` calls a binary named `genposets`.

Yes.

And what is more: Sage is free, so I can take any part of Sage and use it as a part of some other (free) program that is used to prepare against another shelling of Mainila. Free software can be splitted, not only combined.

I am quite sure that he did not think about that. Not in a way or another.
