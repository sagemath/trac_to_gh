Afterwards create an optional GCC 4.8.0 spkg ... :-)

[Needs a C++ compiler to bootstrap, I know, but nvm.]

Haven't looked or tried whether that's still an issue, but at some point in the past the GCC spkg failed to build when encountering parts of CLooG and/or PPL.  (We may add `--without-*` and/or `--disable-lto`.)

You can always do

```
./sage -i spkg/standard/gcc-4.7.2.p1.spkg
```
or

```
./sage -i http://www.sagemath.org/packages/optional/gcc-4.6.3.spkg
```
No need to differentiate then.

Or also

```
./sage -i gcc-4.6.3.spkg
```

This doesn't actually build on OS X 10.4 PPC (as reported on sage-devel). But it seems that the problem lies with libitm, which is a non-critical part of GCC.

(Move the whole Sage installation and) build the GCC spkg (in parallel) below `/tmp` (which on Skynet is always on local media I think)?

I tried that, but it failed with "no space left on device". There are close to 40000 files and/or directories in /tmp on iras, most or all of which should be cleaned out...

OMG, I see...

I deleted my own left-overs, but probably the buildbot, Volker and Jeroen should do so as well...

(FWIW, I reported Sage still leaving a lot of temporary crap a couple of times on sage-devel.)
