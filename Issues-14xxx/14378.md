You can always do

```
./sage -i spkg/standard/gcc-4.7.2.p1.spkg
```
or

```
./sage -i http://www.sagemath.org/packages/optional/gcc-4.6.3.spkg
```
No need to differentiate then.

Or also

```
./sage -i gcc-4.6.3.spkg
```

Could you please try a serial build (no MAKE -jN) and post the log file of that if it fails.

Removing just the `gcc`, `g++` and `gfortran` executables should be sufficient to force the use of the system gcc to build GCC.

A serial build of 4.7.2 succeeded. Should the spkg force that on ia64 machines?

Without having looked at the log:  Are you sure this is related to the architecture (and not just caused by the usual clock skew on Skynet)?

(Move the whole Sage installation and) build the GCC spkg (in parallel) below `/tmp` (which on Skynet is always on local media I think)?

I tried that, but it failed with "no space left on device". There are close to 40000 files and/or directories in /tmp on iras, most or all of which should be cleaned out...

OMG, I see...

I deleted my own left-overs, but probably the buildbot, Volker and Jeroen should do so as well...
