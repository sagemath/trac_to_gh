Afterwards create an optional GCC 4.8.0 spkg ... :-)

[Needs a C++ compiler to bootstrap, I know, but nvm.]

Haven't looked or tried whether that's still an issue, but at some point in the past the GCC spkg failed to build when encountering parts of CLooG and/or PPL.  (We may add `--without-*` and/or `--disable-lto`.)

Is there a way to disambiguate between standard and optional spkg when running `sage -f <package>`?

You can always do

```
./sage -i spkg/standard/gcc-4.7.2.p1.spkg
```
or

```
./sage -i http://www.sagemath.org/packages/optional/gcc-4.6.3.spkg
```
No need to differentiate then.

Or also

```
./sage -i gcc-4.6.3.spkg
```

Could you please try a serial build (no MAKE -jN) and post the log file of that if it fails.

Removing just the `gcc`, `g++` and `gfortran` executables should be sufficient to force the use of the system gcc to build GCC.

(Move the whole Sage installation and) build the GCC spkg (in parallel) below `/tmp` (which on Skynet is always on local media I think)?

OMG, I see...

I deleted my own left-overs, but probably the buildbot, Volker and Jeroen should do so as well...

(FWIW, I reported Sage still leaving a lot of temporary crap a couple of times on sage-devel.)
