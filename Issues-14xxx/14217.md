This patch implements most of the initial dynamics functionality problems proposed at the 2012 ICERM semester in Complex and Arithmetic dynamics. There are two more patches (not yet open) that follow this one that will complete this functionality.

Building on #13130

* finishes dividing affine/projective points/polynomial morphisms into ring/field/finite_field classes.
* implements the following functions

Affine_space:

* dimension : returns the dimension of the space
* change_ring: changes the base ring of the space

Affine_polynomial_morphism

* homogenize: using the embedding An into Pn
* dynatomic_polynomial: related to preperoidic points, see function description for details
* nth_iterate: determine the nth iterate of the point
* nth_iterate_map: determine nth iterate of the map
* orbit: determine a list of points in the orbit of P by f

for finite fields

* cyclegraph: the Digraph of orbits over the finite field

Affine point morphism: finite fields

* `_hash_` : hash value of the point
* orbit_structure: determine the period and preperiod of P by f

Projective space:

* change_ring: change the base ring of the projective space
* base_ring: return the base_ring of the projective space
* coordinate_ring: return the coordinate ring of the projective space

Projective_polynomial:

* change_ring: change the base ring of the morphism
* base_ring: return the base_ring of the morphism
* dynatomic_polynomial: related to preperoidic points, see function description for details
* nth_iterate: determine the nth iterate of the point
* nth_iterate_map: determine the map
* orbit: determine a list of points in the orbit of P by f
* degree: return the degree of the morphism
* dehomogenize: dehomogenize to the appropriate affine space
* is_morphism: determine the coordinate functions of f have any common zeros
* resultant: for maps on P1, determines the resultant of f[0],f[1]
* primes_of_bad_reduction: determines primes of bad reduction
* conjugate: determine the conjugate morphism by the given matrix

for finite fields

* orbit_structure: determine the period and preperiod of P by f
* cyclegraph: the Digraph of orbits over the finite field

projective point morphism

* dehomogenize: dehomogenize the point to the appropriate affine space
* normalize_coordinates: clear any common factors of coordinates
* clear_denominators: scale so that each coordinate is in the ring (of the base_ring)

for finite fields

* _hash_: determine the hash value of a point

Functions that take both maps and points as input are callable in member functions of either class, but duplicated in the lists above

Restructured the schemes directories to have an affine and a projective directory. Moved the appropriate code into those directories from `generic.morphism.py, generic.affine_space.py, generic.projective_space.py, generic.homset.py, generic.rational_point.py`. The morphism code was also divided into separate files for points and maps. This required changes to the documentation structure as well.

All tests passed.

One file didn't have 100% coverage (see below).  I will work on testing functionality soon.

In my opinion, the INPUT whith None are not very useful and should be removed.

There is also at least one INPUT: Npne.

Another typo : Every point**s** is preperiodic

There should be only one : after ALGORITHM

<a id='comment:8'>Comment 8:</a>
Found some typos:

* homoenize
* coordiante (several times)
* coordiantes (several times)
* generatred
* dehomgenize

For arxiv references, you may use the syntax <code>:arxiv:\`1210.6246\`</code>

You should write 

```
.. TODO::
```

One suggestion of shorter (equivalent) code for the hash function of points over finite fields

```
p = self.codomain().base_ring().order() 
N = self.codomain().ambient_space().dimension_relative() 
return sum(hash(self[i])*p**i for i in range(N+1))
```

I suggest (but this is optional) to use the Python3 syntax for the raise statements:

```
raise ValueError("can not dehomogenize at 0 coordinate")
```

 Functions that take both maps and points as input are callable in member functions of either class, but duplicated in the lists above
 
+Restructured the schemes directories to have an affine and a projective directory. Moved the appropriate code into those directories from `generic.morphism.py, generic.affine_space.py, generic.projective_space.py, generic.homset.py, generic.rational_point.py`. The morphism code was also divided into separate files for points and maps. This required changes to the documentation structure as well.

It passed the long test. Other than that I found two functionality issues and a documentation issue.

The documentation issue: There should be examples for dynatomic polynomials when the base ring is a polynomial ring.

The functionality issues:
1) The dynatomic polynomial function doesn't work when the base ring is a polynomial ring over a function field.

2) The dynatomic polynomial function doesn't work when the base ring is GF(p)[t] or QQ[t] and the map is not isotrivial. (for example f = x<sup>2</sup> + 3 works, but f = x<sup>2</sup> + t doesn't). However isotrivial maps in ZZ[t], RR[t], and CC[t] seem to work.

The documentation is added (and also to orbit() and nth_iterate())

Issue (1) is fixed by returning NotImplementedError

For (2), I'm not sure what you mean by "not works". It works fine for me. Yes, it doesn't do the division so it returns a rational function, but it is the correct rational function.


Also, I noticed there is a patchbot error on the ticket. The bot seems to be trying to apply bot patches, when it should only be applying the second. I thought this ticket is clearly marked for "apply", what else needs to be done?

Rebased for sage.5.10.beta1, but I'm having an issue with the doctest in

sage/doctest/source.py for the function _test_enough_doctests()

It is also getting:

"There are 4 tests in sage/schemes/projective/projective_point.py that are not being run"

As far as I can tell all tests in that file are being run. The documentation on _test_enough_doctests() says that it can sometimes miss count doctest for certain files. 

Is this the case here?

This is fixed now: the Abelian variety point tests were not being run.
