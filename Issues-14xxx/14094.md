As discovered live during the Sage Days 45 tutorial, the default fast iterator for Partitions(n) is recursive and breaks for n>988:

```
sage: P = Partitions(988)
sage: for p in P: print p
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<ipython console>", line 1, in <module>
  File "/opt/sage-5.6/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/combinat/partition.py", line 4282, in __iter__
    sage: all(test(mu,k) for k in range(1,5)
  File "/opt/sage-5.6/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/combinat/partition.py", line 4312, in _fast_iterator
    new_w.sort(reverse=True)
  File "/opt/sage-5.6/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/combinat/partition.py", line 4312, in _fast_iterator
    new_w.sort(reverse=True)
```

Whereas the generic iterator works:

```
sage: P = Partitions(988, max_part=1000)
sage: for p in P: print p
[988]
[987, 1]
[986, 2]
[986, 1, 1]
[985, 3]
```

Possible fix: either make the fast iterator non recursive, or default to the generic iterator.

Hey Mike,

I'm uploading a review patch which moves the functionality into a `.pyx` file. Here are my average timings:

```
# Using a python list as in your original implementation
sage: %time L = [x for x in ZS1_iterator(60)]
CPU times: user 3.97 s, sys: 0.18 s, total: 4.16 s
Wall time: 5.31 s

# Old recursive _fast_iterator
sage: P = Partitions(60)
sage: %time L = [x for x in P._fast_iterator()]                         
CPU times: user 15.11 s, sys: 0.64 s, total: 15.74 s
Wall time: 21.81 s

# Using C a int array
sage: %time L = [x for x in ZS1_iterator(60)]
CPU times: user 5.28 s, sys: 0.32 s, total: 5.60 s
Wall time: 6.11 s
```
I believe the python list will be faster mainly because converting from the C array into the python list will cause frequent memory allocations ([see here](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/cython-users/KnjF7ViaHUM:)). I don't know enough cython to do anything different. I also tried pushing the actual implementation into C and pulling back from that, but I would doubt that would net any additional performance increase (anyways, considering we get ~4x increase as is, it will likely be miniscule). I left my C int implementation as comments, feel free to delete.

Also I make this ZS iterator be the fast iterator for both `Partitions_all` and `Partitions_n`, remove the old ones, and add a doctest for `run_test`.

If you agree with my implementation, feel free to set this to positive review.

Thanks for finding and the first implementation of this algorithm,

Travis
