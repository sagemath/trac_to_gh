We are currently packaging some alpha version.

Moreover it would be a good time to:
* cleanup the spkg scripts,
* add a patch from Cygwin folks to build on Cygwin64 (see [ftp://cygwin.com/pub/cygwin/64bit/release/libgc/libgc-7.2d-2-src.tar.bz2 source package]),
* remove the Cygwin threads workaround (I don't need it to build on Cygwin64, did not test Cygwin, it seems though threaded libgc might be harmful on Cygwin but it was not the reason of the workaround which was only set up to let libgc build).

Use spkg at:

I've removed the two OS X patches (needed before on OS X 10.7) as it seems the relevant part is now upstream.
This needs testing.

Added a patch for Cygwin64, works ok.

Also removed the thread hack, it builds without it, not sure it can break something further.
