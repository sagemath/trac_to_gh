Many type checks in `rings/arith.py` use `isinstance` for checking whether something is an integer, for example. They should use `x in ZZ` instead, because not all cases are covered, leading to errors like the following:

```
sage: rising_factorial(-4, 2)
12
sage: rising_factorial(-4, SR(2))
0
sage: rising_factorial(SR(-4), SR(2))
RuntimeError: indeterminate expression: 0 * infinity encountered.
```

Setting to critical because this is very confusing, and can give silent errors such as `rising_factorial(-4, 2)` being different from `rising_factorial(-4, SR(2))`. The fact that `rising_factorial(-4, SR(2))` gives 0 is a separate error, ticket #14857.
