Looking at the patch, there seems to be a comma in the import statement rather than a dot. Also, is this an important enough class to warrant its own entry in the catalog? It's really easy to construct for end users anyway.

Really ? How could it work then ? `O_o`

Fixed, anyway !

Yeah, I wondered too. Three lines and no added values, as I cannot even give a general nice embedding... Well, this thing is also meant to be a database of graphs, actually, so the more the better. At some point I would also want to be able to test a conjecture on "all graphs that Sage knows how to build".

Well, it's up to you, I am not very convinced either. Actually, I was trying to create all the strongly regular graphs I could build from Brouwer's website and get them in Sage, but after writing this class I hit a wall trying to build another weird strongly regular graph, so I sent the patch.

It's up to you then. Otherwise we can close the ticket and the code will stay here until we chose to integrate it if we want. I do not really mind.

Have fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuun !

Well, given that nobody commented on this for 14 months, and the class is still trivial to construct, I propose to close the ticket and not add TriangularGraphs to Sage.

I don't know what status change is appropriate for this, so I'm leaving it as "needs_review" for now.
