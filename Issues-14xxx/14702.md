For example, `RealNumber(3.4, base=64)` will crash Sage with the error 

```
strtofr.c:798: MPFR assertion failed: base == 0 || (base >= 2 && base <= 62)
```

There should be an exception that catches this before it's passed to MPFR.

It's good that you found the `e` issue. But why allow only up to base 36? It seems to work up to and including 62.

Replying to [eviatarbach](#comment%3A5):

The documentation mentions that bases from 2 to 36 work. But if 62 works, then we should probably update the documentation too.
