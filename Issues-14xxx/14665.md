This is super-annoying when pasting in multi-line doctests (both old and new-style line continuation):

```
sage: sage: 1+\
....: ....: 4
  File "<ipython-input-2-13f362a81816>", line 2
    ....: Integer(4)
    ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```
With %cpaste:

```
sage: %cpaste
Pasting code; enter '--' alone on the line to stop or use Ctrl-D.
:   sage: 1 + \
:   ....: 4
:--
  File "<ipython-input-2-3a968492a164>", line 2
    ....: Integer(4)
    ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```
Single line works:

```
sage: %cpaste
Pasting code; enter '--' alone on the line to stop or use Ctrl-D.
:   sage: 5
:--
5
```
