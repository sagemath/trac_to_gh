Looks good Mike.

Thanks,

Travis

Some timings with the patch:

```
sage: %timeit StandardSkewTableaux([[8,3,2,1], [1,1]]).cardinality()
1000 loops, best of 3: 797 us per loop
```
Before:

```
sage: %timeit StandardSkewTableaux([[8,3,2,1], [1,1]]).cardinality()
1 loops, best of 3: 1.73 s per loop
```
