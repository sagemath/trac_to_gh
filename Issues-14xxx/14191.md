Given a quadratic form and a vector in a lattice we give a function to calculate the Fourier expansion of the associated Jacobi theta series. (See page 1 on Eichler-Zagier's "The Theory of Jacobi Forms" for a definition of a Jacobi theta series.) These are perhaps the easiest Jacobi forms to compute and in would be interesting to understand the space of Jacobi forms that they span.
