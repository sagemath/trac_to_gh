Annnnnnnnnnnd I think that this is the last one I can steal from www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/ without help in maths `^^;` 

The tests are rather long, but they are not flagged with "long time". This is because they are already flagged with "optional gap_packages", and 
1) I have no idea how flags should be stacked in such situations
2) with an "optional" flag the doctests will be almost never run, so let's not make it even rarer `:-P`

And. I computed some layouts for this graph, all of them looking like a giant black thing. That was in png. I also tried svg, and you can check at this address (if you can display it `:-P`) what we are missing by not adding the layout to Sage's constructor :
