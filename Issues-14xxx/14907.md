Does this patch have a dependency on #10630 and maybe something else? Something is wrong because I get errors.
One of the tests `from sage.combinat.matrix_type import primitives` I get the error:
`ImportError: No module named matrix_type`

I don't even know where to look for these.  Can someone point me to the right patches and maybe how to even look this up myself?
