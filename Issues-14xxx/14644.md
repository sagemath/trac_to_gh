I think

```
sage:  QQ(u'1') 
TypeError: Unable to coerce 1 (<type 'unicode'>) to Rational
```
should work. At least it would be more consistent with 

```
sage: ZZ(u'3')
3
sage: QQ('3')
3
```

<div id="comment:8" align="right">Comment 8</div>

It is hard to have a Python2 and 3 compatible code here:

|               | Python2          | Python3  |
|---------------|:------------------:|:----------:|
| common base |  `basestring`      |  ?         |
| bytes       |  `str` or `bytes`  |  `bytes` |
| unicode     |  `bytes`           |  `str`     |

A 2/3 compatible way is to add (do not know if it applies to Cython)

```
from past.builtins import basestring
```
Or alternatively use the `str` available in `builtins`

```
sage: from builtins import str
sage: isinstance('toto', str)
False
sage: isinstance(u'toto', str)
True
```

This isn't about Python 2 or Python 3. This is about Cython, which is actually a different language than either Python 2 or Python 3. And Cython always supports `basestring`.
