The manual for the jordan_form method on a matrix explicitly claims that the Jordan form is computed over arbitrary fields as long as the characteristic polynomial splits over there. This should particularly imply that the Jordan normal form of a nilpotent matrix is always computed. Unfortunately, this is not so:

```
sage: Qx = PolynomialRing(QQ, 'x11, x12, x13, x21, x22, x23, x31, x32, x33')
sage: x11, x12, x13, x21, x22, x23, x31, x32, x33 = Qx.gens()
sage: M = matrix(Qx, [[0, 0, x31], [0, 0, x21], [0, 0, 0]])
sage: M**3
[0 0 0]
[0 0 0]
[0 0 0]
sage: N = M.base_extend(Qx.fraction_field())
sage: N
[  0   0 x31]
[  0   0 x21]
[  0   0   0]
sage: N.base_ring() 
Fraction Field of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x11, x12, x13, x21, x22, x23, x31, x32, x33 over Rational Field
sage: N.jordan_form()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
NotImplementedError                       Traceback (most recent call last)

/home/darij/sage-5.6/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/matrix/matrix2.so in sage.matrix.matrix2.Matrix.jordan_form (sage/matrix/matrix2.c:43627)()

NotImplementedError: root finding for this polynomial not implemented
```

This seems to boil down to polynomial factorization over function fields not being implemented:

```
sage: N.characteristic_polynomial().factor()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

NotImplementedError: 
```

Maybe a workaround is adding a new key "nilpotent" to the jordan_form method which, when set to True, skips the factorization of the characteristic polynomial and lets sage know that the matrix is nilpotent? In my personal experience, nilpotent matrices are the ones with the most interesting Jordan forms, and skipping the useless factorization would probably save quite some CPU cycles for them.

**Update:** Here's a noobish patch, which adds an optional parameter to the jordan_form method allowing pre-computed factorizations of the characteristic polynomial. What do you guys think about it?

(This doesn't mean that we don't need a polynomial factorization algorithm for multivariate polynomial rings over QQ; but I guess that's for a different patch. We might want to do Jordan forms of, say, nilpotent matrices over fields where factorization isn't even theoretically possible.)

**Update 3:** Better version.

The code should not return the second but raise a type of error. Also, add to the doctest a test with your eigenvalues option with transformation=True to make sure it works as expected.

As a matter of style, avoid blank lines containing only blanckspaces (up to the indent level) in your code. I think this is not enforced though.
