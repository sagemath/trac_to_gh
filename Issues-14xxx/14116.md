I've written a new interface for polymake using its shared library interface, while trying to stay backward compatible with what there was before.

I've classified this as a defect, since the current interface doesn't work anymore.

This is presumably related to your comment about getting rid of `std::string cpp_string = <string><char*>python_string` stuff; the Cython in Sage is now 5.19.

I just pushed some initial work to

https://github.com/tkluck/sage/tree/polymake-upgrade

It integrates pypolymake with Sage, while keeping backwards compatibility with the old interface. Additionally, it adds an interface allowing you to specify polytopes by Sage expressions.

I'm having some trouble getting the doctests to work, since polymake has a habit of "spamming" stderr. (Actually, it outputs citation information, which is worthwhile. We do need to deal with it, though.) Also, trying to be backwards compatible both with Sage and with pypolymake leads to ugliness such as having both `n_points` and `num_points` methods.

I'm doing development in the new integrated git repository, which is supposed to replace the mercurial repositories sometime this Summer. Here are instructions for reviewing my branch. They include cloning the repository and building Sage from source, so this takes a lot of time. I will also make mercurial patches available for review at some point.

```
$ # clone the repository
$ git clone git://github.com/tkluck/sage.git
$ cd sage
$ git checkout -t polymake-upgrade
$ # get the upstream package for polymake
$ cd upstream
$ wget http://polymake.org/lib/exe/fetch.php/download/polymake-2.12-rc3.tar.bz2
$ mv polymake-2.12{-rc3,}.tar.bz2
$ cd ..
$ # build sage
$ MAKE="make -j4" make
$ # install the polymake package
$ ./sage -i polymake
$ # build the polymake interface, now that the package is available
$ ./sage -b
```

* Move the whole stuff to `sage/libs/polymake`
* Don't care about backward compatibility, the polymake library interface (like the PPL library interface) is not supposed to be the user-facing part
* Integrate polymake as one of the backends for polyhedra in Sage (and only this will be in sage/geometry)

Can you actually attach your patch? ;-)

There is also a note about Cython 0.17pre that is useless now. Can you remove it while you are at it?

I agree that we don't have to do everything on this ticket. But which base rings does polymake support, and which ones are wrapped here? The polymake web page says something about quadratic field extensions which might be interesting...

I'll make this into a mercurial patch at some point, but I haven't yet. These kind of updates (simultaneously updating a package and its library interface) are exactly the kind of thing the integrated repository was setup to do.

I am trying the new interface, but can't get Sage to build the pyx file.

```
$ touch src/sage/libs/polymake/polymake.pyx 
$ ./sage -br
<stuff not involving that file>
sage:
```
and of course that causes problems with 

```
sage: P = polymake.convex_hull([[1,0,0,0], [1,0,0,1], [1,0,1,0], [1,0,1,1],  [1,1,0,0], [1,1,0,1], [1,1,1,0], [1,1,1,1]])

or

```
sage: from sage.libs.polymake import polymake

I think that we need the following for a positive review.
* Fix the doctest issues in the previous comment.
* Provide a source tarball.
* Provide explicit instructions for how to acquire any prereqs for polymake (notably any Perl ones)
* Lots and lots of functions have no doctests.  :-(

This also definitely should close #5488.

How can I manually install the package to test it ?

Looking at the developer manual, I have copied the tar in my `upstream` dir and then tried `sage -i polymake`, but that fails by trying to upload the sources from the web. 

What should I do ?

Ooops, sorry for misreading the `-f`.

Still not working. I have got your polymake-2.12.tar.gz in my $SAGE_ROOT/upstream

and nothing among `sage (-i or -f) (polymake or polymake-2.12)` works

I have tried both on a clean develop and on the branch here.

This is almost certainly because you have too *new* (!) of a Perl - see [this report](http://forum.polymake.org/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=338#p1129).  See also e.g. http://forum.polymake.org/viewtopic.php?f=8&p=942#p942 which is really annoying, these things happen a lot.

It seems pretty likely that the 2.13 version should fix this.  I will see if that still builds on my 10.7 Mac.

See also http://www.polymake.org/doku.php/workshop1214 which points out that Mac 10.10 compatibility is not yet achieved, probably partly for some related reason.   Basically, polymake is definitely still in "optional" territory, if not experimental still!
