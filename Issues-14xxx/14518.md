There have been reports on build failures with the current zeromq optional spkg. It is also quite outdated and we should update. Here is a new spkg:

why did we unset `RM` in the past?  But I note that if you updated then perhaps you should have 

```

changed by one character :-)  Also, probably it doesn't need to be a p0, since we aren't making any changes to upstream, are we?

What parts of Sage depend on this?  Just the notebook?

Jason, will having this zeromq be fine for the sage cell server, since that was the source of at least one of the ask.sagemath questions about this?

The infamous `RM` was removed in #3537.

We don't have a particular policy about whether or not to start with `.p0`.

Don't we now? See [here](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/patching_spkgs.html) for at least a strong indication that p0 means patched - and I've seen this discussed on various tickets.  Typically I think it makes sense to have it without the p if there aren't any patches.  

Naturally, this discussion is bikeshedding and so I'm not going to complain (and I hope people try this out for solving their zeromq problems), but it's not a complete waste of time to make things clear what is patched and what isn't...

From the page that you linked:

If you start afresh from an upstream release without any patches to its source code, the resulting spkg need not have any patch-level labels (appending ”.p0” is allowed, but is optional).

Maybe we *should* have a policy; it's kind of confusing, and in principle it would be nice to be able to tell with `sage -i` at a glance which packages we could just slap in and which ones needed a little care and feeding.  In particular, should p0 mean no patches and p1 means patches?  I bet there is inconsistency here, too - I certainly feel like I've seen packages that were labeled p1 but then someone (perhaps the release manager) said they should be p0 since it was the first (zeroth, but we use Python, of course (!)) patch...  sorry for even wasting time on this but it does seem just this side of useful, again.

Thanks for providing a new spkg! Unfortunately, I still get the same problem on one VM (to which I have root access, but which I haven't set up myself. If you need more info about the machine let me know how to get it). The old and as well the new version of the spkg do compile on my own 64bit Ubuntu computer.
