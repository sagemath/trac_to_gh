-**UPDATE:** The doctest issue has been solved by Travis in #14772; my (updated) patch now just fixes the typos.
-
 * Apply: [attachment:trac_14882-spelling_in_backtrack-dg.patch]

-**Old description:** It's in the docstring of ``PositiveIntegerSemigroup``:
-
-```
-    EXAMPLES::
-
-        sage: from sage.combinat.backtrack import PositiveIntegerSemigroup
-        sage: PP = PositiveIntegerSemigroup()
-        sage: PP.category()

-        sage: PP.one()
-        1
-        sage: PP.an_element()
-        1
-        sage: some_elements = list(PP.some_elements()); some_elements

-
-    TESTS::
-
-        sage: from sage.combinat.backtrack import PositiveIntegerSemigroup
-        sage: PP = PositiveIntegerSemigroup()
-        sage: TestSuite(PP).run(elements=some_elements)
-```
-
-This TestSuite call takes 1.44 min on my machine, and this persists even if I replace the ``some_elements`` list (with length 100) by a list of length 2 or even an empty list. I don't see what there is that can be tested so long about positive integers...
-
-The attached patch doesn't solve the underlying problem, but just #longtimes the computation so that it does not lame me down when I want to doctest sage.combinat. I would love to help, but I don't know enough about test suites.

-The patch also fixes some spelling.
