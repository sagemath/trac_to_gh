Okay, so there's no dependency (I checked this). However there should not be periods '.' after the input's since they are not complete sentences. Also since we're bring the doc more up to spec, how about converting them to the conventions formatting of:

```
- ``arg`` -- a description of the arg
```

-**UPDATE:** The doctest issue has been solved by Travis in #14772; my (updated) patch now just fixes the typos.

-**Old description:** It's in the docstring of ``PositiveIntegerSemigroup``:

-    EXAMPLES::

-        sage: PP = PositiveIntegerSemigroup()
-        sage: PP.category()

-
-    TESTS::
-
-        sage: from sage.combinat.backtrack import PositiveIntegerSemigroup
-        sage: PP = PositiveIntegerSemigroup()
-        sage: TestSuite(PP).run(elements=some_elements)
-```
-
-This TestSuite call takes 1.44 min on my machine, and this persists even if I replace the ``some_elements`` list (with length 100) by a list of length 2 or even an empty list. I don't see what there is that can be tested so long about positive integers...
-
-The attached patch doesn't solve the underlying problem, but just #longtimes the computation so that it does not lame me down when I want to doctest sage.combinat. I would love to help, but I don't know enough about test suites.
-
-The patch also fixes some spelling.
