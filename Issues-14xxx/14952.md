The syntax for the if and while expressions in the logic module is inconsistant.  Most of the time, python conventions are not followed.  Here is what most of the expressions look like:

```python
if(<expression>):
    <stuff>

while(<expression>):
    <stuff>
```

Conventionally, if and while expressions are not in parentheses.  The task is to change all if and while expressions to the following:

```python
if <expression>:
    <stuff>

while <expression>:
    <stuff>
```

Depends on #14951

Looks good to me.   This is purely a formal notational changes. (Don't look at any code around it, or it will make you nervous -- that's for future work.)
