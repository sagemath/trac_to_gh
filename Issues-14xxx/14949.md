Trying to run `./pull` on an old clone of the source code, I get an error

```
abort: HTTP Error 301: The HTTP server returned a redirect error
that would lead to an infinite loop.
The last 30x error message was:
Moved Permanently
```

The first request was for http://www.sagemath.org/hg/sage-main?cmd=capabilities, all subsequent ones for http://www.sagemath.org/hg/?cmd=capabilities, so the latter is the thing which loops. I guess that I'll be able to work around this by creating a new checkout, but this misconfiguration is a bit annoying and against the specs nevertheless.
