I've been continuing work on this in my ipython-1.0 branch on github: https://github.com/jasongrout/sage/tree/ipython-1.0

I ran into some changes in IPython system_raw exit code that caused us problems.  I posted about it here: http://mail.scipy.org/pipermail/ipython-dev/2013-August/012102.html  But IPython 1.0 is released without this being resolved, so I think we ought to just update our doctests that are failing because of it.

I am also doing some experimental work on "string decorators" on that branch, inspired by what William did in sage cloud.  However, it's still at a preview stage.  I can turn it off by default, though, and we can continue to work on it.

./sage -b
rm -rf local/lib/python/site-packages/IPython* local/lib/python/site-package/ipython*
./sage -sh
easy_install ipython
```

They work.


For convenience, here is a single hg patch:

Just for the record: some of my students often get hit by some bracktraces not being printed out properly when using %attach. This looks like https://github.com/ipython/ipython/issues/2512.

Nothing critical, but they will appreciate the upgrade :-)

There is a single doctest that fails (in `src/sage/misc/interpreter.py`), but it doesn't match the behavior of running the test from the sage command line.

Also, we need some doctests for `sage.misc.interpreter.SagePreparseTransformer.reset`. Since I don't know the preparser code (and the `reset` keyword is documented as "a boolean"), it would be great if someone knowledgeable about this could fill in something here.

@jasongrout
I deleted the note about the prun_magics.patch since you deleted it in https://github.com/jasongrout/sage/commit/d662bf2655dcdc04100a8f29ccb88b790377b46a. Do we still need this?

I strongly agree with not waiting for IPython 2.0.  They also make some controversial modal changes to the IPython notebook, and I want to see how those shake out in wider testing before switching (i.e., it might be best to wait for 2.1).

> You need to put the tarball manually in the `upstream` directory until the ticket is reviewed. 

That's what I did.   It would be nice if the code that tries to grab the upstream from sagemath.org could also try other locations specified in the package, e.g., in this case https://pypi.python.org/packages/source/i/ipython/ipython-1.2.0.tar.gz...

I hope our longterm plan is that the process is:

```
   git <checkout a branch somehow>
   make
```
and it works, rather than

```
   git <checkout a branch somehow>
   make
   # see download failure -- track down packages -- put in upstream directory
   make
   # see more download failures -- track down packages -- put in upstream directory, etc.
```

?

*IMPORTANT*  This patch introduces this code in the middle of ```src/bin/sage-env``` *before* the path, etc., is properly set up:

```
if [ -x "$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/ipython" ]; then
    export IPYTHONDIR="$DOT_SAGE/ipython-"`ipython --version`
else
    # IPython is not yet installed
    export IPYTHONDIR="$DOT_SAGE/ipython-"`sed 's+\.p[0-9]*$++' "$SAGE_ROOT"/build/pkgs/ipython/package-version.txt`
fi
```

The result is that in a system with multiple version of Ipython (e.g., using python2.7.3 also) you'll get a big nasty ```ImportError: cannot import name MAXREPEAT``` error/traceback whenever you try to start sage (or use ```sage -sh```).    Moving the above IPYTHONDIR stuff to the bottom of the sage-env fixes the problem. 

That said, it's kind of disturbing to be starting up ipython when doing "sage -sh", since that's actually a lot of overhead.

> You changed the preparser to a stateless transformer, but the preparse function *does* have state---it keeps track of the quote state, right?

Yes, although that seems like a hack that was only needed in old versions of ipython. Now ipython doesn't push an open ended quote state to the transformers, so the preparser doesn't actually need to keep track of this anymore.

I think there is a lot that can be done to clean up the preparser in general, but I think that is better fit for another ticket.

All right +1.  IPython *does* push open-ended quotes into the preparser if the line is a syntax error (like `"a`).  However, the preparser is now always called with `reset=True` (the default), so the state doesn't carry over to the next line.

Here is a more complete explanation for it being okay to have a stateless transformation---it relies on two facts that are true right now:
* we've switched the preparser to be an IPython python_line_transform (which assembles multiline strings into single lines)
* the preparser has a default of reset=True, which means every time it is called, the state is discarded

If either of those changes, trouble would probably show up.

Other than that detail, this looks pretty much like the code I've been running on the sage cell server for nearly 6 months, so +1.
