We have

```
sage: RIF(1,2) == RIF(1,2)
False
```
which should say `True` instead. The same happens using `CIF` (or the generalisations `RealIntervalField` and `ComplexIntervalField`).

This happens in Sage 5.10 (not tested in any other versions).

It's a feature:

```
COMPARISONS:

Comparison operations (``==``, ``!=``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``>``, ``>=``)
return ``True`` if every value in the first interval has the given relation
to every value in the second interval. The ``cmp(a, b)`` function works
differently; it compares two intervals lexicographically. (However, the
behavior is not specified if given a non-interval and an interval.)
