1. The filenames should be filtered: `./sage -t --new` shouldn't test files which normally should't be tested (non-Python files or "nodoctest" files).

2. It would be cool if Mercurial queue was supported: test all files changed in the patch on top of the queue.

There are some weird plugin failures, but I don't think they're actually valid (it says there's a problem with doctest continuations and with building the documentation....)

I'm happy to give it a positive review.

Sorry for raising a dead ticket. Was there any special reason it had to be named `nodoctest.py` and by that I mean specifically the `.py` part. Was the idea that it could contain real python code? Any objection if I was removing or changing the extension?
