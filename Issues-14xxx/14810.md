On the first line, it should say 0.13.2. I also prefer listing the trac ticket also, as in 

```
 * Upgrade to 0.13.2 (trac #14810)
```
(Or list it in the mercurial commit message.)

Otherwise, it looks good.

Thanks!

Manually bookkeeping of revisions / trac tickets is of course precisely the mindless busywork that the source control system should do for you. Can't wait to switch to a unified git repo.. 

In any case I made the manual change and updated the spkg.
