On the first line, it should say 0.13.2. I also prefer listing the trac ticket also, as in 

```

(Or list it in the mercurial commit message.)

Manually bookkeeping of revisions / trac tickets is of course precisely the mindless busywork that the source control system should do for you. Can't wait to switch to a unified git repo..
