I think nauty_geng should not ignore geng's return value and return an exception if the returned value is not 0. Consider the following:

```
def find_counterexample(n):
   for G in graphs.nauty_geng("-c" + str(n)):
     if is_counterexample(G):
        print 'Yeees, there is a counterexample'
        return 
   print 'No counterexamples! Conjecture holds'
```

the code appears to be just fine but it has a bug! Namely it tries to run the program geng with the parameter "-cn" instead of "-c n". Hence geng returns an error and instead of getting an error in Sage, it simply does not generate  any graphs.

The branch implements the catching of geng's error.
We also clean up the code of graph_generators a bit.

A possible fix is to raise an error only when parameter debug is False and that something goes wrong.

When debug is True, the behavior remains the same as before and so we continue to display the message output by geng in stderr.

perhaps pyflakes is confused by `staticmethod()` thing.
The only place where a method from `strongly_regular_db` is used is

```
strongly_regular_graph = staticmethod(sage.graphs.strongly_regular_db.strongly_regular_graph)
```
by the way, I don't understand why it's not written as

```
from . import strongly_regular_db
...
strongly_regular_graph = staticmethod(strongly_regular_db.strongly_regular_graph)
```
Is it cause this code pre-dates `from .` syntax?
