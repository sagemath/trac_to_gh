Posets appear to have no mechanism to count the number of linear extensions other than computing all the linear extensions and finding the length of that list. Using recursion, one can count the number of linear extensions without having to generate all the linear extensions.

I've moved the code to `sage.categories.finite_poset`, which I realise is not what you've said, and added a note in the docstring saying one may prefer to count linear extensions of `P` by using `P.linear_extensions().cardinality()`, which uses the iterator belonging to `LinearExtensionsOfPoset` and avoids all the cacheing.

Fair point. `cardinality()` doesn't seem to live in `sage.combinat.posets.linear_extensions`, though. It looks like it comes from the `FiniteEnumeratedSets` category. Is it legitimate to give `LinearExtensionsOfPoset` a cardinality function with an argument to choose between the `_cardinality_from_iterator` from `FiniteEnumeratedSets` and counting recursively? My understanding of how categories are meant to work does not extend this far.

My understanding of categories is that when they prevent you from doing something you need then categories should be changed to allow you to do whatever you wanted to do in the first place.

To be precise, for an object in FiniteEnumeratedSets, cardinality is
set by default to _cardinality_from_iterator. So it indeed goes
through all linear extensions. However the counting is done along the
way, without storing them. So the memory complexity is roughly
constant (well, linear in the size of one linear extension).

Certainly: in any object oriented system, abstract classes are here to
provide you with default implementations. By design they are meant to
be overridden whenever there is a better algorithm in a special case
and the application in mind makes it worth it to implement that
algorithm

Categories are nothing but a way to organize those abstract classes.

Replying to [kdilks](#comment%3A7):

> There's a fast way to count chains that doesn't involve iterating over all of them.


What is it?

If there are several ways to do this, none of which is best from all sides, shouldn't we then have `algorithm`-keyword for the function? And in any version I guess that the poset should first be splitted to connected parts.

Is there something wrong with making a function with dumb implementation first? Then we would have a reference implementation, docstring and already thinked interface and place for the function.

The `#P` result you keep citing only applies to generating a list all linear extensions, not counting them. For example, I can tell you that the number of linear extensions of an antichain of size n is n!, independent of any complexity issues that arise when trying to generate all n! permutations.

The algorithm is used in Stembridge's Posets package. The general idea is that linear extensions are maximal chains in the lattice of order ideals.

If you want to enumerate (not generate) maximal chains, then you can use fact that if f(x) is the number of saturated chains from a minimal element to x, then f(y) = sum f(x) over all x covered by y.

If we wanted to keep the code simple, we could just create the lattice of order ideals `J(P)` using Sage. But then the elements of this poset would be subsets, and we'd have another (potentially expensive) computation to make the Hasse diagram and get a naturally labelled poset on `0...(|I|-1)` (where `|I|` is the number of order ideals). I think I tried this implementation in the past, and it was still an order of magnitude or two slower than the corresponding Maple code.

However, there should be some wizardry that lets us quickly create a dictionary on `0 .. (|I|-1)` corresponding to the up edges in `J(P)`. That wizardry is what I'm trying to figure out.

This algorithm works whether or not P is connected. However, there would be some significant speed-up for posets with a large number of connected components if we just counted the number of linear extensions on each connected component, and combined the results appropriately (if f(P) is the number of linear extensions on P, and P=P_1 U ... U P_k , then f(P)= multinomial(|P|,{|P_1|,...,|P_k|}) * product f(P_i) .

For example, say we look at the anti-chain of 11 elements. Currently, we have to iterate over close to 40 million permutations. Using the wizardry, we would just have to create a dictionary of 2048 elements corresponding to up-edges in the Boolean lattice and iterate over it. And if we split into connected components...getting 11! is almost automatic.

Of course there are easy answers for some posets. For the ordinal sum of `P` and `Q` the count is just product.

But I will wait for the code and see.

Very interesting! Must think about this.

And `as_ideals=False` will get still more speed.

This got more speed with even very basic implementation of maximal chains counting:

```
def countmax(P):
    L = P.level_sets()
    c = {}
    for l in L[0]:
        c[l] = 1
    for lev in L[1:]:
        for l in lev:
            c[l] = sum(c[i] for i in P.lower_covers(l))
    return sum(c[i] for i in P.maximal_elements())
```

If we have better way to make a order ideals lattice, it is a place for new ticket. It would be nice feature in itself.

Hmm... Assuming we have `n`-element poset `P` and corresponding `L=J(P)`, how we modify `L` when we add element `n+1` as a minimal element to `P`? I guess the algorithm should be done by thinking this.

Yes. It probably makes sense to deprecate `as_ideals`, and change it to a keyword like `representative` that defaults to `ideal`, but can also be `antichains` or `integers`.

That could be done now; a little less time for new users to learn a feature to be deprecated.

True, but then whole decomposition will be just one check to see that the poset can not be decomposed.

And in any case that should a place for it's own ticket.
