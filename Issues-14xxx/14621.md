I just found this gem in the Sage preparser: It parses `^^` as a single `^` for the exclusive or operator.

The attached patch fixes the Sage Tutorial and FAQ sections in the documentation with this little info.

Just asking... in the code for `preparse` we have

```
    # Use ^ for exponentiation and ^^ for xor
    # (A side effect is that **** becomes xor as well.)
    L = L.replace('^', '**').replace('****', '^')
```
Do we want to document the `****` here?  My preference is not to do so, but since we didn't even have the `^^` documented (though I know a lot of people who did use it), maybe we should document it too.

Otherwise very nice work!

I wouldn't document it (other than in the code) either, since it's an *unintended* side-effect, may change one day, I don't think anybody is going to use that "feature", and it's unlikely to break anything (i.e., it's IMHO not a pitfall typical users may run into).
