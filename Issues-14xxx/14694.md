OK, I check on a vanilla 5.12.beta1 and there is one more doctest failure as with 0.7.2 on sage-on-gentoo:

```
sage -t --long devel/sage/sage/symbolic/constants.py

File "devel/sage/sage/symbolic/constants.py", line 715, in sage.symbolic.constants.NotANumber._sympy_
Failed example:

    True
Got:
    False
**********************************************************************
1 item had failures:
   1 of   3 in sage.symbolic.constants.NotANumber._sympy_

The other patch works fine. We may want to get upstream involved with that one.
