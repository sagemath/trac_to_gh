Making the conversion work would actually require a change in SymPy, since currently we look for the `_sage_` method in SymPy objects, which isn't defined for `Piecewise`.\n\nI couldn't think of anything else to do except modifying the doctest, at least until the conversions are fixed upstream. What do you suggest?",

Because now SymPy returns a `Piecewise` object for that integral, which can't be converted back to Sage. Making the conversion work would actually require a change in SymPy, since currently we look for the `_sage_` method in SymPy objects, which isn't defined for `Piecewise`.

I couldn't think of anything else to do except modifying the doctest, at least until the conversions are fixed upstream. What do you suggest?

At least, mark the existing doctest `# known bug`.
