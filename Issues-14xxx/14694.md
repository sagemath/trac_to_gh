OK, I check on a vanilla 5.12.beta1 and there is one more doctest failure as with 0.7.2 on sage-on-gentoo:

```
sage -t --long devel/sage/sage/symbolic/constants.py
**********************************************************************
File "devel/sage/sage/symbolic/constants.py", line 715, in sage.symbolic.constants.NotANumber._sympy_
Failed example:

Got:
    False
**********************************************************************
1 item had failures:
   1 of   3 in sage.symbolic.constants.NotANumber._sympy_
```
The other patch works fine. We may want to get upstream involved with that one.

```

<a id='comment:23'>Comment 23:</a>
Because now SymPy returns a `Piecewise` object for that integral, which can't be converted back to Sage. Making the conversion work would actually require a change in SymPy, since currently we look for the `_sage_` method in SymPy objects, which isn't defined for `Piecewise`.

I couldn't think of anything else to do except modifying the doctest, at least until the conversions are fixed upstream. What do you suggest?

At least, mark the existing doctest `# known bug`.
