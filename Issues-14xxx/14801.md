Many doctests fail in the new code. For example:

```
sage: f = piecewise([((0,1), x^3), ([-1,0], -x^2)]);  f
piecewise(x|-->x^3 on (0, 1), x|-->-x^2 on [-1, 0]; x)
sage: f(x=1/2)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-2-6d710eda1bb0> in <module>()
----> 1 f(x=Integer(1)/Integer(2))

TypeError: new_f() got an unexpected keyword argument 'x'
```
I am not well versed in Python. I think there is maybe a problem in `symbolic/function_factory.pyx:eval_on_operands()` (dynamic methods for symbolic expressions, added with #9556) which is uncovered with this ticket.

```
def eval_on_operands(f):
    @sage_wraps(f)
    def new_f(ex):
        return f(*ex.operands())
    return new_f
```
Apparently `f` gets some `new_f` on creation and tries to call it with a named parameter but python barfs because the parameter wasn't expected in `new_f`. Moreover, even without name `f(1/2)` barfs because the number of arguments to `new_f` doesn't fit anymore. So only `f()` will call `new_f` succesfully but that's useless.

Yeah, I don't know how we are going to deal with this.   I suspect we should have `Piecewise` for the old-style one for a deprecation period and `piecewise` for the new ones.  The current changes here aren't really a deprecation at all, but rather a backwards-incompatible change.

Now on to the remaining two errors. This code throws:

```
sage: f = piecewise_real([((-1,1), x)]);  f; g = f.extension(0);  g; g(3)
```
It works however if I patch `rings/real_lazy.pyx`:

```
diff --git a/src/sage/sets/real_set.py b/src/sage/sets/real_set.py
index adc41d3..1d43cc4 100644

         if cmp_lower == cmp_upper == -1:
             return True
         if cmp_lower == 0:
```
So, as this fixes it and passes tests, I'm committing and proposing this branch for review.

Now that the comparisons with infinity are fixed we should be able to get this finished. I don't like the separate `piecewise_real` thing. If there is some problem with symbolic expressions then that should be fixed. I'll have a look now.

Seems that Volker already implemented it, just the doctests have to be adapted, and the `cmp` stuff from #16397:

```
sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(QQ, 'x')
sage: f = Piecewise([[(0,1),1*x^0]])

See http://trac.sagemath.org/14801 for details.

sage -t --long src/sage/functions/piecewise.py  # 3 doctests failed

Not sure if we need these, they are demonstrated in the failing `src/doc/en/constructions/calculus.rst` doctests:
* `convolution()`
* `critical_points()`
* `riemann_sum_integral_approximation()`

Given that

```
f(x) = foo
```
is preprocessor syntactic sugar for

```
f = foo.function(x)
```
the simplest solution might be to override the `.function()` method to also change the variable name of the piecewise function.

As far as I understand it, the only time `symbolic_expr.function(..)` recurses into the expression is when converting into the `CallableSymbolicExpressionRing` which calls `SymbolicRing._element_constructor_()`. I don't think I can easily hand `var` down to that machinery, recognize when a `piecewise` get converted, and call a member func then.

IOW, the `piecewise` on the r.h.s. of `f(x) = piecewise([((0,2), y^3)])` may be buried within an expression, and I find it not the "simplest solution" to handle its `var` via `.function()`. But that's from a first look at parts of the code I have never worked with, so I would appreciate any hint.

OK, this works now with **one** variable, dependent on #17759 (please review). I'm of the opinion this should work too:

```
sage: f(x,y) = piecewise([((0,2), y^3)])
sage: f(1,1)
TypeError: __call__() takes at most 5 arguments (6 given)
```
but I have no idea atm what changes are needed for this. `piecewise([((0,2), y^3)], var=(x,y))` is certainly not supported now.

Indeed, as the discussion in https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!topic/sage-devel/dgwUMsdiHfM foresaw, lambdas will be a problem with this, as they cannot be coerced to SR. 

```
sage: f1 = lambda x: -1; f2 = lambda x: 2                   
sage: piecewise([((0,pi/2),f1), ((pi/2,pi),f2)])
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
```
There is one doctest in src/doc/en/constructions/calculus.rst that requires it.

But it doesn't even work with `NewSymbolicFunction`:

```
sage: function('newf2')(x)                      
newf2(x)
sage: piecewise([((0,pi/2),x), ((pi/2,pi),f2)])
```
for which there seems a solution in #17701.

As #16397 is accepted let's summarize the current situation. There are two doctests failing with just a different number of graphics objects, easily fixed, which leaves five fails in `doc/en/constructions/calculus.rst` due to:
* missing `piecewise.laplace`
* missing `piecewise.fourier_series_sine_coefficient`
* missing `piecewise.fourier_series_cosine_coefficient`
* missing `piecewise.fourier_series_partial_sum`
* lambdas not coercible into SR (line 381)

As to the last item I think the doctest could be changed to no longer use a lambda. Users depending on it could use `piecewise_old`. We could make this ticket dependent on #17701 to at least have anonymous symbolic functions working as in `function('newf2')(x)`.

If people insist on lambdas and def'ed Python functions as arguments to `piecewise` it might be an idea to create a temporary anonymous function (check for `types.FunctionType`) but this depends on #17701 if the idea can be made to work.

    sage: f = piecewise([((0,pi/2),f1(x)), ((pi/2,pi),f2(x))])

Ralf and Volker have done such great work on this and I really am very much looking forward to this being put into Sage. Also, I don't see any examples which used to work but don't work with the new version you've made.

A comment on how I tested this (since I don't know git), I downloaded your piecewise.py file from git. Added it to a new version of [SageMath](../wiki/SageMath) (since "sage -clone" no longer works) and ran "sage -b". Then I started sage and just ran then examples in the docstring. I tweeked several just to see how minor changes affected things. They all went perfectly.
