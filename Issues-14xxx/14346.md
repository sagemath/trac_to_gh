This spkg has many patches, with the following:

Good:
* get_ld.patch: author known, pure packaging
* get_tests.patch: author known, pure packaging
* install_doc_no_make.patch: author known, pure packaging
* perl_path.patch: author known, pure packaging
* cygwin_dll_a.patch: author known, pure packaging
* GCC_PR49330.patch: author mentioned, discussed with upstream, upstream decided not to fix this
* get_dlcflags.patch: author known, partially accepted by upstream
* KERNELCFLAGS.patch: author known, forwarded upstream
* trac_13902_determinant.patch: author mentioned, upstream backport
* polred.patch: author mentioned, upstream backport

Bad:
* get_config_options.patch: author known, upstream-worthy, no comment says it was forwarded, which probably means it wasn't
* get_fltk.patch: author known, upstream-worthy, no comment says it was forwarded, which probably means it wasn't
* get_X11.patch: author known, upstream-worthy, no comment says it was forwarded, which probably means it wasn't
* mp.c.patch: author unknown, should be replaced by a Sage library patch.

Depends on #14539

The commits used were from upstream, but the patch is **based** on those commits -- it's not just them. That means that the pari in sage is neither compatible with upstream's 2.5.3, nor with the upcoming 2.6.0.

So yes, we can hope that when sage will package pari 2.6.0, then it will stop forking pari and become compatible with something debian can package seriously.

Which patches are you refering to?

Please elaborate how we should add PARI patches to the Sage library.

Backporting is standard practice, to gain a bugfix or a new feature which is only available in a later version.

The current situation is different : some modifications are backports, and some are new code.

The backported patches have their places in the pari spkg, but the new code should be in the sage library.

Ok, let's be explicit:
1. in general there are fifteen patches in this spkg, which is way too much ;
2. in particular polred.patch is a mix between a backport and a new development.

I claim putting new developments in a package is against standard packaging practice.

And I use the verb "break" because that's what will happen when sage will want to include the next pari version...

As I tried to tell you several times, this patch is a backport from upstream PARI-2.6, the added function comes from PARI-2.6.

I checked too, and indeed polredbest looks like it's upstream, so I confirm that I was wrong and that polred.patch isn't that bad.

Why should it go into Sage's codebase? Sage is probably always going to need PARI + extra patches, not just vanilla PARI. So what's the point of moving this one patch into Sage?

It is again a problem of confusion between sage-the-distribution and sage-the-software ; the current sage-the-software won't work with pari 2.5.4, because it depends on polredbest (at least).

This is a problem for debian ; see the discussion about my
[debian bug report](http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=703116).

I'm not sure pari 2.6 will be a solution real soon: I just tried to make a pari 2.6 spkg from an upstream snapshot (taking the current spkg and removing the patches) :
1. it compiled ok ;
2. eclib compiled ;
