Dumps doesn't save immutability for matrices over GF(2).

Simple example:

```
z = zero_matrix(GF(2), 3)
z.set_immutable()
print(z.is_immutable())
zstr = z.dumps()
z2 = loads(zstr)
print(z2.is_immutable())
```

This affects saving matrices and in particular raises `TypeError('mutable matrices are unhashable',)` when these matrices are used in hashed collections (set/dict etc):

```
z = zero_matrix(GF(2), 3)
z.set_immutable()
s = set()
s.add(z)
sstr = dumps(s)
s2 = loads(sstr)
```

**Work Around for saving:**
Saving lists of matrices works just fine, so if you need to save a set or dictionary, convert to/from a list on before/after save.
