The new doctesting framework (#12415) on Solaris gives lots of warnings like

```
sage -t --long devel/sage/sage/plot/plot.py
**********************************************************************
File "devel/sage/sage/plot/plot.py", line 236, in sage.plot.plot
Failed example:
    (g1+g2).show(ticks=pi/6, tick_formatter=pi)  # show their sum, nicely formatted
Expected nothing
Got:
    Warning: invalid value encountered in isinf
    Warning: invalid value encountered in isinf
    Warning: invalid value encountered in isinf
    [...]
    Warning: invalid value encountered in isinf
    Warning: invalid value encountered in isinf
    Warning: invalid value encountered in isinf
```
These warnings are actually harmless and are indirectly caused by the fact that Python doesn't find the `isinf()` C library function. From `spkg/logs/python-2.7.3.p5.log`:

```
[...]
checking whether isinf is declared... no
checking whether isnan is declared... yes
checking whether isfinite is declared... no
[...]
```
These functions are defined by C99 and Python's `configure` does find `isinf` and `isfinite` when compiled with -D__C99FEATURES__. So we should add a compiler flag to fix this.

**spkg**: [http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/spkg/python-2.7.3.p6.spkg](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/spkg/python-2.7.3.p6.spkg)

To test: build this spkg, rebuild numpy (optionally: rebuild everything which depends on Python, including the Sage library).

### python-2.7.3.p6 (Jeroen Demeyer, 24 March 2013)
* Trac #14265: Compile with -D__C99FEATURES__ on Solaris.
* Remove workaround for http://bugs.python.org/issue6954
  (which is fixed upstream).
* Rename environment variable EXTRAFLAGS to PYTHON_CONFIGURE for
  consistency with other packages and allow it to be set by the user.
* Add check that the ctypes and readline (required for IPython) and
  socket (required for setuptools) modules can be imported.
* Don't add the -fwrapv flag (no longer needed since Python-2.7.3 adds
  this flag for Clang).

Note that this also affects any Python extension module built with distutils, as the latter (by default) use the flags Python was built with.  (This also applies to C++ files btw. ...)

So for testing, one should at least rebuild the whole Sage library as well (e.g. with `./sage -ba-force`).




Solaris is the only OS I'm aware of (and Sage supports) where GCC does **not** default to `gnu99` (for C input files).

I think GCC never defaults to gnu99/c99. It must be that glibc always declares isinf(), even in C89 mode.

Confused that with `__STDC__`, which GCC defines on anything but Solaris by default.

GLIBC's `math.h` only defines `isinf()` etc. if `__USE_ISOC99` is defined, but that's apparently "frequently" the case (see `features.h`.)

True, it applies to C++ also, but this doesn't seem to cause problems:

Given that:
1. this has been tested on the buildbot with no issues,
2. it fixes an issue on Solaris,
3. the fact that Distutils compiles C++ files as C files is not easily solved,
I think this ticket is still ready for review.

I added a patch to remove the c99 options which are currently in `module_list.py`.

Not really, Python's `spkg-install` would always add the C99 flag.

> it's good to have documented which modules actually (seem to) require C99...

Why, what's the added value?  Removing all those extra C99 flags simplifies `module_list.py` and I'm always in favour of simplification.

You probably misunderstood me.

Do `env CFLAGS="-DFOO" ./sage -ba` and the `-std=gnu99` vanishes, so we must not remove `-std=c99` from the `extra_compile_flags` (or what it's called).

As an alternative (I see no reason for), unconditionally (except for C++ sources perhaps) explicitly add `-std=gnu99` in `setup.py`.

<a id='comment:21'>Comment 21:</a>
Building Sage 5.8.rc0 from scratch with this spkg on mark (Solaris 5.10, GCC 4.7.0, CFLAGS et al. not set), I get a lot of (additional, I think) warnings, and at least SageNB and the Sage library fail to build:

```

That was a mistake, it should be prepended, fixed now.

Indeed, it is required at least for OpenSolaris (hawk).

> any other relevant changes?

Removing `-fwrapv` since Python's `configure` now adds it for compilers named `*clang*`.

Haven't investigated further yet (will rebuild parts and rerun ptestlong later), but *I think<sup>TM</sup>* most of the following failures are of that kind:

```
	sage -t  --long -force_lib devel/sage/sage/crypto/mq/sr.py # 1 doctests failed
	sage -t  --long -force_lib devel/sage/sage/libs/ppl.pyx # 8 doctests failed
	sage -t  --long -force_lib devel/sage/sage/matrix/matrix_modn_dense.pyx # 5 doctests failed
	sage -t  --long -force_lib devel/sage/sage/matrix/matrix_modn_dense_template.pxi # 5 doctests failed
	sage -t  --long -force_lib devel/sage/sage/misc/interpreter.py # 1 doctests failed
	sage -t  --long -force_lib devel/sage/sage/misc/temporary_file.py # 1 doctests failed
	sage -t  --long -force_lib devel/sage/sage/parallel/decorate.py # 2 doctests failed
	sage -t  --long -force_lib devel/sage/sage/tests/cmdline.py # 9 doctests failed
```

More details later;  [here](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/leif/Sage/tmp/sage-5.8.rc0+14265-gcc-4.7.0-mark.ptestlong.v1.log)'s the "preliminary" log.

`sage/parallel/decorate.py` passed now (tested separately; no rebuilds yet).

All failures in `sage/libs/ppl.pyx` are (apparently reproducibly) `Expected: foo Got: WARNING: ... foo`.  Same for `sage/misc/interpreter.py`; similar for `sage/misc/temporary_file.py` and `sage/tests/cmdline.py`.

Why t!** f!*** is IPython involved at all?

When testing `sage/crypto/mq/sr.py`, I also get the warning at the beginning (but not in `Got:`), then a `RuntimeError: Bus Error`.  Same for `sage/matrix/matrix_modn_dense{.pyx,_template.pxi}`, plus some errors due to the previous bus error(s) I think.

Well, it previously worked without `_ctypes`, so why require it now?  Just for `%gui`?

Something with IPython (or doctesting) is broken, so that should (also) get fixed.  (I don't think the spkg here is causing it.)

If the new IPython requires `ctypes`, then we should check for it.

I feel like we're wandering away too much away from the essence of this ticket, which is ensuring that Python compiles the `isinf()` function. The fact that it doesn't work with GCC-4.7.0 doesn't matter for now.

Well it doesn't, otherwise it wouldn't build, or issue an error message instead of just a warning.

And as said, previous versions did build and work with GCC 4.7.0, so there's a regression.

Do you mean GCC-4.7.0 with GNU ld which is installed system-wide on mark or do you mean a custom-built GCC-4.7.0 with Sun ld? Because building Sage on mark with GNU ld never worked for me (at least `libpng` doesn't build).

I'm going to try building Sage on mark with GCC-4.7.2 (the optional spkg) + Sun ld. If that works with this spkg, I think there is no reason to hold up this ticket.

The system-wide GCC 4.7.0 (which is configured to use GNU ld).

Unfortunately, with the default setup on the skynet machines (`/usr/local/skynet_bash_profile`), the Sun linker comes first in `PATH`, so some packages get confused, assuming the wrong linker.

E.g. to build libpng, you have to

```sh
export LD=/usr/local/binutils-2.22/sparc-SunOS-ultrasparc3-gcc-4.6.2-without-zlib/bin/ld
```



> I'm going to try building Sage on mark with GCC-4.7.2 (the optional spkg) + Sun ld. If that works with this spkg, I think there is no reason to hold up this ticket.

Yes.  I was going to try that as well.  (I'll open a ticket for building Singular with GCC 4.7.x on Solaris soon; only needs a trivial patch to `kernel/bigintmat.cc`.)

The odd IPython warnings (and/or making Python properly build `_ctypes` on Solaris SPARC) should be fixed on another ticket.

Hopefully Sage 5.9.beta* gets out soon... ;-)

I've now successfully built *vanilla* Sage 5.8.rc0 (plus the fix for Singular, cf. #14295) on mark2 (with `CFLAGS` et al. set, FWIW), and while I still get the IPython warnings, Sage at least starts up without errors.

Currently building the docs to afterwards run ptestlong.

It seems that OpenSolaris is much more strict about C99. In particular, there doesn't seem to be a clean way to compile both C and C++ with the same compiler options.

So perhaps we should try compiling C89 but with `-D__C99FEATURES__` which enables a few things from C99 such as `isinf()`.

Seems much better.  `-D_XPG6` is a hack anyway, as both `_XOPEN_SOURCE=600` and _POSIX_C_SOURCE=200112L` require C99.

Or define your own macros `#ifndef`... ;-)

No.

It's all about giving the user at least the *possibility* to override this option. In general, we should never force things on the user, it the user wants to do stupid things, he should be able to.
