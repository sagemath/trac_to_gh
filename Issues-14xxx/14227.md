There are a few cython files that assume that the sage library lives in `devel/sage`, which breaks building the library when this is not the case.

**Installation Instructions**:
* apply [attachment:trac14227.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket14227/trac14227.patch) to the sage library
