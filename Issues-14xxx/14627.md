As discussed on https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/hnO8gT8VON4/YyZ5UCM5wUEJ, unsigned longs are much slower than signed longs when converted to a Python object.

Without patch about 20x slower than naive list-of-list implementation:

```
$ sage test_matrix_modn_float.py
setA:
5 loops, best of 50: 179 ms per loop
setB:
25 loops, best of 50: 10.3 ms per loop
```
With patch no performance difference:

```
$ sage test_matrix_modn_float.py
setA:
25 loops, best of 50: 11.5 ms per loop
setB:
25 loops, best of 50: 12.8 ms per loop
```

Also, I collected some common extern cdef statements in pxd headers and cleaned up the `MAX_MODULUS` declarations.

The `sage.libs.pari.gen.pari` gave me import errors after taking out some import statements. The module already imports it as `pari` on module-level so the short version should have been used from the start.

re: pxi vs. pxd: They are concluding with "Now that "cimport *" can be used, there is no reason to use .pxi files for external declarations." I think it would be better to use a .pxd which seems to be best practice as recommended by the Cython devs. But I am not insisting on it.

In other news: all tests passed.
