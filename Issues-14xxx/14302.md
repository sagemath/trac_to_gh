Replying to [jdemeyer](#comment%3A7):

Dear Jeroen,

since you just merged #14123 into sage-5.10.rc0, I wonder if it would be a big deal to also merge this ticket. We have a workshop on www.FindStat.org in two weeks, and having this as well merged would make life a bit easier there.

Cheers, Christian
