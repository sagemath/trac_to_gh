At [this ask.sagemath.org question](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/1449/sage-uses-system-wide-python), where some users have the system Python being picked up for some reasons, Volker asks

```
Can you try
export PYTHONNOUSERSITE=yes
sage
This should prevent Sage from picking up stuff in .local/lib. If that fixes your problem we can add it to the next release.
```
Apparently this works, and [this sage-support question](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/sage-support/Y9bjhb6-dcM) suggests it works a lot.  Maybe we should put this in now.

That we do this is a shame.   It only further alienates Sage from standard practices.   It makes it so this FAQ entry is no longer valid: 

https://github.com/sagemathinc/smc/wiki/FAQ#-question-how-can-i-install-python-packages-from-httpspypipythonorgpypi--using-pip 

It makes it very, very painful for anybody to ever install Python packages and use them without Sage, without actually modifying a Sage install.  This is very much exactly the opposite direction in which we should be going.     Big -1.

There are two different use cases:
* A private build of Sage (everything user-writable) should not conflict with another private numpy installation. You can use pip just fine without the `--user` option. Then `PYTHONNOUSERSITE=yes` is the way to achieve that.
* A system-wide build of Sage (nothing user-writable, so just `pip install foo` cannot work) should work with `pip --user`. This is the SMC problem.
Really this is a special case of distinguishing a build-from-source and a binary install. Sage traditionally pretends that there is no difference, but there is.

Agreed.  I think the terminology "build-from-source" and "binary install" is a little misleading though, since *I* did build the SMC install from source myself.    Maybe "system-wide" versus "personal install" would be a better distinction. 

Any thoughts about how to technically distinguish between these two types of setups?  A flag to ./configure on first build?  Something else?

Awesome -- a very good step in the right direction!

Of course every software must be built from source at one point, possibly by your distributor ;-)

The easiest way would probably be to check if `$SAGE_ROOT` is writable by the current user. 

In fact, there are four different cases for the two independent choices:
* Private install (I have write permissions) vs. system-wide (I do not have write permissions)
* Build from source vs. using a pre-built binary
The issue here only depends on the first choice.
