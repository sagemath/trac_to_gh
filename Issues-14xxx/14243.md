At [this ask.sagemath.org question](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/1449/sage-uses-system-wide-python), where some users have the system Python being picked up for some reasons, Volker asks

```
Can you try
export PYTHONNOUSERSITE=yes
sage
This should prevent Sage from picking up stuff in .local/lib. If that fixes your problem we can add it to the next release.
```
Apparently this works, and [this sage-support question](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/sage-support/Y9bjhb6-dcM) suggests it works a lot.  Maybe we should put this in now.

It makes it very, very painful for anybody to ever install Python packages and use them without Sage, without actually modifying a Sage install.  This is very much exactly the opposite direction in which we should be going.     Big -1.

I made a horrible typo.  I meant "It makes it very, very painful for anybody to ever install Python packages and use them **with** Sage, without actually modifying a Sage install."   

This is an absolutely massive problem with SageMathCloud, where there is one Sage install and (literally) 15,000 users on a single computer that use that Sage install.   They can't all have their own copy of Sage.  So when they install packages (often from pip) to use *with* Sage, they have to use the --user flag.

https://github.com/sagemathinc/smc-sage/commit/7c9cfd095463091bcf41e1c6ea6e8eebfb61f00c

This works for me, I guess.  However, I doubt I'm the only person with this problem.

I think the right solution in this case should be better educate people about how to control their Python packaging.  For example, for those ask posts, and this problem, we should instead have something in the README about PYTHONNOUSERSITE=yes, and a link to the relevant Python docs.

    "body": "<a id='comment:14'></a>\nFollow up.  I think we absolutely must move to a model where we make it easy for users to create and share packages of code that depend on Sage.   Our current spkg system is a complete failure in this regard, and has only got worse with its tight integration into the Sage git repo.    In constrast, setuptools and pypi -- the official Python packaging framework -- works very well, is heavily tested, and there's tons of documentation and tutorials.  Instead of making it much harder to use pip/setuptools/pypi with Sage, which is what this trac ticket does, we should be making it much easier.  \n\nThere are about 6,000 user-created R packages in Rcran -- I've installed many of these (ok, dozens requested by users), and they all install perfectly.  Sage could have hundreds or even thousands of packages on pip right now.  We could have an automated testing framework that downloads them all and builds them, and runs their test suites (setuptools has integrated test suite support).   We could decide to include some of these packages standard with Sage, and referee them.   It's an epic mistake that we aren't doing this with a passion right now.  Let's not make it even more difficult.",

Follow up.  I think we absolutely must move to a model where we make it easy for users to create and share packages of code that depend on Sage.   Our current spkg system is a complete failure in this regard, and has only got worse with its tight integration into the Sage git repo.    In constrast, setuptools and pypi -- the official Python packaging framework -- works very well, is heavily tested, and there's tons of documentation and tutorials.  Instead of making it much harder to use pip/setuptools/pypi with Sage, which is what this trac ticket does, we should be making it much easier.  

There are about 6,000 user-created R packages in Rcran -- I've installed many of these (ok, dozens requested by users), and they all install perfectly.  Sage could have hundreds or even thousands of packages on pip right now.  We could have an automated testing framework that downloads them all and builds them, and runs their test suites (setuptools has integrated test suite support).   We could decide to include some of these packages standard with Sage, and referee them.   It's an epic mistake that we aren't doing this with a passion right now.  Let's not make it even more difficult.

There are two different use cases:
* A private build of Sage (everything user-writable) should not conflict with another private numpy installation. You can use pip just fine without the `--user` option. Then `PYTHONNOUSERSITE=yes` is the way to achieve that.
* A system-wide build of Sage (nothing user-writable, so just `pip install foo` cannot work) should work with `pip --user`. This is the SMC problem.
Really this is a special case of distinguishing a build-from-source and a binary install. Sage traditionally pretends that there is no difference, but there is.

Agreed.  I think the terminology "build-from-source" and "binary install" is a little misleading though, since *I* did build the SMC install from source myself.    Maybe "system-wide" versus "personal install" would be a better distinction. 

Any thoughts about how to technically distinguish between these two types of setups?  A flag to ./configure on first build?  Something else?  

> BTW its now really easy to use pip for optional packages 


Awesome -- a very good step in the right direction!

Of course every software must be built from source at one point, possibly by your distributor ;-)

The easiest way would probably be to check if `$SAGE_ROOT` is writable by the current user. 

In fact, there are four different cases for the two independent choices:
* Private install (I have write permissions) vs. system-wide (I do not have write permissions)
* Build from source vs. using a pre-built binary
The issue here only depends on the first choice.
