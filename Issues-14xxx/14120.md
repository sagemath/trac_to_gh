There is no (easy) way to obtain the coefficient on the constant term for an element in the Laurent polynomial ring. This just adds a method `constant_coefficient()`.

I thought, I'd review this ticket.

The docstring claims that, if the number of inputs is less than the number of variables, all the remaining[trailing] variables would have their exponent set to zero. But, for some reason, the implementation (and hence the examples) raises a `TypeError`. 

IMHO, it would be nice to implement the behaviour suggested by the docstring. (of course, the other case, where no. of variables <= no. of inputs is being handled correctly.) 

And, could we also please document that multivariate laurent polynomials are not iterable, as implemented, by adding an example, before we get complaints "like" [this](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/14124). 

Building documentation, there is a warning, which is fairly easy to fix: I think the complaint is about the method `__call__` 

```
<autodoc>:0: WARNING: Block quote ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent.
```

---
Finally, that we are changing this file, one might as well go ahead and clean up all the codifications: self is almost never codified, for instance and such documentation stuff... 

The already extant method `cofficient()` would benefit from adding r: `r"""` just so that the `\frac` with backslash is picked up properly by Sphinx. There is a misspelt word in the Note that is already there too. (constnat...)

First off, thank you for doing the review.

Replying to [@KPanComputes](#comment%3A3):
> The docstring claims that, if the number of inputs is less than the number of variables, all the remaining[trailing] variables would have their exponent set to zero. But, for some reason, the implementation (and hence the examples) raises a `TypeError`.

I made it consistent with other multivariate polynomial rings, however I forgot to correct the doc. This is done. I've also added in two more methods for consistancy and changed the output of the iterator.

> And, could we also please document that multivariate laurent polynomials are not iterable, as implemented, by adding an example, before we get complaints "like" [this](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/14124). 

This does not make sense to me. They are iterable with this patch.

I do not get this with the revised patch.

> Finally, that we are changing this file, one might as well go ahead and clean up all the codifications: self is almost never codified, for instance and such documentation stuff... 

You are welcome to do so on another ticket. That is outside of the purview of this one. I did it in the methods this patch touches.

> The already extant method `cofficient()` would benefit from adding r: `r"""` just so that the `\frac` with backslash is picked up properly by Sphinx. There is a misspelt word in the Note that is already there too. (constnat...)

Fixed.

I meant more along the following lines: you cannot iterate through using slice notation: 

```
 sage: P.<x,y,z> = LaurentPolynomialRing(QQ)
 sage: f = (y^2 - x^9 - 7*x*y^3 + 5*x*y)*x^-3 + x*z; f
 -x^6 + x*z - 7*x^-2*y^3 + 5*x^-2*y + x^-3*y^2
 sage: f[6,0,0]
 -1
 sage:f[5:6]
 [snip]
 TypeError: Multivariate Laurent polynomials are not iterable
```

But, well, this does not even make sense, given the current implementation. So, I'll set this to positive review.
