From [this ask.sagemath question](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/2683/different-answers-with-gaunt):

```
sage: gaunt(1,1,1,0,1,-1)
0
sage: gaunt(int(1),int(1),int(1),int(0),int(1),int(-1))
1/2*sqrt(3)/sqrt(pi)
```
This can come up when iterating over `range` instead of `srange`, which should be supported behavior (in my opinion, anyway).  As far as I can tell, the only place this is an issue is

```
    bigL = (l_1 + l_2 + l_3) / 2
```
but you never know.

I'm putting this under "calculus" but that doesn't really feel right.
