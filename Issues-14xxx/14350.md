In the context of virtual species (see #14348), it is also possible to define multiplicative inverses of many species. This patch incorporates code to compute the cycle indices of these multiplicative inverse species and a __div__ method for cycle index series.

<a id='comment:4'></a>Nicolas,

__invert__ looks like it should be exactly what's needed here, but it doesn't seem to work; Sage doesn't seem to know to try to use it for __div__. My guess is that there's some additional step I'd need to take to tell Sage that CycleIndexSeriesRing now (usually) has division, but I'm not sure what that is. (For this purpose, is it likely to be a problem that not every element has a multiplicative inverse?)

Thanks again for your help!

I've renamed the cycle index multiplicative inversion method as __invert__ as per Nicolas' suggestion. However, I haven't been able to find a way to convince Sage to use this method on its own, so the patch still includes a thin _div_ method as well.

That usually works. I am not sure what his login is though; you might want to make a quick search
(in principle the list of login's in on trac's main web page, but I haven't found him there).

A private e-mail can increase the chances of success :-) In this case you probably want to send an e-mail on sage-combinat-devel for advertising your work.

You should use python3 syntax for raise:

```
raise ValueError("constant term must be non-zero")
```

you could avoid to define parent by using directly self.parent()

you should doctest the _div_ function
