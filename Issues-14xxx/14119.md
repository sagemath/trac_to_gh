Eric Rowland pointed out the following weird behavior with respect to import_statements.

```
sage: import_statements(digraphs)

from sage.graphs.digraph_generators import <sage.graphs.digraph_generators.DiGraphGenerators instance at 0x115bf4b00>

"Authors" is for author of a patch; you're already the reporter :-)

But

```
sage: import_statements(DiGraph)
from sage.graphs.digraph import DiGraph
```
so maybe that's okay?

A few things also give "class" instead of this, a few (colors) give dictionaries, and don't even try `copying` :-) (since `sage: print "%s"%copying` ends up printing the entire license statement).

---

Basically, we probably need a little more uniformity in that some things do not have a `__name__`.  That's what happens here.

```
sage: qepcad_formula.__module__
'sage.interfaces.qepcad'
sage: qepcad_formula
<sage.interfaces.qepcad.qepcad_formula_factory instance at 0x103b37290>
```
So this might need a bit more work than just fixing one thing.


---

I also note that this doesn't actually return a string, but simply prints the imports and then returns `None`.  I don't know if I like that.

In a vanilla 5.12.beta2, I get

```
sage: import_statements(digraphs)
from sage.graphs.digraph_generators import digraphs
sage: import_statements(colors)
from sage.plot.colors import colors
sage: import_statements(qepcad_formula)
from sage.interfaces.qepcad import qepcad_formula
sage: import_statements(DiGraph)
from sage.graphs.digraph import DiGraph
```
which is perfectly ok.

So let me close this as invalid/wontfix
