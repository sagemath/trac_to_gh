Sage is missing some simple-to-implement but useful vector operations that Mathematica has (http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/guide/OperationsOnVectors.html), such as computing the angle between vectors, projection, and computing the distance between two vectors using various measures.

Component: **linear algebra**
