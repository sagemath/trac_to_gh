When creating free and finitely presented groups, default variable names are often ugly.

```
sage: F = FreeGroup(12)
sage: F
Free Group on generators {x0, x1, x2, x3, x4, x5, x6, x7, x8, x9, x10, x11}
sage: F/[F([1,2,2,1,1,4,7,-8]),F([10,10,4,-5,4,-8]) ] 
Finitely presented group < x0, x1, x2, x3, x4, x5, x6, x7, x8, x9, x10, x11 | x0*x1^2*x0^2*x3*x6*x7^-1, x9^2*x3*x4^-1*x3*x7^-1 >
```

Created by a utility function, the simple generator in this patch provides an easy way to consistently generate better variable names, and will be useful in creating free groups algorithmically.

1.

```
Utility method to create generator for free group variable names,
for use when creating free groups of dynamic size.
```
"generator" has two meanings here (and I confused the two).  Better:

```
Return a generator object that produces names suitable for the
generators of a free group.
```

2.  And, `flag` as a keyword name is totally uninformative.  Use something with some meaning.  Help the reader.  I'd suggest `zeros=False`.

3.  `seed` is not a seed.  It is a counter.  Call it `count` or `i` or something else.

4.  Do you really need to import "string" and use the `lowercase` array?  The usual idiom is:

```
chr(ord('a') + ind)
```
I guess this one is a toss-up.

5.  `while (True):` does not need parentheses.

6.  Include an EXAMPLE doctest that shows a higher iteration through the alphabet,  maybe show

```
ls = [test.next() for i in range(3*26)]
ls[2*26:3*26]
```
You can break the long list of output in the middle at whitespace and the test will succeed.

7.  The doctest in the TESTS section is great as is, though you could put both outputs on one line:

```
ls[234], ls[260]
```
and get a pair as the output.  Just more concise.

8.  Changing `flag` inside your if/else on `flag` is very confusing.  How about

```
if mwrap == 0 and not(zeros):
    name=''
else:
    name = str(mwrap)
```
and you can drop the line initializing `name`.
