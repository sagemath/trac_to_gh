The !__call!__ methods on flint-based polynomial types currently simply fall back to the generic Polynomial.!__call!__ for any nonconstant input. This is a most silly thing to do since flint has very fast code for polynomial composition.

Specifically, the !__call!__ methods in  Polynomial_integer_dense_flint, Polynomial_rational_flint, Polynomial_zmod_flint should use fmpz_poly_compose, fmpq_poly_compose or nmod_poly_compose when the output is of the appropriate type.

Keywords: **flint, polynomials**
