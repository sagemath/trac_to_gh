Method to construct finitely generated abelian groups as quotients of free groups. User inputs a list of integers to define an abelian group, then the invariants of the input list are used to build the group as a finite presentation.

```
sage:groups.presentation.FGAbelian([2,2])
Finitely presented group < a, b | a^2, b^2, a^-1*b^-1*a*b >
sage: groups.presentation.FGAbelian([6,3,5,17])
Finitely presented group < a, b | a^3, b^510, a^-1*b^-1*a*b >
```

Depends on #14791, which creates the "named" finitely presented groups infrastructure, and #14790 which
gives the python generator needed for variable names.

Hey,

One minor thing, instead of `\mathbb{Z}`, could you use `\ZZ` so Sage's documentation is consistent? Other than that, it looks good to me.

Best,
