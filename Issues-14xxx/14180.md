`clauses()` does not accept any input file, only a file to write **to** (?)

> * I do not get what this does... It's meant to store `is_xor` clauses but I don't get it `^^;`


CryptoMiniSat expresses xor clauses by prefixing them with an "x" and flipping the last clause if the right hand side if false.

> * I do not get this either

A `gens()` method needs doctstring, doctests etc. This way, everything is in place automatically. I added the alias `gens()` for `clauses()` because Sage users are used to `gens()` as the method to return the generators.

Oops right. I meant : when you read `self._tail`. The parsing only creates clauses with `is_xor` set to `False` :

```
clauses.append( ( tuple(clause), False, None ) )
```
Hence the output of `clauses` never returns a clause with `is_xor = True`.

Oh. But may it be because there is actually no way to create a xor clause with te DIMACS interface ?

> CryptoMiniSat expresses xor clauses by prefixing them with an "x" and flipping the last clause if the right hand side if false.


Oh. Weird. Thanks `:-)`

?

Well, why wouldn't you just write `gens = clauses` then ? `O_o`

Correct, only CryptoMiniSat does that.

If I do this in the base clase (`SatSolver`) it would point to the `clauses()` method in the base class which just raises `NotImplementedError`. So every subclass would have to redefine it it. This way (doing it in `__getattr__` means it is handled automatically.

Nonnoo, it's nothing that you added just there. Well, for a start it took me some time to realise that your `._tail` variable was actually your whole data. The place where you store everything. And you parse it each time you want to find out the list of clauses, which I don't like either. It nothing you added here, just "how this system is built".

Well. Storing RAM stuff in text file is what SWAP does, though.

Really ? This takes Gigabytes of clauses ? List of lists of integers ? `:-/`

How do the solver deal with them, then ? Do they work directly on the text files ? `O_o;;;`

Hmmmm... Looks like too much trouble if you always need to have them on a disk file anyway `:-/`

What would you think of this: you deal with everything in RAM, ad you only output it to a file when you want to actually solve it ? For Cryptominisat there is no problem as you directly deal with that solver's data structure.. But how do you work with other solvers ?
