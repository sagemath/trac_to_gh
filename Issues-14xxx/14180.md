`clauses()` does not accept any input file, only a file to write **to** (?)

> * I do not get what this does... It's meant to store `is_xor` clauses but I don't get it `^^;`

CryptoMiniSat expresses xor clauses by prefixing them with an "x" and flipping the last clause if the right hand side if false.

> * I do not get this either

A `gens()` method needs doctstring, doctests etc. This way, everything is in place automatically. I added the alias `gens()` for `clauses()` because Sage users are used to `gens()` as the method to return the generators.

Oops right. I meant : when you read `self._tail`. The parsing only creates clauses with `is_xor` set to `False` :

```
clauses.append( ( tuple(clause), False, None ) )
```
Hence the output of `clauses` never returns a clause with `is_xor = True`.

Oh. But may it be because there is actually no way to create a xor clause with te DIMACS interface ?

Oh. Weird. Thanks `:-)`

?

Well, why wouldn't you just write `gens = clauses` then ? `O_o`

Correct, only CryptoMiniSat does that.

If I do this in the base clase (`SatSolver`) it would point to the `clauses()` method in the base class which just raises `NotImplementedError`. So every subclass would have to redefine it it. This way (doing it in `__getattr__` means it is handled automatically.

Hellooooooooo again !!!

I read the patc anew, and this time I understood what I saw ! I am not a very big fan of your text files though, but well.. If it does the job for you `:-)`

Anyway this patch does its job, passes test, and can make it into Sage asap !

Replying to [@nathanncohen](#comment%3A12):
> I read the patch anew, and this time I understood what I saw ! I am not a very big fan of your text files though, but well.. If it does the job for you `:-)`

Can you elaborate on that? I could try to fix it (in another patch). Do you mean something with textfiles I just added or something that was in the DIMACS class before this patch? To explain the latter case: I didn't want to keep clauses in RAM because I routinely have problems with gigabytes of clauses.

Thanks!

Well. Storing RAM stuff in text file is what SWAP does, though.

Really ? This takes Gigabytes of clauses ? List of lists of integers ? `:-/`

How do the solver deal with them, then ? Do they work directly on the text files ? `O_o;;;`

Hmmmm... Looks like too much trouble if you always need to have them on a disk file anyway `:-/`
