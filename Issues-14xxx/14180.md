`clauses()` does not accept any input file, only a file to write **to** (?)

CryptoMiniSat expresses xor clauses by prefixing them with an "x" and flipping the last clause if the right hand side if false.

A `gens()` method needs doctstring, doctests etc. This way, everything is in place automatically. I added the alias `gens()` for `clauses()` because Sage users are used to `gens()` as the method to return the generators.

Oops right. I meant : when you read `self._tail`. The parsing only creates clauses with `is_xor` set to `False` :

```
clauses.append( ( tuple(clause), False, None ) )
```
Hence the output of `clauses` never returns a clause with `is_xor = True`.

Oh. But may it be because there is actually no way to create a xor clause with te DIMACS interface ?

> CryptoMiniSat expresses xor clauses by prefixing them with an "x" and flipping the last clause if the right hand side if false.


Oh. Weird. Thanks `:-)`

?

Well, why wouldn't you just write `gens = clauses` then ? `O_o`

If I do this in the base clase (`SatSolver`) it would point to the `clauses()` method in the base class which just raises `NotImplementedError`. So every subclass would have to redefine it it. This way (doing it in `__getattr__` means it is handled automatically.

Really ? This takes Gigabytes of clauses ? List of lists of integers ? `:-/`

How do the solver deal with them, then ? Do they work directly on the text files ? `O_o;;;`

The solvers of course deal with these clauses in RAM, I didn't want to have them in RAM twice though. Perhaps I should add an option to keep it in RAM (which would be default) and text files are used when explicitly asked for?
