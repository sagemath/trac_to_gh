Mixed intersections between Cones and Polyhedron returning a Polyhedron:

   ```
      sage: cone = Cone([(1,0), (-1,0), (0,1)])
      sage: p = polytopes.hypercube(2)
      sage: p & cone
      A 2-dimensional polyhedron in ZZ^2 defined as the convex hull of 3 vertices
   ```

In a similar direction, we extend the `Polyhedron` constructor so it can take various types as objects as input, for example:

```
        sage: H.<x,y> = HyperplaneArrangements(QQ)
        sage: h = x + y - 1; h
        Hyperplane x + y - 1
        sage: Polyhedron(h, base_ring=ZZ)
        A 1-dimensional polyhedron in ZZ^2 defined as the convex hull of 1 vertex and 1 line
        sage: Polyhedron(h)
```
