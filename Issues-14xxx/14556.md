Fair enough, but partially the reason for removal was that it was an undocumented fix. I really dislike "workarounds" without any reference to a ticket or clues what the problem is.

Indeed,

Weirdly, now as I try to reinstall the p1 spkg, I get the same problem! Of course, it doesn't show up on the screen, but in error.log it's there, and the `binary-ecl` folder has the same three files.

Is it possible we have to touch ecl first so that it upgrades when upgrading this?  I don't see why, but I'll try that next.
