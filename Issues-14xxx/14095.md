During Sara Billey's talk, it came up that not all of the Weyl group functionalities are available for the symmetric group:

- The symmetric group does not implement CartanType
- The Stanley symmetric function code uses the old fashionned W.unit() rather than W.one(). There might be some other occurences that should be cleaned up

Test case:

```
sage: G = SymmetricGroup(4)
sage: w = G.from_reduced_word([3,2,3,1])
sage: w.stanley_symmetric_function()
3*m[1, 1, 1, 1] + 2*m[2, 1, 1] + m[2, 2] + m[3, 1]
```
