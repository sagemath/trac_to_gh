A much better way is to create these 77 blocks by applying the Mathieu group M_22 to one block, directly.
Replace `s= [long long boring list]` by

```
s = MathieuGroup(22)._gap_().Orbit([1,2,3,7,10,20],"OnSets").sage()
```

This is a bit unfortunate that one needs to write such an ugly call, instead of just `MathieuGroup(22).orbit([1,2,3,7,10,20],"OnSets")`.
IMHO it's worth opening a ticket and fixing this, i.e. adding `"OnSets"` and other GAP options to the orbit method.

PS. How does one find the block? Well, take the pointwise stabilizer of 3 points, say, 1, 2, 3 in `MathieuGroup(22)` and compute its orbits on the 22 points the group acts naturally. Such a stabilizer is the stabilizer of two points, 1 and 2, in the projective plane of order 4 induced on 2,3,...,22.

that's due to a bug or a feature in #14291 : the action `"OnSets"` returns unsorted tuples. Attached 1-line patch fixes this; although I think that #14291 must be fixed, too.
