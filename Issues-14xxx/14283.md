<a id='comment:2'>**Comment 2:**</a>
A much better way is to create these 77 blocks by applying the Mathieu group M_22 to one block, directly.
Replace `s= [long long boring list]` by

```
s = MathieuGroup(22)._gap_().Orbit([1,2,3,7,10,20],"OnSets").sage()
```

This is a bit unfortunate that one needs to write such an ugly call, instead of just `MathieuGroup(22).orbit([1,2,3,7,10,20],"OnSets")`.
IMHO it's worth opening a ticket and fixing this, i.e. adding `"OnSets"` and other GAP options to the orbit method.

PS. How does one find the block? Well, take the pointwise stabilizer of 3 points, say, 1, 2, 3 in `MathieuGroup(22)` and compute its orbits on the 22 points the group acts naturally. Such a stabilizer is the stabilizer of two points, 1 and 2, in the projective plane of order 4 induced on 2,3,...,22. There is unique like on 1 and 2 in this plane, so you'll see an orbit of length 3 that you need to add to 1, 2, 3 to get the block (this is the unique block on the 3 points 1, 2, 3).

regarding Mathieu groups and Witt designs, there is e.g. a chapter "Three lectures on exceptional groups" in Conway & Sloan "Sphere Packings, Lattices and Groups". There are many more places where this stuff  can be found, though. E.g. here: http://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/2WF02/Witt.pdf

By the way, there are more distance-transitive graphs which can be constructed from blocks of these designs. See [loc.cit.] and

that's due to a bug or a feature in #14291 : the action `"OnSets"` returns unsorted tuples. Attached 1-line patch fixes this; although I think that #14291 must be fixed, too.
