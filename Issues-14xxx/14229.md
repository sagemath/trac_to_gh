Sometimes solve and its variants tend to report vacuous solutions. A recent one from [ask.sagemath](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/2324/how-to-print-out-maxima-commands-being-used-by) is the following:

```
sage: x,y = var('x,y')
sage: solve([x^2*y^2 <= x^2*y, x^2*y^2 > x^2*y],[x,y])
[[x == 0, 1 < y, 0 != 0], [x == 0, y < 0, 0 != 0]]
```

Shouldn't we remove these meaningless solutions? The attached patch contains a potential solution. If it seems reasonable, then similar changes could be introduced in `solve_ineq`.

The output of the above command after this patch is as expected:

```
sage: x,y = var('x,y')
sage: solve([x^2*y^2 <= x^2*y, x^2*y^2 > x^2*y],[x,y])
[]
```

If you can translate this to maxima proper, please feel free to do so and submit a patch upstream.

---
**Workaround**: call `maxima_calculus("domain: real")` before `solve` (see comment 12).

Helloooooooo !!

You remove equations that do not contain a variable, but couldn't `0=0` appear from time to time ? Secondly, can't the expression "bool(solution_list)" be costly from time to time ?

You could also write, later in the patch

```
sol_list = filter(_test_solution, string_to_list_of_solutions(repr(s)))
```

These vacuous solutions seem to arise from the fact that solving inequalities with `domain: complex` gives some problems, which is to be expected. So rather than trying to clean up the mess afterwards, we should find a way of setting `domain: real` in maxima before solving inequalities:

```
sage: sage: x,y = var('x,y')
sage: maxima_calculus("domain: real")
real
sage: sage: solve([x^2*y^2 <= x^2*y, x^2*y^2 > x^2*y],[x,y])
[]
```

One may be concerned with performance when we have to set these flags all the time. On the expect interface that's probably silly anyway, and on the library interface we can reach a little deeper and save some time:

```
sage: maxima_calculus(1) # make sure maxima_lib is initialized
sage: from sage.libs.ecl import EclObject,ecl_eval
sage: set_complex=ecl_eval("(defun sc () (setf $DOMAIN '$COMPLEX))")
sage: set_real=ecl_eval("(defun sc () (setf $DOMAIN '$REAL))")
sage: %timeit set_complex()
100000 loops, best of 3: 2.14 µs per loop
sage: %timeit maxima_calculus("domain: complex")
10000 loops, best of 3: 146 µs per loop
```
For comparison:

```
sage: %timeit solve([x<y],[x,y])
100 loops, best of 3: 4.6 ms per loop
```
so I think we can afford a little `set_real.eval(); ...solve iquality; set_complex.eval();`. We could keep a flag on what we set last and be lazy with flipping, but I expect that solving inequalities is relatively rare, and always slow, so we shouldn't slow down other operations with testing for a flag. To give you an idea, the following does call into maxima:

```
sage: %timeit integrate(x,x)
1000 loops, best of 3: 693 us per loop
```

So do you think this should be done in the Sage `solve` function when it detects inequalities?
