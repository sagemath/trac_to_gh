As the title says, this patch implements a data structure atop of the current "static sparse graphs" which can be used as a backend for a Sage Graph. Smaller in memory, and faster.

```
sage: g = graphs.CompleteGraph(400)                                 
sage: gi = Graph(g,data_structure="static_sparse")
sage: %timeit g.edges()                                             
1 loops, best of 3: 512 ms per loop
sage: %timeit gi.edges()
10 loops, best of 3: 30.3 ms per loop
```

The patch : 

* Creates a new sage.graphs.base.static_sparse_backend modules containing two classes, StaticSparseCGraph and StaticSparseBackend, as it is done for the current sparse/dense backends.
* Updates the static_sparse_graph data structure to handle labels
* Updates the constructors of Graph and DiGraph by renaming the ``sparse`` keyword to ``data_structure`` which can now be set to ``sparse,dense`` or ``static_sparse`` (and others later)
* Deals with the consequences of renaming the keyword, i.e. changes doctests everywhere in the graph/ files, and into some other files of Sage too.

I tested this patch in many many ways, and in particular by adding at the end of graph/digraph `__init__` method the following two lines:
* (if the backend is not static) build a copy of self using a static backend
* Check that both are equal, and otherwise scream in panic

This being said, many graph methods will break when the backend is static. The most obvious ones are add/remove vertex/edges, but other methods will break which supposed that any graph can be modified. For methods which do not modify the graph itself, this happens when it creates a temporary copy of it (which will use the same backend), and feel free to change that one.

I don't see an automatic way to spot them, I don't think it is very bad as this static backend is a new feature and hence will not break any existing code, and this patch is already very long (and hard to review) as it is `^^;`

* Its either "Thou shalt not add a vertex to an immutable graph!"
  (Shakespeare) or "cannot add vertex to an immutable graph"
  (Python). In particular, lower case and no exclamation mark at the
  end ;)

* Methods that fail due to being immutable should raise `ValueError`,
  not `NotImplementedError` (are you going to implement it in the
  future?)

* It would be nice if INPUT/OUTPUT were consistent and would actually
  list all arguments, for example (though there are many more)
  `StaticSparseBackend.degree` does not document the "directed"
  argument.

* static_sparse_backend module docstring "Two classes" names the same
  class twice.

* StaticSparseCGraph docstring: ":mod:`CGraph
  <sage.graphs.base.c_graph>` class over :mod:`static sparse graphs
  <sage.graphs.base.static_dense_graph>`". I don't know what thats
  supposed to mean.

* The Python special `__copy__()` method does not allow any
  arguments. In particular, `copy(graph)` should return a mutable copy
  if the original `graph` is immutable.

* Having to write `data_structure="sparse"` is a lot less intuitive
  than the old `sparse=True`. It would be better to allow for both
  and raise a `ValueError` if both are changed from their default
  values.

Hello !

I obviously chosed the "Thou shalt not add a vertex to an immutable graph".

I change my mind so often that I wouldn't put it beyond reach. But just to please you I fixed it `:-P`

Well, I defined the "INPUT" where it was not, but usually the outputs are pretty clear... Not to mention that those are rather meant to Sage developpers.

It's a poetic license.

That it uses static sparse graphs as a data structure. By the way, the link and the name did not match. I rephrased it.

There were arguments there before I learnt that Sage existed, and it is because this method can also be used through `G.copy(whatever)`. This being said, I don't see why one should get a mutable graph as a copy of an immutable one. Copying a tuple certainly does not make it a list, and it would produce rather unexpected behaviour `O_o`

You have no idea how many hours I wasted on that. Unfortunately, you are right. I reversed those modifications and both keywords can now be used.

Patch updated !

Hello! 

As promised I peeked at the code!! In general the patch looks good to me with the exception of the above comments.


* Can we use xrange instead of range when we only iterate over something?

* Can we raise a ValeError in  *'in_neighbors* if u is not in the graph as to be consistent with how out_degree works? 

* In the function **iterator_in_edges** why do we need the call to iter in the following line ?

```
            for x in iter(self.iterator_out_edges(vertices, labels)): 

```

Cython detects "for i in range(n)" loops and replaces them with a C loop. So there is no point in using xrange.

Volker beat me to this one.

`T_T`

You are right. Fixed.
