I started looking at it but hit a build issue with sage-5.9.  I
noticed a few little things:

- the examples should be indented 4 more spaces

- typo in this line: "   - *vol* -- The volatilitry "

- space after "vol," here: def black_scholes(spot_price,
strike_price, time_to_maturity, risk_free_rate, vol,opt_type): "

- delete blank line 11

- I think the input lines should have a single backtick around
variable names, not 2 single quotes.

- delete blank line 43

- give a reference for the formula you're using

- are there generalizations you plan to implement later?

- why should somebody believe the examples you give?  Are they
replicating some examples elsewhere (e.g., on a wikipedia page)?

>  - give a reference for the formula you're using
 
I'm using the Black-Scholes formula from a textbook called Stochastic Calculus for Finance II, by Steven Shreve, which is equivalent to the one found on wikipedia. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black%E2%80%93Scholes#Black.E2.80.93Scholes_formula
\\\\

Could you elaborate just a little more on this? I do plan on implementing functionality that allows for using different underlying distributions. 
\\\\
>  - why should somebody believe the examples you give?  Are they
 
> replicating some examples elsewhere (e.g., on a wikipedia page)?
The following  are two examples using the Black-Sholes formula in Matlab. We'll compare them to the results of the black_scholes function presented in the patch examples. I think this will show that my examples are precise to at least 4 digits to the right of the decimal point.\\\\
	
The Black-Scholes formula in matlab uses the following syntax:  [Call, Put] = blsprice(Price, Strike, Rate, Time, Volatility).
\\\\
## Example 1
In this example the underlying stock has a price of $42, the strike price is $40, the time to maturity is 6 months = 0.5 years. The risk-free rate is 10%, and the volatility is 20%.\\\\
In Matlab:

```
>> [call,put] = blsprice(42,40,0.1,0.5,0.2)

call =

    4.7594


put =

    0.8086
```

\\
Let's compare this with black_scholes in Sage:

```
sage: finance.black_scholes(42, 40, 0.5, 0.1, 0.2, 'call')
4.759422392871532
sage: finance.black_scholes(42, 40, 0.5, 0.1, 0.2, 'put')
0.8085993729000958 
```
\\\\
## Example 2
In this example the underlying stock has a price of $100, the strike price is $95, the time to maturity is 3 months = 0.25 years.
The risk-free rate is 10%, and the volatility is 50%.\\\\
In Matlab:

```
>> [call,put] = blsprice(100,95,0.1,0.25,0.5)

call =

   13.6953


put =

    6.3497
```
\\
Let's compare this with black_scholes in Sage:

```
sage: finance.black_scholes(100, 95, 0.25, 0.1, 0.5, 'call')
13.695272738608132
sage: finance.black_scholes(100, 95, 0.25, 0.1, 0.5, 'put')
6.349714381299734
```
