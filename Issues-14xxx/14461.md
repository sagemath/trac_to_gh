Change the method cardinality in the class StandardTableaux_size

Before:

```
sage: timeit('StandardTableaux(8).cardinality()')
125 loops, best of 3: 3.53 ms per loop
sage: timeit('StandardTableaux(10).cardinality()')
125 loops, best of 3: 7.58 ms per loop
sage: timeit('StandardTableaux(12).cardinality()')
25 loops, best of 3: 15.5 ms per loop
```

With the patch:

```
sage: timeit('StandardTableaux(8).cardinality()') 
625 loops, best of 3: 119 µs per loop
sage: timeit('StandardTableaux(10).cardinality()')
625 loops, best of 3: 136 µs per loop
sage: timeit('StandardTableaux(12).cardinality()')
625 loops, best of 3: 153 µs per loop
sage: timeit('StandardTableaux(50).cardinality()')
625 loops, best of 3: 642 µs per loop
```

Hey,

Could you make the following changes:

- describe the algorithm that you are using the doc,
- add a test to show that your computation agrees with the constructed number (for some smaller `n` than 50 of course),
- put your (real) name in the trac authors section.

Thanks,

Travis

Here is a new version of my patch with tests. Sorry, I'm not a native speaker and this would my first contribution.

Instead of using hook formula on every shape of Young tableau my algorithm counts the number of involution of size n which are in bijection with standard tableau of size n.

Sage seems do be limited around size 35 :

```
sage: timeit('StandardTableaux(35).cardinality()')
5 loops, best of 3: 5.83 s per loop
```

With the patch

```
sage: timeit('StandardTableaux(35).cardinality()')         
625 loops, best of 3: 390 µs per loop
```

Hey Gregory,

This is a great speedup, and I was surprised that involutions, or at least counting them, is not currently in Sage (there must surely be a ticket for this...). Anyways, I've uploaded a review patch which adds the description of the cardinality. If you are happy with the changes, feel free to set this to positive review.

Best,

Travis

In case you are unaware, to check you should apply my review patch after yours, run `sage -b`, then run `sage -docbuild reference/combinat html` and look at your (local) documentation. Feel free to ask me questions if you need to.
