Hi Nathann!

Review patch uploaded.  I don't think it will be controversial.  I removed one line of code which did nothing useful.  (Please confirm.)

The commit message on the original patch should be, um, more descriptive.  Other than that, I am ready to give it a positive review if you approve my changes.  

What a nice algorithm!

The same approach could be used to find all that longest common subwords.  Do you think that would be useful?  To me it seems at least as natural.  

cheers,

Hugh

Hmmmm. Well,  the same algorithm with the same complexity can return the number of longest common subwords too. In order to return all longest subwords, though, one would have to keep track of all `l[i,j]`, and not just `l[i,j]` and `l[i-1,j]`.

This way you make sure that you are not building and maintaining very long lists of words which you would throw away later `:-)`

There is one :

sage/combinat/words/word_datatypes.pyx

Code that goes there will apply only for words on specific data type (like list, tuple, str). If a method exists in the cython file and in the `finite_word.py` file, the cython method is called instead.

I would be curious to know what is the gain... tell me if your test it.
