Hellooooooooooooooooooooooooooo Alexandre !!!

Would it be possible to use the `disjoint_union` method instead of copying most of its code ? Looks like what you have to do is just build the disjoint union then add the missing edges, don't you ?

Hello!!

You are correct that I used the same code for relabeling (for conciseness), since I do not see how to know which vertices come from which graph without actually recalculating the labels. Unfortunately I ended up duplicating code...
Now that I am thinking about it, I believe a good solution is to create a helper function to calculate the labels and use this function both in disjoint_union and in join.

What do you think?
(And what should I do? Is there a way to replace the attached patch or should I post a new attachment?)

Hello!!

I have done the modifications you suggested and posted a new patch.
For me, this new behavior of disjoint_union is very reasonable and seems much easier to understand.

Helloooooooo Alexandre !

Thank you very much for implementing that. I just wrote a small reviewer's patch with superficial fixes. There are some weird rules like "don't add spaces at the end of a line" that we try to respect, and I also added links from one methods to the others.

If you agree with those changes, you can set the ticket to `positive_review` !

Hello!!

I agree with the changes and liked very much the SEEALSO part -- I see there is a lot for me to learn.

However, there is something strange on the documentation now. The explanation for the "verbose_label" parameter is broken into two paragraphs when I generate it locally. Is that expected? Could it be a problem on my end?

Just clarifying a bit, on the join documentation the text reads "... each vertex v in<new paragraph>the first graph will..." and on the disjoint_union "... If True, each<new paragraph>vertex v...".
