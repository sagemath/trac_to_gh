In the following, the user specified aspect ratio is currently ignored:

```
    sage: p = sphere()
    sage: p.aspect_ratio([10,1,1])
    sage: p.show()
```

The attached patch is but a proof-of-concept of solution. I don't know well enough the plot code to see if this is the right thing to do.

Hi,

I wanted to test this patch but unfortunately I already failed applying the patch to the latest stable version (5.11). I get

```
sage: hg_sage.apply("/home/xyz/trac_14223-fix_3d_aspect_ratio.patch")
cd "/usr/local/sage-5.0.1/devel/sage" && sage --hg import   "/home/tobi/Sync/Projekte/SageDev_linestyle/review_aspect/trac_14223-fix_3d_aspect_ratio.patch"
applying /home/xyz/trac_14223-fix_3d_aspect_ratio.patch
abort: failed to synchronize metadata for "sage/plot/plot3d/base.pyx"
```

Being rather inexperienced it might well be that it is my mistake (especially as the patchbot seems to be ok with the patch). Do I have to apply it to the latest pre-release? Or do you have any other ideas what's wrong?

I can apply it to sage-5.12beta4. The aspect ratio comes out correct - see [this plot](http://i.imgur.com/cylVkcR.jpg).

Also, the patch applies correctly.

Hi Basu,

here my remarks on the patch. It applies perfectly and in almost all cases which I tested it fixes the bug. I only found the following case, where setting the aspect ratio seems still to be ignored:


```
var('x,y')
P=plot3d(x^2-9*y^2,(x,-3,3),(y,-1,1))
P.aspect_ratio((1,1,1))
P.show()
```

is different from

```
var('x,y')
P=plot3d(x^2-9*y^2,(x,-3,3),(y,-1,1))
P.show(aspect_ratio=(1,1,1))
```

furthermore I observed that by this patch

```
P.show(aspect_ratio=(1,2,3))
```
changes the value of

```
P._aspect_ratio
```
and thus also the behaviour in all following show() commands. One can surely discuss if this is usefull or not, but I think in the 2d plots the setting of aspect ration in a show command only affects this plot and not the following. I think the 3d behavior should be consistent.

Hi!

Thanks for fixing these issues. All the problems which I reported above are indeed fixed. 

I'm sorry to come up with another one: 

The problem occurs if one has plots, with very different axes scales e.g. 

```
var('x,y')
P=plot3d(x^2-100*y^2,(x,-10,10),(y,-1,1))
```
Without the patch the aspect ratio was automatically chosen such that all axes are equally long, if the user didn't set the aspect ratio. Now the aspect is automatically 1 which produces very degenerate plots, where one cannot see much. The user has thus to adjust the ration manually which seems a drawback to me. 

As far as I understand in my limited view the problem is the following:

-the default value of self.aspect_ratio() is (1,1,1)
-the default show option for aspect ratio is 'automatic'
-before it has been ignored if self.aspect_ratio() has been set manually and if there was no aspect ratio argument in show(), now the show argument aspect_ratio='automatic' is ignored and instead self.aspect_ratio() is taken. I the user didn't change anything, this is however equal to (1,1,1) and produces a different result. 

I'm not sure how to fix this, but here some ideas which might hopefully be helpful. Is it maybe possible, that the default value of self.aspect_ratio() is 'automatic'? Then there would be no degenerate plots if the user doesn't change anything.
But even then we would have a problem: If the user sets the aspect by 
`self.aspect_ratio((1,2,3))` 
and later wants a plot with the automatic aspect ratio
`P.show(aspect_ratio='automatic')`
then this would again be ignored. Wouldn't it accordingly be also necessary to set the SHOW_DEFAULT of aspect_ratio to None??? If the show option aspect_ratio is None, we replace it by `self.aspect_ratio()` which is be default "automatic". This would allow to distinguish between no user input and the input 'automatic' but still return the automatic aspect_ration if the user does nothing at all.

Attachment: **[trac_14223-fix_3d_aspect_ratio.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket14223/trac_14223-fix_3d_aspect_ratio.patch.gz)**

Ok. I updated the patch and also fixed this bug:

```
sage: show(cube(), frame_aspect_ratio=1)
...
TypeError: 'sage.rings.integer.Integer' object is not iterable
```

The inconsistency in [comment:12](#comment%3A12) remains, but it can not be reliably fixed.
We can check for `aspect_ratio=[1.0,1.0,1.0]` in addition to
`aspect_ratio='automatic'`, but then a small change in `aspect_ratio`, for
example, `aspect_ratio=[1.1, 1.0, 1.0]` will again lead to inconsistency in
the computation of `frame_aspect_ratio`.

Sorry it took some days until I was able to have a closer look.

Everything except the inconsistency you mention works fine now. Also some other test produced the expected outcome.

Additionally I was playing Patchbot on my system and tested against 5.12beta3:

-patch applies without errors

-source builds without errors

-patch doesn't provoke any errors for a full doctest

-reference builds without problems and the changes lead to reasonable output

So there seems no reason not to give a positive review...
