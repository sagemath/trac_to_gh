I like the idea. Can we get some data on speed regressions due to this? In principle the double lookup might be noticeable. I don't mean speed regressions due to parents getting deleted -- those are good to know but need other fixes. I mean when the parents are still around.

Attached doctests may need #12313 to work, in which case this ticket should depend on that (because then that's necessary to get benefit from this ticket).

Sadly, the performance hit is quite noticeable.

```
a=ZZ(1)
b=QQ(1)
c=ZZ['x'](1)
d=b+c

def test(x,y):
  for i in xrange(10^6):
    _=x+y
```
Within a run, timing `test` seems fairly consistent. However, between different compiles of the same code I'm observing fluctuations of up to `0.10s` in timings. Lucky/unlucky memory layout?
Anyway, with patch:

```
sage: %time test(a,b)
CPU times: user 2.15 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 2.15 s
Wall time: 2.16 s
sage: %time test(a,c)
CPU times: user 2.25 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 2.25 s
Wall time: 2.26 s
sage: %time test(b,c)
CPU times: user 16.83 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 16.83 s
```
without patch

```
sage: %time test(a,b)
CPU times: user 1.54 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 1.54 s
Wall time: 1.55 s
sage: %time test(a,c)
CPU times: user 1.64 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 1.64 s
Wall time: 1.64 s
CPU times: user 15.68 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 15.68 s
Wall time: 15.76 s
```
For `test(a,a)`, `test(b,b)`, `test(c,c)` there doesn't seem to be a difference (luckily!)

The penalties seem to be about `0.6s`, `0.6s`, `1.2s`, which is rather consistent with 1,1,2 extra lookups.

This indicates to me it may be worth trying storing a weakref to the morphism instead, since that can probably be dereferenced faster than a coercion lookup on the codomain. Logically this should be equivalent. We're just storing a weakref to the object we're interested in rather than instructions where to go and lookup the object we want.

Caveat:

For stored coercions of the type
`(R,S, ...): (None,<map S->R>)`
or
`(R,S, ...): (<map R->S>,None)`
the codomain is part of the key, so deletion of the codomain (which is a prerequisite for the morphism being deleted and hence the weakref dying) implies removal of the weak key entry in `TripleDict`.

However, for stored coercions of the type
`(R,S,...): (<map R->C>,<map S->C>)`
we could have that `C` and the weakrefs to the morphisms die, but that would not trigger the removal from the `TripleDict`. So we could still encounter dead weakrefs (but much less than one would perhaps initially think!) It's not really much different from how [attachment:14058-weak-binop.patch] handles dead weakrefs.

Major problem for immediately applying this idea:

```
sage: M=QQ.coerce_map_from(ZZ)
sage: import weakref
sage: weakref.ref(M)
TypeError: cannot create weak reference to 'sage.rings.rational.Z_to_Q' object
```

In vanilla Sage, the coercion model stores (coercion) morphisms in its cache (which was a `TripleDict`, hence, with weak keys), and the only change introduced by your patch is to store weak references to the (coercion) morphism instead. Did I understand this correctly?

In vanilla Sage, the coercion model kept a strong reference to the morphism, which kept a strong reference to domain and codomain, which were thus not reclaimable, and so the item of the `TripleDict` has eternal life, in spite of the weak keys. Correct?

With the patch, the coercion model keeps a weak reference to the coercion morphism, hence, the strong reference from the morphism to domain and codomain doesn't matter, and thus the item of the `TripleDict` may disappear.

But how is the morphism kept alive? The coercion model only has a weak reference to it. Do I understand correctly that the morphism involved in the binary operation is, at the same time, stored in the coerce dict of its codomain? That's why it does not immediately die?

In other words, do I understand that the layout is as follows? We have parents A and B, and want to apply some binary operator, with a result in the parent C (C may coincide with either A or B). And we have maps r_A and r_B from A or B to C.

Both r_A and r_B are stored with a strong reference in a cache located in C, with weak keys A and B. At the same time, they are stored with a weak reference in the coercion model, again with weak keys A and B. r_A has strong references to C and to A, r_B has strong references to C and to B.

What do we want? Do we want that keeping C alive makes A and B survive? Or do we want that keeping both A and B alive makes C survive?

If the user has a strong reference to C, then C has a strong reference to r_A and r_B (in its coerce cache), and r_A/r_B strongly refers to A/B. Hence, the existence of C keeps A and B alive. Since C is a complicated object, it is more likely to be mortal, hence, probably it is not much of a problem.

If the user has a strong reference to both A and B, then C keeps a strong reference to both r_A and r_B, and the coercion model keeps a weak reference to r_A and r_B. Moreover, r_A and r_B strongly refer to C.

However, isn't it just a reference cycle between C and r_A/r_B? It would not prevent C from becoming collectable, right?

I doubt that we want that. It is not desirable that, when adding elements of `ZZ['x']` and QQ, the ring `QQ['x']` is created repeatedly (OK, polynomial rings have a strong cache anyway. But you see what I mean).

Or did I misunderstand something?

In this scenario:

```
P=[ZZ['x%d'%i] for i in [1..1000]]
F=[GF(p) for p in prime_range(1000)]
for Zxi in P:
    for k in F:
        a=P.0
        b=F(1)

If we keep the `GF(p)[xi]` alive because at some point we constructed an element in it from parents that are still around, we've just created quadratic memory requirements where linear should be enough.

I don't think that we can afford to assume that just because a user has combined two parents he/she will do so again in the future. We may be able to afford doing so if it happened *recently*, but that really is an optimisation, and currently I don't see a hook where we can do this efficiently.

I do believe that this is *not* desired behaviour.

Granted. But it is a very typical usage to *not* explicitly convert everything into a common parent, but let the coercion model do the work. That is what the coercion model is for!

>  I suspect that usually that will be the case, because if a user creates elements somewhere regularly he probably


However, in the example that I posted above, note that multiplying `OA(1)*OB(1)` repeatedly will also create `C()` *repeatedly*, even though it is a `UniqueRepresentation` and hence (weakly, nowadays) cached!

I think it is not acceptable that a multiple creation is triggered.

In your example, `GF(p)[xi]` is created exactly once, for each value of p and i. Clearly, in this situation it would not make sense to keep it alive, because it is never reused. However, I doubt that this is a typical use case.

OK, but not all unique parent structures rely on it.

By the way, it seems that the "insufficient" caching (not enough to keep C() alive) has no influence on performance, at least not if computations are done in a close cycle:

```

sage: OA = A()
sage: OB = B()
sage: a = OA(1)
sage: b = OB(1)
sage: def test(x,y):
....:     for _ in xrange(2*10^5):
....:         z = x*y
....:         
sage: %time test(a,a)
CPU times: user 4.49 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 4.49 s
Wall time: 4.49 s
sage: %time test(a,b)
CPU times: user 8.99 s, sys: 0.11 s, total: 9.11 s
Wall time: 9.13 s
sage: c = a*b
sage: print c.parent()
C
sage: %time test(a,b)
CPU times: user 8.85 s, sys: 0.03 s, total: 8.88 s
Wall time: 8.89 s
```

In the first run of test(a,b), there is the possibility that `parent(a*b)` becomes created repeatedly, as I have demonstrated above. In the second run, `parent(a*b)` is kept alive, by keeping a pointer to the result of `a*b`. There is no significant difference in performance. Of course, we also see that multiplication within one parent is faster.

Is there a way to get the patchbots report significant regressions in some examples? Because I am sure that some parts of Sage (schemes and combinat are typical candidates) rely on a strong coercion cache.

Ah right, because `C._coerce_from_hash[A]._codomain is C`, there's a cycle involving C so instead of getting deleted eagerly by Python's refcounting, it's only done with (relatively infrequent) GCs. So it even comes with a trick to improve this free "caching": Increase the interval for garbage collection. See `gc.get_threshold` and `gc.set_threshold`. By tweaking those numbers you can probably manipulate the running times in these examples.

**NOTE:** Doesn't `timeit` turn garbage collection off? So that may be a misleading tool for investigating performance for these things.

I think it makes sense to ask [sage-devel](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/sage-devel/7FCHou9nkIg) whether it is better to fix this leak or not.

I believe that keeping A and B alive should prevent C from garbage collection. In contrast, keeping C alive should *not* prevent A and B from garbage collection.

I did make ptest with a highly patched debug version of sage-5.7.beta2. Hence, I have the dependencies of #13864 and additionally #9107, #12951, #13916. #12313, #14058 and #13370 applied.

In the parallel test, I got two timeouts, namely in devel/sage/doc/en/bordeaux_2008/birds_other.rst and devel/sage/sage/interfaces/maxima.py. Running the former individually is long, but fine:

```
sage -t -force_lib "devel/sage/doc/en/bordeaux_2008/birds_other.rst"
         [339.8 s]
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
Total time for all tests: 339.9 seconds
```

However, the maxima test is suspicious. I ran it twice individually. The first time I got an evil error:

The following tests failed:

and the second time I got

Is the error something we should worry about? Or is that likely to be the effect of a neutrino hitting my laptop?

Lost track again.

I tried to import the patches and turn them into git branches. It mostly worked, but I had to resolve some conflicts with the second patch.

Would it be OK to change this hg-ticket into a git-ticket?

While I had to resolve conflicts when importing the two patches into the git master branch, the patches do apply to sage-5.12.beta5, and the patchbot reports the same on sage-5.13.beta2. So, perhaps it is OK to keep this a mercurial ticket.

However, with the gitification of the patches, I find (similar to the patchbot)

```
sage -t --long /mnt/storage2TB/patchbot/Sage/sage-5.13.beta2/devel/sage/sage/rings/polynomial/plural.pyx  # 17 doctests failed
sage -t --long /mnt/storage2TB/patchbot/Sage/sage-5.13.beta2/devel/sage/sage/libs/singular/function.pyx  # 1 doctest failed
```
The patchbot additionally finds

```
sage -t --long /mnt/storage2TB/patchbot/Sage/sage-5.13.beta2/devel/sage/sage/algebras/free_algebra.py  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t --long /mnt/storage2TB/patchbot/Sage/sage-5.13.beta2/devel/sage/sage/structure/coerce.pyx  # 1 doctest failed
```
So, this requires some work.

Here is a branch. The merge was not trivial, so, hopefully I did it well.

Next, we have to see if the "old problem" (i.e., attachment:testcoercion.py) is still problematic, and of course there may be doctest failures.

At least, the issue from [comment:20](#comment%3A20) is solved: We do have weak references to the domain of coercion maps now.

Sigh. #13447 is not fixed, as the following example shows.

```
sage: import gc
sage: _ = gc.collect()
sage: from sage.rings.polynomial.multi_polynomial_libsingular import MPolynomialRing_libsingular
sage: from sage.libs.singular.groebner_strategy import GroebnerStrategy
sage: n = len([x for x in gc.get_objects() if isinstance(x,MPolynomialRing_libsingular)])
sage: P = MPolynomialRing_libsingular(GF(541), 2, ('x', 'y'), TermOrder('degrevlex', 2))
sage: strat = GroebnerStrategy(Ideal([P.gen(0) + P.gen(1)]))
sage: del strat
sage: del P
sage: _ = gc.collect()
sage: n == len([x for x in gc.get_objects() if isinstance(x,MPolynomialRing_libsingular)])
False
```

I'd suggest to proceed as follows. Provided that all tests pass, I can review Robert's and Nils' patches, someone else reviews my additions (which are the merging and the latest commit), and then we make this a dependency for #13447.

Sometimes, the following test in sage/categories/fields.py has failed:

```
            sage: import gc
            sage: _ = gc.collect()
            sage: n = len([X for X in gc.get_objects() if isinstance(X, sage.rings.finite_rings.integer_mod_ring.IntegerModRing_generic)])
            sage: for i in prime_range(100):
            ....:     R = ZZ.quotient(i)
            ....:     t = R in Fields()
            sage: _ = gc.collect()
            sage: len([X for X in gc.get_objects() if isinstance(X, sage.rings.finite_rings.integer_mod_ring.IntegerModRing_generic)]) - n
            1
```
The reason for the failure: Sometimes the last line gave 0, not 1. It is not totally clear to me why the different results occurred. But in fact 0 is better than 1 here (one additional ring got collected). So, I hope my change is OK.

Shouldn't the result always be 1 given that `R` refers to `Zmod(97)` after the loop (unless there is a surviving reference from a `Zmod(97)` created in some earlier test)?  What happens if you do `del R` before the last `gc.collect()`?

```
./sage -t --long src/sage/structure/coerce.pyx

but I get the problem when I test after the build

```
./sage -bt --long src/sage/structure/coerce.pyx

which gives the error:

In other doctests in the same file, `GF(3)`, `GF(7)` and `GF(41)` are also created. While there are references to `GF(7)` and `GF(41)`, no variable references to `GF(3)` which is available for gargage collection. If `GF(3)` gets garbage collected before the offending doctest, then everything is fine, the doctest pass. But it can also be garbage collected in the call to `gc.collect()` in the doctest. If this is the case, then `N0` was also counting `GF(3)` which explains why `N2-N0` can be negative.

One way to fix this is to call `gc.collect()` before creating `N0`.

(my first fix was using sets of ids... sorry for the noise).
