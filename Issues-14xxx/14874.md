```
sage: MS = MatrixSpace(GF(2),2,2)
sage: A = MS([1,0,1,1])
sage: A.is_mutable()
True
sage: map(lambda x: x.is_mutable(), A.rows())
[True, True]
sage: A.set_immutable()
sage: map(lambda x: x.is_mutable(), A.rows())
[True, True]
sage: A.rows()[0] = 5
sage: A.rows()
[(1, 0), (1, 1)]
sage: A.rows()[0].set_immutable()
sage: map(lambda x: x.is_mutable(), A.rows())
[False, True]
```
Same thing happens on `columns()` as well.

Since the rows / columns are cached they should always be set immutable before returning them.

Good point. I've made it so that the result from `rows()` and `columns()` and similar methods always return immutable vectors.
