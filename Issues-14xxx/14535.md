This patch allows to create immutable graphs, so that they can be used as keys in dictionaries. 

Previously, calling hash on a graph did work after assigning the attribute `_immutable` to the graph. That's a hack, and it would in fact *not* prevent the graph from being mutated.

With this patch, the attempt to change an immutable graph be means of methods such as add_vertex or add_edge or delete_vertex, will result in an error. If one really wants to play nasty, one could make an immutable graph mutable and change it, or use the backend of the graph for changing the underlying data.

Hello !

* Could you show that there is no slowdown in the graph functions because of that please ?

* Besides, why do you need decorators in the Python classes if you forbid modifications directly in the backend ?

* You create 4 functions in a class that already has a LOT of them. We have several functions that work like that already :

```
sage: g.mutable()
Tells you if it is mutable
sage: g.mutable(True)
Sets it to be mutable
```

* There is a lot of things that graphs store and which are not vertices, nor edges. For example the vertices' layout, or its name... You can see the list of these awful things in `GenericGraph.__eq__`. If you just want to take edges and vertices in consideration could you say it explicitely in the documentation of the `*_mutable` methods ?

And.. Well.. Could you add me in Cc when you write things like that ?

Hi!

Replying to [@nathanncohen](#comment:2):
> Hello !
> 
> * Could you show that there is no slowdown in the graph functions because of that please ?

There certainly is a slowdown in all methods that are protected in this way. And I do not use the decorator in cdef classes, in an attempt to prevent a regression.

Does it make sense to time methods like add_vertex separately? In my applications, one would build a graph, and then it will never again be changed. But I am sure you have better use cases than I. Do you have examples in which add/delete_vertex/edge will typically be called zillions of times?

> * Besides, why do you need decorators in the Python classes if you forbid modifications directly in the backend ?

I do not forbid to change the graphs in the backend. Or at least, I did not intend to modify the backends. If I did, then it was by mistake. If G is an immutable graph, then `G._backend.add_vertex(...)` should not complain.

The reason is, again, that I don't want a slow-down in the "private" methods. If one has an immutable graph used as key in a dictionary, and then decides to work around the "protected" methods `add_vertex`, `add_edge` etc by changing the graph G via G._backend, then this is a conscious decision for which the user takes full responsibility.

So, protection of the user will be restricted to the "official" methods G.add_vertex etc.

> * You create 4 functions in a class that already has a LOT of them. We have several functions that work like that already :
> 
> ```

I did not find any support for mutability in graphs, except for the hack that makes `hash` work.

> * There is a lot of things that graphs store and which are not vertices, nor edges. For example the vertices' layout, or its name... You can see the list of these awful things in `GenericGraph.__eq__`. If you just want to take edges and vertices in consideration could you say it explicitely in the documentation of the `*_mutable` methods ?

Not good. Yes, I should have looked up `GenericGraph.__eq__` and take into account all data used there.

> And.. Well.. Could you add me in Cc when you write things like that ?

Actually, when I created the ticket, I first looked at a preview, and saw that you are among the (default) owners of this ticket. Hence, I concluded that there is no need in adding you in Cc, because you already were on the list of recipients. Sorry if I misinterpreted the meaning of the list of "owners".

Here is a little timing.

Without patch:

```
sage: K12 = graphs.CompleteGraph(12)
sage: K4 = graphs.CompleteGraph(4)
sage: def test(g,h):              
....:     g.delete_edges(h.edge_iterator())
....:     g.add_edges(h.edge_iterator())
....:     
sage: %timeit test(K12,K4)
10000 loops, best of 3: 118 us per loop
```

With patch:

```
sage: K12 = graphs.CompleteGraph(12)
sage: K4 = graphs.CompleteGraph(4)
sage: def test(g,h):
....:     g.delete_edges(h.edge_iterator())
....:     g.add_edges(h.edge_iterator())
....:     
sage: %timeit test(K12,K4)
10000 loops, best of 3: 131 us per loop
sage: (131-118)/118.*100
11.0169491525424
```

So, there is a slow-down of 11% in this example. I don't know if in "real" examples, the backend would be used (without slow-down) internally.

Here are two more timings, this time using `DenseGraph` (hence, not using the decorator) and hash:

Without patch:

With the patch:

```

sage: (2.72-2.59)/2.59*100  # 5% slowdown

sage: K12.set_immutable()

```

Anyway, I presume that in *real* use cases, faster unsafe methods would/could/should be used internally.

Hmmmm. And why should we accept a 10% slowdown in order to have immutable graphs ? `:-P`

? But you make changes to `CGraph`, `SparseGraph` and `DenseGraph`, don't you ? `O_o`
And why wouldn't it be better to only deal with immutability directly in the backends ? No need for decorators if it is done there, and if it is only a "if" with a niiice C variable which never changes. Would reduce the slowdown, wouldn't it ?

Hmmmm... But the developpers could have to do that to make some methods more efficient, and then we would have to deal with immutability by hand. But really I am interested in your answer : why don't you prefer to deal with immutability in the backends directly ? In the `graphs/base/` files ?

Nonono, we don't have such a method at all ! But we have two methods to allow loops and test if they are allowed :

```
sage: g = graphs.PetersenGraph()
sage: g.allows_loops()
False
sage: g.allow_loops(True)
sage: g.allows_multiple_edges()
False
sage: g.allow_multiple_edges(True)
```
So it's already half of what you take, and we could even merge two functions like `allows_loops` and `allow_loops` into one, as in my previous example. That's one of the joys of coding in Python.

Oh. I see. Then it's the Trac developper's fault. The owners of a section are expected to receive an email indeed, except when there are ... several owners.

Then we may have different notions of "backend". By "backend", I understood the stuff that is assigned to `G._backend` and is defined in sage.graphs.base.graph_backends`.

You think it might be better to move all mutability checks into the backend? I thought so as well, initially. But then I found that a couple of add_* methods first change some data *outside* of the backend, and call the backend method only later. So, I thought it is safer to check mutability not in the backend, but in the graph.

I would prefer to deal with it in the backends.

Really, the only way I see to do this properly is to write an immutable backend...

Oh. Sorry, then. I call backend whatever is in the `base/` folder, but perhaps that isn't right. In any case :

```
sage: type(Graph()._backend)
<class 'sage.graphs.base.sparse_graph.SparseGraphBackend'>
```

`sage.graphs.generic_graph.GenericGraph.delete_vertex`, which is

```
        for attr in attributes_to_update:
            if hasattr(self, attr) and getattr(self, attr) is not None:
                getattr(self, attr).pop(vertex, None)
        self._boundary = [v for v in self._boundary if v != vertex]
```
and only afterwards calls the backend. If the order of dealing with attributes and dealing with the backend could be reversed, then making the backend immutable would be enough. But in this order, calling the method on an immutable graph backend would destroy some data *before* raising the error.

Perhaps I should have tried first whether it *can* be reversed...

I haven't looked at the patch yet, but I want to keep an eye on it, and I want to advocate uniformity: try to make the mutability behavior and interface the same as that of Sage's matrices.

I'd be happy if we got immutable graphs. I'd be very happy if we could add/delete/contract and get a copy of the graph without explicitly saying "inplace=False" all the time, but one can dream...

And what about the following?

```
sage: G = graphs.PetersenGraph()
sage: G
Petersen graph: Graph on 10 vertices
sage: G.add_vertex(11)
sage: G
Petersen graph: Graph on 11 vertices
```

Should named graphs be immutable?

Sure it is a mutation. However, I was told a couple of times that the "pythonic way" is to pretend that programmers are adult people who know what they do and who are prepared to take responsibility for their actions. Hence, while there should be some protection against accidental changes to an immutable object, it should still be possible to work around the protection.

I conclude that it would be the anti-pythonic way to
- allow to make a mutable object immutable, but not the other way (this is by making `_is_immutable` a cdef attribute, and restrict the interface to three methods `is_immutable`, `is_mutable` and `set_immutable`)
- make it virtually impossible that a sub-class overrides a mutation-protected method by a method that does not check for mutation (this is possible with metaclasses)
- turn an object into an immutable object as soon as its hash is computed, so that its hash bucket will henceforth never change.

We need to find a reasonable middle way between the overly permissive approach ("all graphs are mutable *and* hashable, the programmer really has to be careful") and the overly protective approach (as described in the bulleted list).

I've updated the patch.

I also removed the mutability checks from some of the backends. The central user-facing point to implement them is in `GenericGraph` / `GenericGraph_pyx`. This is similar to the matrix code where we, for example, don't patch linbox to support (im)mutability.

It seems there is quite a bit of overhead in graph construction since the `GenericGraph._backend` is a Python class. This means various dictionary lookups to locate `add_vertex` and friends. You could shave off a lot of overhead by
1. Move the construction methods (`add_vertex` etc) from `GenericGraph` to `GenericGraph_pyx`
2. Switch `GenericGraphBackend` and its subclasses to Cython and make its methods cdef
3. Equip `GenericGraph_pyx` with a Cython attribute `cdef GenericGraphBackend _backend`
See also http://docs.cython.org/src/userguide/early_binding_for_speed.html But thats material for another ticket.

Once all the constructions methods are in `GenericGraph_pyx` it'll also be easy to switch the mutability check to a very fast inline function.

Why don't you implement these immutable graph with a boolean value in the sage/graphs/base/ files ? I have nothing against a cdef boolean value that would be checked when add_edge/vertex methods are called (even though I think that the only good way to implement this is to write another backend for immutable graphs. But I can do that later, I don't mind), but I do have something against any unnecessary loss of performances in these classes, and especially in these functions.

I exchange many emails these days about how these base classes should be reimplemented efficiently, and if on the other hand you just come and add 10% there or there, we're just wasting our time.

immutable_g = Graph(g, immutable = True)

`O_o`

Having nothing to base Quivers on is probably the last of my worries. Besides, it does not make much sense to have an immutable dense backend that supports multiple edges and edge labels (they just contradict what 'dense' means), so only a sparse one will exist. No choice, no worry `:-P`

If you just want to mark the `Graph` object as immutable, then that does not prevent you from changing the backend while you are at it. Doing so may mean that you get better performances for the adjacency tests later on if a real immutable backend is implemented somewhere.

> Unless you always want to copy the graph data in that step, it will always require you to check a mutability flag.

Once more : checking that the graph is immutable is fine with me if you must do it this way, and I will try to save this by writing an immutable graph backend later on. What I want to avoid is a slowdown in current graphs methods.

I expect that, as you say, check a cdef boolean value would not produce a significant slowdown, while the current patch based on decorators does produce a slowdown.
