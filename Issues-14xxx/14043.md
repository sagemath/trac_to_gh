```
This is bad:

```
sage: zeta(3)
zeta(3)
sage: parent(_)
Symbolic Ring
sage: RealIntervalField(100)(zeta(3))                           
1.20205690315959000000000000000?
```

This should either be fixed to return a correct interval, or give a default error similar to

```
sage: RealIntervalField(100)(psi(1/3))
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
    ...
TypeError: unable to simplify to a real interval approximation
```


Component: **numerical**
