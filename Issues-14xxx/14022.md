This is a follow up to #13985. After that ticket was merged FC/F90/F77 are not set to something that includes -fPIC. This leads to problems like the one reported by Stephen Montgomery-Smith working on the BSD port.

At least it's clear now that `-fPIC` isn't added on FreeBSD.  But I would still really like to know where `SciPy` (or `SCons`) gets the flags from:
