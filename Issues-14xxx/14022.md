This is a follow up to #13985. After that ticket was merged FC/F90/F77 are not set to something that includes -fPIC. This leads to problems like the one reported by Stephen Montgomery-Smith working on the BSD port.

At least it's clear now that `-fPIC` isn't added on FreeBSD.  But I would still really like to know where `SciPy` (or `SCons`) gets the flags from:

```

Sure. It will take a few minutes. Also, I don't think Stephen has a trac account so we cannot add him to the ticket so he could see your question.
The presence of all those -Wl,-rpath= make me think he has set some of the fortran flags manually but it would be nice to have confirmation. My other thought was libgfortan.spec but that wouldn't show up.
