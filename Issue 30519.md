This improves things, so positive review on my behalf if the bots are happy.

If you want to go further, but no pressure to do so here, more suggestions below.

Maybe change `xrange` to `range` in `src/sage/matroids/matroid.pyx`?

Mabye check whether this alert should be taken care of, or removed:

```
# TODO: Alert: this sort of thing will break in Python 3, I think. --SvZ
```


More possible minor code changes in or around the proposed changes:


```diff
-        if (self.size() != other.size() or other.groundset().difference(self.groundset())):
+        if self.size() != other.size() or other.groundset().difference(self.groundset()):
```



```diff
-        if (not isinstance(contractions, str) and not hasattr(contractions, '__iter__') and contractions is not None):
+        if not isinstance(contractions, str) and not hasattr(contractions, '__iter__') and contractions is not None:

```



```diff
-        if (not isinstance(deletions, str) and not hasattr(deletions, '__iter__') and deletions is not None):
+        if not isinstance(deletions, str) and not hasattr(deletions, '__iter__') and deletions is not None:
```



```diff
-        bdx = {basis[i]: i for i in range(len(basis))}
+        bdx = {b: i for i, b in enumerate(basis)}
```



```diff
-                if i % 2 == 0:
-                    x = x * A.get(bdx[path[i]], idx[path[i+1]])
-                else:
-                    x = x * A.get(bdx[path[i+1]], idx[path[i]])
+                if i % 2:
+                    x *= A.get(bdx[path[i + 1]], idx[path[i]])
+                else:
+                    x *= A.get(bdx[path[i]], idx[path[i + 1]])
```


These last two might require importing `polygen`:


```diff
-        z = ZZ['z'].gen()
+        z = polygen(ZZ, 'z')
```



```diff
-        t = QQ['t'].gen()
+        t = polygen(QQ, 't')
```
