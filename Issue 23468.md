A small patchbot complaint (I have none): the print statements in the documentation should now use python 3 syntax. The following is (almost) wrong

```
sage: print gap.help('SymmetricGroup', pager=False) # not tested
```

I agree that this is not tested but the patchbot is not smart enough.

Thanks, Vincent.  I caught 4 other old-style print statements, but missed the untested one.  Thanhks very much for looking at this one.

Merci, Vincent.  The patchbot is working much better than it used to!  Nice to meet you this past week at SD88.

Hi,

This is giving doctest failures at https://patchbot.sagemath.org/log/23927/Ubuntu/14.04/i686/3.13.0-95-generic/arando/2017-09-25%2021:41:12?short the answers seem to be mathematically correct, and the failures seem to stem from output of nondeterministic algorithms being tested.

Also trouble in #23544.

Just a question: I noticed that the tests are written as `.py` files, but they don't contain any Python code at all. So why was the choice made for `.py` as format, as opposed to `.rst` for example?

(I tried to reply by email while traveling - I guess that didn't work.)

There was no particular reason for using `*.py` and I'd be open to suggestions for better alternatives.
