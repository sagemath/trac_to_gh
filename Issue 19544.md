That would be more of an upstream issue than changing around the `spkg-install` file, right?

However, note that the sources are in the author's literate programming system CWEBx, a clone of CWEB by Levy and Knuth. The fact that there is a tarball that does not need CWEBx is already great. I won't expect things magically changed to something even more Sage-compatible...

You can automatically set up a series of 32bit VM and build/test Sage there at http://sagebuilder.metelu.net/ which i used when there was not enough binary builds for Debian and Ubuntu.

I couldn't reproduce any problem to build tides on a 32 bits virtual machine. It is a fresh Ubuntu 15.10 install, with just build-essential, m4, dpkg-dev and git installed. Sage develop branch compiled from the beginning.

Which setup are you using?

The 4ti2-dependent functionality of sandpiles (the one the causes the test failures) is deprecated.
Fixing something that will be removed in half a year is a waste of time and effort.

I don't think we should demote 4ti2 to experimental  just because of this.

What do you think about the `bison` dependency? Keep with the current concept of failing with an error message recommending the user install a system-wide `bison`?

At present, there isn't really a reason because we only have the interface in Sage. I'm somewhat planning on interacting with the algorithms in `lie` once more of #14901 is done, but I don't think that will happen until next year.

It is perfectly acceptable among Sage developers to be CC'd on tickets without first asking.
As you appear to be knowledgeable about  `cryptominisat`, it was certainly done in good faith.

Sorry for getting to this late: I believe I was CC'd in because of gambit but noticed that this is no longer in the description. Has this been addressed?

There was no issue. It seems that there was something wrong with my original testing setup, causing some false positive failures. For `cryptominisat`, the crash seems genuine.

I've heard back from upstream and they seem open to the idea. However I don't have final word yet.

Given that Volker wants to release 7.0 since we are already at `7.0.rc0`, I don't think we would be able to autotoolize `LiE` in time. I really thought we would have more time...

In the interests of the 7.0 release, I'm going to set this to a positive review.

Please no! That would only make it worse.

The problem to be fixed is not that lie depends on bison, that's only a symptom. The real problem is the crazy build system.

`bison` is a small stable program, available for all platforms you can imagine. In this sense it's much easier than `autotools`.
