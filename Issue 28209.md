#28271 introduced a unicode minus sign in the documentation. It causes the pdf building of the documentation to break

Sorry for that, bad copy/paste.

Do we have a "quick" way to check that pdf building goes well ?

No worries. Those are hard to spot until they cause troubles. I intend to use that little commit in pedagogical ways. Can you spot the difference?

No. As far as I know you just have to build the whole thing. On the other hand I checked that it was the only such character in the branch.

The difference between the 2 symbols is hard to see, but with some effort I can see it...

LGTM.

This is difficult to ascertain. First you need suppress the colouring of the commit to remove optical illusion and color bleeding. If you are short sighted the default choice of green and red has a definite impact on your perception of size. For other eye conditions there will also be some effect but possibly less pronounced.

Thanks.

I think this needs to be in 8.9 or else the pdf docs will not build. Would making it a blocker help that? Or do we just cross our fingers?

Changing priority from major to blocker.

It is a very minor change. I put it as a blocker.
