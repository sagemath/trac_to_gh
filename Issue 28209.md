No worries. Those are hard to spot until they cause troubles. I intend to use that little commit in pedagogical ways. Can you spot the difference?

No. As far as I know you just have to build the whole thing. On the other hand I checked that it was the only such character in the branch.

I think this needs to be in 8.9 or else the pdf docs will not build. Would making it a blocker help that? Or do we just cross our fingers?
