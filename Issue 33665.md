in #26496 a simple implementation of modular decomposition was added, but no explicit example showing that 'tedder' is buggy.
An example is now posted on sage-devel:

```
sage:     d = {
....:         1  :  [2, 3, 4],
....:         2  :  [1, 3, 4],
....:         3  :  [1, 2, 4],
....:         4  :  [1, 2, 3, 5],
....:         5  :  [10, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9],

....:         7  :  [5, 6, 8, 9],
....:         8  :  [5, 7, 9],
....:         9  :  [10, 5, 7, 8],
....:         10  :  [5, 9]
....:     }
....:     g = Graph(d)
sage: g.modular_decomposition(algorithm='tedder') # --- wrong ?!
(PRIME, [5, (SERIES, [9, (PARALLEL, [10, 7, 8, 6])]), 4, (SERIES, [3, 2, 1])])
sage: g.modular_decomposition(algorithm='habib')
(PRIME, [5, 4, (SERIES, [1, 2, 3]), (PRIME, [9, 7, 6, 8, 10])])
```

Since we remove algorithm `'tedder'` in #25872, we can move this ticket to `wontfix`.
