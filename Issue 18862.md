# Issue 18862: Always check output in strongly_regular_graph

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/19099

With this branch, the function `strongly_regular_graph` will not return any graph whose parameters have not been checked. As it is rather cheap to compute those parameters it should neve rbe a problem, and it can obviously be disabled whenever convenient.
