# Issue 17018: Update developer and installation guide even more

Issue created by migration from Trac.

#17112 was some needed reorganization of these resources.  This ticket continues the process, especially by emphasizing direct steps for Mac.  This was inspired by an email exchange with a nearly-thwarted would-be developer and the steps she took.

Just a detail: it's Sage 6.4 now, not Sage 6.3

> Just a detail: it's Sage 6.4 now, not Sage 6.3
I thought about that for several minutes, actually, dithering on what to do.  Because of course, in principle, there is no guarantee that this ticket will be reviewed and merged in Sage 6.4, or 6.5, or 7.0, or anything...  so I went with the safest possible, which is that I _wrote_ this during Sage 6.3.

But hopefully nearly trivial to change now that I'm more comfortable with git.  Or you can do it as a reviewer patch if you do one :-)

On OS X, do you really need to register as a developer, or can you just download Xcode from the App Store and go from there?

I don't know the answer to this question.  They've changed their interface so much recently.  But then at the very least you need to have an iTunes account, right?  (And would they make you get a developer account to get Command Line Tools?  I don't know that either.) That's why I don't use the App Store, though perhaps my developer account would work.  If you can find out exact info on this it would be swell!

Hmm, no longer applies.

Okay, I think that [this link](http://railsapps.github.io/xcode-command-line-tools.html) and a few other comments online seem to confirm what John says.  I've tried to update this appropriately.

If there is a quick review, then my change to 6.4 in the notes will still be accurate!

Are links between manuals possible? Just asking because of

```
- Next, if you've never worked on software before, you will want to read
  about the `prerequisites to compile
  <http://www.sagemath.org/doc/installation/source.html#prerequisites>`_
```

which would ideally be an internal link.

I cannot judge the correctness of the OS X stuff, but apart from that the patch looks good. I'm adding a few small changes in this reviewer patch.

Yes, I totally agree, but I felt like it was only possible within sections of one manual, since each of them is built separately.  (Otherwise, for instance, we could link to localizations of documents.)

The fixes are all good (I only focused on new updates, didn't think to update those things) except

```diff
-This section details the technical prerequisites needed on any platform. See
-`System-specific requirements`_ and `Installing prerequisites`_ for details
-on how to acquire these. :ref:`Mac OS X <section_macprereqs>` has
-special instructions as developer tools do not come standard.
+This section details the technical prerequisites needed on all platforms. See
+also the `System-specific requirements`_ below.
```

I purposely added all this originally because, in my experience with new developers that truly have no developing experience (and I do have a significant amount of experience with them), that little extra verbiage and especially the two additional links will make a big difference.  The system requirements is not the same as actually installing them, and for many Mac users this is really foreign territory.  Even if you insist on removing the Mac words, please do keep the installing prereqs link.

On the other hand, too much text and superfluous references can also be confusing.

> The system requirements is not the same as actually installing them, and for many Mac users this is really foreign territory.
In the guide, the sections "System-specific requirements" and "Installing prerequisites" are very close together, so a user clicking on "System-specific requirements" will see the "Installing prerequisites" section also. Moreover, "System-specific requirements" even has an explicit link for Mac OS X in the first sentence.

So I don't see what the problem could be with my changes.

Yes, I thought about this a fair amount.  Unfortunately one doesn't have a focus group to test this on.

The problem isn't your change, it's the huge amount of text below it.  But I have come up with what I think will be a good compromise - one moment.

I couldn't figure out a way to get Sphinx to ignore two levels of headings after each other, which has some of the same "busy-ness" problems that you objected to.
> Prerequisites
> General requirements
I tried to remove the words "General requirements" but got lots of errors; ReST is very strict about levels.  I still think this is a better solution, hopefully you will agree.
