CC:  vivianepons @tscrim @darijgr sage-combinat @nthiery @fchapoton

Keywords: composition,  combinatorics, random

I am overwritting the default random_element method of the Composition_n class to implement an efficient way to compute a random composition.

As explained in the documentation, I use the fact that composition of size n are in bijection with binary words of size n starting with a 1.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/17242
