# Issue 12449: use bash for prereq and bzip2 install files

Issue created by migration from Trac.

The script prereq-0.9-install starts with the line
{{{#!/bin/sh
```

As a result, when installing prereq on a Solaris machine, I see this:

```
Starting prerequisite check.
Machine: SunOS mark2 5.10 Generic_127111-01 sun4u sparc SUNW,Sun-Blade-2500
base/prereq-0.9-install: !: not found
checking for a BSD-compatible install... ./install-sh -c
```

I think this is because of the line

```
if ! [ -f "$SAGE_ROOT/spkg/base/$TARGET.tar" ]; then
```

in prereq-0.9-install. Using bash to run this script instead of sh fixes the problem. So I propose using bash for this script, and also for the bzip2 install script.

Should the "0.9" be incremented with a change like this?
