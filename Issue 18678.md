I noticed the following:



```
sage: F = GF(2)
sage: F.extension(int(3), 'a')
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
UndoundLocalError: local variable 'E' referenced before assignment
```



and


```
sage: F = GF(2 ** 4, 'a')
sage: F.extension(int(3), 'aa')
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
TypeError: polynomial (=3) must be a polynomial.
```



while


```
sage: F.extension(Integer(3), 'aa')
Finite Field in aa of size 2^12
```



works fine.

This is due to the `isinstance` calls which check only if `modulus` is of type `Integer` on the dedicated check instead of checking for `int` type as well.
