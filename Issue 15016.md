i read `coerce_binop` at `sage/structure/element.pyx`, but do not understand what is the use case for Polyhedron, can someone give some hints? 

when you remove the `@`coerce_binop decorator, the example in `product` (/polyhedron/base.py) still transforms to `QQ^2` when asked for `P1 * P2`.

would it be ok if it just performs a `has_coerce_map_from` for the base rings?

Hi, this is not a solution! i'm posting a commented session where i learned something new about this issue..

first, the problem:


```
sage: P = polytopes.hypercube(1)
sage: Q = polytopes.hypercube(2)
sage: P * Q
...
TypeError: no common canonical parent for objects with parents: 'Polyhedra in ZZ^1' and 'Polyhedra in ZZ^2'
```


it arises from using the ``@`coerce_binop` decorator at the definition of (Cartesian) `product`. indeed,

```
sage: P.parent()
Polyhedra in ZZ^1
sage: Q.parent()
Polyhedra in ZZ^2
sage: P.parent().parent()
<class 'sage.geometry.polyhedron.parent.Polyhedra_ZZ_ppl_with_category'>
sage: Q.parent().parent()
<class 'sage.geometry.polyhedron.parent.Polyhedra_ZZ_ppl_with_category'>
```


in consequence:


```
sage: P.parent() is Q.parent()  # ok
False
sage: P.parent().parent() is Q.parent().parent()  # ok
True
```


on the other side, in `def coerce_binop(method)` it uses `have_same_parent`:


```
sage: from sage.structure.element import have_same_parent
sage: have_same_parent(P, Q)   # ok
False
sage: have_same_parent(P.parent(), Q.parent())   # why False?
False
```


so already at the level of `coerce_binop` there is this a bit strange thing one would say (?). also related is the Warning block in the definition of `cpdef inline bint have_same_parent(left, right):`, which says

This function assumes that at least one of the arguments is a
Sage :class:`Element`. When in doubt, use the slower
``parent(left) is parent(right)`` instead.

To sum up:

- perhaps one could define a custom ``@`coerce_binop_polyhedron` decorator which checks for grandparents, and which does not use `have_same_parent`.
- alternatively, if it is indeed ok that `if have_same_parent(self, other)` gives False in this situation, then one should define a "canonical coercion" so that the method `coercion_model.canonical_coercion(self, other)` doesn't fail. but where?

Disclaimer: I am not an expert in polytopes. I feel like this is the correct error as there is not a canonical way to embed a **Z** polytope into a **Z**<sup>2</sup> polytope.

However, that is not the issue with the ticket as the product is still well-defined, but what actually should be tested is that the base rings can be made into a common parent:

```
P.base_ring().has_coerce_map_from(Q.base_ring())
```

So if that is `False`, then an error should be raised. Otherwise it should change the base ring of both polytopes to this common ring and proceed.

Thanks Travis. I'm uploading an attempt based on the previous observations.
