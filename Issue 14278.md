In order to switch to the new workflow, we need to create a set of development scripts for interfacing against git and trac.

There is a problem in the handling of untracked files. Git interprets "untracked" as untracked in cwd. In fact, just having been given `--git-dir` we can't possibly know where the working directory is. For example, consider the filesystem layout:

```
$ tree -a
.
├── a
│   ├── file_in_a
│   └── .git
│       ├── branches
│       [...] 
└── b
    └── file_in_b
$ cd b
$ git --git-dir=../a/.git ls-files --other
file_in_b
```

whereas you probably would have expected `file_in_a`.

Also, I'm not entirely happy with the git interface. Though I also think its good enough to use in the git scripts and its probably a bad idea to do any architectural changes at this point. For the record I've built on the current code at https://github.com/vbraun/SageUI/tree/release/src/sageui/model. Changes incude

* Use proxy objects instead of having to import magic constants:
  {{{
In [3]: git.status()   # return stdout by default, the most desirable behaviour
Out[3]: '# On branch dev_scripts\nnothing to commit, working directory clean\n'

In [4]: git.exit_code.status()
Out[4]: 0

In [5]: git.silent.status()

In [6]: git.echo.status()
# On branch dev_scripts
nothing to commit, working directory clean
  }}}
* Don't hardcode the Sage repo directory, this is probably going to be useful elsewhere
* Use the `GIT_DIR` and `GIT_WORK_TREE` environment variables instead of `--git-dir` (though warning: there seems to be a bug in `git status`, it is not respecting `GIT_WORK_TREE`)
* Split the git interface (handling the mechanics of interfacing with the git binary) from the logical repository handling (like the `create_ticket` method)
* Put all the doctesting setup into a utility class instead of having lengthy sections creating `Doctest*` classes and sample repos.

Where is the repo hardcoded?

Could you explain the benefit of GIT_DIR and GIT_WORK_TREE?

`create_ticket` is not part of the git interface anymore. Are there any other methods you want to move?

Good point. I was not sure initially what the doctests would look like. Now it seems that there are only two cases (one user, two users). I'll put the usual setup into special functions.

Thanks!

There is a minor annoyance left, I have already set up ssh keys yet the dev scripts insist on doing it again and prompt for username/password. We should first check if authetication to gitolite works, and only upload keys if it doesn't. I suggest the following test: Run

```
ssh -o "StrictHostKeyChecking yes" -o "PasswordAuthentication no" -o "PubkeyAuthentication yes" -p 2222 git@trac.sagemath.org help

If the exit code is 0, then the host key and ssh keys are already set up.

Do you want to spit in the original author's face and delete his description [Y/N]?

If you are using the dev scripts then you never get to see the actual branch name, so it shouldn't matter. If not then you should have tab-completion for git branches, making it into a non-issue as well. 

In any case, we can easily add that later so its not important for the first release of the dev scripts.

I'm pretty happy with the rename. Two things remain:

```
    reset-to-clean-working-directory
                        Drop any uncommitted changes in the working directory.
```

should be something like

```
    clean               Delete all uncommited changes.
```

And `unstash` is not a word, its akin to "unspend" not being the opposite of "spend". It should be removed (my favorite) or renamed to `stash apply' (preferably) or 'stash-apply' (if we really must).

I'm happy with the `clean` rename, but I think `unstash` is better than either of the alternatives you've suggested, even if it's not a word.

Replying to [comment:99 vbraun]:
> I tried out the "stash" feature and it doesn't stash anything. It reimplements something that is similar but using branches instead of the git stash stack. So if this is the desired effect then we shouldn't call it stash, which also resolves the unstash naming question. Just call its save/restore or something like that.
It implements something that feels like stashing but internally it does not stash, correct. The reason for this is that the names of stashes change, i.e., the first stash is called something like ``@`stash{0}` but if you create another stash then it changes to ``@`stash{1}`. Feel free to change the current behaviour/naming if you are not happy with it.

I used INFO to log messages about how to proceed, this is one of the crucial features that make git usable:

```
$ git status
# On branch dev_scripts
# Your branch is ahead of 'trac/u/vbraun/dev_scripts' by 11 commits.
#   (use "git push" to publish your local commits)
#
# Untracked files:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
#
#	test
nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

Everything with comment markers is what I call INFO. I spent a lot of time observing people trying to use the dev scripts last week and not being told about the next logical step is a huge obstacle.

There are lots of DEBUG messages (=stuff that protocols the execution flow like "operation completed successfully") that are mislabeled as INFO. If you don't want to see unless you are trying to debug the program then it should be DEBUG.

We can have an intermediate INFO < HELP < NORMAL level if somebody really has a use for non-debug informational messages but I think that would be overkill.

I am having trouble importing Hg patches. I added an issue to the Github page with the details.

EDIT - Also I don't like that when aborting patch imports that it deletes all untracked directories (in particular, documentation output). I'd prefer if we could only delete newly created directories.

Thanks for all your work on this.

The issues forum in the ticket description: ​https://github.com/sagemath/sage-workflow/issues
