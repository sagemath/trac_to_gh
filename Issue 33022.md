# Issue 33022: Github docker images: push also latest tag

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/33259

Original creator: @tobiasdiez

Original creation time: 2022-01-31 11:54:25

CC:  mkoeppe

Running 

```
docker pull ghcr.io/sagemath/sage/sage-docker-ubuntu-focal-standard-with-targets:latest
```


or 

```
docker pull ghcr.io/sagemath/sage/sage-docker-ubuntu-focal-standard-with-targets
```


results in `manifest unknown` error. It only works if one specifies a version, e.g. `9.5` in place of `latest`.

This is done in #33103 already, it just needs to be merged...
