Thanks John.

This was done by hand, so the review is needed, but very boring indeed.

Indeed most of the changes are trivial. The idea is to later check this directly before the new code enter sage. But we have to cleanup all the existing code also.

Using `x is not y` and `x not in Z` seems to be the recommended way now.

Not as boring -- and a lot quicker! -- than making the edits.  I appreciate that (especially as a good fraction of the changes were in lines I wrote).
