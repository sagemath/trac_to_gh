# Issue 15601: tell user about sage crash before doing dev work

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/15838

Original creator: rws

Original creation time: 2014-02-20 15:16:28

Keywords: crash message

Due to a missing SPKG Sage did not build, but when I wanted to `sage -dev push` it said

```
Developer interface disabled.

To develop for Sage you must compile Sage from its git
repository. This just amounts to running

    git clone git://github.com/sagemath/sage.git
    cd sage
    make

See http://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/QuickStartSageGit for slightly more
information.
```

Rather it should give the same `Oops, Sage crashed...` message which it does when I try to start it without options.

wontfix because of removal of dev scripts, see https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!topic/sage-devel/JtVWAdvw-3A
