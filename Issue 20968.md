What's on this ticket suffices for me, that was why I implemented only a basic algorithm.

I suggest to implement extensions/improvements on a follow up ticket. The function `joint_spectral_radius` could/should then be equipped with a parameter `algorithm=...`.

Why using the 2-norm (involving the square root) as a default? Wouldn't the 1-norm or oo-norm be ok?

Note that there is

```
    def max(m):
        m = list(m)
        return m[0].max(*m[1:])
```

defined a couple of lines above, so this is IMO indeed what is wanted.

And, eigenvalues are not there for inexact rings:

And there is also

```
def rho(M):
   return max(R(abs(v)) for v in M.eigenvalues())
```

which is incorrect (since here `R=RIF` (at least in the default situation)).
