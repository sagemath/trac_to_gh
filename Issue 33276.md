It sounds a silly question, but why saving static images from 3d graphics in the documentation is an issue?

The issue is that it currently relies on ancient technology - either Jmol (which needs a Java runtime) or alternatively tachyon.

I meant why we should save static images in the first place. In interactive use of the documentation, threejs provides a menu to save png image.

Of course for the HTML doc I do prefer embedding the notebook (#33507).
But for PDF we probably don't have a better option.

I wrongly presumed that jupyter-sphinx rendering of 3d images would produce png images for pdf docs. Now I checked that it doesn't work that way.

In #33507, I take a simple approach to provide static images for pdf documentation. 

I think that seeking for an automatic way to produce static images from live images would not be worth the efforts. One of the reasons is that taking a good-looking static image needs human intervention anyway.
