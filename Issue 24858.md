Keywords: IMA-PolyGeom

The methods `sage.plot.plot3d.shapes2.polygon3d` and `sage.plot.plot3d.shapes2.polygons3d` have the keyword argument "opacity". However it is not passed to the plot function. For example,

```
polygon3d([[1, 2, 3], [0,1,0], [1,0,1], [3,0,0]], color=(0,1,0), opacity=0.5)
```

is treated as opacity=1.
