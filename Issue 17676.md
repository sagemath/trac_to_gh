The flat install (no egg) is a feature imho... the whole packing into an egg and then unpacking it again when you need something from it is crazy.

Pip has a switch for force-reinstalling but then it'll also want to force-reinstall the Jinja2 dependency. We should just move the packages out of the sagenb tarball, and install sagenb without deps... I've added a step to delete the old sagenb, that at least will ensure that it is reinstalled (though not the dependencies inside the sagenb tarball).

I'm not complaining about this, just saying that the `cd` statement should be updated (like you did).
