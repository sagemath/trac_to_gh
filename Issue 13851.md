would it make sense to use `'temp'` instead of `'tmp'`, so all of the sage-cleaner information is in the same directory?

THERE ARE STILL SOME INSTANCES OF UPPERCASE SAGE.

I don't like the mixture of tmp, temp, TMP and TEMP or whatever.




`temp` and `tmp` shouldn't be hardcoded.

"Deleting `.../spawned_processes`" gets printed even if `.../spawned_processes` is not a directory (`not e`), and also `rmtree()` is attempted, ignoring any `OSError`.




I don't like `"%s" % i` where `i` is (or should be) an `int`. 




Command line option handling is certainly suboptimal.  (`argv[1]` could be a `float` as well, there's no usage, and additional parameters simply get ignored.)

Likewise, if `DOT_SAGE` isn't set, an ugly `KeyError` is raised, instead of printing a meaningful message.

I am having a problem with this patch, but I don't know why. I am repeatedly running `sage -tp 2 devel/sage/sage/homology/s*`. Without the patch applied, everything is fine. With the patch, after the first successful run, I get this (I also removed the `&>/dev/null` after the call to `sage-cleaner` in `spkg/bin/sage`):

```

    cumulative wall time: 0.5 seconds
```

Without the patch, the file `simplicial_complex.py` passes tests in under 7 seconds; cpu time and cumulative wall time are each around 6 or 7 seconds. With the patch, the time out is pretty consistent for each run after the first. I'm seeing this on two different OS X 10.8 machines.

Also, if I delete the directory `DOT_SAGE/tmp`, then the pidfile won't get written at all during doctesting or when running sage. What script is responsible for creating that directory? If this directory is missing, I don't get the time-out any more, so the problem is really with sage-cleaner.

On the bright side, it seems to be cleaning out the appropriate files, directories, and processes.

Where is `DOTSAGE/tmp` used? Certainly the `temp` version is used in the definition of `SAGE_TMP`, so that is ubiquitous. For the file `cleaner-HOSTNAME.pid`, is that referenced anywhere in the Sage library? It looks like we could put that file in `temp` instead of `tmp` safely.

I wouldn't rely on some wall time.

Unfortunately the cleaner cannot `wait()` for its parent, but it could poll whether it is still running (or -- much better I think -- wait for another signal), and do nothing until its parent has "vanished" (terminated, and no other process with the same PID is meanwhile running -- that's also a potential, although probably unlikely, problem with left-over Sage cleaner and `spawned_processes` PID files; in the latter case, even unrelated processes of the same user could get killed.)

If there's already another Sage cleaner instance running, it could of course exit immediately (modulo the problem mentioned before).

I can indeed reproduce the problem and #14323 doesn't help.

I found the problem with `expect.py`: the doctest process starts the `sage-cleaner`, somehow leading to trouble.

Sure enough, in this case sage-cleaner isn't running while Sage is. Is this a problem? (It does start up if asked to by `interfaces/cleaner.py`.)

I can, not very reliably, reproduce this by starting Sage, letting the count go above 10, quit Sage, wait a second or two, and then restart it.

Otherwise, I think I'm happy with this.

I'm now among the lucky few who get these greedy, immortal ECL processes:

With Sage 5.9.beta2 (which includes #14323), GCC 4.8.0, on Ubuntu 10.04.4 x86_64, during `make` **testlong** (as opposed to `make ptestlong` -- others previously reported only the latter caused problems).

Two ECL processes show up while testing `sage/interfaces/lisp.py` (as I had guessed), quickly start eating up memory, and keep running even after the file has been tested without any errors.

Same on Ubuntu 10.04.4 x86, GCC 4.7.2, and `ptestlong`.  I also got an orphaned Maxima process (running at 100%) in the first run.  (Sage 5.9.beta2, no patches from here applied.)

So I've continued experimenting with Sage 5.8 vs. 5.9.beta2 (same system, same compiler and flags), and it turns out that the rogue ECL processes are solely caused by the new doctesting framework, so we should probably open another ticket for that issue.  (I did the tests with the Sage cleaner "disabled" in both releases, too, with the same results: 5.8, with the old doctesting framework: No problems at all.  5.9.beta2: ECL orphans every time I run doctests from the Makefile, no problems when run from the command line, i.e., without using `make`.)

Minimal receipt to reproduce the orphans here:

```make
testlisp:
        ./sage -t devel/sage/sage/interfaces/lisp.py
```

Running `make testlisp`.

The (un)setting of `MAKE`, using `make -j1`, `./sage -t` vs. `./sage -tp` etc. doesn't matter, nor does using `$(PIPE)` (or `spkg/bin/pipestatus`), or `tee`ing the output with a "normal" pipe;  it just works when running `./sage -t ...` from the command line, while I get the busy orphans as soon as I run the exact same command(s) from the Makefile.

(Note that also ECL didn't change between 5.8 and 5.9.beta2.)

So fixing the Sage cleaner alone *may* alleviate the problem, but won't really solve it.

Did a little more testing ...

With (Ubuntu 10.04.4's) GNU Make 3.81, I do get the orphans, while I don't get them with (vanilla) GNU Make 3.82.  (I haven't found any particularly interesting change in 3.82's NEWS.)

Here is my view on this ticket:

- `sage-cleaner` used to be completely broken.
- this ticket mostly fixes it.
- the only flaw I see is a [comment:24 race condition], but that looks pretty rare. Fixing it can wait.
- there are undoubtedly other ways in which `sage-cleaner` could be fixed up, but they can wait.

So I'm willing to give this a positive review. Any dissenting views?

I actually didn't have problems with it recently (more precisely, for meanwhile a few years), until 5.9.x.

Agreed, although I haven't closely looked at that yet.  (It's pretty clear that there is a race condition, but I'm not sure how likely it is in practice.)

Hmmm, *in principle<sup>TM</sup>* the Sage cleaner (with the patches from here) should have killed the ECL processes, but Andrey reported it did not, so (regardless of #12426) something seems to be still broken.

I haven't seen problems with processes, but the subdirectories of `DOT_SAGE/temp/` have been polluted with many directories dating back to 5.8 at least, because sage-cleaner was looking in the wrong directory.

> Hmmm, *in principle<sup>TM</sup>* the Sage cleaner (with the patches from here) should have killed the ECL processes, but Andrey reported it did not, so (regardless of #12426) something seems to be still broken. 

In your testing, could you tell whether the correct PID (for the runaway process) was written to the correct file? How did the runaway process escape the cleaner?

The ECL processes' PIDs should be in the `spawned_processes` text file, with the patches from here now located in the directory `sage.misc.SAGE_TMP` (usually some `$DOT_SAGE/temp/<hostname>-<pid>/...` or `$DOT_SAGE/temp/<hostname>/<pid>/`?).

Volker, I don't understand your patch. In sage.misc.misc, `HOSTNAME` is imported from sage.env, where its definition is

```
        'HOSTNAME'         : socket.gethostname().replace('-','_').replace('/','_').replace('\\','_')
```

What does `sage.env.HOSTNAME` return on your machine? What about `sage.misc.misc.SAGE_TMP`?

I've also seen similar problems on taurus. With taurus, and sometimes with mark, one part of the doctest failure for linear_algebra.rst says

```

Internal or unrecoverable error in:

Is the sage-cleaner removing some directory too early?

I don't know why there are random spaces sprinkled in, but it certainly doesn't have anything to do with this ticket. I haven't found any other failures on taurus.

Running with `nice -19` and background load seems to trigger it, I now get some maxima segfaults somewhat reliably. They look like a race in the multi-threaded ecl to me, for example the following failure:

The last time I looked at it, ECL as a library with multithread support is rather fundamentally incompatible with the way we use it. As far as I know, if thread support is enabled then ECL expects one (dedicated?) thread to handle asynchronous signals and I think that thread may even be split off when there's otherwise only one thread running.

However, as an "embeddable" lisp there's a good argument they should also keep a strictly single-threaded version as an option and I hope they're continuing with that (perhaps sending a message that we really appreciate single threadedness might help).

Our signal switching code has been a little behind the times for a while already. Some improvements were suggested here:

http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.lisp.ecl.general/8211

That code might be outdated already as well.

What is the hypothesis here, by the way? That an event triggered by sage-cleaner produces a signal meant for our own signal handler that happens to end up in with the ecl signal handler? If that's the problem I see no way around it.

For the record, we build ECL with `--disable-threads` so it shouldn't have any multithread support. It does link with pthreads, though perhaps boehmgc needs that. 

I don't think the sage-cleaner has anything to do with the problem. It just slightly changes timings so that we happen to trigger a rather unlikely race on taurus/skynet. It certainly should not send any signals except for term/kill.

The new doctest framework seems to be the only thing that uses SIGCHLD in the Sage library.

OK, good.

So perhaps this should go on a different ticket then?

I took a quick look at [unixint.d](http://sourceforge.net/p/ecls/ecl/ci/master/tree/src/c/unixint.d) and it seems ECL does install a handler for SIGCHLD. Perhaps you're just unlucky that the SIGCHLD gets delivered at a very inopportune moment when ECL hasn't quite finished setting up its handlers? Or are we just sloppy in how we change handlers? The handler they use is defined in [unixsys.d](http://sourceforge.net/p/ecls/ecl/ci/master/tree/src/c/unixsys.d) as `si::wait-for-all-processes`.

Switching off ECL_OPT_TRAP_SIGCHLD seems to fix it (knock on wood). 50x testing linear_algebra.rst on taurus works with the new spkg (you need to recompile maxima after ecl).
