Is building with `CYLP_USE_CYTHON=1` still supported / ever tested?
Fails for me without diagnostics

```
[cylp-0.91.4]   running build_ext
[cylp-0.91.4]   cythoning cylp/cy/CyClpPrimalColumnPivotBase.pyx to cylp/cy/CyClpPrimalColumnPivotBase.cpp
[cylp-0.91.4]   error: /Users/mkoeppe/s/sage/sage-rebasing/worktree-gcc11/local/var/lib/sage/venv-python3.10/var/tmp/sage/build/cylp-0.91.4/src/cylp/cy/CyClpPrimalColumnPivotBase.pyx

Without `CYLP_USE_CYTHON`, running into https://github.com/coin-or/CyLP/issues/148 with Python 3.10.

This works for me on macOS with Python 3.10 and CBC 2.10.7 installed from homebrew. https://github.com/coin-or/CyLP#modeling-example works as expected.

Changing status from new to needs_review.

Also builds OK with `tox -e docker-ubuntu-trusty-maximal -- cylp` (this uses our `cbc` spkg, currently still at 2.9.4)

Also builds OK with `tox -e docker-ubuntu-bionic-maximal -- cylp` (using system coinor-cbc (2.9.9+repack1-1))

I'll not run the full portability suite now. I think this is good enough for a new optional package.

That is a pretty massive patch. Although I guess the time for them for the next release is probably a bit away, so I guess it is necessary.

This builds and works fine for me.
