The work of Arkani-Hamed et al (see http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.5605) on scattering amplitudes in N=4 super-symmetric quantum field theory, assigns certain permutations to the terms in the BCFW recursion for calculating scattering amplitudes at tree level.  Closely related permutations are also associated to maximal-dimensional cells in a certain decomposition of the amplituhedron.  I am in the process of writing code to get Sage to calculate these sets of permutations, and I figured it might be useful to make that code available.

More ambitiously, there is a Mathematica worksheet which contains code relevant to the Arkani-Hamed et al. project, and it could be useful to implement other aspects of it in Sage.  See http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.6974.  I have no plans currently to do that, but if someone else does, please note it on this ticket too.
