Is this a solution:

```
from six.moves.urllib.request import urlopen
```

? This is what I used in #25535.

No because it is already used in `covering_design.py`.
In #25535 you use `with ... as` with a file objet, this works nicely.

As mentionned [here](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-release/boCyh_RM9WU/Y8EyeFWLAgAJ), two files were having the same issue. We are almost there.

There is still one small issue:


```
$ sage -tp --long --optional=sage,optional,external src/sage/combinat/designs/covering_design.py  src/sage/combinat/designs/design_catalog.py
```

gives
