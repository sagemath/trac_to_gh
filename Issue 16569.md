Forget the last part of my previous comment:  I had already done the merge, as you can see from the list of new commits (first the merge, then my reviewer's patch).  So this is ready for re-review by the original author!

A few comments:
* The docstring of the main function reads ""Returns a list of primes `p` including all primes for which the mod-`p` representation might not be contained in a Borel."" Isn't it the complement, i.e., all those that "may be contained in a Borel" ?

* I thought  "try: ...  except `ValueError`: return [0]"  is not what we should do. If the long and convoluted line in try produces a `ValueError`, that could have many reasons, and we should not just ignore this and send back [0] but pass the error on.

* It is a shame that this function will not be available for curves over Q. But I guess it should be a separate ticket to merge the two classes dealing with Galois Reps together at some point.

You are right.

> * I thought  "try: ...  except `ValueError`: return [0]"  is not what we should do. If the long and convoluted line in try produces a `ValueError`, that could have many reasons, and we should not just ignore this and send back [0] but pass the error on.

I'm to blame for the long line -- the original version had this split over many lines.   The set we return is the union of (1) primes of additive reduction (found as factors of gcd(c4,Delta) in effect; (2) primes ramified in the field; (3) the ones returned by _semistable_reducible_primes.  The latter function uses [0] to denote CM.  So I cannot see what circumstances will lead to a ValueError, and suggest we can simplify this.

Agreed.  I said so myself somewhere.

I will revise the branch to take into account your first two points...

I made cosmetic changes in line with Chris's comments:  various tidying of docstrings (including fixing that double negative) and simplifying (making clearer I hope) the two long lines where various sets of primes are collected.  It turned out that a try/except is needed since the function _semistable_reducible_primes() does raise a ValueError if given a CM curve.

Ready for a new review!

Am I right that the file does not appear in the reference manual ?

I added this and modified the starting docstring so that the reference manual builds. 

Starting testing now. Except a positive review soon.
