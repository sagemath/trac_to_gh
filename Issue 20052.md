It looks good overall except for this change:

```diff
-    g = AntiCoordinationGame(A=v/2-c, a=v/2-c, B=0, b=v, C=v, c=0, D=v/2, d=v/2)
+    g = AntiCoordinationGame(A=v / 2 - c, a=v / 2 - c, B=0, b=v,
+                             C=v, c=0, D=v / 2, d=v / 2)
```

I think it makes it less readable and is one of those cases where we should not follow PEP8 to the letter.
