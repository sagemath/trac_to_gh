Keywords: function fields

In the current function field code, ideals of infinite orders do not support containment testing:

```
sage: K.<x> = FunctionField(GF(3^2)); R.<t> = K[]
sage: F.<y> = K.extension(t^3 + t^2 - x^4)
sage: Oinf = F.maximal_order_infinite()
sage: I = Oinf.ideal(1/y)
sage: 1/y in I
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-19-a3f98a86502f> in <module>()
----> 1 Integer(1)/y in I

TypeError: argument of type 'IdealMonoid_with_category.element_class' is not iterable
```

Ideals of finite orders do support such tests:

```
sage: O = F.maximal_order()
sage: I = O.ideal(y)
sage: y in I
True
```
