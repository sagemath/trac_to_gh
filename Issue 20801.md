Presently:

```
sage: dumps(BooleanFunction([0]))
ValueError: negative shift count
sage: dumps(BooleanFunction([0,1]))
ValueError: negative shift count
```

This is because

```
sage: BooleanFunction([0]).truth_table(format="hex")
ValueError: negative shift count
sage: BooleanFunction([0,1]).truth_table(format="hex")
ValueError: negative shift count
```

This problem was reported in the thread of
[https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/evIMO7NEFNc/GzCwfqv1AAAJ](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/evIMO7NEFNc/GzCwfqv1AAAJ)
and a fix is proposed there.

The proposed fix is to pickle boolean functions in 0 or 1 variables with a different encoding format. This should be backward compatible with how functions with more variables were pickled before.

```
def __reduce__(self):
    if self.nvariables() <2:
        return unpickle_BooleanFunction, (self.truth_table(format='int'),)
    else
        unpickle_BooleanFunction, (self.truth_table(format='hex'),)
```
