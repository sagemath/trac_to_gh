Currently, Sage cannot compute kernels of matrices over `Zmod(n)` for composite `n`.

This patch adds a call path from `Matrix.right_kernel_matrix()` to PARI's `matkermod()` function for matrices defined over `IntegerModRing`s with composite modulus.

Also, for symmetry we add a `.left_kernel_matrix()` method that simply calls `.transpose()` and defers to `.right_kernel_matrix()`.
