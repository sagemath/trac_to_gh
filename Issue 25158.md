* `+    Returns the h-th transvectant of f and g.`
should be
`+    Return the h-th transvectant of f and g.`
And same thing (Return) for all first lines of all functions and methods.

* `EXAMPLES::` is mis-indented in transvectant

* references should look like `[Cle1872]_` not like `_[Cle1872]`

* `TESTS::` and `EXAMPLES::` must be followed by an empty line

* missing backquotes in `+        The \tau-covariant of the binary quintic as polynomial or as binary form.`

etc, etc. Please thoroughly check the documentation of your work.

please now take care of the pyflakes plugin warnings, and fix the failing doctest (missing import)

Thanks for looking into all this. The doctests should all be fine now and the pyflakes fixed.

Positive review: Does what it says in the ticket description. Everything I tried works, except some things that already fail for existing cases (like quartic forms), which are results deeper bugs and should be fixed in a separate ticket. Nothing I tried gives incorrect results as far as I can see. Documentation looks good. Patchbot says all tests pass except some optional magma doctests that are unrelated to the ticket and that apparently fail on other tickets as well.
