# Issue 19172: Require prec >= 0 when creating power series

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: pbruin

Original creation time: 2015-10-14 16:06:57

Keywords: power series precision

Power series with negative precision are meaningless, but Sage currently allows creating these:

```
sage: R.<x> = PowerSeriesRing(ZZ)
sage: R(1, prec=-5)
O(x^-5)
```

Furthermore, the default precision for power series rings is allowed to be negative, leading to errors in subsequent computations:

```
sage: R.<x> = PowerSeriesRing(ZZ, default_prec=-5)
sage: ~(1+x)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: N (=-5) must be a positive integer
```
