This is extremely annoying, since apparently the result of the computation was available at that point, and it was only sorting the result which failed. Neither the unsorted result nor the triangular decomposition had been cached, throwing away 8 hours worth of computation. So I suggest

1. wrap that sorting into a try-except block to return the result unsorted if there is any problem sorting things.
2. perhaps provide a switch to disable sorting up front, since repeated exactification might cost time.
3. Try to work out why exactly the comparison fails here, and avoid this error in the first place.

The system of equations in this exact form was written by someone else, so I'll have to either reproduce this with my own (equivalent) system or request permission to post that code. In any case, it's rather lengthy.

I'll also try to run the code on a modified sage which simply disables the sort in order to get my hands on the bare QQbar descriptions behind the failed computation.

Replying to [comment:1 jdemeyer]:
> Please mention the version of Sage, in particular whether or not #15767 was applied.

This was sage 6.3 on Gentoo. With current develop (6.4.beta2) at least it doesn't fail as “quickly”: where the previous computation was 8 hours all in all up to the exception, my patched version without sorting took 7½ hours to compute the list, and after that sage has now been busy sorting that list for 1½ hours and still isn't done. I'll report back when it is, or when it gave up, but I'd say some need for action remains, even if the exception no longer occurs in this form.

Here is a reproducing example which at least demonstrates that comparisons take *way* longer than they should:


```
sage: r = QQ[x](69721504*x^8 + 251777664*x^6 + 329532012*x^4 + 184429548*x^2 + 37344321).roots(QQbar, False)
sage: r

 -0.0221204634374360? + 1.090991904211621?*I,

 0.0221204634374360? + 1.090991904211621?*I]
sage: [r[0], r[1]].sort()
```


This is because the comparison of the real parts takes like forever. Which in turn is because the computation of its minimal polynomial takes forever.

Looking at the set of all zeros, I can see that there are 4 clearly distinct real parts, and each comes with a pair of conjugate solutions since the polynomial has real coefficients. This is enough to conclude that if the intervals for two real parts overlap, then they must be equal and I don't have to do an exact computation for this. Should we try to implement some of this reasoning as a special case for `AlgebraicNumber.__cmp__`, for the case where the descriptor is exact and the minpoly is the same?

Here is my first stab at the approach outlined in comment:3. If you have a nicer way to handle things, feel free to suggest an alternative. If you think that my special case should not call `minpoly()` but instead examine whether the descriptor is `ANRoot` with matching polynomial, please state your reason for this argument. Likewise, if you think I should also handle more than one real value or conjugate pair for a given real component, then I'd love to hear how you'd implement this without making the code too hard to read and maintain.

As it is, I consider my code not particularly beautiful, and perhaps not the best solution either, but it is *way* better than the current state of affairs, and since we have other things depending on this, e.g. #14239, I'd like to see this merged pretty soon and possible improvements dealt with in a later ticket.

Hello,

This improvement is really cool!

EDIT: the thing below is basically one part of [comment:9 comment:9]...

Couldn't we do a little bit better? In some cases we might identify numerically pairs of conjugated roots (and possibly one real root) and still be able to decide which one is which. There exists polynomials whose roots have the same real part:

```
sage: x = polygen(ZZ)
sage: P = x^4 - 4*x^3 + 9*x^2 - 10*x + 5
sage: P.roots(CC,False)
[1.00000000000000 - 1.61803398874989*I,
 1.00000000000000 - 0.618033988749895*I,
 1.00000000000000 + 0.618033988749895*I,
 1.00000000000000 + 1.61803398874989*I]
```

With the implementation proposed in this ticket, the comparison of the roots of the above polynomial falls back to the generic implementation. We could at least compare the conjugated ones without exactification of the real part. But we can leave that for a further ticket.

Up to now I had assumed that most arithmetic in QQbar would eventually be performed using resultants. But it seems I was mistaken.
