I don't read Farsi, but it builds correctly and looks good in the HTML. Thanks for this contribution!

However, trying to build the PDF documentation:

```

So this needs more work before it can be merged.

At a quick glance it doesn't look like Sphinx supports Farsi text in its LaTeX builder, but I'm not an expert. Is `\usepackage{babel}` supposed to be good enough, or do we need to use `\usepackage[farsi]{babel}`?

Seems likely, unless we were to go xetex.  Of course, maybe numbering won't really matter in such a small document?  It could be worth testing out, at least.
