# Issue 25917: Omit period when printing real numbers in scientific notation with 1 digit

Issue created by migration from Trac.

This output looks unnatural:

```
sage: 1e100.str(digits=1)
'1.e100'
```

The `.` is superfluous because the `e` already indicates that this is a floating point number.

```
+        With one digit, the decimal point is displayed unless we are
+        using scientific notation::
```


This should be made more precise, e.g. `When ``digits!`` is at least one, ...` and mentioned up where the option `digits` is introduced. Then hopefully Sage's behavior would be less surprising for users more familiar with other [conventions for digit printing in the presence of decimal points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Significant_figures#Significant_figures_rules_explained).

Otherwise, looks good!

I made the docs slightly more precise. If you think that this is not sufficient, could you give _concrete_ suggestions for improvements?

I certainly don't want to add too much to "up where the option digits is introduced": the `INPUT` block is meant to give a quick idea of the various options, not to explain all corner cases.
