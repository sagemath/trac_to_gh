Some blank lines in examples of class definitions
in `combinat/combinatorial_map.py`,
`combinat/free_module.py`,
`matrix/matrix_space.py`,
`sets/recursively_enumerated_set.pyx`
could arguably be kept.
Removing them works too.

pyflakes warns `local variable 'B' is assigned to but never used`
in `src/sage/modules/fp_graded/free_module.py:679:9`.

That is not from the changes made here. It can be addressed elsewhere.
