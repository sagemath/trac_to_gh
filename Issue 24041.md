# Issue 24041: Simplify RingHomset_generic.__call__

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: jdemeyer

Whenever `RingHomset_generic.__call__` fails, it gives a meaningless error message "images do not define a valid homomorphism". In this branch, we instead simply propagate the error message from the actual code, which is typically much more interesting.
