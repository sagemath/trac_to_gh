CC:  swewers

Currently,

```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^3+6)
sage: v = QQ.valuation(2).extension(K)
sage: R.<x> = K[]
sage: w = GaussValuation(R, v).augmentation(x, 1/123)
sage: K.<x> = FunctionField(K)
sage: w = w.extension(K)
sage: w.element_with_valuation(122/123)
x^122
sage: w.element_with_valuation(1)
x^123
```


Of course `2/x` and `2` would be much better choices here.
