It turns out that, together with #23821, honoring `check` *is* useful:

without this patch:

```
sage: FB = BinaryTrees(421, full=True)
sage: b = FB.random_element()
sage: %timeit FB(b)
100 loops, best of 3: 14.7 ms per loop
sage: %timeit FB(b, check=False)
100 loops, best of 3: 14.6 ms per loop
```

with this patch:

```
sage: FB = BinaryTrees(421, full=True)
sage: b = FB.random_element()
sage: %timeit FB(b)
100 loops, best of 3: 14.4 ms per loop
sage: %timeit FB(b, check=False)
10000 loops, best of 3: 26.9 Âµs per loop
```

So, the additional checks would actually kill the gain obtained by #23821.
