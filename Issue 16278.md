Keywords: RDF RealDoubleField float NaN equal number

Any number in RealDoubleField compares equal to Python's floating-point NaN (which is not even true of NaN itself):


```
sage: nan = float('nan')
sage: RDF(123) == nan
True
sage: nan == nan
False
```


This bit me quite easily: I used a Python script that converted a number to RDF (imported from Sage) to take advantage of a built-in method, did more calculations with it, and checked if the result was NaN. It always was.

Ah, I had not noticed that this was not specific to Python floats:


```
sage: RDF(123) == RDF(NaN)
True
```
