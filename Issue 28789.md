Tested on macOS, test suite in `src/matrix` passes.

Fixes #29005.

I'm also on OS X. Both packages pass their test suites, and `make ptestlong` succeeds. Doesn't fix #28944 or #28970, unfortunately, but that is not an obstacle to a positive review here.

thsi should be fixing  #28944 and #28970

Again, on OS X they both pass their test suites and `make ptestlong` succeeds. Looks good to me. If someone can confirm on another platform or two, then positive review.

I'd bump up the package version to indicate it's got a patch


---

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2020-01-21 10:46:59

How should this be addressed in spkg-configure?


---

Comment by dimpase created at 2020-01-21 10:57:36

good question. e.g. we can tolerate buggy versions. or not.

I've asked upstream to make a new release. With it in place it will be easy to detect a good version.
