CC:  @tscrim

Currently the application of ring homomorphisms from multivariate Laurent polynomial rings fails:

```
sage: L.<x,y> = LaurentPolynomialRing(ZZ)
sage: M.<u,v> = LaurentPolynomialRing(ZZ)
sage: phi = L.hom([u,v])
sage: phi(x)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
NotImplementedError:
```

The reason is that method `_im_gens_` has not been implemented in that special case. This will be included by the ticket!
