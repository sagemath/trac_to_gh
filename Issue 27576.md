# Issue 27576: Implement _im_gens_ for LaurentPolynomial_mpair

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27813

Original creator: soehms

Original creation time: 2019-05-11 17:42:10

CC:  tscrim

Currently the application of ring homomorphisms from multivariate Laurent polynomial rings fails:


```
sage: L.<x,y> = LaurentPolynomialRing(ZZ)
sage: M.<u,v> = LaurentPolynomialRing(ZZ)
sage: phi = L.hom([u,v])
sage: phi(x)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
NotImplementedError:
```


The reason is that method `_im_gens_` has not been implemented in that special case. This will be included by the ticket!

Moving tickets from the Sage 8.8 milestone that have been actively worked on in the last six months to the next release milestone (optimistically).

Thanks and sorry, Travis! My fix with respect to #26105 was a little bit to quick and stupid. I think it is due to the usage of generic keywords, that the doctests didn't detect this. So they dazzled us both!  Can you please have a look at it again?

Minor docfix:

```diff
-        TESTS::
+        TESTS:
 
-        check compatibility with  :trac:`26105`:
+        check compatibility with  :trac:`26105`::
```

once done, you can set a positive review on my behalf.
