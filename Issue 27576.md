Currently the application of ring homomorphisms from multivariate Laurent polynomial rings fails:


```
sage: L.<x,y> = LaurentPolynomialRing(ZZ)
sage: M.<u,v> = LaurentPolynomialRing(ZZ)
sage: phi = L.hom([u,v])
sage: phi(x)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
NotImplementedError:
```


The reason is that method `_im_gens_` has not been implemented in that special case. This will be included by the ticket!

Thanks and sorry, Travis! My fix with respect to #26105 was a little bit to quick and stupid. I think it is due to the usage of generic keywords, that the doctests didn't detect this. So they dazzled us both!  Can you please have a look at it again?
