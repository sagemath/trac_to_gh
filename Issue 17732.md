Helloooooo !

I just wanted to bring to your attention that we can now include pictures easily in Sage's doc. Just in case you would find it useful for this tutorial. The methods is explained there:

I would try to use the comment of Nathan to put images in the tutorial, I'm working on it currently.

Unfortunately, I believe adding tikz code to the documentation deserves more work than fulfilling the actual ticket. Therefore, I simply reverted to the previous version.

You may want to have a look at my try within the version "2d3f871". This was producing a picture when building the doc(!) and then putting the .py code in the .html. This is not really what is desired, but was a try.

I believe this thread in sage devel is perhaps good about this:

For now, including tikz code in the doc should deserve its own ticket I guess...

Looks good to me. And very useful ! I have already used that at least twice using intructions on your web pages, and it is good to make it available as a tutorial.

If you agree with my review commit (small changes mainly), then please set to positive review.
