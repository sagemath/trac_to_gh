Unfortunately, I believe adding tikz code to the documentation deserves more work than fulfilling the actual ticket. Therefore, I simply reverted to the previous version.

You may want to have a look at my try within the version "2d3f871". This was producing a picture when building the doc(!) and then putting the .py code in the .html. This is not really what is desired, but was a try.

I believe this thread in sage devel is perhaps good about this:

https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/qR2t4LunLJg

For now, including tikz code in the doc should deserve its own ticket I guess...

Looks good to me. And very useful ! I have already used that at least twice using intructions on your web pages, and it is good to make it available as a tutorial.
