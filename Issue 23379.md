I saw this happen once:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "memory.pxd", line 117, in cysignals.memory.check_malloc (build/cythonized/sage/matrix/matrix_integer_dense.c:51851)
MemoryError: failed to allocate 1564152576 bytes
Exception MemoryError: MemoryError('failed to allocate 1564152576 bytes',) in 'sage.matrix.matrix_integer_dense.fmpz_mat_to_mpz_array' ignored
```
