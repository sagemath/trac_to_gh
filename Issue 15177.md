This patch removes a copy of a paragraph that appears twice in numerical.knapsack, adds some backticks from place to place and solver/verbose optional arguments to the `knapsack` function.

Hmm... "usefulnesss" is certainly wrong. I'd suggest "usefulnesses", but of course this is not in the dictionary. Any native speaker to the rescue?

Building the docs, I get


```
[numerical] /home/dfl/sage/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/numerical/knapsack.py:
docstring of  sage.numerical.knapsack:34: WARNING: Bullet list ends without a blank line;
unexpected unindent.
```


But I really don't understand what it is complaining about. The docstring looks good to me around line 34.

`sage.numerical.mip.MixedIntegerLinearProgram.solve` says the parameter `solver` is deprecated. It'd be better to only leave the link to `sage.numerical.mip.MixedIntegerLinearProgram`, where the `solver` parameter to the class is documented.

Ok, last one. Shouldn't the default value for `verbose` be `None`? This looks more coherent with the doc of `solve`.

Allllllllll right ! I fixed them all by updating my commit. Except for your comment about "verbose". This variable has levels which can be integers, so 0 makes sense `:-)`

You rewrote history! I saw it, you did it! `(`not that I really care `:)`

I don't know how you fixed the warning, but you sure did! I have no more objections, let it go!

Yooooooo !!

There was ONE space missing at the beginning of the line 


```
to 0 by default, which means quiet.
```


And now that history is rewritten, you may know it but you will never be able to prove it. And soon you will forget....

AHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAAAAAAAAAAA !!!
