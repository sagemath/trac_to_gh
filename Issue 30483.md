Does this currently fail with Xcode 12? The summary mentions it but not the description.

It's what I have gathered from the tickets but I have not verified it myself. The GH Actions workflows prior to this ticket have only tested standard packages with Xcode 12, but not optional packages.

This seems to fix it for the gcc 10 platforms (for example `debian-bullseye` - https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/1206658827).

No results regarding Xcode 12 from GH Actions because the homebrew package installation fails and the build does not even start (https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/1206657776)

This would benefit from local testing on macOS with Xcode 12...

I thusly approve the 1st four commits - I tested them.

I don't have a working install of XCode 12 now, as I updated by macOS to version 11, and the hell is breaking looser with each new beta there (I guess I can roll back to macOS 10.15...)

OK, I have taken out the GH Actions fix, to be revisited on another ticket.
Let's get this in.

That's #30726

For what it's worth, `gap_packages` fails for me with Xcode 12, with the usual sort of error:

```
gcc -c -O -fno-builtin gpd.c 
gpd.c:37:7: error: implicit declaration of function 'gpprog' is invalid in C99 [-Werror,-Wimplicit-function-declaration]
  if (gpprog()== -1) exit(1);
      ^
1 error generated.
```

That happens with or without this branch.

Thanks for testing. Let's take care of Xcode 12 on a follow-up ticket then
