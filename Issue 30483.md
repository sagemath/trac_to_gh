No results regarding Xcode 12 from GH Actions because the homebrew package installation fails and the build does not even start (https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/1206657776)

For what it's worth, `gap_packages` fails for me with Xcode 12, with the usual sort of error:

```
gcc -c -O -fno-builtin gpd.c 
gpd.c:37:7: error: implicit declaration of function 'gpprog' is invalid in C99 [-Werror,-Wimplicit-function-declaration]
  if (gpprog()== -1) exit(1);
      ^
1 error generated.
```
That happens with or without this branch.
