# Issue 32147: make some AdditiveAbelianGroupWrapper methods visible

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/32384

Original creator: lorenz

Original creation time: 2021-08-16 07:15:27

CC:  roed davidloeffler

Keywords: abelian group wrapper, visibility, documentation

Since #23940 we have a reasonably good implementation of logarithms for (finite) `AdditiveAbelianGroupWrapper`s, but the method is still named `_discrete_log` and therefore hidden from the public.

This patch removes the leading underscore. While I was at it, I also removed the underscore from `discrete_exp` and did a couple smaller things to improve the documentation of that class in general, so that it hopefully looks a little bit less like an obscure internal helper class.

Stalled in `needs_review` or `needs_info`; likely won't make it into Sage 9.5.

You should doctest the deprecations to check that calling `_discrete_log`/`_discrete_exp` still works. The test could go in the `TESTS` section of respectively `discrete_log`/`discrete_exp`. Otherwise it looks good.

Thank you, done.

Given that you did not change a single line in the code, it seems a bit overstated to put yourself as the single author of the function

```diff
+        AUTHORS:
+
+        - Lorenz Panny (2017)
```

But I actually _am_ the author of that code! I wrote it in 2017. See #23940 and in particular commit `9a96ea10e0`.

This is confusing :)

Could you add a copyright banner to the file, it seems to be missing ? (you can have a look at almost any file in the sage source code)

Done.

To be complete, you could have mentioned `2021 Lorenz Panny` in the copyright header. This information is more relevant than the autorship (that could be anyway tracked down via git). It does not matter much.

Changing status from needs_review to positive_review.

My impression from looking at other files was that the copyright header usually only named the person who first created the file, hence why I did it like that. Of course, that's kind of a strange practice in itself... In any case, it should already be clear enough (e.g. from the top-level LICENSE.txt) that Sage is under GPL, so none of this should matter indeed.

Thanks for reviewing!
