# Issue 31250: Vector space complement over GF(2) gives incorrect result

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31487

Here's a minimal example:


```
ambient = VectorSpace(GF(2), 3)
subspace = ambient.subspace([[1,1,1], [0,0,1]])
subspace_complement = subspace.complement()
subspace + subspace_complement == ambient    # This returns False!
```


Of course, by definition, a subspace and its complement should always sum to the ambient space. Note that this also fails silently.

Moving to 9.4, as 9.3 has been released.
