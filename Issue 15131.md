Following the discussion at https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/tyAxhqxk3ZI/SuBg2Ukwwj4J

I was about to say what this patch does, then noticed that it would naturally appear on the ticket as the commit messages of the new branch `:-)`

The reference manual page for groups looks like it could be reordered and made cleaner, but I know so few about groups that I am sure I would do it all wrong if I gave it a try `^^;`
