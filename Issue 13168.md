 File "/home/punarbasu/Installations/sage-5.2.trac/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/plot/graphics.py", line 1972, in _matplotlib_tick_formatter
    raise ValueError('Either expand the range of the independent '
ValueError: Either expand the range of the independent variable to allow two different integer powers of your `base`, or change your `base` to a smaller number.
