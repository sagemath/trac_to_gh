The summary. The problem is a simply a missing `abs()` function. Example:

```
plot(x,1,10).show(scale='loglog', xmin=10, xmax=1)

 File "/home/punarbasu/Installations/sage-5.2.trac/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/plot/graphics.py", line 1972, in _matplotlib_tick_formatter
    raise ValueError('Either expand the range of the independent '
ValueError: Either expand the range of the independent variable to allow two different integer powers of your `base`, or change your `base` to a smaller number.
```

You are probably interested in this patch. Not sure how I missed it in #4529 :)

The issue as described seems orthogonal to #13340.  Are you saying it's fixed there?  I wouldn't say invalid so much as a dup then.

Ok. A dupe then. It is fixed way more cleanly in #13422.

In the future, if you perceive an obvious dup, you can set the milestone as I have and make it positive review so that the release manager sees it.
