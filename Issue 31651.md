I'm not sure what the difference between my setup and everybody elses, but without this, only the extensions and top level .py files are installed and .py files in submodules are not installed.

`src/setup.py` is used by the Sage distribution only when `configure --enable-editable`  has been used, which has not seen much testing yet.

For distribution packaging, use `build/pkgs/sagelib/src/setup.py`
