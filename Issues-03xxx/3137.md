I have never seen that before.

The use of xdvi is hardcoded in

sage/misc/latex.py

so the answer is I guess to change this and submit a patch
or make it a trac ticket.   It's reasonable to consider this
a bug, since view should I think just use the OS X open
command as defined in sage/misc/viewer.py, i.e., use
whatever is the default opener for a dvi file on your system.

It's hardcoded xdvi right now since that was some of the first
sage code I ever wrote and that was long before I ported
Sage to run on OS X...

This has annoyed me for a while now so I fixed it to use the sage/misc/viewer.py helper file to determine the correct viewer. 

Please test on Linux (only tested on OS X).

Works for me on my linux box.  I'm using some version of Red Hat; perhaps people using other linux distributions should test it on their machines, too.
