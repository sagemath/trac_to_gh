<a id='comment:3'>**Comment 3:**</a>
Patch applies fine to 3.1.1.  Doctests for the new file pass.

Problem:  doctesting all in sage/modular, some strange errors appear in modular/abvar to do with latex.  They went away when I deleted the line "... import latex" in the new file, which is not actually used anyway.

In the constructor, in checking Ligozat, you loop over divisors of N.  Would it not be faster to loop over the keys in the dict?  There is then no need to factor N, or to look at (however briefly) the divisors which are not in the dict.

There is something similar at line 146.  Instead of 

```
 eta_n = max([ (n/d).floor() for d in divisors(self.level()) if self.r(d) != 0])
```
you could write 

```
 eta_n = max([ (n/d).floor() for d in self.r().keys()]) 
```

If you really wanted to have the full list of divisors of the level around, you could compute it and cache the result in the constructor.

In the function r(d) you can just say

```
   return self._rdict.get(d,0)
```
since the get function on a dict returns the value if the key is there or a default value (here 0) if not.

That's all I have time for now: I got as far as line 235 (def basis_eta_products).

**Attachment:** [10294.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket3934/10294.patch.gz)

Review summary:  This is a great piece of work, especially after the second patch.  I have made a few changes, detailed below, which are in the 3rd patch.

* I changed the type-checking of the level parameter so that it forces it to be a Sage integer.  This is a good idea since some integer methods would not work if the level was a Python integer, and it also allows you to say `EtaGroup_class(4/2)` should you ever want to.

* docstring for EtaGroup_class.basis() had a spurious redundant INPUT line (N)

* I added a little more type and value checking of parameters

* In  eta_poly_relations there is a lot of output which cannot be turned off.   Why not include a parameter verbose, default False, and only print the output if it is True?  I put this in and changed the doctests accordingly.

* I commented out the NotImplemented plot function, as it seemed pointless to have it!

Coverage test gives this:

```
 ./sage -coverage devel/sage-eta/sage/modular/etaproducts.py 

devel/sage-eta/sage/modular/etaproducts.py
ERROR: Please define a s == loads(dumps(s)) doctest.
SCORE devel/sage-eta/sage/modular/etaproducts.py: 74% (23 of 31)

Missing documentation:
	 * __init__(self, level)
	 * _repr_(self)
	 * __call__(self, dict)
	 * __init__(self, parent, rdict)
	 * __cmp__(self, other)
	 * __eq__(self, other)
	 * _short_repr(self)
	 * _eta_relations_helper(eta1, eta2, degree, qexp_terms, labels, verbose)


Possibly wrong (function name doesn't occur in doctests):
	 * _mul_(self, other)
	 * _div_(self, other)
	 * _repr_(self)
	 * _repr_(self)
```
I have never been sure about the loads(dumps) message.  Apart from that all functions which are not preceded by an underscore have docstrings and doctests, which is the main thing:  it would be better if they had a little documentation, but then you'll get the complaint that they should also have doctests.


Conclusion:  I am very happy with this, but it would be even better if someone who knows a lot more about eta products (such as Ken McMurdy) could put it through its paces.

Excellent!  I just checked that the sequence of 4 patches applies cleanly to 3.1.3.alpha0, and all tests in sage/modular pass.

Let it roll: even if Ken McMurdy suggests changes and additions, why not merge this now?

I'll inform Lloyd, Gabor and Lassina about this once it is merged, since it sefinitely a success story coming out of their August workshop.
