Release notes:
* New stage 2 for P-1 and P+1, described in Montgomery and Kruppa,
  Improved Stage 2 to P+-1 Factoring Algorithms,
  in A. J. van der Poorten and A. Stein (Eds.), ANTS-VIII 2008,
  LNCS 5011, pp. 180-195.
* Parallelization in the new P+-1 stage 2 (with --enable-openmp).
* Optimizations to the NTT code by Jason S. Papadopoulos
* Improved mulredc assembly code for Athlon64/Opteron
* Improved modular reduction in the mpzmod range
* Bugfix in P+1 stage 2 which caused incorrect initialisation if
  Brent-Suyama polynomial had degree > 1 and i0 was negative (occurs
  only with non-standard parameters)
* Bugfix in generation of Lucas chains for P+1 and ECM, causing some
  stage 1 primes close to 2^32 to be processed incorrectly on 32 bit
  systems
* Added build project for VC++ by Brian Gladman
* File ecm.h changed from GPL to LGPL: the fact it was under GPL was an
  unvoluntary mistake, which has the consequence that applications
  linking with libecm for version < 6.2 should be under GPL too.
* Fixed a regression introduced in 6.1.1: the default arithmetic (NTT)
  for stage 2 was slower for large inputs. Now defaults to -no-ntt for
  input numbers >30 machine words.

A new patch release 6.2.1 out. To quote:

```
we consider a patch release (6.2.1) to fix a few issues in 6.2:

* the default B2 bound is way too small for the new P-1/P+1 algorithms
* on some architectures, ecm-6.2 fails to compile due to undefined
  udiv_qrnnd_preinv(). We will define LONGLONG_STANDALONE before including
  longlong.h (this might slow down some architectures like HPPA, but we didn't
  figure out a simple patch for now)
```

Cheers,

Michael

Man, this ticket has gone stale, so I will hopefully fix it soon.

Anyway: Paul, I have been seeing the following on occasion in Sage 3.x for a while:

```

What happens is that find factors is given as input the prime factor 251...843 (I don't know why).
Of course ECM takes a long time to factor it! It seems some primality test is missing (or wrong):

```
enter find_factor, n= 6695575184412459481424842051421510843842512474094970147089
