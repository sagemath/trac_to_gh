Right now we have

```
      \item[clang] may be either c or c++ indicating whether a C or
                   C++ compiler should be used

      \item[clib] additional libraries to be linked in, the space
                  separated list is split and passed to distutils.

      \item[cinclude] additional directories to search for header
                      files. The space separated list is split and
                      passed to distutils.
```
and we need

```
      \item[clibinclude] additional directories to search for library
                      files. The space separated list is split and
                      passed to distutils.
