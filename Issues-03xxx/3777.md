This input to the notebook results in pain:

```
html('<script>alert("</script>");</script>')
```

This should only be looked at after #3735 is applied.  Then look at this code in 
cell.py

```
        if ncols == 0:
            while True:
                i = t.lower().find('<script>')
                if i == -1: break
                j = t[i:].lower().find('</script>')
                if j == -1: break
                t = t[:i] + t[i+j+len('</script>'):]
                
```
and also `function eval_script_tags(text)` in js.py.
