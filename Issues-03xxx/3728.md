I don't think that the current documentation for solving matrix equations is sufficient, so I've added a little bit in the "linear algebra" section of the guided tour in the tutorial.

I tried to apply the patch but was unable to:

```
sage: hg_sage.apply("/home/john/3728.patch")
cd "/home/john/sage-3.0.4/devel/sage" && hg status
cd "/home/john/sage-3.0.4/devel/sage" && hg status
cd "/home/john/sage-3.0.4/devel/sage" && hg import   "/home/john/3728.patch"
applying /home/john/3728.patch
abort: unable to find tut/tut.tex or tut/tut.tex for patching
```

I'm not sure if that is my fault or the patch's.

Secondly, why not include the abbreviated form :

```
sage: A\z
(-2, 1, 0)
```

Of course this is otherwise a useful addition to the tutorial.

For the first item, try `hg_doc.apply` instead of `hg_sage.apply`.  The second is a good idea, and I'll submit a new patch including something relevant.

(a few minutes later)

Having tried to including something about backslashes, I find that I can't include lines like

```
\begin{verbatim}
sage: A \ Y
(-2, 1, 0)
\end{verbatim}
```
because the `\` in the verbatim environment seems to mess up the doctesting, leading to a failure.  Right now I have a compromise situation, discussing the backslash in the text, without including a testable example.  Looks like we might need a trac ticket for fixing the doctesting...

Here's what I do: 

```
cd ...sage/devel/doc
make tut
```
Then you can use the notebook interface and click on the "Help" button at the top right to get the new version.

In addition to 'make tut', you can also do `make paper-letter/tut.pdf` or `make paper-a4/tut.pdf`, which creates those pdf files (.../sage/devel/doc/paper-letter/tut.pdf, for example).

David,

I keep getting this as well and it bugs the heck out of me.  But I can work around it by typing the following in the devel/doc directory:

```
ghitza@artin:/opt/sage/devel/doc$ hg qnew -f stupid.patch
```

(You can give the patch your favorite name that you're unlikely to use.)

Then the annoying diff's that you got above will go away and you can happily apply doc patches.  I wish someone got rid of the problem altogether, but for now this should work.

John, I've looked at the patch and it seems ok to me; it also passes sage -t.  Unfortunately, latex fonts are broken on my ubuntu machine so I can't do build_pdf or build_dvi to look at the typeset version.  I will try to build 3.1.2.alpha4 on my gentoo machine and apply your patch there, but it might take a while.  Hopefully this will have gotten a positive review by then.
