Carlo,

I have nuked the bundles. Not knowing the subject at hand I will not comment on chlatin.patch, but chlatindocs.patch looks good. The first hunk in the last patch will be removed when applying it, so don't worry about that for now.

Mike: Can you be the editor for this?

Cheers,

Michael

With the exception of patchlevel.tex as Michael noted, everything else looks good to me.  The sage-main tests applies and passes tests, and the documentation builds with both patches applied.
