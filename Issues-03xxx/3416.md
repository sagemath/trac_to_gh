Implement transformations to put a general cubic (with a point) into Weierstrass form:

```
sage: R.<u,v,w> = QQ[]
sage: EllipticCurve(u^3+v^3+w^3, [1,-1,0])   
Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 + 2*x*y - 1/3*y = x^3 - x^2 + 1/3*x - 1/27 over Rational Field
sage: EllipticCurve_from_cubic(u^3+v^3+w^3, [1,-1,0])
Scheme morphism:
  From: Closed subscheme of Projective Space of dimension 2 over Rational Field defined by:
  u^3 + v^3 + w^3
  To:   Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 + 2*x*y - 1/3*y = x^3 - x^2 + 1/3*x - 1/27 over Rational Field
  Defn: Defined on coordinates by sending (u : v : w) to
        (w : -v - w : -3*u - 3*v)
```
Also, Jacobians (without specifying point):

```
sage: R.<u,v,w> = QQ[]
sage: Jacobian(u^3+v^3+w^3)
Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 = x^3 - 27/4 over Rational Field
sage: Jacobian(u^3+v^3+w^3, morphism=True)
Scheme morphism:
  From: Projective Curve over Rational Field defined by u^3 + v^3 + w^3
  To:   Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 = x^3 - 27/4 over Rational Field
  Defn: Defined on coordinates by sending (u : v : w) to
        (u*v^7*w + u*v^4*w^4 + u*v*w^7 : v^9 + 3/2*v^6*w^3 - 3/2*v^3*w^6 - w^9 : -v^6*w^3 - v^3*w^6)

Henri Cohen writes (2010-08-12):

```
Concerning the formulas for a general cubic in my first book, the situation is precisely the following:

1) They were directly copied from an APECS script written by Ian Connell.

2) The final Weirstrass equation is correct, as is the transformation from
the cubic coordinates to the Weierstrass ones. On the other hand, the reverse
transformation has a mistake, which I never took time to find, should be easy
(it may be the other way round).

3) This is in my errata sheets. In my more recent books, I indicate that there is indeed a
mistake, and explain the algorithm (well-known of course), in less detail with no explicit
formulas, so that a student should be able to reconstruct them.
```
This suggests that very minor corrections are all that is required.

I have found that the descriptions in:

Cassels, J. W. S. Lectures on elliptic curves. London Mathematical Society Student Texts, 24. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1991.

give excellent recipes for writing down isomorphisms from cubics, y!^2=quartic and intersections of two quadrics in P!^2 with a rational point to their Jacobians in weierstrass form.

The alternative method of writing down maps of degrees 3, 2, 4 (respectively) to their Jacobians using invariant theory (see Tom Fisher et al.) often results in nicer models, because there are less arbitrary choices to be made.

Thanks for the advice. I will browse through the suggested literature to find the most convenient way of implementing cubic to Weierstrass. I plan to finish this before the end of August.

If I have more time I will try some quartics and see whether I can get the nicer formulas using J-invariants.

Here is my first ever Sage patch: 14532.patch. It creates an elliptic curve from any homogeneous cubic. The cubic is transformed to Weierstrass, and birational maps between the equations are given. The case y<sup>2</sup> = quartic is not covered.

The patch is based upon Sage 4.4.4.

The used transformations are from Section 4.4 of the course notes: "G1CRPC: Rational Points on Curves", which I uploaded as cnotes.pdf.

Please review my patch, and provide extensive feedback.

The patch is there, so please review it!  The example I used there is one of the examples from the patch here.

Replacing the curve E used there with

```

sage: E=EllipticCurve([0,0,0,0,-6400/3])
sage: H=C.Hom(E)
sage: f = H([zbar,xbar-ybar,-(xbar+ybar)/80])
sage: f
Scheme morphism:
  From: Projective Curve over Rational Field defined by x^3 + y^3 + 60*z^3
  To:   Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 = x^3 - 6400/3 over Rational Field
  Defn: Defined on coordinates by sending (x : y : z) to
        (zbar : xbar - ybar : -1/80*xbar - 1/80*ybar)
```
successfully defines the morphism.  I recommend that the function here just returns the morphism, since one can recover E from

```
sage: f.codomain()
Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 = x^3 - 6400/3 over Rational Field
```

This will not be the end of the story, as I now cannot apply f to a point on C to get a point on E, but that's because of another difficulty like the one at #10297, so should be fixed separately.

The example you give almost works. However, the map f sending (x : y : z) to (zbar : xbar - ybar : -1/80*xbar - 1/80*ybar) is the inverse of the map we are looking for. The map f is from the Elliptic Curve defined by y<sup>2</sup> = x<sup>3</sup> - 6400/3 to the Curve defined by x<sup>3</sup> + y<sup>3</sup> + 60*z<sup>3</sup>, not the other way around.

I would like to include both the map f and its inverse f<sup>-1</sup> as (optional) output. Also, it would be nice to include the projective scaling necessary after the rational transformation. Unfortunately, the map f<sup>-1</sup> from "x<sup>3</sup> + y<sup>3</sup> + 60*z<sup>3</sup>" to "y<sup>2</sup> - x<sup>3</sup> + 6400/3" is not homogeneous:

x -> 1/2*y - 40

y -> -1/2*y - 40

z -> x

Then multiply the equation with 1/60.

The map f is homogeneous, but I'm not sure I can get a homogeneous f<sup>-1</sup> from there.

I suggest that I include the morphisms as an optional tuple of strings. Does anyone have a better suggestion?

I now have the morphisms as optional output, which defaults to False. The output uses print statements, because I still cannot find a better form for the general non-homogeneous morphisms. I tried using strings instead, but adding a polynomial to a string did not work.

I hope this solution is okay for now. If anyone has a better suggestion for the representation, I will be happy to update my patch, or repatch it.

I am writing my own documentation about the transformation from cubic to Weierstrass. I will upload it within the next few days.

I think I spotted a minor error in my patch. When P is not a flex, the program finds a second point P2 using the chord and tangent method. However, if P2 is a flex, I think the program will return an error. This is a simple fix, which will be up soon.

    "body": "<div id=\"comment:27\" align=\"right\">comment:27</div>\n\nOk, here are some more comments, and a few cases where your code does not work:\n\nMost importantly: I don't like the output strings, I would definitely prefer actual `SchemeMorphism_on_points_projective_space` objects. This makes the method much more useful (as you can just evaluate these in points to transfer points between the curves). It also makes your patch much easier to review (as reviewers don't need to manually copy printed strings to test correctness of your output). I don't think this change is a lot of work: you can just feed your polynomials to E.hom, and you can find an example in the parametrization function [here](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket727/trac_727_conics_without_number_fields.patch.gz). I'm afraid it would require accepting an actual plane projective curve as input `f` instead of a polynomial. For backwards compatibility, you can change polynomials into curves when you get them as input.\n\nAnyway, here are some comments on the code as it is:\n\nIf you stick with printing: in the description of the ``equivalence`` parameter: replace \"given\" by \"*printed*\" to make clear that it is only printed, not really given as a Sage object.

Ok, here are some more comments, and a few cases where your code does not work:

Most importantly: I don't like the output strings, I would definitely prefer actual `SchemeMorphism_on_points_projective_space` objects. This makes the method much more useful (as you can just evaluate these in points to transfer points between the curves). It also makes your patch much easier to review (as reviewers don't need to manually copy printed strings to test correctness of your output). I don't think this change is a lot of work: you can just feed your polynomials to E.hom, and you can find an example in the parametrization function [here](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket727/trac_727_conics_without_number_fields.patch.gz). I'm afraid it would require accepting an actual plane projective curve as input `f` instead of a polynomial. For backwards compatibility, you can change polynomials into curves when you get them as input.

Anyway, here are some comments on the code as it is:

If you stick with printing: in the description of the ``equivalence`` parameter: replace "given" by "*printed*" to make clear that it is only printed, not really given as a Sage object. The "*"'s around "printed" make it italic for emphasis.

I would have called the "equivalence" parameter "transformation" instead.

In all your examples:

```
sage: var("x y z")
(x, y, z)
sage: R.<x,y,z>=QQ[]
sage: f=R(x^3+y^3+z^3)
```
The second input overwrites the x, y, and z of the first input, so the first two lines (one input and one output) can (and hence should) be removed. Also, `x<sup>3+y</sup>3+z^3` is already in R, so remove "R(" and ")".

I don't understand the purpose of the "Then multiply the equation with". The three substitutions already give a map in projective space, right?

Your function seems to require the variable names to be "x,y,z", this is not right:

```
sage: Q.<a,b,c>=QQ[]
sage: EllipticCurve_from_cubic(a^3+b^3+60*c^3, [1,-1,0], equivalence=True)
…
KeyError: 'y'
```

There are cases that your code cannot handle:

```
sage: P.<x,y,z> = QQ[]
sage: EllipticCurve_from_cubic(x^3+y^3+z^3, [-1,1,0])
Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 + 2*x*y + 1/3*y = x^3 - x^2 - 1/3*x - 1/27 over Rational Field
sage: EllipticCurve_from_cubic(x^3+y^3+z^3, [-1,0,1])
…
ZeroDivisionError: 
```

Nice work! Haven't tested it, but I did scan over the patch. Some remarks:

- Your examples are misleading. You call `var("x y z")` and then construct a polynomial ring. The call to `var` is irrelevant and should be removed.

- Line 578. Why don't you take R=parent(F)? In fact, why do you define R at all? I don't think you use it.

- Line 587. Don't use chord-tangent to determine if a point is a flex, but see if the hessian (determinant of the matrix of double derivatives of F) vanishes at P. That allows you to get rid of "chord_and_tangent" and of "are_projectively_equivalent" (for which you should a library routine instead of writing your own, if you really need it elsewhere. Sage's projective spaces and their points should be able to do this for you.

For the interfacing with magma:

I think you can be a little more elegant here. Consider the following example

```
R.<x,y,z>=QQ[]
f=x^3+y^3+z^3
P=(0,1,-1)
```
You can now do (and this should apply generally):

```
P2_magma=f.parent().magma().Proj()
C_magma=P2.Curve(f)
E_magma,mp_magma=C.EllipticCurve(C_magma(P),nvals=Integer(2))
E_magma.aInvariants().sage()
```
To extract the map, one would hope to be able to do

```
mp.DefiningPolynomials().sage()
```
and the fact that this fails is not really the fault of the code here. The proper solution would be to extend the coercion system to the magma interface, but that doesn't sound very appealing.

In any case, I don't think you should be hard-coding the Rationals as a base ring here and you should not be calling MinimalModel either, because you don't do that in the sage version.

---

Finally, for the transformation: Yes, return a morphism or failing that, a list of 3 homogeneous polynomials in the parent of F that would be the appropriate input for the "hom" constructor.

If you are implementing your algorithm "bare bones" (internally, you just work with polynomials and you don't use any of the scheme machinery and your input consists of a homogeneous poly rather than a plane curve) there could be some value of also making your output available "bare bones", i.e., just return the list [a1,a2,a3,a4,a6] and a list of polynomials describing the map.

There is a cost to using schemes, ambient spaces etc., so there may be a benefit in having the raw functionality available in a form that avoids it. Once you have a routine that does the heavy lifting, it's straightforward to write a wrapper that provides an interface in scheme language.

(there is also a benefit in using scheme language, so if you choose to write your code in terms of such higher level constructs, it makes little sense to wrap it to provide a "raw" interface as well)

I have no idea.  The definition there is wrong:  an elliptic curve is not just a genus 1 curve, it is a genus one curve with a specified point.  Perhaps Maple tries to find a point (it does say that the function can be speeded up by providing one), and perhaps if there is no rational point it uses something generic, or a point defined over an extension.

Someone with Maple could try the Selmer curve (of my previous post) to see what it does.

I think Maple does the same as #13458: it returns a rational multi-covering. This you can also get without a point.

Currently I don't like the way the transformation is returned in this ticket. A bunch of text, really? Can't we return concatenated maps or something that can be accessed programmatically? Or, failing that, a custom python object that can be queried for the defining polynomials.

The good news is that we seem to have all relevant algorithms implemented, we just need to settle on an interface. My suggestion would be

A constructor function EllipticCurve_from_curve(equation, point=None, proof=False)
If proof=False then just the Weierstrass form is returned using whatever algorithm is fastest (probably ignoring the given point).
If proof=True and no point is given, a pair (E,f) of elliptic curve and rational covering map from the curve to the Weierstrass form is returned.
If proof=True and a point is given, then a pair (E,f) is returned such that f is an isomorphism.
Make EllipticCurve_from_cubic an alias for EllipticCurve_from_curve. The latter will also handle e.g. y^2=quartic(x) e.g., so it shouldn't mention cubic.

I'm not thrilled about EllipticCurve_Jacobian for a few reasons:

1. Introducing a new function into the global namespace just to deprecate it later is just very, very annoying to users.  Please don't do that.  

2. Why not just "EllipticCurve(...)".  It is not ambiguous.  We have EllipticCurve_from_blah in some cases in order to resolve ambiguity, e.g., c4c6 and j.  But there is no ambiguity if a cubic polynomial is given.

3. I would prefer adding a global Jacobian function than EllipticCurve_Jacobian.  E.g., something like

```
    def Jacobian(C, **kwds):
        try:
            return C.jacobian(**kwds)
        except AttributeError:
            if its a cubic... call your code above.
```

There are genus 2 Jacobians, etc., for which typing Jacobian(C) (or Jac(C)) would be convenient. 

Maybe include Jacobian(matrix) for calculus students :-)

Thanks for all the work! I have not looked at it in detail, but do have a few comments:

>

> ZeroDivisionError: 
> ```

  That is because the code this patch is built on is incomplete (it misses a few such cases).

* There is a backwards incompatibility in `EllipticCurve_from_cubic`. Input:

  ```
  sage: P.<X,Y,Z> = QQ[]                               
  sage: EllipticCurve_from_cubic(X^3+Y^3+Z^3, [1,-1,0])
  ```
  Output: an elliptic curve without the patch, a morphism with the patch

* Why not add a "morphism" parameter to `EllipticCurve` too? That way, `EllipticCurve_from_cubic` is not needed at all. This will make the global namespace smaller (leading to smaller startup times and less confusion on which function to use when). And as an added bonus, it allows a smooth deprecation of `EllipticCurve_from_cubic`, rather than the backwards incompatibility mentioned above.

* When I do

  ```
  sage: Jacobian?
  ```
  I get 

  ```
  ...
  Source File:    /scratch/tsg250/sage-5.5.rc0/devel/sage/sage/misc/lazy_import.so
  ...
       * A polynomial, see "Jacobian_of_equation()" for details.
    
       * A curve, see "Jacobian_of_curve()" for details.
  ```
  But "`Jacobian_of_equation?`" and "`Jacobian_of_curve?`" don't work, because they are not in the global namespace. And it takes some effort to find out that

  ```
  sage: sage.schemes.elliptic_curves.jacobian.Jacobian_of_curve?

  works, unless someone first tells me that `Jacobian_of_curve` is in `sage.schemes.elliptic_curves.jacobian`.

If you want to reduce the number of global symbols, which I'm all in favor of, then one should combine the constructors into a class `EllipticCurve.from_foobar()` to disambiguate.

Whether an (iso)morphism should be returned as well applies to more than very special circumstances.

Routines are usually named after the thing they produce, so from `EllipticCurve_from_cubic` one expects an elliptic curve. `Isomorphism_from_cubic_curve_to_jacobian` would produce a morphism. Unless you claim `EllipticCurve_from_cubic` is only an internal routine, in which case it can return anything it likes.

I don't quite know how to return extra optional information. We could return a tuple with as a second value the morphism so that we get the extremely magmaesque

```
E,phi = EllipticCurve_from_cubic(x^3+y^3+z^3,[1,0,-1],morphism=True)
```
but that does mean the return type changes significantly upon supplying a keyword argument. Mandating

```
E, = EllipticCurve_from_cubic(x^3+y^3+z^3,[1,0,-1],morphism=False)
```
seems a no-go.

Another possibility (which is easy in Python) is to enhance objects with extra structure. For example,

```
sage: K.<a,b> = NumberField([x^2+1,x^3-2]); K
Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^2 + 1 over its base field
sage: L.<c> = K.absolute_field(); L
Number Field in c with defining polynomial x^6 + 3*x^4 + 4*x^3 + 3*x^2 - 12*x + 5
sage: L.structure()
(Isomorphism map:
  From: Number Field in c with defining polynomial x^6 + 3*x^4 + 4*x^3 + 3*x^2 - 12*x + 5
  To:   Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^2 + 1 over its base field, Isomorphism map:
  From: Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^2 + 1 over its base field
  To:   Number Field in c with defining polynomial x^6 + 3*x^4 + 4*x^3 + 3*x^2 - 12*x + 5)
```

In our case, we could do:

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve_from_cubic(x^3+y^3+z^3, [1,0,-1])
sage: E.extra_defining_data()
{'cubic':x^3+y^3+z^3, 'morphism':..., 'point':[1,0,-1]}
```

If the morphism gets computed, it's there; if it doesn't get computed, it isn't.
Whether or not it gets computed can be determined as you suggest

```
E = EllipticCurve_from_cubic(x^3+y^3+z^3, [1,0,-1], morphism=False)
```
BUT the input does not impact the return type -- you get an elliptic curve no matter what.

I not sure I agree with the assertion that people/algorithms will always compute the morphism.  There are alternative algorithms for computing the jacobian of a genus 1 curve that give the Jacobian without giving the morphism -- one involves computing the a_p and doing a search for curves with those a_p, and another involves "Fermionic Fock Spaces" (I think). 

To me the above proposal fits better with how one thinks in mathematics; when you construct one object from another, you might as well remember you did so, and take advantage of it. 

Another possibility would be to add a "jacobian_structure()" method to elliptic curves, which usually returns the identity map E-->E, but in the above case, returns a morphism X-->E.  More generally, it could return a simply transitive group-object, i.e., a map E x X --> X, but that's getting complicated.

I just want to point out that this is all more complicated and less discoverable than just returning the morphism. Even if the function is not called `Morphism_from_cubic_to_elliptic_curve` I think we are smart enough to guess what the result means. 

For the record, this is the current state:
* `EllipticCurve(x<sup>3+y</sup>3+z^3, [1,-1,0])` returns elliptic curve
* `EllipticCurve_from_cubic(x<sup>3+y</sup>3+z^3, [1,-1,0])` returns morphism
* `EllipticCurve_from_cubic(x<sup>3+y</sup>3+z^3, [1,-1,0], morphism=True)` returns morphism
* `EllipticCurve_from_cubic(x<sup>3+y</sup>3+z^3, [1,-1,0], morphism=False)` returns elliptic curve
* `Jacobian(x<sup>3+y</sup>3+z^3)` returns elliptic curve
* `Jacobian(x<sup>3+y</sup>3+z^3, morphism=False)` returns elliptic curve
* `Jacobian(x<sup>3+y</sup>3+z^3, morphism=True)` returns morphism (but not isomorphism)

We can always tack on defining data to the elliptic curve in another ticket, so imho the only discussion that is relevant to this ticket is whether `morphism` should default to true or false.

Aren't elliptic curves parents as well? That means they're unique. That makes it difficult to hang such information off them, because it means that all this structure information must be part of the constructor input.

The natural implementation of a lot of these constructors would be via a factory function that will punt to `EllipticCurve([a1,a2,a3,a4,a6])` to actually create the elliptic curve, so at the moment of "unique instantiation" the extra data isn't naturally available.

You can't go scribbling into fields on this elliptic curve because you risk overwriting information another constructor has already put there and which might still be relied upon elsewhere in the code.

I'm starting to doubt that having unique parents is such a good design decision. Making one of the most complex objects in your system immutable complicates a lot of things.

OK! perhaps elliptic curves provide a way out of the quagmire of uniqueness of parents:

```
sage: E=EllipticCurve([1,2,3,4,3])
sage: E([0,1,0])
(0 : 1 : 0)
sage: P=E([0,1,0])
sage: P.parent()
Abelian group of points on Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 + x*y + 3*y = x^3 + 2*x^2 + 4*x + 3 over Rational Field
```
It seems elliptic curves are parents: `E.parent()` gives an error and `E.category()` does not (although it returns a rather questionable "Category of sets", but who cares), but the example above suggest they don't actually occur as parents of elements. I guess they do occur as domains and codomains of maps, though (see `E.multiplication_by_m_isogeny(2)`).

I get doctest failures in jacobian.py.   Al else in the elliptic_curves directory pass.

Secondly,  in are_projectively_equivalent(P, Q) the function and exit with True as soon as the condition ratio[0]*p == ratio[1]*q holds, so those two lines should be replaced by

```
else return ratio[0]*p == ratio[1]*q: 
```
but I don't know why the function does not just 

```
return Matrix([P,Q]).rank() < 2 
```
?

Which doctest is failing? They all pass on my machine (also sage-5.11.beta3)

I don't have a strong preference on how `are_projectively_equivalent()` should implement the check, I just kept that from the previous patch. Constructing a matrix and computing its rank incurs some overhead but that doesn't really matter here, so the matrix version should be used.

I do not feel qualified to positively review #13458 though, so I hope this is not being inconsistent of me.

Sorry, there are some issues with these patches:

Most importantly, the doctests for `Jacobian_magma_from_plane_curve` don't actually use the function `Jacobian_magma_from_plane_curve`. So the function which is "useful for doctesting" doesn't seem to be used in any doctest.

Then some details: I would replace

```
sage: x,y,z=PolynomialRing(QQ,3,'xyz').gens()
```
by

```
sage: R.<x,y,z> = PolynomialRing(QQ,3)
```
or

```
sage: R.<x,y,z> = QQ[]
```

And also replace

```
sage: f = x**5 + 1184*x**3 + 1846*x**2 + 956*x + 560
```
by

```
sage: f = x^5 + 1184*x^3 + 1846*x^2 + 956*x + 560
```

I just did, and there are some problems, which I am now fixing.

sage: R.<x,y,z> = QQ[]

despite

The relevant line works fine by itself:

```
sage: cmd = "P<%s,%s,%s> := ProjectivePlane(RationalField());"%SR(f).variables()
sage: cmd

That's odd as I would not have expected it to be necessary to import SR for a doctest.

Anyway, that function is still wrong since 2 lines later it refers to P which I presume is a point on the curve, but there is no parameter P.  Shall we just delete this completely redundant function?

The next function `Jacobian_magma_from_plane_curve` needs a minor fix in the last line since rings is not imported.  It's fine with

```
    from sage.rings.all import QQ
    return EllipticCurve(QQ, eval(s))
