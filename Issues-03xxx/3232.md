The BKZ algorithm is a lattice reduction algorithm AFAIK only implemented in NTL. 

```
  -- BKZ: Block Korkin-Zolotarev reduction.
     This is slower, but yields a higher-quality basis,
     i.e., one with shorter vectors.
     See the Schnorr-Euchner paper for a description of this.
     This basically generalizes the LLL reduction condition
     from blocks of size 2 to blocks of larger size.
```

It enjoys more widespread use in cryptography these days and possibly other areas. Since Sage has Damien Stehle's fast fpLLL library and NTL's BKZ this would make Sage a very nice tool for people who care about these algorithms.
