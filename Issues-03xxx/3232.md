The BKZ algorithm is a lattice reduction algorithm AFAIK only implemented in NTL. 

```
  -- BKZ: Block Korkin-Zolotarev reduction.
     This is slower, but yields a higher-quality basis,
     i.e., one with shorter vectors.
     See the Schnorr-Euchner paper for a description of this.
     This basically generalizes the LLL reduction condition
     from blocks of size 2 to blocks of larger size.
```

It enjoys more widespread use in cryptography these days and possibly other areas. Since Sage has Damien Stehle's fast fpLLL library and NTL's BKZ this would make Sage a very nice tool for people who care about these algorithms.

The attached patch wraps the appropriate NTL functions. It has doctests for all new methods. However, someone more familiar with BKZ might want to add an example (possibly #long) which showcases the difference between LLL and BKZ.
