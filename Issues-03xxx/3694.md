Several issues were fixed, among them a bug that could in some rather unlikely cases cause random memory to be accessed.

The spkg is at

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mabshoff/release-cycles-3.0.6/alpha1/flint-1.0.13.spkg

Make sure to rebuild the following extension by running

```
touch devel/sage/sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_integer_dense_flint.pyx
./sage -b
```
Otherwise Sage will complain about an import error. The fix is non-trivial and needs to be coordinated with the packaging teams for Debian and Gentoo, so it is post 3.0.6 material.
