Currently it seems that the only way to get nice text between cells is to do a %html cell or to edit the worksheet directly.  Either way, you have to write html code by hand.

It would be nice if there was a %wiki cell mode, like %html, but let you put in wiki markup which would then be converted to HTML to display.

Here are some CREOLE parsers (with examples that convert to html):

wait, how do text cells enable me to use markdown syntax?

i'd like to be able to write the in-between text in markdown, run it through sage and markdown, and get a nicely-formatted html page. How could this be accomplished?

I agree-- text cells are nice, but I don't want to spend half my day pointing-and-click around to get something formatted.  Markdown allows you to format without breaking the flow of writing.
