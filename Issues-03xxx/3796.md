I almost forgot to open a ticket on this one.  I'm not sure what solution we should use, but here's the discussion from sage-devel:

wstein:
That's not right.  We use a user-writable temp directory for data interchange
with subprocesses.  Those directories were part of the early design   
of the pexpect interface, when I imagined individual users putting code
in there that would get loaded.  The interfaces can and should be redesigned
to not use/require those interfaces.  Sorry this is vague.
