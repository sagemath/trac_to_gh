Just a short comment: could you put back in the matrix() and vector() functions and add a deprecation warning for now?  That way code doesn't suddenly break.

Since you use "\code" in the docstring for vector and matrix, the docstrings need to start with r""" instead of """.  Patch attached.

I've doctested the changed files with complete success. I'm currently running `sage -testall` to make sure nothing else is screwed up by this. I'll give it a tentative positive review now while I'm thinking about it, then change it one way or the other depending on how the testing works out.
