While reading the Developer's guide update at #3905 it occurred to me that `vector()`/`matrix()` methods are supposed to be called `_vector_`/`_matrix_()` methods so that `matrix(foo)` works. The attached patch changes those functions for finite field elements.

Just a short comment: could you put back in the matrix() and vector() functions and add a deprecation warning for now?  That way code doesn't suddenly break.

Since you use "\code" in the docstring for vector and matrix, the docstrings need to start with r""" instead of """.  Patch attached.
