This patch documents the pragmas in the docstring. I also changed the behaviour of atlas() which now assumes that ATLAS is installed, since we ship it. mabshoff/wstein please check if my assumption is correct e.g. on OSX.

**Assignee:** @malb

**CC:**  @craigcitro wstein

**Keywords:** cython, documentation

I also don't know the answer to Martin's question about ATLAS -- mabshoff or wstein, do you want to answer that?
