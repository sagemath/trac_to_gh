This patch documents the pragmas in the docstring. I also changed the behaviour of atlas() which now assumes that ATLAS is installed, since we ship it. mabshoff/wstein please check if my assumption is correct e.g. on OSX.

The patch will break some functionality since SAGE_CBLAS is no longer checked.
