MPolynomialRing_libsingular in sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_libsingular.pyx defines a _repr_ method which does the same thing as the _repr_ method that it inherits from MPolynomialRing_generic in sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_ring_generic.pyx

Thus the _repr_ method is redundant and should be removed.
