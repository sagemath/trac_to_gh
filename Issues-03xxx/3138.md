MPolynomialRing_libsingular in sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_libsingular.pyx defines a `_repr_` method which does the same thing as the `_repr_` method that it inherits from MPolynomialRing_generic in sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_ring_generic.pyx

Thus the `_repr_` method is redundant and should be removed.
