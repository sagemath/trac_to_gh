Hi,
while trying this:
sage: gap.Factorization?

I got this...

Type:        <class 'sage.interfaces.gap.GapFunction'>
Definition:  gap.Factorization( [noargspec] )
Docstring:
Help: several entries match this topic - type ?2 to get match [2]

[1] Reference: factorization
[2] Reference: Factorization


Which I can't get to work in either the Notebook or the command line. Any ideas?
Thanks!

Any thoughts about how to disambiguate this sort of thing in the context
of Sage?  Of course, you can just plead that you work on the gap interface
almost 2.5 years ago and remember nothing :-)

gap.2? might just work.

You simply need to send GAP ?2 or HELP("2");

The message is being generated from HELP_SHOW_MATCHES in lib/helpbase.gi (line
713). I dare say we could move that message to a global variable so that you
could change it to  "type gap.2? ...." in a future release.
