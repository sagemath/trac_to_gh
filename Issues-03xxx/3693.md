Current version of spkg here:

    http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/was/patches/moin-1.7.1.spkg

The current problems:

* moinmoin is totally broken on os x -- weird permission errors; probably related to twisted upgrade.  This was a problem with 1.5.x too, so fixing this isn't needed for this ticket, but should be fixed in another ticket.

* jsmath typesetting doesn't work because url's like this don't work:   http://wiki.sagemath.org/wiki/jsmath/   If anybody can find a URL that works (i.e., lists files), I can make jsmath for sage work fine. 

* We have to check that existing moinmoin installs get automatically migrated.

* We need to change things so that (1) the default moinmoin install does *not* allow anonymous edits.  This means editing a file in patches/
   
* We need to change things so that the default moinmoin using catchpa's since the whole point of upgrading is to get rid of spammers.

Mike mentioned that we should go to 1.7.2 directly. We also need someone to test the upgrade of an existing wiki. 

Maybe we should do a backup before upgrading the wiki so that in case of a disaster no data are lost.

Cheers,

Hi,

I just tried this on the public sage wiki.  It "works", but has the drawback that I guess MoinMoin changed their link format, so essentially every single link (over 3000 pages of them) in the entire wiki is broken.  It would be nice if the Python code actually converted the wiki pages so they work.  As it is now, it doesn't, so anybody who upgrades to this spkg would have their entire wiki broken. 

Hopefully changing the link format can be done automatically.

After upgrading a few wiki's, I'm not sure how I feel about the automatic updates since they only sort of work.  If the user has changed the wikiconfig.py file at all.

I think I'd be more in favor of printing a list of explicit instructions for the user to follow.

2009-12-21 14:37:36,095 WARNING MoinMoin.log:139 using logging configuration read from built-in fallback in MoinMoin.log module!
sage:
```
I.e.., I immediately got a prompt back.
This is especially bad because once I exit sage the moin wiki is left running:

```
wstein@sage:~/build/referee/sage-4.3.rc0$ ps ax |grep moin
 4012 ?        Sl     0:00 python /scratch/wstein/build/referee/sage-4.3.rc0/local/bin/twistd moin -p 9000 -a 
 4021 pts/135  S+     0:00 grep moin
```
With the notebook we have two (unfortunately undocumented) options:

```
             fork = False,
             quiet = False
```

I think they do basically what you've main moin do by default.   So I would like to request that you keep the current capability, but make it non-default.  Use the fork= option to control what happens.
