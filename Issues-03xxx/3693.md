Current version of spkg here:

    http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/was/patches/moin-1.7.1.spkg

The current problems:

* moinmoin is totally broken on os x -- weird permission errors; probably related to twisted upgrade.  This was a problem with 1.5.x too, so fixing this isn't needed for this ticket, but should be fixed in another ticket.

* jsmath typesetting doesn't work because url's like this don't work:   http://wiki.sagemath.org/wiki/jsmath/   If anybody can find a URL that works (i.e., lists files), I can make jsmath for sage work fine. 

* We have to check that existing moinmoin installs get automatically migrated.

* We need to change things so that (1) the default moinmoin install does *not* allow anonymous edits.  This means editing a file in patches/
   
* We need to change things so that the default moinmoin using catchpa's since the whole point of upgrading is to get rid of spammers.

I have an updated spkg at http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mhansen/moin-1.7.1.spkg along with a new patch.

It takes care of all the issues listed above except the weird permissions errors on OS X.  The second patch is just a fairly quick version I did, and it would be good if someone else sat down and looked at it.  I tested the migration bit on a simple wiki and it worked correctly with jsMath, the textchas, etc.

Mike mentioned that we should go to 1.7.2 directly. We also need someone to test the upgrade of an existing wiki. 

Maybe we should do a backup before upgrading the wiki so that in case of a disaster no data are lost.

Cheers,

I've tested upgrading an existing wiki, but I guess I don't count :-)

Also, it currently does write a backup before upgrading.

Hi,

I just tried this on the public sage wiki.  It "works", but has the drawback that I guess MoinMoin changed their link format, so essentially every single link (over 3000 pages of them) in the entire wiki is broken.  It would be nice if the Python code actually converted the wiki pages so they work.  As it is now, it doesn't, so anybody who upgrades to this spkg would have their entire wiki broken. 

Hopefully changing the link format can be done automatically.

Mike, if you can put up a new moinmoin spkg that works, even if it doesn't autoupgrade old moinmoins, I'll be happy.

1.  Notice the ? below; we need to add mointwisted.py to the hg repo in the spkg.

```
wstein@sage:~/build/referee/sage-4.3.rc0/moin-1.9.0.p0$              hg status
M patches/wikiconfig.py
M spkg-install
? patches/mointwisted.py
```


The actual wiki command is confusing because it now runs as a daemon instead of blocking.  This is highly confusing, mainly because it is exactly the opposite behavior as the notebook command.

```
sage: wiki(address="")
...
2009-12-21 14:37:36,095 WARNING MoinMoin.log:139 using logging configuration read from built-in fallback in MoinMoin.log module!
sage:
```
I.e.., I immediately got a prompt back.
This is especially bad because once I exit sage the moin wiki is left running:

```
wstein@sage:~/build/referee/sage-4.3.rc0$ ps ax |grep moin
 4012 ?        Sl     0:00 python /scratch/wstein/build/referee/sage-4.3.rc0/local/bin/twistd moin -p 9000 -a 
 4021 pts/135  S+     0:00 grep moin
```
With the notebook we have two (unfortunately undocumented) options:

```
             fork = False,
             quiet = False
```

I think they do basically what you've main moin do by default.   So I would like to request that you keep the current capability, but make it non-default.  Use the fork= option to control what happens.

The [updated patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket3693/trac_3683-upgrade_moinmoin.patch)

* Untabifies `moin.py`.
* Adds a missing `INPUT` block.
* Adds the note about upgrading existing MoinMoin wikis.

The [updated spkg](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/mpatel/trac/3693/moin-1.9.1.p1.spkg)

* Includes jsMath.
* Commits an uncommitted file.
* Fixes the [GUI editor](http://ckeditor.com/).  The jsMath parser was the problem.
  * Maybe we can use the same fix for the [Sage wiki](http://wiki.sagemath.org/)?
  * For another ticket:  Keep MoinMoin from stripping `$`s from GUI mode.
* Uses Sage's `easy/load.js` to load/configure jsMath.  This adds `\QQ`, `\Bold{}`, etc.

Positive review, but someone should review my changes.
