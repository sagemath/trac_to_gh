To test this you should really test the doctests in ell_rational_field.py both before and after installing the database.

I ran the tests on 3.0.6 before and after installing the database, *without* applying the patch, and both tests passed everything.  So... is this really necessary?

But I still think this looks good and should be applied, since it addresses some ambiguity that could be annoying.

The point is that there was randomness in the old doctests:  whenever they use E.gens() where E is an elliptic curve we cannot guarantee that the same gens are computed (on different systems, etc).  As a special case of this ambiguity, the gens obtained from the database (which don't change! -- or at least ont very rarely, e.g. if they are found to be wrong)  may not agree with computed gens.

I dealt with this by either inserting "# random", or by using explicit points instead of gens().

I hope that with this explanation you can give this (admittedly rather trivial) patch a positive review.
