This is unrelated to coercion and should not be assigned against the coercion milestone. Right now 3.0.6 is the default milestone, so please assign new tickets against that milestone.

Is this TeX code stand alone or is there a patch in there somewhere for the new cookbook? If so we should create the cookbook and migrate chapter by chapter over from the old construction manual. Once that is done we remove const.tex and all the other bits related to it.
