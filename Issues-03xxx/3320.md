This should be much faster:

```
sage: A = random_matrix(GF(2),200,200)
sage: time Am = magma(A)
CPU times: user 0.03 s, sys: 0.01 s, total: 0.04 s
Wall time: 0.50
sage: time Ag = gap(A) #<-------------
CPU times: user 10.35 s, sys: 0.63 s, total: 10.98 s
Wall time: 11.76
```

This seems to have been fixed at some point:

```
sage: A = random_matrix(GF(2), 200, 200)
sage: %time Ag = gap(A)
CPU times: user 0.38 s, sys: 0.12 s, total: 0.50 s
Wall time: 1.26 s
sage: %time Ag = gap(A)
CPU times: user 0.37 s, sys: 0.02 s, total: 0.40 s
Wall time: 0.58 s
sage: %time Ag = gap(A)
CPU times: user 0.39 s, sys: 0.02 s, total: 0.41 s
Wall time: 0.62 s
```
I can't do a comparison on my system with magma since it refuses to start for me (I'm running `5.7.beta3`).

Oh ? But I thought we had to set the to positive_review so that Jeroen seens them and closes them ?... `O_o`
