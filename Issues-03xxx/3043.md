Well, the gfan code base is rather sloppy in this regard:

* it never specifies the license other than GPL
* zero files have a copyright statement in them

So in conclusion this must be solved upstream by the author. The FSF read on this is if you include a version of the GPL Version X then your software is licensed under GPL Version X+

Cheers,

Michael

Both the version of gfan that's currently in Sage (0.3) and the latest version (0.4plus) have a file COPYING which is just the text of GPL version 2.  I would say that's pretty clear, and it should be in the file SPKG.txt.
