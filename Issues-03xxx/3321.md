Consider this example

```
sage: A = MatrixSpace(GF(2),2000,2000)(1)
sage: A.visualize_structure()
```

I've attached the output to this ticket (hint: the scaling is to blame) Somehow I believe Tom Boothby would have an easy time to fix this so I CC him :-)

This fixes the bug and the code is fine, but in the docstring I have a minor quibble: you remove a warning about libpng problems on OS X. If those problems haven't been fixed, we should leave the warning in the docstring. I'll give this a positive review if you put the little warning back (or show that the problem was fixed!)
