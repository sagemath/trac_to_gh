Make Li symbolic and work with complex input

Just use mpmath and the ideas from #11143.  Probably will have to do a little work to keep the doctests from earlier, maybe deprecate a keyword or two related to precision.

---


Here is some example code from M. Yurko that explains how to do this.
I think something based on this should be put into the Li function itself.

```
O.K. I defined li(x) as follows:

def li(z): #def log integral for real and complex variables
   if z in RR and z >= 2: #check if real number greater than 2
       return Li(z) +
1.045163780117492784844588889194613136522615578151 #adjust for offset
in SAGE def
   elif z == 1:
       return -infinity
   else: #mode for complex and below 2 from incomplete gamma
       z = CDF(z)
       return -gamma_inc(0,-log(z)) + (log(log(z))-log(1/log(z)))/2-
log(-log(z))

The first part uses SAGE's built in Li(x) but adjusts for the offset.
The second part should be self explanatory. The third part uses a
formula involving the incomplete gamma function which I found on the
Wolfram Functions website. On testing different values with an
external calculator,  the third statement appears to only be valid for
negative reals and complex numbers. This leaves the interval [0,2)
undefined. Please note that I have no background in complex analysis
and that my above statements about domain are only based upon
experimentation.
```

I've added a patch which folds the above patches together and deprecates the eps_rel and err_bound parameters so that code that uses them won't "break", but will get a deprecation warning.

I'm okay with myurko's changes so if someone could sign off on the deprecation warning, that'd be great.

Sorry to come in this late to the discussion, but this needs more work.

The `prec` argument to symbolic functions is deprecated, adding it to `Li` now doesn't make sense.

```
sage: gamma(10,prec=100)
.../_home_burcin__sage_init_sage_0.py:1: DeprecationWarning: The prec keyword argument is deprecated. Explicitly set the precision of the input, for example gamma(RealField(300)(1)), or use the prec argument to .n() for exact inputs, e.g., gamma(1).n(300), instead.
  # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
362880.00000000000000000000000
```

You can get the precision from the argument provided by the user. If the user needs a higher precision, they should explicitly convert the argument to a higher precision, for example by using `RealFiel(300)(val)`.

We should also start converting these to proper symbolic functions that remain symbolic on exact input, but that can be left to another ticket.

I have created a symbolic Li patch on top of #11143 on sage-5.2.rc1 .  This is my first go at a patch so no doubt will need a good scrubbing...

Please note doing this is a hobby for me and I have little or no time weekdays to do anything so my responses are likely to be slow.

Don't worry about the coding conventions, some of them are unwritten and some of them are subtle. I found a few doctest errors after running `make ptestlong` with the patches applied. These should be simple to fix:

Change 9 to 10:

```
File "/home/jonesbe/sage/sage-5.2/devel/sage-11143/sage/misc/sagedoc.py", line 971:
    sage: len(search_src('log', 'derivative', interact=False).splitlines()) < 9
Expected:
    True
Got:
    False
```

simple change, `Li` is now fully symbolic:

```
File "/home/jonesbe/sage/sage-5.2/devel/sage-11143/sage/functions/transcendental.py", lin
e 195:
    sage: Li(100)
Expected:
    29.080977804
Got:
    -log_integral(2) + log_integral(100)
```

This one is more mysterious:

Well, with names put into the global namespace, the most important thing is that tab completion is likely to suggest you what you're looking for, i.e., the *prefix* of each name matters.  So in this case I think a single instance of `log_int*` (in addition to `[Ll]i*`, maybe more) would be sufficent.

With Sage 5.3.beta0, I currently get:

The function can be removed since it was just a convenience one to support the original li and Li.

The function randomly selects from a list of all Pynac functions, to which is now added Li, and so now the functions chosen have changed.  The docs state that it will often raise an error because it tries to create an erroneous expression.  In this case it is trying to pass a complex expression to Maxima. Trial and error and got a return result setting the seed to 1.

When I have worked out how to merge patches I'll post a revised patch for review that addresses all comments made so far.
