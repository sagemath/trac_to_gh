The patch from #3020 added a new call to a pseudo-random-number generator, not under the control of the Sage randstate framework.  This patch fixes that up, as well as adding some new documentation to randstate.  Applies on top of the patch from #3020.

This is a very good idea indeed.  The patch looks fine to me though it would also be agood idea if someone more familiar with Sage's random framework looked at it too.
