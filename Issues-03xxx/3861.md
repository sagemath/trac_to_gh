line3d for instance calls Line in `src/sage/plot/plot3d/shapes2.py`

Which automatically applies some smoothing using corner_cutoff, which is buggy and poorly documented as in #3859

(See above Ticket for an example of how this can be bad.)

It is important that I plot lines directly, and automatic smoothing should either not be automatic, or should be documented,
even for functions that do not reference the smoothing directly like in Line3d.  Perhaps a 'smooth' keyword is more informative than the undocumented corner_cutoff.

The smoothing is done in the Line class object, and not in pmol, so it can (and should!) be selectively applied.

Fixing the referenced ticket is a workaround (set corner_cutoff = 1), but is very clunky, and currently does not even work.

I like the idea of a smoothnes parameter, 0=False meaning don't smooth at all, 1=True being some good default, and something higher (say 2) to forceable splite the whole thing. 

I agree it could be better documented, but I think smoothing is very useful when you are trying to visualize curves. Of course, if you're plotting stock data then it is really bad.
