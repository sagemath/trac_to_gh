```
The following calculation is trivial, so shouldn't overflow:

```
sage: len(Compositions(30))
536870912
sage: len(Compositions(40))
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
OverflowError: long int too large to convert to int
```        


This is also lame:

```
sage: len(Partitions(1000))
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
OverflowError: long int too large to convert to int
```
