Kernel \r on an \m

        sage -t -long devel/sage/sage/crypto/mq/sr.py
Total time for all tests: 4047.3 seconds

Because of lack of RAM:

[was@localhost ~]$ free
             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:        255704     223072      32632          0      35608     140592
Swap:       524280      41776     482504

I still am very unhappy about this doctest failure.  Shouldn't Sage should work and
pass its test suite  with 768MB memory?

=====================================================

On the Ubuntu LTS 64-bit Sage install with 1GB RAM exactly one failure:


        sage -t -long devel/sage/sage/crypto/mq/sr.py

Attachment [trac_3758-Fix_Crypto_DocTest.patch](tarball://root/attachments/some-uuid/ticket3758/trac_3758-Fix_Crypto_DocTest.patch) by shumow created at 2009-01-23 22:15:43

The problem here is that the doctest for sage.crypto.mq.sr.test_consistency uses too much memory.

There are two options to fix this:

1)  Just take the doc test out.
<or>
2)  Change the doctest to call test_consistency w/ max_n=1 instead of max_n=2.  This leads to a more than 5 fold improvement of memory usage / time.

This patch implements 2, because (1) would make test coverage numbers decrease.
