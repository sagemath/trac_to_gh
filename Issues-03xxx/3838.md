```
> v = c(3,5,9,1)
> v[c(2,3)]
[1] 5 9 
```
works in R, but the corresponding statement in Sage does not:

```
sage: v = r.c(3,5,9,1)
sage: n = r.c(2,3)
sage: v[n]
[1] 3
```

I believe this is a defect. With the attached patch, the following works:

```
sage: v = r.c(3,5,9,1)
sage: n = r.c(2,3)
sage: v[n]
[1] 5 9
sage: v[-2]
[1] 3 9 1
sage: v['c(2,3)']
[1] 5 9
sage: v[2,4,3]
[1] 5 1 9
sage: v[2]
[1] 5
```

I just realized that it is not a good idea to make `v[2,3]` return a vector, because if `v` is an array, `v[2,3]` should return a single entry of the array.

The new patch (that should be applied after the first one) takes this into account. Now we have:

```
sage: v = r.c(3,5,9,1)
sage: n = r.c(2,3)
sage: v[n]
[1] 5 9
sage: v[-n]
[1] 3 1
```
as above, and

```
sage: m = r.array('1:3', r.c(2,4))
sage: m
     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]
[1,]    1    3    2    1
[2,]    2    1    3    2
sage: m[1,2]
[1] 3
sage: m[n]
[1] 2 3
```

I think this is better than the first approach, but still allows to use an RElement as index.

No problem, that works already with the previous version:

```
sage: m = r.array('1:3', r.c(2,4,2))
sage: m
, , 1
     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]
[1,]    1    3    2    1
[2,]    2    1    3    2

, , 2
     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]
[1,]    3    2    1    3
[2,]    1    3    2    1

sage: m[1,2,2]
[1] 2
sage: m[1,3,2]
[1] 1
```

I changed the doc-tests accordingly (by the third patch).

However, i just realize that mixing integer and r.c does not work:

```
sage: m = r.array('1:3', r.c(2,4,2))
sage: r(m.name()+'[1,c(1,2),1]')
[1] 1 3    # the output how it should be
sage: m[1,r.c(1,2),1]
[1] 2      # wrong output
```

I'll work on this problem.

The most recent patch replaces all previous patches and should apply to 3.1.alpha0. Here is the new feature:

```
sage: m = r.array('1:3', r.c(2,4,2))
sage: m
, , 1
     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]
[1,]    1    3    2    1
[2,]    2    1    3    2

, , 2
     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]
[1,]    3    2    1    3
[2,]    1    3    2    1
sage: m[1,r.c(1,2),1]
[1] 1 3
sage: m[1,r.c(1,3),r.c(1,2)]
     [,1] [,2]
[1,]    1    3
[2,]    2    1
```

The doctests provide examples for that type of usage.
