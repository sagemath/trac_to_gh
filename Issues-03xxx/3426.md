In this case the result actually should be a real number, so we fix this by discarding the imaginary part of the result from pari. In other cases, however, the result is actually a complex number, and we shouldn't always be attempting to cast it to a real number (which the attached patch also fixes).

besselk(nu,x,{flag = 0})

K-Bessel function of index nu (which can be complex) and argument x. Only real and positive arguments x are allowed in the present version 2.3.3. If flag is equal to 1, uses another implementation of this function which is faster when x >> 1.

The library syntax is kbessel(nu,x,prec) and kbessel2(nu,x,prec) respectively.
```
Therefore pari gives incorrect answers for your negative x.  Perhaps this is another bug and we should merge this ticket and open another one for adding some error checking to besselk?

<a id='comment:27'></a>I looked up the definition and properties of the Bessel functions in
several references (Section 7.2 of the "Bateman Manuscript Project",
for instance).

I uploaded a brand new patch that implements the behavior described
there, namely returning a real number if the result is theoretically
known to be real, and a complex number otherwise.  I added doctests
that document this behavior, and checked all of them against
Mathematica.  I did this for all three Bessel functions that are

complains about negative integer values of nu.

In the process I uncovered a couple of unrelated issues with
special.py and Bessel functions, for which I'll open separate tickets.

The patch is made against 3.1.3.alpha2.

<a id='comment:35'></a>From my quick experiments with the issues Bober was dealing with a year ago, I see that do not arise if we use mpmath, even when I set the precision to 5000.

I agree with Alex Ghitza.


I should say that the bessels functions for non integer indices have always bothered me. I believe computing will involve a log, and how do you consistently choose a branch.
