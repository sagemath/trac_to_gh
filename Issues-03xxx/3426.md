In this case the result actually should be a real number, so we fix this by discarding the imaginary part of the result from pari. In other cases, however, the result is actually a complex number, and we shouldn't always be attempting to cast it to a real number (which the attached patch also fixes).

K-Bessel function of index nu (which can be complex) and argument x. Only real and positive arguments x are allowed in the present version 2.3.3. If flag is equal to 1, uses another implementation of this function which is faster when x >> 1.

The library syntax is kbessel(nu,x,prec) and kbessel2(nu,x,prec) respectively.

<a id='comment:27'></a>
I looked up the definition and properties of the Bessel functions in
several references (Section 7.2 of the "Bateman Manuscript Project",
for instance).

I uploaded a brand new patch that implements the behavior described
there, namely returning a real number if the result is theoretically
known to be real, and a complex number otherwise.  I added doctests
that document this behavior, and checked all of them against
Mathematica.  I did this for all three Bessel functions that are
implemented in special.py using Pari, namely J, K, and I.  I also put in a workaround for a silly Pari buglet that
complains about negative integer values of nu.

In the process I uncovered a couple of unrelated issues with
special.py and Bessel functions, for which I'll open separate tickets.

The patch is made against 3.1.3.alpha2.

Now `bessel_J(0,0)` works but I'm seeing other problems. I'm concentrating here on the "K" functions since that's what this ticket is about. This is all with the current patch applied to 3.1.4.

* `bessel_K(-1*I - 1, 0)` gives an uninformative Pari error; the function isn't defined there. Mathematica says "ComplexInfinity"; can we give a better error message? Even just "function not defined at 0" would be fine.

* `bessel_K(-1, -1)` says it can't convert `-0.601907230197235-1.77549968921218*I` to a real   number, which I agree with. :)  It looks like Pari has the right answer but we're trying to convert it to a real when we shouldn't be.
