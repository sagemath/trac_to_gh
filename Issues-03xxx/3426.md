In this case the result actually should be a real number, so we fix this by discarding the imaginary part of the result from pari. In other cases, however, the result is actually a complex number, and we shouldn't always be attempting to cast it to a real number (which the attached patch also fixes).

K-Bessel function of index nu (which can be complex) and argument x. Only real and positive arguments x are allowed in the present version 2.3.3. If flag is equal to 1, uses another implementation of this function which is faster when x >> 1.

The library syntax is kbessel(nu,x,prec) and kbessel2(nu,x,prec) respectively.

Therefore pari gives incorrect answers for your negative x.  Perhaps this is another bug and we should merge this ticket and open another one for adding some error checking to besselk?

I looked up the definition and properties of the Bessel functions in
several references (Section 7.2 of the "Bateman Manuscript Project",
for instance).

I uploaded a brand new patch that implements the behavior described
there, namely returning a real number if the result is theoretically
known to be real, and a complex number otherwise.  I added doctests
that document this behavior, and checked all of them against
Mathematica.  I did this for all three Bessel functions that are
implemented in special.py using Pari, namely J, K, and I.  I also put in a workaround for a silly Pari buglet that
complains about negative integer values of nu.

In the process I uncovered a couple of unrelated issues with
special.py and Bessel functions, for which I'll open separate tickets.

The patch is made against 3.1.3.alpha2.

Thanks for catching this.  It actually comes from a bug in Pari:

```
? besselj(0, 0)
%1 = 1.000000000000000000000000000
? besselj(0.E-19, 0)
  *** besselj: gpow: 0 to a non positive exponent.

I've reported it upstream, but I will post  a patch with a workaround while we wait.

Now `bessel_J(0,0)` works but I'm seeing other problems. I'm concentrating here on the "K" functions since that's what this ticket is about. This is all with the current patch applied to 3.1.4.

* `bessel_K(0, -1)` doesn't work at all; it just soaks up all the CPU and doesn't return. The correct answer is about `0.421024438240708 - 3.97746326050642*I`.

* `bessel_K(-1*I - 1, 0)` gives an uninformative Pari error; the function isn't defined there. Mathematica says "ComplexInfinity"; can we give a better error message? Even just "function not defined at 0" would be fine.

* `bessel_K(-1, -1)` says it can't convert `-0.601907230197235-1.77549968921218*I` to a real   number, which I agree with. :)  It looks like Pari has the right answer but we're trying to convert it to a real when we shouldn't be.
