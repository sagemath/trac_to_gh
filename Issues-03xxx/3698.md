Pearu Peterson (sympycore guy) wrote some really fast pure python code for computing multinomial coefficients, e.g.,

```
14:20 < wstein> sage: R.<x,y,z> = QQ[]
14:20 < wstein> sage: timeit('(x+y+z)^50')
14:20 < wstein> 25 loops, best of 3: 20.8 ms per loop
14:20 < wstein> sage: timeit('w = multinomial_coefficients(3r,50r)')
14:20 < wstein> 25 loops, best of 3: 10.3 ms per loop
```
