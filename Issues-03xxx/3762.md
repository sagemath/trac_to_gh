Note -- also close #3079.

I wonder -- should quaddouble should be moved to be an optional spkg?  That will be weird, since the actual support for quaddouble is all over the sage install (in all the coercions code, etc.).

```

My real_roots.pyx uses a couple of functions from quaddouble:
fpu_fix_start and fpu_fix_end.  (partitions_c.cc also uses these
functions.)  These are found in the quaddouble source in src/fpu.cpp
and include/fpu.h

Probably the right fix is to copy only those two files into c_lib/.  I
can do that, but I'll need some help with configuration.  (The main
thing is that the files want a preprocessor symbol X86 to be defined
iff we're using an x86-family processor.)

This removes all sage dependancies on quaddouble, but leaves it in to be deprecated for a while. 

Some issues that need to be dealt with are (1) the speed regression in partitions and (2) whether the fix for real_roots would better be extracting fpu_fix from the qd autoconf script. Perhaps if qd is present, we could detect it and compile the above with the qd routines.

1. I applied this to sage-3.3.alpha1 on sage.math and got:

```
The following tests failed:

2. Performance on sage.math:

```
BEFORE:
sage: time k = number_of_partitions(10^8)
CPU times: user 2.48 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 2.48 s
Wall time: 2.49 s
sage: time k = number_of_partitions(10^9)
CPU times: user 22.85 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 22.85 s
Wall time: 22.85 s


AFTER:
sage: time k = number_of_partitions(10^8)
CPU times: user 3.29 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 3.29 s
Wall time: 3.29 s
sage: time k = number_of_partitions(10^9)
CPU times: user 35.68 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 35.68 s
Wall time: 35.71 s
```

3. I read all the code in the patches, and am fine with it. 

Positive review if the two doctest issues above are fixed. 

NOTE: you should not delete the quaddouble package, since this code still links it in.  That will have to happen in a few months after Deprecation.
