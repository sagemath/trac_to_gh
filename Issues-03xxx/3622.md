When you create a symbolic expression and numerically integrate it, Sage should use
the fast_float framework to do this (a bazzilion times!) faster than it does right now.

Good point. 

> Also, this does not always win...


```
sage: f = lambda x: sin(x)^3 + sin(x)
sage: timeit('numerical_integral(f, 0, pi)')
625 loops, best of 3: 856 µs per loop
sage: f = sin(x)^3 + sin(x)
sage: timeit('numerical_integral(f, 0, pi)')
25 loops, best of 3: 15 ms per loop
sage: f = f._fast_float_(x)
sage: timeit('numerical_integral(f, 0, pi)')
625 loops, best of 3: 126 µs per loop
```

I guess we'll have to optimize the fast_float construction... I'll look into this more. 

> Finally, the following is just wrong:


Hmm... I'll look into this.

I added some more documentation to show that the old behavior is not lost. I also fixed it so constant functions work (that never worked before either, but it was an easy fix). 

Fast float construction has been optimized in the meantime, so now it's always faster. 

```
sage: f = lambda x: sin(x)^3 + sin(x)
sage: timeit('numerical_integral(f, 0, pi)')
625 loops, best of 3: 869 µs per loop
sage: f = sin(x)^3 + sin(x)
sage: timeit('numerical_integral(f, 0, pi)')
5 loops, best of 3: 134 µs per loop
```

(Note that `timeit('numerical_integral(sin(x)^3 + sin(x),  0, pi)')` is a bit unfair because it constructs the symbolic expression every loop, but this isn't a typical use case anyways...)

<a id='comment:6'></a>I'm curious how things compare when you put the lambda function in the loop vs putting the symbolic expression in the loop..  i.e.

```
sage: timeit('numerical_integral(lambda x: sin(x)^3 + sin(x), 0, pi)')
# vs.
sage: timeit('numerical_integral(sin(x)^3 + sin(x), 0, pi)')
```

If the construction of the fast float takes a long time compared to doing the whole integral with a lambda function, then this might not be a win.

<a id='comment:9'></a>Okay, I get it now.  Sorry to make you explain again.  Here are some more timings:

```
sage: timeit('e = lambda x: sin(x)^3 + sin(x)')
625 loops, best of 3: 288 ns per loop
sage: timeit('e = sin(x)^3 + sin(x)')
625 loops, best of 3: 103 µs per loop
sage: timeit("e._fast_float_('x')")
625 loops, best of 3: 49 µs per loop
sage: timeit('e._fast_float_()') #way slower
5 loops, best of 3: 96.3 ms per loop

sage: timeit("numerical_integral(sin(x)^3 + sin(x),0,pi)")
25 loops, best of 3: 25.6 ms per loop
```

Apparently it only takes 100 microseconds to create `sin(x)^3 + sin(x)`, 50 microseconds to turn it into a fast float, and 100 microseconds to execute the integration once that's done.  So when I put the function creation inside the loop, I would expect about 250 microseconds.  Where is the other 25.4 ms going?

That question aside, I'm now convinced this patch is a good idea, and the tests pass, so I gave it positive review.

<a id='comment:13'></a>Excellent. When I saw it was a matter of milliseconds, maxima slowness went under the radar for me (it's often worse than that, going through pexpect and all), but it looks like you're right. And it's a relief that it'll get faster. Thanks for tracking this down.
