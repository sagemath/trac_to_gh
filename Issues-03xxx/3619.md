I don't understand what the final comment, about AdminToplevel, is about.

I worry that we will hang on to thousands of login times with this, which could be memory/disk intensive.  Could we agree on the last fifty login times, or the first time ever and then the next 100 or something similar?

Also, there is no way to view this information.  Why are we keeping it?

> I don't understand what the final comment, about AdminToplevel, is about.


Somehow the user account type for the user admin was getting changed to 'user'. This is no longer a problem because a patch was merged which has account_type returning 'admin' for user admin no matter what.

> I worry that we will hang on to thousands of login times with this, which could be memory/disk intensive.  Could we agree on the last fifty login times, or the first time ever and then the next 100 or something similar?

We could, but I am very interested in being able to look up all login times for a given user.

There will be. I just didn't do it because at the time I couldn't figure out the AdminToplevel problem.

I'll get back to this ticket after thinking more about it. Thanks for reviewing.

How I test this:

(1) I login and then go to sage.math.washington.edu:8999/users # Table of users with two links next to each of them if login recording is on. 

(2) I click on "Access" in third column to see login times. The page should be blank if no login times have been recorded.

Login recording is turned off by default. In order to turn it on I do:

```
*** WARNING: Notebook must not be running! ***

sage: nb = load('.sage/sage_notebook/nb.sobj', compress=False)
sage: nb.conf()['record_logins'] = True
sage: nb.save(filename='/home/tclemans/.sage/sage_notebook/nb.sobj')
