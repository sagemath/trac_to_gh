In ticket #3724, `malb` suggested a very fast hash method for matrices over `GF(2)`, and he wrote that it should be doable over `GF(p)` in general.

Currently, we have:

```
sage: time N=MatrixSpace(GF(7),10000,10000).random_element()
CPU times: user 11.83 s, sys: 2.40 s, total: 14.23 s
Wall time: 14.23 s
```
This, i think, is very slow and ought to be improved as well.

```
sage: N.set_immutable()
sage: time N.__hash__()
CPU times: user 3.17 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 3.17 s
Wall time: 3.17 s
21008582
```
... and this is quite slow, while (with the patch from #3724) the hash is immediate for matrices over GF(2).


**Assignee:** @malb

**Keywords:** hash, matrix, finite field

**Resolution:** fixed

The patch applies, it is faster than before, it seems to produce a reasonable hash value, and it raises an exception for mutable matrices. 

So, mainly i am giving a positive review.

But i have a couple of questions of more general nature concerning the doc tests:
1. The doc string has a section EXAMPLE and TEST. Will both give rise to doc tests? Or more generally: What exactly must one put into the doc string such that it results in a doc test? E.g., i see that some people write "TEST CASES:", i think some write "EXAMPLES:", you write "EXAMPLE:" (without "S"), some write "TEST:" or "DOCTEST:" or "TESTS:".
2. Under "EXAMPLE:", you have an "indirect doctest". Why is this test working? The matrix is random, hence, the result is random, but there is no key-word "random".
3. Am i right that the hash value also depends on the size of `unsigned long`, hence, is machine dependent? Is this why you do not provide an example with a non-trivial hash value?

One remark: AFAIK, often hash values are cached. This is not done here (nor for matrices over GF(2)). Does anybody think that implementing a cache for the hash would be a good idea? (I don't)

Matrix hashes are specifically designed to be compatible with each other:

```
sage: M = random_matrix(GF(2), 10, 10)
sage: M.set_immutable()
sage: hash(M)
561
sage: MZ = M.change_ring(ZZ)
sage: MZ.set_immutable()
sage: hash(MZ)
561
sage: MS = M.spa
M.sparse_columns  M.sparse_matrix   M.sparse_rows     
sage: MS = M.sparse_matrix()
sage: MS.set_immutable()
sage: hash(MS)
561
```

This patch seems to break that. At a minimum, it seems sparse and dense should hash to the same thing. If we want to change this policy, we should at least ask on sage-devel.
