Hi Tim, Francois, 

the patch looks good, but as is it needs some changes to our spkg-install. I also noticed some other issues with some scripts in to the src directory, i.e. all shell scripts are missing a shebang, so that causes trouble with csh in some instances. Once I got those sorted out I will respin our spkg and merge this patch while I am at it.

Cheers,

Mea culpa! One of us should at least have thought about the spkg-install,
we were more concerned that it would work correctly with our distros and that
it was "minimal". Good thing is now libntl.a is correctly compiled without
-fpic and libntl.so is now completely compiled with -fpic.
I attach a tentative patch for spkg-install.

Cheers,
Francois

Attachment [spkg-install.patch](tarball://root/attachments/some-uuid/ticket3159/spkg-install.patch) by mabshoff created at 2008-05-11 21:20:07

I have fixed a small couple issues with the patch in

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mabshoff/release-cycles-3.0.2/alpha0/ntl-5.4.2.p3.spkg

I did not patch src/src/mfile, but the one in patches, so the new Debian package as well as the ebuild needs to take that into consideration. The spkg builds fine on OSX and Linux, so positive review.

Cheers,

Michael
