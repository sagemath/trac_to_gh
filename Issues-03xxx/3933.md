This works:

sage: list(Set([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

But this doesn't:

sage: list(Set(iter([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])))
[]

Basically Set makes a Set_object() out of it and Set_object is really not prepared to deal with an iterator.  I glanced over the code and did find an obvious solution.

The examples should read

```
sage: list(Set([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

and 

```
sage: list(Set(iter([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])))
[]
```

amusingly:

```
sage: list(Set(iter([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])))
[]
sage: list(Set(set(iter([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))))
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
