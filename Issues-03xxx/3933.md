This works:

sage: list(Set([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

But this doesn't:

sage: list(Set(iter([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])))
[]

Basically Set makes a Set_object() out of it and Set_object is really not prepared to deal with an iterator.  I glanced over the code and did find an obvious solution.

Component: **misc**
