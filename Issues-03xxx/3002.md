A lot of configure scripts seem to check for
fortran, even if they don't use it. It appears the relevant
environment variables are F77 and FFLAGS. Anyway, the variable
SAGE_FORTRAN seems to be honored fine for the packages that actually
need fortran.

<a id='comment:1'>Comment 1:</a>
This is not the case and if we don't use an F77 compiler we shouldn't use the F77 env variable. The fact that a lot of them check for a Fortran compiler and don't use them is also something that doesn't matter since the configure process will not fail. So, the whole ticket is clearly "won't fix" to me.

Thoughts?

Cheers,

Michael
