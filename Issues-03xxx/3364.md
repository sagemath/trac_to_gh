This is the remaining issue from #3130.  See this example:

```
sage: set_random_seed(0)
sage: G = PermutationGroup([[(1,2,3),(4,5)],[(3,4)]])
sage: G.composition_series()

[Permutation Group with generators [(1,2,3)(4,5), (3,4)],
 Permutation Group with generators [(1,5)(3,4), (1,5)(2,3), (1,5,3)],
 Permutation Group with generators [()]]
sage: set_random_seed(0)
sage: G = PermutationGroup([[(1,2,3),(4,5)],[(3,4)]])
sage: G.composition_series()

[Permutation Group with generators [(1,2,3)(4,5), (3,4)],
 Permutation Group with generators [(1,5)(3,4), (1,5)(2,4), (1,4,5)],
 Permutation Group with generators [()]]
```

Even with the same random number seed, the result of .composition_series() is different.

It turns out that GAP has two random number generators, and uses both.  (I couldn't find any uses of the older generator when I first wrote randstate, but that's because I was looking for the wrong thing.)  This fixes randstate to control both generators.

This patch will conflict with #3130; it might be better to apply it first and let me rebase this patch.

Well, 3130 needs rebasing too, which means I must redo it from scratch.
