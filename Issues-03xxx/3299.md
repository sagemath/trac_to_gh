So it seems we are allocating a buffer for Cudd each time we create a ring but this buffer keeps increasing and is never free'd?

Replying to [@malb](#comment:2):

Hi, 
one "interesting" thing I see is the global ring:

```
         global cur_ring
         cur_ring = self
```

Does something care for its destruction? And what about the destruction of `self._zero_element` and `self._one_element`?

(Since 0.3 non-destructed polynomials delay the destruction of the ring.)

Regards,
  Alexander
