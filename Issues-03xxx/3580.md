Currently sage.rings.number_field.totallyreal_data imports numpy at startup. That might be due to the cythonization of totallyreal*, but I am not sure.

Moved the `import` further in, which was fine (didn't slow things down).

Michael, should we add the following as a doctest somewhere?

```
sage: search_src("^import", "numpy")

sage: search_src("^from", "numpy")

```

We already have a doctest that is supposed to catch this (via grepping for numpy in "sage -startuptime"), but I think we should add a test in $SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/tests that looks for the import of numpy in "from sage import all". Right now John's totally real code imports numpy, but the doctest to detect a numpy import at the top level is broken.

What I would like to see is to not import numpy each time, but use something like the mechanism in 

https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket3498/numpy-3.patch.gz

The mechanism from that patch should be be stuck somewhere in the global namespace and we should enforce its use, i.e. a patch reviewed seeing something like a straight numpy import should complain.

Cheers,

Michael

This removes the numpy import from the totally real enumeration code, and it fixes a pesky but somewhat serious bug in the code. 

John Voight and I team wrote/reviewed this.

I will open a new ticket for the new import of numpy on startup.
