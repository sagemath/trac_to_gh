Michael, should we add the following as a doctest somewhere?

```
sage: search_src("^import", "numpy")

sage: search_src("^from", "numpy")

What I would like to see is to not import numpy each time, but use something like the mechanism in 

http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/attachment/ticket/3498/numpy-3.patch

The mechanism from that patch should be be stuck somewhere in the global namespace and we should enforce its use, i.e. a patch reviewed seeing something like a straight numpy import should complain.
