**Attachment:** [zodb3-3.7.0.p0-spkg-install-64bit-osx.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket3190/zodb3-3.7.0.p0-spkg-install-64bit-osx.patch.gz)

The attached patch isn't *unified* diff, so the preview doesn't work.

The updated spkg is at

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mabshoff/release-cycles-3.0.2/alpha1/zodb3-3.7.0.p1.spkg

Cheers,

Michael
