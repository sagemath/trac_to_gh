This depends on #4674.

Ignore any previous comments.  Apply jquery-and-friends-spkg.patch.  The spkgs are here:

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jason/notebook/jquery-1.2.6.spkg

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jason/notebook/jqueryui-1.6r807svn.spkg

Eventually, we need to also delete the obsolete directories in the extcode repository.
