There is one doctest failure:

```

Got:
    Graphics object consisting of 17 graphics primitives

I assume this is becase previously the graph was incorrect.

Emily wrote all that by herself. I only reviewed and helped her with matplotlib.

Uploaded an image of a sample plot of a multi-edge graph. The graph was produced using the following code from the docstring of `sage.graphs.graph.GenericGraph.plot`:

```
sage: g = Graph({}, loops=True, multiedges=True)
sage: g.add_edges([(0,0,'a'),(0,0,'b'),(0,1,'c'),(0,1,'d'), 
...     (0,1,'e'),(0,1,'f'),(0,1,'f'),(2,1,'g'),(2,2,'h')]) 
sage: g.plot(edge_labels=True, color_by_label=True, edge_style='dashed')
```
I uploaded the image here, so it can be referred to in the release tour of 3.3.
