The example in the docstring for `is_normal` in `sage/groups/perm_gps/permgroup.py` in sage-3.0.3.alpha2 is wrong.

```

        Return True if the group self is a normal subgroup of other.

        EXAMPLES:
            sage: G = PermutationGroup(['(1,2,3)(4,5)'])
            sage: H = PermutationGroup(['(1,2,3)(4,5)', '(1,2,3,4,5)'])
            sage: G.is_normal(H)
            True
```

(Aside: isn't it more natural to let H be a subgroup of G instead of the other way around?)

G is not a normal subgroup of H since conjugation by (1,2,3,4,5) does not map G to G.

Other example:

```
sage: G = SymmetricGroup(3); G.1
(1,2)
sage: H = G.subgroup( [ G.1 ] )
sage: H.is_normal(G)
True
```

The docstring should read

Attachment [9860.patch](tarball://root/attachments/some-uuid/ticket3442/9860.patch) by @wdjoyner created at 2008-06-17 17:46:07

A patch for this docstring error is posted which is based on sage-3.0.3.rc0. 

Install and sage -testall passed for sage-3.0.3.rc0. Also, this patch passed using sage -t. However, running sage -testall on this patch resulted in a lock-up on padic_lseries.py. I'll try again but think this is an unrelated issue.

I could create another patch which does reordering of the methods alphabetically (as was done earlier). However, it seems I'm the only one who cares, so unless someone yells, I'll drop that idea.

According to the GAP documentation for the function IsNormal (which is what is_normal wraps):

```
IsNormal( G, U ) O

returns true if the group G normalizes the group U and false otherwise.

A group G normalizes a group U if and only if for every g ∈ G and u ∈ U the element ug is a member of U. Note that U need not be a subgroup of G. 
```

So the docstring, as corrected in the patch, is correct but does not tell the full story. Do you think it should be further elaborated?

I've added a third patch (apply after 9860 and 9861) that swaps the arguments to `is_normal`.

It makes `H.is_normal(G)` mean: H is a normal subgroup of G.
