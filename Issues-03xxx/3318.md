There are are two issues that need to be fixed with the current python.spkg:

* we need to pass OPT flags to configure since otherwise we end up missing "-m64"
* Instead of "--enable-toolbox-glue=false" we need to use "--disable-toolbox-glue" to avoid building the Mac specific extensions that do not work in 64 bit mode anyway since there is no 64 bit Carbon
* we need to slightly patch pymactoolbox.h so that twisted-8.0.1 work in 64 bit mode, see #3193

Cheers,

Michael

The spkg at

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mabshoff/release-cycles-3.0.3/alpha0/python-2.5.2.p1.spkg

contains the above fixes. It has been build tested with Linux and 32 & 64 bit OSX.

Currently the _ctypes.so extension is broken. Since the fix is complicated this will be another ticket.

Cheers,
