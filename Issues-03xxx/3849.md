Forget about this code.  This is an important error though.

The attached patch sagenb_3849-part1.patch I think completely fixes all such problems for uploading a *worksheet*, but doesn't do anything about Data-->Upload or attach file.

I'm making Data -->Upload or attach a file a new ticket: #7495
