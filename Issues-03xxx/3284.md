<a id='comment:2'></a>Hello again,
"Operands come from different manager." is an error message from the deep of the BDD-package behind the PolyBoRi data structures. It means, that one tries to do a binary operation with elements from two different rings. But operation does not necessary mean the y*z operation, it maybe triggered by something else in N() oder _coerce_

Best regards,

`BooleanPolynomialRing_constructor` in malb's original patch fails when only names are provided, attachment:trac3284_BooleanPolynomialRing_normalize_names.patch fixes this case.

I give malb's patch (followed by mine) a positive review. Someone should review my patch, especially the change to `normalize_names`.
