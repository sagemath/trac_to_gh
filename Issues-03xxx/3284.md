Hello again,
"Operands come from different manager." is an error message from the deep of the BDD-package behind the PolyBoRi data structures. It means, that one tries to do a binary operation with elements from two different rings. But operation does not necessary mean the y*z operation, it maybe triggered by something else in N() oder `_coerce_`

Best regards,
  Alexander

I don't see why the changes to pbori.pyx other than the addition of the R._pbring.activate() at line 4131 are necessary. 

In `BooleanPolynomialRing_constructor`, the if statement (including the elif) at line 430 seems to be redundant, since normalize_names already returns a tuple. It could be that I'm reading the source of normalize_names wrong though.
