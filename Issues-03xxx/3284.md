Hello again,
"Operands come from different manager." is an error message from the deep of the BDD-package behind the PolyBoRi data structures. It means, that one tries to do a binary operation with elements from two different rings. But operation does not necessary mean the y*z operation, it maybe triggered by something else in N() oder _coerce_

Best regards,
  Alexander

I don't see why the changes to pbori.pyx other than the addition of the R._pbring.activate() at line 4131 are necessary. 

In `BooleanPolynomialRing_constructor`, the if statement (including the elif) at line 430 seems to be redundant, since normalize_names already returns a tuple. It could be that I'm reading the source of normalize_names wrong though.

True, it is unrelated to this particular weakref patch. I mixed up two things. The renaming only cleans up since vars is a built-in identifier and it is considered bad practice to use it like we used to use it.

`BooleanPolynomialRing_constructor` in malb's original patch fails when only names are provided, attachment:trac3284_BooleanPolynomialRing_normalize_names.patch fixes this case.

I give malb's patch (followed by mine) a positive review. Someone should review my patch, especially the change to `normalize_names`.
