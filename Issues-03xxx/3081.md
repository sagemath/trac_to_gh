This (nearly trivial patch) adds support for exact and numerical evaluation of "twisted" Kloosterman sums. This generalizes Gauss sums, Salie sums and normal Kloosterman sums.

QUESTION:

You've rewritten some of the functions to be more general, e.g., this

```
707	 	            z *= zeta 
708	 	            g += phi(c)*z 
```
becomes this:

```
763	                z = zeta ** (a*e + b*(e**(-1))) 
764	                g += phi(self.__call__(c))*z        
```

What impact does this have on performance in the original case of computing Gauss
sums?  Is it slower or faster or the same?

Also, why use 

```
self.__call__(c)
```
instead of 

```
self(c)
```
?

It computes the modular inverse every time. So it should be somewhat slower as before. I read that there is an ongoing discussion between code duplication and speed ...  

I wanted to use this to introduce Poincare series in SAGE (and compute their Fourier coefficients) but this is far to slow. I am planning to reimplement the numerical stuff in C/Cython next week (or this weekend). 

Question: Why are Dirichlet characters in modular/dirichlet.py? Is it for historical reasons?

Yep, Historical reasons.  Where would you want to put it.

Worrisome, but like you say below it is too slow in the first place.

<div id="comment:8" align="right">comment:8</div>

> Yep, Historical reasons. Where would you want to put it.

Are there some other character groups implemented? Perhaps it should go to the dual groups?

Another question:

If I compute for example the Kloosterman sum K(2,4,13) in Magma it returns:
2*zeta_13^10 + 2*zeta_13^9 + 2*zeta_13^7 + 2*zeta_13^6 + 2*zeta_13^4 + 2*zeta_13^3

If I compute it with SAGE it returns:
2*zeta156^40 - 2*zeta156^34 + 2*zeta156^28 - 2*zeta156^24 + 2*zeta156^18 - 2*zeta156^14 - 2*zeta156^12 + 2*zeta156^8 - 2*zeta156^2 - 2

This is the same number but it is much more reduced in MAGMA. The corresponding MAGMA code is:

> Kloosterman := func< u, v, n |
>     &+[z^(IntegerRing() ! (u*x+v*x^-1)) : x in F | IsUnit(x) ]
>         where z is RootOfUnity(n, CyclotomicField(n))
>         where F is ResidueClassRing(n) >;

REFEREE REPORT:

This patch needs work.  Just totally delete the first part of the patch that
replaces lines 636-652 by nothing and calls kloosterman_sum, since kloosterman_sum is much slower.  Just leave the code like it used to be.

Otherwise, i think the code is good to have included in sage.    In particular, the issue the author raises about the representation of a certain output and a root of unity is interesting, but not something to stop this patch from going in.

So I think with some very obvious simple work, this can easily be included.  Just delete the part that will slow down the gauss_sum.
