Hi Kilian,

Aside from the fact that this is a number theory ticket everything looks good. Hopefully somebody will review this patch shortly.

QUESTION:

You've rewritten some of the functions to be more general, e.g., this

```
707	 	            z *= zeta 
708	 	            g += phi(c)*z 
```
becomes this:

```
763	                z = zeta ** (a*e + b*(e**(-1))) 
764	                g += phi(self.__call__(c))*z        
```

What impact does this have on performance in the original case of computing Gauss
sums?  Is it slower or faster or the same?

Also, why use 

```
self.__call__(c)
```
instead of 

```
self(c)
```
?

Yep, Historical reasons.  Where would you want to put it.

Worrisome, but like you say below it is too slow in the first place.

Are there some other character groups implemented? Perhaps it should go to the dual groups?

Another question:

If I compute for example the Kloosterman sum K(2,4,13) in Magma it returns:
2*zeta_13^10 + 2*zeta_13^9 + 2*zeta_13^7 + 2*zeta_13^6 + 2*zeta_13^4 + 2*zeta_13^3

If I compute it with SAGE it returns:
2*zeta156^40 - 2*zeta156^34 + 2*zeta156^28 - 2*zeta156^24 + 2*zeta156^18 - 2*zeta156^14 - 2*zeta156^12 + 2*zeta156^8 - 2*zeta156^2 - 2

This is the same number but it is much more reduced in MAGMA. The corresponding MAGMA code is:

> Kloosterman := func< u, v, n |
>     &+[z^(IntegerRing() ! (u*x+v*x^-1)) : x in F | IsUnit(x) ]
>         where z is RootOfUnity(n, CyclotomicField(n))
>         where F is ResidueClassRing(n) >;

This patch needs work.  Just totally delete the first part of the patch that

Otherwise, i think the code is good to have included in sage.    In particular, the issue the author raises about the representation of a certain output and a root of unity is interesting, but not something to stop this patch from going in.
