Why did you need to patch jquery?  Would it be sufficient to upgrade to the newest jqueryui, which has slider controls with multiple sliders?  I'd rather not maintain a fork of jquery here.

I wouldn't need to generally, but #3735 makes it hard to do anything Javascript-related. The old version works for some reason.

Of course, the best thing for me to do here is fix #3735.

REFEREE REPORT:

* Add documentation to interact? that illustrates how to use range_slider.

* Doing range_slider? gives help on slider instead of range_slider. 

* I tried one example -- see http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/was/patches/3679.png and the displayed positions were different than the values of the variable when I first pressed shift enter.  Dragging the slider fixed this.

```
@interact
def _(t1=range_slider(2, 5, 1/5, (3,4), 'alpha')):
    print t1
    show(plot(sin,t1[0], t1[1]),xmin=t1[0])
```

* In the above example, it seems like the order of the two sliders is reversed?

Is the jQuery patch being upstreamed? Otherwise we will have problems once we upgrade to a newer release of jQuery.
