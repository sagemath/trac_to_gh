Reopening this ticket, since I forgot to update the sage hooks on the linbox library.
Everything went well on installations that had the previous library installed. So the problem only proped up when doing a fresh install.
See [http://groups.google.fr/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/a7067a9a6c9464fc](http://groups.google.fr/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/a7067a9a6c9464fc)

I am attaching a patch fixing this.
