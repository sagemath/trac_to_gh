Define a pentagon in three dimensions.

```
sage: pts = [[0,0,0], [1,0,0], [1,1,0], [.5,1.5,0], [0,1,0], [0,0,0]]
sage: p = line3d(pts)
sage: q = polygon3d(pts, color='teal', opacity=0.25)
sage: pq = p + q
```
With Three.js, the `line3d` renders
polygonally as the outline of the pentagon.

```
sage: pq.show(viewer='threejs')
Launched jmol viewer for Graphics3d Object
```
With Jmol, the `line3d` renders curved,
in the shape of a shield.

```
sage: pq.show(viewer='jmol')
Launched jmol viewer for Graphics3d Object
```

Less important now that the default 3d rendering engine
is Three.js, but still quite puzzling.

One would think `polygon3d` would provide a workaround,
but it lacks `polygon2d`'s options to decide whether
or not to plot the relative interior of the polygon,
the edges, the vertices, and in what colors.
