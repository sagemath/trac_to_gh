This has been officially accepted for Python 2.7, but we need it now.  It is Python/c and takes literally 1 second to install, and supports OSX, Linux, Windows, etc. 

See http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0371/ for more details.

This is easily by far the best library I've ever used for making use of multicore machines.  It's amazing.
