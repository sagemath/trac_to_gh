The Sage preparser stupidly doesn't raise an error when the input is `vector(v)[3] = 5`.  Instead
it does something very confusing.    This was found by Franco Saliola.

```
sage: vector(v)[3] = 5
sage: preparse('vector(v)[3] = 5')
'_=var("v");vector=symbolic_expression(Integer(5)).function(v)'
sage: vector(10)
5
```
