I've uploaded a new SPKG for M2 to:

  http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/malb/spkgs/macaulay2-1.1-r7210.p1.spkg

which fixes a couple of compilation problems:

* UNAME might not be defined
* some standard headers are not included in `overflow.hpp`

**Assignee:** mabshoff

Positive review. A couple remarks:

* The fixes malb did should go upstream.
* I fixed the boehm_gc and gdbm detection code since it only works for default spkgs and not optional ones - my bad.

Cheers,

Michael
