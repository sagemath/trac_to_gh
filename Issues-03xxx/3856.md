This is implied to work by the following doctest in coercion_maps.pyx

```
            sage: mor = NamedConvertMap(SR, GF(7)[['t']], '_polynomial_')

I don't think this is a bug, this should *not* work. Conversion != Coercion.

So `_polynomial_` should also create any underlying conversions needed?

Replying to [@robertwb](#comment%3A1):
