     53     try:

   3123             var = repr(w[0])
   3124 

RuntimeError: no zero in the interval, since constant expression is not 0.
```

And I have traced down the bug to this:

```
sage: sin.variables()
()
sage: (1/tan).variables()
()
```

Since these expressions contain no variables they are deemed constant and since they are not equal to 0 they have no roots.  You can fix your example by trying:

```
sage: find_root(1/tan(x), 1, 2)
1.5707963267948968
```

Also note that this works:

```
sage: (1/tan)(1)
1/tan(1)
```

Although, technically no variables are there to be replaced.

I don't know if this is really a bug or not, or how to fix it.

OK, this passes tests and it seems OK.  One thing I noticed, which I think can be considered beyond the scope of this patch, is that 


```
var('t')
plot(sin(t*x),-1,1)
```
quickly fails with "ValueError: free variable: x", which is good, but:

```
plot(lambda t: sin(t*x),-1,1)
```
tries to plot 400 values and finally gives 

```
verbose 0 (3585: plot.py, _plot) WARNING: When plotting, failed to evaluate function at 400 points.
verbose 0 (3585: plot.py, _plot) Last error message: 'float() argument must be a string or a number'
```
and an empty plot.  It would be nice to speed up that failure if you know an easy way.
