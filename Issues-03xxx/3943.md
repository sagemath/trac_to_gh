pydesign is a very basic GPL2+ package for block designs (http://www.designtheory.org/software/pydesign/). This patch adds a little functionality and a few examples. Needs *lots* more work!

In creates a new subdirectory of sage/combinat and adds several files to that subdirectory. See block_design.py for some examples.

Thank you for the comments. Questions:

(1) How is a block design a nonlinear binary code? Via its incidence matrix? If yes, then users who wish to "play" with block designs using Sage will want commands which are fairly intuitive. So pydesign creates a BaseBlockDesign class and methods for that class.

(2) Re "the main thing they seem to implement is isomorphism of block designs, which is already part of the partn_ref module (nonlinear binary codes, in refinement_binary),...": First, "we" is me in this case. (Peter D wrote the base class, which I butchered/hacked up/modified, and most of the XML stuff; I did the rest - GAP wrappers, etc. See http://designtheory.org/software/pydesign/ for his version.). Second, the automorphism of a block design is computed using NICE, so that function *does* call Cython. 
Should I rewrite it to the new matrix automorphism function?

(3) I'm happy to scrap the XML stuff for now and maybe add it back in later. I don't really understand how they use that interface anyway. The files bd* in the pydesign subdirectory could also possibly be eliminated and the statistics format could be deleted. Suggestions/comments appreciated!

Optimally, a `BlockDesign` class would extend a more general `IncidenceStructure` class, and much of the functionality would go in there.

Certainly faster than NICE, since these routines know not to include the blocks in the partitions which determine the search tree (I can explain a little more if you want...).\n\n> (3) I'm happy to scrap the XML stuff for now and maybe add it back in later.

I just want to raise the initial point rlm made: Why should we merge this? The XML seems like a bad, bad idea and whatever functionality is missing can (according to rlm) be easily added via our own code. 

Since this requires an spkg I see little possibility for this make to make it past the inclusion procedure. We had the first rejection in form of gp2c and I feel the same that we should stop including "random" and likely half baked code.

This is (AFAIK) pure Sage/python. I stripped out the majority of the original pydesign code and rewrote it. It does have one (very short) method which outputs the design in xml. Are you suggesting to delete that method? It does not communicate in xml (though I think the original pydesign has that option) since I stripped that part out.

Ok, taking a closer look I see that you copy some substantial amount of code from that Python code base. It seems to duplicate a bunch if things already in Sage in one form or another, i.e. 

* def binomial_new(n, k)
* def int_div

The version number code is more than ugly and uses IMHO rather non-standard tags, i.e. why the external CVS version?

> This is (AFAIK) pure Sage/python. I stripped out the majority of the original pydesign code and rewrote it. It does have one (very short) method which outputs the design in xml.

Then why add the XML method? Is that some kind of standard that is actually used by other code? As rlm originally pointed out: If you turn 7 bits of info into a couple dozen lines of ASCII the efficiency goes right out of the window and it isn't exactly human readable.

This ticket also does not belong to the sage-combinat milestone unless you plan to submit the code via the sage-combinat patch server.

mismatches with almost every other sage module out there.

If you are comparing two lists of ints, `block_cmp` gives exactly the same output as `cmp`, so I'm not sure why it's there. `int_div`, `binomial_new` similarly don't seem necessary. 

`ProjectiveGeometryDesign` is a perfect example, I think, of how not to use the GAP interface in Sage. I think the number of calls to `gap.eval` could certainly be reduced.

`IncidenceStructure` should not be the base class for block designs, since it is in fact much more general than block designs.

Why is `#!/usr/bin/env python` appearing in the Sage library?

As it is right now, you can create an IncidenceStructure which does not satisfy the definitions, and if you call `is_block_design`, it will blindly return True, i.e. all IncidenceStrucures are taken to be block designs. This is bad. Further, the code in the commented block calls GAP, when in fact the axioms of a block design are easily checked, and should be done in Sage. Also, would there be in the future any functions which are particular to the block design assumption? If so you might consider making `BlockDesign` a separate class which inherits from `IncidenceStructure`.\n\n- Have you run these doctests with `sage -t -optional`? I don't think you have, since for example `gap.eval(\"IsBinaryBlockDesign(\"+gD+\")\")==\"true\"` will surely fail because of the quotation marks.\n\n- I'd really like to see this patch's dependence on GAP decrease more. One task which would go a very far way in doing this would be to implement #1323, which shouldn't really be all that hard, since it would ultimately just be an exercise in linear algebra.",

David,

Thank you for putting up with such a tedious review process. This new patch is looking good. Here are a few comments I have on the new patch:

- I only recently learned this. When you have a block comment at the top of the file, the first line is used as a subject heading for the reference manual. Whatever that line is, is used for the title of that section in the manual. So, something like `A module to help with constructions and computations of block designs and other incidence structures.` as you have it in block_design.py is better off as something more like `Block Designs`.

- I still think that the class `IncidenceStructure` belongs somewhere else than in `block_design.py`, although I'm not sure where it should go. I had once thought that `sage.graphs` should be something like `sage.incidence_structures`, and from there we would have designs, graphs, hypergraphs, etc. Although, the naming is ugly, and this is probably not the right approach. Any thoughts you have on this are welcome.

- There cannot be any new functions in any patch to be merged without doctests, including auxiliary functions used only internally. In particular, `tdesign_params`, `IncidenceStructure.__init__`, `IncidenceStructure.__repr__`, `IncidenceStructure.blocks`, `IncidenceStructure.blocks_from_gap`, `IncidenceStructure._get_block_sizes`, and `IncidenceStructure.points` all need doctests.

- Is there any particular reason you define `_get_incidence_matrix` and `incidence_matrix`? The latter seems good enough, and there are a couple functions that start with `_get`, and I don't see why.

- You have commented out the check in `BlockDesign` to see whether the input satisfies the definition. I think this is a good idea, and should be put back in. As it is right now, you can create an IncidenceStructure which does not satisfy the definitions, and if you call `is_block_design`, it will blindly return True, i.e. all IncidenceStrucures are taken to be block designs. This is bad. Further, the code in the commented block calls GAP, when in fact the axioms of a block design are easily checked, and should be done in Sage. Also, would there be in the future any functions which are particular to the block design assumption? If so you might consider making `BlockDesign` a separate class which inherits from `IncidenceStructure`.

- Have you run these doctests with `sage -t -optional`? I don't think you have, since for example `gap.eval("IsBinaryBlockDesign("+gD+")")=="true"` will surely fail because of the quotation marks.

- I'd really like to see this patch's dependence on GAP decrease more. One task which would go a very far way in doing this would be to implement #1323, which shouldn't really be all that hard, since it would ultimately just be an exercise in linear algebra.

Maybe the class `IncidenceStructure` belongs in its own module, say `incidence_structures.py`? Which directory it goes in might does not matter so much, so why not put both in designs? What do you think?

I just saw your post regarding a `subspaces` method for a
`FreeModule` over a finite field. I'll work on that next.
(I don't think I need the projective case - as you pointed out in your second post it is a trivial consquence of the affine case.)

Will do. Please let me know what you think of the above 
`IncidenceStructure` idea though.

I don't understand this. It had a docstring and a test.

Sorry I forgot. Done now.

To me this makes mathematical sense so I added a 
line 

```
BlockDesign_generic = IncidenceStructure
```
but there are no methods I know of currently
(maybe this will change in the future) which
apply to block designs and not incidence structures.

Yes.

Done. I added an option method="gap" as well.

Please apply the 7 patches in order to 3.1.3.alpha1. They pass sage -t -optional.

3. Created a new an rigorous (and very slow) is_block_design, following an off-list suggestion of the referee.
4. Added some material to some of the docstrings.
