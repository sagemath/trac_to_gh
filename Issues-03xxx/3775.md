```

```
However, this is what happens when I invoke maxima, from the sage
directory:

$ /Applications/sage/local/bin/maxima
dyld: Library not loaded: /Users/was/build/sage-3.0.5/local/lib/
libreadline.5.2.dylib
  Referenced from: /Applications/sage/local/lib/maxima/5.13.0/binary-
clisp/lisp.run
  Reason: image not found
Trace/BPT trap 
```
The solution is to source local/bin/sage-env before starting Maxima.

Cheers,

Michael
