In GMail, when the Inbox is empty, a message is displayed in the
center of the screen advertising Google Reader or Google News:

   No new mail! Want to read updates from your favorite sites? Try
Google Reader

(See it here: http://sevennine.net/post-images/empty-inbox-gmail.png)

I like it's simplicity and effectiveness. Perhaps the notebook can
display a similar message, something like: "Welcome to Sage! You can
create a [new worksheet], view some [published worksheets], or read
some [documentation]." (I'm using [] to denote links.)
