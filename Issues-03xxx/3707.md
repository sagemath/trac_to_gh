The attached patch is here like a request for comments. 

We are about to release a new sympy that contains thorough tests for Sage <-> SymPy conversion:

http://hg.sympy.org/sympy/file/16cfc09420ee/sympy/test_external/test_sage.py

When sage 3.0.6 gets released, I'll create a new sympy spkg and expand tests in Sage too, so that we are sure things work in Sage environment too.

Replying to [@certik](#comment%3A3):
> Thanks for the review. I'll write doctests and learn about late_import() to see how I could use it.

Examples of this idea (we don't have a framework for that), can be found in:

* `sage.rings.finite_field_givaro`
* `sage.libs.pari.gen`
* `sage.rings.integer`

Looking at those should get you started.

malb: I wrote docstrings and doctests. I didn't use late_import(), as I think in pure python it won't slow things that much and there is a question where I should put this late_import(). But if you think it's necessary, I'll fix that.

I'd give the patches a positive review if my fixes are accepted by Ondrej. Ondrej, you now need to check my fixup patch and review it. If you settle for a positive review, then you can change the title to `positive review`.

I give this a positive review. Ondrej could give the release manager (probably mabshoff) a precise list of patches to apply in which order in a comment? I suspect:

* trac_3707_fixup.2.patch

Yes, apply the new spkg first and then the patches in exactly this order.

Thanks for the review!

Ondrej,

I did a number of cleanups to spkg-install and SPKG.txt. SPKG.txt still needs some more work, but I guess this has been a step in the right direction. Please base future sympy.spkgs of this one - I did not change the version number.

Cheers,

Michael
