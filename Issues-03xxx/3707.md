The attached patch is here like a request for comments. 

We are about to release a new sympy that contains thorough tests for Sage <-> SymPy conversion:

http://hg.sympy.org/sympy/file/16cfc09420ee/sympy/test_external/test_sage.py

When sage 3.0.6 gets released, I'll create a new sympy spkg and expand tests in Sage too, so that we are sure things work in Sage environment too.

**Assignee:** @garyfurnish

**Resolution:** fixed

> Thanks for the review. I'll write doctests and learn about late_import() to see how I could use it.


Examples of this idea (we don't have a framework for that), can be found in:

* `sage.rings.finite_field_givaro`
* `sage.libs.pari.gen`
* `sage.rings.integer`

Looking at those should get you started.

**Referee Report**
* one new function didn't have a doctest (fixed in attached patch)
* some doctests were failing (fixed in attached patch)
* `#indirect doctest` directive was missing to make `sage -coverage` happy (fixed in attached patch)
* One typo (fixed in attached patch)

I'd give the patches a positive review if my fixes are accepted by Ondrej. Ondrej, you now need to check my fixup patch and review it. If you settle for a positive review, then you can change the title to `positive review`.

Ondrej,

I did a number of cleanups to spkg-install and SPKG.txt. SPKG.txt still needs some more work, but I guess this has been a step in the right direction. Please base future sympy.spkgs of this one - I did not change the version number.

Cheers,
