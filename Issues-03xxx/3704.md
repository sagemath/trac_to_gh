```
So I think this is a bug 

```
sage: w=vector(RR,[1,2,3])
sage: d=diagonal_matrix(w)
UnboundLocalError: local variable 'v' referenced before assignment
```
The following fails as well

```
sage: d=diagonal_matrix(RR,w) 
```
the only thing that works is 

```
sage: d=diagonal_matrix(RR,list(w))
```
A stupid but easy fix is to try to turn any argument to diagonal_matrix into a list before bailing out (its in matrix/constructor.py), but there should probably be logic actually expecting vectors and analyzing the parents?

Resolution: fixed

The attached patch is a complete rewrite of diagonal_matrix which now does the following:

1. If the first argument is a ring, pop it off the argument list
2. If the next thing can be made into a Sequence, do so and use those elements as the diagonal elements.  If the next thing cannot be made into a sequence, then take the remainder of the argument list and use those things as the diagonal elements.
3. Prepend the ring if one was specified and send everything to the matrix() function.

This changes the syntax slightly; in order to get a matrix of a specific size, you need to pass an nrows and/or ncols option.  But it is very nice in that it allows diagonal_matrix(1,2,3) or, as mentioned in this ticket, diagonal_matrix(v) where v is a vector.

All doctests in sage/matrix/* pass and all doctests elsewhere that I found using diagonal_matrix also pass.

I generally like this patch, and it provides useful functionality.

I applied th patch to 3.0.4 with no problem and all tests in
sage/matrix pass.

Two things seemed strange to me:

1. I cannot see a reason for the provided facility for padding
    with zeros when nrows is given explicitly.  I just cannot think of
    a time when anyone would need this!

2. The example  diagonal_matrix(GF(2),GF(5))  is really crazy.
    [It returns a diagonal matrix of size 5 and entries 0,1,0,1,0,
    using a list of the elements of GF(5) coerced into GF(2)!]

    This is surely a weird side-effect rather than a useful example.
    the same result would come from diagonal_matrix(GF(2),range(5))
    which is a little more sane.

That last example would not even work if it were not possible to
coerce from GF(5) to GF(2).  And I really think that should not be
possible.  Does it still happen in the "new coercion model", I wonder?

Okay, with the example: 

```
sage: matrix(GF(101), 2, [1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4])
[ 1 51]
[34 76]
```
that comes from `GF(101)(1/2)` giving 51, etc.  I just hand it off to the matrix() constructor, which in turn hands the job off to the MatrixSpace constructor.

As to another point, I get:

```
sage: diagonal_matrix(x^3+3, x+1)

[x^3 + 3       0]
[      0   x + 1]
```
so with x being a symbolic variable, things work fine.

However, if we have an iterable object, then things are not so good.  In that case, the patch tries to construct a Sequence object from the iterable object, which is where you get your weird results.

I'm changing the patch so that if a list or tuple is passed in, then it tries to construct Sequence object from that list or tuple.  Note that this is only for backwards-compatibility, so we can still pass a list into diagonal_matrix and have it return what it used to return.

I just added a patch, to be applied on top of the first patch, which does two things:

1. Makes a trivial simplification in the code

2. Adds a doctest illustrating the sparse keyword.

Hmm, can we sort out this mess, i.e. what to do about #2577? The consensus seems to be to merge theses patches and close #2577?

An final positive review will also be good since Jason did add a second patch.

Cheers,

Michael

Let's agree to kill #2577 since it does nothing which these patches do not do, and these are now a lot better.

I applied both patches to 3.1.2.alpha3 with no problems.  All the above examples now work and give sensible answers.  They are not all included as doctests though.

I hit a doctest error in sage/matrix/matrix_integer_dense_hnf.py:

```

Exception raised:

      File "/home/john/sage-3.1.2.alpha3/local/lib/python2.5/site-packages/sage/matrix/constructor.py", line 736, in diagonal_matrix

      File "/home/john/sage-3.1.2.alpha3/local/lib/python2.5/site-packages/sage/matrix/constructor.py", line 613, in prepare
        raise TypeError, "unable to find a common ring for all elements"
    TypeError: unable to find a common ring for all elements
```
This is trivial to fix, and I added a trivial patch which fixes it.

Conclusion:  kill #2577 and merge this one (all three patches).  I assume mabshoff can take on the responsibility of reviewing the final mini-patch!
