```
So I think this is a bug 

```
sage: w=vector(RR,[1,2,3])
sage: d=diagonal_matrix(w)
UnboundLocalError: local variable 'v' referenced before assignment
```
The following fails as well

```
sage: d=diagonal_matrix(RR,w) 
```
the only thing that works is 

```
sage: d=diagonal_matrix(RR,list(w))
```
A stupid but easy fix is to try to turn any argument to diagonal_matrix into a list before bailing out (its in matrix/constructor.py), but there should probably be logic actually expecting vectors and analyzing the parents?

Component: **linear algebra**

All doctests in sage/matrix/* pass and all doctests elsewhere that I found using diagonal_matrix also pass.

I generally like this patch, and it provides useful functionality.

I applied th patch to 3.0.4 with no problem and all tests in
sage/matrix pass.

Two things seemed strange to me:

1. I cannot see a reason for the provided facility for padding
    with zeros when nrows is given explicitly.  I just cannot think of
    a time when anyone would need this!

2. The example  diagonal_matrix(GF(2),GF(5))  is really crazy.
    [It returns a diagonal matrix of size 5 and entries 0,1,0,1,0,
    using a list of the elements of GF(5) coerced into GF(2)!]

    This is surely a weird side-effect rather than a useful example.
    the same result would come from diagonal_matrix(GF(2),range(5))
    which is a little more sane.

That last example would not even work if it were not possible to
coerce from GF(5) to GF(2).  And I really think that should not be
possible.  Does it still happen in the "new coercion model", I wonder?

    "body": "<div id=\"comment:9\" align=\"right\">comment:9</div>\n\nThanks for the feedback!  I'm at a conference now, so I won't have time to address point 2 for a few days.  However, to address point 1: the previous version of diagonal_matrix allowed for the rows to be specified and padded with zeros.  I was providing an example which showed how to achieve this effect.  Basically, I'm also showing that behavior is like the matrix() command (to which I am just blindly passing all keyword arguments, except for some special behavior about the sparse keyword).  So: the behavior is a result of the behavior of matrix() and shows how to achieve a former behavior of diagonal_matrix.  Whether or not it is actually useful is another issue: if anyone did use this feature, though, it might be nice to have an example of how to do it with the new diagonal_matrix.\n\nI also agree that coercion should play a role, as pointed out in point 2.  I'll look at that early next week, hopefully.\n\nThanks again!",

Thanks for the feedback!  I'm at a conference now, so I won't have time to address point 2 for a few days.  However, to address point 1: the previous version of diagonal_matrix allowed for the rows to be specified and padded with zeros.  I was providing an example which showed how to achieve this effect.  Basically, I'm also showing that behavior is like the matrix() command (to which I am just blindly passing all keyword arguments, except for some special behavior about the sparse keyword).  So: the behavior is a result of the behavior of matrix() and shows how to achieve a former behavior of diagonal_matrix.  Whether or not it is actually useful is another issue: if anyone did use this feature, though, it might be nice to have an example of how to do it with the new diagonal_matrix.

I also agree that coercion should play a role, as pointed out in point 2.  I'll look at that early next week, hopefully.

Thanks again!

Okay, with the example: 

```
sage: matrix(GF(101), 2, [1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4])
[ 1 51]
[34 76]
```
that comes from `GF(101)(1/2)` giving 51, etc.  I just hand it off to the matrix() constructor, which in turn hands the job off to the MatrixSpace constructor.

As to another point, I get:

```
sage: diagonal_matrix(x^3+3, x+1)

[x^3 + 3       0]
[      0   x + 1]
```
so with x being a symbolic variable, things work fine.

However, if we have an iterable object, then things are not so good.  In that case, the patch tries to construct a Sequence object from the iterable object, which is where you get your weird results.

I'm changing the patch so that if a list or tuple is passed in, then it tries to construct Sequence object from that list or tuple.  Note that this is only for backwards-compatibility, so we can still pass a list into diagonal_matrix and have it return what it used to return.

Let's agree to kill #2577 since it does nothing which these patches do not do, and these are now a lot better.

I applied both patches to 3.1.2.alpha3 with no problems.  All the above examples now work and give sensible answers.  They are not all included as doctests though.

I hit a doctest error in sage/matrix/matrix_integer_dense_hnf.py:

```

    TypeError: unable to find a common ring for all elements

This is trivial to fix, and I added a trivial patch which fixes it.

Conclusion:  kill #2577 and merge this one (all three patches).  I assume mabshoff can take on the responsibility of reviewing the final mini-patch!
