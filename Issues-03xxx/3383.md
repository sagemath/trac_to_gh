While testing/reviewing #3377 I found a problem with E.division_points() over a number field:

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve('19a1')
sage: K.<t> = NumberField(x^9-3*x^8-4*x^7+16*x^6-3*x^5-21*x^4+5*x^3+7*x^2-7*x+1)
sage: EK = E.base_extend(K)
sage: E(0).division_points(3)
[(0 : 1 : 0), (5 : -10 : 1), (5 : 9 : 1)]
sage: EK(0).division_points(3)

It looks quite deep in polynomial code but might turn out to be something simple.

It works for me too.  I think that something deep down changed, so now it just works.

It is still true that I am working on improving division poly stuff -- but on a clone which is on a machine currently broken, preventing me from finishing it off.

In the meantime, let's just close this.

I agree, but let's add a doctest to catch this in case someone breaks it again.
