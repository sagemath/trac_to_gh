Positive revivew, but we should then also remove the three offending files from MANIFEST.in. I am doing an sdist with the patch applied to make 100% sure it works.

I can now confirm this actually works:

```
mabshoff@sage:/scratch/mabshoff/release-cycle/sage-3.0.4.alpha2/dist/sage-3.0.4.foo/spkg/standard$ tar xjf sage-3.0.4.foo.spkg 
mabshoff@sage:/scratch/mabshoff/release-cycle/sage-3.0.4.alpha2/dist/sage-3.0.4.foo/spkg/standard$ cd sage-3.0.4.foo
mabshoff@sage:/scratch/mabshoff/release-cycle/sage-3.0.4.alpha2/dist/sage-3.0.4.foo/spkg/standard/sage-3.0.4.foo$ hg status
mabshoff@sage:/scratch/mabshoff/release-cycle/sage-3.0.4.alpha2/dist/sage-3.0.4.foo/spkg/standard/sage-3.0.4.foo$ 
```
sage-3.0.4.foo is the sdisted 3.0.4.a2 with the patch applied :)

Cheers,

Michael
