Here's a crazy bug:

```
sage: m = diagonal_matrix(ZZ, 68, [2]*66 + [1,1])
sage: m.det()
-73786800370889000442
sage: m.det(proof=False)
73786976294838206464
```

Amusingly, the `proof=False` one is correct. Fix is attached.

<a id='comment:6'></a>This pops up on my MacBook Pro, and whatever hardware Nils was running on (his linux laptop, not sure beyond that). 

I just checked -- reverting this patch gets me the same error:

```
sage: diagonal_matrix(ZZ, 68, [2]*66 + [1,1]).det()
-73786800370889000442
```

The bound that gets determined in that function is also wrong -- in this case, the divisor it finds is 2, and the final determinant is 2^66:

```
sage: 2^66
73786976294838206464
sage: 2^66 < 10^20
True
sage: 2^66 < 10^20//2
False
```
