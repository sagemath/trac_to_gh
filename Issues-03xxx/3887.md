Here's a crazy bug:

```
sage: m = diagonal_matrix(ZZ, 68, [2]*66 + [1,1])
sage: m.det()
-73786800370889000442
sage: m.det(proof=False)
73786976294838206464
```

Amusingly, the `proof=False` one is correct. Fix is attached.

Merged in Sage 3.1.2.alpha0.

Craig: Did Nils find or also fix the bug, i.e. does he get credit?

Cheers,

What hardware was this on? I'm having trouble reproducing this bug (after reverting your changes) and it immensely slows down hnf and det computations.

This pops up on my MacBook Pro, and whatever hardware Nils was running on (his linux laptop, not sure beyond that). 

I just checked -- reverting this patch gets me the same error:

```
sage: diagonal_matrix(ZZ, 68, [2]*66 + [1,1]).det()
-73786800370889000442
```

The bound that gets determined in that function is also wrong -- in this case, the divisor it finds is 2, and the final determinant is 2^66:

```
sage: 2^66
73786976294838206464
sage: 2^66 < 10^20
True
sage: 2^66 < 10^20//2
False
```
