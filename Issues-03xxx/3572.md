on osx, BEFORE:

```
teragon-2:matrix was$ sage -startuptime |grep linbox
            sage.libs.linbox.linbox: 0.270 (matrix_modn_dense)
0.270 sage.libs.linbox.linbox (matrix_modn_dense)
```

AFTER

```
teragon-2:matrix was$ sage -startuptime |grep linbox
teragon-2:matrix was$ 
```

Of course now,

```
sage: time a = matrix(ZZ,2)
CPU times: user 0.34 s, sys: 0.01 s, total: 0.35 s
Wall time: 0.36 s
sage: time a = matrix(ZZ,3)
CPU times: user 0.00 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.00 s
Wall time: 0.00 s
```

but that makes a lot of sense.  Only make people pay if they use the goods.

The patch doesn't apply cleanly any more, as you might expect.  I only got one doctest failure, from the following issue (not the one mabshoff reported, perhaps because that doctest in the patch didn't apply): 

```
sage: os.system('sage -startuptime | grep linbox')
           sage.libs.linbox.linbox: 0.006 (sage.matrix.matrix_modn_dense)
0
```
So there's another import which needs to be removed...
