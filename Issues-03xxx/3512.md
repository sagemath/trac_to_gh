John Voight ran into a problem running dsage that is caused by a bug in the version of sqlalchemy (0.4.3) we ship. The latest upstream stable version is 0.4.6. 
All dsage unit tests pass with the new sqlalchemy installed, and I think dsage is the only package using sqlalchemy currently.

Here is the new spkg:

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/yqiang/spkgs/sqlalchemy-0.4.6.p0.spkg

I commented out copying the documentation since it's readily available online, and I saw very little else in $SAGE_ROOT/local/doc. Feel to uncomment that if need be.
