Salman Butt ran into the following bug:

```
sage: V = QQ**2
sage: W = V.subspace([[1,2]])
sage: W([2,1])
(2, 1)
```

Fix is attached, but the fact that you can still do the following is possibly worrisome:

```
sage: V = QQ**2
sage: W = V.subspace([[1,2]])
sage: W([2,1], check=False) in W
True
```

I just started a sage-devel thread to see if we should also stop this, i.e. not let users shoot themselves in the foot so easily.
