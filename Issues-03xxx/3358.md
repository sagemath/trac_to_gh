After sitting waiting for some answers on the last thread about this on debian-sage
I decided to go ahead. This patch do not add versionning for debian as it seems
to cause problem on other OS. It builds static objects (libraries and executables)
without any pic flag and shared object with pic flag on linux. I respected the earlier
setting where the flag is set in spkg-install and it is set to nothing on OS X and
CYGWIN although I think it should be set as well on this platform.
I also move executables in a created bin directory for convenience (this directory
is created by the Makefile).
I cleaned the spkg-install to accommodate the changes and added a few fix that I
thought necessary. -fPIC to -fpic, those are 2 slightly different flags, I don't
think I should go on the technical differences between them. I also cleaned
a conditional block were linux specific code would be executed on darwin - probably
without harm but still.

Hi Michael,

I didn't think you would take it anyway as it has
GNU-ism like:
(SO_LIBNAME): FPICFLAG= $(PICFLAG)
	export FPICFLAG

I thought a bit more about -fPIC versus -fPIC and
I guess in the interest of KISS we should probably
stick to -fPIC as ppc and may be other may balk 
otherwise.

<div id="comment:9" align="right">Comment 9</div>

I think there are some issues with eclib-ungnu.patch:

* the formal changes, i.e. the removal of the ".o" from the makefiles should be independent of the other changes for reviewing purposes
* some of the fixes will have the makefiles as is working with Sage, but if anyone attempted to compile eclib without explicitly setting env variables like NTL the compile will break or the build will not include features like pari support. I don't care which way we go here, but this is up to John since it is his code project.

As is the patch needs to be rebased slighly:

```
/eclib-20080310.p7/src$ patch -p1 --dry-run < eclib-ungnu.patch\?format\=raw 
patching file Makefile
Hunk #4 FAILED at 45.
1 out of 4 hunks FAILED -- saving rejects to file Makefile.rej
patching file Makefile.dynamic
patching file g0n/Makefile
Hunk #2 succeeded at 25 with fuzz 2.
patching file procs/Makefile
Hunk #2 FAILED at 23.
1 out of 6 hunks FAILED -- saving rejects to file procs/Makefile.rej
patching file qcurves/Makefile
patching file qrank/Makefile
```

I am -1 on all the other three patches at this ticket. Some of those might be salvaged, i.e. from the spkg-install patches like the better installation, but the PIC->pic change is just plain wrong.

Cheers,

Michael

I am happy to go along with whatever is best for Sage. I agree that one should be able to type "make" without setting environment variables manually.  John

It can be simplified\nif we remove it. It is a remnant of the various building options that weren't\nused in sage but could be restored with a bit of creativity and some environment\nvariables.\n\n> * some of the fixes will have the makefiles as is working with Sage, but if anyone attempted to compile eclib without explicitly setting env variables like NTL the compile will break or the build will not include features like pari support.

Hi guys,

I am a bit out of action at the moment but I should comment on what I
had done and why.

Replying to [@sagetrac-mabshoff](#comment%3A9):
> I think there are some issues with eclib-ungnu.patch:
> 
> * the formal changes, i.e. the removal of the ".o" from the makefiles should be independent of the other changes for reviewing purposes

I reviewed my patch and the removal of the ".o" and its inclusion in
$(OBJ_SUF) and $(SOBJ_SUF) was needed to write a working ".SUFFIXES:"
old unix style rule and keep putting "_n" in the object. It can be simplified
if we remove it. It is a remnant of the various building options that weren't
used in sage but could be restored with a bit of creativity and some environment
variables.

> * some of the fixes will have the makefiles as is working with Sage, but if anyone attempted to compile eclib without explicitly setting env variables like NTL the compile will break or the build will not include features like pari support. I don't care which way we go here, but this is up to John since it is his code project.
> 

The behavior before and after the patch is currently the same if you
don't set any variables. It defaults to look for stuff in /usr/local .
Either you do some autodetection or you pass variables. It probably 
should be documented in a README.

I'll have a look and rebase it if that's all it takes.

> I am -1 on all the other three patches at this ticket. Some of those might be salvaged, i.e. from the spkg-install patches like the better installation, but the PIC->pic change is just plain wrong.
> 

The two first patches are really obsolete in many ways. And yes, after doing
some growing up I realise PIC->pic is wrong for something like sage. It is 
debatable that it could be selected appropriately at the start of the building 
process but that wouldn't be KISS.

<div id="comment:12" align="right">Comment 12</div>

OK it took me a little bit more time than expected - because of life and going back to this uncovered several "itches". So in summary there are two patches.
eclib-ungnu.patch:
*rebased on 20080310.p7
*do away with multiple building options we only build with ntl - that simplifies the suffixes of object files.
*created an install target
*Got enough of sub-makefile including the top makefile just for environment variables,
creating a lot of noise about over-riding target and so on - splitting was the only option that I knew would result in something compatible with BSD make (and incidentally sun make: bonus!).

spkg.patch:
*rebased on 20080310.p7
*updated spkg-install to reflect changes in makefiles and the setting of environment variables.
*included a Makefile.env in the patch directory to put the environment variables correctly for sage.

cheers,
Francois
