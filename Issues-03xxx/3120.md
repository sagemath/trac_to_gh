Bill Hart goes through great lengths to explain the algorithm in gp (which is used by Sage) to compute bernoulli() in the messages in this thread: http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/e861c6956ea1a5af

This algorithm documentation ought to be added to either Sage or gp if it is correct (no doubt that it is, coming from Bill!)
