Maxima has good symbolic summation and it would be easy to wrap in the calculus package.
We are constantly getting stuff like this:

```
02:53 < nagyv> hello! how can I represent a summation in sage? like sum_{x=1}^N x, I would like to take the limit as N goes to infinity
03:02 < nagyv> what the heck is this? maxima.sum(1/x, x, 1, 2*N) gives 2*N/x! why?
```

Probably the only reason that this hasn't been done yet is the calculus rewrite by gfurnish.
That is *not* a good enough reason, and don't worry, the work won't be lost.

I would like to add a +1 to this proposal as I'm not planning on implementing symbolic summation anytime in the near (or far) future, so I would be really happy if someone would work on this.

"sum" is probably the most appropriate name for this, but we'd have to make sure that it behaves the same way as Python's sum.

Many thanks for the patch, this was long overdue. A few comments after reading your patch:

Your patch replicates the way integrate/integral works perfectly. Though, as Mike wrote in [comment:3](#comment%3A3), we should just call this `sum`. There is also a discussion about naming here:

http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/bd4eb3b613c98030

I suggest putting a `sum()` function in `sage.misc.misc_c`, that calls python's `sum()` or your function based on the type/number of the arguments. Would you like to do this or should I?

Here are some suggested changes:

* rename all instances of the method to `sum` or `symbolic_sum`
* you should import your function before the doctests in `calculus.py` to make sure you call the right function
* it would be good to add a comment to #6197 pointing to the comment you have in `calculus.py`
* you could add your code for converting MMA output back to Sage to a `_sage_()` method in `sage.interfaces.mathematica.MathematicaElement`, see the `MagmaElement` class in `sage.interfaces.magma` for an example, similarly for Maple output
* In the last lines of the docstring for `sage.symbolic.expression.Expression.summation`, choosen -> chosen


In the long term, I would like to see `integral` and `sum` constructs as subclasses of `sage.symbolic.function.SFunction`, instead of the current thin wrappers around maxima functionality. I will take a look at the feasibility of doing this over the weekend. I don't want to hold your patch back for this though.

It would be great if you could do this.

I will take care of these.

This is definitely necessary. Currently there is no way to interact with an unevaluated integral or sum.

I posted a new patch that takes care of these issues.

The second patch (sum.patch) renames summation to sum. This currently overwrites the python sum command.

I uploaded a new patch in attachment:trac_3587-maxima_simplify_sum.patch. This has both patches folded together, and renames `sum()` to `symbolic_sum()` in `sage/calculus/calculus.py` and `sage/misc/functional.py` eliminating the risk of people using the symbolic sum instead of sum in library code without realizing, and the need to import `__builtin__`.

I am OK with the patch, and ready to give it a positive review. However, there is a problem, maxima returns wrong results in certain cases:

```
sage: sum(binomial(n,k), k, 1, n)
2^n - 2
sage: sum(binomial(n,k), k, 2, n)
2^n - 2*n - 2
sage: r=sum(binomial(n,k), k, 2, n-2)
sage: r.simplify()
2^n - 1/6*n^3 - 11/6*n - 2
```

It seems that maxima doesn't handle definite sums with "non natural" bounds. I.e., in the examples above the bounds don't span the whole support of the expression, so one needs further processing to get the final result after calling Zeilberger's algorithm.

Indefinite sums seem to be fine. In this case, we could check the inputs, and raise a warning if we have a definite sum. I'll try to do this, but don't count on me since I already signed up for a lot this week.

I installed this, but it does not seem to work as advertised.  Namely, 

```
sage: var('n,k')
(k, n)
sage: sum(binomial(n,k),k,0,n)
simplify_sum(sum(binomial(n,k),k,0,n))
```
It does behave as desired if I go to Maxima and load(simplify_sum) etc., but that's not the same.  Somehow it's staying symbolic for some reason.  This is off of 4.1.1 on Mac OSX.5.

Looks like this problem is fixed in Maxima 5.19 (at least they work properly in 5.19.1), so this is another good reason to get that in Sage soon (there was an experimental spkg posted at [http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/kirkby/Solaris-fixes/maxima-5.19.0/maxima-5.19.0.spkg](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/kirkby/Solaris-fixes/maxima-5.19.0/maxima-5.19.0.spkg) at one point).

The latest .spkg in #6699 (and hence in 4.1.2.alpha0) should fix the problems Burcin mentions, and seems to handle all the sums properly.

```
sage: sum(binomial(n,k), k, 1, n)
2^n - 2
sage: sum(binomial(n,k), k, 2, n)
2^n - 2*n - 2
```
are now

```
sage: var('k,n')
(k, n)
sage: sum(binomial(n,k),k,0,n)
2^n
sage: sum(binomial(n,k),k,1,n)
2^n - 1
sage: sum(binomial(n,k),k,2,n)
2^n - n - 1
```
So perhaps a new patch based on 4.1.2.alpha0 is in order, but then the review should be quite straightforward, with the fix above.

Okay, I fixed those tests; there were identical ones elsewhere I did fix but functional.py escaped me.  I also think I fixed the note issue.  

Since #6197 is merged I also used the correct algorithm=maxima behavior.  I don't have Maple so I didn't feel comfortable changing the Maple behavior, but it would be easy to open a new ticket for that if the appropriate algorithm worked, which it certainly seems like it should post-#6197.

I'm going to assume that the builtin sum is indeed okay - great!

Looks like I have been a little too late.

I have checked that algorithm=maple also works without the workaround for #6197.
I think it is save to remove it.
