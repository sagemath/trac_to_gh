```
[13:32] <wstein> Is there a ticket up for pbori.pyx not passing?
[13:32] <mabshoff> nope.
[13:33] <wstein> I propose that we put a --long in there to mean "need more ram".
[13:33] <mabshoff> You mean because it uses so much RAM?
[13:33] <mabshoff> yes
[13:33] <wstein> Yes.
[13:33] <wstein> --long meaning "--big" or something.
[13:33] <mabshoff> :)
[13:33] <wstein> It's annoying that pbori.pyx fails on so many of my test machines.
[13:33] <mabshoff> yep
[13:34] <mabshoff> I usually just ignore pbori.pyx failures, which is somewhat dangerous.
[13:34] <mabshoff> fixed
[13:34] <wstein> exactly.
[13:34] <wstein> Can you make a ticket?
[13:34] <mabshoff> sure

Patch looks good to me. I will do some testing to see how much less RAM we need with the patch applied.

Hi Martin,

after discussing the issue with William in IRC: How about first upgrading to the PolyBoRi 0.4 release that Alexander just mentioned, check out the result with valdring. If there still is a large memory leak we apply this patch, open a new ticket to fix the memory leak and then revert the longs once the leaks are plugged.

Cheers,

Because this continues to be a problem with 3.0.2.alpha1 we will apply this patch to 3.0.2. Once #3264 has been merged [the upgrade to PolyBoRi 0.4] we will revisit the issue.
