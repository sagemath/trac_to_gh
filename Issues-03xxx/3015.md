In sage-3.0 on OSX and linux (sage.math.washington.edu) if you do the following:

```
  sage: from Crypto.Cipher import DES
  sage: DES??
```
You get a bunch of binary garbage on your screen. I tried the same thing in vanilla ipython and it correctly told me that it could not open the source file. 

Component: **user interface**

I get an error now instead of binary junk.  I think this was probably fixed with the new IPython update.
