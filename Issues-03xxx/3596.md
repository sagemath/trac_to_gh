The attached patch fixes some trivial errors in ref.tex, an obvious error in tut.tex (missing \fi), and gets rid of deleting the .ind files, and removes a stupid comment. 

I'm a little unsure about not deleting those ind files.   It really shouldn't be necessary.

OK, this patch puts the "rm *.ind" back, and simply issues two makes instead of one.  It works fine for me.
