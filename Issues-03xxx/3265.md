Some doctests [likely notebook related] leave files in $SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage:

```
hg status
? sage/server/docs-0.html
? sage/server/docs-1.html
? sage/server/docs-2.html
? sage/server/notebook/a.txt
```
This is problematic for two reasons:
* temp files should be written to SAGE_TESTDIR since that is guaranteed to be writable, i.e. when you run doctests on an install that is not owned by the current user
* it leaves crap in the default tree ;)

Cheers,

Michael

Mmmh, with the proto patch from #3267 the "sage/server/docs-X.html" files are no longer created.
