Look at the differences between

```
sage: arrow((0,0), (100, 100))
```

and

```
sage: arrow((0,0), (1/1000, 1/1000))
```

This depends on #3806.

Component: **graphics**

You are overriding passed width and other parameters. According to the docs,

```
sage: arrow((1, 1), (3, 3), width=0.05)
```

I didn't notice this before.

Take it back, this is different from #3880. I also wonder why arrows are skewed so badly: after #3880, take a look at

```
sage: arrow((-.1,-.1), (0,0))
```
The skewing isn't as bad here as I've seen it elsewhere, but I wonder why it is doing this...
