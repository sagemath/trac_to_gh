Look at the differences between

```
sage: arrow((0,0), (100, 100))
```

and

```
sage: arrow((0,0), (1/1000, 1/1000))
```

This depends on #3806.

You are overriding passed width and other parameters. According to the docs,

```
sage: arrow((1, 1), (3, 3), width=0.05)
```

I didn't notice this before.

Reading the matplotlib-0.98.3 source, there are two arrows in patches.py:

1. FancyArrow, which is drawn in plot coordinates

2. YAArrow (Yet Another Arrow), which is drawn in display coordinates.

It sounds like we want the YAArrow class, which would provide the same "look", no matter the zoom level.

Take it back, this is different from #3880. I also wonder why arrows are skewed so badly: after #3880, take a look at

```
sage: arrow((-.1,-.1), (0,0))
```
The skewing isn't as bad here as I've seen it elsewhere, but I wonder why it is doing this...
