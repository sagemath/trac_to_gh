Hi rlm,

I didn't look at the patch too closely, but I noticed that you added a lot of code with sparse documentation and also some [internal] function that are not doctested. Is there more coming?

Cheers,

The only new external function is `self_orthogonal_binary_codes`, which does have doctests. Most of the internal functions are cdef, and they are only there for the self orthogonal code generator.

Perhaps you'd like more doctests for `self_orthogonal_binary_codes`?

This passes sage -testall.

Some questions.

1. Does the command 
  	517	    def matrix(self): 
return a generator matrix or the so-called syndrome table or ...? 
Does the name matrix seem too ambiguous to you?

2. Should the docstring for self_orthogonal_binary_codes
explain that you are actually computing a complete set of representatives
of equivalence clasees of such codes up to a given length and dim? 

3. When you run self_orthogonal_binary_codes, are you actually
computing all the (equiv classes of) [n,k]-codes, then adding up those
to get the codes up to a given length and dim? Or, are you somehow
getting all of them at once? In either case, it would obviously be
useful to have a function which only returns those of a given 
length. It would be easy enough to simply simply filter out the 
"bad" ones from the output of self_orthogonal_binary_codes. However, 
I wonder if there was a slicker way to do this using Cython?

4. I'm not competent enough to review the cython code. Mike Hansen,
can you do this?

Regarding 3, the codes are built up recursively, so the program is naturally computing up to some n and k, but I guess I could put in an option for the filtering so you didn't have to do it each time.

1. This seems to be a bug:

sage: for C in B: print C.gen_mat()
....:
[1 1 1 1]
[1 1 1 1 0 0]
[0 1 0 1 1 1]
[1 0 1 1 0 1 0]
[0 1 0 1 1 1 0]
[0 0 1 0 1 1 1]
[1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0]
[0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0]
[0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0]
[0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1]
[1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0]
[0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0]
[0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1]
[1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0]
[0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1]
[1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1]
sage: for C in B: print C.gen_mat()
....:
sage:                          
```
It appears B cannot be re-used!??

2. Can the docstring for this command explain what kind of object the output is?
A natural thing for a user to try is to pick off the first element:

```
sage: B = self_orthogonal_binary_codes(8,4,4)
sage: B[0]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
<type 'exceptions.TypeError'>             Traceback (most recent call last)

/mnt/drive_hda1/sagefiles/sage-3.0.1/<ipython console> in <module>()

<type 'exceptions.TypeError'>: 'generator' object is unsubscriptable
```
But as you see, a type error is raised.

3. Check this out:

```
sage: C = QuasiQuadraticResidueCode(11)
sage: G = C.automorphism_group_binary_code()
sage: G.order()/MathieuGroup(22).order()
2
```
This is very interesting!

The 2 patches apply cleanly to 3.0.1 and pass sage -testall.

1. This segfault is a problem:

sage: len(list(self_orthogonal_binary_codes(8, 4, d=1, equal=True)))


---
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occured in SAGE.
This probably occured because a *compiled* component
of SAGE has a bug in it (typically accessing invalid memory)
or is not properly wrapped with _sig_on, _sig_off.
You might want to run SAGE under gdb with 'sage -gdb' to debug this.
SAGE will now terminate (sorry).

---

This is a rather nasty segfault which does not return the command line
in the terminal window....

Once this is fixed, it would be useful for doctesting (and user's understanding) 
to include something like this in the docstring.

2. Minor issue: instead of 

```
    Generates all (permutation equivalence classes of) self-orthogonal binary
    linear codes of length in [1..n] and dimension in [1..k].
    
    NOTE:
    Technically, what is returned is a set of representatives of these classes.
```
I would say something like

```
    Returns a Python iterator which generates a complete set of representatives of 
    all permutation equivalence classes of self-orthogonal binary linear codes of 
    length in [1..n] and dimension in [1..k].
```

3. Other than these, looks good to me.
