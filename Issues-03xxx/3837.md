Thew new code uses symbolic sqrt, ceil and floor. Hence doctest timing of sha.py go from 22 to 45 seconds and the long version goes from 4 minutes to 10.5. Most of the time is spend in Maxima.

I did not change sha.py.  I did delete some imports from ell_point.py which were not used in that file.  If the author of sha.py wants or needs some functions, they should import them!

So we end up (indirectly) calling Maxima in sha.py.

William and I discussed the problem and it seems that the new code requires higher precision as the double values provided by the Python math library. The goal is not to blame you three, but to sort out how we can avoid calling Maxima without breaking the new code. :)

Sorry about that, it is now fixed.

In one place I used sqrt(xxx) instead of xxx.sqrt(), in a place where sqrt was math.sqrt but xxx was some very large RealField element.  I have now vowed to never *ever* use floating point functions except via xxx.foo() since with foo(x) you never know what will happen -- someone else might add an import statement which meas that you will pick up the wrong foo().  Which is what caused this ticket in the first place.

Extra patch fixes this (I tested this doctest).
