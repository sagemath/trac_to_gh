I applied the patch and ran the chmod command as suggested above.

Note: I applied #3686, #3687, #3688 and #3689 at the same time as my machine is a bit slow (8800 s to run all tests). I changed the packages, did a full build from source and ran 'make testlong'. Everything built and all tests passed. This is with Sage-4.1.
