I've attached a totally new patch that is 1-line, works, and does the right thing, and is imho quite nice.  

I still don't have my computer setup for Selenium, but a test this works is to do this in the notebook:

```
DATA in sys.path
///
True
```

This works for me -- After I upload a data file `foo.py` (or create a new one), I can `import foo` in a worksheet cell.

Positive review.  V2 just adds the changes to `tutorial.py` from the original patch.

A `load` / `attach` analogue of `sys.path` might be warmly-received: #378, #1484, #5169.

By the way, FF 3.6 will permit drag-and-drop file uploads.  See [this blog post](http://hacks.mozilla.org/2009/12/file-drag-and-drop-in-firefox-3-6/) for a video and simple demo.
