For some reason twisted trial is not too happy with using os.popen. Switching to commands.getouput to fetch system information on the mac seems to work better.

Attachment: **[hostinfo.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket3633/hostinfo.patch.gz)**

Robert: commands.getoutput gets the output of a command. This is a little bit better than doing os.popen (what I was doing before) since it actually correctly opens/closes the pipes. 

```
Definition:	commands.getstatusoutput(cmd)
Source:
def getstatusoutput(cmd):
    """Return (status, output) of executing cmd in a shell."""
    import os
    pipe = os.popen('{ ' + cmd + '; } 2>&1', 'r')
    text = pipe.read()
    sts = pipe.close()
    if sts is None: sts = 0
    if text[-1:] == '\n': text = text[:-1]
    return sts, text
```
