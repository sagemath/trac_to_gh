```

The defects in the code for the hermite function in
sage/functions/orthogonal_polys.py which were noted and corrected in 
#2336 apply equally to the other functions in that file.

The attached patch applies the same fix that worked for hermite to the 
following functions:

chebyshev_T,
chebyshev_U,
gen_laguerre,
gen_legendre_P,
gen_legendre_Q,
jacobi_P,
laguerre,
legendre_P,
legendre_Q,
ultraspherical

This allows these polynomials to take much more general 
arguments; see the examples given for legendre_P.

The functions:

gen_legendre_P,
gen_legendre_Q,
legendre_Q

no longer yield a string representing a Maxima expression when the 
argument is a variable.   

For m > n the function gen_legendre_Q(n, m, x)
has to be computed independently of Maxima.  This part of the code may 
need improving.

The introductory documentation has not been changed.



Component: **calculus**

Keywords: **orthogonal polynomials Maxima**
