This should be fixed over all kinds of rings -- it's supposed to be `0` everywhere. It's currently either broken (e.g. over `CyclotomicField`s) or wrong (e.g. it's `1` over `QQ`) in lots of places.

I'll do this soon if no one beats me to it.

Alright, I'm convinced. The best argument for me was that if $V = W \oplus W'$, and you have an operator on $V$, you want to be able to say things like "the charpoly on the sum is the product of the charpolys."

I still need to fix it for cyclotomic fields.
