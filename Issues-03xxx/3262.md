This might be considered a hack: output is only truncated if "@interact" is not in a cell's input, which prevents mangling of long html/javascript output.

REFEREE REPORT:

1. good idea

2. This line

```
if self.__in.find('@interact') == -1: 
```
would read better as

```
if '@interact' not in self.__in
```

3. There should be a big comment right before or next to the loop that
we are being *VERY HACKISH* doing this, since e.g. it will cause us to
think that

```
 print "@interact"
```
is an interact cell, even though it isn't, and this could must be rewritten
to more intelligently determine whether a cell is an interact cell. 
ACTUALLY, *much* better would be for you to just replace that if by
a cell to `self.is_interactive_cell()`, which I wrote, and which
does things right(er).

1. The patch sage-3262-final.patch  I attached has nothing to do with this tick and simply introduces a bug that totally breaks using interact in sage.

2. The patches by mhampton on this ticket never got applied in sage.

so I'm re-opening this.
