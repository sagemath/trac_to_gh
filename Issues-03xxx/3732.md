With the latest Maxima upgrade and Pynac conversion, the last two integrals are correct - the penultimate one is, of course, 

```
1/2*sqrt(pi)
```
and the last one is 

```
1/2*(a+b)^(3/2)*s^3*gamma_incomplete(-3/2,(a+b)/s^2)/(s^2)^(3/2)

<div id="comment:5" align="right">comment:5</div>

Here is the current state of this ticket.  Of the examples in the first attached file, the following are legitimate bugs of this type.

The first example has unnecessary questions.

```
sage: integrate(1/sqrt(x-q), x, 1, 2)
2 sqrt(2 - q) - 2 sqrt(1 - q) # should be this always
```

The third example is definitely a case for this, as of Maxima 5.19.1:

```
(%i19) integrate(log(q-x), x, a, b);
Is  b - a  positive, negative, or zero?

positive;
(%o19)          (b - q) log(q - b) - (a - q) log(q - a) - b + a
(%i20) integrate(log(q-x), x, a, b);
Is  b - a  positive, negative, or zero?

negative;
(%o20)          (b - q) log(q - b) - (a - q) log(q - a) - b + a
(%i21) integrate(log(q-x), x, a, b);
Is  b - a  positive, negative, or zero?

zero;
(%o21)          (b - q) log(q - b) - (a - q) log(q - a) - b + a
```

The fifth example has MANY questions to ask, always the same answer:

```
(%i36) integrate(1/sqrt(q^2-x^2),x, a, b);
Is  b - a  positive, negative, or zero?

negative;
Is  q - a  positive, negative, or zero?

zero;
Is  q + a  positive, negative, or zero?

zero;
Is  q + b  positive, negative, or zero?

positive;
                                 b              a
(%o36)                    asin(------) - asin(------)
                               abs(q)         abs(q)

```

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The following should not be considered bugs, at least not for the reason given.

The second example is okay:

```
sage: integrate(1/(x-q),x,1,2)
```
Maxima adds pi*I and/or switches q-2 to 2-q as appropriate.  If we don't like those differences, that should be on a different ticket.

The fourth example is:

```
sage: integrate(1/(q-x^2), x)
```
The answers given are a constant away from each other, but look very different.  This probably should be considered a bug (Maxima can't connect between logs and arctan/h stuff), but is likely to not be resolved soon, or by questions. 

The last example is definitely not a bug, as for q=-1 you should get a different answer!

<div id="comment:11" align="right">comment:11</div>

Here is a particularly easy one (that sympy and giac can do, of course):

```
sage: var("a");
sage: integrate(cos(x), x, 0, a)
    <snip>
ValueError: ...
Is a positive, negative or zero?

sage: integrate(cos(x), x, 0, a, algorithm="sympy")
sin(a)

sage: integrate(cos(x), x, 0, a, algorithm="giac")
sin(a)
```
