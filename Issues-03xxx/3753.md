Hi,

I also noticed there is a problem with "nb.save()". It assumes that
the current directory is ".sage". So it saves the notebook object in a
wrong place if you are not in ".sage". I think this is a bug.

I can't seem to confirm that this is the case. I added the method filename to the Notebook class and here's what I get:

```
nb = load('test/nb.sobj')
sage: nb.filename()
'test/nb.sobj'
```

Looking at the source code for Notebook.save() it appears to me that save() relies on self.__filename.

This does not seem to be a problem anymore, especially noting the change to the Datastore backend. Can someone check this and close it if it is so?
