At some point we added "-static-libgcc" to lcalc's CFLAGS. I am not so sure why we did it since the reasoning behind it is undocumented and I cannot imagine any reason why we should use it. This is causing trouble on some build platoforms, see

https://groups.google.com/group/sage-support/browse_thread/thread/a0e26173803f11d4/92f2602b2c448b59#92f2602b2c448b59

The spkg at

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mabshoff/lcalc-20080205.p2.spkg

removes that option.

Cheers,

Michael
