The current clisp.spkg is broken on SLES 10/Itanium, i.e. does not compile. I could not find a ticket for this, so I am opening a new one.

<a id='comment:2'>Comment 2:</a>
An updated clisp 2.46 spkg can be found at

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mabshoff/release-cycles-3.0.4/alpha2/clisp-2.46.spkg

It is likely broken on Cygwin (but I will fix that) and builds and doctests fine on 

* 32 bit OSX 10.5
* x86-64 Linux
* Itanium SLES 10 and RHEL 5 Linux

Cheers,

Michael

Builds OK on OS X 10.4, ppc, but something is wrong.  After rebuilding Maxima, all calculus doc tests with trig functions fail.  Running in maxima mode, trig functions seem OK, but in Sage when evaluated on symbolic variables a TypeError is raised: float required.
