The current clisp.spkg is broken on SLES 10/Itanium, i.e. does not compile. I could not find a ticket for this, so I am opening a new one.

An updated clisp 2.46 spkg can be found at

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mabshoff/release-cycles-3.0.4/alpha2/clisp-2.46.spkg

It is likely broken on Cygwin (but I will fix that) and builds and doctests fine on 

* 32 bit OSX 10.5
* x86-64 Linux
* Itanium SLES 10 and RHEL 5 Linux

Cheers,

Michael
