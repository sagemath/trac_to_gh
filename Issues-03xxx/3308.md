One of the two patches to sbuild that we're using was accepted in Debian upstream sbuild, so we no longer need a big piece of SbuildHack.pm.  The other has not yet been accepted, so we don't get to get rid of SbuildHack.pm entirely yet.

I've attached a patch to sage-sbuildhack and SbuildHack.pm to work with current sbuild.
