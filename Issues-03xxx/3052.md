Robert Bradshaw has mostly solved this:

```
I've looked into this some more and it looks like we can completely
reconstruct a repository from the export of all its keywords. The
trick is to use the --exact keyword when importing. This forces it to
apply the given patch to the correct parent (sometimes creating a new
head) and will also correctly import merge patches (removing heads).
Some scripts to do this are up at

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/robertwb/hg/

I've successfully exported and re-created simple repositories (with
branching) with these scripts, and it works great and preserves all
the history. The only issue is that I can't seem to get it to work
with any repositories older than a certain date. I think the issue is
that mercurial changed the way nodeid's are calculated (and I keep
getting an error "abort: patch is damaged or loses information" which
is thrown when the newly computed nodeid does not match the one in
the patch (command.py:1632 in 0.9.5)). Matt Mackall, any suggestions
on how to cleanly get around this/get the old node-id numbers instead?
