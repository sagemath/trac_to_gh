This was reported by Adrian:

I tried the following, and it did not work

```
x,y=var('x y')
def myarctan(x,y):
    if x>=0 and y>=0:
        return arctan(abs(y/x))
    if x<0 and y>=0:
        return pi-arctan(abs(y/x))
    if x<0 and y<0:
        return pi+arctan(abs(y/x))
    if x>=0 and y<0:
        return 2*pi-arctan(abs(y/x))
plot3d(myarctan(x,y),(x,-3,3),(y,-3,3))
```

However, the following does work:

```
plot3d(myarctan,(-3,3),(-3,3))
```

I guess both should work, so I guess this is a bug.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Reply by wdj:

Didn't work for me. I got a segfault:


```
sage: plot3d(myarctan(x,y),(-3,3),(-3,3))


------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occured in SAGE.
This probably occured because a *compiled* component
of SAGE has a bug in it (typically accessing invalid memory)
or is not properly wrapped with _sig_on, _sig_off.
You might want to run SAGE under gdb with 'sage -gdb' to debug this.
SAGE will now terminate (sorry).
------------------------------------------------------------
```

This is not a division by zero problem either:

```
sage: plot3d(myarctan(x,y),(0.1,0.3),(0.1,0.3))


------------------------------------------------------------

Strange. If you use

```
x,y=var('x, y')
def myarctan(u,v):
  if u>=0.0 and v>=0.0:
      return RR(arctan(abs(v/u)))
  if u<0.0 and v>=0.0:
      return RR(pi-arctan(abs(v/u)))
  if u<0.0 and v<0.0:
      return RR(pi+arctan(abs(v/u)))
  if u>=0.0 and v<0.0:
      return RR(2*pi-arctan(abs(v/u)))
  #return 0.0
```
you get a segfault (I'm using the command line, amd64 hardy heron machine).
However, if you uncomment the last line you don't get a segfault but
the 0 function is plotted.

I'm marking it as a blocker since it is a segfault. Hope that is not the wrong thing to do.

Here's a simpler test case:

```
sage: from sage.ext.fast_eval import fast_float_arg, fast_float
sage: fast_float_arg(0)+None
```

This is because of one of these bugs in fast_float:
"When you declare a parameter or C variable as being of an extension
type, Pyrex will allow it to take on the value None as well as values
of its declared type. This is analogous to the way a C pointer can
take on the value NULL, and you need to exercise the same caution
because of it."
(The above is from the Pyrex manual.)

        V = M.cuspidal_submodule().new_submodule()
      File "/home/wdj/sagefiles/sage-3.1.alpha1/local/lib/python2.5/site-packages/sage/modular/modsym/ambient.py", line 896, in cuspidal_submodule
        assert d == S.dimension(), "According to dimension formulas the cuspidal subspace of \"%s\" has dimension %s; however, computing it using modular symbols we obtained %s, so there is a bug (please report!)."%(self, d, S.dimension())
    AssertionError: According to dimension formulas the cuspidal subspace of "Modular Symbols space of dimension 6 and level 12, weight 4, character [-1, -1], sign 1, over Rational Field" has dimension 4; however, computing it using modular symbols we obtained 2, so there is a bug (please report!).
```

This is hard to reproduce. Out of 10 tries, I only caught this failure 2 times.

In any case, I think Robert Bradshaw may be working on another patch for this, so maybe this report isn't needed. I just wanted to report that the segfault definitely is fixed with this patch on my machine (amd64, hardy heron).
