Yep, I think it should be cached_function (in fact, I import it as cached_function in my code).  CachedFunction should be deprecated.

I thought so, too, but cached_function is just an alias for CachedFunction in the code. To close this ticket the code should be moved to cached_function and CachedFunction should be officially deprecated.
