A new version of M4RI is available at:

   http://m4ri.sagemath.org

The matching SPKG is at:

  http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/malb/spkgs/

This SPKG needs a patch which is attached to this ticket.

The new version has quite a new features:
* Strassen-Winograd matrix multiplication (though not used by default yet),
* Native support for Solaris and Windows,
* SSE2 support,
* Much improved documentation,
* Nicer calling conventions.

The SSE2 support could cause trouble but I've successfully built the library on 32 and 64-bit Linux, OSX (Intel and PPC), OpenSolaris 2008.05 and Windows XP.

**Assignee:** @malb

**Keywords:** linear algebra, gf(2), m4ri

**Resolution:** fixed

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/3204

It is not too overwhelming:
* It only improves things up t L2 cache size for my code since then the cache miss is more expensive, however a more clever programmer might be able to prefetch around this problem.
* On AMD CPUs it seems slower (see my mail to [sage-devel])

tried your new code up at #3204 under OS X and get this:
