Add support for MPolynomialRing to inject_on() command.   This is likely very easy.

That is the predefined symbolic x that is defined at startup
before you do anything.   Unless you explicitly assign the
gens of QX to variables (or set auto injection on), 
they won't be bound to variables. 

sage: type(x)
<class 'sage.calculus.calculus.SymbolicVariable'>
sage: QX=MPolynomialRing(QQ,2,'xy')
sage: type(x)
<class 'sage.calculus.calculus.SymbolicVariable'>
sage: QX.gens()
(x, y)
sage: type(QX.gens()[0])
<type 'sage.rings.polynomial.multi_polynomial_libsingular.MPolynomial_libsingular'>

You might like the inject_on() mode:

sage: inject_on()
Redefining: Frac FreeMonoid GF FractionField FiniteField PolynomialRing quotient NumberField LaurentSeriesRing quo 
sage: QX=PolynomialRing(QQ,2,'xy')
Defining x, y
sage: type(x)
<type 'sage.rings.polynomial.multi_polynomial_libsingular.MPolynomial_libsingular'>
sage: type(y)
<type 'sage.rings.polynomial.multi_polynomial_libsingular.MPolynomial_libsingular'>


WARNING: inject_on only works with the PolynomialRing command, not the
MPolynomialRing command.   Either the latter should be supported, or 
the command should be removed entirely.

I thought `MPolynomialRing` was set to be deprecated, see #2353.
