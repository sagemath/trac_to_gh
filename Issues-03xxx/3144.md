There is an issue with the design, though it is arguable what it is.
Notice that var('x') acts as the identity function irregardless of the input,
where as var('x')^2 coerces its input to the SymbolicRing. 

sage: x = var('x')
sage: x('hello world')
'hello world'
sage: type(x('hello world'))
<type 'str'>
sage: (x^2)('hello world')
hello^2*world^2
sage: type((x^2)('hello world'))
<class 'sage.calculus.calculus.SymbolicArithmetic'>
sage: x,y=var("x,y")

I thus think the right fix would be for var('x') to also coerce its input
to the symbolic ring.  So, in the original question var('x,y') would
give an error since:

 sage: SR('x,y')
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: Malformed expression: x, !!! y

By the way, what's up with the !!! in the error message?  That looks very weird. 

What do you think.
