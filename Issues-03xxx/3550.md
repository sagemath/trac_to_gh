This is an alternative to #3456.  It takes the view that the notebook is more like a web page -- lots of pages as text files -- than a database.    

This is a simple solution that is completely implemented in this patch.

BEFORE: 
  TIME: Several *minutes* to store.
  SPACE: 310MB.

AFTER THIS PATCH, which automigrates the sage notebook:
  TIME: 6.7 seconds to save (on sage.math)
  SPACE: 8.8MB.
```

So basically everything is about 30 times faster / smaller. 

The main problem is that I might have introduced bugs, and of course 7 seconds
is a lot longer than nothing.  But this seems like a worthwhile payback for
3 hours of work.

NOTE: There are no doctests yet, since those are very strange to write for the notebook.
