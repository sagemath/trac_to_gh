This is an alternative to #3456.  It takes the view that the notebook is more like a web page -- lots of pages as text files -- than a database.    

This is a simple solution that is completely implemented in this patch.

BEFORE: 
  TIME: Several *minutes* to store.
  SPACE: 310MB.

AFTER THIS PATCH, which automigrates the sage notebook:
  TIME: 6.7 seconds to save (on sage.math)
  SPACE: 8.8MB.
```

So basically everything is about 30 times faster / smaller. 

The main problem is that I might have introduced bugs, and of course 7 seconds
is a lot longer than nothing.  But this seems like a worthwhile payback for
3 hours of work.

NOTE: There are no doctests yet, since those are very strange to write for the notebook.

This code has gone live on sagenb.org, so it seems to work. William has also merged a bundle into my Sage 3.0.4.alpha2 tree since there was a conflict with one of Timothy's patches.

Cheers,
