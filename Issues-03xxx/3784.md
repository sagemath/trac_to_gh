That sounds reasonable to me.

Well, people will use it to have Sage pick up the extensions of the
system Python, but then I get to tell you "I told you so" :)
```

Add something to sage-env that does what is described above.
Also add something to the README.txt that documents this behavior.

This would be very nice for SageTeX, so that the user could put sagetex.py somewhere and use $SAGE_PYTHONPATH to help Sage automatically find the module.
