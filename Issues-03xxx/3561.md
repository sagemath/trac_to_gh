The attached patch gets rid of a bunch of numpy imports.  However, according to 

```
  sage -timeup
```
(see #3559) there is still some mysterious numpy import that gets triggered in real_double_vector.pyx.  I'm very confused by that since there is no python "import numpy" anywhere there.  Fixing that can be another ticket for later.
