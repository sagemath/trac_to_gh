}
```
The attached patch adds to version an option which returns the version and the branch clone name.
New behavior:
sage: version()
returns exactly the same thing it did before no change.
sage: version(True) # or replace "True" by anything except "0" or "False"
returns 
(Version, Branch name)
For example,

```
sage: version(1)

('SAGE Version 3.0, Release Date: 2008-04-22',
 'Mercurial clone branch: version')
```
in a Mercurial clone branch created using "sage -clone version".
