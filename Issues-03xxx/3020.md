Construction of GF(2<sup>n</sup>) is very slow for n>=16 (out of the givaro range), owing to slow search for suitable defining irreducible polynomials over GF(2).  Also the polynomials produced are dense.

A new function GF2X_sparse_irreducible() has been added, using a precomputed lookup table for degrees up to 2048 (taken from NTL's source code) and otherwise looking for tri- and pentanomials first.

Patch attached, based on 3.0.

Ok, I can do that.  If I then put

```
   import gf2x_irred_table
```
at the appropriate point in finite_field.py, it would only read it in if the function is called, right?

>  * This is table from NTL? Can't we just read in the NTL table automatically?


This was intended to be a quick fix.  A better fix (as I originally posted) is to change the NTL wrapping code to use NTL's own function, when creating the field.  At the same time we could just wrap NTL's BuildSparseIrred() function.

>  * Did you check if each entry is irreducible? I assume so, I just want to make it formally sure.


I checked for k<1000 and was intending to do the rest (as you say, to be formally sure), but it takes quite a long time.

Trivial fix to previous, correcting a very stupid Python indentation howler -- which meant that for all n for which the tabulated irreducib;e was a trinomial, it did not return the table poly but searched for one.

    #  l.203-4: I wondered why you call BuildSparseIrred first.  But  I see that NTL's BuildRandomIrred takes a monic irreducible as input and returns another of the same degree, which is rather bizarre, so I guess you had no choice.  

I checked the logic of the new code and am happy with it.
The patch applies cleanly to 3.0.1, and all doctests in sage/rings pass.

Verdict: positive review! apart from the typo this patch (just the last one from malb) is good to go.

My guess is that he covers NTL, but we can always open another ticket and address the issue there.
