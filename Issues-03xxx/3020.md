Construction of GF(2<sup>n</sup>) is very slow for n>=16 (out of the givaro range), owing to slow search for suitable defining irreducible polynomials over GF(2).  Also the polynomials produced are dense.

A new function GF2X_sparse_irreducible() has been added, using a precomputed lookup table for degrees up to 2048 (taken from NTL's source code) and otherwise looking for tri- and pentanomials first.

Patch attached, based on 3.0.

Ok, I can do that.  If I then put

```
   import gf2x_irred_table
```
at the appropriate point in finite_field.py, it would only read it in if the function is called, right?

> * This is table from NTL? Can't we just read in the NTL table automatically?

This was intended to be a quick fix.  A better fix (as I originally posted) is to change the NTL wrapping code to use NTL's own function, when creating the field.  At the same time we could just wrap NTL's BuildSparseIrred() function.

> * Did you check if each entry is irreducible? I assume so, I just want to make it formally sure.

I checked for k<1000 and was intending to do the rest (as you say, to be formally sure), but it takes quite a long time.

No problem, I am delighted that someone has done this properly, and only wish that it had been me to do that.  I am off to look at what you have done and test it now...

Comments: 
    \#  typo in line 147 (spare -> sparse)

    \#  l.203-4: I wondered why you call BuildSparseIrred first.  But  I see that NTL's BuildRandomIrred takes a monic irreducible as input and returns another of the same degree, which is rather bizarre, so I guess you had no choice.  

I checked the logic of the new code and am happy with it.
The patch applies cleanly to 3.0.1, and all doctests in sage/rings pass.

Verdict: positive review! apart from the typo this patch (just the last one from malb) is good to go.

Hi,

it is my understand now to only apply GF2X_sparse_poly.patch. What is the status of the concern regarding the random state? Was that just a general observation since Carl only covered so many randomness sources by his framework?

Cheers,

Michael
