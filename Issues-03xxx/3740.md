I have change the summary of this ticket since the original error is no longer something that happens with the current pickle jar. But as Dan Bump pointed out below:

```
sage: C = CrystalOfLetters(['A',3])
sage: v = C.list()[0]
sage: T = TensorProductOfCrystals(C, C, generators=[[v,v]])
sage: T == loads(dumps(T))
```
raises an exception.

Cheers,

Michael

Presumably the same bug:

sage: v = C.list()[0]
sage: T = TensorProductOfCrystals(C, C, generators=[[v,v]])
sage: T == loads(dumps(T))
