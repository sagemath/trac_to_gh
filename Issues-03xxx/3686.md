Attachment: **[extcode_shebang.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket3686/extcode_shebang.patch.gz)**

The Debian people made me fix all these problems myself, so I've attached patches to fix the #! lines to each of these tickets.  You'll have to remove the executable bits yourself, since I seem to recall mercurial doesn't support that.

By the way, the empty directories in the extcode spkg are for the Sage pexpect wrapper, and can't be deleted.  The others can.
