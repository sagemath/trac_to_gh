When I have just logged in to sage, the URL one is connected to is
"https://<sage server>/login" and the relevant page apparently has post-data on it.

If I click one of the "archive", "delete" or "stop" buttons, apparently a reload of the page is triggered. The result is that firefox gives me a warning "The page you are trying to reload contains POSTDATA ...".

If I change the URL to "https://<sage server>" in the same browser I remain authenticated and everything still works. Now the page does not have POSTDATA on it and the reload is not a problem.

Possible fixes:

- Make sure that the POSTDATA is dumped as quickly as possible, so that reloading does not trigger warnings
- reprogram the actions of the buttons so that they don't trigger a reload (for instance, force them to do a load of a new page instead)
- something I cannot think of.
