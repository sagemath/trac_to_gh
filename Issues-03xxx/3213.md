REVIEW:

  I think the code looks fine and this should be applied.

I think the settings panel itself has a lot of work until it is the ultimate
settings panel, etc.  But this is a very good start, and additional work
should simply go in another patch.  Some comments for future work:

* Instead of "Cancel" being the only way to leave the settings page, how about a "Save" button that saves all changes, and a "cancel" button that throws away all changes?
* Currently changes are still saved even if you click cancel.
* Make the thing a little more stylish. 

Please do these as a separate ticket from this ticket, since I want #3213 to get
in as is. 

This patch I think depends on Tim's other patch for "changing the password".
