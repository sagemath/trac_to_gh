Was:

```
sage: C = ExtendedBinaryGolayCode()
sage: time G = C.permutation_automorphism_group()
CPU times: user 2.39 s, sys: 0.58 s, total: 2.97 s
Wall time: 24.32
```
Now:

```
sage: C = ExtendedBinaryGolayCode()
sage: time G = C.permutation_automorphism_group()
CPU times: user 0.19 s, sys: 0.04 s, total: 0.23 s
Wall time: 0.24
```
