The function can_convert_to_singular in polynomial_singular_interface claims (by returning True) that Singular can support multivariate polynomial rings with no variables. This claim seems to be unintended, since the wrapper for Singular polynomial ideals claims the opposite.

The attached trivial patch makes can_convert_to_singular return False if the passed-in ring has zero generators.
