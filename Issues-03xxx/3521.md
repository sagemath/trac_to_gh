For me this illustrates the bug more clearly:

```

sage: M

True
sage: M = ModularSymbols(DirichletGroup(13).0^2)
sage: M.atkin_lehner_operator(13).matrix()^2 == 1
False
sage: M.atkin_lehner_operator(13).matrix()^2

WARNING:

The atkin-lehner operator does *not* leave the space $M_k(N,\chi)$ invariant unless $\chi$ is quadratic. Really it sends $M_k(N,\chi)$ to $M_k(N,\chibar)$.   So Sage should give an error message when $\chi$ is not quadratic.
