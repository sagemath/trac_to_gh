[20:17] <wstein-3053> numpy is usually better.
[20:18] <jason--> okay; do you mind if we switch the determinant function to numpy for matrices over CDF?
[20:18] <wstein-3053> jason-- please do.

The numpy-RDF-CDF.patch replaces all previous patches.

Basically, I factored out stuff that was common between RDF and CDF matrices (which turned out to be almost everything except the very initial part), stripped out GSL stuff, and wrote a few more doctests.

Oops, I just realized that I didn't delete a few pieces of cruft still hanging around from the GSL implementation.  I'll post a follow-up patch shortly.

The matrix below is from `m=random_matrix(RDF,30,min=-2<sup>32,max=2</sup>32)`.  I then copied the same matrix to the other session, so the timings below are for the exact same matrix.

since caching seems to affect the above numbers: can you turn off GSL caching and redo the numbers? Then open a ticket to add caching for the new numpy classes? As is there are some significant slowdowns.

Hi malb,

I am valgrinding it right now. Jason and I spend four hours last night fixing problems with the new nump 1.2 and scip 0.7svn - see #4205.

>  * Is there any chance that we can get rid of the toplevel numpy imports (they were removed just recently and I wonder whether we can get away without them for startup time reasons)


Unfortunately not, but numpy 1.2 (which we are upgrading to in 3.1.3) imports in 0.2s or so on sage.math. 

>  * doctests (64-bit Linux)


Fixed in #4205. 

Cheers,

Michael

I added numpy-3.patch (to be applied on top of the previous patches) which makes numpy *not* imported by default (imported lazily, though), and switches several functions from the numpy versions to the more careful/recommended scipy equivalents.

Earlier today, I ran valgrind on several examples and mabshoff indicated that things looked good to him.  He might do additional testing to see if things really are okay to merge.

Martin and Mike,

I'm emailing you two since you've both already looked at the patches at http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/3498.  Martin, you almost gave it a positive review, pending resolution of the deprecation warnings.  I think mabshoff fixed the deprecation warnings without applying #4205.  Mike, you expressed some concerns over leaks.  I took care of the global numpy import issue and ran some tests with valgrind and, based on those, mabshoff said today on IRC: "Someone other than me needs to (re)review. Blessing from me on memory issues AFAIK :)"


Michael also said he was still a bit suspicious, though, and it seems like he'd like to run valgrind on it himself as well.


So, would either of you like to (re)review the patches at #3498, especially for the mathematical content?  Michael can run valgrind on it again if he wants as well.

Thanks,

Jason

<a id='comment:23'></a>I don't believe there is any gsl_matrix field in the new class.  Where are you seeing it (after applying the patches)?

Also, yes, I have looked at using the new buffer interface.  However, for some reason, I didn't think we had current enough numpy/cython to be able to use it, and even if we did, it seemed like it was still under development.  I was going to wait until there was a clear, complete implementation.  I'm excited about it, though!

I agree it ought to be a separate ticket.
