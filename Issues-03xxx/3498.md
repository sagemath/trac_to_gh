[20:18] <jason--> okay; do you mind if we switch the determinant function to numpy for matrices over CDF?

The numpy-RDF-CDF.patch replaces all previous patches.

Basically, I factored out stuff that was common between RDF and CDF matrices (which turned out to be almost everything except the very initial part), stripped out GSL stuff, and wrote a few more doctests.

Oops, I just realized that I didn't delete a few pieces of cruft still hanging around from the GSL implementation.  I'll post a follow-up patch shortly.

Mabshoff: these patches do not depend on anything but a pristine 3.1.3alpha1

I deleted the solve module because it seemed like it was purely a helper module for RDF/CDF matrices.  That was the only place I could a reference to it in the sage codebase.  The functionality should be present in the RDF/CDF matrix codebase; numpy has a function which does all that that module does in just a line or two.  At least, that's how I understood it when I looked at it.

Some timings.  First, a bunch of commands in 3.1.3alpha1 without the patches, then with the patches.

The matrix below is from `m=random_matrix(RDF,30,min=-2<sup>32,max=2</sup>32)`.  I then copied the same matrix to the other session, so the timings below are for the exact same matrix.

before patches:

```

625 loops, best of 3: 152 µs per loop
sage: timeit('Matrix(CDF, [[1,2],[3,4]])')

sage: m
30 x 30 dense matrix over Real Double Field

625 loops, best of 3: 32.1 µs per loop

625 loops, best of 3: 1.39 ms per loop
sage: timeit('m.QR()')
625 loops, best of 3: 197 µs per loop

after patches:

```

Jason, 

since caching seems to affect the above numbers: can you turn off GSL caching and redo the numbers? Then open a ticket to add caching for the new numpy classes? As is there are some significant slowdowns.

Some more timings from respectably-sized matrices show that numpy is indeed way faster most of the time and neck-and-neck the rest of the time.  The GSL determinant speed below is most likely from from caching the LU decomposition that had been computed for something before and using that to compute the determinant.

Hi malb,

> **Review**
> * patch applies cleanly

I am valgrinding it right now. Jason and I spend four hours last night fixing problems with the new nump 1.2 and scip 0.7svn - see #4205.

> * Is there any chance that we can get rid of the toplevel numpy imports (they were removed just recently and I wonder whether we can get away without them for startup time reasons)

Unfortunately not, but numpy 1.2 (which we are upgrading to in 3.1.3) imports in 0.2s or so on sage.math. 

> * doctests (64-bit Linux)

Fixed in #4205. 

Cheers,

Michael

Ok, this is a problem:

This happens when valgrinding sage/modules/complex_double_vector.pyx. But the issue is not the code that Jason wrote, but that we leak not insignificant amounts of memory if we (re)import numpy. So I would suggest doing it once at the toplevel and killing all other import numpy statements. 

Another thing that concerns me is that the number of still reachable objects has gone up dramatically, i.e. contrast the above to the situation before:

```
==16395== LEAK SUMMARY:

One would need to run some longer tests to see if this is just additional, but constant crap from numpy or if the amount grows as we use it more.

Replying to [@williamstein](#comment:15):
> For the record, it is absolutely definitely always possible to get rid of numpy imports.

I was thinking about inheriting from a numpy type or cdef'ing some numpy type in some pxd file (don't know if that's even possible) Other than that, I can't think of any situation where one couldn't do it.

Attachment: **[numpy-3.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket3498/numpy-3.patch.gz)**

I added numpy-3.patch (to be applied on top of the previous patches) which makes numpy *not* imported by default (imported lazily, though), and switches several functions from the numpy versions to the more careful/recommended scipy equivalents.

Earlier today, I ran valgrind on several examples and mabshoff indicated that things looked good to him.  He might do additional testing to see if things really are okay to merge.

Martin and Mike,

I'm emailing you two since you've both already looked at the patches at https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/3498.  Martin, you almost gave it a positive review, pending resolution of the deprecation warnings.  I think mabshoff fixed the deprecation warnings without applying #4205.  Mike, you expressed some concerns over leaks.  I took care of the global numpy import issue and ran some tests with valgrind and, based on those, mabshoff said today on IRC: "Someone other than me needs to (re)review. Blessing from me on memory issues AFAIK :)"


Michael also said he was still a bit suspicious, though, and it seems like he'd like to run valgrind on it himself as well.


So, would either of you like to (re)review the patches at #3498, especially for the mathematical content?  Michael can run valgrind on it again if he wants as well.

Thanks,

Jason

The patch needs to be rebased - likely due to #799. 3.2.alpha2 should be out shortly, so I would suggest using that.
