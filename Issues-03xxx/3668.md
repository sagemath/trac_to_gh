```
In the documentation for the function "Set" (Reference Manual 11.8) it would be helpful to explicitly point out that Set allows objects of different types, so 

```
sage: Set([Sequence(my_seq),3,QQ])
Rational Field, 3, [2, 3]
```

is perfectly OK.

Also, it would be nice if Set allowed one to use lists, so

`Set([This is the Trac macro *2,3* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#2,3-macro))`

worked, rather than giving the error message ``TypeError: list objects are unhashable''.

What's the point of tests like

```
sage: hash(s) == hash(s) 
True
```

I prefer to keep the actual hash in this case:

```
sage: hash(s)
1234   # 32-bit
56789  # 64-bit
```

Minor comment: `#indirect doctest` isn't needed for `_underscored_` methods.

The main reason is so that the output does not change if the hash value of the underlying object changes, but it still tests that it is hashable. (Plus it means we don't need to find a 32 and 64 bit machine to test.) I remember there being a discussion about this, but I don't remember/can't find which ticket this came up in (I believe there was a sage-devel topic on this, but I can't find it either).

However I can reset the one doctest back and change the other one to reflect the behavior of the `__hash__()` function.

> Minor comment: `#indirect doctest` isn't needed for `_underscored_` methods.

I wrote this before the switch to the new doctesting framework and were needed then if `_underscored_` methods weren't explicity called. I'll remove them on the next version of the patch.
