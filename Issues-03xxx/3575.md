In my merge tree somebody else already beat you to it and deleted the random crap:

```
mabshoff@sage:/scratch/mabshoff/release-cycle/sage-3.0.4.alpha2/devel/sage$ tail -n 10 sage/rings/complex_double.pyx
        True    
    """
    return _CDF   

from sage.misc.parser import Parser
cdef cdf_parser = Parser(float, float,  {"I" : _CDF.gen(), "i" : _CDF.gen()})



#####
```

Cheers,

Michael
