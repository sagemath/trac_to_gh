This patch as is exposes some bugs in the way we build python:

```
g++ -o libcsage.so -shared src/convert.os src/interrupt.os src/mpn_pylong.os

-lgmp -lpari -lpython2.5

/libpython2.5.a(exceptions.o): relocation R_X86_64_32 against `_Py_NoneStruct' can not 
be used when making a shared object; recompile with -fPIC

```
The likely solution is to force "-fPIC" on the python build, but I need to dig around.
