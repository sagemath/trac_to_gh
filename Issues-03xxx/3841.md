This patch makes symbolic polynomials use libsingular via the ring interface by default.
It also contains a large number of doctest changes because polynomials in Sage have a better ordering.

```
%cython
from sage.calculus.calculus import var
from sage.rings.integer cimport Integer
from random import random
def blah(rng):
    global five
    x,y = var('x,y')
    foo = x
    cdef i
    for i from 0<=i<rng:
        foo+= x**int(random()*1000)+y**int(random()*10000)+x+1
    return foo

The python code used to test maxima was:
sage: def blah(rng):
   foo = x
   for i in xrange(0, rng):
       foo+=x^int(random()*10000)+y^int(random()*10000)+x+1; foo = simplify(foo)             
   return foo

I'm well aware that I'm comparing cython timings to python timings.. but the cython overhead isn't the dominating factor here.
The simplify exists to force it to go to maxima to evaluate the expression between additions (as singular does).  Otherwise this is not a very fair/real world comparison if Maxima gets to build the entire addition and send it to Maxima as one batch (and only do the addition once as opposed to rng times).  

%timeit blah(10)

125 loops, best of 3: 1.98 ms per loop

Maxima: 
CPU times: user 0.14 s, sys: 0.05 s, total: 0.18 s
Wall time: 1.97 s

%timeit blah(100)
 
25 loops, best of 3: 20.8 ms per loop

Maxima:
CPU times: user 3.30 s, sys: 1.16 s, total: 4.47 s
Wall time: 28.89 s


%timeit blah(1000)

5 loops, best of 3: 214 ms per loop

Maxima: Raises exception

%timeit blah(10000)

5 loops, best of 3: 2.09 s per loop

This isn't a bug or a new feature: it is a convention. Based on William's comments in the lab today, I don't think there will be a huge amount of support for printing polynomials the way they are here. The point is that it is just a convention, and in changing such, you are not doing things the way people expect them to be done. If you make a change in conventions, there had better be a very good reason for it, and the Sage community must support it. Probably "Symbolic Polynomials alway use the same representation as the underlying object" should change if this is going to fly (also, this is hardly a justification of anything...).

Applied to sage-3.1.alpha2, the following test fails, aside from the two (now) resolved issues for coercion:

Probably "Symbolic Polynomials alway use the same representation as the underlying object" should change if this is going to fly (also, this is hardly a justification of anything...).  << Symbolic polynomials now use the representation as determined by the coefficient and exponent functions.

The doctest failure is known to be related to bug 3856 (if it is a bug or not depends on how exactly `_polynomial_` should behave (So pending on figuring out how coercion specs this)).

After some discussion with gfurnish, it is clear that there is no point in trying to merge this patch. Although there are some merits to this patch, the current situation with GiNaC would render it obsolete in short time, and thus it is not worth the effort. 

I should also (on record) apologize for my flame on this ticket. I was under time pressure and very impatient and I didn't mean it the way it came across.

For what it's worth, Maxima still sucks. :-)
