The env variable RM is set to `rm` instead of `rm -f`. This breaks newer libtools, for example anything in Fedora 12 or later (libtool 2.2.6, autoconf 2.63, automake 1.11.1). They assume that `$RM` is either unset or `RM="rm -f"`, that is, deleting non-existing files must not cause an error.

One of the symptoms of this breakage is that configure ends with

```
rm: cannot remove `libtoolT': No such file or directory
```
Compile will break later on...

---

There are three approaches presented here:

- change $RM from "rm" to "rm -f": [attachment:trac_3537_scripts.patch]
- keep $RM as it is, but document it: [attachment:trac_3537-doc.patch] (needs_work)
- don't set $RM at all: [attachment:trac_3537-unset-RM.patch]

Apply [attachment:trac_3537-unset-RM.patch]

I am not convinced yet that this is the right thing to do and it is rather likely that this will break something else in the tree. The solution to M2's problem is to unset RM in spkg-install and then to set RM to some value you desire.

And this is definitely not a blocker for 3.0.4.

Well, is this a bug? 

> More and more packages will fail because of this issue as soon as upsteam re-runs autotools...


That's IMHO a problem of autotools. `$RM` is in general not supposed to *not return an error* on non-existing files; if autotools were a bit smarter, they would just add `-f` or whatever might be appropriate. If they redefine the meaning of `RM`, that's not Sage's problem in the first place; of course spkg maintainers would have to `unset RM` for upstream packages using (newer) autotools.


> I'd be happy to give this a positive review. Maybe mabshoff can reconsider his objections?


Michael has quit a while ago, though he perhaps still reads trac notifications... ;-)


Note that redefining `RM` in `sage-env` could actually break other parts of Sage, not necessarily limited to spkgs, since e.g. removing a file which is expected to exist, but doesn't, without raising an error might hide other errors and cause arbitrary behavior.

Also, as Michael said, changing the default value in `sage-env` doesn't help if `RM` was already defined (intentionally or not) by the user, so w.r.t. autotools really *won't fix*. We have to `unset RM` (or add an appropriate flag to force deletion if it's not already contained) in `spkg-install`s of such packages anyway to be safe.


I think we should prominently document this issue, and close this ticket again.

Because

```sh

```
will (hopefully) fail if `RM` is not set or empty?

Imagine `some_file` was executable in that case...




It would be a bit odd to test and eventually set all such variables individually in every script that uses some of these, therefore we have `sage-env`.

Though `CP`, `RM` etc. are meanwhile hardly used within Sage; perhaps because setting them isn't necessary on any proper OS...

Instead, it would be better to have e.g. `EGREP`, (POSIX-conformant) `GREP` etc., detected / set by Sage's `configure`.

I seriously doubt that anybody uses the "destructive existence test" `$RM filename || ...` :-)

Automake has an official list of variables that it looks at. Perhaps it is a bug that `RM` is on the list, but its still our problem and I doubt upstream will change because some guys from Sage have a variable name collision.

I agree 100%. 

I can understand the logic of variables like $CC, $CXX, $MAKE, but not $RM. I don't know of any system where one might want to specify what version of `rm` gets used, so I don't see the point in having a variable for it. If some dump package needs `$RM` defined, then either try to fix the code so it is not so dumb, or add `$RM` to `dump_package.spkg`. 

BTW, take a look at

http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/kirkby/bad-code/sympow-1.018.1.p7/src/Configure

where you will find some *interesting* use of variable names. A script which starts 

```/bin/sh}}}

has a function 

{{{whichexe()}}}

This function makes use of a non-POSIX command {{{which}}}, so there's no reason for {{{which}}} to exist. Then {{{whichexe()}}} function sets variables for things like SH, RM, SED, whilst checking if the commands (including {{{sh}}}) exist. If not the script exits. An abbreviated version is below. 

{{{#!/bin/sh
whichexe() {
    if [ -f /bin/$1 ]; then
        echo /bin/$1
        return;
    fi;
    if [ -f /usr/bin/$1 ]; then
        echo /usr/bin/$1
        return;
    fi;
    if [ -f /usr/local/bin/$1 ]; then
        echo /usr/local/bin/$1
        return;
    fi;
    echo `which $1`
}
RM=`whichexe rm`
GREP=`whichexe grep` && echo "#define GREP \"$GREP\"" >> $CONFIG
SED=`whichexe sed` && echo "#define SED \"$SED\"" >> $CONFIG
SH=`whichexe sh` && echo "#define SH \"$SH\"" >> $CONFIG
if [ -z "$SH" ]; then
  echo "**ERROR**: Could not find sh"; exit 1;
else
  echo "SH = $SH"
fi
}}}

I might have cleaned this up, so the current version in Sage might not be quite so dumb. 

Dave
