The env variable RM is set to `rm` instead of `rm -f`. This breaks newer libtools, for example anything in Fedora 12 or later (libtool 2.2.6, autoconf 2.63, automake 1.11.1). They assume that `$RM` is either unset or `RM="rm -f"`, that is, deleting non-existing files must not cause an error.

One of the symptoms of this breakage is that configure ends with

```
rm: cannot remove `libtoolT': No such file or directory
```
Compile will break later on...

---

There are three approaches presented here:

- change $RM from "rm" to "rm -f": [attachment:trac_3537_scripts.patch]
- keep $RM as it is, but document it: [attachment:trac_3537-doc.patch] (needs_work)
- don't set $RM at all: [attachment:trac_3537-unset-RM.patch]

Apply [attachment:trac_3537-unset-RM.patch]

Well, is this a bug? 

> More and more packages will fail because of this issue as soon as upsteam re-runs autotools...


That's IMHO a problem of autotools. `$RM` is in general not supposed to *not return an error* on non-existing files; if autotools were a bit smarter, they would just add `-f` or whatever might be appropriate. If they redefine the meaning of `RM`, that's not Sage's problem in the first place; of course spkg maintainers would have to `unset RM` for upstream packages using (newer) autotools.


> I'd be happy to give this a positive review. Maybe mabshoff can reconsider his objections?


Michael has quit a while ago, though he perhaps still reads trac notifications... ;-)


Note that redefining `RM` in `sage-env` could actually break other parts of Sage, not necessarily limited to spkgs, since e.g. removing a file which is expected to exist, but doesn't, without raising an error might hide other errors and cause arbitrary behavior.

Also, as Michael said, changing the default value in `sage-env` doesn't help if `RM` was already defined (intentionally or not) by the user, so w.r.t. autotools really *won't fix*. We have to `unset RM` (or add an appropriate flag to force deletion if it's not already contained) in `spkg-install`s of such packages anyway to be safe.


I think we should prominently document this issue, and close this ticket again.

<a id='comment:9'></a>Replying to [comment:8 jdemeyer]:

Because

```sh
${RM} some_file
```
will (hopefully) fail if `RM` is not set or empty?

Imagine `some_file` was executable in that case...




It would be a bit odd to test and eventually set all such variables individually in every script that uses some of these, therefore we have `sage-env`.

Though `CP`, `RM` etc. are meanwhile hardly used within Sage; perhaps because setting them isn't necessary on any proper OS...

Instead, it would be better to have e.g. `EGREP`, (POSIX-conformant) `GREP` etc., detected / set by Sage's `configure`.

E.g. Singular's `spkg-install` does. (It actually does `$RM -f ...`.)

I wouldn't base such changes on guesses... ;-)

I agree 100%. 

I can understand the logic of variables like $CC, $CXX, $MAKE, but not $RM. I don't know of any system where one might want to specify what version of `rm` gets used, so I don't see the point in having a variable for it. If some dump package needs `$RM` defined, then either try to fix the code so it is not so dumb, or add `$RM` to `dump_package.spkg`. 

BTW, take a look at

http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/kirkby/bad-code/sympow-1.018.1.p7/src/Configure

where you will find some *interesting* use of variable names. A script which starts 

`#!/bin/sh`

has a function 

`whichexe()`

This function makes use of a non-POSIX command `which`, so there's no reason for `which` to exist. Then `whichexe()` function sets variables for things like SH, RM, SED, whilst checking if the commands (including `sh`) exist. If not the script exits. An abbreviated version is below. 

```/bin/sh
whichexe() {
    if [ -f /bin/$1 ]; then
        echo /bin/$1
        return;
    fi;
    if [ -f /usr/bin/$1 ]; then
        echo /usr/bin/$1
        return;
    fi;
    if [ -f /usr/local/bin/$1 ]; then
        echo /usr/local/bin/$1
        return;
    fi;
    echo `which $1`
}
RM=`whichexe rm`
GREP=`whichexe grep` && echo "#define GREP \"$GREP\"" >> $CONFIG
SED=`whichexe sed` && echo "#define SED \"$SED\"" >> $CONFIG
SH=`whichexe sh` && echo "#define SH \"$SH\"" >> $CONFIG
if [ -z "$SH" ]; then
  echo "**ERROR**: Could not find sh"; exit 1;
else
  echo "SH = $SH"
fi
```

I might have cleaned this up, so the current version in Sage might not be quite so dumb. 

Dave
