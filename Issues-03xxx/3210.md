This is a very neat feature, useful if you are teaching number theory or topology, say.

I didn't realize that the second patch was a replacement for the 1st patch, so I tried to 
apply them both and of course failed. The 1st patch works as claimed and passes sage -testall.
(Actually, on my old machine, 

```
The following tests failed:


        sage -t  devel/sage/sage/matrix/benchmark.py
        sage -t  devel/sage/sage/server/notebook/worksheet.py
```
but then they passes on retesting.)

My suggestion, and it really a very minor one, is that the "radius"
where the points are plotted should be a parameter the user can reset. 
For example, if you graph a p=3 and a p=7 then they overlap maybe more
that some would like. Not that I see this as important for teaching but might
be a fun option for making cool pictures. Just an idea.

Cool image at http://wiki.sagemath.org/pics. :)

The "radius" can be changed with the pointsize parameter. Also, you could plot it with fewer points (as for p=3 or 7, the "points" you're seeing are probably a cluster of even smaller ones).

I am talking about a dufferent radius I think. To me

```
sage: P1 = Zp(3).plot(pointsize=1,rgbcolor=(0,1,0))
sage: P2 = Zp(7).plot(pointsize=2,rgbcolor=(1,0,0))
```
and

```
sage: P1 = Zp(3).plot(pointsize=1,rgbcolor=(0,1,0))
sage: P2 = Zp(7).plot(pointsize=3,rgbcolor=(1,0,0))
```
Look the same. I was wondering about a scaling parameter 
"distance", say, where 

```
sage: P1 = Zp(3).plot(distance=1,rgbcolor=(0,1,0))
```
would plot the 3 triangles at (say) a circle of radius 1 from (0,0)
as it does now, and 

```
sage: P1 = Zp(3).plot(distance=2,rgbcolor=(0,1,0))
```
would plot the 3 triangles at (say) a circle of radius 2 from (0,0).

Is this possible without introducing a new parameter?

I'm also adding a patch which adds an "r" to the docstring, in the hopes that this will cause less heartache with the reference manual.
