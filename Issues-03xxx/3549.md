PARI has a function "addprimes" which can be used to add to the list of precomputed primes that are used for trial division.  We need to add an interface so Sage can use that function.

Pari can already do this; it's the "addprimes" function.

The `addprimes` function is currently available via automatic import:

```
sage: pari([3, 7]).addprimes()
[3 ,7]
```
If this is sufficient, then I would propose to close this ticket as invalid.

A more proactive alternative would be to add a wrapper function somewhere, maybe `sage.rings.fast_arith` where things like `prime_range` live.
