```
sage: G = Graph("George")
sage: G.set_boundary(set([1,2,3]))
sage: G.get_boundary()
[]
```

... which makes sense, given the code...

```
    def set_boundary(self, boundary):
        ...
        if isinstance(boundary,list):
            self._boundary = boundary

    def set_embedding(self, embedding):
        ...
```
