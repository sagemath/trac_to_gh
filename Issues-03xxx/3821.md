The patch seems to go in the right direction, but gcc 4.3.1 is still unhappy with bern_modp_util.cpp while two other files are fine:

Moving the climits include before the macro

```
#if ULONG_MAX == 4294967295U
#define ULONG_BITS 32
#elif ULONG_MAX == 18446744073709551615U
#define ULONG_BITS 64
#else
#error Oops! Unsigned long is neither 32 nor 64 bits.
#error You need to update bern_modp_util.h.
#endif
```
in devel/sage/sage/rings/bernmm/bern_modp_util.h fixes the issue for me. Now doctesting the install.

Cheers,

Hi David,

Replying to [dmharvey](#comment%3A4):
> Arggh, I'm sorry, I'm an idiot. Of course the #include needs to go before the macro.


:) - I do the same thing on a pretty regular basis. Do you want to update the patch or should I post a follow up patch?
