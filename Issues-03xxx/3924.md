Build Python as a framework build on OS X. 

spkg up at 

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/wstein/patches/prabhu/

This needs thorough testing.  In particular, try building sage from scratch with this spkg.  Also, worry about upgrading from one sage version to another.

Anyway, ASAP I think this should be made the standard version of python for OS X, so that we can get matplotlib + full native gui support by default.  Plus, we should provide an optional spkg that makes it trivial to make nice native GUI apps on OS X (??).

The duplicate symbol error is this:
ld: duplicate symbol _matrix_tp in build/temp.macosx-10.3-i386-2.5/C/dense.o and build/temp.macosx-10.3-i386-2.5/C/base.o

It is the first error, until then, gcc happily chugs along.

Can crash tthrough the cvxopt errors by adding extern declarations in some of the source files.

I think this is a complete list:

in src/C/base.c, 

```
PyTypeObject matrix_tp ;
PyTypeObject spmatrix_tp ;
``` 
both get an extern.

In dense.c, `PyTypeObject spmatrix_tp ;` gets an extern.

In dense.c and sparse.c, `PyObject *base_mod;` gets an extern.

**Attachment:** [trac_python_3924.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket3924/trac_python_3924.patch)

This was the original mess of a ticket description:

I'm trying to build sage on mac with a shareable python library.  The current version, being built without the --enable-framework option, cannot be linked to other libraries because of the environ variable.  I think getting this working would be useful, and I would like eventually to see it the default build on OS X.

The following recipe works, though it is clearly a defective approach:

1. build vanilla sage from source 

2. edit the spkg/standard/python-2.5....spkg/spkg-install file to include the --enable-framework=SAGE_ROOT/local/Frameworks

3. rebuild sage.  This creates SAGE_ROOT/Frameworks/Python.framework

4. all doctests pass, and I can link to libpython from boost python

Ideally, the following steps would work:

1. edit the spkg/standard/python-2.5....spkg/spkg-install file to include the --enable-framework= SAGE_ROOT/local/Frameworks

2. build sage.

It doesn't work so simply.  I've managed to help it along a few steps, but am stuck with cvxopt

1. The build of mercurial crashes.  When it crashes, create two symlinks:

2a. local/lib/python2.5 
---> local/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/Current/lib/python2.5/

1b. local/include/python2.5 
---> local/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/Current/include/python2.5/

1c. Restart make

2. The build of the sage package crashes, with a similar error.  

2a. Delete the busted symlink at 
local/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/Current/lib/python2.5/site-packages/sage

2b. Create a symlink:
local/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/Current/lib/python2.5/site-packages/sage
--->devel/sage/build/sage

2c. Delete half-built files, restart make.

3. The build of cvxopt crashes, with a duplicate symbol error.  I'm not in a position to debug this one.

Any attention appreciated!  For my part, I can muddle along with the duplicate builds but I would like to get this working.
