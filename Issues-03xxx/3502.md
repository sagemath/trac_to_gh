1. Implement applying Hecke operator to a single sparse vector, an operation that is needed for quick computation of systems of Hecke eigenvalues.

2. Make very very fast code for applying many Hecke operators to a single vector with one nonzero entry. 

NOTE: The higher weight patches (starting with patch 10) depend on upgrading flint, since flint had a bug: #3523.

NOTE: A cumulative bundle with all possible dependencies is here:
