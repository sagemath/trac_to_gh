From Harald Schilly:

```
Looks good, yes. Just small remarks what I would change...

1) The border around the sign-in formular is thin. Why not the same as
those two below? I would suggest to make all three borders small...

2) The top header is an image. The serif-italic letters don't look
very well on my screen. (no subpixel hinting compared to directly
rendered italic letters on my lcd) .. I would suggest to not use an
image, just the text string with a fixed font size (16pt?, italic,
serif) and absolute placement.

3) The forgot password page does not exist. I think, it should look
the same, except the login box and the middle content replaced by an
explanation and so on.

4) maybe less screenshots (just a 3x2 matrix) but with larger images?
so that someone could see more!

5) it's not xhtml valid
I strongly suggest to use xhtml transitional, since this is better for
compatibility and browsers like ie6 work better with that. xhtml
strict is just some sort of a more theoretical wish that will never
come true ;)
but anyways, ending a formular input tag with /> is not ok. browsers
don't understand real xml ...

6) maybe more margin-borders on the left and right side of the middle
content, to give everything a bit more "air" so that it looks less
tight...

greetings Harald

Regarding the negative review could you tell me if you want all of Harald's suggestions implemented? 

1) I can do easily by switching in the css which background is called for a:link and a:hover

2) Maybe do this in another ticket if others also complain

3) A very minimalistic "account recovery" page will be in sage-3.0.4. Anything regarding it should be a different ticket

4) I don't want to change them because A) I like it the way it is B) it would be very time consuming for me

5) Done
