For the most part this looks really good!  However, before I can give this a positive review, I have two requests for improvement.

1.  Currently

sage: S = SFASchur(QQ); S([]).inner_plethysm(S([2,1]))

blows up. However, in general, S([]).inner_plethysm(S[p]), for p a partition of n, should return S([n]).

2. The doc string currently contains examples, but no explanation.  I propose the following doc for inner_plethysm:

Inner plethysm is a bilinear product on the ring of symmetric functions.  The result of f.inner_plethysm(g) on the Schur functions f = S(la), g = S(mu) can be interpreted as follows.  Setting n = mu.size(), the function g can be thought of as the character of an irreducible representation, $\rho$, of the symmetric group $S_n$.  Let N be the dimension of this representation.  If the number of parts of la is greater then N, then f.inner_plethysm(g) = 0 by definition.  Otherwise, we can interpret f as the character of an irreducible $GL_N$ representation, call it $\sigma$.  Now $\sigma \circ \rho$ is an $S_n$ representation and, by definition, the character of this representation is f.inner_plethysm(g).

I updated the patch to address your concerns.  Note that inner plethysm isn't bilinear, but only linear in the first argument.

(I also updated 2144 to have this patch.)

Yes, of course you are right, bilinear is not correct, I have updated doc below.  More troubling to me is that I am now getting:

sage: S = SFASchur(QQ); f = S([2,1])
sage: S([]).inner_plethysm(f)
2*s[3]

According to my reference the answer should be s[3].  Am I wrong about this?

New suggested doc:
            Retuns the inner plethysm of self with x.
            
            The result of f.inner_plethysm(g) is linear in f and linear in
            "homogeneous pieces" of g.  So, to describe this function, we assume
            without loss that f is some Schur function S(la) and g is a
            homogeneous symmetric function of degree n. The function g can be
            thought of as the character of an irreducible representation, rho,
            of the symmetric group S_n. Let N be the dimension of this
representation. If the number of parts of la is greater then N, then
            f.inner_plethysm(g) = 0 by definition.  Otherwise, we can interpret f
            as the character of an irreducible GL_N representation, call it
sigma. Now sigma circ rho is an S_n representation and, by
            definition, the character of this representation is
            f.inner_plethysm(g).
