Looks good. Just so that it's on record:

the 4 -> 6 change simply ups the default precision to which something is computed. The `ceil()` to `floor() + 1` change only applies in the case of an exact answer, and this way the strict inequality requested in the new comment is always satisfied. The doctest exactly checks this.
