The problem is in local/bin/sage-download_package which checks for an error in the download very stupidly.  This needs to be rewritten.  The basic question is how to use urllib to tell whether a URL is valid or is a 404 not found. 

The thing that triggered this problem is that sagemath.org's server configuration somehow changed, which changed the error page displayed on failure. 

Component: **packages: optional**
