There are several parts to this patch.

The first is an update to `sage.misc.sage_timeit` that generalizes the interface to return an object that prints itself as a timing string rather than the string itself.  The advantage is that the information does not need to be parsed from the string later.  This patch is a requirement of the later ones but is conceptually independent.

The second adds a file `ncadoctest.py` to **scripts** that is a slightly modified version of Python's `doctest.py` file.  It is easier to subclass the various classes with this version.

The third uses `ncadoctest.py` to subclass the doctest architecture and updates `sage-doctest` to use these updated classes.

If I merge the patch without the troublesome hunk I see 4 doctests related to the random framework and timeit itself fail:

```

For "sage -sdist" to work we need to copy ncadoctest.py, sagedoctest.py in sage-make_devel_packages after 

```
  cp -p $SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/SbuildHack.pm $SCRIPTS/
```
I will take care of this once the patch passes doctests.

Cheers,

Michael

Hi Mike,

there is one tiny easy to fix doctest issue left:

```
sage -t -long devel/sage/sage/misc/sage_timeit.py           
**********************************************************************
File "/scratch/mabshoff/release-cycle/sage-3.2.rc0/devel/sage/sage/misc/sage_timeit.py", line 48:
    sage: sage_timeit("a = 2\nb=131\nfactor(a^b-1)", globals(), number=10)
Expected:
    '10 loops, best of 3: ... per loop'
Got:
    10 loops, best of 3: 18.4 ms per loop
**********************************************************************
```
I will fix this via a followup patch.

Cheers,

Michael
