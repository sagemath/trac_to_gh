There are several parts to this patch.

The first is an update to `sage.misc.sage_timeit` that generalizes the interface to return an object that prints itself as a timing string rather than the string itself.  The advantage is that the information does not need to be parsed from the string later.  This patch is a requirement of the later ones but is conceptually independent.

The second adds a file `ncadoctest.py` to **scripts** that is a slightly modified version of Python's `doctest.py` file.  It is easier to subclass the various classes with this version.

The third uses `ncadoctest.py` to subclass the doctest architecture and updates `sage-doctest` to use these updated classes.

Assignee: failure

Keywords: testing doctest timing timeit profile regression, editor_mhansen

Resolution: fixed
