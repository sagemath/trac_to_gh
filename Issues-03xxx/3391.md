-#3390 updates numpy to 1.1.0. Since that no longer works with the last stable release we also need to upgrade scipy to svn - figure out which revision to use.
+An spkg for this is at http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jason/scipy-0.7.spkg 
 
-Note: the latest scipy-0.7r4752svn.spkg (which should be used for further work) can be found at

+The patch below should be applied too.
