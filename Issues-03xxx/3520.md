With the new symbolics and Maxima 5.19.1:

```
sage: sqrt(25-x)*sqrt(1+1/(4*(25-x)))
sqrt(-1/4/(x - 25) + 1)*sqrt(-x + 25)
sage: f = _
sage: f.integral(x)
1/12*(4*I*x - 101*I)*sqrt(4*x - 101)
sage: f.integral(x,9,16)
-37/12*sqrt(37) + 65/12*sqrt(65)
sage: f.nintegral(x,9,16)
(24.9153783348643, 2.7661626694613149e-13, 21, 0)
sage: g = f.simplify_radical()
sage: g.integral(x,9,16)
37/12*sqrt(37) - 65/12*sqrt(65)
sage: ans = g.integral(x,9,16)
sage: ans.real()
37/12*sqrt(37) - 65/12*sqrt(65)
sage: RR(ans.real())
-24.9153783348643
```
Maxima can now integrate the original one, but still gives the wrong simplification (?) of f.  It seems to be choosing the wrong square root of negative one, as it were, since

```
sage: j = -g
sage: j.integrate(x,9,16)
-37/12*sqrt(37) + 65/12*sqrt(65)
```
So the real problem is in simplify_radical().

There are a lot of examples of problems with `simplify_radical`, but this one isn't particularly clear. It's not like someone is going to see the example in the description and go "oh, that affects me!"

I think this ultimately comes down to `sqrt(x^2)` anyway, and that is included as an example.

That was my reasoning anyway. If it will help get it reviewed faster, I'll add whatever you want =)

Well, I think that pointing out that things you might not think would be affected is not bad.
