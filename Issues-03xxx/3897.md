The problem is that ZZ has no object residue_field, while number rings have. Either one should add this function or write local_information separately for curves over QQ.

Attachment: **[3897-residue-fields-ZZ.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket3897/3897-residue-fields-ZZ.patch.gz)**

OK, so the patch 3897-residue-fields-ZZ.patch implements residue fields for ZZ.  ALong the way there were quite a few smallish fixes needed in related things, and while I was immersed in number_field.py etc I added a whole lot of docstrings and doctests there.

This applies to 3.1.2.rc1 AFTER the patches for #1951 which are related (they also relate to residue fields).

After this has been accepted (after revision if necessary, of course!)  then we can start to work on the original problem: I know that local_information() still does not work for curves defined over Q.  

Chris:  I have started going through all the functions for elliptic curve over Q vs. curves over number fields, to make everything as consistent as possible.  These residue field extensions will help.

Alex: this patch is intended only to fix the residue field for ZZ issue;  now I have done that I am still working on getting local information to work properly.  So this is really two tickets.

Could we merge and close this one and open a new one for the local info problem?  Or put the ZZ residue fields into a new patch which can be closed right away, with a cross-reference from this one?

OK, despite my previous remark I have finished and the 3rd patch (to be applied after previous) sorts out the original issue.   More than that:
* function _tidy_model() was wrong and has been fixed
* New file ell_local_data.py defines a new class EllipticCurveLocalData which does the work; code moved to here from ell_number_field (especially the _tate() function implementing Tate's algorithm)
* A few functions added to integer.pyx and rational.pyx so as to allow common code for QQ and other number fields.
* Now all functions in ell_number_field.py work on curves defined over QQ in a consistent way.
* Over QQ, new algorithm option "generic" in conductor() uses the generic number field code (slower, but shows consistency).

John,

This is good stuff.  Unfortunately, your patch does not contain your new file ell_local_data.py.  I think you probably forgot to add it to the hg repository before exporting your patch.

OK, I've done that.  I'm still getting used to the "hg q" way of doing things, which doesn't have a commit stage -- so while I think the patch is correctly identified as due to me, there is not (I think) the usual one-line description.

Enjoy.

the deprecated routine should still call the new function, i.e. a warning is issues, but the code still works.

Cheers,

I added a line to do that.  Trac would not let me replace Alex's, but it is a replacement.

The original intention was that any functionality that could be implemented
in a way that is common to both NumberField_absolute and QQ, should
be implemented in rings.number_field.NumberField.  Maybe you should just
move *all* such functionality up there?  If it can't be implemented there,
how will it make sense for QQ?

At least that was how the thinking went a year ago in the original implementation.
This may have turned out to be completely wrong.  Keep at it until you find
the right solution.

William,

I'm glad you commented on this.  That's exactly the path I had chosen to follow (after discussing it with Craig), so it's good to have confirmation from someone involved in the original design decision.
