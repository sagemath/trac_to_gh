The problem is that ZZ has no object residue_field, while number rings have. Either one should add this function or write local_information separately for curves over QQ.

OK, so the patch 3897-residue-fields-ZZ.patch implements residue fields for ZZ.  ALong the way there were quite a few smallish fixes needed in related things, and while I was immersed in number_field.py etc I added a whole lot of docstrings and doctests there.

This applies to 3.1.2.rc1 AFTER the patches for #1951 which are related (they also relate to residue fields).

After this has been accepted (after revision if necessary, of course!)  then we can start to work on the original problem: I know that local_information() still does not work for curves defined over Q.  

Chris:  I have started going through all the functions for elliptic curve over Q vs. curves over number fields, to make everything as consistent as possible.  These residue field extensions will help.

Alex: this patch is intended only to fix the residue field for ZZ issue;  now I have done that I am still working on getting local information to work properly.  So this is really two tickets.

Could we merge and close this one and open a new one for the local info problem?  Or put the ZZ residue fields into a new patch which can be closed right away, with a cross-reference from this one?

"

The original intention was that any functionality that could be implemented
in a way that is common to both NumberField_absolute and QQ, should
be implemented in rings.number_field.NumberField.  Maybe you should just
move *all* such functionality up there?  If it can't be implemented there,
how will it make sense for QQ?

At least that was how the thinking went a year ago in the original implementation.
This may have turned out to be completely wrong.  Keep at it until you find
the right solution.
