```
I don't want to have anything in common with ipython, but sage invokes
it on import sage.all, as can be checked easily:

This patch causes some problems on my machine.

1) Sage segfaults at exit.

2) When doing sage -t, I get the following problem for every file:

It seems that the import of IPython occurs because of the line

```

```
in "sage.misc.displayhook"

Is there a way to avoid this IPython import ?
