Here is how Ondrej Certik verifies that sage.all was importing ipython in sage-3.0.5:

```
I don't want to have anything in common with ipython, but sage invokes
it on import sage.all, as can be checked easily:

I think this shouldn't go into 3.0.6 since it could introduce bugs, as it touches several files.
That said, it's a smallish patch I made in 30 minutes.  So it's not crazy complicated.  It's just dangerous.

Attachment: **[sage-3685.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket3685/sage-3685.patch.gz)**

This patch causes some problems on my machine.

1) Sage segfaults at exit.

2) When doing sage -t, I get the following problem for every file:

<a id='comment:5'>Comment 5:</a>
I just tried it out and got none of the problems described above.  

'import sage.all' doesn't import IPython as desired.  I'm not putting up a positive review because of the problems described above, but I would be nice to have feedback on this

I'm on OS X 10.5 with this patch applied against 3.1.4.

I am not able to sort things out.

It seems that the import of IPython occurs because of the line

```
from IPython.core.formatters import PlainTextFormatter
```
in "sage.misc.displayhook"

Is there a way to avoid this IPython import ?
