(This ticket was split off from #2943)

This is okay:

```
sage: K = Qp(13,7)
sage: R.<t> = K[]       
sage: a = 13^7*t^3 + K(169,4)*t - 13^4
sage: a[1:2]
(13^2 + O(13^4))*t
```

This dies:

```
sage: t[0:1]
[boom]
```

The original context for this bug was along the lines of (see #2943 for more examples):

```
sage: K = Qp(p,10)
sage: C.<t> = LaurentSeriesRing(K)
sage: D.<s> = PolynomialRing(C)
sage: z = (1 + O(t)) + t*s^2
sage: z * z
[boom]
```

First comment: getslice is deprecated; it should be `__getitem__` now.

Second, there is a standard block of code for slicing...using that will make sure that things are consistent for people that understand python slices.
