1. Go to any interactive help sheet in the notebook.

2. Go the very very bottom cell, below the text.

3. Press shift enter.

4. I get this traceback in the server log:

```
...
cell.evaluate(username = self.username)
exceptions.AttributeError: TextCell instance has no attribute 'evaluate'
```

It's bad form getting tracebacks in the server log, though everything continues
to work fine.   The fix is to figure out why a text cell is having evaluate called
on it.  Is the bottom cell somehow incorrectly set to be a text cell?
