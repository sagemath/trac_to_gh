Attachment: **[trac3431-qepcad-interface-part2.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket3431/trac3431-qepcad-interface-part2.patch.gz)**

I've attached a patch to update the qepcad interface to deal with the newest interval printing, and to avoid locking the interface to one particular version of qepcad.

Note that this patch depends on #3910 (without #3910, one doctest will fail).
