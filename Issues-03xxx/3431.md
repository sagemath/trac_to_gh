This patch looks very nice and seems to behave as advertised.  There are some doctests that should be updated for qepcad 1.50 and also for the new interval printing notation in Sage 3.1.  Positive review pending fixing those things.

**Attachment:** [trac3431-qepcad-interface-part2.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket3431/trac3431-qepcad-interface-part2.patch.gz)

I've attached a patch to update the qepcad interface to deal with the newest interval printing, and to avoid locking the interface to one particular version of qepcad.

Note that this patch depends on #3910 (without #3910, one doctest will fail).
