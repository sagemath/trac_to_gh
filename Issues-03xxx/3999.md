I am trying hard to see how this might actually be useful in practice.

If we had a whole implementation of additive abelian groups (as Z-modules, within the modules package) then this could be useful to allow for multiplicative abelian groups.

But in fact the whole abelian groups machinery is already multiplicative.  What I tried, and nearly succeeded doing, was to all additive notation for those.  Perhaps it would be possible to have a version of this patch which goes the other way.  But I have other things to do than learn how to do that.

This is not a negative review, just a non-review.

The first thing that comes to mind is the generic discrete log code that you wrote a while back. One then wouldn't have to use the cumbersome (and slower) op(x,y) notation for the group operations to be able to handle both additive (via the wrapper) and multiplicative groups. 

I had assumed the implementation of abelian groups was, at its core, additive using Z-modules and all (this seems more natural to me, as well as much more efficient). I'm not sure if this is part of the "great abelian groups rewrite" or not, but IMHO I think it should be. I also wrote the patch this direction because (in Sage) additive groups are all abelien (they inherit from modules), and there is a functor from them to generic non-abelien groups but not the other way around. It could also be handy in trying to (formally) implement Z[G] where G is initially presented as an additive group. 

Trying to add additive notation to these would be difficult, as they do not inherit from ModuleElement. Were you trying to make it so if I took elements of a multiplicative group (say, a permutation group) and did `a+b` it would instead do `a*b`. I would probably rather have it throw an error in this case. 

I could pretty easily write a patch going the other way if you would find it useful (though strange stuff might happen if one tries to use it on non-abelien groups, depending on the assumptions people make throughout the rest of the Sage library).

I have made more progress in my adaptation of the existing Abelian Groups code (which uses additive representation internally, but multiplicative notation for input and output) work for additive group notation (for input and output).  I'll post a patch when I have finished doing doctests -- everything I wanted to be able to do now works, but for every single function I need to add additive examples as well as the existing multiplicative ones).

For my purposes, my patch will work fine, for example with elliptic curve groups which are naturally additive, and is preferable to what Robert has implemented here.  But it is a very different approach to the one here, which uses the coercion machinery which I am pretty sure I will never understand.

The bitrot was due to #4310 and #4175, the patch has been updated. 

Thre needs to be more doctests.

I'll hold off until I see John Cremona's patch. Could you post it, even if it's not done yet? I'm not sure I like the idea of `a+b` just working for any multiplicative group though. 

Most of my patch is not about coercion, but anyone doesn't understand how coercion is working I'm the one to blame until I at the very least put out some good documentation.

OK, will do.  a+b will not work for multiplicative groups:  it will give a NotImplementedError, while a*b will work.  And vive versa if the group was created as multiplicative (which will be the old, default behaviour).
