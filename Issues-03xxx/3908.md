Currently there is a major memory leak in fast_float because it uses `__del__` instead of `__dealloc__`.  (Python uses `__del__`, Cython uses `__dealloc__`.)

Before:

```
sage: from sage.ext.fast_eval import fast_float_constant
sage: get_memory_usage()
117.859375
sage: print sum([fast_float_constant(3.0)] * 2000)
<sage.ext.fast_eval.FastDoubleFunc object at 0xb7ab4b54>
sage: get_memory_usage()
163.6328125
```

After:

```
sage: from sage.ext.fast_eval import fast_float_constant
sage: get_memory_usage()
117.859375
sage: print sum([fast_float_constant(3.0)] * 2000)
<sage.ext.fast_eval.FastDoubleFunc object at 0xb7b18b54>
sage: get_memory_usage()
117.98828125

Mmmh, it seems that having suppression enabled only works with --leak-check=full, so I need to investigate here.
