There was an issue with Stock.historical() only returning stock information from Jan 1, 1990 onward and no earlier. The addition of an explicit enddate to the Google Finance query seems to fix this. Fix is demonstrated in the doctests of Stock.historical()

Uses the datetime.date python module.

**Assignee:** @cswiercz

**Keywords:** finance, historical, stock, Stock

**Resolution:** fixed

REFEREE REPORT:

Great work!  Now be professionals and fix everything below :-)

* The function `_load_from_csv(self, R)` in stock.py is missing a doctest

* I like the Day --> OHCL change. 

* Member functions in the Sage library should never be upper case, so

```
    def Open(self, *args, **kwds):
```
must become

```
    def open(self, *args, **kwds):
```

* The doctest for Open contains `\code{self.google()`.  Since the docstring is a string that \c gets turned into a weird character.  You have to do either `\\code{self.google()` or (better) just replace `"""` at the top by `r"""`.  Same for `def Close`, etc.  

* This doctest SUCKS:

```
+            sage: finance.Stock('goog').load_from_file('/Users/cswiercz/GOOG-minutely.txt')[:5]    # optional -- requires s
ource file
+            [
```
We actually *do* test all optional doctests sometimes, and do expect them to pass on a reasonably configured machine.   I suggest the following workaround.  Make a subdirectory of SAGE_ROOT/examples called "finance".  Put your file in there.  Do hg ci in there to add it to the examples repo.  Post a patch using "hg export tip" in that repo.  If you get stuck, let me know.   Then in the doctest just put SAGE_ROOT + 'examples/finance/your_filename.txt'.   And you won't have to make it optional, which is always a plus. 

* This code in your patch (in the function load_from_file) contains a bug:

```
+        try:
+            R = file_obj.read();
+        except IOError:
+            raise IOError, msg + "Bad path or file name"
```

You mean to write:

```
+        try:
+            R = file_obj.read();
+        except IOError, msg :
+            raise IOError, msg + "Bad path or file name"
```
A doctest should illustrate this exception maybe, so you would have caught this bug.

* 5 Doctests in stock.py fail:

The patches should be merged in order as posted, that is:


all_updates_and_cid.patch


add_load_file1.patch


add_close.patch


load_file_bug_fix.patch

I am talking with William about this, but it seems unclear to me who gave a review to what. For example: Chris posted sage-3621-part10.patch and also gave that patch a positive review. It seems like a minor patch, but we should follow procedure here.

Cheers,

Alas, several issues need to be resolved and some features need to be added:

* Yahoo doesn't like explicit exchange declarations. (i.e. `finance.Stock("NASDAQ:GOOG")` returns zero.) Parse the input and store the exchange and symbol separately.

* Yahoo should be implemented as a backup to Google Finance historical queries if Google Finance happens to return zero.

* Fix some issues regarding explicit exchange declarations in general. (i.e. `finance.Stock("HKG:0700").historical()` returns zero.) Improve the way queries handle exchange / symbol relationships. For example, only default to `"NASDAQ"` if no exchange is given.

* Rename `Stock.google()` back to `Stock.historical()`

* Consolidate the ten+ patches above.

I'm taking care of this right now! :)

REFEREE REPORT:

Positive Review.   This is superb code.

I had to make a few minor changes since for some reason google changed their database.  I also updated some of the # optional tags for the new system. 

Michael, to apply this you must:
1. Apply 3621-combined.patch and sage-3621-trivial_referee_followup.patch to the Sage library.

2. Apply 3621–example.patch to the repo in SAGE_ROOT/examples/.

That's it.

 -- William
