Attachment [factor_docstring.patch](tarball://root/attachments/some-uuid/ticket3695/factor_docstring.patch) by @williamstein created at 2008-07-21 18:55:38

REFEREE:

Looks good. It is also safe to apply to sage-3.0.6 even since it contains no new doctests and no new source code.

I was not quick enough to catch this before it got merged.  I think that for integers it is a little misleading to describe the output as a sorted list of pairs (p,e): it is a more sophisticated structure:

```
sage: n=-100          
sage: f=factor(n)     
sage: type(f)
<class 'sage.structure.factorization.Factorization'>
```
which has a number of associated methods:

```
sage: f.
f.base_ring       f.dumps           f.prod            f.simplify        f.value
f.category        f.expand          f.rename          f.sort            f.version
f.db              f.is_commutative  f.reset_name      f.unit            
f.dump            f.plot            f.save            f.unit_part     
```
It is true that you can get a list of pairs (p,e):

```
sage: list(f)
[(2, 2), (5, 2)]
```
but that misses the unit part:

```
sage: f.unit()
-1
```
as well as three different ways of recovering the factored integer (prod, expand, value).

No, I was not accusing you of breaking anything!

As factorization of integers is something which new users (e.g. in elementary number theory classes) will want to do -- and something which Sage does very well -- I think it is worth improving the docstring for integers. 

I'll add a new patch (to be applied after yours) in a few minutes.
