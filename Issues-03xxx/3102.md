Well, the patch applied fine and doctests pass.  BUT  when I manually type in

```
            sage: K = Qp(7, print_mode="digits")
            sage: repr(K(1/2))
```
I do NOT get what the doctest says I should:

```
            '...3|3|3|3|3|3|3|3|3|3|3|3|3|3|3|3|3|3|3|4'
```
but instead I get this:

```
'...33333333333333333334'
```

I don't know why the vertial lines a re missing, or whether they should be there;  but I do know that the doctester ignores what comes after three dots ... so any p-adics print mode which includes the dots is going to be rather hard to doctest.

But in line 68 you have just set the print-mode to "bars", while here you have set the mode to "digits".

I just don't understand the concept of output being different during doctests and runtime!

Regarding your last sentence: each test should be independent of earlier ones surely, starting in a separate Sage session?  How can it be correct to explicitly set the print_mode to "digits" but have a doctest showing that apparantly "bars" is output?

I still find this too confusing.
