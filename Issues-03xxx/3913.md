```
In 3.1 you can't ask for the order of an ideal class.  Example:

```
sage: K.<w>=QuadraticField(-23)
sage: OK=K.ring_of_integers()
sage: C=OK.class_group()
sage: h=C.order()
sage: P2a,P2b=[P for P,e in (2*OK).factor()]
sage: c=C(P2a); c
Fractional ideal class (2, 1/2*w - 1/2)
sage: c.order()
#boom
```

This is easily provided:

```
sage: sage.groups.generic.order_from_multiple(c,c.parent().order(),operation='*')
3
```

Patch coming up.

The patch implements this, and adds doctests to some other functions.  Based on 3.1.1, and all doctests in sage/rings/number_fields pass.

Thanks -- sorry to have opened a new ticket unnecessarily (I did look, honest).  In any case this patch is more efficient, and shows how useful the generic algorithms I implemented are!
