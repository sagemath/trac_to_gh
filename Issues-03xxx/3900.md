See #3482 and #3899.

Each copy of Sage should include an official pickle jar that gets tested.  This should go in the data directory.

We need to deal with -sdist and -bdist copying pickle_jar.tar.bz2. One way to do this would be to check the file into the repo, but that seems like a bad idea. 

Thoughts?

Hi folks,

there does not seem to be any problem with binary distributions, once that file "pickle_jar.tar.bz2" exists. See line 52 of the "sage-bdist" script, where among others the complete subtree under /data is copied over.

As for source distributions, essentially the distribution of the file "pickle_jar.tar.bz2" is not necessary --- it can be (re-)produced from any source distribution by a (very) short sequence of commands that does not change. In that sense it's a "build output". For convenience, one might think about having a make target "make pickle_jar".

But since the doctest introduced by this patch requires the prior existence of this file "pickle_jar.tar.bz2", and since maybe we don't want to produce updated pickle jars for each and every Sage version in say the alpha release cycles, a simplistic spkg could be the solution:

"sage_pickle_jar-X.Y.Z.spkg" containing just the three files "spkg-install", "SPKG.txt", and "pickle_jar.tar.bz2"; and spkg-install just issue a single "cp" command.
Then, e.g. Sage version 3.3.2.alpha4 could still contain the spkg "sage_pickle_jar-3.3.1.spkg".

To make the creation of updated versions of this simplistic spkg easier, using the existing scripts machinery, it would be advisable not to use the directory "data/" to store the file "pickle_jar.tar.bz2", but instead the directory "data/sage_pickle_jar/",
and storing there all these three files. (So a simple "spkg -pkg ..." does the job of creating the updated spkg.)

Of course the naming could also be "std_pickle_jar" instead, or similar.

I'd volunteer to create and test the needed script "spkg-install" resp. that simplistic spkg, opening another ticket for it, if someone gives me a "Yep. Good idea. Go for it!". Then the usual review process would take its course, and this ticket would depend on that other ticket. 

Cheers,

gsw

Replying to [GeorgSWeber](#comment%3A9):

Maybe, but in which spkg does the data directory end up? I can see the content of extcode, but not the data directory itself.

> As for source distributions, essentially the distribution of the file "pickle_jar.tar.bz2" is not necessary --- it can be (re-)produced from any source distribution by a (very) short sequence of commands that does not change. In that sense it's a "build output". For convenience, one might think about having a make target "make pickle_jar".


The point is that the *old* pickle jar works.

> But since the doctest introduced by this patch requires the prior existence of this file "pickle_jar.tar.bz2", and since maybe we don't want to produce updated pickle jars for each and every Sage version in say the alpha release cycles, a simplistic spkg could be the solution:
> 
> "sage_pickle_jar-X.Y.Z.spkg" containing just the three files "spkg-install", "SPKG.txt", and "pickle_jar.tar.bz2"; and spkg-install just issue a single "cp" command.
> Then, e.g. Sage version 3.3.2.alpha4 could still contain the spkg "sage_pickle_jar-3.3.1.spkg".
> 
> To make the creation of updated versions of this simplistic spkg easier, using the existing scripts machinery, it would be advisable not to use the directory "data/" to store the file "pickle_jar.tar.bz2", but instead the directory "data/sage_pickle_jar/",
> and storing there all these three files. (So a simple "spkg -pkg ..." does the job of creating the updated spkg.)


We don't want another spkg - that idea was rejected. I am not 100% clear why, but that is what lead to this problem in the first place.

The easiest solution IMHO would be to check the archive into $SAGE_ROOT/data/extcode/pickle_jar and adjust the path in the patch here.

Cheers,

On closer inspection: we don't even have to check in the pickle jar into the ext repo, so I will just put it in there.
