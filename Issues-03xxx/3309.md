Hi Sage-Devel,

This email was to pari-devel, but is also directly relevant
to sage.   See my comment on the bottom below.  (I didn't
both to respond to the pari list because all my emails 
there bounce.)

Great idea in the case when the first input to binomial is 
floating point. 

In Sage on my laptop:

sage: time a = binomial(RR(1140000.78), 420000)
CPU times: user 3.64 s, sys: 0.10 s, total: 3.73 s
Wall time: 3.76 s

Using your trick:
sage: F = lambda n,k: gamma(n+1)/gamma(k+1)/gamma(n-k+1)
sage: time b = F(RR(1140000.78),RR(420000))
CPU times: user 0.00 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.00 s
Wall time: 0.00 s

More precisely:
sage: timeit('F(RR(1140000.78),RR(420000))')
625 loops, best of 3: 422 Âµs per loop
sage: timeit('binomial(RR(1140000.78), 420000)')
5 loops, best of 3: 3.3 s per loop

So your suggestion is about 8000 times faster.

Note though that due to rounding the answers are different:

sage: a
2.99132584452787e325824
sage: b
2.99132584452800e325824
sage: a - b
-1.27118374810324e325811

Which is closer?  Definitely your formula using Gamma
gives a closer answer as i checked using interval
arithmetic to high precision:

sage: time a = binomial(RealIntervalField(1000)(1140000.78), 420000)
CPU times: user 6.33 s, sys: 0.26 s, total: 6.59 s
Wall time: 6.73 s
sage: a

Doing 
sage: binomial??
shows that Sage's binomial function is not calling PARI
in this case (since the first input isn't an int), but presumably
Sage and PARI are implementing the same algorithm.

    if isinstance(x, (int, long, integer.Integer)):
        return integer_ring.ZZ(pari(x).binomial(m))
    try:
        P = x.parent()
    except AttributeError:
        P = type(x)
    if m < 0:
        return P(0)
    return misc.prod([x-i for i in xrange(m)]) / P(factorial(m))

I think making the gamma optimization you suggest when
the first input is floating point real or complex is a great
idea.

It looks like this will get fixed in an upcoming version of PARI:

Nobody had really needed it, but it's indeed easy to improve...

Not quite so simple as the above though, since gamma() becomes relatively more
costly as the precision increases:

(00:36) gp > \p1000
  realprecision = 1001 significant digits (1000 digits displayed)
(01:03) gp > for(i=1,10, F(1140000.78,100))
time = 709 ms.

(01:03) gp > for(i=1,10, binomial(1140000.78,  100))
time = 56 ms.
(01:05) gp > for(i=1,10, binomial(1140000.78, 1000))
time = 509 ms.

At this accuracy (\p1000) the threshold in favour of the gamma quotient is
around k ~ 1400, for binomial(n, k)  [ k <= n/2 ]



I have committed an improved version to svn.

Thanks for pointing this out,
Karim
```

Has this improvement been implemented in Pari yet? With Sage 3.4, I still see the above slowness, and the gamma() suggestion is over 1000 times faster than the current implementation with the above example.
