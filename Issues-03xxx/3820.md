This patch needs to be rebased unless there is some dependency I am not aware of:

```
sage-3.3.alpha4/devel/sage$ patch -p1 < trac_3820.patch\?format\=raw 
patching file sage/server/notebook/templates/worksheet_listing.html
Hunk #1 succeeded at 130 (offset 1 line).
Hunk #2 FAILED at 178.
1 out of 2 hunks FAILED -- saving rejects to file sage/server/notebook/templates/worksheet_listing.html.rej
```

Cheers,

Michael
