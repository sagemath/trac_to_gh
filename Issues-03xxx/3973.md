One small comment on the patch: Please escape the hash in the docstring since otherwise TeX will be unhappy when building the documentation:

```
This used to be different see trac #3973
```

John: I assume this patch is right up your alley.

Looks good to me -- Chris had already pointed out to me this missing case (in code I wrote).

I fixed the hash, and also made a couple of small other changes to the docstring which makes it clearer (I hope).  

Applies cleanly to 3.1.1, and all doctests in elliptic_curves pass.  I think this (both patches) can be merged.
