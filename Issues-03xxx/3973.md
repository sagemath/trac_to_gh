this is to correct a small thing in short_weierstrass_model. It used to return an error in characteristic 3 for each curve, even if the curve was given in short weierstrass form.

Looks good to me -- Chris had already pointed out to me this missing case (in code I wrote).

I fixed the hash, and also made a couple of small other changes to the docstring which makes it clearer (I hope).  

Applies cleanly to 3.1.1, and all doctests in elliptic_curves pass.  I think this (both patches) can be merged.
