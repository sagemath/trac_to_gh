I compiled sage-3.0 on the machines of my lab, and installed it under /usr/local/sage-3.0 with make install DESTDIR=/usr/local/sage-3.0.
I am the Unix owner of the files under /usr/local/sage-3.0. When I run sage myself, it is ok. However, when other people in my lab run it, they get:

```
< bissogae@hector:~$ sage
< ----------------------------------------------------------------------
< | SAGE Version 3.0, Release Date: 2008-04-23                         |

< ----------------------------------------------------------------------
< Traceback (most recent call last):

< IOError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/usr/local/sage-3.0/sage/local/lib/sage-current-location.txt'
<
< sage:
```
I'm not sure it is ok that SAGE writes in /usr/local...

Hi Paul,

I am curious if you started Sage after running "make install". Starting Sage once after running the make install is needed so that the pyc files are recreated. After that Sage should not need to have write access to anything outside `~/.sage`. So I consider this a blocker. We must make the deployment of Sage as simple as possible and this includes having Sage in multi user environments.

Cheers,

Michael

It seems the touching /usr/local is caused by the "Sage moved" script, so I assume that the best "fix" is to print a better error message?

Looking at the problem again it seems that there might be another problem here. Several possibilities

* other people ran sage before Paul did, hence sage-location was executed. We fixed that bug
* somebody else has mounted the directory with sage in a different location than Paul in which case sage_location will cause the above error. There is nothing we can do in that case since the pyc files have to be recreated
