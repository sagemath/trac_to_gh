I compiled sage-3.0 on the machines of my lab, and installed it under /usr/local/sage-3.0 with make install DESTDIR=/usr/local/sage-3.0.
I am the Unix owner of the files under /usr/local/sage-3.0. When I run sage myself, it is ok. However, when other people in my lab run it, they get:

```

```
I'm not sure it is ok that SAGE writes in /usr/local...

Hi Paul,

I am curious if you started Sage after running "make install". Starting Sage once after running the make install is needed so that the pyc files are recreated. After that Sage should not need to have write access to anything outside `~/.sage`. So I consider this a blocker. We must make the deployment of Sage as simple as possible and this includes having Sage in multi user environments.

Cheers,

Michael
