Extra things this patch does:

`line([(0,0,0),(1,1,1)])` no longer produces a 3d line, but a 2d line from the first 2 coordinates.  Use line3d to get a 3d line.

`line(object)` no longer tries object.plot() first, which is a very, very good thing, since it is natural to assume that line(object) will be something like a line, but object.plot() could be *anything*.

`line` no longer has a "coerce" argument; all input data is always coerced to float.  I've changed this to use numpy to convert to float; currently, that's a bit faster, from some tests that wstein ran.  As wstein mentioned on IRC, we should try to replace the float conversion with a snippet of Cython.

`text` used to make 3d text when a 3d point was passed; now it only makes 2d text.  Use the text3d for 3d text.

Positive review for the initial part (mhansen's part).  The referee patch adds enough functionality that it probably ought to be reviewed as well.

There was a thread about the proposed new behavior of line:

line([(0,0,0),(1,1,1)]) no longer produces a 3d line, but a 2d line from the first 2 coordinates. Use line3d to get a 3d line.

http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/6f4b382145c09546

All the comments were negative.  That needs to be addressed, right?

I suspect I may be overstepping my bounds by changing this from positive review to needs work--if so, I'll accept an appropriate wrist slapping.

This looks good to me, it restores the old behavior. If something else is desired it should be dealt with via a new ticket since this code should go in and would bitrot quickly.
