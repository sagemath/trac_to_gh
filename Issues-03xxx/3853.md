Extra things this patch does:

`line([(0,0,0),(1,1,1)])` no longer produces a 3d line, but a 2d line from the first 2 coordinates.  Use line3d to get a 3d line.

`line(object)` no longer tries object.plot() first, which is a very, very good thing, since it is natural to assume that line(object) will be something like a line, but object.plot() could be *anything*.

`line` no longer has a "coerce" argument; all input data is always coerced to float.  I've changed this to use numpy to convert to float; currently, that's a bit faster, from some tests that wstein ran.  As wstein mentioned on IRC, we should try to replace the float conversion with a snippet of Cython.

`text` used to make 3d text when a 3d point was passed; now it only makes 2d text.  Use the text3d for 3d text.

There was a thread about the proposed new behavior of line:

line([(0,0,0),(1,1,1)]) no longer produces a 3d line, but a 2d line from the first 2 coordinates. Use line3d to get a 3d line.

http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/6f4b382145c09546

All the comments were negative.  That needs to be addressed, right?

I suspect I may be overstepping my bounds by changing this from positive review to needs work--if so, I'll accept an appropriate wrist slapping.

This looks good to me, it restores the old behavior. If something else is desired it should be dealt with via a new ticket since this code should go in and would bitrot quickly.
