Hi
I just read the installation readme and built my own application to
start the sageserver:

Just start the Apple-ScriptEditor and enter the following code:

tell application "Terminal"
        do script "/Applications/sage/sage -notebook"
end tell

Well, that's all. Now only save the script as a program-bundle. After
that, you can assign the .app file a nice icon and put it in your
dock, click it, see firefox coming up and have fun.

I'd propose that this app could be part of the sage-install
bundle... ;-)

Hope, you like this tip

greeting,
Kai-Philipp

I believe this issue is invalid now that we have a Sage.app.

On OS X, we can create an app bundle from a newly compiled source tarball:

```
export SAGE_APP_BUNDLE=yes
./sage -bdist version
```

So close as invalid.
