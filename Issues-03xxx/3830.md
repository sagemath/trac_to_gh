The error that comes from line could just be very lightly wrapped in an error from plot that says plot error using the line command.  This could thus be almost trivially fixed.

This looks nice, but the error message is a bit confusing: you have

```
raise RuntimeError("Error in line: option '%s' not valid."%opt) 
```
and when I see that error message, it looks like it's trying to tell me there's an error on some line of code, and not in the function that produces lines. Perhaps change it to "Error in Line(): option..."?
