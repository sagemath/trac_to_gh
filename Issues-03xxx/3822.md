The problem is that something like

```
slider(1, 10^6)
```
generates 10<sup>6</sup> values, which get sent back to the user. Now, there is no reason to use 10<sup>6</sup> values when the maximum number of accessible values (via manipulating the slider) is 500.

It is still broken since you didn't deal with the case when the input is a list of values.  

E.g.,

```
@interact
def _(n=range_slider([1..10000])):
    print n
```

breaks it.
