<div id="comment:0"></div>

Here is an illustration (requires #3636):

```
@interact
def _(t=text_control("n = <span id='n'>0</span>\
        <script>n=parseInt($('#n').text()); $('#n').text(1+n);</script>"),
    l=["Increment"]
): pass
```

Pressing "Increment" increments n, which implies that the line of Javascript code *in the header* is executed.

And, as an added bonus we also fix another bug!  Namely, if you put e.g., 

```
html("alert('hi')")
```

in a cell and hit shift-enter, then hi pops up in an alert ONCE, but if you
then refresh the page, "hi" pops up in an alert twice.   Now it only happens once
in both cases.

Positive review.

There is still a bug, namely, if one tries

```
html("<script>alert('</script>');</script>")
```
and the same for html tags. However, this defect existed before.
