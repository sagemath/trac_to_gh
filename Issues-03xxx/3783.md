The cached_method decorator from #3781 could use some improvements:

```
<mhansen> Does anyone feel up for reviewing #3781 for me?
<ncalexan> I'll look at it, one moment.  I've wanted this 
for a while.
<mhansen> Awesome.  It doesn't work on C extension types 
though since they don't have a __dict__.  This could be 
done by storing the cache in the decorator object with a 
weakref though.
<ncalexan> The problem is much more complicated than this.
<ncalexan> Okay, there are other problems too, like 
un-hashable arguments will break it.
<mhansen> Yep
<ncalexan> And there is no way to clear the cache...
<ncalexan> And the tests don't actually demonstrate that 
the cache is workin.
<ncalexan> (One could touch the cache with an incorrect 
answer, then verify it is "correctly" returning that value)
<ncalexan> For what it is, though, it's fine.  It will 
hurt nothing -- shall I review positive?
<mhansen> If you could, that'd be great.  I do know it's 
limitations, but there are some big patches going in that 
depend on it.  I'll make a ticket with your comments for 
improvement.

- It does work on C extension types, provided they inherit from `Parent`.
- If I am not mistaken, it is now possible to define a function that does some preprocessing on the key. Thus, unhashable arguments should be fine, but certainly not out of the box.
- There is a way to clear the cache. It is a method of the cached method.
- I think the tests do demonstrate that the cache is working.
