Now I think left or right parenthesis sends carriage return.  I think this likely has something to do with updating the keyboard support for the new safari browser.

I fixed this by disabling *all* keyboard shortcut handling on the iphone.  This is a good idea, since the iphone does not have any of the keys needed to send any of the keyboard shortcuts, and it gets around the problem.  

To referee this 3-line patch, just verify that clearly I didn't break anything, since all I did was add a special case to check for the iphone string in the browser UA tag, and only then disable keyboard shortcut handling.

I'm moving this back to 3.2.  It's harmless (famous last words), and I really think having iphone support working again is an extremely important bug fix.
