Now I think left or right parenthesis sends carriage return.  I think this likely has something to do with updating the keyboard support for the new safari browser.

I fixed this by disabling *all* keyboard shortcut handling on the iphone.  This is a good idea, since the iphone does not have any of the keys needed to send any of the keyboard shortcuts, and it gets around the problem.  

To referee this 3-line patch, just verify that clearly I didn't break anything, since all I did was add a special case to check for the iphone string in the browser UA tag, and only then disable keyboard shortcut handling.
