Way to reproduce:

- start notebook
- create worksheet
- publish worksheet
- go to "published worksheets"
- click published worksheet

result:

"edit this" or "edit a copy" link lead to another "published" version, not a normal worksheet

expected result:

an editable worksheet

NOTE: This worked properly in 3.0.6

Component: **notebook**

I believe that this is because somewhere the wrong username is taken into account. Here is an example: publish a worksheet, and navigate to it. The link should say "edit this", not "edit a copy".

Alternatively, I found that the username passed to worksheet_html() in notebook.py is "pub", but was unable to find the source of the problem.
