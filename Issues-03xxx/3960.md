- publish worksheet
- go to "published worksheets"
- click published worksheet

I believe that this is because somewhere the wrong username is taken into account. Here is an example: publish a worksheet, and navigate to it. The link should say "edit this", not "edit a copy".

Alternatively, I found that the username passed to worksheet_html() in notebook.py is "pub", but was unable to find the source of the problem.
