Way to reproduce:

- start notebook
- create worksheet
- publish worksheet
- go to "published worksheets"
- click published worksheet

result:

"edit this" or "edit a copy" link lead to another "published" version, not a normal worksheet

expected result:

an editable worksheet

NOTE: This worked properly in 3.0.6
