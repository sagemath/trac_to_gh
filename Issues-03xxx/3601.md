I split TensorProductOfCrystals into TensorProductOfCrystalsWithGenerators and
FullTensorProductOfCrystals (with or without the option of being a classical crystal).
This makes it possible to have a more efficient way to access list, count, etc for 
tensor products that do not have module generators.

Also, the distinction between the specifications of module_generators and 
highest_weight_vectors is made more precise (which made it necessary to slightly 
change the implementation of Daniel Bump on characters).

This change is necessary for the upcoming implementation of affine crystals.

Hi Anne,

I added a few doctests and fixed some whitespace issues (there were tabs instead of spaces).  If you're fine with these changes, I'll go ahead and give it a positive review so it can get merged.

Hi Mike,

Yes, your changes look fine to me (I wonder how the tabs instead of 
spaces happened to be wrong?).

Anne, Mike,

to be 100% clear: both patches should be applied in this case?

Cheers,
