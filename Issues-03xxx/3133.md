You could type

sage: parametric_plot( list(exp(-t) * evec), 0, 2)

I think it would be reasonable for us to improve parametric_plot so that it takes a vector 
as input instead of just a list or tuple.

I thought it was probably okay since they were not in the global namespace *and* their documentation said that they were internal functions.  I was just making them more conventional internal functions.

If you'd like I can make them deprecated.  Let me know.  I think it's okay in this case to just change the names.
