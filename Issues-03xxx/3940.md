The builtin python warnings framework allows filtering on subclasses of warnings.  This would be useful to make a sage warnings framework, with different types of sage-specific warnings.

Here, I've added a directory and a basic file with a NumericalPrecisionWarning class that could be triggered, for example, in the eigenvalue computations.

Jason,

now that #3873 has been merged can you check how much of this patch is still useful/applies?

Cheers,

It is useful and it still applies; the application is still sitting in my queue, though.

Basically, there are some situations where computing eigenvalues/vectors should throw a warning.  Also, the plotting code should throw a warning when some situations come up (when the function can't be evaluated at certain points).  The point of this patch is that: 

1. It makes it so that sage-related warnings are always shown by default.

2. It makes it very easy to do something with all sage-related warnings (e.g., throw exceptions or ignore them and don't print them out, etc.)

If you want to wait until I post a patch that uses this, that's fine.

IMHO if the warnings framework is expected to stay as one file, then it should be in the misc directory; if you expect the warnings framework to expand to multiple files then maybe a new directory would be more appropriate.

What is the status here? Not having a proper summary subject makes files fall through the cracks. 

Either this code is useful in which case it should be applied or not. It seems that cwitty's has some pointers, so what's going on here? :)

I agree with cwitty:

Work that needs to be done on this patch to get it ready for review:

* Make it one file in the misc directory

If warnings become a more important part of Sage, then later we can break things into a different directory.

I uploaded sagewarnings.py which derives from Jason's patch.
This extension addresses the lack of use cases by providing some warning classes adapted to particular things I've got in mind. This file is for discussion; See the thread on sage-devel.

I renamed the file warning.py to sagewarnings.py. This seems more consistent with python's warnings module to me.
