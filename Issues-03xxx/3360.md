In my case: I wrote a private email to the sympow author and he told me about the URL.

I was in correspondence with the sympow author about the recent segfault patch. Afterwards I proposed to move the project to github and basically take over maintenance but I have not heard back for a while since then.

It is a team work. To my knowledge, Julian is a new comer. Whatever, it was certainly fix a long time given that I wrote the Debian patches a long time ago, at least before that Stretch was frozen.
Concerning Sage on Debian, the best is to send an email to the dedicated list:

Its not strictly relevant for this ticket and I thought about just emailing you, but maybe the sage package upgrade will run into the same problems.\n\nSo nix installs every package in its own prefix. That means sympow would go into `/nix/store/some-sympow-specific-folder-name/`. Only the sympow files would be in that folder.\n\nI'm currently achieving that by setting the install flag `DESTDIR=$out` ($out pointing to that sympow directory).

<a id='comment:33'></a>Okay turns out I just messed up packaging. Its not strictly relevant for this ticket and I thought about just emailing you, but maybe the sage package upgrade will run into the same problems.

So nix installs every package in its own prefix. That means sympow would go into `/nix/store/some-sympow-specific-folder-name/`. Only the sympow files would be in that folder.

I'm currently achieving that by setting the install flag `DESTDIR=$out` ($out pointing to that sympow directory). However when launching an example from the README, it fails because it looks for the `new_data` script in `/usr/local/lib/sympow`. That script is in `$out/usr/local/lib/sympow`. Here's the error:

Am I doing something wrong or is that an issue with the `Configure` script? I'm executing `./Configure` without parameters. pari is included in the build dependencies.

Also in case you find the time, it would be great if you could add a handful of test cases. I see that you already have some tests in the debian package. Otherwilse I'll just take some from the README, but having them included in the package is better of course.

it is why it is written that they are meant mainly for development and debugging purpose

DESTDIR is mainly meant for packaging in custom Makefile (not for testing)

To do what you want, I guess that you have to set up PREFIX (and maybe VARPREFIX) as it is done with customary Makefile.

The patches I brought from Debian are meant to ease integration in Unix for maintainers and users (compare to the original version): DESTDIR, PREFIX, and VARPREFIX have the customary meaning.

Basically you cannot test in DESTDIR unless you set correctly the environment variables because
PREFIXed  paths are hard coded.

 pari is included in the build dependencies.

The test in debian/tests are not meant to run at building time but once sympow is installed; they are CI tests. I am considering to write a test script for checking at building in view to migrate to autotools.

Right, `DESTDIR` was a leftover from the old way to package sympow. Using `PREFIX` instead fixes the issue.

Thank you.

What is the difference between `/var/cache/sympow` and `~/.sympow`? When is which one used? Is it possible to disable the global cache in favor of the user one? The readme talks about "precomputed" for `/var` and "user computed" for `~/.sympow`. Does that mean runtime write access to `VARPREFIX` is not actually necessary?

/var/cache/sympow/datafiles/ goes in pair with /usr/share/sympow/datafiles/ :
1] /usr/share/sympow/datafiles/ contains data files in clear which are assumed to be manage at the superuser scale (basically a set of precomputed data installed at installation time);
2] /var/cache/sympow/datafiles/le64 contains the associated binaries (which are architecture dependent) that are not distributed but computed on the fly when necessary by the first user.


~/.sympow/datafiles/ will contain data files (clear versions and binaries) generated by USER when the clear version whenever the clear version is not readable in  /usr/share/sympow/datafiles/ .
Behind this, there is a community policy: we can reuse data computed by other users.

The data in HOME/.sympow are autoritative over the one system-wide ones,
and The data in SYMPOW_CACHEDIR and SYMPOW_CACHEDIR/sympow are authoritative
over the ones in HOME/.sympow . Nothing special here from a UNIX user point of view.

My aim was to keep the spirit of the original version. Some data were distributed to avoid the user some maneuvers and to wait a while (at this glorious time, computers were extremely slow and the users have to run GP themselves: thanks to Intel and its competitors and to my patches, this time is over and we can now enjoy the full power of SYMPOW).

You can find the job and a script to generate jobs in the material provided by Debian. These data are computed at packaging time, somehow it is also a `check'.

Having said that, it is okay to distributed no precomputed data.

My point is that some examples or tests in the literature may depend on the historical data,

I strongly suggest to distribute the historical precomputed data (and the Sage ones).

Dependant on the exact CPU model or just x86/aarch, 32/64 bits?

If I read the debian post install scripts correctly, doesn't everybody just have r+w access to the /var/cache directory?


> Having said that, it is okay to distributed no precomputed data.


I'm not having any problems with the /usr/share precomputed data. What isn't ideal is that the user needs runtime write-access to the /var/cache directory.


> I strongly suggest to distribute the historical precomputed data (and the Sage ones).


So basically running `sympow -new_data` with all the arguments listed in debians `precomputed_data-lisof_parameter.data`? It looks like the debian package still calls gp manually. So that'd be

```
for data in 1d0 2 2d0h 3d0 3d1 4; do
	sympow -new_data "$data"
done
```

But that tries to access HOME/.sympow. So you're generating user-level cache files at install time?

Even after deleting that, sympow still gives a warning about not being able to write to /var/cache/sympow.

yes but just to write the binary data, which the binary version of the clean data:
1] so whoever write it, the output must be the same ;
2] any USER can bypass them by writting their own clean file in HOME/.sympow 
3] any USER can remove them;
4] if faulty binary are set, we can trace back the faulty USER ;
5] the superuser can create a specific group.

He does not: he will get a warning message, but sympow will continue.
The USER can pass the -quiet option to silence the warnings.
No warning will not be ideal: the user must be aware if the set up is not correct.

There is no such file but a script in debian/adhoc/job which is called at packaging time 
and which complete the original armd.sh . I could merge them, but I will not because it will touch
the math part (what I want to avoid).


 It looks like the debian package still calls gp manually. So that'd be

But it is not.


A debian centric patch is applies to add the extra data: debain/patches/debianization.patch 
At packaging time, besides the original script armd.sh , the script debian/adhoc/job/sympow-new_data.job  is launched : those scripts call gp (and not sympow).

so it is a warning (an not an ERROR message followed but an exit(-1)): I would consider it as a feature but not as a bug.
In fact, a couple of checks are performed to detect a corrupted folder set up and avoid surprises . 


The bug is in the installation process:
the correct privileges must be encoded in Configure : I will try to fix this the next week-end .
And in the README.md file: I should document better this part.

For now, to silent this warning, just set the right privilege or pass the option  -quiet : no will be write if /usr/share/sympow/datafiles is empty .

Let me know if you think that a mechanism must be implemented to avoid this warning message.

So would it be reasonable to pre-compute and distribute all the /var/cache data?

And then sympow will fall back to `~/.sympow` and behave exactly as usual?

So what does the debian version do differntly?

Does that mean I should use the debian scripts if I want to distribute the cached binaries?

I would disagree. If I understand correctly the shared cache is only really useful in the nowadays nieche case where a lot of users use the same sympow instance on one PC. And even then it will not have a huge impact because computing power is usually sufficient. Not having the shared state makes things easier to reason about and in general global state is annoying to deal with for packaging.

What do you mean by that?

Does `-quiet` have any other effects besides surpressing that message?

> Let me know if you think that a mechanism must be implemented to avoid this warning message.


To make my motivations mroe clear: In nix, every package lives in an immutable subfolder of /nix/store after installation. The name of that subfolder contains a hash describing the recipe used to build the package and all its dependencies. That has a lot of advantages. Two relevant examples:

- packages can be installed with user privileges. That is because installing a package only downlaods a couple of archives and unpacks that at /nix/store. It does not in any way affect other users. The issue with /var here is that we'd need superuser privileges at install time. Also nix doesn't even have the concept of install time scripts, so I'd have to do some ugly hack like creating a wrapper for sympow that sets up the /var folder on first use.

- multiple versions of a package can be installed side-by-side. For example different users may have different versions of sympow. Again, global state is difficult in this situation.

So if it is not strictly necessary, I'd like to either

- avoid the global cache and use the user cache instead or

- pre-populate the cache at build time. The cache dir would then be read-only at runtime.

It sounds like currently I can kind of do the first option by writing a wrapper for sympow that always passes the `-quiet` option. Of course it would be nicer to just disable the shared state through a ./Configure option and even nicer to use option two instead.

Am I misunderstanding this?

Thank you again for not only taking the time to improve the state of the singular package, but also patiently explaining the details to me :)

That is the only blocking issue, but it would still be better to be able to pre-compute the global cache at build time instead of lazily computing it at runtime. You didn't respond to all of my questions, which is understandable considering what a monster of message that was. So I'll summarize:

- does sympow without a global cache behave exatly as usual, just computing the cache per-user instead?
- if the debian/adhoc/job file to pre-compute some data is recommended, I would prefer if you would include it in sympow proper. However I understand your reservations about touching the math.

> ((Is it that hard to read C source file ?))


Honestly yes, the sympow code is very hard to read for me. Its a mix of very non-standard formatting, a lack of comments and my limited C and domain knowledge. That is why I'm glad that you have taken up the maintenance.

I'll try a `-quiet` wrapper for now.

No for security reasons: those files are binary files: for security matter you want to avoid to distribute binary files. Anyway, their computation time is very short: the hard part is contained in the corresponding clear data.

Yes.

I would forget it and spend my time else where.

I plan to change the verbosity level of this message (once I have time before me).

I don't understand what you mean. The `sympow` binary is also a distributed binary file. The data would be computed in the build script just as the executables would be. Any user could verify that by building it themselves.

Well it seems to break sages parsing, so I'll need to add that wrapper. After that sages tests still fail. I'm now trying to update sages spkg first to find out if thats a quirk with nix's build system or a parsing issue.
However while packaging the spkg I've hit another issue: the `./Configure` script now relies on autotools to generate the endian tuple. autotools apparently is an "experimental" package that currently isn't included in the sage distribution by default. I would replace it by this python script:

```
import sys
import platform

if sys.byteorder == "little":
    endian = "le"
else:
    endian = "be"

bits = platform.architecture()[0][:-3]

# for example "le64" or "be32"
print(endian + bits)
```

Is that correct?

the data are stored as binary, so the data binary file can be detected as an arbitrary binary file,
namely as a suspicious file.

On my box:

$ file ~/.sympow/datafiles/le64/P014M.bin

gives

$ /home/jgmb/.sympow/datafiles/le64/P014M.bin: data

For any regular binary files, file(1) should be able to identified.

This is indeed an issue.

Why is a binary data file any more suspicious than a binary executable?

A binary executable is recognized as such by file(1): so it recognisable as such.

Why does that matter? I don't understand why an executable that is recognized as such is any less suspicious or security relevant than a binary data file. The executable is arguably more security relevant.

In version 2.023.6, the autotools dependency was discarded: the endianess is now determine via a C program. Please check it on exotic architectures if you can, and let me know if any issue arises.

If sage-the-distribution still supports multi-user installs, that location will generally not be writable. The default of `$HOME/.sympow` is probably the best you can do. And given that this is binary data and the quality of the code, I'm not sure that it's wise to share the cache among a "sympow" group anywhere else. So FWIW I would leave it at the default.

<a id='comment:117'></a>Replying to [comment:116 mkoeppe]:
> I see many test failures in sagelib that seem related to `sympow` in `fedora-32-standard` (https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/867731204) -- where `sympow` comes from the system after #29673!


I have opened #30147 (Fix `spkg-configure.m4` for `sympow`) for this.

The present ticket is ready for review.
