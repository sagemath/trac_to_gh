The patch applies to sage-3.1.1

Consider a little test:

```
sage: M=MatrixSpace(GF(2),10000,10000).random_element()
sage: M.set_immutable()
sage: time M.__hash__()
```
Without the patch, i had to interrupt sage after few *__minutes__* since it ate pretty much of my computer's memory. 

With the patch, we get

```
sage: time M.__hash__()
CPU times: user 0.00 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.00 s
Wall time: 0.00 s
-2570088162955604276
```

Well done, Martin! I give a positive review.

The patch contains a doc-test. One problem for me: Typing `M.__hash__?`, i don't see them. What is the user supposed to do in order to see the doc-string of the respective hash method?

I know that the following should be another ticket. But here are two items on my wish list:
1. Can similar things be done with the hash of matrices over GF(p), p>2?
2. Please also improve pickling of matrices! Example:
 {{{
sage: M=MatrixSpace(GF(2),1000,1000).random_element()
sage: timeit('x=loads(dumps(M))')
5 loops, best of 3: 2.33 s per loop
 }}}
 which is somehow slowish.

Simon,

please open a thread on sage-devel. I assume the discussion will conclude that speed up is warranted and then we can open tickets for the new issues.

Yes it can, please open a Trac ticket and I'll do it as soon as I find some time.

That is #3324 which is blocked by a problem on OSX 10.4 and libpng.

<a id='comment:7'></a>
Sorry, but i think i should re-open the ticket:

```
sage: M = MatrixSpace(GF(2),10000,10000).random_element()
sage: M.is_mutable()
True
sage: M.__hash__()
354973654957594997
```

A mutable object is not allowed to have a hash, AFAIK. 
On the other hand, the hash-value seems not to be cached:

```
sage: M[0,0]
1
sage: M[0,0]=0
sage: M.__hash__()
-8868398381897180811
```

So, the hash value has changed (i.e., was re-computed) by changing the matrix...

```
sage: N=copy(M)
sage: N.__hash__()
-8868398381897180811
```
... and has not changed by copying the matrix.

By consequence, it may be that everything is alright.

However, I re-open the ticket, because I think this should be addressed -- either by a new patch raising an exception when `M` is mutable, or by the assertion that "mutable objects have no hash" is a rule but no law, and that it is fine since the hash is not cached.

Cheers
     Simon
