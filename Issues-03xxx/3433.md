This is a major efficiency problem with large notebooks.  The fix is to write custom worksheet `__reduce__` and load methods that do not store the actual worksheet text in the object, but instead store it to disk and read it from disk.  That reading from disk should only happen when the worksheet is actually "activated", i.e., not when unpickling!
