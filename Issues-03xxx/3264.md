This would be quite helpful for getting SAGE into Debian (since the polybori-0.4 package is the first version that satisfies Debian python policy).

Hi Tim,

thanks for doing this, but I am curious about a couple things.

* The repo is in an inconsitent state:

```
polybori-0.5rc$ hg status
! patches/CCuddCore.h
! patches/CCuddCore.h-diff.patch
! patches/SConstruct
! patches/SConstruct.cygwin
! patches/SConstruct.cygwin.patch
? patches/PyPolyBoRi.py.orig
? patches/PyPolyBori.patch
? patches/SConstruct.orig
? patches/SConstruct.patch
```
* The workaround at the end of spkg-install should have been removed:

```
# linking dynmic libraries causes segfaults at exit (see #2822)
if [ `uname` = "Darwin" ]; then
    rm -f $SAGE_LOCAL/lib/libpolybori.dylib
    rm -f $SAGE_LOCAL/lib/libpboriCudd.dylib
    rm -f $SAGE_LOCAL/lib/libgroebner.dylib
else
    rm -f $SAGE_LOCAL/lib/libpolybori.so
    rm -f $SAGE_LOCAL/lib/libpboriCudd.so
    rm -f $SAGE_LOCAL/lib/libgroebner.so 
fi
```
* patches/SConstruct is missing, but in spkg-install you copy it over:

```
cp patches/SConstruct src/${PBDIR}/SConstruct
```
* There seems to be some inconsitency between between PyPolyBori.patch, ./patches/PyPolyBoRi.py and ./src/polybori-0.5rc/pyroot/polybori/PyPolyBoRi.py
* You removed an OSX 10.4 workaround (the removed the "-s" from LINKFLAGS below in SConstruct) that breaks compilation there and is a must fix we must have in our tree:

```
opts.Add('LINKFLAGS', "Linker flags", ['-s'], converter = Split)
opts.Add('LIBS', 'custom libraries needed for build', [], converter = Split)
```

Cheers,

Michael

I agree on that workaround.  

I'm a bit confused as to what happened to patches/SConstruct (which is supposed to be the OS X 10.4 fix).  It's easy to regenerate from SConstruct.patch and the actual SConstruct file.  I'm a bit puzzled by PyPolyBoRi.py not being what I recall as well.

I'm also confused regarding what happened with the repository.  I've posted a new version in the same place that should have none of these problems.

I think the patch is sage is likely wrong, however; I get

```
ImportError: /usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/sage/rings/polynomial/pbori.so: undefined symbol: _Z20m4ri_build_all_codesv
```
when I try to run SAGE with this patch in my Debian build (this was masked before by a flint problem).

I observe that devel/sage-main/build/temp.linux-i686-2.5/sage/rings/polynomial/pbori.o contains references to _Z20m4ri_build_all_codesv, but devel/sage/sage/rings/polynomial/pbori.cpp refers to m4ri_build_all_codes (as do the .pyx files).  But this rewriting doesn't happen with the very similar m4ri_build_all_codes and m4ri_destroy_all_codes code in sage/sage/matrix/matrix_mod2_dense.c.

The only clear difference I can see here is that the pbori stuff is c++ based...

I will take a look in a minute and do some build testing, followed by valgrinding to see if the dynamic lib problem has been fixed.

We upgraded to a new m4ri version recently. IIRC PolyBoRi 0.5 is supposed to switch from its own static m4ri to using a shared one if so configured, so Sage's m4ri might get in the way here. But it might also be a C vs. C++ problem that might be fixed via some extern "C" sprinkled in the m4ri headers in case they are missing.

Cheers,

Michael

After thinking about this some more time, I came to the conclusion, that
* future versions of M4RI will have the extern "C" guard in m4ri.h
* the easiest fix is to add the guard to `pb_wrap.h` in clib.

Since the current spkg for 0.5 is broken, I won't provide the fix just now:

```

```

but here is what needs to be added to pb_wrap.h

```
// M4RI
#define PACKED 1
#ifdef __cplusplus
extern "C" {
#include "M4RI/m4ri.h"
}
#else
#include "M4RI/m4ri.h"
#endif
```

which replaces

```
// M4RI
#define PACKED 1
#include "M4RI/packedmatrix.h"
#include "M4RI/grayflex.h"
```

What is the `#define PACKED 1` for btw.?

This change does seem to resolve the problems I was having with my Debian build.

The failure you're seeing with polybori-0.5rc.spkg is just a line that needs to be changed from 
"polybori-0.3" to "polybori-0.5rc" in spkg-install (I've posted a new version in my sage.math).

But after I make that change, I get compilation failures trying to build the polybori spkg in a stock 3.0.5 Sage install using gcc-4.3.  So, we're not done yet.

I have backported the changes into 

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mabshoff/release-cycles-3.1.2/rc0/polybori-0.5rc.p2.spkg

It passes build tests on 

* linux x86-64 and Itanium
* 32 and 64 bit OSX 10.5 (but the 10.4 fix is in the spkg)
* Solaris

The patch looks good to me and passes doctests. In total: positive review.

Cheers,

Michael
