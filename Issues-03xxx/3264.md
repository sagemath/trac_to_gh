This would be quite helpful for getting SAGE into Debian (since the polybori-0.4 package is the first version that satisfies Debian python policy).

Hi Tim,

thanks for doing this, but I am curious about a couple things.

* The repo is in an inconsitent state:

```
polybori-0.5rc$ hg status
! patches/CCuddCore.h
! patches/CCuddCore.h-diff.patch
! patches/SConstruct
! patches/SConstruct.cygwin
! patches/SConstruct.cygwin.patch
? patches/PyPolyBoRi.py.orig
? patches/PyPolyBori.patch
? patches/SConstruct.orig
? patches/SConstruct.patch
```
* The workaround at the end of spkg-install should have been removed:

```
# linking dynmic libraries causes segfaults at exit (see #2822)
if [ `uname` = "Darwin" ]; then
    rm -f $SAGE_LOCAL/lib/libpolybori.dylib
    rm -f $SAGE_LOCAL/lib/libpboriCudd.dylib
    rm -f $SAGE_LOCAL/lib/libgroebner.dylib
else
    rm -f $SAGE_LOCAL/lib/libpolybori.so
    rm -f $SAGE_LOCAL/lib/libpboriCudd.so
    rm -f $SAGE_LOCAL/lib/libgroebner.so 
fi
```
* patches/SConstruct is missing, but in spkg-install you copy it over:

```
cp patches/SConstruct src/${PBDIR}/SConstruct
```
* There seems to be some inconsitency between between PyPolyBori.patch, ./patches/PyPolyBoRi.py and ./src/polybori-0.5rc/pyroot/polybori/PyPolyBoRi.py
* You removed an OSX 10.4 workaround (the removed the "-s" from LINKFLAGS below in SConstruct) that breaks compilation there and is a must fix we must have in our tree:

```
opts.Add('LINKFLAGS', "Linker flags", ['-s'], converter = Split)
opts.Add('LIBS', 'custom libraries needed for build', [], converter = Split)
```

Cheers,

Michael

I agree on that workaround.  

I'm a bit confused as to what happened to patches/SConstruct (which is supposed to be the OS X 10.4 fix).  It's easy to regenerate from SConstruct.patch and the actual SConstruct file.  I'm a bit puzzled by PyPolyBoRi.py not being what I recall as well.

I'm also confused regarding what happened with the repository.  I've posted a new version in the same place that should have none of these problems.

I think the patch is sage is likely wrong, however; I get

```
ImportError: /usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/sage/rings/polynomial/pbori.so: undefined symbol: _Z20m4ri_build_all_codesv
```
when I try to run SAGE with this patch in my Debian build (this was masked before by a flint problem).

I observe that devel/sage-main/build/temp.linux-i686-2.5/sage/rings/polynomial/pbori.o contains references to _Z20m4ri_build_all_codesv, but devel/sage/sage/rings/polynomial/pbori.cpp refers to m4ri_build_all_codes (as do the .pyx files).  But this rewriting doesn't happen with the very similar m4ri_build_all_codes and m4ri_destroy_all_codes code in sage/sage/matrix/matrix_mod2_dense.c.

The only clear difference I can see here is that the pbori stuff is c++ based...

I will take a look in a minute and do some build testing, followed by valgrinding to see if the dynamic lib problem has been fixed.

We upgraded to a new m4ri version recently. IIRC PolyBoRi 0.5 is supposed to switch from its own static m4ri to using a shared one if so configured, so Sage's m4ri might get in the way here. But it might also be a C vs. C++ problem that might be fixed via some extern "C" sprinkled in the m4ri headers in case they are missing.

Cheers,

Michael

Hi Tim, Martin, Michael, Alexander,

the problem is that m4ri is now build as a C library in PolyBoRi. This requires that the m4ri header has some extern "C" header guards, which Martin will add in a new point release of m4ri. We will also attempt to make PolyBoRi use Sage's libm4ri instead of using its own copy, but I hope we can get that done in time for the freeze.

Cheers,

Michael

After thinking about this some more time, I came to the conclusion, that
* future versions of M4RI will have the extern "C" guard in m4ri.h
* the easiest fix is to add the guard to `pb_wrap.h` in clib.

Since the current spkg for 0.5 is broken, I won't provide the fix just now:

```

```

but here is what needs to be added to pb_wrap.h

```
// M4RI
#define PACKED 1
#ifdef __cplusplus
extern "C" {
#include "M4RI/m4ri.h"
}
#else
#include "M4RI/m4ri.h"
#endif
```

which replaces

```
// M4RI
#define PACKED 1
#include "M4RI/packedmatrix.h"
#include "M4RI/grayflex.h"
```

What is the `#define PACKED 1` for btw.?

This change does seem to resolve the problems I was having with my Debian build.

The failure you're seeing with polybori-0.5rc.spkg is just a line that needs to be changed from 
"polybori-0.3" to "polybori-0.5rc" in spkg-install (I've posted a new version in my sage.math).

But after I make that change, I get compilation failures trying to build the polybori spkg in a stock 3.0.5 Sage install using gcc-4.3.  So, we're not done yet.

I have backported the changes into 

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mabshoff/release-cycles-3.1.2/rc0/polybori-0.5rc.p2.spkg

It passes build tests on 

* linux x86-64 and Itanium
* 32 and 64 bit OSX 10.5 (but the 10.4 fix is in the spkg)
* Solaris

The patch looks good to me and passes doctests. In total: positive review.

Cheers,

Michael
