Nils Bruin reports:

"I ran into the following problem in sage, and I suspect it might be your code:

```
sage: EllipticCurve([0,0,0,-193^2,0]).sha().an()
[...]
NameError: global name 'misc' is not defined
```
Was this tested at all?"

It's a problem in L_ratio().

```
sage: EllipticCurve([0,0,0,-193^2,0]).sha().an()
