Instead of patching polymake each time cddlib changes you should use the following construct:

```
spkg/standard$ ./newest_version cddlib
cddlib-094b.p2
```
That way it keeps working ;)

Cheers,

Michael

The same applies to the gmp, too. Either way, the polymake spkg-install is a mess. In fact the polymake.spkg violates a copious amount of other rules. So while I am at it I might as well update the the polymake 2.3 release.

Thoughts?

Cheers,

Michael

#3640 will shortly have a working polymake.spkg, so I am closing this as a duplicate.
