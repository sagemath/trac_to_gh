I fully agree that this is a bug.

Incidentally I wrote the LCM function a while before I implemented vectors,
so I think when I wrote those docs "vector" and "list" were the same
thing in my mind.  

The fix should be to change the docs to replace "vector" by any itterable.
Then the LCM code should iterate over the object calling LCM 
if it doesn't have an LCM method.   

Probably similar fixes need to be made for GCD.

Both attachments fix that problem. Btw, I wonder why integer=True is not the default,
at least for integer inputs. I guess there are many calls to gcd with integers in the
Sage library without Integer=True:

```
bash-3.00$ pwd
/usr/local/sage-3.1.4/sage/devel/sage/sage
bash-3.00$ find . -type f -name "*.py" -exec grep \-iw GCD {} \; | wc -l

My patch applies `_instead_` of the previous two.  It implements Paul's suggested behaviour.

There's one problem left (I tested all of sage.rings and had to make one change in the multiploynomial polynomial code which actually used the integers=True flag which is now redundant).  But:

```
sage: P.<x,y,z> = ZZ[]
sage: gcd(2*(x+y),3*y)
2
```
which of course should give 1.  This leads to one doctest failure, but I cannot track it down at the moment.

I (or someone) should also doctest all the rest of Sage as there are ceratinly places where gcd/lcm are used outside of sage/rings.

The second patch does three things:

1. After running -testall a couple of small things elsewhere needed fixing;
2. Fixed a bug in integer.pyx introduced in 3.1.2.alpha0 (in #4286)
3. Cleaner use of sequences as a method of coercing a list to have a coherent universe.

In view of item 2, which corrected this:

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
| SAGE Version 3.2.alpha0, Release Date: 2008-10-20                  |
| Type notebook() for the GUI, and license() for information.        |
----------------------------------------------------------------------

sage: sage.rings.integer.GCD_list([2,2,3])
2
```
and the fact that I really did do a -testall, I am hoping for a quick positive review!  I think that Paul Z is eligible to do that although the initial patches here were his.

Hi,

positive review for the "integer.pyx" corrections in "sage-trac_3118-2.patch", which heal two issues introduced in #4286.
(One horrible bug with a new doctest to show it is fixed now, and one for beauty: make the gcd of a list consisting of one single negative number be a positive number, so that all resulting integers of a gcd calculation are non-negative now --- as long as this holds for the underlying GMP algorithm used.)
