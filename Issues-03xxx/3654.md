IIRC warn prints to stderr, so we are not catching the output. This seems similar to Burcin's code:

```
def MPolynomialRing(*args, **kwds):
    import warnings
    warnings.warn("MPolynomialRing is deprecated, use PolynomialRing instead!", DeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2)
    return PolynomialRing(*args, **kwds)
```
The above should certainly use some more generic infrastructure like the one provided by Jason's patch.

Cheers,

Michael
