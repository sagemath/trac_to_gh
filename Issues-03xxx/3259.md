I forgot to note this, but because flint doesn't have a static library, we only need to build it with -fPIC, which is accomplished by setting MAKECMDGOALS=library

I had forgotten about flint. Easy to do as my gentoo patch
is a one liner sed command to add a soname. 

The patch to the makefile looks good to me, I won't comment 
on the debian package rules. The makefile already use -fpic,
do you have to overrule that in debian?
