<div id="comment:0"></div>

There is an example in sage.calculus.wester starting like this:

```
sage: # (YES) Expand (1+x)^20, take derivative and factorize. 
```
The ensuing calculation involves no derivatives, just expanding and factoring (1+x)^20.

The patch adds in some derivative calculations.



Component: **calculus**

Keywords: **wester**
