There is an example in sage.calculus.wester starting like this:

```
sage: # (YES) Expand (1+x)^20, take derivative and factorize. 
```
The ensuing calculation involves no derivatives, just expanding and factoring (1+x)^20.

The patch adds in some derivative calculations.

I'm not sure why there are two patches here; when submitting the second one, I must have forgotten to check the box about replacing patches with the same name.  Ignore the first patch.
