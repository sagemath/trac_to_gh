    I was wondering if you'd be
    willing to release your code under a GPL compatible license so that we
    can include it with Sage to do regression testing with every release.


Certainly.

If you believe that

 This work written by Andrew Dalke and released into the public domain
 in 2008.  No copyright protection is asserted.

is sufficient then there you go.  Else

 liable for any damages arising from the use of this software.

I honestly think that the code needs enough modifications to be usable in SAGE or another tool that nothing of my code will remain.

Now if had access to the code I wrote for a client, that would be much cooler.  It saved the imports to a format that kcachegrind could visualize.  :)

Cheers,
