There was a silly typo in `sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/lseries_ell.py` that caused the following:

```
sage: EllipticCurve('37a').lseries().deriv_at1()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
<type 'exceptions.NameError'>             Traceback (most recent call last)

/Users/craigcitro/<ipython console> in <module>()

/sage/local/lib/python2.5/site-packages/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/lseries_ell
.py in deriv_at1(self, k)
    463         k = int(k)
    464         sqrtN = float(self.__E.conductor().sqrt())
--> 465         if k == 0: k = int(math.ceil(sqrtN))
    466         an = self.__E.anlist(k)           # list of C ints
    467         # Compute z = e^(-2pi/sqrt(N))

<type 'exceptions.NameError'>: global name 'math' is not defined
```

This was just a simple issue where ceil wasn't getting imported. Patch is the obvious fix, and adds a doctest that would have caught this.
