```
There is a performance bug that causes a fairly large performance drop on
all architectures.  This bug is present in both ATLAS 3.8.0 and 3.8.1.
The explanation and fix is available at:
   http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/errata.html#JITcpBug

The errata says specifically:

```
Bad GEMM call causes performance drop for all architectures
A piece of duplicated code causes a special-case code to be used 
for all GEMM problems, which reduces performance on all architectures 
and almost all problems. To fix, comment out (or delete) lines 191-194 
of ATLAS/src/blas/gemm/ATL_gemmXX.c, which read:

         {
            mm2 = mm1;
            mm1 = Mjoin(PATL,mmJITcp);
         }

(notice these 4 lines are a duplicate of the for lines above. 
```

Cheers,

Michael
