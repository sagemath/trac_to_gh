Do 

```
sage: dsage.setup()
```
and take all the defaults, then do it again immediately but enter a non-default hostname.
BOOM!
See http://sage.pastebin.com/m1ff54979 for a log of this. 

The error involves sqlalchemy table insertion; somebody messed up:

```
    739         if not self.non_primary and '_class_state' in self.class_.__dict__ and (self.entity_name in self.class_._class_state.mappers):
--> 740              raise exceptions.ArgumentError("Class '%s' already has a primary mapper defined with entity name '%s'.  Use non_primary=True to create a non primary Mapper.  clear_mappers() will remove *all* current mappers from all classes." % (self.class_, self.entity_name))
    741 
    742         def extra_init(class_, oldinit, instance, args, kwargs):

ArgumentError: Class '<class 'sage.dsage.database.job.Job'>' already has a primary mapper defined with entity name 'None'.  Use non_primary=True to create a non primary Mapper.  clear_mappers() will remove *all* current mappers from all classes.
