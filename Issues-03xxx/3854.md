Too many controls results in output truncated errors, but it's the length of the generated html that's tripping the warning... this should be trivial, just add "<!--notruncate-->" to the generated html.

As is the patch does not apply:

```
mabshoff@sage:/scratch/mabshoff/release-cycle/sage-3.1.2.alpha1/devel/sage$ patch -p1 --dry-run < trac_3854_sage.patch 
patching file sage/server/notebook/interact.py
Hunk #1 FAILED at 1397.
1 out of 1 hunk FAILED -- saving rejects to file sage/server/notebook/interact.py.rej
```
It should be trivial to rebase.

Cheers,

For the future: please make dependencies between tickets clear. This ticket should have been applied after #3823. We ended up applying them in reverse order and had to rebase them each because the order was inverse.

Please also name the patches properly, i.e. trac_XXXX_description is that is expected.
