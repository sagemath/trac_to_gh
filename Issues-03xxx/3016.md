Edit Area is one of several javascript code editors.  Here is a simple (*very* simple) spkg which installs the necessary files in sage/data/extcode/notebook/javascript/edit_area/ and also a patch to enable the functionality.

The patch currently only enables the toggle switch (between new editor and old functionality) for the first cell (the input_cell_0 cell).  That should be enough to evaluate it, though.

**Assignee:** boothby

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/3016

Hi Jason,

instead of an spkg it would be customary to add the code directly to the extcode repo. What is the license of the code? The notebook code is supposed to be BSD since other projects might be able to pick it up that way.

If you want discussion of something like this you should mention it on sage-devel since trac is certainly the wrong place to discuss this and few people will find the ticket without it being mentioned on sage-devel.

Cheers,

Michael

Thanks for the pointers, though.

This should be brought up as a thread on sage-devel.
