10:49 < cwitty> wstein: You should put a file in Sage with all your code samples from your number theory book as 
                doctests.
10:49 < cwitty> Then we can't accidentally break your book.
10:49 < wstein> cwitty -- great idea.
10:49 < wstein> i'll make a ticket.
```

Same comments about my modular forms book.

<div id="comment:2" align="right">Comment 2</div>

The attached patch creates two new files in the sage/tests/ directory.  

* book_stein_modform.py -- all examples in my AMS Modular Forms book.

* book_stein_ent.py -- all examples in my new Springer Elementary Number Theory Book

This adds about 736 new lines of input examples to the Sage doctest suite, and adds about 45 seconds more time to doctesting.
