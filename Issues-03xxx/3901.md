10:49 < cwitty> wstein: You should put a file in Sage with all your code samples from your number theory book as 
                doctests.
10:49 < cwitty> Then we can't accidentally break your book.
10:49 < wstein> cwitty -- great idea.
10:49 < wstein> i'll make a ticket.
```

Same comments about my modular forms book.

The attached patch creates two new files in the sage/tests/ directory.  

* book_stein_modform.py -- all examples in my AMS Modular Forms book.

* book_stein_ent.py -- all examples in my new Springer Elementary Number Theory Book

This adds about 736 new lines of input examples to the Sage doctest suite, and adds about 45 seconds more time to doctesting.

Note that coverage of those files is "bad" since we cannot deal with the autogenerated files:

```
mabshoff@sage:/scratch/mabshoff/release-cycle/sage-3.2.alpha1$ ./sage -coverageall devel/sage/sage/tests/
benchmark.py: 76% (87 of 114)
book_stein_ent.py: 0% (0 of 119)
book_stein_modform.py: 0% (0 of 51)

Overall weighted coverage score:  30.5%
Total number of functions:  284
```

Cheers,

Michael
