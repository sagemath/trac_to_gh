Hi William:

I was running Sage 3.0.2 on Linux when the error occurred.  Just now i
upgraded to 'sage-3.0.6-i686-Linux-debian-intel' without problems, ran
the same code (in a notebook and on the command line), and got the
same error.  Hmm, i don't understand why Sage can do 'diff(f*SR(2),x)'
but not 'diff(f*SR(1),x)'.

This boils down to the fact that some symbolic objects take an extra argument in their `variables` method. It is unclear what the meaning of this argument is (couldn't find any examples) and if it should be removed, or added, to make things consistent. (I'd guess removed, but I don't want to break things.) 

Component: **calculus**
