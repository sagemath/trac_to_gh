This came up while reviewing #2898, which adds a conversion from float to ZZ (for integral values).  After applying that patch, you get:

```
sage: 1.0r/8
1/8
```

That's because of this code in coerce.pyx, which does a conversion rather than a coercion:

```
        elif PY_IS_NUMERIC(x):
            try:
                x = yp(x)
                if PY_TYPE_CHECK(yp, type): return x,y
```

I tried to fix this, but every time I fixed something it broke something else.  I'm going to attach my latest non-working patch, which may or may not be a useful place to start.

[Once this ticket has been reviewed and merged #2898 should be closed]

I've been playing around with this a bit, simplified your patch some, but one consequence is that 

```
sage: parent(RealField(100)(1.5) + float(1.5)) # good?
<type 'float'>
sage: RealField(100)(2^4000) == float('inf')   # bad?
True
```

Thoughts?

It also passes its own tests and the code looks good.

<a id='comment:8'></a>This patch causes a Heisenbug:

```

mabshoff@sage:/scratch/mabshoff/release-cycle/sage-3.1.3.alpha0$ ./sage -t -long devel/sage/sage/modular/modsym/ambient.py
sage -t -long devel/sage/sage/modular/modsym/ambient.py     

------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occured in SAGE.
This probably occured because a *compiled* component
of SAGE has a bug in it (typically accessing invalid memory)
or is not properly wrapped with _sig_on, _sig_off.
You might want to run SAGE under gdb with 'sage -gdb' to debug this.
SAGE will now terminate (sorry).
------------------------------------------------------------


A mysterious error (perphaps a memory error?) occurred, which may have crashed doctest.
         [4.6 s]
exit code: 768
```
It does not happen without "-long" and when running "-long -verbose" it also seems to pass. I guess it is time to valgrind :)

Cheers,

Michael
