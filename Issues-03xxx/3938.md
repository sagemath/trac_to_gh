This came up while reviewing #2898, which adds a conversion from float to ZZ (for integral values).  After applying that patch, you get:

```
sage: 1.0r/8
1/8
```

That's because of this code in coerce.pyx, which does a conversion rather than a coercion:

```
        elif PY_IS_NUMERIC(x):
            try:
                x = yp(x)
                if PY_TYPE_CHECK(yp, type): return x,y
```

I tried to fix this, but every time I fixed something it broke something else.  I'm going to attach my latest non-working patch, which may or may not be a useful place to start.

[Once this ticket has been reviewed and merged #2898 should be closed]

I've been playing around with this a bit, simplified your patch some, but one consequence is that 

```
sage: parent(RealField(100)(1.5) + float(1.5)) # good?
<type 'float'>
sage: RealField(100)(2^4000) == float('inf')   # bad?
True
```

Thoughts?

Both of these changes make float act more like RDF.  I've sometimes wished that comparison operators would coerce to more-precise types instead of less-precise, but that would be a huge change across big parts of Sage; unless such a policy change is made, I think that both consequences are actually good.

In that case it works and passes a good chunk of the test suite.  (I can't test the rest because of the interfaces/lisp.py failure)

It also passes its own tests and the code looks good.

This patch causes a Heisenbug:

```

mabshoff@sage:/scratch/mabshoff/release-cycle/sage-3.1.3.alpha0$ ./sage -t -long devel/sage/sage/modular/modsym/ambient.py
sage -t -long devel/sage/sage/modular/modsym/ambient.py     

------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occured in SAGE.
This probably occured because a *compiled* component
of SAGE has a bug in it (typically accessing invalid memory)
or is not properly wrapped with _sig_on, _sig_off.
You might want to run SAGE under gdb with 'sage -gdb' to debug this.
SAGE will now terminate (sorry).
------------------------------------------------------------


A mysterious error (perphaps a memory error?) occurred, which may have crashed doctest.
         [4.6 s]
exit code: 768
```
It does not happen without "-long" and when running "-long -verbose" it also seems to pass. I guess it is time to valgrind :)

Cheers,

Michael

Patch looks good. Thankfully, David folded everything into one patch. 

I have two minor issues, and after these are fixed, I'm happy to give this a positive review. 

* There are two long blocks (an `EXAMPLES` and a `TESTS`) that are not indented correctly. 

* There are three functions that are moved and one that is new which need doctests. (The moved functions don't necessarily have to have them added, but since it's three functions, it seems worth just adding doctests.)

Once these are done, I'm happy to give this a positive review.

One fix:

```
    TypeError: no cannonical coercion from Real Field with 53 bits of precision to Real Field with 100 bits of precision
```
needs to become

```
    TypeError: no canonical coercion from Real Field with 53 bits of precision to Real Field with 100 bits of precision
```

I am fixing that in the patch I am applying.

Cheers,
