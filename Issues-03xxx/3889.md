Number field element sqrt should support the extend parameter in analogy with other sqrt functions.

```
sage: ZZ(4).sqrt(extend=False)
2
sage: CyclotomicField(4)(4).sqrt(extend=False)
...
TypeError: sqrt() got an unexpected keyword argument 'extend'
```

If it would even have the parameter and raise a NotImplementedError if extend==True, that would aid in writing generic code for the present.

Many ways to solve it

1. Do not return symbolic as one can do `SR(my_stuff).sqrt()`

2. Add a `symbolic` argument

3. Make `extend` a three fold alternative
   - `extend=None`: old behavior
   - `extend=False`: return in the current number field or raise an error
   - `extend=True`: return in the current number field or an extended one if needed

Given a number field `K` with specified embedding into `AA`. How do I obtain a positive square root (i.e. the parent has a specified embedding as well).

It is very unnatural if it isn't well-defined if the volume is positive or negative.

Just move the volume answer to `AA`. A number field version can easily be reconstructed

This works for the volume of polyhedra now.

I did change the behaviour. The new default `None` is deprecated now and `extend=False` raises a `ValueError` to be consistent with other rings. The new default should then be `extend=True` once we remove the deprecation warning.

The `QR` method of method of matrices does not raise correctly a `TypeError`, if the base ring does not support the required roots. (Before it would sometimes implicitly extend even though the documentation tells us that the base ring must support roots.)

`extend=False` should just throw an error (if extension is needed) and don't do something weird like changing to symbolic ring.

To do `elt.sqrt(extend=False)` is correct behaviour and it should just raise and error, like with other rings. Also `extend=False` is a bad default, because it is not the default for `functions.other.sqrt`.

The idea of this default deprecation message is that users code needs to be updated and this is how you notify them, isn't it?

<div id="comment:38" align="right">Comment 38</div>

I removed the deprecation warning. The main problem is that `functions.other.sqrt` calls the method `sqrt` without optional arguments and claims that the default is to extend.

In this way it requires:
- that any `sqrt` method must extend by default without deprecation warning etc,
- any `sqrt` method does have an `extend` argument.

If we want to keep the deprecation message we need to alter `functions.other.sqrt`.

Feel free to reject my changes alltogether or change anything you like. I just joined in because there was trouble with polyhedra.

I am not sure what this `sqrt` method is trying to achieve. Giving an answer is not a necessity. Especially if the answer is "the square root of your number". Currently, I find that only the `extend=False` looks reasonable.

I see several problems
- `QQ` is a particular case of number fields, and `ZZ` is a particular case of `QQ`. For both `ZZ` and `QQ` the behavior of `sqrt` should be compatible with what is proposed for number fields.
- The proposal is not compatible with embeddings. Many users would expect `K(2).sqrt() + K(3).sqrt()` to work. Especially with `K=QQ`.
