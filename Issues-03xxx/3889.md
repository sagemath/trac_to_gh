Number field element sqrt should support the extend parameter in analogy with other sqrt functions.

```
sage: ZZ(4).sqrt(extend=False)
2
sage: CyclotomicField(4)(4).sqrt(extend=False)
...
TypeError: sqrt() got an unexpected keyword argument 'extend'
```

If it would even have the parameter and raise a NotImplementedError if extend==True, that would aid in writing generic code for the present.

The specicifications does not match the following behavior

```
sage: CyclotomicField(4)(2).sqrt(extend=False)
sqrt(2)
```
Of course, this is no due to your changes, but this function is just wrong in returning symbolic ring stuff without notice.

Many ways to solve it

1. Do not return symbolic as one can do `SR(my_stuff).sqrt()`

2. Add a `symbolic` argument

3. Make `extend` a three fold alternative
   - `extend=None`: old behavior
   - `extend=False`: return in the current number field or raise an error
   - `extend=True`: return in the current number field or an extended one if needed

The problem I'm having with `src/sage/geometry/polyhedron.base.py` is the following:

Given a number field `K` with specified embedding into `AA`. How do I obtain a positive square root (i.e. the parent has a specified embedding as well).

It is very unnatural if it isn't well-defined if the volume is positive or negative.

Just move the volume answer to `AA`. A number field version can easily be reconstructed

This works for the volume of polyhedra now.

I did change the behaviour. The new default `None` is deprecated now and `extend=False` raises a `ValueError` to be consistent with other rings. The new default should then be `extend=True` once we remove the deprecation warning.

The `QR` method of method of matrices does not raise correctly a `TypeError`, if the base ring does not support the required roots. (Before it would sometimes implicitly extend even though the documentation tells us that the base ring must support roots.)

`extend=False` should just throw an error (if extension is needed) and don't do something weird like changing to symbolic ring.

To do `elt.sqrt(extend=False)` is correct behaviour and it should just raise and error, like with other rings. Also `extend=False` is a bad default, because it is not the default for `functions.other.sqrt`.

The idea of this default deprecation message is that users code needs to be updated and this is how you notify them, isn't it?

I removed the deprecation warning. The main problem is that `functions.other.sqrt` calls the method `sqrt` without optional arguments and claims that the default is to extend.

In this way it requires:
- that any `sqrt` method must extend by default without deprecation warning etc,
- any `sqrt` method does have an `extend` argument.

If we want to keep the deprecation message we need to alter `functions.other.sqrt`.

Feel free to reject my changes alltogether or change anything you like. I just joined in because there was trouble with polyhedra.

I am not sure what this `sqrt` method is trying to achieve. Giving an answer is not a necessity. Especially if the answer is "the square root of your number". Currently, I find that only the `extend=False` looks reasonable.

I see several problems
- `QQ` is a particular case of number fields, and `ZZ` is a particular case of `QQ`. For both `ZZ` and `QQ` the behavior of `sqrt` should be compatible with what is proposed for number fields.
- The proposal is not compatible with embeddings. Many users would expect `K(2).sqrt() + K(3).sqrt()` to work. Especially with `K=QQ`.
