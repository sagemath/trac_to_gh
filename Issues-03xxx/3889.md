Number field element sqrt should support the extend parameter in analogy with other sqrt functions.

```
sage: ZZ(4).sqrt(extend=False)
2
sage: CyclotomicField(4)(4).sqrt(extend=False)
...
TypeError: sqrt() got an unexpected keyword argument 'extend'
```

If it would even have the parameter and raise a NotImplementedError if extend==True, that would aid in writing generic code for the present.

Many ways to solve it

1. Do not return symbolic as one can do `SR(my_stuff).sqrt()`

2. Add a `symbolic` argument

3. Make `extend` a three fold alternative
   - `extend=None`: old behavior
   - `extend=False`: return in the current number field or raise an error
   - `extend=True`: return in the current number field or an extended one if needed

<a id='comment:35'></a>`extend=False` should just throw an error (if extension is needed) and don't do something weird like changing to symbolic ring.

To do `elt.sqrt(extend=False)` is correct behaviour and it should just raise and error, like with other rings. Also `extend=False` is a bad default, because it is not the default for `functions.other.sqrt`.

The idea of this default deprecation message is that users code needs to be updated and this is how you notify them, isn't it?

<a id='comment:38'></a>I removed the deprecation warning. The main problem is that `functions.other.sqrt` calls the method `sqrt` without optional arguments and claims that the default is to extend.

In this way it requires:
- that any `sqrt` method must extend by default without deprecation warning etc,
- any `sqrt` method does have an `extend` argument.

If we want to keep the deprecation message we need to alter `functions.other.sqrt`.

Feel free to reject my changes alltogether or change anything you like. I just joined in because there was trouble with polyhedra.
