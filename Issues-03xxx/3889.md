Number field element sqrt should support the extend parameter in analogy with other sqrt functions.

```
sage: ZZ(4).sqrt(extend=False)
2
sage: CyclotomicField(4)(4).sqrt(extend=False)
...
TypeError: sqrt() got an unexpected keyword argument 'extend'
```

If it would even have the parameter and raise a NotImplementedError if extend==True, that would aid in writing generic code for the present.

Many ways to solve it

1. Do not return symbolic as one can do `SR(my_stuff).sqrt()`

2. Add a `symbolic` argument

3. Make `extend` a three fold alternative
   - `extend=None`: old behavior
   - `extend=False`: return in the current number field or raise an error
   - `extend=True`: return in the current number field or an extended one if needed

<a id='comment:30'></a>This works for the volume of polyhedra now.

I did change the behaviour. The new default `None` is deprecated now and `extend=False` raises a `ValueError` to be consistent with other rings. The new default should then be `extend=True` once we remove the deprecation warning.

The `QR` method of method of matrices does not raise correctly a `TypeError`, if the base ring does not support the required roots. (Before it would sometimes implicitly extend even though the documentation tells us that the base ring must support roots.)

To do `elt.sqrt(extend=False)` is correct behaviour and it should just raise and error, like with other rings. Also `extend=False` is a bad default, because it is not the default for `functions.other.sqrt`.

The idea of this default deprecation message is that users code needs to be updated and this is how you notify them, isn't it?

<a id='comment:38'></a>I removed the deprecation warning. The main problem is that `functions.other.sqrt` calls the method `sqrt` without optional arguments and claims that the default is to extend.

In this way it requires:
- that any `sqrt` method must extend by default without deprecation warning etc,
- any `sqrt` method does have an `extend` argument.

If we want to keep the deprecation message we need to alter `functions.other.sqrt`.

Feel free to reject my changes alltogether or change anything you like. I just joined in because there was trouble with polyhedra.

<a id='comment:45'></a>Ok. This should now behave consistenly with `ZZ` and `QQ`.
If `self` is a square, just return the root.
If `self` is not a square, raise an error if `extend=False` and use symbolic ring if `extend=True` (default).

Of course one could argue, that this behavior isn't optimal and there are better choices for a square root construction (e.g. extend the number field), but it is really hard to guess what the user wants precisely (e.g. for polytopes volume, if we need to extend anyway, we might as well go to `AA`).
