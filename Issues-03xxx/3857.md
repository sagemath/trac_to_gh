For example 

```
sage: BinaryQF_reduced_representatives(-63)

[2*x^2 - x*y + 8*y^2,
 4*x^2 - x*y + 4*y^2,
 x^2 + x*y + 16*y^2,
 2*x^2 + x*y + 8*y^2,
 4*x^2 + x*y + 4*y^2,
 3*x^2 + 3*x*y + 6*y^2]
```

However, clearly:

```
4*x^2 - x*y + 4*y^2
```

isn't a reduced form.
BinaryQF_reduced_representatives is incorrectly classifying some forms.

The patch applies cleanly to 3.1.1 and doctests pass.

However, there are some things I really do not like about this implementation:

1. `self.reduce()` computes (if necessary) caches and returns the reduced form equivalent to self.  I would expect it to change self into the reduced form, and have a different function self.reduced_form() to do what this function does.

2. The function `is_reduced()` actually reduces self and tests if the result is the same as self.  This is potentially very expensive!  To test `is_reduced()` you should just test that the usual inequalities are satisfied.

3. The function `BinaryQF_reduced_representatives(D)` -- where the bug was -- proceeds in a way very different to what I have always done, with the outer loop being over b.  For a start you should only loop over b's of the same parity as D, not over all b's and then compute and test if `b^2-D` is a multiple of 4.  Then, this method requires factoring all those values of `(b^2-D)/4` to get possible a's -- another expensive and quite unnecessary set of computations.  Finally, the list is not sorted as I think it should be.

I would like to rewrite this function, but the current patch can be applied and a new ticket opened if anyone agrees with me.

I have submitted a new patch (superseding my first patch), re-implementing the BinaryQF_reduced_representatives method, and addressing your point 3.

I agree the other points need fixing but feel they should have their own ticket, or at least separate patches.

Here are some timings from the new method.

Old code:

```
sage: timeit("BinaryQF_reduced_representatives(-4004)")
5 loops, best of 3: 29.6 s per loop
```

New code:

```
sage: timeit("BinaryQF_reduced_representatives(-4004)")
5 loops, best of 3: 38.9 ms per loop
```

This should now have a new independent review -- as far as I am concerned it is ok!  

I'll now review the other patches you made in response to my first two points.

The last patch seemed to be OK. However, I noticed that the bounds for the search region for reduced forms was not optimal. I inserted the optimal bounds and modified the loop logic accordingly, and I gained a speedup of a factor around 10.

Before:

```
sage: timeit( 'BinaryQF_reduced_representatives(-998995)')
5 loops, best of 3: 5.52 s per loop
```

After:

```
sage: timeit( 'BinaryQF_reduced_representatives(-998995)')
5 loops, best of 3: 547 ms per loop
```

Doctest runs successfully and I tested 1000 discriminants with 6 digits each, compared to the corresponding results produced by the last patch and compared number of produced forms with Hurwitz class numbers in gp. I think its OK now. Ready for being reviewed.
