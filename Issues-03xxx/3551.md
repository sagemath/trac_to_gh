The magma_version command is not documented; I would suggest that it say "this command returns a tuple of the form ((int,int,int),str) giving the version numbers, and it depends on having magma installed".

It also actually calls magma (to ask it its version number, I think). Would it be worth storing the version information in a file somewhere to aviod having to start a magma session?

You can't store it in a file since the Magma version on any given system could be different.

That being said, lots of functions in sage/interfaces/ need to be documented.

Also, it would suddenly give a wrong answer as soon as one changes their magma version, which presumably happens a lot.
