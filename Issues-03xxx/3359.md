Dear Andrey,

I don't know what precisely is wrong with that code, but a very
similar code works.

First, i can reproduce the trouble:
sage: Rt.<t> = PolynomialRing(QQ,1)
sage: p = 1+t
sage: R.<u,v> = PolynomialRing(QQ, 2)
sage: p(u/v)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call
last)
...

The following works:
sage: Rt2.<t> = PolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: p2 = 1+t
sage: p2(u/v)
(u + v)/v

The difference is that Rt is a Multivariate Polynomial Ring (with one
variable, though), but Rt2 is a genuine Univariate Polynomial Ring.

So, at least there is a work-around.
