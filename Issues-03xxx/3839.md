```
> v = c(3,5,9,1)
> v[c(2,3)]
[1] 5 9 
```
works in R, but the corresponding statement in Sage does not:

```
sage: v = r.c(3,5,9,1)
sage: n = r.c(2,3)
sage: v[n]
[1] 3
```

I believe this is a defect. With the attached patch, the following works:

```
sage: v = r.c(3,5,9,1)
sage: n = r.c(2,3)
sage: v[n]
[1] 5 9
sage: v[-2]
[1] 3 9 1
sage: v['c(2,3)']
[1] 5 9
sage: v[2,4,3]
[1] 5 1 9
sage: v[2]
[1] 5
```
