The attached patch (built against 3.0) adds a zeta_function method to the class of schemes over finite fields. It is meant to be a default procedure, to be overridden by something more sensible for particular classes of schemes (e.g., elliptic and hyperelliptic curves).

Zeta functions are currently only enabled over prime fields, but it will be trivial to fix that once coercion between nonprime finite fields is supported.

<a id='comment:6'></a>ncalexan brought up the good point that maybe some users will expect a rational function from zeta_function. After some discussion, it's been renamed to zeta_series. 

I also fixed about 10 occurrences of "the the" in sage.
