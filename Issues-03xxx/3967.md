This looks good. I went ahead and re-based this on 3.1.2 with my patch from #4155 applied, since it makes sense to apply that first. 

John, you should at least glance to make sure I didn't mess anything up rewriting the patch, just for the sake of having a second set of eyes look at it.

Craig,

the rebased patch is broken: Toward the end you do not rename jp to jp_file and hence things do not compile. I will fix this in my tree and do some valgrinding.
