Otherwise, I like this very much after having gone through the pain of implementing a unique factory for a parent already, I would have wasted a week less if this had already been in sage.

I guess the first one is worrying while the rest is mostly a printing issue.

OK, I fixed the doctests in coerce.pyx. The issue was that loads(dumps(V)) wasn't returning a new object anymore (this is *good*) so it wasn't testing what I wanted to test (equal but not identical parents). 

The other one is almost certainly due to #4276, looking into that now.

Thanks you. This one is a real pain to rebase, and I've wanted to use it elsewhere too. 

Note that Mike Hansen did look at these during Sage Days 10, and the response was generally positive (though not formal).
