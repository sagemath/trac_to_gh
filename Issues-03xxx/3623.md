Uniqueness of parents makes Sage operate much more smoothly. This leads to an enormous amount of nearly identical caching code scattered throughout the library. This factory handles all the caching for you, and also provides a good pickling mechanism.

Needs to be rebased against 3.1.2.alpha4:

```

Otherwise, I like this very much after having gone through the pain of implementing a unique factory for a parent already, I would have wasted a week less if this had already been in sage.

The patch applies cleanly against 3.2.1 and together with #4276 I am seeing two doctest failures:

Thanks you. This one is a real pain to rebase, and I've wanted to use it elsewhere too. 

Note that Mike Hansen did look at these during Sage Days 10, and the response was generally positive (though not formal).
