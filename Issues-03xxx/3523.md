Among other things, this fixes a MAJOR bug in flint-1.0.6 (in getting coefficients of polys) which would make that version of flint pretty useless.

The package linked from #2357 modifies the Makefile in FLINT to install the NTL interface. Does this package include those changes? 

It might be a good idea to check this package with the patch from #2357.
