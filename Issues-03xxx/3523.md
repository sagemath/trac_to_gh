Among other things, this fixes a MAJOR bug in flint-1.0.6 (in getting coefficients of polys) which would make that version of flint pretty useless. 


NOTE: One serious concern is that somebody stupidly named the last flint package in sage 1.06 instead of 1.0.6.   This means that the sage auto-upgrade system will think that flint 106 is newer than 1.0.10.  so this spkg should probably be remade as 1.010 before it is included.  Bummer.

The package linked from #2357 modifies the Makefile in FLINT to install the NTL interface. Does this package include those changes? 

It might be a good idea to check this package with the patch from #2357.
