I'm attaching a patch with, I suppose, three changes (two of which are minor) to the 'view' function:
1. longer (and I think clearer) documentation
2. no 'center' option anymore. I don't think centering things in displayed equations has any effect in LaTeX.
3. changed default value of 'sep' from '$$ $$' to *.  I have two reasons for this: I think the output looks better this way, and I think that the default value of '$$ $$' is misleading: someone might infer that it's playing the role of the variables 'math_left' and 'math_right' in _latex_file, when in fact it's just adding some vertical space between the output lines.  If you don't like having a default of *, then I would suggest changing it to something like '\\vspace{5mm}' which gives a better idea of what 'sep' actually does and even implies how one might change it (by changing the length).

REFEREE REPORT:

1. The new docs say "If in notebook mode, this embeds a png image in the output.".  That is not true.  view uses jsmath to typeset output -- this does not in any way involve png's.

2. There absolutely have to be some doctests added, e.g., examples illustrating what this function does.  E.g., you can in the doctest set the system to be in EMBEDDED_MODE, then get html  output, or something. 

3. I agree with removing center and the sep, i.e., with the core changes.

4.. I can't actually apply this patch to either sage-3.0.2 or sage-3.0.2.alpha2:

```
