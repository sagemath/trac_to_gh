Use this instead:

L = [[cos(pi*i/100),sin(pi*i/100)] for i in range(200)]
p = polygon(L, rgbcolor=(1,1,0))
p.save(aspect_ratio=1)          ## or   p.show()

```

The attached patch fixes the above issue.  It also greatly improves all the examples to simply
show the plots instead of having hacking notes outside the examples to show the plots, which was
done before when the doctesting framework couldn't handle plotting.
