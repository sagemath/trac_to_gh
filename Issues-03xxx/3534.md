Use this instead:

L = [[cos(pi*i/100),sin(pi*i/100)] for i in range(200)]
p = polygon(L, rgbcolor=(1,1,0))
p.save(aspect_ratio=1)          ## or   p.show()

The attached patch fixes the above issue.  It also greatly improves all the examples to simply

It would be better to patch against the new version of the tutorial (the one in 3.0.4.alpha1): see
[https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/3347](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/3347).
