In Sage 3.4.1.rc2, this works:

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
| Sage Version 3.4.1.rc2, Release Date: 2009-04-10                   |
| Type notebook() for the GUI, and license() for information.        |
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage: vector(CDF, [2, 2]) * vector(ZZ, [1, 3])
8.0
```

So this sounds like it is fixed.  However, are there nice doctests from the above patch that could be added to the current code?  Nick?
