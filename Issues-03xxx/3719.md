As reported by Ursula Whitcher

```
sage: G = SymmetricGroup(4)
sage: G.cohomology(1,2)
```
yields an error. The problem is a bug in the current version of the GAP package HAP, version 1.8.5. The latest version 1.8.7 but there the bug still exists

```

Yes, it should be an optional doctest. I am somewhat concerned that the author of the GAP package just rereleased the package with the bug fix instead of incrementing the release number. Since various packaging efforts are under way I could imagine something like this not getting fixed upstream in other distributions, so the doctest when run with optional flags would show that the problem remains unfixed. 

It is still my plan to used optional testing in the future at least for the build on sage.math per default.

Merged both patches in Sage 3.1.2.alpha1.

David,

I added an hg repo to the spkg (but kept the p6 patchlevel). Please base future spkgs on the spkg
