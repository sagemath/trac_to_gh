Okay, I can confirm that with sage 3.0.1, sage -gp has the same speed  
as my standalone GP build. So mostly likely the change to GMP 4.2.2  
introduced a speed regression (probably the core 2 patches not being  
applied properly).

Fix this!

Yeah, I went back and looked at the log, and found this:

```
Do we have a Core2 CPU?... Yes
Detected Intel Core 2 CPU
Found GMP at /home/dmharvey/sage-3.0.2/spkg/build/gmp-4.2.2/src
ERROR: Incorrect GMP Version.  Found GMP version: 4.2.2
       needed version 4.2.1
```

So it's simply that jason's script knows not to try patching the wrong version of GMP.

We should probably ignore this, since MPIR should be here soonish.

Further developments:

Jason updated his patch to a 4.2.2 version, now available from his website.

I tested it and it does work against a vanilla 4.2.2 build.

However, when I put it in the 4.2.2 spkg, it doesn't work. Specifically: it copies the core 2 files, but then GMP's configure script doesn't link to the files, in fact it uses GENERIC code for all the mpn routines.

I dug a little further and discovered the probable culprit: the configure script is from 4.2.1, not 4.2.2!!! And this appears to be because we *overwrite* the configure script when installing the fast gcd patch.

Grrrr. I will try to fix this later today.
