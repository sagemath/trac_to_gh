<a id='comment:3'></a>
I guess what was meant here was

```
sage: K.<a> = FiniteField(7^2)
sage: K.hom([a^7])

Ring endomorphism of Finite Field in a of size 7^2
  Defn: a |--> 6*a + 1
```
With 'hom' rather than 'Hom' it works fine.  As does

```
sage: K.Hom(K)
Automorphism group of Finite Field in a of size 7^2
sage: K.Hom(K).list()

[
Ring endomorphism of Finite Field in a of size 7^2
  Defn: a |--> 6*a + 1,
Ring endomorphism of Finite Field in a of size 7^2
  Defn: a |--> a
]
```

The reported behaviour with `K.Hom([a^7])` is much more general; it is the default for creating Homsets: if no specific method exists to construct the Homset, just name it (however meaningless that may be!).  Thus

```
sage: QQ.Hom(5)
Set of Morphisms from Rational Field to 5 in Category of objects
```
Attempting to list such sets of morphisms leads to an error.

I think this has to be regarded as a feature rather than a bug.
