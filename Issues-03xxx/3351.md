See 

   http://www.math.utexas.edu/pipermail/maxima/2008/011882.html

where we learn that Maxima is GPLv2 only, not GPLv2+.  This means that
we can not binary link Maxima and Sage. 

Something from the email at the above link should be mentioned in the
COPYING.txt file, and the statement at the top of COPYING.txt that

"Every component of SAGE except jsmath is licensed under a GPL v2 (or
later) compatible license." may need to be changed to

"Every component of SAGE except jsmath is licensed under a GPL v2 compatible
or GPLv2+  compatible license.  All components that are binary linked
to Sage are GPLv2+."


ALTERNATIVELY: I would greatly prefer to just have the GPLv2 only
stuff in Maxima changed to GPLv2+ to avoid this problem altogether.

The statement "All components that are binary linked to Sage are GPLv2+." is incorrect since we are linking against a [L]GPL V3+ GSL, GMP and GNUTSL library.
