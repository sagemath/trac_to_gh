John Cremona requests a sqrt for polynomial rings:

```
I have needed the following.  g(x) is a univariate polynomial which I
know to be a square, and i want its square root.  g.factor() does too
much, as does g.squarefree_decomposition().  I can get the sqrt via
g.gcd(g.derivative()), which works in my case since I know that the
sqrt is itself square-free.
```

The attached patch provides an is_square method.  It also fixes a bug in squarefree_decomposition: that method would barf for the wrong reason if you gave it a polynomial over a finite field.  Now it barfs for the right reason.

Positive review for polynomial_is_square.patch, after my own trac3891-reviewer-fixes.patch is applied (so only my patch needs further review).

I think Cremona may have been hoping for a polynomial sqrt that was more efficient than squarefree_decomposition; maybe that should be opened as a new wishlist ticket after this one is closed.
