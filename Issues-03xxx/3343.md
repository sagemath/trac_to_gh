```
First, ln should only take 1 argument.  As it is, it accepts more than one, and just ignores all of the extra ones:

```
sage: ln(6,2)
log(6)
sage: ln(12,-2,0,0,3,4,5)
log(12)
```

Second, the documentation for ln (hitting 'ln?') gives the documentation for the class Function_log, and hence includes things like this:

```
sage: log(1024, 2) # the following is ugly (for now)
log(1024)/log(2)
sage: log(10, 4)
log(10)/log(4)
```

The attached patch defines ln as a function accepting only one argument, and with its own documentation.


Keywords: **ln, calculus**
