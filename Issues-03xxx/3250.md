Parent does has a default hash for python classes, but not for cython classes.  This leads to very subtle bugs where converting a python class to a cython class can result in coercion failing mysteriously.  Either coercion should be more descriptive with its error messages resulting from lack of a hash function or Parent should get a default cdef hash function.

We didn't do as many changes to the comparison/hashing model as we had intended starting out, mainly because it just got to be too much on top of everything else... 

However, short of a specific example, this ticket is rather vague, and I have never run into this.
