```
a=matrix(QQ,3,3,range(9))
v=matrix(QQ,3,1,range(3))
(latex(a\v), a)
```

gives an error.

I think it has to do with the parsing of latex(a\v); it seems to try doing "(latex(a._backslash_(v), a)" (note the missing parenthesis in the call to latex.

You see this parsing in the error from:

```
@interact
def _(a=matrix(QQ,3,3,range(9)), v=matrix(QQ,3,1,range(3))):
    html('$$%s %s = %s$$'%(latex(a), latex(a\v), latex(v)))
```

with the patch from #3121
