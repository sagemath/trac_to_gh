In part 37.8 of the Reference Manual (the Elliptic curves over finite fields section) there are some formatting issues. For instance, in the section on the frobenius_polynomial, we have the sentence:

```
The Frobenius endomorphism of the elliptic curve has quadratic characteristic polynomial. 
In most cases this is irreducible and defines an imaginary quadratic order; 
for some supersingular curves, Frobenius is an integer a and the polynomial is 1703#326 .}}}

I assume that the 1703#326 is some sort of broken formatting code.

There are similar examples throughout this page.

On a slightly different tack, in the documentation for cardinality and order, it would be helpful to say that "sea" (as in the algorithm) means Schoof-Elkies-Atkin.

**Resolution:** fixed

The strange omission or garblings are all for pieces of docstrings in LaTeX format, i.e. between $...$.  But there are many other such parts of docstrings which display fine.  So I don't know why some don't come out right.

The first issue doesn't seem to be a problem with the new documentation.  I'm attaching a patch for the second one ('sea').
