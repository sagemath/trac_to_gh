```
1. Go to the 3d plots section of the reference manual, e.g.,
   http://localhost:8000/doc/live/ref/module-sage.plot.plot3d.parametric-plot3d.html

2. Hit shift-enter to evaluate a plot.

3. Observe that the plot doesn't work. 


This should be easy to replicate on all operating systems, etc.  This bug was 
reported by walter neumann on March 11, 2008.


---

As a temporary workaround you can do the following:

1. View the page of the html reference manual of interest to you that contains 3d plotting code.
2. Click in the upper left on File -> Copy Worksheet.

You'll get a complete copy of the page of the reference manual
as a normal worksheet.  You can then use shift-enter to evaluate
3d plots and they should work fine in that copy (since it is
just a normal worksheet).

This is about http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/3167

If I open a new worksheet and execute

x,y=var('x,y')
plot3d(sin(x*y),(x,-4,4),(y,-4,4))

I see this in Opera's Java Console:

which "explains" the blank applet (i.e., no plot).  Apparently, the
notebook finds and serves up the zip file when it's requested relative
to the base URL of an ordinary worksheet, but it does not do the same
for a live doc worksheet.

Though I have not yet tried it, one fix that springs to mind is to
encode the full URL of the archive in plot.plot3d.base.show().  But this
seems to be a server (permissions?) issue.  Once again, I'm in over my
head, so it would be great to get some input.

The logs above are from Sun's 64-bit JDK in Opera 9 on Fedora 9.  I
don't know how to access the Java console in Firefox, but I've
experienced the same behavior in both the 32-bit and 64-bit versions.
