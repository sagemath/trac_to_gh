The docstring for the function PolynomialRing states

```
    OUTPUT:
        PolynomialRing(base_ring, name, sparse=False) returns a univariate
        polynomial ring; all other input formats return a multivariate
        polynomial ring.
```
which is not what PolynomialRing actually does, since

```
sage: PolynomialRing(QQ, names=['x'])
Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Rational Field
```
Either PolynomialRing has a bug or the docstring should be corrected.

**Resolution:** fixed

**Author:** Simon King

**Reviewer:** Martin Albrecht, Mike Hansen

To be more precise, the problem is that the docstring of PolynomialRing says there is only one way to get a univariate polynomial ring, but in fact PolynomialRing tries to be clever and returns univariate rings in other cases too.

```
Note that a multivariate polynomial ring is returned even if the 
given number of variables is zero or one. 
```

should be replaced with

```
Note that a multivariate polynomial ring is returned when an explicit number is given.
