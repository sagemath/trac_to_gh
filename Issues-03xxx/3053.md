If a cell starts with %hide, it should not be shown unless it is in focus.  The new cell_resize code doesn't respect this.  To see this:

1. Load a fresh worksheet with %hide's -- none of them are hidden.  Click on input cells then out  hide them.

2. Resize a web browser window with %hides -- suddenly all %hide inputs are shown.
