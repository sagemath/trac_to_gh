REPORT:

1. This directly conflicts with #3040

2. This patch will *massively suck* performance wise, since it changes `_magma_` to make a call out to Magma for every single entry of a matrix.  Thus, e.g., converting a 500x500 matrix (which takes a reasonable amount of time with #3040) will go from one single  pexpect call to magma, to 250,000 separate pexpect calls to magma, which will take literally forever. 

For reason 2 this patch is not acceptable.

Great!  However the function 

```
def _magma_gens(self):
