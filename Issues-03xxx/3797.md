This patch:

1. Fixes a bug in sparse6 strings for n=0.
2. Implements generation of graphs with loops.
3. Implements generation of graphs with specified degree sequence.

The last two have been verified to some extent using Sloane's tables. It's all in the documentation.

From the submission:

```
This patch:

   1. Fixes a bug in sparse6 strings for n=0.
```

I think this bugfix looks good.

```
   2. Implements generation of graphs with loops.
```

This looks good -- I can't guarantee that it works, but it looks fine.

```
   3. Implements generation of graphs with specified degree sequence.
```

It's not clear what degree sequence means.  I can derive it from the code, but maybe change

```
 	241	        deg_seq -- a sequence of degrees for the graph to have. If specified, 
 	242	            augment, property and size are all ignored. 
```
to something like

```
 	241	        deg_seq -- a sequence of non-negative integers.  The degrees of the vertices of the generated graph will be the specified integers, in some order.  If specified, 
 	242	            augment, property and size are all ignored. 
```

Is that even clearer?
