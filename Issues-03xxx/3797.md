<a id='comment:3'>**Comment 3:**</a>
From the submission:

```
This patch:

   1. Fixes a bug in sparse6 strings for n=0.
```

I think this bugfix looks good.

```
   2. Implements generation of graphs with loops.
```

This looks good -- I can't guarantee that it works, but it looks fine.

```
   3. Implements generation of graphs with specified degree sequence.
```

It's not clear what degree sequence means.  I can derive it from the code, but maybe change

```
 	241	        deg_seq -- a sequence of degrees for the graph to have. If specified, 
 	242	            augment, property and size are all ignored. 
```
to something like

```
 	241	        deg_seq -- a sequence of non-negative integers.  The degrees of the vertices of the generated graph will be the specified integers, in some order.  If specified, 
 	242	            augment, property and size are all ignored. 
```

Is that even clearer?
