The line:

```
g.minimalizeAndTailReduce()
```
is nearly meaningless, as it ignores the result.
For having a reduced system set
the keyword
redsb=True
for the groebner_basis call.
Furthermore, your reduce implementation doesn't necessarily yield a unique (reduced) normal form.
For PolyBoRi >0.4 set
strat.optRedTail=True
for PolyBoRi <0.4
apply
p=red_tail(strat,p)
to a normal form.

Looks good,
there is still some minor thing, I detected.
But this is nothing about the patch, as it was buggy before:

It is possible to pass a deg_bound to
groebner_basis
.
So the result is not garantied to be a GB.
In this case it looks strange to set

```
self.__gb = g
```

maybe you can check this
via

```
if kwds.get("deg_bound",False) is False:
  self.__gb = g
```

Then I'll give it a positive review.

ups: still, comments regarding the patch:
These are optional, as they only concern performance:

pbori.pyxline 3144

```
            s = sum([prod([x[i] for i in xrange(n) if v[i]],  
	            B.one_element()) for v in s],  
                    B.zero_element()) 
            s = s.set()
```
should be faster with

```
            s=BooleSet(sum([prod([x[i] for i in xrange(n) if v[i]],  
	            B.one_element()) for v in s]
```
However, you will have to handle the case of the empty set seperately(when there are no monomials) to make sure, that it is the right ring.
I think, if we can make this easier upstream.

Furthermore, if you really want to be clever: The use of prod is quite unoptimal here.
If you really want get these multiplications for variables fast, you should
multiply them in this way:
x1*(x2*(x3*x4)))
So first use the indices behind. Note, that indices in PolyBoRi don't have to be identical to those in sage/Singular
lex, degree lex: identical
dp(dp_asc): reversed.
Blocks of degree lexicographical: identical
Blocks of degree reverse lex. : reversed in each block, so quite strange
(if it is correctly implemented in sage)

It seems we didn't implement BooleSet(BooleanPolynomial) in Sage. I'll check the upstream implementation and fix that.

I don't do anything fancy for now, but I reversed the order of the product. This might be faster in the normal case which is lex if I understand your comment correctly.

sorry, the line was long, without the sum:
just

```
BooleSet([prod([x[i] for ...]
```

A BooleSet is a set of monomials.
It uses a more sophisticated addition.

yes, it is much faster in Lex, even from a Python interpreter with boost::python calling overhead (in large examples, high degree monomials)

You have my positive review :-).

I am seeing slight merge issues with my current alpha2 tree:

```
mabshoff@sage:/scratch/mabshoff/release-cycle/sage-3.1.2.alpha2/devel/sage$ patch -p1 < trac_3915_pbori_improvements.patch
patching file sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_ideal.py
Hunk #1 FAILED at 391.
Hunk #2 succeeded at 1948 (offset 47 lines).
1 out of 2 hunks FAILED -- saving rejects to file sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_ideal.py.rej
```
The failing hunk deletes `contains`, so this should be easy to rebase.

Cheers,

Michael

Martin suggested in IRC just to delete the hunk that fails to apply manually. The reject is cause by some other code being applied in alpha2, so I will sort this out by posting an updated patch of Martin's patch and a second patch that deletes the hunk in question.

Cheers,
