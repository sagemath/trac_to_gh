The line:

```
g.minimalizeAndTailReduce()
```
is nearly meaningless, as it ignores the result.
For having a reduced system set
the keyword
redsb=True
for the groebner_basis call.
Furthermore, your reduce implementation doesn't necessarily yield a unique (reduced) normal form.
For PolyBoRi >0.4 set
strat.optRedTail=True
for PolyBoRi <0.4
apply
p=red_tail(strat,p)
to a normal form.

Looks good,
there is still some minor thing, I detected.
But this is nothing about the patch, as it was buggy before:

It is possible to pass a deg_bound to
groebner_basis
.
So the result is not garantied to be a GB.
In this case it looks strange to set

```
self.__gb = g
```

maybe you can check this
via

```
if kwds.get("deg_bound",False) is False:
  self.__gb = g
```

Then I'll give it a positive review.

ups: still, comments regarding the patch:
These are optional, as they only concern performance:

pbori.pyxline 3144

```
            s = sum([prod([x[i] for i in xrange(n) if v[i]],  
	            B.one_element()) for v in s],  
                    B.zero_element()) 
            s = s.set()
```
should be faster with

```
            s=BooleSet(sum([prod([x[i] for i in xrange(n) if v[i]],  
	            B.one_element()) for v in s]
```
However, you will have to handle the case of the empty set seperately(when there are no monomials) to make sure, that it is the right ring.
I think, if we can make this easier upstream.

Furthermore, if you really want to be clever: The use of prod is quite unoptimal here.
If you really want get these multiplications for variables fast, you should
multiply them in this way:
x1*(x2*(x3*x4)))
So first use the indices behind. Note, that indices in PolyBoRi don't have to be identical to those in sage/Singular
lex, degree lex: identical
dp(dp_asc): reversed.
Blocks of degree lexicographical: identical
Blocks of degree reverse lex. : reversed in each block, so quite strange
(if it is correctly implemented in sage)

It seems we didn't implement BooleSet(BooleanPolynomial) in Sage. I'll check the upstream implementation and fix that.

I don't do anything fancy for now, but I reversed the order of the product. This might be faster in the normal case which is lex if I understand your comment correctly.

sorry, the line was long, without the sum:
just

```
BooleSet([prod([x[i] for ...]
```

A BooleSet is a set of monomials.
It uses a more sophisticated addition.

yes, it is much faster in Lex, even from a Python interpreter with boost::python calling overhead (in large examples, high degree monomials)

You have my positive review :-).

I am seeing slight merge issues with my current alpha2 tree:

The failing hunk deletes `contains`, so this should be easy to rebase.
