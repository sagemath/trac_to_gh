We've been having lots of trouble with arrows looking nice.  In this patch, there is a new matplotlib class that puts an arrow at the end of a line, using the same sort of things they do to put markers on lines.  This way, the arrows:

1. don't depend on the aspect ratio of the plot

2. don't depend on the scale of the plot.

They always look pretty :).

It would be nice to eventually upstream this functionality into the matplotlib Line2D class.
