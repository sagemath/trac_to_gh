We've been having lots of trouble with arrows looking nice.  In this patch, there is a new matplotlib class that puts an arrow at the end of a line, using the same sort of things they do to put markers on lines.  This way, the arrows:

1. don't depend on the aspect ratio of the plot

2. don't depend on the scale of the plot.

They always look pretty :).

It would be nice to eventually upstream this functionality into the matplotlib Line2D class.

Oh, the patch also updates the sage "arrow" class.  This patch is made for after applying the patch at #3853, but it might be possible to apply it before.
