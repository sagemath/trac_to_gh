This ticket implements a citation tracking system for Sage which can give fine grained information on the algorithms and implementations used for a specific computation.
This is in contrast to the current method in `sage.misc.citation` that relies on running a smaller example through the profiler.

The new citation module allows developers to add annotations with citation data in the code directly via decorators tuned to minimize performance overhead. Citations can be provided and obtained in several different formats, thanks to the [pybtex](http://pybtex.sourceforge.net/) package. This includes bibtex and plain text output.

Sample user session:

```
sage: R.<x,y,z> = QQ[]
sage: print citations

{\sc Singular} {3-1-3} --- {A} computer algebra system for polynomial
computations. 2011, http://www.singular.uni-kl.de.
sage: p = z^2 + 1; q = z^3 + 2
sage: I = (p*q^2, y-z^2)*R
sage: t = I.complete_primary_decomposition()

Some thoughts:

From: "Fernando Perez" <fperez....@gmail.com>
Date: May 27, 7:02 pm
Subject: Citing Sage and Used Systems
To: sage-devel

This is certainly not an easy problem if one wants a '100%' solution,
in the sense that tracking down every single line of code in any given
computation isn't easy.  But here's  a quick idea that can give an
'80%' solution for all in-process sage/python/extension code (it won't
work for code done by external processes like maxima, I'm afraid). If
you run in the ipython console a program via '%run -p' it will be
executed under the control of the profiler, and the result will tell
you what functions were called, how many times, etc.  Similarly %prun
lets you execute single statements with profiler control.  The
profiler results object can be returned and analyzed further, if I
recall correctly there is some information in there about where
functions come from.

This basically does what is described in [comment:1](#comment%3A1). We need to do much better than that.

We are working on a system which allows developers to annotate (decorate?) functions with citation information. The decorated functions will add the citation entries to a central database at runtime. This database can be queried to get the list of packages/papers/algorithms used in various formats.

In short, I don't think we can close this yet.

You'll need our pybtex-spkg in order to make it work: http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/burcin/spkg/pybtex-0.15.spkg

Hi!  If this doesn't slow things down, it is a really good idea, especially given that Sage is not trying to cover up the other programs inside of it.   I assume that (given the comments on the blog) you will post timing information in critical areas eventually.

I have one substantive comment, I think:
> You'll need our pybtex-spkg in order to make it work: http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/burcin/spkg/pybtex-0.15.spkg

Hmm, so does that mean we would need to make `pybtex` a standard package in order for this to work?  (Currently there is a probationary period needed, which we have recently [been enforcing](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/11563).)  

Or are you suggesting this would be an optional spkg (for now), which means your examples would have to be optional for now?

Here follow a couple silly comments that don't actually review much, but might still be worthwhile to ponder.
* Missing "to": `in order make it faster`

Thanks.


> * A *lot* of the examples refer to Michael Brickenstein, which seems somewhat less than advisable.  I mean no disrespect here - clearly he is contributing loads and deserves citations!  But for the first-time reader of this documentation, it would be nice to have a bigger variety of citations, perhaps even beyond Sage components to the subcomponents.  For instance, the ones in the bibtex patch.

You are right. It is more a coincidence than anything else; still, it has to be changed.


> * What does [trac-3317-example-usage.patch] exactly have an example of?  I see the `@cites(citable_items.slimgb)` - is this demonstrating that we get the same thing through the new decorator as we would have from `sage.misc.citation`?  This comment is probably just my ignorance speaking, feel free to ignore it.

I won't :-).
For this citation system, it is indispensable, that the decorator gets widespread into sage. In my opinion, it is best if people decorate their own functions (and possibly make their own bibtex-entries). The example shows, how a function should be decorated.
(The deprecation-message can be uncommented later, as soon as the "new" citation system is more accurate than the old one.)

Corrected some of the errors and included my benchmark results for the decorated pass-function (in `citation/__init__.py`'s `_benchmark_`-function).

Another problem came to my mind: If a user tries to make an instance of one of the citables, strange things will happen. But I'm not sure, if we should really care about that.

Is the documentation alright?


Cheers.

I still think, it would be best, if pybtex would become a standard package.

Is there any work needed for the reference manual (referring to jhpalmieri's comment)?

Sorry for not having responded.

Replying to [@mwhansen](#comment%3A18):
> I'm not convinced that it is the best idea to have it so that anytime a function is called we have to log that its citation, even in the case where we don't care about that data.

What exactly are your concerns? Speed? Integrity?

In my opinion it would be very nice to have tracked the used components, no matter if we care for this data. And it's not meant to log every function call. Only rather important functions should be decorated (could say "cite-worthy", but that's a vague term). Maybe there should be rules on what makes some worth citing in Sage.

Well thanks for pointing out, that it might be unclear that you need the spkg. I thought it will be enough if the dependency is mentioned as the dependency of the corresponding ticket, but I'm willing to change the description if that's not clear enough.

I'm currently updating the spkg to a newer version, should I directly include the link to it when done?

Replying to [@alexanderdreyer](#comment%3A22):

The intention of this ticket (as far as I see it) is to track sage's components and their citations. Pybtex is our tool of choice. Therefore, yes, it is important.
