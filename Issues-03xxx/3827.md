TimeSeries.randomize has a lognormal distribution generator built in along with uniform, normal, and semicircle. However, there is no docstring that says so! Simply need to add a line that looks like

```
INPUT:
    distribution -- 'lognormal': mean loc and standard deviation scale
```

See patch below.
