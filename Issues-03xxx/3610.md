```
sage: (R(2.1) + R(2.2))^2 in R
False
sage: R = RealIntervalField(32)
sage: a = (R(2.1) + R(2.2))^2 
sage: a
[18.489999987 .. 18.490000010]
sage: a in R
False
sage: a.parent()
Real Interval Field with 32 bits of precision
sage: a == a
False
```

This is caused by the following code in which gets inherited from parent.pyx:

```
        try:
            x2 = self(x)
            return bool(x2 == x)
        except TypeError:
            return False
```

Since equality is not reflexive for RealIntervals, this doesn't work as intended.

Component: **basic arithmetic**
