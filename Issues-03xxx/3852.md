See this [sage-wiki](http://wiki.sagemath.org/Unit%20of%20Measurement) page for some ideas.

Here are three possibilities:

* ScientificPython's PhysicalQuantities package: http://dirac.cnrs-orleans.fr/ScientificPython/ScientificPythonManual/Scientific.Physics.PhysicalQuantities-module.html

It looks like this package is part of an actively maintained library, ScientificPython (http://dirac.cnrs-orleans.fr/plone/software/scientificpython/).  Here is a link for a printing package for this module: http://python.net/crew/bhoel/PyLaTeX-0.2/html/PyLaTeX.UnitPrint.html



* Unum: http://home.scarlet.be/be052320/Unum.html

It looks like this package is dead; last release was in 2005.  It is GPL.

* The Pyre units package (http://www.cacr.caltech.edu/projects/pyre/).  This was last updated in 2005, I think (you have to check out pythia 0.8).

* The enthought units package (which is apparently based on the pyre package), as well as the blockcanvas unit functions.

A thread about adding a units package to scipy: http://projects.scipy.org/pipermail/scipy-user/2005-March/004263.html

Another thread: http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Mail/Message/scipy-user/3176352

Another page in a book mentioning two packages: http://books.google.com/books?id=j7QbD83-h8AC&pg=PA157&lpg=PA157&dq=python+physicalquantities&source=web&ots=C-JZyCFWn2&sig=x62bQ0jWyQerBGAvgJOBQuMQeWM&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=10&ct=result

A recent (July 2008!) trac ticket about the enthought units package: https://svn.enthought.com/enthought/ticket/1524  Related checkins seem to include: https://svn.enthought.com/enthought/changeset/21093

Apparently the enthought units code is undergoing refactorization.  See https://mail.enthought.com/pipermail/enthought-dev/2008-July/015717.html


I'd say we ought to keep our eye (or help out with) the enthought package refactorization.

FIRST REFEREE REPORT on trac_3852.patch:

1. The doctest coverage is still very bad (38%):

```
wstein@sage:~/build/sage-4.1.1$ ./sage -coverage devel/sage/sage/symbolic/units.py 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
devel/sage/sage/symbolic/units.py
ERROR: Please define a s == loads(dumps(s)) doctest.
SCORE devel/sage/sage/symbolic/units.py: 38% (5 of 13)

Missing documentation:
         * evalunitdict():
         * unit_derivations_expr(v):
         * _sage_doc_(self):
         * str_to_unit(name):
         * __init__(self, data):
         * trait_names(self):
         * __getattr__(self, name):


Missing doctests:
         * vars_in_str(s):


Possibly wrong (function name doesn't occur in doctests):
         * convert_temperature(expr, target):

----------------------------------------------------------------------

```



2. The new code fails numerous doctests:

```
        sage -t  devel/sage/sage/symbolic/units.py # 4 doctests failed
        sage -t  devel/sage/sage/symbolic/expression.pyx # 2 doctests failed
```

The actual failures:

my apologies, I hadn't properly read the issue, much less the patch, and I meant to retract the post. 

I was actually referring to the dimpy module, not the patch above, and it was definitely tongue-in-cheek. Upon further investigation I found that dimpy doesn't integrate well with sage's types system.

I've now read the patch and will try to find time to run the tests.

Hm, it is not easy to find out what units() is actually supposed to be used for.. 
In the notebook, units? gives:

File: /Users/sschym/Programs/sage/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sage/symbolic/units.py

Type: <type ‘instance’>

Definition: units( [noargspec] )

Docstring:

    A collection of units of a some type.

        EXAMPLES:

        sage: units.power
        Collection power of units: cheval_vapeur horsepower watt

I could not find anything useful in the documentation, either. Do I have to compile the documentation separately? 

Cheers

Some questions and comments:

In `unit_derivations_expr` (in units.py), why the check to see that Z is a string? We get Z by looking up something in a dictionary whose values are all strings, so either Z is a string, or we threw a ValueError and aren't executing the rest of the function anyway. It looks like the "if isinstance" bit can be deleted. Am I misunderstanding something?

A minor point: the string representation of collections of units uses strange/incorrect grammar. "Collection area of units" sounds like units do collecting in a certain area. I think "Collection of units of area" is better. How about something like

```
name = ' of ' + self.__name if self.__name else ''
return "Collection of units%s: %s"%(name, ' '.join(sorted([str(x) for x in self.__data])))
```
in the `__repr___` method for Units?

In the descriptions of the mass units, the solar mass refers to the size of the earth -- but you mean the mass of the earth. Size is length, area, or volume; different units!

Perhaps we should include "metre" and "litre" as synonyms; it seems that the official spelling, according to the SI Brochure, is "metre", and that's a common spelling anyway. The liter/litre isn't an official SI unit, but it is frequently spelled as litre, so might as well put in both. This would also allow non-Americans putting units into their LaTeX documents to get correctly-spelled units.

This module should get added to the reference manual (perhaps we can do that in another ticket), and a bunch of little bits in the docstrings need to be fixed up. One suggestion: change the title at the very top of units.py to "Units of measurement" to avoid confusion with multiplicatively invertible elements of a ring.

Line 600 or so: I would find it much less confusing if ton_force was described with "Defined to be 2000 pounds of force".

In line 685: the documentation for candela has some goofy stuff near the end. According to the official brochure, you need "1/683 watt per steradian".

Overall, I think this is a great addition to Sage. The code is pretty simple, works well, and is thoroughly doctested. Once the above issues are addressed, this can get a positive review. I can whip up a patch making the above changes, or can review someone else's patch.

Thanks for pushing this ticket closer to the finish Dan.

Though I don't think fixing the whitespace problems of `sage/symbolic/expression.pyx` in attachment:trac_3852_fix_whitespace.patch is a good idea. There are many positively reviewed symbolics tickets waiting to be merged on trac and many of them touch the same file. Pushing the patch on my queue, I get

```

Hunk #7 succeeded at 317 with fuzz 1 (offset -2 lines).

Hunk #215 FAILED at 6699
Hunk #216 FAILED at 6713
3 out of 236 hunks FAILED -- saving rejects to file sage/symbolic/expression.pyx.rej
```

I don't think rebasing the patch on the other changes is worth it. We should either have an understanding that this ticket is merged after all the other actual bug fixes, and the failures in applying this patch are ignored, or change this patch to fix only the relevant sections of the file. (Actually, I wouldn't mind if this was a general policy on whitespace fixes.)


Otherwise, I'm willing to give Dan's changes and this ticket a positive review.
