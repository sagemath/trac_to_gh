I created a google spreadsheet form to collect bugs far more easier than registering at a mailing list and so on. In order to make this happen:

1. [proofread my form](http://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?key=pCwvGVwSMxTzT6E2xNdo5fA)
2. include a (red?) "Bug Report" link in the top right corner of the notebook pointing to this website:

```
<a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?key=pCwvGVwSMxTzT6E2xNdo5fA" target="_blank"><span stype="font-color: red;">Bug Report</span></a>
```

I'll check the data, report bugs on sage-devel or just directly in trac if there is no discussion necessary.

If somebody wants to help me, request a shared access at harald.schilly`@`gmail.com and delete a row after you have processed it.
