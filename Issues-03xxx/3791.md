```
I was told that this line means that altivec was not detected.
For atlas on linux ppc with altivec, we should use the options
--cflags='-mregnames' -D c -DATL_AVgcc
for configure ( http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/errata.html#G4gcc ).

With these options, I had "Vector ISA Extension configured as  AltiVec (1,2)".

Best regards,
Bin

Frankly, I'd say we don't care about such systems...
And from the ticket description it just seems that ATLAS won't be optimized on such systems but would still build.

Is this for your project of building a last tiger ppc binary?
