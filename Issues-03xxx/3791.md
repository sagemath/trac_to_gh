```
I was told that this line means that altivec was not detected.
For atlas on linux ppc with altivec, we should use the options
--cflags='-mregnames' -D c -DATL_AVgcc
for configure ( http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/errata.html#G4gcc ).

With these options, I had "Vector ISA Extension configured as  AltiVec (1,2)".

Best regards,
Bin
