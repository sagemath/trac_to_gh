William said at Sage Days 9 that he wanted better adaptive rendering.  So I did it.  

It actually looks much better by default.  Better enough that I don't think users will have to touch plot_points anymore.

And it runs just as fast.

slabbe and I have some suggestions that we are submitting as trac_3813-review.patch. Most are documentation edits. Two noteworthy changes:

1. Below data is a list of floats since that is the output of var_and_list_of_values:

```
3632		        x, data = var_and_list_of_values(xrange, plot_points) 
3633	- 	        data = list(data) 
```

2. Lines 3683--3699: We moved the adaptive refinement algorithm into a standalone function and added documentation and doctests for it. It's an interesting enough function that a user might want to play with it.

(sage-adaptive-plot.patch needs to be applied first.)

REVIEW:

* watch out -- sage-adaptive-plot.patch is not a mercurial patch, so no log message.  maybe copy in the message from the ticket. 

* The very first plot I tried (after applying both patches) is wrong: `plot(sin(1/x), (x,0,3), plot_points=5)`.  For me, it's missing the left-hand side of the plot.   I.e., for some reason inputting a small number of sample points results in only a small part of the plot being plotted.  This is not good.

* It seems like it is no longer possible to make a plot that *doesn't* use adaptive refinement, since this now fails even though it used to work:

```
time plot(sin(1/x), (x,-1,3),plot_points=10000, plot_division=0)
```
Thus you've broken all code that uses plot_division.  You need to either support plot_division (why not??), or at the worst put in a deprecation warning.  If you do deprecation, see `rings/polynomial/polynomial_ring_constructor.py` for an example of how to do this using the warnings.warn function in the warnings module. 

* The default option for adaptive_tolerance is not giving in the docstring, but is 0.01.  It should be given here (which appears in two places in the file now):

```
        adaptive_tolerance -- how large a difference should be before the
                              adaptive refinement code considers it significant.
                              This depends on the interval you use by default.

```

* This line in adaptive_refinement has a bug:

```
    x = (p1[0] + p2[0])/2
```
In particular, if you make p1[0] and p2[0] both Python int's then you can easily get a completely wrong answer.  You must coerce the entries of the pi's to floats first or replace 2 by 2.0.  For example:

```
from sage.plot.plot import adaptive_refinement
a = adaptive_refinement(sin, (int(0),1), (int(1),1), 0.01)
b = adaptive_refinement(sin, (0,1), (1,1), 0.01)
a == b
///
False
```
Same comments about

```
    if abs((p1[1] + p2[1])/2 - y) > adaptive_tolerance:
```

I made some documentation changes and changed the meaning of adaptive_tolerance slightly.  `3813-diff.patch` is a relative patch showing those changes.

Apply only `3813-anakha-adaptive-plot-v3.patch`.

I kind of agree with these changes.  The only one I have some issues is the adaptive_tolerance change.

I had a personal debate on whether making it work like I did and what you did.  I decided on my way, so as to have a reasonable default in case nothing was specified and leave full control to the user otherwise.

In the end I don't really care either way.
