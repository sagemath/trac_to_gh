The new spkg:

   http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/was/cygwin/sqlite-3.5.3.p2.spkg

See the related trac ticket #3176. 

This spkg:

* adds an hg repo
* patches the Makefile.in
* adds an SPKG.txt (but probably not as complete as some would want, since maybe already mabshoff did that for #3176!).
  

Component: **porting: Cygwin**
