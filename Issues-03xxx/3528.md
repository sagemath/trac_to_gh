```

This is OpenSuSE 11, so those SuSE people need to get a life since they have been shipping odd compilers for way too many years. The fix in test_gcc_version.pl is to check also for only major and minor version.

The check should also happen before we start building Sage and should black list a bunch of known broken compilers.

The spkg at

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mabshoff/release-cycles-3.0.4/alpha2/flint-1.010.p0.spkg

only tests major and minor version of gcc and not tiny. It is also somewhat more verbose than the old script. 

Cheers,

Michael
