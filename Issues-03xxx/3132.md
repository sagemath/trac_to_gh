The attached code computes multinomial coefficients using products of binomial coefficients, which is reasonably fast even for large inputs.

(However, MMA is about 3-4x times faster on my machine.)

Gabriel,

please post hg patches and not diffs in the future, i.e. hg export instead of hg diff. I committed the patch in your name in this case.
