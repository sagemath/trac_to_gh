The attached code computes multinomial coefficients using products of binomial coefficients, which is reasonably fast even for large inputs.

(However, MMA is about 3-4x times faster on my machine.)

Code looks good, but the doctest fails on a 32-bit platform (due to #3134).  Either the doctest needs to be changed to use smaller numbers, or #3134 needs to be fixed.

Looks good.  Thanks for fixing the doctest, and sorry it took so long to re-review.

Apply only the second patch.

Merged in Sage 3.0.4.alpha0

Gabriel,

please post hg patches and not diffs in the future, i.e. hg export instead of hg diff. I committed the patch in your name in this case.

Cheers,
