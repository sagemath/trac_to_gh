The attached code computes multinomial coefficients using products of binomial coefficients, which is reasonably fast even for large inputs.

(However, MMA is about 3-4x times faster on my machine.)

Code looks good, but the doctest fails on a 32-bit platform (due to #3134).  Either the doctest needs to be changed to use smaller numbers, or #3134 needs to be fixed.
