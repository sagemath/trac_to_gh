Say, I want to define a multigraph with selfloops, and edge labels..
One way to do this is:

import networkx
G=networkx.XDiGraph(selfloops=True,multiedges=True)
for i in range(3): G.add_node(i)
for i in [(1,1,'hola'),(1,1,'hi'),(1,2,'two'),(1,2,'dos'),
(2,1,'one')]: G.add_edge(i)
G=DiGraph(G)

Now, I would be tempted to just do the following:
G=DiGraph({1:{1:'hola',1:'hi',2:'two',2:'dos'},2:{1:'one'}},
loops=True, multiedges=True)

or trying

import networkx
G=networkx.XDiGraph({1:{1:'hola',1:'hi',2:'two',2:'dos'},2:{1:'one'}},
selfloops=True, multiedges=True)

But in each case  I get:

G.edges()

(1, 1, 'h'), (1, 1, 'i'), (1, 2, 'd'), (1, 2, 'o'), (1, 2, 's'), (2,
1,
'o'), (2, 1, 'n'), (2, 1, 'e')]


Which is not as intended for two reasons:  One is that the labels are
wrong, and the other one is that it created three edges from 1 to 2.

```
For a digraph with multiple edges and labels, one must provide a list
within the dictionary:

sage: G=DiGraph({1:{1:['hola','hi'], 2:['two','dos']},2:{1:['one']}},
loops=True, multiedges=True)
sage: G.edges()
[(1, 1, 'hi'), (1, 1, 'hola'), (1, 2, 'dos'), (1, 2, 'two'), (2, 1,
