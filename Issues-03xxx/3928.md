```
Say, I want to define a multigraph with selfloops, and edge labels..
One way to do this is:

import networkx
G=networkx.XDiGraph(selfloops=True,multiedges=True)
for i in range(3): G.add_node(i)
for i in [(1,1,'hola'),(1,1,'hi'),(1,2,'two'),(1,2,'dos'),
(2,1,'one')]: G.add_edge(i)
G=DiGraph(G)

Now, I would be tempted to just do the following:
G=DiGraph({1:{1:'hola',1:'hi',2:'two',2:'dos'},2:{1:'one'}},
loops=True, multiedges=True)

or trying

import networkx
G=networkx.XDiGraph({1:{1:'hola',1:'hi',2:'two',2:'dos'},2:{1:'one'}},
selfloops=True, multiedges=True)

But in each case  I get:

G.edges()

(1, 1, 'h'), (1, 1, 'i'), (1, 2, 'd'), (1, 2, 'o'), (1, 2, 's'), (2,
1,
'o'), (2, 1, 'n'), (2, 1, 'e')]


Which is not as intended for two reasons:  One is that the labels are
wrong, and the other one is that it created three edges from 1 to 2.

This is an error in input. I don't know how well the documentation explains this, but a dict-of-dicts representing a graph with multi-edges requires that the entries of the inner dicts be lists. That is the syntax. So if the documentation doesn't explain this carefully, it needs to.

The behavior you are getting is *exactly* as intended.

Indeed, the following works:

```
sage: G=DiGraph({1:{1:['hola','hi'], 2:['two','dos']},2:{1:['one']}}, loops=True, multiedges=True)
sage: G.edges()
[(1, 1, 'hi'), (1, 1, 'hola'), (1, 2, 'dos'), (1, 2, 'two'), (2, 1, 'one')]

As per Robert's comment and the suggestion on sage-devel to add documentation, I'm reopening this to add the following to the documentation:

```
For a digraph with multiple edges and labels, one must provide a list
within the dictionary:

sage: G=DiGraph({1:{1:['hola','hi'], 2:['two','dos']},2:{1:['one']}},
loops=True, multiedges=True)
sage: G.edges()
[(1, 1, 'hi'), (1, 1, 'hola'), (1, 2, 'dos'), (1, 2, 'two'), (2, 1,
'one')]
```

This is a *new* ticket - don't reopen closed tickets and reuse them for something related.
