Dear All,

I just tried making a symlink to sage and it broke because it defaults
to using $0 to work out where SAGE_DIR is.  I'd like to propose a
small change that allows symlinks to be used:

---------------------------
THE FILE: is the shell script called sage in the root of the install
tree and which starts:

#!/bin/sh

# Set SAGE_ROOT to the location of the sage install.
SAGE_ROOT="....."

CUR="`pwd`"   # save the current directory, so can change back after
startup

if [ "$SAGE_ROOT" = "....." ];  then
    SAGE_ROOT=`echo "$0" | sed -e 's/....$//g'`
-----------------------------
BEFORE:  The line I'd like to change is:

    SAGE_ROOT=`echo "$0" | sed -e 's/....$//g'`

----------------------------
AFTER:

    SAGE_ROOT=`readlink -f "$0"` 2>/dev/null || \
    SAGE_ROOT=`realpath    "$0"` 2>/dev/null || \
    SAGE_ROOT="$0"

    SAGE_ROOT="${SAGE_ROOT%/*}/"

--------------------------
DISCUSSION:
readlink -f  and  realpath do the same thing - they get a clean path
free of relative components and symlinks.

The reason for trying both is that some systems have only the one or
the other.  Trying raw $0 is there as a last resort just in case.
Don't want to break any existing installs!

The final line does -almost- the same as the sed.  The sed removes
four characters (sage), the new code removes the file part of the
path.  Debatable but it's a bit quicker than spawning a sed process
and allows for name changes.  You never know.. it might become
fennel.  All right, this part of the argument is pretty weak!

But the upside is that I can now make symlinks to sage and everything
works dandy, which it didn't before.

Have fun!

And sorry about not using [code] tags .. I couldn't find the button!
(wimp)
