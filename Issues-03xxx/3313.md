- `INPUT` section of the doc is missing

- such function would better accept matrices from `SL(m, Z/NZ)` (in which case the `N` argument should be optional)

```
sage: A = matrix(Zmod(7), 2, [1,0,0,1])
sage: L = lift_for_SL(A, 7)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: unsupported operand parent(s) for *: 'Full MatrixSpace of 2 by 2 dense matrices over Ring of integers modulo 7' and 'Full MatrixSpace of 2 by 2 dense matrices over Rational Field'
```

- you are using inverses `~U * ~W * Cpp * ~X * ~V` but at least two of them are trivial (`W` and `X`). Why not constructing the inverses directly?

- The matrix `Ap` is constructed but not used

- in the matrix `D = U * A * V` you seem to be using only the diagonal terms. Would be smarter to compute only them (that would result in computing `n` terms instead of `n^2`).

- the call to `C = lift_for_SL(Cp, N)` is making the function recursive. But `Cp` is a diagonal matrix, case for which the lifting is trivial.

Though I did not give a try. Perhaps you want me to?

Instead of

```
    diag = diagonal_matrix([-1] + [1] * (m - 1))
    if U.det() == -1:
        U = diag * U
    if V.det() == -1:
        V = V * diag
```
wouldn't

```
    if U.det() * V.det() == -1:
        diag = diagonal_matrix([-1] + [1] * (m - 1))
        U = diag * U
```
be ok?

I would rather not spend a too large amount of time on that ticket. I would prefer to have feedback on #22397, potentially useful for my research.

Smith form of a diagonal matrix may not be totally trivial:

```
sage: m = diagonal_matrix(ZZ,[2*2*3,2*3*5,2*3*5*7])
sage: m.smith_form()

(
[  6   0   0]  [  1   0   1]  [-17   0 -35]
[  0  30   0]  [  0   1   0]  [  0   1   0]
[  0   0 420], [-35   0 -34], [  1   0   2]
)
```

- What about input matrices being defined over `ZZ/N ZZ`? (see also [This is the Trac macro *comment:14* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#comment:14-macro)) 

- Could you add some random tests

```
sage: for _ in range(100):
....:     d = randint(0, 10)
