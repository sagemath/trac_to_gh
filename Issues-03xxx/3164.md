For certain well-conditioned floating-point matrices with entries in ComplexField, echelon_form can return matrices which are not in (approximate) echelon_form.   This breaks methods like rank(), right_solve() and inverse().  I've attached a sample matrix which illustrates this 

```

sage: A.parent()

This bug is probably related to #2256 and #1132 but there the problem with echelon_form is more subtle (1 entries on the diagonal which aren't quite 1), which is why I opened this new ticket.
