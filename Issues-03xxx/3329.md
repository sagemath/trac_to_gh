Consider this example:

```
  R.<a,b> = NumberField(x^2-3,'g').extension(x^2-7,'h')[]
  h = R.base_ring().gen()    
  S.<y> = R.fraction_field()[]
  xgcd(y^2, a*h*y+b) 
```
(reported by GaÃ«tan Bisson here: http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support/browse_thread/thread/5338608bd7508b00/cd1d6555592e472f#cd1d6555592e472f)

This fails because it tries to use Singular to take the gcd of multivariate polynomials over a relative number field, and Singular does not support relative number fields.  However, the error message is quite poor; it would be better if it failed with a better error message.

See also #3330, which is about the exact same test case, but requests a working implementation of GCD (rather than just a better error message).

This seems to work now because we avoid Singular

```
sage: R.<a,b> = NumberField(x^2-3,'g').extension(x^2-7,'h')[]
sage: h = R.base_ring().gen()
sage: S.<y> = R.fraction_field()[]
sage: xgcd(y^2, a*h*y+b)
(49*a^4*b^2/(343*a^6), 1, ((-1)/(h*a))*y + 49*a^4*b/(343*a^6))
```

Carl, any thoughts on this?

Since Carl's not involved any more, and this now works fine (in sage-4.3.1.rc0 too), I'm closing this as fixed:
