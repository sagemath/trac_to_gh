Sorry that i was unable to look at this earlier. I'll wait for a patch based on a more recent sage-version before writing a full review.

Note, however, that patch 10104 doesn't do what it is supposed to do. 

The doc-string says:
Returns a *list of triples* consisting of [base field, dimension, irreducibility], 
for each of the Meataxe composition factors modules.

But it only returns a list, as can be seen in the example from the doc-string:

```
sage: G.module_composition_factors() 
[Finite Field of size 7, 2, True] 
```

The reason is the line 896:

`L = L + [sage_eval(gap.eval("MCF.field")), eval(gap.eval("MCF.dimension")), sage_eval(gap.eval("MCF.IsIrreducible"))]`

which should be

`L = L + [This is the Trac macro *sage_eval* that was inherited from the migration called with arguments (gap.eval)](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#sage_eval-macro)`

The patch applies cleanly to SAGE Version 3.1.alpha0, Release Date: 2008-08-01. It seems to do what it is supposed to do, and the doc-tests for matrix_group.py pass.

Therefore, i recommend inclusion of the patch.

However, i would be glad about "stronger" examples.


* Is there an example for `as_permutation_group` where the option `method="smaller"` actually yields a smaller result? Then it would be nice to include such example.


* It would be nice to see an example where `module_composition_factors` yields a non-trivial decomposition. Such as here:

```
sage: F=GF(3);MS=MatrixSpace(F,4,4)
sage: M=MS(0)
sage: M[0,1]=1;M[1,2]=1;M[2,3]=1;M[3,0]=1
sage: G.module_composition_factors()

[[Finite Field of size 3, 1, True],
 [Finite Field of size 3, 1, True],
 [Finite Field of size 3, 2, True]]
```

Cc to Michael Abshoff.

I understand that Gap uses a randomized algorithm when getting method="smaller". Hence, if one wants to show the full functionality of a method to the user (which i find important!), one can not avoid to have #random in the doc-tests.

Michael, what do you think?

I think: 
* Starting with 3.1.alpha0, applying patch 10128 and then applying patch 10129 works.
* The methods are useful.
* The doc-string shows the functionality
* The doc-tests pass
Hence i give it a positive review, but make it dependent on Michael's opinion on random doc-tests and/or on the idea to use current_randstate().set_seed_gap().

David,

no need to CC me, I read every ticket anyway. 

About randomness: GAP should behave deterministically unless there is a third rng we do not know about. For now it seems fine to add the #random to the doctests, but you might want to raise the issue on sage-devel so that Carl Witty can give his input on the problem.

Cheers,

The last patch 10130 is a docstring change only. 

Following Michael Abshoff's suggestion, I emailed sage-devel and mentioned the problem I was having with the random comments. It seems I was using the current_randstate().set_seed_gap() command incorrectly for the situation. I added some set_random_seed(n) statements (where n is chosen in a specific way) and removed the "# random output" comments. I did multiple test passes and this seems to work each time now.

Hopefully, with 10130, everyone is okay with this now.
