Sorry that i was unable to look at this earlier. I'll wait for a patch based on a more recent sage-version before writing a full review.

Note, however, that patch 10104 doesn't do what it is supposed to do. 

The doc-string says:
Returns a *list of triples* consisting of [base field, dimension, irreducibility], 
for each of the Meataxe composition factors modules.

But it only returns a list, as can be seen in the example from the doc-string:

```
sage: G.module_composition_factors() 
[Finite Field of size 7, 2, True] 
```

The reason is the line 896:

`L = L + [sage_eval(gap.eval("MCF.field")), eval(gap.eval("MCF.dimension")), sage_eval(gap.eval("MCF.IsIrreducible"))]`

which should be

`L = L + [This is the Trac macro *sage_eval* that was inherited from the migration called with arguments (gap.eval)](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#sage_eval-macro)`

The patch applies cleanly to SAGE Version 3.1.alpha0, Release Date: 2008-08-01. It seems to do what it is supposed to do, and the doc-tests for matrix_group.py pass.

Therefore, i recommend inclusion of the patch.

However, i would be glad about "stronger" examples.


* Is there an example for `as_permutation_group` where the option `method="smaller"` actually yields a smaller result? Then it would be nice to include such example.


* It would be nice to see an example where `module_composition_factors` yields a non-trivial decomposition. Such as here:

```
sage: F=GF(3);MS=MatrixSpace(F,4,4)
sage: M=MS(0)
sage: M[0,1]=1;M[1,2]=1;M[2,3]=1;M[3,0]=1
sage: G.module_composition_factors()

[[Finite Field of size 3, 1, True],
 [Finite Field of size 3, 1, True],
 [Finite Field of size 3, 2, True]]

Cc to Michael Abshoff.

I understand that Gap uses a randomized algorithm when getting method="smaller". Hence, if one wants to show the full functionality of a method to the user (which i find important!), one can not avoid to have #random in the doc-tests.

Michael, what do you think?

I think: 
* Starting with 3.1.alpha0, applying patch 10128 and then applying patch 10129 works.
* The methods are useful.
* The doc-string shows the functionality
* The doc-tests pass
Hence i give it a positive review, but make it dependent on Michael's opinion on random doc-tests and/or on the idea to use current_randstate().set_seed_gap().

About randomness: GAP should behave deterministically unless there is a third rng we do not know about. For now it seems fine to add the #random to the doctests, but you might want to raise the issue on sage-devel so that Carl Witty can give his input on the problem.

Cheers,

Attachment: **[10130.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket3683/10130.patch.gz)**

The last patch 10130 is a docstring change only. 

Following Michael Abshoff's suggestion, I emailed sage-devel and mentioned the problem I was having with the random comments. It seems I was using the current_randstate().set_seed_gap() command incorrectly for the situation. I added some set_random_seed(n) statements (where n is chosen in a specific way) and removed the "# random output" comments. I did multiple test passes and this seems to work each time now.

Hopefully, with 10130, everyone is okay with this now.

iirc it was that only things that get merged in are closed by admins? :)

Yes, the release manager closes tickets once the patch/spkg has been merged. How else would be keep track of all the patches?
