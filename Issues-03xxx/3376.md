Multiplication of large matrices over GF(2) seems to use a cubic algorithm in Sage, whereas Magma
implements Strassen's algorithm:

Hi Paul,

check out #3204 which has been merged into 3.0.3.a1. The discussion about speeding up m4ri lasted 85 messages - see 


http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/aa4edc241ca4d6bb/7b928e8c28dfd4a2

The final number according to malb were:

```
64-bit Debian/GNU Linux, 2.33Ghz Core2Duo (Macbook Pro, 2nd Gen.)
Matrix Dimension        Magma           GAP             M4RI
10,000 x 10,000         2.920           6.691           1.760
16,384 x 16,384         11.140          36.063          6.760
20,000 x 20,000         20.370          -               12.200
32,000 x 32,000         74.260          -               51.510 
```
There is likely more work planned on this at Dev1 next week. Maybe malb can comment on this a little more.

Cheers,

Michael

Actually, some clarifications:
* Sage as is, uses a O(n<sup>3</sup>/log_2(n)) algorithm ("Method of the Four Russians", sometimes also called greasing)
* At these sizes (up to 8192) the difference between n<sup>3</sup>/log_2(n) and n<sup>2.807</sup> isn't that important yet (at least on the Core2Duo):

```
sage: A = random_matrix(GF(2),8192)
sage: B = random_matrix(GF(2),8192); B
8192 x 8192 dense matrix over Finite Field of size 2
sage: time C = A*B
CPU times: user 0.96 s, sys: 0.01 s, total: 0.97 s
Wall time: 0.97
```

```
> n:=8192;
> A:=RandomMatrix(GF(2),n,n);
> B:=RandomMatrix(GF(2),n,n);
> time C:= A*B;
Time: 1.570
```
* The times mentioned by Michael (and posted by me above) are (at least slightly) off since they compare a non-optimised Magma against an optimised Sage, times on the Opteron are more fair:

```
64-bit Suse Linux, 2.4Ghz Opteron 
Matrix Dimension Magma 2.13-5 M4RI-20080521
10,000 x 10,000  2.940        2.250
16,384 x 16,384  9.250        8.800
20,000 x 20,000  16.570       15.480
32,000 x 32,000  59.100       57.800
```
* In Sage 3.0.3 you get dramatically better performance but still no Strassen-Winograd multiplication by default, since I haven't implemented L2 cache detection yet. To use Strassen-Winograd, do

```
sage: time A._multiply_strassen(B,cutoff=4096)
CPU times: user 0.96 s, sys: 0.01 s, total: 0.97 s
Wall time: 0.97
```
as you can see: It isn't really much faster than M4RM yet, since the tricky part is cache friendliness in that region and our M4RM as seen some love there (see the thread mentioned by Michael).

Thank you very much Michael and Martin. It seems indeed you had some fun
optimizing m4ri! Looking at the discussion, especially when I saw Gray code,
I wondered whether the techniques we used to multiply polynomials over GF(2)
might be useful too. See <http://hal.inria.fr/inria-00188261/en>.

My initial interest was modular composition: Brent and Kung's 1978 Algo 2.1
enables one to perform a fast modular composition using fast matrix 
multiplication. In turn, modular composition enables to improve polynomial
factorisation or irreducibility tests.

Do you know if Sage implements modular composition, i.e, f(g) mod h over
GF(p)[x]?

Martin,

I have deleted the line rlm pointed out against policy in the src directory. Please make sure to fix it upstream. I have also cleaned up SPKG.txt a little, so please base the next libm4ri.spkg off the one in Sage 3.1.2.alpha3 since I saw another updated libm4ri.spkg in you spkg directory on sage.math.

Cheers,

Michael
