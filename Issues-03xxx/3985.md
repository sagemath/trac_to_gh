Still need improvement on plotting of asymptote of e.g. tan or 1/x, especially when detect_poles != True.  Ideally one has an output similar to

```
sage: plot(tan,-20,20).show(ymin=-5, ymax=5) 
```
but just straight out of plot.

Just FYI, #6035 partially resolves this.  

However, 

```
sage: plot(tan,-20,20, detect_poles='show')
sage: plot(tan,-20,20, detect_poles=True)
```
shows that 'show' still keeps the "missing" points (which include not just the asymptote but also the high slopes on either side) and that True doesn't create a uniform height as one might desire in the Description.  

Description changed to indicate this successful partial resolution, however!
