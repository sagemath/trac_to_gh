I've attached a patch (developed with Francois Bissey) that should make zn_poly have shared library versioning and build the shared library with -fPIC but the static library without -fPIC.

My patch includes the relevant changes to the Debian packaging to make it fully Debian policy-compliant.

It also includes the relevant changes to spkg-install and SAGE-style copy patches that should make SAGE use the new version, though I haven't tested that part.

In the long term, I'd like to see the patch fixed to work on all platforms and merged upstream.  It's of course fine to have them just on Debian in the short term, but it's bad for sonames to be different between different distributions.  So, I think our goal should be to fix the bugs.

Hi,

the problem is that on Solaris the ld available does not understand the GNUism of -Wlsoname as is. Check out the soname linker options for Solaris at

http://www.fortran-2000.com/ArnaudRecipes/sharedlib.html

I did not find anything comprehensive on linker options anywhere else on the quick, but it ought to do. The patch will work on all currently working platforms, but will break on Solaris and *BSD when using the default linker.

I was almost going to blame Tim for that one, but I contributed quite a bit to that one
(unlike ticket 3306 which is mostly his if I remember correctly). 
I agree that the patches are fine for debian and linux in general but that for sage we should 
try to be less gld/gcc specific.
We need a strategy for dealing alternative extension though.
Shell variables including the correct suffixes?
Fix in spkg-install?
The problem with putting everything in spkg-install is become big and bloated.

I believe what we need to do is to make better use of sage-env. 

Virtually every package has something like

```
if [ `uname` = "Darwin" -a "$SAGE64" = "yes" ]; then
  CFLAGS = "$CFLAGS -m64"
fi
```

Lets consider what are 3 major things wrong with this. 

* 64-bit builds are possible on other platforms like Solaris, which is a supported operating system. So SAGE64 should not be restricted to Darwin.
* -m64 works for the GNU compiler and Sun compilers, but other options are used to generate 64-bit code on other platforms. 
* The same code is written in loads of packages, adding clutter. 

It would be far more sensible to set the CFLAGS once, taking into account the compiler, platform, setting of SAGE64 and other variables. 

I'd suggest that we replace all this different library names (.dll on Cygwin, .so on most platforms, .dlyn on some, .sl on HP-UX), with a simple $SHARED_LIBRARY_EXTENSION. Then set that once and for all, and people don't have to worry about it, just refer to it as a variable. 

#6595 shows two examples of what William considers serious bugs, which were only found when the Sun compiler was used. In one case, a function computed an answer, but never returned it to what called it. g++ accepted that. The Sun compiler will not. There's a lot more to be gained by writing portable code than simply getting code to run on other systems. 

#7505 will allow the compiler to be determined easily, whether that be gcc, Sun Studio, HP's on HP-UX, IBM's on AIX, and several others. Once we know what compiler we have, we have a reasonable chance of knowing the right options. 


Anyway, there is a lot we can do to improve things, but I do agree that doing a lot of things in spkg-install is not sensible. It would seem sensible that only has things specific to that package, rather than code which needs to be in every package.
