Subject says it all.  I (Marshall Hampton) will work on this if I have time; should be pretty easy.  Currently parametric_plot wants a tuple of functions; I think it should do that OR accept a function that returns a tuple.

#3313 has nothing to do with vectors.  And now, parametric_plot takes vectors anyway:

```
sage: r(t)=[t,t+1]
sage: parametric_plot(r, (t,0,1))

sage: parametric_plot(r(t), (t,0,1))

```
