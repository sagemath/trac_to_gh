Current behaviour:

```
    sage: C = CrystalOfTableaux(['A',3],shape=[2,1])
    sage: h = C.highest_weight_vector()
    sage: t = h.to_tableau()
    sage: w = t.to_word(); w
    [2, 1, 1]
    sage: type(w[0])
    <class 'sage.combinat.crystals.letters.Crystal_of_letters_type_A_element'>
    sage: t.evaluation()
    <BOOM>
```
This patch ensures we get a tableau of integers instead of a tableau of crystal elements.

The elements of crystals of letters look like integers because their `__repr__` method returns an integer string but they are not. Before the patch it is possible to accidentally build tableaux whose entries are crystal of letter elements. The patch looks obviously correct to me. I'm not sure  this bugfix requires a doctest.

I know that Dan did a review, but we still need a formal vote. Since there is a test case that Jason posted we should add it as a doctest. If it runs long we should add #long to it.

Cheers,

Michael

Looks good to me.  I added a little test in 3003.patch -- that's the one that should be applied.
