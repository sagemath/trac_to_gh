Current behaviour:

```
    sage: C = CrystalOfTableaux(['A',3],shape=[2,1])
    sage: h = C.highest_weight_vector()
    sage: t = h.to_tableau()
    sage: w = t.to_word(); w
    [2, 1, 1]
    sage: type(w[0])
    <class 'sage.combinat.crystals.letters.Crystal_of_letters_type_A_element'>
    sage: t.evaluation()
    <BOOM>
```
This patch ensures we get a tableau of integers instead of a tableau of crystal elements.

The elements of crystals of letters look like integers because their `__repr__` method returns an integer string but they are not.

I know that Dan did a review, but we still need a formal vote. Since there is a test case that Jason posted we should add it as a doctest. If it runs long we should add #long to it.

Cheers,

Michael
