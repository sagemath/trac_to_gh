Mostly okay, couple of issues:

* in the docstring, `t^d` should be `t^{d-1} `
* shouldn't QQ get this method too? I suppose this is a more general problem, it's not just this method. Maybe that should be a different ticket.
* the docstring is slightly ambiguous. "Return the power basis for this number field over its base field.": it's not "the" power basis, it's "a" power basis. Also, "and t is a root of f(x) in this field": it's not just any root, it's the root that's being used to represent the elements. Perhaps just merge these sentences.

This addresses the comments about the docstring and adds the desired function to QQ.

It also addresses a bug in residue_field that I just noticed... sorry for the crosspost.

Final patch fixes a one word type in the doctest :)

Hopefully it's good now.  All patches are "from scratch", i.e. apply only the last patch.

<a id='comment:6'></a>Looks good to me.

Patch number 3 applies cleanly to 3.1.alpha0, and all tests in sage.rings pass.

I note that the implementation for QQ relies on its gen() being 1.  It might be safer to use self(1) instead.  But that's very minor.
