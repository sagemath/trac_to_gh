I've attached a patch that completely replaces the minimal symmetrica makefile with a much more standard version.  It includes a shared library with a soname (the symmetrica version number must be maintained in the package; currently its a variable in the makefile) and adds normal targets like clean, install, etc.

This probably needs to be fixed to do shared libraries correctly for non-linux; I'm not sure exactly how that is supposed to work.

The only problem I see here is that "install" is generally not guaranteed to be available, i.e. on Solaris it is commonly called ginstall. I will fix this, but other than that positive review. I am also not quite sure if the Solaris ld can handle this as is, but as I am porting Sage to use the Sun Forte compiler suite I will fix those issues anyway.

Actually on linux (and probably other unix variants) it seems we
should use the "-Dunix" flag as well. Mind you after a quick grep
through the source only the file de.c make use of that directive.
It also has a MSDOS option there may have been a windows variant
at some point but I cannot find traces of it on the symmetrica
web site.
