Positive review on the patch. The affected doctest now passes and Mike did explain to me in IRC what was fixed:

```
[2:41pm] mabshoff: mhansen: #3592 - what is changed?
[2:41pm] mabshoff: Did you fix the doctest or did you do more?
[2:42pm] mhansen: Oh, I changed a "!= 1" to a " > 1" in the new code (which is what is should have been).
[2:42pm] mabshoff: ok
```

Cheers,

Michael
