The attached patch should be pretty self-explanatory.  When I view the documention for erf, I see 'strong{only}' instead of the intended 'only'.  I also added a space to the math expression, to try to make it more readable.  Finally, in the documentation for n(-), I've emphasized that various of the arguments are optional.



**Keywords:** erf, n, documentation
