I'll be able to experimentally verify what will work, but it's taking much more time than expected.  The problem is, every object that's databased through the SQLAlchemy ORM must inherit from Object.

I'm officially back-burnering this because 1) wstein has resolved the biggest problem that this addresses, 2) I'm busier than I expected to be, and I can't devote myself to such a large-scale project.  If somebody else wants to take the torch, I support it.

Nice idea!  But at this point probably needs to be "wontfix" because real database stuff is in the cloud and the notebook will probably be dedicated to smaller-scale solutions.
