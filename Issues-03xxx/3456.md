I'm officially back-burnering this because 1) wstein has resolved the biggest problem that this addresses, 2) I'm busier than I expected to be, and I can't devote myself to such a large-scale project.  If somebody else wants to take the torch, I support it.

Nice idea!  But at this point probably needs to be "wontfix" because real database stuff is in the cloud and the notebook will probably be dedicated to smaller-scale solutions.
