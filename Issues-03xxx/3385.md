As [reported to sage-devel](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/8f409c06fc3a291c), `plot_vector_field()` does not change the angle of the arrows as appropriate for the aspect ratio.

To see this, take [this `@`interact demo](http://wiki.sagemath.org/interact/diffeq#head-f79d3195e10d507bda57064c8b8d10d15e55a5e4) and change `xmin` to 1/4. The plotted solution is correct, but the angles of the arrows for the vector field aren't changed correctly. (Also see https://www.sagenb.org/home/pub/1794/, if it's actually loading.)

From the quiver documentation:

```
    In all cases the arrow aspect ratio is 1, so that if *U*==*V* the
    angle of the arrow on the plot is 45 degrees CCW from the *x*-axis.
```

Basically, if you want the arrows to match up with the axes in the plot, you *must* have aspect_ratio=1. (that is, unless the arrows are horizontal or vertical :).

Wow, ask and ye shall receive!  In response to a query on the matplotlib list, efiring (on the matplotlib team) added an 'angles' keyword that allows us to have arrows that are scaled to respect the aspect ratio:

http://matplotlib.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/matplotlib/trunk/matplotlib/lib/matplotlib/quiver.py?r1=6067&r2=6112&pathrev=6112

So I guess the problem is pretty much solved if we update to matplotlib svn.

I updated the matplotlib spkg to matplotlib-0.98.3.p2.spkg to include the SVN version of quiver.py that adds this keyword.  Everything seems to work great and tests pass in the plot directory.

The new spkg is at http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jason/matplotlib-0.98.3.p2.spkg

This spkg needs to be installed before the attached patch is applied.

Just do "sage -f <file-name>.spkg"
