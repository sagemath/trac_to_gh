Yes.  It takes any polynomial or symbolic expression and turns
it into a very fast callable function that has input and output floats.
It should get used automatically by functions like find_min* but
we haven't pushed this through enough yet.

Especially since before, you could always manually pass a `fast_float` function if you needed the speedup, but now you cannot disable that feature if you need the precision.\n\nMaybe there should be something like a safe version of fast float, that checks its results for `NaN` or `Inf` and if so, redoes the calculation with the original expression.\n\nI think that this patch should still be applied for consistency.

<a id='comment:16'></a>jdemeyer: sorry about the milestone change, I didn't realize 5.5 was already in the RC stage.

ppurka: if I understand it correctly, all the other `find_{min,max}imum_on_interval` functions have already been changed to use `fast_float`. So already from a consistency point of view, this one should be, too.

Of course, you still have a point. Especially since before, you could always manually pass a `fast_float` function if you needed the speedup, but now you cannot disable that feature if you need the precision.

Maybe there should be something like a safe version of fast float, that checks its results for `NaN` or `Inf` and if so, redoes the calculation with the original expression.

I think that this patch should still be applied for consistency. Maybe such a safe version of `fast_float` could be the solution to #13559?

+Yes.  It takes any polynomial or symbolic expression and turns
