Yes.  It takes any polynomial or symbolic expression and turns
it into a very fast callable function that has input and output floats.
It should get used automatically by functions like find_min* but
we haven't pushed this through enough yet.

Is anyone working with very large numbers, or is there any doctest which checks for very large numbers? Because this patch might affect the result. See #13559.

Patchbot: apply trac3955-find_local_maximum-ff.2.patch

jdemeyer: sorry about the milestone change, I didn't realize 5.5 was already in the RC stage.

ppurka: if I understand it correctly, all the other `find_{min,max}imum_on_interval` functions have already been changed to use `fast_float`. So already from a consistency point of view, this one should be, too.

Of course, you still have a point. Especially since before, you could always manually pass a `fast_float` function if you needed the speedup, but now you cannot disable that feature if you need the precision.

Maybe there should be something like a safe version of fast float, that checks its results for `NaN` or `Inf` and if so, redoes the calculation with the original expression.

I think that this patch should still be applied for consistency. Maybe such a safe version of `fast_float` could be the solution to #13559?
