I have attached a patch which I believe fixes these issues. I have also altered the reduction methods to throw more enlightening exceptions when given negative definite forms and indefinite forms.

It would be nice to implement the the handling of indefinite and negative definite forms at some point in the future, however I don't think Pari can deal with negative definite forms currently.

I am happy that this patch deals with the criticisms I had regarding #3857 (which did in fact have nothing to do with the bug which #3857 fixed, but rather were criticisms of some of the design of this class).

The patch applies fine after the patches for #3857 (and probably independently of those too), and all doctests in sage/quadratic_forms pass.
