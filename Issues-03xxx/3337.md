David,

if you take care of the GAP 4.11 update can you also do this?

Yes. (I assume you mean just include guava in the gap spkg.) Actually guava is now at 3.8:-)

A couple remarks:

* Why isn't this gap-4.4.12.spkg since this is the first gap.spkg from 4.4.12?
* An SPKG.txt entry is missing.
* changes in the root hg repo aren't checked in
* it would be nice if the exact sequence this spkg was prepared with, i.e. removal of various packages, etc, was properly documented in SPKG.txt

I am sure I can find more issues :)

Do you mean gap-4.4.12.p0.spkg? I can change that.


>    * An SPKG.txt entry is missing.


I'll fix that.


>    * changes in the root hg repo aren't checked in



I don't know what that means.

Anything else?

No, gap-4.4.12.spkg since it is the first release of gap-4.4.12. 
 

> I don't know what that means.


Changes to the root directory of the spkg have to be checked in - just run 'hg status'

> Anything else?


There also seem to be some dynamic libraries in the spkg, i.e. some binary crap. I have to recheck if they are still there, but just search for .so files.

I still don't know what this means.

Here is my workflow.

(1) Download the tarball from the gapsite,
decompress in a directory sagestuff, thus creating a subdirectory
sagestuff/gap-4.4.12

(2) unpack the guava3.9 tarball in the sagestuff/gap*/pkg subdirectory

(3) unpack the last gap-4.4..10.p*.spkg in sagestuff, creating a subdirectory
sagestuff/gap-4.4.10.p*

(4) copy this to
sagestuff/gap-4.4.12 (or .p0 or .p1 or whatever)

(5) delete everything in the sagestuff/gap-4.4.12/src
subdirectory and replace it by sagestuff/gap-4.4.12

(6) Delete extraneous stuff (such as small, prim, etc).

(7) run tar -cjvf gap-4.4.12.tar.bz2 gap-4.4.12/

(8) Rename tar.bz2 to spkg, upload, and post to trac.

I don't see where in that sequence to run hg status. Maybe I
should

(9) run sage -f gap-4.4.12.spkg and then start sage and then
run
sage: hg_sage.status()?

Or is there some other way to do this?

They are there. I think they were added for some windows functionality, but I
mostly ignore windows emails on gap- (and sage-) devel so am not sure.
I don't know basically 0 about windows, what windows files look like, or what
should be done with windows files.

I deleted these. Just to be precise - these are not part of GAP but
parts of (GPL'd) GAP packages.

I tried to make all the changes you suggested earlier.

I ran

```
wdj@hera:~/sagefiles/sagestuff/gap-4.4.12$ pwd
/home/wdj/sagefiles/sagestuff/gap-4.4.12
wdj@hera:~/sagefiles/sagestuff/gap-4.4.12$ hg stat
M SPKG.txt
M spkg-install
? patch
wdj@hera:~/sagefiles/sagestuff/gap-4.4.12$ ls
dist  patch  patches  spkg-debian  spkg-install  SPKG.txt  src
```

However, I don't know what "There is a repo in there where changes need to be check in."
means. Do I run hg_sage.status()? hg_sage.commit()?


The new spkg is at
http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/wdj/patches/gap-4.4.12.spkg

David,

you need to run hg directly in the root directory of the spkg. There are no wrappers from Sage to do that. Just read "hg help" and for example "hg help commit" for more details.

Cheers,

Micheal

Another thing I tried was a completely different workflow:

(a) download the old gap spkg, unpack it into sagestuff/gap-4.4.10.p10

(b) in sagestuff, create a clone using hg clone gap-4.4.10.p10 gap-4.4.12
(first, I backed up the old directory gap-4.4.12 for safety)
This creates a directory sagestuff/gap-4.4.12

(c) made all the changes described to this clone

(d) cd sagestuff/gap-4.4.12, and enter "hg commit" and "hg export"
I still get

```
wdj@hera:~/sagefiles/sagestuff/gap-4.4.12$ hg export
abort: export requires at least one changeset

Do not create a clone, just delete the old src directory, drop in the new src directory, fix what ever you have to do and then commit the new version before packing the archive.

Hi David,

the spkg needs work:

* delete the patch binary in the root of the spkg
* the changes need to be check in. One way to do this is via

```
 hg commit -m "gap-4.4.12: update to latest upstream, update to guava 3.9 (#3337)"
```
* SPKG.txt is in the wrong format:

```
### gap-4.4.12 (David JOyner, 2008-12-20)

Upgraded to gap-4.4.12. Upgraded guava 3.4 to guava 3.9.
From the source GAP tarball, removed tomlib, small, prim,
trans, and some pdf+dvi files from guava3.9/doc.
```
This should be:

```
### gap-4.4.12 (David Joyner, 2008-12-20)
 *  Upgraded to gap-4.4.12, upgraded guava 3.4 to guava 3.9 (#3337)
```
Then you need to add a section about special build instructions with details, i.e.

```
## Special Update/Build Instructions

From the source GAP tarball, removed tomlib, small, prim,
trans by running $SOME_COMMAND, and some pdf+dvi files from guava3.9/doc 
by runnnig $SOME_OTHER_COMMAND.
```
SPKG.txt can use some improvements, i.e. check out 

 http://wiki.sagemath.org/spkgTemplate

for all the sections that should be in SPKG.txt. If I have time later I will fix all these problems.

Cheers,

Michael

Hi David,

Ok, this is a step in the right direction.
 
> What I did (more or less) was to apply hg remove and hg add to various directories of the old repo, combined with some editing and cp'ing, before running hg commit.


Why? Nothing in src is under version control. An update to GAP should just involve unpacking the new sources, deleting some things like the dbs, adding Guava, updating spkg-install and SPKG.txt and then committing. 

> Even after reading the documentation (which IMHO isn't very good) and googling, I could still not figure out what hg would accept and what it wouldn't. For example, over-writing a file seems to be not okay (in the sense that it doesn't get recorded as a changeset) but editing a file (with emacs say) is okay. Anyway, hope this is okay now. If it is okay, maybeI'll add some sensible comments to http://wiki.sagemath.org/SPKG_Audit, though it is hard for me to understand some of what is there so I'm not sure where the best pace to add such comments.


Please post to the devel list first before changing things. 

There are two issues:

* The file patch is left in the root directory of the spkg. Just delete it
* The text in SPKG.txt needs to be true wiki text, as is that needs some fixing. The dependencies are wrong, i.e. we list spkgs that GAP depends upon to build, not build tools. All people should be listed via lists and current spkg maintainers are probably you, rlm, William and me. 

If I get time today I will fix this up and post 4.4.12.p0.

One last question: How large is the test suite? I am asking since it would be nice to run tests via spkg-check and if the size increase is reasonable I would greatly prefer to be able to test.

Cheers,

Michael

Hi David,

I noticed a couple things:

* because you did not update the scripts you are still doctesting with GAP 4.4.10 and not with the new 4.4.12.
* spkg-install has some problem installing wtdist, so things don't go to well for such doctests.

Overall we have a fair number of failure:

Most of those are cosmetic, but someone ought to go over them and correct issues, some are trivial and some are worrying:

```

```
My latest spkg is at

  http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mabshoff/spkgs/gap-4.4.12.p0.spkg

If you want to fix the issue with wtdist you ought to use that as a base.

Done. Modulo the maxima problems I have, it fails in the same way - there are lots of funny 
print statements in gap.py which yield test output such as

I don't understand the purpose of this print statement but it seems to be fairly new.

Can the print statement in gap.py just be commented out?

This is not the problem I am referring to and the print issue were actual changes in GAP's output. These need to be fixed. I have never seen the above statement on sage.math. Which Sage release is this? Do you have anything in .gaprc?

I doubt it, but you should ask someone who knowns the code better. 

This is wrong by the way:

```
     if [ $UNAME = "CYGWIN" ]; then
+        echo "** Cygwin install not supported **"
         $MKDIR bin
```
You also managed to delete .hgignore and not check in the changes to spkg-install:

```
M spkg-install
! .hgignore
```
I do not understand why it is such a problem to make two two line changes and check in the changes without breaking the spkg?

Cheers,

Michael

This is sage-3.3.alpha5. No I don't have a .gaprc. Should I?

Okay, I'll restore that.

Yes, I totally forgot it was an hg repo. Hopefully, when I check it in (or whatever - I'll have to look up your old emails since I don't remember the steps), those will get fixed.

Is there some documentation on what spkg-check should be?

> and (b) also to spell out the need to remove certain binary crap that cwitty pointed out. 

Okay.

The bigger question for me is that (if we ignore all these problems) it is not clear to me if the package passes the tests. I don't understand the "Warning: this should never happen " lines. In other words, I don't know what they mean or what triggers them. For example, your statement "These need to be fixed" above. What needs to be fixed? The docstrings in guava? The print statement in gap.py?

Sorry I haven't had a lot of time to devote to Sage recently. (A lot of stuff is going on at work.) If this is pressing, if I can't fix this tomorrow maybe I should ask Carl Witty if he could finish it up?

No, but I do not have a .gaprc and I do not see the problem. So if you had one it could point to the problem.

It is simple:

* unpack spkg
* move spkg to new name, i.e. gap-4.4.12.p0 to gap-4.4.12.p1 
* change spkg
* hg commit -m "Describe what you did"
* repack spkg
* test spkg
 
> > Two more things:
> > * spkg-check is missing - since we are now including the GAP test suite

It should invoke the test suite and return "0" when things pass and not "0". Note that the working directory when spkg-check is invoked is the same as at the end of spkg-install, so you might want to get the current working directory at the start of spkg-install and restore it at the end. 

> The bigger question for me is that (if we ignore all these problems) it is not clear to me if the package passes the tests. I don't understand the "Warning: this should never happen " lines. In other words, I don't know what they mean or what triggers them. For example, your statement "These need to be fixed" above. What needs to be fixed? The docstrings in guava? The print statement in gap.py?


The following is just the simplest example that fails with the new spkg:

```
    def version(self):
        """
        Returns the version of GAP being used.

        EXAMPLES:
            sage: gap.version()
            '4.4.10'
        """
        return gap_version()
```
If that did not fail for you you are doing something wrong since you are still running gap 4.4.10 then. There are about a dozen other problems related to printing and some other things. I did not take a closer look since it was clear to me that the spkg as is would not go into 3.3 without someone doing some major work.

> Sorry I haven't had a lot of time to devote to Sage recently. (A lot of stuff is going on at work.) If this is pressing, if I can't fix this tomorrow maybe I should ask Carl Witty if he could finish it up?


I can trivially do the one line change that matters in spkg-install, the point is that someone needs to fix the doctesting issues exposted by gap 4.4.12.

Cheers,

Michael

I am not sure if we need to make all these doctest #random since IIRC cwitty initializes the GAP rng for each doctest. 

Carl: Is this correct or was this a plan to make GAP's rng behave nicely with the doctesting framework?

And this change also makes me very uncomfortable:

```
6294	6294	            sage: C = graphs.CubeGraph(4) 
6295	6295	            sage: G = C.automorphism_group() 
6296	6296	            sage: M = G.character_table() 
6297	 	            sage: M.determinant() 
 	6297	            sage: M.determinant() # random sign (only abs. value is well-defined)  
6298	6298	            -712483534798848 
6299	6299	            sage: G.order() 
6300	6300	            384 
```
Why is the sign of the determinant of a character table random? In that case the doctest should check for the absolute value of the determinant since #random would hide bugs here, i.e. no one would notice if the determinant would change more than its sign.

For efficiency reasons, we only initialize the GAP random number generator when we know we're going to use it.  The way we do this is that in every Sage library function that calls a GAP function that uses random numbers, we put this at the beginning:

```
        current_randstate().set_seed_gap()
```
and this at the top of the file:

```
from sage.misc.randstate import current_randstate
```
(you can see several examples of this in perm_gps/permgroup.py and matrix_gps/matrix_group.py).

So if GAP has changed some of its functions to be randomized, we need to add the above incantation at the beginning of every Sage library function that calls such a function.

Thanks David,

I know this was much more painful then you had asked for, but I would claim the quality of the GAP.spkg did improve and so did my understanding of the GAP.spkg. 

I will try to get this into 3.3 since Debian upstream would benefit from the guava update and it seems like a waste of effort to fix all the docstrings again post 3.4, but no promises.

Hi David,

so far I have seen one issue:

```
**********************************************************************
File "/home/mabshoff/build-3.3.alpha6/sage-3.3.alpha6-fulvia/devel/doc/const/const.tex", line 2632:
    : print gap.eval("R:= PolynomialRing( GF(97))")
Expected:
    PolynomialRing(..., [ x_1 ])
Got:
    GF(97)[x_1]
**********************************************************************
```
This should be trivial to fix. I have also seen one box where the 

```
Warning: this should never happen
```
occurs, so we might want to take you up on your suggestions unless William or somebody else can nail down and fix the problem.

I will keep you updated as things develop.

Cheers,

Michael

David,

I have looked some more at the issue with

```
Warning: this should never happen
```
and it comes out of interfaces/gap.py. I would suggest instead of disabling the code we should do the following:

* turn them into proper warning at warning level 1 - that way we don't see them in the doctests
* open a ticket to address the problem indicating which doctests to run with what warning level so the issue gets resolved.

Thoughts?

Cheers,

Michael

As I said in my comments, I have no idea why the "This should never happen" prints are there. I said this several times, so I'm sorry if my last comment suggested otherwise. I did not insert that print statement into gap.py and don't know who did. The correct computation appears after those print statements.


I did not get the doctest error in const.tex listed in the list of failures at the bottom. That is the way I determine which failures have occurred.


Regarding M.determinant(), I get a failure unless I do exactly as I did. The tests passed for me. (I think there is a bug in abs but am not sure.)


Regarding the matrix_integer_dense.pyx failure, that just never happened for me:

```
The following tests failed:


	sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/coding/linear_code.py"
	sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/coding/guava.py"
	sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/coding/code_constructions.py"

	sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/server/notebook/twist.py"
	sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/server/notebook/notebook.py"
Total time for all tests: 2434.5 seconds
```


Sorry for the miscommunication. If you tell me what to change I will change it but AFAIK, there are not more failures that I know of that I can fix.

Well, someone needs to fix the bug. One way would be to make them real warnings, i.e. they are not raised with the default settings. But looking at the code something fishy is going on.

> I did not get the doctest error in const.tex listed in the list of failures at the bottom. That is the way I determine which failures have occurred.


That is because you did not run the documentation doctests. You corrected the same bug in some other place in the Sage library in one of the above patches. 
 
> Regarding M.determinant(), I get a failure unless I do exactly as I did. The tests passed for me. (I think there is a bug in abs but am not sure.)


As I mentioned this is a 32 vs. 64 bit issue. On a 64 bit box the tests pass, but not on a 32 bit box. Printing Python ints (*not* Sage integers) causes issues like that on 32 vs. 64 bit platforms when the value is between an in and a long.

<SNIP>

This is the result of your doctesting? The patches should have never been posted as ready for review. The notebook failures have nothing to do with this failure. Maybe you ought to develop patches in branches so you don't get unrelated doctest failures like that. I expect any patch posted for review to pass the doctest suite 100%. Anything else is an instant "needs work" by me unless the issue is trivially fixable.

Ok, please make 100% clear if all doctests passed for you or not. I have spend considerable time on building and testing this GAP.spkg and the related patches since I assumed it would actually worked while I have 10 tickets or so to fix on my own for the 3.3 release which needs to drop soon.

sage -testall runs doctests, so your claim is incorrect. The problem is that it appears that it does not (for me) print the doctest failures for the documentation. It used to do that and someone changed the behaviour.

This statement is incorrect for me (amd64 ubuntu 8.10).
Maybe it is true for the machines you test with? As I 
said, I think abs may have a bug but in any case I will
change int to ZZ. (I confirmed the type statement you 
made before adding the int, this is why I think there is a bug. Maybe the prepaser is changing things?)


> Maybe you ought to develop patches in branches so 
> you don't get unrelated doctest failures like that.



You were the one who suggested I do the testing on sage.math. You can see from

```
http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/wdj/sagefiles/sage-3.3.alpha6/devel/
```
that I am using a branch. I've forgotten how long it's been since I've gotten all doctests to pass! I will try to make that clearer in the future though.


I'll post a patch with the 2 changes you suggested hopefully in the next several hours.

I do not recall that testall ever tested the documentation and I have been doing releases for well over a year now fulltime. If you look at the check target in the Makefile you will see that the DSage unit tests are run, then the documentation tests, then the Sage library tests. \n\nSage's -tp doctests also the documentation on demand if SAGE_TEXT_TEX is set to \"1\", but that is not the default. \n\n> > As I mentioned this is a 32 vs. 64 bit issue.

Do not convert it and it will just work since abs() will return an integer AFAIK in this situation, but I can test that later. \n\n> \n> > Maybe you ought to develop patches in branches so \n> > you don't get unrelated doctest failures like that.\n\n> \n> \n> You were the one who suggested I do the testing on sage.math.

No, -testall tests the Sage library and not the documentation. I do not recall that testall ever tested the documentation and I have been doing releases for well over a year now fulltime. If you look at the check target in the Makefile you will see that the DSage unit tests are run, then the documentation tests, then the Sage library tests. 

Sage's -tp doctests also the documentation on demand if SAGE_TEXT_TEX is set to "1", but that is not the default.

It is a well know fact that Python ints can print differently on 32 and 64 bit platforms and that the difference is the extra L in certain cases on 32 bit boxen. I have pointed that out twice before.

No, this is Python behavior since you convert it to a Python int. Do not convert it and it will just work since abs() will return an integer AFAIK in this situation, but I can test that later.

I do not merge *any* patch which causes doctest failures and the 3.3.alpha6 binary I posted doctested perfect on sage.math when I bdisted. As I pointed out in the release notes in 

  http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/48b893e904634273#

you needed to apply a patch to work around a relocation issue which everyone triggers when they use a binary, but I discovered that afterwards:

```
Merging for rc0 has already started and one bug made it into alpha6 
that can cause cloning to fail has been resolved. So please pull in 
the fix below 
#5205: Michael Abshoff: Set "# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-" encoding for 
sage/server/notebook/template.py [Reviewed by Mike Hansen] 
in case you run into trouble cloning. It also happens when you move 
the tree.
```

If you look at the ticket it clearly outlines the doctest failure related to the notebook you saw. The other six alphas doctested perfect out of the box on sage.math.

Ok.

Yes, someone changed the printing for the documentation failures in sage -testall. It used to work but maybe that was long ago.


I'm attaching a patch which makes the change to const.tex 
you told me to make. I cannot get it to apply though and 
don't know what I did wrong.

> Do not convert it and it will just work since abs() will 
> return an integer AFAIK in this situation, but I can 
> test that later. 



This is again incorrect but you have now told me directly twice 
to do this, so I will do as you say. The 5th patch does 
exactly as you instructed. Because this does not work (as I 
also said at least twice now), I get more failures.


So, I will leave this as "needs work" since there is nothing 
else I know how to to fix this.


If anything, one thing this process of testing both on my 
phenom ubuntu 8.10 machine and sage.math has given me is a 
much greater appreciation for the frustrations you go 
through dealing with all the architectures you do!!




```



The following tests failed:                                                                                                                           


        sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/coding/linear_code.py"
        sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/coding/guava.py"      
        sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/coding/code_constructions.py"
        sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/server/notebook/worksheet.py"
        sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/server/notebook/template.py" 
        sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/server/notebook/avatars.py"  
        sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/server/notebook/cell.py"     
        sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/server/notebook/twist.py"    
        sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/server/notebook/notebook.py" 
        sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/graphs/graph.py"             
Total time for all tests: 2434.6 seconds

```

I did not apply the 5204 patch as I wasn't sure how that 
should be applied not that supposedly a clone (or is it?) 
was already seemingly created.

Yes, it must have been broken for a long, long time. In 3.4 the documentation will be inside the devel tree, so the issue will be moot.

Check the repo, -sdist changes the version number.

Ok, this is what works:

```
sage: abs(Integer(M.determinant()))
712483534798848
```
I tested with a different matrix type where it worked out of the box without the Integer constructor.

<SNIP>

If you apply the patch via Sage's interface it will be applied to the current clone only. You can always do an "hg import foo.patch" inside devel/sage-something.
