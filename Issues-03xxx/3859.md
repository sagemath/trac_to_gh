sage.plot.plot3d.shapes2.Line defines a corner_cutoff parameter.

It functions to smooth lines passed to it if the cosine of the angle is greater than corner_cutoff (why??? - I'm filing another ticket about this).

We want to be able to turn the smoothing of lines off, which would happen if corner_cutoff = 1 worked.

Example of breakage:  (line3d calles sage.plot.plot3d.shapes2.Line)

```
line3d([[-1, 3, 369.26], [-1, -10.11, 125.33], [0.21, -10.13, 99.42]], corner_cutoff = 1)
```
A doctest sage: from sage.plot.plot3d.shapes2 import Line

```
              sage: Line([(0,0,0),(1,0,0),(2,1,0),(0,1,0)], corner_cutoff=1).corners()
              [(0, 0, 0), (1, 0, 0), (2, 1, 0)]
```
Works, but calling line3d or Line with these parameters fails with NoneType object unsubscriptable.

```

This should be better now:

`corner_cutoff = -1` : no smoothing

`corner_cutoff = 1` : all points smoothed

and smoothing is performed in general if the angle is close enough to pi, meaning
that successive segments are close to being aligned.

Well, someone is out there but they don't always have time... My only Sage time has been with sagenb lately.  But I felt sorry for your ping so I try to make time tonight.

```
The parameter ``corner_cutoff`` is a bound for the cosine of the
        angle made by two successive segments. This angle is close to
        `\pi` if the two successive segments are almost aligned and close
        to `0` if the path has a strong peak. 
```
Maybe one could add parenthetically "(and hence the cosine is close to 1)" or the like as appropriate in the two places this occurs?

```
+        sage: N = 11
+        sage: c = -0.4
+        sage: sum([Line([(i,1,0), (i,0,0), (i,cos(2*pi*i/N), sin(2*pi*i/N))],
+        ....:     corner_cutoff=c,
+        ....:     color='red' if cos(2*pi*i/N)>=c else 'blue')
+        ....:     for i in range(N+1)])
```
Super-useful!  I made it into an interact to test things, very nice.

I do have a question about this.  Why do you have to change the way this works?  Why not leave the bounds at 1 and -1 and not switch them?  I hate to say the magic word deprecation, and in any case this is just a flat-out change.

For instance, I would say that the angle is nearly *zero* if the segments "keep on going" and is close to 180 degrees if the segments change direction (peak).  So the original seems closer to my thinking - it's not the angle at the actual point of contact of the two segments, but rather the angle between the *vectors* formed by the two (directed) line segments that is in question.

Does that make sense?

I also have to admit that with #3861 that the output of 

```
Line([(0,0,0),(1,0,0),(2,1,0),(0,1,0)],corner_cutoff=-.5) # current ticket
```
is bizarre and does not look like the 2d version style in any case.

Anyway, otherwise this seems to work as advertised.  Should end users have access to `max_len` in `Line`?  Currently I don't think that's really possible.  But maybe that's okay.

Thanks for having a look. I know well that time is precious.

I have now, as required, changed back to the original convention that angle 0 means that
the path goes straight. I hope I have made no error in doing that.

Maybe this is good enough, for a 7 years old ticket ?
