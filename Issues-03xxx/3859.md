sage.plot.plot3d.shapes2.Line defines a corner_cutoff parameter.

It functions to smooth lines passed to it if the cosine of the angle is greater than corner_cutoff (why??? - I'm filing another ticket about this).

We want to be able to turn the smoothing of lines off, which would happen if corner_cutoff = 1 worked.

Example of breakage:  (line3d calles sage.plot.plot3d.shapes2.Line)

```
line3d([[-1, 3, 369.26], [-1, -10.11, 125.33], [0.21, -10.13, 99.42]], corner_cutoff = 1)
```
A doctest sage: from sage.plot.plot3d.shapes2 import Line

```
              sage: Line([(0,0,0),(1,0,0),(2,1,0),(0,1,0)], corner_cutoff=1).corners()
              [(0, 0, 0), (1, 0, 0), (2, 1, 0)]
```
Works, but calling line3d or Line with these parameters fails with NoneType object unsubscriptable.

<a id='comment:20'></a>Well, someone is out there but they don't always have time... My only Sage time has been with sagenb lately.  But I felt sorry for your ping so I try to make time tonight.

```
The parameter ``corner_cutoff`` is a bound for the cosine of the
        angle made by two successive segments. This angle is close to
        `\pi` if the two successive segments are almost aligned and close
        to `0` if the path has a strong peak. 
```
Maybe one could add parenthetically "(and hence the cosine is close to 1)" or the like as appropriate in the two places this occurs?

```
+        sage: N = 11
+        sage: c = -0.4
+        sage: sum([Line([(i,1,0), (i,0,0), (i,cos(2*pi*i/N), sin(2*pi*i/N))],
+        ....:     corner_cutoff=c,
+        ....:     color='red' if cos(2*pi*i/N)>=c else 'blue')
+        ....:     for i in range(N+1)])
```
Super-useful!  I made it into an interact to test things, very nice.

I do have a question about this.  Why do you have to change the way this works?  Why not leave the bounds at 1 and -1 and not switch them?  I hate to say the magic word deprecation, and in any case this is just a flat-out change.

For instance, I would say that the angle is nearly *zero* if the segments "keep on going" and is close to 180 degrees if the segments change direction (peak).  So the original seems closer to my thinking - it's not the angle at the actual point of contact of the two segments, but rather the angle between the *vectors* formed by the two (directed) line segments that is in question.

Does that make sense?

I also have to admit that with #3861 that the output of 

```
Line([(0,0,0),(1,0,0),(2,1,0),(0,1,0)],corner_cutoff=-.5) # current ticket
```
is bizarre and does not look like the 2d version style in any case.

Anyway, otherwise this seems to work as advertised.  Should end users have access to `max_len` in `Line`?  Currently I don't think that's really possible.  But maybe that's okay.

<a id='comment:22'></a>Thanks for having a look. I know well that time is precious.

I have now, as required, changed back to the original convention that angle 0 means that
the path goes straight. I hope I have made no error in doing that.

Maybe this is good enough, for a 7 years old ticket ?
