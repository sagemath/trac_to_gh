I skimmed sage-debian-package-3.0.1.patch and it looks correct, but I am no expert there. sage-cdd-bin.patch looks good to me. Since this patch only potentially breaks the Debian build and Tim will fix it himself positive review. It would be great if we could get more people from the Debian community to increase the bus factor on the Debian packaging.
