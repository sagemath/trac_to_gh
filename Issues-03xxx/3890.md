It appears that the // operator is supported for most fields, but not for GF(prime).

The example involving GF(7,'a') should not produce a TypeError.

```
sage: GF(49,'a')(121)//GF(49,'a')(124)
6
sage: GF(7,'a')(121)//GF(7,'a')(124)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for //: 'sage.rings.integer_mod.IntegerMod_int' and 'sage.rings.integer_mod.IntegerMod_int'
