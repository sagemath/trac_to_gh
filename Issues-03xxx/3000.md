These are fixed or have their own tickets:

* flintqs: #12428
* gfan: #7820
* rubiks: #7036
* sage: #12443

As with `$CC`, it looks like polybori is fixed, but I can't pin down the ticket where it happened.

I wouldn't have closed this ticket.  There's at least still Lcalc with its ugly `Makefile`, using `CC` and `CCFLAGS`[sic] for compiling C as well as C++, hardcoding `CC` to `g++`, and even Singular apparently has an instance of a hardcoded `g++`.

Singular (3-1-3-3) is now #12680 (**needs review**).

I've also fixed the Lcalc spkg, but haven't yet opened a ticket for that.
