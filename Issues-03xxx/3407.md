I am seeing doctest failures:

```
        sage -t -long devel/sage/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_point.py # 13 doctests failed
        sage -t -long devel/sage/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_generic.py # 13 doctests failed
        sage -t -long devel/sage/sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_ideal.py # 1 doctests failed
```
#3406 shows issue in similar areas.

Cheers,

Michael

After fixing #3406.

```
sage -t -long devel/sage/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_point.py
sage -t -long devel/sage/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_generic.py
sage -t -long devel/sage/sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_ideal.py
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
```

Since this patch depends on #3406 anyway, I'll add the positive review back.
