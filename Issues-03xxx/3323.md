This patch adds some better error handeling to pbuild - instead of dieing with a mysterious error, it will tell you the file from which a dependency that is missing is being imported from (if foo.pyx is trying to cimport bar and there is no bar.pxd, it will tell you that foo.pyx is missing bar.pxd).  It will also tell you if foo.pyx imports some file which imports bar.
