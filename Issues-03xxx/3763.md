This was triggered by a comment from Jason Grout on IRC a couple of weeks ago.

Currently several of the conversions that "ought to be there", like CDF(QQbar(3)), are missing.

This patch adds conversions and tests, so that all of the conversions from AA/QQbar to float,complex,RDF,CDF,RR,CC,RIF,CIF,ZZ,QQ do the right thing.

I applied the patch to 3.1.alpha0.  It worked though this message appeared:

```

Hunk #1 succeeded at 122 with fuzz 2 (offset 0 lines).
```

I tested the file sage/rings/qqbar.py and found the following failure:

The code looks reasonable to me, but some work is needed.  On second thoughts, looking at the "expected" output it seems that this patch relies on another -- the one where the output format ending in ? is introduced.  I'll go looking for that...
