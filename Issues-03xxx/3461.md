This happens in the coercion branch:

```
sage: P1 = PermutationGroup([[(1,2)]]); P1
Permutation Group with generators [(1,2)]
sage: P2 = PermutationGroup([[(1,3)]]); P2
Permutation Group with generators [(1,3)]
sage: p1 = P1.gen(); p2 = P2.gen()
sage: p1*p2

The original patch suffered from a particularly evil piece of bitrotting: since the patch was written, some change somewhere has meant that the trivial permutation now has truth value True, not False, which meant that the pushout code would never terminate -- it would keep on returning bigger and bigger towers of (empty) construction functors! 

The new patch I've just uploaded gets around this by using the `is_one` method, instead of a plain truth value test. It passes doctests under 4.4.1. Anyone willing to sign off on my tiny changes, and maybe we can get this into Sage 5.0?
