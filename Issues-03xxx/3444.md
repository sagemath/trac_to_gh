```
sage: G = SymmetricGroup(2)
sage: H1 = G.subgroup([(1,2)]); H1; H1.is_subgroup(G); H1.order()
Subgroup of SymmetricGroup(2) generated by [(1, 2)]
False
2
sage: H2 = G.subgroup([G((1,2))]); H2; H2.is_subgroup(G); H2.order()
Subgroup of SymmetricGroup(2) generated by [(1,2)]
True
2
```

The first usage of subgroup is probably not correct (according to the docstring), but it gives no indication that something went wrong, and H1.order() works fine for example.
