With the patch applied we get:

```
            The default distribution for ZZ.random_element() is based on
            X = trunc(4/(5R)), where R is a random variable
            uniformly distributed between -1 and 1.  This gives
            Pr(X = 0) = 1/5, and Pr(X = n) = 2/(5|n|(|n|+1)) for n neq 0.
            Most of the samples will be small; -1, 0, and 1 occur with
            probability 1/5 each.  But we also have a small but
            non-negligible proportion of ``outliers''; Pr(|X| >= n) = 4/(5n),
            so for instance, we expect that |X| >= 1000 on one in
            1250 samples.
