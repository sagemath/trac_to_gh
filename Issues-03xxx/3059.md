AFAIK, it is impossible to sniff localhost without being root.  This is not necessarily the case in Windows.  We should get a security expert to weigh in on this issue.

First patch appears to be completely orthogonal to the issue -- it seems to globally replace SAGE with Sage.  Specifically, if the second patch is not given a positive review soon, please split the first into a new ticket to avoid bitrot.

Second patch appears fine (modulo the security discussion) but I haven't tested it and won't until  Wednesday or later.

Comments:

1. In UNIX (linux and OS X) one definitely cannot sniff localhost unless one's system is purposely seriously misconfigured.

2. Windows is not relevant at this point, since there is no native notebook server under windows.  

3. Boothby's comment that "First patch appears to be completely orthogonal to the issue -- it seems to globally replace SAGE with Sage." isn't right.  That patch (1) makes the case change, and (2) adds a template parameter.  Both patches need to be applied.

4. Timothy Clemans did thoroughly test out the patch and found no bugs particularly caused by the patch, according to his remarks on irc.
