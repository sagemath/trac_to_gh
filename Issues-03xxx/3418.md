<a id='comment:2'></a>Hi Anne,

The one thing I would change is that instead of returning the string "Tableaux is not rectangular" is raising a ValueError with that message.  Also, could you add a line before "EXAMPLES" in "def s("?

Other than that, it looks good to go in.

<a id='comment:3'></a>Oh, the doctest for the ValueError would look something like this:

```
sage: t = Tableau([[1,2],[2]]) 
sage: t.promotion(3) 
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: Tableaux is not recutangular
