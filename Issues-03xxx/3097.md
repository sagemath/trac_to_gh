}
```
If one uses pbuild to build the Sage library the files from the scripts section are not copied into $SAGE_ROOT/local/bin:

```
      scripts = ['sage/dsage/scripts/dsage_worker.py',
                 'sage/dsage/scripts/dsage_setup.py',
                 'spkg-debian-maybe',
                ],
```
Ergo DSage's doctest just hang at 0% CPU use.

Cheers,

Michael

The patches will not work as is:

* this patchset, especially the bit to setup.py will break slowbuild
* the scripts repo will be broken once you -sdist
* what happens on clone

This is as-is not going into 3.0.1 :(.

Cheers,

Michael

1) The patchset should not break slowbuild (infact the change to slowbuild should fix it for the scripts repo).
2) I don't understand why -sdist is going to break the scripts repo.  I added the files to the hg scripts repo, why will sdist break this?
3) the dsage/web directory is a link to devel/sage/...... so it will keep pointing at the right target on clone.
