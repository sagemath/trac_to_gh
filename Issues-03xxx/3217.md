There are currently *serious* problems with the computation of cuspidal subspaces on GammaH. Here's something fairly horrifying:

```
sage: M = ModularSymbols(GammaH(25,[6])) ; S = M.cuspidal_subspace() ; S
sage: S
Modular Symbols subspace of dimension 3 of Modular Symbols space of dimension 11 for Congruence Subgroup Gamma_H(25) with H generated by [6] of weight 2 with sign 0 and over Rational Field
sage: sage.modular.dims.dimension_cusp_forms_H(GammaH(25,[6]),2)
0
sage: S.decomposition()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
<type 'exceptions.ArithmeticError'>       Traceback (most recent call last)
...
<type 'exceptions.ArithmeticError'>: subspace is not invariant under matrix

sage: S.basis_matrix()
[ 1 -1  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0]
[ 0  0  1  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0]
[ 0  0  0  0  0  0  0  1  0  0 -1]
sage: S.basis_matrix() * M.hecke_matrix(2)
[ 1 -1  2  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0]
[ 0  0 -1  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0]
[ 0  0 -2  1  0  0 -1  0  0  0  0]
```

Notice that at the bottom there, the cuspidal subspace isn't invariant under the Hecke operator T_2. Of course, that's because the cuspidal subspace should be 0. The problem was in the `_reduce_cusp` function -- basically the algorithm there had a number of problems. After some doing, I came up with a new algorithm that worked. (This isn't terribly hard, but is very delicate.) Of course, after writing the algorithm, I realized that we don't even need it -- we can just write `is_gamma_h_equiv` the same way we do the other congruence subgroups, because we have an explicit condition on when two cusps are equivalent. However, I left the code in for `_reduce_cusp` ... I don't know what one might use it for, but hey, it's already written. At the very least, it lets you compute the cusps in two distinct ways, which is always reassuring. 

I've run a bunch of consistency checks, so I feel pretty confident about this code. In particular, we get the same answers for `GammaH(N,[])` and `Gamma1(N)` for `N` up to about 100, and I checked (via consistency checks and checking dimensions against the dimension formulas in `sage.modular.dims` for spaces of modular symbols) on what I thought was a "representative set" of examples. That said, these bugs have been around for a while now -- so I'm happy to have the referee give this code a serious thrashing, and see if anything comes up. 

I haven't worked too hard at optimizing any of this code -- I'm much more concerned with getting correct code in right away. I'm happy to file a ticket saying "optimize this," which I'll take care of in the next few weeks. We should also probably file a ticket that says "look over `_reduce_coset`" -- that code looks very similar to where this code started, so it's possibly producing some funky answers, too.

Since sage is actually producing wrong answers (as opposed to just throwing errors), I'm listing this as a blocker for 3.0.2.

The patch applies cleanly to 3.0.2 and passes doctests.

I have not tested the code apart from the above (and below).  I do approve of the philosophy outlined, namely to rely on an equivalence test rather than a reduction to normal form, since the latter is notoriously hard to get right.  But I see no harm in keeping cusp reduction in there.

Shouldn't there be an additional doctest showing that the specific reported problem is now solved:  even

```
sage: ModularSymbols(GammaH(25,[6])).cuspidal_subspace().dimension()
0
```
perhaps?

Merged in Sage 3.0.3.alpha0.

I would definitely merge an added doctest patch that tests the original issue even assuming it is already covered by the new doctests.
