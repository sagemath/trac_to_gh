The improvement at #3620 is significant, but NTL does have minimal polynomial computations, though provided in http://www.shoup.net/ntl/doc/GF2X.txt rather than http://www.shoup.net/ntl/doc/GF2E.txt . We should probably use the proof flag to decide the algorithm. Trace could be wrapped as well.

Also, the computation of matrix() is using the completely generic code, which has got to be sub-optimal for manipulating elements of GF(2).

<a id='comment:2'></a>Great work Robert!

I added a patch that adds a fast charpoly method by the way.

Apply both of them.
