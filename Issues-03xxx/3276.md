I'm giving this a negative review - see the email I'm writing to sage-devel on how introducing more maxima-isms without serious consideration is bad. There is nothing wrong with the code (so it is probably safe to use as a patch if someone needs this feature now), but introducing code to deprecate it two weeks or three weeks later is not good practice in my opinion.

After discussion at dev1 we have decided that we should merge this but only the assume function should be considered "public" in that it will be supported after the symbolics rewrite.  The other support classes/methods will probably go away.
