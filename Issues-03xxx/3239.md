Hi Michael,
could you check, whether SConstruct.generic.patch does the Job on cygwin? Also, the first part of the cpu_stats.c.patch could be avoided by setting the predefines more sensitive in the construct file. I'll have a look at that issue in the next days.
Best regards,

Hi Alexander,

that looks like a likely fix. Right now I don't have a Cygwin env setup up to test, but it won't take long. 

Re cpu_stats.c: it looks like the sledge hammer approach and we conditionally copy it into the PolyBoRi tree on Cygwin only. Any cleaner solution is appreciated and I plan to write some Win2K+ specific patches that uses the native Windows infrastructure for accounting and memory consumption. I already did so for CoCoALib, so it should be an easy fix.

Cheers,

Michael

I've uploaded an extended version of the patch, which should fix both problems from SConstruct, so the cpu_stats.c patch will be obsolete.

Best regards,
