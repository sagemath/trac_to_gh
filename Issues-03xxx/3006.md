The following problem was reported by Dustin Vaselaar to sage-support:


Hello,
I am looking to use a complete elliptic integral of the first kind in
sage, however I'm not sure if this has been implemented.  The link
http://www.sagemath.org/doc/html/ref/module-sage.functions.special.html
mentions a function "elliptic_kc", but it doesn't seem to be
implemented in sage version 3.0, judging from the result of this
command:

```
sage: elliptic_kc?
Object `elliptic_kc` not found.
```

Any insights on using a a complete elliptic integral of the first kind
in sage?



Component: **calculus**

Clearly this is a problem with "documentation" but I filed it under "calculus" since that seemed closer. It is a matter of adding a wrapper to Maxima's function elliptic_kc.

```
sage: RR(maxima.eval("elliptic_kc (0.5)"))
1.85407467730137
```

I'll submit a patch soon.
