```
sage: var('x,y', MatrixSpace(QQ, 5, 5))
(x, y)
sage: ((x+y)^3).expand()
x^3 + x*y*x + y*x*x + x*y^2 + y*x^2 + x*y*y + y*x*y + y^3
```

This is the wrong answer (it has two terms `x*y*y` and `x*y^2`, when only one should exist; and it does not have an `x^2*y`); also, this answer is printed poorly (`x*y*y + ... + x*y^2` should simplify to `2*x*y^2 + ...`).
