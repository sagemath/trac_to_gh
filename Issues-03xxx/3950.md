This should be done in a way such that there is a template for each html_* method in notebook.py (and worksheet.py) and then the templates just use the {%include%} directive to build them out of these pieces.  This makes things easy to change / update.

For example, the topbar should be in its own template so that it can be reused by what ever needs it.  As it is now, there would be lots of duplicate HTML code floating around.
