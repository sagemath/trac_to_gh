This patch moves some of the setup code from integer.pyx into misc.memory and creates a ext/python_rich_object.pxi file.  This patch makes it easy to generalize pools to other classes, and is needed for symbolics.

- You appear to have multiple change-sets in this one patch, which may be problematic for importing (though it worked fine for me). 

- The name "memory.pyx" I would probably call it something like "allocate.pyx" which gives a better impression of what it does. 

- Why are pool_stats, etc. added to sage/misc/memory.pyx, but then commented out? 

- Sage doesn't start up anymore. It's an import error, so it looks like an easy fix, but I'm wary of code that you haven't even tested.

The problem here is that the old build system does not know about memory.[pyx|lxd] because then I get:

```
sage -t -long devel/sage/sage/structure/wrapper_parent.pyx
Traceback (most recent call last):

  File "integer.pxd", line 9, in sage.rings.complex_double (sage/rings/complex_double.c:9324)
  File "integer.pyx", line 1, in sage.rings.integer (sage/rings/integer.c:22427)
ImportError: No module named memory
```

As Robert suggested it might also be a good idea to renames memory.$FOO to allocator.$FOO.

Cheers,
