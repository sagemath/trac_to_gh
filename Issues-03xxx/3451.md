```
R.<x,y> = QQ[]
A = AffineSpace(R)
H = A.Hom(A)
f = H([x-y, x*y])
f([0,1])
Traceback (click to the left for traceback)
...
TypeError: x (=[0, 1]) must be a projective point given by coordinates
```

When of course the error message should say that x must be an affine point...

The fix would be trivial, but would it be acceptable to make scheme morphisms try converting their input to elements of their domain, first, so that the above would not raise an error?

I have changed things in the following way: if we try to evaluate f(p), then the first step is to coerce p into the domain of f.  If that works, then the evaluation goes forth.  Otherwise, there is of course an error message saying that p has no business being there in the first place.

The change is in the generic scheme morphism code, so it should work for affine spaces, projective spaces, and whatever else inherits from schemes.

Looks ok to me.  I see that you are relying on whatever error message is produced by "dom(x)" in case x cannot be coerced into dom rather than supplying your own, of the form "... cannot be coerced into the domain", but that is ok.

Patch applies cleanly to 3.1.2.alpha3 and all doctests in sage.schemes.generic pass.
