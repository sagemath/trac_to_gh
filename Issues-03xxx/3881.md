Currently we have:

```
sage -t -long devel/sage/sage/rings/fraction_field_element.py
/scratch/mabshoff/release-cycle/sage-3.1.rc0/tmp/.doctest_fraction_field_element.py:1: DeprecationWarning: MPolynomialRing is deprecated, use PolynomialRing instead!
  # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-


sage -t -long devel/sage/sage/modules/free_quadratic_module.py
/scratch/mabshoff/release-cycle/sage-3.1.rc0/tmp/.doctest_free_quadratic_module.py:1: DeprecationWarning: MPolynomialRing is deprecated, use PolynomialRing instead!
  # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
/scratch/mabshoff/release-cycle/sage-3.1.rc0/tmp/.doctest_free_quadratic_module.py:1: DeprecationWarning: MPolynomialRing is deprecated, use PolynomialRing instead!
  # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
```
The attached patch fixes that.
