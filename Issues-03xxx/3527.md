The spkg at 

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mabshoff/python-2.5.2.p3.spkg

disables "-fwrapv" on Itanium and OSX. This fixes a number of doctest failures on at least Itanium. "-fwrapv" enables some seemingly sketchy floating point optimizations that are not part of "-O3", so good riddance for them.

Cheers,

Michael

This is starting to look invalid since all failures I see seem to be triggered by bugs not normally observed on non-Itanium, but valgrind finds faults in those cases on x86-64.
