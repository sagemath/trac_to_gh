malb's patch has a stray `32bit` in it that causes the following failure:

```
sage -t  devel/sage/sage/matrix/matrix_mod2_dense.pyx       
**********************************************************************
File "/Users/mabshoff/sage-3.1.2.alpha3/tmp/matrix_mod2_dense.py", line 284:

Expected:
    {[0 1 0]
    [0 1 1]
    [0 0 0]: 0}
    '-0x21524113' 
Got:
    {[0 1 0]
    [0 1 1]
    [0 0 0]: 0}
**********************************************************************
```
This is obviously trivial to fix :)

Cheers,
