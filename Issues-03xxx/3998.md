<a id='comment:1'>Comment 1:</a>
This looked very familiar and in fact the patch is already in 3.1.2.alpha2:

```
mabshoff@sage:/scratch/mabshoff/release-cycle/sage-3.1.2.alpha3/devel/sage$ patch -p1 --dry-run -R < trac_3998.patch\?format\=raw 
patching file sage/interfaces/sage0.py
```
So, this is a dupe of #3983.

Cheers,

Michael
