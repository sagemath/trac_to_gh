I get an error with sage -t -long sage/symbolic/ring.pyx. I am not sure that I understand the patch as it seems to apply for both maxima and pari. Is this by intention? 

```

```

if I put back the Pari stuff:

```
from sage.libs.pari.gen import PariInstance

elif isinstance(R, (PariInstance)): 
    return True
```
Then everything works.

Cheers,

I forgot to remove the pari doctest.  It should also be removed since these parents should not have coercions going in both directions.

This is taken care of in the new patch.
