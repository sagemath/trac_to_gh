```

if I put back the Pari stuff:

```
from sage.libs.pari.gen import PariInstance

elif isinstance(R, (PariInstance)): 
    return True
```
Then everything works.

Attachment: **[trac_3970.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket3970/trac_3970.patch.gz)**

I forgot to remove the pari doctest.  It should also be removed since these parents should not have coercions going in both directions.

This is taken care of in the new patch.
