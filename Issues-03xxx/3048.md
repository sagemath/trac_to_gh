Couple of comments:

* in the docstring, I want to *see* the decomposition for at least one example. I want to see three matrices of the right form! Is the permutation non-trivial in that example? Can you give examples that give the code a workout? For example, get the test code to loop over all elements of S4 and construct examples with each permutation.
* does it work in the boundary cases of 0x0 and 1x1 matrices. These should be in the docstring.

Here is another try.  Next step is maybe to compare the speed of Mike's implementation and my reworking of echelon_form.

Then maybe we can change the generic determinant algorithm to use this and be really fast.
