Example:

```
var('x')
var('y')
plot3d(cos(x) + sin(y), (x, -2,1), (y, -2,1), axes = True)
```

At least one axis is in the right location, the other two...

Translating coordinates into jmol seems to be difficult, so maybe this is the reason?

The fix is to put `axes molecular` in the jmol script.  You can see the fix by right-clicking, selecting "console", and then entering the `axes molecular` command.
