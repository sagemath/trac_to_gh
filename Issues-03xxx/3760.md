Could someone with 32-bit intel os x try this again, since it is possible that the patch for #3961 (merged in 3.1.2.alpha2) fixes this.

If not I can try to look into it but I'm not sure how to as it works fine on my laptop.

The following code specifically seems to expose the problem:

```
E = EllipticCurve('389a')
for p in prime_range(Integer(10000)): 
    if p != Integer(389):
        G=E.change_ring(GF(p)).abelian_group()
```
On sage.math the memory increase is about 70 MB with Sage 3.2.2.rc0, so I have no idea how this could fail on OSX.

For the record:

The underlying problem is now known: Singular/omalloc relies on a version 2.6.5 of dlmalloc from 1998, and that version behaves bad on Macs.

In the course of the investigation, another Singular/kernel bug got in the way.

I think I know how to *circumvent* this Singular/kernel bug ("just" drop in the recent dlmalloc 2.8.3 at the place of the old version, and/or prevent omalloc's "configure" from setting the macro "OMALLOC_USES_MALLOC"), but I thought I try and fix that other bug first.


BTW:
From the historical remarks in v2.8.3 in dlmalloc it seems plausible that the old v2.6.5 is the culprit also for the bad behaviour on Fedora 9/10 systems --- but this is ticket #5278. Which probably should be closed as a dupe (to this ticket here).
