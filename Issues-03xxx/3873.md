This patch makes it so that warnings are output to stdout and are compared in the doctest framework.  To doctest a warning, do something like:

```
def mytest():
    r"""
    EXAMPLES:
        sage: warnings.warn("hi")
        /...:1: UserWarning: hi
        #...
        """
    pass
```

This patch will probably break a few doctests (that gave warnings before, but the warnings were ignored).
