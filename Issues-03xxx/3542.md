This patch implements the algorithm in my preprint "A multimodular algorithm for computing Bernoulli numbers".

http://math.harvard.edu/~dmharvey/bernmm/

It adds a few files into a new bernmm directory, a cython wrapper (bernmm.pyx), modifies setup.py to build those files, removes the old implementation of `bernoulli_mod_p_single`, and adds a new algorithm option and a `num_threads` option to the global `bernoulli()` function.

My main concern from a build point of view is whether pthreads is supported on all of our target platforms. If not, it will be necessary to modify setup.py to conditionally remove the -lpthreads option and also to #define `USE_THREADS` appropriately.

This is a standard NTL macro that Shoup recommends putting at the top of any file that uses NTL. It does something to do with namespaces. See

The layout and choice contents of the reference manual are done by hand.  If you read the instructions in SAGE_ROOT/devel/doc/ref/README.txt hopefully that will explain what you need to do.

I've addressed all issues raised by reviewer (see attached patch), except for the reference manual thing.

The bernoulli number function itself is already in the reference manual, in

http://www.sagemath.org/doc/ref/module-sage.rings.arith.html

Are you talking about adding the bernmm.pyx wrapper to the manual? It's not at all clear to me where in the manual it would belong. I already don't really understand why bernoulli() is in rings.arith, that seems pretty random.

I think this looks good.  I added a few doctests that verify that your code agrees with the pari code, for a few of the cases that William found did not agree.

Apply only `3542-dharvey-bernoulli-numbers-multimodular.patch`.
