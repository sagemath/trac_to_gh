This patch implements the algorithm in my preprint "A multimodular algorithm for computing Bernoulli numbers".

http://math.harvard.edu/~dmharvey/bernmm/

It adds a few files into a new bernmm directory, a cython wrapper (bernmm.pyx), modifies setup.py to build those files, removes the old implementation of `bernoulli_mod_p_single`, and adds a new algorithm option and a `num_threads` option to the global `bernoulli()` function.

My main concern from a build point of view is whether pthreads is supported on all of our target platforms. If not, it will be necessary to modify setup.py to conditionally remove the -lpthreads option and also to #define `USE_THREADS` appropriately.

REFEREE REPORT:

* Patch applies and works fine. Doctests pass.

* You need r""" instead of """ for some of the docstrings where you use backslashes.

```
 	75	def bernmm_bern_modp(long p, long k): 
 	76	    """ 
 	77	    Computes $B_k \mod p$, where $B_k$ is the k-th Bernoulli number. 
```

* You may want to post a patch to add the docs to the reference manual.   Do you know how to do that?

* I would prefer if there were an algorithm="default" or algorithm="heuristic" option or something that say uses pari for small inputs (up to 20000 or so), then switches over to bernmm for larger inputs.

* I found bugs in either PARI or your new code!  This happens also with num_threads=1.

```

* Wow, this patch has a really large amount of interesting C++ code, all well documented.  This must have been quite a lot of work -- it's of course the best in the world and multithreaded.  Amazing.

This is a standard NTL macro that Shoup recommends putting at the top of any file that uses NTL. It does something to do with namespaces. See

**Attachment:** [bernmm.2.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket3542/bernmm.2.patch.gz)

I've addressed all issues raised by reviewer (see attached patch), except for the reference manual thing.

The bernoulli number function itself is already in the reference manual, in

http://www.sagemath.org/doc/ref/module-sage.rings.arith.html

Are you talking about adding the bernmm.pyx wrapper to the manual? It's not at all clear to me where in the manual it would belong. I already don't really understand why bernoulli() is in rings.arith, that seems pretty random.

I think this looks good.  I added a few doctests that verify that your code agrees with the pari code, for a few of the cases that William found did not agree.
