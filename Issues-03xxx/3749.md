It appears that there is no method is_cyclic for groups in SAGE; this is a command that MAGMA does have, and one which I think is fairly basic. It would be nice if this was included in a version of SAGE.

REFEREE REPORT:

This implementation is wrong and inefficient.

1. Wrong -- the group Z/2 + Z/4 is cyclic.

```
sage: AbelianGroup([2,4]).is_cyclic()
True
```


2. Inefficient -- even if it were right, the actual way it is coded is inefficient, since once you find a duplicate you would be done.  No need to iterate through the whole loop then check a flag at the end.

I just noticed that the function elementary_divisors on finite abelian groups isn't documented, in that it doesn't say what it does.   Since it could be ambiguous I wish it were documented. 

I think A.is_cyclic() should be true if and only if every element of the output of elementary_divisors is coprime.  Given that factoring prime powers is fast, the following should be a reasonable is_cyclic function (and it's only 2 lines!):

```
sage: def is_cyclic(A):
    v = [a.factor()[0][0] if a else 0 for a in A.elementary_divisors()]
    return len(v) == len(set(v))
```

This works on finite groups:

```
sage: is_cyclic(AbelianGroup([3,5]))
True
sage: is_cyclic(AbelianGroup([2,4]))
False
sage: is_cyclic(AbelianGroup([2,2]))
False
sage: is_cyclic(AbelianGroup([6]))
True
sage: is_cyclic(AbelianGroup([15,1,21]))
False
```

This fails on infinite groups since the function elementary_divisors itself has a bug on infinite groups!

```
sage: AbelianGroup([0,5]).elementary_divisors()
...
ArithmeticError: Prime factorization of 0 not defined.
```

I think the above should return [0,5].

That said, it is disturbing that elementary_divisors isn't documented, and moreover the choice of definition is inconsistent with the one for matrices over ZZ (made by pari, actually):

```
sage: a = matrix(ZZ, 3, [0,0,0, 0,5,0, 0,0,3]) ; a
[0 0 0]
[0 5 0]
[0 0 3]
sage: a.elementary_divisors()
[1, 15, 0]
sage: AbelianGroup([5,3]).elementary_divisors()
[3, 5]
```

So elementary_divisors for matrices gives invariants d_i where d_1 | d_2 | ..., 
With that choice of elementary divisors definition, the is_cyclic function would be easy:

```
def is_cyclic(A):
    return len(A.elementary_divisors()) <= 1
```

I think the elementary_divisors function for abelian groups could be "cheesily" fixed for now by just defining things in terms of matrices:

```
sage: def elementary_divisors(A):
....:     v = A.invariants()
....:     return diagonal_matrix(ZZ,v).elementary_divisors()
....: 
sage: elementary_divisors(AbelianGroup([5,3]))
[1, 15]
sage: elementary_divisors(AbelianGroup([0,0,5,3]))
[1, 15, 0, 0]
```
This obviously sucks because of the waste of memory (a matrix takes more), but is good because at least it is definitely *correct* and consistent, and I think correct and consistent is more important than speed.  We can fix the speed later once this consistency is established and tested. 

Summary: 
1. Change elementary_divisors to use matrices for consistency and correctness, and fix all corresponding doctests.

2. Change is_cyclic to just be "len(self.elementary_divisors()) <= 1", and add much better doctests for is_cyclic, e.g, testing infinite groups and Z/2 x Z/3, etc.

* Is this statement that is in the docs still true? "Thus we see that the "invariants" are not the invariant factors but the "elementary divisors" (in the terminology of Rotman [R])."

  * It doesn't make sense to include in the docs that paragraph about how to compute the elementary divisors, because we didn't implement that algorithm.  It would make sense to include that paragraph as a comment and say -- when somebody wants to speed this code up, please implement this algorithm.

  * Is this actually necessary:

```
 	665	        if 1 in edivs: 
 	666	            edivs.remove(1) 
```
Since I think that the only possible way 1 can be in evids is if evids = [1], in which case the group is trivial, hence cyclic.

In reply to 

```
Is this actually necessary:

 	665	        if 1 in edivs: 
 	666	            edivs.remove(1) 
```

As elementary_divisors is implemented:

```
sage: J = AbelianGroup([2,3])
sage: J.invariants()
[2, 3]
sage: J.elementary_divisors()
[1, 6]
```

But we probably should have 

```
sage: J = AbelianGroup([2,3])
sage: J.invariants()
[2, 3]
sage: J.elementary_divisors()
[6]
```

since you want the elementary divisor of AbelianGroup([2,3]) to be the same as that of AbelianGroup([6]). 

I'll try to fix this too.

Review:   I have been avoiding reviewing this for ages since I hate the whole abelian groups code so much that every time I look at it I want to rewrite it from scratch, but am never going to have the time.  But that is silly.

This code (after applying all three patches in succession to 3.2.3) gives correct answers now for both elementary_divisors() and is_cyclic(), as far as I can see.  So it can pass.
