From http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Mercurial_FAQ#How_can_I_diff_and_patch_files.3F:

* If you are changing binary files or renaming files you may want to use git style patches with hg diff -g to retain that sort of information in the patch.
* If you have a git style patch with renames and/or binary changes you can use hg import --no-commit to apply the patch to your tree or use hg qimport to import the patch to mq.
