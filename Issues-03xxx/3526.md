This patch is basically empty since favicon.ico is binary and not in the patch:

```
cat trac_3526_extcode-3526.patch

diff -r c3d96fbf0f19 -r c6d839efcf8a notebook/images/favicon.ico
Binary file notebook/images/favicon.ico has changed

From http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Mercurial_FAQ#How_can_I_diff_and_patch_files.3F:

* If you are changing binary files or renaming files you may want to use git style patches with hg diff -g to retain that sort of information in the patch.
* If you have a git style patch with renames and/or binary changes you can use hg import --no-commit to apply the patch to your tree or use hg qimport to import the patch to mq. 

Cheers,

Michael
