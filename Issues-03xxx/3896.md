Hi Robert,

I am curious about a couple changes:

* the spkg contains a copy of cython-0.9.8.1.1 which I deleted. That brings the size of the spkg down to 2.1MB from about 4MB.
* hg status also shows a bunch of deleted files from the repo.
* Why the rename of ZZ_pX_eis_shift to ZZ_pX_eis_shift_p? Otherwise the patch just seems to remove unneeded variables and declarations.

I am currently building and doctesting with the new Cython.spkg.

Cheers,

Michael

Thanks Robert,

I would also suggest moving the Cython content into a src directory and having an spkg-install script that deletes the old Cython directory in $SAGE_LOCAL/lib/python. When I up- and then downgraded the old Cython did not get wiped out, so I had to delete the old/new Cython manually.

Keep up the good work :)
