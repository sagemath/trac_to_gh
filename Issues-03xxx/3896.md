<a id='comment:2'></a>Hi Robert,

I am curious about a couple changes:

* the spkg contains a copy of cython-0.9.8.1.1 which I deleted. That brings the size of the spkg down to 2.1MB from about 4MB.
* hg status also shows a bunch of deleted files from the repo.
* Why the rename of ZZ_pX_eis_shift to ZZ_pX_eis_shift_p? Otherwise the patch just seems to remove unneeded variables and declarations.

I am currently building and doctesting with the new Cython.spkg.

Cheers,

Michael
