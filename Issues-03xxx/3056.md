<div id="comment:0"></div>

The first computation of `z^2` is incorrect, whereas the second is correct:

```
sage: C.<t> = PowerSeriesRing(ZZ)
sage: D.<s> = PolynomialRing(C)
sage: z = (1 + O(t)) + t*s^2
sage: z^2
 t^2*s^4 + 1 + O(t)
sage: z._mul_generic(z)
 t^2*s^4 + (2*t + O(t^2))*s^2 + 1 + O(t)
```

Component: **basic arithmetic**
