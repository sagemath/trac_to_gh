```
The first computation of `z^2` is incorrect, whereas the second is correct:

```
sage: C.<t> = PowerSeriesRing(ZZ)
sage: D.<s> = PolynomialRing(C)
sage: z = (1 + O(t)) + t*s^2
sage: z^2
 t^2*s^4 + 1 + O(t)
sage: z._mul_generic(z)
 t^2*s^4 + (2*t + O(t^2))*s^2 + 1 + O(t)
```

so the output is not actually incorrect, just less precise than it should be. So maybe we should not use Karatsuba for polynomials over an inexact ring? (We already don't for polynomials over a p-adic ring.)
