This patch adjusts interval printing so that sufficiently small precise integers print as integers.  (It also fixes a loss-of-precision bug when one endpoint is tiny and the other endpoint is zero.)

Before:

```
sage: RIF(0)
0.?e-17
sage: RIF(1)
1.0000000000000000?
sage: RIF(0, 2^-256)
1.?e-17
```

After:

```
sage: RIF(0)
0
sage: RIF(1)
1
sage: RIF(0, 2^-256)
1.?e-77
```

<div id="comment:1" align="right">Comment 1</div>

The design decision behind this was well aired on sage-devel and I seem to remember the consensus was for this change.

The patch (a lot of which consists in changing the doctest outputs) looks fine, applies cleanly to 3.1.1 and passes all doctests in sage/rings and sage/calculus.  I did not check the docs.

I recommend that this passes.
