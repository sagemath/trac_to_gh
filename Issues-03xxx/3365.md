Michael Schmitz -- a student in Math 480 -- created this code.  It makes it so you can do %c in a notebook cell and write pure C functions.  Very fun.  E.g., 

```
%c
int foo(int a, int b) { return(a*b);}
```

```
foo(2r,3r)
///
6
```

TO INSTALL:

1. apply the patch
2. install py_inline:

```
tar jxvf py_inline-0.03.tar.bz2
cd py_inline-0.03
sage -python setup.py install
```
    

NOTE: py_inline will be a new spkg.  This needs to get into sage before this ticket can be closed.
