Michael Schmitz -- a student in Math 480 -- created this code.  It makes it so you can do %c in a notebook cell and write pure C functions.  Very fun.  E.g., 

```

int foo(int a, int b) { return(a*b);}
```

```
foo(2r,3r)
///

Do we really want to merge this as is since we are adding a new python package? Creating a new spkg for 10kb Python code also seems like a waste
