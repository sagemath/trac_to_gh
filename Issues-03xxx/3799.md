Due to the new restrictions on incoming patches, this can't be merged until all of the functions added/modified have doctests. This includes `verify_type, verify_operator, construct_skeleton, _apply_format, _apply_plot,` and maybe others. For discussion, if nothing else, I challenge `No doctest is intentional.` in `database.py`.

Perhaps this could be reworded/more specific (and you don't need to shout, I can hear you ;-) ):
