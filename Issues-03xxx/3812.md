The `__call__` method on morphisms implements the same thing already.

```
sage: psi = CC['x'].hom([-CC['x'].0]) 
sage: J = ideal([CC['x'].0 + 1]); J 
Principal ideal (1.00000000000000*x + 1.00000000000000) of Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Complex Field with 53 bits of precision
sage: psi(J)
Principal ideal ((-1.00000000000000)*x + 1.00000000000000) of Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Complex Field with 53 bits of precision
```

Thus it seems to me that  the following three lines 

```
 	337	        R = phi.codomain() 
 	338	        image = R.ideal([phi(z) for z in self.gens()]) 
 	339	        return image 
```

should be replaced by

```
return phi(R)
```

In view of William's comment that this already works, do we need the patch at all?  In other words, why implement a function I.apply_morphism(tau) when all it does is tau(I)?

Having said that, the patch does apply ok and works.

Apologies.  My original thought had been that this was unnecessary, but now (in the light of many more months of Sage experience) I can see that it is a Good Thing, since anyone with an ideal can now see that apply_morphism() is something valid to do to the ideal.

The patch applies fine to 3.4.1.rc0.  Some doctests needed purely cosmetic adjustments (halrdly surprising after 8 months) which are in the patch 3812_doctest.patch (which need to be applied after Nick's patch).

Ok, looking at all the patches it seems that 3812_doctest.patch contains the previous latest release of Nick's patch with the doctest fix by John. The credit of the patch still goes to Nick, so assuming this patch only passes doctests for me I will merge it shortly.
