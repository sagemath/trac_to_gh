<a id='comment:2'></a>The __call__ method on morphisms implements the same thing already.

```
sage: psi = CC['x'].hom([-CC['x'].0]) 
sage: J = ideal([CC['x'].0 + 1]); J 
Principal ideal (1.00000000000000*x + 1.00000000000000) of Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Complex Field with 53 bits of precision
sage: psi(J)
Principal ideal ((-1.00000000000000)*x + 1.00000000000000) of Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Complex Field with 53 bits of precision
```

Thus it seems to me that  the following three lines 

```
 	337	        R = phi.codomain() 
 	338	        image = R.ideal([phi(z) for z in self.gens()]) 
 	339	        return image 
```

should be replaced by

```
return phi(R)
```
