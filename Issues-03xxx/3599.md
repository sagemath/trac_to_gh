Answering my question, it goes in:

$SAGE_ROOT/data/extcode/notebook/javascript/jqueryui/themes/flora/i/slider-bg-3.png

This patch seems to do what it claims and looks like reasonable code, looks nice, and doctests pass in sage/server/notebook/*.py

Merged trac3599_sage_1.patch and trac3599_extcode_1.patch in Sage 3.1.alpha0. trac3599_extcode_2.patch is empty. You need to add a git style patch or reattach the png.
