**Attachment:** [trac3637-jacobi_sums.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket3637/trac3637-jacobi_sums.patch.gz)

Applies to 3.0.4 and passes sage -testall.

Let e, f be elements of D = DirichletGroup(N), for some N, and define the Jacobi sum by 
J(e,f) = sum([e(x)*f(1-x) for x in IntegerModRing(N)]).
Except in "corner cases", this patch defines J(e,f) by G(e)*G(f)/G(e*f). 
This is okay in most cases. (I'm having to rely on 
www.math.mcgill.ca/goren/SeminarOnCohomology/mycohomologytalk.pdf since my books are disorganized due to some renovation at my house, but I'm going to assume Proposition 3.3 in that paper is correct.) However, the case of J(trivial, trivial) does not always seem to return the correct answer in general:

sage: N = 9
sage: D = DirichletGroup(N)
sage: g = D(1)
sage: g.jacobi_sum(g)
7
sage: sum([g(x)*g(1-x) for x in IntegerModRing(N)])
3

I could be wrong but possibly this needs to be looked at.

In any case, here are some amusing examples which could be mixed into the 
docstring if desired:

sage: N = 9
sage: D = DirichletGroup(N)
sage: e = D.0
sage: e(-1)
-1
sage: f = D[-1]
sage: e*f
[1]
sage: j1 = e.jacobi_sum(e)
sage: j2 = f.jacobi_sum(f)
sage: j3 = e.jacobi_sum(f)
sage: j1*j1.conjugate(); j2*j2.conjugate(); j3*j3.conjugate()
9
9
1
sage: j1; (j1/3)^3
-3*zeta18^3
1
sage: j2; (j2/3)^3
3*zeta18^3 - 3
1

Even in the prime case, I think the last two outputs below should agree:

```
sage: N = 13
sage: D = DirichletGroup(N)
sage: g = D(1)
sage: g.jacobi_sum(g)
13
sage: sum([g(x)*g(1-x) for x in IntegerModRing(N)])
11
```

`3637-ekirkman-jacobi-sums.patch` adds an error (and a check=False) option preventing Jacobi sums with non-prime moduli.  It also sets J(1, 1) = p-1, rather than the previous J(1, 1) = p+1 (which was the cause of wdj's error).

Needs review.

The patch 3637-ekirkman-jacobi-sums.patch replaces the older patch. It applies cleanly to sage-3.1.alpha0 and pases sage -testall. 

I give this a positive review. It neatly handles all the comments made by Alex and I. I also like the way the error message is worded for non-prime arguments.
