Also, the polygon function should defer to this when the input is 3d points

Hello,

I got some trouble trying to draw polygons in JMol because the
function looks not available easily.
Sage is featuring the following:
point() -> try point2d else point3d
line() -> try line2d else line3d
polygon() -> only 2d
but many fancy volumes are available in 3D...

I think it'd be more natural to have polygon working in a similar
flexible way.
Something like:

try:
        return polygon2d(points, **kwds)
    except ValueError:
        from sage.plot.plot3d.platonic import IndexFaceSet as
polygon3d
        return polygon3d(points, **kwds)

with polygon2d being the current code of polygon()
```

I did a trial implementation using IndexFaceSet.  The code is really simple (and dumb).

It works with any number of points and just draws triangles as in a triangle strip.  

The alternative would have been to draw the enclosed space, but that functionality is already provided by Polyhedron and does not mimick what polygon[2d] does.
