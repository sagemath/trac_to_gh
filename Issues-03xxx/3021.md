(After some discussion on IRC) It seems that Sage is really lacking in the differential geometry area.  If some good work is done there, this request will likely automatically be satisfied.

A short term solution would be to write a vector field class.

I was just going to work on this today!

I haven't tested the code, but looks good. Just a few things:

1. Is there any reason why you're converting the variables to their string representations in `._variables()`?
2. The parameter in `Expression.gradient` is called `variables`; I think it would be good to switch `vars` to `variables` for consistency.
3. I think there should be test(s) for `.curl()` with the variables parameter.
4. I believe the `raise TypeError, "curl only defined for 3 dimensions"` syntax is deprecated, and that the string should be passed as an argument.

Nitpicking on the error message in `div`: I would change it from `"variable list must be equal to the dimension of self"` to `"number of variables must equal dimension of self"`.

About point 4 in eviatarbach's comment:
- A reference for the change in exception raising syntax is [PEP-3109](http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3109/).
-  the `ValueError` in `div` on follows the new syntax. By contrast, both the `TypeError` and `ValueError` in `curl` follow the old syntax.

More nitpicking:
- Use "Return" instead of "Returns" in docstrings, see [PEP 0257](http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/):

    The docstring is a phrase ending in a period. It prescribes the
    function or method's effect as a command ("Do this", "Return that"),
    not as a description; e.g. don't write "Returns the pathname ...".

- Should there be a docstring and tests for the `_variables` function?
- In examples for `div`, remove extra space before `w` in `R.<x,y,z, w> = QQ[]`
