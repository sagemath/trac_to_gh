`__init__`, `__dealloc__` and `__iter__` are missing docstrings and (indirect) doctests. It would also be a good idea if some of the cdef methods got some docstrings, too.

While I am in pedantic mode:

```
106	        self.l = <int *>sage_malloc(self.n * sizeof(int)) 
107	        self.w = <int *>sage_malloc(self.n * sizeof(int))

should verify that the allocation actually worked. If either one of them fails for whatever reason we will have the code go *boom*.

And `__next__` also needs a doctest ;)
