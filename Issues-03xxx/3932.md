1. Please change the `cdef void` functions to `cdef int` so that exceptions can be passed through them.

2. You can add a `cdef object G` to `__next__`. Since that's the iteration step, the speed might make a sliver of difference (maybe not).

3. `fixit = True` should probably be `fixit = 1` since `True` would inherit Python noise. You also don't need `if fixit == 1:`, just `if fixit:`

4. This is a great patch. I'll post another patch later today which will tie this into the main tree generator, and we'll see what kind of speedups you get.
