Try using "print" for a much nicer "ascii art" view of symbolic expressions:

sage: print diff(f,t)

                           d                    d
                   c x(t) (-- (y(t))) + c y(t) (-- (x(t)))
                           dt                   dt

(Hopefully the "rich text formatting" of this email works for you... or
just try it out.)

Yes, this would be easy for us to implement.


> Something similar would apply to integrals.

Yep, same with my comments.

<div id="comment:1" align="right">Comment 1</div>

With f as above, if I do `latex(diff(f,t))`, I get

```
{{c x\left(t\right)} {{d}\over{d\,t}}\,y\left(t\right)} + {{c y\left(t\right)} {{d}\over{d\,t}}\,x\left(t\right)}
```
So is there anything to be done here?  I suppose one could quibble about the spacing between the "d" and the "t", but otherwise, it already looks okay to me.

<div id="comment:3" align="right">Comment 3</div>

With Sage 3.3.alpha0 this now works:

```
sage: k
c*x(t)*diff(y(t), t, 1) + c*y(t)*diff(x(t), t, 1)
sage: print(k)

                            d                    d
                    c x(t) (-- (y(t))) + c y(t) (-- (x(t)))
                            dt                   dt
sage: latex(k)
{{c x\left(t\right)} {{{\it \partial}}\over{{\it \partial}\,t}}\,y\left(t\right)} + 
{{c y\left(t\right)} {{{\it \partial}}\over{{\it \partial}\,t}}\,x\left(t\right)}
```

I am closing this ticket as fixed. 

Cheers,

Michael
