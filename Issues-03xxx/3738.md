This set of patches pulls the core coercion infrastructure from the coercion branch, without actually converting any of the Parents over. All Parents now descent from old_parent.Parent, which has a couple of compatibility routines. 

With this in place Parents can be migrated one at a time. Other coercion branch features should be separate tickets.

That is a true accusation, though I feel there is some justification
as many of the functions are not actually being used yet so it is
hard to test them (they were being used in the coercion branch, so
it's not completely untested code, they're just not used until
Parents are converted.) Also, a lot of them are generic helper
functions that are supposed to be overridden. And a third point is
that much of this was written before the 100% doctest rule, and there
is a significant portion that is renaming/re-factoring old code.

That being said, I have strived for better coverage (and
documentation, not just tests). Currently in terms of new (or heavily
modified) code we have:

sage/structure/coerce.pyx
SCORE sage/structure/coerce.pyx: 100% (20 of 20)

sage/structure/coerce_actions.pyx
ERROR: Please define a s == loads(dumps(s)) doctest.
SCORE sage/structure/coerce_actions.pyx: 66% (10 of 15)

Missing documentation:
         * __init__(self, G, S)
         * Element _call_(self, g, a)
         * __init__(self, G, S)
         * Element _call_(self, a, g)
         * __cinit__(self)

The first 4 are methods of the RAction and LAction classes that are
not yet used anywhere in the Sage library (but code exists to
instantiate them if _l_action or _r_action is defined on the
elements). I'm not sure if/how __cinit__ should be tested.

sage/structure/coerce_dict.pyx

SCORE sage/structure/coerce_maps.pyx: 28% (7 of 25)

Mostly __init__ and _call_ methods, but since no Parents have been
converted over they are never used (and some can't even be used until
we have converted Parents). There still some room for improvement
here, and I will write some more documentation for this file.
Boilerplate __init__ functions are particularly unenlightening to
doctest.

sage/structure/generators.pyx
SCORE sage/structure/generators.pyx: 11% (5 of 45)

[we don't use this yet, other then the fact that there's a cdef'd
slot to put the generators object. If coverage on this file is a
problem, I would go ahead and delete much of this file, and only put
back things as they are needed]


That is where things stand. I will go add more doctests to
coerce_maps.pyx (though I know I can't hit 100% until it's actually
used) but I think it would be good to start reviewing it, and I would
advocate that for this particular project it be grandfathered in to
some extent for practicalities sake. (This is not the case for future
coercion tickets, which should meet the 100% coverage standard.)

Merged 

* coerce.hg
* 3738-13-docs.patch
* 3738-fix-1.patch 

in Sage 3.1.alpha2. These patches are on probation, but unless something goes wrong I see them in 3.1.final :)

By the way: "#3744 - Coercion between isomorphic parents should result in an element of the left operand's parent" is in the bundle and hence has also been merged.

Cheers,

Michael

Spent a few hours of reading with rlm.  We reviewed, quite carefully, patches 0, 1, 2, and 3.

I am confident that:

1) the new code is solid -- not necc. bug free, but fixable

2) the likelihood of this set of patches causing catastrophic failure is very low -- the sticky points (__getattr__ :) appear to be covered.

I support applying this patch and moving forward with the conversion process 'in vivo'.

    "body": "<a id='comment:12'></a>\nThank you for your good comments. I've incorporated some of the feedback in 3738-referee-comments.patch\n\n> There are no docs in generators.\n\n\nTrue. See my earlier comments.  \n\n> sage/structure/parent.pyx:128 - What is the syntax foo(bar=None, *, etc=None) doing? Does it throw away all but the first non-kwd arg?\n\n\nhttp://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3102/\n\n> Why not always pass the parent (_unique morphism)?\n\n\nThere are two use cases, the first is speed for some critical types (Integer, Rational, RealDoubleElement)--the PY_NEW needs a constructor that takes no arguments. The second is often the element constructor is a bound method, in which case the parent is implicitly already passed in. \n\n> sage/structure/parent.pyx:256 (typo) this it will always be \n\n\nFixed. \n\n> In the Parent class, why is it not the case that `__call__` delegates to coerce?\n\n\nCoerce throws a (potentially expensive) error on failure.\n\n> sage/structure/parent.pyx:256 - needs to be wrapped in a list to prevent modification\n\n\nNote sure what you mean here. \n\n> sage/structure/parent.pyx:~438 - Hom vs. hom should be explained in docs (definitions are there, but perhaps a warning)\n\n\nNot sure I understand what you mean by warning. These functions (and their documentation) are mostly verbatim from the old Parent. \n\n> sage/structure/parent.pyx:597-9 etc. - should this be a copy?\n\n\nYou're right, though now these lists aren't modified near as often. \n\n> sage/structure/parent.pyx:530-1 - why not use the _generic_convert_map here? why does coerce_list use _generic_convert_map? what is the difference?\n\n\nThis should be a coercion, not a conversion. Also, Hom could do something special here. (This code is not mine, don't want to break it now.) \n\n> sage/structure/parent.pyx:807-24 - needs to be resolved\n\n\nThis needs to be thought through some more, but I think leaving the code and comments there does a good job of expressing our intent. \n\n> sage/structure/parent.pyx:839 - what does '\"best\"' mean? (868 - will this change in future patches?)\n\n\nOne that has the lowest _coerce_cost sum, but in reality it isn't used yet. I've changed the docstring to reflect this. \n\n> Can you clarify why `_coerce_map_from_` is checked for overrides, but there is no such check for conversion?\n\n\nBecause `_coerce_map_from_` and `_has_coerce_map_from_` circularly call each other. I clarified this a bit more. \n\n> Why was coerce graph removed? :-(\n\n\nIt wasn't working. I want this too, but it should probably be a separate ticket. \n\n> sage/structure/category_object.pyx:500 WHY ARE YOU WRITING Pyrex?\n\n\nThat was old documentation, but I changed it. \n\n> All the comment blocks at the beginning of files are in the old style. i.e. copyright 2006... etc.\n\n\nLets fix this with another ticket. \n\n> Sometime it's pretty hard to figure out what's going on because there is some pretty damn random stuff with no docs or comments at all.

Thank you for your good comments. I've incorporated some of the feedback in 3738-referee-comments.patch

> There are no docs in generators.


True. See my earlier comments.  

> sage/structure/parent.pyx:128 - What is the syntax foo(bar=None, *, etc=None) doing? Does it throw away all but the first non-kwd arg?


http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3102/

> Why not always pass the parent (_unique morphism)?


There are two use cases, the first is speed for some critical types (Integer, Rational, RealDoubleElement)--the PY_NEW needs a constructor that takes no arguments. The second is often the element constructor is a bound method, in which case the parent is implicitly already passed in. 

> sage/structure/parent.pyx:256 (typo) this it will always be 


Fixed. 

> In the Parent class, why is it not the case that `__call__` delegates to coerce?


Coerce throws a (potentially expensive) error on failure.

> sage/structure/parent.pyx:256 - needs to be wrapped in a list to prevent modification


Note sure what you mean here. 

> sage/structure/parent.pyx:~438 - Hom vs. hom should be explained in docs (definitions are there, but perhaps a warning)


Not sure I understand what you mean by warning. These functions (and their documentation) are mostly verbatim from the old Parent. 

> sage/structure/parent.pyx:597-9 etc. - should this be a copy?


You're right, though now these lists aren't modified near as often. 

> sage/structure/parent.pyx:530-1 - why not use the _generic_convert_map here? why does coerce_list use _generic_convert_map? what is the difference?


This should be a coercion, not a conversion. Also, Hom could do something special here. (This code is not mine, don't want to break it now.) 

> sage/structure/parent.pyx:807-24 - needs to be resolved


This needs to be thought through some more, but I think leaving the code and comments there does a good job of expressing our intent. 

> sage/structure/parent.pyx:839 - what does '"best"' mean? (868 - will this change in future patches?)


One that has the lowest _coerce_cost sum, but in reality it isn't used yet. I've changed the docstring to reflect this. 

> Can you clarify why `_coerce_map_from_` is checked for overrides, but there is no such check for conversion?


Because `_coerce_map_from_` and `_has_coerce_map_from_` circularly call each other. I clarified this a bit more. 

> Why was coerce graph removed? :-(


It wasn't working. I want this too, but it should probably be a separate ticket. 

> sage/structure/category_object.pyx:500 WHY ARE YOU WRITING Pyrex?


That was old documentation, but I changed it. 

> All the comment blocks at the beginning of files are in the old style. i.e. copyright 2006... etc.


Lets fix this with another ticket. 

> Sometime it's pretty hard to figure out what's going on because there is some pretty damn random stuff with no docs or comments at all. (not a blocking comment, just saying...)


I tried to be really explicit with what I'm doing (especially the new stuff) but I won't claim to be perfect. Please ask if there is a particularly befuddling spot. A lot of parent is really, really old code too. 

> Why are inexact morphisms bad, Mommy?


Because they may not commute (e.g. due to rounding errors), and potentially loose information. 

> sage/structure/coerce_actions - Why are left and right different, my friends? Python?


As an example, let R be a non-commutative ring, and a \in R. Then a acts on elements in R[x] by multiplication on the left and by multiplication on the right. 

> sage/structure/coerce_actions.pyx:193 - typo "rikght"


Oops. 

> The inplace stuff needs more explanation.


Added comment. Currently the threshold is set to 0, so no inplace operations are used. 

> In coerce_map.pyx, "differs" should be "defers" in several places.


Oops again. 

> There are a lot of if-else statements which special case out things which are automatically handled by Python syntax. Is this for speed?


Probably, do you have an example? 

> sage/structure/coerce.pyx gets four thumbs up.


Thanks.

There are a few cases where input lists are assigned as is, and then returned to the user (think of gens).  That allows a user to say:

sage: x = R.gens()
sage: x[0] = 0
sage: R.gens()
*wrong*

Sorry, that wasn't clear.  One of the actions has in_place, the other does not.  Why are they so different?  Is it because there is a *= g but no g =* a?

> > There are a lot of if-else statements which special case out things which are automatically handled by Python syntax. Is this for speed?

There is some code that checks if args is not None, and then kwds is not None, and dispatches f(x), f(x, *args), f(x, *args, **kwds) accordingly.  Seems odd.
