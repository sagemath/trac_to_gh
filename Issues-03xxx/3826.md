```
javascript: encode64("")
```
AA==

```
sage.server.notebook.interact.standard_b64decode("AA==")
```
'\x00'

My patch adds a check in the interact() function. However, encode64() and decode64() seem to be buggy. In particular, they are not inverses. For example,

```
javascript: encode64(decode64(""))
```
AAAA

Rather than working around the bug, it seems better to just fix the bug.  My patch changes encode64 and decode64 to match the Python behavior (which I believe to be the correct behavior), where the empty string encodes/decodes to the empty string.
