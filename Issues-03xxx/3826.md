```
javascript: encode64("")
```
AA==

```
sage.server.notebook.interact.standard_b64decode("AA==")
```
'\x00'

My patch adds a check in the interact() function. However, encode64() and decode64() seem to be buggy. In particular, they are not inverses. For example,

```
javascript: encode64(decode64(""))
```
AAAA
