Write

```
@interact
def f(a=input_box(default='aaa',type=str,label='Your name :')):
    print a
    print [1,2,3,a]
```

Then, delete 'aaa' from the box. Press enter and the list prints like this :

```
[1, 2, 3, '\x00']
```

while should be :

```
[1, 2, 3, '']
```

```
javascript: encode64("")
```
AA==

```
sage.server.notebook.interact.standard_b64decode("AA==")
```
'\x00'

My patch adds a check in the interact() function. However, encode64() and decode64() seem to be buggy. In particular, they are not inverses. For example,

```
javascript: encode64(decode64(""))
```
AAAA
