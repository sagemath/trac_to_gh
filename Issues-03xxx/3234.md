Spkg looks good to me. I think that the core issue is with ATLAS's dynamic libraries being miscompiled on Cygwin, but we can explore that down the road. Having a working, but slightly slower,  numpy for now is better than no numpy at all on Cygwin.

I also fixed some small formatting issue in SPKG.txt. In total: positive review.

Cheers,

Michael
