The doctests describe it best, but it was the case that

```
sage: NumberField(ZZ['x'].0^4 + 23, 'a') == NumberField(ZZ['y'].0^4 + 23, 'a')
True
sage: NumberField(ZZ['x'].0^4 + 23, 'a') == NumberField(QQ['y'].0^4 + 23, 'a')
False
sage: NumberField(QQ['x'].0^4 + 23, 'a') == NumberField(QQ['y'].0^4 + 23, 'a')
False
```

Not good.  The variable of the defining polynomial should not matter.

EXCELLENT PATCH!


Request: Please stop exporting plain text patches.  Export hg patches instead, or there will be no commit messages in the hg log, and the default is to check the patch in as the person applying it.

Nick,

there is a qexport command that you should use. It will produce proper patches.

Cheers,
