The doctests describe it best, but it was the case that

```
sage: NumberField(ZZ['x'].0^4 + 23, 'a') == NumberField(ZZ['y'].0^4 + 23, 'a')
True
sage: NumberField(ZZ['x'].0^4 + 23, 'a') == NumberField(QQ['y'].0^4 + 23, 'a')
False
sage: NumberField(QQ['x'].0^4 + 23, 'a') == NumberField(QQ['y'].0^4 + 23, 'a')
False
```

Not good.  The variable of the defining polynomial should not matter.

Keywords: **number field comparison cmp**

Component: **number theory**

EXCELLENT PATCH!

Nick,

there is a qexport command that you should use. It will produce proper patches.

Cheers,
