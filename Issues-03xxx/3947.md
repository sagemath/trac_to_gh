Because we do not set some env variables at the moment we do not build Python against the readline we are building.  spkg-install requires the following:

```
LDFLAGS="-L/Users/dphilp/sage-3.0.3fo/local/lib $LDFLAGS"
export LDFLAGS

CPPFLAGS="-I/Users/dphilp/sage-3.0.3fo/local/include $CPPFLAGS"
export CPPFLAGS
```
