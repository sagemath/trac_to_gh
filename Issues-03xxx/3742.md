For the cases when we do not provide a binary Fortran compiler we determine the location of libgfortran relative to the gfortran binary. But many installs link gfortran into $PATH somewhere, so we end up linking against a non-existent libgfortran.so. The updated spkg follows any potential gfortran link, so the issue is fixed.
