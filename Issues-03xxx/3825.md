REVIEW:

* The gridlines option docstring in show is not nicely aligned like all the other ones; they also look like a mess in ClassGridLines:

```
...
            axes         -- (default: True)
            axes_labels  -- (default: None) list (or tuple) of two strings;
                            the first is used as the label for the horizontal
                            axis, and the second for the vertical axis.
            fontsize     -- (default: current setting -- 10) positive
                            integer; used for axes labels; if you make
                            this very large, you may have to increase
                            figsize to see all labels.
            frame        -- (default: False) draw a frame around the image
            gridlines -- (default: None) can be any one of the following:
                None, False -- do not add grid lines
                True, "automatic", "major" -- add grid at major ticks
                    of axes
                "minor" -- add grid at major and minor ticks of axes
                [xlist,ylist] -- a tuple or list containing two elements,
                    where xlist (or ylist) can be any of the following:
                    None, False -- don't add horizontal (or vertical) lines
                    True, "automatic", "major" -- add horizontal (or
                        vertical) grid lines at the major ticks of axes
                    "minor" -- add horizontal (or vertical) grid lines
                        at major and minor ticks of axes
                    iterable yielding numbers n or pairs (n,opts) where
                        n is the coordinate of the line and opt is a
                        dictionary of MATPLOTLIB options for rendering the
                        line.
```

* This works:

```
            sage: f = lambda x,y: sin(x^2 + y^2)*cos(x)*sin(y)
            sage: c = contour_plot(f, (-4, 4), (-4, 4), plot_points=15)
            sage: c.show(gridlines=True, gridlinesstyle={'linestyle':'--','linewidth':1, 'color':'red'})
```
but this doesn't:

```
            sage: f = lambda x,y: sin(x^2 + y^2)*cos(x)*sin(y)
            sage: c = contour_plot(f, (-4, 4), (-4, 4), plot_points=15)
            sage: c.show(gridlines=True, gridlinesstyle={'linestyle':'--','linewidth':1, 'rgbcolor':'red'})
```
Basically rgbcolor is annoyingly a synonym for color everywhere.  But it should be supported.

* In fact, 

```
line([(0,0), (1,2)], color='red')
```
lamely doesn't even work (though I hope somebody posts a patch to fix this).

* For completeness can you add INPUT: and OUTPUT: blocks to

```
 	636	    def add_gridlines(self, subplot, xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax, frame=False): 
 	637	        # Process the input to get valid gridline data. 
 	638	        r""" 
 	639	        Add the grid lines to a subplot object. 
 	640	 
```

Just make the above very minor polish as a subsequent patch to yours and ... POSITIVE REVIEW.

Support for rgbcolor added; both examples work; changed some of the color keywords in the doctests to rgbcolor so it gets tested.

Added INPUT and OUTPUT blocks.
