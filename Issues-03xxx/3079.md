The current spkg-install keep the strange default of the qd 
package. The proposed patch enable ieee error compliant addition
and disable sloppy division and multiplication.
Further spkg-install currently comes with the following strange
settings:
 CXXFLAGS='-fPIC -O3 -Dx86'
-fpic, beside being platform specific, is useless in this case
as no shared object is produced. Flags like -Dx86 are best left
to the configure script, fortunately this should be without effect,
the correct parameter being "X86". Both flags should be removed as well.
