list/iter on abelian groups does not agree with .list().

Also, list on classgroups returned abstract group elements -- essentially useless:

```
sage: x = QQ['x'].0
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^4 + 23)
sage: G = K.class_group()
sage: G
Class group of order 3 with structure C3 of Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^4 + 23
sage: list(G)
[1, c, c^2]
```

This actually lists representatives in the class group.

Apply abelian group patch before classgroup patch.

Passes relevant tests:

This is functionality which I wanted a few days ago so I am pleased to see this ticket!

I applied 3810-ncalexan-abelian-group-iter-2.patch and then 3810-ncalexan-class-group-list.patch in that order.  When Sage applied the second one I was surprised that it popped up an edit window as when one does a commit.  I just closed the window.

So I don't really know what it was I tested, but it seemed to work as advertised (and without the bug William pointed out).

Here's an enhancement I would like:  If I create an ideal class from some random ideal, nothing really happens, and I cannot tell which class I got without testing for equality with every class.  Am I missing something?  I actually would have been happy to have class group elements display as abstract group elements (as they would in Magma), as long as functions were provided to go from fractional ideals to abstract ideal classes and back again.

The reason that trac_3810-ncalexan-class-group-list.patch popped up a window is that it is a straight diff instead of a patch. Nick: Can you post a unified patch and delete the old ones?

Just one thing is stopping me giving this the ok:

```
sage: G=AbelianGroup([])
sage: G.list()
[]
sage: list(G)
[]
sage: G.order()
1
```
Trivial groups do have one element!  This special case is handled ok in the class groups patch, and a similar special case is needed for abelian groups.  (It happens because mrange() delivers nothing at all for an empty list of lists, that is one valid way of defining a trivial abelian group.)

What's bugging me is that I discovered that same issue with listing trivial groups myself a few days ago, and somewhere else in trac there's a patch which does what is needed here -- but I cannot remember which one!  So this might cause some merge problems when my patch goes in.

Apart from this, the second and third patches apply fine to 3.2.1 and tests pass.  *Ignore the first patch which is replaced by the third!*

What a nuisance;  sorry, I only did a 32-bit test at the weekend.   The got/expected are equally valid mathematically, and my guess is that the difference comes from the pari library.

Would it be dishonest to look for an example for the doctest where the output was identical on 32- and 64-bit machines?

Yes, Nick said the same thing in IRC, but I was asleep at that point.

I am fine marking those two doctests with #32 bit and #64 bit output and to get the patch in. If anybody wants to have a "prettier" doctest that can be addressed via a followup patch.
