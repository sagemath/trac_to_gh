Michael Yurko reported in http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/t/9300a4480eafd679

```
In the reference manual (13.7 Tables of zeros of the Riemann-Zeta
function) it states that zeta_zeros() gives a list of the "first 10000
imaginary parts." However, it should say "first 100000 imaginary
parts" (add a zero to read 100,000). Also, it might serve to mention
that this is an optional package that doesn't come by default.

Attachment: **[3422.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket3422/3422.patch.gz)**

This patch fixes the doc to reflect that there is info about 100,000 zeros, but I do not understand how to install this optional package, so can't write documentation regarding that.

The second patch adds instructions for installing the optional package necessary to make zeta_zeros() work.  I also changed the unusual seealso section into a REFERENCES: section.  If this is accepted, both patches should be applied.
