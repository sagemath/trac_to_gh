```
In the reference manual (13.7 Tables of zeros of the Riemann-Zeta
function) it states that zeta_zeros() gives a list of the "first 10000
imaginary parts." However, it should say "first 100000 imaginary
parts" (add a zero to read 100,000). Also, it might serve to mention
that this is an optional package that doesn't come by default.

This patch fixes the doc to reflect that there is info about 100,000 zeros, but I do not understand how to install this optional package, so can't write documentation regarding that.

The second patch adds instructions for installing the optional package necessary to make zeta_zeros() work.  I also changed the unusual seealso section into a REFERENCES: section.  If this is accepted, both patches should be applied.
