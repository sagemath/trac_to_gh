```
In the reference manual (13.7 Tables of zeros of the Riemann-Zeta
function) it states that zeta_zeros() gives a list of the "first 10000
imaginary parts." However, it should say "first 100000 imaginary
parts" (add a zero to read 100,000). Also, it might serve to mention
that this is an optional package that doesn't come by default.
