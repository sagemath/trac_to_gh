This looks like `pari(infinity)` works:

```
sage: pari(infinity)
Infinity
```

but it's actually just creating a Pari variable named Infinity.

```
sage: (pari(infinity)-1)^2
Infinity^2 - 2*Infinity + 1
```

We should make pari(infinity) raise an exception, instead.  (As far as I can tell, Pari has no built-in notion of infinity, so we can't actually make it work.)

Seems like Pari actually has INFINITY as a user-settable constant, which we probably would not want to make our oo equal to.  So nice patch and docs.

It's a little annoying that pari(maxima(inf)) still 'works', but Sage is only supposed to be the go-between, not to check that one doesn't do silly things with strings, so that's okay.  Positive review.
