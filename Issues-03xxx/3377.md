 It computes the torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve over a number field. The method is the usual idea: Find an upper bound for the order, by considering a few reductions of the elliptic curve at places of small residue fields. Then construct the points by finding roots of the division polynomials over the number field.

 This patch changes the file ell_number_field.py and adds a file ell_nf_torsion.py.

3. The new file ell_nf_torsion.py and old file rational_torsion.py should probably be merged;  and certainly delete from the latter the lines

The patch trac3377-extra1.patch adds some doctests (not yet complete) and a few minor changes to the code just for clarity.

* I think that it might be cleaner to use the P.division_points() functionality recently added by William instead of using the division polynomials directly.  But when I tried this I hit a bug (#3383) so this idea will have to wait until that is fixed.  For example, where the p-torsion is cyclic (the usual case) one could just pick a p-torsion point and keep dividing it by p until that is no longer possible, to get the one generator.

* The has_x() function would be useful as a member function of the generic elliptic curve class

* The torsion_bound() function is perhaps more naturally a member of the ell_number_field  class?

* Is the intention for this to replace the code in rational_torsion.py?  That is not clear.  I would say that there should be special code for the rational field, but that the two cases could be included in the same file;  however that would need rewriting the class definitions a bit since at present the same class name is used in both files.  It would work fine to have one class  EllipticCurveTorsionSubgroup whose constructor used different code depending on whether the base_ring was or was not QQ.

<a id='comment:6'></a>Another patch attached (trac3377.extra3.patch) -- sorry to do this so late in the release cycle, this can wait until the next one after 3.1.2 unless there's a quick review.

This patch adds quite a lot of new functionality as well as refactoring what was done already.  Apply all the patches in order (omit the one whose name ends .py) to 3.1.2.alpha2 or later.  (It will not apply to 3.1.1 unless the division-polynomials patches are applied first so best to use 3.1.2.alpha2).  I tested that this does work and all tests in sage.schemes.elliptic_curves pass.

In the new patch I deleted the new file ell_nf_torsion.py and also the old file rational_torsion.py, replacing them with a new file ell_torsion.py which unifies the code for Q and number fields.

There's a new class EllipticCurvePoint_number_field derived from EllipticCurvePoint_field, and functions specific to number fields have been moved down there;  this class also handles points on curves over Q, for which there is a bit more functionality -- but the gap is closing!

I moved Chris's p-primary-torsion into ell_generic.py, as it does work more generally.  I also moved the torsion_bound function into ell_number_field.py since it can be used to determine whether points have finite order or not, and find their order, even if the full torsion_subgroup() function is not used.  The bound is cached.

<a id='comment:7'></a>Great work. This patch contains quite a lot of things and it should be reviewed carefully and independently, I agree.

I ran into the following problem, which is probably unrelated to this.

```
E = EllipticCurve('37a1')
K = Qp(7,10)
EK = E.base_extend(K)
```

Then 

```
EK._p_primary_torsion_basis(3)
```
fails with

```
AttributeError: 'Polynomial_padic_flat' object has no attribute '__coeffs'
```

because this fails already

```
g = EK.division_polynomial_0(3)
g.roots()
```

Chris,

in "Settings" you can add an email address for your account that is used. In case you did that already you should get emails from all comments by anybody commenting on any ticket you are involved in. If it does not work let me know.

If you want to add people to the CC field it is sufficient to add their trac account name, i.e. "cremona" would work here.

Cheers,

Michael

<a id='comment:13'></a>Chris and John,

This is good stuff.  I was having trouble looking at the changes over all the different patches, so I folded all your patches into one.  While reading the code, I made a number of minor changes, described below:

1. file: number_field.py, function refine_embedding(): added a doctest

2. file: ell_number_field.py, function reduction(): added a type check to throw an exception if the parameter place is not a fractional ideal of K.  As an added bonus, one can now do E.reduction(2*i+3) and the function automatically makes 2*i+3 into the appropriate fractional ideal

3. file: ell_point.py, function _divide_out(): added doctests

4. various typos in various files (some of them predating these patches)

CONCLUSION: apply only the last patch (3377-torsion_nf.patch); credit goes to Chris Wuthrich and John Cremona

<a id='comment:15'></a>I cannot reproduce any of these in my pristine 3.1.2.alpha4 (on 32bit ubuntu).

AFAIK (i.e. trac tells me) that the only patches merged in rc0 so far are #4043 (which has no way of interacting with this) and #3885.  I applied #3885 to my alpha4, then the patch here, and I'm still not getting any of these failures.

So I don't know what's going on.

Alex's patch applies fine to 3.1.2.alpha4.  I get the same doctest issues as Michael on a 64-bit machine.  Both are fixed in 3377-torsion_nf-1.patch.

In the first e1 <= e(P[0]) <= e2 < e3 is really true since e(P[0])==e2==-1 but rounding error caused e(P[0]) <= e2 to give false sometimes.  I fixed this by checking it differently.

In the second it's just numerical fuzz in the last decimal place, so I replces the last 3 digits by ... in the doctest.

The result passes all doctests in sage.schemes.elliptic_curves on both 32-bit and 64-bit machines.  I would not be that surprised if on some other machines we saw more of the same, though:  several bits of the patches are about computing some numbers to arbitrary precision, so I did want to include some decimal numbers in the output, and I have not (sorry) gone through each and every one replacing the final digits by dots.
