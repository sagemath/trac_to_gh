For some reason running latex2html to make the sage docs doesn't work -- the images rarely get built.  This must be fixed, because it causes massive frustration when I try to do releases, etc.

I suspect mistakes in paths or something else.  I don't know. 

Component: **documentation**

Positive review. There might be some spacing issues with the pdf, but we can sort those issues out later since an actually building documentation is much more important than some small spacing issues :)
