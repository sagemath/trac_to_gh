Try the following:

```
print "hi"
sleep(2)
html('<script>alert("boom!")</script>')
sleep(5)
html('<script>alert("sage!")</script>')
```

This illustrates that the <script> tags get evaled AS THE OUTPUT gets received.  Instead the <script> parser should wait until the output is done before parsing anything.  This will likely fix a LOT of annoying weirdness with latency and interact over a slow connection.
