}
```
According to the arrow documentation,

```
An arrow from (xmin, ymin) to (xmax, ymax).
```

However, the current behavior is an arrow from (xmin, ymin) to (xmin + xmax, ymin + ymax).

For example:

```
sage: arrow((1, 1), (-1,-1))
```
will draw an arrow from (1,1) to (0,0).

According to the docs on matplotlib:

Fixing the line where this constructor is called should solve the problem.
