```
According to the arrow documentation,

```
An arrow from (xmin, ymin) to (xmax, ymax).
```

However, the current behavior is an arrow from (xmin, ymin) to (xmin + xmax, ymin + ymax).

For example:

```
sage: arrow((1, 1), (-1,-1))
```
will draw an arrow from (1,1) to (0,0).

According to the docs on matplotlib:

> patches.FancyArrow(x, y, dx, dy, ...


Fixing the line where this constructor is called should solve the problem.

This should be taken care of at the same time as #3877.

Jason is right, this is orthogonal to #3877. Shame on Alex for using such a stupid syntax as (xmin, ymin) to denote the tail coordinates of an arrow.
