The interfaces to gp, gap, r, scilab, magma, etc., should use the randgen framework to initialize/set the seed for their respective random number generators.

The purpose of this ticket is to add a `set_seed` method to each interface which takes the appropriate input to modify the random number generator's seed value. It should also make the interfaces initialize their seed value with a random value generated from the randgen framework.

I added a `set_seed` function on a lot of the interfaces such as gap, gp, magma, maxima, R, and singular. This allows setting the seed for the corresponding random number generator.

This made solving the ticket very easy by just calling "set_seed" when the interface is started with `_start`.

I think someone should rewrite the `randstate` class to use these methods if possible. However that would require someone with more cython knowledge.

Also `set_seed` still needs to be implemented on a few more interfaces, but those are not free so they are not as easy to test with.

In /src/sage/interfaces/interface.py the new function

```
+    def get_seed(self):
+        return self._seed
```

lacks documentation and a doctest. The next two functions lack doctests (I know it's silly)

Other than that, it looks good to me.

I'd also say, if possible, then it shouldn't be tested with the Octave example: Octave is optional, e.g. Singular is not. Secondly, the closer to the actual code, the better. So if we can instantiate an `Interface` object directly that'd be best.

There was actually two `set_seed` for Gap. The file was long and I accidentally copied another to a slightly different place. You can still see the actual `set_seed` function under the total diff.

These new pushes change the doc tests in `interface.py` to use Singular (so less optional packages) and also use an instance of `Interface` directly. This is ok for `rand_seed` and `get_seed` but not for `set_seed` as that has to be implemented by the specific interface. Do you think we need a doc test which raises the `NotImplementedError`?

I get the first 3 errors if I run `sage -t --long src/sage/interfaces/magma.py` but not if I run `./sage -t --long src/sage/interfaces/magma.py`. Shouldn't I only be checking if it runs with the version of Sage on the branch and not the user's systems' version?

The last error seems to be something I didn't notice. Apparently some of the interfaces keep a counter of the commands used and label things with it. The `set_seed` function for some interfaces raises this counter because it needs to call a command in the interface. So running the test in `src/sage/repl/interpreter.py` the counter is off from what it used to be.

This error doesn't occur if I comment out line 626 in `src/sage/interfaces/maxima.py`:

```
625 # set random seed
626 self.set_seed(self._seed)
```

I'm not sure what to do about this. It seems like there is a few options:

* We could reset the counter after the `set_seed` function is called (I actually don't know if this is possible yet).
* We could change all the doc tests in functions which use this counter and increment it manually.
* We could not run `set_seed` on start and leave it up to the user to run it.

Martin, do you have any suggestions on which way to proceed?

I removed some white space and changed a doctest in `src/sage/repl/interpreter.py`.

The doc test was failing because `maxima` now calls `set_seed` on startup which uses several calls to the maxima interpreter. Therefore instead of getting back `2 +  sage1`, it should get back `2 + sage4`.
