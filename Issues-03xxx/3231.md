The interfaces to gp, gap, r, scilab, magma, etc., should use the randgen framework to initialize/set the seed for their respective random number generators.

The purpose of this ticket is to add a `set_seed` method to each interface which takes the appropriate input to modify the random number generator's seed value. It should also make the interfaces initialize their seed value with a random value generated from the randgen framework.

I added a `set_seed` function on a lot of the interfaces such as gap, gp, magma, maxima, R, and singular. This allows setting the seed for the corresponding random number generator.

This made solving the ticket very easy by just calling "set_seed" when the interface is started with `_start`.

I think someone should rewrite the `randstate` class to use these methods if possible. However that would require someone with more cython knowledge.

Also `set_seed` still needs to be implemented on a few more interfaces, but those are not free so they are not as easy to test with.

I repurposed this ticket to match the new directions for the `randstate` class. This ticket is now focused on setting the seeds for the interfaces as the code I uploaded does for many of the interfaces.

There will be a new ticket to rewrite the `randstate` class to use these methods as well as allow for setting the seed on particular instances of interfaces. This may force a small change in the `randstate` api, but that is for the next ticket.

In /src/sage/interfaces/interface.py the new function

```
+    def get_seed(self):
+        return self._seed
```

lacks documentation and a doctest. The next two functions lack doctests (I know it's silly)

Other than that, it looks good to me.

I'd also say, if possible, then it shouldn't be tested with the Octave example: Octave is optional, e.g. Singular is not. Secondly, the closer to the actual code, the better. So if we can instantiate an `Interface` object directly that'd be best.

I get the first 3 errors if I run `sage -t --long src/sage/interfaces/magma.py` but not if I run `./sage -t --long src/sage/interfaces/magma.py`. Shouldn't I only be checking if it runs with the version of Sage on the branch and not the user's systems' version?

The last error seems to be something I didn't notice. Apparently some of the interfaces keep a counter of the commands used and label things with it. The `set_seed` function for some interfaces raises this counter because it needs to call a command in the interface. So running the test in `src/sage/repl/interpreter.py` the counter is off from what it used to be.

This error doesn't occur if I comment out line 626 in `src/sage/interfaces/maxima.py`:

```
625 # set random seed
626 self.set_seed(self._seed)
```

I'm not sure what to do about this. It seems like there is a few options:

* We could reset the counter after the `set_seed` function is called (I actually don't know if this is possible yet).
* We could change all the doc tests in functions which use this counter and increment it manually.
* We could not run `set_seed` on start and leave it up to the user to run it.

Martin, do you have any suggestions on which way to proceed?

Ah, crap my comments from yesterday seem not to have arrived:

- You are not seeing these errors because you have octave et al. installed in your local development environment. In other words: some doctests are not marked optional but you should be marked optional. 

- I'd just update the doctest, `set_seed()` is a proper call, so no point in resetting the counter.

I removed some white space and changed a doctest in `src/sage/repl/interpreter.py`.

The doc test was failing because `maxima` now calls `set_seed` on startup which uses several calls to the maxima interpreter. Therefore instead of getting back `2 +  sage1`, it should get back `2 + sage4`.
