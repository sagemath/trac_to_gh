The interfaces to gp, gap, r, scilab, magma, etc., should use the randgen framework to initialize/set the seed for their respective random number generators.

The purpose of this ticket is to add a `set_seed` method to each interface which takes the appropriate input to modify the random number generator's seed value. It should also make the interfaces initialize their seed value with a random value generated from the randgen framework.

I added a `set_seed` function on a lot of the interfaces such as gap, gp, magma, maxima, R, and singular. This allows setting the seed for the corresponding random number generator.

This made solving the ticket very easy by just calling "set_seed" when the interface is started with `_start`.

I think someone should rewrite the `randstate` class to use these methods if possible. However that would require someone with more cython knowledge.

Also `set_seed` still needs to be implemented on a few more interfaces, but those are not free so they are not as easy to test with.

Maybe this ticket should be repurposed then and another ticket created to realise the integration into the randgen() framework? It'd be a shame if this bitrots.

    "body": "<a id='comment:12'>Comment 12:</a>\nI think this ticket is fine because it's still a step in the right direction. In my mind the best framework would be for every interface to have a `set_seed` function like these. Then `randstate` would have methods that take in an instance of an interface and set it's seed using that method. Right now there is no control over multiple instances of interfaces, which it seems like there could/should be, and it might even simplify some of the `randstate` code.\n\nAlso `randstate` would still set seeds for non-interfaces such as libraries like `libc` and `python.random` (or wrap the random calls as it does). All of the `set_seed` methods I wrote default to `interface.rand_seed` on startup which uses `randstate`, so I think this fit the description of this ticket.\n\nI think the next ticket should be specifically about `randstate` and be dependent on this one.

I think this ticket is fine because it's still a step in the right direction. In my mind the best framework would be for every interface to have a `set_seed` function like these. Then `randstate` would have methods that take in an instance of an interface and set it's seed using that method. Right now there is no control over multiple instances of interfaces, which it seems like there could/should be, and it might even simplify some of the `randstate` code.

Also `randstate` would still set seeds for non-interfaces such as libraries like `libc` and `python.random` (or wrap the random calls as it does). All of the `set_seed` methods I wrote default to `interface.rand_seed` on startup which uses `randstate`, so I think this fit the description of this ticket.

I think the next ticket should be specifically about `randstate` and be dependent on this one. I am worried repurposing this ticket to do both might be a bit much. Or did you have something else in mind?

In /src/sage/interfaces/interface.py the new function

```
+    def get_seed(self):

```

lacks documentation and a doctest. The next two functions lack doctests (I know it's silly)

Other than that, it looks good to me.

I get the first 3 errors if I run `sage -t --long src/sage/interfaces/magma.py` but not if I run `./sage -t --long src/sage/interfaces/magma.py`. Shouldn't I only be checking if it runs with the version of Sage on the branch and not the user's systems' version?

The last error seems to be something I didn't notice. Apparently some of the interfaces keep a counter of the commands used and label things with it. The `set_seed` function for some interfaces raises this counter because it needs to call a command in the interface. So running the test in `src/sage/repl/interpreter.py` the counter is off from what it used to be.

This error doesn't occur if I comment out line 626 in `src/sage/interfaces/maxima.py`:

```
625 # set random seed
626 self.set_seed(self._seed)
```

I'm not sure what to do about this. It seems like there is a few options:

* We could reset the counter after the `set_seed` function is called (I actually don't know if this is possible yet).
* We could change all the doc tests in functions which use this counter and increment it manually.
* We could not run `set_seed` on start and leave it up to the user to run it.

Martin, do you have any suggestions on which way to proceed?

I removed some white space and changed a doctest in `src/sage/repl/interpreter.py`.

The doc test was failing because `maxima` now calls `set_seed` on startup which uses several calls to the maxima interpreter. Therefore instead of getting back `2 +  sage1`, it should get back `2 + sage4`.
