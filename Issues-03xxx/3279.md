```
Due to a bug not caught in #3097 we end up with an inconsistent repo in $SAGE_LOCAL/bin:

```
mabshoff@sage:/scratch/mabshoff/release-cycle/sage-3.0.2.final/local/bin$ hg status
! dsage_setup.py
! dsage_worker.py
```
The files are in the scripts.spkg:

```
mabshoff@sage:/scratch/mabshoff/release-cycle/sage-3.0.2.final/spkg/standard/sage_scripts-3.0.2.rc0$ ls -al dsage_*
-rwxr-xr-x 1 mabshoff 1090  7479 2008-05-22 23:19 dsage_setup.py
-rwxr-xr-x 1 mabshoff 1090 35459 2008-05-22 23:19 dsage_worker.py
```
When those two scripts are missing the DSage tests just hang.

Patch coming up.

Cheers,

Michael
