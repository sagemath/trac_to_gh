This method currently does not exist, but it should.  For an outline of an algorithm see: http://www.mathreference.com/ring-q,sqr.html

The only issue is that, as far as I know, there is no standard for which square root to take like there is over C or R.

**Status:** needs_info

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/3709

In the quaternions there are infinitely many square-roots of -1: (xi + yj + zk)<sup>2</sup> = -1 for any real numbers x, y, z such that x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup> + z<sup>2</sup> = 1. Â I don't know how to prefer one of these.
