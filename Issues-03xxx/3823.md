This does not apply cleanly any more, but should be trivial to rebase:

```
mabshoff@sage:/scratch/mabshoff/release-cycle/sage-3.1.2.alpha2/devel/sage$ patch -p1 < trac_3823_sage.patch 
patching file sage/server/notebook/interact.py
Hunk #1 FAILED at 1397.
1 out of 1 hunk FAILED -- saving rejects to file sage/server/notebook/interact.py.rej
```

Igor: In the future please name the patches you post trac_XXXX_description.patch.

Cheers,

Michael
