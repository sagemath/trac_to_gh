I've attached a patch that adds a shared library to tachyon.

My patch includes the necessary changes to the Debian package.

Looking at spkg-install, it looks like SAGE doesn't actually use the tachyon library, only the binary, so I'm not including any changes to the spkg-install system.

Once this gets merged, I'll email John Stone with the patch to tachyon upstream.
