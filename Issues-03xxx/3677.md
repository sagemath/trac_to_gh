At the end of testing when reporting the results, sage -t does not take into account the current directory.  It produces output like this:

```
sage -t  devel/sage-combinat/sage/combinat/root_system/ambient_space.py
sage -t  devel/sage-combinat/sage/combinat/root_system/root_lattice_realization.py
sage -t  devel/sage-combinat/sage/combinat/root_system/root_space.py
sage -t  devel/sage-combinat/sage/combinat/root_system/root_system.py
sage -t  devel/sage-combinat/sage/combinat/root_system/weight_space.py
```

when it should be giving output like 

```
sage -t  ambient_space.py
sage -t  root_lattice_realization.py
sage -t  root_space.py
sage -t  root_system.py
sage -t  weight_space.py
```
