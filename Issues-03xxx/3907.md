Assuming this is a bug, not a feature:

```
sage: plot(1/x,0,1)
<boom>

My feeling is this should plot okay, since there is only one "bad"
point and the plotting code handles that kind of thing.

As far as I can tell from the traceback (relevant appended), the
problem is in the axes, which convert (at least when using
_tasteful_ticks) the endpoints to integers, given a big enough range.

kcrisman opened a ticket for that at #3985 - at least it seems very close to what you suggest.
