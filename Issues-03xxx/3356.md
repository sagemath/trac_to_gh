In keeping with the Twisted rule, all work has a ticket.  This comment
was posted on a ticket "not ready for review". When its changed to
ready, an aggregate patch will be posted using the accepted process.

The branches, and published repos for the finance/dsageng development
activities provide a finer grained view of the development process for
contributors and casual observers.  Since we have this set up, it seems
easier to use branchy development between reviewable events.

Positive review with comments

The doctest for the linear_filter function involving the multifractal random walk seems odd to me (the one outside the time series class, which I call autoregressive_fit). The reason I'm skeptical is that a complicated series is generated and then one does a fit and produces regression coefficients that are [ .998, stuff nearly 0] which means that the forcast says the best prediction of the next value is the previous one plus noise, which makes sense but somehow doesn't seem like as good of a test of the function to me as it could be given its complexity.



Suggestions for future improvement I'll do them in a separate patch unless someone does them first

easy: 

1.  I think it would be nice if autocovariance/correlation could have a second optional parameter so that t.autocovariance(i,j) would return all the autocovariance 
coefficients from i to i+j or between i and j as a timeseries (this is just a list comprehension).



2. partial autocorrelation function, its a function often denoted by \pi such that
\pi_p is last coefficient outputted by autoregressive_fit(p) (formerly known as linearly_filter).

Merged finance.hg in Sage 3.0.4.alpha2 and after resolving two merge issues it seems to doctest fine.

The comments should move to three new tickets.
