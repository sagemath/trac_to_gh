In keeping with the Twisted rule, all work has a ticket.  This comment
was posted on a ticket "not ready for review". When its changed to
ready, an aggregate patch will be posted using the accepted process.

The branches, and published repos for the finance/dsageng development
activities provide a finer grained view of the development process for
contributors and casual observers.  Since we have this set up, it seems
easier to use branchy development between reviewable events.

I think its more accurate to call it autoregressive_fit, and autoregressive_forecast, also added a doctest (patch attached). Also there was a problem with numerical noise on the hurst_exponent causing a doctest failure I added a ...\n\n\nThe doctest for the linear_filter function involving the multifractal random walk seems odd to me (the one outside the time series class, which I call autoregressive_fit). The reason I'm skeptical is that a complicated series is generated and then one does a fit and produces regression coefficients that are [ .998, stuff nearly 0] which means that the forcast says the best prediction of the next value is the previous one plus noise, which makes sense but somehow doesn't seem like as good of a test of the function to me as it could be given its complexity.\n\n\n\nSuggestions for future improvement I'll do them in a separate patch unless someone does them first\n\neasy: \n\n1.  I think it would be nice if autocovariance/correlation could have a second optional parameter so that t.autocovariance(i,j) would return all the autocovariance \ncoefficients from i to i+j or between i and j as a timeseries (this is just a list comprehension).\n\n\n\n2. partial autocorrelation function, its a function often denoted by \\pi such that\n\\pi_p is last coefficient outputted by autoregressive_fit(p) (formerly known as linearly_filter).",

Positive review with comments

I've made some changes to the docstring on the linear filter/forecast methods. I think its more accurate to call it autoregressive_fit, and autoregressive_forecast, also added a doctest (patch attached). Also there was a problem with numerical noise on the hurst_exponent causing a doctest failure I added a ...


The doctest for the linear_filter function involving the multifractal random walk seems odd to me (the one outside the time series class, which I call autoregressive_fit). The reason I'm skeptical is that a complicated series is generated and then one does a fit and produces regression coefficients that are [ .998, stuff nearly 0] which means that the forcast says the best prediction of the next value is the previous one plus noise, which makes sense but somehow doesn't seem like as good of a test of the function to me as it could be given its complexity.



Suggestions for future improvement I'll do them in a separate patch unless someone does them first

easy: 

1.  I think it would be nice if autocovariance/correlation could have a second optional parameter so that t.autocovariance(i,j) would return all the autocovariance 
coefficients from i to i+j or between i and j as a timeseries (this is just a list comprehension).



2. partial autocorrelation function, its a function often denoted by \pi such that
\pi_p is last coefficient outputted by autoregressive_fit(p) (formerly known as linearly_filter).

Merged finance.hg in Sage 3.0.4.alpha2 and after resolving two merge issues it seems to doctest fine.

The comments should move to three new tickets.

Cheers,

Michael
