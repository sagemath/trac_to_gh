Computation of the kernel is done in two steps in Sage:

1. Compute the reduced row echelon form of the matrix.
2. Read off the kernel.
3. Create the kernel as a vector space.

In theory 1 takes most of the time and 2-3 are trivial.
In this particular case Sage is using 100% slow generic
code (over any base ring, etc.) to do 2-3, but superfast
code for 1:

sage: M=MatrixSpace(GF(2),1000,500).random_element()
sage: time E=M.echelon_form()
CPU times: user 0.00 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.00 s
Wall time: 0.00 s
sage: time K=M.kernel()
CPU times: user 13.02 s, sys: 0.82 s, total: 13.84 s
Wall time: 14.54 s

Writing a version of the generic code that is optimized
for gf2 mr4i matrices would make it so the second step
above would take 0.00 seconds.  Really it would 
probably take about 10 ms, since

sage: M=MatrixSpace(GF(2),1000,500).random_element()
sage: timeit('M[0,0]=0; M.echelon_form()')
125 loops, best of 3: 3.46 ms per loop

So with proper optimization Sage should be at least an order
of magnitude than your meataxe benchmarks above.

With attached patch things are a little bit better (I didn't touch the vectors yet):

```
sage: M=MatrixSpace(GF(2),1000,500).random_element()
sage: %time K=M.kernel()
CPU times: user 5.89 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 5.90 s
Wall time: 5.99 s

sage: %time K.matrix()
CPU times: user 3.36 s, sys: 0.49 s, total: 3.86 s
Wall time: 3.95 s
500 x 1000 dense matrix over Finite Field of size 2
```
