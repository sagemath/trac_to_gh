```
sage: dg = DiGraph({0 : [1], 1 : [0]})
sage: dg.set_edge_label(0,1,5)
sage: dg.set_edge_label(1,0,9)
sage: dg.edges()
[(0, 1, 5), (1, 0, 9)]
sage: dg.outgoing_edges([1])
[(1, 0, 9)]
sage: dg.incoming_edges([1])
[(0, 1, None)]
sage: dg.outgoing_edges(0)
[(0, 1, 5)]
sage: dg.incoming_edges(0)
[(1, 0, None)]
```

As you can see, outgoing_edges remembers the labels but incoming_edges does not.

Component: **graph theory**

The incoming edge iterator depends on self._backend._nxg which is a NetworkX XDigraph. This digraph has separate iterators for incoming and outgoing edges that depend on dictionaries self._backend._nxg.succ and self._backend._nxg.pred. Before the patch, self._backend._nxg.pred was not getting initialized.

The patch is obviously correct and I've also tested it.
