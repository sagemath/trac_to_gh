We currently ship two copies of the jquery javascript library:

* jQuery 1.2.6 - New Wave Javascript - $Rev: 5685 $ in devel/sage-main/sage/dsage/web/static/jquery.js
* jQuery 1.2.3 - New Wave Javascript - $Rev: 4663 $ in data/extcode/notebook/javascript/jquery/jquery.js

But we should on ship one copy.

Cheers,

Michael

All that is needed is that dsage needs to change its /static directory to point to local/notebook/javascript/<appropriate directory>.  I'm making this minor since:

1. the small space wasted with duplicated code is not worth the risk of breaking dsage, especially since
2. it seems that the future of dsage is uncertain.

Things work now.

dsage is gone, so that doesn't matter. The files in `data/extcode/...` are used by the old notebook (in sage.server.notebook). Since the old notebook isn't used anymore except in migration to the new one, the files should be safe to delete.
