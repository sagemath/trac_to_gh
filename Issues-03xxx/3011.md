On my Gentoo box I unpacked the subject tarball, changed to the sage
directory and did a make with the results:

Error building RPY -- Python interface to R.

I tried several corrective measures and the only one that allowed sage
to build was to issue:

RHOMES="`pwd`/local/lib/R" make

However, the following test failed:

sage -t  devel/sage/sage/stats/test.py 
```
Follow up:

```
Michael,

Yes I do have R installed on my system. No, RHOMES is not set;
however, R_HOMES is set to /usr/lib64/R. Apparently, the R
installation does this. And yes I do have the install.log. The
specific test fails as:

sage -t  devel/sage/sage/stats/test.py

I've built sage previously, but without R installed. I suspect the
installed (Portage) R is conflicting with what sage does. Let me know
if you wish to see the install.log. I'm presently re-building sage in
a shell where I've disabled the R_HOME variable.
