Hi!

The Cartesian Product iterator of infinite sequences doesn't enumerate the
every element in the product.

I tried:

```
for t in CartesianProduct(QQ,ZZ):

....:     print t

....:     

[0, 0]

[0, 1]

[0, -1]

[0, 2]
```

This is equivalent to nest for loops, which won't work.
You have to enumerate the set in a different way.

See 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursively_enumerable
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor_pairing_function

Best regards,
Michael

<a id='comment:2'></a>I would try checking via
len
if the sequence might be finite (of course, there are finite sequence, where len doesn't work).
If you know, that the sequences are finite, you can return an naive iterator.
