: "edge_labels -- whether to print edgeedge labels. By default, False,                 but"

Notice the edgeedge.

was: Also a complaint - I tried for 15 minutes and couldn't figure out how to label the edges!

Anyway, the docs need a few extra examples, so I'll post a patch soon.

I don't see how to make it easier to figure out...
