Please don't just copy them, you need to extract it and copy the sage-install script. With matplotlib, that's all that is needed, with gd, you need to get a new gd-2.0.35 from:

and copy it to the src.

<div id="comment:2" align="right">Comment 2</div>

Review:

* matplotlib-0.91.1.p5.spkg: this is the right fix and I will forward port it to the matplotlib-0.98.spkg.
* gd-2.0.33.p5.spkg: this is also the correct fix and I will port it to the current gd-2.0.35.spkg

Aside from that everything else for a properly upgraded spkg is wrong, but I guess since nobody ever taught you you did not know :)

Cheers,

Michael

Yes, I know, it was a quick hack to get things working, but just to be sure you don't just copy the spkg, I wrote literally, please don't copy it, extract it. :)

Thanks Michael!
