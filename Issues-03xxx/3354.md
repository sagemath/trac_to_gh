sage: sqrt(2+t)
------------------------------------------------------------
Traceback (most recent call last):
```
Now this error is expected because `sqrt()` has an `extend` keyword that allows to extend the base ring, and to give the name of the generator of the quadratic field, but this does not work:

```
sage: K.<t> = PowerSeriesRing(QQ, 5)
sage: (t+2).sqrt(extend=True, name='sqrt2')
sqrt2
```
The expected output would be `sqrt2 + sqrt2*x/4 + sqrt2*x^2/32 +...`

However, more convenient would be to make the default of `extend` to be `True` and for square roots of integers `N` the name `sqrtN` provided. Only raise an error for nonintegers if no name is given.

Perhaps the error is just bad, but it should be able
to compute this by extending to a field with sqrt(2).
```
Note that the following works, but it is not very direct

```
sage: (2+t).change_ring(QuadraticField(2)).sqrt()
a + 1/4*a*t - 1/32*a*t^2 + 1/128*a*t^3 - ... + O(t^20)

In the meantime the error changed to:

```
There are also these keywords to consider. However `extend=True` returns not a square root of the series but the square root of the extension ring, and I am not sure what use it is, I think it's simply a bug:

```
          - ``extend`` - bool (default: False); if True, return a square
            root in an extension ring, if necessary. Otherwise, raise
            a ValueError if the square root is not in the base power series
            ring. For example, if ``extend`` is True the square root of a
            power series with odd degree leading coefficient is
            defined as an element of a formal extension ring.

          - ``name`` - string; if ``extend`` is True, you must also specify the     print
            name of the formal square root.

So effectively the original issue (giving a correct result for `(2+t).sqrt()` regardless of whether automagically or by giving the `extend` keyword) is not fixed.

I also think the default of `extend` should be true and for square roots of integers `N` the name `sqrtN` provided. Only raise an error for nonintegers if no name is given.

EDIT: typos
