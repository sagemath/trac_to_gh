In sage-spkg "gcc -v" is used, instead of "${CC-gcc} -v". Easy fix:

```

In sage-env, tests if CC is gcc, which means "CC=gcc-4.3" might not
work exactly the same as if gcc is a symlink to gcc-4.3, for instance:

```
if [ "$SAGE64" = "yes" -a CC = "gcc" ]; then
  CFLAGS="$CFLAGS -m64"
fi
```

After thinking about this a little more: ${CC-gcc} is gcc specific and we can no longer assume that we are compiling with gcc in the first place. Hence I would like to suggest that we use `CC` and `CXX` in those places and make sure in `sage-env` that they are set.
