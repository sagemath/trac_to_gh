```
Integer(5)._lmul_(Integer(3))
```
 should produce 15, but instead throws

```
NotImplementedError: parents Integer Ring Integer Ring True
```
This makes it hard to write general code that works with noncomutative multiplication.  

Component: **coercion**

If a._lmul_(b) is desired, why can't one simply write a*b? 

The raising of a NotImplementedError in `_lmul_` signifies that `_lmul_` is not implemented, and the two elements should be coerced into a common parent where the normal `_mul_` should be used instead.

Robert, any idea what is going on here? 

This is still broken with "new" coercion:

This should be marked as invalid. `_lmul_` and `_rmul_` are used for multiplication by an element of the basering, not for multiplication of elements themselves. Throwing an error here is the right thing to do, as it signals that the coercion model an action is not the appropriate thing to do here, but rather that both a and b should be coerced to the same parent and a._mul_(b) should be called. 

Writing a*b or b*a preserves the order of operands are fed into `_mul_`, so non-commutative operations can be supported just fine. 

_lmul_, `_rmul_`, etc. are not made to be called directly anyways in most cases.
