I construct a graph P on 8 vertices from the Petersen graph.

PROBLEMS:
(1) The command P.relabel() raises an error as shown, but seems to work.
(2) An attempt to get the automorphism group again raises an error, as shown.
(3) P.is_planar() raises an exceptions.KeyError.
(4) Attempting to get the group before relabelling raises an error too.
(5) Ditto for P.girth()

VERSION:

sage: version()
'SAGE Version 3.0, Release Date: 2008-04-21'

GRAPH CONSTRUCTION:
P = graphs.PetersenGraph()
P.delete_edge([0,1])
P.add_edge([4,5])
P.add_edge([2,6])
P.delete_vertices([0,1])

sage: P.degree()  
[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]

sage: P.vertices()
[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
