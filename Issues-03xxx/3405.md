# New upstream release

Tue Jun 10 18:51:53 CEST 2008 Singular-3-0-4-3

Changes with respect to 3-0-4-2

*  code depending on certain cpus is now selected by SI_CPU_*
  in mod2.h (for libsingular.so), set by configure
*  licence clarified:
  * kernel/htmlhelp.h changed to LGPL 2.1
  * kernel/htmlhelp.lib removed
  * not-up-to-date stuff removed
*  more static p_Procs: faster on systems which do not support/
  do not use DL_KERNEL
* new target libsingular.a (for gfan)

This includes the fix for Solaris. Also note that libSingular is now also used for gfan :-)

The SPKG is here:

   http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/malb/spkgs/singular-3-0-4-2-20080611.p0.spkg

Keywords: **singular, editor_mabshoff**
