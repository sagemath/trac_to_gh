On OSX it seems that using DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH on OSX is not equivalent to using LD_LIBRARY_PATH on Linux for example since there the linker takes that into consideration as a last resort when not finding libraries. I tried to figure out if there is some magic mode for the OSX ld to consider DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH, but I couldn't find anything. Either way, I can systematically fix those issues, but it will take some time to get this right and tested since this appears to be an OSX specific issue. 

This is somewhat of a META ticket and will take some time to fix.

Cheers,

Michael

This ticket is very vague, and we have been dealing with these issues on a per-spkg basis, I think - not to mention that it has gotten no comments in four years.  I'm recommending to close this, though the release manager could have another view.
