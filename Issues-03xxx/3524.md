Buildbot Implementation Plan

1) Setup Buildbot master and slaves for release testing: Implement shellcommand interfaces to download, build and test candidate tarballs

- includes configuring status delivery via mail / web and irc

2) Integration with Hg: finer grained use of distributed testing through Hg pull

3) Twisted PB integration: Buildbot supports PB and can be used for real-time status

3) Integration with test framework: unittest and doctest
