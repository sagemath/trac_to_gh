We get a "solution" from `solve()` that isn't actually a solution:

```
sage: f(x) = (sin(x) - 8*cos(x)*sin(x))*(sin(x)^2 + cos(x)) - (2*cos(x)*sin(x) - sin(x))*(-2*sin(x)^2 + 2*cos(x)^2 - cos(x))
sage: solve(f(x), x)
[x == pi, x == 1/2*pi, x == 0]
sage: f(pi/2)
-1
```

The following is correct:

```
sage: solve(f(x).simplify_trig(), x)
[x == 0, x == pi - arccos(1/3), x == pi]
```

Reduced example (after manually removing the factor `sin(x)`):

```
sage: g(x) = (1 - 8*cos(x))*(sin(x)^2 + cos(x)) - (2*cos(x) - 1)*(-2*sin(x)^2 + 2*cos(x)^2 - cos(x))
sage: solve(g(x), x)
[x == pi, x == 1/2*pi]
sage: g(pi/2)
-1
```

Note this particular bug is still in Maxima as of 5.19.1.  More bugs (but also lots more correct answers) have been introduced in the last year, and other bugs  have been fixed.  Writing a solve from scratch still looks very hard.

Update from Maxima 5.20.1 in Sage:

```
sage: sage: var('a,b,c,d')
(a, b, c, d)
sage: sage: m = matrix(2,[a,b,c,d])
sage: sage: i2=identity_matrix(SR,2)
sage: sage: eqlist=[(m*m).list()[i] - i2.list()[i] for i in range(4)]
sage: sage: solve(eqlist,a,b,c,d) 
[a^2 + b*c - 1, a*b + b*d, a*c + c*d, b*c + d^2 - 1]
```
so this one seems to be working now, at least in the sense that it doesn't throw an error.  

The second one now causes a hang.

And the first one is still there :(

We should write our own native solve from scratch.  Depending on maxima for solve is silly, for several reasons:

* For algebraic systems we could do much better using Groebner basis and singular. 

* Coefficients for symbolic expressions can be in many base rings that don't even make sense to Maxima.

-
-`solve' is using arc-trig functions to get a solution.
-Some solutions will be lost.

The one in [comment:1](#comment%3A1) hangs for me as before, but upon Ctrl-C it does give `[]`.  For what it's worth.  Though in Maxima I got 

```
(%i1) solve([a - exp((-pi*b)/sqrt(1-b)) = 0, c - atan(2*b*sqrt(1/(sqrt(4*b^4+1) - 2*b^2)))=0,a=0.1975],[b,c,a]);

rat: replaced -0.1975 by -79/400 = -0.1975
(%o1)                                 []
```
almost immediately.  So I'm not sure why it hangs.  Is there even a solution to that?  It seems quite arbitrary.

By the way, in the original report which has been erased, a Maxima dev suggested he'd reported this, so perhaps this is redundant, but I don't know where it would be.
