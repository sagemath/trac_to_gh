This is occurs because it assumes that "self.points().columns(copy=False)[self.nvertices():]" does not return an empty list.

```

   1448             pplot += point3d(self.points().columns(copy=False)[self.nvertices():],
-> 1449                         size=point_size, rgbcolor=point_color)
```
A workaround is to use p.plot3d(show_points=False) so that it doesn't hit that code.
