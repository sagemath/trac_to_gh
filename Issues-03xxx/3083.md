If I type `sage.graphs.chrompoly??` for example in a cell, and evaluate, I get a nice chunk of code. But when I hit "print", all I get is the input. Docs should be included in the printed worksheets.

Well done!

* "Closing" a dialog does not remove it from the DOM.  It's just hidden.  I suggest mapping the close button to, e.g., `$('.dialog').dialog('destroy').remove();`.

* For `'eval'`-method docstrings, the sans-serif font becomes monospaced.

* I suggest changing "Click on the box..." to, e.g., "Click here..." and binding the click event to just that `div`.  Otherwise, users who click on the docstring as they read it and/or copy examples might get an unwanted dialog.

* It might be worth it to mention on the "Help" page or in the tutorial which docstrings are printable.

* If I evaluate `factor?` in a cell, I can print the docstring with the worksheet, as desired.  People might also find it useful for evaluated docstrings to survive reopening the worksheet or to appear in published worksheets (e.g., as part of an annotated tutorial).  But I suggest waiting for feedback on the mailing lists and, if it's necessary, creating new tickets.

V4.2

* Implements the "last point" above in a different way.  With V3, the output formatting didn't persist --- docstrings in restarted/reopened and published worksheets were escaped.  Docstrings also appeared twice in each output cell.

* Popping now
  * Resets the cell's introspection state.
  * Puts the object's name in the dialog title, with a bit of color.
  * Destroys just that dialog on close.  The previous query was broad enough that it could close multiple dialogs.

* Moves `"""nodoctest\n"""` back to the top of `notebook_object.py`.

Again, great work!  My review is positive, but someone should review my changes.
