Hi Jim,

this looks related to #3098. Since we have a fix for that issue which will be part of 3.0.1 can you try with it and check if the issue has been fixed? William is trying on a similar setup that also shows #3098, so hopefully he can give us some info here, too.

FYI:

```
me: ok. I just commented on the ticket that it likely would.
So you might want to clue us in that it is not that issue, but a similar problem
 William: Good.
 me: I also think that the "huge" problem he posted might just be that he ran out of RAM.
 William: Line 803 in singular.py would be fixed in a similar way to the fix in my other patch.
We'll find out in a while.
 me: After all: we are running Singular in 32 bit mode on OSX for now.
Now if that mabshoff guy got moving on that issue .... [wink]
 William: Yes, what's holding up the 64-bit port?
 me: Nothing. Just spending my "free" time with lisp, Itanium and other fun stuff.

The 64 bit OSX port is a high priority item for us and most problems have been already solved. William and I will likely spend some good time this Sunday and try to get everything merged back into 3.0.2.

```
Hi Michael!

I also use
-with-valloc=system
additionally to
--with-malloc=system

on Mac OS X  (32bit). I had issues with Singular not being able to
allocate much memory (under certain circumstances) a few years ago
and this configuration has proven to be useful.

Best regards,
Michael 
```
I am not sure how Singular normally reacts when running out of memory, but it should obviously never crash.

I am CCing PolyBoRi since Michael B. might enlighten us about this specific problem.

Cheers,

Michael

usually I got a clear error message about not being able to allocate more virtual memory (sometimes having only 100MB of memory consumed).
I would recommend to export the actual commands sent to Singular somehow and to reproduce them with the Singular version in fink (and on other platforms).
