Hi Michael!

I also use
-with-valloc=system
additionally to
--with-malloc=system

on Mac OS X  (32bit). I had issues with Singular not being able to
allocate much memory (under certain circumstances) a few years ago
and this configuration has proven to be useful.

Best regards,
Michael 
```
I am not sure how Singular normally reacts when running out of memory, but it should obviously never crash.

I am CCing PolyBoRi since Michael B. might enlighten us about this specific problem.

Cheers,

Michael
