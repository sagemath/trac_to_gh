Singular crashes at degree 13 on intel core duo machine (mac os 10.5.2) when running "fano7.sage" with user command "run2(1,20)".  See attached files (fano7.sage, crash.txt}.  You may want to try "run(12,20)" to get to the crash more quickly.  Also, "run2(19,40)" crashed a quad core ppc machine with 8 gigs of memory.  The crash occurred before there was any significant output.

 William: Good.

The 64 bit OSX port is a high priority item for us and most problems have been already solved. William and I will likely spend some good time this Sunday and try to get everything merged back into 3.0.2.

```
Hi Michael!

I also use
-with-valloc=system
additionally to
--with-malloc=system

on Mac OS X  (32bit). I had issues with Singular not being able to
allocate much memory (under certain circumstances) a few years ago
and this configuration has proven to be useful.

Best regards,
Michael 
```
I am not sure how Singular normally reacts when running out of memory, but it should obviously never crash.

I am CCing PolyBoRi since Michael B. might enlighten us about this specific problem.

Cheers,

Michael

usually I got a clear error message about not being able to allocate more virtual memory (sometimes having only 100MB of memory consumed).
I would recommend to export the actual commands sent to Singular somehow and to reproduce them with the Singular version in fink (and on other platforms).
