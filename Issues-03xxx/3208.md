I've reworded a bunch of things in the first few sections of the tutorial, plus small changes scattered throughout (like changing Sage to \sage).  As time permits, and if these changes are acceptable, I may get to the later parts.

Aside from random rewordings, I made the following changes and/or have the following comments:

1. at various points, I replaced things like $BLAH$ with \verb+BLAH+ or \code{BLAH} or \emph{BLAH}: when converted to html, these other things behave better than $BLAH$.

2. In section 2.2, there is a sentence "You do not have to specify the types of any of the input arguments."  This implies that it's possible to specify those types, I think, so I've removed the words "have to".

3. In section 2.3, one of the examples says

```
 sage: I = ComplexField().0
```
What does the '.0' do?  I can't find out where this might be documented.  Since it's not documented, I've removed its occurrences from this section.  (Replaced with CC(i), for instance.)

Attachment: **[tut.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket3208/tut.patch.gz)**

Review: a very worthy effort!  Just two points.  Here:

```
The symbol \code{I} represents a formal square root of $-1$, as does 
\code{i}; of course this is not in $\Q$.  Neither is the square root 
of $-1$ in the complex numbers: 
```

the last part sounds to me as though you are saying that the square root of $-1$ is not in the complex numbers!  Perhaps change that to

```
Neither is the (complex) square root of $-1$ rational:
```

Secondly, I agree that `ComplexField().0` is obscure, as is `CC.0`, but it is just a synonym for `CC.gen(0)` or `CC.gen()` since `CC` has exactly one "generator" (though we had better not start to revive the old argument about what generators are...).  It would never have occurred to me to write `CC(i)` but it works fine.

I vote to accept this after the change of wording suggested (or similar).

<div id="comment:3" align="right">comment:3</div>

We could finesse the whole issue and just say "The square root of $-1$ is not rational", followed by 

```
 sage: i in QQ
 False
```

This ignores the fact that i is not actually an element of `CC` (which could mislead users, I suppose), but it means we don't have to use `CC(i)`, or `CC.0` which I think is more confusing, especially so early in the tutorial.  On the other hand, I've added the example

```
 sage: c = GF(3)(1)    # c is the element 1 of the field GF(3)
```
so maybe `CC(i)` is not so obscure?

I'm not sure what the right thing to do is.  I've changed it to the following:

The symbol \code{I} represents the square root of $-1$; \code{i} is a
synonym for \code{I}.  Of course, this is not in $\Q$:

```
 sage: i  # square root of -1
 I     
 sage: i in QQ
 False
```

Because of this change, I've re-inserted a mention of `CC` into the paragraph which follows this in the tutorial.

I'll include a patch, but I'll keep the old patch too, in case people want to compare.
