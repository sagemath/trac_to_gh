<div id="comment:0"></div>

When using pyprocessing, if you use an interface to some external function, such as GAP, sometimes the separate subprocesses will collide, since they all share the same temporary file.

A temporary fix (due to cwitty) was to add

`sage.interfaces.expect.tmp_expect_interface_local = '/tmp/interface' + str(os.getpid())`

to the beginning of the function succeeding the `@parallel` decorator. This way, the temp files are separate. This should probably be part of the `parallel` function itself.

How about replacing tmp_expect_interface_local by a function that returns, 

  `'/tmp/interface' + str(os.getpid())`

this way, it should always just work?

That's all taken care of because the files are in SAGE_TMP.  No worries.

I think this is a good patch.
