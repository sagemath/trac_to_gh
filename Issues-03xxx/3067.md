This happens for all matrices:

```
sage: m = matrix([])
sage: m.numeric_array()
<type 'exceptions.ImportError'>: No module named Numeric
sage: q= random_matrix(ZZ,2)
sage: q.numeric_array()
<type 'exceptions.ImportError'>: No module named Numeric
```

**Attachment:** [3067.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket3067/3067.patch.gz)

I deleted this function since it looks like sage doesn't use Numeric anymore. Or I could do a conditional import. Thoughts?
