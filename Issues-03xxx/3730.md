Debian's automated Python byte-compilation tool determines what's a python script based on whether it has extention .py (yeah, I know, pretty lame), and is apparently stupid enough to look in /usr/share/doc/sagemath/examples for things needing byte-compilation.

Unfortunately, /usr/share/doc/sagemath/examples/example.py is a .py with a #!/usr/bin/sage and which apparently isn't entirely valid python (the last line causes the byte-compiler to fail):

```
Compiling /usr/share/sagemath/examples/example.py ...
  File "/usr/share/sagemath/examples/example.py", line 62
    time factor(Integer(2)**Integer(127)-Integer(1))
              ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```

The corresponding file example.sage seems to not exist, so I'm not sure what the story with that file is.
