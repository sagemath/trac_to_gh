Action: Click on "Quit worksheet" when you have a worksheet open

Expected result:
* Sage process behind worksheet exits/gets killed (happed prior to 3.0)
* Browser goes back to worksheet list (this would be an enhancement over previous behaviour)

Actual result:
* drop down list keeps "quit worksheet" selection and no other result
* if you return to worksheet list manually, the worksheet is still listed as "(active)"

Reproducible:
* every time for me: vanilla RHEL Server 5.1 box (amd64) running sage notebook as "nobody".
Connection made with Firefox 2.0.0.14 from a Fedora 7 machine.

Problem:
* machine fills up with sage processes. Restarting the sage server solves the problem, obviously, but is a bit draconian.
