Paste this code into a Sage session:

```
E = EllipticCurve('389a')
for p in prime_range(10000):
    if p != 389:
       try:
           G = E.change_ring(GF(p)).abelian_group()
       except Exception, msg:
           print "p = %s fails"%p
           print msg
```

The output varies on run and computer.  Typical output looks like this:

```
p = 7 fails
No solution in bsgs()
p = 1901 fails

p = 4273 fails

p = 5101 fails

p = 7177 fails

p = 7433 fails

p = 9013 fails

p = 9049 fails

p = 9749 fails
```

The actual failures are assertion failures in the baby-step giant-step implementation.

Under OS X (10.5.1 intel core2 duo with 2GB RAM)
I also get a repeatable massive memory overflow that completely crashes Sage:

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve('389a')
sage: for p in prime_range(10000):

....:            print msg
....: 
p = 7 fails
No solution in bsgs()
p = 523 fails

p = 2477 fails

p = 3001 fails

p = 3449 fails

Running this under gdb yields nothing useful:

I found the bug which causes this.  It is not in any of the generic code at all, but in some lines I added quite late on in ell_finite_field.py to make one step (in code which happens relatively infrequently) "more efficient".  I'll post a patch on Wednesday.

Two bugs fixed:

* A more subtle bug in the abelian_group() function for curves over finite fields, in a bit of code added late on for "efficiency".

The code in the original post now runs fine;  I also ran it up to `10***5` and for `GF(p^k)` up to `10^3` for `k=2,3,4,5`.

Attachment: **[sage-3111-extra.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket3111/sage-3111-extra.patch.gz)**

sage-3111-extra.patch does the following:

* deleted two debuggin print lines
* added doctest to show that the original post is fixed
* passes all doctests in sage/schemes/elliptic_curves

For the doctest I check that it is OK for 10 random primes up to `10^4` rather than all of them since that takes about 18s to run.

Hi John,

you could do two tests: 
* a quick one that is run per default 
* a long one marked with `#long` - 18 seconds is not a problem with long.

Cheers,

Sage now uses the same seed per default for randomness at the start of each doctest, so it is reproducible. Not all sources of randomness have that property yet, but for primes it should work. So no need to stick `#random` in the doctest string.
