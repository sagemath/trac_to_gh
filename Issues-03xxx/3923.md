Jinja is required for the ReST transition of the documentation, so I am very bullish that it will get in. In total the ReST tool chain in 4 spkg weights in at 2MB compressed total and since it is a large improvement over the current situation with latex2html I think it will happen soon. Mike Hansen is pretty much ready to go here and it seems likely that those changes will be in 3.2.x if not 3.2 (assuming the spkgs get voted in obviously :))
