I'm working on #3905 and want to use `integer.pyx` as a showcase on how to use AUTHORs tags and copyright. Unfortunately, the file only has William as copyright holder although many people touched it a lot. 

So I did something **nasty** and added a bunch of copyright notices. I don't know if I'm legally allowed to do that so I looking for consent/dissent by the the authors. 

Feel free to shoot this one down, I'll have to look for a different example then.
