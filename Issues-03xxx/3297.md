Tim Abbott made a patch to get cddlib to use libtools and easily
produce a shared library. Packaging the change for sage means not 
only patching several Makefile.am file but also adding a file 
ltmain.sh and regenerating configure.in, configure, aclocal.m4
and several Makefile.in.
I attach a tarball containing an updated patch folder and also 
a patch to spkg-install to use it. The new spkg-install only build
shared libraries.

We should update to the latest cddlib release while we are at it. I see no point in sticking all those files in patches into the mercurial repo since that means checking in 1.3MB of files that will be removed in the next upstream release anyway.

Please do not attach tar.gz archives to trac ticket since a bug prevents the download the easy way, i.e. just follow the link and you will see.

Hi Micheal,

the latest upstream release was already 094f when I filled the bug.
I sent a patch against 094f upstream but never got an answer.

Upstream is unresponsive. I don't see the point to copy over a massive amount of changes making the spkg at least twice as large. This is also purely a Debian thing, but we could just ship in place modified sources with instructions on how to get from upstream to this. Once upstream updates (if ever) we could sync.

OK I had done some of the work against 0.94f already but I guess skpg-install at least
will need to be rebased. I will look at it later today.

Took me longer than expected to get around this.
It is a big patch when you include all the necessary regenerated files.
Is it OK to attach it compressed (241K compressed, 1.1M uncompressed).
Also do we disable the static library or do we build both?
