Tim Abbott made a patch to get cddlib to use libtools and easily
produce a shared library. Packaging the change for sage means not 
only patching several Makefile.am file but also adding a file 
ltmain.sh and regenerating configure.in, configure, aclocal.m4
and several Makefile.in.
I attach a tarball containing an updated patch folder and also 
a patch to spkg-install to use it. The new spkg-install only build
shared libraries.

Upstream is unresponsive. I don't see the point to copy over a massive amount of changes making the spkg at least twice as large. This is also purely a Debian thing, but we could just ship in place modified sources with instructions on how to get from upstream to this. Once upstream updates (if ever) we could sync.

It is a big patch when you include all the necessary regenerated files.
Is it OK to attach it compressed (241K compressed, 1.1M uncompressed).
Also do we disable the static library or do we build both?
