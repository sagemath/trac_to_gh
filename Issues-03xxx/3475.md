Yi,

can you split off the "missing jquery.form.js from setup.py" part from the jquery update? The copy part of the patch is trivial to review and will get into 3.0.4, I am not so sure about the jquery update since that should be done by somebody who works on the notebook and withb `@`interact for example.

Cheers,

Michael

Michael,

The jquery update is a non issue since AFAIK the notebook does not use the jquery version dsage uses. 

It uses the one found here:

iapetus:~/Software/sage-3.0.3.rc0/data/extcode/notebook/javascript/jquery > 

Maybe in the future we can simply provide one version, but that is another issue. Let me know if this resolves your complaint.

I agree that there are two copies of jquery and we can upgrade DSage's copy without having any repercussions on the notebook one. Positive review.
