Is it possible to put links in the trackback messages that refer to
lines in the current noteook (as opposed to stuff in the sage or
python libraries) so that you can jump to that line?  I have found
that the code that it spits out is usually very ambiguous (and there
are no line numbers, another potentially useful feature) and so its
hard to find the line where the error occurs.

Thanks,
Eric

Nick Alexander's sage mode does something like this so it should be doable.
