```
When you sign up for a Sage Notebook account, Sage sends an e-mail to
the address you provide giving you a link to complete the
registration.

First of all, the "Sign up for a Sage Notebook account" says that the
e-mail is needed if you forget your password, but makes no mention of
the fact that the e-mail will be needed immediately to complete the
registration process. If Sage asks for a user's e-mail address, it
should correctly indicate what that e-mail address is for. Otherwise,
e-mail from the Sage notebook is technically spam.

Secondly, I am running the Sage notebook on a machine which my
college's support staff will not allow to run a mail server (all of
the mail on campus needs to be handled by their own antiquated
servers, which has less storage space than my iPod to store e-mail for
2000 users). Is there any way to turn off the sending of e-mail from
the Sage Notebook?

Thanks for the clarification. This can easily be resolved by  
commenting out line ~1716 of sage/server/notebook/twist.py. This  
should probably be made optional and configurable somewhere.

1986                send_mail(self, fromaddr, destaddr, "Sage Notebook Registration",body)

If 3.0.6 comes out few days after August 1st then instead of copying this out I'll make the email inputbox optional by the admin with the default set to False.

'email_system' = False
