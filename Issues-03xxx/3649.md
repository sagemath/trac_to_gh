```
When you sign up for a Sage Notebook account, Sage sends an e-mail to
the address you provide giving you a link to complete the
registration.

First of all, the "Sign up for a Sage Notebook account" says that the
e-mail is needed if you forget your password, but makes no mention of
the fact that the e-mail will be needed immediately to complete the
registration process. If Sage asks for a user's e-mail address, it
should correctly indicate what that e-mail address is for. Otherwise,
e-mail from the Sage notebook is technically spam.

Secondly, I am running the Sage notebook on a machine which my
college's support staff will not allow to run a mail server (all of
the mail on campus needs to be handled by their own antiquated
servers, which has less storage space than my iPod to store e-mail for
2000 users). Is there any way to turn off the sending of e-mail from
the Sage Notebook?

Thanks for the clarification. This can easily be resolved by  
commenting out line ~1716 of sage/server/notebook/twist.py. This  
should probably be made optional and configurable somewhere.
