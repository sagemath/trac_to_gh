```
When you sign up for a Sage Notebook account, Sage sends an e-mail to
the address you provide giving you a link to complete the
registration.

First of all, the "Sign up for a Sage Notebook account" says that the
e-mail is needed if you forget your password, but makes no mention of
the fact that the e-mail will be needed immediately to complete the
registration process. If Sage asks for a user's e-mail address, it
should correctly indicate what that e-mail address is for. Otherwise,
e-mail from the Sage notebook is technically spam.

Secondly, I am running the Sage notebook on a machine which my
college's support staff will not allow to run a mail server (all of
the mail on campus needs to be handled by their own antiquated
servers, which has less storage space than my iPod to store e-mail for
2000 users). Is there any way to turn off the sending of e-mail from
the Sage Notebook?

Thanks for the clarification. This can easily be resolved by

1985            try:
1986                send_mail(self, fromaddr, destaddr, "Sage Notebook Registration",body)

1988            except ValueError:
1989                pass
```

If 3.0.6 comes out few days after August 1st then instead of copying this out I'll make the email inputbox optional by the admin with the default set to False.

'email_system' = False
