Matrices with prescribed density are not generated correctly:

```
sage: M = random_matrix(GF(65537), 100, 100, sparse=True, density=0.1)
sage: len(M.nonzero_positions())
940
sage: M = random_matrix(GF(2), 100, 100, sparse=True, density=0.1)
sage: len(M.nonzero_positions())
465
```

To wit: the actual density of the matrix over GF(2) is only approximately half of what we expect. This happens because the randomize() function populating the entries does not check whether the random element picked actually is non-zero. Apparently, all of the matrix classes are affected by this bug.

When I tried this, I got answers like the first two: the ratio of (fraction of nonzero entries) / (density) was about 4/5.  This is consistent with the observation in the ticket description that the randomize function doesn't check whether the random element is zero: for integers, the documentation for `random_element` says that the default distribution gives `Pr(X = 0) = 1/5`. 

I would try to write a patch for this but pretty much all of the matrix code is written in Cython, which I don't know, so anything I write would likely be buggy and slow things down by a factor of 100.

Attached a patch.  It introduces a new method in ``ring.pyx``, ``_random_nonzero_element``, which by default calls ``random_element`` until a non-zero element has been obtained.

On the matrix end, I've introduced a new parameter ``nonzero`` to the ``randomize`` methods in the various matrix implementations.  If this is set to ``True``, the modified entries are guaranteed to be non-zero, whereas if it is set to ``False`` they are not.  The method ``random_element`` on a matrix space now calls ``randomize`` on a zero matrix with ``nonzero=True``.

Finally, this is now also used to ensure that generating a fraction field element does not cause a division by zero error.

I think that is the same reason why certain matrices have their ``randomize`` methods implemented themselves in the very first place:  speed.

Personally, I don't really care about this (the speed of generating random matrices), but since others do, I don't think this patch should make anything significantly slower.

I've now finished the implementation, but I still need to re-base it.  Here are some timings.  First, the old implementation:

```
sage: MS = MatrixSpace(CyclotomicField(10), 100, 100)
sage: timeit('A = MS.random_element()')
25 loops, best of 3: 17.5 ms per loop
sage: timeit('A = MS.random_element(density=0.1)')
25 loops, best of 3: 8.89 ms per loop
sage: A = MS.random_element(density=0.1)
sage: n(len(A.nonzero_positions())/10000)
0.231700000000000
```
Second, the new implementation:

```
sage: MS = MatrixSpace(CyclotomicField(10), 100, 100)
sage: timeit('A = MS.random_element()')
25 loops, best of 3: 22 ms per loop
sage: timeit('A = MS.random_element(density=0.1)')
25 loops, best of 3: 9.36 ms per loop
sage: timeit('A = MS.random_element(density=0.1, nonzero=True)')
25 loops, best of 3: 9.35 ms per loop
sage: timeit('A = MS.random_element(density=0.1, nonzero=False)')
25 loops, best of 3: 9.37 ms per loop
sage: A = MS.random_element(density=0.1, nonzero=True)
sage: n(len(A.nonzero_positions())/10000)
0.0963000000000000
```

Tom suggested that we should change the code for random matrix generation over cyclotomic fields to rely on the random element generation code in the cyclotomic field, mostly in order to reduce code size.

The patch above now ensures that the polynomial quotient rings (and number fields) pass on additional arguments.

This patch should be applied in addition to all the other ones, in any case.

The next step is to compare the timings of the above code to Tom's suggestion.  If there is no noticeable speed difference, we should go with Tom's suggestion as it provides for cleaner code.  Otherwise, we should leave it done in the above patches.  We'll see.

Here are the timings for the code that Tom wrote, which gets rid of the "ugly" code I wrote for generating the random matrices over cyclotomic fields and instead uses the generic code of random elements in cyclotomic fields (implemented by two of the patches above):

```
sage: MS = MatrixSpace(CyclotomicField(10), 100, 100)
sage: time A = MS.random_element()
CPU times: user 27.11 s, sys: 0.35 s, total: 27.46 s
Wall time: 27.46 s
```

I suspect that the slowness of this code is largely due to the fact that for every random element of the cyclotomic field, two conversions take place.  One of a random list of rationals into the polynomial ring, and then another of that polynomial into the polynomial quotient ring.

I don't think there is much we can do about this at the moment.  Thus, I propose that we should apply all of the patches on this ticket apart from ``trac3436-tb.patch``.  I'll flatten them a little, (1) main patch (2) ``random_element`` in polynomial rings, polynomial quotient rings, and number fields.  Hopefully, this will then pass all doctests and we'll be done.

Any comments?

PS: Of course, I'll include the fixed doctests (64-bit difference) from Tom's patch.
