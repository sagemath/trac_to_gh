I tried to register twice on the online notebook at https://sage.math.washington.edu:8102,
and after the registration page it says that my user name is taken (as
expected). But, it still sends me a confirmation email. I click on the
registration confirmation link and it says that I've confirmed.
It shouldn't send the email at all.
(it also does the same thing at 8103)
