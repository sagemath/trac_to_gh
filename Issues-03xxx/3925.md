I added some checks and doctests, and made Primes() use this.

This is still a work-in-progress. TODO:

* Turn primegen-0.97 into a .spkg. It needs an added -fPIC option since it will be linked into a cython extension module.

* Make sage.rings.arith.primes(start,stop) also use this for n not too small and not too large.

* Determine if there are predefined portable uint32/uint64 types available for use in cython.

I've added an attempt at an .spkg for primegen-0.97 as an attachment, and also took the liberty of patching (untested...) spkg/install and spkg/standard/deps to build it automatically when installing sage. (In the 'spkg_deps' patch.)

I'm not entirely confident the build system of the library will work everywhere, since it is rather non-standard, but hopefully it is portable enough.

The library is tiny, with the .spkg only 32KB, and the compiled (Linux x86_64) library only 17KB.

Timing:

```
def f():    
    P = Primes()
    for p in P:
        if p > 10^8:
            break
time f()
```

goes from 84.17s (without this spkg+patch) to 20.77s (with spkg+patch) on a 2GHz Opteron.

Hi John. The first patch isn't necessary to use the spkg. It's only for making a fresh 'make' of sage automatically build the spkg. I'm not too sure sure if that patch is right, actually; that part should probably be left to a release manager.

OK, I'll have another go sometime this weekend.  I'm glad about the first patch, since I'm not really competent to say if it's right (though it looks ok).

To adopt this spkg as part of Sage
proper would need a vote on sage-devel.  I suggest that wjp helps that process
by collecting some data (before and after).  For example:

```
sage: time P = prime_range(10^8)
CPU times: user 1.83 s, sys: 0.50 s, total: 2.32 s
Wall time: 2.33 s
sage: len(P)
5761455
```
but this does not use the new PrimeGen class.  I tried this (with the
new spkg + patch):

```
sage: pg=Primes().pg
sage: pg.reset()
sage: N=pg.count(10^8)
sage: pg.reset()
sage: time P=[pg.next() for _ in range(N)]
CPU times: user 4.98 s, sys: 0.03 s, total: 5.01 s
Wall time: 5.02 s
```
which is slower but it's using a more stupid method to collect the
primes that in prime_range().

Changing this to "needs work" given John's latest comments.  Note that "work" here would mean making the case to sage-devel that the spkg should be adopted, and asking for a vote.
