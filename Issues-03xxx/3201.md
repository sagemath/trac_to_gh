```

A subtle problem with "%latex" cells is illustrated at
<http://www-maths.swan.ac.uk/staff/fwc/sage-notebook-latex.tiff>

When "\\" occurs at the end of a line it seems to gooble the first
character in the next line.

I'm using Mac OS X 10.4.11, and the same thing happens both Firefox
and Safari.

I can confirm that this sort of bug is very likely to happen.  I think \ parsing
gets done before the code gets sent to latex.eval or something like that.  It's an
interesting bug, and definitely something that needs to get fixed.

This is caused by the line

```

in worksheet.py.  This should be cleaner to fix after some other changes I have planned.  This is here just as a reminder to me.
