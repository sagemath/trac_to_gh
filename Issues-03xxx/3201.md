```

A subtle problem with "%latex" cells is illustrated at
<http://www-maths.swan.ac.uk/staff/fwc/sage-notebook-latex.tiff>

When "\\" occurs at the end of a line it seems to gooble the first
character in the next line.

I'm using Mac OS X 10.4.11, and the same thing happens both Firefox
and Safari.

gets done before the code gets sent to latex.eval or something like that.  It's an
