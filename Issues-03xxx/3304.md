Has nothing to do with Debian, maybe that was misleading; summary changed.

The following spkg is patched in a similar way. It essentially contains tabbott's patch, but I found this report only after making the changes myself.

http://www.stp.dias.ie/~vbraun/cddlib-094f.p3.spkg 

Users of the Fedora 12 binary sage distribution must manually re-install mpir-1.2.2.p0.spkg as discussed on http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/msg/aec4aa6b3874fe10. This is an unrelated bug of the build system.

```
As I understand,

http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/3304

should be just closed, not reviewed, since another ticket took care of
the issue.

Since only release managers should close tickets, I am leaving the
ticket as is and posting here.

Thank you,
Andrey
