Jason,

You need to stop polluting trac like this. If there was already a ticket for this, you should have put your comments there. Also, I'd like to point out how annoying it is when someone opens a bunch of wishlist tickets with no intention of supplying any patches.

Sorry.  I didn't remember there was already a ticket for this until I was going through tickets the other day; apparently I should have searched more carefully.  The reason I opened a few tickets is because I saw that it looked like there was work that could be included and didn't want to lose the reference (especially for this ticket, which is something that would be nice to have).

However, I think in this case a post to sage-devel asking about the projects from the wiki page would have been better than to create tickets for each one.  Sorry for the annoyance.

Third, I do intend to post patches eventually, if someone else doesn't beat me to it.  As I have time, I go through all the tickets I've entered and work on patches.  The reason to put them up on trac is to make sure that the idea doesn't get lost.

From my reading of the [source code](http://wiki.wstein.org/2008/480a/theprojects?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=max_flow_min_cut.py), it looks like the code is using the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm, which is pretty bad for some corner cases. And its complexity is in general not polynomial. Of course, one obvious way to get polynomial complexity is to use the modified algorithm by Edmonds and Karp. Chapter 6 from the following text is very relevant to this ticket.
