<a id='comment:2'></a>Jason,

You need to stop polluting trac like this. If there was already a ticket for this, you should have put your comments there. Also, I'd like to point out how annoying it is when someone opens a bunch of wishlist tickets with no intention of supplying any patches.

From my reading of the [source code](http://wiki.wstein.org/2008/480a/theprojects?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=max_flow_min_cut.py), it looks like the code is using the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm, which is pretty bad for some corner cases. And its complexity is in general not polynomial. Of course, one obvious way to get polynomial complexity is to use the modified algorithm by Edmonds and Karp. Chapter 6 from the following text is very relevant to this ticket.
