Bug was actually with modular symbols -- when finding eigenvalues, there was a place where the name parameter didn't get passed along. As a result, the eigenvalue getting returned couldn't be coerced into the number field, and all hell broke loose. 

Fixed, added a doctest to catch it (to modular symbols, not abelian varieties).
