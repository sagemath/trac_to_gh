Currently `-tp` doctests the three pbuild files 

* sagebuild.py
* clib.py
* build.py

Don't do it :).

I need to check if `-t` also picks up those files or if they are treated differently. We certainly don't doctest setup.py.

Cheers,

Michael

I now tend to blame this on my stupidity doctesting devel/sage instead of devel/sage/sage as I should. But I am also wondering whether to add `nodoctest` to the three files above nonetheless to prevent accidental testing.
