The help page given by attach? claims:

```
        Type attached_files() for a list of all currently attached files.
        You can remove files from this list to stop them from being watched. 
```

In fact, this has no effect when I try it:

```
sage: version()
'SAGE Version 2.10.1, Release Date: 2008-02-02'
sage: attached_files()
['/mit/price/tmp/hessian.sage']
sage: attached_files().pop()
'/mit/price/tmp/hessian.sage'
sage: attached_files()
['/mit/price/tmp/hessian.sage']
```


Component: **documentation**

Work Issues: **Already fixed**

OK, that's one possible response.  I'd like to be able to make Sage stop watching a file, though; either in the admittedly hackish way the documentation describes, or by a "detach" or "unattach" command.

Thanks,
Greg

Yes, I thought we had either a detach or unattach command, but I couldn't find either one. So it has either been discussed and never implemented or it isn't in the global namespace. Either way it should be fixed.

Michael
