| SAGE Version 3.0.5, Release Date: 2008-07-11                       |
| Type notebook() for the GUI, and license() for information.        |
----------------------------------------------------------------------

sage: [prime_pi(n) for n in [500508..500510]]
[41580, 45056, 41581]
sage: [prime_pi(n) for n in [500508..500510]]
[41580, 41581, 41581]
```

The problem lies with pari/gp:

```
sage: %gp

  --> Switching to GP/PARI interpreter <-- 

''
gp: for(n=500508, 500510, print(primepi(n)))

41580
45056
  *** primepi: not enough precomputed primes, need primelimit ~ 500510.
```

The attached patch fixes the issue. This was a strange case -- in some cases, Pari is more than happy to return an (incorrect!) answer when you call `primepi` with a number larger than the prime limit. This patch fixes this in a uniform way.
