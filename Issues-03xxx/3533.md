This attached patch makes several changes to
`sage/rings/number_field/number_field.py` and
`sage/rings/number_field/morphism.py` that are mainly concerned with
improving performance for cyclotomic fields, but also tidy up various
other things.  The main changes are summarised below.


There is a serious bug in `roots_of_unity` when applied to relative number 
fields:

```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField([x^2 + 3, x^2 + 1])
sage: K.roots_of_unity()
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```
But

```
sage: K.absolute_field('b').roots_of_unity()
[1/8*b^3 + 1/4*b^2 + 3/4*b + 1,
 1/8*b^3 + 5/4*b + 1/2,
...
```
so it is clear how to deal with the problem.

In addition, the `roots_of_unity` and `number_of_roots_of_unity` methods can
rather obviously be made **much** faster for cyclotomic fields.  

Similarly, I've written a method for listing the embeddings of a cyclotomic field in
a number field which runs much more quickly than at present.

For the general case of finding embeddings of number fields, at the moment
SAGE asks PARI to look for roots when a simple degree check indicates that
there are none.  It is, of course, very easy to avoid this wasted time.

A method for complex embeddings of cyclotomic fields already exists, but it
is inadequate in two ways.  First, it handles the default precision in a
different way from the method for generic complex embeddings.  Second, it
fails to cache the result.  These faults have been corrected, and the
change in respect of precision also applied to `complex_embedding` (in the
singular).

There is also a slight problem with the `embeddings` function (used by
the generic `complex_embeddings` and `real_embeddings`).  It caches its
output, but the first time it is called it returns something different from
what has been cached (a `list` rather than a `Sequence`).  This has been
changed for both the generic field and the relative field methods.  In
addition the code now avoids the printing of empty lists of field embeddings on
three lines.

I've added a method for real embeddings of cyclotomic fields.  Nobody who 
knows what they're doing would use this function, but it might as well be 
efficient.

Many other functions can be speeded up for cyclotomic fields, 
because of the vast amount of theory about these fields.  As well as the 
above, I've implemented `signature`, `discriminant` and `is_isomorphic` 
for cyclotomic fields.  Probably more could be done.  Galois groups are an 
obvious example, but that had better wait until ticket #133 is sorted out.

Some of the existing doctests have been moved when they apply to 
cyclotomic fields.  Others have been added.

Review report by John Cremona:

1. The aims of the patch all look good to me.
2. Reading the patch diffs it looked ok.  It would be better if someone else took a look too.
3. The patch applied cleanly to 3.0.4.alpha0
4. I tested all the number_fields directory but found the following failures:

```

These do not look serious, they are to do with outputting floating point numbers, but there must be a way to get the tests to pass ("#random low order bits" if desperate).

The varying results for `abs` derive from the changed default precision 
used for cyclotomic fields (so that they're compatible with generic number 
fields).  Using the generic methods, the same answers are obtained (with or without the patch) for 

```
sage: z = NumberField(cyclotomic_polynomial(7), 'a').gen()
sage: abs(z)
1.0
sage: (z^2 + 17*z - 3).abs(i=5)
16.06044268
```
(`i=5` is necessary because the ordering of the embeddings is different 
for the two ways of constructing the same field.)

I have therefore made the appropriate changes to the doctest in `number_field_element.pyx`
in a new patch.

The second doctest failure is both more trivial and more worrying.  I 
don't actually understand the following behaviour:

```
sage: z = exp(I*pi/2); z
I
sage: [CDF(I), CDF(z)]
[1.0*I, 6.12303176911e-17 + 1.0*I]
```

But anyway, the issue here is nothing to do with number fields.  The easy
way out is to change the example to make it less trivial, and this is done
in the new patch.

Haven't tried it with 3.0.4.alpha0, but with 3.0.3 and both patches all 
tests pass.

Does this explain it?

```
sage: z = exp(I*pi/2); z
I
sage: type(z)           
<class 'sage.calculus.calculus.SymbolicComposition'>
sage: type(I)           
<class 'sage.functions.constants.I_class'>
```
So z displays as I but it is not I.  Hmmm

```
sage: z is I
False
sage: z == I
I == I
sage: bool(z == I)
True
```

I'll check out the second patch now.

The only difference is in the order of the 4 elements in the list.
I think you need to apply sort() to the list returned by `complex_embeddings()` to ensure consistency.

I think the order of embeddings is reasonable: in terms of the powers of a
primitive n-th root.  But what this failure has exposed is that
`CDF.zeta(n)` uses the generic method in `ring.pyx`.  This certainly needs
changing.  At the moment we have

```
sage: version()
'SAGE Version 3.0.3, Release Date: 2008-06-17'
sage: timeit('CDF.zeta(117)')
5 loops, best of 3: 42.3 ms per loop
sage: timeit('ComplexField(64).zeta(117)')
625 loops, best of 3: 77 µs per loop
```
`CDF` is supposed to be *faster* than `ComplexField`!

I've written a patch to include a new `zeta` method for `CDF` and modify
two doctests so that they comply.  All tests pass with 3.0.3.

After the patch:

```
sage: timeit('CDF.zeta(117)')
625 loops, best of 3: 22.9 µs per loop
```

I don't think there are likely to be any coercion problems, since all the
code in these patches is just a minor adaptation of code used elsewhere.

The patches (all three in succession) apply cleanly to 3.0.4.alpha0, and all tests (in sage/rings/number_field) pass.

To be really picky,  the new CDF.zeta(n) returns None if n<=0.  This could conceivably trip someone up -- and I haven't checked to see what the other .zeta() functions do for arguments which are not positive.  I think one might argue for CDF.zeta(-n)=CDF.zeta(n) and CDF.zeta(0)=1, but it might be better to throw a ValueError if n<1.
 
In the 4th patch sage.3533c.patch I added tests to this effect and corresponding doctests.  I also deleted some weird stuff at the end of complex_double.pyx which I assume is garbage.

Attachment [trac_3533_doctest_fixes.patch](tarball://root/attachments/some-uuid/ticket3533/trac_3533_doctest_fixes.patch) by mabshoff created at 2008-07-06 17:49:29

Note that in the last doctest fix patch I am removing

```
e.gauss_sum_numerical() 
```
from dirichlet.py since it is numerically unstable and would require an ellipsis at the start of a line which is not allowed. We still test the absolute, so I think we are covered.

Cheers,
