This got a positive review (see above).

Actually this breaks all the new doctests in worksheet.py that assume that that server.notebook
has been imported.  The fix will be to write a function that imports sage.server.notebook and
makes a sample notebook; this will be even cleaner actually. I'll attach this soon.
