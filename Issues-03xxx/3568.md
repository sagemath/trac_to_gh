AFTER (also, apply #3560):

```
teragon-2:notebook was$ sage -startuptime |grep web2
teragon-2:notebook was$ 
```

And if you apply #3560 maybe something like this:

```
teragon-2:notebook was$ sage -startuptime |grep notebook
      notebook.all: 0.005 (sage.server.all)
       notebook_object: 0.003 (notebook.all)

This got a positive review (see above).

Actually this breaks all the new doctests in worksheet.py that assume that that server.notebook
has been imported.  The fix will be to write a function that imports sage.server.notebook and
makes a sample notebook; this will be even cleaner actually. I'll attach this soon.

I had some doctest problems with 3.0.6, due to not importing a module, that are now fixed.

Apply only `3568-was-notebook-startup-and-test-object.patch`}.
