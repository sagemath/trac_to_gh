Aside from that it is *highly*
recommended to build from source if you are developing since mixing
and matching different compiler releases [even on OSX] can lead to odd
results, i.e. Heisenbugs and segfaults.

Is there a reason why people shouldn't do it? Since when did we stop supporting developing with binaries?

On the index of the Developer's Guide (http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/index.html) it mentions needing the source code which implies that you can't develop from only a binary.

I think that should be sufficient but maybe we need to **direct users in README.md to "read the Developer's Guide"** if they would like to contribute. This is already the advice given in the "Development" link on the main website (http://www.sagemath.org/development.html) as well as the contributing FAQ (http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/faq/faq-contribute.html) where it also says to "...grab a copy of the Sage source...".

So, if anything, we can **change the wording in the Developer's Guide to be less suggestive** since that's where all roads to getting started in development should lead.
