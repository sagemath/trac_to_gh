Maybe there is a good reason that I currently cannot think of.

I think that should be sufficient but maybe we need to **direct users in README.md to "read the Developer's Guide"** if they would like to contribute. This is already the advice given in the "Development" link on the main website (http://www.sagemath.org/development.html) as well as the contributing FAQ (http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/faq/faq-contribute.html) where it also says to "...grab a copy of the Sage source...".

So, if anything, we can **change the wording in the Developer's Guide to be less suggestive** since that's where all roads to getting started in development should lead.

No problem.

While we're on the topic, the errata ([http://wiki.sagemath.org/errata](http://wiki.sagemath.org/errata)) links to an empty wiki page but I couldn't find the proper location. Let me know if you have a suggestion for fixing it.
