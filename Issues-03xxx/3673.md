The present definition of the `NumberFieldElement` class unreasonably 
privileges the polynomial variable 'x'.  As a result the following fails:

```
sage: y = polygen(QQ, 'y'); K.<a> = NumberField(y^2 - 2)
sage: S = K.subfields()
sage: S[0][1]
```
The patch amends the definition of `__init__` for the 
`NumberFieldElement` class to deal with this.

An extra doctest for the `subfields` method has been included.  Two other 
doctests have been adjusted to match the revised code.

By the way: Report 11 did not pick up this ticket since there is an extra space between "positive" and "review".

Cheers,
