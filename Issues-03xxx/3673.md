The present definition of the `NumberFieldElement` class unreasonably 
privileges the polynomial variable 'x'.  As a result the following fails:

```
sage: y = polygen(QQ, 'y'); K.<a> = NumberField(y^2 - 2)
sage: S = K.subfields()
sage: S[0][1]
```
The patch amends the definition of `__init__` for the 
`NumberFieldElement` class to deal with this.

An extra doctest for the `subfields` method has been included.  Two other 
doctests have been adjusted to match the revised code.

The patch applies cleanly to 3.1.alpha0.  It does what it says, and all doctests in sage.rings.number_field pass.  Publish!

By the way: Report 11 did not pick up this ticket since there is an extra space between "positive" and "review".
