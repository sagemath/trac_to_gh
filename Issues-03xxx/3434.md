Try this in the notebook

```
@interact
def test(a=1):
    print 2^a
```

For large a it outputs something massive and very very bad. This should not be aloud. 

To fix this:

1. Look at

```
            self.interact = input[len('%__sage_interact__')+1]
```
in cell.py
2. Factor out this code from cell.py:

```
        if 'notruncate' not in output and 'Output truncated!' not in output and \
              (len(output) > MAX_OUTPUT or output.count('\n') > MAX_OUTPUT_LINES) and \
```
