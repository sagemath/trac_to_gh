All PolyBoRi iterators only destruct the iterator objects but never the object they act on. However, since we assign objects and not pointers/references a copy is triggered during creation and thus the destructor of the object ought to be called on self destruction of the iterator. So far the theory. In practice, while I didn't see any problems, I'd appreciate if somebody with more intime knowledge of the interface would take a careful look.

The iterator wrappers keep a reference to the objects only to be able to check if the iterator reaches the end. As in the following (from `BooleanMonomialVariableIterator.__next__`):

```
if self.iter.equal(self.obj.variableEnd()):
    raise StopIteration
```

The objects that iterators act on are wrapped by python objects, e.g. there is a corresponding `BooleanMonomial` object associated to the `PBMonom` the iterator is acting on. Python should keep track of the memory of `BooleanMonomial`, so python will deallocate that `PBMonom` by calling the `__dealloc__` method of `BooleanMonomial`. Calling the destructor of `PBMonom` from any other place would lead to segfaults.

Actually, it might be a good idea to add a reference to the `BooleanMonomial` object in the iterator as well. We wouldn't want python to garbage collect that while the iterator is still around. 

Another problem you might want to ponder: We don't explicitly call the constructor of any iterator other than that of `BooleSet`, yet we still call their destructors. If we need to call the constructor, how do we get away without it most of the time? If we don't, why is `BooleSet` special?

Comments?

If that's the only reason for the object, we could add some kind of isEnd() and skip the reference. If fact, the PolyBoRi-Iterators have the member function isZero(), which is equivalent to this.

The iterators (upstream at C++) carry all references, which are need by them. For iterators in lexicographical rings, this is very much like - for instance -  std::vector-iterators, which do not have knowledge of the vector they belong to. (The degree-lexicographical have internal references to the polynomial structure.)
But using "isZero()" avoid the problem anyway.

> Another problem you might want to ponder: We don't explicitly call the constructor of any iterator other than that of `BooleSet`, yet we still call their destructors. If we need to call the constructor, how do we get away without it most of the time? If we don't, why is `BooleSet` special?

Good question, the iterators, which obey the ring ordering, like the iterators of polynomials, are wrapped by a shread-pointer construction, which is not the case for BooleSet iterators. Does that make any difference? 
What actually happens, if you use code like the one from new_BPI_from_PBPolyIter for
new_BSI_from_PBSetIter (including the function arguments)?

I still have few experience in pyx code, but any kind of differences between the iterator types should not make any problems, because in both cases constructors, copy-constructors and destructors care for the memory management on c++-side. 

Best regards,
  Alexander

You are right, my postings were isleading. 
In my last comment, I wanted to say that
`BoolePolynomial::const_iterator`  (`BooleanPolynomialIterator`) has the `isZero()` functionality, which could already be used in attachment:trac3283_bpi_object_reference.patch.
(For `BooleanMonomialIterator` `isValid()` does the job, but 
`BooleanMonomialVariableIterator`, does not own it.)

In comment 3, I had meant, that I could add such some kind of `isEnd()` function upstream, for instance using `isZero()` for `BoolePolynomial::const_iterator`. 

But now - after all these confusions - I must admit, that I first have to add this functionality to have a consistent interface for this test on all PolyBoRi iterators.

I apologize for the trouble caused,
  Alexander

Two small problems:
* adding `equal` to `ctypedef struct PBPolyVectorIter` seems to be redundant.
* `BooleanPolynomialVectorIterator` does not deallocate `self._end`

Other than these a very positive review. Thanks for sorting out the iterators in the polybori wrapper malb. :)
