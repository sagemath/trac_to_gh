All PolyBoRi iterators only destruct the iterator objects but never the object they act on. However, since we assign objects and not pointers/references a copy is triggered during creation and thus the destructor of the object ought to be called on self destruction of the iterator. So far the theory. In practice, while I didn't see any problems, I'd appreciate if somebody with more intime knowledge of the interface would take a careful look.

But we should wait for Burcin's opinion, as he knows best.

Also, one should check somewhen, whether the object is still necessary in the interface for recent PolyBoRi.

The iterator wrappers keep a reference to the objects only to be able to check if the iterator reaches the end. As in the following (from `BooleanMonomialVariableIterator.__next__`):

```
if self.iter.equal(self.obj.variableEnd()):
    raise StopIteration
```

The objects that iterators act on are wrapped by python objects, e.g. there is a corresponding `BooleanMonomial` object associated to the `PBMonom` the iterator is acting on. Python should keep track of the memory of `BooleanMonomial`, so python will deallocate that `PBMonom` by calling the `__dealloc__` method of `BooleanMonomial`. Calling the destructor of `PBMonom` from any other place would lead to segfaults.

Actually, it might be a good idea to add a reference to the `BooleanMonomial` object in the iterator as well. We wouldn't want python to garbage collect that while the iterator is still around. 

Another problem you might want to ponder: We don't explicitly call the constructor of any iterator other than that of `BooleSet`, yet we still call their destructors. If we need to call the constructor, how do we get away without it most of the time? If we don't, why is `BooleSet` special?

Comments?

The iterators (upstream at C++) carry all references, which are need by them. For iterators in lexicographical rings, this is very much like - for instance -  std::vector-iterators, which do not have knowledge of the vector they belong to. (The degree-lexicographical have internal references to the polynomial structure.)
But using "isZero()" avoid the problem anyway.

Good question, the iterators, which obey the ring ordering, like the iterators of polynomials, are wrapped by a shread-pointer construction, which is not the case for BooleSet iterators. Does that make any difference? 
What actually happens, if you use code like the one from new_BPI_from_PBPolyIter for
new_BSI_from_PBSetIter (including the function arguments)?

I still have few experience in pyx code, but any kind of differences between the iterator types should not make any problems, because in both cases constructors, copy-constructors and destructors care for the memory management on c++-side.

So we remove the `_end` members and add a Python level reference to the original object (polynomial, monomial, set). This should prevent the GC from killing the original object.

`BoolePolynomial::const_iterator`  (`BooleanPolynomialIterator`) has the `isZero()` functionality, which could already be used in [attachment: trac3283_bpi_object_reference.patch..gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket3283/trac3283_bpi_object_reference.patch..gz)
(For `BooleanMonomialIterator` `isValid()` does the job, but

In comment 3, I had meant, that I could add such some kind of `isEnd()` function upstream, for instance using `isZero()` for `BoolePolynomial::const_iterator`. 

But now - after all these confusions - I must admit, that I first have to add this functionality to have a consistent interface for this test on all PolyBoRi iterators.

I apologize for the trouble caused,

Two small problems:
* adding `equal` to `ctypedef struct PBPolyVectorIter` seems to be redundant.
* `BooleanPolynomialVectorIterator` does not deallocate `self._end`

Other than these a very positive review. Thanks for sorting out the iterators in the polybori wrapper malb. :)
