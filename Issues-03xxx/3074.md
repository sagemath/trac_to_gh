Hi Robert,

I am curious about the supposed repo status. In the spkg we have an unclean state:

```
! .hgtags
! Demos/callback/Makefile
! Demos/callback/Makefile.nodistutils
! Demos/callback/README.txt
! Demos/callback/Setup.py
! Demos/callback/cheesefinder.c
! Demos/callback/cheesefinder.h
! Demos/callback/run_cheese.py
! Demos/embed/Makefile
! Demos/embed/Makefile.msc
! Demos/embed/Makefile.msc.static
! Demos/embed/Makefile.unix
! Demos/embed/README
! Demos/embed/embedded.pyx
! Demos/embed/main.c
! Demos/pyprimes.py
! Demos/run_numeric_demo.py
! Demos/run_primes.py
! Demos/run_spam.py
! bin/update_references
! tests/compile/altet1.pyx.BROKEN
! tests/compile/belchenko2.pyx.BROKEN
! tests/compile/burton1.pyx.BROKEN
! tests/compile/getattr3ref.pyx.BROKEN
! tests/compile/hinsen1.pyx.BROKEN
? Cython/Compiler/Lexicon.pickle
? Demos/api.pyx
? Demos/api2.pxd
? Demos/append.pyx
? Demos/builtin_types.pyx
? Demos/public_enums.pyx
? Demos/repr.pyx
? Demos/weakref.pxd
? Demos/weakref.pyx
? Demos/weakref2.pyx
? PKG-INFO
? tests/run/public_enums.pyx
```
So: we can either nuke the .hg repo from the spkg or clean it up. It is your call :).

Provided Sage builds and doctests fine I will merge this spkg even with the slightly dirty repo since going back to a clean upstream is more important than some odd repo state IMHO.

Cheers,

Michael

I think this is due to a difference in the MANIFEST file vs. the files tracked by hg. (I did python setup.py sdist and then made the spkg from that). I'll be sure to clean it up before the next release, but it shouldn't affect anything. Thanks for pointing this out.
