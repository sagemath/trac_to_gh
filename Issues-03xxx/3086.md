This is most likely cause by R not using Sage's readline. There is a similar issue with R not picking Sage's libpng, so fix both issues when updating to R 2.7.

My draft of an updated R and rpy2 spkg is at 
http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jason/r-2.9.2.spkg.  There are 
unchecked-in changes in the spkg, and I just ignored a bunch of old 
patches to R because I wasn't sure they applied anymore, so the spkg is 
not finished.
