This patch changes `SL2Z` to be a distinct object, as opposed to a class. The following error was brought up on `sage-support`:

```
sage: S = SL2Z()([0,-1,1,0])
sage: T = SL2Z()([1,1,0,1])
sage: S*T
...
<type 'exceptions.RuntimeError'>: There is a bug in the coercion code in SAGE.
```

The issue (as the poster pointed out) is that the parents of S and T are distinct copies of `SL2Z`, when they don't need to be. Indeed, I don't see any difference between this and other distinct rings in Sage (such as `ZZ`, `QQ`, etc), so I've made it distinct.

Now the above becomes:

```
sage: S = SL2Z.([0,-1,1,0])
sage: T = SL2Z.([1,1,0,1])
sage: S*T
[ 0 -1]
[ 1  1]
```
