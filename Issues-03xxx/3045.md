This is actually the correct behaviour.  The function that returns a primitive element is K.multiplicative_generator(), not K.gen().  There was some inconsistency in the docstrings of the various types of finite fields, which is fixed by the attached patch.

Kiran, I tried to find some examples and couldn't.  I think the point of the warning in the docstring is that we are not guaranteeing that the finite fields code wouldn't change in the future in such a way that other generators would be returned; or, for that matter, that the same version of Sage running on wildly different architectures won't return different generators.  I modified the docstrings a bit to (hopefully) make that more clear.

Note that multiplicative_generator() calls pari's znprimroot(), so whatever fuzziness there is in pari's finding a generator gets automatically inherited by Sage.

Looks good to me.  I think the docstrings are clear enough.
