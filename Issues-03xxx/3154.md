I think using %r to handle escaping quotes would be cleaner than using intermediate base64. I'm attaching a new patch that does this.

The second patch causes two SageNB doctest failures:

```python

Does the latter reveal a [minor] problem with #7249?

I believe so. I'd rather that be put in a new ticket though.

The attached patch should solve the mentioned doctest problems. Can't see how they're related to #7249 though.
