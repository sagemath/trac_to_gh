As written, this does not work.  Was it the wrong version of the patch?

Here's a potential doctest, it fails because magma(K) does not work.

```
        We coerce a matrix over a cyclotomic field, where the
        generator must be named during the coercion.
            sage: K.<z> = CyclotomicField(12)
            sage: A = matrix(K, 2, 3, [z, 1+z, z^7 - z + 10/3, 1, 0, z^2 + z + 9*z^11])
            sage: B = magma(A); B                       # optional
            sage: B.Type()                              # optional
            ModMatFldElt
            sage: B.Parent()                            # optional
            Full KMatrixSpace of 2 by 3 matrices over XXX
```
