There are various issues at play here:

* configure from patches is from GMP 4.2.1
* the Core2 patches do not apply since Jason's script detects the version mismatch
* GMP 4.2.2 in general misdetects some very new Core2 Quads and Core2 Xeons as 32 bit Intel CPUs

Fix all those issues!

Cheers,

Michael
