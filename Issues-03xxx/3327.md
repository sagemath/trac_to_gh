The generic .divides() implementation doesn't work for FieldElement; this causes the following problem:

```
  R.<a,b> = NumberField(x^2-3,'g')[]
  S.<y> = R.fraction_field()[]
  xgcd(y^2, a*y+b) 
```
goes BOOM (as reported by GaÃ«tan Bisson here: http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support/browse_thread/thread/5338608bd7508b00/76dd56341dc29b1b#76dd56341dc29b1b)

The attached patch adds the missing method and some doctests.
