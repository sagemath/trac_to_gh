TO USE:
* 
http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/was/pynac/pynac-0.1.spkg

* Apply this bundle to sage-3.1.1:
http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/was/pynac/pynac.hg


The goal of this ticket:

1. Remove all dependency of ginac (http://www.ginac.de/) on CLN, so (a) Ginac builds in 2 minutes, (b) Ginac makes use of libraries like MPFR that are better than cln, and (c) in the future ginac will be able to work directly with *any* Sage objects. 

2. Create a symbolic arithmetic class that works like below in parallel with the existing sage symbolics, but is far from feature complete.

```
sage: var("x y",ns=1)
(x, y)
sage: type(x)
<type 'sage.symbolic.expression.Expression'>
sage: expand((x^3*tan(x*y^x) + sin(y) - cos(y))^2)
cos(y)^2-2*cos(y)*sin(y)-2*cos(y)*x^3*tan(y^x*x) + x^6*tan(y^x*x)^2 + sin(y)^2 + 2*x^3*sin(y)*tan(y^x*x)
sage: timeit('expand((x^3*tan(x*y^x) + sin(y) - cos(y))^2)')
625 loops, best of 3: 107 µs per loop


sage: var("x y")
(x, y)
sage: timeit('expand((x^3*tan(x*y^x) + sin(y) - cos(y))^2)')
5 loops, best of 3: 24.5 ms per loop
sage: 24.5/(107*(10^(-3)))
228.971962616822


sage: x = sympy.var('x'); y = sympy.var('y')
sage: timeit("((x^3r * sympy.tan(x*y^x) + sympy.sin(y) - sympy.cos(y))^2r).expand()")
625 loops, best of 3: 691 µs per loop
```


The above would go in *before* any of this replaces the existing symbolic framework.  

Once the above two steps are done and the spkg passes review, this ticket should be closed.  Only then should a more refined attack on the problem be carried out.

This is impressive! Great job.

The patches look good to me in general. Just a naive question -- why do you need to call PY_NEW here:

 	82	cdef Expression new_Expression_from_GEx(GEx juice): 
 	83	    cdef Expression nex 
 	84	    nex = <Expression>PY_NEW(Expression) 
 	85	    GEx_construct_ex(&nex._gobj, juice) 
 	86	    nex._parent = ring.NSR 
 	87	    return nex 


? Is it some defficiency in Cython?

Don't know if I am doing something wrong:

```
g++ -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I. -I.. -I/home/ondra/ext/sage/local/include/python2.5/ -g -O2 -MT add.lo -MD -MP -MF .deps/add.Tpo -c add.cpp  -fPIC -DPIC -DPIC -o add.o
In file included from expair.h:27,
                 from expairseq.h:32,
                 from add.h:26,
                 from add.cpp:28:
numeric.h:97: error: extra qualification 'GiNaC::Number_T::' on member 'Number_T'
make[2]: *** [add.lo] Error 1
```
I am using Sage 3.1.1. Changing this:

Number_T::~Number_T();

to this:

~Number_T();

in numeric.h fixes the problem for me. Using:

```
$ g++ --version
g++ (Debian 4.3.1-9) 4.3.1
Copyright (C) 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
This is free software; see the source for copying conditions.  There is NO
warranty; not even for MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
```

Unfortunately then it fails at:

```
g++ -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I. -I.. -I/home/ondra/ext/sage/local/include/python2.5/ -g -O2 -MT numeric.lo -MD -MP -MF .deps/numeric.Tpo -c numeric.cpp  -fPIC -DPIC -DPIC -o numeric.o

numeric.cpp:231: error: jump to case label
numeric.cpp:222: error:   crosses initialization of 'PyObject* o'
```

I don't have more time to investigate.

Attachment: **[pynac.2.hg.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket3872/pynac.2.hg.gz)**

[attachment: pynac.2.hg](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket3872/pynac.2.hg.gz) (and also pynac.2.2.hg, thanks to trac) has a clean version of William's bundle, plus two changesets (one trivial).

I give a positive review to William's patch, someone should review mine.

There is also a new package file here:

http://www.risc.jku.at/people/berocal/sage/pynac-0.1.spkg

The only difference is a new SPKG.txt and an environment check on top of spkg-install.

As the ticket description states, these should go in after my changes are reviewed. I'll open new tickets for further additions to the pynac interface.

Hi,

I read through Burcin's two patches to my patches, which he wrote when refereeing my code,
and I'm happy with them.

Mhansen, all mentioned to me that "he's read through all of this". 

I also tested building and running all this on the intel atom n270, and it works. 

So --- positive review!  Let's get this in sage.

After ghmm I want to do some wider build testing, especially on Linux Itanium, Solaris as well as Cygwin before merging this.

A couple remarks:

* pynac runs autoheader:

```
make  all-recursive
make[1]: Entering directory `/scratch/mabshoff/release-cycle/review/pynac-0.1/src'
Making all in ginac
```
* CPPFLAGS and potentially LDFLAGS need to be set so we pick up Sage's Python:

```
/bin/sh ../libtool    --mode=compile g++ -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I. -I.. 
-I/scratch/mabshoff/release-cycle/sage-3.1.2.rc5/local/include/python2.5/   
-I/scratch/mabshoff/release-cycle/sage-3.1.2.rc5/local/include/python2.5  
-g -O2 -MT ex.lo -MD -MP -MF .deps/ex.Tpo -c -o ex.lo ex.cpp
```
* spkg-install needs some cleanup, i.e. delete the PolyBoRi references, switch to #!/usr/bin/env bash, etc
* SPKG.txt should explain which patches/changes were made to make Ginac work with Python types/remove the CLN dependency. That patch should be somewhere in a repo since at some point we will rebase on upstream
* Ginac depends on dlopen, so this is a portability issue that needs to be taken into consideration and should be mentioned in SPKG.txt

Yes, the plan to do so is very soon, i.e. alpha0 today. But we need to have a review for #4243 and #4244 to catch up with the current state of the art here.
