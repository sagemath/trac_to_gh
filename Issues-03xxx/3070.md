```
Hello-
I input the following:

sage: s1 = SymmetricGroup(1)
sage: s = s1.cayley_graph()
sage: s.vertices()
[]

Shouldn't the set of vertices have one element in it for the
identity?  s1 reports this element, but as shown the graph does not.
I suppose this is trivial, but it seems like it should be fixed at
some point.  I am, however, still fairly new to SAGE, and could easily
be missing something.  Any thoughts on this? 
```

Cheers,

Michael

Conclusion:

The function `cayley_graph` was unnecessarily complicated.
