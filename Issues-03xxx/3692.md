Either this is a python bug, "user error", or a feature request.  I don't think this is a problem with the notebook.

The default behavior is to call repr on the return value of the last line (if not None), yes?  If so, this is consistent.  If not, what?  Should we call print instead of repr? (then, I believe it's a feature request)
