REVIEW:

1. It would be nice if you added a comment about what is going on in the modifications to twist.py.

2. I don't actually understand how to test that this patch is actually doing something!  Could you give me simple step-by-step instructions to test out a situation where the behavior of something is different whether or not remember me is checked?   Does this feature only do anything when there are multiple accounts?  I tried what I thought was the obvious test, and it seems like Remember Me just doesn't work.  We can figure this out at the cafe today.

Hi,

I was just using Sage on my computer with this patch applied and having a lot of problems if I open and close my browser.  I get into a state where I absolutely can't login, etc.

I.e., this patch is definitely not ready for prime time.  It will break the notebook for a lot of people in confusing ways. 

We'll get it fixed though.
