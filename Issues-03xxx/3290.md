From http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/errata.html#JITNaN:

```
Complex GEMM sometimes accesses C when BETA=0
This happens when K is much larger than M and N, and is caused by a bug in special-case GEMM code. To fix, edit ATLAS/src/blas/gemm/ATL_cmmJITcp.c, and change lines 267 and 268 from:

   else  /* two or more dim < NB, requires generated cleanup */
      NBmm0 = NBmm1 = NBmmX = Mjoin(PATLU,pKBmm);

to:

   else { NBmm0 = NBmm1 = NBmmX = Mjoin(PATLU,pKBmm);
          if (SCALAR_IS_ZERO(beta)) Mjoin(PATL,gezero)(M, N, C, ldc); }
```

Michael
