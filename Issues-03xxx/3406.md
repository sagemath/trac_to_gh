The updated patch fixes the doctest issue. Elliptic curves used an unknown term ordering and the old -- buggy! -- code fell back to 'lex' silently. Now it is 'lex' explicitly, please speak up if that is not what is wanted.

I think we will not need to use any GB code at all once I have finished.  That was used in code William wrote, which I am rewriting having decided that it was just too much to have three different versions of something (in this case, division polynomials for elliptic curves).

So I see no reason to block 3.0.4 -- unless I have misunderstood the point here!

John,

I am sure we do understand each other 100% in this case.
