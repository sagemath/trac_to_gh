I am seeing doctest failures:

I am seeing similar issues in #3407.

The updated patch fixes the doctest issue. Elliptic curves used an unknown term ordering and the old -- buggy! -- code fell back to 'lex' silently. Now it is 'lex' explicitly, please speak up if that is not what is wanted.

With the last new hunk doctests do pass. Since we are computing GBs in Lex anyway I am giving this a positive review again. 

John: Should you not intend to compute the GBs with Lex please open a blocker ticket against 3.0.4.

I think we will not need to use any GB code at all once I have finished.  That was used in code William wrote, which I am rewriting having decided that it was just too much to have three different versions of something (in this case, division polynomials for elliptic curves).

So I see no reason to block 3.0.4 -- unless I have misunderstood the point here!

John,

I am sure we do understand each other 100% in this case.
