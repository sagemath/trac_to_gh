I've found a way to somewhat reproducibly leave a matlab process eating 100% cpu time.

I log on to sage.math, start Sage, and run the following commands:

```
sage: m = matlab(matrix(RR, [[1]]))
sage: m.det()
```
Then I kill my local ssh client with "kill -9" (to make a non-clean ssh shutdown).

Often (not always, but I think more than half the time) this leaves a matlab process eating 100% of the cpu time.

Component: **interfaces: optional**
