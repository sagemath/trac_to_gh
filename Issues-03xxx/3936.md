It is impossible to have Python's universal comparison and have mathematically sound meaning to comparison. Transitivity and/or other properties have to cave at some point.

One example:

```
sage: L=[int(0),None,1,int(2),3]
sage: L.sort()
sage: L
[1, None, 0, 2, 3]
sage: L[0]<L[2]
False
```
Would it be at all feasible to throw exceptions on non-sensical comparisons, such as 1 > None ?
`**` instead of `^` seems pretty mild compared to this.

What about `1 == None` or `1 != None`, should those throw errors as well? (They use the same code).

I'm closing this as invalid.
