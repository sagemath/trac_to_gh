I might be wrong, but it looks like output isn't getting printed:

```
# From a pure GAP session:
GAP4, Version: 4.4.10 of 02-Oct-2007, i686-apple-darwin9.2.2-gcc
gap> g := Group((1,3,2),(2,4,3));
Group([ (1,3,2), (2,4,3) ])
gap> Stabilizer(g,4);
Group([ (1,3,2) ])
gap> 

# From a Sage session:
sage: %gap

  --> Switching to Gap <-- 

''
gap: g := Group((1,3,2),(2,4,3));

gap: Stabilizer(g,4);

gap:
