This is because they use the generic algorithms (extracting each element as a Python object).

Hi Robert,

Everything looks good except I got one little doctest failure:

```
File "/opt/sage/tmp/matrix_modn_dense.py", line 204:
    sage: matrix(GF(7), 2, 2, [-1, int(-2), GF(7)(-3), 1/4])
Expected:
    [6 2]
    [4 2]
Got:
    [6 0]
    [4 2]
```

Shouldn't int(-2) go to 5 instead of either 2 or 0?

That change to `mod_int` being unsigned bites again, and when I changed the doctest to test a negative int, coincidentally the output was the same (should have caught that nonetheless)--glad it was different for you. 

The patch has been updated.

Me too--no idea why that just changed, it used to work and I thought I only touched a couple of lines. Now I wish I had made a new patch instead of qrefresh. I'll look at this.

There was certainly a bug, but not in the code I touched so I don't know why it suddenly showed up now. I've fixed it, it should be working find again.
