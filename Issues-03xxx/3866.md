This is a *very* *extremely* rough-cut of a 2d locator widget.  All the docstrings are blatantly wrong and the code is full of ugly things.  But it works, sort of.  It's a starting point for someone to finish.

An example:

```
@interact
def _(pos=locator(3)):
    print pos
```

I am thinking of giving this to a student of mine for an independent study project.  To avoid duplication of effort I would appreciate being informed of any independent effort on it.
