This is a *very* *extremely* rough-cut of a 2d locator widget.  All the docstrings are blatantly wrong and the code is full of ugly things.  But it works, sort of.  It's a starting point for someone to finish.

An example:

```
@interact
def _(pos=locator(3)):
    print pos
```


Component: **interact**
