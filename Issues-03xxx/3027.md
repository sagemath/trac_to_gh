I ran lintian (the Debian packaging error checking tool) on all my packages, and found a bunch of bugs.  I guess the Debian build system is too automated for me to notice these normally.  I've attached a bunch of patches to fix many of these bugs (some others I reported upstream).

**Assignee:** @timabbott

**Resolution:** fixed
