Hi,

The following is a bug that Bill Page found in Sage.  It is in the combinatorial
classes code  (mostly) by Mike Hansen, so maybe he'll fix it. 

```
In: http://modular.math.washington.edu/msri06/work/kohel/msri_magma.pdf

 "A Brief Magma Tutorial" by David R. Kohel gives this example:

----------

The parent structure of a tuple is more important than in the case
of sequences or sets.
> C := CartesianProduct(Integers(),RationalField());
> t := C!<1,1>;
> Parent(t[2]);
Rational Field

----------

The analogous computation in Sage 3.0.2 yields:

sage: C = CartesianProduct(Integers(),RationalField())

# case 1
sage: t=C([1,1/2])
sage: parent(t[0])
Integer Ring
sage: parent(t[1])
Rational Field

# case 2
sage: t=C([1,1])
sage: parent(t[0])
Integer Ring
sage: parent(t[1])
Integer Ring

---------

Notice that the parent of t[1] is incorrect in the 2nd case.
```

This was never the intended functionality of CartesianProduct -- it is different than the CartesianProduct of Magma.  It was mainly intended to iterator over the cartesian product of a bunch of iterables in Python.  Maybe the name should be changed.
