When I click on Help in the Notebook, the help text for "**DATA** variable" reads:

The variable **DATA** contains the directory with data files that you upload into the worksheet. For example, to open a file in that directory, do "open(***DIR***+'filename')".

The example should use DATA.

This applies to 
sage0_version()
SAGE Version 3.0, Release Date: 2008-04-23

With best regards,

Lars Fischer
