The following command

```
sage: N=8
sage: N.log(2)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
AttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)

/home/ljpk/<ipython console> in <module>()

AttributeError: 'sage.rings.integer.Integer' object has no attribute 'log'
```

returns an error (as does N.exp()). Would it be possible to add a function to the Sage integers class which worked like the ones for the real numbers?

```
sage: N=8.0
sage: N.log(2)
3.00000000000000
sage: N.exp()
2980.95798704173

Somebody should point out the exact_log function in this discussion since it is relevant to the original poster and is superfast:

```
sage: N = 8

Mike, Good point about log(3).  This should be dealt with the same way as with sqrt:

```
sage: 3.sqrt()
sqrt(3)
sage: 3.sqrt(prec=53)
