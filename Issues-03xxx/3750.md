The following command

```
sage: N=8
sage: N.log(2)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
AttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)

/home/ljpk/<ipython console> in <module>()

AttributeError: 'sage.rings.integer.Integer' object has no attribute 'log'
```

returns an error (as does N.exp()). Would it be possible to add a function to the Sage integers class which worked like the ones for the real numbers?

```
sage: N=8.0
sage: N.log(2)
3.00000000000000
sage: N.exp()

I think that log should default to base 'e' as it does with all the other types.  Also both of them should probably take an optional number of bits of precision to use with the default being 53.

Somebody should point out the exact_log function in this discussion since it is relevant to the original poster and is superfast:

```
sage: N = 8

sage: 3.sqrt()
sqrt(3)
sage: 3.sqrt(prec=53)
