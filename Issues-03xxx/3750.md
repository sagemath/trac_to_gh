sage: N=8
sage: N.log(2)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
AttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)

AttributeError: 'sage.rings.integer.Integer' object has no attribute 'log'
```

returns an error (as does N.exp()). Would it be possible to add a function to the Sage integers class which worked like the ones for the real numbers?

```
sage: N=8.0
sage: N.log(2)
3.00000000000000
sage: N.exp()

I think that log should default to base 'e' as it does with all the other types.  Also both of them should probably take an optional number of bits of precision to use with the default being 53.

Know what, I don't think I even realized that m was mandatory the way I wrote it - yes, obviously it should default to natural log.  I like the idea of specifying precision in the function itself as well - good comments.

Mike, Good point about log(3).  This should be dealt with the same way as with sqrt:

sage: 3.sqrt()
sqrt(3)
sage: 3.sqrt(prec=53)

sage: log(1024, 2)
log(1024)/log(2)
