The following command

```
sage: N=8
sage: N.log(2)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
AttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)

/home/ljpk/<ipython console> in <module>()

AttributeError: 'sage.rings.integer.Integer' object has no attribute 'log'
```

returns an error (as does N.exp()). Would it be possible to add a function to the Sage integers class which worked like the ones for the real numbers?

```
sage: N=8.0
sage: N.log(2)
3.00000000000000
sage: N.exp()
2980.95798704173
```


Component: **basic arithmetic**

Know what, I don't think I even realized that m was mandatory the way I wrote it - yes, obviously it should default to natural log.  I like the idea of specifying precision in the function itself as well - good comments.

Mike, Good point about log(3).  This should be dealt with the same way as with sqrt:

```
sage: 3.sqrt()
sqrt(3)
sage: 3.sqrt(prec=53)
1.73205080756888

As long as everyone is okay with 

```
sage: log(1024, 2)
10
```
instead of the previous behavior of 

```
sage: log(1024, 2)
log(1024)/log(2)
```
then the last version of the patch should address all concerns raised above.  Thanks to mhampton for sleuthing down that one must use ** for exponentiation outside the interpreter when I got confused.
