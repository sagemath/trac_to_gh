[12:51pm] rlm: sound familiar? i'm valgrinding, and this
seems to be many of 13,030 loss records...
[12:51pm] mabshoff: Yes.
[12:51pm] mabshoff: It is Cython dictionaries and I plan
to suppress them in the future.
...
[12:52pm] mabshoff: Can you make a ticket for it? I also
want to upgrade the optional valgrind.spkg to 3.3.1 and
also change some of the default options, i.e. no more
