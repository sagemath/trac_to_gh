I disabled dsage/testdoc.py for sage-3.0.5, since that system for doctesting dsage is BROKEN.
For example

```
sage -t  devel/sage/sage/dsage/tests/testdoc.py
********************************************************************
File "/home/was/build/sage-3.0.4/tmp/testdoc.py", line 14:
   sage: a
Expected:
   5
Got:
   No output.
```
and this is just a typical timing issue.  We have unit tests after all.

This seems to work correctly with #4745 applied, so after discussion with mabshoff perhaps we should reenable the doctest after #4745 to see if we can get it to fail again.
