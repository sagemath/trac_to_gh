Francois reports:

```
Just reviewing what options linbox is compiled with for sage,
well I was really looking at whether optimizations are enabled.
In theory they are, except on Sun:
if [ $UNAME = "SunOS" ]; then
   OPT="--enable-optimization=false"
   echo "Building on SunOS"
else
   OPT="--enable-optimization"
fi

Of course in practice they aren't because "$OPS" and not
"$OPT" is passed to the configuration. I must admit I didn't
check if it was corrected in 3.0.1.alpha0 but if so I missed
it in michael's log.

The spkg at 

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mabshoff/release-cycles-3.0.1/alpha1/linbox-1.1.5.p4.spkg

contains the fix in form of the above patch. It builds fine for me on sage.math and bsd.

Cheers,
