Oddly, the `plot` function has no difficulty, so *some* part of Sage can numerically evaluate the function:

```
plot(x^2.7 * e^(-2.4*x), x, 0, 3)
```
works fine.

Some values for the exponents do work -- it seems like the exponent of `x` needs to be an integer or half-integer:

```
(2.7, -2.4): this is the above example
(27/10, -2.4): same error as above
(1.5, -2.4): works
(1.6, -2.4): same error as above
(1.6, -2.0): same error as above
(1.0, -2.4): works
(5.5, -2.4): works
```

The essential problem is that with half-integer or integer exponents of x, Maxima can symbolically integrate this using Erf.

My view is that the correct fix is to put some kind of check in for when "integrate" is part of the output string fed into .n() and in that case at least attempt to use numerical_integral or something.  Of course that has the problem that things like 

```
sage: integrate(1/(1+x^7))
1/7*log(x + 1) - 1/7*integrate((x^5 - 2*x^4 + 3*x^3 - 4*x^2 + 5*x - 6)/(x^6 - x^5 + x^4 - x^3 + x^2 - x + 1), x)
```
Maxima is able to partly symbolically integrate, leaving

```
sage: integrate(1/(1+x^7),x,0,1)
```
in trouble.  But at least a check for "integrate" at the beginning could help.

Oh, totally, and of course we have numerical_integrate and nintegral (one is Maxima, one is GSL I think).  So I guess what I'm saying is that when someone has time (which won't be me until June due to the (US) holiday and then a conference) it should be relatively straightforward to at least do something in the generic code for .n() on whatever kind of object (symbolic?) an expression like integrate(f(x),x,a,b) is like

```
try:
    usual code
except TypeError:
    if "integrate" is in the string:
        either reraise the TypeError with a message suggesting the use of numerical_integrate
        or actually try to string-magic replace "integrate" with "numerical_integrate", which should be possible (you'd have to take [0] of that result, of course)
    else:
        do whatever used to happen with a TypeError
```
I think that it is reasonable for a user to expect that .n() numerically evaluates an expression as best as possible, even one Maxima can't evaluate!  And all these methods are much more sophisticated than Simpson, certainly, so that's not the issue.

Actually, the solution is much cleaner since .n() will call the `_evalf_` method on the integrate function which we can just have resort to a numerical integral if it is definite and has no free variables.

I'll look into this later.

Update: in 4.3.alpha1 with Maxima 5.20.1, we now get

```
sage: integrate(x^2.7 * e^(-2.4*x), x, 0, 3)
119/6144*2^(3/5)*3^(3/10)*5^(7/10)*gamma(7/10) - 125/20736*2^(3/5)*3^(3/10)*5^(7/10)*gamma_incomplete(37/10, 36/5)
```
But it won't evaluate the gamma_incomplete, since for some reason we aren't translating it to gamma_inc or incomplete_gamma, which are the supported functions; however, otherwise it is correct (as comparing with results of numerical_integral).

This does not fix the problem, of course, but I will change the summary to get at the fundamental thing mhansen and I discussed, and open a separate ticket (if it doesn't exist) for the gamma_incomplete not being translated correctly from Maxima.  That is #7748.

Do we in the meantime have the `_evalf_` method on a symbolic integral that can be changed?

#6465 has a patch with such an `_evalf_` method. It needs a rebase though. I'm still playing with the symbolic functions in pynac. If nobody gets to it, I'll update those patches after I'm done with pynac.

Uh oh...that patch doesn't apply. On top of vanilla 4.3.5, it fails in calculus.py and random_tests.py. I tried to fix the failing hunk in calculus.py (and ignored random_tests.py, since that seemed like a harmless change), but with that applied, it still fails for me.

I tried applying the patches from #7748 on top of the #7661 patch, but Sage doesn't even properly start:

```
/scratch/sage-4.3.5/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sage/functions/other.py in <module>()
    540 # We have to add the wrapper function manually to the symbol_table when we have

    541 # two functions with different number of arguments and the same name

--> 542 symbol_table['functions']['gamma'] = gamma
    543 
    544 class Function_gamma_inc(BuiltinFunction):

NameError: name 'gamma' is not defined
Error importing ipy_profile_sage - perhaps you should run %upgrade?
WARNING: Loading of ipy_profile_sage failed.
```

Any ideas?
