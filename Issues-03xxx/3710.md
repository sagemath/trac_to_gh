Segfault confirmed on 32 bit linux with GCC 4.3.1 and GCC 4.2.4, versions prior to GCC 4.2.3 including should work, status of version 4.3.0 is still not known, also status of 64 bit builds is not known. This bug is bug in gcc or bug in Tachyon that showed up after some changes to GCC somewhere in between 2008-02-01 and 2008-05-19. Status of 64 bit version is unknown because I have no access to hardware with those compile versions.

When 32 bit threaded version of Tachyon is built using "make linux-thr" and used to render attached scene, it segfaults around 59%. Non threaded version works (one built with "make linux"), threaded version works when -fno-crossjumping -fno-reorder-blocks compilation flags are added.

Still working to get smaller test case and informations on gcc 4.3.0, there will hopefully be patch/spkg soon.

This ticket is follow-up of report from "Sage 3.0.6.alpha0 released" sage-devel thread.

btw, as this is segfault fix only I guess it could go to 3.1 so I reassign it to 3.1 as I don't know if before release tickets ready to review from next milestone are searched for... are there reasons for it to not make in for 3.1?

cheers,
Andrzej.

Hi Andrzej,

a couple remarks:

* You deleted the hg history of the spkg - that is not good :)
* Instead of the construct using "gcc -v ..." it is much easier to use "gcc -dumpversion". I did that in the updated spkg.
* Please do not attach spkgs to tickets. Put them up somewhere and post a link.

I am giving the spkg with the changes I made a positive review.

Cheers,

Michael
