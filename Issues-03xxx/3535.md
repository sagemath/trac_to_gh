Yes, but I don't think a new worksheet with tutorial stuff in it is the solution.   This has been discussed a lot before, and we decided to put an "evaluate" button in for such users, which helps a lot.  Once people get familiar with sage, they click "help" in the upper right, and then they quickly learn about shift-enter.
