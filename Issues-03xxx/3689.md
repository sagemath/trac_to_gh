Oops, tried to update the wrong patch.  You just want the examples-shebang.patch.
Along with applying that patch, one should run

```
rmdir misc
```
from the root of the examples spkg.  The /usr/bin/env/sage issues have already been fixed.

I applied the patch and ran the rmdir command as suggested above.

Note: I applied #3686, #3687, #3688 and #3689 at the same time as my machine is a bit slow (8800 s to run all tests). I changed the packages, did a full build from source and ran 'make testlong'. Everything built and all tests passed. This is with Sage-4.1.
