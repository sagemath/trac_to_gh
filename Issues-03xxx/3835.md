It would be nice to be able to construct the algebraic closure of an object.  For example, QQ.algebraic_closure() should return QQbar.

Attachment: **[trac_3835-algebraic_closure.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket3835/trac_3835-algebraic_closure.patch.gz)**

The attached patch implements this in the trivial cases now possible:  for a number field (including QQ) return QQbar;  for RR return CC, with the same precision (this was already implemented);  for CC, return the same field;  for finite fields, raise NotImplementedError; else raise NotImplementedError.

I'm not sure if this is what Jason intended, but it would be a major undertaking to implement this in any other cases (finite fields, p-adic fields, function fields. ...)
