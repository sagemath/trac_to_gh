It would be great to have a Trac report that listed all the tickets in which the logged in user has participated (i.e., created, commented on, in the CC list, in the editor list, etc.)  I think this basically would be a report of all tickets that could possibly email you updates.

For me, it would serve as a "Tickets that I should follow up on" report :)
