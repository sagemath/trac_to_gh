This may be premature (and if it is, feel free to ignore/dispose of this ticket), but when I tried to build the reference manual in 3.1alpha, there were a bunch of small errors -- things like `"""` instead of `r"""`, immediately followed by a docstring using backslashes.  This patch fixes these.



**Keywords:** documentation, reference
