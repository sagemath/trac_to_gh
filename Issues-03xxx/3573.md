opentick is a collection of APIs for obtaining free real-time and historical market data for trading systems and trading platforms. With these APIs, we will enable Sage to be able to stream and manipulate real-time market data.

This ticket depends on #3621.

Hi, 

please do not attach binaries to trac tickets since those will be backup up daily until the end of time :). I have deleted both the library and the headers.

Instead link them from the safe place, i.e. you sage.math account. In general your approach is completely wrong. What you need to do is to build an optinal OpenTick.spkg.

Cheers,

Michael
