Hi, 

please do not attach binaries to trac tickets since those will be backup up daily until the end of time :). I have deleted both the library and the headers.

Instead link them from the safe place, i.e. you sage.math account. In general your approach is completely wrong. What you need to do is to build an optinal OpenTick.spkg.

Cheers,

Michael
