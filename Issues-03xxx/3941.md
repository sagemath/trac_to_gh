In MMA, you can thread the derivative over lists of variables and functions to compute the Jacobian.  Here's a routine that wraps the sage diff function to do it.  

```
def diff(f,*args):
    if isinstance(f, (list, tuple)):
        return [diff(component,*args) for component in f]
    else:
        if isinstance(args[0], (list, tuple)):
            return [diff(f,variable) for variable in args[0]]
        else:
            return sage.all.diff(f,*args)
```

and the results:

```
sage: var('a,b,c,d,x,y')
sage: diff((a*x+b*y,c*x+d*y),(x,y))
[[a, b], [c, d]]
```

well, so the result is not really a matrix, but rather a nested list that could be indexed like a matrix or turned into a matrix in the above case.


We could write the above even more simply if we had an outer product operator: 

outer_product(diff,f,vars), where f and vars were lists.

What about functions with codomain R<sup>n</sup> where n>1?  If these are represented via a list, tuple, or vector, the code works from above (well, let's add handling of vectors with the following:

```
def diff(f, *args):
    if isinstance(f, (list, tuple)) or sage.structure.element.is_Vector(f):
        return [diff(component, *args) for component in f]
    else:
        if isinstance(args[0], (list, tuple)) or is_Vector(args[0]):
            return [diff(f, variable) for variable in args[0]]
        else:
            return sage.all.diff(f, *args)
```

This wouldn't work with a `.jacobian` method---where would we put the method?

#5253 makes this less needed, but I still think it would be nice to have good syntax for this sort of thing using the diff function.

Does the new functionality that

```
f(x,y)=3*sin(x)-2*cos(y)-x*y
f.diff(2)
```
works change anything on this ticket?  Just throwing it out there, it may be irrelevant.
