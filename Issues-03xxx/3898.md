The above spkg will fail in case the Sage build directory is on another mount than the tmp dir since the symbolic link across mounts will fail. That is the reason that it failed on SkyNet with the same error across the board.

I am working on gcc-4.3.1.p1.spkg.

23:32 < wstein-682> there's no gcc-4.3.2 spkg, so why did you write "neeeds review"?
23:32 < wstein-682> can I change 3898 to "needs work"?
23:32 < mabshoff> It need to update.
23:32 < mabshoff> Yes
23:32 < wstein-682> since it's not done as stated inthe summary?
23:33 < mabshoff> I need to do two things:
23:33 < mabshoff> (a) update to gcc 4.3.2 (quick)
23:33 < mabshoff> (b) create custom toolchain.sh scripts for x86, x86-64 and Itanium.
23:33 < mabshoff> Next time I build on SkyNet I will do so.
23:34 < mabshoff> And definitely before SD 12 due to obvious reasons :)
