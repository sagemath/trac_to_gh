23:32 < wstein-682> can I change 3898 to "needs work"?
23:32 < mabshoff> It need to update.
23:32 < mabshoff> Yes
23:32 < wstein-682> since it's not done as stated inthe summary?
23:33 < mabshoff> I need to do two things:
23:33 < mabshoff> (a) update to gcc 4.3.2 (quick)
23:33 < mabshoff> (b) create custom toolchain.sh scripts for x86, x86-64 and Itanium.
