When scrolling through the notebook with the cursor keys (i.e., moving from cell to cell), if you move to a cell below the currently visible ones, the browser automatically scrolls down to let you see the new cell, but the jsmath box is sitting right there at the start of the cell, so you can't see what is in the start of the cell.

Fix 1: scroll a bit more than we do now

Fix 2: move the jsmath box to the bottom right instead of the bottom left

Fix 3: Get rid of the jsmath box and instead just make a menu option or some other way to access the jsmath controls.  Once the jsmath controls are set, they are very rarely accessed, at least for me.
