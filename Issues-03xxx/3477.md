The following code from the clisp spkg-install is confusing:

```
    echo "If you already have clisp, you can type touch spkg/installed/clisp-2.38"
    echo "(or whatever the current version is) from SAGE_ROOT, and continue the"
    echo "install.  This tells SAGE that you already have clisp-2.38 installed."
```
It should either use the current version, or not give a version at all.
