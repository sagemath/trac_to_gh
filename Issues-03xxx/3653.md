I have tried to generate some random complex numbers today and discovered that random_element behaves somewhat unexpected - without arguments it returns integer values between -2 and 2, with an optional argument n - integers between -n and n. That is exactly what is described in the documentation, but I would expect it to be a random complex number from the square [-1,1]x[-1,1] or unit disk and with an argument - a random value from the square or the disk of given size.

Component: **basic arithmetic**
