Currently, rescale_row and rescale_col don't allow you to rescale by something mathematically right but outside the current matrix base ring.  Discussion from sage-devel follows.

Yep, this is orthogonal.  You're just suggesting that scale_row 
be improved.

The Sequence constructor is the canonical answer to this question. 
Given any list v of Sage object it will find a canonical place to put 
them all: 

```
sage: v = [3, I/2] 
sage: w = Sequence(v) 
sage: w 
[3, I/2] 
sage: w.universe() 
Symbolic Ring 
```

Component: **linear algebra**

The patch 8869 replaces patch 8867.  

It allows multiplication of rows/columns of matrices by elements of extensions of the base rings, at the cost of (only in those cases) returning a copy, not changing the original.  

This also adds extra examples and documentation, as well as a set_col_to_multiple_of_col attribute to match set_row_to_multiple_of_row .

- Do not just print out an error message, actually raise a TypeError (with an explanatory error message, though preferably without line breaks at 58 characters).
