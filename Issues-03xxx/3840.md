REVIEW:

This should be redone by changing the == to <= like this.  This is much nicer than using an if statement like in the patch.  Redo it.

Apply only `3840-gfurnish-multivariate-conversion-from-0.patch`; hopefully the credit in hg remains with gfurnish.  Let me know if not; I used the hg export command this time.

I think this patch does what the referee wants and strikes a better doctesting balance.

Whether -1 is correct or -Infinity is correct, this at least makes sage internally more consistent.
