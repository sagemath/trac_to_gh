I suppose this didn't get caught by doctests because nauty is an optional package. Is it possible to have doctests that actually get run?

Also, in installing the optional nauty spkg, I notice that there is an interactive do-you-accept-this-license step. This doesn't seem right at all... Mabshoff, thoughts?

Re the license: This is on purpose since it isn't GPL compatible and I think it is fine. It has been proposed to create a non-free repo and then stick all non-GPL compatible spkgs in there.

Cheers,
