Example:

```
sage: CDB=CremonaDatabase()    
sage: [[EllipticCurve(ai[0]).label() for ai in C] for C in CDB.isogeny_classes(1728)]

[['1728a1', '1728a2', '1728a3', '1728a4'],
 ['1728b1'],
 ['1728ba1'],
 ['1728bb1', '1728bb2', '1728bb3'],
 ['1728c1'],
 ['1728d1'],
 ['1728e1', '1728e2', '1728e3'],
 ['1728f1', '1728f2'],
 ['1728g1'],
 ['1728h1'],
 ['1728i1'],
 ['1728j1', '1728j2', '1728j3'],
 ['1728k1'],
 ['1728l1'],
 ['1728m1', '1728m2'],
 ['1728n1'],
 ['1728o1'],
 ['1728p1'],
 ['1728q1'],
 ['1728r1'],
 ['1728s1', '1728s2', '1728s3'],
 ['1728t1'],
 ['1728u1'],
 ['1728v1', '1728v2', '1728v3', '1728v4'],
 ['1728w1'],
 ['1728x1'],
 ['1728y1'],
 ['1728z1']]
```

The keys are strings like '1728a1',...,'1728z1','1728ba1',... and these a wrongly sorted by the standard sort function.  What this means is that when iterating through the database, the isogeny classes are not listed in the standard order a,b,...,z,ba,bb,...,bz,...

In the above example, classes ba and bb should come after class z, and not between classes b and c.

Attachment: **[sage-trac3869.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket3869/sage-trac3869.patch.gz)**

The attached patch fixes this by defining a new cmp function for curve codes which gets it right.

This should apply to 3.1.

I have doctested the new functions, and also checked that ell_rational_field doctests ok.

Looks good to me.

I added one more doctest; both patches should be applied.
