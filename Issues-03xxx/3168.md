If you take a simple Cython extension module and install it in into SAGE via

```
sage -python setup.py install
```
source introspection will not work.   

This appears to caused by two things

1) cython is invoked without the "-p" option

2) the relevant *pyx files are not put somewhere that the Sage interpreter can find them.

Attached is a minimal Cython module illustrating the problem.   Source introspection can be made to work via

```
sage -cython -p introtest.pyx
sage -python setup.py install
cp introtest.pyx $SAGEROOT/devel/sage/
