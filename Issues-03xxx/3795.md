I think mhansen's patch is excellent, but it broke if applied after #3568.  My updated patch depends on #3568 and makes the "get a test notebook" interface uniform using #3568.

All credit to mhansen.

Attach only `3795-mhansen-doctest-cell.patch`, *after* #3568.

Merged trac_3795.patch in Sage 3.1.alpha1. Sorry Nick, due to #3568 causing massive doctest failures William will redo it for 3.1.alpha2. Hopefully someone will take your patch and rebase it on the new release.

Cheers,

Michael
