A slightly updated spkg is at

http://www.warwick.ac.uk/staff/J.E.Cremona/eclib-20080310.p5.spkg

According to John:

```
There's a new version with that file deleted (and the mercurial logs
up to date) in the same place as before, called eclib-20080310.p5.spkg

John
```

John is talking about src/procs/ressol.c which is copyrighted by "Copyright (c) 1994, 1995 by the LiDIA Group". LiDIA is now GPL, but since the file is no longer used it was completely deleted.

Cheers,

Michael
