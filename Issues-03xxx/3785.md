<div id="comment:4" align="right">Comment 4</div>

The spkg at

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mabshoff/spkgs/atlas-3.8.2.spkg

fixes the following problems:

* update to 3.8.2
* better detection of Pentium D and E
* detect more Core2Duos cores
* properly detect Dunnington cores

In addition the spkg has been cleaned up. Build time:

* on the new sage.math down from 180 minutes to 

```
real	11m36.903s
user	9m58.840s
sys	1m17.870s
```
* On cleo/iras, i.e. Itanium2 machines on SkyNet:

```
real	37m34.354s
user	34m18.232s
sys	1m20.748s
```

This also fixes #3787

Cheers,

Michael
