%latex calls dvipng if it is available.  Its arguments include '-q*', and my shell tries to expand the *, thus causing %latex to bomb whenever I use it.  In fact, the argument should just be '-q'.  (See the dvipng man page: at one point it says

```
-q* Run quietly.  Don't chatter about pages converted, etc. to standard output;
    report no warnings (only errors) to standard error.
```
But earlier it says

```
Many of the parameterless options listed here can be turned off by suffixing the
option with a zero (0); for instance, to turn off page reversal, use -r0.  Such
options are marked with a trailing *.
```
So the * is not actually part of the argument.)

Keywords: **%latex, dvipng**
