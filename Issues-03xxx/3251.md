I don't know of any way to fix this at present.   It was in Alex Clemesha's
original implementation of plotting, and he never fixed it.  Somebody will
likely have to spend some time understanding why Sage's "plotting using
matplotlib" organizers overlaps in such a weird way and fix it.  If anybody
already has, please speak up.
