Hi,

Is this a bug or am I doing something stupid? I get different
precisions the first and second time I run the same command.

This is definitely a bug.  The output precision should be as given by the prec option.  The bug is caused by a mistake in the caching code, surely.   This will likely be easy to fix.

There's still something strange going on which I'm going to have to wait until 3.1.2.rc0 since I've messed up my 3.1.2.alpha4 (ok, so I could rebuild it and apply all those patches...):

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve('37a')                     
sage: E.period_lattice().basis(prec=30)[0].parent()
Real Field with 896 bits of precision
sage: E.period_lattice().basis(prec=100)[0].parent()
Real Field with 3136 bits of precision
```
I discovered this after seeing that #1903 was a duplicate.

If mabshoff could run the above code with the latest rc0 build then we'd know if there was something needing to fix or not.
