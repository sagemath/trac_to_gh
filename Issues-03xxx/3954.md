Hi,

Is this a bug or am I doing something stupid? I get different
precisions the first and second time I run the same command.

This is definitely a bug.  The output precision should be as given by the prec option.  The bug is caused by a mistake in the caching code, surely.   This will likely be easy to fix.

There's still something strange going on which I'm going to have to wait until 3.1.2.rc0 since I've messed up my 3.1.2.alpha4 (ok, so I could rebuild it and apply all those patches...):

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve('37a')                     
sage: E.period_lattice().basis(prec=30)[0].parent()
Real Field with 896 bits of precision
sage: E.period_lattice().basis(prec=100)[0].parent()
Real Field with 3136 bits of precision
```
I discovered this after seeing that #1903 was a duplicate.

If mabshoff could run the above code with the latest rc0 build then we'd know if there was something needing to fix or not.

This weird behavior was there before the patch as well.  Now, after the patch, it is weird but consistent :)

There's definitely a problem in communicating with pari regarding precision.  Part of it is that pari rounds up to the next word, so it often gives you a bit more precision than you asked for.  But there's more going on than just that, probably somewhere in the interface code.

Strictly speaking, this ticket was about consistency of the period_lattice functions.  The issue that John found seems to be orthogonal to this, so I'm opening a new ticket for it: #4064.
