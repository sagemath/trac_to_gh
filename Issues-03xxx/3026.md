The following output from sage does not make too much sense.

```
sage: PolynomialRing(QQ, names=[])
Multivariate Polynomial Ring in  over Rational Field
```
wstein suggested that it might print something like the following.

```
Multivariate Polynomial Ring in no variables over Rational Field
```

Component: **commutative algebra**
