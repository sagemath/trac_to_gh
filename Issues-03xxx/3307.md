I've attached a patch that moves genus2reduction to /usr/lib in my Debian package because it's not a program you run directly and doesn't have a man page.  The patch also fixes all the other minor issues with the package I'm aware of.

Patch looks good to me. I have slipped it into

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mabshoff/release-cycles-3.0.3/alpha0/genus2reduction-0.3.p3.spkg

without incrementing the patch level to avoid rebuilds.

Cheers,

Michael
