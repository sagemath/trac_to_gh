There are several issues with the `Cusp.__init__` method. Here's an example:

```
sage: Cusp(1/3,0)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

--> 196             a = a/b
    197             self.__a = a.numer()

ZeroDivisionError: Rational division by zero
```

This is relevant, since some computations with modular symbols on `GammaH` can lead to exactly this problem. 

The attached patch rewrites the `__init__` method, slightly improving the speed, and vastly improving the consistency. In particular, it was possible to construct two different cusps which both claimed to be `Infinity` (namely `(1,0)` and `(-1,0)`). 

In the process of doing this, I exposed several bits of code that were taking advantage of this "loophole," which then needed to be fixed. In an attempt to make things more clear, I ended up doctesting all of `sage/modular/modsym/boundary.py`, so that's also included.
