I think you asked this question backwards.  Anyway, the problem
is that nobody implemented __oct__ for Sage integers, but they
did implement __hex__.  Note that oct(...) calls __oct__:

sage: a = 2345
sage: a.__hex__()
'929'
sage: a.__oct__()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
<type 'exceptions.AttributeError'>        Traceback (most recent call last)

/Users/was/<ipython console> in <module>()

<type 'exceptions.AttributeError'>: 'sage.rings.integer.Integer' object has no attribute '__oct__'

In the meantime you can do either

sage: oct(int(a))
'04451'

or

sage: a.digits(8)
[1, 5, 4, 4]

or

sage: a.str(base=8)
'4451'
```
