It goes via pari calls, rather than invoking ntl directly. 

e.g., computing the minpoly of a random element in GF(2^300)
takes about  a minute in sage and a second in Magma.  It's slow
because PARI is really really slow.  Just getting the matrix and
asking for its charpoly is vastly vaster in sage already, so doing
that would be a good first step.

<div id="comment:6" align="right">comment:6</div>

Here is an example that illustrates the difference:

```
sage: k.<a> = GF(2^100)
sage: time g = k.random_element().charpoly()
CPU times: user 1.17 s, sys: 0.02 s, total: 1.18 s
Wall time: 1.36 s
sage: magma.eval('time f := CharacteristicPolynomial(Random(GF(2^100)));')
'Time: 0.000'
```

Here's the sage code that does the charpoly computation:

```
sage: a.charpoly??
        from sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_ring_constructor import PolynomialRing
        R = PolynomialRing(self.parent().prime_subfield(), var)
        return R(self._pari_().charpoly('x').lift())
```

It turns out that pari is just totally abysmal at computing charpolys of Mod's.

```
sage: f = k.random_element()._pari_()
sage: time g = f.charpoly('x')
CPU times: user 1.13 s, sys: 0.01 s, total: 1.14 s
Wall time: 1.26 s
sage: f.type()
't_POLMOD'
```

Fortunately Sage matrices aren't quite as bad, though of course this is still vastly
slower than Magma:

```
sage: time g = k.random_element().matrix().charpoly()
CPU times: user 0.36 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.36 s
Wall time: 0.37 s

```

Asymptotically though this is still vastly better than the current situation:

```
age: k.<a> = GF(2^200)
sage: time g = k.random_element().matrix().charpoly()
CPU times: user 2.21 s, sys: 0.03 s, total: 2.24 s
Wall time: 2.24 s
sage: time g = k.random_element().charpoly()
CPU times: user 14.14 s, sys: 0.08 s, total: 14.22 s
Wall time: 14.27 s
```

But still this sucks compared to magma

```
sage: magma.eval('time f := CharacteristicPolynomial(Random(GF(2^200)));')
'Time: 0.000'
sage: magma.eval('time f := CharacteristicPolynomial(Random(GF(2^200)));')
'Time: 0.000'
sage: magma.eval('time f := CharacteristicPolynomial(Random(GF(2^300)));')
'Time: 0.000'
sage: magma.eval('time f := CharacteristicPolynomial(Random(GF(2^400)));')
'Time: 0.010'
sage: magma.eval('time f := CharacteristicPolynomial(Random(GF(2^600)));')
'Time: 0.010'
sage: magma.eval('time f := CharacteristicPolynomial(Random(GF(2^1000)));')
'Time: 0.030'
```

I looked at NTL seems to have no functions at all for charpoly or minpoly
of elements of GF(2^n).  :-(

Robert,

I see no reason to reason to reopen this ticket since what you describe seems to be an improvement/additional change. Please open another ticket since the attached patch has been merged in Sage 3.0.4.

Cheers,

Michael
