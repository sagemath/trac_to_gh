1) Put there the attached sympy-0.6.0.spkg. 

2) Then apply the attached patch to Sage and rebuild Sage with "sage -b"

3) make sure the test_sympy.py test works, this should be the outcome:


```
$ ./sage -t devel/sage/sage/calculus/test_sympy.py
sage -t  3.0.3-debian-opteron64-x86_64-Linux/devel/sage/sage/calculus/test_sympy.py
 [5.2 s]
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
Total time for all tests: 5.2 seconds
```

4) make sure all tests work. The result of:

$ ./sage -tp 6 devel/sage/sage &> test.log

is attached.

Test log:

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/ondrej/ext/sage/test.log

as you can see, there is one test failing, but I think it is not related. Should I check if all tests run without the patch for me?

The test failure seems to be another rpy is moved and hence broken failure. This ought to be put on its own ticket and fixed.
