```
$ ./sage -t devel/sage/sage/calculus/test_sympy.py
sage -t  3.0.3-debian-opteron64-x86_64-Linux/devel/sage/sage/calculus/test_sympy.py
 [5.2 s]
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
Total time for all tests: 5.2 seconds
```

4) make sure all tests work. The result of:

$ ./sage -tp 6 devel/sage/sage &> test.log

is attached.

Test log:

as you can see, there is one test failing, but I think it is not related. Should I check if all tests run without the patch for me?
