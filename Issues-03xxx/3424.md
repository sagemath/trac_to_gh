mat.jordan_form(CDF) gives the wrong Jordan form for some matrices because mat.charpoly().roots() sometimes gives separate roots when it should give a single root.

I'm not sure I follow you. Using the rounding method from the patch:

```
sage: def do_round(eval, digits):
....:     eval = CDF(eval) 
....:     r = CDF(round(eval.real(), digits), round(eval.imag(), digits))
....:     return r
....: 
sage: do_round(1.44999999, 3)
1.45
sage: do_round(1.45000001, 3)
1.45
sage: do_round(1.54999999, 3)
1.55
```

This seems to be the desired behavior.

It depends on how many digits you round to.

```
sage: do_round(1.44999999, 1)
1.4
sage: do_round(1.45000001, 1)
1.5
sage: do_round(1.54999999, 1)
1.5
sage: 1.45000001 - 1.44999999
1.99999998784506e-8
sage: 1.54999999 - 1.45000001
0.0999999800000002
```

Here the first and second numbers round differently, even though they differ by about 2e-8; and the second and third numbers round the same, even though they differ by about 0.1.  Similar examples could be found for rounding to any number of digits.
