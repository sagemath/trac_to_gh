mat.jordan_form(CDF) gives the wrong Jordan form for some matrices because mat.charpoly().roots() sometimes gives separate roots when it should give a single root. Attached is a patch that adds a new parameter to jordan_form so that users can specify a number of digits of rounding to the roots of the characteristic polynomial.

```
sage: def do_round(eval, digits):

Here the first and second numbers round differently, even though they differ by about 2e-8; and the second and third numbers round the same, even though they differ by about 0.1.  Similar examples could be found for rounding to any number of digits.
