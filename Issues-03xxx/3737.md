I would like to include lines like these in tut.tex:

```
\begin{verbatim}
sage: A = Matrix([[1,2,3],[3,2,1],[1,1,1]])
sage: Y = vector([0,-4,-1])
sage: A \ Y
(-2, 1, 0)
\end{verbatim}
```
When I include these, doctesting fails on tut.tex, giving an error about something 500 lines away, and giving an error after half a second, whereas if these lines are removed, doctesting finishes successfully in about 30 seconds. 

I would guess that the problem is the backslash in the verbatim environment.
