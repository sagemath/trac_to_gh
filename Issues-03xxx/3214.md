I got very confused by the first line since I used to use gcd for clearing denominators:

```
sage: gcd((1, 2/3, 1/6, 1/6))
1
sage: gcd((2/3, 1/6, 1/6))
1/6
sage: gcd((2/3, 1, 1/6, 1/6))
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: Argument 'other' has incorrect type (expected sage.rings.rational.Rational, got sage.rings.integer.Integer)
sage: gcd((2/3, 2/2, 1/6, 1/6))
1/6
```

I'd expect all calls above to return 1/6.

OK, following the discussion at http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/35abc577b5ba78e7/170c0da22b9a36b9#170c0da22b9a36b9 I am implementing a trivial gcd() method for rational numbers and renaming the current rational gcd() to content().
The (newly) attached patch also touches a few other files in the sage library that are affected by this.

There is one doctest failure that I don't know how to deal with, in the symbolic gcd of ginac; sage -t symbolic/expression.pyx exposes this.

I applied the patch successfully to 3.2.3.   Alex has done a good job of testing -- I did not do a testall, just tested all in sage/rings.

It took me a few seconds (well, minutes) to see that gcd(nums)/lcm(denoms) was the right answer.  nice!

I found it hard to use the content function though.  None of these work if L is a list of integers or rationals:  L.content(), content(L), QQ.content(L), ZZ.content(L).  Can we not have these?  Also if v is an element of `ZZ^n` then v.content() would also be useful.  I could perhaps be persuaded to put these enhancements into a different ticket.

I don't know what to do about the ginac failure:

```
sage: var('x,y',ns=1)
(x, y)
sage: f = -289*x*y - 17*x^2*y + 3/7*x^5*y + x^7 + 17*x^6 + 2/3*x^2 - 51/7*y^2 + 34/3*x + 2/7*y
sage: g = -289*x*y + 3/7*x^5*y - 17*x^13*y + x^18 + 2/3*x^13 + 17*x^6 - 51/7*y^2 + 34/3*x + 2/7*y
sage: f.gcd(g)
<boom>
```
It fails trying to convert a non-integral rational to an integer.  Simpler polys in place of f anf g work fine.  As I don't even know what ginac is or does I'm stuck!

Burcin,

can you take a look at this since the pynac issue is holding up this patch?

Somebody else ought to change the summary of this ticket since this is not related to coercion at all.

Cheers,

Michael

Changed the summary to something a little more descriptive.

The right time to work on fixing the pynac issue would have been SD12 since both Burcin and I were there, but (as always) other stuff got in the way.  Anyway, I really don't know how to even start fixing this issue, so hints (or fixes) would be highly appreciated.

I finally found time to look at this.

attachment:trac_3214-py_gcd.patch fixes the doctest problem. It is not a very clean solution, but since we are going to switch to using Sage/Singular for gcd's it's not worth investing more time in this.

If someone can look over my 2 line patch, and change the subject to "positive review", maybe this can still make it to 3.3.
