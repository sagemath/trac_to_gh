I got very confused by the first line since I used to use gcd for clearing denominators:

```
sage: gcd((1, 2/3, 1/6, 1/6))
1
sage: gcd((2/3, 1/6, 1/6))
1/6
sage: gcd((2/3, 1, 1/6, 1/6))
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: Argument 'other' has incorrect type (expected sage.rings.rational.Rational, got sage.rings.integer.Integer)
sage: gcd((2/3, 2/2, 1/6, 1/6))
1/6
```

I'd expect all calls above to return 1/6.

Robert, I'm not sure I understand your suggestion.  The current code already constructs a sequence.  The problem is that when the universe of that sequence is QQ, bailing out of the loop as soon as one gets 1 is wrong.

If QQ were the only obstruction this would be easy to fix, but the same will happen with other fraction fields (number fields, p-adics, rational functions, etc.)

I'm actually getting more and more convinced that I don't like this use of gcd for fraction fields anyway; but I'll take this to sage-devel and see what people think.

**Attachment:** [trac_3214.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket3214/trac_3214.patch)

OK, following the discussion at http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/35abc577b5ba78e7/170c0da22b9a36b9#170c0da22b9a36b9 I am implementing a trivial gcd() method for rational numbers and renaming the current rational gcd() to content().
The (newly) attached patch also touches a few other files in the sage library that are affected by this.

There is one doctest failure that I don't know how to deal with, in the symbolic gcd of ginac; sage -t symbolic/expression.pyx exposes this.

I applied the patch successfully to 3.2.3.   Alex has done a good job of testing -- I did not do a testall, just tested all in sage/rings.

It took me a few seconds (well, minutes) to see that gcd(nums)/lcm(denoms) was the right answer.  nice!

I found it hard to use the content function though.  None of these work if L is a list of integers or rationals:  L.content(), content(L), QQ.content(L), ZZ.content(L).  Can we not have these?  Also if v is an element of `ZZ^n` then v.content() would also be useful.  I could perhaps be persuaded to put these enhancements into a different ticket.

I don't know what to do about the ginac failure:

```
sage: var('x,y',ns=1)
(x, y)
sage: f = -289*x*y - 17*x^2*y + 3/7*x^5*y + x^7 + 17*x^6 + 2/3*x^2 - 51/7*y^2 + 34/3*x + 2/7*y
sage: g = -289*x*y + 3/7*x^5*y - 17*x^13*y + x^18 + 2/3*x^13 + 17*x^6 - 51/7*y^2 + 34/3*x + 2/7*y
sage: f.gcd(g)
<boom>
```
It fails trying to convert a non-integral rational to an integer.  Simpler polys in place of f anf g work fine.  As I don't even know what ginac is or does I'm stuck!

Burcin,

can you take a look at this since the pynac issue is holding up this patch?

Somebody else ought to change the summary of this ticket since this is not related to coercion at all.

Cheers,

Michael

**Attachment:** [trac_3214-py_gcd.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket3214/trac_3214-py_gcd.patch)

I finally found time to look at this.

[attachment:trac_3214-py_gcd.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket3214/trac_3214-py_gcd.patch) fixes the doctest problem. It is not a very clean solution, but since we are going to switch to using Sage/Singular for gcd's it's not worth investing more time in this.

If someone can look over my 2 line patch, and change the subject to "positive review", maybe this can still make it to 3.3.
