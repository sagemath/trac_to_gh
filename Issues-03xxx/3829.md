```
sage: # (YES) Ln(Tan(x/2+Pi/4))-ArcSinh(Tan(x))=0
sage: # Yes, in that the thing is clearly not equal to 0!
sage: f = log(tan(x/2 + pi/4)) - arcsin(tan(x))
sage: bool(f == 0)
False
```

The problem with this doctest is actually quite simple:

```
ArcSinh != arcsin
```

AAARRRRGGGHGHHHHH!!!!!!

But the proof was fun...

Fredrik,

I spent quite some time convincing myself that that identity is true. The proof is attached as PDF. You must be able to take the logarithm of `tan(x/2 + pi/4)` in order for the identity to make sense, but for any branch you take where it makes sense it is true. The problem with evaluating numerically at `x = 3` is that symbolic log doesn't like negative numbers, and `tan(3/2 + pi/4) = -1.15265520898227` so it returns a `NaN`.
