I've reinterpreted this ticket as "random_element methods which call other random_element methods should pass on *args and **kwds".  This applies mostly to `sage.rings`, but also a few other cases.  The list below shows the output of `sage: search_src("def random_element")`, annotated by the changes this patch makes.

`make ptestlong` passes all tests, and documentation builds without errors or warnings.  Details below.

Note that #9481 fixes `random_element` for univariate power series rings, and I've ignored padics since there is a large revision in process: e.g. #6084 and #5075.

I rebased the patch to 4.5.3.alpha2 and ran long doctests: all passed. The patch also looks good, the only issue I'd have: I'd either move the lines "Trac#3893 ..." to the TESTS:: section or remove that line completely. I understand that people want to point out where something changed, but that docstring is saying nothing to a user since it is developer information.

I'm not sure what the official policy is, but I'd say it would be a bit odd when in a few years time the docstring is cluttered with trac ticket numbers, what information do they communicate that is relevant? I am very much in favour of having "`Passes extra positional or keyword arguments through::`". I leave it up to you, so you have a positive review, i.e. toggle it yourself if you don't want to change it.
