Yes, here's an example of this in the sage notebook text form (I made the triple {'s into double for this ticket): 

{{{
Untitled
system:gap


{{id=112|
Print(2 + 2); # add numbers
Print(3 + 3); # add more numbers
///

4
}}
}}}

This problem can be fixed by adding the following lines at the start of the 
eval method in the file interfaces/gap.py:

```
        # remove comments, replace newlines by space
        x = "".join([(r[:r.find('#')] if r.find('#')!=-1 else r)+' ' \
                     for r in x.split('\n')])
```

(This still needs to be tested on a variety of GAP input lines.)

I also noticed that if the length of the string processed by GAP is more than ~103 characters, then no output is produced (although the GAP code seems to be evaluated correctly and any functions defined in the code works in subsequent notebook cells).

Here is an example:

```
{{id=112|
%gap
test := function()
return "make a long input string  (delete 1 char to see the output)";
end;
test();
///
}}
```
