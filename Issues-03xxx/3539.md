Dear SAGE community,

I am trying to compute characters for some finite fields.

With "small" fields, everything is fine:
 sage:   K=CyclotomicField(10);
 sage:   p=10151;
 sage:   Character=DirichletGroup(p,K);
 sage:   Khi=Character.0;
 sage:   Khi(7)
 zeta10

However, with slightly larger fields:
 sage:   K=CyclotomicField(10);
 sage:   p=100151;
 sage:   Character=DirichletGroup(p,K);
 sage:   Khi=Character.0;
 sage:   Khi(7)
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 AttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call
 last)

 /users/cacao/bissogae/<ipython console> in <module>()

 /localdisk/tmp/sage-3.0.3/local/lib/python2.5/site-packages/sage/modular/dirichlet.py
 in __call__(self, m)

 /localdisk/tmp/sage-3.0.3/local/lib/python2.5/site-packages/sage/modular/dirichlet.py
 in values(self)

 AttributeError: 'sage.rings.integer_mod.IntegerMod_int64' object has no
 attribute 'ivalue'

Is there something I am missing?

Thanks,
 --Gaetan
