It's very annoying that "sage -gdb" doesn't work under OS X 10.5.

Here's the temporary workaround I've been using when I need it:

1. Comment this in sage/all.py:

```
# We have to set this here so urllib, etc. can detect it. 
#import sage.server.notebook.gnutls_socket_ssl
#sage.server.notebook.gnutls_socket_ssl.require_SSL()
```

2. Type this:

```
sage -sh
gdb python
...
r
...
>>> from sage.all import *
```

I'm not sure how to fix this problem.  Basically any importing of anything related to ipython or the ntoebook seems to halt gdb.  Maybe there is some option to gdb to make it ignore such signals.

sage -gdb has been working for me on OSX for a long time. Every once in a while it craps out, but the next run usually works. One thing that really annoys me are all the missing debug symbol messages at startup.

Program exited normally.
(gdb) 
```
By best guess would be that this is ipython related, specifically in `local/bin/sage-gdb-pythonstartup` we have

```
from sage.all import *
import os, sys
sys.argv = ['', '-rc', os.environ['IPYTHONRC'], \
                '-c', os.environ['SAGE_STARTUP_COMMAND'] + '; banner()']
import IPython
IPython.Shell.IPShell().mainloop(sys_exit=1, banner='')
```
