This patch creates a new sage_input function, that does things like this:

```
sage: sage_input((polygen(GF(3))+1)^4)

R.<x> = GF(3)[]
x^4 + x^3 + x + 1
```

sage_input is implemented for only a few types; but I picked "complicated" types, so I think the underlying framework is ready to go.  Once this patch has been accepted, I plan to go through and add support for many more types.

This patch depends on #3484.

There is some slight problem applying this:

```
sage-3.1.alpha2/devel/sage$ patch -p1 --dry-run < trac_3485-sage_input-v2.patch 
patching file sage/misc/all.py
Hunk #1 succeeded at 65 (offset 2 lines).
patching file sage/misc/sage_input.py
patching file sage/rings/integer.pyx
Hunk #1 succeeded at 2943 (offset 16 lines).
patching file sage/rings/integer_mod.pyx
patching file sage/rings/integer_ring.pyx
Hunk #1 succeeded at 823 with fuzz 2 (offset 8 lines).
patching file sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_element.pyx
patching file sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_ring.py
Hunk #1 succeeded at 392 with fuzz 2 (offset 17 lines).
patching file sage/rings/real_mpfr.pyx
Hunk #1 succeeded at 280 (offset 12 lines).
Hunk #2 succeeded at 966 (offset 16 lines).
patching file sage/rings/ring.pyx
Hunk #1 FAILED at 1505.
1 out of 1 hunk FAILED -- saving rejects to file sage/rings/ring.pyx.rej
```
It also seems that only trac3485-sage_input-v2.patch should be applied.

Thoughts?

Cheers,

Michael

Yes, only apply -v2.patch.

The patch to ring.pyx only adds a new method, so it should be easy to apply by hand.  But if you don't want to do that, I can rebase the patch against alpha1 tonight.
