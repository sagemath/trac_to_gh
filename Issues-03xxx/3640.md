See http://math.univ-lyon1.fr/~tdumont/sageproblems/problems

The issue is that the spkg-install has hard coded spkg versions of cddlib and gmp.

Fixed spkg coming up.

At

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mabshoff/polymake-2.2.p5.spkg

there is an spkg, but it needs cleaning up since it contains a bunch of junk. The actual diff is at 

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mabshoff/polymake-2.2.p5.spkg-install.diff

Applying that to the current spkg is probably less work.

Cheers,

```

But the same doctest passes flawlessly on Linux, so this is some polymake problem.

Given the situation I would recommend that we merge the updated polymake.spkg and then sort out the problem on OSX afterwards since as is things are plain broken everywhere, which is even worst.

Cheers,

Michael

I agree: it is better than the present situation.  If I have time I will try to figure out the failure on OS X, but it is not my top priority right now.
