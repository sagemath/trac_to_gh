See http://math.univ-lyon1.fr/~tdumont/sageproblems/problems

The issue is that the spkg-install has hard coded spkg versions of cddlib and gmp.

Fixed spkg coming up.

<a id='comment:1'>**Comment 1:**</a>
At

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mabshoff/polymake-2.2.p5.spkg

there is an spkg, but it needs cleaning up since it contains a bunch of junk. The actual diff is at 

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mabshoff/polymake-2.2.p5.spkg-install.diff

Applying that to the current spkg is probably less work.

Cheers,

Michael

I have updated the spkg at

and made substantial improvements over the version I mentioned above a couple hours ago. It is close to something I would find acceptable :)

But the same doctest passes flawlessly on Linux, so this is some polymake problem.

Given the situation I would recommend that we merge the updated polymake.spkg and then sort out the problem on OSX afterwards since as is things are plain broken everywhere, which is even worst.

Cheers,
