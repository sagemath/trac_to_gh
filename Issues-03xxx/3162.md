For certain well-conditioned floating-point matrices with entries in ComplexField, echelon_form can return matrices which are not in (approximate) echelon_form.   This breaks methods like rank(), right_solve() and inverse().  

 I've attached a sample matrix which illustrates this

This bug is probably related to #2256 and #1132 but there the problem with echelon_form is more subtle (1 entries on the diagonal which aren't quite 1), which is why I opened this new ticket.

The problem here seems to be just basic numerical instability.  Basically, the pivots need to be chosen more carefully when working over a "floating-point" field.     In this particular matrix, echelon form is done via "_echelon_in_place_classical".  What happens is that after clearing the first column, the (1,1) entry is very nearly 0.  Despite this, it is still chosen as the pivot, and using it to clear down results in some very large entries in the rest of the matrix.   For reasons I don't fully understand, when one starts clearing from the next pivot not everything goes away.  

Presumably, the thing to do is to go look at some numerical analysis text and see what you're supposed to do here, but as a start, picking pivots which aren't close to zero would probably solve this.  

Here is printout of the various steps in this process.
