We can talk to Viktor at ISSAC about how to add Sage to this. 

I think we should just list all the GB related functionality supported by the packages in Sage, even if the functions aren't exposed from the Sage library.

Triaging ancient tickets here...

It looks like this was never done, and I would argue it shouldn't have been done: Sage doesn't provide a new implementation of GB, just a wrapper for some existing implementations. So I vote to simply close this ticket.
