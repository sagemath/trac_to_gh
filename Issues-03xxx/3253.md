Hi Jim,

in 2.10.3-rc4 jacob() was changed to gradient() - see #2425 for details. We do not yet have a proper procedure to deprecate/rename functions like that, i.e. the old version would print a warning for a couple months and then be removed. I hope this fixes the issue for you.

I will bring the deprecation issue up on sage-devel again since last time we didn't really have an end result from the discussion and as more people that don't follow development too closely use Sage we want to avoid breaking their code needlessly and if we have to change names it should be clear what caused it and suggest a fix.

Cheers,

Michael

Ah, I thought this might come up.  I have replaced the patch with a new one, where I have put a very simple-minded gradient() function in MPolynomial, but it is of course quite a bit slower than the specialized one for MPolynomial_libsingular, so I don't want to remove the latter.  The function jacobian_ideal() is now in MPolynomial.

BTW, if anyone has ideas on how to make the generic gradient() faster in MPolynomial, I would happily implement them.
