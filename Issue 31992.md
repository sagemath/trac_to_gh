I believe that 1 and 3 are resolved in the meantime. Regarding 2 I also believe that upon creation of B-Terms, we should take the absolute value of the specified coefficient. That should be relatively easy to take care of; do we just need to adapt `BTerm.__init__`, or other places like `BTermMonoid._convert_construction_` (as indicated by the added TODO) as well?

EDIT: forgot to say: I've reviewed the code here, the implementation looks good to me (and the fact that #32278 works as intended is also a good indicator of the code here doing what it should).

I have just started playing with BTerms. They are a nice addition, thank you all for your work!

The way the validity condition gets lost here looks like a bug to me:

```
sage: n = SR.var('n')
sage: Asy = AsymptoticRing('QQ^n * n^ZZ', QQ)
sage: ET = Asy.term_monoid('exact')
sage: BT = Asy.term_monoid('B')

See https://trac.sagemath.org/31922 for details.
  instance = typecall(cls, *args, **options)
sage: bt = Asy(BT(n, valid_from={'n': 10})); bt
B(1.000000000000000*n, n >= 10)
sage: Asy(ET(2^n))*bt
B(1.000000000000000*2^n*n, n >= 0)
```
(This is with 9.5.beta0 + branch from this ticket.)
But maybe I am misunderstanding how BTerms are supposed to behave?

Indeed this is wrong. When I remember correctly, at the moment only polynomial terms are fully implemented (by #31933) and I would expect a `NotImplementedError` for the above.

Hey! You are definitely right, multiplying BTerms apparently has some problems, I can reproduce it even in a simpler setting:

```
sage: AR.<n> = AsymptoticRing('n^QQ', QQ)
sage: AR.B(42*n, valid_from=3) * AR.B(n, valid_from=5)                                                                                                                                                         
B(42*n^2, n >= 0)
sage: AR.B(42*n, valid_from=3) * n

```

Curiously, we simply had not implemented multiplication of `BTerms` so far. Now multiplication should respect the bounds; and I've also fixed  `BTermMonoid`s not coercing into `OTermMonoid`s.

I have opened #32692 for the point about non-growth factors raised in my last previous comment.

There are several comments above along the lines of "I have reviewed the code up to this point at it looks good to me". _I_ have reviewed the two commits made in response to my comment, and they look good to me, but I am reluctant to set the ticket to positive review without input from people actually working on asymptotic expansions `:-)`.

What do you think? It there a reason to delay this ticket any longer?

Sorry for the inconvenience, there is no reason to delay this ticket.

I have reviewed the implementation of multiplication for `BTerms`. LGTM.
