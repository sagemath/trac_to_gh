but this does not:

As mentionned by Vincent to me, it might be related to #8450. Possibly a duplicate?

`@`slabbe: what makes you doubt that it is not a duplicate? #8450 has more plot failure examples, the same reference to the ask question and an explanation of the failure.

Vincent, what makes you think that I was doubting? It is just that I had 60 emails to read this morning and I did not have time to dig it further. I left the question open for someone (else or me later) to solve the question. Please...
