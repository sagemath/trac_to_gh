I have not tried this out but if you are confident that the doctests pass with these changes, then feel free to set it to positive review.

There is a problem in fpylll 0.4 with python3:

I patched around that like this:

I've updated fpylll's master. I can cut a new release if that helps.

I'm not a sage developer, so I don't know whats best here. For distributions I think a new release would be best, otherwise everybody has to fix it individually.

If you want feedback before changing something you should probably set to "needs review" to get someone more qualified than me to look at it.

I guess we do need a fresh review, though?
