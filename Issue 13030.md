Keywords: conversion

Some conversion between different BooleanPolynomial rings fail but they should not

example :
{{
sage: B.<a,b,c,d> = BooleanPolynomialRing(order='degrevlex')
sage: P.<c,d> = BooleanPolynomialRing(order='lex')
sage: P(B('c'))
ERROR: An unexpected error occurred while tokenizing input
The following traceback may be corrupted or invalid
The error message is: ('EOF in multi-line statement', (1369, 0))
.......
TypeError: cannot convert polynomial c to Boolean PolynomialRing in c, d: name b not defined

Still, there is something relatively annoying :

```
sage: R.<x,y,z> = BooleanPolynomialRing(order='degrevlex')
sage: m = x          # a random monomial
sage: x.lm().index() # the index of the first variable of m, most people would expect "0"
2
sage: R.gen(2)
z
```
And in fact, to make it shorter:

```
sage: R.gen(0) == R.gen( R.gen(0).lm().index() )
False
```

While this is not a bug in itself, it is disturbing, and it has caused at least one problem in my code. It also exposes to the user something that should be kept hidden from her (namely, how the sage interface implements the degrevlex ordering on top of polybori). 

Fixing the .index() function to avoid this would in any case break Alexander's patch. If I understand correctly, his patch relies on this "feature"

Yes, I'm about to fix that. (It's not only index to be fixed.)

I thought ring.variable(i) should give the i-th polybori variable (not reordered). But thinking twice, that would cause more problems than it solves.
 
> So, do we want to remove the degrevlex from BooleanPolynomialRing altogether, and instruct users to use the newly implemented degneglex instead, or do we want to actually support degrevlex? (and how?)

The problem is the ambigious nature of pbori.pyx:
On the one hand, it is the Sage implementation of BooleanPolynomial which should support degrevlex in such a way, that the user is not aware of the reversed variables hack.
On the other hand, Sage uses pbori.pyx as a lightweight alternative to polybori's original (boost-based) C++-to-python interface (for running polybori's highlevel library stuff in <python-site>/polybori/*). We don't need degrevlex here (but degneglex).

The latter is trivial, once `DegNegLex` is in Sage. For the first point, I will provide a first variant later this day.

Here's my proposed change to `pbori.pyx` `.index()`, `.iterindex()` and related functions obey the variable reordering in degrevlex now. Also, degneglex is supported now. Feel free to test it. (There are only a few degrevlex examples in the doctests, so some functionality might not be covered.)
