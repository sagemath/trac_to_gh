The coefficients of an affine connection D in a frame (e<sub>i</sub>) are computed according to the formula

Gamma<sup>k</sup><sub>ij</sub> = (De<sub>i</sub>)(f<sub>k</sub> , e<sub>j</sub>)

where (f<sub>k</sub>) stands for the coframe dual to (e<sub>i</sub>). In the current implementation, this is performed by a triple loop on k, i and j with a recomputation of De<sub>i</sub> at each stage of the inner loop (!). This makes the whole computation terribly slow for manifold dimensions > 2. This ticket reorders the loops, factoring De<sub>i</sub>. As a result, in Sage 8.9.rc1, we pass from 

```
sage -t --long src/sage/manifolds/differentiable/affine_connection.py
