Based on a quick look - two questions and a suggestion.

1.  Does this address the complaint at #10312?  Fully, or partially?

2.  There is a command `is_Vector()`.  Or do we just care that `x[0]` (and the rest of x) is made up of iterables?  Would anything that can list itself qualify?  Might there be a better test?

If you name your patch so it ends in ".patch" then Trac will give a nice red/green view of it in a web browser.  Without, its just the raw patch test.

Thanks,
Rob

Well, the best thing to do would be to rewrite the entire matrix construction routines.  ;-)  I've made lots of changes to the vector constructor recently, but the matrix constructor always looks like a much bigger job.

The `is_vector` attribute check is pretty bad - an object could have that method and the method could return `False`.  But I can understand the desire to just change small parts (which is fine).  That said, is it safe to remove `copy = False`?

I'll run some tests overnight.

If you look at the init method of `Matrix_generic_dense`, you see that the given list of entries is simply assigned to the attribute `self._entries`, if copy is False, and a copy of the list of entries is assigned to `self._entries` otherwise.

Note that the init method of `Matrix_generic_dense` actually does not use the "copy" function: The copy is constructed explicitly. I could imagine that this is not optimal, but that's a different topic.

Now, is it safe to keep "copy=False" in your patch? I think so. You create a new list, both when you transform a list of vectors resp. a list of lists into a single list of entries. So, "copy=True" would be a waste of time.

Concerning the test for the presence of "is_vector": I think one could easily do better.

Whithout your patch, what one actually used was the method "list()" of vectors (see line 28 of your patch). With your patch, you use that a vector is iterable, by doing e.extend(v) in line 30 of your patch.

If I am not mistaken, good Python tradition is to duck test using the methods that are actually needed. Hence, without your patch, it would have been better to simply try to use "v.list()", and catch the attribute error. And with your patch, it would be better to simply try "e.extend(v)", and catch the error that results if v is not iterable.

Moreover, I really think that the following should be made work:

```
sage: MS = MatrixSpace(GF(5),4,2)
sage: MS0 = MatrixSpace(GF(5),2)
sage: MS([MS0.random_element(), MS0.random_element()])
```

Hence, the matrix constructor should also accept lists of matrices (not just list of vectors), and should automatically stack the matrices from the list.

The problem with duck typing via "list()" is that we could have matrices over a ring whose elements have a list() method. In that case, we would not want to use list() in the matrix constructor.

Perhaps one could proceed as follows:

```python
         if isinstance(x, list) and len(x) > 0:
             # If the list has the expected length, then
             # we are likely to have a list of elements of
             # the base ring
             if len(x) < self.__ncols*self.__nrows:
                 e = []
                 for v in x:
                     try:
                         e.extend(v.list())
                     except AttributeError:
                         e.extend(v)
                 x = e
                 # x is a new list, hence, copy=False is OK
                 copy = False
             # Now, x presumably is a list of ring elements.
             if not rows:
                 new_x = []
                 for k in xrange(len(x)):
                     i = k % self.__ncols
                     j = k // self.__ncols
                     new_x.append( x[ i*self.__nrows + j ] )
                 x = new_x
         return self.__matrix_class(self, entries=x, copy=copy, coerce=coerce) 
```


Do you think that my idea makes sense? It would allow to define a matrix by a list of (lists, matrices, vectors) -- the three could actually be combined.

I have to leave office now, but I hope that I'll find time to create a patch later or tomorrow.

I have attached a patch with my suggested code (with some minor modifications) and a new doc test.

Also I can provide more timings. They show that the second patch not only provides more flexibility but also a mild speedup on top of what is achieved by the first patch.

Here are the timings on my computer for the examples you gave, with both, only the first, and no patch, respectively (I considered the wall time in each case):

```
sage: M=MatrixSpace(GF(46337),400)
sage: m=M.random_element()
sage: m1=m.columns()
sage: time M(m1)
400 x 400 dense matrix over Finite Field of size 46337
Time: CPU 0.68 s, Wall: 0.67 s
// without second patch: 0.72 s
// without patches: 1.46 s

sage: M=MatrixSpace(GF(46337),400)
sage: m=M.random_element()
sage: m1=m.columns()
sage: time M(m1)
400 x 400 dense matrix over Finite Field of size 46337
Time: CPU 0.66 s, Wall: 0.66 s
// without second patch: 0.66 s
// without patches: 1.38 s
```


The ticket description mentions the creation from list of lists, but there were no timings, so far. 

```
sage: MS = MatrixSpace(GF(5),1000)
sage: L = 1000*[[GF(5)(i) for i in range(1000)]]
sage: %time M = MS(L)
CPU times: user 0.02 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.02 s
Wall time: 0.03 s
// without second patch: 0.04 s
// without both patches: 5.14 s
sage: sum(L,[]) == M.list()
True
```


If a matrix is created from a plain list (not list of lists), the first patch had a slow down. The second patch brings it back to the original speed:

```
sage: MS = MatrixSpace(GF(5),4000)
# Matrix creation by a single list
sage: L = 4000*[GF(5)(i) for i in range(4000)]
sage: %time M = MS(L)
CPU times: user 0.20 s, sys: 0.02 s, total: 0.22 s
Wall time: 0.23 s
// without second patch: 0.38 s
// without both patches: 0.21 s
```



Here are the new doc tests, that would fail without the second patch:

```
            sage: MS = MatrixSpace(ZZ,4,2)
            sage: MS0 = MatrixSpace(ZZ,2)

        A list of matrices::

            sage: MS.matrix([MS0([1,2,3,4]), MS0([5,6,7,8])])
            [1 2]
            [3 4]
            [5 6]
            [7 8]

        A mixed list of matrices and vectors::

            sage: MS.matrix( [MS0([1,2,3,4])] + list(MS0([5,6,7,8])) )
            [1 2]
            [3 4]
            [5 6]
            [7 8]
```


Last, allow me to increase the priority of the ticket. An improvement from more than 5 seconds to less than 0.05 seconds is not "minor".

I see what happened.

I test whether the length of x coincides with the number of entries of the matrix. If it does, then it is assumed that it is a list of ring elements.

The error occurs if the matrix space has one row and one column. If the input is, say, `[This is the Trac macro *0* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#0-macro)`, then the length of that list is one. Hence, with my patch, it is directly forwarded to the init method of the matrix class -- but it *should* send `[0]` to the init method.

Fixing it now, then repeating the timings...

I updated my patch. Now, the doctests in sage/matrix, sage/schemes/elliptic_curves and doc/ pass.

Let me summarise the problem:

- I think it should be possible to create a matrix from a list of vectors *or* matrices; actually it should be possible to combine both.
- The old "ducktyping" of vectors is not suitable for matrices, because they don't have a method "is_vector()".
- Both vectors and matrices have a method "list()", and that is exactly what is used in the pre-processing of data. Hence, why not just duck-type via "list()"?
- Problem: Number field elements have that method as well. If v is a number field element, then v.list() returns a pair of numbers - that is not what we want.

My new patch works as follows:

1. Preprocessing is needed if the input is not a plain list of elements. If the given list is too short or if the number of columns is one, then it is possible that the given list contains something that is not just a ring element (e.g., a vector, a matrix, or a list). That is line 1231 of my patch.
2. Since pure duck typing turned out to be error prone, I test in line 1237 whether we have a list or tuple using "isinstance", in which case we extend our list of entries.
3. Otherwise, duck typing is used to catch vectors and matrices. It turns out that both vectors and matrices have an attribute "row()" and an attribute "list()", whereas number field elements have no "row()". If we have list/vector, then we extend our list of entries by "v.list()".
4. Otherwise, we suppose that we have an element of the base ring (or something that will eventually be converted into the base ring - that case is subject to a new doc test), and append it to our list of entries.

The doc test problems concerning number field elements vanished with the new patch version. Moreover, the speed is still fine. I am running all long doc tests now, and return to "needs review".

I've read trough to code and everything looks sensible to me. There was a problem with reproducing the slowdown that my patch introces. On sage.math.washington.edu (with sage.4.8.alpha4) I get something between 0.30 and 0.33 seconds for the following test:


```
sage: MS = MatrixSpace(GF(5),4000)
# Matrix creation by a single list
sage: L = 4000*[GF(5)(i) for i in range(4000)]
sage: %time M = MS(L)
```

And that timing stays the same with either my, or both patches applied.

But since the timing is only not reproducible for my patch, this ticket can still have positive review.
