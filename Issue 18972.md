This ticket implements pseudo-riemannian metrics on infinitely differentiable manifolds (i.e. smooth manifolds) over **R**. This is a follow-up of #19147 within the [SageManifolds project](http://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/) (see the metaticket #18528 for an overview).

This ticket implements the following Python classes:

- `PseudoRiemannianMetric` for pseudo-Riemannian metrics on a real smooth manifold
  - `PseudoRiemannianMetricParal` for pseudo-Riemannian metrics on a real smooth parallelizable manifold
- `LeviCivitaConnection` for the Levi-Civita connection associated with a pseudo-Riemannian metric.

Various methods of the above classes allow for the computation of

- the connection coefficients and Christoffel symbols of the Levi-Civita connection associated with a 
  given metric
- the Riemann and Ricci tensor of a given metric
- the Ricci scalar of a given metric
- the Weyl tensor of a given metric
- the volume n-form associated with a given metric on a n-dimensional manifold
- the metric duals of tensor fields (musical isomorphisms)  

The user interface is via the method `DiffManifold.metric()`. At the user choice, CPU-demanding computations (like that of the Riemann tensor) can be parallelized, thanks to #18100.
