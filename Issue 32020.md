As noted in #32001#comment:1, pynac fails on `cygwin-standard`. We add a patch to `singular` to fix this

I applied this locally on Cygwin on Windows 10.
It works and makes #32001 work.

I'm curious how you figured out those changes
would solve this problem! Thank you!

Thanks for testing! The fix was just an extension of one that Hans Schoenemann did earlier this year to get Cygwin working.
