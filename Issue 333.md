William's idea: Notebook splash page should show last cell evaluated.

Tom's addition: a "privacy" flag should be added to worksheets, so people can prevent their worksheets from broadcasting to the splash page.  This is less important.

I think this ticket should be set to invalid because the notebook has a multi-user model now.
