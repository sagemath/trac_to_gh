# Issue 17837: contour_plot of zero

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: novoselt

Original creation time: 2015-03-27 19:37:18

CC:  kcrisman

Keywords: plot

In Sage-6.6.rc0 and before 

```
sage: contour_plot(0, (0,1), (0,1)).show()
```

fails deep in matplotlib with

```
ValueError: zero-size array to reduction operation minimum which has no identity
```

although non-zero constants can be handled.

This works now. The PR just adds a doctest.

I'm okay with this, and I just checked it works [here](https://sagecell.sagemath.org/?z=eJxLzs8ryS8tii_IyS_RMNBRAGJDTSilCQCSdwf-&lang=sage&interacts=eJyLjgUAARUAuQ==).    I personally think it is quite helpful - someone might accidentally put in a complicated function that actually just is identically zero :)
