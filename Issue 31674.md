I'll test that tomorrow. A couple remarks :

* `eval` can be farmed out to `sympy`'s `And` (one of the goals of this addition being the ability to use `Sympy`'s `Piecewise` expressions of integrals and ODE solutions, often involving logical expressions...). I was originally aiming at wrapping `Sympy`'s logical functions, but got stopped by :

* The showstopper problem I haven't been able to solve yet is **translation to Maxima** and //backtranslation//.

  This is utterly necessary if you want to keep logical symbolic expressions (or symbolic expressions involving logical parts, as in `case` calls) `simplify`able (other `Expression` methods are also farmed out to Maxima...).

  OTOH, `maxima_calculus` should be easier, since this interface works "naturally" with the Lisp function tree representing Maxima expressions.

* Translation to `Mathematica` and `Sympy` should be trivial (give the names in a  `conversions` argument). I don't know (yet) what is offered by `giac` and `fricas`, but maintaining universal translatability seems highly desirable...

HTH,

Thank you for implementing this!

It seems that there is no entry for the new symbolic boolean operators in the reference manual. There should probably be more examples of use. A few naive trials:

```
sage: var('x y')
(x, y)
sage: s = x>0 & y<0
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for &: 'sage.symbolic.expression.Expression'
 and 'sage.symbolic.expression.Expression'
```



```
sage: from sage.functions.boolean import and_symbolic
sage: s = and_symbolic(x>0, y<0)
sage: bool(s.subs({x: 1, y: -2}))
TypeError: unable to make sense of Maxima expression 'and_symbolic(1>0,-2<0)'
 in Sage
```

The `&` operator is now implemented -- note that due to Python operator precedence, the operands need to be put in parentheses:

```
sage: var('x y') 
(x, y) 
sage: (x>0) & (y<0)

Possible alternatives :

* forget operators, and limit this functionality to logic functions.

* Borrow inspiration from R and create `&&`, `||` and possibly `~~` operators (analogous  to our representation of bit XOR as `^^`).

IMHO, a functional representatin is the most useful...

Thanks a lot ; I was searching in that direction, but missed the target you reached masterfully. Kudos !

BTW : "something" translating Maxima's `is` would be as useful as a translation of Maxima's `and`, `or` and `not`, necessary for the present ticket : 


```
(%i3) is(a>2);
(%o3)                               unknown
(%i4) is(subst([a=3],a>2));
(%o4)                                true
```


Not coincidentally, it has the same Sage syntax collision problem...

Shouldn't it be added to this ticket ? Alternatively, we could create a new ticket for this and and depend on it.

`is` is a Sage operator, roughly equivalent to Lisp's `eq` :

```
sage: x.parent() is SR
True
```


Therefore, the Maxima's `is` can't be translated by the mechanism used for Maxima's functions : 

```
sage: maxima.is(x>0)
  File "<ipython-input-6-e177b9fc4016>", line 1
    maxima.is(x>Integer(0))
           ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax

sage: maxima_calculus.is(x>0)
  File "<ipython-input-7-dea1cf49bee0>", line 1
    maxima_calculus.is(x>Integer(0))
                    ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```

Did you (or do you plan to) report it in Maxima's bug report system ?

BTW : Sympy's logical functions seem exempt from this bug :

```
sage: foo = x!=0
sage: sympy.And(*map(lambda u:u._sympy_(), (foo, foo)))._sage_()
x != 0
sage: sympy.Or(*map(lambda u:u._sympy_(), (foo, foo)))._sage_()
x != 0
sage: sympy.Not(foo._sympy_())._sage_()
x == 0
```

Wrapping Sympy's functions may be a quick way out (that was my initial plan...).

Indeed, the documentation is quite clear : `=` and `#` : //syntactic// (in)equality (i. e. isomorphic structures) ; `equal` and `unequal` : //value// (= structural) (in)equality.

This might be a heavy change. Separate ticket, separately tested ?

A possible plan B (independent of the Maxima snag) is to wrap Sympy's symbolic functions `And`, `Or` and `Not`, possibly leaving the logical operators to a later ticket. This is easy, the only problem being Maxima (1+back)translation, which you have solved.

Wrapping a Python method (imptementation of these functions in Sympy) shouldn't be as heavy as invoking a function in another interpreter : we stay in Python.

This is new functionality, after all : we don't (yet) have to worry about backwards compatibility. Introducing it with limited syntax (possibly extended later) isn't a drawback to anybody.

Thoughts ?

- `Parser`: Use a `make_...` function instead of importing `and_symbolic` and hardcoding its use - so that the other uses of `Parser` are not affected
- Add more documentation and tests
- possibly create a direct conversion from `bool` to `SR` so that we get to see `False`/`True`, not `0`/`1`
