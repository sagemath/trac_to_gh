Currently, there is no way to send `log_gamma` to Maxima, for instance.  This can be fixed by following the models in the functions/ directory; it should be possible to make it a GinacFunction.  Before doing so, though, one will have to resolve #10072, since the evaluation will be wrong (?) otherwise.

Burcin points out that 

```
sage: log_gamma(-2.1) 
NaN
```

is not good.  Sage itself does

```
sage: log(gamma(-2.1))
1.53171380819509 + 3.14159265358979*I
```

but Wolfram Alpha says

```
1.53171... - 9.42478... i
```

so the branches seem to differ even there.

Since #9130 has positive review:  Apply only [attachment:trac_10075_log_gamma_without_functions.rst.patch].

One might think that Burcin's comment about `-2.1` makes this 'needs work', but that is actually the current Sage behavior as well, so in principle that would be a different ticket, since making `log_gamma` symbolic would not introduce a regression...

In fact,

```
sage: log_gamma(-2.1)

Apparently this is how MPFR deals with this function.  So maybe all is well?

I mean, for this ticket.  Though we should not claim that it is evaluated by Ginac, because it isn't (all the above is in Sage with or without this patch).

Believe it [or not](http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=29335):

```
Not any negative value, but in lngamma.c:

  /* if x < 0 and -2k-1 <= x <= -2k, then lngamma(x) = NaN */

probably because the gamma value is negative. This is because MPFR defines
lngamma as log(gamma(x)) while the C standard defines it as log|gamma(x)|. I
wonder if this should be regarded as a bug or if a new function (say,
mpfr_lgamma) should be defined in MPFR (in which case, not before 2.3.0). Do
other standards (other languages) define such a function, either as
log(gamma(x)) or as log|gamma(x)|?
```


I'm cc:ing Paul Z. just to confirm that this is intended MPFR behavior.  We should then open another ticket to make sure to use mpmath or ginac or something to get complex answers.    We currently somehow use PARI to get the complex versions.

So both give `NaN`, but we end up using `RR.log_gamma()` as in the `GinacFunction` code.

What is the conjugate of plus infinity?  But I'll leave it for now, just to document it, unless someone has an objection, since we have in vanilla Sage
