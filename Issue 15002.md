Nondegeneracy is a weaker version of smoothness, that is actually comparatively easy to implement (relative to the existing `is_smooth`). This branch implements smoothness.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/15239

Compare Example 3.2.5 of Helmut A. Hamm, "Differential forms and Hodge numbers for toric complete intersections" ( http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.1826 ).  That example gives a hypersurface that is not non-degenerate.  It's worked out in a patch, but I think the following test with a homogeneous polynomial is equivalent:


```

X = toric_varieties.WP([1,4,2,3], names='z0 z1 z2 z3')

X.inject_variables()

g0 =z1^3 + z2^6 +z3^4

g = g0-2*z2^3*z0^6+z2*z0^10+z0^12

hyp = X.subscheme([g])
```



Right now, hyp.is_nondegenerate() returns True, but Hamm says it should return False.  The problem may be that the current code only checks at top-dimensional cones, rather than checking at all cones in the fan?

To add some urgency to this, Edgar Costa, David Harvey, and I are working on computing zeta functions of nondegenerate hypersurfaces using p-adic cohomology, so we would find this routine very useful.

I don't really know how polytopes work in Sage, but it certainly looks like the code iterates over cones of all dimensions in the fan. Maybe there's a problem with the test for individual cones?

Here's a corrected test indicating the problem:

```
sage: X = toric_varieties.WP([1,4,2,3], names='z0 z1 z2 z3')
sage: X.inject_variables()
Defining z0, z1, z2, z3

sage: hyp.is_nondegenerate() # Should return False per Hamm

There are also some subtleties surrounding the underlying mathematical concept. In particular, I would also take issue with this doctest:

```
sage: P1 = toric_varieties.P1()
sage: X = toric_varieties.P2_112().cartesian_product(P1)
sage: X.inject_variables()

sage: Y = X.subscheme([z4])    # = P2_112 x {point}
sage: Y.is_nondegenerate()

That's stronger than saying that the intersection should be lci, as in this example: the intersection of a smooth variety with itself is smooth but not transversal.

so that it wraps at 79 characters (even though here 72 is preferred)


```
sage: F = z0^2*z1^2*z2^2 + z1^2*z2^2*z3^2 + z0^2*z2^2*z4^2\
....: + z2^2*z3^2*z4^2 + t*z0*z1*z2*z3*z4*z5 + z0^2*z1^2*z5^2\
....: + z1^2*z3^2*z5^2 + z0^2*z4^2*z5^2 + z3^2*z4^2*z5^2
```


and the other two lines in the documentation that are too long, I'll give it a positive review.
