Nondegeneracy is a weaker version of smoothness, that is actually comparatively easy to implement (relative to the existing `is_smooth`). This branch implements smoothness.

To add some urgency to this, Edgar Costa, David Harvey, and I are working on computing zeta functions of nondegenerate hypersurfaces using p-adic cohomology, so we would find this routine very useful.

I don't really know how polytopes work in Sage, but it certainly looks like the code iterates over cones of all dimensions in the fan. Maybe there's a problem with the test for individual cones?

Here's a corrected test indicating the problem:

```
sage: X = toric_varieties.WP([1,4,2,3], names='z0 z1 z2 z3')
sage: X.inject_variables()
Defining z0, z1, z2, z3
sage: g0 =z1^3 + z2^6 +z3^4
sage: g = g0-2*z3^2*z0^6+z2*z0^10+z0^12
sage: hyp = X.subscheme([g])
sage: hyp.is_nondegenerate() # Should return False per Hamm
True

This looks good.  If you change:

```
sage: F = z0^2*z1^2*z2^2 + z1^2*z2^2*z3^2 + z0^2*z2^2*z4^2 + z2^2*z3^2*z4^2 +\
....: t*z0*z1*z2*z3*z4*z5 + z0^2*z1^2*z5^2 + z1^2*z3^2*z5^2 +\
....: z0^2*z4^2*z5^2 + z3^2*z4^2*z5^2
```

so that it wraps at 79 characters (even though here 72 is preferred)

```
sage: F = z0^2*z1^2*z2^2 + z1^2*z2^2*z3^2 + z0^2*z2^2*z4^2\
....: + z2^2*z3^2*z4^2 + t*z0*z1*z2*z3*z4*z5 + z0^2*z1^2*z5^2\
....: + z1^2*z3^2*z5^2 + z0^2*z4^2*z5^2 + z3^2*z4^2*z5^2
```

and the other two lines in the documentation that are too long, I'll give it a positive review.
