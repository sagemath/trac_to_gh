TODO:

--Resolve division by zero errors. See example when order is 3 and deformation parameter is 4. As in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.08900.pdf , pg. 31 where the rank 3 idempotents are listed, there is a (delta-4) in the denominator. Perhaps there are terms that cancel? B_3(4) is semisimple after all.

--Cite https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.08900.pdf 

--Code must be organized and optimized as per development standards
