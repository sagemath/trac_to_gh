# Issue 22393: Fix mutation of list in lcm

The current `LCM_list` will mutate the list when it contains `int`'s (and possibly Sage integers and `long`):

```
sage: L = [int(1), int(2)]
sage: lcm(L)
2
sage: type(L[0])
<type 'sage.rings.integer.Integer'>
```

New timings:

```
sage: L = [1 for _ in range(1000)]
sage: from sage.rings.integer import LCM_list
sage: %timeit [LCM_list(L) for _ in range(100)]
100 loops, best of 3: 2.25 ms per loop
sage: %timeit [LCM_list([1,2,3,4,5]) for _ in range(100)]
10000 loops, best of 3: 62.4 µs per loop
sage: %timeit [LCM_list([1,2]) for _ in range(100)]
10000 loops, best of 3: 36.1 µs per loop
sage: %timeit [LCM_list([2]) for _ in range(100)]
10000 loops, best of 3: 26.4 µs per loop
sage: %timeit [LCM_list([1]) for _ in range(100)]
10000 loops, best of 3: 26.5 µs per loop
sage: %timeit [LCM_list([]) for _ in range(100)]
100000 loops, best of 3: 13.3 µs per loop
sage: L.append(polygen(ZZ, 'x'))
sage: %timeit [lcm(L) for _ in range(100)]
100 loops, best of 3: 2.87 ms per loop
sage: L = [1 for _ in range(1000)]
sage: L.insert(0, polygen(ZZ, 'x'))
sage: %timeit [lcm(L) for _ in range(100)]
1 loop, best of 3: 363 ms per loop
```

Old timings:

```
sage: %timeit [LCM_list(L) for _ in range(100)]
100 loops, best of 3: 2.43 ms per loop
sage: %timeit [LCM_list([1,2,3,4,5]) for _ in range(100)]
10000 loops, best of 3: 56.5 µs per loop
sage: %timeit [LCM_list([1,2]) for _ in range(100)]
10000 loops, best of 3: 30.1 µs per loop
sage: %timeit [LCM_list([2]) for _ in range(100)]
10000 loops, best of 3: 24.5 µs per loop
sage: %timeit [LCM_list([1]) for _ in range(100)]
10000 loops, best of 3: 24.6 µs per loop
sage: %timeit [LCM_list([]) for _ in range(100)]
100000 loops, best of 3: 7.25 µs per loop
sage: L.append(polygen(ZZ, 'x'))
sage: %timeit [lcm(L) for _ in range(100)]
100 loops, best of 3: 2.87 ms per loop
sage: %timeit [lcm(L) for _ in range(100)]
1 loop, best of 3: 395 ms per loop
sage: L = [1 for _ in range(1000)]
sage: L.insert(0, polygen(ZZ, 'x'))
sage: %timeit [lcm(L) for _ in range(100)]
1 loop, best of 3: 394 ms per loop
```

So this does have a constant time slowdown when looping over (Sage) integer lists of about 6/100 µs or 60 ns per call. I think this is acceptable in comparison to how much we gain for a mixed list, fixing the bug at hand, and consolidating things into a single function.

First of all, do not put Python code inside `sig_on()`.

If `LCM_list` and `LCM_sequence` handle non-integers now, they should be moved outside of `src/sage/rings/integer.pyx`.

No need to deprecate `__LCM_sequence` since it was private already.

I'm going to be paranoid and leave in the deprecation of `__LCM_sequence` since someone might be using it for speed reasons (although I doubt it).

Minor changes, needs review.

If all tests pass, then positive review.

I make 2 very small corrections which were needed for the patchbot.
