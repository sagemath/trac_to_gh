There is likely an issue with `Matrix_gfpn_dense` or `meataxe`, which is likely caused by where things are in memory. This was first noticed by the following test in `rings/function_field/ideal.py`:

```
sage: K.<x> = FunctionField(GF(3^2)); R.<t> = K[]
sage: F.<y> = K.extension(t^3 + t^2 - x^4)
sage: Oinf = F.maximal_order_infinite()
sage: I = Oinf.ideal(1/y)
sage: I.factor()   # This will sometimes fail

You may also have to run `sage -b`. However, it doesn't always happen, which is the annoying part. Usually I just run `sage -tp` on the file a bunch of times and it happens with some reasonable frequency.
