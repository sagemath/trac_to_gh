# Issue 26204: Provide Python 3 Jupyter kernel as an optional package

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/26441

Keywords: Python3, Jupyter kernel

Currently Sage-the-distribution ships the following Jupyter kernels:

- Python 2
- SageMath

and one can optionally install additional kernels as optional packages
by running the following commands:

```
sage -i gap_jupyter         # install Jupyter kernel for GAP 4.8
sage -i pari_jupyter        # install Jupyter kernel for PARI/GP
sage -i r_jupyter           # install Jupyter kernel for R
sage -i singular_jupyter    # install Jupyter kernel for Singular
```


It would be nice to be able to easily add a Jupyter kernel for Python 3.

Or document how to easily do that on top of an existing installation of Sage.
