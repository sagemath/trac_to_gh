CC:  @davewittemorris

Is there any reason *not* to implement the following?

```
sage: prime_range(11, 100, 10)
[11, 31, 61, 71]
```
For this ticket, I have in mind the easy fix of running the same internal algorithm and retaining only the answers in the desired congruence class; that is, `prime_range(x, y, z)` would be equivalent to

```
p for p in prime_range(x, y) if (p-x)%z == 0
```
A more advanced (and more efficient) version would be to change the underlying algorithm.

Upon further reflection, maybe I should also be asking for this in the `primes` iterator.
