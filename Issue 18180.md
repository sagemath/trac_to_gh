- It is important to check tarballs during install, not only at download time, since there are use cases where tarballs are directly copied to the `upstream/` directory, e.g.: 
  - during the review process of a package upgrade,
  - when people share optional packages through external storage to save bandwidth.

- Silently adding your personal website to the list of mirrors is not healthy.

I dont see why those two regressions justify a blocker priority.

Tarballs are still checksummed with this branch, the only difference is that they are checksummed only once.

The fallback is the mirror for the buildbot; without it there is a window of a couple of hours where a new tarball is not yet available from the mirror network.

I was wondering whether you didn't know what you're doing or whether you just didn't care... (and I didn't want to further comment on the second commit *here* in hope you'd  [re]move it)

The **second commit**, which is completely unrelated and independent of the first one (I would have given positive review if you [re]moved the former from this ticket, where it simply doesn't belong), needlessly introduces new requirements for building Sage, even from the (self-contained) source tarball:

* a system-wide Python installation (with a working urllib)
* internet access (to github btw.)
* write access to the `$SAGE_DISTFILES` folder (cf. [ticket:15642#comment:85 my previous comment]) -- ok, the build **currently** doesn't fail otherwise (see below), but `sage-download-file` keeps downloading the mirror list for each and every package subject to installation, continually re-ranking the mirrors

and all of that **regardless** of whether any package actually needs to get downloaded.  (Thierry already mentioned silently incorporating such changes into a *blocker ticket*, and late in the release cycle, is even more dubious.)




That the build without a system-wide Python and/or without internet access **currently** still succeeds is just **due to a bug** in `sage-spkg`, namely that it doesn't at all check the exit code of `sage-download-file`.

So as is (with your second commit included), checksum errors wouldn't necessarily lead to (build) errors, hardly anybody would notice them.  *In case Python is available*, and your script detects the checksum of the tarball already present in `$SAGE_DISTFILES` doesn't match the one in `build/pkgs/...`, *it deletes the tarball* (provided write access is granted) *without asking* and tries to download it.  (With `$SAGE_DISTFILES` read-only, `sage-spkg` wouldn't notice checksum errors and simply proceed with the "wrong" tarball; same in case Python wasn't available -- silently no checksums would get verified, until Sage's Python has been built, but then we're back where `sage-dist-files` only *tries* to delete "wrong" tarballs...)

And the reason why its this late in the release cycle? Because I worked hard to make Sage use the mirror network and then you sat on your ass until the shit hit the fan. This should have been fixed 6 months ago.

the latter is not true, at least not for Europe: see
http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/M022641/1

and, unless some very bad admin screwup happens, this will be funded too:
