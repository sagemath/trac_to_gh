# Issue 17144: Remove outdated and currently useless mercurial package

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/17381

Original creator: tmonteil

Original creation time: 2014-11-22 21:56:49

Our Version of mercurial is 2.2.2 (more than 2 years old) while upstream is at 3.2.1. We are not using it in our workflow for a while and it is unlikely we will use it soon.

The aim of this ticket is to get rid of this package.

Could you also remove the mercurial reference from `src/doc/en/installation/introduction.rst` and `COPYING.txt`
