I think the mistake is that the caching is not implemented correctly.  (References below are to van der Hoeven's paper)

Sec. 2.2., pg. 484 says that `Series_Rep` has an attribute `n`, which says up to which degree the values in the cache are already correct.  However, *The order of φ is allowed to exceed n in order to anticipate future computations.*  Moreover, the coefficients `φ_0, . . . , φ_{k−1}` must be computed before computing `φ_k`.

In Sec. 4.2.1., pg. 502, the definition of of `DAC_Rep` does not specify `n` initially, so it is probably meant to be `0`.  However, in Sec. 4.2.3. the definition of `DAC_Rep` *does* specify `n := N/2`, which the current branch does not take into account.

The implementation of van der Hoeven's algorithm should really use the dense version of streams.  It probably makes sense to adapt the framework slightly.

Although the implementation is quite ugly in some details, I think we can learn enough for some decisions.

* the code (without any optimizations) begins to be faster for integer multiplication, if we want to compute all the first 270 or so coefficients of the product:

```
sage: from sage.data_structures.stream import (Stream_cauchy_mul, Stream_cauchy_mul_fast, Stream_function)
sage: f = Stream_function(lambda n: n, True, 0)
sage: g = Stream_function(lambda n: 1, True, 0)

sage: %time h1 = Stream_cauchy_mul_fast(f, g, threshold=2^5); l1 = [h1[i] for i in range(270)]
CPU times: user 40.7 ms, sys: 0 ns, total: 40.7 ms
Wall time: 40.7 ms
sage: %time h2 = Stream_cauchy_mul(f, g); l2 = [h2[i] for i in range(270)]
CPU times: user 43.1 ms, sys: 0 ns, total: 43.1 ms
Wall time: 43.1 ms

sage: %time h1 = Stream_cauchy_mul_fast(f, g, threshold=2^5); l1 = [h1[i] for i in range(2000)]
CPU times: user 712 ms, sys: 0 ns, total: 712 ms
Wall time: 712 ms
sage: %time h2 = Stream_cauchy_mul(f, g); l2 = [h2[i] for i in range(2000)]
CPU times: user 1.85 s, sys: 0 ns, total: 1.85 s
Wall time: 1.85 s
```

* if we are only interested in a single coefficient of the product, I don't think that we can come even close to the naive algorithm, and here the difference is, unfortunately, huge:

```
sage: %time h1 = Stream_cauchy_mul_fast(f, g, threshold=2^5); l1 = h1[1000]
CPU times: user 233 ms, sys: 0 ns, total: 233 ms
Wall time: 233 ms
sage: %time h2 = Stream_cauchy_mul(f, g); l2 = h2[1000]
CPU times: user 2.43 ms, sys: 0 ns, total: 2.43 ms
Wall time: 2.44 ms
```

* I am guessing that the most interesting application would be in the computation of the composition and the plethysm of power series.  There, we always compute contiguous segments of coefficients of products.  For example:

```
sage: from sage.data_structures.stream import Stream_function, Stream_cauchy_compose
sage: f = Stream_function(lambda n: n, True, 1)
sage: g = Stream_function(lambda n: n^2, True, 1)
sage: h = Stream_cauchy_compose(f, g)
sage: h[20]
289074264180
sage: [(len(x._cache), min(x._cache), max(x._cache)) for x in h._pos_powers[1:]]

 (15, 6, 20),
 (14, 7, 20),

```

sage: h1 = Stream_cauchy_mul_fast(f, g, threshold=2^5)
sage: l1 = [h1[i] for i in range(10)]
sage: len(h1._h._phi)
64
sage: h1._h._phi[:15]
[0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
sage: h1._cache
[0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45]
```

Somewhat orthogonal to the ticket: I think the decision whether a `Stream_XXX` class uses a dense or a sparse cache should not depend on the input streams.

For example, for `Stream_add` it is actually irrelevant whether the input streams `left` and `right` are dense or sparse.

For `Stream_zero` and `Stream_exact`, a dense cache never makes sense.

Thank you for looking at it :-) - and more generally, all the reviews!

The thing I am somewhat stuck with here is the class hierarchy.  Consider:

```python
class Stream_cauchy_mul_DAC():
    def __init__(self, left, right, phi, N, threshold):
        self._left = [left[k] for k in range(N)]
        self._right = [right[k] for k in range(N)]
        if phi is None:
            self._phi = [0]*(2*N)
            self._lo = None
            self._n = ZZ.zero()
        else:
            # TODO: the first N/2 entries of self._phi are already
            # computed, the computation of the next N/2 is initiated
            # by the next line.  Could / should this be done lazily?
            self._phi = [phi[k] for k in range(N)] + [0]*N
            self._lo = phi
            self._n = ZZ(N / 2)
```
Currently, this class does not inherit from anything.  However, it shares functionality with `Stream_inexact` by providing the cache.  Moreover, `self._phi[:n]` is actually the same as the cache, except that we produce (recursively) many copies of this, via `get_coefficient` below.

```python
class Stream_cauchy_mul_fast(Stream_binary):
    def __init__(self, left, right, threshold=2 ** 1):
        super().__init__(left, right, False)
        self._threshold = threshold
        self._h = Stream_cauchy_mul_DAC(left, right, None,
                                        self._threshold, self._threshold)

    def get_coefficient(self, n):
        if n >= self._threshold and is_power_of_two(n):
            self._h = Stream_cauchy_mul_DAC(self._left, self._right, self._h,
                                            2*n, self._threshold)
        return self._h[n]
```
In summary: to my eyes, this is a complete mess.  I think it would be more beautiful if the caching mechanism provided by `Stream_inexact` would be reused, possibly slightly generalized.

I do not understand the algorithm well enough to see how much of `self._phi` could actually be shared.  Ideally, I'd like a single cache (provided by `Stream_inexact` or `Stream_cauchy_mul`) which is manipulated by `Stream_cauchy_mul_DAC`.

`Stream_cauchy_mul_fast._h` has it's own state (i.e., `_phi`).  In fact, this is precisely the question: can the`_phi` attributes of the various `Stream_cauchy_mul_DAC` instances share memory?

(I should have documented: *DAC* is for *divide and conquer*)

It is certainly possible by passing the same list around and mutating it. However, each instance would just have to know which block is its responsibility, which creates a bit more complicated code structure and is likely harder to debug. How often are lists needed to be (re)constructed or are short-lived transient objects?
