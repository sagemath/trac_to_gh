Keywords: openblas cygwin

It was disabled in #22021 to work around some deadlocks that were occurring, and still further problems were reported in #23933.

But these issues appear to be fixed as of OpenBLAS 0.2.20 which Sage is now on.  It would be good if more people can test this though (especially on OSX).

This will also require a patch for Cygwin which I'll add to this shortly.
