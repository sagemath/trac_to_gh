# Issue 14120: Change file names in sage/rings/padics

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Assignee: roed

In the `sage/rings/padics` directory, too many files start with a superflous `padic`.  We should rename files with a consistent name scheme, but this task should wait until we move away from patch-based development so that we don't destroy the history.
