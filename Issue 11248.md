The Developer's Guide does not mention pre-releases, where to get them, where they are announced, how they should be used (e.g. to be used as bases for patches and for testing), or suggested workflows.

Inspired by http://ask.sagemath.org/question/567/on-what-versions-should-trac-patches-be-based

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/11420
