CC:  klee strogdon ​schilly mkoeppe

In #33601, the furo theme has been introduced for the documentation. Before we can make it the standard theme, the remaining issues need to be fixed:

- Reference manual index page and many sub-pagaes don't have a table of contents on the left ​https://516dfe85b21eafae4f042320e5dcf61ad14fe780--sagemath-tobias.netlify.app/reference/
- Index page is missing/not working ​https://516dfe85b21eafae4f042320e5dcf61ad14fe780--sagemath-tobias.netlify.app/
- sage logo in the side bar should link to the top of the Sage manuals

Feel free to add further issues that you find.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/33833

Would you pinpoint to a precise place from the documentation (following the Build Documentation badge)? I could not find one.

I think we should tweak Furo's styles only if the styling is an obvious defect (meaning "look bad to anyone") and is specifically about Sage. If the defect is a general one, the change request should go to the furo project itself.

Any page, really: For example, here

![](jJR0poB.png)

there's ample space around `EXAMPLES:` but the lines `rational_maps()` and `Return ...` are stuck together.

The official Furo examples look the same. I'm surprised noone else seems to find the spacing offensive.

Anyway, it's nitpicking, and indeed not our problem.

I see. The space between "EXAMPLES:" and "sage: ..." is the sum of the space around "EXAMPLES" and the space (margin + border) around "sage: ...". The reason that we see the added sum of the space seems that the background of "sage: ..." is hard to tell from the page background because of similarity of colors. It seems worse in dark mode than in light mode.

If I increase of the contrast between the backgrounds slightly, then it shows

Is this better?

> Anyway, it's nitpicking, and indeed not our problem.

As we have lots of example code, we may regard this as our problem.

Could you please upload pictures as attachments to the ticket, rather than linking to imgur (which shows a lot of ugly spam if you click on the image)?

Once you attached `jJR0poB.png` (there is a tab for this near the top part of the ticket page), you can do `![](jJR0poB.png)`, to the same effect of displaying the image inline.

We'd need to add the Python packages that are needed for building furo from source. But I'm not sure if that solves the problem completely because one of these dependencies is `nodeenv`, which suggests that the build process may also need to fetch Javascript packages.

An alternative direction would be to install furo from a wheel. We don't have a mechanism for that yet, but it would not be very hard to add.

This would avoid the complicated nodeenv business (which is only needed for from-source build of furo).
