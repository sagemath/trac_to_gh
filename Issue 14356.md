# Issue 14356: Implement hash for Gelfand-Tsetlin patterns

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/14560

Original creator: tscrim

Original creation time: 2013-05-09 16:33:06

Assignee: tscrim

CC:  sage-combinat chrisjamesberg stumpc5

Keywords: hash

Since they currently are not hashable:

```
sage: GT = GelfandTsetlinPattern([[3,1],[2]])
sage: GT
[[3, 1], [2]]
sage: hash(GT)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
...
TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'
```
