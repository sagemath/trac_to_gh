Hi William,

I just downloaded the sage version of the Stein-Watkins database of (a subset of) the elliptic curves of conductor < 10^8, because I need a supply of small curves with large rational torsion subgroups.  I looked in

  sage/local/share/stein_watkins/format.txt

and it says that the torsion subgroup is given as follows:

  torsion_subgroup - n or nx, where n means Z/nZ and nx means Z/2Z x Z/2nZ.

But in the actual tables, nx seems to indicate Z/2Z x Z/nZ (instead of 2nZ), because the values that appear are 2x, 4x, 6x, and 8x.

I hope all is well with you!  Thanks ---

This is fixed upstream ([http://modular.math.washington.edu/ecdb/format.txt](http://modular.math.washington.edu/ecdb/format.txt)), so we should add the right `format.txt` in the package.
