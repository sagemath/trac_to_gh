# Issue 33198: Move complex number powering test to correct location

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/33435

Powering of complex numbers was adapted in #11323
so that `float(5)^(0.5 + 4.1*i)` works.

A doctest was added to `_set_multiplicative_order`
instead of to `__pow__`.

We move the doctest to its correct location.

Doctest failure because the precision of `i` is different.
