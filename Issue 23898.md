CC:  simonking @nbruin @tscrim @fchapoton

1. Deprecate various arguments which should have been deprecated in #15367.

2. Use a tuple instead of a list to throw away. This is very slightly faster.

3. Use safe memory functions from cysignals instead of `PyMem` functions.

4. Split `__init__` into `__cinit__` and `__init__`.

5. Rename the `iteritems()` method to `items()`.

6. Introduce a new inline function `valid(ptr)` to replace the very common `ptr != NULL and ptr != dummy`.

7. Change type of `key_id` from `void*` to `PyObject*`. This avoids a lot of casts.

8. Use a custom class with ``@`cython.freelist` instead of a `PyCapsule` to wrap a `PyObject*`.

9. In `tp_clear`, only delete references to elements contained in the dict. Move deallocation of the data structure to `__dealloc__`.

10. Use random 31-bit multipliers (instead of `13` and `503`) in the hash function for `TripleDict`. This might give better mixing for large sizes (in any case, it can't hurt).

21. Rename `dummy` -> `deleted_key` to make it more clear what it means. Also, there was no reason that this was of type `bytes`. Now it is simply created by `object()`.

32. Change the logic of the `lookup()` methods a bit to make them easier to understand.

43. Generic code cleanup: PEP 8, `is` instead of `==` for pointers, ...

**Timings**:

All the changes above lead to a modest speed-up:

*`MonoDict` lookup*:

```
sage: from sage.structure.coerce_dict import MonoDict; D = MonoDict()
sage: L = [Integer(x) for x in range(1000)]
sage: for k in L: D[k] = k
sage: timeit('[D[k] for k in L]', repeat=20, number=20000)
```

Before: `20000 loops, best of 20: 72.7 µs per loop`

After: `20000 loops, best of 20: 64.5 µs per loop`

*`TripleDict` lookup*:

```
sage: from sage.structure.coerce_dict import TripleDict; D = TripleDict()
sage: L = [(None, None, Integer(x)) for x in range(1000)]
sage: for k in L: D[k] = None
sage: timeit('[D[k] for k in L]', repeat=20, number=20000)
```

Before: `20000 loops, best of 20: 97.3 µs per loop`

After: `20000 loops, best of 20: 87.3 µs per loop`

Can you also justify 8 a little too? I was only able to get a loose understanding from a quick search.

I am assuming 5 is for better consistency with Python3. Although I think that `items()` should have a least a little one-line description saying that it is an iterator (and not a list/view).

Trivial and I know you essentially simply moved it, but only 2 spaces instead of 4:

```
    sage: K.<t> = GF(2^55)
    sage: for i in range(50):
    ....:   a = K.random_element()
    ....:   E = EllipticCurve(j=a)
    ....:   P = E.random_point()
    ....:   Q = 2*P
```
Also with its new placement, it does not need an `#indirect doctest`.

Conceptually, these functions do not return anything. It is really analogous to a plain Python function which always returns `None`. The `int` return value exists only for a technical reason, namely exception handling.

I know, that was because I made a mistake in `__dealloc__`. I fixed that now, so we need to wait for new patchbot reports.

By the way, I realize that I'm making quite a lot of changes in this ticket. What started as a plan to fix the `iteritems()` calls ended up rewriting most of the `coerce_dict.pyx` file. However, most changes are pretty simple and do not change the functionality at all.

If there are certain changes that you cannot accept (either because you disagree or you don't understand), I can try to revert those.

Ah, I see. I couldn't quite tell if the patchbot reports were current or not.

> By the way, I realize that I'm making quite a lot of changes in this ticket. What started as a plan to fix the `iteritems()` calls ended up rewriting most of the `coerce_dict.pyx` file. However, most changes are pretty simple and do not change the functionality at all.


It's good to get things done.

> If there are certain changes that you cannot accept (either because you disagree or you don't understand), I can try to revert those.


I think I understand all of the changes and agree with them (or at least do not have any reason to disagree). So if the latest patchbots come back clean, then it will be a positive review.

I believe that the patchbot icon which is displayed on the Trac page (i.e. this page) only considers the up-to-date reports. As I'm writing this comment, I see a status of "pending", meaning that no patchbot has tested this latest version.

I've seen it as pending before when one of them is still working but another has finished and came back green. Although that might have been on a much older version of the patchbot.
