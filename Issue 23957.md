OK, hopefully that should do it. The new code does the following:
- implements weight 1 forms for Gamma1 and GammaH levels;
- hooks the new weight 1 code into the dimension-finding functions, so `Gamma1(N).dimension_cusp_forms(1)` or  `Gamma1(N).dimension_cusp_forms(1, eps)` will now call Schaeffer's algorithm rather than just returning NotImplementedError;
- does some incidental code cleanup, mostly stripping out ancient hand-rolled caching code and replacing it with the `cached_method` decorator.

It conflicted with something else merged in 8.2.beta2 so I rebased it. Please review!

(At time of writing, 4 patchbots have run the latest version, 3 of which have given a green light. The 4th has some doctest failures but they're just noise, caused by random failures unrelated to this ticket.)

I did not run full doctests for this. Feel free to set this to positive review if the tests do pass.

The patchbot reports no failures (other than random noise unrelated to this ticket), so I am setting the ticket to positive review. Many thanks for reviewing this long-dormant ticket!
