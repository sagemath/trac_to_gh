If I really have to rant, I'd ask for the trac ticket number to be included in SPKG.txt (between * and U).

It's just that such information can sometimes save so much time, not that I think it will really be the case here, but...
I've just wasted so much time understanding and reinventing the wheel at #13864...

> I'm against more red tape just for a trivial version bump. If you want to know the trac tickets where `pkg-x.y.z.spkg` was discussed then just use the search function.

Trac ticket numbers belong into `SPKG.txt` (i.e., an spkg's changelog) as well as into the commit messages (at least the last one, in case there are a couple of for a single patch level), while for spkgs the first is IMHO more important (even if Trac's search functions were smart...).

You may save a few seconds omitting it, at the expense of N other developers later wasting much more time searching.

On a lighter note, thanks to both of you for the spkg and review (both of which I made a mental note to do but never found the time for).
