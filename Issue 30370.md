Without the Jones database installed, I confirm the following works:

```
sage: from sage.features.databases import DatabaseJones                         
sage: DatabaseJones().is_present()                                              
FeatureTestResult("John Jones's tables of number fields", False)
sage: bool(_)                                                                   
False
sage: DatabaseJones().absolute_path()                                           
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
FeatureNotPresentError: John Jones's tables of number fields is not available.
'jones/jones.sobj' not found in any of ['/home/slabbe/GitBox/sage/local/share']
To install John Jones's tables of number fields you can try to run 'sage -i database_jones_numfield'.
```


After doing `sage -i database_jones_numfield`, I confirm the following works:

```
sage: from sage.features.databases import DatabaseJones                         
sage: DatabaseJones().is_present()                                              
FeatureTestResult("John Jones's tables of number fields", True)
sage: DatabaseJones().absolute_path()                                           
'/home/slabbe/GitBox/sage/local/share/jones/jones.sobj'
```

Without lrslib installed, I confirm the following works (error is properly raised):


```
sage: p1 = matrix([[-7, -5, 5],
....:              [5, 5, 3],
....:              [1, -6, 1]])
sage: p2 = matrix([[-9, 7, 9],
....:              [6, -2, -3],
....:              [-4, 6, -10]])
sage: biggame = NormalFormGame([p1, p2])
sage: biggame._solve_lrs()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'lrsnash'
...
During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:
...
FeatureNotPresentError: lrslib is not available.
Calling lrsnash failed with [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'lrsnash'
To install lrslib you can try to run 'sage -i lrslib'.
Further installation instructions might be available at http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~avis/C/lrs.html.
```


And then, I confirm this works as suggested by the error message:


```
sage: !sage -i lrslib  
...
sage: biggame._solve_lrs()                                                      
[[(0, 1, 0), (1, 0, 0)],
 [(1/3, 2/3, 0), (0, 1/6, 5/6)],
 [(1/3, 2/3, 0), (1/7, 0, 6/7)],
 [(1, 0, 0), (0, 0, 1)]]
```

Finally, I confirm the new behavior for `PackageNotFoundError`:

```
sage: from sage.misc.package import PackageNotFoundError                        
sage: raise PackageNotFoundError("my_package")                                  
...
DeprecationWarning: Instead of raising PackageNotFoundError, raise sage.features.FeatureNotPresentError
See https://trac.sagemath.org/30607 for details.
...
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
PackageNotFoundError: the package 'my_package' was not found. You can install it by running 'sage -i my_package' in a shell
```

`sage -tp --optional=sage,optional,external src/sage/databases/jones.py src/sage/features/__init__.py src/sage/features/databases.py src/sage/game_theory/normal_form_game.py src/sage/misc/package.py --show-skipped` works ok (except one issue already fixed in #30632).

To me it is a positive review. Let's wait for the patchbot to see if everything is green.

I think the pyflakes warning is a flake

Sorry for the delay in follow-up, I was busy with other TODOs this week.
