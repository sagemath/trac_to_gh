The following should not raise an error, but coerce f and h to a
common parent and then check whether they are polynomials.

```
sage: R.<u> = QQ[]
sage: HyperellipticCurve(-12, u^4 + 7)
...
TypeError: Arguments f (=-12) and h (= u^4 + 7) must be polynomials and f must be non-zero
```

Works for me. Weird the patchbot has so many failures in sagedev, though.
