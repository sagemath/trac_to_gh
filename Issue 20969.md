Keywords: palp subprocess

This is to fix the tests in `sage.geometry.polyhedron.palp_database`, which were irregularly failing on Cygwin.  I don't think there's really anything Cygwin-specific about the issue, actually.  It just tends to exhibit itself on Cygwin because process shutdown takes longer, giving a wider window for the race condition described below.

This method had some code to force the PALP process to shut down at the end of iteration, rather than waiting for it to complete naturally.   However, this was failing randomly, at least on Windows, due to a race condition where the process could end between calling `poll()` and calling `terminate()` (and/or `kill()`)--the `terminate()` call would in turn cause an `OSError` ("No such process").

The newly added `terminate()` context manager does effectively the same thing as the old code, but also makes sure to close any streams, and handles the aforementioned race condition better.

Since the `terminate()` context manager is fairly generic, there is probably a better long-term home for it than here.

You need to use a `r"""` string to make the `\n` literal instead of an actual newline.
