# Issue 28594: Better document how SPKGs are built and installed and the DESTDIR concept

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28831

Original creator: embray

Original creation time: 2019-12-02 13:56:07

#28721 added more documentation to the sage-dist-helpers functions used in `spkg-build` or `spkg-install` scripts.  But as evidenced by some discussion on that ticket, as well as on the mailing list, there is still some confusion about how SPKGs are built/installed, how the file manifests are generated, and what DESTDIR/staged installations are, and why the are used.
