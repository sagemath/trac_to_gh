This works with Python 2.

```

The following reveals a relevant difference. This is with Python 2:

```
sage: F=CombinatorialFreeModule(ZZ,ZZ)
sage: FF=tensor((F,F))
sage: I=FF.basis().keys()
sage: type(I)
<class 'sage.combinat.combinat.MapCombinatorialClass'>
sage: I.__hash__
<method-wrapper '__hash__' of MapCombinatorialClass object at 0x7f58b5a22338>
```

With Python 3 the `I.__hash__` is None.

Ok, this seems to work and with Python 2 the hashes seem to be the same as before. The implementation of `__eq__` calls `repr()` instead of `str()` though, so ideally the same should be done in the hash function.

Thanks for looking into this!  I have now added a test for the original failure in `free_modules.py` and also changed the definition of `__hash__` to use `repr` rather than `str`.
