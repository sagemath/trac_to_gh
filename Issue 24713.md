I wanted to look at polynomials with coefficients in an unusual ring, specifically rings ZMod(n) * Zmod(n*k) for various n and k.  Sage is not cooperating:

```
sage: R = Zmod(2).cartesian_product(Zmod(2))
sage: PolynomialRing(R,'x')
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
...
TypeError: 'int' object is not iterable
```


I think this happens because some coercions do not work:

```
sage: R(0)
```

gets an error with pretty much the same traceback.


Combining things the other way also fails:

```
sage: S = ZZ['s']; S
Univariate Polynomial Ring in s over Integer Ring
sage: S.cartesian_product(S)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
AttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)
...
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute '_is_category_initialized'
```

I believe everything that is a proper ring (i.e., not an algebra) currently in Sage has an explicit coercion map from the integers. So the coercion framework steps in before it gets to `_element_constructor_` for things like `0` or `1`. However, for this more generic construction, we need to add something. So I see two ways forward:

1. A custom class for Cartesian products of rings.
2. A generic coercion from the integers to rings setup by the category similar to what is done for `UnitalAlgebras`.

Personally, I am more in favor of 2 as it has a more generic flavor from the initial object `ZZ`.

Now the second problem is related in that the Cartesian products do not try and set its base ring, but the `UnitalAlgebras` code (rightly) assumes it has been set. This one is a bit more tricky as we have to make sure the base rings match up. However, this can be fixed by adding a `def cartesian_product` method to `MagmaticAlgebras.ParentMethods` to override the generic one provided from the sets category that passes along the base ring. `CartesianProduct` will also need to be expanded to take a `base_ring` argument.

Thoughts?
