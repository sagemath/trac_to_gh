On 2012-09-27 John Cremona published an update of his database covering conductors up to 280000. The optional spkg database_cremona_ellcurve needs updating accordingly.

I'll mark this as Needs Review when I have finished my own testing.

There's one doctest failure after the new db is installed, in heegner.py where a curve is used which has conductor 100001.  This was also a problem / feature with the previous version of the large database.  I intended to make a patch with a different example, but that it not easy since the example chosen was done so to illustrate a particular feature.  One could easily change that doctest into one which passes with & without the optional db installed, but it would be less easy to do so in a way which illustrates the same point.

I can't see any reason that this shouldn't get a positive review, unless the reviewer is supposed to recompute all the data to make sure that Cremona isn't pulling a fast one on us. (And I was annoyed recently when I realized that the current optional spkg is incomplete, which is a good reason for giving this a positive review.)

That's a great idea!  And of course you are not allowed to use any of eclib to do so.  Then we could be really confident in the data.

Thanks.  I checked my release notes (at http://homepages.warwick.ac.uk/staff/J.E.Cremona/ftp/data/release_notes.txt) and there have been no corrections since October which affect the spkg.

Thank you!  I am not planning any further expansion of the database in the near future.
