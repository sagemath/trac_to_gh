That's a great idea!  And of course you are not allowed to use any of eclib to do so.  Then we could be really confident in the data.

 (And I was annoyed recently when I realized that the current optional spkg is incomplete, which is a good reason for giving this a positive review.)

Thanks.  I checked my release notes (at http://homepages.warwick.ac.uk/staff/J.E.Cremona/ftp/data/release_notes.txt) and there have been no corrections since October which affect the spkg.
