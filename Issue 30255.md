We provide python wrapper methods to shorten the doctests.

Previously those wrapper methods were part of the doctests.

Before this ticket:

```
sage -t --long --warn-long 87.4 --random-seed=0 src/sage/geometry/polyhedron/combinatorial_polyhedron/conversions.pyx
    [61 tests, 17.05 s]
```

With this thicket

```
sage -t --long --warn-long 87.4 --random-seed=0 src/sage/geometry/polyhedron/combinatorial_polyhedron/conversions.pyx
    [66 tests, 0.34 s]
```

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/30492
