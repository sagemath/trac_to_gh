# Issue 22629: Cygwin spkg-check meta-ticket

I'm running the `spkg-check` scripts for each standard package (I haven't normally built with `SAGE_CHECK=yes`).  It could reveal some bugs that are not caught by Sage's test suite, but that could nevertheless affect Sage.

For now I will just list packages whose tests are failing for me; I will open separate tickets for individual packages that look worth investigating (for example, the failures in cysignals are worth looking into; whereas the failing tests for curl maybe not so much as it is not a direct dependency of Sage...)

* curl
* cysignals
* cython

zeromq is also failing.  I don't know if it passed earlier but IIRC it did not , and was just left off this ticket by mistake.
