This ticket is "inspired" by [this ask.sagemath question](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/2760/products-in-a-free-algebra).

1. First, there should be an easy way to get the variables out of an expression in FreeAlgebra. Compare with the output of polynomial ring.

```
sage: F.<x,y>=FreeAlgebra(ZZ)  
sage: g=4+3*x^7*y^10*x^13
sage: g.variables()            # <------------   Need this
sage: h=g._FreeAlgebraElement__monomial_coefficients # This is what we need to do currently
sage: h.items()[1][0]._element_list     # and do more post processing on the output.
[(0, 7), (1, 10), (0, 13)]

# Compare with polynomial ring
sage: F.<x,y> = PolynomialRing(ZZ)
sage: g=4+3*x^7*y^10*x^13
sage: g.variables()
(x, y)
sage: g=4+3*x^7
sage: g.variables()
(x,)
```

2. The element `x<sup>7*y</sup>10*x^13` does not belong to the `FreeAlgebra` class once it is extracted from the expression. It belongs to `FreeMonoid`. I think the parent of it should be the same even after we extract it.

```
sage: F.<x,y>=FreeAlgebra(ZZ)  
sage: g=4+3*x^7*y^10*x^13
sage: h=g._FreeAlgebraElement__monomial_coefficients
sage: h
{1: 4, x^7*y^10*x^13: 3}
sage: hh = h.items()[1][0]; hh
x^7*y^10*x^13
sage: hh.parent()
Free monoid on 2 generators (x, y)
```

```
sage: F.<x,y> = FreeAlgebra(ZZ)
sage: g = x^5 * y^4 + 3
sage: for m in g:
....:     print m

(3, 1)

Regarding point 1: Accessing underscore methods is bound to make your life hard: the underscore marks that these are methods/attributes for internal use. The interface is via iteration and using that one can easily accomplish the task:

```
sage: tuple({n[0] for m in g for n in m[1]})
(y, x)
```

(i.e., iterate over the terms making up the algebra element, extract the monomial and iterate over that to extract the variables that occur in them).

Whether this needs to be wrapped in a method: The operation isn't very natural: The parent will naturally tell you which variables CAN occur in in algebra elements. Are the ones that don't have all those variables really so special that there needs to be a method to query about that?

For polynomials, the same argument holds, but there it was probably added because some beginners will tend to think of polynomials in terms of SR, where the variables occurring is really a property of the expression and not really of SR.

Concerning point 2: The nested operation above shows why it's natural to return monomials NOT as elements of the algebra: iterating over an algebra element gives the pairs, iterating over a monomial gives variable-exponent pairs. The separation actually provides easier access to the underlying data.

For normal polynomial rings this is probably avoided for efficiency reasons, but you quickly notice that it's a little inconvenient: you end up testing quite a bit whether given polynomials are actually monomials, where doing this via a type check would often in principle be quite doable.

I am surprised. I have two questions

1. Why does this patch affect `categories/rings.py`?
2. Can you be more specific with `Exception`? In which case did you run into the `Exception`? `AttributeError`? Can you include it in a doctest?

It's just a doctest and it's because I swapped the order when iterating over the objects (i.e., it became index, coefficient whereas before it was coefficient, index).

> 2. Can you be more specific with `Exception`? In which case did you run into the `Exception`? `AttributeError`? Can you include it in a doctest?

There's a doctest in `categories/commutative_ring_ideals.py` which tries to pass off (incorrectly) `Partitions(4)` as a commutative ring, but the `is_Algebra` fails with a `TypeError`. However, it could also fail with other errors and I didn't want the `is_Algebra` to error out for similar reasoning to a `__contains__()` check. We can add additional doctests to `is_Algebra` but I think we're already covered by other parts of the library.

This is mostly for my records. Here's the list I got that were "bad" errors:

```
sage -t rings/quotient_ring.py  # 8 doctests failed
sage -t rings/ring.pyx  # 3 doctests failed
sage -t structure/sage_object.pyx  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t structure/factorization.py  # 1 doctest failed
```

The pickling one is going to be the most fun to deal with.

These were from dictionary orderings (likely from hash values):

```
sage -t libs/singular/groebner_strategy.pyx  # 2 doctests failed
sage -t rings/polynomial/plural.pyx  # 5 doctests failed
sage -t rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_ideal.py  # 13 doctests failed
```


One I don't think is related:

```
sage -t doctest/test.py  # 1 doctest failed
```

These seem to be maxima related (i.e. local to my setup so I'm going to ignore them):

```
sage -t tests/french_book/integration_doctest.py  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t calculus/desolvers.py  # 8 doctests failed
sage -t /home/travis/sage/src/doc/en/prep/Quickstarts/Differential-Equations.rst  # 2 doctests failed
sage -t /home/travis/sage/src/doc/en/constructions/calculus.rst  # 4 doctests failed
