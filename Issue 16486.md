Sorry to be cryptic. I've writted a description.
I think that these tools can be useful for others people (mainly researcher on beta-expansion, rauzy fractals, quasi-cristals etc...)

> Also, I am having a hard time finding any reference to these objects other than in your own papers.  But I do find other references to beta-adic which seem to mean something else (though with "adic" of course they are somehow related). 

There are several names for that : beta-adic, beta-expansions, non-standard numeration systems, etc...
I don't know what is the better name for that, so I choosed the name I used (in french) in my article.

> I don't know what our policy is on that; Purple Sage used to exist for that context but I think it may be defunct.

I did'nt know Purple Sage. If it was not defunct, you're right, it would be more appropriate. But the last version has the date oct-2010...

> Don't take this as criticism, but rather request for clarification; these files are large enough that it would be helpful to know that others will be interested in using them; especially if the name may be fluid it would be unfortunate to lock ourselves in a name, though that may be unavoidable.

As I explain now in the description, I plan to cut this ticket into smaller ones that could be inclued in sage. I would like to improve Automaton first (because I need it), then add BetaAdicMonoid (maybe I'll change the name if I find a better one) and then modify WordMorphism to use BetaAdicMonoid.

> (I suppose this all applies to #15883 as well, though less so.)
The ticket #15883 is an old copy of this ticket that didn't worked with sage-6.2.
I should combine the two tickets, but I don't know how to do it.
