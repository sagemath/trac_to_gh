# Issue 28986: Pickle cached value of volume and f-vector

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29223

Keywords: polyhedron, pickling, volume, f_vector

Volume and f-vector of polyhedra can be hard to compute, but are easy to store.

So we should pickle those values, e.g.


```diff
+    @cached_method(do_pickle=True)
-    @cached_method
     def f_vector(self):
```

It looks good to me.
Is there a reason why you did not do the same for functions of CombinatorialPolyhedron?

Yes, `CombinatorialPolyhedron` doesn't exactly pickle. It just reduces, i.e. save enough data to initialize the object again. At some point one could think about a better way of pickling, of course.
