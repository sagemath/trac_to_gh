As with pari (#12315), on OS X Lion, if you set SAGE_CHECK=yes and build gsl, some tests fail.  If we set `SAGE_DEBUG=yes`, which uses `-O0` instead of `-O2` as a compiler flag, then self tests all pass.  Modifying the spkg to use `-O1` instead of `-O2` also makes all tests pass.  So a possible fix for spkg-install:

```diff

Doing

```

export GCC
```

in spkg-install fixes this.  (See #12315 for a similar fix for Pari.)

Since gcc-4.2 is not present by default, let's use clang instead.  Self-tests pass for me with the updated spkg.
