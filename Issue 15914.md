Following creates a segfault:

```
from sage.matroids.advanced import *
M = BasisMatroid(matroids.named_matroids.Vamos())
len(M.independent_r_sets(9))
```

This is because of wrong user input (vamos matroid has only 8 elements, so there is no independent set of size bigger than 8). This ticket is to add sanity checks on user input to filter out such cases and raise appropriate exceptions.

This should do it. 

I corrected independent_r_sets and also dependent_r_sets (and then I corrected myself, since the latter needed a slightly different treatment). 

As far as I can see, flats(r) is already fool-proof, and there are no other user-facing methods that take parameters.

I made myself 'author' since I am the author of the patch. Or does that field refer to the author of the ticket? I would think not, since there are also `owner` and `reported by` fields.
