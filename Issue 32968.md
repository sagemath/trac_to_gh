From Marc Culler:

`prompt_toolbox` with versions >= 3.0.0 completely breaks Tk graphics.  Symptoms include very high CPU usage when doing essentially nothing as well as crashes.  The older `prompt_toolbox` 2.0.10 works fine.  The change from 2.0.10 to 3.0.0 was a major rewrite which replaced the custom event loops that they had written with `asyncio`.

The current version of `IPython` that ships with Sage is perfectly happy using `prompt_toolbox` 2.0.10.  We know of no downside to reverting to that version.  The upside is that Tk works normally, which is very important to SnapPy

If 2.0.10 works fine, we should at least relax the version constraint in `build/pkgs/prompt_toolkit/install-requires.txt`.
