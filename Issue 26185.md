Looks good to me. I am going to open another ticket for work on the master reference file, moving more references there. Docbuilding with Python 3 seem to have a harder time finding references if they are scattered in different files, so collecting more references (especially from `sage/combinat`) will help.

This should be re-targeted for 8.5.
