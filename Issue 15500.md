# Issue 15500: Problem in an_padic

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: wuthrich

Original creation time: 2014-01-26 14:54:09

The following produces a error

```
E = EllipticCurve([-100,0])
s = E.sha()
s.an_padic(13)
```

Changing keywords from "" to "padic l-functions".

I fixed a few Error syntaxes, too

Would it be possible to solve the problem instead by fixing the `series` method of `pAdicLSeriesOrdinary`, and similarly of `pAdicLSeriesSupersingular`, rather than the call to it?  I mean something like this:

```diff
diff --git a/src/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/padic_lseries.py b/src/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/padic_lseries.py
index c964189..ced0472 100644
--- a/src/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/padic_lseries.py
+++ b/src/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/padic_lseries.py
`@``@` -882,8 +882,11 `@``@` class pAdicLseriesOrdinary(pAdicLseries):
             print 'Warning : For p=2 the normalization might not be correct !'
         #verbose("computing L-series for p=%s, n=%s, and prec=%s"%(p,n,prec))
 
-        bounds = self._prec_bounds(n,prec)
-        padic_prec = max(bounds[1:]) + 5
+        if prec <= 1:
+            padic_prec = 5
+        else:
+            bounds = self._prec_bounds(n, prec)
+            padic_prec = max(bounds[1:]) + 5
         verbose("using p-adic precision of %s"%padic_prec)
 
         res_series_prec = min(p**(n-1), prec)
```

This would also make the following work:

```
sage: Et=EllipticCurve([-1,0])
sage: lp=Et.padic_lseries(13)
sage: lp.series(3, prec=1)
6 + 12*13 + O(13^3) + O(T)
```

Hmmm. That would work as well indeed. However I have a slight preference for my solution, because I think a) giving an insufficient precision should raise an error rather than setting it arbitrarily to 5 and b) the call from sha `an_padic` should do the right thing independently of what `padic_lseries` would do with a meaningless argument. 

But if you see a reason for doing a) your way, I have nothing against changing it.

I don't know enough about _p_-adic _L_-series, but why exactly is `prec=1` a meaningless argument?  It should give you precisely enough information to get the 0-th coefficient.  (If I understand correctly, `prec` is not the _p_-adic precision, but the power series precision; it does influence the _p_-adic working precision.)  Am I correct that it would make sense for `series()` to return the same result for `prec=1` as for `prec=2` but with the series truncated to `O(T^1)`?

Setting `padic_prec=5` in the case `prec=1`, as in my above comment, is probably indeed a mistake; it seemed a reasonable extrapolation from the formula `padic_prec = max(bounds[1:]) + 5` used for `prec >= 2`.

The constant term of the p-adic L-function is a multiple of m(0)=L(E,1)/Omega where m is the modular symbol attached to E. Whatever n is, the constant term is always correct (up to the precision with which alpha was computed). So in some sense no-one should want to compute the constant term with a p-adic L-function as one can do it without.

But I think prec=1 could be a acceptable entry and then we should return just the constant term (as a powerseries with O(T) ) but avoiding all summation computations. Then I can go back to sha and leave it as it was. That would be a better solution, not only fixing the bug, but also improving the code.

I will try to do this over the next days.

Looks good, just one more small thing: in the case where _E_ is supersingular at _p_, `prec=1` and `eta != 0`, you have the line

```
padic_prec = [This is the Trac macro *20,20* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#20,20-macro)
```

(the `padic_prec` is simply 20 in the analogous ordinary case.)
Is this correct?  It seems to cause errors of the following kind:

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve("17a1")
sage: L = E.padic_lseries(3)
sage: L.series(4,prec=1,eta=1)
...
TypeError: unable to coerce <type 'list'> to an integer
```

Absolutely right. I thought I checked all cases, but I did not. Sloppy of my part. Thanks for pointing this out.

OK, I'm happy now and all tests pass.
