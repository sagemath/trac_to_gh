But if you see a reason for doing a) your way, I have nothing against changing it.

Looks good, just one more small thing: in the case where *E* is supersingular at *p*, `prec=1` and `eta != 0`, you have the line

```
padic_prec = [[20,20]]
```
(the `padic_prec` is simply 20 in the analogous ordinary case.)
Is this correct?  It seems to cause errors of the following kind:

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve("17a1")
sage: L = E.padic_lseries(3)
sage: L.series(4,prec=1,eta=1)
...
TypeError: unable to coerce <type 'list'> to an integer
