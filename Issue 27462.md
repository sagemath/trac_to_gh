Keywords: Anaconda

This ticket is to detect the presence of Anaconda when building or
starting Sage, and output a helpful warning or error message in
cases where it is likely to cause, or when it causes, trouble.

Many support requests come from the failure of Sage to build or
to run in the presence of Anaconda.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27699

Nice, but does it always do the job? E.g. I noticed that I must comment out everything in the following block inserted by conda into my `.bashrc`:

```
# >>> conda initialize >>>
# !! Contents within this block are managed by 'conda init' !!
__conda_setup="$('/home/scratch2/dimpase/miniconda3/bin/conda' 'shell.bash' 'hook' 2> /dev/null)"
 if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    eval "$__conda_setup"

You could do,


```

```


to make it not initialize by default.

FWIW, I successfully built sage from scratch after `conda deactivate`. But this is with a miniconda installation with a clean `base` environment.

I'll test again on Linux with a dirty `base` environment that has lots of `bin/*-config` executables - this was the problem in #27941.

Well, I can imagine a Sage test invoking an interactive shell, and then, well, all the bets are off. Can we test that Conda has `auto_activate_base=false` - if we are outside conda?

If there is such a bug in the testsuite, we'll fix it. 

This really isn't specific to conda. Users' interactive shell configuration in  ~/.bashrc could also define all kinds of incompatible `alias`es or print arbitrary output etc. that could confuse a doctest.

> Can we test that Conda has `auto_activate_base=false` - if we are outside conda?

I don't know what you mean by that.

> As well, the docs ought to mention comment:23 (atm they only tell how to use conda, but they also ought to tell how not to)

The added docs already mention `conda deactivate`. And that is sufficient. 

Telling the user that they have to disable conda by editing their init scripts, or uninstall conda, or change their conda configuration --- all of this is going in the wrong direction for Sage.
