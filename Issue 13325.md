# Issue 13325: Sage 5.3 Binary not working after ./sage -b

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/13529

Original creator: startakovsky

Assignee: tbd

Keywords: sage -b

Hello, I am just getting started developing in Sage.  I followed the directions here on my Linux Machine:

http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/coding_in_python.html#creating-a-new-directory

but the sage command prompt wasn't recognizing the *from sage.<package-name>.all import ** command.

After restarting, the issue wasn't fixed.  So I ran *./sage -b *based on the preceding subsection of the link above.

Now I can't even run sage.

Why would this occur?  What can be done to fix this problem?

Attached is the output from the *./sage -b *DIRECTLY FOLLOWED by output when I try to run *./sage* now.

This is my first programming experience.  Thank you.

What happens if you download Sage, *don't run ./sage -b* and simply run *./sage*?

Do you have a C compiler?  If you want to develop Sage, you need to install `gcc`.

Hi, I don't know whether I had a C compiler, and if I didn't and it's a prerequisite, then maybe that should be noted?

To answer the other question, Sage worked perfectly as a prebuilt binary.  Then I tried to add a package and rebuild and got the error mentioned here.  After building from source however, I no longer have this problem and sage builds perfectly and quickly with any modification I have been making to the source.  So this ticket is more around the binary than anything else.

Replying to [comment:3 startakovsky]:

It is indeed a prerequisite for _developing_ Sage.

So it is a prerequisite for developing Sage, but not a prerequisite for running Sage and therefore is not and should not come with the Sage Binary.  Is that correct and should we then close this ticket?

In any case, it is sort-of duplicate of #11162.

But even _without_ a C compiler, running `./sage -b` should not destroy Sage.  So I think that's still a bug.
