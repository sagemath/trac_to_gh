CC:  simonking jakobkroeker @slel

Consider two polynomials f,g in a ring define using a local ordering, e.g.,

R.<x,y>=PolynomialRing(QQ,order='neglex')

If the leading monomial of g is 1 then f/g will produces a wrong result, namely f divided by the independent coefficient of g. Note that in that case g.is_unit() yields True, since for Singular R is not Q[x,y] but the ordering localization (i.e., one can divide by the polynomials whose leading monomial is 1).

PS: It is my first ticket, I apologize for the mistakes.

Note that this is the code of "_div_" for multivariate polynomial rings:

```
        cdef poly *p
        cdef MPolynomial_libsingular right = <MPolynomial_libsingular>right_ringelement
        cdef bint is_field = left._parent._base.is_field()

                return new_MP(left._parent, p)
            else:
                return left.change_ring(left.base_ring().fraction_field())/right_ringelement
        else:

```

So, it is tested with the libsingular function !p_IsConstant whether the divisor is constant, hence, we can divide by the leading coefficient. I bet !p_IsConstant assumes a positive ordering and just tests whether the leading monomial is of degree zero.

For reference, there is some documentation about formatting on the developer guide, see http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#python-code-style

In particular, you can add spacing between `QQ,` and `order="neglex"`, and perhaps between the `+` (though the current code is already readable).

About the `::`, just to make things clearer than our previous discussion:


```
blah

::

```


it the secure way to write `blah` followed by a block of code,



```
blah ::

```


is equivalent to the previous one.

However,


```
blah::

```


is equivalent to


```
blah:

::

```


which is therefore equivalent to:


```
blah: ::

```


[My personal preference goes to first and third, but it is up to you]

What was wrong in the commit 989c4fc2850c173ea9034f22c7742c614840a770 ([comment:10 comment 10]) was


```
Ensure that :trac:`17638` is fixed.::
```


wich will print both a dot and a column, but i fear that now you removed both, while it might be good to keep a column.
