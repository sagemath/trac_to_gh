In this ticket we add support for `./configure --with-python=no`, which would suppress making any Python venv and suppress building any Python packages.

This is for users who prefer to install Python packages into their own virtual environments using standard Python tools.

To disable building Python packages, the make targets would be replaced by dummy targets in the same way as it is done for packages found by spkg-configure.

In addition, this could go through #30383 ("configure --disable-SPKG" for standard packages) so that `configure` already shows that the build is disabled for Python packages.
