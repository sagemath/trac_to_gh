Replying to [comment:3 vbraun]:
> Merge conflict

Since this is fixing doctest related to an optional package, it would be nice to get it merged in the next beta...

It is supposed to have a conflict with Volker's private branch. But looking at the file there:

https://github.com/vbraun/sage/commits/develop/src/sage/graphs/graph_generators.py

I really do not see how there could be any conflict. This file was last modified 3 weeks ago.
