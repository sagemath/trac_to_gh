We should provide a wrapper for `gap.AllGroups` feature to iterate through all groups of given order.

This actually needs more than what I thought. The output of `AllGroups` in GAP is not uniform... it can be:
 - a pc group if it is solvable (testable from GAP with `IsPcGroup`)
 - a permutation group otherwise (testable from GAP with `IsPermGroup`)
