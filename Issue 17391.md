    "body": "This actually needs more than what I thought. The output of `AllGroups` in GAP is not uniform... it can be:\n- a pc group if it is solvable (testable from GAP with `IsPcGroup`)\n- a permutation group otherwise (testable from GAP with `IsPermGroup`)",

This actually needs more than what I thought. The output of `AllGroups` in GAP is not uniform... it can be:
- a pc group if it is solvable (testable from GAP with `IsPcGroup`)
- a permutation group otherwise (testable from GAP with `IsPermGroup`)
