# Issue 19145: move elliptic_curve_congruence graph from graphs to elliptic_curves

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: cremona

Original creation time: 2015-10-09 14:03:39

CC:  ncohen

Keywords: elliptic curve congruence graph

From sage-devel:

```
It is possible to build a graph with the following syntax:

    Graph(something, format="elliptic_curve_congruence")
```

but it would be more sensible to move the relevant block of 30 lines of code into the elliptic curves module.

Here is a first version anyway -- the old code was very broken, and I have not tested that this displays the correct graph, but at least it works.  Right now I am working from a remote desktop so cannot easily display graphs; when I can, I will test it further.

Hello John,

The ticket #19381 has been reviewed much faster than I expected, so tell me when you are done with this ticket and I will rebase it on top of it. Should be totally straightforward `:-)`

I am done with it.  Can you test it by running the code in the doctest and checking that the graph does display?  We can come back and improve it later.

Well, the doctests do pass and I can plot the graph, no problem. Except that I do not know what it means `^^;`

I'll ask William to take a look as I suspect he had something to do with the original (if not the code ;))

Surprisingly there is no conflict with #19381 `:-)`

Well, if Volker merges the branch without this last commit nobody will suffer because of it. It should work, however. I'm setting this to `positive_review` again, hoping there's nothing wrong with that.
