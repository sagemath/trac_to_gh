CC:  ncohen

Keywords: elliptic curve congruence graph

From sage-devel:

```
It is possible to build a graph with the following syntax:

    Graph(something, format="elliptic_curve_congruence")
```

but it would be more sensible to move the relevant block of 30 lines of code into the elliptic curves module.

Here is a first version anyway -- the old code was very broken, and I have not tested that this displays the correct graph, but at least it works.  Right now I am working from a remote desktop so cannot easily display graphs; when I can, I will test it further.

Hello John,

The ticket #19381 has been reviewed much faster than I expected, so tell me when you are done with this ticket and I will rebase it on top of it. Should be totally straightforward `:-)`

I am done with it.  Can you test it by running the code in the doctest and checking that the graph does display?  We can come back and improve it later.
