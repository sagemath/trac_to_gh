`@`chapoton: oops, sorry, I should have written that explicitely.  Yes, the fixes should be in the upcoming release.

From the release notes:

- Added free noncommutative field.
- Added factorization in free algebra.

Is either of this, or anything else in FriCAS (there are lots of features, I know), particularly interesting to wrap and expose?

I am not sure, but I do know that the addition of any wrappers are better left to followup tickets. LGTM.
