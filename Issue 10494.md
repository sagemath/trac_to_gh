# Issue 10494: DeBruijn digraph fixes

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Assignee: jason, ncohen, rlm

This patch fixes some problems with the DeBruijn digraph. Specifically, it changes alphabets to start with 0 (as is conventional), switches the variables k and n (again, convention) and removes the "words: " from the labels.

Hello !!

Could you use ``w.string_rep()`` instead or ``repr(w)[6:]`` ? This would prevent us from some trouble if the ``__repr__`` method from words is changed later on `:-)`

And thank you for reviewing!

By the way, since I'm not familiar with the review system, what are the requirements for inclusion? Does the patch get implemented once it has a positive review?
