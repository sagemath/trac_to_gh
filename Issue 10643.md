# Issue 10643: Misc improvements to the code of sage/combinat/e_one_star.py

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/10699

Original creator: slabbe

Original creation time: 2011-01-26 18:21:42

Assignee: slabbe, tjolivet

CC:  tjolivet

The file e_one_star.py was merged recently into sage. After using it a bit for my research, there are some small improvements that I suggest:

 - Add extra_code_before and extra_code_after arguments to the plot_tikz method.
 - Macros don't work when using sagetex. Remove the macros loza, lozb, lozc: just print the plain tikz code.
 - ...
 - Timo : add yours here ...

I just added a patch which fixes some small issues. All test passed. Documentation builds fine. I am OK with giving this ticket a positive review if Timo agrees with my two patches.

I just re-uploaded the patch trac_10699_e_one_star_fix-tj.patch to correct a minor typo in a function name (occurences_of instead of occurrences_of).
