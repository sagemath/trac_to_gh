The file e_one_star.py was merged recently into sage. After using it a bit for my research, there are some small improvements that I suggest:

- Add extra_code_before and extra_code_after arguments to the plot_tikz method.
- Macros don't work when using sagetex. Remove the macros loza, lozb, lozc: just print the plain tikz code.
- ...
- Timo : add yours here ...
