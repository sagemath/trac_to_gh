# Issue 15812: allow pycrypto to build on OS X if SAGE_ROOT is in PATH

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: jhpalmieri

Original creation time: 2014-04-02 19:53:21

If `$SAGE_ROOT` is in `$PATH`, then `pycrypto` may fail to build, at least on OS X: the command `sh configure` in `setup.py` can mistakenly execute `$SAGE_ROOT/configure`.

I've reported this to the pycrypto mailing list. If I hear anything, I will provide updates.

Your patch both looks correct and fixes the problem. Actually, i experienced this problem on Linux, so the mention `on OS X` in `SPKG.txt` is useless (and perhaps misleading). I let you fix that small documentation issue, and put a positive review.
