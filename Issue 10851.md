Keywords: principal specialization, exponential specialization, symmetric functions

This patch implements the principal and exponential specialisations for symmetric functions as given in Stanley, Enumerative Combinatorics, Section 7.8.

Unfortunately, the patch currently has several problems:
1) it seems that always the default code in sf/sfa.py is called
2) I do not know how to give the desired default argument 1 the correct type in exponential_specialization
3) I guess one should rather implement this for quasi-symmetric functions, but I do not know enough about these currently
