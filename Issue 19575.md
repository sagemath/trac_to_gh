It is well-known that a closed convex cone is solid (or full-dimensional, or generating...) if and only if its dual is pointed (or strictly convex). Add two doctests for that fact.

I just realized that I didn't add any tests for this, probably because `random_cone` came after `is_solid`. The `is_solid` result clearly follows from the `linear_subspace` one, but since the implementations differ I figure it's nice to have them both.
