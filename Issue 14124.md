Should you document in README.txt — or in the developer guide or the installation guide — where the log file is? And/or print a message with its location if doctesting doesn't succeed? ("For more details, see ...")

We never did that, should we? Nobody ever complained about this.

That's because the log file was in the same directory where you ran `make ptest`. Now it's hidden, at least a little.

By the way, `local/bin/sage-starts` should be patched too, to put `start.log` in `logs`.

(I don't care that much about the location of the log files. If you want, we can try it as is, and if we start seeing questions on sage-release or sage-devel, then we'll fix it.)

We should also update the hgignore to reflect the change in logs location.

For `.hgignore`, it's better to leave the old patterns in for upgrades of Sage.

ok, I think all is good now (other than maybe documentation)
