CC:  dimpase

The following fails


```
sage: K=PolynomialRing(QQ,'x,y,a0,a1',order=TermOrder('degrevlex',2)+TermOrder('degrevlex',2))
sage: x,y,a0,a1=K.gens()
sage: f = x**3+x**2*y
sage: m = Ideal(x**4,x**2*y,y**2)
sage: m.reduce(f) == f.reduce(m.groebner_basis())
False
sage: m.reduce(f)
x^3 + x^2*y
sage: f.reduce(m.groebner_basis())
x^3
```


The reduction should be `x^3`. Singular computes correctly the reduction, so the problem is in the Sage library.

I am not able to debug this. For me, it seems that this is an error in libsingular and, probably, a duplicate of #12529
