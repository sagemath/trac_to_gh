`finite_state_machine.FSMState.__eq__` only compares labels of states, but not their other attributes such as `is_initial`, `is_final`, `final_word_out`, `word_out`, `color`.

The reason is that states have to be hashable and that their hash only depends on the label --- therefore, states with the same labels have to be equal.

This is no problem as long as states of the same finite state machine are compared. When comparing two finite state machines, this distinction matters.

Therefore, a new method `FSMState.fully_equal` is introduced and used in `FiniteStateMachine.__eq__`.

Code didn't check attribute color. This is now done. Needs cross-review.

Apart from the color-issue, the code looks fine, so a positive_review as soon as the color-part is accepted.
