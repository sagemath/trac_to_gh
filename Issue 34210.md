It would be useful to have `EdgesView(source_vertices, target_vertices)` be the list of edges with one end in `source_vertices` and one end in `target_vertices`.

Bot is green modulo one test that I am all but certain is unrelated.

Vincent, any objections to me setting a positive review?

Note that we are not yet used `EdgesView` in `edge_boundary`. One of the reason is that we have several open tickets for cleaning `generic_graph.py`. The main reason is that we need to first ensure that the changes done here are what we expect.
