What do you think about making `Stream_uninitialized` always dense.  This is essentially the same as (2) above, just with less overhead.

This could be done either here or in #34636, which is ready for review. I could then make #34636 a dependency for this ticket.  I could even do a doctest there, because the problem arises already with, for example, the implicit definition of the Catalan numbers:

```
sage: L.<z> = LazyPowerSeriesRing(ZZ); C = L.undefined(); C.define(1 + z*C^2)
sage: %time _ = C[500]
...
RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded while calling a Python object

sage: L.<z> = LazyPowerSeriesRing(ZZ, sparse=True); C = L.undefined(); C.define(1 + z*C^2)
sage: %time _ = C[350]
CPU times: user 201 ms, sys: 0 ns, total: 201 ms
Wall time: 201 ms
sage: L.<z> = LazyPowerSeriesRing(ZZ, sparse=False); C = L.undefined(); C.define(1 + z*C^2)
