I think that after all this is not really useful. The reason being that the number
of overlattices is just too huge in any nontrivial example.

Changing status from new to needs_review.

I don't think that is a reason to not include this. Two small things:

```diff
-- ``only_even`` -- bool (default: ``False``) return only the even overlattices.
+- ``only_even`` -- boolean (default: ``False``); return only the even overlattices
```

`non - isotropic` -> `non-isotropic`. Once changed, I am okay with setting this to a positive review.
