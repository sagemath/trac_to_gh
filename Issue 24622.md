I think that after all this is not really useful. The reason being that the number
of overlattices is just too huge in any nontrivial example.

I don't think that is a reason to not include this. Two small things:

```diff
-- ``only_even`` -- bool (default: ``False``) return only the even overlattices.
+- ``only_even`` -- boolean (default: ``False``); return only the even overlattices
```

`non - isotropic` -> `non-isotropic`. Once changed, I am okay with setting this to a positive review.
