It occurred to me that we can speed this up for large examples by computing the `annihilator_basis` of each individual homogeneous component and forming a submodule from those since we know that the group action preserves degree when the group acts by ring automorphisms. 

Preliminary testing indicates that the code as currently written performs better on small examples (groundset size < 5) and the computation degree-by-degree performs better when the groundset is bigger. 

Should this optimization be implemented? If so in this ticket, or in another?

I would do the optimization here since it would give more reason for having this subclass. Also I would always just do it in each degree since the small examples will be relatively fast (I would be surprised if they showed up in a tight loop).

```diff
-        - optional parameter ``invariant`` -- (optional, default: None) either
-        a semigroup ``G`` whose ``__call__`` acts on the groundset, or pair
-        ``(G, action)`` where ``G`` is a semigroup and ``action``
-        is a function ``action(g,e)`` which takes a pair of a group
-        element and a grounset element and returns the groundset
-        element which is the result of ``e`` acted upon by ``g``
+        - ``invariant`` -- (optional) either a semigroup ``G`` such
+          that ``g(e)`` defines the action of a group element ``g``
+          on the groundset element ``e`` or pair ``(G, action)``,
+          where ``action(g, e)`` returns the action of ``g`` on ``e``
```

Just take care of the pyflakes warnings:

```diff
-import operator
```


```diff
-self._side = side = kwargs.pop('side', 'left')
+self._side = kwargs.pop('side', 'left')
```

and then this is a positive review.
