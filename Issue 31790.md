It occurred to me that we can speed this up for large examples by computing the `annihilator_basis` of each individual homogeneous component and forming a submodule from those since we know that the group action preserves degree when the group acts by ring automorphisms. 

Preliminary testing indicates that the code as currently written performs better on small examples (groundset size < 5) and the computation degree-by-degree performs better when the groundset is bigger. 

Should this optimization be implemented? If so in this ticket, or in another?
