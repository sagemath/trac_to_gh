This class can already be used as base class for `SubstituteFunction` but is intended also for other uses.

```
sage: from sage.symbolic.expression_conversions import ExpressionTreeWalker
sage: from sage.symbolic.random_tests import random_expr
sage: foo = random_expr(20, nvars=2)
sage: s = ExpressionTreeWalker(foo)
sage: bool(s() == foo)
True
```
