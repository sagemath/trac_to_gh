We've got one custom patch in the setuptools SPKG, `build/pkgs/setuptools/patches/easy_install_lock.patch`. Ideally this would be unused, as easy_install has been replaced by pip.

Can it be removed?

+1 for removing it. I think this code path might still be used when installing an old package that declares "setup_requires", but none of our SPKGs need it.

I'm not sure what you mean, there's no patchlevel in there currently? If you mean I should add one to indicate that the sources have changed... should I just bump the version to 58.0.4 instead?

`src/sage/misc/dev_tools.py` still makes a reference to `easy_install`.

Other than that, there is no direct use of `easy_install`; that includes the optional/experimental packages.

As I said in comment:1, the code path with `easy_install` could still be triggered by `setup_requires` of a package. However, for normal packages (= packages with `checksums.ini`), this cannot actually install a package from the net because we poison the http* proxy. No install, so no locking needed.

So only "script" or "pip" packages would need to be checked whether any of these use `setup_requires`
