numpy 1.16.1 seems to ignore the [ALL] section in this configuration file, but it respects the [DEFAULT] section.
 
Needed for #29013.

This is weird. The documentation in numpy and everywhere talks about `[ALL]` and I cannot find anything about `[DEFAULT]` in the code. Is a different python library used to parse `site.cfg` and could it have changed its behavior without numpy catching it?
