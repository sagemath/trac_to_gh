The [section in the tutorial on standalone scripts](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/tutorial/programming.html#standalone-python-sage-scripts) needs some fixing. It suggests writing a script starting with

```/usr/bin/env sage -python

import sys
from sage.all import *
...
```

But on sage.math.washington.edu, and probably on other linux systems, `/usr/bin/env` doesn't handle multiple arguments very well. I think that replacing the first line with `#!/usr/bin/env sage` should work.

This doesn't fix what is in the description, which is fixed already, I guess.  What I don't understand is why you remove the `-python`, since otherwise there is no need for

```
from sage.all import *
```

is there?  Maybe I'm missing something.

I think this is the right thing to do. First, we should certainly not advocate `#!/usr/bin/env` followed by multiple arguments. Second, I just tried the script from the tutorial but with just `#!/usr/bin/env sage` at the top. It worked fine, but it didn't work if I removed `from sage.all import *`:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "./my_script", line 10, in <module>
    print factor(sage_eval(sys.argv[1]))
NameError: name 'factor' is not defined

No objections if it works this way and doesn't otherwise!  I didn't do anything useful here so I'm taking my name off, though.
