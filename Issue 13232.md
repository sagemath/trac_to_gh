Keywords: symmetric functions

Due to accumulating history, the names of the various bases of
Symmetric functions and variants are not very consistent:

```
    sage: Sym = SymmetricFunctions(FractionField(QQ['q,t'])); Sym
    Symmetric Functions over Fraction Field of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in q, t over Rational Field
    sage: Sym.s()
    Symmetric Function Algebra over Fraction Field of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in q, t over Rational Field, Schur symmetric functions as basis
    sage: Sym.macdonald().P()
    Macdonald polynomials in the P basis over Fraction Field of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in q, t over Rational Field
    sage: Sym.hall_littlewood().P()
    Hall-Littlewood polynomials in the P basis over Fraction Field of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in q, t over Rational Field
```

This is not consistent either with NCSF/Qsym:

```
    sage: NCSF = NonCommutativeSymmetricFunctions(QQ)
    sage: NCSF.Psi()
    Non-Commutative Symmetric Functions over the Rational Field in the Psi basis
```

Besides, it is verbose and does not support renaming Sym to get shorter names:

```
    sage: Sym.rename("Sym")
    sage: Sym.s()
    Symmetric Function Algebra over Fraction Field of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in q, t over Rational Field, Schur symmetric functions as basis
```

I am in the process of refactoring the _repr_ code to improve this:

```
    sage: Sym = SymmetricFunctions(FractionField(QQ['q,t'])); Sym
    Symmetric Functions over Fraction Field of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in q, t over Rational Field
    sage: Sym.p()
    Symmetric Functions over Fraction Field of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in q, t over Rational Field on the powersum basis
```

In the following examples, we rename `Sym` for brevity:

```
    sage: Sym.rename("Sym"); Sym
    Sym
```

Classical bases:

```
    sage: Sym.p()
    Sym in the powersum basis
    sage: Sym.m()
    Sym in the monomial basis
    sage: Sym.e()
    Sym in the elementary basis
    sage: Sym.h()
    Sym in the homogeneous basis
    sage: Sym.s()                           # Mind the capital here
    Sym in the Schur basis
    sage: Sym.f()
    Sym in the forgotten basis
```




Macdonald polynomials:

```
    sage: Sym.macdonald().P()
    Sym in the Macdonald P basis
    sage: Sym.macdonald().Ht()
    Sym in the Macdonald Ht basis
```

Macdonald polynomials, with specialized parameters:

```
    sage: Sym.macdonald(q=1).S()
    Sym in the Macdonald S with q=1 basis
    sage: Sym.macdonald(q=1,t=3).P()
    Sym in the Macdonald P with q=1 and t=3 basis
```

Hall-Littlewood polynomials:

```
    sage: Sym.hall_littlewood().P()
    Sym in the Hall-Littlewood P basis
    sage: Sym.hall_littlewood().Qp()
    Sym in the Hall-Littlewood Qp basis
```

Hall-Littlewood polynomials, with specialized parameter:

```
    sage: Sym.hall_littlewood(t=1).P()
    Sym in the Hall-Littlewood P with t=1 basis
```


Jack polynomials::

```
    sage: Sym.jack().J()
    Sym in the Jack J basis
    sage: Sym.jack().P()
    Sym in the Jack P basis
    sage: Sym.jack().Q()
    Sym in the Jack Q basis
    sage: Sym.jack().Qp()
    Sym in the Jack Qp basis
```

Jack polynomials, with specialized parameter::

```
    sage: Sym.jack(t=1).J()
    Sym in the Jack J with t=1 basis
```

Zonal polynomials::

```
    sage: Sym.zonal()
    Sym in the zonal basis
```

LLT polynomials:

```
    sage: Sym.llt(3).hspin()
    Sym in the level 3 LLT spin basis
    sage: Sym.llt(3).hcospin()
    Sym in the level 3 LLT cospin basis
```

```
    sage: Sym.kBoundedSubspace(3,1)
    3-bounded Symmetric Functions over Rational Field with t=1
    sage: SymmetricFunctions(QQ['t']).kBoundedSubspace(3)
    3-bounded Symmetric Functions over Univariate Polynomial Ring in t over Rational Field
    sage: Sym.kschur(3,1)                                
    3-bounded Symmetric Functions over Rational Field with t=1 in the 3-Schur basis also with t=1
    sage: Sym.khomogeneous(3)  
    3-bounded Symmetric Functions over Rational Field with t=1 in the 3-bounded homogeneous basis
    sage: SymmetricFunctions(QQ['t']).kschur(3)
    3-bounded Symmetric Functions over Univariate Polynomial Ring in t over Rational Field in the 3-Schur basis
```

Salut Nicolas--

My 2c: 

"in the ... basis", not "on the ... basis".  

And for me, I don't think of the h basis as "homogeneous", but rather as "complete".  The bases are all homogeneous, after all!  I guess some people say "complete homogeneous", and maybe that's best -- it gives the word "complete" more meaning (i.e., the h_i are complete subject to being homogeneous).  But maybe I was brought up wrong...

cheers,

Hugh

I definitely disagree. Most author abbreviate to "homogeneous". Why is this symbol for this "h" and not "c"? You can change it to "complete homogeneous" if you care about this. But I think just "complete" is a confusing convention.

You are welcome!

Yes! Well, almost: there remains the on->in change for NSym and Qsym
(and in general "with realizations"), but that's for another patch.

> Don't you want to keep some tests when q is set to a value or both parameters are set to a value?


That would have been better indeed. That being said, the doctests of
SymmetricFunctionsBases.ParentMethods._repr_ includes an example with
two parameters, and the failure when q is wrong is tested in
Macdonald.__init__; so if you don't mind I'll be lazy and leave things
as is.

Good question. It's a bit long, but has some desirable features
besides consistency with realizations/bases:

- The ground field is specified
- It refers to Sym, in such a way that if Sym is renamed to something short, this gets shorter as well

Btw 1: it would be good to have t specified in the name of the kBoundedSubspace.

```
sage: Sym.kBoundedSubspace(3)
3-bounded Subspace of Symmetric Functions over Fraction Field of Univariate Polynomial Ring in t over Rational Field
sage: Sym.kBoundedSubspace(3,1)
3-bounded Subspace of Symmetric Functions over Fraction Field of Univariate Polynomial Ring in t over Rational Field with t = 1
```

Btw 2: in the docstrings of new_kschur, wouldn't we want to change

```
sage: KBoundedSubspace(Sym,3,1)
```

to

```
sage: Sym.kBoundedSubspace(3,1)
```

(except probably once in the __init__, for testing purposes)?

I am not sure I'll have the time to implement that before Tuesday, so
feel free to beat me to it.

Cheers,
                           Nicolas
