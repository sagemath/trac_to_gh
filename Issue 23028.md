Unfortunately, there is no formal definition of what is a bipartite graph in the [BipartiteGraph](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/graphs/sage/graphs/bipartite_graph.html) module.

The code you have added silently accepts loops, but a bipartite graph cannot have loops: 

```
sage: B = BipartiteGraph(loops=True, multiedges=True)
sage: B.add_edge(0, 1, 'a')
sage: B.add_edge(0, 1, 'b')
sage: B.is_bipartite()
True
sage: B.add_edge(0,0)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
RuntimeError                              Traceback (most recent call last)
...
RuntimeError: Edge vertices must lie in different partitions.
```



Well, actually it is possible to add loops to a bipartite graph because the module is not consistent at all:

```
sage: B = BipartiteGraph(loops=True, multiedges=True)
sage: B.add_edge(0, 0)
sage: B.is_bipartite()
False
sage: B.add_edge(1, 1)
sage: B.add_edge(2, 2)
sage: B.edges(labels=0)
[(0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 2)]
sage: B.add_edge(0, 1, 'a')
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
RuntimeError                              Traceback (most recent call last)
...
RuntimeError: Edge vertices must lie in different partitions.
sage: B.add_edge(3, 3)
sage: B.edges()
[(0, 0, None), (1, 1, None), (2, 2, None), (3, 3, None)]
```


So I suggest that:
- you remove parts of the code dealing with loops. You should assume that the graph has no loops, and if it has one, the problem must be fixed elsewhere.
- someone open a ticket to forbid loops in bipartite graphs: forbid `loops=True` in the constructor, forbid to use method `allow_loops`, etc.

Good catch. The only part of the code that I added that deals with loops is the test, but loops certainly shouldn't be allowed, even though they won't impact the matching.
