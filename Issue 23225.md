We are implementing square roots that create extensions for elements in rational number field. The code should return the equivalent of the element *b* in the code below :

```
sage: P.<x> = QQ[]
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^2 - 7)
sage: Q.<y> = K[]
sage: E.<b> = NumberField(y^2 - a)
sage: b^2
a
```
