Hum so in the case of `sage/rings/complex_double` the dependency on `pari` and `gsl` are now automatically added from the fact you import or declare some symbols in the corresponding `.pxd` file? Of course that's how the linking to pari must have been done in the first place since there was already no `pari` in `libraries` before your change. And thank you for demonstrating `aliases`, I feel I will abuse this in the future.

Looks good but I should at least do a build of that one because it is a lot of changes even if they are seemingly trivial.

If you replace "import or declare" by "`cimport`", yes, you are right. You just need to add the libraries to the `.pxd` file.

That was done in #18450.

Abuse? :-)

Anyway, for #17630, you'll probably want to define an analogous `BLAS_LIBRARIES` or something.

You read my mind. :)

On my Linux laptop, `make ptest` passes. I'll try on an OS X box also.

I don't doubt that you have done so already. I just do what I think I should do as a reviewer, running my own independent tests in this case.

Everything fine on OS X also.
