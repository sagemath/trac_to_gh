The precision in PARI is initialized wrongly:

By default, we get 2 significant words while we really should get only 1:

```
sage: pari('Pi').debug()
[&=0000000004fc9620] REAL(lg=4):0400000000000004 (+,expo=1):6000000000000001 c90fdaa22168c234 c4c6628b80dc1cd1
```


If we change the precision and then change it back, we get 1 word:

```
sage: n = pari.get_real_precision(); pari.set_real_precision(100); pari.set_real_precision(n);
sage: pari('Pi').debug()
[&=00000000012bf200] REAL(lg=3):0400000000000003 (+,expo=1):6000000000000001 c90fdaa22168c235
```
