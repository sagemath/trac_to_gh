* To make the code Python3-compatible, you should replace
  {{{#!python
          return "\\overline{%s}" % self.base_ring()._latex_()
  }}}
  by 
  {{{#!python
          return "\\overline``".format(self.base_ring()._latex_())
  }}}
* In the doc, you should replace `Returns latex representation of self.` by `Return a LaTeX representation of ``self``.` (as for the other method `_latex_` in the same file).
