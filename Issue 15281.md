Implement the `getattr()` method for PARI objects using closures, for more efficiency and elegancy.  The implementation was suggested by Bill Allombert, see http://pari.math.u-bordeaux1.fr/archives/pari-dev-1311/msg00015.html .

Bill also mentions GP defined member functions in the above e-mail.  I don't expect this patch to work for such member functions, but we probably don't have much use for them anyway.
