# Issue 28539: Coercion between algebraic polyhedra fails

Keywords: algebraic polyhedra, quadratic fields

For the following polyhedra all things involving coercion fail.

```
sage: P = polytopes.icosahedron(); P
A 3-dimensional polyhedron in (Number Field in sqrt5 with defining polynomial x^2 - 5 with sqrt5 = 2.236067977499790?)^3 defined as the convex hull of 12 vertices
sage: P1 = polytopes.small_rhombicuboctahedron(); P1
A 3-dimensional polyhedron in (Number Field in sqrt2 with defining polynomial x^2 - 2 with sqrt2 = 1.414213562373095?)^3 defined as the convex hull of 24 vertices

```


It seems to boil down to two issues:
- `P.base_extend(P1.base_ring())` doesn't do anything, see #28770,
- quadratic fields cannot be coerced at the moment, see #28774.

Once, both are taken care of, we should check that things work and add doctests accordingly.

As was pointed out to me, it is not desirable to coerce number fields to the smallest field in general. As it is not canonical, fragile and expensive.

However, it seems to be desirable for polyhedra, isn't it? Would it make sense to implement that somewhat as a standard behavior, e.g. that a polyhedron over QQ[sqrt(2)] and one over QQ[sqrt(3)] are coerced to one over QQ[sqrt(2) + sqrt(3)]?

Moving tickets to milestone sage-9.2 based on a review of last modification date, branch status, and severity.

Moving this ticket to 9.4, as it seems unlikely that it will be merged in 9.3, which is in the release candidate stage

Setting a new milestone for this ticket based on a cursory review.

Stalled in `needs_review` or `needs_info`; likely won't make it into Sage 9.5.
