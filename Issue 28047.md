A number of desirable improvements to Macaulay2 interface is outlined in this [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/Macaulay2/Workshop-2019-Minneapolis/blob/master/exploring-m2-interface.ipynb)

An often requested feature is an intereface between Macaulay2's chain complexes and Sage's [chain complexes](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/homology/sage/homology/chain_complex.html) - this is something to be worked on.

Changing keywords from "" to "Macaulay2".

It would also be nice to make interfacing between quotient rings possible, as Macaulay2 seems more capable than Sage in that regard.
