A number of desirable improvements to Macaulay2 interface is outlined in this [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/Macaulay2/Workshop-2019-Minneapolis/blob/master/exploring-m2-interface.ipynb)

An often requested feature is an intereface between Macaulay2's chain complexes and Sage's [chain complexes](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/homology/sage/homology/chain_complex.html) - this is something to be worked on.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28284

Changing keywords from "" to "Macaulay2".

It would also be nice to make interfacing between quotient rings possible, as Macaulay2 seems more capable than Sage in that regard.
