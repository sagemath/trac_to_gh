Looks good, except for two caveats:
- This adds `SBox` to the global namespace. I'm not sure this will be widely appreciated so I'd ask on [sage-devel] if there are any objects. Apologies if I simply missed this having been done already.
- Why `import all` in `__init__.py`?

    If you want to create a new directory in the Sage library SAGE_ROOT/src/sage (say, measure_theory), that directory should contain a file __init__.py that contains the single line import all in addition to whatever files you want to add (say, borel_measure.py and banach_tarski.py), and also a file all.py listing imports from that directory that are important enough to be in the Sageâ€™s global namespace at startup. The file all.py might look like this:

But as the docu also says something about `lazy_import`, which is not used here, I'm confused, whats the correct way to do here.

IMHO, it should not get into the global namespace.

perhaps for all crypto things a `crypto` catalog should be itroduced, and this can go there then.

I also would suggest that it is lazy_import'ed, too.

In general, we do not do imports in `__init__.py`; mostly they are blank files that are Python boilerplate (at least with how we use them). I believe this has no effect.

Although AFAIK, your changes do not make anything worse for the global namespace, but having the lazy imports are good for startup time. You can do multiple imports by, e.g.,

```
lazy_import('sage.crypto.classical', ['AffineCryptosystem', 'HillCryptosystem'])
```

Once that is changed (as I think it is cleaner code), then I am willing to set a positive review.
