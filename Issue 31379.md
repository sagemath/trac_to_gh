# Issue 31379: Make quaternion_algebra() method of Brandt modules directly call QuaternionAlgebra()

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31616

Keywords: quaternion algebra

The method `BrandtModule_class.quaternion_algebra()` currently computes a pair of integers `(a, b)` with prescribed Hilbert symbols, and then calls `QuaternionAlgebra(QQ, a, b)` to construct a quaternion algebra.  This can be simplified by using `QuaternionAlgebra(D)` to get a quaternion algebra with discriminant `D`.
