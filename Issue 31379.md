Keywords: quaternion algebra

The method `BrandtModule_class.quaternion_algebra()` currently computes a pair of integers `(a, b)` with prescribed Hilbert symbols, and then calls `QuaternionAlgebra(QQ, a, b)` to construct a quaternion algebra.  This can be simplified by using `QuaternionAlgebra(D)` to get a quaternion algebra with discriminant `D`.
