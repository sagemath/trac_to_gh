# Issue 11340: problem with commenting in notebook

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/11512

In notebook SAGE tries to evaluate ? even if it appears after the # sign (provided that there are something in front of # to be evaluated)

For example,

2+2 # is this easy ?

gives 

No object '' currently defined.

but just 

# is this easy ?

is okay.

Proposing to close all sagenb tickets as outdated, so that all remaining open tickets in the notebook component are about the Jupyter notebook.
