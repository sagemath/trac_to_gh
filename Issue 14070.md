Sage is numerically approximating this integral, even though it's divergent:


```
sage: integrate(x^3/sqrt(x^7+1), x, 1, oo).n()              
-2.0585298599983344
sage: numerical_integral(x^3/sqrt(x^7+1), 1, oo)    
(-2.0585298599983344, 1.1214140727133781e-11)
```


`numerical_integral` also fails on simpler divergent integrals:


```
sage: numerical_integral(1/x, 1, oo)
(65.94931131932763, 8.156214940519742)
```

Regarding the first one; basically, when we return a noun form

```
sage: integrate(x^3/sqrt(x^7+1), x, 1, oo)
integrate(x^3/sqrt(x^7 + 1), x, 1, +Infinity)
```

and call `n` we do

```
sage: A._convert(RR)
-2.0585298599985333
```

because we do

```
sage: sage.symbolic.integration.integral.DefiniteIntegral._evalf_??

        from sage.gsl.integration import numerical_integral
        # The gsl routine returns a tuple, which also contains the error.
        # We only return the result.
        return numerical_integral(f, a, b)[0]
```

So these are both manifestations of the same thing.

So... is it user error to numerically integrate a divergent integral?  I certainly don't know that we should be checking every numerical integral for divergence, particularly since Maxima apparently can't (yet) do the first one in any case!

In fact, with the code at http://www.physics.ohio-state.edu/~ntg/780/gsl_examples/qagiu_test.cpp, it returns errors for all these integrals.

If you present a patch, I think we'd be very interested in reviewing it.  Silly to return nonsense in these cases.
