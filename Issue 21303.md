# Issue 21303: Graph plotting: allow setting edge thickness in looped digraphs

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Try


```
sage: G = DiGraph({0: [0,1]}, loops=True)
sage: G.show()
```


The loop-edge from `0` to `0` is very small. However it is better with


```
G.show(edge_thickness=3)
```


Also I was asked why it has no arrow head. Maybe it could be added? But anyways, why thickness can not be changed in digraphs?

Added edge_thickness functionality for digraphs. The problem was that arrow2d has width and not thickness.

Concerning the missing arrow heads on loops of directed graphs, they are missing since these loops are drawn as circles by using the circle command! Here is the relevant portion of graph_plot.py:

```
self._plot_components['edges'].append(circle((self._pos[a][0],
    self._pos[a][1]-curr_loop_size), curr_loop_size,
    rgbcolor=local_labels[i][1], **eoptions))

```

The edge_thickness functionality only works for loops of fixed points. For example,

```
G = DiGraph({0: [0,1]},loops=True)
G.show(edge_thickness=1)
G.show(edge_thickness=15)
```

only changes the thickness of the loop at 0 and not the thickness of the arc from 0 to 1.
