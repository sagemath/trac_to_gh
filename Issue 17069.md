I put a "need review" because the commit is ready, but there is no hurry if you need to discuss on the sagenb side.

Since this change works even without modifying the sagenb, I don't see any point in delaying the switch. For the users the difference should be using a more up-to-date version of MathJax.

Well, it's kind of a hack removing things from the egg, isn't it?  Anyway, I won't be trying it in the near future, but if you have time to test it and there aren't any subtle things, obviously in the long run this is a very good idea.

If i understand the motivation in having this ticket separate from #17288, sagenb development has not much energy. So, if sagenb developpers agree with this ticket, then it can be accepted without the need to release a new version of sagenb (and the removing part of spkg-install can be removed later once mathjax is removed from sagenb tarball during a following release). I just wanted to avoid this ticket to impose some additional work on the sagenb side.

Okay, in that case though I am not sure I will be able to review this - Andrey, I'm happy if you test this, though, I just don't want to mix things up too badly.

Incidentally, I'm surprised you have to go to those lengths to find the version number, at least for sagenb; shouldn't there be a variable defining the current pkg version available inside the current pkg install process?  It surprises me if that's not the case.  But I admit I don't have independent proof of this.

I just read the `sage-spkg` script to see if i can steal something from there. There are indeed some `PKG_VER`, `LOCAL_PKG_VER` and `PKG_BASE_VER` variables that could be good candidates. However, those variables are not exported and the `spkg-install` script is called (not sourced) so the `spkg-install` will not inherit those variables.

By the way, `LOCAL_PKG_VER` is also built by looking at `package-version.txt`.
