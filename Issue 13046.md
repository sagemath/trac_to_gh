```
sage: R, x = PowerSeriesRing(ZZ, 'x', default_prec = 80).objgen()
sage: f = x + x^2
sage: f.parent()
Power Series Ring in x over Integer Ring
sage: f.parent().default_prec()
80
sage: g = 1/f
sage: g.parent()
Laurent Series Ring in x over Integer Ring
sage: g.parent().default_prec()
20     (??????)
```


In the mean time I added doctests to laurent_series_ring.py

The example in change_ring could be more illustrative, though the test you have there is useful as well. 

Line 144-146, one space extra indentation.

Bug in is_field, namely


```
sage: LaurentSeriesRing(ZZ, 't').is_field()
True
```



In `_repr_`, test a sparse ring as well.

It'd be nice to show at least one example (and non-example?) of each of the bullet points in _coerce_impl. 

All of these points are fairly minor, but we might as well attack them while we're here.  Other than that, looks good.

Oh, and I'm getting better at filling in the reviewers field...
