This is different from ticket #17872 (where doc is actually broken) : here my debian experiments show that some parts of sage can break a little too easily.

The singular functions are created using code in src/sage/libs/singular/function.pyx, while their documentation comes from src/sage/interfaces/singular.py : singular.hlp is scanned and documentation nodes get added. So if by chance you create a singular function in sage under the name say "NF" but the documentation has it under the name "reduce", one might get a working function with an exception-rising help because the node doesn't correspond.

I'll propose a patch to replace this with a little error message.
