Newest pynac does:
* fix `Re/Im(tanh)` (#20098)
* sin/cos/tan of numeric: reduce mod `2*pi` (#20099)
* exp of numeric: reduce mod `2*pi*I` (#20099)
* performance: speed up sin/cos/tan/coth/acoth evaluation

The interface changes on this ticket are relatively straightforward, and I could easily review this. However, I'm not sure whether I should, as I've contributed to the pynac release. What do you think?

The whole point of this doctest is lost:

```
        Here arccoth doesn't have 1 in its domain, so we just hold the expression:

            sage: elliptic_e(arccoth(1), x^2*e)
            elliptic_e(arccoth(1), x^2*e)

I would remove the sentence "Here arccoth doesn't have 1 in its domain, so we just hold the expression:"
