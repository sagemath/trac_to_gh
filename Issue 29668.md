Why? What's wrong with this ticket?

Note that this ticket really has only one commit. If there is something wrong with #29903 or #29904 it should be fixed there. Not that I would know what the problem with those tickets would be.

One thing I could do is to use this ticket to improve the doctest for the hypercubes. Is that what you mean? Somethings as


```
sage: P = polytopes.hypercube(intervals=random_intervals, backend='field')
sage: P._test_basic_properties()
```

If that is the problem, then this ticket here is still green and #29903 should be "needs work". To avoid confusion I can of course quickly push one commit to all three tickets.

So we don't put `set_random_seed` anymore because we will go through with #29935 soon?

Yes, if you are concerned about the random seeds, this needs a proper solution, not one that is localized to one doctest.

By the way, if you want to fuzz this particular doctest, why not just execute it in a loop so it picks up a new set of deterministic pseudo random numbers in each iteration? That should be good enough.

I already added a new doctest for #29904 that manually tests the only interesting case besides the static case that is always being tested.
