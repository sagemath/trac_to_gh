Keywords: rebase

In #23397 I added a file lock around running `sage-rebase.sh` at the end of every package install on Cygwin, in an effort to reduce errors when multiple packages run `sage-rebase.sh` simultaneously during parallel builds.

Unfortunately, it seems this was not enough--it's possible to get errors during parallel builds of `sage-rebase.sh` is run during the build/installation of some packages.

So with this change (on Cygwin only of course) all build processes obtain a shared lock on `rebase.lock`, and then `sage-rebase.sh` is run under an exclusive lock.

This unfortunately slows down parallel builds--for any N packages being built simultaneously, all packages in that set have to wait whichever one takes the longest to build.  But I think this is a necessary sacrifice in order for the builds to not run into this problem.  In the future it may be possible to make this more fine-grained; after all it isn't strictly necessary to run `rebase` for every package (only those that install DLLs).

I think in this case it's not that there's nothing happening, but rather the output from the other build process gets blocked until it's complete (so e.g. if some builds are waiting on mpir to build which can take a long time, you'll get blocked output and then a big output dump when the mpir build is done).

That would be a problem of delay.

So this might be related : I can't finish make (with MAKE="make -j4") on this machine ; it fails reporting a timeout in a forked process. See the uploaded log.

I'll unset MAKE and try to finish this one.

[ Snip... ]

> I'll unset MAKE and try to finish this one.

A serial make finished successfully un abouy 15 minutes (the last unsuccesful attempt to parallel make (which was only for docs) took 23 minutes).

FWIW, my various attempts to parallel make took about 22h30min of registered computing time, not that far of the 27h12min and some change needed by my previous serial building of 8.2.beta5(IIRC).

The elapsed time was much longer, sice I didn't attend to all the build and discovered errors after coming back to my office after ( night | lunch | another night ).

At least on my present machine, parallel building seems currently a losing proposition.

I also noticed a strong tendency to trashing (a coexistent Chrome window completely stopped responding several times...) : 8 GB RAM might be insufficient for safely building sage on 4 threads...

From this list, I can only suspect Google Chrome, if that is akin to the "Google Desktop" listed.

But since is a machine configured by our (somewhat paranoïd) administrators, I might well have, for example, an antivirus running in the background and invisible to me.

Care for a full install log (I'd have to send it directly to you, since it woould be about 2.1 MB gzipped...) ?

In retrospect, maybe the times you got aren't so unreasonable after all:


```
real    361m29.365s
user    313m46.310s
sys     162m22.775s
Sage build/upgrade complete!
```


That's just over 6 hours.  If it were a serial build it would be roughly 4 times that (roughly of course--just because it was using `-j4` doesn't mean it's going to be exactly 4 times faster, *especially* given how much this patch slows things down).

I'll also say however that the build completed without any errors or requiring any intervention on my part, so it should be pretty stable.  I think my last version of this patch may have been slightly broken because of the directory creation issue, so maybe it didn't quite work as advertised before.

I also didn't notice any long hangs with no output, but it's not as if I had my eyes glued to the screen the entire time either.

The times I quoted were for attempts to //parallel// build... So my times are still unacceptably high.

Your hypothesis of an interference with an (unknown) program running on my config still deserves exploration. A first attempt of running with "CYGWIN=detect_bloda" didn't show anything. But I'll retry this after a cold start...

I'll also try a fresh build on a VM. As already told, this will have to wait a bit...

BTW, something else bothers me : the discrepancy between wall time and CPU time. From the (serial) `testlong.log` I ran after completing the build :


```
Total time for all tests: 63115.2 seconds
    cpu time: 17746.2 seconds
    cumulative wall time: 45802.2 seconds
```


and this is displayed below the call :

```
real    1074m14,375s
user    687m47,318s
sys     247m32,749s
```


Notes :
* A bit less than 18 hours for the tests is a bit long in the tooth...
* I get the two errors already reported (killing a process takes more than 4 seconds, unicode error in the doctest framework) plus a new one :


```
sage -t --long --warn-long 209.2 src/sage/structure/coerce_actions.pyx
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/structure/coerce_actions.pyx", line 786, in sage.structure.coerce

1 item had failures:

```


Care for a formal bug report ?
