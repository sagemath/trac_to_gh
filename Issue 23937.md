This is simple upgrade of `giac`. It removes the needs for 2 patches
* linking to png16. Version of png are now tested in order in configure from png16 to png.
* fix for pari 2.8 and over

What's more the patch for the pari result was dependent on the compiler used (gcc vs clang). Upstream now give the same result for both gcc and glang (at least on linux).
