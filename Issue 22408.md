Normaliz has several computation options. They should be exposed by the `Polyhedron_normaliz` constructor.

 4.3. Algorithmic variants

 The default choice is the Normaliz primal algorithm that is based on a (partial) triangulation.

 `DualMode`, -d activates the dual algorithm for the computation of the Hilbert basis and degree
 1 elements. Includes HilbertBasis, unless Deg1Elements is set. It overrules
 IsIntegrallyClosed.

 `Approximate`, -r activates the approximation algorithm for the computation of degree 1 elements.
 Nevertheless it does not imply Deg1Elements (we donâ€™t want to block potential
 other applications of Approximate.)

 `BottomDecomposition`, -b tells Normaliz to use bottom decomposition in the primal algorithm.

 `KeepOrder`, -k forbids Normaliz to reorder the generators of the efficient cone C. Only
 useful if original monoid generators are defined. Blocks BottomDecomposition.

Changing keywords from "" to "IMA-PolyGeom".

Moving some tickets to 9.2. This is not a promise that I will be working on them.

Setting new milestone based on a cursory review of ticket status, priority, and last modification date.
