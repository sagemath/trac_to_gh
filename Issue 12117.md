Keywords: pynac

Custom numeric evaluation functions defined in the `_evalf_()` method of symbolic functions accept only the parent of the result as an argument. We should expand this to allow passing an `argument` parameter as well.

The `evalf_dict` branch of Pynac [available here](https://bitbucket.org/burcin/pynac-wip/), with the attached patches applied to the Sage library, allows this:


```
sage: cot(1/2).n(algorithm='foo')
11.0000000000000
sage: cot(1/2).n()
1.83048772171245
```


The docstrings for `_convert()` etc. methods of symbolic expressions need to be updated to reflect these changes.

I'm trying to rebase the patch [This is the Trac macro *attachment:trac_12289-evalf_dictionary.patch* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#attachment:trac_12289-evalf_dictionary.patch-macro) to sage-5.0, but I'm running into a problem with the type of `py_funcs.py_float`. In the patch py_float has type `object (*)(object, object)` but in sage-5.0, it has type `object (*)(object, PyObject *)` I guess because of a pynac change in the meantime. 

To be more specific, with this type def for `py_float`:


```
cdef public object py_float(object n, object kwds) except +:
```


I rebuild sage and get:


```

I've been working on this ticket today at sd40.5. I've got burcin's changes working in sage-5.0 with a caveat. Here's how to get the example in comment:1 working in sage-5.0:

1. install the __patched__ pynac-0.2.4.p1 spkg at http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/bjones/pynac-0.2.4.p1.spkg. this spkg is the pynac-0.2.4 spkg from #12950 which has been patched to include the changes from burcin's `pynac-wip` branch of pynac mentioned above.

2. apply all patches at #12950, here is a shell script to help that (run from `$SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage`): http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/bjones/trac_12950_apply.sh

3. apply the patches to `$SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage`

I can't do actual testing now (or any time soon, I've really fallen off the development radar screen) but these minor changes in the last two commits are completely fine as long as the doc change fixes the problem.  Hopefully we'll actually start implementing some of these algorithms now...

Is there any particular reason that this was done for `_evalf_` and not also plain `_eval_`?

```
sage: f(0.12345, algorithm="foobar")
