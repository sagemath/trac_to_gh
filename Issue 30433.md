Something worries me in the `Dokchitser` class
in `src/sage/lfunctions/dokchitser.py`.

The `__init__` method of  has an optional parameter
with a mutable default value: `poles=[]`.

Is that on purpose?

Un autre ticket pour tous les `=[]` (à trouver avec `git grep`)?

Par exemple:

```
$ git grep "def .*=\[.*:" src
```
