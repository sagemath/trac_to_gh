Here's an outline:

1. cd to SAGE_ROOT
2. cd to devel/sage-main/doc/
3. cp -rf fr/ hu
4. cd hu
5. rm -rf tutorial/
6. cd a_tour_of_sage/
7. Put your Hungarian translation in the file index.rst (remove the French translation first).
8. Apply the following patch:

```
diff --git a/doc/common/build_options.py b/doc/common/build_options.py
--- a/doc/common/build_options.py
+++ b/doc/common/build_options.py

-LANGUAGES = ['en', 'fr']

 SPHINXOPTS = ""
 PAPER = ""

```

1. cd SAGE_ROOT
2. Now build your Hungarian translation:

```
./sage -docbuild hu/a_tour_of_sage html
```


Once you're happy with your Hungarian translation, produce a patch and post it on this ticket.
