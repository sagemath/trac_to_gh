I've translated the “A Tour of Sage” document to Hungarian as my first contribution to Sage. Could you please give me some quick hints how to integrate this into the documentation, below the French version?
I don't need very detailed guidance. Thank you! -- Gabor

Replying to [ticket:10778 gborguly]:
> Could you please give me some quick hints how to integrate this into the documentation, below the French version?

Here's an outline:

 1. cd to SAGE_ROOT
 1. cd to devel/sage-main/doc/
 1. cp -rf fr/ hu
 1. cd hu
 1. rm -rf tutorial/
 1. cd a_tour_of_sage/
 1. Put your Hungarian translation in the file index.rst (remove the French translation first).
 1. Apply the following patch:

```
diff --git a/doc/common/build_options.py b/doc/common/build_options.py
--- a/doc/common/build_options.py
+++ b/doc/common/build_options.py
`@``@` -4,7 +4,7 `@``@`
 
 import os
 SAGE_DOC = os.environ['SAGE_DOC']
-LANGUAGES = ['en', 'fr']
+LANGUAGES = ['en', 'fr', 'hu']
 SPHINXOPTS = ""
 PAPER = ""
 OMIT = ["introspect"]  # docs/dirs to omit when listing and building 'all'
```

 1. cd SAGE_ROOT
 1. Now build your Hungarian translation:

```
./sage -docbuild hu/a_tour_of_sage html
```


Once you're happy with your Hungarian translation, produce a patch and post it on this ticket.

Hello,

is there any Hungarian in the neighbourhood that could have a look at the translation, correct what needs correction, check that the doc builds fine, pass tests, etc

Hi,

 I took a look and have some small corrections. How can I send the corrected version to you? Unfortunately I don't have a Sage branch right now.

 Regards,
  Peter Mora

ping ?

Hmm, I asked someone to ask someone and that someone says the other someone said there were no corrections suggestions.   (And both were native speakers, though the first did not study math in Magyar.)  I'm emailing the other reviewer as well just to see if it turned out they weren't really worth the effort.  At any rate, they _look_ fine to me, other than not speaking Magyar!

I think it's better to have this in than wait for the small corrections... Frédéric, what do you think?
