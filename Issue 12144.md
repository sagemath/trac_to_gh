# Issue 12144: find_fit does not work for piecewise functions

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: Shashank

Original creation time: 2012-01-16 20:42:43

Assignee: jason, jkantor

Keywords: piecewise find_fit

find_fit calls len(variables) which is not defined for piecewise functions. There is a variable "length" that is equivalent. If the function passed to find_fit is piecewise it should call "length" instead of "len(variables)".

It would be great if you could post an example of what _should_ work, by the way, just for reference.  Thanks!
