# Issue 32083: Ideal() with fraction-field elements is a small footgun

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/32320

Keywords: fields, fraction fields, ideals

I occasionally find myself trying to solve polynomial systems arising from rational equations:

```
sage: R.<x,y> = GF(31337)[]
sage: xx = (x*y+y*x) / (1+23*x^2*y^2)
sage: yy = (y^2-x^2) / (1+23*x^2*y^2)
sage: Ideal([xx-1, yy-0]) == 1
True
```

One might conclude at this point that the equation has no solutions.

This is of course nonsense: `xx` and `yy` are elements of the _fraction field_ of `R`, so every ideal is either `(0)` or `(1)`, and what we should have written is `Ideal([f.numerator() for f in (xx-1, yy-0)])`. Realizing that this is what's happening may cost the user precious seconds, minutes, or even hours.

This patch adds a warning to the `Ideal()` function when the automatically inferred base ring is a field, with the exception of fields that have a `fractional_ideal` method. The latter exception in particular applies to number fields, where the `.ideal()` method is redefined to construct a fractional ideal instead, hence there is a bigger chance that the user actually meant to use `Ideal()` with field elements.

The warning is only triggered when the base ring is not given explicitly: For example, writing `a*R` or `R.ideal(...)` or even `Ideal(R, ...)` will never print the warning, but `Ideal(1/2)` will.

I couldn't really think of any cases where users would actually _want_ to create ideals in fields (outside of basic educational examples), since they're all trivial. Does anyone know situations where this warning would be annoying?

Actually, do we even need the second check? It isn't used in this function.

You mean the `fractional_ideal` check? The point was to not print the warning in situations where `.ideal()` has been redefined to do fractional ideals (see for instance ticket:7596#comment:13). It's quite a hack.

Then shouldn't we also check that ideal is fractional_ideal? Otherwise these could be independent (perhaps because of a bug).

Good point, this is a much better way of doing it. It's totally broken without #32380 though.
