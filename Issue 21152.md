This is a slight tweak to the docbuild code to avoid the overhead of using `multiprocessing.Pool` for a single-process doc build.

On Cygwin particularly the docbuild crashes when using multiprocessing.  This seems to be a Cygwin fork problem.  Nevertheless this simple change makes sense in general (even if single-process doc builds are not common on any other platform).

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/21389

It's not so much that this breaks a single-process build, as single process builds are broken for other reasons outside the scope of this ticket.  For example: #21044

I think maybe this is not a problem without forking if it results in each document being built in a separate process though.  Try this with #21044 and see if that fixes it.

Shouldn't this be in the single-threaded builder also:

```
        try:
            ...
        except Exception:
            if ABORT_ON_ERROR:
                raise
```

I must admit that I don't know its full purpose, but it should be there for consistency.

Other than that, this looks good.
