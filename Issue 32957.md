The patchbot (experimental version that can handle packages) has found a failing doctest 


```
File "src/sage/plot/plot.py", line 1782, in sage.plot.plot.plot
Failed example:
    plot(f, (x, -3.5, 3.5), detect_poles='show', exclude=[-3..3], ymin=-5, ymax=5)
Expected:
    Graphics object consisting of 12 graphics primitives
Got:
    Graphics object consisting of 13 graphics primitives
```


not clear to me if and how this is related to the update here

Builds for me on Ubuntu. It will be good to get this in quickly and tested by the other devs.
