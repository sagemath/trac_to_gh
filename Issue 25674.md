Keywords: sagedays@ICERM

The goal of this project is to implement a new subclass of Tableaux for "increasing tableaux," which are strictly increasing along rows and down columns. 

This will give us a natural home for (currently unimplemented) methods on these objects, such as the K-promotion and K-evacuation of Hugh Thomas--Alex Yong.

Ticket #23678 aims to implement a more general notion for arbitrary posets.


Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/25911

Modified that line at least locally so that I could build and start to test the code.

You'll want to add IncreasingTableau/IncreasingTableaux to the list of things to be imported to the global namespace in `combinat/all.py` . Otherwise, you need to type in 'from sage.combinat.tableau import IncreasingTableaux' every session you want to use it.

Working through the iterator currently.

It didn't like


```
for node in Tableau(active_tab).cells():
                if active_tab[node] == 0:
```


because active tab is a list (of lists), and was being passed a tuple. It was happy when I did


```
for node in Tableau(active_tab).cells():
                if active_tab[node[0]][node[1]] == 0:
```

, though there should be a cleaner way to pass a tuple to nested lists.

Need to add `from sage.misc.misc import powerset` to the imports at the top of `tableau.py` .

For the line `top_value = max(active_tab.values())` , is there some kind of missing `values()` method which is supposed to give the content? Kind of stuck here until that gets resolved.

Additionally, you can get rid of the `cardinality()` method, you only need to explicitly define that if you have a different method of counting the size of the object without using the iterator to generate all of them.

Replying to [comment:5 kdilks]:

> For the line `top_value = max(active_tab.values())` , is there some kind of missing `values()` method which is supposed to give the content? Kind of stuck here until that gets resolved.

`active_tab.values()` should be instead `active_tab.entries()`. (In the poset version, active_tab had been a dictionary and I didn't translate correctly.)

For `descent_set()`, I would give a quick definition, and make a disclaimer indicating that it is more closely related to `standard_descents()` than `descents()` (annoyingly, the parent `Tableau` class has a `descents()` method that is completely different from the descents that we actually look at).

I think when you include a reference in a docstring that you want linked to the appropriate bib item, you need to do [Tag]_ with the underscore after. I also think the convention is to add all references to the global references file, rather than just having local bibliographies.

Do the infinite factory classes really need to ave an explicit list() function raising a not implemented error?

I'll give everything a more thorough look later this week.

I agree that the "not implemented" list() methods seem useless, but SemistandardTableaux had them, so I figured someone must have known something.

I fixed a number of bugs dealing with iteration. In particular, if you fixed a (shape of) size of 0 and a positive `max_entry`, then it would yield multiple `[]`. I added a bunch of tests for corner cases (you're welcome Darij :P) and allowed a `max_entry=0`, which makes sense for empty shapes/sizes. I made the `eval` input more standardized and put a warning that it is not the usual `eval` of a tableau (which caused me some confusion).

I did some streamlining of the element methods (they are faster now):

```
sage: %time for t in IncreasingTableaux(6): tp = t.K_BenderKnuth(2)
CPU times: user 384 ms, sys: 4 ms, total: 388 ms
Wall time: 364 ms

CPU times: user 1.81 s, sys: 0 ns, total: 1.81 s
Wall time: 1.8 s
```

vs your branch

```
sage: %time for t in IncreasingTableaux(6): tp = t.K_BenderKnuth(2)
CPU times: user 440 ms, sys: 32 ms, total: 472 ms
Wall time: 415 ms

CPU times: user 2.16 s, sys: 12 ms, total: 2.17 s
Wall time: 2.16 s
```


There were a number of other misc documentation fixes/tweaks I did. Finally, I renamed `K_BenderKnuth` to `K_bender_knuth` to follow Sage/Python naming conventions (I feel the K is justified as being capitalized as a special exception because of K-theory).

If my changes are good, then positive review.

Still need to look everything over, but there are two minor things noted in Pyflakes from Patchbot. 

One is that line 5124 is unnecessary. In the code for descent_set() , it defines cells = self.cells() and then never uses it, my guess is left over from when code was originally made in the notebook, or when the iteration over all cells was done differently. 

Second is that 'mu' on line 8407 is undefined. Is line 8367 supposed to be `mu = kwargs.get("eval", None)` instead of `wt = kwargs.get("eval", None)` ? And more importantly...is there even an IncreasingSkewTableaux class defined anywhere yet? I feel like this is something that doesn't belong in the code yet.
