The canonical place for GAP packages is https://github.com/gap-packages
(not all GAP packages are there, but most are).

In particular, `nq` is there.

Is it ready for review?


---

Comment by dimpase created at 2018-07-02 08:24:58

It's certainly not ready - one needs to provide means to install it into Sage.

Oh yeah. Enrique, you need to attach your branch to the ticket.

We should discuss if the right way to do this is to create a new sage package, or to add this to `gap_packages`.


---

Comment by dimpase created at 2018-07-02 17:23:51

I don't see why it is not added to gap_packages, but made separate...


---

Comment by enriqueartal created at 2018-07-03 06:31:29

Basically, because I did not want to mess the `gap_packages` package, but I will try to put it in this package. I may have two questions. Is it time to add more packages? Is there a criterion to add functions in `gap_functions.py`?

Come talk to me today, and we will do it then.

A new `gap_packages` has been created. With respect to the former one `QPA` has been downgraded to 1.24 as the tarball has been created with spkg-src.

Why the downgrade in QPA?


---

Comment by tscrim created at 2018-07-03 22:20:55

Everything else LGTM.


---

Comment by tscrim created at 2018-07-03 22:21:13

Changing status from new to needs_info.


---

Comment by enriqueartal created at 2018-07-04 06:24:44

I guess  that QPA 1.25->1.24 is a consequence of the tarball of gap 4.8.6 used in spkg-src; how was the former tarball built?

Really? That doesn't seem right. In 8.3.beta8, it uses QPA 1.25. So this change would be a regression. If the current version is secretly including 1.24, then we should upgrade it to 1.25 while we are changing `gap_packages`. I recall building the previous tarball using `spkg-src`.


---

Comment by enriqueartal created at 2018-07-06 06:19:32

spkg-src points to gap 4.8.6 and this is why qp4-1.24 is present. I agree that qpa-1.25 should be there. I do not know which is the better solution: modify spkg-src or modify manually the tarball.


---

Comment by dimpase created at 2018-07-06 06:44:27

a pedantic comment: if you use packages newer than in GAP 4.8.6 then the minor version should be bumped appropriately.

Problem was that gap version in spkg-src was 4.8.3; it has been corrected and QPA is 1.25 now.


---

Comment by slelievre created at 2018-07-06 11:12:22

Note that installing extra GAP packages should become easier with

- #22626: Upgrade to GAP 4.9

and that there is also a ticket for the (hopefully easier)

- #24427: Upgrade to GAP 4.8.10

but it's not clear if that will happen.

Good catch; thank you. LGTM.

Since finally it changes `gap_packages`, I changed to optional (I do not know if it is necessary to change the status). It will be nice if this process is simplified with `gap 4.10`. And a last comment, is there a non-manual way to change `gap_functions.py`to add functions from packages? If not Miguel Marco explained me a way to add gap functions for a session and it would be an idea to be documented some where.

Comment by enriqueartal created at 2018-07-07 08:19:17

Changing component from packages: experimental to packages: optional.


---

Comment by tscrim created at 2018-07-07 15:25:36

I think it all has to be done manually (currently).


---

Comment by tscrim created at 2018-08-19 02:17:28

Changing priority from minor to major.
