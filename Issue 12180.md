# Issue 12180: Add some tests for the Qhull optional package

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/12352

Keywords: Qhull, polyhedra, polyhedron

At our dear leader's request I am adding a test file for the Qhull optional package.  

This will be quite minimal, since what I'd really like is to add a Qhull backend for the Polyhedron class, which would come with its own tests.  

If anyone is interested in adding more elaborate tests it wouldn't be very hard since the documentation at [the Qhull site](http://www.qhull.org/) is pretty good.

The tests need to be marked with "# optional qhull" or something, since otherwise they fail when this optional package isn't installed.

Since this is just tests and nothing else, why not add this to a `spkg-check` file inside the `qhull` package?

+1. There is no interface being tested or so.

Doesn't `qhull` have a testsuite?

Marking this as "wontfix". The spkg-check of the qhull package (#21143) seems enough.

Determined to be invalid/duplicate/wontfix (closing as "wontfix" as a catch-all resolution).
