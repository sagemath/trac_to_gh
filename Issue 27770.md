Currently sage flattens the threejs directory structure. It still needs to take the actual structure into account when using threejs from a CDN though.

I don't see a reason to flatten the structure. It should be easier for distributions (certainly is for nixos) to keep the structure.

I have only tested this with the nix package, since it is a pain to get the sage build system working on nixos. Would appreciate it if someone else could test the `build/` changes (simple `make ptestlong`).

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28007

What are you installing in nix to find it a burden to change the structure? Because it didn't appear that we are using an upstream tarball I just used sage's one in sage-on-gentoo. Admittedly, I call the package `threejs-sage-extension` and it is installed in a sage related location rather then something more generic.

I am curious of your install procedure and if it make sense for me to follow suite.

Well sage doesn't actually build anything, it just cherry-picks "binaries" (or as close as javascript can come to binaries) from a CDN. If you actually "build" the whole threejs package, you'll end up with the upstream directory structure. I'd need to patch sage or create a separate "interface" package that only symlinks the two files to the places sage expects them.

Yes, but there is value in standardizing the directory structure. While sage only packages threejs for a single purpose, distributions usually have multiple consumers in mind. If every package expects the threejs files in a different place, everyones lives are harder.

I don't really see much of a complication here. Since it makes the `offline` code closer to the one that fetches from the CDN, it may even simplify in the future. But in any case, I don't see any complication for sage.

> > In the context of Three.js this is a bad idea. Upgrades are very often not backward compatible. An upgrade of Three.js should always happen on a separate ticket to be sure the template I wrote still works properly with the new version. Believe me, there were definite issues the last time I did an upgrade. Unless you use Three.js on a regular basis and are certain nothing is broken, please remove this upgrade.

Just attach it to this ticket. Volker does the rest.
