Let's Cythonize the knapsack module `sage/numerical/knapsack.py`. This is in preparation for implementing more algorithms for solving various knapsack problems. The Cythonization proposal was first raised at this [sage-devel](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/ac4b9c0f7f7a1513) thread.

I'll be waiting a LP formulation of the Knapsack problem to help the impatient crowd wait for more efficient functions :-)

( and in the meantime, I send a message to this ticket to be aware of updates :p )
