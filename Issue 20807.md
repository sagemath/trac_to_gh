CC:  @paulmasson @embray @jdemeyer @hivert @egourgoulhon @slel

The Sphinx-generated documentation has index files for modules. E.g. looking at http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/a_tour_of_sage/py-modindex.html

Checking upon the first link in this list, it points to a non-existing page. It seems like as if sphinx doesn't correctly cross link to a sibling. I.e. instead of `/html/en/a_tour_of_sage/...`

http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/a_tour_of_sage/algebras/sage/algebras/affine_nil_temperley_lieb.html#module-sage.algebras.affine_nil_temperley_lieb

it should be `/html/en/reference/...`

http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/algebras/sage/algebras/affine_nil_temperley_lieb.html#module-sage.algebras.affine_nil_temperley_lieb

Upstream (Sphinx) fix:
- pull request: https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/pull/2816
- released in: Sphinx 1.4.6
- corresponding Sphinx upgrade in Sage: #22252

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/21044

As I found [on the mailing list](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/3nl4vQWgWog/qI562OupBAAJ), I encountered this problem in the doctests, with an incorrect link being generated for `sage.rings.padics.tutorial`.

This behavior can be explained in part by [this comment](https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/blob/211fd352ae80f5c901b5c539a7c86348e8941094/sphinx/ext/intersphinx.py#L315) in the `sphinx.ext.intersphinx` source:

```
        # Duplicate values in different inventories will shadow each
        # other; which one will override which can vary between builds
        # since they are specified using an unordered dict.  To make
        # it more consistent, we sort the named inventories and then
        # add the unnamed inventories last.  This means that the
        # unnamed inventories will shadow the named ones but the named
        # ones can still be accessed when the name is specified.
```

In my specific case, entries for `sage.rings.padics.tutorial` are showing up in the `objects.inv` for each of 

```
/home/embray/src/sagemath/sage-cygwin/local/share/doc/sage/html/en/reference/plotting
/home/embray/src/sagemath/sage-cygwin/local/share/doc/sage/html/en/reference/padics
/home/embray/src/sagemath/sage-cygwin/local/share/doc/sage/html/en/reference/plot3d	
```

Since these are stored as keys in a dict the order can nondeterministic.  In my case `plot3d` ends up being last.

What's still mysterious is why `sage.rings.padics.tutorials` would even have reference in the plotting or plot3d docs' objects.inv.  Neither of those documents even reference it.

Incidentally when I run my serial docs build, `plot3d` and `plotting` are built immediately after `padics`.

If I understand the build system right, however, each sub-document should be built in its own sphinx environment.  Yet it seems as if there's some "leaking" between the environments during the initial pass, and this shouldn't happen.
