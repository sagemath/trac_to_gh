I'd also like to point out that the way `F(x,y)` in the code is computed is rather weird and hard to read. A much more straightforward implementation would just be 

`F=lambda x,y: vector(x)*M*vector(y)` 

for `M` the matrix of the form; i.e. do not convert `M` into a dictionary.

(ADDED): you never call `F(x,y)` with x not equal to y, why do you need two arguments?!

you don't believe in linear algebra, do you? :p

How about 

```
def F(x):
   return x*M*x
```

after replacing `M = Matrix(M).dict().items()` with `M = Matrix(M)` ?

And I would also added some tests for `Fq` being of order 2^k

with k>1. This case behaves differently from the odd characteristic case...

No Dima, this ticket does NOT depend on the other, it is the other way around.

You worked on the wrong branch. So now what you should do is checkout the original version of this branch, i.e. u/ncohen/16362, and cherry-pick (git sland for copy) the commits that you added on the wrong branch into where you are.

When this is done, push this new branch (with a -f, because you will be rewriting history) on u/dimpase/16362.

The code is as fast in my version as it is in yours. Your measurements are not correctly done.
Do I need to explain why, again? Or do I need to raise it up on sage-develop? We can do the latter, sure.

 The disadvantage of your code is that it is entirely possible that the pexpect interface gets (half)broken yet again.
Do I need to explain this? Or you just won't listen, because you think you know better?
As well, let me point out that I find your suggestion that you will get rid of my changes in some way that I won't notice very, very worrying. This is not the way things are meant to be done.

And, finally, the design of the these tickets is very suboptimal, anyway, as they should be done with a backend that can take advantage of rich symmetries of the objects. I think I explained this on more than one occasion.
GAP's GRAPE package can easily deal with graphs from this family with 10 times as many vertices as your code here.
That's why I find your worry about a couple of more seconds on startup just funny...

You might be surprised to find how many people find your outburst like this one very immature.

> The code is as fast in my version as it is in yours.

Of course not. Your code has a penalty on first run, mine does not.

(just for the joke: do you also profile cached functions with %timeit ?)

>  The disadvantage of your code is that it is entirely possible that the pexpect interface gets (half)broken yet again.

1) It is not broken (nor even deprecated), until proven otherwise

2) A LOT of code in Sage uses it. If you consider this a bug, write a ticket to address that.

> As well, let me point out that I find your suggestion that you will get rid of my changes in some way that I won't notice very, very worrying. This is not the way things are meant to be done.

You see it wrong again.

Right now, you are trying to force a commit (libgapify) into Sage even though I do not agree with  it (me, the reviewer of your changes). This, indeed, is not the way things are meant to be done. Since when do people add stuff in Sage without getting the agreement of somebody else ? This is precisely what the review process is.

As you refuse discussion on the subject, I can either give up the code of a useful ticket or give in to your blackmail (your libgapify commit Vs my graph constructor) and say that I give your code a positive review.

Admittedly, I prefer this version of the code to no constructor at all.

Secondly, it is fortunate that mistakes in Sage can be fixed, and if another reviewer thinks that it is stupid to lose time for no gain then this will be undone. The review process.

Note how I will have to get the reviewer's agreement while you are just imposing your own view here, when I repeatedly asked to you to remove it and without anybody else's agreement for your commit.

This, clearly, is abnormal.

> And, finally, the design of the these tickets is very suboptimal, anyway, as they should be done with a backend that can take advantage of rich symmetries of the objects. I think I explained this on more than one occasion.

I agree with you, but this backend does not exist in Sage. Did you miss this detail ?

I don't even know how to code such a thing. So if this is a problem for you, stop raving and implement it. I would be glad to have it too.

> You might be surprised to find how many people find your outburst like this one very immature.

The number of people who think that I am immature has no bounds. I definitely remember that I used to care, a long time ago. Fortunately, with time I figured out that they were all crazy, which simplified a lot of things.

No, you are simply misled by %time here. Your startup times only *look* faster, for purely historical reasons, as an instance of GAP on pexpect interface gets loaded and GAP spawned prior to the 1st function call, and %time does not show this extra overhead, but an instance of libGAP gets loaded at the 1st function call.

Anyhow, thanks for rising the point startup time of libGAP. Hopefully it can be improved even if it is still lazily imported.

Let me assure you that you do not want to know the details, really; 
pexpect is known to be flaky, abandoned code which might break with on newer Linux (or other OSes) again, just as it did in the past, as was extensively discussed, worked around (Linux kernel patches were necessary). Using libraries instead of it is a clear way out of this flakiness.

I am not forcing anything. Certainly, you can convince me to change it, or change it yourself. I gave you a number of arguments (readability of the code, robustness) why there is an advantage to use libGAP. You dismissed them all without any reasons, except that "slowdown".

You did not ask me to remove my commit. You asked me to change a part of the code that relies on libGAP, didn't you?
Without listening to any of the arguments I gave you in its favour.

Indeed, what is happening on this ticket is very abnormal, and you might force me to draw attention to it on sage-devel.

By the way : the correct procedure to settle this is the following :

1) Implement this code with the current gap interface, because it is faster and not deprecated, and because 2) and 3) may take forever.

2) Improve libgap

3) Deprecate other calls to gap (which means updating this code too)

SIX MONTHS ?

Change this to two months and it is a deal. I don't put much faith in people telling me "I will do it later". I have #14019 and Florent's "done by next month" 16 months ago.

If you honestly believe that you will do it, you can also accept to use the classical GAP interface and work on 2). When it is done, I see no problem with updating this code.

Your code relies on an assumption, that currently appears to be true (well, at least I think so) that GAP and Sage use the same algorithm, based on Conway polynomials.

I did mention this in comment 4 above.

I am not sure. There are ways to make sure that the same field is used in GAP and in Sage with the classical interface. E.g. get the GAP's defining polynomial:

```
sage: gap.GF(4).DefiningPolynomial()
x_1^2+x_1+Z(2)^0
```

 and use it to create Sage's field.

This discussion DID cost me a couple of hours of sleep, FYI :-)

Useless? You would hate to be able to work with polar graphs on 10000 vertices?

You told me in this comment to add ``conway=True``, which I did. And now you tell me that this may not be correct either.

Same here, but I cannot blame you for giving your point of view.

I don't need it. Do you ? If you do, write a patch. Don't try to make me implement it for you. Again, I don't even know how to do that anyway.

Deal. Today is the 20 of may. On the 20 of July I will send you an email :

1) Either you have a ticket that makes both code equivalent (no startup cost) in `needs_review` and it is a very nice outcome

2) Otherwise, you have in `needs_review` (that I will review) to undo those changes.

Also : don't tell me two months later that you were on holidays in July. You know it now, you know what to expect.
