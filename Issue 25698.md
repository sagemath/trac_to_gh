`AbelianGroup_class` inherits its `__hash__` from `UniqueRepresentation` but it has a different `__eq__`:

```
__eq__ = is_isomorphic
```


Either we should remove that special `__eq__` or we should make `__hash__` consistent with `__eq__`.

Well, I removed `__eq__` and `__ne__` and there were only a few doctest failures. So I say we go this route.

I'll mark this as "needs review", but feel free to disagree with the approach.

I agree with the proposal, but we'll need to see if it passes tests.

Note that I did not add `__hash__ = UniqueRepresentation.__hash__`. That can wait until a Python 3 focused ticket, like #24551.

There shouldn't be a reason for that.
