CC:  @jhpalmieri

`AbelianGroup_class` inherits its `__hash__` from `UniqueRepresentation` but it has a different `__eq__`:

```
__eq__ = is_isomorphic
```


Either we should remove that special `__eq__` or we should make `__hash__` consistent with `__eq__`.

Well, I removed `__eq__` and `__ne__` and there were only a few doctest failures. So I say we go this route.
