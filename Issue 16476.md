# Issue 16476: Random failure in lseries_ell.py

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/16713

Original creator: vbraun

Original creation time: 2014-07-25 04:51:31

CC:  jdemeyer leif was

Keywords: random_fail

This is a somewhat regular occurrence on mod:

```
sage -t --long src/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/lseries_ell.py
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/lseries_ell.py", line 243, in sage.schemes.elliptic_curves.lseries_ell.Lseries_ell.zeros
Failed example:
    E.lseries().zeros(2)
Expected:
    [0.000000000, 5.00317001]
Got:
      ***   Warning: not enough memory, new stack 1000000000.
    [0.000000000, 5.00317001]
```

There seems to be plenty of free space. Obviously there is enough memory to finish the computation and arrive at the correct result, so there shouldn't be any warning printed. Related tickets that patched up similar issues:
* Trac #11985: lcalc is too verbose (mysterious "Warning: new stack size")
* Trac #14470: Relax PARI warnings

Changing keywords from "random_fail" to "random_fail pari lcalc".

Well, 8.04 is out of LTS... ;-)

Did anybody else face this on another system / platform?

I'll keep an eye out for it... Still, it doesn't look like a compiler bug.

Let's hope that this problem disappears with #15767.

Has this happened recently? We upgraded PARI several times in the mean time...
