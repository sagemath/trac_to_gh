This is a somewhat regular occurrence on mod:

```
sage -t --long src/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/lseries_ell.py
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/lseries_ell.py", line 243, in sage.schemes.elliptic_curves.lseries_ell.Lseries_ell.zeros
Failed example:
    E.lseries().zeros(2)
Expected:
    [0.000000000, 5.00317001]
Got:
      ***   Warning: not enough memory, new stack 1000000000.
    [0.000000000, 5.00317001]
```

There seems to be plenty of free space. Obviously there is enough memory to finish the computation and arrive at the correct result, so there shouldn't be any warning printed. Related tickets that patched up similar issues:
