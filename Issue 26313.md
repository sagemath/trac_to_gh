Sadly this release still doesn't include sage's patch defining and using `UndefSage`. I am guessing it is still necessary.

And that's the only thing failing if you stick to plain unpatched sympy-1.3

```
sage -t --long /usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/sage/interfaces/sympy.py
**********************************************************************

which is of course what the patch fixes.
