Keywords: Kac-Moody

Integrable representations of Kac-Moody Lie algebras are parametrized by dominant weights. They satisfy a character formula which is a straightforward generalization of the Weyl character formula. See Kac, Infinite-dimensional Lie algebras, Chapter 10. The affine case is an important special case that was developed in connection with string theory. Since (in this affine case) generating functions for the weight dimensions may be modular forms there are all sorts of connections and it would be good to have this in Sage. It should be straighforward to write such code, and that is the purpose of this ticket.
I am unsure at this point whether to implement only the affine case or the general Kac-Moody case.

Hey Dan,

I don't know how much of #14901 you might be able to use, but if you want to use parts of it here, let me know and I can split off the necessary portions.

Also I'd like to see the general Kac-Moody case if it's not too much more work.

Best,

Travis

Mainly what I need is the weight lattice and its invariant inner product. In the affine case, what is in `weight_lattice_realizations.py` is not what is needed because this describes the weight lattice for the derived Lie algebra.

I agree that it is very desirable to have the general KM case. Can your code compute the multiplicities of the imaginary roots?

There's currently the extended weight space:

```
sage: P = RootSystem(['A', 3, 1]).weight_space(extended=True)
sage: P.basis()
Finite family {0: Lambda[0], 1: Lambda[1], 2: Lambda[2], 3: Lambda[3], 'delta': delta}
sage: P.simple_root(2).scalar(P.simple_coroot(1))
-1
sage: P.simple_root(2).scalar(P.simple_coroot(2))
2
sage: P.simple_root(2).scalar(P.null_coroot())
0
sage: P.basis()['delta'].scalar(P.simple_coroot(0))
0
sage: P.basis()['delta'].scalar(P.simple_coroot(3))
0
sage: P.basis()['delta'].scalar(P.null_coroot())
0
```

and that doesn't that work?

In principle, my code can compute multiplicities of imaginary root space of the KM algebra (once I fix the finitely-presented Lie algebras).

Okay, I've made some major optimization progress and now it takes half the time as previously. This was mainly achieved by being smart about the computation in `_freudenthal_accum` as to avoid doing multiple vector additions. The downside is this is also more obscure as code. I also did a bunch of other speedups on a smaller scale using little tricks I know and some timings.

I've also some cleanup of the code. In particular, I changed the interface so that `depth` is something passed to the `string` argument rather than as part of the representation's construction data.

The biggest thing I would want to be changed is that `dominant_maximal` should not need `string` to be called (with some reasonable depth) in order to be computed. Thus if this could be done as a stand-alone, we could cache this, and at the very least, it would mean one less call to `string` in `strings`.

I'm going to hack away at it a bit more tonight to see what other optimizations I might be able to get out of this.

Continuing from previous comment:

Proposition 12.6 describes the dominant maximal weights as follows. They depend only on two things: the level `k` (currently implemented as `self.level()` and a coset of the weight lattice in the root lattice (called the class in KMPS). So different representations with the same level and class will have the same number of dominant maximal weights, and the same number of strings.

The weight lattice P has the classical weight lattice P0 of codimension two. It is obtained from P0 by adjoining Lambda[0] and the nullroot delta. The projection of the dominant maximal weights onto P0 has a simple description. Let F be the fundamental alcove, and let `k F` be the dilation of F by the level. So it is bounded by the innequalities `alphacheck[i] >= 0` for i nonzero, and `alphacheck[0] <= k`, where `alphacheck[0]` is the negative of the highest classical root.

Then the projections of the dominant maximal roots into P0 are just the elements of `k F` that are in the right coset of the root lattice. If these are known, then I don't think it will be difficult to recover the dominant maximal roots. I believe that only the method `dominant_maximal` needs to be reimplemented.

Here's some code which to get all weights in the `lvl`-dilated dominant chamber:

```
sage: P = RootSystem(['A',4,1]).weight_lattice(extended=True)
sage: La = P.fundamental_weights()
sage: lvl = 3
sage: def next_level(wt):
    return [wt + la for la in La if (wt+la).level() < lvl]
....: 
sage: R = RecursivelyEnumeratedSet([P.zero()], next_level)
sage: list(R)
[0,
 Lambda[2],
 Lambda[4],
 Lambda[1],
 Lambda[3],
 Lambda[0],
 Lambda[3] + Lambda[4],
 2*Lambda[0],
 Lambda[2] + Lambda[4],
 2*Lambda[1],
 Lambda[2] + Lambda[3],
 Lambda[1] + Lambda[2],
 Lambda[1] + Lambda[3],
 Lambda[1] + Lambda[4],
 2*Lambda[2],
 Lambda[0] + Lambda[4],
 Lambda[0] + Lambda[1],
 Lambda[0] + Lambda[3],
 Lambda[0] + Lambda[2],
 2*Lambda[4],
 2*Lambda[3]]
```

if you just want the classical fundamental weights, then do:

```
sage: La = [P.fundamental_weight(i) for i in P.index_set() if i != 0]
sage: R = RecursivelyEnumeratedSet([P.zero()], next_level)
sage: list(R)
[0,
 Lambda[2],
 Lambda[4],
 Lambda[1],
 Lambda[3],
 Lambda[3] + Lambda[4],
 Lambda[2] + Lambda[4],
 2*Lambda[1],
 Lambda[2] + Lambda[3],
 Lambda[1] + Lambda[2],
 Lambda[1] + Lambda[3],
 Lambda[1] + Lambda[4],
 2*Lambda[2],
 2*Lambda[4],
 2*Lambda[3]]
```

I'm not sure how to check if it's in the right coset off-hand.

> I'm not sure how to check if it's in the right coset off-hand.

This is how I think it goes. Add a multiple of Lambda[0] to give it the right level.
Then apply `from_weight`. If it does not give integers, discard. Then subtract the
smallest multiple of delta that makes `(Lambda+rho|Lambda+rho)-(mu+rho|mu+rho)`
positive.

I will try to implement this using `RecursivelyEnumeratedSet` as you suggest.

In the example from comment:57 the coefficients are actually those from the cube root of j.


```
sage: R.<q>=PowerSeriesRing(QQ)
sage: j = j_invariant_qexp(5); j
q^-1 + 744 + 196884*q + 21493760*q^2 + 864299970*q^3 + 20245856256*q^4 + O(q^5)

Playing around with oeis gives occasional interpretations of characters and string functions.


```

sage: V = IntegrableRepresentation(Lambda[0])
sage: [x.degree() for x in V.branch(depth=10)]

theta functions.
sage: V.string(Lambda[0])

In #20686, I will mark `TestSuite(V).run()` as `# known bug` because `IntegrableRepresentation` does not properly implement everything needed for its category. For example, it does not implement `zero()`.

These problems were not seen before simply because the category tests were not run. #20686 ensures that the correct tests are run, but then they fail for `IntegrableRepresentation`.
