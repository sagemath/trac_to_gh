Keywords: hecke triangle group coercion

This ticket adds support for coercions from form spaces/rings over the full
modular group to form spaces/rings over the Theta subgroup (which are both
Hecke triangle groups). In all other cases coercions between groups are disabled
since there is no "nice" common subgroup.


Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/17261

Hi

Hmm, running "make clean; make doc-clean; make" worked for me.
I'm a bit hesitant to rebase since I have a lot of work based on this branch.
Is it 100% save to rebase? What would be the exact command?
How would I propagate this change to the other dependent branches?

I could merge 6.6.beta3 instead?

Best
Jonas

It should be straight-forward, it's just that someone has to review it before it gets applied...

As a summary:

Before there were no relations (coercions) between spaces over different groups but actually for certain groups (namly infinity and 3) there is a (canonical) relation. For this case I modified it such that it coerces elements accordingly.
