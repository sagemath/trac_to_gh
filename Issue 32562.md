This is the minimum to do vanilla sage. I have already endorsed the approach in principle months ago. I am not sure I would check `MPMATH_SAGE` first since I'd always want it to be `1`, unless I explicitly want to break things.

I would like more opinion on that one because not providing a way to override is contentious.

I agree with that. If I knew how to do it, there would already be a ticket for it ready to review. The stuff I tried didn't work, the only things I can think of require cooperation from mpmath devs.

No, because it is too late to set an environment variable. You are already in the application and it is run with the variables it was launched with. You would need a python variable to tell `mpmath` that it has been imported from `sage`.
