New patch with various improvements.  Most importantly: improved documentation, removed unused parameter `extend` of `any_root`, which caused a doctest failure.

I already reviewed David's code and did not really touch this part apart for a few fixes.

I also agree with Peter's changes.

Everything seems to work fine, but note that if I test this on top of #14888, then two doctests fail.
I think we should make this one depend on #14888, does anyone disagree?
If we go this way, this should get positive review.

That makes sense, since #14888 already has a positive review and we would have to change one or the other anyway.

Those were also the doctest failures I was getting, so I am happy with the fixes and the positive review.
