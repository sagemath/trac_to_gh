The spkg at

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mabshoff/release-cycles-3.1.2/rc4/python-2.5.2.p6.spkg

fixes both issues.

Cheers,

Michael

I have tested without SAGE_VALGRIND set, mabshoff has tested with SAGE_VALGRIND. Looks like everything works. I've been waiting for SAGE_VALGRIND for months, so I say yes!
