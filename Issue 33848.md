I agree with your changes.

May be you could unify changes in these blocks: `abs(cr["cr"])-1)` versus `abs(cr["cr"]) - 1)`

```diff
+                if (v[j]*2-1)*sgn(cr["cr"]) == -1:  # oriented resolution
+                    G.add_edge((j, cr["next_above"], abs(cr["cr"])-1), (j, 1))
+                    G.add_edge((cr["prev_above"], j, abs(cr["cr"])-1), (j, 1))
+                    G.add_edge((j, cr["next_below"], abs(cr["cr"])), (j, 3))
+                    G.add_edge((cr["prev_below"], j, abs(cr["cr"])), (j, 3))
                 else:
-                    G.add_edge((j, cr["next_above"], abs(cr["cr"])-1) ,(j,0))
-                    G.add_edge((j, cr["next_below"], abs(cr["cr"])), (j,0))
-                    G.add_edge((cr["prev_above"], j, abs(cr["cr"])-1), (j,2))
-                    G.add_edge((cr["prev_below"], j, abs(cr["cr"])), (j,2))
+                    G.add_edge((j, cr["next_above"], abs(cr["cr"]) - 1), (j, 0))
+                    G.add_edge((j, cr["next_below"], abs(cr["cr"])), (j, 0))
+                    G.add_edge((cr["prev_above"], j, abs(cr["cr"]) - 1), (j, 2))
```
