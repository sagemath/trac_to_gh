# Issue 21824: Don't hard-code the path to thebe.js

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/22061

Original creator: embray

Currently the path to thebe.js is hard-coded in the form of a symlink relative to the doc source.  Eventually one might want to be able to use this from an OS package instead, and not assume it's in `$SAGE_LOCAL`.

This can be viewed as a follow-up to #15105
