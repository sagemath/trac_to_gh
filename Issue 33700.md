Failing example:


```sage
T = polygen(GF(23))
F.<t> = GF(23^4, modulus=T^4+T+2)

x = polygen(F)
f = x^3 - t
K.<u> = f.splitting_field()

y = polygen(K)
g = y^2 - u
L.<v> = g.splitting_field()

assert L(u).minpoly() == u.minpoly()
```

Maybe use the new syntax

```
sage: GF((13,11))
Finite Field in z11 of size 13^11
```

in the doctests ?

Perhaps, when I wrote the comment, I assumed `E` is always Conway since Sage chooses a Conway polynomial by default if the input just specifies the size.  

Apparently, I thought wrong at the time or things have changed and the assumption no longer holds...

Looks good to me.

By the way, I think the rule for this is that specifying a variable name makes it use whatever suitable polynomial it can find, whereas omitting the name will trigger computation of a Conway polynomial (and use the familiar `z2`,`z3`,... names).

Right. So I missed the case when a name is specified.
