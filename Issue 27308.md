The pickle `cluster_algebra_quiver/mutation_classes_%s.dig6` currently depends on the Python version: pickles created with Python 3 cannot be opened with Python 2.

There are multiple solutions to this, such as ensuring that a pickle is always stored in a compatible version. But since these pickles are optional, a simpler solution is simply ignoring unpickling errors.

This has been a frequent source of annoyance for me as well.  Personally I would prefer to have different versions of the file depending on the Python version.  But at the same time most users won't be using Python 2 Sage and Python 3 Sage together on the same system, and even if we did do that, ignoring unpickle errors here would still be desirable.  This is just a cache and regenerating the cache if needed is no big deal since it does not take so long.
