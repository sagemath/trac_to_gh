# Issue 27924: Make _number_field_from_algebraics() return a dynamical system

The current function for dynamical system inherits from schemeMorphism_polynomial and doesn't return a dynamical system object.  


```
P.<x,y>=ProjectiveSpace(QQbar,1)
f=DynamicalSystem_projective([x^2 + QQbar(sqrt(2))*y^2, y^2])
f._number_field_from_algebraics()
```

This looks fine to me. I updated the docs though. So if that update is fine with you, go ahead and mark this positive.
