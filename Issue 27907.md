Although we can use the `_latex_` method in an object in order to get a latex version of the object, at times it would be beneficial to additionally have a TikZ implementation.

As an example, the following plot

`latex(line([(0,0), (1,1)]))`

produces massive amounts of latex for something that is relatively easily done through tikz.

Implementing tikz alongside latex also has its benefits as in some instances, some users do not like to use tikz. This would help handle this situtation.

Therefore, we have decided to replicate the `latex` function and create a `tikz` function that looks for `_tikz_` method in objects and executes them where appropriate.
