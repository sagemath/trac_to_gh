# Issue 31802: Change "and over" to "over" in _repr_() of (boundary) modular symbols

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/32039

Original creator: pbruin

Original creation time: 2021-06-23 10:07:48

There is a spurious "and" in the second output below:

```
sage: ModularSymbols(Gamma0(11), 2)
Modular Symbols space of dimension 3 for Gamma_0(11) of weight 2 with sign 0 over Rational Field
sage: ModularSymbols(Gamma1(11), 2)
Modular Symbols space of dimension 11 for Gamma_1(11) of weight 2 with sign 0 and over Rational Field
```

positive review once the patchbot is green

suggestion for other tickets: use unicode ‚Ñæ, ‚Ñæ‚ÇÄ, ‚Ñæ‚ÇÅ for the repr of the Gamma congruence groups

Nice suggestion!  Or perhaps Œì (Greek capital letter Gamma) or ùõ§ (mathematical italic capital Gamma)?
