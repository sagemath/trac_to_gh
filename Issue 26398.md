Keywords: local-components

Some while ago, I contributed to Sage some code for computing the local component (at a given prime) of the automorphic representation attached to a modular form, based on algorithms from a paper I wrote with Jared Weinstein.

The existing implementation is incomplete in several ways:
- it throws an error if the given modular form doesn't have minimal level at p among its character twists;
- if the local component is supercuspidal, induced from a character of a ramified quadratic extension, then it doesn't completely compute the character, it just returns a string saying which extension it comes from;
- in supercuspidal 2-adic cases where the level is divisible by 64, it fails because a certain quotient group that comes up in the computation isn't cyclic.

I have now reworked the code to fill in all of the above gaps. It should now work for all newforms and all primes, with the exception of certain nasty 2-adic cases where no nice parametrisation exists.
