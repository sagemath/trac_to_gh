I think it is better style to write

```
            (e, c), = d.items()
```

instead of

```
            e, c = next(iter(d.items()))
```

to get the *unique* element of some iterator.

Replying to [comment:3 chapoton]:
> but d.items() is not an iterator in python3

I meant *iterable* and that should be case for Python 2 and Python 3.

And for `list(sequence)[:n]`, I would suggest instead `islice(sequence, n)` (with `from itertools import islice`)
