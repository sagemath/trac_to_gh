This applies fine to 4.6.2.a1. It passes sage -testall except for an unrelated failure in the R interface module. As far as I can see, the code and docstrings look very good.

I'm going to test it on another machine.

If this does not apply properly, try 4.7.alpha1, plus #10871, #10920, where I have checked that it does apply.
