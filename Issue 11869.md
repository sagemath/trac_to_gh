# Issue 11869: Replace __getslice__ with functionality in __getitem__ in several files

Issue created by migration from Trac.

`__getslice__` has been deprecated for a long time in Python.  This patch adds equivalent functionality to `__getitem__`, which is where the functionality should be.

I have been waiting for this for a long time. I would have done it myself but I don't have the know-how. I'll check you have done everything. I actually thought some of these bits were dead code.

Could you do these files as well:

If it's okay I will do this later in another ticket. So it should be easier to review.

BTW. these files don't contain any `__*slice__` function

```
sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_gf2x.pyx
sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_zmod_flint.pyx
sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_zz_pex.pyx
```

I would be OK with that. I confess I didn't manually check all the files. I think it is because they include the following file:polynomial_template.pxi which does have "slice".

The title of the ticket is replace getslice in several files, not "all files" so I am inclined to give this a positive review in that any work on this is good. But more work will be needed in this area.
