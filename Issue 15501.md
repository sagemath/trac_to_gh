There have been a lot of changes to eclib since the version 2012-830 in Sage-6.0.  A lot of these are minor improvements and small bugfixes not all relevant to Sage.  There is a new optional dependency on Flint (requiring Flint >=2.3) and an optional dependency on boost to parallelise some code not currently wrapped in Sage (a contribution by Warwick MSc student Marcus Mo).  For details see https://github.com/JohnCremona/eclib.

The new tarball is sagemath:/home/cremona/eclib-2014-01-26.tar.gz .  Very few changes will be needed to the spkg-install script, and the ECLIB dependency in build/deps will have FLINT added as a  new dependency.  There may be some cosmetic adjustments to doctest outputs necessary.

OK, ready for review again.  The last commit was necessary not because I had forgotten, but because I did actually change the upstream tarball.  The one on sagemath is the right one -- note that I did change the version from 20140126 to 20140128 too.

I built this ok with SAGE_CHECK=yes and also ran all doctests including the long ones.

The self-test which eclib runs does not work perfectly when done with a lot of parallel threads owing (I presume) to race conditions.  I had errors with MAKE set to "make -j50" but none without the -j50 tag.  I think this was true before, so hope it will not be seen as a problem.

Are you open to bug reports about that? I have had a quick look and the problem seems to be that most programs are actually built *twice* in `make check` (check the logs, you will see for example `tmrank` is built twice, which can obviously be a race condition if that happens twice at the same time).

Of course I am open to bug reports!   It's up to you whether you think they are reasons not to include this version in Sage.  But if easily fixed, now would be a good time to fix them.

I know of no reason ahy any test program should be built twice.  If I delete etsts/tmrank and type "make tmrank" I see this:

```
/bin/bash ../libtool --tag=CXX   --mode=link g++  -g -O2 -L/usr/local/lib   -L/usr/lib  -o tmrank tmrank.o  ../libsrc/libec.la -lflint -lpari -lntl -lboost_system-mt -lboost_thread

```

but surely that is only one build?

Apart from building, some of the tests will only work properly if the are run in the correct sequence since one writes a temporary files which another needs to read.  So far this has worked ok, but it would be possible to change the target `check_g0n` in tests/Makefile.am to forece them to run in order.  That would be easy, in fact.
