What is the rationale?

(1) Setting Singular ring is not expensive anymore.

(2) `have_ring` is not set `True` anywhere in Sage, and practically not used.

(3) Both.

Me neither.

> There could be remaining things still using the singular pexpect interface, maybe.

It seems code like `_singular_(singular).set_ring()` is using the singular pexpect interface. It is really expensive. On my system, it takes about 100 microsecond. Hence those comments are still relevant. Sorry...
