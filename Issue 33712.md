What is the rationale?

(1) Setting Singular ring is not expensive anymore.

(2) `have_ring` is not set `True` anywhere in Sage, and practically not used.

(3) Both.

I think the second point holds:

<pre>git grep -h &quot;have_ring\s*=&quot; src/
    def _singular_(self, singular=singular_default, <font color="#FF5555"><b>have_ring=</b></font>False, force=False):
        return self._singular_init_(singular, <font color="#FF5555"><b>have_ring=</b></font>have_ring)
    def _singular_init_(self, singular=singular_default, <font color="#FF5555"><b>have_ring=</b></font>False, force=False):
    def _singular_(self, singular=singular_default, <font color="#FF5555"><b>have_ring=</b></font>False):
    def _singular_(self, singular=singular, <font color="#FF5555"><b>have_ring=</b></font>False):
    def _singular_init_func(self, singular=singular, <font color="#FF5555"><b>have_ring=</b></font>False):
def _singular_func(self, singular=singular, <font color="#FF5555"><b>have_ring=</b></font>False):
#    return self._singular_init_(singular, <font color="#FF5555"><b>have_ring=</b></font>have_ring)
    return _singular_init_func(self, singular, <font color="#FF5555"><b>have_ring=</b></font>have_ring)
def _singular_init_func(self, singular=singular, <font color="#FF5555"><b>have_ring=</b></font>False):
    def _singular_(self, singular=singular_default, <font color="#FF5555"><b>have_ring=</b></font>False):
    def _singular_(self, G=None, <font color="#FF5555"><b>have_ring=</b></font>False):
    def _singular_init_(self, <font color="#FF5555"><b>have_ring=</b></font>False):
</pre>

#2331 seems to say that before libSingular, `set_ring()` was expensive, and `have_ring` option was useful, but after libSingular, `set_ring()` is a breeze, and `have_ring` is useless.

Hence you can also delete the comment `# this is expensive`...

I removed the comments, although I am not totally convinced that we use libsingular everywhere. There could be remaining things still using the singular pexpect interface, maybe.

Me neither.

It seems code like `_singular_(singular).set_ring()` is using the singular pexpect interface. It is really expensive. On my system, it takes about 100 microsecond. Hence those comments are still relevant. Sorry...
