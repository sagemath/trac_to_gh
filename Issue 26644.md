Well, I find it suspect that OrderedDict does not display in the given order in py2..

But let us keep that for another ticket..

I still get

```
sage -t --long src/sage/repl/attach.py  # 4 doctests failed
```

namely

```

I don't get that `attach.py` tests pass (as the whole module) in `py2` and `py3` on my computers. Do you use optional modules ?

indeed, the tests pass when run alone on the patchbot machine and another machine. So they only fail in the patchbot run.

Note that the failures seems to be a shift in the answers: each doctests receives the output of the previous doctest..
