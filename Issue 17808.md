# Issue 17808: Wrong result returned by is_planar on a given embedding

Issue created by migration from Trac.

As reported on AskSage [1], the function `.is_planar` can return wrong results when given a specific embedding to run its computations on.

This actually comes from a mistake in a `if/else` and variable types, as `bool(a_dictionary)` returns `True` when the dictionary is nonempty. The original authors did not seem to be aware of that, and once fixed the code does not mak the mistake again.

One bug less in Sage! Cool!

Could you replace `(see eg's)` by `(see examples)`. It is very wrong as "e.g." is a latin abbreviation for "for example".
