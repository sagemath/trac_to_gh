As discussed on [this sage-devel thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/e48IruDu7Kg) it would be nice to have pip as a package.

English remarks:

 - "This package install pip." --> "This package installs pip."

- "Custom license compatible GPLv3+." --> "Custom license that is compatible with GPLv3+."

This looks good to me, but I can't even figure out how to review tickets anymore.

How is it supposed to work?

```
novoselt`@`sage:~/sage$ sage -i pip
Found local metadata for pip-1.5.6

Doing `sage -i pip` after this successful download but failed installation works.

Hi Andrey,

You should first download pip from the link in the description of the ticket. Then you have to put it in SAGE_ROOT/upstream/. Then you can do the command you tried.

Best,
Vincent

OK, positive review in this case. Are we going to actually make this a standard package?

What do you mean by "custom license" in SPKG.txt, its MIT according to pypi.
