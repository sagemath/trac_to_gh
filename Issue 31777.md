One way of dealing with these kinds of merge conflicts is to set the "Dependencies" field to #30698, and rebase this branch on the branch there. Once the tickets are ready to be merged, this clearly indicates the merge order. It may mean that the branch here must be merged with further developments on the other branch. It's actually a practical reason *not* to split tickets you're working on, if they are mainly touching the same file.

You can also hope that git's standard merge tools recognize you're touching different lines in the same file and hence merge without reporting conflicts (logically, the changes on the tickets are orthogonal, so the dependence would really be for practical reasons)

If you look at the ticket description, you can see that the branch is displayed in red, and if you hover over it, you see "trac's automerging failed". If plain merging by git gives no problem, this indicates that trac tries a merge with particularly conservative and sage settings. However, I think you'll at least have to make sure that trac can do the merge, because otherwise reviewers have a harder time seeing what's happening on the ticket.

(I suspect the problem is that the current branch makes changes to an ancestor of "develop" that end up identical to what eventually happens in "develop", but are proposed separately. It would for instance mean that the "blame" of the relevant lines would be ambiguous.
