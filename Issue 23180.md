# Issue 23180: fast construction of symbolic sums

Issue created by migration from Trac.

In `legendre_P::eval_pari` there is this:

```
return sum(b * arg**a for a, b in enumerate(pol))
```

Due to `GiNaC::add::eval` mechanics it has quadratic performance, fortunately eased by smart pointer operations. Much better however would be to have the iterator add to an `GiNaC::epvector` and construct the `GiNaC::add` from that. The obvious internal Pynac code just needs an interface in `libs/pynac` and this then used by `legendre_P::eval_pari`.
