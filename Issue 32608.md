Even after using `pyjion.config(pgc=False)`, running the test suite gives a number of errors like

```
    pyjion.PyjionUnboxingError: Optimizations are invalid. Pyjion PGC expected float, but 1 is a int. Try disabling PGC pyjion.config(pgc=False) or lowering the optimization level to avoid hitting this error.
```

Probably should only enable it if some environment variable is set (going through `sage.env`), and should note it in the banner instead of a warning.
