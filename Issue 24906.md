I believe this issue can reasonably be addressed for Sage 8.4.

There is a trivial conflict with #25567 and I prefer to merge #25567 first.

Don't you think that we can remove checks like `[ -f Makefile ]`? They seem like superfluous sanity checks.

Would it make sense to just incorporate this directly into #25567?  Otherwise, I'm fine to just rebase on top of that.  I'm happy to remove superfluous sanity checks.  In the past I feel like I've been discouraged from doing so because "it was there for a reason" but I don't remember if that was you or someone else.  Maybe it was just one case where it really was there for a reason...

I don't mind whether the `[ -f Makefile ]` checks stays or goes away. Otherwise, feel free to set this to positive review.

I am not sure about the conflict with #25567, I guess whatever has positive review and passes the buildbot (which is probably harder for #25567) goes in. I don't think it's harder to rebase one or the other. But that's up to you guys.

Retargeting some of my tickets (somewhat optimistically for now).
