# Issue 12332: the gfan SPKG.txt has the wrong copyright statement

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/12504

That said, it would be good to change the line in *our* SPKG.txt for gfan that says:

"== License ==
 * GPL v2"

This line was added in 2010 by Alex Ghitza and positively reviewed by Marshal Hampton.  They claimed to be dealing with trac #3043 (from 4 years ago) which specifically asked for clarification of this.  The first comment on trac #3043 was by Michael Abshoff (who has actually read the GPL) where he explained very clearly exactly how things work with GPL, and that the software is clearly GPLv2+.  Then Alex completely ignored/misinterpreted Michael's remark...

The current procedure for changing SPKGs on Trac is to actually post the complete SPKG, not just the patch.
