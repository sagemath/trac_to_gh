# Issue 15454: mip backends: bug due to bool/number confusion

Issue created by migration from Trac.

(I only have the GLPK backend installed, so I actually only tested with that.)

In all the mip backends, the methods `variable_upper_bound` and `variable_lower_bound` contain essentially the statement `value == False`.
This causes it to be impossible to set variable bounds to 0.0, as `0.0 == False` is `True`.

Illustrated in the console:


```
sage: version()
'Sage Version 6.0, Release Date: 2013-12-17'

sage: p = MixedIntegerLinearProgram()
sage: p.set_objective(p[0])
sage: p.show()
Maximization:
  x_0
Constraints:
Variables:
  x_0 is a continuous variable (min=0.0, max=+oo)

sage: p.set_max(p[0], 0.0) # fails
sage: p.show()
Maximization:
  x_0
Constraints:
Variables:
  x_0 is a continuous variable (min=0.0, max=+oo)
```


A simple fix is to replace all(?) occurrences of `value == False` by `value is False`.

Well, if you want to review a patch why don't you try #14581 ? I can fix bugs but I cannot review the patch myself `:-P`

Thanks, I'm putting this on my to-do list. I'm right away going to inform myself on how to best perform the development process on my distribution.

Okayyyyyyy ! I can try to help to some extent (I don't know how to use the dev scripts for instance, I just git directly) so you can email me if you need. Otherwise sage-git and the developer's manual should answer everything `:-)`
