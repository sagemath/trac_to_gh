# Issue 31224: Fix tests formatting in `graphs/generators/families.py`

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31461

Original creator: slelievre

Original creation time: 2021-03-07 18:32:57

CC:  dcoudert @ninakl @vipul79321 slelievre

Keywords: tests

After #30728, some test blocks have `TESTS:` instead of `TESTS::`.

The tests in those blocks are in fact never doctested due to that.

Should I also fix cases where we have `some text. ::` instead of `some text::` ? it can also be done in another ticket.

Thanks for fixing this.  You can set to positive review on my behalf when the patchbot is green.

I don't think `some text. ::` should be changed unless there is a problem in a particular case (or there is a sage style convention about this). There is nothing wrong with using this style as far as sphinx is concerned: [this sphinx web page](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html) says "The handling of the :: marker is smart: ... If it is preceded by whitespace, the marker is removed." So `some text. ::` will show up as a paragraph that ends with a period, instead of a colon, and that seems ok to me.
