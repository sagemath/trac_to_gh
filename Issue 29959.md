Keywords: manifold, discrete, differential geometry

- A new type to model discrete k-forms for (0 <= k <= n) on a simplicial complex of dimension n.
- A k-form is a function from the k-dimensional faces of the simplicial complex to a Z-module R.
- The exterior derivative operator d to integrate a k-form to build a (k+1)-form over a simplicial complex
- A chain complex structure for the collection of differential forms over a simplicial complex. [https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/homology/sage/homology/chain_complex.html](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/homology/sage/homology/chain_complex.html)
