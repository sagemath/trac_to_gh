From the bug reporter spreadsheet and [this sage-support thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/sage-support/oEgjsfBoK30):

```
solve(sin(x)/cos(x)==1,x,to_poly_solve='force')

This gives an empty list.  I know it has at least one solution, namely pi/4.
```

Note that `to_poly_solve=True` does work.
