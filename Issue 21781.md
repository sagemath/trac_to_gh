# Issue 21781: Some debug(?) message when solving an inequality

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: pelegm

Original creation time: 2016-12-03 19:08:16

Keywords: solve,sage_var,inequality

Try this:

```python
sage: solve(sqrt(x^3)!=0, x)
#0: solve_rat_ineq(ineq=sqrt(_SAGE_VAR_x^3) # 0)
[This is the Trac macro *x != 0* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#x != 0-macro)
```


What's that? (tested on 7.5.beta4)
