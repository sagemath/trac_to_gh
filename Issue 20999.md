As noted on #20961, pycryto compilation fails with the following error:

```
In file included from src/SHA256.c:35:0:
src/hash_SHA2.h:91:9: error: unknown type name 'U32'
typedef U32 sha2_word_t;
         ^
In file included from src/SHA256.c:72:0:
src/hash_SHA2_template.c:175:38: error: unknown type name 'U8'
hash_update (hash_state *self, const U8 *buf, int len)
                                      ^
In file included from src/hash_SHA2_template.c:199:0,
                 from src/SHA256.c:72:
```

(This is a separate failure from #20961.)
