As noted on #20961, pycryto compilation fails with the following error:

```
In file included from src/SHA256.c:35:0:
src/hash_SHA2.h:91:9: error: unknown type name 'U32'
typedef U32 sha2_word_t;
         ^
In file included from src/SHA256.c:72:0:
src/hash_SHA2_template.c:175:38: error: unknown type name 'U8'
hash_update (hash_state *self, const U8 *buf, int len)
                                      ^
In file included from src/hash_SHA2_template.c:199:0,
                 from src/SHA256.c:72:
```

(This is a separate failure from #20961.)

This is not an issue on Cygwin64.

pycrypto also built fine for my on Cygwin64.

I'm putting all Cygwin 32 tickets in "sage-wishlist" just because, while it would be nice to have, it might be beyond reach right now.

Changing keywords from "" to "cygwin32".

It's not clear we need pycrypto any more, see #25844 (Remove package pycrypto).
