Do we need this line?

```
from __future__ import annotations
```

I have been forced by reviewers to add it in every file that contains annotations.

The idea is that the annotation system only get a little stable in python 3.10, after a bunch of incompatible and random changes in python 3.7,3.8,3.9. This line make sure we use the final (?) behaviour.

Okay. LGTM.

(I might have accidentally removed that in some other file in another ticket...)
