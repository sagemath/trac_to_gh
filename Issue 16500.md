# Issue 16500: clean and speed up doctesting of bessel.py

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/16737

Original creator: rws

Original creation time: 2014-07-30 07:41:15

Keywords: special, speed

70% of long doctesting concerns four complex plots in `bessel.py`. Setting `plot_points=10` will probably not affect doctest quality but would be much faster. Even if done with image output there seems no difference in quality of the produced images.

This ticket applies all cleanup changes of #16023 and #16173 that are in `bessel.py`, as well as setting `plot_points=10`. It results in a reduction of long doctesting time by x%.

You should use `:trac:`10251``

Do you still need `long time` in this case?  Also, perhaps a `#` comment about how we speed it up with fewer `plot_points` would help readers unfamiliar with that function.

By the way, I find that the different regions differentiate themselves better with `plot_points=20`...

All done, and included the string "Set plot_points to a higher value to get more detail"

I cannot see a commit from #16173 that is not included in my branch of this ticket, and I just pushed it, so it must be on trac too.

Okay, I got beta0 working and the two changes specific to this ticket are fine and I already checked they look good before.  Nice.
