There is also a project by Costa, Harvey, and myself to do a different computation of zeta functions of nondegenerate toric hypersurfaces, using Monsky-Washnitzer cohomology in place of Dwork's series method. It's not yet clear how these two methods will compare (the Sperber-Voight method is optimized towards sparse hypersurfaces somewhat more than our approach), so it would be valuable to have both!

Just tried this and there is still something wrong:

```
File "src/sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial.pyx", line 2494, in sage.rings.polynomial.multi_polynomial.MPolynomial.zeta_function
Failed example:
    (x^3+x+1-y^2).zeta_function(7)
Expected:
    (7*T^7 - 17*T^6 + 14*T^5 - 12*T^4 + 18*T^3 - 14*T^2 + 5*T - 1)/(7*T - 1)
Got:
    (-3*T^4 + 2*T^3 + 4*T^2 - 2*T - 1)/(7*T - 1)
```

I was not one of the people working on this at sd91, so I wouldn't know what the issue is.

Still not sure what is going on here. This passage in `zeta_function.py` is nonsensical:

```
            # Reduce remaining part
            meta = Gm.parent()(m * eta[i])
            x_i = Gm.parent()(x[i])
            Gmbar = -sum([x_i * meta.derivative(x_i) for i in range(n + 1)])
```

but fixing it doesn't have any effect on the doctests (the terms in the sum are all zero anyway).

Another data point: the ratio of the answers with `affine=True` and `affine=False` is not correct either.
