I change `frozenset` wrappers from lambda to def. Should I try to do the same for remaining lambda statements like this ?

```
weight = lambda x: x if x in RR else 1
```

I think you can get rid of 

```
        def B(e):
            return b[frozenset(e)]
```


```
        def R(e):
            return r[frozenset(e)]
```


```
        def S(e):
            return frozenset(e)
```

as they are not simplifying the code (or changing the readability IMO.

I would still use `six.iteritems` for better memory usage:

```diff
-        g_mad = g.subgraph([v for v,l in six.iteritems(p.get_values(d)) if l>m ])
+        d_val = p.get_values(d)
+        g_mad = g.subgraph([v for v,l in d_val.items() if l > m ])
```

In general, I don't get the point of that change.

More standard convention and faster:

```diff
-lists = dict((v, []) for v in self)
+lists = {v: [] for v in self}
```


```
sage: %timeit dict((i,-1) for i in range(100))
100000 loops, best of 3: 16.6 µs per loop
sage: %timeit {i:-1 for i in range(100)}
100000 loops, best of 3: 11.7 µs per loop
```


`not fuv in L` -> `fuv not in L`.
