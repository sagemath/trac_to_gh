This is only used by the old coercion and called only from within the old coercion model. We rename it to `_has_coerce_map_from_old` and make it a `cdef` function while keeping `has_coerce_map_from_c` as deprecated alias.

The Cython function `has_coerce_map_from_c_impl` is folded into `_has_coerce_map_from_old`.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/25236
