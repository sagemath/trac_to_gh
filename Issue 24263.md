Work on #24247 shows that a significant amount of time is spent in `Action.__call__`. This should be optimized.

So I can explain why the first test is slower: there is an additional `if action._is_left` that is needed to be performed that previously was not there because powering could assume things in a specific order. The last one slowing down is due to #5574 (and some numerical noise). The middle two are almost identical (at least within the numerical noise I was getting), which is expected considering they perform the same number of checks in Cython.

However, I did get an improvement when something was calling `is_left()` in Python:

```
sage: from brial import BooleanMonomialMonoid
sage: P.<x,y,z> = BooleanPolynomialRing(3)
sage: M = BooleanMonomialMonoid(P)
sage: x = M(x); xy = M(x*y); z=M(z); n=2
sage: timeit('x * n', number=10000, repeat=20)
10000 loops, best of 20: 6.52 µs per loop
sage: timeit('n * x', number=10000, repeat=20)
10000 loops, best of 20: 6.43 µs per loop
```

vs with #24500

```
sage: timeit('n * x', number=10000, repeat=20)
10000 loops, best of 20: 6.14 µs per loop
sage: timeit('x * n', number=10000, repeat=20)
10000 loops, best of 20: 6.17 µs per loop
```


So my conclusion is this ticket does do a little bit of optimizing in certain cases and a regression in others. My current inclination is to give this ticket a positive review because it makes the action interface more clean by removing some of the implementation burden (i.e., deciding which input is which type).
