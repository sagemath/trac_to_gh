Keywords: range

Python 2 had `range` (returning lists) and `xrange` (returning iterators).

Python 3 only has `range` which behaves like the old `xrange`.

This ticket is to rename or change our range-like functions accordingly.

Functions in the global name space:
- `ellipsis_range`
- `fibonacci_xrange`
- `mrange`
- `mrange_iter`
- `prime_range`
- `randrange`
- `range`
- `srange`
- `sxrange`
- `xmrange`
- `xmrange_iter`
- `xsrange`

See also:

- #18298: `prime_range` vs `primes`
- #29728: Meta-ticket: improve compatibility with the Python library

According to the [Python 3 documentation for range](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#func-range):

> Rather than being a

Could we make `srange` an immutable sequence type too?
