This contains one code change: `is_chain()` for empty poset returns `True`.

`is_incomparable_chain_free` rejects argument `0`, as it makes no sense. Also I added "interval order" etc. for googlers. (Code could be changed from recursive to iterative. Or maybe just drop support for list type argument?)

Otherwise this is mostly polishing. I tried to explain intuitively what means for example to be ranked. Actually pictures would be good here.

I also added test for empty poset to all functions that I checked.

A question not relating to (only) documentation: How much we should have `certificate`-style options? For almost every Boolean valued function there can be one. For `is_incomparable_chain_free` it is a pair of chains. For `is_meet_semilattice` it is pair of elements without a meet. And so on.

For graphs we have for example `is_eulerian` and `eulerian_circuit`, and it feels logical to me.

I think that sounds like a good idea. It might require additional coding in some cases, since the best algorithm for determining true/false may not always involve finding such a certificate.

Would we want to have separate functions for returning just a boolean versus possibly returning a certificate like in that graph example, or would we just want to add an optional parameter `certificate` to the existing function?

I think that it depends on what mathematicians think. There is no mathematical definition for "mathematically interesting".

For a graph we have the chromatic number. We might also want to see an example of some coloring. Or maybe we want to count how many different coloring the graph has. Or make a list of them. Or maybe just check that the graph is not 4-colorable.

Just writing down my comments as I read through, I may make some of the changes mentioned if I get a chance.

- In `is_incomparable_chain_free()` the three cases of (m+n)-free having a special name, the case (1+2) is missing the parentheses around 1+2.

- I think the input for `is_incomparable_chain_free` is a bit confusing, since m can be an integer or a list of pairs of integers. Or at least the first part of the decription needs to be a bit more verbose to describe what's happening.

- I don't like the name `is_chain()` being used for checking if a poset is totally ordered. Shouldn't this be called `is_totally_ordered`, to avoid confusion with checking that a given subset of the poset forms a chain? Or maybe `is_chain_poset()`?

- Maybe the definition of a poset being connected could mention that an equivalent definition is the Hasse diagram being connected?

- Informal definition of a ranked poset should be touched up a bit. Should say something more along the lines of 'all cover relations are between elements on adjacent levels'. Strictly speaking, saying they can't skip levels doesn't exclude the possibility of them being on the same level. I also think the 'formal definition' should come before the informal one, and not be branded as 'formal'.

- I'm not sure the informal definition of a graded poset helps at all. Saying all maximal chains have the same length is pretty clear. And if it does stay, there's one typo ('throught').

As I asked: "Or maybe just drop support for list type argument?". It is easy to guess why the list argument is done: to have slightly easier way to filter semiorders. But it is still oneliner to write without list type argument.

To drop it, to keep and clarify the documentation, or to deprecate it?

Very true. Not `is_chain_poset`, as it is too easy to confuse with `is_chain_of_poset`. So, deprecation and a new name?

Yes. Actually it seems obvious from the name what the function does.

This is a function where formal definition is easy, but still very hard compared to informal definition - or to a picture. But yes, I must think the wording.

True, *antiordered* does not sound good.

Btw, I keep this as needs_review. That's because more changes can be made later. Real question for review is "Does this patch make Sage better?"

You can have both

```
def is_chain(self, data=None):
    r"""
    Test whether a given subset of elements is a chain.

    By default, does the test for all the elements of the poset.
    """
    if data is None:
        data = self
    ...

No! Please no!

They do very much different thing. Already `rank` gives me a headache, as it can return a property of a poset (height, not depending if the poset is ranked or not) or a a property of an element (rank in ranked poset).

...or at least this is how *I* see it. A poset is an abstract thing that might have a property like width. Or it is a concrete thing where I can ask for example if `a` is greater than `b`. But if *majority* sees it other way, then of course I must accommodate to it.
