Analogously to the `add` transducer, two common transducers for logical `and` and `or`, falling back to python's `all` and `any` and hence also named in that way.

Rewrote code: a function with def is now a lambda. Needs cross-review.

Apart from this, code and docs looks fine, tests pass. Give it a positive review, when positive cross-reviewed.
