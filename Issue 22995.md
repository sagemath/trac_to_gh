This ticket:

- Let `SymmetricFunctions` use the generic implementation of
  `inject_shorthands` for consistency and duplication reduction.

- Side effect: the list of defined shorthands is printed out, as for
  quasi symmetric functions & the like, which is helpful for the user.

- Adds the forgotten symmetric functions to the shorthands.

- Suppresses the `redefining xxx` warnings. They were deemed annoying
  by many users, and somewhat redudant with the list of defined
  shorthands. This is also consistent with the behavior of
  `inject_variable` of polynomial rings,

- Changes the message from "Injecting shorthand ..." to "Defining
  shorthand ...": this is clearer for the user and consistent with
  the behavior of `inject_variable`.

- Adds an option `warn` to sage.misc.misc.inject_variable`

Altogether, this gives:

```
sage: SymmetricFunctions(QQ).inject_shorthands()
Defining e as shorthand for Symmetric Functions over Rational Field in the elementary basis
Defining f as shorthand for Symmetric Functions over Rational Field in the forgotten basis
Defining h as shorthand for Symmetric Functions over Rational Field in the homogeneous basis
Defining m as shorthand for Symmetric Functions over Rational Field in the monomial basis
Defining p as shorthand for Symmetric Functions over Rational Field in the powersum basis
Defining s as shorthand for Symmetric Functions over Rational Field in the Schur basis
```


Instead of:

```
sage: SymmetricFunctions(QQ).inject_shorthands()
/opt/sage-git/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/combinat/sf/sf.py:1416: RuntimeWarning: redefining global value `e`
  inject_variable(shorthand, getattr(self, shorthand)())
```


(ticket implemented after discussion with Viviane Pons, François
Bergeron, Florent Hivert, Franco Saliola).

Why do you have the inject_shorthands if not to give all implemented bases? But if you think it is too much, then perhaps there should be a message underneath the list of injected ones that says "Further bases can be found here ...."

Franco's opinion goes along the same line: by default, inject only the "classical" bases from (basically those from Macdonald's book), thus including forgotten but not witt. And have an "all" parameter.
