# Issue 20055: Fix weight function and category for alcove path model

For example highest weight elements don't have a weight in the dominant chamber:

```
sage: C = crystals.AlcovePaths(['A',2], [2,0])
sage: C.module_generator[0]
(0, 2, 0)
```

Additionally, KR crystal elements are not of level 0:

```
sage: A = crystals.AlcovePaths(['A',2,1], [1,0], highest_weight_crystal=False)
sage: for x in A:
....:     x.weight()
Lambda[1]
-Lambda[1] + Lambda[2]
-Lambda[2]
```

Lastly, in finite type, the alcove path model does not know it is a classical crystal:

```
sage: C.category()
Category of finite crystals
```
