I don't really get the point of this patch. We are still patching PARI, so which problem does this fix? I think this branch should be applied by distros if they feel the need, not by Sage.

I don't want to overcomplicate our doctest framework just because upstream PARI is so stubborn to insist that debug messages should be shown unconditionally with no way to disable them. The correct solution here is fixing PARI, not Sage.

I don't quite follow that - how would applying the PARI patch to Debian, help other distros package Sage (or PARI) more quickly? And even if it did, I don't think it would be appropriate to patch package A to make it easier to package B.

As you have seen, we *have* applied some Sage patches to other packages in Debian. In this situation, I can't by convention (because there is already an active maintainer), and even if I was the only maintainer, upstream has voiced some opposition to the patch which makes me less certain about applying it - there might be issue or concern that he has about the patch, that I don't know about.

Right, I was just thinking about Debian...
