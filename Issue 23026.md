I don't really get the point of this patch. We are still patching PARI, so which problem does this fix? I think this branch should be applied by distros if they feel the need, not by Sage.

I don't want to overcomplicate our doctest framework just because upstream PARI is so stubborn to insist that debug messages should be shown unconditionally with no way to disable them. The correct solution here is fixing PARI, not Sage.

I don't quite follow that - how would applying the PARI patch to Debian, help other distros package Sage (or PARI) more quickly? And even if it did, I don't think it would be appropriate to patch package A to make it easier to package B.
