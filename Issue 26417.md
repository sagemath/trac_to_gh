Keywords: matrix multiplication, finite fields

At least in some cases, matrix multiplication over finite fields can be sped up a lot (PARI in this example, but using e.g. FLINT or NTL might also be an option):

```python
def matmul_pari(A, B):
    F = A.base_ring()
    A = A.__pari__()
    B = B.__pari__()
    C = A * B
    return Matrix(F, map(lambda v: map(F, v), C.mattranspose()))

F = GF(3^12)
n = 64
M = MatrixSpace(F, n, n)
A = M.random_element()
B = M.random_element()
```

With this setup, I get

```
sage: %time C = A * B
CPU times: user 587 ms, sys: 1 ms, total: 588 ms
Wall time: 587 ms
sage: %time D = matmul_pari(A, B)
CPU times: user 40 ms, sys: 1 ms, total: 41 ms
Wall time: 42.4 ms
sage: C == D
True
```


Note: the last line in `matmul_pari` is needed because converting PARI matrices to Sage matrices using `M(C)` currently raises an error.
