Restricted to open intervals (not closures), this is nothing but the forgetful functor from manifolds into sets. Perhaps it is a good idea to add this functor somehow?

Other than that it looks good! Let's wait for the patchbot.

If you create `OpenInterval` instances with the same `ambient_interval` set, then you can take unions.


```
sage: I02 = OpenInterval(0, 2, ambient_interval=RealLine())
sage: I13 = OpenInterval(1, 3, ambient_interval=RealLine())
sage: I02.union(I13)
Open subset (0, 2)_union_(1, 3) of the Real number line R
```

sage: I13 = OpenInterval(1, 3, ambient_interval=RealLine())
sage: U = I02.union(I13)
