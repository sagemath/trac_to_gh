Do you refer to the objection that trapezoid rule is not a Riemann sum?  IMHO it is moot.

I was asked about this ticket recently by a beginner, since it has the beginner keyword. But after looking at the ticket, I think this is not a good beginner ticket, especially now that the underlying code has been completely rewritten since this was first proposed.

I'm removing the beginner tag. But I also suggest that this ticket be closed --- there are no longer any Riemann sums here, so the discussion as to whether a trapezoidal sum should be considered no longer applies.
