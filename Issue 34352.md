I would say that the vector field modules are indeed reflexive for the cases we can treat with Sage, namely those for which the manifold M can be split into a finite number of parallelizable manifolds N_i, i.e. there is a finite open cover of M, (N_i)_{1\leq i \leq p} (p finite), such that for each i, N_i is parallelizable.

Then the vector field v in X(M) defined as being equal to v_i on each N_i obeys f(a) = a(v), which shows that the canonical map `X(M) --> X(M)**` is bijective.

Is this splitting into parallelizable manifolds explicitly done somewhere in the code?

I guess a subtlety is that in sage.manifolds a manifold M is thought to be immutable but new submanifolds on it can be declared imperatively. At any point, of course only finitely many submanifolds have been declared in M as a Python object, but it's not clear that M as a mathematical object is really assumed to be covered by only a finite number of parallelizable submanifolds...

Not explicitly, but `DifferentiableManifold`'s have the attribute `_parrelizable_parts`; for instance:

```
sage: M = manifolds.Sphere(2, coordinates='stereographic')
sage: M._parallelizable_parts
{Open subset S^2-{NP,SP} of the 2-sphere S^2 of radius 1 smoothly embedded in the Euclidean space E^3,
 Open subset S^2-{NP} of the 2-sphere S^2 of radius 1 smoothly embedded in the Euclidean space E^3,
 Open subset S^2-{SP} of the 2-sphere S^2 of radius 1 smoothly embedded in the Euclidean space E^3}
sage: M._open_covers
[[2-sphere S^2 of radius 1 smoothly embedded in the Euclidean space E^3],
 [Open subset S^2-{NP} of the 2-sphere S^2 of radius 1 smoothly embedded in the Euclidean space E^3,
  Open subset S^2-{SP} of the 2-sphere S^2 of radius 1 smoothly embedded in the Euclidean space E^3]]
```
