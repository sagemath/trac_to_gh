Nice hint malb! This was actually what I was looking for, but I didn't find the __dict__ object :)

I'm not sure if this

```python
import sys
sys.modules[__name__].__dict__
```

is the correct way to access the modul objects in itself, but I'm not aware of any other way.

Hi Rusydi,

this is for a convenient way of iterating over all collected S-boxes.
Say you want to test some property for every S-box, you can then just iterate over this dictionary. Without this dictionary such an iteration would not be that easy.

I already used this dictionary several times and find it really handy to have it.
