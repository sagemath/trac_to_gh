Nice hint malb! This was actually what I was looking for, but I didn't find the __dict__ object :)

I'm not sure if this

```python
import sys
sys.modules[__name__].__dict__
```

is the correct way to access the modul objects in itself, but I'm not aware of any other way.

I still do not understand the reason why the dictionary "sboxes" is needed here. Importing whatever SBox object in this module should be sufficient, e.g. (from sage.crypto.sboxes import AES). Could you explain the rationale behind having the dictionary "sboxes" ?

Hi Rusydi,

this is for a convenient way of iterating over all collected S-boxes.
Say you want to test some property for every S-box, you can then just iterate over this dictionary. Without this dictionary such an iteration would not be that easy.

I already used this dictionary several times and find it really handy to have it.
