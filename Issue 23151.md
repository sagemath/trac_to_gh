Before

```
sage: K.<cbrt2> = NumberField(x^3 - 2, embedding=AA(2)**(1/3))
sage: %time l = [(m*cbrt2 - n).floor() for m in range(200) for n in range(200)]
CPU times: user 29 s, sys: 59.3 ms, total: 29.1 s
Wall time: 29 s
```

After

```
sage: %time l = [(m*cbrt2 - n).floor() for m in range(200) for n in range(200)]
CPU times: user 825 ms, sys: 66.9 ms, total: 892 ms
Wall time: 800 ms
