# Issue 32193: remove obsolete code in EllipticCurveIsogeny.is_normalized()

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/32430

Original creator: lorenz

Original creation time: 2021-08-28 15:22:57

CC:  wuthrich cremona

Keywords: elliptic curve, isogeny, deprecation

The `EllipticCurveIsogeny.is_normalized()` method accepts two optional arguments, `via_formal` and `check_by_pullback`, that have been documented as deprecated since #7096 — for over 10 years! — albeit without printing a deprecation warning in the code itself. It might be about time to remove them.

Looks good, but maybe we can just get rid of them right now ?

`@`cremona : John, your opinion ?

Otherwise, you need to doctest the deprecation...

I'm sure this is fine.  I would say that we do not need to put in the warning after so long, but then I don't use this feature as far as I can remember.

I agree that this can go without the need of a deprecation.
