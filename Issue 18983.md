# Issue 18983: Archive the old TOPCOM package

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/19220

Original creator: jhpalmieri

CC:  schilly leif

The package `http://files.sagemath.org/spkg/optional/TOPCOM-0.17.4.spkg` has been superseded by the new-style `topcom` package. So the old one should be put in the `archive` directory.

Changing component from packages: optional to website/wiki.

Do anybody know whether creating Trac tickets is the proper procedure to deal with old spkgs?

I think this will serve as a good metaticket.

Changing type from defect to task.

Please don't add tickets which don't have positive review yet unless the old package was broken anyway.

Presumably this should happen _after_ a stable release of the new pip stuff, though?

You're right. Although I don't know if it will happen at all, see [comment:2]

Hi, I could move those spkgs any time, but I have no idea about the implications.

Since the old `TOPCOM` has been superseded by a new-style `topcom`, I believe it's safe to archive that one.

Perhaps it should be done after the release of Sage 6.9 stable? That would be a good time.

Sage 6.9 has been released.

Is there any reason not to move these spkgs now?

Soya does not support Python 2 anymore (see http://www.lesfleursdunormal.fr/static/informatique/soya3d/index_en.html). Moreover, it now exists on PyPI: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Soya3/

What is the subtle difference between the packages `soya` and `soya_cvs`?
