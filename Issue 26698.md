CC:  vdelecroix

This code tries to compare various elements of the `alphabet` which might break in Python 3 or after #22029 is applied:

```
        if (alphabet.cardinality() == Infinity or
            (alphabet.cardinality() < 36 and
             all(alphabet.unrank(i) > alphabet.unrank(j)
                 for i in range(min(36, alphabet.cardinality()))
                 for j in range(i)))):
```
