# Issue 17917: Documentation of 'bound' in IntegerModRing.random_element()

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/18154

Original creator: jmantysalo

Original creation time: 2015-04-10 08:33:32

Documentation does not contain example of the parameter. (Also there is no good check for type of it, but at least it gives some error message.)

You can test it like

```
sage: R.random_element(2) in [R(0), R(1), R(2), R(16), R(17)]
True
```

Well, why not. Did this, but changed order of elements in the list.
