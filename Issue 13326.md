# Issue 13326: Hide sage/gsl/interpolation/Spline internals

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: jvkersch

Original creation time: 2012-09-25 09:56:00

Assignee: jason, jkantor

CC:  kcrisman

Keywords: spline, gsl

The ``list`` member function of ``sage.gsl.interpolation.Spline`` returns a reference to the spline interpolation points, allowing one to change these points without having the spline be recomputed: 


```
sage: s = spline([(0, 0), (1, 2), (2, 4)]); s
[(0, 0), (1, 2), (2, 4)]
sage: s(1)
2.0
sage: s.list()[1] = (1, 100); s
[(0, 0), (1, 100), (2, 4)]
sage: s(1)
2.0
```

The patch modifies the ```list``` method to return a copy of the interpolation points, as discussed at https://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-devel/61t8kUyN8L8/discussion

Could you change the doctest to show that the list is a copy such as

```
sage: S = spline([(1,1), (2,3), (4,5)])
sage: L = S.list(); L
[(1, 1), (2, 3), (4, 5)] 
sage: L[2] = (3, 2)
sage: L
[(1, 1), (2, 3), (3, 2)]
sage: S.list()
[(1, 1), (2, 3), (4, 5)]
```

showing the change and testing it (in a TEST:: block), as well as coping a form of what is in the trac description into the method description?

Edit: Functionally it is good.

Thanks for the addendum and sorry for the long wait. I've added the example to the docstring as you requested and moved things around a bit. Is there any difference between starting an example block with TESTS:: versus EXAMPLES::?

A TESTS:: block is when something is not an example per say, but used in showing some bug has been fixed.

Looks good to me.

Ah, yes, that makes sense. Thanks for the clarification and the positive review.
