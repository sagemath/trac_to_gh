Keywords: weight graph

Consider the following example:

```
G = Graph([(1,2,0.1), (2,3,0.5), (1,3,0.3), (1,4,0.1)])  # whatever
G.min_spanning_tree(weight_function=lambda e:e[2])
w, L = T.longest_path(use_edge_labels=True)
```

In the last two lines, the functions are called differently, which is annoying, since one always has to look up the doc, to find out, which one is the correct. 

Since both ways of calling are good (`use_edge_labels` simple and easy, `weight_function` more flexible), either should be possible for each function.

I would guess, that there are more functions, which are affected...

Moreover, there are arguments named "by_weight" in distance, shortest_path, shortest_path_lengthâ€¦

```

I would go for single argument "by_weight" with following semantics of its values:

* False would be default with meaning "all the same".
* True would use labels.
* Custom function would be used translate edges to weight.

I think this would be easy to remember. On the other side, it is quite a radical change that would require long transition period.

What do you think?
