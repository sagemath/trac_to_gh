This is part of #24457 but it already makes sense without that ticket to have the factory function in a separate module.

deprecation does not necessit lazy import

```
def create_RealField(*args, **kwds):
    r"""
    Depreacted function moved to :mod:`sage.rings.real_field`
    """
    from sage.misc.superseded import deprecation
    deprecation(24511, "do not import from here")
    from sage.rings.real_field import create_RealField as the_good_one
    return the_good_one(*args, **kwds)
```
