# Issue 16011: Some trivial Orthogonal Arrays

Issue created by migration from Trac.

When `n=1`, the orthogonal array `[[0]*k]` is a valid answer.

I met this as a corner-case of some constructions I am working on...

Ahahah. Well, I prefer when they are not graph-related. I hate to spoil a clean graph algorithm with one thousand stupid "if" `:-P`

I moved this above #16272. Looks like with git you'd better work with totally linear dependencies or the number of commits on each ticket will JUMP when you merged everything together -_-
