I like the approach but I don't like this

```
# Not a Sage Element, convert to Integer
n = ZZ(n)
```

What if the input is a Python `float` or a 1x1 numpy matrix? Would better go through `ZZ.coerce`. That would currently fail for `gmpy2` but would succeed after #23052.

Why special casing `proof` here?

```
+    # Polynomial or other factorable object
+    try:
+        return m(proof=proof, **kwds)
+    except TypeError:
+        # Maybe the factor() method doesn't have a proof option
+        return m(**kwds)
```

We could just pass all options `**kwds` straight and make `proof` one of them when required.
