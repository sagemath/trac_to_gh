This version
* Passes ptest long.
* Sort-of passes its own testsuite (expected failures in internet).

==> `needs_review`.

As usual, attention welcome on Cygwin and Macintoshes.

Thanks. I am a multirecidivist about this one...

Huh ? What does that means ?

The "new commit" line is not by me, it was added automatically by trac

Upgrading there is tempting, indeed. But...

From the announcement :


>    * chooseCRANmirror() and chooseBioCmirror() no longer have a

>      downloads.

This currently implies OpenSSL. But we can't include it (its relicensing isn't yet isn't yet complete).

Therefore, we have to implement #24107. Doing this "brutally" is easy. I've tried to find a way to allow for the wish of some developers to be able to compile without OpenSSL. This turns out to be hard...

I'm tempted to explicitly depend on a systemwide  OpenSSL (stageb 1, as described in #24107), keeping in mind to add the possibility to add it in the Sage tree if necessary when relicensing is complete (stage 2, not yet started). This ignores the wish to compile sage without OpenSSL support.

In any case, having 3.4.4 in R is useful., I'm tempted to lobby for inclusion of the present ticket as it is in 8.3beta1, and to open a new ticket, depending on #24107, to upgrade to 3.5.0.

Advice ?

Changing keywords from "r-project" to "r-project, upgrade".

I agree with Emmanuel: let's get R 3.4.4 in Sage now,
by merging it in Sage 8.3.beta1 if possible.

Then let's open another ticket for upgrading to R 3.5.0.
