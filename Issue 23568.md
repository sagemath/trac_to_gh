# Issue 23568: adding SchemeMorphism_points to coercion framework

Issue created by migration from Trac.

This is part of meta ticket #23047. The goal is to have scheme points able to be coerced when that coercion makes sense. Essentially SchemeHomeset_points needs a _coerce_map_from_ function and possibly updates to _element_constructor_.

For example, we should be able to coerce between the following objects

- the same space type where the base rings have a coercion between them. i.e. P^1(ZZ) -> P^1(QQ)

- a points of a subscheme to points of the ambient space

- base ring elements to Affine 1 space.

Here is a first implementation of coercion for scheme points. Comments welcome.

* There should be no coercion from list or tuple, just a conversion.
* No coercion if the variable names on the projective/affine space are different (for consistency with multivariate polynomials).
* For products of projective spaces and toric varieties, you need to check more than just that the relative dimensions are the same.

Thanks for the comments. I've tried to better match what polynomial rings are doing. I don't think even a conversion from tuple/lists actually fits here very well. So I've no longer allowed that behind the scenes. i.e. being able to say P1([0,1]) == [0,1] does not work.

However, I feel out of my depth for Toric varieties. I'm not sure what type of situations it would actually be valid to coerce. Consequently, I taken to conservative approach and not done coercion for those. Would it be better to raise a NotImplementedError than just allowing _coerce_map_from_ to return None? or does this need to wait for someone who can deal with the Toric cases?

I agree that `P1([0,1]) == [0,1]` should not work, but again, make sure you keep coercion and conversion straight.  The fact that `P1([0,1])` works is a conversion, and is fine.  the implicit construction described by the equality test you mention is a coercion, and is not.

As for toric varieties, it's fine leaving it as `None`.  That just means that there is no coercion now; one can be added later if appropriate.

I ran some functionality tests, the following examples should give true, but don't:


```
PQ.<x,y> = ProjectiveSpace(QQ,1)
PC.<x,y> = ProjectiveSpace(CC,1)
PQ([1,0])==PC([1,0]) , PC(CC).has_coerce_map_from(PQ(QQ))
```


and


```
R.<x> = PolynomialRing(QQ)
K.<i> = NumberField(x^2+1)
A1.<x> = AffineSpace(QQ,1)
A2.<x> = AffineSpace(K,1)
p1 = A1(1)
p2 = A2(1)
p1==p2 , A2(K).has_coerce_map_from(A1(QQ))
```

Nevermind, those examples do work. My apologies.

I reviewed the code and I tried some rather sophisticated examples (couple of examples below), wasn't able to find any problems Looks good to me. 


```python
sage: R.<X> = PolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(X^2 - 2, embedding=QQbar(sqrt(2)))
sage: P.<x,y> = ProjectiveSpace(QQbar, 1)
sage: Q.<x,y> = ProjectiveSpace(K, 1)
sage: P(sqrt(2),1) == Q(a,1)
sage: P(sqrt(2),1)
(1.414213562373095? : 1)
sage: Q(a, 1)
(a : 1)
sage: P(sqrt(2),1) == Q(a,1)
True
sage: P(QQbar).has_coerce_map_from(Q(K))
True
```

and

```python
sage: R.<t> = PolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(t^2 - 6, embedding=QQbar(sqrt(6)))
sage: P.<x,y,z,w> = ProjectiveSpace(QQbar, 3)
sage: X = P.subscheme(y^2*z - x*(x-z)*(x-w) ); X
Closed subscheme of Projective Space of dimension 3 over Algebraic Field defined by:
  -x^3 + x^2*z + y^2*z + x^2*w - x*z*w

Closed subscheme of Projective Space of dimension 3 over Algebraic Field defined by:
  -x^3 + x^2*z + y^2*z + x^2*w - x*z*w,

It worked appropriately for every example that I came up with.
