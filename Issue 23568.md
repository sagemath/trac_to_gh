This is part of meta ticket #23047. The goal is to have scheme points able to be coerced when that coercion makes sense. Essentially SchemeHomeset_points needs a _coerce_map_from_ function and possibly updates to _element_constructor_.

For example, we should be able to coerce between the following objects

- the same space type where the base rings have a coercion between them. i.e. P^1(ZZ) -> P^1(QQ)

- a points of a subscheme to points of the ambient space

- base ring elements to Affine 1 space.

Thanks for the comments. I've tried to better match what polynomial rings are doing. I don't think even a conversion from tuple/lists actually fits here very well. So I've no longer allowed that behind the scenes. i.e. being able to say P1([0,1]) == [0,1] does not work.

However, I feel out of my depth for Toric varieties. I'm not sure what type of situations it would actually be valid to coerce.

I agree that `P1([0,1]) == [0,1]` should not work, but again, make sure you keep coercion and conversion straight.  The fact that `P1([0,1])` works is a conversion, and is fine.  the implicit construction described by the equality test you mention is a coercion, and is not.

As for toric varieties, it's fine leaving it as `None`.  That just means that there is no coercion now; one can be added later if appropriate.
