Implements the finite Generalized dihedral groups. 
A Generalized dihedral group is the semi-direct product of an abelian group with C2, where C2 acts on the abelian group by sending elements to their inverse.
This adds a group of order 18 that is not part of any other family currently implemented in sage, as well as others of not so small order.

Looks great. I found a few typos while reading the doc strings. I'll look at the _init_ code more carefully, later, but on first glance and playing around with it for a few minutes it seems solid.

Typos to check in `sage/groups/perm_gps/permgroup_named.py`:

 * Line 767: The first sentence here is not a sentence.
 * Line 770: replace "factor" with "product"
 * Line 776: What do you mean by "degree" here? Do you mean "order"? If so, I would say that or else clarify degree.
 * `__init__()` needs a docstring. In these cases I tend to write something like


```
def __init__():
    r"""
    Init method of class <CLASSNAME>. See the docstring for :class:`<CLASSNAME>`.
    
    EXAMPLES::

        sage: ex1
    """
    ...
```


Nice work, I'm glad this is on its way to getting into Sage. More later..

Ben,

Thanks for your interest. I've posted a new version (v2), with your suggested docstring changes.

Looks great. I went through your code closely and it looks nice and straightforward. I'm looking at the HTML docs now and pending that and long tests passing I'll give this a positive review. 

Nice work.

reviewer patch; removes trailing whitespace

Everything came back good. I attached a reviewer patch to clean up some trailing whitespace from your most recent patch. This isn't a bug deal, just a cosmetic thing (and not everyone agrees on what should be done about it).
