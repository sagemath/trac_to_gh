# Issue 24023: Deprecate str ^ Integer

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/24260

Original creator: jdemeyer

CC:  dkrenn

This is crazy:

```
sage: "abc" ^ 5
'abcabcabcabcabc'
```

We already have multiplication with the same behaviour and it's an error in Python:

```
>>> "abc" ** 5
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for ** or pow(): 'str' and 'int'
```

CC dkrenn because this affects some doctests in `asymptotic`.

The changes in `asymptotic` are fine for me.

+1 for this change. LGTM, i.e., positive_review once the patchbot confirms a pass.

Replying to [comment:5 dkrenn]:
> [...] positive_review once the patchbot confirms a pass.


```
sage -t --long src/sage/schemes/hyperelliptic_curves/hyperelliptic_padic_field.py  # 2 doctests failed
```

There seem to be two more occurrences...
