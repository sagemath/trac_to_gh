Follow up on #20884:

The newly added `-y` switch should be added to the help screen obtained by `sage -advanced`.

And perhaps also in the manual (didn't look).

#20884 isn't merged yet so did this really need an additional ticket?

I didn't add the `-y` switch to `sage` though, but just just `sage-spkg`.  I guess `sage -i` can pass arguments through to it though?

I opened a new ticket to avoid another race with the release manager.

I think it does.

I mostly added it as an internal interface between the two.  But I guess I can see how it might be useful, especially for someone developing an experimental package.

What I meant to say is, there needs to be a documented switch for "sage -i" and "sage -f" that enables installing experimental packages without asking questions. Right now -y seems to work; so that could be documented; however, if there is a different switch, that's also fine if that is documented.

No, `-y` would be it.  I just didn't realize before you posted this ticket that there was a need for that at all (I only added it specifically for the sake of running `make` directly).  But like I said, now that you bring it up, I can see the potential use.

I'm happy to add docs for it in the help once #20884 is done.

This is now done as part of #21082, so it can be closed.

Um, I thought that only release manager is allowed to close tickets - have I missed something?
