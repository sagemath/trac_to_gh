# Issue 18562: Python 3 preparation: Change syntax of raise with traceback

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: wluebbe

Original creation time: 2015-06-27 17:25:07

Keywords: python3

`2to3` proposes changes for

```
raise E, V, T -> raise E(V).with_traceback(T)
raise E, None, T -> raise E.with_traceback(T)
```

These changes are invalid (see also #18796).

Several options are given in the documentation of python-future (see http://python-future.org/compatible_idioms.html#raising-exceptions).

This ticket is tracked as a dependency of meta-ticket #16052.
The simple `raise` statements are fixed in #15990.

I propose to convert the elliptic curve one to a simple raise (no traceback)
