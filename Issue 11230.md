Keywords: FreeModules basis cache

Let `FM` be a combinatorial free module currently creating elements using the basis is very slow because the family is recreated each time:

```
sage: FM = CombinatorialFreeModule(QQ, ZZ)
sage: %timeit [FM.basis()[i] for i in range(100)]
5 loops, best of 3: 44.4 ms per loop
```
Adding a cache to `basis` gives a large speedup

```
sage: FM = CombinatorialFreeModule(QQ, ZZ)
sage: %timeit [FM.basis()[i] for i in range(100)]
125 loops, best of 3: 3.45 ms per loop
```
The speedup will be even larger with Simon King optimization on cache_methods.
