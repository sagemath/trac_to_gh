Could you add polygamma, too, and also include a test along the following lines to make sure that the functions really are the same (unfortunately, both fricas and sage have gaps in the implementation, in different aspects)?

```
sage: fricas.digamma(1.0)
- 0.5772156649_0153286061
sage: psi(1.0)
-0.577215664901533
sage: fricas.polygamma(1, 1.0)
1.6449340668482269
sage: psi(1, 1.0)
psi(1, 1.00000000000000)
sage: psi(1, 1)
1/6*pi^2
sage: psi(1, 1).n()
1.64493406684823
```


This might fit with the test in lines 1465-- in `fricas.py`.
