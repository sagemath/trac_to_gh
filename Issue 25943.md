Mostly done.  I also exposed the system solver, however, I'm not sure whether I have to convert the output to what maxima returns.  Compare


```
        sage: t = var('t')
        sage: x = function('x')(t)
        sage: y = function('y')(t)
        sage: de1 = diff(x,t) + y - 1 == 0
        sage: de2 = diff(y,t) - x + 1 == 0
        sage: desolve_system([de1, de2], [x,y])
        [x(t) == (x(0) - 1)*cos(t) - (y(0) - 1)*sin(t) + 1,
         y(t) == (y(0) - 1)*cos(t) + (x(0) - 1)*sin(t) + 1]

    The same system solved using FriCAS::

        sage: desolve_system([de1, de2], [x,y], algorithm='fricas')             # optional - fricas
        {'basis': [(cos(t), sin(t)), (sin(t), -cos(t))],
         'particular': (cos(t)^2 + sin(t)^2, 1)}
```


(that `cos(t)^2 + sin(t)^2` is not simplified to 1 is a peculiarity of FriCAS)
