remove the last use of GAP pexpect in that file;

remove no longer needed #optional tags in some tests

this should make this a bit more robust and quick

after `git trac try 28818` and `sage -b`, I did:

The error 

```

Failed example:
    g = graphs.LivingstoneGraph() # optional - gap_packages internet

```

has not arisen from this branch, it's there without it. I guess noone tests with `internet` on :-)

OK, let me see if I can fix it quickly.

Right. Let me know if you have a fix, or if we let these doctests for another ticket.

OK, there was a failure in Graph's understanding that edges are edges.

Comment by dimpase created at 2019-12-01 19:11:18

Changing type from enhancement to defect.


---

Comment by dcoudert created at 2019-12-01 20:02:05

In `strongly_regular_db.pyx`, you changed

```diff
-        sage: g.is_strongly_regular(parameters=True) # long time # optional - gap_packages
+        sage: g=SRG_280_135_70_60()                  # long time
```

but this test needs libgap, right ?  I have not followed the recent changes with gap. Is it now part of the standard distribution ? Otherwise, how can we prevent to run this test if we don't have lib gap ?


---

Comment by dimpase created at 2019-12-01 20:29:30

libgap is a standard package since I don't recall when. We're converting the whole sagelib to use libgap instead of gap.

Comment by vbraun created at 2019-12-03 23:19:46

I'm getting timeouts at

```
sage: gg = graphs.HallJankoGraph(from_string=False) # long time ## line 683 ##
```

and

```
sage: g=SRG_280_135_70_60()                  # long time ## line 2243 ##
```

resulting in 

```
sage -t --long src/sage/graphs/generators/smallgraphs.py  # Timed out
sage -t --long src/sage/graphs/strongly_regular_db.pyx  # Timed out
```

Several buildbots time out at the same test so its reproducable...


---

Comment by dimpase created at 2019-12-03 23:36:41

these tests need internet connection to cache data via GAP's AtlasRep package.
One can tag them `# optional - internet`

please do!

I have the same errors when I try `./sage -tp --long --optional=sage,optional,external src/sage/graphs/` but not when I try `./sage -tp --long src/sage/graphs/`. So added flags are working well.


LGTM.
