Looks ok but begs the question for a separate ticket: Do we still need those `SAGE64` sections? If so why? Otherwise it looks good to me. But this is the only place for `singular` with `LDFLAGS`

```
if [ "x$SAGE64" = xyes ]; then
    echo "Building a 64-bit version of Singular"
    CFLAGS="$CFLAGS -m64 "
    CXXFLAGS="$CXXFLAGS -m64"
    CPPFLAGS="$CPPFLAGS -m64"
    LDFLAGS="$LDFLAGS -m64 "; export LDFLAGS
    if [ "x`uname`" = xSunOS ] ; then
        export CC="$CC -m64"
        export CXX="$CXX -m64"
    fi
fi
```

so it is not any harder that the others and it should already be OK. If it isn't, I'll be interested in a build log.

Some bits of `singular` are using `LDFLAGS` but we would need to add it wherever it is missing above, at least wherever `LD` is called. A quick `sed` from `$(LD) ${SLDFLAGS}` to `$(LD) ${SLDFLAGS} ${LDFLAGS}` should do.

Nope, `LDFLAGS` are meant to be passed to the *compiler*, not directly to the linker.  (You'd frequently get syntax errors otherwise, because the linker doesn't necessarily take the same or all of the options.  The compiler in contrast passes anything it doesn't understand verbatim to the linker if applicable, so the opposite is not a problem.)

P.S.:  A while ago, a few occurrences of `LD` in Singular's Makefiles were actually hardcoded to `ld`.

MacOS X used to default to 32-bit builds on 64-bit systems (until 10.6.x?); SunOS/Oraclis still does.

So in principle we still need the ugly `SAGE64` stuff (or should keep it for porting / to not break SunOS support further...).

Well, my impression was that Singular 4.x in Sage is rather a looong-term thing...

There are very few `SAGE64` sections left, so I am expecting it to be broken (because it would need more packages to have a `SAGE64` section) but I don't have a system to prove it. Also such a setting should centralised in one place rather than ditched in all spkg all over the place.
