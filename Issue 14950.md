Keywords: quivers, representations, Kac-polynomial

Compute the number of isomorphism classes of absolutely indecomposable representations of a quiver with a given dimension vector using the Kac-Stanley formula (see _Root systems, representations of quivers and invariant theory_ by Victor G. Kac).

Hey Amri,

Here's my initial work, but something isn't correct. I think what's going wrong is when I'm trying to do the log portion... I'm still looking into it.

Best,

Travis

Changing keywords from "quivers, representations, Kac-polynomial" to "quiver, representation, Kac-polynomial".

I have made a new branch at `u/chapoton/15187` where I try to use the correct formulas.

But I think that the naive approach is doomed to fail, as we probably need to compute
inside the tensor product of r copies of `Sym`.
