At least using Python2 it is faster to do `list(D.items())`

```
sage: import six
sage: D = {i:i for i in range(10)}
sage: %timeit list(six.iteritems(D))
The slowest run took 88.95 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.5 µs per loop
sage: %timeit list(D.items())
1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.11 µs per loop
sage: D = {i:i for i in range(100)}
sage: %timeit list(six.iteritems(D))
100000 loops, best of 3: 7.27 µs per loop
sage: %timeit list(D.items())

```

Granted, it is not necessarily memory efficient, but I think speed in `functor.pyx` is more important. Same comment can be applied for the other similar changes, including `values()`.

Why do you still use `keys()` in `generic_graph.py`?

In `matrix_generic_sparse.pyx`, I don't think you need the `list`:

```
for key in list(entries):
```

Similar for `reset.pyx`, `conway_polynomials.py`, and `polydict.pyx`. Likewise, I don't understand the need for the change in `decorators.py`.

No specific reason--I guess i wasn't sure if the return value there was actually a dict or not, but it's harmless either way.  In this case I think having the `.keys()` is almost better from a documentation perspective.

You do--in all those cases the dict being looped over is modified in the loops so you must make a list first.

The change in `functor.pyx` is to its `__reduce__` method.  Is there really a reason that's critical?  Some difference like this pales in comparison to the overall process of creating a pickle from an object.
