Works for me with and without flint 2.6.0.

Tested the entire geometry folder and the seems to work (with pynormaliz).

Thank you for the quick fix.

thanks for testing!

Btw, tested on debian buster.

The ticket looks fine to me, but I would wait for some confirmation on different systems.

so patching flint 2.6.0 was not needed in the end?


---

Comment by @kliem created at 2020-06-08 10:59:35

I just pulled `public/packages/flint260`, so I guess I did patch.

Either way I'm not sure I entirely understand which patch was needed for what.

This patch is probably needed, but there is no doctest in sage exposing it.

I have a bunch of patched version of flint functions in e-antic. There is one more. The patch to flint is not needed for e-antic to work. But the function `fmpq_poly_add_fmpq` is indeed broken.

The patch corresponds to this PR https://github.com/wbhart/flint2/pull/766

With patches to flint 2.6 all over the place now, it would be good to have all e-antic flint patches upstreamed, so that everything is in one place and hopefully made obsolete by the next flint release.

Tested on macOS.

Oh - there's 0.1.7 now?


---

Comment by vdelecroix created at 2020-06-17 06:44:27

0.1.7 fixes a bug in printing infinities.


---

Comment by vdelecroix created at 2020-06-17 06:44:50

The bug was only visible on macOS. Did you run the testsuite?

e_antic needs an update to deal with flint 2.6.1, otherwise

I'd say it might be better to rely on a meaningful test to test for a new enough flint, and not just use the version number.

Something akin to what we do in `build/pkgs/flint/spkg-configure.m4` - where we check for presence of a function that only appeared in Flint 2.5.0.
The difference between 2.5.0 and 2.5.3 is quite small, just some minor bug fixes, so perhaps you can steal the test from `build/pkgs/flint/spkg-configure.m4`, and use it, instead of version grepping?

See #30262 for the e-antic 0.1.8 upgrade (thanks, Vincent, for making the release)
