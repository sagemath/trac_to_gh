It all depends how the "flask notebook" should be merged into Sage.

not sure if I should be answering this, but i am guessing it will become a separate spkg. Is there an obvious problem with this?

Rado, do you mean a new spkg in addition to the existing "sagenb" or will it be inside "sagenb"?

There is no problem with this but I think it is something that you really should think about.  As I mentioned on [http://groups.google.com/group/sage-release/browse_frm/thread/758ac9a5106f5d4f](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-release/browse_frm/thread/758ac9a5106f5d4f), I would like the flask notebook to be *either*

(a) 100% part of Sage, in which case it is simply a set of patches on Trac
which should be merged in the usual way by the Sage release manager.

(b) 0% part of Sage, i.e. a completely separate project with a separate release manager and a separate bug tracker which will give me a complete spkg to be merged into Sage.

I believe that anything between these two extremes would create extra complications.  Currently, option (a) holds for sagenb.
I would not find it a problem if it starts out as (b) in the development phase but once it's merged it reverts back to (a), i.e. part of Sage.

Also keep in mind that a few tickets deal mostly with the Sage library but still need patches to sagenb, so maybe (a) would be a slightly better solution.  Recent examples: #9976, #10052.
