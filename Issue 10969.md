I understand that there is a notebook rewrite going on, but we'd really appreciate it if there was a more official way to style a notebook server. Maybe we should look into providing a similar patch for the new flask server as well.

looks good. merged in the flask rewrite of the notebook. Added checking if the directory actually exists.

What is the procedure to close notebook tickets? This was merged in the flask notebook, so it can be closed.

It all depends how the "flask notebook" should be merged into Sage.

not sure if I should be answering this, but i am guessing it will become a separate spkg. Is there an obvious problem with this?

Rado, do you mean a new spkg in addition to the existing "sagenb" or will it be inside "sagenb"?

There is no problem with this but I think it is something that you really should think about.  As I mentioned on [http://groups.google.com/group/sage-release/browse_frm/thread/758ac9a5106f5d4f](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-release/browse_frm/thread/758ac9a5106f5d4f), I would like the flask notebook to be _either_

(a) 100% part of Sage, in which case it is simply a set of patches on Trac
which should be merged in the usual way by the Sage release manager.

(b) 0% part of Sage, i.e. a completely separate project with a separate release manager and a separate bug tracker which will give me a complete spkg to be merged into Sage.

I believe that anything between these two extremes would create extra complications.  Currently, option (a) holds for sagenb.
I would not find it a problem if it starts out as (b) in the development phase but once it's merged it reverts back to (a), i.e. part of Sage.

Also keep in mind that a few tickets deal mostly with the Sage library but still need patches to sagenb, so maybe (a) would be a slightly better solution.  Recent examples: #9976, #10052.
