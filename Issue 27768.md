SAGE_SPKG_CONFIGURE_GCC should be called to configure the compiler's options before any place that uses it (in particular c++ is sensitive in this sense, see #27265)

Part of me still has to think there's another way, but without wanting to spend a lot of time on it myself, this does make sense for now to solve the problem.  I just tested and am certainly satisfied that it works.
