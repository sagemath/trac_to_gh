Issue created by migration from Trac.

Rather than group things by module, I've trying to group things by type of change per Jeroen's stated preference.

These are straightforward minor bytes/str fixes, all justified through the test suites for the relevant modules.

I don't agree with the changes to bitsets, I moved that to #24852. Everything else looks OK.

Fixed the missing import, and one other issue that the tests found.  Should be able to set back to positive review pending patchbot results.
