This improves the references in

- `src/doc/en/thematic_tutorials/geometry/polyhedra_tutorial.rst`
- `src/sage/coding/self_dual_codes.py`
- `src/sage/combinat/rsk.py`
- `src/sage/groups/abelian_gps/abelian_group.py`
- `src/sage/matrix/matrix0.pyx`

moving one of them to `src/doc/en/reference/references/index.rst`.

If you don't plan to move more refs to the main
references file here, good to go.

Le patchbot signale uniquement quelques affectations non utilisées.

Dans `src/sage/coding/self_dual_codes.py`:

```
576:9 local variable 'I18' is assigned to but never used
594:9 local variable 'G' is assigned to but never used
691:9 local variable 'J20' is assigned to but never used
701:9 local variable 'genmat2' is assigned to but never used
719:9 local variable 'K20' is assigned to but never used
```


Je ne sais pas si c'est à corriger, ici ou ailleurs.
