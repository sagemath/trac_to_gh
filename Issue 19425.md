I hate loops,
I hate multiple edges,
I hate edge labels.

A colleague of mine recently reported very slow performances with our graphs, and he was using edge labels. There were.... Let's say "obvious loss of performances" to stay calm.

If you are sensitive to bad algorithms, be warned -- what you will see while reviewing this branch may shock you.
