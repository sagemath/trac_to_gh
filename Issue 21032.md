In testing, I just noticed that the problem doesn't occur on 6.9 :-)

I suggest to replace the patch by

```
         if exclude is None:
             exclude = [PLAIN_TEXT]
         else:
             exclude = list(exclude) + [PLAIN_TEXT]
```

which would be more readable, but otherwise looks good: the test does not pass without and does with the patch, and everything builds just fine.  Thank you!
