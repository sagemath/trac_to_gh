Should work now, as #25588 is closed.

True. Now fixed.

Why not have the `_random_*` functions as methods of the finite posets (in maybe the category)?

I was just thinking that they are not interesting outside testing. Can be "published" of course.

> (in maybe the category)?

Nope, if we suppose that the functions in the category only needs an `less_or_equal`-function.

Well, people may also want test random things in some (perhaps large) poset, so I could see a benefit from having these be public methods of `FinitePoset`.

As you wish. Then I also think about better algorithm for that.

Once #25716 is ready, I will review both.
