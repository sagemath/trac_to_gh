I am expecting this all to make sense and I don't think it's going to.

Placing "python" later in the list might do weird things on Gentoo, where `eselect python` is used to select the system python (what "python" does). If someone has selected python-3.6 but happens to have 3.8 installed, the script will choose 3.8 instead. I don't foresee a real problem here, just mentioning it for posterity.

I would suggest `$()` in configure.ac over backticks again, but other than it looks OK.

Right :)

That's fine. The `sage-system-python` -- if not abused (see #29355) -- is used in a very limited context only.
