# Issue 20347: Regular partitions: 1-regular partitions are mishandled on occasion

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Keywords: partition, regular partition, border case

1-regular partitions exist (although there is just one of them -- the empty one). Not all of the code behaves well at \ell=1, though; e.g., the iterator runs infinite loops once it's past [].

Fixed a couple little things, one of which predated this ticket.

I don't know if there is an established way of guaranteeing that any function/method that takes a regular partition will still work with a 1-regular partition. Barring that, the only criterion are the doctests, right? Everything else LGTM.

Thanks.

No, I don't think there is such a way other than those functions/methods having explicit checks. This is a degenerate case in terms of my applications (there is not really an [affine] sl<sub>1</sub>), so I'm not really worried.
