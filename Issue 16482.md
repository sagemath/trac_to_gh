Keywords: gap, bignum, expect, pexpect

As first reported in #15625 (comment:7) with `lucas_number1`, the same problem is encountered with gap evaluation of Stirling numbers:

```
sage: stirling_number1(1000,2)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

    650     """
    651     return Integer(gap.eval("Stirling1({0},{1})".format(Integer(n),
--> 652                                                         Integer(k))))

TypeError: unable to convert x (=<integer 301...000 (2566 digits)>) to an integer
```

Alternatively, this ticket may discuss abandoning the GAP expect interface for such big number results and use libpari instead.

OK, now that strings get to GAP, back they get as `GapElement_List` of chars:

```
sage: ans = libgap.eval("UnorderedTuples(['a', 'b', 'c'],2)"); ans
[ "aa", "ab", "ac", "bb", "bc", "cc" ]
sage: type(ans[0])
<type 'sage.libs.gap.element.GapElement_List'>
sage: ans.sage()
[["'a'", "'a'"],
 ["'a'", "'b'"],
 ["'a'", "'c'"],
 ["'b'", "'b'"],
 ["'b'", "'c'"],
 ["'c'", "'c'"]]
```

Shouldn't lists of chars be converted to strings?

It felt more natural to give tuples of chars as string, but tuples of char+string as list of strings. If the latter had been the original behaviour the GAP T_CHAR hassle wouldn't have been necessary.
