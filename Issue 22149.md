I agree. I put that there because I thought "algebraic structures" are more mathematically *basic* than "rings and fields". Where do you think is better place for "algebraic structures"? 

The purpose of this ticket is to improve the TOC than to make it perfect, which I think is impossible as we all may have different ideas...

I did not intend to go down to that level, but let's do that. I think we need to keep "Algebraic Geometry" section. How about this?

```
Algebraic Geometry
--------------------

Plane Curves

Elliptic and Hyperelliptic Curves

Then do you think "Modular Abelian Varieties" also should go under "Arithmetic Geometry"?

Why would numerical optimisation be in "Special topics", but "SAT solvers" not?
(these are close to each other topics, if you asked me).

Good idea to review this index.

Some thoughts:

* Does it really make sense that `Cryptography` is not listed under the same headline as `Coding Theory`? Why not put `Cryptography`, `Symbolic Logic`, and `SAT Solvers` under `Discrete Mathematics`?

* I now realise that clicking on `Basic Infrastructure` goes to an index with the immensely useful list of `Mathematical Data Structures`. Perhaps the headline should therefore instead be `Core infrastructure and Mathematical Data structures`?

* What about putting `Other Algebraic Structures` after `Discrete Mathematics`?

* What about putting `Calculus` earlier, right after `Linear Algebra` -- most students will use Sage for calculus. 

* I agree with Dima that `Numberical Optimization` is a weird category that I can't figure out where should go, but that it is semantically linked to SAT Solvers. Perhaps they should simply have their own headline called `Solvers` or something.

`Numerical Optimization` should be split into parts. It's a weird mix of discrete optimization (Knapsack)--- out of place there, as it's not "numerical", but discrete, with numerical root finding, least squares approximation, and optimization of functions of one variable, and linear (LP), integer linear (ILP)---again, a discrete problem--- and semidefinite programming (SDP).

By right, LP and SDP should be put into its own "Convex optimization", Knapsack and ILP into "Discrete optimization", and univariate things into "Calculus/numerical methods".

Note that ILP and LP are solved by the same frontend, specifying appropriate parameters, so I don't quite know how to structure the corresponding documentation.

I moved `Symbolic Logic` to under `Discrete Mathematics` as suggested.

It is controversial if we could see cryptography as a branch of discrete mathematics in traditional sense. I personally do not agree.
 
> I now realise that clicking on `Basic Infrastructure` goes to an index with the immensely useful list of `Mathematical Data Structures`. Perhaps the headline should therefore instead be `Core infrastructure and Mathematical Data structures`?

The title `Basic infrastructure` is short and appropriate to keep the list under it. I would keep it.

> What about putting `Other Algebraic Structures` after `Discrete Mathematics`?

Done.

> What about putting `Calculus` earlier, right after `Linear Algebra` -- most students will use Sage for calculus. 

Done. Also `Probability and statistics` still follows it.

> I agree with Dima that `Numberical Optimization` is a weird category that I can't figure out where should go, but that it is semantically linked to SAT Solvers. Perhaps they should simply have their own headline called `Solvers` or something.

`Numerical optimization` section seems to require a rearrangement on its own level. This ticket is not intended for that. I will open a separate one so that further discussions could be carried on there.

It is certainly short but not appropriate. The heading "Basic infrastructure" sounds like something I shouldn't care about as a user (together with Parent, Element, the coercion framework and all that jazz). In complete opposition to this, it is *immensely* useful for a user to know the basic mathematical data structures.

OK, I'd like to propose few more changes.

* rename: Calculus -> Calculus and Analysis
* move Numerical Optimization to  Calculus and Analysis
* move Cryprography and SAT Solvers to Discrete Mathematics
* remove the heading Special Topics (as it's empty after these moves).

Otherwise it looks better already...
