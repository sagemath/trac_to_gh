# Issue 22149: Rearrange the table of contents of the reference manual

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/22386

Original creator: klee

Original creation time: 2017-02-15 22:05:26

As I see it, the current table of contents of the reference manual needs some rearrangement.

For non-mathematicians, the integers, rationals, reals, and complexes are going to be more familiar and useful than monoids, groups, semirings, and algebras. So moving the latter earlier does not put the topics with wider interest first.

I agree. I put that there because I thought "algebraic structures" are more mathematically *basic* than "rings and fields". Where do you think is better place for "algebraic structures"? 

The purpose of this ticket is to improve the TOC than to make it perfect, which I think is impossible as we all may have different ideas...

Where it was before, after basic rings and fields and linear algebra.

Most things in elliptic curves is number theory not algebraic geometry. Best change the title of that new section to Arithmetic geometry and put it after number theory.


---

Comment by klee created at 2017-02-17 12:59:48

I did not intend to go down to that level, but let's do that. I think we need to keep "Algebraic Geometry" section. How about this?

```
Algebraic Geometry
--------------------
Schemes
Plane Curves

Number Theory
---------------
...

Arithmetic Geometry
---------------------

Elliptic and Hyperelliptic Curves
```


Then do you think "Modular Abelian Varieties" also should go under "Arithmetic Geometry"?


---

Comment by wuthrich created at 2017-02-17 15:08:24

I did not mean to split it up further. Just replace "Algebraic geometry" with "Arithmetic geometry" or "Algebraic and arithmetic geometry". Then it is clear that this section will contain lots of number theory, too. No I would not move modular abelian varieties.


---

Comment by klee created at 2017-02-17 19:29:45

I think it is good to have both "Algebraic Geometry" and "Arithmetic Geometry", and to keep

Schemes

Plane Curves

under "Algebraic Geometry" section. Why not?

It is not easy to separate out algebraic geometry from arithmetic geometry in Sage. So I follow wuthrich's suggestion.

Comment by dimpase created at 2017-02-28 08:46:08

Why would numerical optimisation be in "Special topics", but "SAT solvers" not?
(these are close to each other topics, if you asked me).

And "numerical" is misleading in itself---for instance we have arbitrary precision LP solvers which output exact answers, and this is very close to other polyhedral computation tools.

Good idea to review this index.

Some thoughts:

* Does it really make sense that `Cryptography` is not listed under the same headline as `Coding Theory`? Why not put `Cryptography`, `Symbolic Logic`, and `SAT Solvers` under `Discrete Mathematics`?

* I now realise that clicking on `Basic Infrastructure` goes to an index with the immensely useful list of `Mathematical Data Structures`. Perhaps the headline should therefore instead be `Core infrastructure and Mathematical Data structures`?

* What about putting `Other Algebraic Structures` after `Discrete Mathematics`?

* What about putting `Calculus` earlier, right after `Linear Algebra` -- most students will use Sage for calculus. 

* I agree with Dima that `Numberical Optimization` is a weird category that I can't figure out where should go, but that it is semantically linked to SAT Solvers. Perhaps they should simply have their own headline called `Solvers` or something.

`Numerical Optimization` should be split into parts. It's a weird mix of discrete optimization (Knapsack)--- out of place there, as it's not "numerical", but discrete, with numerical root finding, least squares approximation, and optimization of functions of one variable, and linear (LP), integer linear (ILP)---again, a discrete problem--- and semidefinite programming (SDP).

By right, LP and SDP should be put into its own "Convex optimization", Knapsack and ILP into "Discrete optimization", and univariate things into "Calculus/numerical methods". I also think that the code for the latter and for Knapsack should be split into separate files - currently they are all dumped in `numerical/optimize.py`, which also contains a little function to demonstrate the direct use of `cvxopt` LP solver---the latter should also be somewhere else. 

Note that ILP and LP are solved by the same frontend, specifying appropriate parameters, so I don't quite know how to structure the corresponding documentation.
(Probably one would have to link to `.rst` files that further point at the concrete code documentation?)

I moved `Symbolic Logic` to under `Discrete Mathematics` as suggested.

It is controversial if we could see cryptography as a branch of discrete mathematics in traditional sense. I personally do not agree.
 
> I now realise that clicking on `Basic Infrastructure` goes to an index with the immensely useful list of `Mathematical Data Structures`. Perhaps the headline should therefore instead be `Core infrastructure and Mathematical Data structures`?

The title `Basic infrastructure` is short and appropriate to keep the list under it. I would keep it.

> What about putting `Other Algebraic Structures` after `Discrete Mathematics`?

Done.

> What about putting `Calculus` earlier, right after `Linear Algebra` -- most students will use Sage for calculus. 

Done. Also `Probability and statistics` still follows it.

> I agree with Dima that `Numberical Optimization` is a weird category that I can't figure out where should go, but that it is semantically linked to SAT Solvers. Perhaps they should simply have their own headline called `Solvers` or something.

`Numerical optimization` section seems to require a rearrangement on its own level. This ticket is not intended for that. I will open a separate one so that further discussions could be carried on there.

Thanks for the changes. I agree that the Numerical Optimization issues can be considered as beyond this ticket.

I see your point, and I won't insist on anything. One could, however, see the role of cryptography in the mathematics software Sage as being the discrete mathematics side of cryptography. There is no numerical side to crypto, for instance.

It is certainly short but not appropriate. The heading "Basic infrastructure" sounds like something I shouldn't care about as a user (together with Parent, Element, the coercion framework and all that jazz). In complete opposition to this, it is *immensely* useful for a user to know the basic mathematical data structures. Besides, would you really look under the heading `Basic Infrastructure` for `Subset`?

I moved `Sets` to a new `Mathematcal Structures` section. This also put `Monoids` and others back before `Discrete Mathematics`. Leave comments if you do not like this.

OK, I'd like to propose few more changes.

* rename: Calculus -> Calculus and Analysis
* move Numerical Optimization to  Calculus and Analysis
* move Cryprography and SAT Solvers to Discrete Mathematics
* remove the heading Special Topics (as it's empty after these moves).

Otherwise it looks better already...
