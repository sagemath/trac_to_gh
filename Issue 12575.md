# Issue 12575: is_R_algebra is useless and wrong and should be deleted

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: JStarx

Original creation time: 2012-03-26 05:32:45

Assignee: AlexGhitza

Keywords: algebra, all.py

In algebras/all.py we find the following function:


```
def is_R_algebra(Q, R):
    # TODO: do something nontrivial when morphisms are defined.
    return True
```


A search of the source shows that this function is not used anywhere else in sage, and good thing too, cause it's obviously wrong.

JStarx's patch with newline

Attachment

Apply trac12747-newline.patch

(for the patchbot). This function is totally laughable, and the patch looks fine except for one breathtakingly trivial niggle: in Sage we generally like code files to end with a newline character, so I restored the newline you had shaved off the end of algebras/all.py. I guess that single newline doesn't merit a re-review, so I'm setting this to positive review.
