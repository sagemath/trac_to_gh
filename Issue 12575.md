Assignee: AlexGhitza

Keywords: algebra, all.py

In algebras/all.py we find the following function:


```
def is_R_algebra(Q, R):
    # TODO: do something nontrivial when morphisms are defined.
    return True
```


A search of the source shows that this function is not used anywhere else in sage, and good thing too, cause it's obviously wrong.
