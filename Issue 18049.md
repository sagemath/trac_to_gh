# Issue 18049: Region plot fails when there is equation condition

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: yzh

Original creation time: 2015-04-23 00:20:42

CC:  kcrisman mkoeppe vdelecroix

Keywords: region_plot

region_plot can't deal with equations. For example the condition `x == 0` is treated as `x < 0`.

```
sage: x, y = var('x, y')
sage: region_plot([x == 0], (x, -1, 1), (y, -1, 1))
sage: region_plot([x^2+y^2==1, x<y], (x, -1, 1), (y, -1, 1))
```

I am having an initial look at this ticket. Can you change the `ticket #12345` to the `:trac:`12345`` format. Thanks. :)

Why is there a duplicate ticket at #16907?

`@`vdelecroix: It is not quite a duplicate, but yzh has put both the patches in the same branch and has the same branch in both the tickets. It is fine though, we can close both the tickets at the same time, and close that one as a duplicate of this for merging purposes, or remove the branch from the other ticket.

`@`yzh: I finally had the time to look into it. The patch looks all good to me except for the warn part. Can you change that to the following

```
from warnings import warn
warn("There are at least 2 equations;......")
```

This will give the warning just once to the user _per sage session_, instead of each time a similar command is run. After that it is up to the user to take note of this warning.

Sorry for not noticing that earlier. It passes all tests in plot/ now. The Patchbot is  also happy.
