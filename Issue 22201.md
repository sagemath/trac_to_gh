I can't remember now. Possibly I was messing around with a solution to #21732 or #22088 or just getting the Debian package working in the first place.

But the logic shouldn't break just because I might've been doing unusual things. There's already logic to remove a regular file or a working symlink to a file, so we should also remove broken symlinks.

I tweaked what you suggested to be a bit shorter. It's not fully EAFP but I think the brevity makes up for it.

Interestingly on Python3 they have a special subclass of OSError called IsADirectoryError that would make this code even shorter, but never mind.

I realised the previous version (in comment:10) is wrong, here is an updated version. If you don't like it, I can also do the longer EAFP version that you posted earlier.

I actually think the first one (my original commit) is best, it's slightly long-winded but at least the error messages are exact. With both this recent version and your EAFP version, the error messages could be misleading, e.g.

Recent version:
- real problem: grand-child file can't be removed because child directory is not writable
- raised error: static_dir is a directory

EAFP version:
- real problem: parent directory is not writable
- raised error: static_dir is not a directory
