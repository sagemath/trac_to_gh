Before:

```
sage: NF.<a> = NumberField(x^7 + 2, embedding=QQbar(-2)^(1/7))
sage: b = -7*a^6 + 3*a^4 - 5*a^3 + 2*a^2 - 4
sage: %timeit b._coefficients()
The slowest run took 16.68 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
100000 loops, best of 3: 2.34 µs per loop
```

After:

```
sage: %timeit b._coefficients()
The slowest run took 9.44 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.69 µs per loop
```
