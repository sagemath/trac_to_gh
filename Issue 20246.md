I slightly prefer `QQ((1,2))` over `QQ.one()/2`.

I suggest to remove the change to the `dim()` call and use #20485 instead.

Another detail: better write `QQ((-1, 2))` instead of `-QQ((1, 2))` and add a doctest for `zeta__exact(0)`.

patchbot failures are coming from the dependency being not integrated in the branch

Replying to [comment:12 chapoton]:
> patchbot failures are coming from the dependency being not integrated in the branch

That's not completely true. Some are, but some are really genuine failures.
