Some deprecation in sandpile are in fact already removed, but still present in lazy imports. This breaks ups `vars()` and `locals()`.

Namely, these are `grid_sandpile` and `complete_sandpile`.

In fact, we should clean up everything that was deprecated in #18618.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/22933

Deprecated was placing them into the global namespace. These functions are still used internally in the module.
