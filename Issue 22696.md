Some deprecation in sandpile are in fact already removed, but still present in lazy imports. This breaks ups `vars()` and `locals()`.

Namely, these are `grid_sandpile` and `complete_sandpile`.

In fact, we should clean up everything that was deprecated in #18618.

Why is `random_digraph` no longer deprecated? (I know nothing about the sandpiles code, just wondering.)

There are several other places where you are removing deprecation warnings without removing the (previously) deprecated functions.

Deprecated was placing them into the global namespace. These functions are still used internally in the module.

OK, I've removed two removable deprecated functions.

This is not an issue that we should deal with on this ticket, but according to the deprecation notices, someone should move the functionality from `sandlib` to the catalog of examples accessible using `sandpiles`.
