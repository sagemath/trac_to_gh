# Issue 29641: Remove `sage -twistd` from `src/bin/sage`

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29878

Original creator: jhpalmieri

Original creation time: 2020-06-16 20:39:49

There is no `twistd` executable anymore, since the `twisted` package is being removed in #29754. So let's remove the corresponding command-line option to `sage`.

By the way, for a separate ticket: the OS X app could use some attention. If I run `git grep twistd src`, I see

```
src/mac-app/AppController.m:    NSString *pidFile = [@"~/.sage/sage_notebook.sagenb/twistd.pid" stringByStandardizingPath];
src/mac-app/English.lproj/MainMenu.nib/designable.nib:                                        <menuItem title="twistd" id="1456">
src/mac-app/English.lproj/MainMenu.nib/designable.nib:                                        <menuItem title="twistd" id="1603">
Binary file src/mac-app/English.lproj/MainMenu.nib/keyedobjects.nib matches
src/mac-app/sage-is-running-on-port.sh:if [ ! -e "$PID_FILE" ] && [ -e ~/.sage/sage_notebook.sagenb/twistd.pid ]; then
src/mac-app/sage-is-running-on-port.sh:    PID_FILE=${1-~/.sage/sage_notebook.sagenb/twistd.pid}
src/mac-app/sage-is-running-on-port.sh:    if [ ! -e "$PID_FILE" ] && [ -e ~/.sage/sage_notebook.sagenb/twistd.pid ]; then
src/mac-app/sage-is-running-on-port.sh:        PID_FILE=${1-~/.sage/sage_notebook.sagenb/twistd.pid}
```

I don't know anything about Mac apps, so I don't know if this is anything to be concerned about.
