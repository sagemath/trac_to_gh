William Stein reports this problem while building the GCC spkg:

make[3]: *** [stage1-bubble] Error 2

```


The problem seems to be an outdated XCode version which has a broken GCC.  Building with clang instead succeeded.  Therefore, I propose to set "CC=clang" by default on OS X 10.7 or later in sage-env.

Shouldn't that currently only be done if we really (decide to) build the GCC spkg, i.e., in `spkg/install` (rather than `sage-env`)?

(Sage currently wouldn't fully build with Clang [3.x].)

Also, are all possible versions of XCode's Clang capable of building GCC?

Or in `sage-env` but depending on `SAGE_BUILD_TOOLCHAIN`.

> (Sage currently wouldn't fully build with Clang [3.x].)
It doesn't build with Apple's GCC either... but you might have a point, in case somebody decides to install a custom GCC outside of Sage.

I'm not sure.  But at least one person reported being able to build GCC with Apple's Clang but not with Apple's GCC.

Quoting William:

  *I dropped this [Sage 5.0.beta13] on my OS X 10.7.x laptop, didn't type anything special, typed "make ptestlong", and came back later to see "All tests passed!".  I.e., it built perfectly.*

Something worth to add to the README(?) / installation instructions.

Perhaps some might have a broken [Apple] GCC, while others may have a Clang version of Apple not suited to build GCC.  Or just add that one should install the latest version of XCode on MacOS X 10.7.x, as William suggested.

> Changed the patch to only set `CC=clang` if `[ "$SAGE_BUILD_TOOLCHAIN" = yes ]`.

Patch looks ok (and applies to beta13), I just still wonder whether that shouldn't simply be done in `spkg/install` (where also `SAGE_BUILD_TOOLCHAIN` is set; it isn't set anywhere else).

Is there any scenario where a script sourcing `sage-env` (or called by one which does) would need `CC=clang` if `SAGE_BUILD_TOOLCHAIN=yes`, but **isn't** (indirectly) called by `spkg/install` / the "second level" `make`?  (Probably you have some further plans...)

I don't think I'm going to actually test that (on Lion), so rather "theoretical" positive review.  (If someone objects, of course feel free to revert it.)
