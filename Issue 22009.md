This is clearly a change to better, so I mark this as positive review.

I am not very sure about every change. Sometimes


```
not( ((some + thing) / long - list * (of - operations)) ) and . . .
```


might be better than


```
not(((some + thing) / long - list * (of - operations))) and . . .
```


But in the


```
s += [str(round( el_color[edge][0],4)), ',']
```


extra spaces are not needed.
