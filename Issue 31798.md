# Issue 31798: Multiplier Spectra for P^N, N > 1

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/32035

Original creator: @EnderWannabe

Original creation time: 2021-06-22 20:33:25

CC:  bhutz

Keywords: gsoc2021

Currently the multiplier spectra function for dynamical systems on P^N throws a NotImplementedError when N > 1.

This ticket aims to implement that functionality.

I see no issues with functionality. A few minor doc things and one extra `if`.

- the default is formal=False, so the first main paragraph should not say it computes the formal unless the user specifies otherwise (i.e., that logic should be reversed)

- end of second paragraph - "critical points" should be "periodic points"

- If False, and he map is  -> "the"

- use_algebraic_closure - "critical points" should be "periodic points"


- no examples of algebraic closures in dimension > 1

- line 4711 -- need line wrap

- line 4798 -- extra word in comment ("which *point* the point")

- line 4817 -- aren't we already in the dimension == 1 case?



- looks like this needs to be updated for the latest preperiodic point ticket (31944)

The commit fixed a couple of the missed doc issues, but the use_algebraic_closure example is still an issue and exposes an problem. If you only use the base_field when it is false you are missing periodic points and hence not returning the full multiplier spectrum.

One option is to count the number of points you have (with multiplicity) and throw an error if the base field doesn't contain them all.

Replying to [comment:14 bhutz]:

Good catch. Added such a check.

The merge conflict resolution looks ok with all tests passing.
