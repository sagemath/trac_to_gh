 * to find recurrence for the summand
 * to sum over the recurrence found above

Hi Karen, the Author: trac ticket field specifies the author of the code (if such is present). If you only want to report the ticket your authorship is specified in the Reported by: field automatically.

In other words, the fact that you wrote "Karen Kohl" as Author implies to me that you are actually going to work on this ticket.
