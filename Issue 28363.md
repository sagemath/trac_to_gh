Keywords: manifolds, pushforward

At this stage, the pushforward of a vector field `v` along a differentiable map `Phi` reads `Phi^*v`. This contradicts the common literature where the pushforward usually writes `Phi_*v`.

In this ticket, a discussion is wanted and eventually a correction is performed.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28600

It seems to me that in some texts, `Phi^*` and `Phi_*` are used to denote respectively the pushforward and the pullback. I'll look for some precise references.

Yeah, it's always about conventions and historical remains...

Basically, this is not completely trustworthy, but [here](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/68788/idea-of-the-star-position-in-pullback-pushforward-notation) is an approach of explaination on stackexchange.

Moreover, I agree that in the common literature, the pushforward is denoted by `Phi_*` while the pullback is denoted by `Phi^*`. In particular, this holds for Lee's textbooks, which we use as references in the documentation of manifolds. So I am fully OK in adopting such notation.

OK, I found it: it is not in the documentation but in the code of the method `pushforward()`, in lines 1273 and 1275 of `src/sage/manifolds/differentiable/diff_map.py`.

Looks good to me. All tests passed and the docbuild looks fine. The notebooks run fine as well. Remember, you should edit the comments in the notebook files on your homepage, too.

Should I give a positive review?
