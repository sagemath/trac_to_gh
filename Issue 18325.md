On the road to `frattini_sublattice()`... but first a smaller function.

1) What the ¤$#`@``@`& for sphinx complains about indentation?

2) Should I mention the "algorithm"? That is, to say that I just get a random permutation `p` of elements and then try to add elements in `p` one by one, skipping those where adding it would generate whole lattice.

3) This is slower than it should be, because it is unneeded for `sublattice` to return a lattice (plain list would do). But I think that this is fast enought for at least testing.

4) What you say about `element_constructor` -parameter?

(Sidenote: I also added `sublattice()` to index of functions.)

Ready for review.

This is not perfect. For a bad example take


```
M3sub=LatticePoset({'a': [1,2,3], 1:['v', 4], 2:[4,'k'], 3:['o',4], 4:[5], 5:[6,13], 6:[7,11], 7:[8,14], 8:[9,12], 9:[10,15], 10:['y'], 'v':[11], 11:[12], 12:['y'], 'o':[13], 13:[14], 14:[15], 15:['y'], 'k':[10]})
```


that has 5-element sublattice that is very rarely returned from this function.
