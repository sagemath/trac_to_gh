CC:  @ClementPernet

Keywords: sd75

This ticket removes all the `.pxi` files in `sage/modules`, and replaces them by proper `.pxd/pyx` files.

It adds no new functionnality, but seems to be required to have a C++ binding to linbox.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/21321
