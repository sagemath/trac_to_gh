# Issue 639: run tests in parallel

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Assignee: was

It would be very cool if `sage -t` could run tests in parallel on a multicore machine. There would need to be some clever output redirection so all the test output didn't get mishmashed together.

Hehe, William told me that this feature has been requested about 30 times. And now it is in trac. But I wholly agree and had hoped that this could be accomplished.

+1 from me, without a doubt.

Cheers,

Michael
