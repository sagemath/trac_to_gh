Assignee: @LBrunswic

CC:  @egourgoulhon

Keywords: tensor, contraction, symmetries, tensor with indices, manifolds

One may want to add/contract tensors with indices in the following way : 
 
`T["<sup>ijklm_m]+T["</sup>mklij_m"]`

This entails to implement 
* _get_item_ method 
* _set_item_ method 
* _add_ method
which all keep track of the indices names.

Thanks for providing this functionality! The code looks nice. 
However, as revealed by the [patchbot](https://patchbot.sagemath.org/ticket/28787/), there are a few minor issues:
- running `sage -coverage src/sage/tensor/modules/tensor_with_indices.py` reveals incomplete coverage
- `SymmetricGroup` is imported but not used
- there are invalid escape sequences in the lines 

```
            if re.search("[()\[\]]",con) is not None:
                raise ValueError("No symmetry allowed")
            if re.search("[()\[\]]",cov) is not None:
                raise ValueError("No symmetry allowed")
```
  Most probably, you should prefix the string `"[()\[\]]"` with `r` to make it a raw string. *Side remark:* the error message passed to exceptions should start with a lower case letter; so please change `"No symmetry allowed"` to `"no symmetry allowed"`
- Building the documentation via `sage -docbuild reference/tensor_free_modules html` yields some errors, two of them being related to the characters `\]` and `\[` above and should be fixed with the `r` prefix

Actually, the patchbot reports are to be taken with a grain of salt. A human eye has always to take a look. Apart from the `EXAMPLE:` case pointed by Frédéric (maybe in that case the patchbot error was triggered by `EXAMPLE:` not being followed by an empty line), another case is some spurious report of unused import (see e.g. [this example](https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27865#comment:13)).
