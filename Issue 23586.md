Trying to fix that, one meets a strange phenomenon in

namely, there is just one line that is 

```

everybody else is an unbound method.

Several of these methods are defined in .pyx files: `pathwidth` in `vertex_separation.pyx`, `chromatic_polynomial` in `chrompoly.pyx`, etc. So there might be something else to explain the difference.
