How about if the sorting fails, you run a `sorted(foo, key=str)` instead so it becomes deterministic?

```

As Jeroen pointed out at #26966, `str` is not an injective function:

```
sage: L1 = [1.0 + 2^-52, 1.0]; L2 = reversed(L1)
sage: sorted(L1, key=str) == sorted(L2, key=str)
False
```

So it won't be deterministic even with `key=str`.

I don't have strong feelings about it. Does it matter if it produces different results on Python 2 vs. Python 3?

I don't think so (beyond the doctests). I tend to enjoy more deterministic results as it makes it easier to debug and write doctests.
