There is one remaining failure:

```

```

I don't know how to fix this.

Wait, I do know how to fix that last failure.

How about if the sorting fails, you run a `sorted(foo, key=str)` instead so it becomes deterministic?


---

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2019-05-14 01:11:47

As Jeroen pointed out at #26966, `str` is not an injective function:

```
sage: L1 = [1.0 + 2^-52, 1.0]; L2 = reversed(L1)
sage: sorted(L1, key=str) == sorted(L2, key=str)
False
```

So it won't be deterministic even with `key=str`.

Ah, right. Although I guess the weaker form of the general question would be should we try to make it as deterministic as possible?


---

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2019-05-14 01:38:37

I don't have strong feelings about it. Does it matter if it produces different results on Python 2 vs. Python 3?


---

I don't think so (beyond the doctests). I tend to enjoy more deterministic results as it makes it easier to debug and write doctests.

Here's a more deterministic version.

Resolution: fixed

I think this caused some breakage at #27863


---

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2019-05-23 16:45:45

I don't see anything in the changes here that would make any difference with Python 2 behavior.
