Seems to be a problem for digraphs also.

```
sage: G = graphs.CompleteGraph(4)
sage: G.all_paths(2,2)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
IndexError                                Traceback (most recent call last)
<snip>
  11495                     s=act_path_iter[-1].next()  # try to get the next neighbor/successor, ...
  11496                 except (StopIteration):         # ... if there is none ...
<snip>
IndexError: list index out of range
```

For this trivial situation, there is no "previous" iterator.  We could immediately return the trivial answer, or catch the exception, or place an empty iterator on the list.
