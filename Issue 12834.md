Seems to be a problem for digraphs also.


```
sage: G = graphs.CompleteGraph(4)
sage: G.all_paths(2,2)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
IndexError                                Traceback (most recent call last)
<snip>
  11495                     s=act_path_iter[-1].next()  # try to get the next neighbor/successor, ...
  11496                 except (StopIteration):         # ... if there is none ...
<snip>
IndexError: list index out of range
```


For this trivial situation, there is no "previous" iterator.  We could immediately return the trivial answer, or catch the exception, or place an empty iterator on the list.

Good fix.  Passes all tests in `sage/graphs` and documentation looks good.  Positive review.

This seems sensible to me.  Simultaneous positive review.
