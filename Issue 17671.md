In current develop, this almost works:

```
sage: r = integrate(abs(x), x, algorithm='fricas'); r
integral(abs(x), x)
sage: r.operands()
[abs(x), x]
sage: r.operands()[0].subs(x=-1)
abs(-1)
```


The cure is, as observed by `@`slelievre, to do `register_symbol` for `abs`.

there are merge commits than actual commits on your branch... which makes it very hard to read. You would better rewrite the branch.
