# Issue 15058: LinearMatroid.has_line_minor should catch NotImplementedError

The following code should not throw an error:


```
sage: R.<x,y> = ZZ['x','y']
sage: Q = R.quotient([x^2 - y + 1, y^3 + 3 * x - 7])
sage: M = LinearMatroid(ring=Q, reduced_matrix=Matrix([[1,0,1],[0,1,1]]))
sage: M.has_line_minor(3)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
NotImplementedError:
```


Easy solution: add NotImplementedError to the except clause in the code.

Added that exception clause. Now the same example raises another NotImplementedError, but one that gives more information. Essentially, computing ratios in that given ring Q is not possible, which is a problem in LinearMatroid._line_ratios().

So what is the policy here? Should has_line_minor() test if computing inverses is possible before handing the problem down?
