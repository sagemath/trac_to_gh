It seems we need to give the filename, not the file itself.

The command

```
sage -t --long --optional=sage,optional,external src/sage/misc/latex.py
```

gives

```
Using --optional=debian,external,glucose,pip,sage,sage_spkg

Yes, that's the right fix. Sorry I got it wrong.

One patchbot shows issues with doc. The other not. I think the docbuild issue is unrelated to the current ticket.

I agree.
