**This ticket is a follow-up to #10118 (merged in sage-4.6.1.alpha2)**

Here are some trivial problems in the file `SPKG.txt` of version ".p3" of the Sphinx package:

* In the section

```
## Dependencies

This depends on Jinja >= 2, Pygments >= 0.8, and docutils >= 0.4.
```

 we should have "Pygments >= 1.3.1" due to ticket #10290. But this is no biggy; it's a trivial typo that can either (i) be fixed in a new ticket, or (ii) fixed in the current ticket.

* In the section

```
* patches/pngmath.patch: This replaces \usepackage[utf8x]{inputenc}
  by \usepackage[utf8]{inputenc} in the LaTeX preamble for building
  images in the HTML documentation.  This change is done because some
  LaTeX installations have only utf8, not utf8x (utf8x adds support for
  much more Unicode characters, but these are needed used to typeset the
  mathematics in the Sage documentation).
```

 the fragment
 {{{
but these are needed used to typeset the
 }}}
 should be changed to
 {{{
but these are used to typeset the
 }}}

Tested on the following platforms:

* {sage.math, bsd.math, hawk}: Both HTML and PDF versions of documentation built OK. For the PDF version, building the reference manual produced some warnings about "unusable reference target", which are to do with relative links to other documents in the Sage standard documentation.

* {cleo, iras}.skynet: Sage 4.6.1.alpha2 fails to build on this machine, hence the documentation doesn't get built at all.

* {cicero, eno, lena, sextus, taurus, t2}: The HTML version of the documentation mostly built OK, but with warnings about a missing LaTeX installation. Consequently, the PDF version of the documentation can't be built.

* flavius.skynet -- The PDF version of the documentation built fine, but with some warnings about unusable relative links. The HTML version built with numerous warnings due to missing the dvipng command.

* {gcc11, gcc16}.fsffrance.org: The HTML version of all documents in the standard documentation mostly built OK, but with warnings about the missing command "dvipng". This machine has a LaTeX installation, but it is missing the file titlesec.sty, hence building the PDF version of any document in the standard documentation would hang at the error message:
 {{{

)

! LaTeX Error: File `titlesec.sty' not found.

I have an interesting (repeatable) error.

sage: An error occurred while installing sphinx-1.0.4.p3


This sort of mystified me, and retyping 'make' didn't help, until I
plugged my computer back into the Internet.  Then I got:


Processing dependencies for Sphinx==1.0.4
Searching for Jinja2>=2.2
Reading http://pypi.python.org/simple/Jinja2/

and all is well.

Is the internet now a prerequisite for building Sage?  Obviously it is
a prereq for downloading it, but in theory one would want to be able
to build it while offline (or to buy a CD with the source, or
whatever).  I am pretty sure that in the past this was not supposed to
be true.

Tested on the following machines together with sphinx-1.0.4.p4.spkg and jinja2-2.5.5.p0.spkg. I put these updated packages in the source tarball of Sage 4.6.1.alpha2 and built Sage from source. After a successful build from source, I grep'd through `install.log` for the word "Downloading" as follows:


```
$ grep -iw 'Downloading' install.log
```


Grep'ing through the various `install.log` files didn't show any signs of packages being downloaded during the build.

* {cleo, iras}.skynet: Sage didn't build from source, so the documentation can't be built at all.

* {cicero, eno, lena, sextus, taurus, t2}: The HTML version of the documentation built OK, but with warnings about a missing LaTeX installation so LaTeX expressions won't be nicely typeset in the generated HTML files. There wasn't a LaTeX installation on this machine, so I wasn't able to build the PDF version of the documentation. 

* flavius.skynet: The HTML version of the documentation built OK, but with warnings about the missing 'dvipng' command, so the LaTeX expressions won't be nicely typeset in the generated HTML files. The PDF version built OK.

* {gcc11, gcc16}.fsffrance.org: The HTML version of the documentation built OK. The PDF didn't build at all due to the following error:
 {{{
! LaTeX Error: File `titlesec.sty' not found.
 }}}
 The documentation build process didn't hang at the above error, but continued on until the end.

* rh.math: The HTML version of the documentation built OK, but with warnings about missing the command 'dvipng' so LaTeX expressions won't be nicely typeset in the generated HTML files. The PDF version of the documentation didn't build at all. The relevant error is:
 {{{
! LaTeX Error: File `utf8x.def' not found.
 }}}
 The documentation build process didn't hang at the above error, but continued on until the end.

* {bsd, hawk, sage}: Both the HTML and PDF versions of the documentation built OK.

I'm OK with all changes in the updated spkg. But note the following minor issues:

1. In the following line of `SPKG.txt`
 {{{
This depends on Jinja >= 2, Pygments >= 1.3.1, docutils >= 0.4.
 }}}
 the part "Jinja >= 2," should be changed to "Jinja >= 2.5.5," as per ticket #10423.
1. The change log for sphinx-1.0.4.p4 should reference the number of the current ticket.

If the above changes are made, this ticket should get a positive review.

I'd say >=2.2 as required by this Sphinx version; 2.5.5 is currently the latest.

Btw, any ideas about *Jinja2's* true dependencies (cf. [comment:ticket:10423:1 this comment])?

Upstream only explicitly mentions Python and setuptools (alternatively, preferably "distribute").

Stylewise, I would have used a `make` variable for redirecting `stdin`.

This could easily be modified without touching the patch at all.

I would also use `utf8` instead of `utf8x` *conditionally*, i.e., first check if `utf8x` is available.

It's more flexible and eases maintaining, in any case.

I don't like generally disabling things or introducing artificial limits just because there are problems on **some** platforms or installations.

In the case of `utf8x`, it's not unlikely someone would use it for his documents, or Sage documentation in other languages perhaps, and it should be more wide-spread in the future (while I assume disabling it in Sage will last for a long time...)

If that happens, we need to completely drop support for `utf8`.  A conditional build is also pointless in this case.
