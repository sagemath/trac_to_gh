# Issue 33989: Allow effective resistance method to work on graphs with multiple components

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/34226

Original creator: @harryrichman

Original creation time: 2022-07-26 11:24:02

Keywords: graph, resistance, component

The current implementation of effective resistance between two vertices of a graph fails if the graph is disconnected. If both vertices are in the same component, the effective resistance is a well-defined finite number. If vertices are in separate components, we modify effective resistance to return +Infinity.
