Keywords: graph, resistance, component

The current implementation of effective resistance between two vertices of a graph fails if the graph is disconnected. If both vertices are in the same component, the effective resistance is a well-defined finite number. If vertices are in separate components, we modify effective resistance to return +Infinity.
