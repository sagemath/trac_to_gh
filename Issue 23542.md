CC:  @fchapoton

The built-in function `globals()` is restricted in the module where it is defined. From Python doc

```
globals()

    Return a dictionary representing the current global symbol
    table. This is always the dictionary of the current module
    (inside a function or method, this is the module where it
     is defined, not the module from which it is called).
```

Its usage in `dev_tools.find_objects_from_name` is just completely wrong as it should check for the `sage` global namespace. Moreover, such check in globals would better be done in `import_statements` directly.

As reported in #19444 there is the following misbehavior

```
sage: import_statements('log')
# **Warning**: distinct objects with name 'log' in:
#   - sage.functions.log
#   - math
#   - sage.functions
#   - sage.misc.functional
from sage.misc.functional import log
```

that is corrected into

```
sage: import_statements('log')
from sage.functions.log import log
```
