# Issue 13416: initialization of padic polynomial fails for empty dictionary

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: saraedum

Original creation time: 2012-10-19 02:51:11

Assignee: roed

Polynomials over the padics can be initialized from dictionaries:

```
sage: R.<t> = Qp(3)[]
sage: f = R.one()
sage: R(f.dict())
```


However, this fails for empty dictionaries:

```
sage: f = R.zero()
sage: R(f.dict())
ValueError: max() arg is an empty sequence
```


The attached patch fixes this.

Looks fine.  My one comment would be that you can use `max(x.keys()) if x else 0` rather than  `max(x.keys()) if len(x) else 0`.  Let me know when you want it reviewed.
