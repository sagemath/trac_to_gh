# Issue 2623: 2.11.alpha0: repo consistency issue with sage/schemes/hyperelliptic_curves/hypellfrob/README

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/2623

Original creator: mabshoff

Original creation time: 2008-03-21 00:00:42

Assignee: mabshoff

sage/schemes/hyperelliptic_curves/hypellfrob/README needs to be added to MANIFEST.in so that `-sdist` picks it up.

Patch coming up.

Cheers,

Michael
