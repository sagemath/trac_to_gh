# Issue 11564: Linear time implementation of lex_BFS()

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: ddestrada

Original creation time: 2011-08-24 14:17:20

Assignee: jason, ncohen, rlm

CC:  dcoudert @kliem mjo

Keywords: lexbfs

The current implementation of lex_BFS() is quadratic, which is not optimal. The usual way to do it in linear time is through a clever use of doubly linked lists, but in [1] there is a way with static arrays, which I coded in Python.

There is one thing, though: in [2] there is a new algorithm for is_interval() that avoids PQ-trees, and just uses various passes of lex_BFS() (implemented with doubly linked lists).
So maybe in the long run it would be better to do it with doubly linked lists in Cython.

Hello Diego !!!

Same comment (see #11738) for this patch about the "build/" folder. I also expect that this patch breaks doctests in Sage's library, so please check it too, correcting the doctests themselves if it makes sense `:-)`

Thank you! Here I fixed the "build/" thing, but I'm having trouble running the tests (in OSX 10.7 and Ubuntu 11.04), so expect it to break some of them. I'm sorry.

Perhaps I can help you with this test problem ? The thing is that right now the patch does not seem to work :

On random interval graphs sometimes the is_interval function works, sometimes it does not... `^^;` 

I tested you patch after having applied #11738 and #11735 but I do not think this is where the bug comes from. Could you also add some comments to your code, along with a reference to the paper you are following for this implementation ? `:-)`

Perhaps we can help with your problem running doctests ? It something does not work on this side, it is another bug of Sage's ! `;-)`

I think this patch is working now and passes all the doctests. I'm sure the errors I get while doctesting are bugs of Sage 4.8 (for example, on both Ubuntu 10.10 and OS X 10.7 I get an error in line 15146 of generic_graph.py: "ValueError: Database has no tablegraph_data.").

Helloooooo Diego !!

I'm sorry but your patch can not be applied on top of the latest release of Sage, that is sage-5.0-beta11 (https://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-release/XnyN3tx4Bow/discussion). Plenty of stuff has been added in the 5.0-beta? series, and that is probably the explanation `:-)`

About your path, though : it removes the old code that computed (more slowly) a BFS ordering for the vertices. This being said, I think this code could still be useful to ... check that the new algorithm actually returns a correct BFS ordering ! Of course, as it is slower, this ordering should not be checked by default, but it would be nice to be able to run doctests which check for each computation of BFS ordering whether this ordering is indeed correct. This can be done by actually checking in turn that each vertex of the ordering is maximal at the moment when it is removed.

Do you think it could be possible to comment your code a bit more ? As it is, reading the paper to understand what happens seems to be the only alternative `:-)`

Hello,

This patch has been sleeping for very very long time.

I did a first git version of the patch with some corrections. This is far from final version and we have currently 2 implementations to ease tests. To use the new version, you need to set parameter `new_version=True`.

Since the code has no comments, it is hard to know whats going on. I have corrected at least one bug (a missing `j = l`), but I have the following issue:

```
sage: g = graphs.PathGraph(3).lexicographic_product(graphs.CompleteGraph(2))
sage: g.lex_BFS(reverse=True)
[(2, 1), (2, 0), (1, 1), (1, 0), (0, 1), (0, 0)]
sage: g.lex_BFS(reverse=True, new_version=True)
[(2, 1), (2, 0), (1, 1), (1, 0), (0, 1), (0, 0)]
sage: g.lex_BFS(reverse=False)
[(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 0), (2, 1)]
sage: g.lex_BFS(reverse=False, new_version=True)
[(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 0), (2, 1)]
```


The new version is more consistant (and also way faster). Furthermore, on this example, both reverse orderings are correct. 
However, when making the new version the default one, many tests for `is_chordal` and `is_interval` are broken.

Any help is welcome.

David.

New branch based on 9.2.beta8 with:
- corrected (hope so) version of previous trials for implementing the algorithm of Habib et al 2000. 
- several improvements of the existing code

Please test it extensively !

something wrong :(

```
File "src/sage/graphs/generic_graph.py", line 13620, in sage.graphs.generic_graph.GenericGraph.is_interval
Failed example:
    [sum(1 for g in graphs(i) if g.is_interval()) for i in range(8)]  # long time
Expected:
    [1, 1, 2, 4, 10, 27, 92, 369]
Got:
    [1, 1, 2, 4, 10, 27, 91, 374]
```


At least this graph is not recognized as interval graph (actually, not chordal) when using the new version: `Graph("ETzw")`.

Comment by mjo created at 2020-09-03 15:40:38

Is it feasible to generate a small random graph, feed it to both algorithms, and check that their outputs agree in a doctest? That would go a long way towards ensuring that the newer implementation is correct (or at least as correct as the old one).


---

Comment by dcoudert created at 2020-09-03 16:09:44

The difficulty is that we may have several valid orderings, even with same initial vertex, and that the 2 algorithms may produce different orderings
For instance:

```
sage: for i in range(100): 
....:     G = graphs.RandomChordalGraph(10) 
....:     F = G.lex_BFS(initial_vertex=0, algorithm="fast") 
....:     S = G.lex_BFS(initial_vertex=0, algorithm="slow") 
....:     print(i, "fast", F) 
....:     print(i, "slow", S) 
....:     if S != F: 
....:         print(G.graph6_string()) 
....:         break 
....:                                                                                                                               
0 fast [0, 1, 5, 9, 6, 4, 7, 2, 8, 3]
0 slow [0, 1, 5, 9, 6, 4, 7, 2, 8, 3]
1 fast [0, 1, 4, 8, 2, 7, 9, 6, 3, 5]
1 slow [0, 1, 4, 8, 2, 7, 9, 6, 3, 5]
2 fast [0, 6, 7, 9, 8, 5, 1, 3, 2, 4]
2 slow [0, 6, 7, 9, 8, 1, 3, 5, 2, 4]
IAHSCEA_w
```

In this example, the last graph is not connected, but it's the same with connected graphs.
For instance, take a star with center 0. Then any permutation of the leaves lead to a valid lex BFS ordering.

One option could be to make an indirect doctest using `is_chordal` on a random chordal graph, but for that me must be able to specify the lex BFS algorithm to use in `is_chordal`. Not sure it's the best way.

But may be there is an other way to check that a lex BFS ordering is valid ?


---

Comment by mjo created at 2020-09-03 19:16:28

Ok, I see the problem. The paper "LexBFS-orderings and powers of graphs" (doi:10.1007/3-540-62559-3_15) has a characterization of LBFS orderings in Lemma 1 that looks pretty easy to implement. What do you think about an `_is_lbfs(graph, order)` function that could be used to test the outputs of the fast/slow algorithms? Both would return `True` when fed to `_is_lbfs`, I expect.

Minor comment outside of the scope of the ticket: You might be able to do this for a bit more speed:

```diff
-        def l_func(x):
-            return code[x]
 
         # The initial_vertex is at position 0 and so named 0 in sd
         code[0].append(n + 1)
         now = 1
         while vertices:
-            v = max(vertices, key=l_func)
+            v = max(vertices, key=code.__getitem__)
```

Comment by dcoudert created at 2020-09-04 15:09:05

I have added a method to check that a lexBFS ordering is valid in (directed) graphs.
I'm not yet 100% convinced that it is enough to check this property, so if you are aware of other tests, let me know.


---

Comment by mjo created at 2020-09-04 20:28:36

We're working on getting rid of this, but for now, you have to call `set_random_seed()` at the beginning of every doctest where randomness is required (i.e. the ones you've just added). Otherwise the random number generator isn't actually random, and you'll wind up testing the same example every time the tests are run.


---

Comment by mjo created at 2020-09-04 20:30:10

Example:


```
The nonnegative orthant is a proper cone::

    sage: set_random_seed()
    sage: ambient_dim = ZZ.random_element(10)
    sage: K = cones.nonnegative_orthant(ambient_dim)
    sage: K.is_proper()
    True
```

Thank you. I didn't know that.


---

Comment by mjo created at 2020-09-06 12:56:56

I've been playing around with this, here are a few more suggestions:

1. You could use `ZZ.random_element(G.num_verts())` instead of always `0` for the initial vertex in your random tests; that would improve coverage a bit.

2. The documentation for the `cdef` method isn't appearing in the reference manual for me (does anyone know if that's expected?). Since you put a lot of work into the docs for `lex_BFS_fast_short_digraph`, maybe you want to move them into the main `lex_BFS` docstring?

3. (Unrelated to this ticket) While you're in there, please add an extra `:` to the end of `TESTS:` in `maximum_cardinality_search()`. Right now sage doesn't recognize it as a doctest.

Comment by dcoudert created at 2020-09-06 13:28:58

I have implemented your suggestions. For the algorithm, I made a copy of the description without suppressing it from the cdef method. I think it is easier this way for someone interested in this code to understand it.


---

Comment by mjo created at 2020-09-06 19:04:29

Thanks! Here are two more small things:

First, in the documentation for `lex_BFS_fast_short_digraph` (and now `lex_BFS`), there's a LaTeX typo at

```
S = `{u | i \leq \sigma(u) \leq j\}
```

The opening curly brace isn't escaped, so the formula isn't showing up.

Second, in `_is_valid_lex_BFS_order`, it looks to me like you've figured out the correct directions for the edges to make things work with a digraph, namely `ca`, `cb`, `da`, and `db`. However the docs still have some of them in a different order from when the result was stated for an undirected graph:


```
if `a < b < c` and `ac \in E` and `bc \not\in E`, then there exists `d\in V`                                                                                             
such that `c < d`, `bd \in E` and `ad \not\in E`.

This looks good to me now, unless anyone else wants to comment. I've checked the implementation of `_is_valid_lex_BFS_order`. It's "obviously correct" for undirected graphs, and probably for directed graphs too although I haven't been able to find the corresponding theorem for digraphs written down.

The implementation of `lex_BFS_fast_short_digraph` is less scrutable but looks reasonable now that I understand how the algorithm works. I trust the doctests more than I trust myself in any case. Since you've been working on this for 8 years I'm inclined to say let's get it over with.

Thank you for your help.

To understand the fast algorithm, you need to understand that a slice is nothing else than a label. When creating a subslice of a slice from position p to position q, you place the vertices of the sub slice on positions p...p+I, and the remaining vertices of the original slice at positions p+I+1...q. So the vertices in the sub slice have a larger label than the other vertices of the original slice. The tricks are to associate a position with the current slice name, to maintain the head (left most vertex of a slice) of each slice, and give a name to each  newly created subslice.

To check the property on directed graphs, its more tricky, but I'm convinced it is correct. An alternative to check the validity is to modify the slow algorith. That is, instead of selecting a vertex with largest label, we identify all candidates (vertices with same largest label), and check that the next vertex in the given order is in this pool of candidates, then select it, update labels of its neighbors and continue.
We can add that if needed in a future ticket.
