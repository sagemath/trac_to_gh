There is one thing I'd briefly like to discuss: The representation strings introduced and modified here start with `X-Monoid ...`, where `X` is the name of the corresponding element class. If we are unifying all of these, I think that the same should hold for `OTermMonoid._repr_`, which should produce a string starting with `OTerm-Monoid`, instead of the current `O-Term Monoid`.

Other than that, these changes LGTM.

I am against this change. I think there are two ways to write the monoids, either `X-Monoid` where `X` is a class name or a more verbose name if possible, which is the case for `O-Term Monoid` (and also for `B-Term Monoid` on #31933.

We could, if we like, however unify the dashs by writing `GenericTerm Monoid` etc (without dash), but I do not have a strong preference for doing this.
