This ticket is the part of a series of tickets that I have opened this summer in an effort to improve the functionality for complex dynamics in Sage. I have enhanced the mandelbrot_plot() function to support general polynomial functions. The map `z^2 + c` is still hardcoded so the function will not lose any speed for the `z^2 + c` case.

```

In addition to the docbuild error here are a couple more:

- You should have a doctest that utilizes the symbolic critical point code

There is some trouble with the initial parsing. When you say P.base() do you P.base_ring()? Will you allow function fields or rational functions in the parameter? Whatever you decide it needs to be documented in mandelbrot_plot().

- `f = z^2 +1/c` - weird error

- the following does not work and I think it should.

```
R.<c> = CC[]
S.<z> = R[]
f = z^2 +c
mandelbrot_plot(f)
```


- raise ValueError needs an error message

- The following has a uninformative error


```
R.<z,x,c> = CC[]
f = z^2 + c
```

The following example


```
B.<z> = CC[]
R.<c> = B[]
f = z^4 - z + c
polynomial_mandelbrot(f, pixel_count=100)
```


prints a blank square and thus should be switched to:


```
B.<c> = CC[]
R.<z> = B[]
f = z^4 - z + c
polynomial_mandelbrot(f, pixel_count=100)
```
