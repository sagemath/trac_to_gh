The bug can be reproduced by running the following code:

	PolynomialRing(SR, names="x")("x^2").roots()

Expected result: [(0, 2)]
Actual result: [0, 2]

I tested this on 9.2.beta12, which is what the "develop" branch points to at the time of writing.

I have written a patch that fixes this;  let's see if I can manage to attach it / push it to this ticket.  I'm also not 100% sure that "algebra" is the right value for the "Component:" field.

You managed!

I use "commutative algebra" for tickets about polynomials and friends.

Please add your full name in the "Authors" field on the ticket.

Please add the example from the ticket description as a doctest,
with the ticket number, as part of the EXAMPLES block in the
docstring for the `roots` method. Something like:


```diff
+        Check that :trac:`30522` is fixed::
+
+            sage: PolynomialRing(SR, names="x")("x^2").roots()
+            [(0, 2)]
+
```


When the ticket is ready for review, please set it to `needs_review`.
