You should
-  specify the input format to `Graph` to reduce the overhead of building the graph before returning the result.

```diff
-                return EdgesView(Graph([(u, v, L[frozenset((u, v))]) for u, v in d]))
+                return EdgesView(Graph([(u, v, L[frozenset((u, v))]) for u, v in d], format='list_of_edges'))
```

- update the documentation to clarify that the output is now a `EdgesView`
- modify a doctest to show that the result is of type `EdgesView`, for instance like

```diff
-            sage: sorted(g.matching(use_edge_labels=True))
-            [(0, 3, 3), (1, 2, 6)]
+            sage: m = g.matching(use_edge_labels=True)
+            sage: type(m)
+            <class 'sage.graphs.views.EdgesView'>
+            sage: sorted(m)
+            [(0, 3, 3), (1, 2, 6)]
```
