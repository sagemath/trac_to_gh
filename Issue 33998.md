It seems a bug:

```
sage: bool(AA(sqrt(2))/pi == sqrt(2)/pi)
TypeError: ECL says: THROW: The catch MACSYMA-QUIT is undefined.
```

The following comparison is fine, though.

```
sage: bool(AA(sqrt(2)) == sqrt(2))
True
```

Instead of defining `_maxima_init_`, perhaps it's better to define `_symbolic_`
