This is my first addition to `matrix/*` -files, so I hope that a reviewer will be carefull. I tried to copy the skeleton from another function.

Johan, can you check this one? Trivial code, but I am not sure if this is in the right place etc.

Thanks! Now when I know that this is the right way I may add, say, Hilbert matrix when mentioned by some of our researchers.
