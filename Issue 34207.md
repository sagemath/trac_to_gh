Singular can compute the groebner cover of an ideal of a polynomial ring with coefficients. This implements an interface to that functionality.

No, I didn't. Sorry

I don't really understand the docstring of `_groebner_cover()`. It might be a little too concise and could benefit from some explicit names.

Also, you are inconsistent with your capitalization; you can use `GrÃ¶bner` there and in `groebner_cover()`. We generally follow "formal" writing rules and avoid contractions `don't` -> `do not`.


```diff
             sage: I = R.ideal([-x+3*y+z-5,2*x+a*z+4,4*x-3*z-a-1])
             sage: I._groebner_cover()
             [[[z, y, x],
-            [(2*a + 3)*z + (a + 9), (12*a + 18)*y + (-a^2 - 23*a - 36), (4*a + 6)*x + (-a^2 - a + 12)],
-            [[[0], [[(2*a + 3)]]]]],
-            [[1], [1], [[[(2*a + 3)], [[1]]]]]]
-
+             [(2*a + 3)*z + (a + 9), (12*a + 18)*y + (-a^2 - 23*a - 36), (4*a + 6)*x + (-a^2 - a + 12)],
+             [[[0], [[(2*a + 3)]]]]],
+             [[1], [1], [[[(2*a + 3)], [[1]]]]]]
         """
         from sage.rings.fraction_field import FractionField_generic
         F = self.base_ring()
-        if not isinstance(F, FractionField_generic):
-            raise TypeError("The base ring must be a field with parameters")
         from sage.rings.polynomial.multi_polynomial_ring_base import is_MPolynomialRing
         from sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_ring import is_PolynomialRing
-        if not is_MPolynomialRing(F.ring()) and not is_PolynomialRing (F.ring()):
-            raise TypeError("The base ring must be a field with parameters")
+        if (not isinstance(F, FractionField_generic) or
+            not is_MPolynomialRing(F.ring()) and not is_PolynomialRing (F.ring())):
+            raise TypeError("the base ring must be a field with parameters")
```

(note also the capitalization as we follow Python's error message conventions).


```diff
              and Y is defined by:
                1: [1]}
-
-
         """
-        gc= self._groebner_cover()
+        gc = self._groebner_cover()
```

I would also store `F.ring()` in a variable in `groebner_cover()`.

typo "parmeters"

and "Each component is has two lists of equations."
