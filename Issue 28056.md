# Issue 28056: field_of_definition_critical() fails on homogenized affine dynamical systems.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28293

If a projective dynamical system `F` is created by homogenizing an affine dynamical system, then calling `F.field_of_definition_critical()` returns a type error.

The below example returns an error.

```
K.<x> = FractionField(PolynomialRing(QQ,'x'))
F = DynamicalSystem_affine((x^2 + 1)/(x^2 - 1))
FF = F.homogenize(1)
FF.field_of_definition_critical()
```


But constructing the same map as a projective dynamical system directly gives no error.

```
P.<x,y> = ProjectiveSpace(QQ,1)
FF = DynamicalSystem_projective([x^2 + y^2, x^2 - y^2])
FF.field_of_definition_critical()
```

Moving tickets to milestone sage-9.2 based on a review of last modification date, branch status, and severity.

Moving to 9.4, as 9.3 has been released.

Fixed in #31896, should be marked as closed.
