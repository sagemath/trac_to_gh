This is an extract from a private mail from Nicolas Thi√©ry:

```
 - trac_8742-lazy_format-fh.patch
   trac_8742-lazy_format-review-nt.patch

   Si mon patch de review est ok et les tests passent, c'est tout bon!
```

Translation: If my review patch is ok and if the tests pass, this is all good.

I'm ok with Nicolas review patch. I Put a positive review.
