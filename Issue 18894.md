I think this is an inconsistency between the system `python` and Sage's `python`. Does `./sage -i gdb` solve your problem?

It does, thanks! (I really hate how sage always needs its own version of everything...)

I'd say no: even if there is a workaround, it is an issue with sage...

Changing priority from major to minor.

I'd say it just needs to be documented properly. Indeed, gdb is intimately connected to gcc, and supplying gcc, but no gdb, won't fly...
