# Issue 25992: binomial wrongly converts polynomials to symbolic expressions

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/26229

Original creator: vdelecroix

Original creation time: 2018-09-09 17:39:35

CC:  rws

Keywords: symbolics

We have

```
sage: x = polygen(QQ)
sage: parent(binomial(x, 2))
Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Rational Field
```

But

```
sage: x = polygen(ZZ)
sage: parent(binomial(x, 2))
Symbolic Ring
```

Note that the global `binomial` function is to blame as

```
sage: type(sage.arith.misc.binomial(x,2))
Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Rational Field
```

For reference: initially reported by John Cremona in a [2018-08 sage-devel discussion](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-support/-aYWUEVfS4U/discussion).

Well, the problem is that anyway the polynomial is first converted to SR, then one makes the binomial, then one converts back to the original ring. **EURK**.

The last step fails for ZZ[x], because the result is usually not in ZZ[x] but in QQ[x] !
