CC:  jpflori was kcrisman robertwb

Noticed in Sage 4.8:

```

sage: a=-17
sage: %timeit s = sign(a)  
125 loops, best of 3: 757 µs per loop
sage: %timeit s = a//abs(a) 
625 loops, best of 3: 246 ns per loop
```

thus computing `sign(a)` with `a//abs(a)` is 3000 faster!!!

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/12615

The fall-through into constructing a ComplexIntervalField is expensive.  Maybe it makes sense to give the obvious suspects (ZZ, QQ, RR, etc.) a .sign() method.

Hmmm.  Well, it helps, but you still lose a lot going from something(sign) to sign(something):


```
# unpatched
sage: %timeit s = sign(2)
5 loops, best of 3: 427 µs per loop
```



```
# with .sign() using mpz_sgn
sage: %timeit s = sign(2)
625 loops, best of 3: 47.4 µs per loop
sage: %timeit s = 2.sign()
625 loops, best of 3: 352 ns per loop

```


Function calls are slow. :-/

Robert, thanks, I see a speedup of a factor of more than 10 on my example:

```
sage: a=-17
sage: %timeit s = sign(a)  
625 loops, best of 3: 41 µs per loop
sage: %timeit s = a//abs(a) 
625 loops, best of 3: 257 ns per loop
```


However I wonder about the need of the "pool" cache for integers in [-5,100], since the speedup is "only" about 20%:

```
sage: a=100                 
sage: %timeit s = sign(a)   
625 loops, best of 3: 34.7 µs per loop
sage: a=101                 
sage: %timeit s = sign(a)   
625 loops, best of 3: 41.5 µs per loop
```
