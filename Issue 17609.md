One drawback is that GAP hangs forever on infinite group (instead of saying that it does not know how to do).

Hmmmmm... If it always hangs on infinite groups, what about raising an exception in that case instead of waiting forever ?

Done. But I do not know if it hans for *all* infinite groups. You can decide conjugacy in many groups (e.g. SL(2,Z) and its finite index subgroups, free groups and its finite index subgroups).

Would you say that it is a good idea to raise that exception, then ?

No. I did not find *any* example in GAP for which it works. It is safer to raise this exception.

Well, then let it go (all long tests pass).
