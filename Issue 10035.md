The long doctests pass for me with 4.6.alpha2 + SageNB 0.8.3 on sage.math.

My current local setup is limited, so I don't know about the Selenium tests.  As far as I'm aware, we still need to update the SageNB Se tests for the latest released version of Selenium RC.

It would be really great if #9920 were slipped into this as well.

What do we need to do to review this?  We already reviewed the individual patches.

I think you can just check that I didn't make a mistake in applying the right tickets, install the package, run the doctests.

Could someone please review the package?

There's an error building Sage from scratch.  See #9920 for the problem.

Fixed in 0.8.6, which needs a [formal] review for 4.6.alpha3.

I'm a little confused at what to do to test this.  I've updated the description.  Did I get everything?

In #10094 I'm switching on c++ support in cython-0.13, this changes (actually, fixes) one `sage.misc.sageinspect.py` doctest. The analogous change needs to be made to `sagenb.misc.sageinspect.py` when/if that patch is accepted. Its simple:

Okay, I followed the steps in the description (using 4.6.alpha2), on a production server running behind an apache proxy.  ptestlong passed all tests, and I was successfully able to log in, run worksheets, create accounts, etc.  So positive review.

This change has already been made in one of the patches merged into 0.8.6, so nothing needs to be done.

I'm merging #10097's 0.8.7 package, which supersedes 0.8.6.
