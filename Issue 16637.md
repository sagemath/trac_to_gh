I tried that in sage-on-gentoo last week and I think there are a couple of doctests affected, I need to check which ones since I also updated glpk at the same time and it also caused some jitters.

You just refreshed the setup.py patch didn't you? Nothing was really added to it?

I thought there were failures associated with cvxopt but they are all glpk so it is fine by me. +ing the bot will tell us if something is amiss.

Next time please use a wget-able url with the right name.

I thought those were wget-able and where giving you a file with the right name or is it the right name only from a browser?

"1.1.7.tar.gz" is not the right name for the cvxopt tarball...

Not contesting, but you get a different behavior with this url depending that you use wget or a browser. Chrome just saved it as cvxopt-1.1.7.tar.gz. Which suggests that there was some redirection before the download proper.
