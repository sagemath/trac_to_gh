Some creative grepping. I got my hands on a 160 core machine so I could run doctests quickly many timesâ€¦see #26118. Note that some of these turned out not to actually make a difference. Either because the computation that took a long time is cached and now it shows up somewhere else or because the runtime apparently only is bad when you run lots of doctests in parallel.

I'll revert some of the changes accordingly.
