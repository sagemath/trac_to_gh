Uploading all remaining `sage.modules` fixes from my Python 3 branch.

This is a bit diverse but I think it's a small enough set of fixes to be grouped together.  Also fixes some Python 2 bugs that were sort of left as "known failures".

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/26276

Two things from a very quick lookover:

The `iter` here seems pointless as the result is an iterator:

```
return iter(self._entries.iteritems())
```


In Cython, you can still use `iteritems` on a `dict` in Python3 (from what Jeroen as said in the past). So this change should not be needed:

```diff
                 e = entries_dict
                 entries_dict = {}
                 try:
-                    for k, x in e.iteritems():
+                    for k, x in e.items():
                         x = coefficient_ring(x)
                         if x:
                             entries_dict[k] = x
```

(unless `e` needs a typecast to `dict`).

I guess on Python3, Cython just considers `iteritems` as a replacement for `items` and gives the view.

Now feel free to call me paranoid, but I am a little worried about the extra indirection by defining the `_on_basis` method. Since that forms the key part of the code and can be called very frequently, it could have some significant impact:

```
sage: from sage.modules.with_basis.morphism import ModuleMorphismFromMatrix
....: X = CombinatorialFreeModule(ZZ, [1,2]); X.rename("X"); x = X.basis()
....: Y = CombinatorialFreeModule(ZZ, [3,4]); Y.rename("Y"); y = Y.basis()
....: m = matrix([[1, 2], [3, 5]])
....: phi = ModuleMorphismFromMatrix(matrix=m, domain=X, codomain=Y, side="right")
....: 
sage: %timeit phi(X.an_element())
The slowest run took 36.14 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
100000 loops, best of 3: 3.91 µs per loop
```

vs your branch

```
sage: %timeit phi(X.an_element())
The slowest run took 25.64 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
100000 loops, best of 3: 4.32 µs per loop
```

which is around a 10% slowdown. So I am not sure this is the best way forward as the pickling problem might be better addressed with a custom `__reduce__` method. How much of those changes are necessary for Python3?

Yes, I think it should. These get used all over the place in things like the combinatorial Hopf algebra code.

That's fair, though I probably might have instead explicitly made a lambda that wraps the dict in a closure and calls its getitem.  But maybe that's a distinction without a difference (and that would still have a problem with pickling).

One last little thing:

```diff

+                    for k, x in e.items():
```

Since `e` is a `dict` in a Cython file, I think it would be better to do

```diff
-                    for k, x in e.iteritems():
+                    for k, x in (<dict> e).iteritems():
```

Once changed (or if you don't think it is a good idea), then you can set a positive review.
