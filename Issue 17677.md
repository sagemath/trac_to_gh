I have a new tarball and am currently testing the Sage library patch (small changes to API required this).

Thanks.  I just made a proper link to the new upstream tarball, otherwise no more changes.

Well it had to happen one day!  Julien pointed out that I should change version numbers when that API changes (at least) so I did.  Better late than never!

I am just finishing renaming all my old gentoo ebuilds from YYYYMMDD to 0_pYYYYMMDD so 1.0.0 is a greater version. In theory I support sage back to 5.9 - although I don't know if it will actually work properly :)

You know John, you can still number the package versions by dates -- the soname version is independant! Do as is most convenient.

I did not really intend to change the package release version from the date format, but something I did on github created this 1.0.0.  Please don't assume that I have switched systems....

Ah, I did assume you changed the versioning scheme...  and had started preparing a 1.0.0 release for debian :-P

It's a good occasion to learn how to revert a series of commits in a git tree.

Well it's too late for me, I am all done and dusted https://github.com/cschwan/sage-on-gentoo/tree/master/sci-mathematics/eclib I guess I can revert back later (some people will hate me for causing even more rebuild).

I am too busy this week to make more changes, I did not push anything to github since the commit 1006c91 which is the last commit there so as far as I can see there are no commits to be reverted or changed at all, and the version number 1.0.0 thing is just something on github.
