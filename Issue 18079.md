Keywords: default parameters definition -fpermissive g++

GCC 5.1 (i.e., `g++`) again got stricter with respect to C++ conformance, and hence another piece of the changes necessary to let Lcalc build with Clang (cf. #12437) is needed for `g++` as well, namely forbidden default parameters in function *definitions* ("Part II").

This also affects the Sage library, i.e., extension modules using Lcalc's headers won't build either (but fixing the Lcalc package also fixes that).  Note that distutils ignore `CXXFLAGS`, so `-fpermissive` has to be passed **in `CFLAGS`** (for these modules) until Lcalc gets fixed.

The patch is trivial though.

I think the patchlevel of the `lcalc` package needs to be increased (in case somebody upgrades GCC, you really want `lcalc` to be rebuilt).

Amen.  (`$OTHERS` don't care much with the *new workflow<sup>TM</sup>*.)

Not me, but probably `$SOMEBODY`.
