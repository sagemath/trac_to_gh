Keywords: multiplicative order, complex interval field

ComplexIntervalField elements do not have multiplicative order implemented whereas their counterpart ComplexField elements (ComplexNumber) does.

Also uncomment the `_set_multiplicative_order()` in `ComplexIntervalField.zeta()` once done (I commented this out in #13618 to make the function work which is the dependency).

Wouldn't it be better to compare against `self._parent.one()` and its negative so a coercion is not invoked? Also, don't we want to first check `if self._multiplicative_order is not None:` first and set `_multiplicative_order` in those cases we have computed it when calling `multiplicative_order()` and in `zeta()`?

So if I understand correctly, you implemented `multiplicative_order()` but not (as suggested by the ticket description) `_set_multiplicative_order`). Is that intentional?
