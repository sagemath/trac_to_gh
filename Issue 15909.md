Previously, initial states were not taken into account.

As the output is in tikz, the parameter choosing the direction of the arrow indicating the initial state follows tikz' notations. Thus, `initial_where` can be set to one of
`"below"`, `"above"`, `"left"`, `"right"`.

Very minor change.

I made another commit to make all print-statements comaptible with Python 3. Please review those and if they are fine, feel free to set this ticket to positive_review

In its current form, this will create a merge conflict with #16200. Pending resolution, I set the status back to needs_work.

I discard the last commit [â€‹ef79bba](http://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/commit/?id=ef79bba711b33471c4cfea3b0f518b511bf1f70e) `python3: "print ..." to print(...)` because the corresponding discussion #15989 does not seem to be closed yet.
