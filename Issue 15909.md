Keywords: finite_state_machine

Previously, initial states were not taken into account.

As the output is in tikz, the parameter choosing the direction of the arrow indicating the initial state follows tikz' notations. Thus, `initial_where` can be set to one of
`"below"`, `"above"`, `"left"`, `"right"`.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/16146
