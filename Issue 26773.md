# Issue 26773: py3: avoid .vertices() in methods _ford_fulkerson, edge_cut, bounded_outdegree_orientation and gomory_hu_tree

Keywords: py3, graph

We fix all doctests errors in py3 of methods `bounded_outdegree_orientation` and `gomory_hu_tree` of `graph.py` by avoiding calls to `.vertices()` in these methods and in methods `edge_cut` and `_ford_fulkerson` of `generic_graph.py`. This also fixes some doctests in `generic_graph.py`.
