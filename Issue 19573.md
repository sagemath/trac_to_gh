Do we have figures on what kind of optimization gain is obtained by these changes? Or are we just getting the benefit of having more streamlined and hence more maintainable code?

I noticed this one:

```
-        new = lambda x: not has_key(get_key(*x[0],**x[1]))
+        new = lambda x: not has_key(self.get_key(*x[0],**x[1]))
         arglist = filter(new, map(normalize_input, arglist))
```
Writing that as a list comprehension should avoid an extra (expensive) python call, so should be a little faster.

On first sight, not very much compared to the overhead of cached functions (less than I hoped).

That's an additional advantage. Cached functions need a big cleanup, and this ticket is part of that (I already did #19695 and #19768 earlier).
