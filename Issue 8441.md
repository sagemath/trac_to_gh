Keywords: heights, Coleman integration, hyperelliptic curves

Currently, a work in progress (lots of doctests need to be written and internal print statements removed; the code itself will be cleaned up over the next few weeks), but the main function, which computes the Coleman-Gross local height pairing at p for hyperelliptic curves, does the following:

(This example is computing h_7(D_1, D_2) and h_7(D_2, D_1), for D_1 = (P) - (Q) and D_2 = (Pprime)-(Qprime), in the notation of R. Coleman and B. Gross, p-adic heights on curves, Algebraic Number Theory, 1989, pp-73-81.)

        sage: H = HyperellipticCurve(x*(x-1)*(x+9))                                                       
        sage: K = Qp(7,10)                                                                                
        sage: HK = H.change_ring(K)

        sage: HK.height([(1,P),(-1,Q)],[(1,Pprime),(-1,Qprime)],10)                                       
        2*7^2 + 5*7^3 + 7^4 + 7^5 + 2*7^6 + 3*7^7 + 7^8 + 3*7^9 + O(7^10)

a first attempt at collecting all of the local heights code

here is a tentative of rebasing on 5.12.beta3

* the part in ``hyperelliptic_generic`` is rather clean and could even go in a separate ticket

* the part in ``hyperelliptic_padic_field`` needs a lot of work and care

So is there any mathematical obstruction to giving this a positive review? (I haven't checked all the doctest formatting, so maybe that is still an issue.)

To answer my own question: it looks like there are still some missing doctests on intermediate functions, and some comments in the code that suggest points that still need to be addressed (but I didn't look more closely at the code to evaluate the suggestions).

Would it make to separate out the part of this code which is actually done into a ticket that can be reviewed and merged right away (and make that a dependency for this ticket)?

One could easily split to another ticket the simple (but not so interesting) changes in the file `hyperelliptic_generic`.
