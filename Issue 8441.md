Keywords: heights, Coleman integration, hyperelliptic curves

Currently, a work in progress (lots of doctests need to be written and internal print statements removed; the code itself will be cleaned up over the next few weeks), but the main function, which computes the Coleman-Gross local height pairing at p for hyperelliptic curves, does the following:

(This example is computing h_7(D_1, D_2) and h_7(D_2, D_1), for D_1 = (P) - (Q) and D_2 = (Pprime)-(Qprime), in the notation of R. Coleman and B. Gross, p-adic heights on curves, Algebraic Number Theory, 1989, pp-73-81.)

To answer my own question: it looks like there are still some missing doctests on intermediate functions, and some comments in the code that suggest points that still need to be addressed (but I didn't look more closely at the code to evaluate the suggestions).

Would it make to separate out the part of this code which is actually done into a ticket that can be reviewed and merged right away (and make that a dependency for this ticket)?
