Gentoo looks OK. Are you sure you don't need libm4ri-devel and gd-devel in some places? For example, I convinced myself that packages with those names exist on openSUSE: https://download.opensuse.org/tumbleweed/repo/oss/x86_64/

Thanks for checking. 
The lists in this ticket are certainly incomplete. Any contributions are welcome

Gentoo doesn't do "dev/devel" packages - occasionally doc may be a separate package in some circumstances. Sorry, I am flat out this month and won't be able to do any proper testing before March.
