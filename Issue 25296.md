One change:

```diff
diff --git a/src/sage/combinat/tiling.py b/src/sage/combinat/tiling.py
index c18bcb9..d765ded 100644
--- a/src/sage/combinat/tiling.py
+++ b/src/sage/combinat/tiling.py
`@``@` -1081,7 +1081,7 `@``@` class Polyomino(SageObject):
 
             sage: from sage.combinat.tiling import Polyomino
             sage: p = Polyomino([(0,0,0),(0,0,1)])
-            sage: list(sorted(edge) for edge in p.neighbor_edges())
+            sage: [sorted(edge) for edge in p.neighbor_edges()]
             [This is the Trac macro ** that was inherited from the migration called with arguments (0, 0, 0), )](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#-macro)
 
         In 3d::
```

It is missing the list comprehension (generating a syntax error); see the patchbot. Once fixed, you can set a positive review on my behalf.
