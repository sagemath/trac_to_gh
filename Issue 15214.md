# Issue 15214: symbolic.limit wrongly gives ZeroDivisionError

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: dkrenn

Original creation time: 2013-11-25 15:17:10

CC:  kcrisman

Keywords: symbolic, limit, wrong, zero division

We have

```
sage: (4-x^2)/(3-sqrt(x^2+5)).limit(x=2)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ZeroDivisionError: Symbolic division by zero
```

but

```
sage: limit((4-x^2)/(3-sqrt(x^2+5)), x=2)
6
```

Those two should give the same result (at least the docstring of `x.limit` says `See "sage.calculus.calculus.limit"`, so it has the appearence that the same functions are called).

Still there in 6.6.

I don't understand the issue. In case of 

```
sage: (4-x^2)/(3-sqrt(x^2+5)).limit(x=2)
```

`4-x^2` gets divided by ` (3-sqrt(x^2+5)).limit(x=2)` which is 0, so the ZeroDivisionError. But this works

```
sage: ((4-x^2)/(3-sqrt(x^2+5))).limit(x=2)
6
```

Well, it's similar to `(sin(x)/x).limit(x=0)`, isn't it?

The expression of which limit is evaluated in this case is ` (3-sqrt(x^2+5))` at x=2 and not the whole expression ` (4-x<sup>2)/(3-sqrt(x</sup>2+5))` as for the second case ` limit((4-x<sup>2)/(3-sqrt(x</sup>2+5)), x=2)` limit is evaluated for whole expression. proper parenthesis would give correct answer.

So you agree it's user error?

I agree as well that it is a user error (sorry, I didn't see this (the wrong parentheses) when opening the ticket).

Actually, there are no authors if there is no patch, but definitely this is a contribution so I put it in reviewers.
