I am a little hesitant to use ``@`cached_method` for `gen_embedding` because the embedding could, in principle, originally not be defined and then added. In this case, I think it would be best to implement a custom cache:

```python
if self._gen_emb is not None:
    return self._gen_emb
embedding = self.coerce_embedding()
if embedding is None:
    return None
else:
    self._gen_emb = embedding(self.gen())
    return self._gen_emb
```

Do you mean by misusing `register_embedding()` (which is not supposed to be be called after the parent has been “used”), or is there another mechanism I'm unaware of?

Now you have it double cached. `;)` The more I think about it, the more I am convinced that your original way with a ``@`cached_method` was best since my situation is a very special (and somewhat pathological) corner case that we can warn users about and it is the most simple in terms of code.

I don't have time to investigate what happens right now, but it looks like ``@`cached_method` may be doing some magic that makes what you suggested even without a custom cache:

```
sage: K = NumberField(x^2+7, 'a')
sage: K.gen_embedding()
sage: K.register_embedding(K.embeddings(CC)[0])
sage: K.gen_embedding()

}
```

So I can confirm this in an isolated context:

```
sage: class Foo(object):
....:     def __init__(self):
....:         self.x = None
....:     @cached_method
....:     def bar(self):
....:         if self.x is None:
....:             return None
....:         return 5
....:     
sage: f = Foo()
sage: f.bar()
sage: f.x = -2
sage: f.bar()
5
```


```
sage: class Foo(object):
....:     def __init__(self):
....:         self.x = None
....:     @cached_method
....:     def bar(self):
....:         if self.x is None:
....:             return -1
....:         return 5
....:     
sage: f = Foo()
sage: f.bar()
-1
sage: f.x = 0
sage: f.bar()
-1
```

However, the same does *not* hold for ``@`cached_function`

```
sage: x = None
sage: @cached_function
....: def foo():
....:     if x is None:
....:         return None
....:     return 5
....: 
sage: foo()
sage: x = 2
sage: foo()
```

However, I would say this is a bug with ``@`cached_method` because sometimes having a result of `None` is important and a result of a long computation. This is now #29037. So I would be inclined to leave a warning of the effect `This method is cached, so be sure to define the embedding before using it.`
