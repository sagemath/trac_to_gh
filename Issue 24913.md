CC:  @kiwifb @jdemeyer @vbraun

As discussed on #25056, that ticket introduced a small, but annoying runtime dependency on a file that lives in `$SAGE_ROOT`, `VERSION.txt`, which creates problems for downstream distributions.

This proposes to eliminate practically all dependence on `VERSION.txt`, by instead writing the same string to a new variable `SAGE_VERSION_FULL` which is stored in both `src/bin/sage-version.sh` and `src/sage/version.py`.  Although mildly redundant, this is at least consistent.

Originally I thought to just outright remove `VERSION.txt` since at this point it is not used directly anywhere in sagelib or sage-the-distribution. However, there are probably various external utilities that look for that file--I can confirm that the patchbot is one such utility, if nothing else.  But there are likely others.  So it's harmless to keep it.

The only "mention of `SAGE_ROOT`" is as an alternative "$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/sage-version.sh" if it does not exist.

I agree that's not a great place for that file, but it's where it already existed.  I don't know what you do with it on gentoo (though having it there isn't the worst place for it).  I think I would rather do away with `sage-version.sh` and instead put that info in `sage-env-config`, but I was trying to keep this change as undisruptive as possible.

+1 to all of the above in principle.  However, you'll see in this branch that it actually eliminates several uses of `$SAGE_ROOT`, and leaves only one in the `sage` script, and only as a fallback if `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/sage-version.sh` does not exist yet.  I agree that's still not ideal, but also somewhat necessary since currently the `sage` script serves as an entrypoint to runtime capabilities of Sage, and to the "build system" (a fact I've complained about in #25130).

The goal there was that at the very least, running `./sage --version` should work the same whether in a fresh clone of the repository (though that's actually already broken at the moment for unrelated reasons), or running some binary release with no `$SAGE_ROOT`.

```

        sage_version

fi

if [ "$1" = '-v' -o "$1" = '-version' -o "$1" = '--version' ]; then
        sage_version -v
        exit 0
fi

if [ "$1" = '-root'  -o "$1" = '--root' ]; then
    echo "$SAGE_ROOT"
    exit 0
fi

if [ $# -gt 0 ]; then
  if [ "$1" = '-h' -o "$1" = '-?' -o "$1" = '-help' -o "$1" = '--help' ]; then
     usage

which I felt should work even from a clean source checkout.  Previously these flags did not work in that case because sourcing sage-env would not work correctly.  In other words, from a clean source checkout you can now do:
