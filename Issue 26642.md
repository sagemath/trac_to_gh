# Issue 26642: Deprecate _element_constructor_ which is unbound method

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/26879

The `_element_constructor` machinery in `Parent` has support both for `P._element_constructor_` being a bound and an unbound method. However, after #26878, the only case that occurs is bound methods. So we deprecate support for unbound methods.
