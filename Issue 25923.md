I am seeing this in the occasional log file, here `fpylll-0.4.1dev.log`:

```
Error processing line 1 of /Users/jpalmier/Desktop/Sage/sage_builds/PYTHON3/sage-8.4.beta2/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/matplotlib-2.2.2-py3.6-nspkg.pth:

  Traceback (most recent call last):

    File "<frozen importlib._bootstrap>", line 568, in module_from_spec
  AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'loader'

```

The installation stops after that, reporting success.

I'm guessing that the `matplotlib` installation is writing the `.pth` file while the `fpylll` installation is trying to read it. I've only seen this with a Python 3 build, so it may be Python 3 specific.

Are you sure that the race condition is related to the `.pth` file? I would guess that this is really #18438 which just happened to hit while processing a `.pth` file.

Or maybe it's #26018...

It's not #18438: the affected packages have `$(PYTHON)` as a dependency, so their installations shouldn't even start until Python 2 and 3 are built. (Also, the time stamps on the log files are wrong.) I don't know how to tell if it's #26018, but I consistently get an error like

```
Error processing line 1 of /Users/palmieri/Desktop/Sage_stuff/sage_builds/PYTHON3/sage-8.4.beta0/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/matplotlib-2.1.0-py3.6-nspkg.pth:
```

(Sometimes it's been the matplotlib `.pth` file, sometimes zope.interface. Maybe there have been others, too.) In all cases, the timestamps show that the two log files (the one with the error and the one with the referenced `.pth` file) were last modified at times very close to each other.

I have rebuilt Sage several times on several machines, all OS X in case that matters, and I have seen this only when first doing `./configure --with-python=3`, and I see it consistently in that case. So either it's a coincidence and I just haven't seen it with a Python 2 build, or it's #26018 in a different guise, or it's something new. Any suggestions on how to diagnose it?

I see this consistently with Python 3 builds and not otherwise, so I am changing the title. I'm curious if it is an issue only with OS X and Python 3, or with Python 3 on any platform.

Changing keywords from "" to "python3".

One way to see this problem: `./configure --with-python=3` followed by `make`. Note that `make build` will succeed but `make` will fail because building the docs fails. That failure triggers an examination of the log files, and on OS X it displays a report of these apparent "failures" when installing a few packages.

I'm still pretty sure this is some version of #26018.  Have you tried applying my fix from that ticket (which has been needing review for some time anyways...)?

Though actually I think #26018 wouldn't solve this after all.  I think you might be right that it's a different race condition related to writing `.pth` files.  In #26018 we talked about maybe putting a lock around writing anything to a Python site-packages while simultaneously building other packages.  I found a different workaround that did not require that, but I don't think my workaround in #26018 will solve this.

The problem with `.pth` files is that they are automatically loaded when starting up the Python interpreter.  So I could see that if a package that uses Sage's Python to install (such as fpylll) starts up the interpreter while some other package is in the middle of writing a `.pth` file this could blow up in a weird way.

So it's still more or less the same _issue_ as #26018, but my solution there probably won't solve this case.

I can confirm: the branch as #26018 did not help (I mean, after I corrected the dependencies on `pip` on that branch so it would actually build).

Is this problem still present?

Changing status from new to needs_info.

I haven't seen it any time in recent memory, so I guess not. Let's close it.

Sounds good.
