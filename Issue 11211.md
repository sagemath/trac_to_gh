Assignee: jason, was

CC:  @kcrisman

Keywords: beginner

I would like this to be True:


```
sage: Color('red') == Color('red')
False
```


and these as well:


```
sage: Color((1,0,0)) == Color('red')  
False                                 
sage: Color((1,0,0)) == Color((1,0,0))
False                                 
```

Good question. I was thinking the second (more picky).

As suggested, I added a new `__hash__` method (including doctests) that uses `__rgb` just like `__eq__` and did some minor code improvements in the original patch. Note that this is a rather "picky" approach, e.g. 


```
sage: Color((0.99999,0.0,0.0)) == Color((1,0,0))
False
```


All tests pass (in Sage 5.0.beta11 under Mac OS X 10.5.8/Intel), so I think this works fine. 

By the way (`@`kini), the issue with green is that


```
sage: Color('green').rgb()
(0.0, 0.5019607843137255, 0.0)
```


so this is bound not be equal to `Color((0,1,0))`. `Color('lime')` is RGB green.

Now I notice that the `__eq__` function returns an error when comparing a `Color` with something that isn't a `Color`. I don't think that is the intended behaviour.

I'm a little confused about a few things.
* How many authors do we have, how many reviewers?  I'm not going to try to diff out each of the patches here; can each contributor put their name where it belongs (maybe both spots sometimes)?  For instance, it seems like aapitzsch acted more in a reviewer role on itaibn's patch.
* `sage: Color(0.2,0.3,0.2) == False ` seems like an odd doctest, but maybe it's just to check 'garbage' input?  `sage: Color(0.2,0.3,0.2) == 0.2` or `sage: Color(0.2,0.3,0.2) == x^2+1` test the same thing, but make it more obvious that the test isn't a typo and is covering a branch of the code, like the `23` comparison in `ne`.
* This is just my preference, but in view of comment:7 it would be nice to have 

```
sage: Color((1,0,0)) == Color((1.0,0,0))
True
```

   although of course the hash issue is taken care of and tested.

Anyway, none of this is really important enough to hold it up unless one of the many contributors to the ticket has an idea about them!

Any other things that could be come up here?  This is needed for the eminently more practical #12904 so it would be nice to get positive review.

sage: Color('red') > Color('yellow')

I figure they should all be False? or an error?  But actually we now get

```
sage: Color('red') > Color('red')

Hmm... I feel like this is needs work, though this is the previous behavior.  But if we're going to fix this, it should really be fixed.  What do you all think?
