Do I understand this ticket correctly that it is basically refactoring out methods into base classes?

Why isn't, e.g., `_numpy_dtypeint` set for `Matrix_double_dense`? I would think this would cause problems when using this class with numpy.

Ah, I see. Thank you. This is essentially a positive review. One little change I saw when reading it over (a while-we-are-at-it):

In `matrix_numpy_dense` `is_symmetric()`:

```diff
-        The tolerance inequality is strict:
+        The tolerance inequality is strict::
+
             sage: m.is_symmetric(tol=0.1)
             False
             sage: m.is_symmetric(tol=0.11)
             True
```
Once done, you can set a positive review on my behalf.
