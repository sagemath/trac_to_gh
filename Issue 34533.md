CC:  @nbruin @mkoeppe @kwankyu

implement coersion from libgap's finite fields, to fix e.g.

```
sage: F=GF(25)
sage: F(libgap.Z(25)^3)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
...
TypeError: unable to coerce <class 'sage.libs.gap.element.GapElement_FiniteField'>
```


With the ticket branch, this works:

```
sage: sage: F=GF(25)
sage: sage: F(libgap.Z(25)^3)
4*z2 + 3
```


------------------------------------

As well, we switch to use libgap instead of pexpect GAP - internally
in the affected files. This is a part of #26902

I've left intact the ability to accept pexpect GAP data to be converted in Sage finite field elements - this means I need a test for this type.
I'm using an import statement 

```
from sage.interfaces.gap import is_GapElement
```

and a call to `is_GapElement()`.
Is there a way to avoid this call? I can also put the import into the `try` block and
set `is_GapElement()` to always return `False` in case of import exception.

I can also resort to not calling `is_GapElement()`, and rely on exceptions - this would need a bit more rearranging of if/else. 

However, there are still explicit tests like `sage: S(gap('Z(25)^3'))`, and there is a discrepancy between `libgap` and (pexpect) `gap` in the way they treat such inputs:

```
sage: gap('Z(25)^3')
Z(5^2)^3
sage: gap.eval('Z(25)^3')
'Z(5^2)^3'
sage: libgap.eval('Z(25)^3')
Z(5^2)^3
sage: libgap('Z(25)^3')
"Z(25)^3"
```


So these tests will have to go as soon as `gap` is set to `libgap`.

Loading `libgap` takes time. After it's loaded, it should actually be faster to use
it.

In this particular case, you only need `libgap(e)` on `e` coming from pexpect `gap`.
So there is an extra conversion involved, and we are getting rid of  pexpect `gap`
anyway, so after this is done these conversions (to Sage types) will be much faster
(they are just `e.sage(ring=self.parent)`)

One should not use pexpect `gap`, it should be deprecated. Do you want this to happen on this ticket?

the only "real" use of `gfq_gap_to_sage` is in sage/coding - and this is eliminated in #34771, along with the use of pexpect GAP.

Thus the only possible speed regression can appear in user code, while using pexpect GAP.

Why is there a possibility of import exception?

The definition of `is_GapElement()` is `isinstance(x, GapElement)`. This lets you avoid the call. But perhaps I simply don't understand your intention or context...

For deprecation it will not work so well because modules such as `sage.interfaces.gap` create an instance of the interface class at load time, which would trigger the deprecation warning already.

> Another approach: #34804 Deprecate `sage.interfaces` `is_...Element` functions

OK, this is interesting. So this would mean unconditionally importing `GapElement` from 
`sage.interfaces.abs`, right? I'm only not completely sure I understand what should be in the latter, as examples such as in `src/sage/rings/abc.pyx` look like dark magic to me.

Yes.

I've pushed a barebones version to #34804. `src/sage/rings/abc.pyx` is longer, but it's just decoration

there are more importings of `GapElement_FiniteField` in this patch, i suppose you'd like to deal with them all.

Why don't we instead go the way we went with `GapElement` here, by adding `sage.libs.abc`, etc?

Can we do `sage.libs.abc` as a part of #32414, on a separate ticket?
After all, the current ticket is a part of #26902, which is not modularisation.

There are about 180 `from sage.libs.gap...` in Sage, I suppose none of them in `try... except block`. It's begging for a separate ticket, which is best attended to once we've replaced all pexpect GAP with libgap.

Do you mean it's OK for you to have imports in functions, say?
E.g. in `src/sage/rings/number_field/number_field.py` there is
`def _libgap_(self)` where `libgap` is unconditionally imported.
