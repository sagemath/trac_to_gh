Good catch. I didn't know the bdists didn't have `spkg/pipestatus`.

In principle positive review; should test this of course (later).

If you thrust the author of the patch to do the test, I am doing the following:
 * building Sage from source with #9799, #10156, #10157 applied and makefile renamed to Makefile
 * making an sdist and a bdist from this built Sage
 * extract the sdist, make, make ptestlong
 * extract the bdist, make ptestlong

If all this works, I think that #10156 and #10157 are proven to work.

Well, the "catch" was made because the above recipe failed.

All builds and tests mentioned above worked with #9799, #10156, #10157 applied.

The patch looks completely sensible, and it's worked for me when I tested it out.

Set "merged" to sage-4.6.1.alpha1 by mistake (this patch didn't change).
