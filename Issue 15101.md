With the latest versions of Sage, I'm unable to build the doc in parallel because it seems that Cywgin/Windows fails to load two different dlls with the same name.

More precisely the problem occured with function.pyx both in sage/symbolic and sage/libs/singular.

Changing the name of one of this files solved the problem.

Is this still an issue? Given that `@`embray never mentioned this, I would guess not.

It might still be. I've never had parallel doc builds working, though I'm not sure whether or not this is the reason.

Parallel doc build works fine for me, and this should not be a problem.  Clashing DLL filenames should only be a problem, AFAIK, for implicitly loaded DLLs.
