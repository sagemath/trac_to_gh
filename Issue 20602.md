Implement basic intersection analysis, such as when given two curves and a point, determine if the point is in the intersection of the two curves, and if so, compute the intersection multiplicity of the curves at that point if defined. Also, given a projective curve, determine if it is a complete intersection.

- intersects_at(): why not but both attempts in the same try block?


- is_complete_intersection: Boolean can go on the same line at OUTPUT
not the radical ideal per our discussion today

here is another noncomplete intersection example

```
P.<x,y,z,w>=ProjectiveSpace(QQ,3)
X= Curve([x*z-y^2,z*(y*w-z^2) - w*(x*w-y*z)])
X.is_complete_intersection()
```


- intersection_multiplicity: an integer can go on the same line as OUTPUT

good these add up to 4 as bezout's theorem implies

```
K.<i>=QuadraticField(-1)
A.<x,y>=AffineSpace(K,2)
C = Curve([x^2-y])
D = Curve([x^2+y^2])
for t in C.intersection(D).rational_points():
    C.intersection_multiplicity(D,t)
```


also good

```
K.<i>=QuadraticField(-1)
A.<x,y>=AffineSpace(K,2)
C = Curve([y^2-x^3])
D = Curve([(x^2+y^2)^2 - 4*x^2*y^2])
for t in C.intersection(D).rational_points():
    C.intersection_multiplicity(D,t)
```


so for plane curves this looks ok. Does this really work in dimension greater than 2? I don't think it does, I think the intersection number possibly has lower order terms.  Regardless, in looking at this, the following  example died


```
K.<i>=QuadraticField(-1)
A.<x,y,z>=AffineSpace(K,3)
C = Curve([x^2-y,z^2+x^2])
D = Curve([x^2+y^2,x^2+z])
for t in C.intersection(D).rational_points():
    C.intersection_multiplicity(D,p)
```




- I think an transverse check would be nice too:

is_transverse() - Returns true if and only if the point p is a nonsingular point of both plane curves C and D and the curves have distinct tangents there.

Thanks, I made most of the changes, but haven't yet addressed the intersection_multiplicity issue. Is there a good way to generalize the intersection multiplicity computations to work for space curves, or would it be best to make them specific to plane curves?

I really don't have much homological algebra background, but if I understand correctly, I think a general definition of intersection multiplicity is given by Serre's Tor formula. I think Singular has some functionality for working with the needed constructions, but I'm not sure whether it's enough to be able to do multiplicity computations.

This looks fine except that is_transverse should return False when one of the points is singular.
