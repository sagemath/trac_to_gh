# Issue 17762: Two new Games: Fair Cake Cutting and Kuhn Poker

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: github/ankuromar296

Original creation time: 2015-03-19 17:00:40

CC:  vinceknight jcampbell

I have tried to implement two more games namely fair cake cutting game and kuhn poker game.. These are very basic implementation and needs a lot of modification to include more number of players. With the time given, more functionalities can be added to the module.

This ticket... no author, no type... and are you sure it's really major priority?

I'm taking a look at this. Note that it has created a trac ticket: http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/17999#comment:4

Usually Sage development is done via trac.

I'm quite confused by this as you seem to have pasted in the diffs from a git commit? I'd suggest you take a look at this repository: https://github.com/theref/sage-game-theory

That is where the main development happens for Game Theory. In particular you might want to checkout and work from the [catalog](https://github.com/theref/sage-game-theory/tree/catalog) branch there. That branch is actively working on creating a catalog of games which seems to be where you got some of the code (I apologise if I'm confused). For example in [Kuhn_Poker](https://github.com/ankuromar296/sage/blob/master/src/sage/game_theory/Kuhn_Poker) I see:

```
diff --git a/src/sage/game_theory/named_games.py b/src/sage/game_theory/named_games.py
index b9da09e..d7d9958 100644

I apologise for my mistake. I will take care of it in future. I used existing codes from  https://github.com/sagemath/sage/tree/e88642d0ec3dc79278b8828a0b91e5d2d654d17a/src/sage/game_theory and took help from the existing tickets on game theory from http://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/TicketReports to start builiding upon. Fair cake cutting is a simple zero sum game and can be easily implemented by using existing source available. For kuhn poker, i have exhaustively defined every possible scenario for a two player game with 3 different cards with different payoffs.

I suggest you have a read of the sage developers guide, there's a lot of useful information about general conventions for contributing. http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/

You've currently only included what looks like a diff file, reading through code that's already been included in Game Theory for Sage should help with structure.

It would be really good to get these included, looking forward to seeing how things progress!!

Really, this patch will make no sense until #17392 is done.  Also, the code itself is quite incomplete and seems to hardcode in a particular game (?).  That said, it will be a nice addition once that is cleared up - perhaps the author actually has that code but it didn't make it into those diffs, for instance.
