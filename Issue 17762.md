You've currently only included what looks like a diff file, reading through code that's already been included in Game Theory for Sage should help with structure.

It would be really good to get these included, looking forward to seeing how things progress!!

Really, this patch will make no sense until #17392 is done.  Also, the code itself is quite incomplete and seems to hardcode in a particular game (?).  That said, it will be a nice addition once that is cleared up - perhaps the author actually has that code but it didn't make it into those diffs, for instance.
