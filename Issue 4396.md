```
[3:04pm] mabshoff: #4396 looks a lot like #4629 to me.
[3:04pm] wstein-4629 is now known as wstein-463.
[3:05pm] wstein-463: I disagree.
[3:05pm] wstein-463: I think #4396 could be implemented using #463 partly.
[3:05pm] wstein-463: But it isn't the same.
[3:05pm] mabshoff: ok
```

That's what `sage -upgrade` does by default now, according to its doc.
