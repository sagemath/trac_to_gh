Keywords: pari windows cygwin

It seems that `gen.eval()` is returning `pari('0')` in cases where it should be returning `None`.  The relevant code is

```cython
        if t == t_CLOSURE:
            if nkwds > 0:
                raise TypeError("cannot evaluate a PARI closure using keyword arguments")
            if closure_is_variadic(self.g):
                arity = closure_arity(self.g) - 1
                args = list(args[:arity]) + [0]*(arity-nargs) + [args[arity:]]
            t0 = objtogen(args)
            sig_on()
            result = closure_callgenvec(self.g, t0.g)
            if result == gnil:
                P.clear_stack()
                return None
            return P.new_gen(result)
```

So it seems like `result != gnil` when it is expected to be.  For example this test from the doctests is failing:

```
sage: def printme(x):
....:     print(x)
....:
sage: objtoclosure(printme)('matid(2)')
[1, 0; 0, 1]
0
```

The final `0` is the return value from calling the closure.  It should return `None`.  This is especially odd because the logic in `objtoclosure` is that if the called Python function returns `None` the PARI function should return `gnil`.

I didn't have this bug a few weeks ago, and it's strange that I'm only seeing it on Cygwin.

I see--that helps explain it.  Maybe there's something odd going on with pointer comparison.

Though I guess `is_universal_constant(gen_0)` ought to return `1` if I'm reading the docs correctly, so I guess that patch is the wrong thing to do?

I have already tried that : The damn thing sprouts back (and the error is the same...).

> `pari-2.8.0.alpha.p2` is the current version which built correctly. So I see no problem here.


I see it : I've spent a large part of Sunday trying to get 7.5beta0+#20523 to compile, to no avail... the problem comes back even after a `make distclean`.


Currently I'm compiling 7.4+#20523+#a preliminary version of 21744 (not yet pushed), which seems to have passed the critical point. However, each passage from 7.4 to 7.5.beta0 needs >1h to compile (something seems to have radically changed, and I don't see what...).

I'll keep you posted after a `ptestlong` of this 7.4 patched version.

[EDIT] According to [Volker's announcement](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-release/RxGpeK0kMsc), the present patch (#21637) has been added between 7.4 and 7.5beta0... To me, it's newer than 2.8.0.alpha.p2 (which I seem to remember to have seen late 7.4 betas...). Hasn't it been merged in error ? On my workin sage installation(7.4) :

```
charpent@asus16-ec:/usr/local/sage-7$ sage -standard
[package]...............................[latest version] ([version])
....
pari....................................2.8.0.alpha.p1 (2.8.0.alpha.p1)
...}}}

In that case, you are either using an old version of Sage (if so: merge current `develop`) or there is something wrong with your branch (which git branch is that?).

`develop`##20523+#21744 (and, yes, I did `git fetch` and `git pull` before that.

Maybe I should try a fresh tree ?

Double-check that your `develop` branch is really what you think it is (should be `7.5.beta0`). If it is, you somehow messed up the merging of `develop` with those 2 branches.

Starting from a fresh tree, I managed to build and ptestlong successfully (modulo the usual transient error on `simplicial_complex.py`) #20523+#21744 over both 7.4 and 7.5beta0.

I still do not understand how I managed to mess up my previous attempts.
