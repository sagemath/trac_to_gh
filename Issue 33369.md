Try the following [interact which works correctly in Sage cell server](https://sagecell.sagemath.org/?z=eJxNjUEKwyAQRfeB3GF2GWEopNkFhN4jBLFxUgSjQUZJb19LN33Lz_u8h4_C2W7Sd453MFg1DpU3SXkg8PEsYl7ZOxwJJoLm2BJEL8tId5rWlUCSqTYU1sEeT2fhmuH3xz1YEY54qS9z30HjzK2I8j4Zq1L_W73FlA9U6gPlXS5Y&lang=sage&interacts=eJyLjgUAARUAuQ==) in Jupyter instead.

```
@interact
def _(v=('vector', input_grid(1, 3, default=[[1,2,3]], to_value=lambda x: vector(flatten(x))))):
    print(type(v))
    print(v.norm())
```

We get the _very_ unexpected result

```
TypeError: unable to find a common ring for all elements
```

even though the traceback clearly shows that all of the integers are initially parsed in the same ring of `Integer`s.

Something similar happens with matrices:

```
@interact
def _(m=('matrix',matrix([[1,0],[0,1]]))):
    print(m.eigenvalues())
```

[works fine in the cell server](https://sagecell.sagemath.org/?z=eJxzyMwrSS1KTC7h5UpJTVOI18i11VDPTSwpyqxQ14HQGtHRhjoGsTrRBjqGsbGamppWvFwKQFBQBNSrkauXmpmemleWmFOaWqyhqQkADYsY4g==&lang=sage&interacts=eJyLjgUAARUAuQ==) but raises

```
TypeError: unable to convert 'm' to an integer
```

which seems to probably be about the same thing.

Anyway, my preliminary diagnosis is that however we are handling input grids can't handle labels for some reason.
