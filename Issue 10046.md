`mod(0,1).crt(mod(a, n))` raises a `ZeroDivisionError` if and only if `n >= 2^31-1`.


```
sage: mod(0,1).crt(mod(4,2^31-2))

David, I'm not sure the proposed patch is optimal. Indeed, the problem only occurs when self
is a small integer and other is a GMP integer. Since the small integer code seems to deal
correctly with mod(0,1), a fix is only needed is the case self=mod(0,1) and other is a GMP
integer, for example after the line

```
        if other.modulus() == 1:
            return self
```

Robert, since you wrote this code, can you comment on this?
