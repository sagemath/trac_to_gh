# Issue 17331: Allow syntax FiniteField(p, n)

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/17568

Keywords: finite field

It should be possible to use the syntax `FiniteField(p, n, ...)` as a synonym for `FiniteField(p^n, ...)` to create a finite field with `p^n` elements.

Another possibility would be `FiniteField((p, n))`.

Discussed at ticket:31686#comment:8 which led to
opening #31709 (duplicate of this ticket).

using `foo((a,b))` instead of `foo(a,b)` is weird. If you have `t=(a,b)` you can always call `foo(*t)`.

I definitely prefer `FiniteField((p, n))` rather than `FiniteField(p, n)`.  Here the tuple `(p, n)` is taking the place of the integer `p^n` to save some factoring time.  In `FiniteField(p, n)` the `n` is a positional argument in a slot that is usually the variable name.  How do you specify the variable name if you want to use this syntax?  Yes, it's possible to parse all this, but `GF((p, n))` is simple enough.

I'll also note that factoring the order is a small fraction of the time spent in constructing the field (unless the prime is quite large):


```
sage: %time factor(2^1001)

sage: %time K.<a> = GF(next_prime(2^200)^6)

```


This optimization will be useful for very large characteristic though.

I don't know why the 2nd slot it "usually" the primitive element name.
E.g. we have `PolynomialRing(QQ, 2, 'alpha0')`. Make it the 3rd slot, or a keyword arg.
Putting extra pair of brackets around `p,n` is very wrong to me.


---

Comment by roed created at 2021-04-22 00:05:34

I was actually thinking of the `PolynomialRing` parsing code as exactly what I wanted to avoid.


---

Comment by roed created at 2021-04-22 00:06:30

Using a tuple there doesn't seem wrong to me at all.  It's a different way of representing a single argument: the order of the field.


---

Comment by roed created at 2021-04-22 00:07:06

I see `GF(3, 5)` as more strange, as if `5` is an extra argument in the construction of `GF(3)`.


---

Comment by vdelecroix created at 2021-04-22 06:44:21

And why not change `Factorization([(2,3),(3,5)])` to `Factorization(2, 3, 3, 5)`? More seriously, grouping `(p, n)` makes a lot of sense as it represents a single number in a factored form. This is also the format that PARI/GP uses.


---

Comment by dimpase created at 2021-04-22 07:02:44

and the format I advocate is used by GAP and Magma.


---

Comment by vdelecroix created at 2021-04-22 07:13:13

Yes, they have uniform notations: `GF(2,3)` and `SL(2,3)`.


---

Comment by dimpase created at 2021-04-22 09:09:27

well, we can allow both formats, just check whether the type of the 1st argument is a pair.

What happens if the user passes (9, 1)?


---

Comment by chapoton created at 2021-08-21 15:28:14

currently, this raises an Error. Would you like it to be accepted ?


---

Comment by slelievre created at 2021-08-21 15:51:56

Raising an error in this case is fine.

Maybe add an example or two to
the [main finite field documentation](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/finite_rings/sage/rings/finite_rings/finite_field_constructor.html)?
