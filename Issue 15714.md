# Issue 15714: Fix last string exception for python3

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/15951

Original creator: wluebbe

Original creation time: 2014-03-16 10:39:57

Keywords: python3, exception, raise

`sage/algebras/quatalg/quaternion_algebra.py`

has in line 988 the (hopefully) last string exception (I found no other):

`raise "base field must be rational numbers or number field"`.

These have been deprecated since long.
They not accepted be Python 3.

Should rather be a ValueError, in my humble opinion

ok, I have made a branch with ValueError. (plus a few pep8 details around)

If you agree with my branch, you cen set this to positive review

I had selected `TypeError` after looking at the other raise statements in this module. But `ValueError` is nearly as good :-)

So the patch is fine for me.
