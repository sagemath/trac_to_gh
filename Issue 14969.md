I understand that this, along with the lack of support for non-hashable labels, is owed to the implementation, but IMHO this means that the implementation (via relabelling the poset before plotting it, rather than as one would expect via doing everything as if the labels weren't there and then introducing them at the very end) is bad. (Incidentally, I'm not even sure that the shape of the image doesn't depend on the labels -- in the examples I've checked it seems to not depend on them, but I don't trust the code very much.)

I am not the type of mathematician who gets any enlightenment out of pictures, but even I do need to use `show()` when I'm making a presentation. Issues like this harm the presentability of Sage code.

Fixing this would also help with problem when combining `vertex_colors` and `element_labels`. See for example

```
Poset({1:[]}).plot(vertex_colors={'red':[1]}, element_labels={1: 2})
```

I propose the following as it has saner behaviour:

```sage
class ElementWithLabel:
    """
    Auxiliary class for showing Posets with non-ijective relabeling. 
    """
    def __init__(self, element, label):
        self.element = element
        self.label = label
        
    def _latex_(self):
        return latex(self.label)
    
    def __str__(self):
        return str(self.label)

    def __repr__(self):
        return repr(self.label)
    
    def __hash__(self):
        return hash((hash(self.element), hash(self.label)))
    
    def __eq__(self, other):
        return self.element == other.element and self.label == other.label
```

It seems that this could be useful somewhere else as well. Is there some utility module where I could move this?

That is a better hash, yes. Good catch about the `__eq__`, and you should also implement a `__ne__`. However, I still disagree about the `__str__` as it is overkill:

```

It is better (safer) to always do:

```
sage: from sage.combinat.posets.posets import ElementWithLabel
```
Your `__ne__` is missing a blankline after `TESTS::`. Also, I didn't read your proposed hash close enough when you proposed it. I think a better one would be

```
return hash((repr(self.element), repr(self.label)))

If I remember correctly, what's going on is that the constructor of `FinitePoset`  looks into cache which has as keys `_hasse_diagram` and then it finds the `_hasse_diagram` of `P1` and just uses that which causes these problems (`self` is ElementWithLabel while `other` is `int` ... or the other way around).

The problem is not with posets but with the equality check:

```
sage: from sage.misc.element_with_label import ElementWithLabel
sage: 1 == ElementWithLabel(1, 'a')
# BOOM
```
Here is a fix for the `__eq__` (which I think is my fault for not caching it earlier as I thought this would only be compared internally). The example now works with the simplified hash.

If my changes are good, then I think we can set a positive review.
