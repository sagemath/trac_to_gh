1.7.3 does not build on FreeBSD 12 (also without Lidia, which is broken there), but 1.7.5 does. So this is something needed for FreeBSD becoming a 1st tier platform (see #26249).

I've checked that this works on Linux x86_64 (also with SAGE_CHECK=yes) and on FreeBSD.
Please feel free to check it for yourself and make it positive review.

marked as defect, as there are platforms for which it makes a difference from failure to working...
