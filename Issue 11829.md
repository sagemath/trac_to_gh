# Issue 11829: performance of dimension of cusp forms for Gamma(N) is insanely slow

One of the easiest dimension formulas is for the dimension of `S_2(Gamma(p))`.  However, in Sage, computing this dimension is shockingly slow.  For example,

```
sage: time Gamma(7).dimension_cusp_forms()
3
Time: CPU 17.27 s, Wall: 17.30 s
sage: time dimension_cusp_forms(Gamma(7),2)
3
Time: CPU 17.22 s, Wall: 17.25 s
```


Fix this.

This is fixed by #10546. With #10546 installed,

```
sage: time Gamma(17777).dimension_cusp_forms()
233722059481
Time: CPU 0.00 s, Wall: 0.00 s
```


So I propose we close this ticket.

Correction: It is #11601, not #10546, that fixes this, by implementing "nu3". Anyway, the point is that it's fixed.

I'm setting this to "positive review" to bring it to the attention of the release manager. Release manager: please close as fixed once #11601 is merged.
