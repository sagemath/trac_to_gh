Heeeeere it is ! A longer table, as we can compute it rather quickly now, aaaaand also a change in the syntax of the new function `mutually_orthogonal_latin_squares` which accepted `n,k` when all others (TD and OA) expected `k,n`.

Hi Nathann,

How does it fit with #16541?

Funny. There was no conflict during the merge. Git is smarter than I thought `;-)`

But I am less smart than git and it will help me for the reviews ;-) Thanks.

Let me answer your question again : there is no conflict between the two, they don't touch the same parts of the code `:-P`

Hi Nathann,

- You could remove the `# long time` for the test at lines 480 and 488.

- We will run into troubles if somebody asks for a table larger than the one available (with `compare=True`). There is no overflow check. Actually, it is not that bad, on the line failure you will get a `IndexError`.

Otherwise, looks good to me. What do you think of having `designs.MOLS_table` globally available? It is a cool feature.

Done.

You mean 10 000 ? `O_o`

Well, it is a cool feature but `designs.<tab>` is meant to gather constructors, so where could we put it ?...

Plus it is "cool" but it is mostly a toy. And it is well advertised at the head of the MOLS module's doc.
