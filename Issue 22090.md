# Issue 22090: maxima-lib interface to some orthogonal poly functions

The functions `chebyshev_U`, `chebyshev_T`, `laguerre`, and `gen_laguerre` had a Maxima interface in `function/orthogonal_polys` 
but this is phased out in #22325. It should be in `lib/` anyway.

NOTE: it may be necessary to load the `orthopolys` package. Is this possible with maxima-lib?

Actually there is no problem with the interface, sorry for the noise.

Closing tickets in the sage-duplicate/invalid/wontfix module with positive_review (i.e. someone has confirmed they should be closed).
