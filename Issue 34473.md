The recent upgrade of Sphinx to version 5.2.3 introduced unexpected changes in our documentation by the new "object entries in toc" feature of the new Sphinx.

See the main index page in the middle:

https://8f8af65e54d3a9962cfab40f15dc23f4e955b43f--sagemath-tobias.netlify.app/reference/curves/index.html

See the "CONTENTS" column on the right:

https://8f8af65e54d3a9962cfab40f15dc23f4e955b43f--sagemath-tobias.netlify.app/reference/curves/sage/schemes/riemann_surfaces/riemann_surface.html

To "fix" the unexpected changes, I prepared two tickets #34706 and #34710 (this ticket)

#34706 reverts the changes and makes the doc look as it did before the Sphinx upgrade.

#34710 keeps the object entries in toc, but remove them from the main index pages.

Now we need to make a choice:

(1) Accept the default of the new Sphinx (discard both of #34706 and #34710)

(2) Remove object entries from the doc (take #34706 and discard #34710)

(3) Keep object entries but remove them from main index pages (take #34710 and discard #34706)

https://a1b70f3da76e4e2324b6b1c7cf3765bbc4f7d737--sagemath-tobias.netlify.app/reference/curves/index.html

(4) Still other possibility. Then please open a new ticket for your favorite style.

I advocate (3), but others may have different favors. So I invite a few for opinions. If all agree with me, we will go for (3). Otherwise, I will open a vote (again...) in sage-devel.

(3) is fine with me


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2022-11-01 08:44:46

I also think 3 is good.

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2022-11-01 19:48:44

I agree.

Thank you for expressing your opinions!

I will discard #34706. 

Please review this ticket.

Sounds like we can finally kill (with fire and holy water please) the manually edited TOC at the start of the files.


---

Comment by klee created at 2022-11-04 01:11:59

For instance?

I saw something strange in a build this morning. It might be a glitch on my end, but I want to build the documentation one more time to make sure. If all goes well, I'll reset to positive.

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2022-11-09 22:49:09

For reasons I do not understand, it took over 3 hours to build the PDF documentation. It was much faster on another machine, and I don't see anything in the changes here that would cause that sort of thing. So back to a positive review.
