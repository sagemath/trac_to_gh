With 5.13.beta2 I get the following


```
sage: QuadraticField(-5)
Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^2 + 5
sage: QuadraticField?

This probably occurred because a *compiled* component of Sage has a bug
in it and is not properly wrapped with sig_on(), sig_off().
Sage will now terminate.

Using ? on other objects has the same effect.

I will try to install the gdb package. This is in Scientific Linux

```

The problem seems to be that Sage picks up my systems ncurses instead of sage-5.13.beta2/local/lib/libncurses.so.

I don't have a wide version of ncurses in sage-5.13.beta2/local/lib, so it might be that #15080 would fix my problems.

And, is it fixed now with #15268?

Changing component from c_lib to packages: standard.

Yes. 5.13.beta3 with #15268 fixed works fine.
