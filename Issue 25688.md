I looked the proposed changes. I have 4 comments:

1. I do not like to use min and max as variable since this erases/conflicts with the Python function having the same name. I prefer you use `minxyz` and then `minxyz = vector(minxyz)`. Same for `max`.

2. The two new `try` are trying too much code and do not follow [PEP 8 -- Style Guide for Python Code](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) which I cite below. Only the line calling `next` should be in the `try-except` clause.

```
Additionally, for all try/except clauses, limit the try clause to the absolute minimum amount of code necessary. Again, this avoids masking bugs.

Yes:

try:
    value = collection[key]
except KeyError:
    return key_not_found(key)
else:
    return handle_value(value)

No:

try:
    # Too broad!
    return handle_value(collection[key])
except KeyError:
    # Will also catch KeyError raised by handle_value()
    return key_not_found(key)
```

3. Replacing `G_set` (a set) by `G` (a list) makes many things unefficient like calling `__contains__` and `remove`. Is there a way to avoid this?

4. I do not like the change `return rows` -> `return sorted(rows)`. Is it really necessary since the other changes make the list of matrix transformations unique?

1. The line

```
assert all(h in G for h in H), "H must be a subset of G"
```
is not so efficient. I suggest you move earlier the creation of `G_todo` and that you use `G_todo` in this assert line.

2. What is this?

```
+from typing import List, Any

```
