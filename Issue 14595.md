# Issue 14595: Power series rings should have a change_var method

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: robharron

Original creation time: 2013-06-21 16:42:16

Assignee: AlexGhitza

Keywords: power series, variable name

The following change_var method for polynomials rings is quite convenient:


```
sage: P = PolynomialRing(QQ, 'x'); P
Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Rational Field
sage: P.change_var('y')
Univariate Polynomial Ring in y over Rational Field
```


But power series rings don't have this functionality.

LGTM. Please try to work with the development branch. I rebased your branch on 6.2.beta8. I also added a small reviewer's patch to correct the doc line according to the imperative form (which is the Sage convention, see http://sagemath.org/doc/developer/coding_basics.html#docstring-markup-with-rest-and-sphinx). Finally, please add your real name as author to this ticket.
