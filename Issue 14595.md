Assignee: @aghitza

Keywords: power series, variable name

The following change_var method for polynomials rings is quite convenient:

```
sage: P = PolynomialRing(QQ, 'x'); P
Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Rational Field
sage: P.change_var('y')
Univariate Polynomial Ring in y over Rational Field
```

But power series rings don't have this functionality.
