in order to avoid using cmp (not py3 compatible)
let us use a key function to sort elliptic curves over QQ.

Thanks for doing this.  Instead of using the string (the middle part of the label) it would be better to use the numerical version as produced by applying the function  sage.databases.cremona.class_to_int() since the string represents a number in base 26 and string sorting will get the order wrong.

Shouldn't `curve_cmp` be deprecated?
