# Issue 23556: Fall back to Maxima with some symbolic GCD computations

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/23793

Original creator: rws

Original creation time: 2017-09-06 14:42:15

For example `gcd(I-I*x, x^2-1)` will raise a runtime error (because `I` cannot be converted to Singular by Pynac). Maxima can solve this case and possibly others that give a runtime error.

Actually this is resolved in Pynac-0.7.12 and just needs a doctest.
