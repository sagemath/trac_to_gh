`solve` (from `expression.pyx`) passes a relational expression to Maxima's solve, but this doesn't seem to be available in sympy:

```
sage: (x==1)._maxima_()
_SAGE_VAR_x=1
sage: (x==1)._sympy_()
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
NotImplementedError: relation
```

do you have some idea on how to tackle this? otherwise, what about passing `ex.lhs()-ex.rhs()` to sympy's solve.

Fly in the ointment : `solve` can solve **systems** of equations, whereas `solveset` (which is, indeed, cleaner on more than one aspect), solves only equations.

In order to solve system, we would have to map `solveset` to all the equations in the system (each for one variable (which one ?)), and return the intersection of the results, which is currently problematic.


> i find that the interface `(equation, variable, domain)` is very clear. isn't it preferable than relying on global assumptions? (or to fallback into the global assumptions if the domain is not provided.)


The domain is only a part of the possible assumptions : e. g., maxima often asks if some expression is positive, if such variable is integer, etc... We need to maintain a "knowledge base" about outr variables as least as rich as our current (= Maxima's) facts base.

A few remarks :

1) I note that Sympy's knowledge base is richer than ours, BTW.

2) We might use profitably something analogous to Mathematica's `Assuming` statement, which does something (roughly )equivalent to :

```
def assuming(condset, statement):
    try:
        OldAssumptions=assumptions()
        Assumptions=OldAssumptions.copy()
        Assumptions.extend(condset)
        forget(assumptions())
        assume(Assumptions)
        result=<do statement, somehow>
    finally:
        forget(assumptions())
        assume(OldAssumptions)
```
The wasp in the ointment is of course that `statement` is evaluated before being passed to Assuming : Python has no macroes...

I //think// that `assuming` could be implemented somehow as a decorator, but I'm still to understand //that//.

I have abandoned the idea of respecting assumptions after I saw that SymPy doesn't either. We don't have to reproduce Maxima results so we're good.

If they replace it will be unified. And I think Sage's `ex.solve()` and `solve(ex)` should be unified too, if for no other reason than for better maintenance.

It's always problematic because you need to decide ordering of expressions without variables, and that can take time because of the possible need to increase precision. The question is, should we support SymPy's solve or immediately use solveset exclusively?

> We might use profitably something analogous to Mathematica's Assuming


Please review #10035.

> We need to maintain a "knowledge base" about outr variables as least as rich as our current (= Maxima's) facts base.


Isn't that the same as a local context?

That's pushing the can down the road : in order to get the solutions, we're bound to solve a system comprising the solutions obtained without the assumptions and the assumptions themselves, which might be unsolvable (e. g. cubic equation with a solution in //casus irreducibilis// + constraints showing that the roots are real)...

Done (positively). But that is a possible solution only for function calls supporting `hold`. `solve` isn't one of them.

It motivates me to create a context infrastructure where you can say:

```
sage: mycontext = context(x>0, hold)
sage: with mycontext:
sage:     solve(...)
```
or

```
sage: mycontext.start()
sage: ...
sage: solve(...)
sage: mycontext.stop()
```

It needs doc, however. And some options do not seem to work on multivariate systems :

```
sage: solve(x^3+1==0,x,domain="real") ## domain="real" does not work in Maxima's solver...
[x == 1/2*I*sqrt(3)*(-1)^(1/3) - 1/2*(-1)^(1/3), x == -1/2*I*sqrt(3)*(-1)^(1/3) - 1/2*(-1)^(1/3), x == (-1)^(1/3)]
sage: solve(x^3+1==0,x,algorithm="sympy",domain="real") # ...but works with Sympys's solver ...
[x == -1]
sage: solve([x^2+y^2 == 1, y^2 == x^3 + x + 1], [x, y],algorithm="sympy",domain=
....: "real") ### ... but not for systems.

[{y: -1, x: 0},
 {y: 1, x: 0},
 {y: -sqrt(-1/2*I*sqrt(3) + 3/2), x: -1/2*I*sqrt(3) - 1/2},
 {y: sqrt(-1/2*I*sqrt(3) + 3/2), x: -1/2*I*sqrt(3) - 1/2},
 {y: -sqrt(1/2*I*sqrt(3) + 3/2), x: 1/2*I*sqrt(3) - 1/2},
 {y: sqrt(1/2*I*sqrt(3) + 3/2), x: 1/2*I*sqrt(3) - 1/2}]
```

Notwithstandig that, `positive_review`.

This is a new branch because of differences in the dependencies. I also added the missing translation of `LambertW`. Another problem is that SymPy's `solveset` is not always better than its `solve` esp. with nonlinear equations, compare e.g. `x+2**x==0`. This needs more work later.

Please review, these should be the last big changes.
