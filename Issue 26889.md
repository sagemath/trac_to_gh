# Issue 26889: py3: Fix plot module for python3

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27126

The root cause for matplotlib's `AttributeError: Unknown property which` was testing `hasattr(x, '__iter__')` to filter `str`. `str` hasn't an `__iter__` method in py2 but has one in py3.
