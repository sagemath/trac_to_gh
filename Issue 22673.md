To build a polynomial ring over some ring `R`, SageMath calls `R.is_field()`. If this method raises an exception `NotImplementedError`, the polynomial ring cannot be built. An example of the behavior was given on [Ask](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/37467):


```python
sage: p = 5
sage: F = GF(p)
sage: R1.<x> = F['x']
sage: F1.<alpha1> = F.extension(x^p - x - 1)
sage: R2.<x> = F1['x']
sage: F2.<alpha2> = F1.extension(x^p - x - alpha1^(p-1))
sage: R3.<x> = F2['x']
sage: F3.<alpha3> = F2.extension(x^p - x - (alpha1*alpha2)^(p-1))
sage: R4.<x> = F3['x']
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
NotImplementedError:
```


The purpose of the current ticket is to catch this exception to act as if `R` was known not to be a field.
