# Issue 20955: Minor tweaks to free_monoid_element

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: drupel

Original creation time: 2016-08-08 14:36:31

CC:  kohel etn40ff

Keywords: monoid, free monoid

This patch modifies the _mul_ and _len_ methods of free_monoid_element to allow for negative exponents.  It also incorporates an _invert_ method.  

These changes effectively allow one to use the free_monoid as a free group so that the free algebra may be used as a "free Laurent polynomial ring".

I had a look at this code and did some refactoring. I could not push to `u/drupel/21192` so I made a new branch at `u/etn40ff/21192`.

The code looks good to me and ready for a positive review. These changes, though, might be controversial since they add an operation that is not really meant to be there. I would feel better if someone with more experience were to give a positive review.

Honestly, the `__invert__` method is not necessarily needed and could be removed without any complaint by me.

A strong -1 to this ticket. You should just use a free group instead.

One other possible thing (which should have a post to sage-devel once it is positively reviewed) is to implement the canonical coercion to the corresponding free group with division/invert returning an element of the free group.

I agree with tscrim, the code is actually from several years ago when there was some issue with the group algebra of a free group but that works just fine now.  I am moving it to `wontfix`.

Determined to be invalid/duplicate/wontfix (closing as "wontfix" as a catch-all resolution).
