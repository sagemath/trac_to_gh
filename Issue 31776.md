Sorry, I was a bit premature. I am getting doctest failures:

```
sage -t --random-seed=0 src/sage/geometry/convex_set.py  # 2 doctests failed
```


```
File "src/sage/geometry/convex_set.py", line 444, in sage.geometry.convex_set.ConvexSet_base._test_convex_set
Failed example:
    TestSuite(BiggerOnTheInside()).run(skip=('_test_pickling', '_test_contains'))
Expected:
    Failure in _test_convex_set:
    ...
    The following tests failed: _test_convex_set
Got:
      Failure in _test_an_element:
```

Just needs to update the expected output.

While that is against our general practice, it is not sufficient to revert a positive review IMO. However, if Matthias wants to update it, he can go ahead and do it (and immediately reset a positive review).

Replying to [comment:27 tscrim]:

... in particular since this is not new code. It's not the job of a ticket to fix everything that's wrong in a given file.

I have opened a ticket devoted to those deviations of convention: #32192.
