CC:  @dimpase

I propose to get rid of src/bin/sage-arch-env, SAGE_LOCAL/etc/sage-64.txt, 
which is a very specialized mechanism of storing a bit of configuration in SAGE_LOCAL.
Instead, SAGE64 should become a configure option (see #23570).

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/23733

Is anybody actually using that option? I would go for deprecating it and getting rid of it eventually.

First of all, I don't know what you mean with "build Sage in one go".

Second, regardless of what you mean: is it a regression? Suppose that the following are true:

(A) It is impossible to build Sage in one go *without* this patch.

(B) It is impossible to build Sage in one go *with* this patch.

In these are both true (since I don't know what you mean, I can't say whether that is the case), then your complaint is not meaningful.

```

In Atlas configuration you did the following:

```
-conf['32bit?'] = not conf['64bit?']
+conf['64bit?'] = (conf['bits'] == '64bit')
+conf['32bit?'] = (conf['bits'] == '32bit')
```

This is a different logic for `conf['32bit?']` vs. the originally intended one.
By right, you should have just done

```
+conf['64bit?'] = (conf['bits'] == '64bit')
conf['32bit?'] = not conf['64bit?']
...

```

What does this patch do to CFLAG64? (which is a documented Sage variable after all).

It's not clear. The ticket description does not mention it, but in several places
you remove special-casing for it.
