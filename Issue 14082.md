# Issue 14082: Remove getusage() test

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/14286

Original creator: jdemeyer

Original creation time: 2013-03-16 21:14:53

Assignee: jason

This test sometimes fails and should be removed, since it doesn't really test anything anyway:

```
sage -t --long devel/sage/sage/misc/getusage.py
**********************************************************************
File "devel/sage/sage/misc/getusage.py", line 107, in sage.misc.getusage.get_memory_usage
Failed example:
    get_memory_usage(t)
Expected:
    0.0
Got:
    -0.015625
**********************************************************************
```

I am surprsed it doesn't fail more often. Not sure what the point of test is either so removal is good and definitely no side effects. Let's get it moving.
