The f2c spkg currently does not respect the global CC flag, we should fix this (for instance for #12426).

I've posted an spkg at [http://wstein.org/home/ohanar/clang-port/sage-5.0.beta1-src/spkg/standard/f2c-20070816.p3.spkg](http://wstein.org/home/ohanar/clang-port/sage-5.0.beta1-src/spkg/standard/f2c-20070816.p3.spkg).
