# Issue 27909: The Input Kernel for the Isogeny of Elliptic Curves does not accept points in the Torsion Subgroup

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28146

Original creator: menosgeze

Original creation time: 2019-07-09 17:37:30

Keywords: Elliptic Curves, Isogenies, Kernel

The ``EllipticCurveIsogeny`` class only accepts kernels formed by points in the elliptic curve, but not points in the Torsion subgroup, even though they are the same points.

Hi. Have you run the doctests? I don't think they would pass: `.torsion_subgroup()` is only defined for curves over the rationals, but the isogeny object is used for curves over any field.
