I haven't looked at this in detail, but you use the method `rational_points()` of the subscheme defined by the divisor.  Wouldn't `irreducible_components()` be the right thing to use, to handle the case where the support contains non-rational points?

I agree that this would be better, however Sage can't yet deal with divisors containing non-rational points (see the TODO in the docstring of `Divisor_curve` in `sage/schemes/generic/divisor.py`).

How about a comment in the new code saying that we should use `irreducible_components()` as soon as non-rational points can be dealt with?  I'd rather not postpone fixing an existing issue while we wait for new functionality that could take a while to arrive.
