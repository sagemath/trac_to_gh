# Issue 12081: SVD segfaults on complex matrices

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/12253

Original creator: lftabera

Assignee: tbd

Keywords: SVD, CDF, segfault

SVD segfaults depending on the size of a matrix over CDF


```
sage: a = random_matrix(CDF,13,24)
sage: t = a.SVD()
sage: a = random_matrix(CDF,13,22)
sage: t = a.SVD()                 
sage: a = random_matrix(CDF,13,23)
sage: t = a.SVD() 
Boom!
```


It also fails for 30x50 matrices. This happens on debian i386 and x86_64

The segfault happens with vanilla scipy, reported upstream as #1580

It was an upstream error that has been fixed in scipy 0.11 that is already in Sage.
It has its own doctest in scipy.

The upstream report was [http://projects.scipy.org/scipy/ticket/1580](http://projects.scipy.org/scipy/ticket/1580).  Good find.
