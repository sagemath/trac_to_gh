Something is wrong with the multi-modular matrix multiplication code for matrices over ZZ.  At random, and infrequently, it gives incorrect results.  For example, the following code chooses random 3x2 and 2x10 integer matrices and multiplies them together using the multi-modular algorithm.  It then does the same multiplication 100 more times, checks that the answer is always the same, and if not raises an exception:


```
sage: for n in range(2000):
....:     A = MatrixSpace(ZZ,3,2).random_element()    
....:     B = MatrixSpace(ZZ,2,10).random_element()
....:     try_once = A._multiply_multi_modular(B)
....:     for k in range(100):
....:             try_again = A._multiply_multi_modular(B)
....:         if try_once != try_again:
....:                 print "="*60
....:             print "n = %s, k = %s"%(n,k)
....:             print "A = "
....:             print A
....:             print "B ="
....:             print B
....:             print "first attempt = "
....:             print try_once
....:             print "k-th retry = "
....:             print try_again
....:             raise RuntimeError
....: 
```

This fails with very high probability (on Sage 4.6.2 under OS X, built from source) with output such as:


```
============================================================
n = 27, k = 43
A =

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
RuntimeError [...]
```

Note that the two candidates for the matrix product here are congruent modulo 1103, which is prime.  If you rerun the code with verbose logging, using set_verbose(2), then every time it fails the two candidates for the matrix product are congruent modulo the prime being used in the multi-modular algorithm.  Thus I suspect that the Chinese Remainder Theorem code in sage/ext/multi_modular.pyx is not handling a corner case properly.

OK, just saw that in IRC and thought I'd capture it.

}
```

I think I've got it.

This seems to happen iff a random prime happens to be chosen twice.  For example, if you modify _extend_moduli_to_height_c to always reuse a prime if more than one is needed, this always happens.  The same bug seems to exist in _extend_moduli_to_count as well.

The problem seems to be that in _new_random_prime, there's a test which doesn't do what it's trying to do:


```
    cdef mod_int _new_random_prime(self):
        # choose a new random prime
        cdef Py_ssize_t i
        cdef mod_int p
        while True:
            p = random_prime(self._u_bound, lbound =self._l_bound)
            for i in range(self.n):
                if p == self.moduli[i]:
                    break
            else:
                return p
```


IIUC, the "for i in range(self.n)" loop is attempting to avoid the problem of repeated primes, but this only works if p is added to self.moduli immediately after it's returned.  In the case of  _extend_moduli_to_height_c, this isn't true; the addition is delayed until a later extend_with_primes call, so the above check decides that the prime isn't reused, we get repeated moduli, and the multiplication breaks.

Or even more obviously:


```
sage: from sage.ext.multi_modular import MultiModularBasis_base
sage: mm = MultiModularBasis_base(1)
sage: mm._extend_moduli_to_count(1000)
1000
sage: len(mm), len(set(mm))
(1000, 843)
```


ISTM either we can remove the check-for-duplicate code from _new_random_prime and do it externally, or we can add an argument and pass it the "accumulated" primes as we build them elsewhere so it can avoid duplicates there too.  I prefer the first.  Should I work up a patch?

Okay, here's my first attempt.  Because another function calls _new_random_prime assuming that it correctly avoids duplication I had to change my intended approach a bit, but it should work.  

Two other minor changes:

(1) as mentioned above, mpz_crt_vec_tail() has what looks to me like vestigial code, and I've removed it.

(2) the documentation for replace_prime_c claimed that it would replace a prime with a greater prime, but made no efforts to ensure the "greater than" part.  I've changed the doc accordingly.

Also, in the new implementation of _new_random_prime() there is the possibility of an infinite loop if self.moduli already contains all the primes between self._lbound and self._ubound.  I suggest modifying _new_random_prime() so that it:

* makes some number of tries (10? 100?) to find a new random prime p in the range self._lbound < p < self._ubound; and 

* if this fails then it increases self_ubound and tries again.

I suggest raising an error instead of increasing `_ubound`. The upper bound is usually set so that the primes fit in a single machine word. A lot of things would break if this changed without notice.

Is it really the case that raising self._ubound would cause things to break?  I thought from looking at the multi-modular code that it all used mpz_t types from GMP, and that these would automatically increase their allocated memory as necessary. 

The multi-modular code is used in five places: dense matrix multiplication over ZZ; dense matrix multiplication over cyclotomics; dense matrix multiplication over QQ (although only in the rational reconstruction routines _lift_crt_rr() and _lift_crt_rr_with_lcm(), which I think are dead code); echelon form calculations over cyclotomics; and characteristic polynomial calculations over cyclotomics.  If we decide to raise an error if the multi-modular code runs out of primes then we will need to catch this error and handle it appropriately in all five places.

This is better than trying to handle it magically in the `MultiModularBasis` class.

Multi precision integers are needed for the lifting step. One of the reasons to use a multi-modular algorithm is to take advantage of fast arithmetic implemented in hardware. This requires that the modulus is small enough to fit in a word size. For linear algebra, the dimensions of the matrix also come into play. Ideally you should reduce only once for each row*column multiplication.

You cannot assume that the only users of the code are in the Sage library. This class is designed to be an abstraction that makes it easy to implement multi modular algorithms.

Perhaps we can verify that this error will never occur in these places through some theoretical argument. It is highly unlikely that we will always keep choosing the same random prime.

```
sage: mm = MultiModularBasis(lbound=4,ubound=6,...)

or something equally silly, and then the multi-modular code would quickly run out of primes.

This is completely false. There are hardly any primes in that range:

```
sage: len(prime_range(2^10,2^15))
3340
```


The linear algebra in Sage is currently very broken in practice, perhaps due to various optimizations and re-implementations that have fundamentally broken things.   For example, I'm constantly hitting a problem of "not enough primes" (see #10281), even for matrices over QQ.

The patch does seem to eliminate the original bug for me, but there's still some strangeness for different _extend methods:


```

sage: set_random_seed(0)
sage: from sage.ext.multi_modular import MultiModularBasis_base
sage: m = MultiModularBasis_base(0);
sage: m._extend_moduli(100)
sage: len(m), len(set(m))
(101, 99)
sage: [k for k in m if list(m).count(k) > 1]
[30859, 3217, 30859, 3217]

```



```

sage: set_random_seed(1)
sage: from sage.ext.multi_modular import MultiModularBasis_base
sage: m = MultiModularBasis_base(0);
sage: m._extend_moduli_to_count(100)
100
sage: len(m), len(set(m))
(100, 97)
sage: [k for k in m if list(m).count(k) > 1]
[4001, 5309, 23293, 4001, 23293, 5309]
```


So I think that two of the three _extend methods still don't give results that I'd expect.
