# Issue 16282: Fix numerical output of tikzpictures of projections of polytopes

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: moritz

Original creation time: 2014-06-23 08:03:27

CC:  jipilab

The output of tikz method of projections of polytopes outputs scientific notation. This can then not be parsed by latex. 
I propose to fix this by using a python float instead of a sage float roundet to a certain number of significant digits.

Add a doctest to show that the problem is fixed.

Replace

```
Scientific notation is not used in the output (Trac #16519)::
```

by

```
Scientific notation is not used in the output (:trac:`16519`)::

```

(with a  newline!)

Hi,

All test passed on 6.6.beta5

I corrected a few trailing white spaces and some conventions while we're looking at the file...

You can do some simplification

```
if len(Vlist) == 0   ----> if not Vlist
while len(Vlist) > 0 ----> while Vlist
```

not very important though...

Done!

In the end, I did only some minor editions to Moritz code.

It looks good to me. I set this to positive review.
