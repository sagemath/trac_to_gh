The output of tikz method of projections of polytopes outputs scientific notation. This can then not be parsed by latex. 
I propose to fix this by using a python float instead of a sage float roundet to a certain number of significant digits.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/16519

while len(Vlist) > 0 ----> while Vlist
```
