# Issue 13461: New implementation of the blocks_and_cut_vertices methods

Issue created by migration from Trac.

This patch implements the `blocks_and_cut_vertices` method as proposed by Tarjan in 1972. The time complexity is in O(|V|+|E|). The running time improvement is significant compared to previous implementation.

Before:

```
sage: 
```


After:

```
```

In fact the time complexity is more than O(|V|+|E|) since I'm sorting the lists, but the extra computation time is negligible. This can be removed.

I'm using a try...except to test the end of iterations. This could be replaced with a more appropriate test, if any.

Ahahahaah. I am reading the patch, and laughing. Very smart use of iterators `:-)`

When you are to implement Tarjan's algorithms, you have to be smart ;-)

This algorithm has been published 40 years ago. We have to show some respect to the Master!

HelloooooooooooooooooooOO again !

Here is a patch that contains documentation only (if you like it), and three comments :

* What about replacing top by -1 everywhere ? This is Python code, not C arrays ! :-P
* Instead of ``if stack`` and indenting maaaaaaaaany lines in the code, what about writing instead ``if not stack: return whatever`` (and remove the terminal 'return' line) or ``if not stack: break`` and leave the code at its natural level ?
* ``w = stack.pop()`` at this line w is equal to v, isn't it ? ``O_o`` as it appears often afterwards I would sleep easier (unless I make a mistake) if it were replaced by ``w = v`` to make it explicit. With a ``stack.pop()`` just near, or course.

Thaaaaaaaanks for that patch ! I'll go enjoy some sun while it stays `:-)`

Oh by the way : what about adding, when everything here will be settled, another patch files that just moves the code we settle on to the file graph.py ? This has nothing to do in generic_graph.py !!!

I disagree. If we put `w = v`, then we still have to pop the top of the stack. It is more compact to write `w = stack.pop()`. Furthermore I don't think it could be faster to have 2 operations instead of 1.

Lucky you are. Here it's cold, raining, no light... welcome to the french riviera ;-)

Oh. It was only to make it easier to read. Just adding a comment above like "at this point w=v, as v is the value of stack[-1]" is more or less the same.

By the way, do we move the code to graph.py ?

I have added a comment before `w = stack.pop()`

I have nothing against moving the code, but are you sure no one is using this method on directed graphs?
Also, this method is used in `generic_graph.py` by several methods: `genus, vertex_connectivity, is_gallai_graph`, and in `isgci.py`. Would that be a problem?

Well.. I have no idea what this algorithm returns when using on a DiGraph. All I can tell is that it returns the blocks and cut vertices of the underlying graph, but what does it mean in a DiGraph ?

Genus and is_gallai_graph should be moved to graph.py too, by the way. Nothing to do in generic_graph either. This being said, vertex_connectivity should definitely stay there, but there is no problem with it as it only calls blocks_and_cut_vertices after checking that the graph is NOT directed `:-)`

Well. If we are to do all this, let's do it in another patch, don't you think ?

Yes, moving code should be done in specific patchs.
