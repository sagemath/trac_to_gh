Deleting `TripleDicts` and other weakref friends is currently recursive which limits
the depth of datastructures involving them that can be safely deleted. E.g:

```
from sage.structure.coerce_dict import MonoDict
M = MonoDict(11)

class A: pass
a = A()
prev = a

for i in range(1000):
    newA = A()
    M[prev] = newA
    prev = newA

len(M)
del a
Exception RuntimeError: 'maximum recursion depth exceeded while calling a Python object' in <sage.structure.coerce_dict.MonoDictEraser object at 0x5a13788> ignored
```

#10963 is apparently putting more stress on our weakref data structure
and triggers such recursion errors. See
http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/10963#comment:90 and followups for a
discussion.
