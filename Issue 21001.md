Keywords: random_fail

Comparison between integers and strings is by memory position, hence random order here:

```
sage -t --long src/sage/modules/tutorial_free_modules.py
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/modules/tutorial_free_modules.py", line 45, in sage.modules.tutorial_free_modules
Failed example:
    F = CombinatorialFreeModule(ZZ, ['spam', 'eggs', 42]); F.an_element()
Expected:
    3*B[42] + 2*B['eggs'] + 2*B['spam']
Got:
    2*B['eggs'] + 2*B['spam'] + 3*B[42]
**********************************************************************
1 item had failures:

The wording suggests that elements must be consistently comparable, but this is not a (strict) requirement of CFM. IMO, a better test would be of the form:

```
sage: F.an_element() == F.sum_of_terms([(42, 3), ('eggs', 2), ('spam', 2)])
True
