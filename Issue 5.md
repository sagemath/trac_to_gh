Currently I need to switch between my keyboard and mouse a lot to operate the notebook, especially when using it for development. For example, I would like to be able to restart the server without going for the mouse. There should be a way of assigning keyboard shortcuts.

Apparently I'm the only person who has ever requested this, and I don't particularly want it any more anyway, so marking this ticket invalid.
