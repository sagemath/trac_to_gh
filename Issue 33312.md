> `@`soehms, thanks for having a look. The first issue you mention also exists in `develop` and I made some progress in fixing it at #33550. The second issue is now fixed.

Merging with #33550 I had to resolve some conflics. So I think it would make sence to have it here as dependency.

Im not really familiar with `pytest`. Thus, I can check that this branch does what it is supposed to. But I'm not the right person to evaluate the code.
I think it would be helpful, if the hook function `pytest_collection_modifyitems` (and maybe other function and classes in `conftest.py`, as well) would have a docstring
explaining what this hook is good for (with pointers to the documentation) and why we need to use it here (in more than just one line).

Together with #33550 the behavior with respect to `src/sage/tests/cmdline.py` remains unchanged. Further, I get the following warnings:

Sorry, that was a little bit too fast. You accidently dropped a line from the doctest in `src/sage/tests/cmdline.py`. The first failure (line 313) I reported in [comment:4](https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/33549#comment:4) has not been in `develop`.


```diff

As soon as this is fixed you may switch back to positive review.

I agree with him that these test-related methods should have been private from the get-go. Especially since most of them contain an explicit disclaimer ala "this is intended only for usage in doctests".
