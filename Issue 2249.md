# Issue 2249: [with patch; needs review] comments to indicate in docstrings that log is not finished in some cases for p-adics

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: was

Original creation time: 2008-02-21 19:19:05

Assignee: somebody

The point of this patch is that log isn't implemented, we need to make this release, and this patch just makes the doctests pass and clearly state that log isn't implemented in a certain case yet.

Ok, patch looks good and the issue should be fixed down the road by David Roe or somebody else working on p-adics.

Cheers,

Michael
