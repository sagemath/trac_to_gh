Keywords: cython distutils

This is a follow-on to #21600.  It adds a new `cythonize` command to the `setup.py`, and moves most of the logic for running `cythonize()` (previously in the customized `build_ext`) command, into this new command.

The new `cythonize` command is run always from `build_ext` anyways, but this has a couple advantages:

1) It is possible to run *just* `cythonize`, without compiling extension modules.  This maybe isn't that common, but can be useful for development, especially when testing issues with Cython itself.  It will also be useful for generating source distributions, where we might want to ship Cythonized sources in the source tarball, and hence would need to generate them as part of the process of building the tarball (without necessarily compiling).

This also allows passing options directly from the command-line to `cythonize`.  This isn't much taken advantage of currently but the possibility is there.

2) Code is clearer and more modular.  Specific details for compiling cython code are kept separate from details for compiling C/C++ code.

Regarding this:

```
    # TODO: This works for the C sources themselves, but this logic
    # should also apply to Cython sources--shouldn't the be rebuilt
    # if this file changes?  Alternatively, we could add more details

```

I implemented that dependency on `setup.py` for the C files only because Cythonization does not really depend on `setup.py`.

You are right that the `cythonize()` flags affect Cythonization, but that is why we have `.cython_version`. But it would indeed be better if `.cython_version` would be more auto-generated with the relevant arguments given to `cythonize()`.

I think that's a good idea. But that should be an independent ticket. I don't see the need for the "backwards compat for the old format" though.

Opened an upstream issue at https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/1514

A generic build_cython command could take most any `cythonize()` arguments as options.  A sage-specific wrapper around that would just be setting (or possibly enforcing) certain defaults.

> I'm not sure how I feel about that--it goes against the default for building extension modules which is that the `--debug` option is not on by default.

In practice, `--debug` is the default because Python compiles by default with `-g` (even twice!). The *default* gcc command line starts with

```
gcc -fno-strict-aliasing -g -O2 -DNDEBUG -g -fwrapv -O3 -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -fPIC
```

(Sage adds the `-Wno-unused` flag to this and removes `-Wstrict-prototypes`)

Adding the `--debug` option to distutils adds an *additional* `-g` but that doesn't change anything really.
