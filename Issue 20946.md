I'd `s/`_time consuming checks_`/`_time*-*consuming checks_`/` in `src/sage/schemes/projective/projective_point.py`.

I do not understand what you mean (something like search and replace ?).

Anyway, I would rather not use this ticket to do something else.

I meant replace "time consuming checks" by "time-consuming checks" (i.e., add a hyphen) in a line that you change anyway, namely the new line 117 in the file I mentioned.
