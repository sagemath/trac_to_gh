I would like to see some documentation as well as examples in the new _mul_trunc functions. Also, something like

sage: f = ...
sage: g = ...
sage: f*g
...
sage: f._mul_trunc(g, 2)
...

would be illustrative of what goes on as well as being a good test. 

The function as written will crash horribly if one does

sage: f._mul_trunc(2, 2)

it should probably be declared as

cpdef Polynomial_dense_modn_ntl_zz _mul_trunc(self, Polynomial_dense_modn_ntl_zz _right, long n)

Otherwise, the patch looks good. I am slightly concerned about performance degradation, but fixing this bug is more important.
