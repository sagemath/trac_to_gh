# Issue 14657: Broken urls in the reference manual

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/14861

Original creator: vdelecroix

Original creation time: 2013-07-06 12:28:31

Assignee: mvngu

Keywords: documentation, dead link, dead url

Several urls in the reference manual lead to non existing documents or website. This ticket aims to replace them.

From Harald Schilly: http://hep.itp.tuwien.ac.at/~kreuzer/CY/ is the good address for the one in geometry/lattice_polytope

here is a first step, for the easy ones.

remains one

Comment by vdelecroix created at 2013-07-08 19:50:06

Great job !

I guess the last one is a dead end as everything was moved into Sage but there is still http://arxiv.org/abs/0710.1835 which is much more reliable then a link to a web page.

ok, for the last one I removed the dead link, but added alink to the arxiv paper you wrote.

I rerun sphinx linkcheck and find some others.

There seems to be no hope for the last remaining three broken links. Possible choices are

- let the patch enter as it is   :-)
- remove the three broken links instead of keeping them
- let the patch be forgotten and rot  :-(

What do you think ?

I would prefer to clean all links. What do you think about writing an explicit **dead link** in the manual?

Comment by vdelecroix created at 2013-07-25 15:55:58

We should remove the modification on modular/arithgroup/arithgroup_perm which is taken care in #12949.

For the link for Kuen's surface in `parametric_plot3d`, there are lots of choices, for example http://virtualmathmuseum.org/Surface/kuen/kuen.html (or http://mathworld.wolfram.com/KuenSurface.html, if we want to link to Wolfram ;).

I think that the link for `graphs/generators/basic` should be http://www.orgnet.com/sna.html.

I don't know what to do about the link in `implicit_plot3d`, maybe just delete it altogether:

```diff
diff --git a/sage/plot/plot3d/implicit_plot3d.py b/sage/plot/plot3d/implicit_plot3d.py

         ...                   region=lambda x,y,z: x<=0.2 or y>=0.2 or z<=0.2).show(viewer='tachyon')

```

Unfortunately, I can't figure out who to credit for the plot, except that it might have been someone named "Summers"...

here is a patch for the remaining ones

I have chosen to remove the broken link in implicit_plot3d

Needs review !

For PARI, why refer to an *old* version of the manual? Use this instead:

```
http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/pub/pari/manuals/2.5.1/users.pdf
```

(the manuals haven't been updated for PARI version 2.5.4 which Sage uses)


---

Comment by chapoton created at 2013-07-29 12:10:43

ok, done, pari link has been updated

The HTML documentation doesn't build:

```

It doesn't take much searching to figure out that it's highly likely that [Kathryn Summers](http://www.ubalt.edu/cas/faculty/alphabetical-directory/kathryn-summers.cfm) is probably connected to it.  In fact, her research looks kind of interesting - how do people with 8th-grade reading skills (or below) navigate the text-heavy web?  

The [web archive](http://web.archive.org/web/20080529033738/http://iat.ubalt.edu/summers/math/platsol.htm) helps us more - apparently the originator of the graphic (not created in Sage, though) is [Douglas Summers-Stay](https://plus.google.com/116294795843827001984/posts).  Or at least that's where we found it.  It would be nice for us to acknowledge this somehow, and I feel like either it should be dealt with on this ticket _or_ that deletion should not take place here and a new ticket should be opened.

ok, I have added an attribution to Douglas Summers-Stay, and let the link go to the archived page.

As long as this applies correctly and looks fine, this seems good - I like the "attributed to" as it's not 100% certain any more who it really belongs to!

It pains me that `http://web.archive.org/web/20080529033738/http://iat.ubalt.edu/summers/math/platsol.htm` could be a valid link, but it works `:-P`

Hmmm.... I'm sorry to say so, but there is a big messy graph patch (#14980) that got reviewed a couple of days ago, which conflicts which your second patch. Could you please rebase this patch on top of it ?

I just checked all links, so once it apply I can promise it a quick `positive_review` `:-P`
