I guess the last one is a dead end as everything was moved into Sage but there is still http://arxiv.org/abs/0710.1835 which is much more reliable then a link to a web page.

There seems to be no hope for the last remaining three broken links. Possible choices are

- let the patch enter as it is   :-)
- remove the three broken links instead of keeping them
- let the patch be forgotten and rot  :-(

What do you think ?

For the link for Kuen's surface in `parametric_plot3d`, there are lots of choices, for example http://virtualmathmuseum.org/Surface/kuen/kuen.html (or http://mathworld.wolfram.com/KuenSurface.html, if we want to link to Wolfram ;).

I think that the link for `graphs/generators/basic` should be http://www.orgnet.com/sna.html.

I don't know what to do about the link in `implicit_plot3d`, maybe just delete it altogether:
