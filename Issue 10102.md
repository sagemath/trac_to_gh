# Issue 10102: Clean up gmp_globals

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: jdemeyer

Original creation time: 2010-10-08 18:50:05

Assignee: tba

The following files should be cleaned up:
 * c_lib/src/gmp_globals.c
 * c_lib/include/gmp_globals.h
 * sage/ext/gmp.pxi

We should check whether globals can be made local to a particular module.
