CC:  gaganskehon weigandt

Keywords: integral points


```
sage: E = EllipticCurve('2082a1')
sage: [P[0] for P in E.integral_points()]
[-11, -2, 4, 13]
```

but

```
sage: E.lift_x(507525709)
(507525709 : 11433453531221 : 1)
```

so we miss one point.  Note that this point is 13*P where P is the generator, and our code computes the bound to be 12.

John Cannon is sending me a complete list of integral points for all curves in the Cremona database, computed using Magma, using some recent enhancements.  Previously I had checked that Sage and Magma agreed to conductor 10000, so their enhancements must also fix bugs.

More data points:  with E=2082a1 and using the S_integral_points function, with S=[2] or S=[3] the coefficient bound used is 11, while with S=[2,3] it is 13 and the extra integral point is found!  Clearly, a priori, enlarging S should not ever reduce this bound, so something is wrong there.  This shows that both integral_points() and S_integral_points() need fixing.

Here is a list of curves and integral x-coordinates not found by Sage, as provided by John Cannon.  It is not necessarily complete, but is a minimal set of test cases for any patch fixing this.
