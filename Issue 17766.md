Okay, some comments after a quick look-over:

- I think you should implement a `toggle` map which swaps 2 vertical lines and 2 horizontal lines.
- You should make a parent class for all fully packed loops (on an `n x n` (m?) grid). The iterator could be a `TransitiveIdeal` generated by the toggles (or some other type of search using toggles), but perhaps there is a better way to do this. Also `FullyPackedLoop` then should be a subclass of `Element`.
- The `.. math::` should be `.. MATH::`.
- You need more docuemntation for the class `FullyPackedLoop`, and the first line should be something like `A fully packed loop.` (a sentence which does not say "class", "implement", or other similar things). Also, it would be good to have some more references.
- Perhaps the vertices could be `+` instead of `#`, or we set that as a `global_option` (this is something I could do if you want)?
- Remove the commented out lines.
- The `fpl.plot().description()` output could potentially be machine dependent, so it would be better to test the number of such elements.

I will possibly have more comments as I make a more detailed review. However it's looking quite good.

This is more a note for myself to look at in more detail, but I think contains some interesting followup ideas: http://www.lpthe.jussieu.fr/~pzinn/semi/steklov.pdf.

Something else to change would be to make `self._six_vertex_model` (add the underscore) and then access it via a method so the FPL class acts as immutable. I'm also not happy with comparing equality by the repr's. I think it would be better to compare the underlying 6 vertex models. Also you should consider implementing a `__ne__` method as well.

I also believe we should not merge this ticket without a corresponding parent class. The basic framework would be

```python
class FullyPackedLoops(Parent, UniqueRepresentation):
    def __init__(self, n):
        self._n = n
        Parent.__init__(self, category=FiniteEnumeratedSets())

    def __iter__(self):
        for X in SixVertexModel(self._n):
            yield self.element_class(self, X)

    Element = FullyPackedLoops
```

Something that could be used to construct a six-vertex configuration:

```
SVM = SixVertexModel(2)
SVM([[3,1],[5,3]])
```

So it would make this work:

```
sage: FPL = FullyPackedLoops(2)
sage: FPL([[3,1],[5,3]])
```

The coverage failure, I'm no so sure (FYI you can click on the patchbot info to see details). However the import modules failure is reflecting the fact that you are not lazily importing this new file (which is there in an effort to try and keep startup time down). So I would add this line instead of the straight import:

```
lazy_import('sage.combinat.fully_packed_loop', ['FullyPackedLoop', 'FullyPackedLoops'])
```


A couple of things about the ticket/code itself:

- `matrix and also extract the link pattern.::` either remove the period or put a space after it.
- You should not put examples/information for the user in the `__init__`, instead move it to the class level docstring (for `FullyPackedLoop`). The `__init__` still needs to have a doctest, and a good one is to typically create an element `X` and then do `TestSuite(X).run()`, but you already have this, so leave the `TESTS::` block.
- In `to_alternating_sign_matrix`, remove the blank line at the beginning of the docstring and start with `Return`.
- You don't need `:math:`x = y``, just ``x = y`` with the backticks is sufficient. If you want it similar to equation mode in latex, do

```
.. MATH::

    x = y
```

- The `EXAMPLES::` block in `plot` is indented one to many times.
- For notes, you might want to consider using the `.. NOTE::` block (in `link_pattern`).
- Period missing in `six_vertex_model` one-line sentence.
- I would make `_vertex_dictionary` a lazy attribute (grep for ``@`lazy_attribute`). FYI - This means it's created on-demand and acts like a regular attribute, so `self._vertex_dictionary[i]` works. Essentially it is cached, so the downside to this is that the dictionary gets kept alive as long as that FPL is, but I think each instance is not kept alive too long. It's up to you.
- Same for `_end_point_dictionary`. In a similar vein, I would remove the (public) attribute `end_points` and just use `_end_point_dictionary`.
- First line of `FullyPackedLoops` needs a period and an empty line of space.
- `cardinality` is missing a period at the end of the equation.
- Remove the commented out code in `_element_constructor_`.
- You need to provide a description of `link_pattern`.
- You should describe the bijection with ASMs somewhere, most likely in the `FullyPackedLoops` (resp. `FullyPackedLoop`) class and add `.. SEEALSO::` to that class in `FullyPackedLoop` (resp. `FullyPackedLoops`) and `to_fully_packed_loop`.
- The documentation at the top of the file is good, but you can't read it interactively (only on the online/compiled documentation). I would suggest moving it to either `FullyPackedLoops` or `FullyPackedLoop`, depending on which you think is the more common entry point.
- I think the variable name of `current` in `_get_coordinates` is confusing and you should rename it to something more descriptive.

Looking very good overall, as almost all of these are trivial to minor tweaks. That's all for now.

In regard to the `:math:`...`` comment, I would make this change:

```
     def plot(self):

         Return a graphical object of the Fully Packed Loop
 
         EXAMPLES:

```

There is also a `[TODO]` that you added that needs to be either removed, expanded (and put in a `.. TODO::` block), or done. Thanks.
