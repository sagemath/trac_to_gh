Seems like the Cygwin buildbot is in slightly better shape than I thought?  It is *building* successfully, but then when it gets to running the doctests, it bizarrely exits with error code 1 immediately:

http://build.sagemath.org/#/builders/37/builds/15/steps/8/logs/stdio

This despite being perfectly able to run the tests manually.  When run from buildbot it just fails immediately.

It's ok, it's probably fine.  Turns out the Cygwin buildbot has at least been doing *builds* just not running the tests.  Which is not to say something couldn't have still broken with this, but at least we know it builds.  I think Volker just isn't checking that buildbot since it still isn't stable.

I'm going to test this locally ASAP but I don't think it's likely to cause any headaches.
