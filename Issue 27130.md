Adding keyword "upgrade" so the release manager knows to upload the tarball.

Changing keywords from "" to "upgrade, mpfrcx".

I tested this a bit with `SAGE_CHECK=yes`, looks good.
(tested on OSX 10.13 with clang, on Ubuntus, on Fedora...)

LGTM. May the buildbots smile upon you. `:P`

I would really like to get the Cygwin buildbot working again but I'll never get there if we keep merging package upgrades without giving me an opportunity to test them...

tell me how to set up a Windows buildbot. I tried using GCE running Windows, but it's just hopeless...

We already have one, but it was previously broken due to something (probably openblas) causing the docbuild to hang, and it's just never been working since then: http://build.sagemath.org/#/builders/37

Seems like the Cygwin buildbot is in slightly better shape than I thought?  It is _building_ successfully, but then when it gets to running the doctests, it bizarrely exits with error code 1 immediately:

http://build.sagemath.org/#/builders/37/builds/15/steps/8/logs/stdio

This despite being perfectly able to run the tests manually.  When run from buildbot it just fails immediately.

a usual Cygwin/PTY related headache? Random googling only finds netbeans-related stuff, and I don't even know what netbeans is. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27284742/unable-to-start-pty-process

Sorry Eric, I thought that buildbot was there to catch when upgrades like this break things.

It's ok, it's probably fine.  Turns out the Cygwin buildbot has at least been doing _builds_ just not running the tests.  Which is not to say something couldn't have still broken with this, but at least we know it builds.  I think Volker just isn't checking that buildbot since it still isn't stable.

I'm going to test this locally ASAP but I don't think it's likely to cause any headaches.
