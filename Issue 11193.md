Applied patch, did 'sage -b', then './sage -docbuild reference html',
and verified that the patch correctly formated the tests and examples of the functions 'complements()', 'cover_relations()', and 'cover_relations_iterator()'.  Positive review.

Hi Minh,

Thanks for the improvements!

Luckily, it seems like this will commute smoothly with #10998. So I leave the positive review. But please synchronise with us next time!

Cheers,
