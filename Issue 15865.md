Code for studying lyapunov exponents of translation surfaces and their covers.

TODO:
  * See compatibility with other existing code for interval echanges and strata
  * It seems to work in most of the examples, 
   there is a bug for zero lyapunov exponents when decomposing in isotropic components :



```
sage: R = intex.cyclic_cover_iet(4, [1, 1, 1, 1])
sage: R.lyapunov_exponents_H_plus()
[0.9996553085103, 0.0007776980910571506, 0.00022201024035355403]
sage: R.lyapunov_exponents_H_plus_isotopic()
[[], [1.0002381322489762], [-0.09753642448496574], [-0.09750440918016302]]

```

Hi Charles,

Here are some remarks.

About syntax:

- remove trailing whitespaces
- documentation lines should be at most 80 characters long
- all functions and methods must have an EXAMPLES block. In order 
  to see how much work you have to do, you can use 
  `sage -coverage MY_FILE`.
- The block RETURN should be OUTPUT

General design:

- It would be more coherent to have an object "covering of stratum".
  In a concrete way it would be a permutation of interval exchange
  (that may be considered as a marking) together with a covering data.
  We do not care that much about a concrete interval exchange in your code.
- avoid using import from `sage.all`, to know from which module you need
  to import an object you can use `import_statements(MY_OBJECT)`. For more
  info look at `import_statements?`.
  

About code:

- there are already several things in Sage for interval exchange
  transformations and strata. It would be simpler to use them.
- you must put a comment about `precision = 128` and
  `diff_sum_seuil = 2**(-precision+20)`. Even better, remove them.
- in order to fit nicely with other components of Sage, you should
  separate the code (like your class `IntExchange`) and the examples
  (like the functions `EKZ_example`).

I updated the code which integrate the computation of lyapunov exponents for quadratic strata.
You can now use the function :


```
stratum_component = QuadraticStratum([1]*8 + [-1]*4).components()[0]
stratum_component.orientable_cover().lyapunov_exponents_H_plus()
```



I noticed a strange behaviour while doing some computeur simulations for asymptotic of lyapunov exponents. When genus is getting bigger (and consequently the number of intervals), the speed is decreasing. While increasing the number of iteration, log(t)/n is also increasing. A surprising behaviour (possibly due to float approximation) is that the there is a limit value for this function for a large value of genus.

This behaviour seems to be responsible for a wrong approximation of lyapunov exponents asymptotically:

I guess that we should close this ticket with mileston "wontfix" as I did with the other tickets #14683, #16159, #16170, #16169. This means that the ticket would be closed without integrating the branch into Sage.

Vincent, do you confirm this should be closed as invalid ?


---

Comment by vdelecroix created at 2016-07-11 16:03:49

Yes! Charles' code is now part of the package `surface_dynamics` (see #20695).

Determined to be invalid/duplicate/wontfix (closing as "wontfix" as a catch-all resolution).

Resolution: wontfix
