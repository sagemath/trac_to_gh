With these fixes, plus various fixes in other modules (to be submitted separately) I was able to get all the tests in `sage.misc.cachefunc` to pass.

As an aside, I noticed that the argument `classmethod` to `CachedFunction` is an unfortunate misnomer.  I wonder if we couldn't do something about that (separately); maybe rename it just `method` or `ismethod` and deprecate the old name...

Is that a problem? It's not that uncommon to have keyword arguments which are also builtin functions.

As another aside, functions like `keys()` would better use `yield` instead of returning lists. I'm not saying that you must fix this though...

Is there any particular reason that you use

```
for k in list(self):
```

instead of

```
for k in self:
```

The problem is that the argument refers simply to normal methods, not to `classmethod` as in the Python built-in.

I agree--I could fix that while I'm updating this code anyways.

So what is the plan here? I'd like you to fix [comment:4] as a minimum (or explain why the `list()` is a good idea).

The `list()` is just force of habit from working with actual `dict`s.  Obviously in this case it's not necessary.  If the `keys()` method is turned into a generator then it makes sense.

I removed the list. Otherwise looks good to me. Jeroen, do you approve ?
