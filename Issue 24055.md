As an aside, I noticed that the argument `classmethod` to `CachedFunction` is an unfortunate misnomer.  I wonder if we couldn't do something about that (separately); maybe rename it just `method` or `ismethod` and deprecate the old name...

Is that a problem? It's not that uncommon to have keyword arguments which are also builtin functions.

The problem is that the argument refers simply to normal methods, not to `classmethod` as in the Python built-in.
