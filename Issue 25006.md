sage: P.<x,y> = ProjectiveSpace(K, 1)
sage: f = DynamicalSystem([x^3 + v*x*y^2, y^3])
sage: fbar = f.change_ring(QQbar)

Fixed merge conflict with master, manually implemented the same code changes, and removed changes to deprecated code. Also have another test case:


```
K.<a>=QuadraticField(-1)
P.<x,y>=ProjectiveSpace(K,1)
f=DynamicalSystem([x^4 + (-1+2*a)*x*y^3,y^4], domain=P)

The following changed line's purpose is unclear to us. When we removed it, and changed the variable names, it seemed to still work well without it:

```
L = K.change_names('a')
```


Is this line still necessary?
