# Issue 25006: is postcritically finite failure for extensions

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/25243

Original creator: bhutz

Original creation time: 2018-04-24 14:27:26

When the field extension needs to be extended there can be a conflict of variable names


```
sage: K.<v> = QuadraticField(-7)
sage: P.<x,y> = ProjectiveSpace(K, 1)
sage: f = DynamicalSystem([x^3 + v*x*y^2, y^3])
sage: fbar = f.change_ring(QQbar)
sage: fbar.is_postcritically_finite()
```

Fixed merge conflict with master, manually implemented the same code changes, and removed changes to deprecated code. Also have another test case:


```
K.<a>=QuadraticField(-1)
P.<x,y>=ProjectiveSpace(K,1)
f=DynamicalSystem([x^4 + (-1+2*a)*x*y^3,y^4], domain=P)
f.is_postcritically_finite()
```

Changing keywords from "" to "SI2019".

The following changed line's purpose is unclear to us. When we removed it, and changed the variable names, it seemed to still work well without it:

```
L = K.change_names('a')
```


Is this line still necessary?

It had been necessary, unless extension/compositums do their own name collision resolution now, leaving the default names was regularly causing name conflict, so that tweak avoided that collision.

Did a little testing. It seems to no longer be an issue. I wasn't able to get an example that fails. Give this branch a try.
