# Issue 14721: Implement pseudo-Conway polynomials

Issue created by migration from Trac.

This patch implements pseudo-Conway polynomials, which will be used later to enable coercion between finite fields.  This has been split off from #8335, and will be a dependency of that ticket.

The attached patch passes most doctests, but not all, and has to be cleaned up a bit.

I rebased and updated the code written by David Roe and Jean-Pierre Flori.

One important question before me or someone else reviews this: why does this patch introduce objects that are called pseudo-Conway polynomial *_trees*_?  This strongly suggests that the system of compatible finite fields that it represents forms a tree, which is definitely NOT the case.  This is the whole reason why all of this work needs to be done to get such a system of finite fields!

The last patch still needed some cleaning up; here is a new one.

Reasons for status change to needs_info:

- the 'tree' terminology (see http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/14958#comment:6); I think that `PseudoConwayPolyTree` should be changed to `PseudoConwayLattice` or something similar.

- during Sage Days 51, Jenny Cooley found a paper claiming that there is a mistake in one of the algorithms in the article of Heath and Loehr cited in the code.  We should check that the error is not in this patch.

I agree.
I also don't really feel satisfied with the way all these polynomials are stored right now, but I'm not sure I'll come up with anything quickly.

I think it's fixed in David's implementation.
That's what got me confused at http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/8335#comment:55 because I thought the addition David made were not needed, and then i realized they were: http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/8335#comment:57.

I'd say David used the term tree because a PCPT objecgt only contains one layer of references, i.e. a pseudo-conway poly and refs to the PCPTs for n/q where q is a prime divisor of n.

Some minor remarks:
* I think we should add a warning that PCPTs are only weakrefed. I saw that you correctly took care of that in #8335, thanks for that.
* At some point the new doc says "The following demonstrate coercions", shouldn't it be "demonstrates"? (please pardon me if I'm wrong, I'm no english expert).
* The doc changes corresponding to the fix mentionned in http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/8335#comment:59 are missing; it should not read:

```
            If False, then `n` is prime and 
            no references are stored (since there is no compatibility 
            condition).
```

  but:
  {{{
            If ``False``, then `n == 1` and no references are stored 
            (since there is no compatiblity condition).
  }}}

The last patch renames some classes, methods and functions.

It also fixes doctests and documentation.


```
Patchbot, apply:
* trac_14958-pseudo_conway.patch
* trac_14958-rename-doctests.patch
```

These changes all look good to me.

Actually, I realised that we never call `irreducible_element(n, algorithm='pseudo-conway')` in #8335, so it is not even necessary to allow this parameter.  In fact, it may cause confusion, since creating a single pseudo-Conway polynomial really only makes sense in the context of a lattice.  Without that, a pseudo-Conway polynomial is nothing more than a primitive polynomial!

I confess that I never got around to learning what exactly `weakref` does, until now.  I just read the relevant parts of [http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0205/](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0205/) and see why we may have to be careful.  I think this question is mostly relevant to #8335, so let's not move that discussion here; let me just say for now that I agree that `weakref` does not appear to be the ideal solution to our caching problem.

While working on #14990, it occurred to me that this patch could be simplified substantially.  I am attaching a new version that gives an extremely intuitive interface to pseudo-Conway lattices:

```
class PseudoConwayLattice(SageObject)
    def __init__(self, p, use_database=True)
    def polynomial(self, n)
```

This is morally equivalent to a construction of an algebraic closure of *F*<sub>_p_</sub> with a method that returns the unique subfield of degree _n_.

The method `get_pseudo_conway_polynomial()` is now simply called `polynomial()`.  The functions `find_pseudo_conway_polynomial_tree()` and `compute_pseudo_conway_polynomial()` have been dissolved into `__init__()` and `polynomial()`.  The global variables to implement caching are gone.

Now we've departed from the idea of implementing what should be provided by the algebraic closure constructions, the new patch is fine for me.
