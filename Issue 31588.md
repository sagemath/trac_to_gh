I don't know why its important that sage_conf version is 'none', but it sometimes fails with the actual version number after doing some incremental builds:

```
sage -t --long --warn-long 46.6 --random-seed=0 src/sage/misc/package.py
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/misc/package.py", line 359, in sage.misc.package.installed_packages
Failed example:
    installed_packages()['sage_conf']  # optional - build
Expected:
    'none'
Got:
    '9.3'
**********************************************************************
