`type` is missing, and probably you should add `surface_dynamics` from #31224 also in `dependencies` to avoid race conditions on installation

`surface_dynamics` is a runtime dependency. No need at install.

Replying to [comment:3 vdelecroix]:

Note that by listing it in `requirements.txt`, it will be installed

Note that it is both in `dependencies` and `requirements.txt`. Is it how it should be?

The one in `requirements.txt` is redundant because the Sage package dependencies already make sure that `surface_dynamics` is installed first.

Ok let me remove it from there then.

Could you put the title in SPKG.rst to the new format that includes a 1-line description?

Also it would probably be helpful to expand the description a tiny bit
