This will help once OpenSSL 3.0.0 is released under the new license.

Python 2.7.16 was released 2019-03-04, and the page for that release:

    https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2716/ 

has the following note about OpenSSL: 

> Attention macOS users: As of 2.7.16, all current python.org macOS installers 
> ship with builtin copies of OpenSSL and !Tcl/Tk 8.6. 
> See the installer README for more information. 

If Python does it, can we also ship OpenSSL with our macOS binaries?
