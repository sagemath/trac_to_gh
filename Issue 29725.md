Keywords: doctests, random

We introduce an option for doctests `--random_seed` that defaults to `0` for now:

```
sage -t --long src/sage/all.py 
...
Doctesting 1 file.
sage -t --long --random_seed=0 src/sage/all.py
    [16 tests, 0.73 s]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Total time for all tests: 0.8 seconds
    cpu time: 0.7 seconds
    cumulative wall time: 0.7 seconds
```

This allows specifying, which random seed shall be used for the doctests.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29962

The `random_seed` docstring says seed "must be coercible to a Python long".

Is that from `-2**127` to `2**127 - 1`?
Or are 32-bit and 64-bit systems different there?

Also isn't "long" a Python 2 concept,
with only "int" existing in Python 3?

Could we document the admissible range in a follow-up ticket, for non-experts like me?

I added this issue to #29935.

The idea was that once all parts of Sage are ready for it, the default would be to select a "random" random seed.
