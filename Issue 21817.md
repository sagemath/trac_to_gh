# Issue 21817: Use dynamic classes for p-adic parents

Issue created by migration from Trac.

The files `sage/rings/padics/generic_nodes.py` and `sage/rings/padics/base_leaves.py` were created before dynamic classes existed in Sage.  They should clearly be rewritten to use the "new" functionality: the current approach is both difficult to understand and not scalable.
