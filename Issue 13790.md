Hello,

maybe you could 

* add a reference for the definition
* explain the meaning of the word EL

I am fine with your changes (though I do never understand why some editors introduce line breaks after 80 cols, while I would prefer that anyone can decide him-/herself where to break the lines in his/her editor).

Thanks for the review!
