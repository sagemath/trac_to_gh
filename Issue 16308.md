CC:  stefan rudi

Keywords: binary matroid, minor

Use pattern matching inspired by Hliněný's MACEK to test if a binary matroid 
has another binary matroid as a minor. Given a binary matroid, for each basis 
one can produce a matrix representation. We then look for a deletion set, a contraction set and a row-column permutation that yields a submatrix same as the representation of the given minor to be tested.
