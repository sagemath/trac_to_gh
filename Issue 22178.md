# Issue 22178: Add operator class membership tests for matrices

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/22415

There are a few sets of operators defined on cones that we can generate. If `K` is a polyhedral cone, then there's

  * K.positive_operators_gens()
  * K.cross_positive_operators_gens
  * K.Z_operators_gens()
  * K.lyapunov_like_basis()

Those sets are themselves polyhedral closed convex cones, and in the last case, a vector space.

Given a matrix `L`, it is natural to ask: does `L` belong to one of those sets with respect to a given `K`?

This currently does not merge; I would be willing to review this after that's addressed.

The merge was trivial, so I took the liberty of performing it. Everything looks good to me!
