Ticket #7485 removes Linux Fortran binaries, so as of Sage 4.3.1 only Fortran binaries for Mac OS X are shipped with Sage. Ticket #7484 updates the README.txt to require Fortran as a pre-requisite for compiling Sage on Linux. Another likely candidate for documentation update is the [Installation Guide](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/installation). Let's update that guide.
