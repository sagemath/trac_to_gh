# Issue 13116: Polyhedron plot absorbs point3d elements incorrectly when summed

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/13288

Assignee: jason, was

This plots fine.

```
Z = Polyhedron([[2,3,3],[3,0,3],[2,6,1],[1,0,1],[6,7,2]])
z = Z.plot()
z
```

Now try adding a point.

```
z+point3d((0,0,0),size=30,color='red')
```

This looks fine too.

```
z
```

And now we've added a point to the polyhedron!

This was originally noticed at [this ask.sagemath.org question](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/1628/3d-graphics-bug) inside an interact, where, as one might imagine, it would be particularly annoying.

I think this is probably nothing more than a manifestation of #9089

Changing type from PLEASE CHANGE to defect.

Hmm, I bet you're right.  How about you update the patch there and we find out ;-)

No problem with the red point in 7.4.beta0, though plotting the polyhedron is broken with the Java-based jmol (#20978).

Determined to be invalid/duplicate/wontfix (closing as "wontfix" as a catch-all resolution).
