Keywords: continued fraction, rounding

Rounding with `RNDD` and `RNDZ` with 17 bits of precision doesn't work for the continued fraction of `1761/1024`:


```
sage: fields = []
sage: for rnd in ['RNDD', 'RNDZ']:
....:     fields.append(RealField(prec=17, rnd=rnd))
sage: a = 1761/1024  
sage: cf = continued_fraction(a)
sage: for R in fields:
....:     if R(cf) == R(a):
....:         print('this worked')
```


This contradicts a doctest in `src/sage/rings/continued_fraction.py` which claims pretty much that this always works (running a loop on 3000 random values with assertion error; but the values where never really random).
