I was trying the integral in #11590 with fricas, and it did not work. The existing conversion of the symbolic sign function is "sign", which cannot handle symbolic arguments.

But then apparently, Fricas cannot integrate functions containing abs.

Yes, that's correct (as far as I know).

So, do you think it makes sense to convert sign to ```x/abs(x)```?  (I don't)

Well, at least by converting to `abs(x)/x` (I prefer this way, and did that), one can go to fricas and back to sage without error. Why do you think that it's not a good idea ?

Here is a trival test, do you want to add it?

```
sage: fricas(sign(x)).eval(x=-3)
- 1
```


Other than that, it looks good.  There is currently a giac failure, which I cannot say anything about.
