Keywords: iterator, skew tableaux

The iterator for

```
class SemistandardSkewTableaux_shape
```

runs over all weights in

```
IntegerVectors(self.p.size(), self.p.size())
```

which seems rather arbitrary. To conform with the iterator in the analogous class

```
class SemistandardTableaux_shape
```

we will allow for an additional entry `max_entry`.

Some changes committed. Do you think I should also make `max_entry` play nice when it's the only variable? (At the moment, the iterator of `SemistandardSkewTableaux()` iterates over all skew tableaux with max entry = their size. I think this is far less useful than iterating over all skew tableaux with max entry given.) Also, the containment tests on these classes are broken.

The best for now is probably to do the same as what is done in Tableaux.

Gave `SemistandardSkewTableaux(max_entry=m)` a reasonable iterator, since the analogous thing for Tableaux works.

I kinda hesitate to give this ticket a positive review now that I've done a lot of changes and hell knows whether they're all correct...
