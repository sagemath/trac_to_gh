In `src/sage/modules/vector_double_dense.pyx` there is a lot of code like

```
        global numpy
        if numpy is None:
            import numpy
```


However, since the whole module is not imported at startup, we might as well just put a global

```
cimport numpy
```

and be done with it.

Looks good to me. Note that cimporting numpy will (indirectly) import it anyway to get the numpy.ndarray type. 

I am curious about the commend that the numpy method must be last... do you have a minimal example for that bug?

```
cimport numpy
cdef class numpy_test:
    def numpy(self):
        pass
    cdef foo(self, numpy.dtype dtype):
        pass
```

gives

```

Is this a bug?
