See [this sage-support thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/sage-support/6JmdIz9AvJM), where William points out

```
sage: from decimal import Decimal as RealNumber 
sage: 0.2 + 0.1 == 0.3 
True 
sage: sin(0.2) 
... 
TypeError: cannot coerce arguments: no canonical coercion from <class 
'decimal.Decimal'> to Symbolic Ring 
```

This ticket would be to make that work somehow; presumably one would have to decide what the right answer is.
