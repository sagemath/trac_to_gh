We fix other issues noted on #19473:

- Mutability of `table`.
- Category of `FiniteDimensionalAlgebra` should be `MagmaticAlgebras`.
- Make `FiniteDimensionalAlgebra` a subclass of `UniqueRepresentation`.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/19507

It is encouraged that concrete parents be a subclass of `UniqueRepresentation`, it gives us default `__hash__`, `__eq__` (which actually, I think I just broke by not removing the `__eq__` and I will fix shortly), and pickling, and it helps in standardizing the input.

> Travis: if you are OK with my changes, please set to positive_review. And sorry for the delay in about everything I'm doing.

This isn't quite right:

```
- ``category`` -- (default:
  ``MagmaticAlgebras(k).FiniteDimensional().WithBasis()``
  when ``assume_associative`` is ``False``, else
  ``Algebras(k).FiniteDimensional().WithBasis()``)
```

as the latter category also has the unital assumption and is not what the code uses. I will tweak this when I fix the hash issue noted above.

Ouch; I should have thought of the unitality. Thanks for catching that.

as it separates out the second phrase from the first part of the sentence. I would prefer to revert this change, perhaps also changing the `as` to a `to`. Otherwise LGTM.

Feel free to change this, but the previous wording did not make grammatical sense. I think the best option is adding an OUTPUT block to clarify this; we are trying to stuff too much into a single sentence.
