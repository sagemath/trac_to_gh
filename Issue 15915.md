Unfortunately there are other issues with PPL and latest MPIR from #15015.
This issue is independent though.

Did you open an upstream bug? IMHO this should go upstream...

Nope...
I reported on Cygwin ml but that was a long time ago.

Which was surely the right thing to do as PPL actually tests that weak symbols are supported but in fact they are broken.
I guess the real problem is just the way the import lib is generated on Cygwin64.

Changing status from needs_review to positive_review.

This compiled for me on both cygwin 32 and 64. So positive review (all I did was a trivial rebase).

Forgot that git resets back to `needs_review`.

`@`jpflori you beat me by 1 second. :P

Weirdly, though I don't even remember doing so, apparently I submitted an upstream bug report about this, and the fix has now been accepted.
