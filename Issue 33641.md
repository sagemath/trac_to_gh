# Issue 33641: Upgrade cypari (and possibly cysignals)

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/33878

Original creator: @kliem

CC:  vdelecroix dimpase

This is needed for #33842, but the new release of cypari (and possibly cysignals) might also make
- cypari thread safe
- cypari compatible with current pari version
- remove optional build time dependency of cysignals on pari

Is there any reason you are using snapshots from your fork of `cypari2`? Or is it just for testing and development?

Just for testing and development. My own [GitHub](GitHub) account is lots faster with the [GitHub](GitHub) actions than sagemath. Also I use this trac ticket for cysignal's CI. Once cypari and possibly cysignal are ready, we switch back to the official sources.

Sorry about that. I messed up with the tags. I'm rather confident the fix is working, it's just that the fix is not contained in the tag I created.

The new commit contains the recent changes.

The test release contains basically the following:
- https://github.com/sagemath/cypari2/pull/103 (requires cython 0.29.20, which videlec does not like: https://github.com/sagemath/cypari2/pull/103#issuecomment-1133564219;

  an alternative approach without raised cython requirement could be https://github.com/sagemath/cypari2/pull/115)
- https://github.com/sagemath/cypari2/pull/109 (videlec doesn't like this approach much and rather wants `cypari2` to push to some signal handling stack of cysignals)
- https://github.com/sagemath/cypari2/pull/116 (doesn't work for python 3.6 yet).

Regarding the ticket description: to make pari threadsafe, the only way I explored so far was to use a "thread pool executor", see https://github.com/sagemath/cypari2/pull/116. Because of its stack management, pari needs some care when used within threads.

I don't remember the details about this, but there is also a separate related ticket: #28800
