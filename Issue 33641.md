CC:  vdelecroix dimpase

This is needed for #33842, but the new release of cypari (and possibly cysignals) might also make
- cypari thread safe
- cypari compatible with current pari version
- remove optional build time dependency of cysignals on pari

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/33878

Is there any reason you are using snapshots from your fork of `cypari2`? Or is it just for testing and development?

Just for testing and development. My own [GitHub](GitHub) account is lots faster with the [GitHub](GitHub) actions than sagemath. Also I use this trac ticket for cysignal's CI. Once cypari and possibly cysignal are ready, we switch back to the official sources.

The new commit contains the recent changes.

The test release contains basically the following:
- https://github.com/sagemath/cypari2/pull/103 (requires cython 0.29.20, which videlec does not like: https://github.com/sagemath/cypari2/pull/103#issuecomment-1133564219;

  an alternative approach without raised cython requirement could be https://github.com/sagemath/cypari2/pull/115)
- https://github.com/sagemath/cypari2/pull/109 (videlec doesn't like this approach much and rather wants `cypari2` to push to some signal handling stack of cysignals)
- https://github.com/sagemath/cypari2/pull/116 (doesn't work for python 3.6 yet).

Regarding the ticket description: to make pari threadsafe, the only way I explored so far was to use a "thread pool executor", see https://github.com/sagemath/cypari2/pull/116. Because of its stack management, pari needs some care when used within threads.
