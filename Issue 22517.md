# Issue 22517: order and chain polytopes are defined over ZZ

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Keywords: polytope

Currently, order_polytope and chain_polytope of posets return polytopes over QQ. They can be enhanced to return polytopes over ZZ.

This allows to compute their Ehrhart polynomial, for example.

There is only one thing: the polyhedron are given with the `H`-representation... but indeed, the vertices are integers in the end...

So I guess it is good to go...
