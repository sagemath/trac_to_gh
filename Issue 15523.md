# Issue 15523: Speed up short vector enumeration

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/15760

Original creator: jdemeyer

CC:  mraum pbruin

The `short_vector_list_up_to_length` method of quadratic forms uses GP but the interface is so badly done that essentially all time is taken up by the Sage interface, and not by the actual computation.
