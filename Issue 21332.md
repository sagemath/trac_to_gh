CC:  was vbraun jdemeyer embray fbissey leif thansen saraedum dimpase isuruf chapoton

Currently the scripts in `src/bin` are installed by `build/make/Makefile`.

As part of #21507, for those scripts that should be considered part of `sagelib`, the installation should be done by `src/setup.py` instead, using the [scripts and console-scripts](http://python-packaging.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command-line-scripts.html) features.

(Those scripts that don't belong into `src/bin` are moved to `build/bin` by #21559.)

Normally this shouldn't be dependent on those tickets, and I can't think of any reason it would be. But I've come not to expect normalcy with sage.

In #22731 comment 28, it is proposed to move scripts to `$SAGE_LOCAL/libexec`.
Could a setuptools expert comment whether `setup.sh` would be able to do this, or can it only install into `bin` (via the `scripts` and `console_scripts` features)?
