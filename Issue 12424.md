try typing `elliptic_pi?`, the documentation gives you absolutely no clue as to which argument corresponds to `phi`, `n`, or `m`.

This was reported on [the public bug reports from the notebook interface](https://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=pCwvGVwSMxTzT6E2xNdo5fA) by <willy`@`willyshop.com> on 2/13/2012.
