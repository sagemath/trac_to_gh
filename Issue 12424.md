# Issue 12424: poor documentation of elliptic_pi

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: dkrenn

Original creation time: 2012-02-26 19:42:31

Assignee: mvngu

Keywords: documentation

try typing `elliptic_pi?`, the documentation gives you absolutely no clue as to which argument corresponds to `phi`, `n`, or `m`.

This was reported on [the public bug reports from the notebook interface](https://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=pCwvGVwSMxTzT6E2xNdo5fA) by <willy`@`willyshop.com> on 2/13/2012.

This is more or less true for all of those.  We could do a better job of making these symbolic as well.

Good idea.  A few minor things. 
* Trivial typo of definition
 * Needs to escape the underscore in the `elliptic_pi` since otherwise there are horrible `LaTeX` warnings.
 * I'm not sure how we should deal with the `\phi` as a variable, since of course variables don't start with slashes, but in the formula it would need one.  Maybe just `phi`?   I'm not sure what's ideal.
 * Just having a reference for all of these many things would be nice, but at least on this ticket, since Wikipedia's defn. is a little different and I'm too lazy to look it up in a real reference

Thanks for looking at it, Karl-Dieter. I think I've fixed the issues you pointed out. I agree, references are good. [AS] section 17.7 follows a slightly different convention with the parameters than Maxima, but the Maxima docs refer to it and point out the difference in notation. I've changed the variable "phi" to "t" to eliminate inconsistency between "\phi" and "phi".

That's a problem with the previous patch. Sorry, I forgot to update the ticket description to indicate the new patch. It's changed now.

The formatting of the documentation is good now and the result looks good.
