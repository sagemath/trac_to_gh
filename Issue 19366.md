CC:  novoselt

The `quotient` method of toric lattices accepts a sublattice and should check that the argument is in fact a sublattice. According to the documentation,

```
   INPUT:

   * "sub" -- sublattice of self;

   * "check" -- (default: True) whether or not to check that "sub"
     is a valid sublattice.
```


However, it is possible to take the quotient of a lattice `N` with a sublattice of `M` that is not compatible:


```
sage: K = Cone([(1,0,0),(0,1,0)])
sage: K.lattice()
3-d lattice N
sage: K.orthogonal_sublattice()
Sublattice <M(0, 0, 1)>
sage: K.lattice().quotient(K.orthogonal_sublattice())
2-d lattice, quotient of 3-d lattice N by Free module of degree 3 and rank 1 over Integer Ring
Echelon basis matrix:
[0 0 1]
```


This should raise an error instead.

I added some tests/examples to the `quotient` method but noticed something strange when I went to do the same for the `ToricLattice_quotient` class. The code in the class calls `submodule()` which is where the error is expected to occur:


```
if check:
    try:
        W = V.submodule(W)
    except (TypeError, ArithmeticError):
        raise ArithmeticError("W must be a sublattice of V")
```


But the `submodule()` method isn't throwing one of those two errors -- it's throwing a `ValueError`. The result is that the user sees the exception thrown from `submodule()` and not the (nicer) error from the quotient class:


```
sage: from sage.geometry.toric_lattice import ToricLattice_quotient
sage: N = ToricLattice(3)
sage: M = ToricLattice(3, name='M')
sage: ToricLattice_quotient(N,M)
...
ValueError: M(1, 0, 0) can not generate a sublattice of 3-d lattice N
```


For the wishlist, it might help to report something other than the variable names in the `ToricLattice_quotient` error message. So instead of,


```
ArithmeticError: W must be a sublattice of V
```


it could be,


```
ArithmeticError: 3-d lattice M must be a sublattice of 3-d lattice N
```


but I realize that's hard to do if the user passes in weirder objects. We could get part of the way there by checking that `V` is in fact a lattice before doing the `submodule()` check. That way `V` will print nicely, and even if the user passes in something stupid it would read alright:


```
ArithmeticError: Petersen graph: Graph on 10 vertices is not a sublattice of 3-d lattice N
```

In general it is a bit discouraged to include bad arguments into error messages because the code may be catching exceptions do deal with them, but formatting detailed error messages takes time (although we have some lazy strings, if I recall correctly).

These particular classes are derived from general free modules and then I tried to do the minimum possible changes to get custom output and handle different/dual lattices. It is probably a waste of effort to perfect one particular aspect of them instead of thinking of improving the overall design first ;-) So I am in favour of merging things as they are now (together with your commits) since it is an improvement.

That's OK, I didn't have my hopes up for the error message.

My other concern was basically that this branch looked unreachable,


```
try:
    W = V.submodule(W)
except (TypeError, ArithmeticError):
    raise ArithmeticError("W must be a sublattice of V")
```


because the error that gets thrown in `submodule()` is a `ValueError`. But I see that I was wrong, and I added the doctest once I figured out how to cause that `ArithmeticError`.

Positive review otherwise.
