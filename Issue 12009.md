It appears it is stuck in /local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sage/sandpiles/sandpile.pyc at

   4904             for j in range(i):
-> 4905                 if p > random():

This is the same behavior as 

```
random_DAG(5, 0)
```


It appears p=1/2 from the definition of random_DAG is evaluated to 0 (so there are no possible connections), hence p = 0.5 should fix it.

Hello,

The patch needs further improvements.

1) The test on p should be improved since I can give p=2 without error. For instance,

```
if p < 0 or p > 1:
   raise ValueError('The parameter p must be in [0..1].')
```


2) A test is needed for parameter weight_max:

```
sage: random_DAG(5, .5, -1)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)
...
...
ValueError: empty range for randrange() (1,0, -1)
```

and

```
sage: random_DAG(5, .5, .5)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)
...
...
ValueError: non-integer stop for randrange()
```


3) It should be clearly indicated in the documentation that the function returns a dictionary storing the edges of the DAG.

4) The resulting number of vertices is not n but n+1:

```
sage: d = DiGraph(random_DAG(5, .5))
sage: d
Digraph on 6 vertices
```


5) I don't understand why this digraph generator is not part of ```sage.graphs.digraph_generators.py```. The function could have an optional parameter to return a dictionary instead of a digraph if relevant.

Yes, indeed. Well, this seems to be a reasonable way to ensure that the input is of correct type, as specified in the documentation. The problem is that one should accept both **int** and **Integers** as third argument. This is the case with what I have written, which tries to coerce to Integers.

Well, a dictionary of dictionaries is a dictionary, isn't it ? And by the way, I have not found any place in the sources of Sage where this procedure is used.


> - I'm unable to build/find the documentation. Are you able to build it?

Sorry, I do not understand this remark. I have only tried the doc in a terminal. Should I try it in the notebook too ? Should I do something else ? Could you pinpoint a specific problem ?


> - I agree that moving this function into digraphs_generator could be done as part of another patch. It should in particular have an optional argument allowing to have multiple sinks (and so avoiding the while loop). With current setting, I'm not sure that the average number of arcs is ``p*n``.

Well, this ticket is here to solve a specific problem, and the rest can be postponed to some other ticket.

There is now a mismatch between doc and tests : should we allow p to be equal to 1 or not ?

That's right, you should change the test to

```
assert 0 < p and p <= 1, "The parameter p must satisfy 0 < p <= 1."
```

You don't have the change the rest of the code since the `random()` function returns a value strictly less than 1.

Concerning the documentation. For (almost?) all modules, you can find the functions in the reference manual of sage (http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/). Then, when testing a patch, we use the command
`sage -docbuild reference html`
to build the reference manual including patch's changes. Same for `thematic_tutorials` if any.

However, the sandpile model is not included in the reference manual.
I have open a new ticket to address this issue (#13342).


So, you have to:
- change the test on p
- change the commit message of this patch. It is currently

```
#12181 bug in random digraphs with probability zero
```

It should be something like

```
trac #12181 -- Fix bugs with the input parameters of the random_DAG function
```
