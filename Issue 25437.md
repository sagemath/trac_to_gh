Keywords: r-project

R 3.5.0 is out and has changed the `dput` format (search [1] for dput). That is breaking the sage <-> r conversion in `_sage_()`, which parses the `dput` output.

The major difference is that attribute names are now always in a `name = value` form, instead of the names being seperated into `.Names`. Concrete example with `rs = r.summary(1)`:

Old:


```
sage: P.eval('dput(%s)'%rs.name())
'structure(c(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1), .Names = c("Min.", "1st Qu.", \n"Median", "Mean", "3rd Qu.", "Max."), class = c("summaryDefault", \n"table"))'
```


New:


```
sage: P.eval('dput(%s)'%rs.name())
'structure(c(Min. = 1, `1st Qu.` = 1, Median = 1, Mean = 1, `3rd Qu.` = 1, \nMax. = 1), class = c("summaryDefault", "table"))'
```


It is possible to pass `control = c("showAttributes")` (disabling `niceNames`) to get most of the old behaviour back. Unfortunately that also changes the `structure` format, which already had the `name = value` format before, to the `.Names` format.

Doctest failures with simple upgrade, no changes:

Unfortunately I don't understand the parsing code (and its intentions) well enough to fix this myself.

CC'ing the same people as in the last upgrade.

Yeah, probably. My package manager probably just fetched openSSL, I din't try it with the sage packaging mechanism.

It would still be a great first step for distributions if somebody knew how to fix the dput issue. Currently for example ArchLinux uses 3.5.0, resulting in failures.

Yes, indeed. Notwithstanding the dire objections of some, SSL support is now a necessity for R (and it should be...). 

I am still searching a way to ensure the possibility of compiling R without SSL support for the purists who whish that, but I have not been successful for now. I thoink I'm ready to throw the towel on this one, and rely on a (standard) openssl package or a systemwide one. stay tuned on #24107...

`<ThinkingOutLoud>`

For `dput` change, the only way out is to rewrite the relevant parts of the interface, thus introducing a major incompatibility. This is a problem if we ever want to be able to call a systemwide R, as it has been proposed.

Ideally, version checking should occur at interface initialization, and some function pointer should be initialized according to this check. This pointer should be used everywhere this conversion is needed. Not really easy, but the only way out if we want to be able to use a systemwide R which will not necessarily be >=3.5.0...

A similar initialization is necessary for the (R) library interface. We probably should upgraded `Rpy` to a 3.5-compatible version. I'm not sure that the dus has already settled on this one...

`</ThinkingOutLoud>`

Anyway, R 3.5 seems to change a lot of small things. The problem with `dput` is not the only one, but I am not (yet) at the root of some other problems.

Ideas ? Maybe calling for advice on [sage-devel](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sage-devel) ?

Couldn't we simply require the system version of R to be >=3.5.0 in order to be used, in that hypothetical case?

For me that seemed to be the only error, at least as far as the doctests are concerned.

Indeed.

But some (quite vocally) argued against depending on OpenSSL ; for now it's just "strongly recommended", not a dependency.

I tried (and failed) to avoid it, but proved that OpenSSL is necessary for R, for some Python and `pip` functions (among others)... Hence my proposal for integration (which stumbled on the fact that there are no acceptable substitute for some functions), and the wait for the godda OpenSSL relicensing...
