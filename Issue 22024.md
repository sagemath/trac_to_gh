Lights can be put in a fixed position relative to the view of the user by adding them to the camera and not the scene.

That will also make it more difficult for users to customize lighting if that feature will be desired in the future.

Should the lights be fixed relative to the objects in the scene or relative to the view of the user?

I definitely like that the light stays in the same place relative to my eyes, thanks for implementing it!

Regarding number of lights one indeed seems to be not enough, but I am not keen on two symmetrical ones from two sides either. I think one should be theoretically enough, if it is combined with some "ambient" light from all directions to avoid deep shadows. At the moment when there is only one light the bright spots look almost white while dark ones look close to black. Is it possible to make it less drastic? In particular for the bright spots it seems to me that things should be close to "bright blue" rather then white, i.e. the color itself should not change, just its intensity.

For the record apart from cube and sphere I was looking at this example from an earlier ticket as well:

```
var('y')
plot3d(sin(x*y),(x,-1,1),(y,-10,10),viewer='threejs',aspect_ratio=[1,.1,1])
```

Andrey, see if you like these defaults. It does look better to me!

I've also updated the Python output that appears in the web page source so that it all looks like proper JSON. This is to make all data in the page consistent with #22253, which is one bad doctest away from positive review.

I do want to give users the option to customize lighting, but that can be done or this ticket or another. The only reference point for user input that I have found is the Tachyon method `light`, which appears to only handle point lights so it's not much help.

I'm thinking of adding two keyword arguments, `ambient_light` and `directional_lights`, since those need to be specified differently. Does that sound reasonable to you? Or is there some other expected form of input that makes more sense?

Can't check how it looks at the moment but will next week.

Regarding keywords: since we didn't have such functionality before, I think whatever makes sense in threejs would work best (assuming that it will make sense for those who don't use threejs directly). If it is under user control, it may make sense to have lights which are both fixed and rotate with the scene.

Otherwise I think this is the best setup I've seen for threejs so far.

Would be nice to get more opinions!

Also for those (like me) for whom it is not obvious: after `git trac try 22261` you have to do `make start`, not just `sage -b` to install the new template.
