```markdown
The Sage Development walkthrough page had outdated info about making pull requests from Github mirror. That info has been corrected and replaced with correct info about the Sage GitLab mirror. No other changes have been made and hence merging this won't create any conflicts.

Volker, this is a minor documentation update that would be nice to add to 9.0 if there will be another release candidate (and if not then it can wait for 9.1 no problem).
