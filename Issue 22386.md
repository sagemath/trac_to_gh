Keywords: lie algebras, quantum groups, days85

This provides an implementation of quantum groups and their finite-dimensional highest weight modules by wrapping the implementation in GAP's QuaGroup package.

Here is an initial version to play with.

We should strongly consider putting a `_from_dict` into the `ModulesWithBasis` category and `dimension`, as well as `_dense_free_module` in the `FiniteDimensionalModulesWithBasis` category. We probably could also do a generic `_vector_` by getting the position of the key from `monomial_coefficients` in the basis. I had to do some very generic implementations here.

GAP's `cohomolo` is written by Derek Holt. Please fix this in the comments in your branch.

All looks good to me.  I made some documentation updates and added a link to the GAP documentation for the package (just in case).  Thanks for doing this!
