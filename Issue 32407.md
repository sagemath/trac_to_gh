Stalled in `needs_review` or `needs_info`; likely won't make it into Sage 9.5.

You could simplify the formulation `Return ``True`` if XXX and ``False`` otherwise` by `Return whether XXX`.

The docbuild error does not seems related to this ticket. Note that before pushing the changes to this branch, I was able to build the documentation on my machine.

`Return ``True`` whether ``self`` is non-zero.` would better be simplified to `Return whether ``self`` is non-zero.`

The following is very misleading

```
Computes the `q`-expansion of self up to precision ``prec`` (default: 6).
```

This one line description must be about the output, not about internals. The verb "compute" is not appropriate. It would better be changed to

```
Return the `q`-expansion of self up to precision ``prec`` (default: 6).
```

(note that in [SageMath](SageMath) the imperative form "Return" is preferred to "Computes")
