The following is very misleading

```
Computes the `q`-expansion of self up to precision ``prec`` (default: 6).
```

This one line description must be about the output, not about internals. The verb "compute" is not appropriate. It would better be changed to

```
Return the `q`-expansion of self up to precision ``prec`` (default: 6).
```

(note that in [SageMath](SageMath) the imperative form "Return" is preferred to "Computes")
