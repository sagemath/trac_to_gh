> Related: is there some way to detect if --enable-gp2c was passed? We shouldn't have to run this code at all, by default.

Unfortunately at this point the SAGE_SPKG_ENABLE calls are emitted after the SAGE_SPKG_CONFIGURE_* calls.
This could be changed easily, of course. Related: #29363

I have this change on the (unfinished) branch of #29054

Changing keywords from "" to "configure, optional packages".
