Implement a class for the orthogonal group of integral lattices.
Its elements are isometries of the ambient spaces which preserve the lattice. 

As functionality:
- Its elements have an action on elements of the ambient space and the lattice
- action on the dual lattice
- It is be a matrix group
- Compute generators in case the lattice is positive definite. One can use `QuadraticForm.automorphisms()` for that.
- It should also work for indefinite lattices. Just have some not implemented errors - like the generators.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/24036

Some comment:

* The line `submodule -- an invariant submodule` in `GroupActionOnQuotientModule` needs to be changed from submodule to quotient.
* The actions allow `is_left=True` but then ignore it in the implementation of `_call_`.
* There is no check that the invariant submodule and quotient module passed into the `__init__` method of `GroupOfIsometries` are actually invariant.
* In `/src/sage/groups/matrix_gps/orthogonal.py`, you say that you add `OrthogonalMatrixGroup_with_gap` but don't, and you import `FinitelyGeneratedMatrixGroup_gap` and `Action` but don't use them.
* It's better to use `gens is None` rather than `gens == None`
* The `is_finite` keyword on the `orthogonal_group` method should be documented better (or removed).
* Should `orthogonal_group` be a cached method?

Yeah, ``@`cached_method` supports a key to normalize the input, which you can use to make it hashable.  From the docstring for `cached_method`,

```
    The parameter ``key`` can be used to pass a function which creates a
    custom cache key for inputs. In the following example, this parameter is
    used to ignore the ``algorithm`` keyword for caching::

        sage: class A(object):
        ....:     def _f_normalize(self, x, algorithm): return x
        ....:     @cached_method(key=_f_normalize)
        ....:     def f(self, x, algorithm='default'): return x
        sage: a = A()
        sage: a.f(1, algorithm="default") is a.f(1) is a.f(1, algorithm="algorithm")
        True
```
