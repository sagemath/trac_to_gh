Fixes issue with docbuild, startuptime. Unlike the last version, I've actually been running this a bit to make sure all is well.

Can you add the stupid SPKG.txt changelog entry so that Jeroen doesnt' complain? Rest looks good to me.

Done. Also recording patchbot version and made a slight fix to locating the spkg (noticed on this ticket).

wow, I must sound crazy, but trust me, I put it there and I always double check in the meantime. The odd thing is, it has been moved into the "archive" for reasons I don't know. I can only blame the script on doing this on its own during a subsequent call â€¦
