# Issue 16621: Doctest failures when cbc is installed

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: jdemeyer

Original creation time: 2014-08-20 13:59:23

CC:  vbraun zimmerma tdumont dimpase

With the optional package `cbc` installed:

```
sage -t --long src/sage/numerical/mip.pyx
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/numerical/mip.pyx", line 1470, in sage.numerical.mip.MixedIntegerLinearProgram.number_of_variables.add_constraint
Failed example:
    p.solve()     # rel tol 1e-15
Expected:
    6.666666666666666
Got:
    6.66666666667
Tolerance exceeded: 5e-13 > 1e-15
**********************************************************************
[...several similar failures not shown...]
```


The underlying reason is that the `coin` solver returns an `RDF` element, while the `glpk` solver returns a Python float. These are printed differently, even though they have the same value.

I'm working on a patch to change `_repr_` for `RDF` and `CDF`. There are a lot of doctest failures, but I think it makes sense.

same happens when GUROBI is the default LP solver.
In addition, GUROBI automatically gives constraints names, and this
screws up even more doctests in this case.

Should we test this on ARM? There might be quite a bit of extra numerical noise...

When this ticket has been set to needs_review, yes please.

> There might be quite a bit of extra numerical noise...
I am also afraid of that.

This is now ready for testing. Volker, could you run this on the buildbots please and report back? It's not yet tested on OS X, so I expect some doctest failures.

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2014-08-29 06:30:22

This also needs some changes to the French book...

Replying to [comment:22 vbraun]:

I don't know if you're joking or not, but the left `1e-14` is actually `1.097e-14` printed with 1 significant digit. I didn't change that, but if you think that tolerances should be printed with more precision, that can easily be done on #16889.

Thierry Dumont will have a look at the changes implied for the french book, but not before Wednesday.

ARM tests: http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/vbraun/logs/arm-ptestlong.log

Dima: what is the status with ARM float precision (before this ticket)?


---

Comment by dimpase created at 2014-08-31 15:37:42

IIRC, #15921 fixed all precision things. As the precision has increased, no wonder that few tests now fail.


---

Comment by vbraun created at 2014-08-31 17:33:28

Indeed, all tests pass on ARM without this ticket.

if there are any changes in `tests/french_book`, I'd like we check them first (see

Its only adding precision to the output, I think this should be uncontroversial.
