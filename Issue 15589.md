# Issue 15589: FractionField.divides(..) should try to convert parameter

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: rws

Original creation time: 2014-02-16 18:08:25

Keywords: fraction, field, divisibility

This looks wrong:

```
sage: R.<x>=LaurentPolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: f=(x^-1+x)/(1-2*x)
sage: f.divides(1/1)
True
sage: f.divides(1)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-18-74ad9f61d7ec> in <module>()
----> 1 f.divides(Integer(1))

TypeError: Argument 'other' has incorrect type (expected sage.structure.element.FieldElement, got sage.rings.integer.Integer)
```

Well OK. It's because 1 is not a `FieldElement`.
