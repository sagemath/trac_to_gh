Since 

```
class GraphicsArray(WithEqualityById, SageObject)
```

 has not plot method, defined one to return self


```
    def plot(self):
        """
        Draw a 2D plot of this graphics object, which just returns this
        object since this is already a 2D graphics object.

        EXAMPLES::

            place some example here
            
        """
        return self
```


What do you suggest? Do I create another ticket for that or just leave it in this ticket?

There is at least #18471 for this thing; please mark it as duplicate when you are done.

I included some 87 graphics in this commit. I would appreciate your comments. It is beginning to be a slow process, rewarding for me, but I ignore if we want to pay the price when building the reference documentation.
A compromise solution would be not to generate all the graphics which have the comment #long time (good hint!), in addition to those figures which cannot be built since the implied functions do not have a plot() function.

kind of "Go" or "Not Go" decission

I have only been paying a little attention to this, but I would say that it might be better to have an on/off switch so that many developers don't have to waste time waiting for this.  But so that the online documentation has full pictures.  ?

There is an option 


```
sage --docbuild --no-plot
```


documented as "do not include graphics auto-generated using the 'plot' markup". I just tested it and it works.

That sounds familiar.  So then the question is which one should be _default_?  I think you have already linked to the discussion about that somewhere.  

PS there is at least one typo:

```
-    sage: plot(x**2, (x,0,3), ticks=[[1,2.5],pi/2], tick_formatter=[["$x_1$","$x_2$"],pi]) # long time
+    sage: plot(x2, (x,0,3), ticks=[[1,2.5],pi/2], tick_formatter=[["$x_1$","$x_2$"],pi]) # long time
```

will definitely raise an error about `x2`.

This is very nice; thank you for this work!

I've noticed some doctest error though: with sage 7.1.beta3, 
`./sage -t --long src/sage/plot/plot.py`
results in 
`Error: TAB character found at line 1518`
Indeed there are 2 tab characters at that line. 

Moreover, there are spurious blank spaces in that file. You should suppress them by telling your editor to remove trailing whitespaces.

Thanks for the changes. Everything seems fine. I've also checked that the pdf doc produced with `./sage -docbuild reference/plotting pdf` is correctly generated, with all the figures included.

Regarding the extra CPU time discussed in comment:9 to comment:15, it took only 1 min 30 s to generate all the html plot section on my computer, which seems acceptable, given the huge benefit of having nice figures in the doc. So I suggest to leave the picture generation as the default and I am setting a positive review. Thanks again for this work!

I object to the change in `plot/graphics.py`. Either add a real example or don't include an `EXAMPLES` block. There should also be a newline before the start of the method.

you are right. I forgot to add the example, thank you for pointing it out.
I think it is fixed now with an example.
