In #23227 we added `cpdef` declarations to address https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/1732.  A few were not completely straightforward and left for a followup ticket.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/23600

I would rather prefer to fix this on a case-by-case basis (for example, one ticket for p-adics, one ticket for quaternion algebras, ...)

Comments in more detail:

1. `sage/algebras/quatalg`: instead, add abstract methods `_add_` and `_mul_` to the base class.

2. `sage/modular/pollack_stevens`: unrelated change to `cpdef normalize`

3. `src/sage/modules`: instead, add abstract methods `_add_` and `_mul_` to the base class.

4. `sage/numerical/backends`: `add_variable` is already declared in the base class `GenericBackend`

5. `sage/rings/finite_rings`: instead, add abstract methods `_add_` and `_mul_` to the base class.

6. `src/sage/rings/number_field`: already in the base class `NumberFieldElement` (but not declared there)

7. `sage/rings/padics`: lots of changes, not looked in detail yet.

8. `src/sage/rings/polynomial` and power series: instead, add abstract methods to the base class.

I can try to fix some of these, but we should coordinate to avoid double work. Items 2, 4 and 6 on the list above seem easiest, so I will have a quick look now.

EDIT: 2 and 4 are different `cpdef` declarations issues, they are because of a changed signature. I sent an e-mail to cython-users asking whether the warning is still correct in this case.
