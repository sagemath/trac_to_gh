CC:  @fchapoton @anneschilling

Keywords: poset

Documentation for `is_slender()` says "It is assumed for this method that self is a finite graded poset.

1) Does this really meens "ranked", not "graded"?
2) What if not? Should it raise an exception? If not, it should be documented what happens then.

There is a spurious bracket in the documentation. Also, you need to give a reference for this definition and the definition of M_3.

I think the notion of "slender" in Grätzer and Kelly has nothing to do with Stanley's one. Grätzer and Kelly call a poset "slender" if it contains no 1 + 1 + 1, no 2 + 3, and no 1 + 5, where all numbers are boldfaced. I take it that the boldfaced numbers are ordinals, but even if they are not, this seems unlikely to be equivalent to Stanley's definition.

I have made a review commit. If you're OK with it, please set to pos_rev.
