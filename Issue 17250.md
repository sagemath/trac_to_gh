# Issue 17250: Poset: is_slender needs checking

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/17487

Original creator: jmantysalo

Original creation time: 2014-12-12 12:11:01

CC:  chapoton aschilling

Keywords: poset

Documentation for `is_slender()` says "It is assumed for this method that self is a finite graded poset.

1) Does this really meens "ranked", not "graded"?
2) What if not? Should it raise an exception? If not, it should be documented what happens then.

I think that either we document what the function does for non-graded poset, or raise an exception. This is suggestion of first type.

There is a spurious bracket in the documentation. Also, you need to give a reference for this definition and the definition of M_3.

True. Better now?

The description and title of the ticket do not match what it does (which is just a change in documentation).

If you want to make the method more general, you should check that it agrees with the definitions in the literature (and if so, cite the appropriate paper). See for example page 49 in

But in the new version it does not say what the (general) definition is, just says what the function does. I think that another possibility would be raising an exception if the poset is not graded or has not top element.

Unfortunately I can't read the link you provided. Our university has paid for new articles at the journal, but not for the old ones. (??)

I think the notion of "slender" in Grätzer and Kelly has nothing to do with Stanley's one. Grätzer and Kelly call a poset "slender" if it contains no 1 + 1 + 1, no 2 + 3, and no 1 + 5, where all numbers are boldfaced. I take it that the boldfaced numbers are ordinals, but even if they are not, this seems unlikely to be equivalent to Stanley's definition.

I have made a review commit. If you're OK with it, please set to pos_rev.

About the code: isn't it faster just to call subgraph function on _hasse_diagram?
