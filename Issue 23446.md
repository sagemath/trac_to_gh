Followup to #23193.

Function field doctests take 10 minutes on reasonable machines. That's way too much.

What we agreed upon was basically the following:\n\n- if `some_elements()^N > max_runs` and something like `max_samples` or `sampling=True` was passed:\n  * do sampling\n- else:\n  * use the direct iterator\n\nAs far as sampling goes, in order to do \"good\" sampling, we would need to decide upon a convention for where in `some_elements` the more \"interesting\" objects are at the end and we sample more heavily from there.\n\nSomething that I have used the `TestSuite` for is to increase the `max_runs` and fix failures as more interesting elements come up. So I needed that to behave in a more deterministic way as with sampling, it could be nice for `N` but fail for `N-1` because of the elements used. I also like it to work for infinite (enumerated) sets as well.",

Minor typo: `# long timeA (10s)`; you can set a positive review once fixed.

I believe David (Roe) will post the followup ticket with perhaps more details and/or a first implementation. What we agreed upon was basically the following:

- if `some_elements()^N > max_runs` and something like `max_samples` or `sampling=True` was passed:
  * do sampling
- else:
  * use the direct iterator

As far as sampling goes, in order to do "good" sampling, we would need to decide upon a convention for where in `some_elements` the more "interesting" objects are at the end and we sample more heavily from there.

Something that I have used the `TestSuite` for is to increase the `max_runs` and fix failures as more interesting elements come up. So I needed that to behave in a more deterministic way as with sampling, it could be nice for `N` but fail for `N-1` because of the elements used. I also like it to work for infinite (enumerated) sets as well.
