We improve all files in `src/sage/graphs/graph_decompositions/`: PEP8, reduce dependency to the ordering given by `G.vertices()` whenever possible, etc.

See tickets:
- #26827 avoid `.vertices()` in `bandwidth.pyx`
- #26828 pep8 cleaning of `bandwidth.pyx`
- #26829 improve and clean `cutwidth.pyx`
- #26830 avoid `.vertices()` and `.edges()` in `graph_products.pyx`
- #26831 avoid `.vertices()` in `rankwidth.pyx` and do pep8 cleaning
- #26832 avoid using `.vertices()` in `tdlib.pyx`
- #26833 avoid using `.vertices()` in `vertex_separation.pyx`
- #26834 pep8 cleaning in `vertex_separation.pyx`
