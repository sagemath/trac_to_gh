The current implementation does not handle the sparsity nor the monomial order of the polynomial ring:


```
sage: R.<x,y> = PolynomialRing(QQ, order='neglex', sparse=True)
sage: R
Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y over Rational Field

sage: sage_input(R)
QQ['x,y']

sage: sage_eval(sage_input(R)) is R
False

sage: sage_input(R, verify=True)
AssertionError: Expected Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y over Rational Field == Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y over Rational Field
```


You need to check all those cases with the `verify=True` option.

See also #22565 and #25762 for similar issues.

I agree that the (term) order should be taken into account but looking at both the documentation and the code  `sparse` is not an option for multivariate polynomial rings. (I agree that it is an option for polynomial rings.) Am I missing something?
