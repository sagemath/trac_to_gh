With the current comparison implementation, defining `__cmp__` in a Cython class can actually *break* `cmp()` if `_cmp_` raises `NotImplementedError`. This is because defining `__cmp__` causes Python to use `__cmp__` and *only* `__cmp__`. Instead, `__cmp__` (so really `_cmp` in Cython) should itself try `_richcmp_` if `_cmp_` didn't work.

To avoid an infinite loop, it's important that only `_cmp` calls `_richcmp_`, we should not change `_cmp_` here.

1. The code of `_cmp_` raises a `NotImplementedError` which has a custom error message which involves string formatting. As this error is catched in a critical part of the code (i.e. `_cmp`) I would either:
   - remove the message `"comparison not implemented for %r"%type(left)`
   - or use lazy strings

   The second option looks better to me.

2. It would be nice to update this comment:

```
    ####################################################################
    # For a derived Cython class, you **must** put the __richcmp__
    ...
    # arguments have identical parents.
    ####################################################################
```

  with something like: `implementing `_richcmp_` will automatically makes `cmp` works, see the implementation of Element._cmp`.

3. Actually, the current implementation let met think that for elements we should:
   - implement `_richcmp_` for more speed (e.g. `==` is cheap but `<` is not) or if `_cmp_` does not make sense (e.g. we want to test for equality but raise errors on `<`)
   - implement `_cmp_` otherwise

   Am I right?

Vincent

I think so, yes.
