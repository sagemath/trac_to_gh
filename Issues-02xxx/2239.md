So there's definitely a leak somewhere here, but it's not in the totallyreal code. For example, if you define:

```
def foo(f):
    tmp = f.list()
    rts = numpy.roots(tmp)
```

and run this with a `polynomial_integer_dense_ntl` as input, it'll leak like crazy. If you pass it anything else, it doesn't leak at all. It's something to do with the interaction between NTL and numpy, though I don't understand what the problem is yet.

If someone understands this, they should explain it to me. :) In any event, it's not in the totallyreal code ...

    "body": "<div id=\"comment:2\" align=\"right\">comment:2</div>\n\nSOLUTION: If you change the list into a list of Python ints (which is surely what numpy is vastly more comfortable with) taht completely gets rid of the memory leak.  I'm guessing numpy is just doing some sort of black magic to convert the list to some internal format, and it makes assumptions that aren't satisfied by Sage integers.  The right solution is to give numpy standard Python input, so it can do whatever black magic it wants under valid assumptions.  The code below illustrates how to do this.\n\n\n{{{id=115|\nimport numpy\ndef foo(f):\n    tmp = [int(a) for a in f.list()]\n    rts = numpy.roots(tmp)\n}}}\n\n{{{id=114|\nx = polygen(ZZ)\nf = x^10 - 1\nprint get_memory_usage()\nfor _ in xrange(10^4): a = foo(f)\nprint get_memory_usage()\n///\n172M+\n172M+\n}}}",

SOLUTION: If you change the list into a list of Python ints (which is surely what numpy is vastly more comfortable with) taht completely gets rid of the memory leak.  I'm guessing numpy is just doing some sort of black magic to convert the list to some internal format, and it makes assumptions that aren't satisfied by Sage integers.  The right solution is to give numpy standard Python input, so it can do whatever black magic it wants under valid assumptions.  The code below illustrates how to do this.


{{{id=115|
import numpy
def foo(f):
    tmp = [int(a) for a in f.list()]
    rts = numpy.roots(tmp)
}}}

{{{id=114|
x = polygen(ZZ)
f = x^10 - 1
print get_memory_usage()
for _ in xrange(10^4): a = foo(f)
print get_memory_usage()
///
172M+
172M+
}}}
