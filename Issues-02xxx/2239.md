So there's definitely a leak somewhere here, but it's not in the totallyreal code. For example, if you define:

```
def foo(f):
    tmp = f.list()
    rts = numpy.roots(tmp)
```

and run this with a `polynomial_integer_dense_ntl` as input, it'll leak like crazy. If you pass it anything else, it doesn't leak at all. It's something to do with the interaction between NTL and numpy, though I don't understand what the problem is yet. In particular, if you run either of the two lines above independently, over and over, you don't get a memory leak. It's only in concert that they leak ...

If someone understands this, they should explain it to me. :) In any event, it's not in the totallyreal code ...
