There are valid uses for eval() and sage_eval(), it makes it much easier to parse output from  interfaces for example. 

It is difficult (if not impossible) to completely sanitize arbitrary input, but one should be able to (say) write a backend that takes specific data, calls on Sage to process it, and then returns the result. For example, I might want a webpage that uses Sage to compute Julia sets, and takes as input a complex number. That the following work is scary 

```
sage: CC("os.getpid()")
10324.0000000000
sage: CC("os.mkdir('a')")
NaN - NaN*I
sage: CC("os.rmdir('a')")
NaN - NaN*I
sage: CC("os.exec(...)")
```

In this ticket, one introduces restrictions on the text input to CC that prevent most of these terrible examples.

<a id='comment:13'></a>I fully agree with Erik.

The following does not work (as expected)

```
sage: ZZ('2**3 + 3*g - 2')
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: unable to convert '2**3 + 3*g - 2' to an integer
sage: RR('2**2 + 3*5 - 2')
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: unable to convert '2**3+5*I-2' to a real number
```
Supporting the following with `CC` is a nonsense

```
sage: CC('2**2 + 3*5 - 2')
17.0000000000000
sage: CC('erf(2)')
0.995322265018953
```
We don't want the element constructor to evaluate a string in hope that it gives a complex number. There should be a clear definition of what is the input format. And the constructor should just stick to specifications. The element constructor of CC is trying to do much more than what it is supposed to.
