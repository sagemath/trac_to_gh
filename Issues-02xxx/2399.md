From sage-support:

```
When I was writing some other code this came out; finally decided to report it.  Do the following
in an online SAGE notebook:

1+1

We get two.  Now run the following:

# Limaçon
1+1

Get:

Sacre bleu!  It's in a comment!  Looking at the error & the web site it may be a Python thing & untouchable.
But can we get around this?  Shouldn't our French friends (and countless others) be able to use SAGE?

Why is this only a problem in the notebook? When I try to paste the above code in the CLI, I get the following, which I think is much worse:

```
sage: for i in range(10):
....:     # Limaçon
WARNING:

```

A possible way to fix this might be to make utf8 the default encoding for python, by applying the patch provided in comment:ticket:1663:2. I will try this later today.

Changing the default encoding of python does not affect the crash in the CLI. 

Some more information: 

With this test code:

```
for i in range(5):
    #some commentç
    print i
```

These work:
- python shells (both built by sage, and those installed on the system)
- IPython 0.7.2 installed on my Debian etch workstation
- IPython 0.6.15 installed on my Gentoo laptop


IPython 0.8.1 from Sage-2.10.2 crashes on my workstation with message from [comment:2](#comment:2).

IPython 0.8.1 from Sage-2.8.12 gives the following traceback on my laptop:

First, I think the patch ought to be applied because it addresses the notebook issue.  Maybe a new issue ought to be created for the command line issue.

More data points:

ipython on 32-bit ubuntu 7.10 also gives the same error message as sage when given the above string.
