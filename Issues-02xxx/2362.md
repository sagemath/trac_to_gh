The digits method should take large bases.

```
sage: n=982352935629356293856239856239852352352
sage: n.digits(928365923856928)

Use digits.2.patch.

This new patch fixes up some speed regressions compared to unpatched 2.10.2.  It seems that small cases are much better off using the naive base-conversion algorithm.  It also fixes some things so that we are just a bit faster for large input.

Note that I also tweaked the ndigits method just a bit so that it works for arbitrary large input.
