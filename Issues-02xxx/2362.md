Use digits.2.patch.

This new patch fixes up some speed regressions compared to unpatched 2.10.2.  It seems that small cases are much better off using the naive base-conversion algorithm.  It also fixes some things so that we are just a bit faster for large input.

Note that I also tweaked the ndigits method just a bit so that it works for arbitrary large input.
