Hanke's code has never worked, so it's safe to remove. He can add it back if he can get it to work.  It's a substantial amount of code, but it shouldn't be in sage until it works and has somebody who will maintain it. 

The other pari code -- test.pyx, e.g., was something I wrote and can safely be deleted.
