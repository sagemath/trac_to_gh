I've created a new patch in response to Nick's comments above: nf-from-algebraic-response.patch (to be applied after nf-from-algebraic-v2.patch).  Note that nf-from-algebraic-v2.patch has already been positively reviewed by Nick; only the -response.patch needs to be reviewed.

I mostly did what Nick asked, with two exceptions: 1) I don't like aliases; since there are no backward-compatibility issues, I just renamed the function to the more-descriptive name, instead of having an alias. 2) I named the method version "as_number_field_element", instead of "number_field_containing".

I did test that doctests pass in qqbar.py on both 32-bit and 64-bit x86 linux after this patch.
