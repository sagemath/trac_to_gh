The attached patch implements a way to compute a number field containing given algebraic numbers:

```
sage: nf_elements_from_algebraics([AA(sqrt(2)), AA(sqrt(3))])

(Number Field in a with defining polynomial y^4 - 4*y^2 + 1,
 [-a^3 + 3*a, -a^2 + 2],
 Ring morphism:
  From: Number Field in a with defining polynomial y^4 - 4*y^2 + 1

I've created a new patch in response to Nick's comments above: nf-from-algebraic-response.patch (to be applied after nf-from-algebraic-v2.patch).  Note that nf-from-algebraic-v2.patch has already been positively reviewed by Nick; only the -response.patch needs to be reviewed.

I mostly did what Nick asked, with two exceptions: 1) I don't like aliases; since there are no backward-compatibility issues, I just renamed the function to the more-descriptive name, instead of having an alias. 2) I named the method version "as_number_field_element", instead of "number_field_containing".

I did test that doctests pass in qqbar.py on both 32-bit and 64-bit x86 linux after this patch.
