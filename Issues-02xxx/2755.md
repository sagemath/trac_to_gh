```
Finally, the patch with the second version of the module... Does what was proposed on Sage Days 7 and has doctests for all functions (tests for such things as setstate  do not have explicit calls but certainly use the required functions).

ADDITIONS:

convex_hull(), minkowski_sum(), NEFPartition.dual()

ReflexivePolytope(), ReflexivePolytopes()

LatticePolytopeClass.plot3d(), LatticePolytopeClass.skeleton* (points, graph, plot)

Vertices of polytopes are now computed by default.

Little shortcuts like edges() or point().

Examples/tests for each function.

ATTACHED FILES:

Saved Sage objects for sequences of all reflexive polytopes in 2 and 3 dimensions with some precomputed data and dictionaries to these sequences allowing fast identification of the isomorphism class under GL(Z) action.

The module assumes they are located in DB_HOME/reflexive_polytopes/

Component: **geometry**

_Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/2755_

Nice job!  This is a positive review, pending the very minor changes I am attaching as a patch.  100% coverage, passes all tests on my mac intel 10.4.11 machine.  

In the future, it might be worth replacing the convex_hull function by my cddlib interface, since it seems that PALP is not configured to handle large polytopes in higher dimensions (for example, it seems extremely fragile starting in dimension 5).

The patch makes convex_hull a little more robust by explicitly casting the input to ZZ; previously it would crash on python int lists.

Thoughts?

Nah, it will be standard and I will take care of it shortly. You can take over from there and maybe add larger optional databases for polytopes of higher dimension if that makes sense.

Hi,

no dumb questions here, just dumb answers. "rebase" in this context means that you should fix the patch so it does apply cleanly against the latest release. 3.0.1.alpha1 just came out and there is a binary for sage.math in case you don't want to build from scratch yourself. The problem in the patch was in the second hunk and since that was a rather large one I didn't want to fiddle in it and potentially break things. 

Let me know if you have any more questions.

Cheers,

Michael

```
sage -t  devel/sage/sage/rings/number_field/totallyreal_rel.py

Got:

I will contact Craig Citro and John Voight to see what their take on this is. Once this is resolved I will merge both patches.

Yes, the ordering of the elements does not at all affect the
correctness of the output--the most mathematically correct thing would
be to output a set.   This change can be due to any number of things,
but it's probably not worth ascertaining the exact cause.

Ergo: positive review since I will fix the doctest issue. Let's hope this is not CPU or endianess dependent.
