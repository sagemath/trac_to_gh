This behavior is inconsistent and could lead to horrible bugs:

```
sage: int('070')
70
sage: Integer('070')
56
```

Because Sage uses Python instead of inventing its own language, there
are issues like this.   The only options to fix this problem
are (a) make int('070') return 56 or (b) make Integer('070') return 70.
Irregardless of what Sage *should* do, (a) is not an option since it
requires changing the Python interpreter, and an axiom of Sage development
is that we will never do that.  So (b) it is.   To resolve this trac tick
one must thus do (b).

Ugh. This means

```
sage: Integer('070') == Integer(070)
False
```

So be it I guess...

<a id='comment:3'>Comment 3:</a>
A PEP deals with this:

http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-3000/2007-March/006444.html

```
During the present discussion, it was almost universally agreed that::

    eval('010') == 8

should no longer be true, because that is confusing to new users.
```

Additional thoughts?
