The octave.version() command is returning '.1.73' when it should
almost certainly be returning '2.1.73'

This has been verified on three systems:
-- Sage 2.10.1 running in the Windows VM
-- Sage 2.10.3 running in the Windows VM
-- sagenb.org

If this is in fact a bug, I wonder if it is a bug in this command
alone or a more general bug having to do with returning strings from
Octave
