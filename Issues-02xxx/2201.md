Jaap reported the following doctest failure on sage-devel:

```
jaap@paix sage-2.10.2.alpha0]$ ./sage -t  devel/sage-main/sage/rings/number_field/number_field.py
sage -t  devel/sage-main/sage/rings/number_field/number_field.py**********************************************************************
File "number_field.py", line 2087:
    sage: F.reduced_basis()
Expected:
    [1, alpha, alpha^2 - 15*alpha + 1, alpha^3 - 16*alpha^2 + 469*alpha + 267109]
Got:
    [1, alpha, alpha^2 - 15*alpha, alpha^3 - 16*alpha^2 + 469*alpha + 267109]
**********************************************************************
1 items had failures:
   1 of   6 in __main__.example_60
***Test Failed*** 1 failures.
For whitespace errors, see the file .doctest_number_field.py
         [33.8 s]
exit code: 256
```

This is due to different precision getting used to compute an embedding somewhere -- the fix was to add an optional `prec` argument, which is useful in its own right, and then make the doctests call with a specific precision.
