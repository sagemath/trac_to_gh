show changed behavior in 2.10.2, which surprised lots of people.

* revert show to the previous behavior.

* plot(list) does what it currently does (i.e., superimpose the plots)

* plot(list, array=True) does what show does in 2.10.2 (i.e., put the
plots into an array).

* change the docs to show() to more clearly reflect the purpose of the
function.
