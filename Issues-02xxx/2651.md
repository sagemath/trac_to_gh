Currently the code in matrix() is pretty convoluted.  This patch is an attempt to make that code much more organized and make it easier to tackle adding features to matrix() and fixing bugs.

Additionally, this patch has quite a few more doctests testing corner casesof matrix().

I am going to run testall on this to make sure that it doesn't mess anything major up.  Right now it should pretty much be a drop-in replacement, except that some corner cases are handled more consistently.

matrix-refactor.3.patch is ready to be reviewed.  sr_matrix.patch should be also applied to fix lots of doctests since the new matrix() is a bit stricter on syntax.

There is an issue remaining with transform.pyx (line 44) calling matrix(3,1,elts), where elts is a list containing a RDF vector of 3 elements instead of elts being a list of 3 RDF numbers.  I'm opening another ticket for this bug.

This is a good change!

I'm no Python expert, but I like your choice of ValueError over TypeError.  I think the paragraph "The entries" in the INPUT: section could be revised a little to improve clarity.

In your example

```
sage: m=matrix(QQ,3,{(1,1): 2}); m; m.parent() 
[0 0]
[0 2]
[0 0]
...
```
I expected to see a 3x3 matrix.  Your other examples that have only one size input produce square matrices (particularly the empty-dict input argument!).  I'm not sure what the "right" behavior is, but I wanted to make sure you are.

I don't see any examples/tests of passing in a Sage object and using the _matrix_() attribute to get a matrix.
