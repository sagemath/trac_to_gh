This patch exposes a numerical noise issue in sha_tate:

```
sage -t -long devel/sage/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/sha_tate.py
**********************************************************************
File "/scratch/mabshoff/sage-3.3.alpha2/devel/sage-main/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/sha_tate.py", line 157:
    sage: E.sha().an()
Expected:
    0.999999999999998
Got:
    1.00000000000000
**********************************************************************
```

Cheers,
