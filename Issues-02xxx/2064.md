I've attached a patch uses a modified `inspect.BlockFinder` to recognize the `cdef` and `cpdef` tokens.  This appears to work for me, but I'm not a Cython expert.

Currently, the notebook has its own `sagenb.misc.sageinspect` and this has diverged in several places from `sage.misc.sageinspect`.  If the approach here is OK, I'll open a separate ticket to reconcile the files and fixes this problem in the notebook.

I looked at the Python inspect module, and this seems like a sane modification.  It works for all of us.  

My main suggestion would be to remove "cdef" from the list of keywords you're looking for.  Since this is introspection, you can't ever see cdef'd functions, and I'm slightly worried that there's some use case where the other uses of that keyword in Cython could trip you up.

Other than that, I'm happy to give it a positive review.
