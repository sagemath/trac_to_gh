I've attached a patch uses a modified `inspect.BlockFinder` to recognize the `cdef` and `cpdef` tokens.  This appears to work for me, but I'm not a Cython expert.

Currently, the notebook has its own `sagenb.misc.sageinspect` and this has diverged in several places from `sage.misc.sageinspect`.  If the approach here is OK, I'll open a separate ticket to reconcile the files and fixes this problem in the notebook.
