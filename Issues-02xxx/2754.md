I think that's an honest-to-goodness *bug*.  For now you can try
to workaround it sort of with:
    show(plot(sin(x),-10,10),ymin=-0.41, ymax=0.41,frame=true)
but still the curve goes outside the frame.

This is now fixed, presumably with the new matplotlib.

Question: is it possible to verify this in a doctest?  The problem is that show uses save, but the saved figure is just a png.

Nope, I don't think a doctest makes much sense here, with our current framework.

Sometime, we'll probably use matplotlib's image testing framework...

Minh, can you close this?  It works now on alpha.sagenb.org

I can confirm this is now fixed:
