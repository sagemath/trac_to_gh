In doing animations like in http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support/browse_thread/thread/8e2edf8165e9ded2

the adaptive plotting and the randomness added to the x-sample points is very annoying, creating a wiggling graph in the animation.  We ought to have options to plot to turn these things off so that we can get the same graph over and over again.

Component: **graphics**

Another idea would be for animate to use the same random offsets in each plot in the animation.

See trac #2244 that implements an option to turn off randomness in plotting.

This ticket should likely be marked as a dupe.
