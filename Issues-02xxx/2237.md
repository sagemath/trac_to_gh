In doing animations like in http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support/browse_thread/thread/8e2edf8165e9ded2

the adaptive plotting and the randomness added to the x-sample points is very annoying, creating a wiggling graph in the animation.  We ought to have options to plot to turn these things off so that we can get the same graph over and over again.

Another idea would be for animate to use the same random offsets in each plot in the animation.

See trac #2244 that implements an option to turn off randomness in plotting.

This ticket should likely be marked as a dupe.
