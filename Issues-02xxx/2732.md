Doing cython builds on Debian doesn't work, because it doesn't have the right include_dirs.

There seems to be a lot of code re-use between spkg/standard/sage-2.10.5/sage/misc/cython.py and spkg/standard/sage-2.10.5/setup.py.  It might be good to merge that code into only one place; if we don't do that, we'll probably want to make the changes we made to spkg/standard/sage-2.10.5/setup.py to spkg/standard/sage-2.10.5/sage/misc/cython.py.  

Regardless, we should have a way of specifying that we've got a Debian build at runtime (currently we only have a build-time specification).  Probably this will just mean having the SAGE wrapper script in Debian set SAGE_DEBIAN=yes.

This has indeed grown stale, in part because I've not actually had any problems passing tests despite this issue and in part because I've been very busy lately.

However, I think there is a real problem if someone wants to write some code using libraries normally packaged as part of Sage in the Sage cython environment in a packaged sage.
