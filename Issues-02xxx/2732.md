Doing cython builds on Debian doesn't work, because it doesn't have the right include_dirs.

There seems to be a lot of code re-use between spkg/standard/sage-2.10.5/sage/misc/cython.py and spkg/standard/sage-2.10.5/setup.py.  It might be good to merge that code into only one place; if we don't do that, we'll probably want to make the changes we made to spkg/standard/sage-2.10.5/setup.py to spkg/standard/sage-2.10.5/sage/misc/cython.py.  

Regardless, we should have a way of specifying that we've got a Debian build at runtime (currently we only have a build-time specification).  Probably this will just mean having the SAGE wrapper script in Debian set SAGE_DEBIAN=yes.

Well, I installed all the development libraries needed to build SAGE at runtime, and the doctests for misc/cython.py all pass at the moment.  But I suspect there will probably still be problems with the include path not having everything.

This has indeed grown stale, in part because I've not actually had any problems passing tests despite this issue and in part because I've been very busy lately.

However, I think there is a real problem if someone wants to write some code using libraries normally packaged as part of Sage in the Sage cython environment in a packaged sage.
