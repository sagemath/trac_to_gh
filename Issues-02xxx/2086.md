Consider:

```
sage: P.<x,y> = PolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: I =  Ideal([x, y])
sage: I.reduced_basis?
    x.__init__(...) initializes x; see x.__class__.__doc__ for signature

sage: I.reduced_basis??
    def wrapper(*args, **kwds):
        with RedSBContext():
            return func(*args, **kwds)
```

which is caused by the `@redSB` decorator.

This is invalid because there is a standard (?) way to work around this.
