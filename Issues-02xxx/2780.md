<div id="comment:0"></div>

When factoring a multivariate polynomial over a number field, the unit part of the factorisation is reported incorrectly:

```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^2 + 1)
sage: R.<y, z> = PolynomialRing(K)
sage: f = 2*y^2 + 2*z^2
sage: F = f.factor(); F
2 * (y + (-a)*z) * (y + a*z)
sage: F.unit_part()
1
```

The unit part should be 2.
