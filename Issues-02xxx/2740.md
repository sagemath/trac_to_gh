REFEREE REPORT:

I love this!

1. I think this should go in even without the non-blocking option.   It can be an option in the notebook command to turn this on, with it off by default.   Then on public servers people keep it off, but for their own servers (the vast majority), it is on.

2. The upload screen says: "Upload worksheet (an sws or txt file) to the Sage Notebook".  It should also say that one can upload a zip archive.

3. It would be nice if the filename of the sws could be included in the worksheet name, optionally.  My students always seem to name their sws filename right, but often forgot to actually rename their worksheets.  This causes me a *massive* amount of work to track down.

I'm changing this to a positive review, because 1-3 above are just minor nitpicks, and can all easily be fixed/polished later.
