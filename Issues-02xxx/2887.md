Tom Boothby just did this and here's his code. 

```
var cell_element_cache = [];
function get_cell2(id) {
   var v = cell_element_cache[id];
   if(v == undefined)
       v = cell_element_cache[id] = get_cell(id)
   return v;
}

```

I saw benchmarks that show a 5 times speedup for something.  I don't know if
this will be user-visible, but it might be on some machines.  The code itself
works fine and looks good.  I say apply.
