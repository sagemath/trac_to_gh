Fix this:

```
sage: f(x,y) = x+y
sage: f.gradient()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
<type 'exceptions.AttributeError'>        Traceback (most recent call last)

/Users/was/build/sage-2.10.3.rc3/devel/sage-main/sage/modular/abvar/<ipython console> in <module>()

<type 'exceptions.AttributeError'>: 'CallableSymbolicExpression' object has no attribute 'gradient'


```


SEE ALSO: This is the extent of my understanding of what #2143 does, perhaps there are other new methods that should be implemented for function rings, or other rings which should have this.

This relates to making vectors over function rings see #2546

Component: **calculus**

This patch implements the gradient and hessian (along with doctests) on callable symbolic expressions.  In order to make this work, I added an is_field method on CallablesSymbolicExpressionRing_class, which just returns true.  This is the same behavior as SymbolicExpressionRing_class, which seems appropriate.  I checked that addition and multiplication work okay with callable symbolic expressions, so they seem like an okay ring to me.

This should take care of #3941 as well, I think, though I wonder if Sage should be more careful about making a distinction between the gradient (which really only makes sense in inner product spaces), and the jacobian, which is a more generally sensible object.
