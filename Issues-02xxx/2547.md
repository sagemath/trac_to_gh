Fix this:

```
sage: f(x,y) = x+y
sage: f.gradient()

<type 'exceptions.AttributeError'>: 'CallableSymbolicExpression' object has no attribute 'gradient'


```


SEE ALSO: This is the extent of my understanding of what #2143 does, perhaps there are other new methods that should be implemented for function rings, or other rings which should have this.

This relates to making vectors over function rings see #2546

This should take care of #3941 as well, I think, though I wonder if Sage should be more careful about making a distinction between the gradient (which really only makes sense in inner product spaces), and the jacobian, which is a more generally sensible object.
