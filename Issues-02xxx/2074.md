Getting a permutation with empty, or singleton tuples blows up.

```
sage: G = SymmetricGroup(10)
sage: G(((1,2,3),(4,),(5,)))
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>

    raise TypeError, x
TypeError: Gap produced error output
Syntax error: expression expected
$sage156:=((1,2,3)(4,)(4,));;
                     ^

   executing $sage156:=((1,2,3)(4,)(4,));;
```

Similarly, a tuple consisting of a single cycle blows up:

```
sage: G(((1,2,3),))
Exception (click to the left for traceback):
...
   executing $sage163:=((1,2,3),);;
```
