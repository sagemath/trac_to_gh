Re genus2reduction-copyright2.patch:

```
[22:07] <mabshoff> wstein: genus2reduction is GPL V3? Is that really the case?
[22:07] <wstein> No.
[22:07] <wstein> genus2reduction is gpl v2+
[22:07] <mabshoff> ok, then that patch by Tim is *wrong*
[22:07] <wstein> I got it licened way way before gpl v3 ever existed.
```

Tim,
  Please find attached an updated Tachyon license which you are free
to use with any of the existing releases I've made.  I provided this to
Intel so they could include Tachyon with their open source TBB release
as well.  (they are using an older rev of Tachyon so a new release
didn't help their situation)

I'll try and get a new release package posted soon.

Cheers,
  John Stone
