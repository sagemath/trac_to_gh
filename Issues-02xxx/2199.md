Tim,
  Please find attached an updated Tachyon license which you are free
to use with any of the existing releases I've made.  I provided this to
Intel so they could include Tachyon with their open source TBB release
as well.  (they are using an older rev of Tachyon so a new release
didn't help their situation)

I'll try and get a new release package posted soon.

Cheers,
  John Stone
