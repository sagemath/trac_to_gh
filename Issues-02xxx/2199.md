```
[22:07] <mabshoff> wstein: genus2reduction is GPL V3? Is that really the case?
[22:07] <wstein> No.
[22:07] <wstein> genus2reduction is gpl v2+
[22:07] <mabshoff> ok, then that patch by Tim is *wrong*
[22:07] <wstein> I got it licened way way before gpl v3 ever existed.

Tim,
  Please find attached an updated Tachyon license which you are free
to use with any of the existing releases I've made.  I provided this to
Intel so they could include Tachyon with their open source TBB release
as well.  (they are using an older rev of Tachyon so a new release
didn't help their situation)

I'll try and get a new release package posted soon.

Cheers,
  John Stone
