To be more precise about the changelog:

* pulled in changes from PolyBoRi's SF CVS repo for a memleak fix in nf.cc
* fixes to the comments. claims about potential patents were removed by PolyBoRi authors.

Unfortunately this increased the spkg size by 2 mb. Once we update to PolyBoRi 2.0 we should consider resetting the hg changelog. I also checked in some outstanding small changes in `spkg-install`.

Cheers,

Michael
