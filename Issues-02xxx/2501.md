The attached patch adds a class SBox to the module `sage.crypto.mq` which offers basic functionality to work with cryptographic substitution boxes like:
* substitution (obviously)
* difference distribution and linear approximation matrices
* multivariate polynomial system generation
* univariate polynomial interpolation

It might be a bit controversial if this functionality should go in (it is not math but applied math), so here are some points in favour:
* Sage has a `sage.crypto` module with LFSRs and such.
* `SBox` supports (algebraic) cryptanalysis by simplifying experiments with ciphers and algebraic aspects of cryptography is an application of Sage (Sage was advertised for this application in the past)
* Some people have expressed (some) interest in such a class.

It's not controversial at all, in my opinion -- this should *definitely* go in.

"Applied math" belongs squarely within the mission of Sage, and S-Box's most certainly do.
