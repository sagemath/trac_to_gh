A new SPKG is available at:

  http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/malb/singular-3-0-4-2-20080404.spkg

However, this is not ready for inclusion yet, because of some problem with the GCD. It works correctly from Singular but not correctly via the libSingular interface. I'm working on it.

The patch applies cleanly, the spkg compiles cleanly for me on OSX and Linux. Doctests pass. I did find two small issues:

* I removed spkg-install.orig from the spkg
* I also removed the comment that SPKG.txt is deprecated from that file.

In total: positive review.

Cheers,

Michael
