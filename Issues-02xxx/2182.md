```
Hello,

Since I have upgraded to SAGE 2.10.x I get the following error message
when starting the notebook:

gnome-www-browser: symbol lookup error: /usr/lib/libxml2.so.2:
undefined symbol: gzopen64

I get this error message on two different computers (one running
Ubuntu 7.10 the other Debian Testing, which I installed today) and
with any browser (e.g. Firefox as standard browser). If I open a
session of the browser before starting SAGE, the error won't occur.
```

Jason Grout figured out that `SAGE_ORIG_LD_LIBRARY_PATH` is being overwritten improperly when the second Sage session starts (due to the launch of the notebook). He has proposed a fix and is working on a patch which will hopefully make it into 2.10.2.

Cheers,

Michael

The sage patch above fixes the open_page function (which opens the notebook in the browser) to use the standard sage mechanism for opening an external app instead of the previously hard-coded way.  The sage-scripts patch changes sage-env so that recursively run sage sessions do not clobber the saved original LD_LIBRARY environment variable.
