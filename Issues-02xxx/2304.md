It looks like the module `sage.rings.sparse_poly` is deprecated and should be removed. I can't find any other references to it in the Sage library. Awaiting confirmation from wstein.

from IRC:

```
cwitty: according to  search_src('sparse_poly') it's never referred to (never imported, etc.)...
```


Component: **basic arithmetic**

But David, my code's so fast.  Could YOU square sum(n*x^n for n in range(1000))
in less than 1.24 seconds!?  :-)


Seriously though, I wrote that code before version 0.1 of Sage as an experiment.  It can safely be removed.  If one really did want sparse polys that are fast, the best thing for now would probably to use libsingular  with one variable, e.g., 

```
sage: R.<x,y> = MPolynomialRing(QQ,2)
sage: type(x)
<type 'sage.rings.polynomial.multi_polynomial_libsingular.MPolynomial_libsingular'>
sage: f = sum(n*x^(n^2) for n in primes(100))
sage: time g = f*f
CPU times: user 0.00 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.00 s
Wall time: 0.00
sage: timeit('z=f*f')
625 loops, best of 3: 35.5 Âµs per loop

```

That said Singular polys only allow degrees up to 65K:

```
sage: x^66000
<type 'exceptions.TypeError'>: exponent is too large, max. is 65535
```

So I say delete sparse_poly.* from Sage.  If we someday want sparse polys that code could be revisited, or maybe flint will already have something much better.

Still there in 3.2.1, but trivial to fix.
