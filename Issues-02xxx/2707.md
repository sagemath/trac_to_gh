This looks good, but I would like to see three things changed:

* There's an extra 's' in the documentation for `is_totally_real` -- specifically on line 900. 

* Personally, I'd like to see some newlines between `is_totally_imaginary`, `is_totally_complex`, and `complex_embeddings`.

* I think that `is_totally_complex` should be given a full function definition, not just declared as `is_totaly_complex = is_totally_imaginary`. Here's the reason: as I understand it, if you inherit from `NumberField_generic`, and override `is_totally_imaginary`, this will **not** change `is_totally_complex` in the subclass. While this might not be deeply relevant in this case (since it's such a trivial function), I think this means it's a bad habit to be in in general, so we should avoid doing it. I know this means writing an extra docstring, which seems silly, but I think it's worth it.
