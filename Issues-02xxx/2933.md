Substitution with a dictionary as input is broken.  Notice below in the
third input that the dictionary is ignored?!

```
sage: function('f',x)
f(x)
sage: (f(x)).substitute(f=log)
log(x)
sage: (f(x)).substitute({f:log})
f(x)
sage: type(f(x))
<class 'sage.calculus.calculus.SymbolicFunctionEvaluation'>
sage: (x^3 + 1).substitute(x=5)
126
sage: (x^3 + 1).substitute({x:5})
126
```

I find the business with isinstance(str) strange, but it looks right and the doctests assert the correct behaviour.
