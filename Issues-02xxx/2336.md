This in sage/functions/orthogonal_polys.py is just wrong in multiple ways:

R = x.parent()
 y = R.gen()
 return sage_eval(maxima.eval("hermite(%s,%s)"%(n0,y)),locals={str(y):y})

(1) str(y) results in
 '1.00000000000000*y'

When R is QQ it results in 'y', which works, but in general there is no
guarantee that str(R.gen()) is the variable name.   One could do

  ystr = R.variable_name()

instead of str(y), which would work if R happens to be a univariate polynomial
ring, and would break otherwise.

(2) As suggested above the hermite function is broken if it doesn't
happen to be that the first variable of a poly ring is being substituted in.
E.g.,
sage: R.<x,y> = QQ[]
sage: hermite(3,y)
BOOM!

It also fails if x is symbolic:
sage: x = var('x')
sage: hermite(3,x)

(3)The function is also buggy, because:
sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
sage: hermite(3,x)
8*x^3 - 12*x
sage: hermite(3,x^2)
8*x^3 - 12*x

In the second case, one would expect to get either 8*x^6 - 12*x^2 or
an error message.

So this function hermite is buggy as hell.
