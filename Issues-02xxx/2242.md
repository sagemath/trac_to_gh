It's available here:

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jason/nauty-24b7.spkg

It is the 2.4 beta 7 version, since Brendan says that it is pretty stable.  It would be trivial to make a nauty 2.2 stable version if people wanted it.

This is the spkg for #1301.  Now we just need to make the interface in Sage.

To use this right now, for example, to generate the graphs of order 3, do:

```
sage: a=os.popen("nauty-geng 3").read().split()
>A nauty-geng -d0D2 n=3 e=0-3
>Z 4 graphs generated in 0.00 sec
sage: a
['B?', 'BO', 'BW', 'Bw']
sage: graph_list = [Graph(i) for i in a]
sage: graph_list

[Graph on 3 vertices,
