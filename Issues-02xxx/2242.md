It's available here:

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jason/nauty-24b7.spkg

It is the 2.4 beta 7 version, since Brendan says that it is pretty stable.  It would be trivial to make a nauty 2.2 stable version if people wanted it.

This is the spkg for #1301.  Now we just need to make the interface in Sage.

Component: **graph theory**

I've added a patch which implements the graphs.nauty_geng() command (basically doing what the examples above do).

The patch depends on the is_package_installed function, which won't appear until 2.10.2.
