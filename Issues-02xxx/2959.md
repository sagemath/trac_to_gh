sage: G = DirichletGroup(21)
sage: chi = G.0; chi
[-1, 1]
sage: chi.values()
[0, 1, -1, 0, 1, -1, 0, 0, -1, 0, 1, -1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, -1, 0, 1, -1]
```

So far, so good (similar code is in the tutorial: http://www.sagemath.org/doc/html/tut/node15.html). Now use a different base ring:

```
sage: G = DirichletGroup(21, GF(37))
sage: chi = G.0; chi
[36, 1]
sage: chi.values()
