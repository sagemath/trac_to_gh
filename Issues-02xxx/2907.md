ATM, there is no efficient way of getting the content of a polynomial in Sage.

```
gcd(p.list())
```

is a workaround, but this can be done much more efficiently.

That is not true anymore!

```python
sage: R.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: p = R.random_element(10)
sage: p.content()
1
sage: p *= 13
sage: p.content()
13
```

(There is a consistency problem though between different implementations of `content()`, see #16613, but this ticket can be closed now I think.)

Technically the one who sets the ticket to invalid should not set it to a positive review (as a "review"), but usually it's okay because things like this are non-controversial.
