There is a significantly improved version of GUAVA (a GAP package) available.
The new tarball is at
http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/wdj/guava/guava3.3.tar.gz
This new version has a new C code function for (quickly) computing the
minimum distance of binary and ternary codes (accessed via the new GUAVA function MinimumWeight), and also includes Brouwer's patch which (I'm told) fixes some or all the memory problems which Leon's code suffered. The GUAVA part also has many new functions, especially new code constructions.


Component: **coding theory**
