Please note that before I published the worksheet the Ü in the cells
were a Ü, after publishing, the "Ü" look like "�" in the published document.

My workflow was
* New worksheet
* Edit, and I inserted everything in the Edit-Field.
* Use, and evaluate the first two cells.
* Then I published.

```
print "Ü"
///
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf8' codec can't decode byte 0xdc in position 0:
unexpected end of data
```

```
print "Ue" #print "Ü"
///
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf8' codec can't decode byte 0xdc in position 0:
unexpected end of data
```

Hello,

what happened when I click on publish, is only a symptom. My problem is really simple:
**I cannot use unicode inside a notebook cell.**

Please create a new empty worksheet and enter the next examples in different cells, to see the problem:

```
# this is what I want to do, but I only get exceptions
print 'Ü'
# also exceptions
print u'Ü'
print ur'Ü'

# This works but it is ugly. If I want to convince some students to use sage with this, they will laugh
print u'\xdc'   
# Ü 

# An this is interesting because the same question mark occurs when I hit for example publish:
print '\xdc'     
# �  
```

With best regards,

Lars Fischer

Hello,

When I open a new worksheet, I check that Firefox is set to unicode. I enter the print statements from my previous comment.

Then I click on Text. And it seems that the Text-View is no longer in Unicode. To see what I mean, please toggle Encoding between Unicode and Western. 

With best regards,

Lars Fischer
