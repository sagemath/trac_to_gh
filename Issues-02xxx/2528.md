This file existed for only including certain parts of dims.py into the reference manual; this is no longer necessary, and the file should be removed. Care needs to be taken to not break the reference manual -- William has a fix that he's going to submit when I post this.

Somebody has been sneaking an extra hunk in trac-2528.patch. The first hunk has a merge conflict, which I cannot see [maybe white space?], but I ended up merging that hunk manually.

Cheers,

Michael
