I have corrected two details. This looks goot to me.

What to do now ? Maybe also use this ticket for the 120-cell graph ?

Hellooooooo !

> * with some more work, one can maybe avoid creating duplicate vertices. I will not have time to do that soon.


Well.. It's a bit slow but it isn't really the kind of function that is called very often in a code `:-P`

> * for the name, one could maybe use SixHundredCell and OneHundredTwentyCell (like they do in some other very expensive stuff named `M*********a`)


Tastes... Honestly I think that `Cell<n>` is still easier to find. Plus you cannot build `Cell600` without learning that `Cell120` is implemented too.

> * I have never heard of the 200-cell before. One should look for references.


Well even the 600 was news to me `:-P`

> * One still has to make sure that nothing else useful is still hidden there


In the code ? I just looked at the functions and it looks like we already have all that is contained there.

Hello,

I have replaced public/2686 by my branch because git was complaining (non-fast-forward updates were rejected)

I have made a more complicated algo for the 120-cell which is a bit less slow, but still rather slow.. I am not sure that was worth the time spent.

Yooooooooo !!

Well, I do not mind much for as long as the graph can be built, this is very unlikely to become the critical operation of any code in the future `:-D`

If you have problems when pushing a branch, use `git push -f`. This will force the push operation, erasing what was on the othe side if necessary. Weird that you needed it here, though.

Oh. I see. You rebase the whole branch. You should not do that `:-/`

It is much cleaner to "merge" the latest develop release into the branch. This way you just add another commit in the branch which merges it with the latest release, and there is no rebasing going on, while you "copied" all commits on top of the latest release. 

It's not a problem if you rewrote history here, however, as nobody based a branch on our earlier commits.

I just applied your branch, and I have to recompile Sage as a result as I was working on an earlier beta. Will check that tests pass, and then give this ticket a positive review.
