Hmm, I am not convinced that the result is correct:

```
88	88	    We can also make \class{CallableSymbolicExpressions}, which is a \class{SymbolicExpression} 
89	 	    that are functions of variables in a fixed order. Each 
 	89	    that is function of variables in a fixed order. Each 
90	90	    \class{SymbolicExpression} has a function() method used to create a 
91	91	    \class{CallableSymbolicExpression}.
```
While I agree that it should be singular, I think an article is missing. I guess in British English the above without the article would be correct, but with my American English I would like to see an article there.

Thoughts?

Cheers,

Michael

I am neither an american nor a british english speaker, but the new patch seems definitively better
to me (it also fixes the extra 's' in CallableSymbolicExpressions which I did not spot).
