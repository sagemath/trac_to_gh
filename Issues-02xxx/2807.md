```

I've made a patch, have no idea if it will work.

```
[10:45am] dmharvey: that's #2807
[10:46am] mabshoff: Well, let's hope we close more tickets today than we open.
[10:46am] dmharvey: I can easily close that one, but I wonder if it will introduce strange bugs....
[10:46am] malb: this line means: we always use Sage's signal handler
[10:47am] malb: which isn't too bad apparently if it handles all the signals we come across ;-)
[10:47am] malb: it probably won't change much
[10:47am] dmharvey: i will make a patch
```
