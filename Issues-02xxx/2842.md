I am seeing one doctest failure on sage.math:

```
sage -t -long devel/sage/sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_libsingular.pyx
**********************************************************************
File "/scratch/mabshoff/release-cycle/sage-3.0.alpha3/tmp/multi_polynomial_libsingular.py", line 496:
    sage: R.<x,y> = QQ[]; S.<xx,yy> = GF(5)[]; S(5*x*y + x + 17*y)
Expected:
    xx + 2*yy
Got:
    xx + 0*yy
**********************************************************************
```
Martin will start poking around tomorrow.

Cheers,

Michael
