I like it *a lot*.  One small typo: in the docstring for prime_above(), section INPUT, description of the degree, have: "If one, find a prime...".  It should be "If None, find a prime..."  Of course, one would have to be fairly out of it to be confused by this for too long.

Did I mention that I like it *a lot*?
