```
The monomial_quotient method can give invalid data:

```
sage: R.<x,y>=ZZ[]
sage: R.monomial_quotient(2*x*y,y,coeff=True)
2*x
sage: R.monomial_quotient(2*x*y,3*y,coeff=True)
2/3*x
sage: R.monomial_quotient(2*x*y,3*y,coeff=True).parent()
Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y over Integer Ring
```
2/3 is *not* an Integer!

The attached patch gives:

```
sage: R.<x,y>=ZZ[]
sage: R.monomial_quotient(2*x*y,y,coeff=True)
2*x
sage: R.monomial_quotient(2*x*y,3*y,coeff=True)
...
<type 'exceptions.TypeError'>: no coercion of this rational to integer
```


Component: **commutative algebra**
