The latest OSX 10.5.2 identifies itself as 

```
$ uname -a
Darwin zippo 9.2.2 Darwin Kernel Version 9.2.2: Tue Mar  4 21:17:34
PST 2008; root:xnu-1228.4.31~1/RELEASE_I386 i386
```
This makes the following detection code fail:

```
$ uname -r | sed s/9\.[0-9]\.0/9\.0\.0/
9.2.2
```

Cheers,

Michael

<div id="comment:2" align="right">Comment 2</div>

We currently use the following code:

```
if [ `uname` = "Darwin" -a `uname -r | sed s/9\.[0-9]\.0/9\.0\.0/` = "9.0.0" ]; then
    echo "OSX 10.5."
fi
```
It needs to be

```
if [ `uname` = "Darwin" -a `uname -r | sed s/9\.[0-9]\.[0-9]/9\.0\.0/` = "9.0.0" ]; then
    echo "OSX 10.5."
fi
```
This will break once OSX 10.5.10 rolls around, so we might want to do something more clever.

Cheers,

Michael
