The discussion below is besides the point. The main issue is that we define MPFR_PREC_MAX in Sage's sources instead of pulling it in from mpfr.h. We do hard code the 32 bit value, so on 64 bit boxen we limit the user to much lower precision than is actually technically feasible as pointed out below.

Cheers,

Michael

Yes we can. The issue was that MPFR used the stack instead of the heap
for certain operations [even when told not to use alloca] and would
smash it therefore with large number of digits. That has been fixed in
MPFR 2.3.1 (which we include) and all we need to do is to raise or
remove the limit in our code and do some testing. Care to open a
ticket?

As far as I can tell, there is still a limit, namely the maximum precision MPFR_PREC_MAX, which is 2^24 on my 32-bit machine.  

I guess this means that we can relax the current 2^23 limit a little bit.  However, the MPFR manual says: "Warning! MPFR needs to increase the precision internally, in order to provide accurate results (and in particular, correct rounding). Do not attempt to set the precision to any value near MPFR_PREC_MAX, otherwise MPFR will abort due to an assertion failure."

In mpmath on an Athlon 3700+ 2.21 GHz, 1 GB RAM,

10**6 digits took 5.96 seconds (4.77 calc, 1.19 convert)

10**7 digits took 109.45 seconds (82.16 calc, 27.28 convert)

10**8 digits took 2184.68 seconds (1634.65 calc, 550.02 convert)

I can't compare with MPFR on the same computer at the moment, due to network problems. (With an old version of sage, 3.0.2, %time str(pi.n(10**6*log(10.,2))) takes 43.06 s, but I don't trust that number).

This is the result reported by Ondrej a few months ago:

```
E.g. in sympy+gmpy:

In [3]: time a = pi.evalf(10**6)
CPU times: user 5.13 s, sys: 0.04 s, total: 5.17 s
Wall time: 5.19 s

Sage 3.1.1:

sage: time a = pi.n(digits=10**6)
CPU times: user 14.06 s, sys: 0.06 s, total: 14.12 s
Wall time: 14.34 s 
```

> This is without using the new FFT code we designed with Gaudry and Kruppa, which should give a twofold speedup. Anyway if mpmath can compute 100 million digits in less than 15 minutes, I am really impressed!

Mpmath relies directly on multiplication of GMP mpz's. If it is faster than MPFR, that is entirely due to using a better formula. Before using the Chudnovsky series, mpmath used AGM which has better theoretical complexity but was 3x slower up to at least 1M digits.

yes in a previous version MPFR did use the Chudnovsky series, but it only gives a fixed number of terms per iteration, whereas the current AGM-based code doubles the accuracy at each iteration, thus is asymptotically better. Also when the division in GMP is really O(M(n)) the current MPFR code should be much faster. However we should use the Chudnovsky series for small precision and the AGM for large precision.

Mike, I guess this has to be rebased due to #8157. Or #8157 should be undone since your patch is
better (in particular on 64-bit machines we should be able to compute with more that 2<sup>31</sup> bits).
