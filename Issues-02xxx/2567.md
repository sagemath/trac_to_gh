The discussion below is besides the point. The main issue is that we define MPFR_PREC_MAX in Sage's sources instead of pulling it in from mpfr.h. We do hard code the 32 bit value, so on 64 bit boxen we limit the user to much lower precision than is actually technically feasible as pointed out below.

Yes we can. The issue was that MPFR used the stack instead of the heap
for certain operations [even when told not to use alloca] and would
smash it therefore with large number of digits. That has been fixed in
MPFR 2.3.1 (which we include) and all we need to do is to raise or
remove the limit in our code and do some testing. Care to open a
ticket?

<a id='comment:1'></a>As far as I can tell, there is still a limit, namely the maximum precision MPFR_PREC_MAX, which is 2^24 on my 32-bit machine.  

I guess this means that we can relax the current 2^23 limit a little bit.  However, the MPFR manual says: "Warning! MPFR needs to increase the precision internally, in order to provide accurate results (and in particular, correct rounding). Do not attempt to set the precision to any value near MPFR_PREC_MAX, otherwise MPFR will abort due to an assertion failure."

```
This is without using the new FFT code we designed with Gaudry and Kruppa, which should give a
twofold speedup. Anyway if mpmath can compute 100 million digits in less than 15 minutes, I am
really impressed!

<a id='comment:6'></a>In mpmath on an Athlon 3700+ 2.21 GHz, 1 GB RAM,

10**6 digits took 5.96 seconds (4.77 calc, 1.19 convert)

10**7 digits took 109.45 seconds (82.16 calc, 27.28 convert)

10**8 digits took 2184.68 seconds (1634.65 calc, 550.02 convert)

I can't compare with MPFR on the same computer at the moment, due to network problems. (With an old version of sage, 3.0.2, %time str(pi.n(10**6*log(10.,2))) takes 43.06 s, but I don't trust that number).

This is the result reported by Ondrej a few months ago:

```
E.g. in sympy+gmpy:

In [3]: time a = pi.evalf(10**6)
CPU times: user 5.13 s, sys: 0.04 s, total: 5.17 s
Wall time: 5.19 s

Sage 3.1.1:

sage: time a = pi.n(digits=10**6)
CPU times: user 14.06 s, sys: 0.06 s, total: 14.12 s
Wall time: 14.34 s 
```
