As part of adding Debian copyright files to all the Debian packages, I tried to verify the copyright status of all the SAGE dependencies I'm packaging for Debian.  The following are the list of packages for which I have questions about:

- givaro: I can only verify this is GPL2; is it supposed to be GPL3 compatible?

- genus2reduction: The genus2reduction package itself doesn't mention copyright; though the SAGE COPYING.txt file claims GPL...

- libm4ri: I can't find an upstream URL for this.  Is there one?

- tachyon: still has 4-clause BSD in the sources (It apparently hasn't been released since the author agreed to relicense to 3-clause over email; since the email is 6 months old, it might be useful to email John Stone again?).

- sympow: the copyright statement in the SAGE COPYING.txt differs from that in the sympow sources (the latter seems to not be a standard BSD license).


Component: **debian-package**

There is none. I basically maintain the code because Gregory Bard is too busy to do it. It definitely is GPLv2 or later, I got that from Gregory via e-mail.

- givaro: this is GPL3 compatible because it's only copyright statement is that they include the GPL v2 COPYING file, which is itself GPL V3 compatible.  It says right in it "If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation."

  - genus2reduction -- I'm the maintainer of that package

  - tachyon -- pinging the author again is a good idea.  could you do that?

  - libm4ri -- see the comment from malb

  - sympow -- you're right, he puts an additional restriction above standard bsd.
The additional restriction is 'If redistribution is done as a part of a compilation that has a more
 restrictive license (such as the GPL), then the fact that SYMPOW has
 a less restrictive license must be made clear to the recipient.
 For example, a line like (include bracketed text if SYMPOW is modified):
  "This compilation includes [a modification of] SYMPOW whose [original]
   code has a less-restrictive license than the entire compilation."
 should appear in a suitable place in the COPYING and/or LICENSE file.'; I don't
view that as GPL-incompatible -- it doesn't restrict usage at all.  It just says that the copyright on sympow can't be hidden. 

So, the sympow section in Sage's COPYING.txt should be changed.

Hi William,

It will be a pleasure for me that you include genus2reduction in SAGE.
Note however that the program is not maintained anymore.  Please
feel free to make any technical modifications to make it compile
in recent systems.

Best regards,

Liu
