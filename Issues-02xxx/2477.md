This is a different bug, but the funny thing is my experience is

```
sage: g = graphs.PetersenGraph()
sage: g.plot3d()
[a crappy looking plot]
sage: g = graphs.PetersenGraph()
sage: g.plot3d(aspect_ratio=[1,1,1])

The new plot has vertices with holes in them. I have no idea what is causing this at all.

I think the patch ought to use:

```
aspect_ratio = kwds.setdefault('aspect_ratio', [1,1,1])
```

or even just

```
kwds.setdefault('aspect_ratio', [1,1,1])
```

which is the python way to do this.

The reason this ticket wasn't flagged was because setting aspect ratio to 1,1,1 causes the vertices to look very bad on some systems. In order for this to happen, something needs to happen, either in the code for spheres, or the way graphs are calling them. This isn't ready.

The aspect_ratio:

aspect_ratio=[1,1,1.0000001]

works great for me, while the aspect_ratio=[1,1,1] gives the holes.

I'd say just make the aspect ratio the above (which is *really* close to 1,1,1).

I think the issue here is the radius of the vertices (0.06).  We see the same problem with the following:


sphere(center=(-1,0,0),size=.06) + sphere(center=(1,0,0), size=0.06, 
aspect_ratio=[1,1,1])

For me, an alternative to setting the aspect_ratio to [1,1,1.000001] would be setting the radius of the vertices to 0.1 (at least, a radius of 0.1 fixes the holes in the above spheres).

I'd say we fix this ticket with an aspect_ratio of [1,1,1] and then open another ticket that sets the resolution of sphere.jmol_repr when a small sphere is drawn.
