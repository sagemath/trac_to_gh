<a id='comment:1'></a>This is a different bug, but the funny thing is my experience is

```
sage: g = graphs.PetersenGraph()
sage: g.plot3d()
[a crappy looking plot]
sage: g = graphs.PetersenGraph()
sage: g.plot3d(aspect_ratio=[1,1,1])
[an even crappier looking plot]
```
The new plot has vertices with holes in them. I have no idea what is causing this at all.

or even just

<a id='comment:5'></a>The aspect_ratio:

aspect_ratio=[1,1,1.0000001]

works great for me, while the aspect_ratio=[1,1,1] gives the holes.

I'd say just make the aspect ratio the above (which is *really* close to 1,1,1).
