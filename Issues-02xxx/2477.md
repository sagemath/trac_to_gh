This is a different bug, but the funny thing is my experience is

```
sage: g = graphs.PetersenGraph()
sage: g.plot3d()
[a crappy looking plot]
sage: g = graphs.PetersenGraph()
sage: g.plot3d(aspect_ratio=[1,1,1])

The new plot has vertices with holes in them. I have no idea what is causing this at all.

I think the patch ought to use:

```
aspect_ratio = kwds.setdefault('aspect_ratio', [1,1,1])
```

or even just

```
kwds.setdefault('aspect_ratio', [1,1,1])
```

which is the python way to do this.

The aspect_ratio:

aspect_ratio=[1,1,1.0000001]

works great for me, while the aspect_ratio=[1,1,1] gives the holes.

I'd say just make the aspect ratio the above (which is *really* close to 1,1,1).

I think the issue here is the radius of the vertices (0.06).  We see the same problem with the following:


sphere(center=(-1,0,0),size=.06) + sphere(center=(1,0,0), size=0.06,

For me, an alternative to setting the aspect_ratio to [1,1,1.000001] would be setting the radius of the vertices to 0.1 (at least, a radius of 0.1 fixes the holes in the above spheres).

I'd say we fix this ticket with an aspect_ratio of [1,1,1] and then open another ticket that sets the resolution of sphere.jmol_repr when a small sphere is drawn.
