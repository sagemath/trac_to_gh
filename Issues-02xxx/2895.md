If the base ring is a field of rational functions 
in another indeterminate I encounter a problem:

sage: P.<q>=QQ[]
sage: F = FractionField(P)
sage: R.<x,y> = LaurentPolynomialRing(F,2); R
Multivariate Laurent Polynomial Ring in x, y over Fraction Field of Univariate Polynomial Ring in q over Rational Field
sage: (x+1/y)^2

This would work if F = QQ but not for this field of fractions.

<type 'exceptions.TypeError'>: unsupported operand parent(s) for '/': 'Integer Ring' and 'Multivariate Laurent Polynomial Ring in x, y over Fraction Field of Univariate Polynomial Ring in q over Rational Field'

To elaborate, 1/y raises an error if the base ring is ZZ, a polynomial
ring or a field of fractions of a polynomial ring.

HOWEVER y^(-1) can be used in its place, and no error result.

This may be acceptable.

Here's what appears to have happened. The old QuotientRingElement is in
rings/quotient_ring_element.py and it contains the following:

```
    def _repr_(self):
        from sage.structure.parent_gens import localvars
        P = self.parent()
        R = P.cover_ring()
        # We print by temporarily (and safely!) changing the variable
        # names of the covering structure R to those of P.
        # These names get changed back, since we're using "with".
        with localvars(R, P.variable_names(), normalize=False):
            return str(self.__rep)
```

The new version is in the file quotient_ring_elements.pyx. The
above code will not work in cython. In its place, we find:

```
     def _repr_(self):
         self._reduce_()
         return self.parent()._print_element(self)
```

But the parent quotient ring has no method _print_element.

An issue with putting this patch in close to release of 3.0 is whether it could break anything. Revised by mhansen it does not convert quotient_polynomial_element to cython as the previous patch did. Moreover after importing both revised 2895-1.patch and 2895-2.patch I read the diffs carefully and there is nothing that alters any existing functionality. So the patch is safe from this point of view.

I tested it and it seems to work as it should.

I don't think substitution is working yet. In a multivariate polynomial ring you can do:
sage: g=(q+u)*(q+v)
sage: g.substitute(u=1)
(q + 1)*v + q^2 + q
In the Laurent polynomial ring this raises an exception.

This is not a reason not to include the patch. Substitution can be implemented later. 

I recommend acceptance.

Substitution works if the ground ring is QQ but the
following returns an exception:

```
sage: R.<q>=QQ[]
sage: L.<x,y,z> = LaurentPolynomialRing(R)
sage: f=(x+y+z^-1)^2
sage: f.substitute(z=1)
```
I repeat that my review is positive and I'd urge these patches to be merged in alpha6.

Thanks for testing this out Dan. 

The underlying problem is with coercing between elements of a fraction field and the Laurent polynomial ring.  I'm not familiar enough with the coercion system so I'll send an email to David Roe since he probably knows exactly how to fix it.

Ok, I consider this a positive review by Dan Bump and will merge this as is into 3.0.alpha6.

Mike: can you open a ticket for the coercion issue and make it a blocker for 3.0. We might get the patch in if David or somebody else comes up with patch in time. If not there is still 3.0.x ;)
