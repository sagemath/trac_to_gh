<a id='comment:2'></a>If the base ring is a field of rational functions 
in another indeterminate I encounter a problem:

sage: P.<q>=QQ[]
sage: F = FractionField(P)
sage: R.<x,y> = LaurentPolynomialRing(F,2); R
Multivariate Laurent Polynomial Ring in x, y over Fraction Field of Univariate Polynomial Ring in q over Rational Field
sage: (x+1/y)^2

This would work if F = QQ but not for this field of fractions.

<a id='comment:5'></a>Here's what appears to have happened. The old QuotientRingElement is in
rings/quotient_ring_element.py and it contains the following:

```
    def _repr_(self):
        from sage.structure.parent_gens import localvars
        P = self.parent()
        R = P.cover_ring()
        # We print by temporarily (and safely!) changing the variable
        # names of the covering structure R to those of P.
        # These names get changed back, since we're using "with".
        with localvars(R, P.variable_names(), normalize=False):
            return str(self.__rep)
```

The new version is in the file quotient_ring_elements.pyx. The
above code will not work in cython. In its place, we find:

```
     def _repr_(self):
         self._reduce_()
         return self.parent()._print_element(self)
```

But the parent quotient ring has no method _print_element.

<a id='comment:8'></a>An issue with putting this patch in close to release of 3.0 is whether it could break anything.

So the patch is safe from this point of view.

I tested it and it seems to work as it should.

I don't think substitution is working yet. In a multivariate polynomial ring you can do:
sage: g=(q+u)*(q+v)
sage: g.substitute(u=1)
(q + 1)*v + q^2 + q
In the Laurent polynomial ring this raises an exception.

This is not a reason not to include the patch. Substitution can be implemented later. 

I recommend acceptance.
