This is *terrible*

```
sage: n = 10
sage: n.set_str('15')
sage: n
15
```

The set_str function must be made __ or removed.

Look at what evil can occur:

```
sage: a = matrix(ZZ,2,[1,2,3,4]); d = a.det(); d
-2
sage: d.set_str('10')
sage: a.det()
10
```

Component: **basic arithmetic**

This looks good and should be applied.

In general I prefer single underscores to double -- strange things happen with double when inheritance comes in.  But in this situation, perhaps double is justified?

In the docstrings for the rational fixes, integer needs to be replaced by rational in a few places.
