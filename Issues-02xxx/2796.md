# Issue 2796: Integer digits/ndigit disagree on default base

I find this quite non-intuitive:

```
sage: n=15
sage: n.digits()
[1, 1, 1, 1]
sage: n.ndigits()
2
sage: n.bits()
4
```

The reason is that digits and ndigits have a different default for the base parameter.  I think they should both default to base=10.

I also think that 'bits' should be renamed to 'nbits' and possibly the 'bits' method should call 'digits(base=2)'.  I enter this with-out a patch for the moment because I wanted some feedback before I submit a patch which could break user code.  Please vote in this ticket.

**Attachment:** [trac_2796.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket2796/trac_2796.patch)

the attached patch changes the default base to 10 for digits, so that digits and ndigits agree:

```
sage: n=15
sage: n.digits()
[5, 1]
sage: n.ndigits()
2
```
As a consequence, calls to digits() were changed into digits(2).

I like this as far as it goes, but would also like n.bits() to return n.digits(2) and n.nbits() to return what n.bits() currently does.  Can we add that too?

The second patch (to be applied after the 1st one) does this. sage -t -long * returned the following failures,
but I guess they are related to another patch. In any case the reviewer should check them before and after applying
the 2nd patch:

```
      sage -t -long devel/sage-main/sage/modular/modform/j_invariant.py
      sage -t -long devel/sage-main/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/padics.py
      sage -t -long devel/sage-main/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_generic.py
```

Looks good to me, and I think this is a good change too. 

I didn't get those modular/elliptic curve errors, so it must be due to something else.

Ah yes, my shortest patch to date.  Apply trac_2796b.patch after the other two to fix the symbolic/expression.pyx failure.

It is of course trivial, yet it took about half an hour to find...

The first two patches look good to me, otherwise.
