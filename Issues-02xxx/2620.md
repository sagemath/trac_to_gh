Python has a generator type which is cool and now this works:

```
P.<a,b,c,d,e> = PolynomialRing(GF(2), 5, order='lex')
I1 = ideal([a*b + c*d + 1, a*c*e + d*e, a*b*e + c*e, b*c + c*d*e + 1])
Q = P.quotient( sage.rings.ideal.FieldIdeal(P) )
I2 = ideal( Q(f) for f in I1.gens() ) # note we don't construct a list
```
