There's some error with `plus_submodule` and `cuspidal_submodule` not being "commutative." Here's an example:

```
sage: M = ModularSymbols(11,2)
sage: Mpc = M.plus_submodule().cuspidal_submodule()
sage: Mcp = M.cuspidal_submodule().plus_submodule()

sage: Mcp.q_expansion_basis(10) 
[
q - 2*q^2 - q^3 + 2*q^4 + q^5 + 2*q^6 - 2*q^7 - 2*q^9 + O(q^10)
]

sage: Mpc.q_expansion_basis(10)

I also added a few doctests here and there, since I was at it.

Patch looks good -- code is clean, doctests are good.

I cannot be the only judge on this patch because I am not expert in the functionality.

One change I would advocate is documenting the choices for `use_sign`.  See the source is not the best documentation :)

Negative review, since the code doesn't work on the example given below:

```
17:47 < wstein-2535> craigcitro -- what happens with this new code when the submodule we're trying to get the
17:47 < wstein-2535> dual of has both * eigenvalues?
17:48 < wstein-2535> I think this new code might just break then.
17:48 -!- roed_ [n=roed@c-98-216-48-4.hsd1.ma.comcast.net] has quit []
17:48 < craigcitro> ah, you're saying i want an 'else' clause in the 'star' case.
17:48 < wstein-2535>  At a minimum.
17:49 < wstein-2535> And also you *have* to use star in that case.
17:49 < wstein-2535> Or something.
17:49 < wstein-2535> You've only treated one cases, namely * = constant on subspace.
17:49 < wstein-2535> But this "use the *" trick should work more generaly for any *-equivariant module.
17:49 < craigcitro> oh, you're saying in that case, take the + and - submodules and then just take the sum
17:50 < craigcitro> (i.e. do the same thing i'd do in the case of one eigenvalue with each of them)
17:50 < wstein-2535> sage: M = ModularSymbols(43).cuspidal_submodule()
17:50 < wstein-2535> sage: S = M[0].plus_submodule() + M[1].minus_submodule()
17:50 < wstein-2535> sage: S.dual_free_module()
17:50 < wstein-2535> boom!
17:50 < wstein-2535> Yes, exactly.
