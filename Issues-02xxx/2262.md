In retro perspective it was a bad choice to put the dist specific Debian stuff into the Sage repo. It would be much better to create a dist directory in the ext repo and move it all over there. Too late for 2.10.2, but doable in 2.10.3.

<a id='comment:1'></a>How does the ext repo work?  I'm not familiar with this piece of the
SAGE setup (where it unpacks, etc.).

What are the problems with the current setup?  I can imagine various
possible problems, but am curious which we're actually running into.

I find the proximity of directory trees that the current setup has to
be useful for modifying the debian/rules file if the spkg-install
script is nearby, but this is obviously not particularly important.

The main thing I guess that needs to be decided then is what to replace the Debian-specific changes to setup.py with.  They include:

1) adding things to library_dirs and include_dirs.  This should be made into a generic environment variable that can be used for any distribution build system.

2) adding /usr/lib/python2.5 to the hardcoded python libraries search path.  I guess we also want to have an environment variable that can extend the set of places that looks for python libraries?
