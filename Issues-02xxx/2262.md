In retro perspective it was a bad choice to put the dist specific Debian stuff into the Sage repo. It would be much better to create a dist directory in the ext repo and move it all over there. Too late for 2.10.2, but doable in 2.10.3.

How does the ext repo work?  I'm not familiar with this piece of the
SAGE setup (where it unpacks, etc.).

What are the problems with the current setup?  I can imagine various
possible problems, but am curious which we're actually running into.

I find the proximity of directory trees that the current setup has to
be useful for modifying the debian/rules file if the spkg-install
script is nearby, but this is obviously not particularly important.

OK.  This makes much more sense now.

The main thing I guess that needs to be decided then is what to replace the Debian-specific changes to setup.py with.  They include:

1) adding things to library_dirs and include_dirs.  This should be made into a generic environment variable that can be used for any distribution build system.

2) adding /usr/lib/python2.5 to the hardcoded python libraries search path.  I guess we also want to have an environment variable that can extend the set of places that looks for python libraries?

Yes, I agree.
