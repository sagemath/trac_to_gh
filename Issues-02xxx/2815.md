mmmh, the crystals patch does not apply at all:

```
patch -p1 --dry-run < trac_2815_9217.patch
patching file sage/combinat/crystals/letters.py
Hunk #1 FAILED at 197.
Hunk #2 FAILED at 213.
Hunk #3 FAILED at 234.
Hunk #4 FAILED at 243.
Hunk #5 FAILED at 267.
```

I changed the summary to "dd more coding theory to the reference manual" since that patch does apply. Please open another ticket for any new patches.

Thoughts?
