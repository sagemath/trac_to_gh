I made very minor harmless change to how the notebook twisted daemon is started, which makes it more robust.   Also, it was completely broken on my system until I made this change.  This is probably related to us updating to a new version of twistd.

The change is just to cd into the notebook directory before starting the tracd server.  That's it.
