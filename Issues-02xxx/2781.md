Currently, it returns False, which makes a return value of False fairly worthless.

After discussion on IRC, the consensus was that this is *not* pythonic (see, for example, the docs for `__nonzero__` at http://www.python.org/doc/2.3.5/ref/customization.html )

This functionality should probably be a different function than the builtin bool function.  The current functionality should stand as it is.

Eventually, as we get quantifiers worked into the system, it would be nice to have a function that said if an equation was always true, always false, sometimes true, sometimes false, etc.  Something like Reduce in Mma would be nice.
