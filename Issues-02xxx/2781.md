The patch currently passes minimal doctests, but breaks lots of other doctests.  I've run out of time to work on it now, but will look at this later.

After discussion on IRC, the consensus was that this is *not* pythonic (see, for example, the docs for `__nonzero__` at http://www.python.org/doc/2.3.5/ref/customization.html )

This functionality should probably be a different function than the builtin bool function.  The current functionality should stand as it is.

Eventually, as we get quantifiers worked into the system, it would be nice to have a function that said if an equation was always true, always false, sometimes true, sometimes false, etc.  Something like Reduce in Mma would be nice.
