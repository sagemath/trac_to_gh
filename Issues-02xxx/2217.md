Note that this approach does not give the splitting field.  It gives a field containing at least one root of each factor of the original polynomial, but that still might not be the splitting field.

Later in the thread mentioned above, I give a technique using internals of qqbar which I believe does give the splitting field (perhaps inefficiently).

I ran all standard tests, and everything passed.

I was trying to test functionality, but I'm confused by the differences file.  All of the old examples seem to work, and none of the new ones work.

In the first example, I get:


```
sage: G = NumberField(x^3 - x - 1,'a').galois_closure('b').galois_group(); G

Galois group of Number Field in b with defining polynomial x^6 - 14*x^4
+ 20*x^3 + 49*x^2 - 140*x + 307
```


The expected output seems to have been changed *from* this result to 


```
Number Field in b with defining polynomial x^6 - 6*x^4 + 9*x^2 + 23 
```


These fields are isomorphic, but I've tried the example on three machines, and all of them give the first thing as the output.

Similarly, the second example doesn't work:


```
sage: G.subgroup([ G(1), G([(1,2,3),(4,5,6)]), G([(1,3,2),(4,6,5)]) ]) 

Traceback (click to the left of this block for traceback)
...
TypeError: permutation [(1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6)] not in Galois group of
Number Field in b with defining polynomial x^6 - 14*x^4 + 20*x^3 +
49*x^2 - 140*x + 307

```

But the original example (now deleted) does work:


```
sage: G.subgroup([ G(1), G([(1,5,2),(3,4,6)]), G([(1,2,5),(3,6,4)])])

Subgroup [(), (1,5,2)(3,4,6), (1,2,5)(3,6,4)] of Galois group of Number
Field in b with defining polynomial x^6 - 14*x^4 + 20*x^3 + 49*x^2 -
140*x + 307

```

I did not see this comment until after I had finished, so I may have been wasting my time.  I had to apply the changes manually since I could not get the patches to apply.

I absolutely understand your point, but I think I indicated that this was work in progress so I felt it was safe to "rewrite history". Now that it's `needs_review`, I will no longer rewrite history.

Concerning authorship: I did indeed reset the author name back to myself (`git commit --amend --author Demeyer`), and that's already rewriting history.
