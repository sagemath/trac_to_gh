The original Weyl group patch was described here:

http://groups.google.com/group/sage-combinat-devel/browse_thread/thread/80515528dc9648fd?hl=en

No trac ticket was made, and the patch no longer applies without modification so I
revised it and am uploading it as this ticket.

Mike Hansen told me he wants to revise the patch in connection with a reorganization
in which case this ticket might be superfluous. However I added one thing, which is
instructions for obtaining the character tables.

I realize this is "not ready for review" but I tested it out anyway. It down not apply to sage-3.0.alpga3 but can be applied "manually" (namely, read the man page for "patch" ...).

I just checked that the above linked-to email does what it claims this patch does:

sage: L = G.lattice()
sage: G; L
The Weyl Group of type ['F', 4]

It does apply directly to 3.0.alpha3 since it's a patch against 3.0.alpha3. 

From the combinat directory "patch <weylgroup3.patch" applies cleanly.

I'm unsure why Michael Abshoff described it as not ready for review. One possible reason is that Mike Hanson intends reorganization of root_system.py.

"From the combinat directory "patch <weylgroup3.patch" applies cleanly."

I would say that is the definition of "applies manually", so i agree with you!
When I say it "does not apply to sage-3.0.alpha3" I mean that 
the following does *not* occur:

```
sage: hg_sage.apply("/home/wdj/wdj/sagefiles/weylgroup3.patch")
cd "/home/wdj/wdj/sagefiles/sage-3.0.alpha3/devel/sage" && hg status
cd "/home/wdj/wdj/sagefiles/sage-3.0.alpha3/devel/sage" && hg status
cd "/home/wdj/wdj/sagefiles/sage-3.0.alpha3/devel/sage" && hg import   "/home/wdj/wdj/sagefiles/weylgroup3.patch"
applying /home/wdj/wdj/sagefiles/weylgroup3.patch
transaction abort!
rollback completed
sage:
```
Did you create your patch using hg_sage.commit, hg_sage.bundle, hg_sage.log, hg_sage.export, as described (well, more-or-less described :-) on http://www.sagemath.org/doc/html/prog/node72.html ? If yes, then maybe my download was corrupted or something.

Hi Dan,

this was the precise reason I marked it this way and I assume Mike will take care of this later.

Although the patch appears large, it is mostly reorganization. Apart from moving files around, a hash method is added to CartanType_simple and Weyl Groups are cached in improvement over the original patch. 

Two minor problems:

(1) the G2 patch (track #2808) was accidentally reverted.
(2) Some words about how to get the character table were lost.

These are addressed by 2864a.patch which goes on top of 2864.patch.

My recommendation would be to merge 2864.patch + 2864a.patch.
