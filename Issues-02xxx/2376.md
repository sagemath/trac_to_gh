We have various doctest failures in

```
sage -t -long devel/sage-main/sage/modular/abvar/abvar.py
sage -t -long devel/sage-main/sage/modular/abvar/finite_subgroup.py
sage -t -long devel/sage-main/sage/modular/abvar/torsion_subgroup.py

I just attached another trivial, "obviously" correct doctest fix related to trac-2245-lseries.patch to this ticket. It has already been merged, but feel free to review it.
