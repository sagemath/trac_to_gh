```
r(t) = 1000 * t * e^(-.5 * t)
plot(r, xmin=0, xmax=20).show()
```

doesn't work. But

```
plot(r, (0,20)).show()
```
does. The documentation still says

```
    PLOT OPTIONS:
    The plot options are
    [...]
        xmin -- starting x value
        xmax -- ending x value
    [...]
```

Hm. If I do:

```
sage: r(t) = 1000 * t * e^(-0.5*t)
sage: plot(r, xmin=10, xmax=20).show()
```
or (to make sure I didn't misunderstand "greater than" -1):

```
sage: r(t) = 1000 * t * e^(-0.5*t)
sage: plot(r, xmin=-2, xmax=20).show()
```
then I seem to get the same behavior with or without this particular change in the code.

I have two more questions: what should the following do?

```
plot (r, xmin=10, xmax=-2).show()
```
It should probably print an error (since xmin > xmax), but right now I get a graph which is a bad approximation to 

```
plot (r, xmin=-2, xmax=10).show()
```
It's actually pretty strange looking...

Also, do you have any idea why, if I do

```
plot (r, xmin=5, xmax=20).show()
```
then the vertical axis is the line x=5, not x=0?  When xmin is positive, I seem to get x=xmin as the vertical axis, which looks strange to me.  I guess the same happens if both xmin and xmax are negative: then x=xmax is drawn as the vertical axis.  (This is probably a completely separate issue, but I thought I'd ask.)

File 2339-3.2.alpha0.patch is rebased patch against 3.2.alpha0.   As JHP says, please give credit to Marshall.

Interestingly, all the plot improvements as of late have already fixed both the Graphics initialization problem of [-1,1] and the problem if you get the range in backwards, i.e. all of the following work with this patch:

```
plot(r, xmin=10, xmax=-2).show()
plot(r, 10,-2).show()
plot(r, (10,-2)).show()
