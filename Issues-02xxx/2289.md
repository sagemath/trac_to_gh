The patch is somewhat big but most of the changes are cosmetic, aimed at making const.tex more consistent internally (and with the tutorial) and prettier to behold.

I've also exposed a number of examples that were %skip-ped previously, tested them and fixed a few of them that were buggy.

I'm not sure that the problem is. Could the patch possibly be recreated using
sage-2.10.3.alpha0?
