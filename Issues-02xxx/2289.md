The patch is somewhat big but most of the changes are cosmetic, aimed at making const.tex more consistent internally (and with the tutorial) and prettier to behold.

I've also exposed a number of examples that were %skip-ped previously, tested them and fixed a few of them that were buggy.

I think this patch should be made after applying the earlier patch at
https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/2274
(which is still waiting for review) for const.tex. However, that patch requires the coding theory patch (also in ticket 2274) as well to pass sage -t.

I applied this patch to const.tex in sage-2.10.3.alpha0 and got:
4 out of 153 hunks FAILED -- saving rejects to file devel/doc/const/const.tex.rej

I'm not sure that the problem is. Could the patch possibly be recreated using
sage-2.10.3.alpha0?

Hi, I know exactly what the problem is.  When your coding theory patch from #2274 got merged, so did your modifications to const.tex that you had made there.  But I had already merged them into my patch here, so mercurial got confused.

But no worries.  I've fixed things and rebased the patch against sage-2.10.3.alpha0, so it should all be good now.

Note that if you take a look at const.pdf, there are still a few long lines.  They are trickier to deal with (wrapping them breaks doctests, etc.) so I'm still thinking about it.  This is also an issue with tut.tex (in a few places).  It will have to get fixed later...
