The following sequence of events leads to a "Internal Server Error" page:

* Start up sage to serve a local notebook (sage -notebook)
[Browser pops up with "admin" already logged in, using a "startup_token" url]
* select some worksheets
* click "archive"

The notebook seems to be in a sane condition afterwards. If I change the URL to "https://localhost:8001/" (i.e., remove the "?startup_token=..." part) everything seems as it should be. I guess the notebook barfs at this stage on the "?" part in the URL?



Component: **notebook**

As we don't get the URL at the beginning with the startup token, I'm going to mark this as invalid.  I can't reproduce it in 3.2.3.

This came up last week on sage-edu with Sage 3.2.3, so there is certainly a bug to be found and fixed here. It was reproducible with a wiped .sage by someone who seemed technically competent enough not to make a dumb mistake. So I am reopening this.

Cheers,
