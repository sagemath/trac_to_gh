The following sequence of events leads to a "Internal Server Error" page:

* Start up sage to serve a local notebook (sage -notebook)
[Browser pops up with "admin" already logged in, using a "startup_token" url]
* select some worksheets
* click "archive"

The notebook seems to be in a sane condition afterwards. If I change the URL to "https://localhost:8001/" (i.e., remove the "?startup_token=..." part) everything seems as it should be. I guess the notebook barfs at this stage on the "?" part in the URL?

As we don't get the URL at the beginning with the startup token, I'm going to mark this as invalid.  I can't reproduce it in 3.2.3.

This came up last week on sage-edu with Sage 3.2.3, so there is certainly a bug to be found and fixed here. It was reproducible with a wiped .sage by someone who seemed technically competent enough not to make a dumb mistake. So I am reopening this.

Cheers,

Michael
