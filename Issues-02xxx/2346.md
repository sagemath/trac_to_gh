1) Other than an unknown parent message, this applies cleanly against 2.10.3.alpha0

2) I can't get the server/simple/twisted.py tests to pass.  The following error causes all the problems:

```

Other than that, this patch looks excellent!

The Errno url error is strange, does your urllib not support secure http connections?

I've re-implemented the waiting using LoopingCall, and also reduced the amount of time it spends blocking waiting for Sage input. 

I'm not sure what to do about the https error--we don't want to doctest with http as that would be a potential security vulnerability. 

mhansen: what system are you getting that error on. Is it the Sage python?
