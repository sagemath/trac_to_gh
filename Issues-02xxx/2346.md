The above bundle implements a simple api over http as described in http://groups.google.com/group/sage-edu/browse_thread/thread/f2935bb4ddb72dc5

It should be completely useable in its current form, though of course there is lots of room for improvement.

A few comments:

1) Other than an unknown parent message, this applies cleanly against 2.10.3.alpha0

2) I can't get the server/simple/twisted.py tests to pass.  The following error causes all the problems:

```
 IOError: [Errno url error] unknown url type: 'https'
```

Other than that, this patch looks excellent!

I'll look into the looping call thing more, but if it's what I think it is I'm not sure it satisfies all my needs. 

The Errno url error is strange, does your urllib not support secure http connections?

I've re-implemented the waiting using LoopingCall, and also reduced the amount of time it spends blocking waiting for Sage input. 

I'm not sure what to do about the https error--we don't want to doctest with http as that would be a potential security vulnerability. 

mhansen: what system are you getting that error on. Is it the Sage python?
