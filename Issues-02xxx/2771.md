Hi malb,

I skimmed the code, so no final review yet. But I noticed that you use

```
sage: from polybori import BooleSet 
```
for imports. This will cause trouble once  #2746, i.e. "Support for writing test-related files in SAGE_TESTDIR", is applied. 

Cheers,

Michael

It won't. There is `sage.rings.polynomial.pbori` and there is `polybori`. `polybori` is indeed at the global top-level.

I found two small issues:

* One time you use "Gr√∂bner" while in all other places you use Groebner
* I would use a verb for "The opposite of navigation down a ZDD using navigators is to"
