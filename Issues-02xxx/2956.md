Long exponents are silently truncated to word-size exponents:

```
sage: K.<x,y> = AA[]
sage: x^(2^64 + 12345)
x^12345
```

In one test, I also saw a crash, but I can't reproduce it.

```
sage: K.<x,y> = ZZ[]
sage: (x^12345)^54321


------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occured in SAGE.
...
```
(The crash was on 32-bit x86 Debian testing.  The first test fails with the same answer on both 32-bit and 64-bit x86.)

<a id='comment:2'>Comment 2:</a>
For the 2nd example, I do not get a crash, but a funny result with 3.1.4 on a 32-bit computer:

```
sage: K.<x,y> = ZZ[]
sage: (x^12345)^54321
x^28393*y^10232
```
Note that y does not appear in the input!

Possible explanation: 12345*54321 = 10232*2^16+28393.
Apparently the low 16 bits are used to store the exponent of x, and the upper 16 bits
for the exponent of y, but no check for overflow is done!!!

I tried on a 32-bit machine with vanilla 4.7.2. The first doctest is ok, for the second one I get:

```
sage: (x^12345)^54321
...
OverflowError: Exponent overflow (670592745).
```
thus the patch needs work.
