Long exponents are silently truncated to word-size exponents:

```
sage: K.<x,y> = AA[]
sage: x^(2^64 + 12345)
x^12345
```

In one test, I also saw a crash, but I can't reproduce it.

```
sage: K.<x,y> = ZZ[]
sage: (x^12345)^54321


------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occured in SAGE.
...
```
(The crash was on 32-bit x86 Debian testing.  The first test fails with the same answer on both 32-bit and 64-bit x86.)

For the 2nd example, I do not get a crash, but a funny result with 3.1.4 on a 32-bit computer:

```
sage: K.<x,y> = ZZ[]
sage: (x^12345)^54321
x^28393*y^10232
```
Note that y does not appear in the input!

Possible explanation: 12345*54321 = 10232*2^16+28393.
Apparently the low 16 bits are used to store the exponent of x, and the upper 16 bits
for the exponent of y, but no check for overflow is done!!!

I tried on a 32-bit machine with vanilla 4.7.2. The first doctest is ok, for the second one I get:

```
sage: (x^12345)^54321
...
OverflowError: Exponent overflow (670592745).
```
thus the patch needs work.

Hmm, I wonder how big we can make the exponent. I was guessing `(2^31 - 1)`, but `670592745` is way smaller than that.

Since the crash was on a 32-bit machine, we can assume (i.e. hope) that it was due to the overflow. With that in mind, maybe we should just ignore the output with "..." and consider the test a success if it doesn't crash?
