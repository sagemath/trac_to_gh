Re the doctest failure on Clement's G5:

sage -t  devel/sage-main/sage/matrix/matrix_real_double_dense.pyx
**********************************************************************
File "matrix_real_double_dense.pyx", line 331:
    sage: ~A
Expected:
    [ 0.1  0.0]
    [ 0.0 0.01]
Got:
    [ 0.1 -0.0]
    [-0.0 0.01]
**********************************************************************
File "matrix_real_double_dense.pyx", line 349:
    sage: A.inverse()
Expected:
    [nan nan]
    [nan inf]
Got:
    [ nan  nan]
    [ nan -inf]
**********************************************************************

It is a sign issue, but I am not sure what we can do here.

Cheers,

Michael
