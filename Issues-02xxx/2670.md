See the numpy where() command or the matlab find() command:

http://www.scipy.org/NumPy_for_Matlab_Users

so:

```
sage: m=matrix([[1,2,],[3,4]])
sage: m>2
*returns matrix([[False,True],[True,True]])
```


Component: **linear algebra**

Do we want to mess with python's semantics for `__cmp__` here? I would rather not take that route and instead define a custom operator (like (`.>`)) to indicate element-wise comparison. 

Actually, there has been a thread related to element-wise operations on matrices in sage whichc could be part of a larger ticket.

Changing the original proposal, how about adding a find() method of a matrix that takes a boolean test and applies the boolean function to the entries of the matrix.

So in the above example,

```
sage: m=matrix([[1,2,],[3,4]])
sage: m.find(lambda x:x>2)
*returns matrix([[False,False],[True,True]])
```

A patch is up. Turns out you cannot create a matrix with True and False entries, so I returned one with entries in GF(2).
