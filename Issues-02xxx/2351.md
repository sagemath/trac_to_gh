This requires somehow updating the apache-ssl certificate on sage.math and restarting apachessl.  This happens in 

```
/etc/apache-ssl

<a id='comment:2'>**Comment 2:**</a>
From http://www.apache-ssl.org/

```
Now I've got my server installed, how do I create a test certificate?

Step one - create the key and request:

  openssl req -new > new.cert.csr

Step two - remove the passphrase from the key (optional):

  openssl rsa -in privkey.pem -out new.cert.key

Step three - convert request into signed cert:

   openssl x509 -in new.cert.csr -out new.cert.cert -req -signkey new.cert.key -days 365

The Apache-SSL directives that you need to use the resulting cert are:

  SSLCertificateFile /path/to/certs/new.cert.cert
  SSLCertificateKeyFile /path/to/certs/new.cert.key

How do I create a client certificate?

Step one - create a CA certificate/key pair, as above.

Step two - sign the client request with the CA key:

  openssl x509 -req -in client.cert.csr -out client.cert.cert -signkey my.CA.key -CA my.CA.cert -CAkey my.CA.key -CAcreateserial -days 365

Step three - issue the file 'client.cert.cert' to the requester.

The Apache-SSL directives that you need to validate against this cert are:

  SSLCACertificateFile /path/to/certs/my.CA.cert
  SSLVerifyClient 2
```

This is still a problem, at least according to Firefox 3.0b4:

```
Secure Connection Failed

sagenb.com uses an invalid security certificate.

The certificate is not trusted because it is self signed.
The certificate is only valid for www.sagenb.org.
The certificate expired on 02/20/2008 06:22 AM.

I still get after a clearing of the cache and a couple reloads:

```
www.sagenb.org uses an invalid security certificate.

The certificate is not trusted because it is self signed.
The certificate expired on 02/20/2008 06:22 AM.

(Error code: sec_error_expired_issuer_certificate)
```
Maybe you need to restart the webserver?

Well, I both points have been addressed:

* the certificate is now sigened by www.sagenb.org
* it no longer is expired

But since the certificate will expire a month after creation, i.e. 7/2/2008 we might want to create a certificate valid for longer than a months :)
