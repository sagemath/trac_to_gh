The certificate expired earlier in February 2008.

It seems that the certificate was only good for a month.

From http://www.apache-ssl.org/

```
Now I've got my server installed, how do I create a test certificate?

Step one - create the key and request:

  openssl req -new > new.cert.csr

Step two - remove the passphrase from the key (optional):

  openssl rsa -in privkey.pem -out new.cert.key

Step three - convert request into signed cert:

   openssl x509 -in new.cert.csr -out new.cert.cert -req -signkey new.cert.key -days 365

The Apache-SSL directives that you need to use the resulting cert are:

  SSLCertificateFile /path/to/certs/new.cert.cert
  SSLCertificateKeyFile /path/to/certs/new.cert.key

How do I create a client certificate?

Step one - create a CA certificate/key pair, as above.

Step two - sign the client request with the CA key:

  openssl x509 -req -in client.cert.csr -out client.cert.cert -signkey my.CA.key -CA my.CA.cert -CAkey my.CA.key -CAcreateserial -days 365

Step three - issue the file 'client.cert.cert' to the requester.

The Apache-SSL directives that you need to validate against this cert are:

  SSLCACertificateFile /path/to/certs/my.CA.cert
  SSLVerifyClient 2
```

I still get after a clearing of the cache and a couple reloads:

```
www.sagenb.org uses an invalid security certificate.

The certificate is not trusted because it is self signed.
The certificate expired on 02/20/2008 06:22 AM.

Maybe you need to restart the webserver?
