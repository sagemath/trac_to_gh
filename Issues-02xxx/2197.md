The code for quadratic, quartic and sextic twists of elliptic curves does not check that the twisting parameter is nonzero, and hence fail when a singular curve tries to be constructed.  Instead we output a helpful message.

Note that in characteristic 2, the quadratic twist by 0 is allowed (but gives back the same curve), just as twisting by 1 in odd characteristic.

The patch provided also enhances the Hasse_bounds function (which should probably be put somewhere other than ell_generic.py).
