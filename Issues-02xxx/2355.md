 The current implementation of the submatrix command could be easier to use given that matrix_from_rows_and_columns is nicely suited for this task; ie, this should just work

```
A.submatrix([1..2],[0..1])

Here's a patch that makes the following possible:

```
            sage: m=[(1, -2, -1, -1,9), (1, 8, 6, 2,2), (1, 1, -1, 1,4), (-1, 2, -2, -1,4)];M= matrix(m)
            sage: M
            [ 1 -2 -1 -1  9]
            [ 1  8  6  2  2]
            [ 1  1 -1  1  4]
            [-1  2 -2 -1  4]

            Get The 2 x 2 submatrix of M, starting at row index and column
            index 1
            sage: M[1:3,1:3]
            [ 8  6]
            [ 1 -1]

            Get the 2 x 3 submatrix of M starting at row index and column
            index 1:
            sage: M[1:3,[1..3]]
            [ 8  6  2]
            [ 1 -1  1]

            Get the second column of M:
            sage: M[1:,0]
            [ 1]
            [ 1]
            [-1]

            sage: M[range(2),:]
            [ 1 -2 -1 -1  9]
            [ 1  8  6  2  2]
            sage: M[range(2),4]
            [9]
            [2]

            [-1  2 -2 -1  4]
            sage: M[3,4]
            4

```

I have to register the obvious concern.  You've replaced what I wrote:

```
554	 	            if PyTuple_Size(key) != 2: 
555	 	                raise IndexError, "index must be an integer or pair of integers" 
556	 	            i = <object> PyTuple_GET_ITEM(key, 0) 
557	 	            j = <object> PyTuple_GET_ITEM(key, 1) 
```


by 

```
 	587	            s1 = key[0] 
 	588	            s2 = key[1] 
 	589	 
 	590	            if isinstance(s1,sage.rings.integer.Integer) and \ 
 	591	                   isinstance(s2,sage.rings.integer.Integer): 
 	592	                self.check_bounds(s1, s2) 
 	593	                return self.get_unsafe(s1, s2) 
```

If A is a matrix doing A[i,j] is a sort of "critical speed operation",
so I'm concerned about speed.    Thoughts? Benchmarks?

Replying to [was](#comment%3A4):

The new method is slower, but not by much (surprisingly for me):

```
# sage-main
sage: %timeit M[3,4]
10000 loops, best of 3: 69.5 µs per loop

#sage-getitem
sage: %timeit M[3,4]
10000 loops, best of 3: 71.2 µs per loop

#sage-main
sage: %timeit M[3:]
10000 loops, best of 3: 68.3 µs per loop

#sage-getitem
sage: %timeit M[3:]
10000 loops, best of 3: 69.5 µs per loop
```

```
#sage-getitem only
sage: %timeit M[:4,range(4)]
10000 loops, best of 3: 87.8 µs per loop

sage: %timeit M[3:,:4]
10000 loops, best of 3: 78.8 µs per loop

sage: %timeit M[3:,0]
10000 loops, best of 3: 74.1 µs per loop

```

matrix_from_rows_and_columns could also be made a little faster. I plan to post another ticket/patch for it.

Can't give this patch a positive review. After I applied it to a brand new sage-2.10.3
a lot of code seems to be broken.

I do not quite understand what is going on.

Didier,

please post only Mercurial patches. `hg export tip > foo.patch` works perfectly well. Bundles for single commits are a serious annoyance.

All tests pass on 2.10.3 here. 2.10.4rc0 obviously broke something so I'll wait until 2.10.4 is officially released to see what broke what.

I've lost some speed while working on this. I've optimized the code a bit. Overall, my version is still slower because I'm doing more type-checking and handling more functionality (I think that's the reason):

```
# M is the same as above

# element-by-element: slower by about 0.1 micro-seconds ~ 1.2x slower

#2355
sage: %timeit M[2,3]
1000000 loops, best of 3: 395 ns per loop

#main
sage: %timeit M[2,3]
1000000 loops, best of 3: 304 ns per loop

# single slices: slower by < 1 micro-seconds ~ 1.01x slower

#2355
sage: %timeit M[:4]
10000 loops, best of 3: 48 Âµs per loop

#main
sage: %timeit M[:4]
10000 loops, best of 3: 48.5 Âµs per loop

# Getting a whole row: faster by < 1 micro-seconds 
#2355 
sage: %timeit M[3]
10000 loops, best of 3: 72.2 µs per loop

#main
sage: %timeit M[3]
10000 loops, best of 3: 72.9 µs per loop
``` 

I'm not posting speed comparisons using the other cases (ie, `M[:3,2:]`) since sage doesn't handle them right now.

If people think this speed loss is unacceptable, I could try to fold the extra functionality into the `submatrix` method instead which would leave `__getitem__` idem. 


2355.patch is updated. Warning: I've added a new file: `ext/python_slice.pxi` to have fast access to slice objects so the patch is a bit heavy and rebuilds everything ( nearly everything depends on python.pxi). Passes all tests in `matrix/`.
