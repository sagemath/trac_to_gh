Indeed.

As documented.

[ Actually, I am going to change this: I don't see the point in defaulting
to a slow routine; let mathnf choose depending on the matrix size.
It should either call matdetint + mathnfmod, or mathnf(,1) ]

Actually, no; mathnfmod does that.

We do that, with one optimization too many which sometimes cancelled the
normalization step ( when the kernel is non trivial and we are "lucky":
a coefficient which we want to set to 0 is already 0 ).

It is fixed in both stable and unstable branches. I am attaching the
(trivial) patch.

Thanks for your report !
