The problem was that we were blindly adding the labels to edges, so if an edge didn't have a label, things went boom.

I added a default_weight option which will be applied when an edge doesn't have a weight.

Attachment: **[shortest-paths.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket2265/shortest-paths.patch.gz)**

I also added a by_weight option as vgermrk suggested to be consistent with the other shortest path functions.
