This is *very* easy to implement:

1. Make it so help is a wrapper around internal help.  (Already true?)

2. If in notebook then display the result using html and pre.  Done.



Component: **notebook**

The attached patch does this:

```

  1. Wrote new version of help command for the notebook.
  2. Slightly modified how truncation is done to account for 1.	 While I was at	it, I fixed another
     but where reloading a page would put multiple "output truncated" messages at the top of the page.

This is ugly -- scroll down:

```
help(interact)
```

I don't know if this is worth a fully negative review, but I think this looks like crap.  Perhaps a pre tag would make it all better?

I completely rewrote help(...) to address the referee remark and to make help(...) vastly more robust when the output is MASSIVE (which it often is).  Try, e.g., 

```
import numpy
help(numpy)
```

with the new version, and your browser will *not* get killed.  I had my browser
crash in class when teaching with the old version.

Of course the issues with help(interact) are also fixed. 

Apply both patches, in order.
