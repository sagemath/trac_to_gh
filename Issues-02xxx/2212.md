This corrects some errors/transpositions in the documentation of the various degree sequence functions.  It also removes the "seed" variable in DegreeSequence itself, as a main NetworkX developer confirmed what the NetworkX code suggests, that this is unnecessary (they have now removed it in their implementation).

Positive review pending a couple of suggestions:

1. In DegreeSequence, in the docs, it says "connecting vertices of highest to" and should probably read "connecting vertices of highest degree to"

2. DegreeSequenceExpected never does anything with the seed parameter.  Can you modify the call to networkx so that the seed is passed?

3. The docs for DegreeSequenceExpected contain the informational, but distracting, parenthetical remark about quantum graphs.  Can you delete that remark?

Responding in reverse order:

3. Whoever wrote the original documentation put that in there, so I left it, though I also found it distracting. Was there additional functionality expected?  So I'll remove it there and in another place it occurs, and if we ever support quantum graphs we can put it back in.  (I sheepishly admit I have never heard of quantum graphs.)

2. I didn't notice that, and will add the call, since NetworkX definitely has it.

1. I also left that alone because it was in the original documentation, but with the review I gladly change it.
