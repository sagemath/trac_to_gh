This corrects some errors/transpositions in the documentation of the various degree sequence functions.  It also removes the "seed" variable in DegreeSequence itself, as a main NetworkX developer confirmed what the NetworkX code suggests, that this is unnecessary (they have now removed it in their implementation).

Positive review pending a couple of suggestions:

1. In DegreeSequence, in the docs, it says "connecting vertices of highest to" and should probably read "connecting vertices of highest degree to"

2. DegreeSequenceExpected never does anything with the seed parameter.  Can you modify the call to networkx so that the seed is passed?

3. The docs for DegreeSequenceExpected contain the informational, but distracting, parenthetical remark about quantum graphs.  Can you delete that remark?
