The attached bundle does two things.
* makes `search_src` accept more extra arguments
* adds `search_def` to find the definition of a name in the Sage library.

The ugly patch is the result of a Python 2.6 bug.

This was all motivated by Craig Citro's post to `sage-devel` at http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/msg/82829f101a6e209b.

I definitely like the patch. Apparently Nick was channeling Tony the Tiger, though, because the "library" became "librrary" twice. The extra patch fixes that typo in two places.
