This actually causes massive memory leaks. I tried enlarging the mempool to 1024*1024 elements, but that seems like a rather crude band aid any may have performance implications.

Robert - can you have a look if you can fix this?

Cheers,

Michael

I should have some time to look at this tonight. I you were busy working on 1337 and wanted to jump in but had a pile of things I couldn't put off this weekend. 

Could one or both of you post a comment here bringing things up to date with what you figured out with #1337, I've read the patch but have to admit it's not very informative on what exactly is going on. 

In justification of the integer pool--the main performance gain is because integers are ephemeral objects, so even a pool of 100 integers is a huge gain as most of the time you have new/delete/new/delete/new/delete...

Line 3209 of integer.pyx

```
ONE = Integer(1)
```

It has refcount 2 when one quits. It gets overwritten in two dictionaries one dictionary, then two separate dictionaries that refer to it get deleted. 

Any easy fix is to cdef it or incref it, but that isn't what the real problem is.

Here is a fix--it doesn't crash any more for me (filling up the pool, whatever) or leak memory. 

Interestingly enough, David Roe increfs `ONE` in his `_val_unit` function (integer.pyx:1749) for no apparent reason. Hmm...
