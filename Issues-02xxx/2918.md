Scipy can optionally use umfpack for sparse solvers. We currently build umfpack as part of cvxopt. 
We don't make scipy use umfpack because the wrappers use swig. We need to autogenerate the swig wrappers so scipy can build against them without swig. 

Component: **numerical**

SciPy 0.7 is deprecating Umfpack support and moving it to a SciKit. It might be better to have an umfpack.spkg that also contains that new SciKit.

Cheers,

Michael

Since scipy 0.7 is now out I am not sure what to do about this? Make it invalid? Change the ticket so that we install an optional umfpack-scikit.spkg? 

Note that cvxopt already compiles umfpack for intenal use, so we might be able to reuse it.

Cheers,

Michael
