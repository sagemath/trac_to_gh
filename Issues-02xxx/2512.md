implement [condition number (wikipedia)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condition_number) for matrices. 

something like:

```
def condition(m,p=2):
    return norm(m.inverse(),p) * norm(m,p)
```

depends on #1763

**Assignee:** @williamstein

**Keywords:** matrix, condition number

Condition numbers for any norm can be expensive, since they involve computing the inverse of a matrix. If our matrix is singular, this is even worse. I would propose:
* Computing the condition number for norms 1,2,inf. This can be done reasonably efficiently in gsl and lapack

Is there any case that we would want compute a condition for norms other than 1,2 and inf? I'm curious

The patch implements a very simple .condition_number() method, based on a matrix's .norm() method. As such it only works for p = 1,2,Infinity or the Frobenius norm.

Suggestions/comments welcome. Written on sage 4.6.2.

Turns out Rob Beezer has implemented condition numbers by directly wrapping the NumPy cond() command in patch #10837.

Some timings:

Patch 2512:

```
sage: A = matrix([[1,2,4],[5,3,9],[7,8,6]])
sage: timeit('A.condition_number(2)')
125 loops, best of 3: 1.96 ms per loop
sage: timeit('A.condition_number(Infinity)')
625 loops, best of 3: 1.31 ms per loop
sage: timeit('A.condition_number("frob")')
625 loops, best of 3: 949 µs per loop

sage: A = MatrixSpace(CC,50).random_element()
sage: timeit('A.condition_number(2)')
5 loops, best of 3: 389 ms per loop
sage: timeit('A.condition_number(1)')
5 loops, best of 3: 380 ms per loop
sage: timeit('A.condition_number("frob")')
5 loops, best of 3: 358 ms per loop
```

Patch 10837:

```
sage: A = matrix(RDF,[[1,2,4],[5,3,9],[7,8,6]])
sage: timeit('A.condition(2)')
625 loops, best of 3: 282 µs per loop
sage: timeit('A.condition(Infinity)')
625 loops, best of 3: 123 µs per loop
sage: timeit('A.condition("frob")')
625 loops, best of 3: 203 µs per loop

sage: A = MatrixSpace(CDF,50).random_element()
sage: timeit('A.condition(1)')
625 loops, best of 3: 968 µs per loop
sage: timeit('A.condition(2)')
125 loops, best of 3: 2.97 ms per loop
sage: timeit('A.condition("frob")')
625 loops, best of 3: 942 µs per loop
```

I vote we go for Rob's patch.
