In the following:

```
sage: g=graphs.PetersenGraph()
sage: g.show3d()
```

the edges look messed up (some are darker and some are lighter and it changes as you rotate the graph).  Putting aspect_ratio=[1,1,1] fixes the problem:

```
sage: g=graphs.PetersenGraph()
sage: g.show3d(aspect_ratio=[1,1,1])
```

Might this be a duplicate of #2477, i.e. show3d vs. plot3d? This also has some overlap with #2100.

Cheers,

You're right, it's a dup of #2477.  I tried searching for a ticket, but didn't find that one (I was looking for show3d).

I've posted a review for that patch.
