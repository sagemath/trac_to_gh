```
sage: P.<x,y> = PolynomialRing(GF(2),2,order='degrevlex')
sage: x > y
True

sage: P.<x,y> = BooleanPolynomialRing(2,order='degrevlex')
sage: x > y
False
```

This should be changed because it leads to funny performance figures.

<div id="comment:2" align="right">comment:2</div>

I am not convinced the patch fixes the issue:

'dp' and 'Dp' refer to degrevlex and deglex respectively and in neither of those x < y.

```
sage: P.<x,y> = PolynomialRing(GF(2),order='degrevlex')
sage: x > y
True
sage: P.<x,y> = PolynomialRing(GF(2),order='deglex')
sage: x > y
True
```

However, there is a deglex with variables inverted ordering ib PolyBoRi which has no Singular/Sage equivalent AFAIK:

```
sage: B.<x,y> = BooleanPolynomialRing(2,order='deglex')
sage: x > y
True
sage: B.<x,y> = BooleanPolynomialRing(2,order='degrevlex')
sage: x > y
False
```

Attachment: **[2148-polybori-fix_degrevlex.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket2148/2148-polybori-fix_degrevlex.patch.gz)**

[attachment: 2148-polybori-fix_degrevlex.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket2148/2148-polybori-fix_degrevlex.patch.gz) arranges the variable indexes in the Sage - `PolyBoRi` interface to handle the difference between degrevlex and dp_asc orders.

Note that with this patch, printing is reversed when using dp_asc orders:

```
sage: P.<x,y,z> = BooleanPolynomialRing(3,order='degrevlex')
sage: x*y*z
z*y*x
sage: P.<x,y,z> = BooleanPolynomialRing(3,order='lex')
sage: x*y*z
x*y*z
```
