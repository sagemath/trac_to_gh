Sorry for the duplicate! I missed that. But I could not resist to send my patch!

What do you think?

Hi Jaap,
I'm willing to sacrifice a little elegance for speed gains. My function seems to be faster so far:

```
sage:  w = random_matrix(ZZ,2000,2000)

sage: %time w.matrix_from_rows_and_columns(range(1000),range(1300));
CPU times: user 0.42 s, sys: 0.13 s, total: 0.55 s
Wall time: 0.55

sage: %time w.matrix_from_rows_and_columns(range(1000),range(1300));
CPU times: user 0.48 s, sys: 0.05 s, total: 0.53 s
Wall time: 0.54

sage: %time w.matrix_from_rows_and_columns(range(1000),range(1300));
CPU times: user 0.49 s, sys: 0.05 s, total: 0.54 s
Wall time: 0.53
```

vs

```
Loading SAGE library. Current Mercurial branch is: jaap

sage:  w = random_matrix(ZZ,2000,2000)

sage: %time w.matrix_from_rows_and_columns(range(1000),range(1300));
CPU times: user 0.73 s, sys: 0.12 s, total: 0.84 s
Wall time: 0.84

sage: %time w.matrix_from_rows_and_columns(range(1000),range(1300));
CPU times: user 0.74 s, sys: 0.10 s, total: 0.84 s
Wall time: 0.84

sage: %time w.matrix_from_rows_and_columns(range(1000),range(1300));
CPU times: user 0.72 s, sys: 0.12 s, total: 0.84 s
Wall time: 0.83
```

All times are on sage.math. If you can do better, great :)

Ok, time is money. So I better give a positive review.

One question before I do so:
why not cdef i an j?

```
        cdef Py_ssize_t nrows, ncols,i,j,k,r

```

All test in deve/sage/sage/matrix passed.
