Done. As a remark: we eventually want to create a poset database similar to the graph
database. So these poset examples will be moved into the database.

Thank you!

There are a few other differences between the original patch and the new patch:

1. Added "or equal to" to the docstrings for is_gequal and is_lequal.

2. I redefined the show methods for FinitePoset and HasseDiagram. Before it
was just show = plot, but I since realized this is wrong: show should show the
Graphics object returned by the plot method.

3. Added the methods interval, closed_interval and open_interval to the FinitePoset
class. These already existed for the HasseDiagram class; so the new methods
just expose these methods from the FinitePoset class. It was an oversight not
to have done this originally.

4. I slightly modified HasseDiagram.antichains to return the empty list as an
antichain. And added tests.

Regarding `show` versus `plot`, you don't even really need a `show`: most Sage objects give LaTeX when you call `show`, and if you do `sage: P.plot()`, the graphics object will appear.

Also, it looks like you need both patches in order, right?

I'll leave it as is, as this is how it is implemented for Graphs/DiGraphs.
 
> Also, it looks like you need both patches in order, right?

Yes, I patched against the previous patch. I've corrected what I wrote.

I can provide a single patch instead if that is easier.
