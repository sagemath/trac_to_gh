<a id='comment:1'></a>This patch:
* fixes the stated bug.  To observe this try this input: 

```
try:
    1/0
finally:
    print "<html><b>hello</b></html>"
```
Note that the output has html properly formated at the top, etc.

* also fixes a bug when the traceback output is too long.  To 
verify this, try this input and wait a few seconds.  NOte that a link
appears as it should:

```
def f(n):
    f(n)

f(5)
```

* I'm sorry but providing doctests for this is just too hard at present, given that we don't have a good notebook testing framework just yet.  These bugs are pretty high priority imho.
