The following happens some of the time (though not always).  I'm guessing the fix is to
allow for more possibilities in the output?

```
sage@modular:~/build/sage-3.0.rc1$ ./sage -t devel/sage/sage/dsage/tests/testdoc.py
sage -t  devel/sage/sage/dsage/tests/testdoc.py             **********************************************************************
File "/home2/sage/build/sage-3.0.rc1/tmp/testdoc.py", line 46:
