We ought to check to make sure that twisted has the gzip filter enabled and is sending things in zip encoding when it can.

This needs to be optional; for local notebooks (where the notebook and web browser are running on the same machine), this would very likely slow things down.

I posted a new twisted spkg that contains needed modifications to make this work here:  http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jason/twisted-8.1.0.p2.spkg

The above patch, combined with this new spkg, makes it so that pretty much all javascript, java, css, and a few other things are sent over the network compressed when the receiving host is not 'localhost' or '127.0.0.1'.  It seems to cut the transfer down to about a third of what it was.

<div id="comment:7" align="right">Comment 7</div>

REFEREE REPORT:

I will give this a positive review when the following trivial things are all fixed. 

1. The spkg has a file in there that it shouldn't have in the root directory:

```
teragon-2:twisted-8.1.0.p2 wstein$ pwd
/Users/wstein/Desktop/twisted-8.1.0.p2
teragon-2:twisted-8.1.0.p2 wstein$ hg status
? gzip.py.patch
teragon-2:twisted-8.1.0.p2 wstein$ ls
SPKG.txt	gzip.py.patch	patches		spkg-install	src
```
Just delete it and remake the spkg.

The spkg itself compiles fine. 

That said, I'm confused as to what/where gzip.py.patch comes from.  Evidently mhansen wrote it.  It should probably be upstreamed?

2. There is a problem with SPKG.txt claiming mhansen did something, but actually Jason did:

```
20:26 < mhansen> How is this due to me?
20:26 < mhansen> I haven't seen this ticket before.
20:27 < jason--> the patch on the ticket just modifies twist.py
20:28 < ws-4636_2113> === twisted-8.1.0.p2 (Mike Hansen, October 18, 2008) === * Apply the patches to make the gzip filter deal 
                      with javascript mime types.
20:28 < ws-4636_2113> It's in SPKG.txt
20:28 < jason--> in the spkg that is on the ticket?
20:28 < ws-4636_2113> I think Jason Grout may have been impersonating you!
20:28 < mabshoff> And that is why we need SPKG.txt files
20:28 < jason--> is p1 from mhansen?
20:28 < jason--> (did I copy and not change something?)
20:28 < mabshoff> copy & paste?
20:28 < mhansen> I can't for the life of me remember doing that.
20:28 < ws-4636_2113> It's checked in by Jason.
20:29 < ws-4636_2113> So I think you didn't do it -- jason did.
```

3. The patch fails to apply, but almost applies:

```

Did gzip.patch get merged? On 3.3.alpha6, I don't see anything from that patch in twist.py, and I also don't see anything getting gzip'ed. When I apply the patch, I get some things, but not all, gzip encoded.

Also, on 3.3.alpha6, in spkg/installed, I see twisted-8.1.0.p1 and twisted-8.1.0.p2. Should there just be one there?

Yes, I am deleting p1 now. 

I guess this wasn't the best merge :(

Dan,

I checked my 3.3.rc0 merge tree and I only have twisted-8.1.0.p2.spkg, so if you upgraded it would explain why you might have twisted-8.1.0.p1.spkg also in tree. Maybe -bdist also killed the extra twisted.spkg, but I am too lazy to find out :)

Cheers,

Michael
