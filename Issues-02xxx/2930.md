The idea of generic pools is a good one, but I am pretty sure this implementation has rotted. 

Robert: Any take here about doing something generic for pools?

Thanks for pinging me. Yes, I've put some thought into making generic pools, just haven't had the time to actually implement anything. 

The ticket is still valid, but I don't think this patch (if it even passed test) is the way to go.

I have created a wish list ticket at #4673 so we have a clean start and something more generic, i.e. the ticket is about creating the infrastructure. Once that is there we can add tickets for the classes that have not been converted. 

As a consequence I am invalidating this ticket.
