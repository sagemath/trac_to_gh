Review:

Excellent.

About characteristic():  should not be hard to implement in at least one case:  Set c = self.base_ring().characteristic().  If c is prime then self's char is also p.  If c>0 but is not prime one could loop through divisors d of c to see if self(d)==self(0).   But if c==0 I cannot see an easy way of doing this.

About gens(): I agree that it is not nice having 0 in the list of gens, but deleting them would break the correspondance between the gens of R and the gens of R/I, which the user will probably expect.

I also noticed one thing which is not purely a docstring/test:  when R is a field you inserted a short-cut.  That looks fine to me.

Positive review, should be accepted.
