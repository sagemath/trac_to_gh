The proposed linbox-1.1.5rc1.p0 crashes on OS X 10.5-intel for charpoly computations.
The bug shows up at initialization of static variables, and may be related to the specific OS X gcc compiler behaviour.

[http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-bugs/2004-02/msg02055.html](http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-bugs/2004-02/msg02055.html), may help.

I fixed the bug by changing the algorithm for charpoly, that I had to change anyway (faster).
This fixes the bug, since the buggy code is no longer used.

The fixed spkg is available at
[http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/pernet/linbox-1.1.5rc2.p1.spkg](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/pernet/linbox-1.1.5rc2.p1.spkg)

The clean fix will be in ticket 2389.
