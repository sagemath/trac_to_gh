What is CC and CXX set to? This looks very fishy and is likely not the fault of Sage. Please report build issues to sage-devel and so not open ticket until it is clear if there is actually a bug in Sage.

Also:
* please provide the complete install.log
* do not attach compressed files to trac since those tend to cause problems

systemwide they are not set, in the -sh environment

```
$ ./sage -sh

Starting subshell with Sage environment variables set.
Be sure to exit when you are done and do not do anything
with other copies of Sage!


$/local/scratch/schilly/sage$ echo $CC
gcc
$/local/scratch/schilly/sage$ echo $CXX
g++

well, it looks like a scipy issue...

Sure, but now we are poking around here while it should happen on sage-devel :)

Yep, the recommended thing to do: gzip install.log and post a link to it where it can be downloaded.

Matplotlib also fails to build [at least the C++ bits - with the same issue, i.e. invoking "g++ gcc ...]. Even after exporting LANG=C the problem still happens. In this case  LANG is set to de_AT.UTF-8.
