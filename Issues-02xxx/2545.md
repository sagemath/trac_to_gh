Attached patch adds a `derivative` method to `FractionFieldElement`s, and fixes a bug in the `_derivative` method of `Polynomial_rational_dense`.

So these now work:

```
sage: R = ZZ['x']
sage: S = R.fraction_field(); x = S.gen()
sage: R(1).derivative(R(x))
0

sage: F = FractionField(PolynomialRing(RationalField(),'x,y'))
sage: x,y = F.gens()
sage: (1/(x+y)).derivative(x,y)
2/(x^3 + 3*x^2*y + 3*x*y^2 + y^3)
```

This appears to work as advertised.  I have one request: the docstrings for derivative() and _derivative() refer to "the derivative of this polynomial", which is bad since these elements are (most of the time) not polynomials.  This should be replaced with "rational function" or something similar.

You're right, I copied the text from the docstring for polynomials, and forgot to change it. :)

[attachment: 2545-sage_fraction_field_derivative-1.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket2545/2545-sage_fraction_field_derivative-1.patch.gz) replaces "polynomial" with "rational function" as suggested.
