Somebody (I don't want to name names; maybe it is me?) has completely
broken doctesting of user files, evidently.   There has
been a lot of changes made to the doctesting system
recently, and I don't know which thing caused the
above very serious problems.    Even doctesting a pure
.py file is broken!

teragon:.sage was$ more foo.py 
def foo(x):
   r"""
   Shows how doctests don't work.

   EXAMPLES:
       sage: 2+2
       5
       sage: foo(3)
       4
   """
   print(x)

teragon:.sage was$ sage -t foo.py
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
Total time for all tests: 0.0 seconds
