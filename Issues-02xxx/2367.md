This ticket is strongly related with ticket #2348. I fix here a doc test failure that is introduced by the patch from #2348, and the new functionality that i introduce here relies on the patch from #2348.

Problem: Let G be a finite matrix group. So far, G.invariant_generators() worked only if G was defined over the rationals or over GF(prime). 
Solution: Singular also provides simple algebraic extensions over these fields, so, it just requires a more careful definition of a singular ring inside the function.

After first applying the patch from #2348 and then applying the new patch, the doc tests of matrix_group.py should pass, and the following should work:

```
sage: F=CyclotomicField(8)
sage: z=F.gen()
sage: a=z+1/z
sage: b=z^2
sage: MS=MatrixSpace(F,2,2)
sage: g1=MS([[1/a,1/a],[1/a,-1/a]])
sage: g2=MS([[1,0],[0,b]])
sage: g3=MS([[b,0],[0,1]])
sage: G=MatrixGroup([g1,g2,g3])
sage: G.invariant_generators()
[x1^8 + 14*x1^4*x2^4 + x2^8,
 x1^24 + 10626/1025*x1^20*x2^4 + 735471/1025*x1^16*x2^8 + 2704156/1025*x1^12*x2^12 + 735471/1025*x1^8*x2^16 + 10626/1025*x1^4*x2^20 + x2^24]
```

The patches (first 2348 then this one) applied cleanly and the above code ran. However, sage -testall failed. Here is one failure:

This would be easy to fix of course but, for the failure I cannot recommend
acceptance at this time.

There were other failures,

on sage-devel for a clean install.

Clearly the doctest failure in matrix_group_element.py has a trivial fix: The doctest expects output that is incorrect as soon as one switches to an algebraic extension of the rationals:

> Expected:
>     `'[[Z(7)<sup>0,0*Z(7)],[0*Z(7),Z(7)</sup>2]]'`
> Got:
>     `'[[Z(7)<sup>0,0*Z(7)],[0*Z(7),Z(7)</sup>2]]*One(GF(7))'`

In gap:

```
gap> x:=Indeterminate(Rationals,"x");;
gap> p:=x^4+3*x^2+1;;
gap> e:=AlgebraicExtension(Rationals,p);
<algebraic extension over the Rationals of degree 4>
gap> M:=[[1,GeneratorsOfField(e)[1]^2]];
[ [ 1, (a^2) ] ]
gap> IsMatrix(M);
false
gap> IsMatrix(M*One(e));
true
```
Hence, in general the modified output is needed.

I think so, too. I am about to provide new patches for this ticket and for #2348.

Now i changed the patches of #2348 and of this ticket. So, a re-check is needed.

These three tests fail on my system as well - with and without the patches. So, it doesn't seem to be related.

But with the patches (that partially add further doc tests), the following clearly related tests pass:
* matrix_group.py
* matrix_group_element.py
* number_field.py
* number_field_element.pyx
* matrix1.pyx

<a id='comment:7'>Comment 7:</a>
This ticket, together with #2348, is now ticket #2395. First reason is that we got a new sage pre-release. Second reason is that my suggestions for fixing the gap interface (#2348) changed. Third reason is that #2348 and this ticket belong closely together, hence, they should be worked on in *one* ticket.
