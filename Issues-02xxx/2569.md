Since the preparser replaces "^" with "**",
there should be a way to access the python-buildin-XOR again.

The discussion is here: [http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/a7aaccd2081098bc/de225692ee38f0a5](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/a7aaccd2081098bc/de225692ee38f0a5)

The conclusion is:

```
Unless somebody thinks of something better, I like ^^ as well.

William
```



So the preparser should replace `^^` with `^`.
