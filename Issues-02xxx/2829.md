Patch looks good to me, but I have reject issues against my 3.0.alpha2 merge tree:

```
patching file sage/crypto/mq/sr.py
Hunk #25 FAILED at 599.
Hunk #26 FAILED at 615.
Hunk #28 succeeded at 655 with fuzz 2.
Hunk #48 FAILED at 1191.
Hunk #75 FAILED at 1776.
4 out of 95 hunks FAILED -- saving rejects to file sage/crypto/mq/sr.py.rej
```
One those issues are fixed I will apply.

Cheers,

Michael
