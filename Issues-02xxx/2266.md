I don't think we need to update `shortest_paths` as there already exists a method `shortest_path` which takes input `u` and `v` and outputs the single shortest path between them.

If the question is to get all shortest paths from u to v, then:
- For unweighted graphs, we have `all_paths_iterator` and `all_simple_paths` that list paths by increasing length and that accept as input an optional list of starting / ending nodes.
- For weighted graphs without negative edge weights, we have `shortest_simple_paths` that yields shortest simple paths from u to v by increasing weights. Non-simple paths should be treated in #28076.
- For graphs with negative weight cycles, the problem of finding a path in NP-hard. We can use ILP. We can do better if we have negative weight edges but no negative weight cycles.
