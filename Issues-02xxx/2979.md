Please see http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/was/build/sage-3.0.rc1/spkg/standard/clisp-2.41.p14.spkg
which at least sets up a simple way to do this.  It might not work though because of CFLAGS possibly being ignored by clisp's build system.

Do not use the spkg I suggested above.  It will just lead to the following error.  Throwing
in a make distclean to spkg-do-install would probably fix the problem though.  That said,
this will not fix the user's problem on the mailing list.  It fixes *some* users's problems
though (e.g., Martin Albrecht).

sage: An error occurred while installing clisp-2.41.p14
Please email sage-devel http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel
explaining the problem and send the relevant part of
of /home/zarathustra/Download/sage-3.0.rc1/install.log.  Describe your
computer, operating system, etc.
If you want to try to fix the problem, yourself *don't* just cd to
/home/zarathustra/Download/sage-3.0.rc1/spkg/build/clisp-2.41.p14 and
type 'make'.
Instead type "/home/zarathustra/Download/sage-3.0.rc1/sage -sh"
in order to set all environment variables correctly, then cd to
/home/zarathustra/Download/sage-3.0.rc1/spkg/build/clisp-2.41.p14
(When you are done debugging, you can type "exit" to leave the
subshell.)
You must set the SAGE_ROOT environment variable or
run this script from the SAGE_ROOT or
SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/ directory.
