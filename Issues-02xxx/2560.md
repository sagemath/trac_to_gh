In sage/elliptic_curves/sll_points.py in the function ` EllipticCurvePoint_finite_field.order()` a tiny blunder causes a huge inefficiency.  The BSGS function is used to find a multiple of the order of the point (when the group order is not yet known), and the existing code

```
                M = self._bsgs(E(0),0,ub)
```
should be

```
                M = self._bsgs(E(0),lb,ub)
```
since there is a loution in the interval [lb..ub].  This changes the complexity from `O(q^1/2)` to `O(q^1/4)`.
