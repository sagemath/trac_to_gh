This may be more of enhancement, but it would be nice to throw up an error message in the notebook if cookies are disabled in the browser.  

For example, I jumped on sagenb.org to try things out.  After logging in I started with nothing.  I clicked on "New Worksheet" to get started, and I get a "404 Not Found" error for the page /new_worksheet.  This seems an easy and natural place to tell the user they need to enable cookies in their browser.  Even better would be to check for the expected cookie in the "just logged in" page generation logic.

For completeness, most of the other links on the "just logged in" page just ask me to log in again.  (This is when I figured out the problem.  Originally I assumed the notebook must be broken.)  The "Upload" link gives me a corresponding 404 page, and "Log" and "Help" just open new, empty pages.  (Not particularly helpful when I tried it.)  I am using Firefox 2.0.0.12 on FreeBSD 6.3.

13:44 < tclemans> refresh the homepage?
13:44 < tclemans> *login page
13:44 < jason-> ah, works now.
13:45 < jason-> huh, so I disable cookies after logging in
13:45 < jason-> and get a "You are not logged in or do not have access to the
                worksheet '104'."
13:45 < jason-> not a cookie message
13:46 < tclemans> ok well I never meant to fix that issue basically on the
                  login page we set a test cookie and while login is being
                  processed we look for that cookie
13:46 < jason-> okay
13:46 < tclemans> and then that cookie is deleted after succesful login
