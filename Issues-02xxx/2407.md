# Issue 2407: Notebook fails without explanation when cookies are disabled

```
13:43 < jason-> okay, after getting the error, I reenabled cookies, but I still
                get the error.
13:44 < tclemans> refresh the homepage?
13:44 < tclemans> *login page
13:44 < jason-> ah, works now.
13:45 < jason-> huh, so I disable cookies after logging in
13:45 < jason-> and get a "You are not logged in or do not have access to the
                worksheet '104'."
13:45 < jason-> not a cookie message
13:46 < tclemans> ok well I never meant to fix that issue basically on the
                  login page we set a test cookie and while login is being
                  processed we look for that cookie
13:46 < jason-> okay
13:46 < tclemans> and then that cookie is deleted after succesful login

I applied all three patches to 3.1.3alpha1 and verified that the intended error message pops up trying to log in without cookies enabled.  I looked at the code and it looks like it might be reasonable, but I am not familiar with this specific section of the code base, so I might have missed something.

Tentative positive review, in that I verified from the user's standpoint the bug is fixed.
