One way to handle setting display options for different vertices/edges is to have the following conventions:

* If edge_style is the dictionary **edge_style, pass **edge_style into the arrow() commands
* If edge_style is a list, then we want to create (possibly different) edge_style dictionaries for each edge.  For each item in the list:
   * if the item is a dictionary d, then update all edge_style dictionaries with the dictionary d.
   * if the item is a list L with L[0]=list of edges, L[1]=dictionary d, then for each edge in L[0], update its edge_style with d.

Optimize this so that we create a dictionary for an edge iff it has a different edge style than other edges.  In other words, first have only one edge_style dictionary.  If a list is edges is then specified, then take those out of the default edge_list and update their dictionary, etc.  is there a data structure which efficiently partitions objects (maybe Sage partitions!?)

Do you consider #13827 as a ticket which aims at making all options of `Graph.plot` able to take [edge/vertex]-specific instructions? If so, could you update its description before setting this one to `positive_review`? Right now all the description of #13827 says is that it should be possible to provide an alternative text to the vertices' name.

Done that.
