Actually, Sage's mercurial does include the queue extension; it's just not enabled by default.

You can enable it by adding these lines to $HOME/.hgrc:

```
[extensions]
# patch queues for mercurial
# add the 'q*' commands
hgext.mq=
```

Debian enables the queue extension (along with many others) for its version of mercurial, using configuration files in /etc/mercurial.  I patched Sage's mercurial spkg to not look in /etc/mercurial, because Debian's configuration enabled extensions that were not included in Sage's mercurial, leading to annoying (although harmless) warning messages on every mercurial command.

So this bug could be resolved by:

1) tell everybody who cares to add the above lines to their .hgrc

2) patch Sage's mercurial to look in $SAGE_LOCAL/etc/mercurial, and install a default configuration there that enables queues

Aha, I had I thought I enabled it in .hgrc, but it turns out it was just in /etc/mercurial.  Thanks!

I like this suggestion, since "1) tell everybody ..." is always doomed to failure and frustration.
