Kill signal does this

```
2008/03/01 01:10 -0500 [-] Received SIGTERM, shutting down.
2008/03/01 01:10 -0500 [-] (Port 8000 Closed)
2008/03/01 01:10 -0500 [-] Stopping factory <twisted.web2.channel.http.HTTPFactory instance at 0x2a41530>
2008/03/01 01:10 -0500 [-] Main loop terminated.
2008/03/01 01:10 -0500 [-] Server Shut Down.
```

Control C does this

```
2008/03/01 01:12 -0500 [-] (Notebook cleanly saved. Press control-C again to exit.)
```

We should change the notebook so it catches the kill and saves the notebook cleanly.   I have no idea how to do this.  Maybe some sort of "hook" into Twisted.  If anybody knows twisted or reads the docs and figures this out, post here!

<a id='comment:2'></a>If you want to do things the twisted way, here is something that should work:

reactor.addSystemEventTrigger('before', 'shutdown', f)

f is a function you want to be called BEFORE the reactor shuts down.  Here is some more documentation about how to properly use this feature:
