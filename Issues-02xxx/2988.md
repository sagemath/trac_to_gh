It doesn't apply cleanly against rc1:

```
sage@modular:~/build/sage-3.0.rc1/devel/sage$ hg import /home2/mabshoff/trac_2988.patch
applying /home2/mabshoff/trac_2988.patch
patching file sage/server/notebook/cell.py
Hunk #1 FAILED at 645
1 out of 2 hunks FAILED -- saving rejects to file sage/server/notebook/cell.py.rej
abort: patch failed to apply
```

Cheers,

Michael
