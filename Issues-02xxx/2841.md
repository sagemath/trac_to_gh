Thank you!! On a new user account sage and its maxima worked
beautifully.

On my main account I found a folder called "SteuerfÃ¤lle" generated by
a governement-software for calculating the taxes in Switzerland... I
changed that -> issue gone.

Thank you very much, William. I'm looking forward to having a great
time with sage.

Perhaps the bug reporter has LANG set to an encoding that does not handle that particular file name; or perhaps LANG is not set, and en_US.UTF-8 does not work on that machine (or at least, that file name is not a valid UTF-8 string).

Suggesting that we might make a change to sage-env if this isn't a problem anymore.

```
# If the language encoding isn't set, set it to be US, since 
# Sage is currently mainly a US program, and leaving this off 
# leads to some really confusing errors -- see trac #276 
 
if [ "$LANG" = "" ]; then

fi  
``` 
But Sage isn't anywhere near as much mainly a US program now, and hopefully this problem isn't possible anymore?  I did create a folder called "SteuerfÃ¤lle" on my computer and that didn't cause problems, and LANG=en_US.UTF-8 still (even when I open a new terminal window).

So perhaps we should revert #276 - or at least close this ticket!

It appears that #2513 (changeset 1231:7ae8bf22920b in the scripts repository) has already reverted #276.

Should we wait for reports about non-ASCII file/folder names?

Hilarious!  Just goes to show that Sage is too big for any one person to know all about it - or at least to remember all tickets.
> Should we wait for reports about non-ASCII file/folder names?

No - this should be pointed out as fixed elsewhere and the ticket closed, imho.
> [Recent sage-devel thread](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/196b84684566ae59).

If you agree, then I would say just put a note to that effect on that thread.
