I'm not sure why you removed the doctest file, since after you remove `sage/server/misc.py` there are no doctests left in that directory :-) but surely it can't hurt.

However, this needs a slight bit of work to be compatible with https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb/pull/291 now in upstream.  Before:

```
sage: from sage.server.support import save_session
sage: save_session()
DeprecationWarning: 
Importing save_session from here is deprecated. If you need to use it, please import it directly from sagenb.misc.support
See http://trac.sagemath.org/2891 for details.

```
after:

```
sage: from sage.server.support import save_session
sage: save_session()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
AttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)
AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'save_session'
```
and likewise for `load_session` and `variables`, I believe.

Indeed, elsewhere. The idea of this ticket is that the `globals` parameter was moved from `InlineFortran.__init__()` to `InlineFortran.__call__()`.
