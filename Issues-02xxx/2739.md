I am not a SAGE user, but the sagemath.org website created the
impression that SAGE is just some kind of front end to other
packages.  I wanted to learn more about this system, but there is no
"About SAGE" link on the front page and the FAQ is not very
informative.

You are right! There is no 'about Sage' page on the web site.

Due to Harald Schilly's hard work we now have

http://sagemath.org/tour.html

which I consider a solution to the above ticket. So I am considering this issue resolved and should more specific issues be raised those should be done via new tickets.

Cheers,

Michael
