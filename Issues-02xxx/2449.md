This was #1322. 

Implement something like Mathematica's manipulate.

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/was/tmp/interact.png

There will be two patch bundles attached to this email; each a bundle that applies cleanly against sage-2.10.3.rc3.  One against scripts and one against the main sage repo. 

I will not put anything in the reference manual until this code has got some testing.

One suggestion is to have some builtin styles for an interact box. 
Maybe:
`@`interact(style='blue') or `@`interact(style='white') ...

Also I noticed that there is an empty white area above a plot in an interact box.

This is specifically listed as a post 1.0 enhancement in interact.py and
I will not modify the current patch to do that.  More likely, I will leave
that to somebody else to do after this is released.

> Also I think type=blah should be added to all of the standard 
> controls not just input_box.


That doesn't make sense because input_box is the only control where
the code creating the control hasn't already determined the type
by their input.  E.g., for buttons, sliders, etc., one is giving
the types by the input that creates the widget.

> (1) It would be nice if the box wasn't refreshed when I hit a button. 


What box?  I don't understand this at all.

> (2) When I pick say a color for the polygon I want the polygon 
> to be that color throughout until changed again by me using 
> the polygon button and color picker.


Isn't that exactly what happens?

That should be a widget style option, which should be made 
by somebody else *after* the initial release of interact.  
It shouldn't be on by default because it would clutter the interface.

<a id='comment:16'></a>The commentary for example one in the documentation says that a slider will be the control for the y variable, but I get a dropdown menu.

I find the difference in font color and background between the interact box as a whole and the output area inside it annoying.

I would like there to be a str type option for the other controls, so I don't see quote marks in say button names.
