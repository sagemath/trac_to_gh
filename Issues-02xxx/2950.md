If point3d is called with 3 points and the first point is a vector, there is a strange error. The first three calls below work, the forth should work, but it does not (tested on sage.math, version 2.11):

```
sage: from sage.plot.plot3d.all import line3d, point3d
sage: pl = point3d([(1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), (-1, -1, 0)])
sage: pl = point3d([(1, 0, 0), vector(ZZ,(0, 1, 0)), (-1, -1, 0)])
sage: pl = point3d([vector(ZZ,(1, 0, 0)), (-1, -1, 0)])
sage: pl = point3d([vector(ZZ,(1, 0, 0)), vector(ZZ,(0, 1, 0)), (-1, -1, 0)])
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: float() argument must be a string or a number
```
