I've attached my changeset that causes all writes that occur when running doctests to be written inside SAGE_TESTDIR.

One thing I'm uncertain about is what should happen with the line
"cat $SAGE_TESTLOG >> $SAGE_ROOT/test.log".

At the moment, I leave it in, and there's an error at the end of the block of tests.  I would recommend removing it and just making $SAGE_ROOT/test.log be a symlink to $SAGE_ROOT/tmp/test.log in the default SAGE install.

**Assignee:** failure

**Resolution:** fixed

There is a small reject due to #2621 having been merged, but after resolving the merge conflict both patches apply cleanly. I am doing some more extensive testing before giving this a positive review, but so far things look good.

Cheers,

If SAGE_TEST is empty things go wrong. I have attached a patch that fixes the issue. Positive review since this is useful "as-is". A couple suggestions for a follow up patch:
 
* make sure that SAGE_TEST is writable
* delete the .doctest file once the doctest finishes
* document SAGE_TEST :)

Cheers,

Michael
