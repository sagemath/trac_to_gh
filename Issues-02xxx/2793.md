In the Python tutorial (http://docs.python.org/tut/node5.html#SECTION005120000000000000000)
 there's an example of making a string:

```
>>> "\"Yes,\" he said."
'"Yes," he said.'
```

This fails in Sage because of the preparser!

```
sage: "\"Yes,\" he said."
------------------------------------------------------------
   File "<ipython console>", line 1
     "\"Yes,._backslash_()" he said."
                             ^
<type 'exceptions.SyntaxError'>: invalid syntax
```

This is obviously a bug in the _backslash_ or "in quotes" part of the preparser.  So it's almost certainly my fault.
