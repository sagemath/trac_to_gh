I've attached essentially the code I wrote during with Sage Days 24 with some additions. Features include:

* Representation of PFQs as symbolic functions (with automatic simplification) and in always-unevaluated form

* Numerical evaluation (wrapping mpmath)

* Evaluation in terms of elementary functions in some simple cases

Important missing features include:

* Rewriting symbolic sums as PFQs

* Evaluation in terms of polygamma functions

* Various transformations permitting closed-form evaluation in special cases

The patch includes symbolic versions of Bessel functions, which can be expanded as PFQs. This obviously needs to be merged with the existing Bessel function classes.

The main remaining issue is to handle multivariate symbolic functions properly (the current approach in Function_PFQ is something of a hack). Also, in the present patch, there are two PFQ classes. This is partially due to limitations/awkwardness of the symbolic function class, but regardless of whether necessary, it may be desirable to have a separate "backend" representation for hypergeometric functions that doesn't need to be concerned with automatic evaluation, numerical conversions, etc. I'm not sure what's the best way to organize it all.

Another strange doctest failure is the one in `_fast_callable_`; when I run it from interactive mode I get `{CommutativeRings.element_class}(v_0)`, but the doctest returns `{Fields.element_class}(v_0)`. Why is that?

Other than that the patch should be ready for review.

Oops, sorry.
> I got the plotting problem before too, see comment 17. It's something in the `fast_callable` implementation if I recall correctly, but I couldn't figure out how to fix it at the time.

`exp_integral_e()` is a `BuiltinFunction` too, and needs two parameters but

```
sage: f=fast_callable(exp_integral_e(x,1),domain=CDF,expect_one_var=True)
sage: f(8)
0.0452114820619
sage: f=fast_callable(hypergeometric([x], [], y),domain=CDF,vars=[x,y])
sage: f(8,9)
5.96046447754e-08
sage: f=fast_callable(hypergeometric([x], [], 2),domain=CDF,vars=[x])
sage: f(8)
1.0
```
so I changed 

```
        f = fast_callable(f, domain=CDF, expect_one_var=TRUE)
```
to

```
        f = fast_callable(f, domain=CDF, vars=[x])
```
in `complex_plot()`. Now the one var case works but not the two etc. So it seems the handling of `expect_one_var` in `fast_callable()` is wrong, as I already said.

What's certain is that `Wrapper_cdf.__call__()` gets the same arguments as with other working examples but that `SR._call_element_()` gets called where the deprecation warning happens while with `exp_integral_e(x,1)` its `_eval_()` is called directly.
> Another strange doctest failure is the one in `_fast_callable_`; when I run it from interactive mode I get `{CommutativeRings.element_class}(v_0)`, but the doctest returns `{Fields.element_class}(v_0)`. Why is that?

Interestingly if use `h=exp_integral_e(x,1)` in the same doctest, I get

```
sage: h._fast_callable_(etb)
{exp_integral_e}(v_0, 1)
```
So why is it not `hypergeometric(None, None, v_0)` or similar in the doctest?

Excellent work! I wasn't able to checkout the branch here for testing, but I noticed one thing for the maxima_lib interfacing:
- You are installing an extra rule in `mqapply_to_sage`, which I assume is correct. This rule registered in the special_max_to_sage dictionary: Great! that's what you're supposed to do
- However, for conversion back, there should be a corresponding entry in special_sage_to_max as well, and you're not adding that. You'd have to test, but from the rule in the other direction, I'd guess it should be something like:

```
sage.functions.hypergeometric.hypergeometric : lambda A, B, X : [[mqapply],[[max_hyper, max_array],lisp_length(A)-1,lisp_length(B)-1],A,B,X]
```
where

```
lisp_length=EclObject('length')
```

If you don't put this rule in place, you'll find that things like "limit", "integral" and "sum" (which use `sr_to_max`) will probably not work correctly with hypergeometric function. (in fact, I'm not so sure maxima has much support for them anyway, but at least we should make sure that the functions can survive a round-trip)

Another bit: the addition to `sr_to_max`

```
+ elif op == tuple:
+     return maxima(expr.operands()).ecl()
```
should read

```
+ elif op == tuple:
+     return EclObject( ([mlist],(sr_to_max(op) for op in expr.operands())) )
```
if a "symbolic tuple" should indeed be translated into a maxima list.

(the branch attached to this ticket currently doesn't build to a usable executable for me. I'm having some libntl conflict)

It is a consequence of `hypergeometric` being a SE with tuples as parameter. In the`Expression` constructor the class gets changed using `dynamic_class()` and this appears to be responsible.

Overall, all long tests pass and I see no reason to hold this old ticket any longer.

OK, the problem is in `ext.fast_callable.function_name`, which gets called by `sage.ext.fast_callable.ExpressionCall.__repr__`. with as argument the "function" component of the ExpressionCall. The problem is: an expression doesn't have a `__name__`. So you end up finding a `__name__` somewhere higher in the inheritance. You just end up putting an extraneous attribute on the expression. To illustrate the nasty side-effect:

```
sage: h =  hypergeometric([],[],x)
sage: h.__name__
'CommutativeRings.element_class'
sage: from sage.ext.fast_callable import ExpressionTreeBuilder
sage: etb = ExpressionTreeBuilder(vars=['x'])
sage: _ = h._fast_callable_(etb)
sage: h.__name__
'hypergeometric((), (), x)'
```
As you see, `_fast_callable_` now has a side-effect on `h`! 

A better solution would be to adapt the routine `ext.fast_callable.function_name` (or the way it gets used). It's clear you're now feeding it things it wasn't designed for.

What about

```
+ if isinstance(fn, Expression) and str(type(fn)).find('Expression_with_dynamic_methods') >= 0:
+     return "{%r}" % fn
```
Alternatively this seems to work too:

```
+ if isinstance(type(h),sage.structure.dynamic_class.DynamicMetaclass)
+     return "{%r}" % fn
```
Wouldn't one of these be safe enough?

I think the distinction should be easier to make. I don't think `__name__` is reasonable on any expression. Compare:

```
sage: h = hypergeometric([], [], x)
sage: s = sin(x)
sage: from sage.ext.fast_callable import ExpressionTreeBuilder
sage: etb = ExpressionTreeBuilder(vars=['x'])
sage: v = h._fast_callable_(etb)
sage: w = s._fast_callable_(etb)
sage: type(v.function())
<class 'sage.functions.hypergeometric.Expression_with_dynamic_methods'>
sage: type(w.function())
<class 'sage.functions.trig.Function_sin'>
```
As you can see, with more traditional functions, there's a rather more dedicated object in the function slot, for which the `__name__` can be expected to be quite descriptive. For an expression, the `__name__` attribute, if there's something there at all (and that there is seems a side-effect of the dynamic classes. Normally, `__name__` doesn't descend to class instances), can't really be descriptive. Looking at how to tell them apart:

```
sage: type(v.function()).mro()
[sage.functions.hypergeometric.Expression_with_dynamic_methods,
 sage.symbolic.expression.Expression,
 sage.structure.element.CommutativeRingElement,
 sage.structure.element.RingElement,
 sage.structure.element.ModuleElement,
 sage.structure.element.Element,
 sage.structure.sage_object.SageObject,
 object]
sage: type(w.function()).mro()
[sage.functions.trig.Function_sin,
 sage.symbolic.function.GinacFunction,
 sage.symbolic.function.BuiltinFunction,
 sage.symbolic.function.Function,
 sage.structure.sage_object.SageObject,
 object]
```
So my guess is that you only need `isinstance(type(h), sage.symbolic.expression.Expression)`, no need to check for substrings. On the other hand, your `sage.structure.dynamic_class.DynamicMetaclass` seems to work too, even though that class doesn't show up in the mro!

I think we're running into a break-down of ducktyping here: the code as written previously assumed that if a `__name__` attribute is present, then it's meaningful. This is apparently not true for some dynamic classes and makes me think that maybe this `__name__` attribute shouldn't be provided (wherever that happens).

```
I have no idea why. There appears to be no circular import. It can also be triggered with

```
sage: from sage.calculus.calculus import symbolic_expression_from_maxima_string
sage: symbolic_expression_from_maxima_string('hypergeometric')
```
but that specific instance goes away when I import non-lazily at function level. Local import does not resolve the docbuild error.

So, back as global non-lazy import into `functions/all.py`?

Thanks for sticking with it to make this a reality!

Does this fix either of the two remaining examples at #9908 (see [comment:11:ticket:9908 here])?  No worries about putting them here, but if so then we can mark that as an easy-to-fix ticket.

Does anybody remember why this `inspect.ismethod` condition was added here to the deprecation from #5930? I mean, either something is deprecated or not. It shouldn't depend on some very subtle condition like the type of the `_fast_callable_` attribute.

```python
            import inspect
            if not hasattr(_the_element,'_fast_callable_') or not inspect.ismethod(_the_element._fast_callable_):
                # only warn if _the_element is not dynamic
                from sage.misc.superseded import deprecation
                deprecation(5930, "Substitution using function-call syntax and unnamed arguments is deprecated and will be removed from a future release of Sage; you can use named arguments instead, like EXPR(x=..., y=...)")
