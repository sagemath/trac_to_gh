There are two problems:

1. neither use _fast_float

2. Even worse, they don't coerce their endpoints to floats.  This is a killer.

To illustrate:

```
var('x,y')
sage: time contour_plot(x^2+y^2, (-pi,pi),(-pi,pi))
takes forever
sage: time contour_plot(x^2+y^2, (-float(pi),float(pi)),(-float(pi),float(pi)))
takes forever
sage: f = (x^2+y^2)._fast_float_('x','y')
sage: time contour_plot(f, (-float(pi),float(pi)),(-float(pi),float(pi)))
CPU times: user 0.00 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.00 s
```
