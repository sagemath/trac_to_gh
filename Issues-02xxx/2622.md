polybori-refman-sage.patch looks good to me: One small typo did sneak in: "This quptient ring"

polybori-refman-doc.patch ought to be rebased since it has some unrelated changes included:

```
patch -p1 --dry-run < polybori-refman-doc.patch\?format\=raw
patching file .hgtags
Hunk #1 FAILED at 122.
1 out of 1 hunk FAILED -- saving rejects to file .hgtags.rej

That is odd because I started with a vanilla doc repository. But I'll rebase.

For the record: That was my 2.11.alpha0 build on sage.math which has a binary in /home/mabshoff/release-cycles-2.11/. I can throw out the hunks from the patch that are already there. 

Another small issue I forgot: Are we going with Gröbner now or will be stick with Groebner. Since we merged your various UTF-8 patches all those should work. Umlaute über alles!

Mike Hansen will be reviewing the other patches in this series, so they should be merged tonight assuming the get positive reviews.

Cheers,

Michael
