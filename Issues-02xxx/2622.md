polybori-refman-sage.patch looks good to me: One small typo did sneak in: "This quptient ring"

polybori-refman-doc.patch ought to be rebased since it has some unrelated changes included:

```
patch -p1 --dry-run < polybori-refman-doc.patch\?format\=raw

Hunk #1 FAILED at 122.
1 out of 1 hunk FAILED -- saving rejects to file .hgtags.rej

For the record: That was my 2.11.alpha0 build on sage.math which has a binary in /home/mabshoff/release-cycles-2.11/. I can throw out the hunks from the patch that are already there. 

Another small issue I forgot: Are we going with Gröbner now or will be stick with Groebner. Since we merged your various UTF-8 patches all those should work. Umlaute über alles!

Mike Hansen will be reviewing the other patches in this series, so they should be merged tonight assuming the get positive reviews.
