Something *very* weird is going on here.  Here is something that I think is causing the problem with a.eigenvalues above:

```
sage: from sage.calculus.calculus import SymbolicVariable
sage: tmp=SymbolicVariable('tmp_var')
sage: a=matrix(SR,[[1,2],[3,4]])
sage: a.charpoly(tmp).expand().solve(tmp)
[]
sage: (tmp^2+2*tmp).solve(tmp)
[]
sage: tmp=SymbolicVariable('tmp_var')
sage: (tmp^2+2*tmp).solve(tmp)
[tmp_var == -2, tmp_var == 0]
sage:
Exiting SAGE (CPU time 0m0.13s, Wall time 0m46.43s).
Exiting spawned Maxima process.
Exiting spawned Maxima process.
```

The suspicious thing is the *two* maxima processes that are exiting when I exit sage.

The key part here seems to be that 
sage: a=matrix(SR,[[1,2],[3,4]])
sage: a.charpoly(x).solve(x)
[]
while
sage: x._maxima_()
x
sage: a=matrix(SR,[[1,2],[3,4]])
sage: a.charpoly(x).solve(x)
[x == (5 - sqrt(33))/2, x == (sqrt(33) + 5)/2]

In fact, we may manually reproduce this behavior by 
sage: x._maxima_(maxima)sage: a=matrix(SR,[[1,2],[3,4]])
sage: a.charpoly(x).solve(x)
[]

It follows the likely cause is then not importing maxima from calculus somewhere and using instead the global maxima for a calculation involving charpoly.
