From IRC #sage-devel

```
<mhansen> jaap: There's a difference between sloane.A000001?? and sage.combinat.sloane_functions.A000001??
<jaap> mhansen sage: sloane.A000001??
<jaap> Error getting source: arg is not a module, class, method, function, traceback, frame, or code object
<mhansen> jaap: A bit earlier I had said that  sloane.A000001?? doesn't work because of the way the sloane object works.
<jaap> ok, but how about the OEIS user who wants to see how things work?
<mhansen> If it's a bug, then it should be reported.
<jaap> I think so
```



```
sage: sloane.A000045
 Fibonacci numbers with index n >= 0

sage: sloane.A000045?

sage: sloane.A000045??
Error getting source: arg is not a module, class, method, function, traceback, frame, or code object

sage: sage.combinat.sloane_functions.A000045??

works ok.


```

That this doesn't work should be considered a bug.   The actual introspection is simply some python code I wrote, so it's fixable.  Nick also knows something about it.
