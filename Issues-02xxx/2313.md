No.

If you delete spkg/standard then the dependency system will get completely confused
and rebuild all of Sage from scratch.

If you use the following script you can shrink all the files to be empty, and everything
will work fine:

login@sage:~$ more /usr/local/bin/shrink 
#!/usr/bin/env python

import os

for F in os.listdir('.'):
    print F
    if F.endswith('.spkg'):
       open(F,'w').close()

The main issue is that the build system was written when there were
3 Sage users in the whole world, and issues like this weren't our
top priority.   Nobody ever got around to dealing with this.  I'm not
going to immediately suggest the right fix, since there are several options
and I'd rather people discuss them.
