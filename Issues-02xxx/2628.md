A key advantage of notebook interfaces over the command-line is that they can allow for literate programming, that is, interspersing of formated text and code.  Literate programming  allows the user to explore their ideas both in theory and code simultaneously, and is particularly useful in mathematics were writing comments in pure ASCII is cumbersome and distracting.   Moreover, literate notebooks can be used as record of a computation (e.g. as the basis for an appendix to a paper), as an interactive tutorial for Sage, or for education (e.g. a calculus notebook using the "interact" feature to explore quadric surfaces).   Both Mathematica and Maple have extensive literate programming features. 

A simple way to provide this in Sage would be to have input cells of type "%latex" and "%html" behave as follows.  

1) After (successfully) evaluating such a cell, the input would be hidden and only the output would be shown.  This output would be shifted to the left compared to where it is now so that the Sage input/output is indented relative to the text.  

2) To edit, the user would (double?) click on the output and the input box would reappear.  

See the attached files for an example worksheet with mock-up of output.

Overlap with SageTeX:

Dan Drake's excellent SageTeX also provides literate programming for Sage.   In practice, this is rather different than what is proposed here.   In particular, SageTeX is awkward to use to write Sage code in compared to the notebook because because of the multi-step (latex/sage/latex) process.   The strength of SageTeX is the quality of the final output and the fact that you have the whole of LaTeX to work with.   It would be nice if the notebook was able to export a SageTeX file.  (cf. Ticket #66)
