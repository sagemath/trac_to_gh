Expected:

Got:
    0.647385390948634
```

Note that the later 100 input is totally ignored.  I think this is due
to some use of scipy or something for some special functions by David
Joyner recently??

Yes. The correct syntax is bessel_K(3,2,"pari",100):
sage: bessel_K(3,2,"pari",100)
0.64738539094863415315923557097
I ran "sage -t" on the file - I guess I should have run "sage -testall" also,
to find things like this.

You should just make pari the default algorithm, which would fix the issue in all other files.

Cheers,

As I see it. pari is the default:
def bessel_K(nu,z,alg="pari",prec=53):
I must be missing something obvious or else const.tex needs to change.

sage: bessel_K(3,2,"pari",100)
0.64738539094863415315923557097
sage: bessel_K(3,2,prec=100)
0.64738539094863415315923557097
sage: bessel_K(3,2,100)
0.647385390948634

I'm happy to be corrected but it seems to me that the patch is okay,
it's just that it's broken const.tex.
