```
Various people worked on factorization.py and unfortunately ignored some implicit 
assumptions in what that code is supposed to do.  In particular, this function

```
    def base_ring(self):
        if len(self) > 0:
            return self[0][0].parent()
        else:
            return self.unit().parent()
```
assumes that (1) ever element has the same parent, and (2) the parent is a ring.
Neither assumption need be satisfied.   

This is_commutative function then relies on base_ring working.  
Here's an example of this leading to *wrong* answers:

```
sage: R.<x,y> = FreeAlgebra(QQ,2)
sage: Factorization([(3,1), (x,2), (y,3), (x,1), (y,2)])
3 * x^3 * y^5
```

Proposal: Simply call Sequence on the list of bases in the factorization
to get a new list where the basis lie in a common university.  Then refine
is_commutative to mean that the universe is a commuative ring, and only then
commute factors automatically.

Second, after the above is resolved, the sort function for comparison 
should call universe() (not base_ring) and use some sensible defaults,
before resorting to that mess of code in the current sort method.

Looking at factorization.py I was all ready to fix all the problems I could see -- using Sequence to get a common universe for the bases on construction, cache this base_ring, only allow operations between factorizations with the same base_ring, and so on.

But then I saw what appeared to be a totally weird example:

```
sage: F = Factorization([(ZZ^3, 2), (ZZ^2, 5)], cr=True); F
(Ambient free module of rank 2 over the principal ideal domain Integer Ring)^5 * 
(Ambient free module of rank 3 over the principal ideal domain Integer Ring)^2            
```
This bears no relation at all to what I thought the Factorization class was for.  Doing a search_src showed that this is designed in to support splitting of modular symbols spaces (and similar).

This leaves a question almost certainly for William:  is it really sensible to have one class serve both as the structure to hold "prime factorizations" for UFDs and other rings, as well as to hold lists of subspaces with multiplicities?

If so, perhaps we need to refactor this to have a base class which just handles the basics, with (at least) 2 derived classes, one for rings factorizations and one for additive decompositions?

\# I have added this posting to trac#2460 too.

I think the issues raised here have all been dealt with by the patches I put up at #3927 (which started out as a separate enhancement, hence the new ticket).  In particular the good parts of the patch attached to this ticket have been used there.

I suggest that this ticket be closed, with a link to #3927 instead.

I think that this can be closed as well due to #3927.
