Here are two examples of two different types of errors. If you have lots of memory, I suppose that you might need to make figsize bigger.

(The following takes place on a 32-bit Core Duo with 2 gigs of ram.)

```
sage: P = plot(sin(x))
sage: P.show(figsize=[200,200])
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::bad_alloc'
  what():  std::bad_alloc

Loading SAGE library. Current Mercurial branch is: graph_embeddings
sage: P = plot(sin(x))
sage: P.show(figsize[1000,1000])
------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occured in SAGE.
This probably occured because a *compiled* component
of SAGE has a bug in it (typically accessing invalid memory)
or is not properly wrapped with _sig_on, _sig_off.
You might want to run SAGE under gdb with 'sage -gdb' to debug this.
SAGE will now terminate (sorry).

The problems occur in matplotlib.

The first example fails in backend_agg.cpp, around line 246, where some giant arrays fail to be allocated.

The second problem starts from somewhere in agg_pixfmt_rgba.h. For me it crashes on line 1708, which is

                p = (value_type*)m_rbuf->next_row(p);

I'm not sure where that memory is [not] allocated.
