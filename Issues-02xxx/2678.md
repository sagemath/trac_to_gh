There are some canonical coercions that one *should* have in the context
of modular forms that aren't there, probably partly because this whole "canonical
coercions" business was after I wrote the modular forms code.  Here's
an example bug (=lack of a coercion that should be there):

sage: b=CuspForms(22).basis()
sage: sum(b, b[0].parent()(0))
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
<type 'exceptions.TypeError'>             Traceback (most recent call last)
