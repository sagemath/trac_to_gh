The gmp.spkg fails to build on gcc 4.3 [at least we cannot link properly against it] due to some changes to the inline handling as well as missing std::FILE issues. The spkg at

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mabshoff/release-cycles-3.0/alpha5/gmp-4.2.1.p14.spkg

fixes that by slightly patching gmp-h.in.

To test build gmp, then FLINT for example since gmp by itself builds fine ;) - imagine my excitement debugging the problem. 

Cheers,

Michael
