symmetrica.kostka_tab([[2,2],[1]],[2,1])

evaluating this expression leads to the error message:

Exception exceptions.TypeError: 'an integer is required' in
'sage.libs.symmetrica.symmetrica._op_integer' ignored
Exception exceptions.TypeError: 'an integer is required' in
'sage.libs.symmetrica.symmetrica._op_integer' ignored
------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occured in SAGE.
This probably occured because a *compiled* component
of SAGE has a bug in it (typically accessing invalid memory)
or is not properly wrapped with _sig_on, _sig_off.
You might want to run SAGE under gdb with 'sage -gdb' to debug this.
SAGE will now terminate (sorry).
