<a id='comment:2'>Comment 2:</a>
In https://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/d88bc7503638af0c Robert Bradshaw commented:

```
The line3d command will produce much faster arrows:

line3d([(0,0,0), (1,2,3)], thickness=2, arrow_head=True)

The ds parameter is supposed to relate the size of the overall scene  
to the number of pixels in the final render. I agree there needs to  
be a better way to set it. 
```

Cheers,

Michael

Works great for me. A good example of this is

sage: sum([arrow3d((cos(t),sin(t),0),(cos(t),sin(t),t/10)) for t in [0,0.3,..,2*pi]])
