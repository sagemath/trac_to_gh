From: Andrey Novoseltsev
Subject: [sage-devel] Cell splitting/merging in notebook


Is it possible to realize some convenient and fast (in the sense of
keyboard use) cell splitting/merging? It seems to me that now it
involves manual copying of a part of code and creating/removing a
cell, or editing the text representation. I really liked the ability
to do it in Maple (back when I was using it ;-) by pressing some hot
keys since it allows you to group cells for executing in one step and
nicer visual presentation or break them back when you want to interact
with intermediate values.
```

Hi Tom,

In OS X firefox I tried this patch and it is really broken.  Splitting cells does absolutely nothing.  Joining works, but puts the active focus in the wrong cell. 

I'll see if I can fix it.
