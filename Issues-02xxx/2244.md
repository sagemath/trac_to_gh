Williams patch looks good to me, but I slightly changed the wording of his examples to specify that the *initial* sample points were the things guaranteed to be consistent.

I also added a small type-cast to the adaptive code to be consistent with the code above for regular sample points.

No, it doesn't, at least for me:

```
sage$ patch -p1 --dry-run < trac_2244-nowiggle.patch 
patching file sage/plot/plot.py
Hunk #1 FAILED at 3284.
Hunk #2 succeeded at 3421 with fuzz 2 (offset -11 lines).
Hunk #3 succeeded at 3445 (offset -12 lines).
1 out of 3 hunks FAILED -- saving rejects to file sage/plot/plot.py.rej
```
I checked for hunk one in plot.py and it just isn't there. Maybe this patch depends on another patch to be applied first?
