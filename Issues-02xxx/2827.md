Maybe we should change sage -notebook so that it works like this:

```
sage -notebook "(secure=True, address='sage.math.washington.edu', accounts=False)"
```

where anything in quotes is valid Python.  What do you think?

Some recent work went in in this area? Can someone still reproduce this or is this ticket invalid?

Cheers,

This seems quite reasonable to me. I also remember Dr. Kirkby's problem with specifying server_pool using `sage -n`.
