Maybe we should change sage -notebook so that it works like this:

```
sage -notebook "(secure=True, address='sage.math.washington.edu', accounts=False)"
```

where anything in quotes is valid Python.  What do you think?

Some recent work went in in this area? Can someone still reproduce this or is this ticket invalid?
