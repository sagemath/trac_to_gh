For non-monic polynomials, the discriminant method introduced in #2392 returns values in the fraction field of the base ring, instead of in the base ring.

```
sage: R.<y> = QQ[]
sage: S.<x> = R[]
sage: (x*y+x+y+1).discriminant()
1
sage: (x*y+x+y+1).discriminant().parent()
Fraction Field of Univariate Polynomial Ring in y over Rational Field
```

This is due to the fact that discriminants are computed via resultants, using a formula that sometimes divides the resultant by the leading coefficient.  When the coefficients are themselves polynomials, this makes the result appear in the fraction field.
