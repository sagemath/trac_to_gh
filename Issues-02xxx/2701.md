The attached patch fixes two bugs - one in spectrum and one in zeta_polynomial, both of which either failed or behaved badly for codes over non-prime fields.I also added som doctests for non-prime fields. 

It passes sage -testall except for plot.py and polynomial_modn_dense_ntl.pyx. (I reran sage -t on polynomial_modn_dense_ntl.pyx and it passed the second time.) I think these have nothing to do with the patch but here are the details:

the new patch fixes a doctest failure. Mathematically those two polynomials are mathematically equivalent, but can you confirm that this is the correct fix.
