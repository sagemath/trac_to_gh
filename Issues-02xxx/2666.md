There is still the plan to make this part of standard Sage, just like SageTeX, so I am changing the summary to reflect this even though this was not the original motivation for this ticket.

Just FYI, sage-mode is in the meantime at least an optional spkg.  See also:
* [the optional spkg list](http://sagemath.org/packages/optional/)
* [the sage-mode on the wiki](http://wiki.sagemath.org/sage-mode)

I think that Ivan Andrus is currently taking over for sage-mode responsibilities?
