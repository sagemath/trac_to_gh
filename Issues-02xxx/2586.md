I'm sure this is a dupe, but couldn't find a ticket.  It might need fixing at an awful lot of places... but polynomials are a start:

```
sage: ZZ['a']['b']([0, ZZ['a'].0])
a*b
sage: latex(ZZ['a']['b']([0, ZZ['a'].0]))
ab
```

Some people might not think this is a problem.  This definitely is:

```
sage: latex(ZZ['alpha']['b']([0, ZZ['alpha'].0]))
\alphab
```

I agree that this is a bug and I think the ticket you are referring to is the one where we discussed removing `\cdot`.

Actually, it's not due to #384: that only touched the symbolic expressions, and you can check that the code puts spaces where \cdot's used to be.

But it does happen in a few places in the polynomials code.  I believe the patch fixes all of them.  In particular, Nick's examples now work properly.

This (un)broke a bunch of doctests, so I've fixed them as well.  See also the doc patch with a small fix to const.tex due to these changes.
