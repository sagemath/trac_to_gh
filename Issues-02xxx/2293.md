```
sage: sage: A.<a,b,c,d,e> = AbelianGroup(5,[4, 5, 5, 7, 8])
sage: wp = word_problem([a,b,c,d,e],a); wp
[[a, 1]]
```
is okay but all these are wrong:

```
sage: wp = word_problem([a,b,c,d,e],b); wp
[[a, 1]]
sage: wp = word_problem([a,b,c,d,e],c); wp
[[a, 1]]
sage: wp = word_problem([a,b,c,d,e],d); wp
[[a, 1]]
sage: wp = word_problem([a,b,c,d,e],e); wp
[[a, 1]]
```
