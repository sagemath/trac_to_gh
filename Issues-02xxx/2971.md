Hi Dan,

That is by design, and the other polynomial rings work that way as well.

```
sage: R = PolynomialRing(QQ,'x',3)
sage: x0
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
<type 'exceptions.NameError'>             Traceback (most recent call last)

/opt/sage-3.0.alpha6/devel/sage-839/<ipython console> in <module>()

<type 'exceptions.NameError'>: name 'x0' is not defined
```

You can use the .inject_variables() method to get access to the variables.

```
sage: R.inject_variables()
Defining x0, x1, x2
sage: x0
x0
```
