The attached patch does the following:

1. allow coercing a 2x2 matrix (or a list of 4 elements) into a congruence subgroup: Gamma0(5)([1,5,1,6]) now works

2. modified G.generators() so that it actually returns a list of elements of the group G instead of just matrices

3. added gens()

4. added a bunch of doctests

Right now, all these changes are for Gamma0 and Gamma1 subgroups; I will do the same with GammaH subgroups as soon as I figure out how these work.

Patch looks good, doctests are good too.

I hate the name `acton` -- it looks like a typoed `action`.  Could we change that to `act_on`?
