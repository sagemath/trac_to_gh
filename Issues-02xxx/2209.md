<div id="comment:12" align="right">Comment 12</div>

I skimmed Steve Linton's patch from 

 http://www.gap-system.org/Faq/Hardware-OS/hardware-os8.html

then applied it and tested it on itanium.  It worked perfectly, and also gave a nice 5 times speed up on the first thing I tried:

```
sage: G = SymmetricGroup(16)
sage: h = G.normal_subgroups()
```

I doctested the groups directory, and have started the doctest cycle on everything else.
I'll post a note here when that is done.
