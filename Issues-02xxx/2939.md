Jim Morrow reported by private email some nonsense in the docstrings of several piecewise.py functions. These are now fixed. Also, I added 2 lines to the laplace function which allows it to compute with functions which are defined over an infinite interval. These 2 lines were the only code changes in this patch, the rest of the changes are docstring fixes and additions.
