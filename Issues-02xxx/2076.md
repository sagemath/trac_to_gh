When I call, 

sage: point(((1,1), (2,2), (3,3)), rgbcolor=hue(1), pointsize=30)

I expect to get a plot of 3 red points, but (1,1) is plotted as dark red and the other two points are blue.  So far I've only been able to recreate this issue when only three points are in the tuple.  The rgbcolor value doesn't seem to affect the color of the three plotted points.

I hope to look at the code soon.

I propose the following:

1. We upgrade from `matplotlib-0.91.1` to the latest verison, whatever it is.

2. If this doesn't fix the problem, report it to the matplotlib list.

3. If that doesn't work, fix the problem !?  Or program around it.

Jason,

since you now have a 3.1.2 can you do the final review on this? I can run doctests without a problem on 3.1.3.alpha1 to see if anything breaks. 

Cheers,

Michael
