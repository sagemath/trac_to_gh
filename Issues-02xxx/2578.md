I wanted to verify that Sage could symbolically compute the derivative
of Bn(x), the nth Bernoulli polynomial in (x): Dx[Bn(x)]=n*Bn-1(x).
The following code causes Sage to lockup:

```
Bn = bernoulli_polynomial(x,n)
```

The command "bernpoly(x,n)" in Maxima does not lock up but Maxima
will not compute symbolically.

```
sage: B3 = bernoulli_polynomial(x,3)
sage: B4 = bernoulli_polynomial(x,4)
sage: DxB4 = diff(B4,x)
sage: print expand(DxB4-4*B3)
                                      0
sage: Bn = bernoulli_polynomial(x,n)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...

I forgot to define (n) as a variable in the above session.
Now, Sage does not lockup but instead gives the traceback.

```
var('y,x,n')
y = bernoulli_polynomial(x,n)

Exception (click to the left for traceback):
...
