<a id='comment:3'></a>The returned output is correct, so it should be included in the doctest.

"99 points" should be replaced with "...", I think, since sometimes it will be "100 points" (due to random shifts in the points).  We could just set randomize=False, but that would make for a more confusing example, I think.
