In combinat/root_system.py, the fundamental weights for the various root systems are entered by hand. For G2, the fundamental weights were the negatives of what they should be.

Quoting from the email to sage-devel:

```
I should have added some justification for this conclusion
in the trac report. Instead I'm giving it here. You can
look the weights up in Bourbaki, Lie Groups and Lie
Algebras Ch 4-6 (Appendix) and you can also check
the inner products of the weights with the simple
roots (which are correct). The inner product of
the i-th fundamental weight with the j-th simple
root should be positive if i=j and zero otherwise.
I checked that all the other root systems are right
by examining the output following program on the ambient
lattices. This change had no effect on the output of
the Weyl dimension formula.

def test_lattice(L):
   rank = L.ct[1]
   roots = L.simple_roots()
   weights = L.fundamental_weights()
      return [[i,j, roots[i].inner_product(weights[j])] for i in range(rank) for j in range(rank)]
```

I am happy with this (small!) change.
