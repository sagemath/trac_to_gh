It is still possible to very occassionaly throw off the Maxima synchronization, maybe during parallel doctesting (?).  E.g.,

```
sage -t  devel/sage-main/sage/calculus/functional.py        **********************************************************************
File "functional.py", line 301:
    sage: limit((tan(sin(x)) - sin(tan(x)))/x^7, taylor=True, x=0)
Expected:
    1/30
Got:
    1820214126
**********************************************************************
1 items had failures:
   1 of   7 in __main__.example_4
***Test Failed*** 1 failures.
For whitespace errors
```

The above is particularly bad since you can't tell something went wrong -- you just
get a wrong number out.  The point of this ticket isn't to fix the whole problem.
Instead, change the synchronization marker in maxima.py from being a single number
to a string such as 

    __SAGE_SYNCHRO_MARKER_1820214126

so that instead of people being confused by a wrong answer, it will be
crystal clear that something went wrong. 

This will likely be nearly trivial to implement.
