The optional ace-5.0.spkg for the GAP component fails to install.  It tries to copy itself into the non-existent directory of GAP version 4.4.9 instead of the current version 4.4.10.

This can be fixed by changing line 3 of the spkg-install file to:

```
DEST="$SAGE_LOCAL"/lib/gap-4.4.10/pkg/
```

However, as mabshoff says:

''The proper fix in this  would be to use a variety of "newest_version". Right now it doesn't 
return the proper version you need: ''

```
$SAGE_ROOT/spkg/standard$ ./newest_version gap 
gap-4.4.10.p5 
```
*but after some discussion in debian-sage it now seems likely that we will switch to dashes for the patch level. *

I have uploaded a slightly updated spkg into the repo. It adds a mercurial repo and an .hgignore file. I also renamed it to ace-5.0.p0.spkg since changes to existing packages need to increment the patch level. Otherwise updates are not installed.

The new spkg installs, so positive review.

Cheers,

Michael
