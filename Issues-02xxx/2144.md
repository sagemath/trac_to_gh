Trying to use hex constants in SAGE as I usually do in Python, I ran into a small issue: the following should work, but does not:

```
sage: 0x23^0x42
------------------------------------------------------------
   File "<ipython console>", line 1
     Integer(0)x23**Integer(0)x42
                 ^
<type 'exceptions.SyntaxError'>: invalid syntax
```

I was told on #sage-devel that this is due to the preparser. A work around is to use `0rx23^0rx42` instead. However, according to william_stein, 0x23 should work as well and result in an Integer and 0x23r should be treated as an int.

Keywords: **preparser hex constants**

The preparse *is* important enough to be doctests.  I certainly don't
consider that to not be the case.  Any new code in Sage should get a negative review if there is any reasonable way to test that it fixes the claimed issue, but the patch doesn't actually test this fix explicitly. 

So shis should not have been closed without a doctest.  I've attached 
a patch that does that.

It turns out that:

  (1) this is a dupe of #37, and

  (2) it doesn't even work!  I stupidly didn't test with interesting inputs, and with them the patch by robertwb fails.  E.g.,

```
sage: 0x10
16
sage: 0xa
------------------------------------------------------------
   File "<ipython console>", line 1
     Integer(0x)a
                ^
<type 'exceptions.SyntaxError'>: invalid syntax
```

Fortunately, I have attached a patch to #37 that really fixes
the problem.
