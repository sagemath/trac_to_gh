Check this out:

```
sage: A = Matrix(RDF, [[1, 0], [0, 0]])
sage: A.inverse()

[nan nan]
[nan inf]
```

This is, to say the least, weird.  This should throw a ZeroDivisionError instead.

I don't see why a ZeroDivisionError should be thrown. Note that Matlab doesn't complain either:

```
>> a = [1 0; 0 0];
>> inv(a)
Warning: Matrix is singular to working precision.

ans =

   Inf   Inf
   Inf   Inf
```

I agree with dfdeshom.  The relevant code that does the inverse is

```
result_invert = gsl_linalg_LU_invert(self._LU,self._p,M._matrix)
```

Note that 1/RDF(0) also doesn't give ZeroDivisionError:

```
sage: 1/RDF(0)
inf
```

So I think that (1) this ticket should be resolved with a patch
that simply adds a doctest with this nan/inf behavior and says
what the deal is in the docs.

Very nice! Before the patch:

I will add a doctest patch for this bug since it is currently missing.

Cheers,

Ok, I now figured out that you also added a doctest for the bug you fixed. So disregard my comment about adding a doctest.
