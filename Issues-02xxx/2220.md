The problem here is that x is triggering a an error in the
irreducibility test, which is a little bizarre since of course x is
irreducible.

So the real issue is: why is x allowed to determine an absolute number
field (base Q) but not a relative one?  My guess is that this is a
side-effect of the differing code being used to test irreducibility in
the two cases,

Personally, I think that trivial extensions should be allowed and
treated just as non-trivial ones.  I have recently had to define
extensions of the ring ZZ, and find this awkward:

sage: R=ZZ.extension(x^2+5,'a')
sage: R.gens()
[1, a]
sage: S=ZZ.extension(x+5,'b')
sage: S.gens()
[1]

In the latter case I need S to remember the polynomial used to
generaite it and would expect its gens() to include (in this case) -5.

On the same topic, R and S above have no defining_polynomial() method.
 I'll try to fix that if it looks easy.

As was pointed out (by was I think), the gens() for an extension of ZZ are ZZ-module generators, n in number for an extension of degree n.  For example:

```
sage: R.<a>=ZZ.extension(x^3-2)
sage: R
Order in Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^3 - 2
sage: R.gens()
[1, a, a^2]
```

This is quite clear in the docstring "returns module generators of this order" and so requires no action.

For examples such as this, I said that the following would be convenient to access more directly:

```
sage: R.fraction_field().gen()
a
sage: R.fraction_field().defining_polynomial()
x^3 - 2
```

However, objects of the type or R here <class 'sage.rings.number_field.order.AbsoluteOrder'>  might be created in more complicated ways so that they do not have one natural defining polynomial or (ring) generator.  In fact one immediately finds this:

```
sage: R.ring_generators()
[a]
```
and the docstring for ring_generators() gives an example for which more than one generator is needed (remember that not every order is of the form Z[a] for some a), so it makes no sense at all, in general, to define methods gen() or ring_gen() or defining_polynomial() for general orders.

All this leaves from the original post is to work out why the specific polynomial x is not handled consistently.  The rest is perfect as it is.  Well done to the authors (was and robertb) for doing a good job, well documented!
