I consider the following bug critical, because it completely corrupts the Singular interface. However, it seems that the error only occurs on very few machines - so far, only one other person can reproduce the bug - see discussions at http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support/browse_thread/thread/5006f9a839723e27?hl=en

Creating a univariate polynomial ring R over the rationals, computing the resultant of two polynomials in that ring and using the gap interface for the Integers makes the singular interface fail on R (on some machines). To be precise:

```
sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
sage: f = x^3 + x + 1;  g = x^3 - x - 1
sage: r = f.resultant(g)
sage: gap(ZZ)
Integers
sage: singular(R).typeof()    # this should yield 'ring' !
print(sage8);
sage: singular(R).name()   # this is correct ...
'sage0'
sage: singular('sage0')   # ... hence, this should return a ring - but it doesn't
print(sage9);
sage: singular('sage0')
print(sage10);
sage: singular('sage0')
print(sage11);
```

Note that computing the resultant is important. If i replace it with, say, `singular(R)`, then the error does not occur. Also, if `gap(ZZ)` is done *before* computing the resultant, the error does not occur.

David Joyner observed that on both machines showing that error, there is an rpm based Linux. However, i know a machine with the same Linux that does not show that error.
Again, see http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support/browse_thread/thread/5006f9a839723e27?hl=en

> I consider the following bug critical, because it completely corrupts the Singular interface. However, it seems that the error only occurs on very few machines ...

Meanwhile, i found a very similar error that even occurs on sage.math with sage 2.10.2:

```
sage: R.<x> = QQ[] 
sage: f = x^3 + x + 1;  g = x^3 - x - 1 
sage:  r = f.resultant(g) 
sage: gap(ZZ) 
Integers 
sage: singular(R) 

sage: singular(R) 
//   characteristic : 0 
//   number of vars : 1 
//        block   1 : ordering lp 
//                  : names    x 
//        block   2 : ordering C 
sage: singular(R).typeof() 

sage: singular(R).typeof() 

sage: singular(R).name() 
'sage0' 
sage: singular('sage0') 

sage: singular('sage0') 

```
So, after computing resultant and calling gap, the first singular(R) has empty output, but the second (and following) display a ring. Calling typeof on that ring repeatedly has empty output. And although `sage0` is the name of singular(R), calling singular('sage0') has empty output.

I hope this is sufficiently reproducible for tracking down the problem.

I was just trying the above example that used to fail on sage.math with sage-2.10.2

It works on sage.math with sage-2.10.3!! So, many thanks to the person who did (accidentally?) fix the bug.

Now i am looking forward to test it on my machine, but this will take a while.

Exactly the same happens on my machine, with AMD Athlon 64 and openSUSE 10.2.

Something different happens on sage.math, but it is still nonsense:

```
sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
sage: f = x^3 + x + 1;  g = x^3 - x - 1
sage: r = f.resultant(g)
sage: gap(ZZ)
Integers
sage: singular(R).typeof()

sage: singular(R).name()
'sage0'
sage: singular('sage0')

sage: singular('sage0')

sage: singular(R)

//   characteristic : 0
//   number of vars : 1
//        block   1 : ordering lp
//                  : names    x
//        block   2 : ordering C
```

Hence, singular('sage0') and singular(R).typeof() have no visible output.

```
perhaps you noticed that i had found a version of the weird bug
"resultant+gap+singular=nonsense" even on sage.math, as i reported in
ticket #2419.

That was for sage-2.10.2; but the problem has vanished for sage-2.10.3 --
at least on sage.math, i am curious what will happen on my machine. [[it survives there]]

Do you have any idea how the problem was fixed (or whom i should ask)?
```

That was my message off trac to William. Apparently i was too optimistic: What i posted above *did* (and still does) happen on sage.math *after* writing my message to William. 

Hopefully it is reproducible for you.

Hi William!

The patch applies cleanly, and it solves the problem on my machine!

So, many thanks for the great job!

On sage-support you mentioned that the patch would slow down the interface considerably. Is there a way to know when synchronization is really needed? Perhaps, if the synchronization would not be done before *each* command, it were faster.

Hi!

Since my premature hooray was causing some trouble, i try to excuse with a few doc tests: See the patch that i am about to attach, which should be applied after William's patch. Also i have a couple of questions/remarks.

Questions/Remarks:
* Example for _crash_msg: I don't know if that example is platform dependent, since i use os.kill(singular.pid(),9) -- probably you know a more elegant way to kill singular on purpose. Also, it fails on `sage -t` because the error message "Singular crashed -- automatically restarting." is considered as output. 
  - I'd like to show the error message to the user, but i don't want that `sage -t` expects it as output. How can i do so?
* I didn't find out what _expect_expr is supposed to do. Similarly to what is done in _synchronize, I tried without success:

```
sage: singular._sendstr('2+3;')
sage: singular._expect_expr(timeout=0.5)
``` 
* Also i don't find a reasonable example for _interrupt.

I found that bug since doc tests for my patch from #2420 failed. Thus i expected that William's synchronization patch would fix #2420 as well, but it didn't -- see my comments there.

I'll try to boil down the new problem, but i suspect that a synchronization will be needed for the gap interface as well.

Hi!

So far, there was no feedback on my doc-tests, and no explanation about what _expect_expr is supposed to do. 

Concerning testing: I used Williams patch for extensive computations in a program that makes (small) use of the gap interface and *heavy* use of the singular interface. It didn't crash, which indicates that it may work. 

I am not sure: Is this enough for giving a "positive review pending; more doctests needed"?

Yes.  Given how the patch is written if it works in practice it
is definitely worth including in Sage.  

I can't work on this now unfortunately due to lack of time.
