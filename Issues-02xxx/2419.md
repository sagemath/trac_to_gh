I consider the following bug critical, because it completely corrupts the Singular interface. However, it seems that the error only occurs on very few machines - so far, only one other person can reproduce the bug - see discussions at http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support/browse_thread/thread/5006f9a839723e27?hl=en

Creating a univariate polynomial ring R over the rationals, computing the resultant of two polynomials in that ring and using the gap interface for the Integers makes the singular interface fail on R (on some machines). To be precise:

```
sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
sage: f = x^3 + x + 1;  g = x^3 - x - 1
sage: r = f.resultant(g)
sage: gap(ZZ)
Integers
sage: singular(R).typeof()    # this should yield 'ring' !
print(sage8);
sage: singular(R).name()   # this is correct ...
'sage0'
sage: singular('sage0')   # ... hence, this should return a ring - but it doesn't
print(sage9);
sage: singular('sage0')
print(sage10);
sage: singular('sage0')
print(sage11);
```

Note that computing the resultant is important. If i replace it with, say, `singular(R)`, then the error does not occur. Also, if `gap(ZZ)` is done *before* computing the resultant, the error does not occur.

David Joyner observed that on both machines showing that error, there is an rpm based Linux. However, i know a machine with the same Linux that does not show that error.

Meanwhile, i found a very similar error that even occurs on sage.math with sage 2.10.2:

```
sage: R.<x> = QQ[] 
sage: f = x^3 + x + 1;  g = x^3 - x - 1 
sage:  r = f.resultant(g) 
sage: gap(ZZ) 
Integers 
sage: singular(R) 

sage: singular(R) 
//   characteristic : 0 
//   number of vars : 1 
//        block   1 : ordering lp 
//                  : names    x 
//        block   2 : ordering C 
sage: singular(R).typeof() 

sage: singular(R).typeof() 

sage: singular(R).name() 
'sage0' 
sage: singular('sage0') 

sage: singular('sage0') 

```
So, after computing resultant and calling gap, the first singular(R) has empty output, but the second (and following) display a ring. Calling typeof on that ring repeatedly has empty output. And although `sage0` is the name of singular(R), calling singular('sage0') has empty output.

I hope this is sufficiently reproducible for tracking down the problem.

I was just trying the above example that used to fail on sage.math with sage-2.10.2

It works on sage.math with sage-2.10.3!! So, many thanks to the person who did (accidentally?) fix the bug.

Now i am looking forward to test it on my machine, but this will take a while.

Although the problem vanished on sage.math, it is still present on my machine. Is there anyone out there who can reproduce it?

Something different happens on sage.math, but it is still nonsense:

That was my message off trac to William. Apparently i was too optimistic: What i posted above *did* (and still does) happen on sage.math *after* writing my message to William.

Hi William!

The patch applies cleanly, and it solves the problem on my machine!

So, many thanks for the great job!

On sage-support you mentioned that the patch would slow down the interface considerably. Is there a way to know when synchronization is really needed? Perhaps, if the synchronization would not be done before *each* command, it were faster.

30% isn't so bad, and it's only a LATENCY issue really, i.e., if you
do 

```
  singular('something that takes some actual time on the singular side')
```
then it makes almost no difference.  

> is really needed? Perhaps, if the synchronization would not be done

But then it wouldn't always work, which defeats the whole purpose, which
is "rock solid robustness".

Hi!

Since my premature hooray was causing some trouble, i try to excuse with a few doc tests: See the patch that i am about to attach, which should be applied after William's patch. Also i have a couple of questions/remarks.

Questions/Remarks:
* Example for _crash_msg: I don't know if that example is platform dependent, since i use os.kill(singular.pid(),9) -- probably you know a more elegant way to kill singular on purpose. Also, it fails on `sage -t` because the error message "Singular crashed -- automatically restarting." is considered as output. 
  - I'd like to show the error message to the user, but i don't want that `sage -t` expects it as output. How can i do so?
* I didn't find out what _expect_expr is supposed to do. Similarly to what is done in _synchronize, I tried without success:

```
sage: singular._sendstr('2+3;')
sage: singular._expect_expr(timeout=0.5)
``` 
* Also i don't find a reasonable example for _interrupt.

Sorry, i have not been at work for a while. According to William's remark, i give a "positive review pending; more doctests needed". However, i could only provide more doctests if someone tells me about the use of _expect_expr. Also, i don't know how to deal with printed output in a doctest -- this concerns my example for _crash_msg.
