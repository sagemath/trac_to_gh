This patch adds support to solve norm equations via PARI. 

Quick summary: given an element `x` of any number field (even `QQ`), `x.is_norm(L)` will return `True` if and only if `x` is a norm from `L`. It is also able to return an element of `L` whose norm is `x`. 

The data used by PARI to compute whether or not an element is a norm can be computed once for each extension `L/K`. The function `pari_rnfnorm_data` computes exactly this, and hopefully in a later version its result can be passed to `is_norm` to avoid recomputing it each time in the case that `K != QQ`. If `K` is `QQ`, there is no need to save any such data -- the only data needed is that of `K.pari_bnf()`, which is used instead, and is already cached by `K`.

I have some questions.

There seems to be two things in this patch: changes to pari/gen, and access to stuff to do with norms.  Is the latter independent of the former?  I'd be a lot happier with the latter if that's true, because I'm not expert in the Pari interface.

Also, what relation does this have to "elements_of_norm"?  There needs to be some unification, I think.  Also, having is_norm() not always return a boolean is not good, IMO.  I say is_norm -> Boolean and element_of_norm raises an exception if is_norm is not True.

I will gladly referee and have cc'ed myself.

The remainder of the functionality requires some more substantial changes and is a work in progress.

 This patch adds support to solve norm equations via Pari. 
 
-Quick summary: given an element `x` of any number field (even `QQ`), `x.is_norm(L)` will return `False` if `x` is not a norm from `L`, and if `x` is a norm from `L`, will return an element of `L` whose norm is `x`. 
+Quick summary: given an element `x` of any number field (even `QQ`), `x.is_norm(L)` will return `True` if and only if `x` is a norm from `L`. It is also able to return an element of `L` whose norm is `x`. 
 
-According to the Pari documentation, these functions depend on GRH when `L/K` is not known to be Galois, and work independent of any such hypothesis otherwise (at least, that's what I got from reading the Pari manual). 
-
-The data used by Pari to compute whether or not an element is a norm can be computed once for each extension `L/K`. The function `pari_rnfnorm_data` computes exactly this, and its result can be passed to `is_norm` to avoid recomputing it each time in the case that `K != QQ`. If `K` is `QQ`, there is no need to save any such data -- the only data needed is that of `K.pari_bnf()`, which is used instead, and is already cached by `K`.

As nobody replied here any more, I attacked the ticket myself by changing Craig's patch.

I've addressed Nick's concerns and replaced the documentation to reflect better what is in the Pari documentation (which weakens some claims considerably unfortunately).

x.is_norm() now decides whether an element x is a norm (proven output), while x.rnfisnorm() gives exactly the output that Pari's rnfisnorm would give.

The output of is_norm is True or False. With element=True, it also gives an element of norm x (or None if it doesn't exist). The function element_of_norm is removed, to avoid confusion with elements_of_norm.

Looks like a Pari bug.  This is what the doctest asks Pari to do (with the equivalent of beta.is_norm(L) first):

```

```
But previously, it worked alright:

```
trousseau-bash% sage-4.5.3/sage -gp
                            GP/PARI CALCULATOR Version 2.3.5 (released)

...
parisize = 8000000, primelimit = 500000
? bnf = bnfinit(y^3 + 5);
? p = x^2 + x + Mod(y, y^3 + 5);
? T = rnfisnorminit(bnf, p);
? rnfisnorm(T, Mod(y, y^3 + 5))
%4 = [Mod(-x, x^2 + x + Mod(y, y^3 + 5)), 1]
? rnfisnorm(T, Mod(y/2, y^3 + 5))
%5 = [Mod(Mod(-1/2, y^3 + 5)*x, x^2 + x + Mod(y, y^3 + 5)), 2]
? 
```
Note also that the two versions give a different result at %4.

<div id="comment:20" align="right">comment:20</div>

The bug with non-integral elements in rnfisnorm was reported to pari by fwclarke, and I wrote a simple workaround for the time it takes a pari-fix to reach sage.

Turns out there is another problem:

```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^2 + x + 1) 
sage: Q.<X> = K[] 
sage: L.<b> = NumberField(X^3 + a) 
sage: K.pari_rnfnorm_data(L)
PariError: incorrect type (11)
```

Again caused by something that works fine in pari 2.3.4 and is broken in pari 2.4.3 (alpha)

```
gp > bnf = bnfinit(y^2+y+1);
gp > polrel = Mod(1, y^2 + y + 1)*x^3 + Mod(y, y^2 + y + 1);
gp > rnfisnorminit(bnf, polrel)
  ***   at top-level: rnfisnorminit(bnf,po
  ***                 ^--------------------
  *** rnfisnorminit: incorrect type in RgX_RgXQ_eval.
  ***   Break loop: type 'break' to go back to GP
```

Ideas anyone?

There remain several problems for relative extensions.  In particular, the function `sage.rings.number_field.number_field_rel.NumberField_relative.is_galois_relative` cannot be relied on at present (4.6.1.alpha3):

```
sage: K.<w> = NumberField(x^2 + x + 1)
sage: L.<a> = K.extension(x^3 - 2)
sage: L.is_galois_relative()
False
```
But

```
sage: L.is_galois_absolute()
True
```
and indeed

```
sage: len([g for g in End(L) if g(w) == w]) == L.relative_degree()
True
```
I will post a patch for this in the next couple of days, and suggest other changes to improve the behaviour of `is_norm` with relative extensions.

Here's a new file that addresses Jeroen's "<gen>" issue.

I don't think #9390, which Francis mentions, should stop anyone from reviewing the patch here at #2329. There must be more functionality of sage that assumes is_galois_relative to be correct, this is just one more of them, and Francis says #9390 will be fixed soon anyway. No fix of #9390 will conflict with #2329.

As for "changes to improve behaviour of is_norm". I'm not sure what you're aiming at, but if you want, you can make these changes yourself, in this ticket or a future ticket. That would be a lot more efficient.

So it is still "needs review" at the moment.

Actually `is_galois_relative` doesn't seem to be used anywhere else.

But anyway I have now added a (very short) patch to #9390.

The patch `trac_2329_rnfisnorm4.patch` is a modified version of `trac_2329_rnfisnorm3.patch`, designed to be applied after

1. #10430's http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/spkg/pari-2.4.3.alpha.p2.spkg;
2. #9390's `trac_9390-3rd_replacement.patch`.

The following changes have been made:

1. The workarounds to deal with the pari bugs have been removed.
2. The doctests to `sage.rings.number_field.number_field_element.is_norm` involving non-Galois extensions have been changed.  The first such example was in fact a Galois extension (isomorphic to `CyclotomicField(9)`), which without the patch to #9390 was asserted to be Galois by `is_galois_relative`.
3. A minor change to `pari_rnfnorm_data` in `number_field.py` (replacing `defining_polynomial` by `absolute_polynomial`) and more significant changes to `rnfisnorm` in `number_field_element.pyx` to allow this function to work with extensions L/K where K itself is a relative extension.  These are the changes I was referring to [above](#comment:28). Doctests have been added to illustrate this functionality.
4. Several spaces have been removed in order to comply more closely with the style conventions given in the Developer's Guide, in particular: "Don't use spaces around the '=' sign when used to indicate a keyword argument or a default parameter value".

This all seems to work with 4.6.1.alpha3.

Replying to [@loefflerd](#comment:45):
> Is that supposed to be `("y")` or `("'y'")` perhaps?

No, `'y` is correct.  I have added some comments to that code in the patch.

Basically, the `'y` syntax is PARI's way of refering to a *variable* (as opposed to the *value* of a variable).  See the following `gp` session:

```
gp> y = 42
%1 = 42
gp> y
%2 = 42
gp> 'y
%3 = y
gp> subst(x^3, x, y)
%4 = 74088
gp> subst(x^3, x, 'y)
%5 = y^3
```

Good to know this.  But keep in mind that sage-4.7.alpha2 has not been released (not even sage-4.7.alpha0).  In the future it would be better to test released versions with patches applied instead of unreleased versions.

I will test this patch on a 32-bit system and see what needs to be fixed.

I can confirm that the doctest now passes on a 32-bit build of sage-4.7.alpha1 on OpenSolaris 06/2009 (Intel Xeon chip)

```
sage -t -long -force_lib "devel/sage/sage/rings/number_field/number_field.py"
	 [48.8 s]
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
Total time for all tests: 48.8 seconds
```

Prior to adding the 3 patches to sage-4.7.alpha1, I got. 

```
File "/export/home/drkirkby/sage-4.7.alpha1/devel/sage-main/sage/rings/number_field/number_field.py", line 3035:
    sage: K.selmer_group([K.ideal(2, -a+1), K.ideal(3, a+1), K.ideal(a)], 3)
Expected:
    [2, a + 1, a]
Got:
    [2, a + 1, -a] 
```


I don't know enough about the maths to understand what the patch does, so whilst it appears to fix the problems I see in sage-4.7.alpha1, I don't feel I should give this a positive review - it needs a mathematician to check it too.
