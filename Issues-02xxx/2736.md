Attached is a patch which fixes the annoying exceptions thrown by the doctest runner at the end of the dsage doctests. 

This patch does the following:
1) Explicitly call .wait() on subprocess.Popen instances
2) Explicitly delete the reference to the Popen instances before letting the interpreter exit
3) Explicitly join the dsage thread before letting the interpreter exit in the doctest.
