I take that back, concorde is *not* GPL.  From the readme:

  The code is written
in the ANSI C programming language and it is available for academic
research use; for other uses, contact bico`@`isye.gatech.edu for
licensing options.

So maybe it could be a optional package unless we can get a GPL version.

Another option for a Traveling Salesman Problem solver is the code here:

Specifically, http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~neto/research/lk/

It is GPL.

This package of algorithms seems to be very famous in the world of TSP solvers :
http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/~algorith/implement/tsp/distrib/tsp_solve/tsp_solve-1.3.6.tar.gz
It contains both exact and heuristical solvers.. The thing is that I read nowhere it was licensed under the GPL license, but the beginning of the README file contains :
TspSolve -- Copyright(c) 1994 Free Software Foundation

Still< i do not knwo what it means ;-)

but slightly stronger than the modified BSD.

I agree that "Copyright(c) 1994 Free Software Foundation" at the top of the file is odd!

Yes, the license is GPL-compatible, hence Sage-compatible. 
I pointed out in my email to his that IANAL but it seems
to me that he (the author) cannot both assign the 
copyright to someone else and also issue a distribution license of *his* own choosing.

Nice!

A small comment: I think "is_*" functions should return either True or False.  We have is_hamiltonian() returning False or an object.  I think it would be more consistent to have a hamiltonian_cycle() function that returns a TSP or False, and maybe also an is_hamiltonian function that just returns True and False.

Then I installed glpk and ran sage -testall --optional and got (among 
lots of other failures which are presumably unrelated) this:

A couple of somewhat picky notes from just reading through the code:

* "traveling" is spelled with one 'l' in American English.  See [Oxford English Dictionary](http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50256805?query_type=word&queryword=travel&first=1&max_to_show=10&sort_type=alpha&search_id=CNCH-0vTuPN-10331&result_place=2), "Derivatives, as travelled, -er, -ing, etc. are usually spelt with ll in Gr. Britain, with single l in America."  With no offense to those across the Great Pond, it seems that we've standardized on American English for spelling.

* I don't think there is a need for the "is_hamiltonian" note in the TSP function.

* If these functions require an optional package, it should probably mention that as a note or warning in the documentation.

I'll try applying this patch soon to have a more thorough review.  It looks really nice!

I have rebased ncohen's patch on top of #8364 and #8166. See the ticket description for instructions on how to apply the rebased patch. Someone other than myself needs to have a look through my rebase patch to make sure I didn't mess up anything. Because of this, I'm putting the ticket in "needs review".
