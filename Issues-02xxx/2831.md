In the notebook of sage-2.11:

```
time plot(1.0 - x * floor(1/x), (x,0.00001,1.0)

CPU time: 143.77 s,  Wall time: 1660.39 s
```
with a correct image.

Maple is almost immediate.


Even worse:

```
time plot(1.0 - x * floor(1/x), (x, 0.0, 1.0), plot_points=1000)

CPU time: 244.71 s,  Wall time: 5155.23 s

The problem is that "floor(1/x)" calls maxima. If you drop it the
whole thing takes about a second.

The problem is that there is a bug when deciding to use fast float, since the above
plot takes 0.04 seconds to draw when one calls fast_float explicitly:

```
sage: time plot((1.0 - x * floor(1/x))._fast_float_(x), (x,0.00001,1.0))
CPU times: user 0.03 s, sys: 0.01 s, total: 0.04 s

Sure :)

I would prefer if people stated what they actually doctested [i.e. which version of Sage with what patches applied on what platforms] so I would check myself in case somebody didn't do as much coverage as I would prefer. So you can always blame me too.
