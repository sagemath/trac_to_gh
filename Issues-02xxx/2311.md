This is in sage-location:

import signal   
signal.alarm(360)

This is *stupid*.  It's doing a process that really really better not get interrupted, and it's
interrupting itself if it takes more than 6 minutes.  I can't imagine what idiot wrote such 
bad code....

... oh wait, that was me.  I think that was in there right when that code was first written,
mainly for debugging purposes when I was doing some testing.  Anyway...  didn't
David Harvey say something in irc about all my old code being "impatient" -- I guess
this is a prime example of that!
