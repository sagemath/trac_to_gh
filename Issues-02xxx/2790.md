The new sage -tp has output like this:

```

The following tests failed:

sage -t  devel/sage-modabvar/sage/modular/modform/space.py: 8 doctests failed
sage -t  devel/sage-modabvar/sage/modular/modform/eisenstein_submodule.py: 1 doctests failed
sage -t  devel/sage-modabvar/sage/modular/modform/element.py: 1 doctests failed
sage -t  devel/sage-modabvar/sage/modular/abvar/morphism.py: 8 doctests failed
sage -t  devel/sage-modabvar/sage/modular/abvar/homspace.py: 8 doctests failed
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Total time for all tests: 1586.7 seconds
teragon:sage was$ 
```

This is very annoying because I typically *paste* in the output in order to rerun broken doctests.

Easy fix insert a #, i.e., change : x doctests failed to # : x doctests failed.
