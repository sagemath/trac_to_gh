<div id="comment:1" align="right">comment:1</div>

It is the default behaviour of Sage to return the echelon form over fraction fields 

```
#matrix2.pyx
if not (R == ZZ or R.is_field()):
    try:
        E = self.matrix_over_field()
    except TypeError:
        raise NotImplementedError, "Echelon form not implemented over '%s'."%R
```

so this is much more general.

Note, that there is a specialised implementation for multivariate polynomials though:

```
sage: R.<x> = MPolynomialRing(QQ,1)
sage: a = matrix(R, 2, 3, [x,x^2,1,1+x, 1,x])
sage: a.echelon_form() # default as above
[                             1                              0    (-x^3 + 1)/(-x^3 - x^2 + x)]
[                             0                              1 (x^2 - x - 1)/(-x^3 - x^2 + x)]

sage: a.echelon_form('row_reduction')
[         x + 1              1              x]
[-x^3 - x^2 + x              0       -x^3 + 1]

sage: a.echelon_form('bareiss')
[          x       x + 1           1]
[          0 x^2 - x - 1     x^3 - 1]
```

 Can William explain where this is used in the free module code and what the resulting problems are?  If so I might be able to help.  But is this really a blocker for 2.20.2?

Some minor issues:

* in docstring of `_echelonize_ring` `NotImplemenetedError` should get `\code{`}
* does `self.dense_matrix()` return `self` if it is already dense? If not the extra copy should be avoided by checking if the matrix is dense or sparse first
* What is the status of "`#not very useful?`" is that a note to self to fix this or for the user?
* "#This code is by Me" that should be William Stein
* Erocal Burcin -> Burcin Erocal

Except those minor things the code looks good. Note, I didn't attempt to apply the patch yet.

Yes.

Yes, it returns self. 

* What is the status of "#not very useful?" is that a note to self to fix this or for the user?

It looks WRONG to me.  Shouldn't the second row be removed?!

* "#This code is by Me" that should be William Stein

OK.

* Erocal Burcin -> Burcin Erocal 

OK. 

Any chance you could make the changes you suggest above?  I have to a bunch
of other stuff today, and don't want to hold up rc1.

`sage-2075.2.patch` fixes:
* in docstring of _echelonize_ring NotImplemenetedError should get \code{} 
* "#This code is by Me" that should be William Stein 
* Erocal Burcin -> Burcin Erocal

Left over:
* "does self.dense_matrix() return self if it is already dense? If not the extra copy should be avoided by checking if the matrix is dense or sparse first  -> Yes, it returns self." So it needs no fix
* "What is the status of "#not very useful?" is that a note to self to fix this or for the user?  ->  It looks WRONG to me. Shouldn't the second row be removed?!"
  rowred only considers constants for reduction, not very useful for most applications indeed.

I say apply. If we don't like rowred the way it is, we should (a) rename it and/or (b) fix it in another ticket.

William, if you redo the patch you should also remove the last hunk since it has already been merged via some other patch.

Cheers,
