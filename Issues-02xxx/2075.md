<a id='comment:1'>**Comment 1:**</a>
It is the default behaviour of Sage to return the echelon form over fraction fields 

```
#matrix2.pyx
if not (R == ZZ or R.is_field()):
    try:
        E = self.matrix_over_field()
    except TypeError:
        raise NotImplementedError, "Echelon form not implemented over '%s'."%R
```

so this is much more general.

Note, that there is a specialised implementation for multivariate polynomials though:

```
sage: R.<x> = MPolynomialRing(QQ,1)
sage: a = matrix(R, 2, 3, [x,x^2,1,1+x, 1,x])
sage: a.echelon_form() # default as above
[                             1                              0    (-x^3 + 1)/(-x^3 - x^2 + x)]
[                             0                              1 (x^2 - x - 1)/(-x^3 - x^2 + x)]

sage: a.echelon_form('row_reduction')
[         x + 1              1              x]
[-x^3 - x^2 + x              0       -x^3 + 1]

sage: a.echelon_form('bareiss')
[          x       x + 1           1]
[          0 x^2 - x - 1     x^3 - 1]
```

 What's the conclusion?   That there is no simple answer to what is the best form of normal form for matrices over rings.

 Can William explain where this is used in the free module code and what the resulting problems are?  If so I might be able to help.  But is this really a blocker for 2.20.2?

Some minor issues:

* does `self.dense_matrix()` return `self` if it is already dense? If not the extra copy should be avoided by checking if the matrix is dense or sparse first
* What is the status of "`#not very useful?`" is that a note to self to fix this or for the user?
* "#This code is by Me" that should be William Stein
* Erocal Burcin -> Burcin Erocal

Except those minor things the code looks good. Note, I didn't attempt to apply the patch yet.

Yes.

Yes, it returns self. 

* What is the status of "#not very useful?" is that a note to self to fix this or for the user?

It looks WRONG to me.  Shouldn't the second row be removed?!

* "#This code is by Me" that should be William Stein

OK.

* Erocal Burcin -> Burcin Erocal 

OK. 

Any chance you could make the changes you suggest above?  I have to a bunch

  rowred only considers constants for reduction, not very useful for most applications indeed.
