GAP is involved here, so the issue might not be in Sage itself.

Attachment: **[2154-invalid-perm.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket2154/2154-invalid-perm.patch.gz)**

It looks like the problem here was actually infinite loops, but it now checks to make sure it always gets a valid permutation (even if check=False is set).
