```
ExtendedRationalField(1)/ExtendedRationalField(0)
```
yields

```
ZeroDivisionError: Rational division by zero
```
Same for ExtendedIntegerRing(1)/ExtendedIntegerRing(0)

Presumably these should both yield +Infinity?

The way Sage handles infinity should be revised in general. I say `ExtendedRationalRing` (and `ExtendedIntegerRing`) should go away altogether, since the signed and unsigned infinity rings in `sage/rings/infinity.py` handle the situations when infinity is encountered adequately, at least after #1915 is fixed.
