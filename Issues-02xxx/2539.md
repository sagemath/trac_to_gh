While the above doctest usually only takes about 25 seconds wall time when I do parallel testing it times out every couple doctests. Raising the limit for this long doctest to something larger might be a solution.

Interesting. 
How do I turn parallel testing on to try and reproduce locally? 
It would be better to see why it's taking more than 60 seconds than to simply raise the timeout. doctests that take 60 seconds (even for long time) are probably pretty bad.

Pinging Michael...

Is this still an issue? I still don't understand what you mean by "parallel testing" or how to go about reproducing this.

Yes, it still regularly happens. Run "sage -tp 10 devel/sage/sage" on sage.math to trigger this. I am seeing it regularly with 3.0.alpha[0-3].

I have not seen this for several dozen "-tp 8 -long" on sage.math. Since I was the one who was able to trigger this reliably I am considering this fixed.
