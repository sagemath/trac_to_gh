An unexpected problem: `solve_right` is defined in `matrix_integer_dense` and the versions don't provide the same functionality.  This could happen more places.

Is there any hope for a `solution_space_right` that handles under-determined systems?

Good point -- I had meant to address that but fell asleep and forgot. 
A patch will be forthcoming. 

> Is there any hope for a solution_space_right that handles under-determined systems?


Not in this patch.  Make a trac ticket and somebody will get to it.

For the record: This ticket was reopened after sage-2581.patch and sage-2581_part2-restrict_codomain.patch had been merged. So any additional patch should make clear how it should be applied.

I'm attaching a patch that:

1. addresses Nick's concern about derived classes overloading solve_right.

2. I found that Clement recently introduced a solve right for sparse modn matrices for some reason, and that it had several bugs.  I've fixed those as well in this patch.
