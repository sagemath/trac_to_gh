A.solve_right only worked for A nonsingular, and there was no solve_left.  Now A.solve_right should work for any A and there is a solve_left.

An unexpected problem: `solve_right` is defined in `matrix_integer_dense` and the versions don't provide the same functionality.  This could happen more places.

Is there any hope for a `solution_space_right` that handles under-determined systems?

Good point -- I had meant to address that but fell asleep and forgot. 
A patch will be forthcoming.

Not in this patch.  Make a trac ticket and somebody will get to it.

I'm attaching a patch that:

1. addresses Nick's concern about derived classes overloading solve_right.

2. I found that Clement recently introduced a solve right for sparse modn matrices for some reason, and that it had several bugs.  I've fixed those as well in this patch.
