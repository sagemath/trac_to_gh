This causes a bug when printing:

```
show([Matrix(ZZ,3,range(9)), Matrix(ZZ,3,range(9))])
```

Notice the extra ",". A list of one element doesn't have the same problem.

The bug is in the latex function:

```
sage: latex([Matrix(ZZ,3,range(9)), Matrix(ZZ,3,range(9))])
\begin{array}{l}[\left(\begin{array}{rrr}
