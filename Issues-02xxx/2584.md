<div id="comment:0"></div>

This causes a bug when printing:

```
show([Matrix(ZZ,3,range(9)), Matrix(ZZ,3,range(9))])
```

Notice the extra ",". A list of one element doesn't have the same problem.

Component: **graphics**

While the patch looks like the fix to this problem shouldn't we also add a doctest that verifies that the bug has been fixed? Not to be pedantic ... well, I am :=)
