Consider the following examples (reported by Dean Moore here: http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support/browse_thread/thread/5555e780a76b3343#)

```
sage: solve(sin(x^2)/x == 0, x)
[x == 0]
sage: solve(sin(x^2)/x^2 == 0, x)
[x == 0]
sage: solve(sin(x^2)/x^3 == 0, x)
[x == 0]
```
None of these functions are even defined at x=0, so that should not be returned as a solution.  (The first two functions can be extended to x=0 by taking limits, in which case x=0 is a solution to the first one but not the second; the third function has a vertical asymptote at x=0.)

No, this is an appropriate error message (it's from Maxima, not Sage). There are no solutions to acot(x)==0, at least over the reals (and presumably over the complex field as well?).  Now that we know about that error, it would be easy to put a catch in for something like that error message and return 
sage: solve(acot(x),x)
[]
instead.  Feel free to open a ticket for that and put me in the cc: field.  

But this is unrelated to the issue in the ticket, which is a genuine Maxima bug, as far as I can tell.

This will be addressed (not the main point of this ticket) in the patch for #7745.  The main point is still a bug in Maxima 5.20.1.

<a id='comment:6'></a>I had an idea to introduce new option to solve, which 


1. Takes only explicit solutions


2. Substitutes into equation and if an error appears, removes this "solution" from the list. 



The problem in this approach is, that for example ln(0)=-Infinity in Sage and so x=0 will be still reported as a solution of x/ln(x)=0. The problem could be solved by substituting values in Maxima and not in Sage, but I am still thinking on some cleaner solution. And still  have no idea what should be returned as solution of x*ln(x-3) == 0. Distinguish in this new option, if the user works in real domain or in complex doman? Something like check_domain = False, True, or 'real'?




Any idea?

<a id='comment:16'></a>kcrisman, in your post (from 7 years ago) you had mentioned to_poly_solve in maxima's share/contrib. It's been a while since then, so it is not located there anymore. I couldn't find it anywhere in Maxima's source on github though, so i wasn't sure if it was still used at all. Does sage/maxima use it at all? 

I've been looking at several old tickets, all involving solving equations. One was using find_root, which uses scipy, and the other had to do with solve just like this one. I think it would be best to just have one, no? As far as I can tell, they do about the same thing, and they both have issues.

<a id='comment:18'></a>This has still been an issue, and so I've implemented an optional solution

You can pass the optional argument (`check_domain`) to `solve`, which will tell it to check each solution it finds with SymPy to see if it's NaN. I added some documentation and an example.

I ran (on my machine) all the current doc-tests with the new argument to make sure it accepts all their solutions, and it does, but I believe it significantly slows down the function, so probably should not end up defaulting to `True` without some more considerations / optimizations (especially since `solve` is widely used)

See the added documentation example:

```
sage: solve((x^2 - 1)/(sin(x - 1)) == 0, x, check_domain=True)
[x == -1]
```

I don't understand your question. `Complement(ConditionSet(x, Eq(sin(x**2), 0), Complexes), FiniteSet(0))` is the answer. Not in a very nice form, but a valid answer.

Ahh my bad, I was trying to obtain a more numeric based answer, I did see that the second statement did resemble the solution
