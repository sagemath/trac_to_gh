```

Above I have some comments:
 (1) -- clearly that is a weird bug in what is being doctested.

 (2) aside from that, take a look at how show works in plot.py to see
that doctesting sets a certain flag, and show in that contexts writes
files to a temp directory.  That's what the above should do.

Patch looks good, is much nicer than the previous version and is well doctested. The last hunk needs to be removed when merging. Ergo: positive review.

Cheers,
