# Issue 2513: Weird printing issues with gcc, caused by LANG environment variable

So I've noticed for a little while now that I have the following strange problem: 

```
sage/rings/number_field/totallyreal_data.c: In function â:
sage/rings/number_field/totallyreal_data.c:1920: error: â undeclared (first use in this function)
```

But then, if you comment out the fix for trac ticket #276 (which sets the environment variable `LANG`), that same error becomes:

```
sage/rings/number_field/totallyreal_data.c: In function '__pyx_f_4sage_5rings_12number_field_16totallyreal_data_lagrange_degree_3_c':
sage/rings/number_field/totallyreal_data.c:1920: error: 'intp' undeclared (first use in this function)
```

Obviously we'd prefer the second. What I think we should do is move setting the `LANG` environment variable somewhere closer in the build & run process to where Maxima gets initialized. I haven't had time to sit down and look at this at all -- I'm assigning it to myself, but if someone else wants to jump in and fix it before me, I definitely won't mind.

I'm also adding robertwb to the cc, because I think I recall him saying he ran into this, too, and he's (1) probably happy to have a workaround, and (2) likely to come up with a fix himself, saving me work. :)
