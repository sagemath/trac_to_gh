I'm not sure we should accept matrices, since you can get teh job done with `bloc_diagonal_matrix` or `block_matrix`.

sage: v = vector([1,2,3/5]); v

Sorry, I meant #3704 which I reviewed recently, and seems to do the same kind of thing.  If that patch does what this one does, then this one can be marked "duplicate", perhaps.  But it would be best of you could look at both to make sure we get the best of both.

Much simpler function (it's not broken into cases, but instead passes off all the hard work to the matrix() constructor, which also makes it more consistent with the matrix() constructor).\n\n2. With the patch here, it looks like you still have the problem noted in the comments of #3704 of iterable objects giving weird answers, like a factored polynomial putting a factor in each element.  In #3704, I finally decided on just making it do this iterable thing (putting the elements down the diagonal) if the passed object was a list (or Sequence), tuple, or vector.  For all other cases, I think it is clearer to just say `diagonal_matrix(list(myobject))` or `diagonal_matrix(myobject.list())`.\n\n3.

    772         # Format 5
    773         v = v.list()

UnboundLocalError: local variable 'v' referenced before assignment
```

So I vote to take the patch 2577-2.patch here and the patch at #3704 and leave the 2577-1.patch.  I'd feel more comfortable if someone (preferably dfdeshom) expressed an opinion, though, since I wrote the patch over at #3704.

<a id='comment:14'></a>After playing around with 2577-2.patch, I have some concerns:

1. I don't like arbitrarily getting the items of any iterable object.  There are many, many objects that are iterable in ways that don't make sense for vector().  For example:

```
sage: x=polygen(QQ)
sage: vector(x^2-1)
(-1, 0, 1)
sage: vector(x^2-1, x)
(-1, 0, 1)
sage: vector(x^2-1, x,x)
(x^2 - 1, x, x)
```

I would much rather that vector() *only* try to get the items in an iterable object if the object was a list, tuple, or another vector.  Otherwise you have funny things like the above happening.

<a id='comment:16'></a>Sorry Didier,

this is "wontfix" since we will be merging #3704.

Cheers,
