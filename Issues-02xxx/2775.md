This example is from Genya Zaytman:

```
sage: version()
'SAGE Version sage-2.11, Release Date: 2008-03-30'
sage: q = 1073741789
sage: T.<aa, bb> = PolynomialRing(GF(q))
sage: f = aa^2 + 12124343*bb*aa + 32434598*bb^2; f
aa^2 + 12124343*aa*bb + 32434598*bb^2
sage: f.factor()
(32434598) * (16373350*aa^2 + 437239695*aa*bb + bb^2)
sage: g = (32434598) * (16373350*aa^2 + 437239695*aa*bb + bb^2); g
aa^2 - 49344938*aa*bb + 32434598*bb^2
sage: f == g
False
```

Michael Abshoff reports that this is a bug in Singular itself.

Clarification: is "Factory" something in Sage, or something in Singular? i.e. is this still a bug (or possibly documentation bug) at their end, or do we just need to stop using Singular when the characteristic gets this big?

Another question: is it really always 29 bits, or is it going to be 61 bits on a 64-bit machine?

It seems to be always 29 bits. I tested on sage.math with a 64 bit Singular.

"Factory" is a Singular thing and we need to raise an `Exception` if the user attempts to factor of fields that large. I'll provide a patch later.

The word is 29 bits, but I'll check later, too.
