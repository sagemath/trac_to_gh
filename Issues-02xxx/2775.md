This example is from Genya Zaytman:

```
sage: version()
'SAGE Version sage-2.11, Release Date: 2008-03-30'
sage: q = 1073741789
sage: T.<aa, bb> = PolynomialRing(GF(q))
sage: f = aa^2 + 12124343*bb*aa + 32434598*bb^2; f
aa^2 + 12124343*aa*bb + 32434598*bb^2
sage: f.factor()
(32434598) * (16373350*aa^2 + 437239695*aa*bb + bb^2)
sage: g = (32434598) * (16373350*aa^2 + 437239695*aa*bb + bb^2); g
aa^2 - 49344938*aa*bb + 32434598*bb^2
sage: f == g
False
```

Michael Abshoff reports that this is a bug in Singular itself.

Clarification: is "Factory" something in Sage, or something in Singular? i.e. is this still a bug (or possibly documentation bug) at their end, or do we just need to stop using Singular when the characteristic gets this big?

Another question: is it really always 29 bits, or is it going to be 61 bits on a 64-bit machine?

Factory is a library that is part of Singular and used to do factorization. Other projects like M2 also use it. As you write we need to check the characteristic before passing the polynomial to factory nee Singular and otherwise throw an exception.

It seems to be always 29 bits. I tested on sage.math with a 64 bit Singular.

"Factory" is a Singular thing and we need to raise an `Exception` if the user attempts to factor of fields that large. I'll provide a patch later.

The word is 29 bits, but I'll check later, too.

Ummm.... do we have any other way to provide the factorisation? For example, Genya (who reported this bug) actually wanted to factor the polynomial :-) I agree that an exception is better than an incorrect result, but it would be nice if.....
