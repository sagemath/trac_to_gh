There's a really long doctest in sage/rings/number_field/totallyreal_rel.py. We can't just `# long` it, because it also needs to use `# 32-bit`/`# 64-bit`, and these two don't play nicely together. This patch makes it into a `# no doctest` for now to avoid timeouts.

Component: **doctest coverage**
