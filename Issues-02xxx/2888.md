The following should return [] but it throws an exception instead:

```
sage: M = matrix(3, 4, range(12))
sage: M[0:3, 2:2]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
<type 'exceptions.ValueError'>            Traceback (most recent call last)

/opt/sage-3.0.alpha2/devel/sage-main/<ipython console> in <module>()

/opt/sage-3.0.alpha2/devel/sage-main/matrix0.pyx in sage.matrix.matrix0.Matrix.__getitem__()

<type 'exceptions.ValueError'>: max() arg is an empty sequence
```

Same problem if I try M[0:0, 0:0].  This is an obstacle in doing #2616, since submatrix() does handle these cases properly.


Component: **linear algebra**

Keywords: **slice**

Hi,

the patch doesn't apply cleanly against my merge tree:

```
sage-3.0.alpha4/devel/sage$ patch -p1 --dry-run < trac_2888.patch
patching file sage/matrix/matrix0.pyx
Hunk #1 FAILED at 613.
Hunk #2 succeeded at 694 (offset 21 lines).
1 out of 2 hunks FAILED -- saving rejects to file sage/matrix/matrix0.pyx.rej
```
The first hunk are the added doctests, so it is easy enough to do. I won't mind if somebody beasts me to it.

Cheers,

Michael
