Excellent.  Since Sage builds its own readline, we can do what it takes
to make sure this works.

Thanks!

I just checked and on all my builds I get the following:

```
sage-3.1.3.alpha2/local/include$ grep -r HAVE_RL_COMPLETION_APPEND_CHARACTER *
python2.5/pyconfig.h:#define HAVE_RL_COMPLETION_APPEND_CHARACTER 1
```
In #3947 we fixed the python.spkg LDFLAGS to pick up Sage's python, so I consider this issue resolved. I checked about 8 different Linux builds and cannot reproduce this problem. So unless someone comes up with a broken system I am closing this as fixed.

Cheers,

Michael
