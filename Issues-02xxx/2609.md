This looks fine mathematically.  I don't much like seeing three almost identical functions, though (for Gamma0, Gamma1 and GammaH).  Can it not be written in such a way that all three call a common core function which has the list of coset reps as a parameter?

Even better would be a function to do this more generally, given generators for a big group and coset reps for a subgroup -- but I do realise that one would also need toprovide functions to return the coset rep for any give element of the big group.
