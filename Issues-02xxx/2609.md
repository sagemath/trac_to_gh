This looks fine mathematically.  I don't much like seeing three almost identical functions, though (for Gamma0, Gamma1 and GammaH).  Can it not be written in such a way that all three call a common core function which has the list of coset reps as a parameter?

Even better would be a function to do this more generally, given generators for a big group and coset reps for a subgroup -- but I do realise that one would also need toprovide functions to return the coset rep for any give element of the big group.

Since you're doing just arithmetic, it just occurred to me that in the interest of speed one could use the specialized 2x2 integer matrix class that Robert Bradshaw wrote, which is ten times faster.  For example: 

```
sage: import sage.matrix.matrix_integer_2x2
sage: A = sage.matrix.matrix_integer_2x2.Matrix_integer_2x2(MatrixSpace(ZZ,2),[1,2,3,4],False,False)
sage: time for _ in xrange(10^5): B = A*A
CPU times: user 0.23 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.23 s
Wall time: 0.24
sage: A = matrix(ZZ,2,[1,2,3,4])sage: time for _ in xrange(10^5): B = A*A
CPU times: user 1.81 s, sys: 0.21 s, total: 2.02 s
Wall time: 2.04

Fantastic!  

This patch provides very useful functionality, and in a very efficient way.  It should definitely be included.
