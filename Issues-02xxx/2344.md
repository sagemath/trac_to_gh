<a id='comment:4'></a>There is some trouble on OSX 10.5 [even after a sage -ba]:

```
bsd:sage-2.11.alpha1-32bit mabshoff$ ./sage -t devel/sage-main/sage/rings/integer.pyx
sage -t  devel/sage-main/sage/rings/integer.pyx

------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occured in SAGE.
This probably occured because a *compiled* component
of SAGE has a bug in it (typically accessing invalid memory)
or is not properly wrapped with _sig_on, _sig_off.
You might want to run SAGE under gdb with 'sage -gdb' to debug this.
SAGE will now terminate (sorry).
------------------------------------------------------------


A mysterious error (perphaps a memory error?) occurred, which may have crashed doctest.
         [4.8 s]
exit code: 768

----------------------------------------------------------------------
The following tests failed:


        sage -t  devel/sage-main/sage/rings/integer.pyx
Total time for all tests: 4.8 seconds
```
Running the same code under gdb works fine. On the other hand `-verbose` tells us:

```
<SNIP>
Trying:
    n=Integer(100)###line 930:_sage_    >>> n=100
Expecting nothing
ok
Trying:
    n.set_str('100000',Integer(2))###line 931:_sage_    >>> n.set_str('100000',2)
Expecting nothing
ok
Trying:
    n###line 932:_sage_    >>> n
Expecting:
    32
ok

We also have some trouble in dancing_links.pyx:

```
sage -t -long devel/sage-main/sage/combinat/matrices/dancing_links.pyx
**********************************************************************
