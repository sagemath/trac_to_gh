The SPKG installs fine but I cannot apply the patch neither against my modified copy of Sage (which is expected) nor a vanilla 2.10.4, which is unexpected. I've attached the reject files for both.

Attachment [polybori_0.3.1_doctest_coverage_48.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket2060/polybori_0.3.1_doctest_coverage_48.patch) by @malb created at 2008-04-01 16:15:45

The attached patch (`polybori_0.3.1_doctest_coverage_48.patch`) which is to be applied on top of `2060-polybori_interface_update_0.3.1.patch` increases the doctest coverage to 47%.

```
pbori.pyx
SCORE pbori.pyx: 47% (98 of 205)
```

Before both patches the coverage was at:

```
pbori.pyx
SCORE pbori.pyx: 33% (52 of 157)
```

and thus this is an improvement over vanilla 2.11 too.

* I give Burcin's patch a positive review: doctests pass and we **need** `PolyBoRi` 0.3.1
* someone should review my patch
* if my patch gets a positive review both patches should be applied, since then not only is the functionality improved but also the doctest coverage which should make the everything-new-needs-doctest faction happy.
* Burcin's patch was also doctested with the `PolyBoRi` test suite by him, so there is even an undocumented extra level of assurance.
* In any case: We'll be working on getting the coverage close to 100% in the very near future.
