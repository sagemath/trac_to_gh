When trying to run the Debian build of SAGE, I get the following doctest error.

It doesn't seem that any of the Debian packages for GAP contain GeneratorMatCode.  So, we'll need to do something to make this available in Debian.

This also seems to be the cause of the HadamardMat doctest failures.

This is not **Sage Specific**: Please file a bug report with Debian or alternatively package the Sage version of GAP. Alternatively create a deb which contains the GAP packages that Sage installs per default.

GUAVA is a GAP coding theory package which is included standard with SAGE. The reason why these two errors occurs, I'm guessing, is that it is either not installed into the workspace (using GAP's LoadPackage then SAGE's gap_reset_workspace) or that whoever created the Debian version of SAGE did not using SAGE's version of GAP.
