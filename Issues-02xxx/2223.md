Thoughts:

It's likely a theorem that bessel_J is always real
for integer first argument?  If so, let's just return
the real part and be done with these weird imaginary
part issues:

```
sage: bessel_J(3,10,"scipy")
0.0583793793052000 - 2.93425242844000e-17*I
sage: bessel_J(4,10,"scipy")
9.69299109301000e-17*I - 0.219602686102000
sage: bessel_J(5,10,"scipy")
1.11203257018000e-16*I - 0.234061528187000
sage: bessel_J(10,10,"scipy")
0.207486106633000 - 1.17732704470000e-16*I
sage: bessel_J(10,20,"scipy")
0.186482558024000 - 2.10019326787000e-16*I
```
