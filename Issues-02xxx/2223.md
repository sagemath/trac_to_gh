Thoughts:

It's likely a theorem that bessel_J is always real
for integer first argument?  If so, let's just return
the real part and be done with these weird imaginary
part issues:

```
sage: bessel_J(3,10,"scipy")

As is the patch doesn't apply:

```
sage$ patch -p1 --dry-run < trac_2223.patch
patching file sage/functions/special.py
Hunk #1 FAILED at 5.
Hunk #2 succeeded at 500 (offset 7 lines).
Hunk #3 FAILED at 514.
Hunk #4 succeeded at 537 with fuzz 2 (offset 10 lines).
2 out of 4 hunks FAILED -- saving rejects to file sage/functions/special.py.rej
```
I guess the only important hunk is the third one, so I will probably merge that one manually.

Cheers,

Michael
