Fixes a number of bugs in p-adic extensions.

* changes many object creation functions to pass on exceptions if necessary.
* fixes a bug in precision_absolute for capped relative extension elements that causes it to return the wrong answer if the element is not normalized.
* Fixes object creation functions so that they do not fail when asked to create an element of precision zero.

Doctests also pass for me when applying the patch to 2.10.4.final. After talking to roed about the missing doctest in IRC yesterday I tend to want to merge this and hope that doctests are forthcomings since these fixes have been tested and reviewed by several people "back east."
