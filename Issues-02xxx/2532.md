Fixes a number of bugs in p-adic extensions.

* changes many object creation functions to pass on exceptions if necessary.
* fixes a bug in precision_absolute for capped relative extension elements that causes it to return the wrong answer if the element is not normalized.
* Fixes object creation functions so that they do not fail when asked to create an element of precision zero.
