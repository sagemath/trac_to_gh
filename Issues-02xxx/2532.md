The patch applies, builds, and passes all tests.  However, a follow-up patch should be added which adds doctests to show that the bugs are indeed fixed.

Doctests also pass for me when applying the patch to 2.10.4.final. After talking to roed about the missing doctest in IRC yesterday I tend to want to merge this and hope that doctests are forthcomings since these fixes have been tested and reviewed by several people "back east."

Cheers,

Michael

I agree. Given the current doctest coverage and code complexity of the p-adics code, I think we should just merge this and wait for the real doctesting work to catch up.
