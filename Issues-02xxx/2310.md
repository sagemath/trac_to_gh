I found this bug when testing #1964.  To replicate, create a file a.sage and put 

```
attach b.sage
```
in it.  This fails, but {{{attach "b.sage"} works.  This was a problem before this patch, so it is NOT the fault of this patch.

NOTE: This could likely be done better after #1964 is done by using the method split_file_names(line): in interpreter.py?
