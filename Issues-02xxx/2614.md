This ticket is a continuation and final aim of #2385.  I was hoping to generate a bit of discussion with that patch, but it got merged before the discussion was generated.

The end result is this (illustrated with ZZ, but applying equally to QQ):

```
sage: R.<x,y,z> = ZZ[]
sage: f=(-x^2-x+3)*(y-1)
sage: f
-1*x^2*y + x^2 - x*y + x + 3*y - 3
sage: f.coefficient(x^1)
-1*y + 1
sage: f.coefficient(x^0)
-1*x^2*y + x^2 - x*y + x + 3*y - 3
sage: f.coefficient({x:0})
3*y - 3
sage: f.coefficient([0,None,None])
3*y - 3
```

Note that the "f.coefficient(x<sup>0</sup>)" is possibly mis-leading and this motivated both #2385 and this ticket.  Note that for ZZ "f.coefficient(x<sup>0</sup>)" actually returned the constant coefficient as a special case -- I think that was dead wrong.

What do you mean by "restriction on a constant"?  Is this bit what you are talking about:

>Note that for ZZ "f.coefficient(x0)" actually returned the constant coefficient as a special case -- I think that was dead wrong.

Perhaps I should have said:  In the current 2.10.4 code "f.coefficient(x<sup>0</sup>)" returns the constant coefficient -- I think this is dead wrong.

I feel like I might be missing the point of your question.  If so, please clarify!

Actually, you were crystal clear. I was confused: I thought f was a mpoly in x and y only and was asking why you were doing `f.coefficient([0,None,None])`.

**Attachment:** [mpoly-coeff.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket2614/mpoly-coeff.patch.gz)

The current patch is re-based against 2.11.alpha1 augmented with patches from mabshoff's alpha2 release cycle directory.  I don't have a build of this to really test, but I believe doc-tests should pass.

If this is not integrated by the time alpha2 is released, I'll probably double-check some things with a built alpha2.
