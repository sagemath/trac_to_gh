It says:

1. clone the main branch
2. implement new functionality in the clone, test
3. commit changes to clone
4. pull changes into main branch
5. export patch or bundle, and contribute it

There are good reasons why one shouldn't do step 4, since it taints the main branch with code that hasn't been reviewed, etc.

Component: **documentation**
