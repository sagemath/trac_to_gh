attachment:2193-doctest_keywords_in_comments.patch changes the `sage-doctest` script to search for keywords only in comments. It also changes the way random keyword is handled to match wstein's suggestions in the sage-devel thread mentioned above.

attachment:2193-doc_add_random.patch and attachment:2193-add_random_keyword.patch add the random keyword to comments for tests which relied on the old behavior in the documentation, and the sage library respectively.
