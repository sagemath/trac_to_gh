The patch is mostly fine, but there are some formatting issues.

This looks wrong:

```
 	155	        sage: R = ZZ
 	156	        sage: R; is_Ideal(R) 
 	157	        Integer Ring 
 	158	        False 
```

Please typeset sage's output all on one line.  So rather than

```
 	168	        sage: I = R.ideal(x^2 + 1); I 
 	169	        Principal ideal (x^2 + 1) of Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over 
 	170	        Rational Field 
```

give me

```
 	168	        sage: I = R.ideal(x^2 + 1); I 
 	169	        Principal ideal (x^2 + 1) of Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Rational Field 
```

Also, there are *tons* of typos.  'th' instead of 'the', incorrectly spelled words, etc.  I will work on some emacs code that will spell-check only sage comments, and ignore examples as appropriate, but until then you'll have to do it by hand :)

Merged rings.ideal.patch in 2.10.3.rc3. The patch does add a single docstring in numerical/optimize.py, so I am not quite sure if that was intended for this patch.

Sorry for being late to the party, but please open another ticket to address the following minor issues:
* `def ring` the docstring uses backslashes but is not treated raw: `r"""` missing
* "Note that \code{self.ring()} is different from \code{self.ring()}" seems like a typo
