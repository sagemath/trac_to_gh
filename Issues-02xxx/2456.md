```
File "matrix_symbolic_dense.pyx", line 873:
    sage: list(a.fcp())
Expected:
    [(x^2 - 65*x - 250, 1), (x, 3)]
Got:
    [(x, 3), (x^2 - 65*x - 250, 1)]
```
But inside sage:

```
sage: a = matrix(SR, 5, [1..5^2]) 
sage: a.fcp()
(x^2 - 65*x - 250) * x^3
sage: list(a.fcp())
[(x^2 - 65*x - 250, 1), (x, 3)]
```

REFEREE REPORT:

* The second chunk in trac_2456.patch, which swaps the order of sort and simplify, breaks things.  This is because simplify assumes its input is sorted, as it combines adjacent pairs.

* The rest of the patch looks fine.
