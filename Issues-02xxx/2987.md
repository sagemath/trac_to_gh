Cheers,

Ahh, I did 3 commits and "hg export"ed all 3 to make this patch file.  Lower down in the patch file it creates the directories.  Maybe this doesn't actually work.

Tim,

for mercurial you cannot concatenate patches - at least not in the order you did with this patch. I cut the three patches apart and applied them to 

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mabshoff/release-cycles-3.0/final/zn_poly-0.8.p0.spkg

Cheers,
