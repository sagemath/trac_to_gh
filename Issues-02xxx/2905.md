<mabshoff> ok
<gfurnish> the other change was -O2 spyx's
<mabshoff> yeah, saw that
<gfurnish> and finally I moved to a try->except instead of a has_key in coercion in parent.pyx

Patch passes doctest on Sage 3.0.alpha4. Somebody else needs to take a closer look and figure out of all of this is a good idea.
