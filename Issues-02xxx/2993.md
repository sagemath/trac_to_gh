Rob Goedman reported:

```
Robs-Intel:sage-3.0.rc0 rob$ gcc -v
Using built-in specs.
Target: i686-apple-darwin9
Configured with: /var/tmp/gcc_42/gcc_42-5531~1/src/configure --disable-
checking -enable-werror --prefix=/usr --mandir=/usr/share/man --enable-
languages=c,objc,c++,obj-c++ --program-transform-name=/^[cg][^.-]*$/s/
$/-4.2/ --with-gxx-include-dir=/usr/include/c++/4.0.0 --with-slibdir=/
usr/lib --build=i686-apple-darwin9 --host=i686-apple-darwin9 --
target=i686-apple-darwin9
Thread model: posix
gcc version 4.2.1 (Apple Inc. build 5531)

make gives below (summarized) error on 2.11, alpha6, rc0 and rc1.  
Below attachment contains the complete rc1 install.log .

If, as a quick test, the Mac specific '-fasm-blocks' flag is added in  
the subdir cipher, make complains about the assembler code in the asm  
block in poll_padlock.

Do I have to disable ENABLE_PADLOCK_SUPPORT? If so, can I force the  
sage make to use './configure -disable_padlock_support'?

As this is not related to the upcoming Sage 3.0 release, I'm fine to  
wait for a binary release, although ultimately I would like to be able  
to build sage myself. 
```

The spkg at

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mabshoff/SPKG/libgcrypt-1.4.0.p2.spkg

will hopefully fix the issue.

Cheers,

Michael
