When playing around with `ringlist`, i found a bug the method `sage_structured_str_list`:

With the attached patch, the following works:

```
sage: R=singular.ring(0,'(x,y)','dp')
sage: R.ringlist().sage_structured_str_list()
['0', ['x', 'y'], [['dp', '1,\n1 '], ['C', '0 ']], '0']
sage: R.ringlist().sage_flattened_str_list()
['0', 'x', 'y', 'dp', '1,1', 'C', '0', '_[1]=0']
```

The suggested algorithm is recursive, and it is easy to see that if `L` is a singular list of (singular lists of (...)) then `L.sage_structured_list()` returns a sage list of lists mimicking `L`'s structure, so that any non-list component of `L` is represented as a string.

The following might be a disadvantage:
* If `L` is very (i mean: **very**) deeply nested, there might be trouble with the recursion limit.
* The example shows that `sage_flattened_str_list` and my suggestion for `sage_structured_str_list` are based on different string representations of the list components. E.g., in the example, the last component is a 0-ideal. Printing a 0-ideal yields the string `'0'` (see above in `sage_structured_str_list`), but if the 0-ideal is part of a list then printing the list would represent the 0-ideal in the form `'_[0]=0'` (see above in `sage_flattened_str_list`). Similarly, an `intvec` would be represented in two different ways.

It may be a matter of taste whether the first or second string representation is preferred, and i think it would not be difficult to achieve the other representation. Opinions?

Here is how to obtain the other representation: In the patch, replace `return str(self)` by `return '\n'.join(x.strip() for x in self.list().__str__().split('\n')[1:])`

I don't think that this would be an issue in practice.

I don't like the second representation because it doesn't look like valid Singular outside a list? But if that is the format Singular accepts when we play the list of lists back to it then we should go for this representation.

**Both** represantations can not be played back. 

Example 1: The first version of representing `intvec(1,1)` is `'1,\n1'` -- but `singular('1,\n1')` results in hanging up. The second version would represent `intvec(1,1)` as `'1,1'` -- but `singular('1,1')` is a list and not an intvec. 

Example 2: `singular.ideal('x','y')` would either be represented by `'x,\ny'` (first version) or by `'_[1]=x\n_[2]=y'` (second version). Both is not valid for `singular(...)`.

So i think it is really just a matter of taste. To return strings that can be used for defining the represented objects would involve much more work, unless there is a simple Singular command that provides such string. Do you know any?

Unfortunately I don't know such a function. But I see the point that it is a matter of taste. However, I still prefer the first option because `_[1] = 0` depends on the index of the list ([1]) while just `0` doesn't.

Change `riemann_roch_basis`, since it relies on getting a *wrong* answer from `sage_structured_str_list`\n\n2. Change `sage_structured_str_list` so that not only singular lists are turned into a sage list, but also singular ideals and intvecs are turned into lists.\n\nI prefer the first option, since the second option clearly violates the specification of `sage_structured_str_list`.\n\nAnyway, i think we will only be able to fix the bug later.",

> * Does `make test` still pass after the change? In particular does `sage -t schemes/plane_curves/projective_curve.py` still pass? This seems to be the only place this method is called.

I'm afraid this test fails.

But i believe the function `riemann_roch_basis` only works because it expects a behaviour of `sage_structured_str_list` *that does not fit to its specification*.

To be precise: Taking the example of `riemann_roch_basis`, the function internally computes `LG = G.BrillNoether(X2)`, which is printed as

```
[1]:
   _[1]=x
   _[2]=y
[2]:
   _[1]=1
   _[2]=1
[3]:
   _[1]=z
   _[2]=y
[4]:
   _[1]=z^2
   _[2]=y^2
[5]:
   _[1]=z
   _[2]=x
[6]:
   _[1]=z^2
   _[2]=x*y
```

Then, `sage_structured_str_list` is applied to this thing, and yields

```
[['x', 'y'], ['1', '1'], ['z', 'y'], ['z^2', 'y^2'], ['z', 'x'], ['z^2', 'x*y']]
```

I believe this output is wrong, since `LG[1]` is not a singular list, hence, must be represented as a string and not as a sage list.

I see two ways to resolve it:

1. Change `riemann_roch_basis`, since it relies on getting a *wrong* answer from `sage_structured_str_list`

2. Change `sage_structured_str_list` so that not only singular lists are turned into a sage list, but also singular ideals and intvecs are turned into lists.

I prefer the first option, since the second option clearly violates the specification of `sage_structured_str_list`.

Anyway, i think we will only be able to fix the bug later.

I think i did fix it.

First of all, the patch for `sage_structured_str_list` should be replaced by patch number 2, because in the first patch i had a mistake in the doctest.

Then, i attached a patch for `riemann_roch_basis`. The point is that internally `riemann_roch_basis` computes something that apparently is known to be a list of ideals with two generators. We know how these are dealt with by the new version of `sage_structured_str_list`. Hence, changing one line of `riemann_roch_basis` suffices.

Oops, i just see that i attached the patch twice...

Anyway. With the patches `sage_structured_str_list2.patch` and with either patch for `riemann_roch_basis`, all doc tests for `singular.py` and for `projective_curve.py` pass.

Moreover, i can not find any other place where `sage_structured_str_list` or `riemann_roch_basis` are used.

I guess this is since i made the mistake to manually edit the patch.

I don't know how i can delete an attachment.

Nor do i understand what happens. I did `hg_sage.pull()` followed by `hg_sage.update()`, and i expected to get `singular.py` so that `sage_structured_str_list` is in its old state.

But what i pulled from the official repository did already contain my patch for `sage_structured_str_list`, with the corrected doc test.

Could you verify whether in the official repository the lines 1117-1151 look like that:

```
    def sage_structured_str_list(self):
        """
        If self is a Singular list of lists of Singular elements,
        returns corresponding SAGE list of lists of strings.

        EXAMPLES:
            sage: R=singular.ring(0,'(x,y)','dp')
            sage: RL=R.ringlist()
            sage: RL
            [1]:
               0
            [2]:
               [1]:
                  x
               [2]:
                  y
            [3]:
               [1]:
                  [1]:
                     dp
                  [2]:
                     1,1
               [2]:
                  [1]:
                     C
                  [2]:
                     0
            [4]:
               _[1]=0
            sage: RL.sage_structured_str_list()
            ['0', ['x', 'y'], [['dp', '1,\n1 '], ['C', '0 ']], '0']
        """
        if not (self.type()=='list'):
            return str(self)
        return [X.sage_structured_str_list() for X in self]
```
This is how they should be **after** applying my patch. 

Anyway, i think i need an advice how to make a clean patch.

There is a riemann_roch_basis function in both schemes/plane_curves/affine_curve.py
and schemes/plane_curves/projective_curve.py. I think William Stein and I wrote them.

was unreliable in the sense that Singular would not return the same (and consistent)

Still the second doctest example has random result. Or do you mean something else?

I don't know if it is fixed on the Singular side. I can only say: If Singular returns a list of ideals with two generators then I believe my patch for the `riemann_roch_basis` in `projective_curve.py` works.

Could you review the Riemann-Roch part of `trac_2301_superpatch.patch`? The positive review of malb refers to the bug in `sage_structured_str_list`, but a review for the other part is still missing, as far as i understand.

Simon,

please open another ticker for "Follow-up bug in riemann_roch_basis" - if it is a separate issue we prefer to do it that way. Otherwise tickets get too complicated and we can only close them when all issues have been resolved.

Next time i will do so. 
I did not open a new ticket because it was the new version of `sage_structured_str_list` that made `riemann_roch_basis` fail, and so i thought that this follow-up still belongs to the same ticket.

Anyway. The doctests for both `singular.py` and `projective_curve.py` pass in `sage-2.10.3.rc0`, so i think it is ok to leave the ticket closed. 

Since the problem seems solved, i also think it is not needed to open a new ticket for `riemann_roch_basis`, or am i mistaken?
