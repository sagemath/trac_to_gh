This patch adds an optional E2 parameter to `padic_height_via_multiply`. The idea is to make it possible to use a precomputed value of E2. Since the E2 computation is very expensive relative to the p-adic height computation, this makes it easier to do profiling work on the p-adic height portion of the computation.
