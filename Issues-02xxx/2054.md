If one uses the Python profiler through Sage's Ipython command line, the input line is not preparsed, which is potentially very confusing.  E.g., this should print 256:

```
sage: %prun print 2^8
10
         2 function calls in 0.000 CPU seconds

   Ordered by: internal time

sorry for the delay, I just wanted to let you know that I don't have a
quick solution to this right now, and I'm swamped with moving/home
sale issues, so for a couple of weeks my coding time is reduced to
exactly zero.

I'll keep this in my inbox, starred, so once I get to Berkeley I can
fix it.  It's not difficult, I just don't have a spare hour right now
to code it and test it, sorry.

Cheers,

f

Thanks - it installed and built ok :-) 

(I suppose look in the patch next time to know which folder I should be in?) 

Will run a few tests, do the doctests and hopefully we'll knock this one over soon.

Tested the patch with a few statements that exercised the preparser. e.g.

```
sage: %prun 123456789123456789123456789123456789123456789123456789.factor()

sage: %prun print integrate(log(x)^(2^3),x)
```
Pre-patch statements like these crashed or gave incorrect answers if prefixed with "%prun ". 
Post-patch the statements give the same answers with or without "%prun" (and all doctests passed).
Positive review
