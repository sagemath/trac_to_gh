But what should it return?  In particular, what should round(RIF(1.5, 12345.678)) return, and why?

My vote is that RIF should not have a round method, since I can't think of a definition that's sensible and useful.

I wonder why "wontfix" since this now seems to work:

```
sage: sage.rings.real_mpfi.printing_style = 'brackets'
sage: round(RIF(1.5, 12345.678)) 
[2.0000000000000000 .. 12346.000000000000]
