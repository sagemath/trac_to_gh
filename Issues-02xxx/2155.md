Before:

```
sage: a = matrix(QQ, 2, [1, 5, 17, 3]); a
[ 1  5]
[17  3]
sage: time for _ in xrange(10^4): b = a.invert()
CPU times: user 5.74 s, sys: 0.13 s, total: 5.87 s
Wall time: 5.94
```

After:

```
sage: time for _ in xrange(10^4): b = a.invert()
CPU times: user 0.22 s, sys: 0.04 s, total: 0.26 s
Wall time: 0.29
```

This also does not leak memory:

```
sage: get_memory_usage()
'122M+'
sage: time for _ in xrange(10^5): b = a.invert()
CPU times: user 2.33 s, sys: 0.36 s, total: 2.69 s
Wall time: 2.70
sage: get_memory_usage()
'122M+'
```

Works great for me. The doctest for invert() has some spurious code at the top of the examples block though. 

Since you're going to have to be in there anyway, it might be a bit more readable if "t0" was renamed to "det."

I have addressed the referee's (Robert's) two complaints.  I also added an architecture for fast change of base ring and computation of the Hadamard bound.  This second thing is technically unrelated but it was too difficult to separate out safely. 

This is now vastly faster than before

```
sage: a = random_matrix(ZZ,500)
sage: time a.change_ring(RDF)
CPU times: user 0.01 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.02 s
Wall time: 0.02

The code looks good to me, but I just tried to pull these two, in order, on a clean 2.10.1, and it's giving me errors:

You have a warning on the `hadamard_bound` function if the entries are too large--does it raise an error or give erroneous results?
