To replicate this bug:

1. Put show(plot(sin)) in a cell and press shift-enter

2. Then in the *same* cell *delete* show(plot(sin)) and replace it by this and press shift-enter:

```
@interact
def _(n=(1,100)):
   print n^2
```

3. Observe that the plot of sin is still there.

Hi,

Your only reason for giving a negative review was a claim that

```
plot(sin,0,1).show()
@interact
def foo(a="1"):
    a
```
is now "broken".  However, this never did what you thought it
did.  The behavior in fact hasn't changed at all from how it was
before, except to remove the bug where old graphics from
the previous version of the cell remained. 

`@`interact *by design* is only supposed to work when it is
the only thing in a cell. 

Having multiple interacts in a cell, having additional graphics in
a cell, having nested interacts -- none of that should work at present,
since none of it has been implemented. 
They're all things that would possibly be very nice to implement,
but they were not part of the design goals for the first version
of interact.
