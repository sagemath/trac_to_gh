After a vote, almost everybody (including me) agrees with the following:

sage -n:
   run the notebook -- equivalent to "sage -notebook"

sage -bn:
   build sage, then run the notebook -- equivalent to "sage -b; sage -n"

Very, very nice.  It's especially nice how the build function is factored out.

I doubt people will ever use "sage -bn", since the notebook is no longer in the sage library.  However, it can't hurt to have it.  I think "sage -n" will be very useful. 

positive review.
