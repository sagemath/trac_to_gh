Burcin did pop up in IRC a little while ago and reported the same
error. Neither touching the file, not a "sage -ba" nor applying the
patch from #2180 fixes the problem, so I am fresh out of ideas. It
only seems to happen on updates, i.e. in the other cases I saw the
issue a touching of a single file was sufficient. So there is maybe
more than one bug lurking in that code. Since I have been unable to
reproduce the harder problem yet any input (or even better solution)
is welcome :)

Please check out #2295 by burcin, which seems to nail the real culprit, i.e. the symlink problem.

Cheers,
