The canonical example to get to work is the following (submitted by Jason Grout):

```
for i in range(5):
    print html('<script>alert(%s)</script>'%i)
    sleep(1)
```

would pop up a dialog box about every second.


This feature was requested by `gerhard <ge01705@yahoo.de>`.

I don't know the details of the notebook source code, but one possible way to run javascript code out of javascript is writing it dynamically into the source, because it get's evaluated. The hack: unescape escaped characters!

```
<html>
<head>
<script type="text/javascript">
function run() {
   eval(cmd);
}
</script>
</head>
<body>

<script type="text/javascript">
cmd = 'alert("I am an alert")';
</script>

<script type="text/javascript">
document.write(unescape("%3Cscript type='text/javascript'%3E" + "run('" + cmd + "');" + "%3C/script%3E"));
</script>

</body>
</html>
```

the generated source code, after running everything, relevant part:

```
<script type="text/javascript">
document.write(unescape("%3Cscript type='text/javascript'%3E" + "run('" + cmd + "');" + "%3C/script%3E"));
</script><script type="text/javascript">run('alert("I am an alert")');</script>
```

ok, i'm confused, maybe my last comment is helpful for something else - just tested the cannonical exmaple, and it works for me.

Ah, but *does* it?  For me, it first prints out the (empty) lines every second, and only then all the alerts come up (in order) at once.
