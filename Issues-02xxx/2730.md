I get the following doctest errors in the Debian build of SAGE 2.10.4.  I think the problem is that matplotlib.patches got changed to add "from matplotlib.lines as lines" since matplotlib 0.90.1 (the version in debian).

I did the most trivial forward-port of a newer matplotlib for Debian and uploaded to the testing repository at http://web.mit.edu/sage/apt/.

It seems to work.

This is not *#Sage Specific*': Please file a bug report with Debian or alternatively package the Sage version of matplotlib.
