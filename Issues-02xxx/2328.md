They should first be marked deprecated, and later removed. The exact process for doing this is not yet determined; there was some discussion on sage-devel in January. Until more has been decided on that front, I think we should just say in the docstrings "this function will be deprecated in the future, and eventually removed; use Foo.whatever() instead".

I've looked over the patches and give this a positive review.

Since my patch addressing the referee's concerns for #2432 touches a lot of things, I'll build a patch with the changes in #2328 to be included with #2432.
