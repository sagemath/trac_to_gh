In the following example, A should be "upside down", but it's not

```
sage: A = random_matrix(ZZ,3); A

[ 1  3 -1]
[ 4 -3 -1]
[-1  0 -1]

sage: A[range(2,-1,-1),:]

[ 1  3 -1]
[ 4 -3 -1]
[-1  0 -1]

```

The problem is with `set()`, which doesn't preserve order.

The code and doctests look good, and doctests pass in sage/matrix in Sage 2.11.  Unfortunately, applying the patch to Sage 3.0 alpha 2 (the latest I have at the moment) gives a rejected hunk.
