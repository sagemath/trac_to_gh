Clicking the link gives:

You don't have permission to access /home/jkantor/optimize.patch on this server.

Of course, I could fix that since I'm root on that machine... but I'm too busy at the moment.

```
sage: f(x,y)=x^2+y^2
sage: f.gradient()
<type 'exceptions.NotImplementedError'>:
sage: f.parent()
Callable function ring with arguments (x, y)
sage: var('x,y')
sage: g=x^2+y^2
sage: g.gradient()
sage: g.parent()
Symbolic Ring
(2*x, 2*y)
```

I guess this isn't a bug, just not implemented yet? I thought f(x)=x^2 was equivalent to var('x');f=x^2 but evidently they are different?
