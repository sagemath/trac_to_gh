Namely, in the list of completion dialog, pressing the up arrow at the very top killed the whole dialog instead of wrapping around.  This is weird because the list wraps around in all other directions except up.  Also, esc gets one out of the dialog, so up arrow isn't needed to do this.  I suspect it was just tricky to implement this as wrap around, so Tom didn't.  But now in this patch it is \"fixed\".",
