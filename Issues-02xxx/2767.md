The bug is really in `sage/rings/number_field/maps.py`, around line 122. We are given an absolute polynomial, and we want to convert it into a relative polynomial. However, in this case, we want to return a polynomial of degree 0 in the generator for L/K.

Now `m` is just `-1*L.pari_rnf()[0][0]`, so we just evaluate our polynomial there. This will always give us a constant polynomial that's exactly what we want.

If there's some case that I'm not thinking of here, let me know. I've tested it on various degrees, and with relative polynomials other than just `x-a`, and it works in every case I could come up with.

Does this handle fields with unusual defining polynomials, such as F = L.extension(2*x - L.gen())?  I don't think it will.

After discussion on IRC, reviewed positive:

```
craigcitro: hey ncalexan -- did you see i posted a patch for the thing you were looking at last night?
[9:11pm] ncalexan: craigcitro: yes, I just commented on it.  I don't think it will handle polys like 2*x - a, will you check?
[9:12pm] craigcitro: you're right -- but you can't create an extension with such a poly
[9:12pm] craigcitro: (i checked it when i was looking at it)
[9:12pm] ncalexan: Someday I hope to address that, but okay.
[9:12pm] craigcitro: nod
[9:12pm] ncalexan: Comment on the patch, then I'll review positive.
[9:13pm] ncalexan: Actually, wait -- what about x - 2*a?
[9:13pm] craigcitro: that works fine
[9:13pm] craigcitro: i checked those
[9:13pm] ncalexan: You're assuming that x = rel gen when you look at f(rel gen), right?
[9:13pm] craigcitro: then i tried 2*x - a
[9:13pm] craigcitro: and discovered it didn't work
[9:14pm] craigcitro: if the rel poly is x-foo
[9:14pm] ncalexan: Well, there's a test with x - a/2.
[9:14pm] craigcitro: i just plug foo in.
[9:14pm] ncalexan: Okay.  I'll review positive.
