Does this handle fields with unusual defining polynomials, such as F = L.extension(2*x - L.gen())?  I don't think it will.

craigcitro: hey ncalexan -- did you see i posted a patch for the thing you were looking at last night?
[9:11pm] ncalexan: craigcitro: yes, I just commented on it.  I don't think it will handle polys like 2*x - a, will you check?
[9:12pm] craigcitro: you're right -- but you can't create an extension with such a poly
[9:12pm] craigcitro: (i checked it when i was looking at it)
[9:12pm] ncalexan: Someday I hope to address that, but okay.
[9:12pm] craigcitro: nod
[9:12pm] ncalexan: Comment on the patch, then I'll review positive.
[9:13pm] ncalexan: Actually, wait -- what about x - 2*a?
[9:13pm] craigcitro: that works fine
[9:13pm] craigcitro: i checked those
[9:13pm] ncalexan: You're assuming that x = rel gen when you look at f(rel gen), right?
[9:13pm] craigcitro: then i tried 2*x - a
[9:13pm] craigcitro: and discovered it didn't work
[9:14pm] craigcitro: if the rel poly is x-foo
[9:14pm] ncalexan: Well, there's a test with x - a/2.
[9:14pm] craigcitro: i just plug foo in.
[9:14pm] ncalexan: Okay.  I'll review positive.
