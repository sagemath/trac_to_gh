Looks good to me, apply.

Comments:

1. Every single function should have some sort of descriptive text saying what it is doing, even if it doesn't have a doctest since dsage is an exception to the rule. However, to avoid bitrot, this isn't blocking the patch.

2. There are some obsolete code snippets that still use SQLite that need to be removed.
