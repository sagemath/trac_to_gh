Looks good to me, apply.

Comments:

1. Every single function should have some sort of descriptive text saying what it is doing, even if it doesn't have a doctest since dsage is an exception to the rule. However, to avoid bitrot, this isn't blocking the patch.

2. There are some obsolete code snippets that still use SQLite that need to be removed.

NOTE:

In step 2), you actually need 'hg rm sage/dsage/doc', and in step 3), 'hg rm sage/dsage/dist_functions/nodoctest.py' from the branch root. Step 4), you just delete the file.

There is also a step 5): after everything else, apply:

Also, we tested everything against 2.10.3.rc0 (with SQLAlchemy installed), and the instructions worked, and all the tests passed.
