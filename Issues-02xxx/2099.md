`2099-ncalexan-parallel-testing-2.hg` should not depend on the earlier bundle.

This is a work in progress bundle that improves option parsing and makes 'test via make' the only option.  It improves `sage-doctest` slightly and tries to write a `Makefile.doctest` that can be run via command-line `make`.

Use two dashes (`--`) for options.

Output is not yet collated.  Timeouts are not yet implemented.

`2099-ncalexan-parallel-testing-3.hg` should not depend on earlier bundles.

This is a work in progress bundle that adds
* working per-test timeouts
* parsing SAGE_DOCTEST_OPTIONAL, _LONG, _TIMEOUT from the environment
* output via -o OUTFILE
* improves handling of sage-doctest crashing

```

[5:25pm] mabshoff: ncalexan: cool
[5:26pm] ncalexan: mabshoff: I can't think of a way to get partial output correct.  You can display it while it comes, but if you don't wait until the entire test is done, you won't get the sorted output.
[5:26pm] ncalexan: I'll post another bundle.
[5:26pm] ncalexan: Use -v for verbose, -q for quiet, -o OUTFILE.
[5:26pm] ncalexan: (All to sage-test or sage -t)

This creates sage-ptest for parallel test.  The first argument is equivalent to -j (the number of parallel tests to run).  The rest of the arguments are as normal.
