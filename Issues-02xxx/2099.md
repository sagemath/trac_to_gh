`2099-ncalexan-parallel-testing-2.hg` should not depend on the earlier bundle.

This is a work in progress bundle that improves option parsing and makes 'test via make' the only option.  It improves `sage-doctest` slightly and tries to write a `Makefile.doctest` that can be run via command-line `make`.

Use two dashes (`--`) for options.

Output is not yet collated.  Timeouts are not yet implemented.

`2099-ncalexan-parallel-testing-3.hg` should not depend on earlier bundles.

This is a work in progress bundle that adds
* working per-test timeouts
* parsing SAGE_DOCTEST_OPTIONAL, _LONG, _TIMEOUT from the environment
* output via -o OUTFILE
* improves handling of sage-doctest crashing
