The following produces errors:

```
sage: testR.<a,b,c> = PolynomialRing(QQ,3)
sage: id_ringA = ideal([a^2-b,b^2-c,c^2-a])
sage: id_ringB = ideal(id_ringA.gens()).change_ring(PolynomialRing(QQ,'c,b,a')) 
```

although this does not:

```
sage: testR.<a,b,c> = PolynomialRing(QQ,3)
sage: id_ringA = ideal([a^2-b,b^2-c,c^2-a])
sage: id_ringB = ideal(id_ringA.gens()).change_ring(PolynomialRing(QQ,'c,a,b')) 
```

<div id="comment:1" align="right">Comment 1</div>

I don't know what's happening, but maybe the following simpler example will help someone figure it out:

```
sage: R.<a,b,c> = PolynomialRing(QQ, 3)
sage: P = PolynomialRing(QQ, 'c, b, a')
sage: Q = PolynomialRing(QQ, 'c, a, b')
sage: Q(a)
a
sage: P(a)
...
<type 'exceptions.IndexError'>: list assignment index out of range
```

Note also that out of the 6 permutations of 'a, b, c', only 'c, b, a' and 'b, c, a' throw this exception; the other 4 seem to work properly.

<div id="comment:2" align="right">Comment 2</div>

I believe the problem is in _mpoly_dict_recursive() in multi_polynomial.pyx:

```
sage: R.<a,b,c> = PolynomialRing(QQ, 3)
sage: a._mpoly_dict_recursive(['c', 'b', 'a'])
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
<type 'exceptions.IndexError'>            Traceback (most recent call last)

/root/<ipython console> in <module>()

/root/multi_polynomial.pyx in sage.rings.polynomial.multi_polynomial.MPolynomial._mpoly_dict_recursive()

<type 'exceptions.IndexError'>: list assignment index out of range
```

This should return {(0, 0, 1): 1}.  I'm having trouble understanding exactly how the code works so I'm giving up on trying to fix this.  Someone familiar with the code should be able to do this properly, and much faster than me.
