It would be fair to argue that this is pretty sucky behavior in Sage:

```

I'm to blame for both bugs, of course... :-)

Here is yet another problem with time. The following should print out 4 but doesn't.

```
sage: time a = 2 + 2; a
CPU times: user 0.00 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.00 s
Wall time: 0.00
```
It should print 4 since this does:

```
sage: a = 2 + 2; a
4
```

I think this is a Sage problem.  

  sage: time foo

is dealt with by the Sage preparser.  It's code I wrote and you've
probably looked at...

That's an ipython problem.

Well, some of them are fixed:

```
sage: time a = 2 + 2; a
Time: CPU 0.00 s, Wall: 0.00 s
4
sage: 2 + 2; time 2 + 2
4
4
Time: CPU 0.00 s, Wall: 0.00 s
```

But with a comment on the line, we get no timings:

```
sage: time 2 + 2     # Or don't
4
sage:
```

My 2 cents.   I wouldn't close this.  This is in my opinion a bug in Ipython now, but it is still a bug.  

For comparison in a worksheet in https://cloud.sagemath.com, where I implemented things from scratch (yet again), this works just fine:

{{{
INPUT: %time a = 2 + 2; a # or don't
OUTPUT: 4
CPU time: 0.00 s, Wall time: 0.00 s
}}}

It's bad for the behavior of a single line to depend on whether or not it has %time in front of it.    I don't know why IPython doesn't respect the sys.displayhook though.

Perhaps this should be a new ticket though, and it should be reported upstream to ipython.  I.e., it's not longer a "Sage preparser" issue.
