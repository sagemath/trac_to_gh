Hi,

How does one preserve the behavior of docstrings when using
decorators?  I just noticed, for example, that I couldn't easily
access the docstring of various things in rings/polynomial/
multi_polynomial_ideal.py because they have been decorated.  It is
unclear to me how to easily fix that - does anyone know a simple
solution?

Thanks,
M. Hampton

**Attachment:** [sage-2576.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket2576/sage-2576.patch)

To test the attached:

```
R.<x,y,z> = PolynomialRing(QQ, 3, order='lex')
p = z^2 + 1; q = z^3 + 2
I = (p*q^2, y-z^2)*R
pd = I.complete_primary_decomposition?
```

```
By the way
wrapper.__name__=func.__name__
is usually also a good practice.

To test you need 

```
R.<x,y,z> = PolynomialRing(QQ, 3, order='lex')
p = z^2 + 1; q = z^3 + 2
I = (p*q^2, y-z^2)*R
I.complete_primary_decomposition?
``` 
At least I did. Anyway, the patch applies and does what it is supposed to do. Positive review.
