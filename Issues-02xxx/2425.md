Hi,

Currently, if f is a multi-polynomial, the call f.jacob() returns the
list of partial derivatives of f with respect to the ring generators:

```
  sage: R.<x,y,z> = PolynomialRing(QQ)
  sage: f = x^4 + y^3 + z^2 + x*y*z
  sage: f.jacob()
  [4*x^3 + y*z, 3*y^2 + x*z, x*y + 2*z]
```



I'd like to change the name to gradient. Another possibility is changing
the name to 'jacobian', but I think it's likely that more people (eg
calculus students) will recognize the term 'gradient' and not 'jacobian'
than vice-versa.  And who talks about the Jacobian of a single function
anyway? :)


Keywords: **jacob, gradient**

Component: **commutative algebra**

I applied the patch successfully to 2.10.3.rc0 and the test passed ok.

I did a search_source to see if there were any other mentions of "jacob(" and found just one, in interfaces/singular.py.  Here I found the example

```
    sage: R = singular.ring(0, '(x,y,z)', 'dp')
    sage: f = singular('x3+y3+(x-y)*x2y2+z2')
    sage: f
    x^3*y^2-x^2*y^3+x^3+y^3+z^2
    sage: R1 = singular.ring(0, '(x,y,z)', 'ds')
    sage: f = R.fetch(f)
    sage: f
    z^2+x^3+y^3+x^3*y^2-x^2*y^3

We can calculate the Milnor number of $f$:
    sage: _=singular.LIB('sing.lib')     # assign to _ to suppress printing
    sage: f.milnor()
    4

The Jacobian applied twice yields the Hessian matrix of $f$,
with which we can compute.
    sage: H = f.jacob().jacob()
    sage: H
    6*x+6*x*y^2-2*y^3,6*x^2*y-6*x*y^2,  0,
    6*x^2*y-6*x*y^2,  6*y+2*x^3-6*x^2*y,0,
    0,                0,                2
```

which suggests that the name jacob() is standard in singular.  Should there be any sort of cross-reference between the new gradient() and the new jacob() ?
