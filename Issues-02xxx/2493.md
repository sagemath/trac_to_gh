I think reviewing this is easy. In experimental there are already cmake-2.4.7 and vtk-5.0.3

This are only minor updates to the latest versions.

With one exception: vtk-5.0.4 comes now with GL3EPS enabled! Making it possible to save
figures as eps, ps and pdf files.

This update is needed for the mayavi_2.1.1 package!

I used these packages to upgrade from earlier versions of Jaap's packages; the installations went perfectly, and my code (which uses wxPython, vtk, and tvtk (from mayavi)) worked fine after the upgrade.

Debian testing 32-bit x86.

Hi, 

I checked in the changes into the repo. The result is at 

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mabshoff/release-cycles-2.11/experimental/vtk-5.0.4.p0.spkg

I didn't look at SPKG.txt yet

Cheers,

Michael

This spkg depends on cmake-2.4.8 (see spkg-install). Probably it will work also with cmake-2.4.7,
which is already in experimental. But this should be reflected in the spkg-install file.
