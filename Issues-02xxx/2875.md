This is a very serious bug, since it's basic functionality that is completely broken.

By the way, it's the inline fortran stuff that *really* broke it.   See #2891.  This patch programs around that problem, and *also* fixes another path bug, which wasn't a show stopper but did result in some very stupid behavior. 

Component: **notebook**
