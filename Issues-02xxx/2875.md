This is a very serious bug, since it's basic functionality that is completely broken.

By the way, it's the inline fortran stuff that *really* broke it.   See #2891.  This patch programs around that problem, and *also* fixes another path bug, which wasn't a show stopper but did result in some very stupid behavior.

The code looks reasonable to me, but I don't know what to test.  Please add doctests to save_session() and do_sage_extensions_preparsing().

After deleting the first hunk from the patch (since it is deleted anyway via #2901 and I had to resolve that conflict manually) the patch applies cleanly.

Cheers,
