There is no such command in Sage, really.  Maxima
does have such a command, so it would be
possible to implement something easily:

sage: t = var('t')
sage: M = matrix(SR,2,[0,t,-t,0])
sage: mm = maxima(M)
sage: mm.matrixexp()
matrix([%e^-(%i*t)*(%e^(2*%i*t)+1)/2,-%e^-(%i*t)*(%i*%e^(2*%i*t)-%i)/2],[%e^-(%i*t)*(%i*%e^(2*%i*t)-%i)/2,%e^-(%i*t)*(%e^(2*%i*t)+1)/2])

So there will be an M.exp() function in some future version
of Sage.

This one snuck in via one of the bundles from #174 or #2190. Bundles are bad.

It would be nice if anybody could give this a proper review, despite the fact that it already is in 2.10.2.

Cheers,

Michael

Oh, yes, I looked at it, thought it looked good, tried to import the patch and got a bunch of rejects, noticed that it had already been merged.

Conclusion: it's good, should be applied, and was applied.
