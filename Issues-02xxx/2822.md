Valgrind says:

```
==28038== Invalid read of size 4
==28038==    at 0x152C3A90: (within /scratch/mabshoff/release-cycle/sage-3.0.alpha1/local/lib/libgroebner.so)

==28038==  Address 0x5566450 is not stack'd, malloc'd or (recently) free'd
```
This seems to be cause by either the new PolyBoRi.spkg or its interface.

The component for this bug is debatable.

Cheers,

After rebuilding PolyBoRi with debugging options (export SAGE_DEBUG=1) I don't get this invalid read anymore. I've attached a the valgrind log for a simple session.

It might be worth noting that almost all alleged memleaks are due to one call. It might make sense to ask Michael and Alexander about that one.

Mabshoff wrote in sage-devel, that this happens in every sage session.
Does this mean, it even happens, if PolyBoRi isn't used at all.
So it must be some global code.
In libgroebner itself there exist almost no global things, except
some call
static base_generator_type generator(static_cast<unsigned int>(std::time(0)));
(which indeed hasn't been implemented in 0.1).

Yes, afaik it happens even when no PolyBoRi functionality is used so it ought to be global code. Also, in the cleaned up valgrind log, we have:

```
==8421== 16 bytes in 1 blocks are indirectly lost in loss record 63 of 2,800

```

several times and the number of lost bytes increases. So we seem to initialise PolyBoRi several times, maybe?

except the random generator, I can't remember of anything static in libgroebner.
So I would be really interested, of some stack trace in libgroebner.

The trace log of libpolybori indicates, that the destruction of
static BooleEnv::active_ring
affected.

The trace log also indicates, that there happens something in libgroebner accessing it, after its destruction.
But I don't know of global code except that random generator (which doesn't do anything with polynomials).
I am not so very experienced with this low level stuff, but is it possible, that libpolybori and libgroebner both try to destruct BooleEnv::active_ring.

Maybe it would help just linking them together in one common shared library (as we do with our python module).

Attachment: **[CCuddCore.h.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket2822/CCuddCore.h.gz)**

Thanks to Alexander we provide a fixed CCuddCore.h.
I hope, that will fix the invalid reads (at least it should fix the leaks).

Ok, I have finally tracked this down to us linking all three libraries dynamically. Switching to static linking fixes the issue after making sure that we use -fPIC:

```
I also replaced CCuddCore.h with the new version provided by Alexander and it does fix some of the memory leaks. There are more of them, but that will be a new ticket.

The new spkg is at

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mabshoff/release-cycles-3.0/alpha4/polybori-0.3.1.p1.spkg

To test it build it, then 

touch devel/sage/sage/rings/polynomial/pbori.pyx

And to a `sage -b`

Cheers,

Michael

Hi everybody,
I've added a new (somehow cleaner) version of CCuddCore.h. Maybe that fixes some of the remaining leaks.
