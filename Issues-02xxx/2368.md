<div id="comment:2" align="right">Comment 2</div>

I did fix the detection on the last G4 iBook build by Apple. I also created tuning info that will be integrated into the upcoming ATLAS 3.8.1.spkg (see #2269).

The G4 tuning info can be found at

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mabshoff/ATLAS-tune/PPCG432.tgz

Cheers,

Michael
