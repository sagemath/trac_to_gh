This is a security risk, and limits the potential uses of Sage. For example, if I wanted to put a text box on my website where people could type in a function and it would return the derivative (computed using Sage) someone could "ask" for the derivative of `2*os.system('rm -rf /')`. Symbolic expressions should be able to be parsed in such a way that one can safely reject expressions using unknown (or non-whitelisted) functions.

I've looked at the changes and tested things out, and things look good to me.  This is a definite improvement than what was there before.  I included a change to combinat/root_system/dynkin_diagram.py.  2347.hg is the bundle that should be merged.
