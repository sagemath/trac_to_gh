This is a security risk, and limits the potential uses of Sage. For example, if I wanted to put a text box on my website where people could type in a function and it would return the derivative (computed using Sage) someone could "ask" for the derivative of `2*os.system('rm -rf /')`. Symbolic expressions should be able to be parsed in such a way that one can safely reject expressions using unknown (or non-whitelisted) functions.

Of course, we don't want to re-write the Python parser or try to certify generic code to be safe, but in this constrained situation we should be able to treat an expression as data without worrying about it being treated as code. 

There is an added benefit that unknown tokens gan be treated as symbolic variables. I wrote up a parser in Cython that is actually 10 times faster than eval(...) and handles symbolic expressions that I think is ready to plug in, I just need to provide it with a good list of "whitelist" functions that may be called.
