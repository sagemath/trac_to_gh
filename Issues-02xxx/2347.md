This is a security risk, and limits the potential uses of Sage. For example, if I wanted to put a text box on my website where people could type in a function and it would return the derivative (computed using Sage) someone could "ask" for the derivative of `2*os.system('rm -rf /')`. Symbolic expressions should be able to be parsed in such a way that one can safely reject expressions using unknown (or non-whitelisted) functions.

I've attached the bundle as a patch which I will review once 3.0.alpha4 comes out.  There were some problems applying the bundle against 3.0.alpha3.

The new bundle (against alpha3) works fine. There was only one minor conflict. Do you anticipate any major changes with alpha4? (If it's up before I go to bed I'll make sure it works against that.) 

Jason: Using mercurial queues won't help here, the issue is that half a dozen commits were compressed into a single patch.
