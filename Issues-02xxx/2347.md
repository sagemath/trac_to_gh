This is a security risk, and limits the potential uses of Sage. For example, if I wanted to put a text box on my website where people could type in a function and it would return the derivative (computed using Sage) someone could "ask" for the derivative of `2*os.system('rm -rf /')`. Symbolic expressions should be able to be parsed in such a way that one can safely reject expressions using unknown (or non-whitelisted) functions.
