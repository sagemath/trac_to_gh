<a id='comment:8'>Comment 8:</a>
This is now possible with the graph editor widget *phitigra*, added as a package in #30540.
See the demo notebook at https://github.com/jfraymond/phitigra for examples with DFS and Dijkstra's algorithm.
Therefore I am changing the ticket status to "duplicate/invalid/wontfix".
