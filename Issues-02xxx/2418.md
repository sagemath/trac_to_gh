I think the problem may be in how Sage calls polroots; in particular, I'm suspicious of the coercion from CC to pari.

I think that makes this ticket invalid ... Carl, does that seem reasonable to you? In particular, do you have any code you've written that we might fall back on if Pari fails like this?

Robert,

The merging failure is due to the fact that this patch touches the same code as #6237, which just got merged (thank you!).  It is a trivial rebase job, and I am attaching the rebased version.  I kept the old version around so you can see that no other changes were made.

I'm not sure what the protocol is here.  I'd normally go from needs_work to needs_review, but this doesn't really need review...
