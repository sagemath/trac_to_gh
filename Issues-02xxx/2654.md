The current implementation of cyclotomic polynomials in sage/rings/polynomial/cyclotomic.pyx uses the Mobius inversion formula.

I think it would be more efficient to use the recursion

```
\Phi_{p*n}(X) = \Phi_n(X^p) # if p|n
              = \Phi_n(X^p)/\Phi_n(X) # else
```
(though probably not implemented recursively).  This would be simpler than what is currently done, and it would be worth implementing this to see if was really faster.

Secondly, it would be easy to implement a function is_cyclotomic() using the algorithm of Smyth and Beukers.  This could just return True/False, or even n if the input is the n'th cyclotomic poly.  One application would be to improve the function multiplicative_order() for elements of number fields (and more general algebras), by checking if the minimal poly is cyclotomic.  There are a couple of TODOs in sage.rings.number_field.number_field_element which this would address (the algorithm there describes itself as "very dumb" and it is hard to disagree!).

I think this proves it.  Here's my new implementation as a Sage function:

```
def newcyc(n):
    assert n>0
    plist = n.prime_divisors()
    X = PolynomialRing(ZZ,'X').gen()
    f = X-1
    m = n
    for p in plist:
    	f = f(X**p)//f(X)
	m //= p
    return f.subs(X**m)
```

Now newcyc(factorial(10)) takes 15s compared with cyclotomic_polynomial(factorial(10)) whihc takes 108s.  When you take into account the fact that the old function is written in cython while the new one is in sage, I think I have proved my point!  Moreover the code for the new function is very much simpler.

This is due to some (very!) poor conversion code, not due to the algorithm itself. 

```
sage: import sage.rings.polynomial.cyclotomic as c
sage: n = factorial(10)

With timings like that, I couldn't resist

```
sage: time f = cyclotomic_polynomial(factorial(10))
CPU times: user 0.09 s, sys: 0.03 s, total: 0.12 s
Wall time: 0.13
sage: time f = cyclotomic_polynomial(10^5)
CPU times: user 0.01 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.01 s
Wall time: 0.01
sage: time f = cyclotomic_polynomial(10^6)
CPU times: user 0.01 s, sys: 0.01 s, total: 0.02 s
Wall time: 0.02
sage: time f = cyclotomic_polynomial(10^7)
CPU times: user 0.14 s, sys: 0.07 s, total: 0.22 s
Wall time: 0.23
```

Implementing an `is_cyclotomic` function is also a good idea, but probably a separate ticket.

REFEREE REPORT:

It builds fine.  It works fine, but gives the wrong (?) answer for n=1. 

```
sage: cyclotomic_polynomial(1)
-x + 1
sage: gp('polcyclo(1)')
x - 1
sage: magma('CyclotomicPolynomial(1)')
$.1 - 1
```

I also got it to Segfault.  Heh heh:

```
sage: time f = cyclotomic_polynomial(2^30)
sage.bin(3624) malloc: *** error for object 0x6b089e0: incorrect checksum for freed object - object was probably modified after being freed.
*** set a breakpoint in malloc_error_break to debug
sage.bin(3624) malloc: *** error for object 0x6b0cb90: incorrect checksum for freed object - object was probably modified after being freed.
*** set a breakpoint in malloc_error_break to debug


------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occured in SAGE.
This probably occured because a *compiled* component
of SAGE has a bug in it (typically accessing invalid memory)
or is not properly wrapped with _sig_on, _sig_off.
You might want to run SAGE under gdb with 'sage -gdb' to debug this.
SAGE will now terminate (sorry).
------------------------------------------------------------

```

Fix the above 2, and it's a positive review.

But: it causes doctest trouble for me:

By the way, there's a huge time penalty in displaying the results of (say) `cyclotomic_polynomial(2^26)`, after the wall time is displayed and before the poly itself is (which is why in the above clip I assigned the result to a variable instead of outputting it).

The SetLength crash is an NTL issue (NTL has a limit on how large polynomials can be, one can duplicate the error trying to make x<sup>{(2</sup>30)} directly by doing

```
sage: ZZ['x']({2^30: 1})
overflow in SetCoeff
/Users/robert/sage/current/local/bin/sage-sage: line 222: 13929 Abort trap              sage-ipython "$@" -c "$SAGE_STARTUP_COMMAND;"
```

I'll make it throw an error instead of crashing in this case. Does anyone know what the NTL limit is for polynomial degrees? 

Printing taking a long time is a more involved problem, but the real issue here is that we don't have sparse univariate polynomials. 

I'll look at the doctests too, it's strange 'cause I didn't change anything that should have affected combinat.

I implemented fast printing for `ZZ[x]`, but the generic case could be done better in some cases and I didn't touch that. 

As for the limit, it's buried in ntl/include/ctools.h. 

```
#define NTL_OVFBND (1L << (NTL_BITS_PER_LONG-4))
```

which is now checked for (rather than inducing a crash). Also, the failing doctests are fixed.

I would assume this is a 32bit vs. 64bit issue. Man, it is time for FLINT to take over Z[x].
