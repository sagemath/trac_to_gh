```
With the attached patches `8314.patch` (by burcin) and `8315.patch` (by malb) the following now works:

```
sage: B.<x,y,z> = BooleanPolynomialRing(3)
sage: x.subs({x:y})
y
sage: x.subs({'x':y})
y
sage: x.subs(x=y)
y
```

The implementation is far from being perfect but at least the functionality is there now.
