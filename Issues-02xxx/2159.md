This is a followup of {#2111}.

```
R.<x,y> = PolynomialRing(GF(2147483659),order='lex')
I=ideal([x^3-2*y^2,3*x+y^4])
I.dimension()
...
   ? no ring active
   ? `ideal` is undefined
   ? error occurred in STDIN line 170: `ideal sage85=[x + 1431655773*y^4, y^12 + 54*y^2];

...
   ? `2147483659` greater than 2147483647(max. integer representation)
   ? error occurred in STDIN line 172: `ring sage86=2147483659,(x, y),lp;`

**Review**
* the doctest output of `verbose` should be changed to ignore the line numbers:

```
verbose 0 (...: multi_polynomial_ideal.py, dimension) Warning: falling back to very slow toy implementation. 
```
* `deg_lms` is referenced in a comment but doesn't exist;
* could you give a reference for the algorithm implemented?

`variety` will take quite a bit of work. We should split that into a separate ticket & commit the patch for `dimension`, assuming that passes review.
