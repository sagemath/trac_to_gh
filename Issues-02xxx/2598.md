```
This works for some time now:

```
sage: ZZ([1,0], 2)
1
```

and after the patch this also works:

```
sage: ZZ([GF(2)(1),GF(2)(0)], 2)
1
```

It is -- at least for my applications -- common to get a list of bits, do some bitstuff with them and combine them again to an integer.

The patch does what it claims and adds an appropriate doc-test.  There is a small (maybe 7-8%) speed-hit, but I think it is worth it for the improved functionality.

I say it should be applied.
