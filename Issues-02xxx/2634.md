```
sage: k = GF(next_prime(2^31)^2,'x')
sage: k['y,z']
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
OverflowError: long int too large to convert to int
sage: PolynomialRing(k,2,'x,y')
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
OverflowError: long int too large to convert to int
```


This is caused because Sage is trying to use libsingular
to create the poly ring, but should be using its own code
when the size of the base ring is too big. 

Martin Albrecht will be able to fix this very easily.

Hi,

It's good but there are two issues:

1. sage -t sage/schemes/generic/affine_space.py fails:

```
sage -t  schemes/generic/affine_space.py                    **********************************************************************
File "affine_space.py", line 196:

      File "/opt/sage/local/lib/python2.5/site-packages/sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_ring_constructor.py", line 365, in _multi_variate
        R = MPolynomialRing_libsingular(base_ring, n, names, order)
      File "multi_polynomial_libsingular.pyx", line 196, in sage.rings.polynomial.multi_polynomial_libsingular.MPolynomialRing_libsingular.__init__
    ArithmeticError: number of variables must be at least 1
**********************************************************************
```


2. this is minor; there's a typo in the new error message in multi_polynomial_libsingular.pyx: should be

```
raise NotImplementedError, "Number fields are not fully supported yet." 
```

instead of 

```
raise NotImplementedError, "Number fields are not fully support yet."
```

I'll very happily give this a quick positive review as soon as these things get fixed.

To quote William from https://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/t/2d722ebda3887a56

```
I definitely think multivariate polynomial rings with 0 generators
should be supported
for exactly the same reason matrices with 0 rows or columns should be
supported -- algorithms are much more likely to work in corner cases and code
is cleaner.

I've been incredibly glad on numerous occasions that across the board
Sage works very well with matrices that have 0 rows or columns, though
this took a lot of extra work initially.   The only argument put forth for
removing multivariate polynomials rings with 0 generators is "It will
be a no fun to support".   That is not compelling.

William 
```

This leads me to merge this patch now to fix the issue. I assume we will revisit this in the future since Martin commented right after William that

```

libSingular doesn't support it and as soon as more pointers are involved the
generic implementation will too have problems (== NULL pointers). Maybe a
special implementation for zero generators is in order then?

Martin 
```

Cheers,

Michael
