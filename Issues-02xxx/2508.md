It seems that PARI laurent series can only be converted to Sage LaurentSeries if the valuation is >= 0.

Simple example:

```
sage: R = LaurentSeriesRing(QQ, 'q')
sage: R(pari('1/x'))
0                       # Very wrong
sage: R(pari('1/x + O(x^20)'))
Traceback (most recent call last)
[...]
PariError:  (5)
```

Example from John Cremona:

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve('11a1')
sage: R = LaurentSeriesRing(RationalField(),'q')
sage: XY = E.pari_mincurve().elltaniyama()
sage: [R(XY[0]),R(XY[1])]
```

<a id='comment:3'></a>Alex,

That's right, I changed the code to return a proper Laurent series:

```
       R = LaurentSeriesRing(RationalField(),'q')
        XY = self.pari_mincurve().elltaniyama()
        return [1/R(1/XY[0]),1/R(1/XY[1])]
```

But look at what I had to do to coerce the pari Laurent series into the Sage ring R!  X and Y have negative valuation;  I could only get the coercions to work with things of positive valuation, so had to insert two spurious inversions  (for each of X and Y)

The following shoud work but does not:

```
sage: E=EllipticCurve('11a1')
sage: R = LaurentSeriesRing(RationalField(),'q')
sage: XY = E.pari_mincurve().elltaniyama()
sage: [R(XY[0]),R(XY[1])]
```
