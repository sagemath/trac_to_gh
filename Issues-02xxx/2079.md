<div id="comment:2" align="right">comment:2</div>

Lines 938-946 of polynomial_element.pyx seem to be at fault.  This might help:

```
sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
sage: a = 2*x^2+2; a
2*x^2 + 2
sage: a/=2; a
2*x^2 + 2
sage: a/=Integer(2); a
2*x^2 + 2
sage: a/=QQ(2); a
x^2 + 1
```

I note the comment there:

```
        Be careful about coercions (this used to be broken):
            sage: R.<x> = ZZ['x']
            sage: f = x / Mod(2,5); f
            3*x
            sage: f.parent()
            Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Ring of integers modulo 5
```

Personally I would prefer that to be broken than to allow division of a ZZ polynomial by an integer mod 5.  I think the coercion model which says "if there is anything conceivable which could be done to make sense of the input, the do it, even if it makes little or no mathematical sense", has something wrong with it.

But someone with more knowledge of the coercion code will have to deal with this one, which is certainly very serious.

That (=PARI, Mathematica, etc) is definitely *not* supposed 
to be Sage's coercion model.

That said, dividing a ZZ poly by an integer mod 5 does make perfectz
sense in the coercion model.  There is a natural map from ZZ to ZZ/5ZZ,
hence a natural map `ZZ[x] --> (ZZ/5ZZ)[x]`.  The poly is mapped
to (ZZ/5ZZ)[x] and then the division takes place.  It is well defined,
natural, canonical, and certainly not ad hoc.

The problem is around line 869 of coerce.pyx, where if we put:

```
        if self.connecting is not None:
            print "g before = ", g
            g = self.connecting._call_c(g)
            print "g after = ", g
```

then run the sample code:

```
sage: R.<x> = QQ[]; a = 2*x^2+2
sage: a /= 2
g before =  1/2
g after =  1
3 2*x^2 + 2 1
```

you see that self.connecting._call_c is somehow replacing 1/2 by 1.  Not good.

I'm about to attach a patch that adds several functions related to making the coercion model a little more user friendly (for debugging), fixes/adds more documentation, and MOST IMPORTANTLY, re-enables some disabled type checking that lead to some potentially seriously bugs in the basic arithmetic in Sage.   I also put some commented out code that doesn't look right to me that would fix the above problem.  I hope that Robert will:

2. Make some changes to genuinely fixes the action.pyx file;

3. Make a patch over the above patch that incorporates those fixes, and probably disables the type checking that I enabled. 

Anyway, again, the core root cause of this problem is that InverseAction in action.pyx is not implemented correctly and/or makes invalid assumptions, and ends up calling this bit of code in rational.pyx with an x that is of type Rational:

```
    cdef Element _call_c_impl(self, Element x):
        cdef Rational rat
        rat = <Rational> PY_NEW(Rational)
        mpq_set_z(rat.value, (<integer.Integer>x).value)
        return rat
```

The result is wrong answers.

 OK, I admit that this does make sense.  Just after posting that I realised that for many years,  in pari, if I ever wanted to input a polynomial mod 5 I would type something like 

```
f = (x^2+1) * Mod(1,5)
```
 which -- apart from being a multiplication and not a division -- shows that I do know that this makes sense.

 Trying to understand what was going wrong in this case got me into very deep water in the coercion mode;  I look forward to seeing the patches which make that easier to understand what is going on.  The notes at http://wiki.sagemath.org/days7/coercion will be very helpful.  ARe they a description of what is currently in place, or a wish list for what should be, or somewhere between the two?

REFEREE REPORT: 

I've read through and tested the code and it (1) looks good, and (2) fixes a critical bug in basic arithmetic in Sage that would lead to basic wrong answers.  The code looks good and adds a lot of nice documentation.  Thus this should definitely be applied!

I really think documenting the heck out of all the coercion model related files should be the absolute number one priority in all the coercion model stuff you guys are doing.  If that code were documented and the coercion model itself were way friendly wrt introspection (i.e., understanding it interactively from the command line and/or graphically), then people would be VASTLY more likely to dive in and help with revamping things according to your vision.
