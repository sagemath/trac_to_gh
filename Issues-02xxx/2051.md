It might be a good idea not to document features that don't work. (I.e., as outlined in #2052, draw_matrices, invert, noro, preprocess_only) As a matter of fact, I am not sure if all the other options work as they should. Maybe we should include optional doctests for them.

BTW, last time I asked Michael Brickenstein, `PolyBoRi` did not include a usable noro implementation.
