The Dancing Links algorithm (DLX) is sweet.  It solves the Exact Cover problem with the quickness.

Arguments for including Ajanki's code:
* It's the only Python implementation of DLX I've seen.
* I emailed the author, who happily added the "or later" bit after the GPL2
* With my Sage Matrix -> DLXMatrix code (plus docstrings to everything I added), the file dlx.py is only 8kB!
* It will resolve tickets #1311 and #1313

+1 to include this in Sage.

I haven't formally refereed it.

You should just attach a single plain text patch instead of an hg bundle.

This patch (although awesome) doesn't quite obey the new doctest-for-every-function rule, since the following functions do not have doctests:

1. `walknodes`
2. `constructmatrix`
3. `covercolumn`
4. `uncovercolumn`
5. `dosearch`
6. `solve`

In the creation of these doctests, I have discovered a wondrous resolution of P vs. NP, but the proof was too long to justify appending to the patch.
