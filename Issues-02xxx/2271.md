The Dancing Links algorithm (DLX) is sweet.  It solves the Exact Cover problem with the quickness.

Arguments for including Ajanki's code:
* It's the only Python implementation of DLX I've seen.
* I emailed the author, who happily added the "or later" bit after the GPL2
* With my Sage Matrix -> DLXMatrix code (plus docstrings to everything I added), the file dlx.py is only 8kB!
* It will resolve tickets #1311 and #1313

Component: **combinatorics**

+1 to include this in Sage.

I haven't formally refereed it.

You should just attach a single plain text patch instead of an hg bundle.

This patch (although awesome) doesn't quite obey the new doctest-for-every-function rule, since the following functions do not have doctests:

1. `walknodes`
2. `constructmatrix`
3. `covercolumn`
4. `uncovercolumn`
5. `dosearch`
6. `solve`

2271_doctests.patch implements world peace, washes your dishes, and makes coffee before your alarm goes off in the morning.  It's truly amazing.  Also, it contains doctests for everything in sight, reworks the DLXMatrix class to be a real python generator class, and implements an iterative formulation of DLX.

In the creation of these doctests, I have discovered a wondrous resolution of P vs. NP, but the proof was too long to justify appending to the patch.
