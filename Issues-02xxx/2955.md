We do not ship any Fortran compiler for Linux/Itanium. Since any reasonable distribution on Itanium ships GFortran automate detection for that special case. With this ticket, #2953 and 2954 Sage 3.0 should build out of the box on SageNet's RHEL 5 and SLES 10 Itanium test boxen.

Cheers,

Michael

#1642 does fix most of the problem already, but on some Itanium systems [RHEL 5 for example] there is no libgfortran.so, only a libgfortran.so.1.

I added some more verbose output, check the arch flag for also i[345]86 [which like could cause bugs on some other systems, check for libgfortran.so[.1] relative to gfortran and link that lib into SAGE_LOCAL/lib. This makes the fortran.spkg work out of the box on RHEL 5/Itanium.
