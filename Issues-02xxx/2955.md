We do not ship any Fortran compiler for Linux/Itanium. Since any reasonable distribution on Itanium ships GFortran automate detection for that special case. With this ticket, #2953 and 2954 Sage 3.0 should build out of the box on SageNet's RHEL 5 and SLES 10 Itanium test boxen.

#1642 does fix most of the problem already, but on some Itanium systems [RHEL 5 for example] there is no libgfortran.so, only a libgfortran.so.1.
