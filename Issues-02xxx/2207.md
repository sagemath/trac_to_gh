When I tested 2.10.3.rc2 I got this:

```
sage -t  devel/sage-main/sage/matrix/matrix_symbolic_dense.pyxemacs devel/sage-main/sage/matrix/matrix_symbolic_dense.pyx**********************************************************************
File "matrix_symbolic_dense.pyx", line 871:
    sage: list(a.fcp())
Expected:
    [(x^2 - 65*x - 250, 1), (x, 3)]
Got:
    [(x, 3), (x^2 - 65*x - 250, 1)]
**********************************************************************
```

and I suggest changing line 871 from

```
            sage: list(a.fcp())
```
to

```
            sage: sorted(list(a.fcp()))
```
