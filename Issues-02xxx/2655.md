```
This patch allows circular cdef imports in Cython.
It also modifies cython exceptions to also print the line number in the C code.
Furthermore the patch begins modifications to seperate module creation from module global execution, which will potentially be useful as Cython starts to employ more optimizations.   
This patch is required for the symbolics overhaul.

Assignee: @garyfurnish

Resolution: fixed
