This patch allows circular cdef imports in Cython.
It also modifies cython exceptions to also print the line number in the C code.
Furthermore the patch begins modifications to seperate module creation from module global execution, which will potentially be useful as Cython starts to employ more optimizations.   
This patch is required for the symbolics overhaul.

Hi Robert,

I have merged the latest (April 8th) cython.spkg. I saw the message on the Cython mailing list, so I am not surprised that it did come. But I would recommend opening [or reopening] a ticket and also bumping the version number to p0 to reflect this change.

Cheers,
