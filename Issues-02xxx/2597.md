This patch allows a BipartiteGraph to be created from a reduced adjacency matrix and return the same.  Multi-edge or weighted constructions are supported.  Also, it adds support for creation, loading, and saving bipartite graphs in alist format.

Component: **graph theory**

The reduced_adjacency_matrix() function right now returns zero-one matrices over ZZ for normal bipartite graphs.  For multigraphs it will return matrices over ZZ with some entries possibly > 1.

RE:
"Weighted graphs return a matrix over the field of the label of their first edge."

There are smarter ways to approach this. First, you might take a look at the weighted adjacency matrix constructor in `graph.py`, which finds a suitable common parent implicitly, through the matrix constructor. What this basically does is construct a sequence, and retrieve its universe:

```
sage: Sequence([4/5, 3]).universe()
Rational Field
sage: i = CC(i)
sage: Sequence([4/5, 3, i]).universe()
Complex Field with 53 bits of precision
```
