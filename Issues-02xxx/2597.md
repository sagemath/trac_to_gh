This patch allows a BipartiteGraph to be created from a reduced adjacency matrix and return the same.  Multi-edge or weighted constructions are supported.  Also, it adds support for creation, loading, and saving bipartite graphs in alist format.

The reduced_adjacency_matrix() function right now returns zero-one matrices over ZZ for normal bipartite graphs.  For multigraphs it will return matrices over ZZ with some entries possibly > 1.

If a weighted bipartite graph is created from a reduced adjacency matrix, it stores the original value as the label for each non-zero matrix element.  This will work fine for matrices over ZZ as well.  \n\nBut if you `_start_` with a reduced adjacency matrix over GF(2^8), for instance, create a bipartite graph describing its structure, and then ask for the reduced adjacency matrix back, you will get back the original matrix over GF(2^8).  So the only way you can get a matrix over a ring besides ZZ is to `_start_` with a matrix not over ZZ, create its bipartite graph, and then ask for the reduced adjacency matrix back.  \n\nActually that last statement is not entirely accurate.  Only weighted graphs will return a R.A.M. over a field other than ZZ.  Weighted graphs return a matrix over the field of the label of their first edge.  If they have no edges, they return a matrix over GF(2).\n\nI'll try again.  I'll make the default matrix field ZZ even for weighted graphs without edges.

First, you might take a look at the weighted adjacency matrix constructor in `graph.py`, which finds a suitable common parent implicitly, through the matrix constructor.

"Weighted graphs return a matrix over the field of the label of their first edge."

There are smarter ways to approach this. First, you might take a look at the weighted adjacency matrix constructor in `graph.py`, which finds a suitable common parent implicitly, through the matrix constructor. What this basically does is construct a sequence, and retrieve its universe:

```
sage: Sequence([4/5, 3]).universe()
Rational Field
sage: i = CC(i)
sage: Sequence([4/5, 3, i]).universe()
Complex Field with 53 bits of precision
```
