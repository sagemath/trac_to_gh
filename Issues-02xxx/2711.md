From Craig Citro, in reference to #2664: 

Given that there's this nice code for computing symplectic bases, it might be nice for someone to write a SymplecticSpace class that inherits from some kind of vector space class, and uses this code behind the scenes where necessary. (Do we already have an inner product space class?)
