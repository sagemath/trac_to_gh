[03:19] <mabshoff> wstein-2901: the reject for #2883 is the following:
[03:20] <mabshoff> it is: onKeyUp    = 'return cell_input_resize(this);'
[03:20] <mabshoff> the patch expects: onKeyUp    = 'return cell_input_resize(%s);' 
[03:20] <mabshoff> And it want to replace it with: onKeyUp    = 'return input_keyup(%s, event);' 
[03:20] <wstein-2901> mabshoff -- it should be this.
[03:20] <wstein-2901> "this"
[03:20] <wstein-2901> Oh, I see.
[03:20] <wstein-2901> hmm.
[03:21] <wstein-2901> It should be: onKeyUp    = 'return input_keyup(%s, event);'
[03:21] <mabshoff> ok.
[03:21] <mabshoff> wstein-2901: merging it like that then
