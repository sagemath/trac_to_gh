The proposed linbox-1.1.5rc1.p0 crashes on OS X 10.5-intel for charpoly computations. The bug shows up at initialization of static variables, and may be related to the specific OS X gcc compiler behaviour.

http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-bugs/2004-02/msg02055.html, may help. 

Same issue as #2388, but need a clean fix.
