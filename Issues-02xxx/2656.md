```
If you use "sage -hg" with arguments containing spaces, like:

```
  sage -hg commit -m "This is my great new code."
```
then the argument gets split up, so Mercurial sees something more like

```
  hg commit -m This is my great new code.
```
(and tries to check in files named is,my,great,new,code., with a commit message of "This").

We need to escape the '"' (and probably some other characters):

```
[mabshoff@localhost ~]$ ./foo.bash commit -m "This is my great new code."
commit -m This is my great new code.
[mabshoff@localhost ~]$ ./foo.bash commit -m \"This is my great new code.\"
commit -m "This is my great new code."
```
where foo.bash is

```/bin/bash
echo "$@"
```

Cheers,

Michael
