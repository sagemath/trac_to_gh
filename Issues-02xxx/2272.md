While nosing around #1284, I ran into some more trouble with subgroups of abelian groups:

```
sage: A = G.subgroup([a])
sage: G.<a,b> = AbelianGroup(2)
sage: A = G.subgroup([a])
sage: a in A   # should return True
False
sage: A.gens()
[a]
sage: A.0      # should return a
f
```

<a id='comment:1'></a>I have no idea how to fix this. The __contains__ method on the subclass AbelianGroup_subgroup will default to the parent class if pass or an error is passed. This has messed up every attempt I have made.
One issue is that the group is infinite, so perhaps a NotImplementedError makes sense here?

is a bug or feature.
