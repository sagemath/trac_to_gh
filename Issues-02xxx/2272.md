While nosing around #1284, I ran into some more trouble with subgroups of abelian groups:

```
sage: A = G.subgroup([a])
sage: G.<a,b> = AbelianGroup(2)
sage: A = G.subgroup([a])
sage: a in A   # should return True
False
sage: A.gens()
[a]
sage: A.0      # should return a
f
```

I have no idea how to fix this. The `__contains__` method on the subclass AbelianGroup_subgroup will default to the parent class if pass or an error is passed. This has messed up every attempt I have made.
One issue is that the group is infinite, so perhaps a NotImplementedError makes sense here?

The way G.subgroup([a]) is currently written, if you want the generators to have anything other than the default name (f or f1, f2, ...), you must name them explicitly. So, I'm not sure if

```
sage: A.0      # should return a
f
```
is a bug or feature.
