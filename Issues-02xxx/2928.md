Hi Robert, 

my alpha5 merge tree doesn't experience the problem:

```
mabshoff@sage:/scratch/mabshoff/release-cycle/sage-3.0.alpha5$ ./sage
----------------------------------------------------------------------
| SAGE Version 3.0.alpha4, Release Date: 2008-04-12                  |
| Type notebook() for the GUI, and license() for information.        |
----------------------------------------------------------------------

sage: K.<b> = Qp(13).extension(x^2+x-1)
sage:
```
I would suggest you wait for alpha5 [out once I merge #2927, #2929 and the LinBox.spkg update not yet in trac] and then verify that it works for you, too.

Cheers,

Michael

This is fixed in my alpha4 tree (which also has #2903 and #2928 applied):

```
sage: K.<b> = Qp(13).extension(x^2+x-1)
sage: print K
Unramified Extension of 13-adic Field with capped relative precision 20 in b defined by (1 + O(13^20))*x^2 + (1 + O(13^20))*x + (12 + 12*13 + 12*13^2 + 12*13^3 + 12*13^4 + 12*13^5 + 12*13^6 + 12*13^7 + 12*13^8 + 12*13^9 + 12*13^10 + 12*13^11 + 12*13^12 + 12*13^13 + 12*13^14 + 12*13^15 + 12*13^16 + 12*13^17 + 12*13^18 + 12*13^19 + O(13^20))
```
so this ticket is being closed.

It's too late at night for me to write a patch for this now, but I'll probably take a shot at it tomorrow unless somebody else wants to.

Following the suggestion from Roed on IRC, the attached patch allocates `ZZ_pX tmp` with large enough coefficient size to handle all moduli.

Done for both `PowComputer_ZZ_pX_small` and `PowComputer_ZZ_pX_big`.

(Please ignore the first patch (it broke `_big`), and only apply/review the second.)
