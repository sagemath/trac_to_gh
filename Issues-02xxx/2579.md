If we want a.div(b) to be floor(a/b) (which I agree we probably do, if we want the method to exist at all), the correct fix is to change from mpz_tdiv_qr to mpz_fdiv_q.

I think the basis logic should be as below. Since this will make the remainder always positive.

```
if mpz_sgn(_other.value) == 1:
            mpz_fdiv_q(q.value, _self.value, _other.value)

I used quo_rem to redefine div. I would have essentially copied and pasted quo_rem otherwise.
