sage: a//4

sage: a.div(4)

```

    return q

If we want a.div(b) to be floor(a/b) (which I agree we probably do, if we want the method to exist at all), the correct fix is to change from mpz_tdiv_qr to mpz_fdiv_q.

I think the basis logic should be as below. Since this will make the remainder always positive.

```
if mpz_sgn(_other.value) == 1:
