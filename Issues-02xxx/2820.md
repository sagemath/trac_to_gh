This patch depends on #2840 and #2852.  

I think the plan should be 
1. get rid of it; 
2. make much better jsmath instructions;
3. put something like it back (that doesn't suck)

Also, we could support official jsmath image fonts (150MB) as an optional package.

* makes some small cosmetic changes to finish #2852
* restores backspace in empty cell to delete functionality (to avoid confusion)
