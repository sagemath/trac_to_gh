This patch depends on #2840 and #2852.  

I think the plan should be 
1. get rid of it; 
2. make much better jsmath instructions;
3. put something like it back (that doesn't suck)

Also, we could support official jsmath image fonts (150MB) as an optional package.

The attached patch does the following:
* turns off the jsmath warning
* greatly improves how the input text area gets autoresized
* fixes all cursor/tab location bugs from #2840
* makes some small cosmetic changes to finish #2852
* restores backspace in empty cell to delete functionality (to avoid confusion)
* turns on javascript compression so main.js is 1/3rd the size, which means loading sage worksheets will be faster. 
* get rid of lisp from the list-of-systems menu, since it doesn't work.
