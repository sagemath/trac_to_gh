[attachment: trac2357_make_flint_default_for_ZZx.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket2357/trac2357_make_flint_default_for_ZZx.patch.gz) replaces `sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_integer_dense_ntl.*` in the tree with `sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_integer_dense_flint.*` and makes FLINT the default backend for ZZ[x] arithmetic.

FLINT 1.0.10 is required for the patch, you can get the spkg here:

I've attached two patches.  The first, trac2357_make_flint_default_for_ZZx-edited.patch, is a hand-edited version of Burcin's patch that does not delete the NTL wrapper.  The second patch, trac2357-poly-ring-implementation.patch, adds an "implementation=" parameter to PolynomialRing, so that you get:

```
sage: PolynomialRing(ZZ, 'x')
Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Integer Ring
sage: PolynomialRing(ZZ, 'x', implementation='NTL')
Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Integer Ring (using NTL)
```
(the first version uses FLINT, which is the default).

Changes:
- Add signal wrapper macros in various places to allow the user to interrupt the computation.
- Handle division by zero in `__floordiv__`, which led to a crash with the previous patch.

REFEREE REPORT:

This looks great! 

* The FLINT wrapper is excellent. I haven't tried out too many corner cases beyond what the doctests do, but everything looks good. Of course, with FLINT, things are **really** fast: William and I tried out a benchmark that gets used in modular symbols code, and FLINT is something like 10-12X faster than NTL, and 2X as fast as Magma. And now it's in by default ...

* Carl's work on setting up the `implementation='NTL'` is also great. It's very easy to use NTL if you choose, and Carl was also quite conscientious about this: notice the changes in the doctests, for instance.

Given how much work was already done, I've just gone ahead and fixed the small issues I ran into in another patch. There were a handful of small typos, and a few functions that weren't doctested, so I've added doctests for all of these. Both `polynomial_integer_dense_ntl.pyx` and `polynomial_integer_dense_flint.pyx` are now at 100% coverage. 

In doing this, I noticed that the `div` function has the same functionality as `//` (i.e. `__floordiv__`), so I removed it uniformly throughout sage. (I first removed it in this code, and then found out this was used elsewhere, so it had to go elsewhere, too.) In doing so, I also noticed that our convention for `a%b` in the case of `b<0` also went against all the standard conventions, so I fixed that. 

Someone should probably look over the changes I've made, and give them a positive review. Once that happens, this is ready to get merged. One can merge the three patches in order, or just use the bundle (which actually only has those three changesets) I've attached.
