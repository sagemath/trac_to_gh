By "tutorial", I assume this refers to the official tutorial on Sage. Then "Section 5.3" of that tutorial can be found online [here](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/tut/node55.html), which shows this

```
bash $ ./factor 2006
2 * 17 * 59
```
The same snippet can also be found within the [PDF version](http://www.sagemath.org/doc-pdf/tut.pdf) of the official tutorial, on page 76. In both the online and PDF versions, I don't see any misformatting at all.

Regards,

Minh Van Nguyen
