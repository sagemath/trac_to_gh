Attachment: **[mpoly_coverage_100.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket2702/mpoly_coverage_100.patch.gz)**

This is a positive review about the patch, but it's a big patch and could use another set of eyes, I expect.  I think it looks like it cleans up a lot of evolved changes to make the whole thing more cohesive.  I did not apply and doc-test (because I don't have a recent 2.11.alphaX build).

Two specific comments:
* 1) I think the documentation of is_monomial should be very clear that 2*x is not monomial (with a sentence in the initial header).  This is not my intuitive definition of monomial, but it's a sane definition.  I would prefer that 2*x be a monomial, but it's not a big deal.
* 2)  I see a number of lines like

```
sage: Q.<x,y,z>=MPolynomialRing(QQ,3)
```
I think they should be one of the following:

```
sage: Q.<x,y,z>=PolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: Q.<x,y,z>=QQ[]
```
William has made the comment that doc-tests should represent good sage usage and I think both of those are better than the first (certainly the "3" is unnecessary and obnoxious -- I suspect it's only recently that the 3 wasn't required.).  I think there is some room for personal opinion here -- perhaps some mixture is also good to let people see alternate styles as well.

I'll add that to the docstring.

It is still not clear what will happen to `MPolynomialRing` and `PolynomialRing`, but I'll remove the unnecessary "3".

Upon more checking, I noticed that MPolynomial_polydict takes the differing convention.  They certainly should be consistent -- I don't care which way.

I changed many of the doctests to use a more "modern" style for constructing the polynomial rings.  I also changed is_monomial to treat 2*x as a monomial since it agrees with _polydict and matches the standard mathematical definition for a monomial.

Apply the last two patches.  They apply to 2.11 alpha1 and pass -testall

Please don't!
* there is no standard mathematical definition for a monomial. If **t = 2xy** Cox, Little, O'Shea call **xy** a monomial and **2xy** a term in "Ideals, Varieties, and Algorithms". Becker and Weispfennig call **xy** the term and **2xy** the monomial in "Gröbner Bases".
* Singular is inconsistent: `lead` returns the leading term and means **2yx**, `leadmonom` returns **yx** but they define a monomial as

```
[coefficient] ring_variable [ exponent] [ring_variable [exponent] ...]
```
* Magma has **yx** == monomial too: "A monomial (or power product) of P is a product of powers of the variables (or indeterminates) of P, that is, an expression of the form x1> ... xn> with ei ≥0 for 1 ≤i ≤n. Multivariate polynomials in Magma are stored efficiently in distributive form, using arrays of coefficient-monomial pairs, where the coefficient is in the base ring R. The word `term' will always refer to a coefficient multiplied by a monomial."
* Sage is (or should be) strict so far: `lm()` returns **xy** and not **2yx**

I've updated 2702-referee.patch to use the old definition of monomial, added an extra docstest, and a sentence in the docstring describing what it's using for the definition of monomial.


This should probably be taken to sage-devel.


I'm fine with the last two patches being applied.
