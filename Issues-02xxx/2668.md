It does usually complain if the `loads(dumps())` test isn't define since it pickling is required for DSage to work. Otherwise the patch looks nice, but cwitty should be the one to referee this.\n\nCheers,\n\nMichael",

Looks good.  "sage -coverage" does want doctests for `__reduce__` methods, so I copied Nick's doctests from the module header into the `__reduce__` methods in my attached patch.

Apply both patches.
