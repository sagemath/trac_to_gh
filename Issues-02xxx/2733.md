Is this bug important enough to bother Bill Allombert (the maintainer of PARI in Debian) to upgrade PARI in Debian?

This is not "Sage Specific": This is a packaging bug in Debian's pari.deb and should be filed as a bug report at the Debian bug tracker. See http://wiki.sagemath.org/TracGuidelines for the rules that up to now weren't written down.

Cheers,

Michael
