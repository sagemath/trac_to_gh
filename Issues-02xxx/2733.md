Is this bug important enough to bother Bill Allombert (the maintainer of PARI in Debian) to upgrade PARI in Debian?

sage -t  devel/sage-main/sage/matrix/tests.py               **********************************************************************
File "tests.py", line 55:
    sage: a.mathnf(1)[1][1,] == gp('[4, 2, 1, 0, 3, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 0, 0, 1, 3]')
Expected:
    True
Got:
    False

This is not "Sage Specific": This is a packaging bug in Debian's pari.deb and should be filed as a bug report at the Debian bug tracker. See http://wiki.sagemath.org/TracGuidelines for the rules that up to now weren't written down.

Cheers,

Michael
