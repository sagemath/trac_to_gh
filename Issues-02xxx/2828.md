**Review**
* patch applies cleanly
* patch looks good but I'm not an expert on the subject matter
* coverage is indeed 100% as advertised
* doctests pass
* some small issues are:
  * some "possibly wrong"s are reported, see `trac_2828_fixes.patch`
  * one typo, see `trac_2828_fixes.patch`
  * a couple of classes don't have `loads(dumps(s))` doctests
* However, this shouldn't stop the patch from being applied. 
* I say apply asap, don't let this big patch bitrot.

I provide a partial fix for the issues mentioned above. The patch does not fix all issues because I ran out of steam.
