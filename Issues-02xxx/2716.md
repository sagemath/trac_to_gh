**Review**
* I cannot vouch for the math
* `trac_2716_gfan_polyhedra.patch` applies cleanly against `3.0.alpha1`
* all methods have doctests
* I find the coding/interface style slightly strange and un-Sage-ish:

```
sage: po = extreme_verts([[1,2],[2,2],[2,1],[0,0]]) 
sage: po.ex_vertices 
[[1, 1, 2], [1, 2, 2], [1, 2, 1], [1, 0, 0]] 
```
* But that shouldn't be a show-stopper, I'm giving it a preliminary positive review
* PS: My first review with mercurial queues ;-)

I do plan on cleaning this up more; I am still giving a lot of thought
to what polytope classes there should be, and how they should behave,
etc.   When I rearrange things again I will try to give variable names
more suggestive names.    In the example below, "po" was my temporary
shorthand for PolyhedralObject, which is a class that I know I will
change.

Thanks for the review.

Sorry for not being more precise:
* it might be fine for the particular situation but general, having functions rather than methods feels odd to me. However, in some cases it is just better.
* It is quite seldom in the Sage library that attributes are actually accessed as attributes, like: `po.ex_vertices`, whereas in Sage it is more likely to meet `po.ex_vertices()`. However, Python encourages your coding style and I think Sage is off the path here.

Installs cleanly. sage -testall passed all tests (on an old rather cantankerous machine) but 

```
The following tests failed:


        sage -t  devel/sage/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/monsky_washnitzer.py
```
However, when I reran sage -t devel/sage/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/monsky_washnitzer.py,
I got all tests passed. I especially like the render_wireframe plotting function.

Looks like a very interesting patch and I vote to apply it.

We frown upon `from foo.bar import *`, so please fix those.
