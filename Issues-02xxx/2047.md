Trying to use fast float evaluation with multivariate polynomials gives error messages like:

```
    AttributeError: 'sage.rings.polynomial.multi_polynomial_libsingular' object has no attribute '_fast_float_'
```

The attached patch fixes this, so that fast float evaluation works with multivariate polynomials.

Attachment: **[trac-2047.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket2047/trac-2047.patch.gz)**

Works, massively speeds things up (easily a factor of 100), and looks good.

```
sage: R.<x,y,z> = QQ[]
sage: f = (x+y+z+1)^20
sage: h = f._fast_float_()
sage: time for _ in xrange(100): k = f(1,2,3)
CPU times: user 3.81 s, sys: 0.02 s, total: 3.84 s
Wall time: 3.87
sage: time for _ in xrange(100): k = h(1,2,3)
CPU times: user 0.04 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.04 s
Wall time: 0.05
sage: 3.84 / 0.04
96.0000000000000
```

My five cents:
* shouldn't this be restricted to polynomials over QQ? To me it doesn't make sense to have a `_fast_float_` for polynomials over say GF(2).
* because speed is so important, please note that using `f.dict()` is a quite slow way of getting the (coefficient,monomial) pairs.

I am not objecting this patch goes in, but maybe a follow-up patch could address these?
