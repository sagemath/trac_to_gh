It fails because it used to be that there was a bug where when
plotting the left and right endpoints were omitted, because the sample
points were *all* randomized!  This really
annoyed a lot of people, especially people making animations,
but allowed the above example to work.

I think the solution is to fix our plotting code so that it just automatically
completely ignores a few bad values (like it used to), possibly printing
a warning.
