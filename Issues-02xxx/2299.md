This adds the `zero_matrix` convenience constructor, just like `identity_matrix`.

You replaced "n x n" by "$n \times n$" which reads nicer if typesetted. However, it is harder to comprehend from the command line (`foo?`).

I am not sure that we need `identity_matrix` and `zero_matrix` (i.e. the functional versions of `MS(0)` and `MS(1)`) but that is a matter of taste.

Just a quick remark.  You can make a zero matrix using the matrix function:

```
sage: matrix(ZZ, 2,3)
[0 0 0]
[0 0 0]
```

I don't think that's a good reason not to add zero_matrix and identity_matrix
functions though, both of which I would like to have too.

REFEREE REPORT:

I definitely think these functions should go in, but with TWO caveats. 

1. I think the zero_matrix should have an option to be nonsquare though.  Please post another patch that adds that, so, e.g.,

```
sage: zero_matrix(ZZ, 2,3)
[0 0 0]
[0 0 0]
```

works. 

2. There should be a sparse option for both zero_matrix and
identity_matrix.

```
sage: zero_matrix(ZZ, 2,3, sparse=True).parent()
Full MatrixSpace of 2 by 3 sparse matrices over Integer Ring
```

`2299-ncalexan-zero-matrix-2.patch` should apply without the previous patch, and should address the referee's comments.

I generated this patch using hg diff between two revisions, not hg export.  Let me know if it's not okay.
