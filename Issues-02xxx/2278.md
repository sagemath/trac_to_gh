Hello William,

I spoke too soon ... I stated on the forum that it was fixed.
However, I just uploaded another worksheet called Graphing, and I'm
receiving the Permission Denied error again.

Regards,
Andy

<div id="comment:1" align="right">comment:1</div>

In sage-3.0.1 already this line is around line 1370 of worksheet.py:

```
        os.system('chmod -R a+rw "%s"'%absD)
```
That must do enough to set permissions as needed.  I suspect this problem
is either completely solved or was very special to some unix setup I had.  Also, the user reporting the problem has been using the public notebook even recently (two months later) with no further complaints.
