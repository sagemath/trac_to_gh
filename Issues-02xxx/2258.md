Currently the dsage documentation lies inside it's own module. It would be much better if it were included in the sage-doc package.

You just have to edit some files in devel/doc/ref/.  I've made this directory much more cleanly structured. Read the file README.txt in devel/doc/ref.

Hi Yi,

that is exactly the info you need to supply to get a ticket closed. It is nothing personal, but somebody else who will looks at this ticket need to be clear immediately why it was closed, i.e. with a reference to another ticket in this case. This it is difficult to get right. I myself have closed tickets 5+ months ago and needed to look long and hard to figure out why, so I have come up with a certain workflow that seems to work well. Obviously, if you have some suggestions on how to improve things are always welcome.

Cheers,

Michael

Cheers,

Michael
