The above should not say "readline not compiled in".  It didn't with older versions of the pari spkg.  So something broke this.   

I once installed Sage on OS X for Ken Ribet specifically because gp's readline does work in OS X with Sage, and he couldn't get a very that worked without Sage no matter what he tried.  Now this is broken, which is bad. 

We should have a doctest that runs gp as a subprocess and verifies that readline is compiled in.  E.g.,

```
sage: import pexpect; p = pexpect.spawn('gp')
sage: p.expect('\?')
0
sage: assert 'readline not compiled in' not in p.before
```

Then this problem will never happen again.

Is this OSX 10.4, 10.5 or both? On 10.5 the dynamic readline is currently broken, see 1259, so those issues might be related if it happens on 10.5 only.

Cheers,

Michael
