The above should not say "readline not compiled in".  It didn't with older versions of the pari spkg.  So something broke this.   

I once installed Sage on OS X for Ken Ribet specifically because gp's readline does work in OS X with Sage, and he couldn't get a very that worked without Sage no matter what he tried.  Now this is broken, which is bad. 

We should have a doctest that runs gp as a subprocess and verifies that readline is compiled in.  E.g.,

```
sage: import pexpect; p = pexpect.spawn('gp')
sage: p.expect('\?')
0
sage: assert 'readline not compiled in' not in p.before
```

Then this problem will never happen again.

<div id="comment:1" align="right">comment:1</div>

Is this OSX 10.4, 10.5 or both? On 10.5 the dynamic readline is currently broken, see 1259, so those issues might be related if it happens on 10.5 only.

Cheers,

Michael
