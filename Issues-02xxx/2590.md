The first attached patch returns an empty graphic when plotting a line with no points.

This addresses the concern in #2038 about not having any valid points in a plot (by returning an empty plot).

The second patch modifies using a tidbit from moretti's patch in #2038---he should get credit for it.

Component: **graphics**

The plot_use_data-2.patch fixes the doctest failures.  I also realized the docs for plot_division were incorrect, so that is corrected.

Score one more for doctests---they helped find both the off-by-one error fixed in the patch and the incorrect plot_division documentation.

Apply zero-point-line.patch and plot_use_data-2.patch and don't apply plot_use_data.patch.
