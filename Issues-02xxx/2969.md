I've attached a series of patches that makes the Debian package version numbers get computed automatically from the SAGE spkg version numbers.  

The code I ran rename the existing spkgs is the following shell one-liner:

for i in `\ls *.spkg`; do mv $i `echo $i | sed 's/\.\(p.*\.spkg\)/-\1/'`; done

There are also a few patches that decrease version numbers of some Debian packages whose version numbers were too high, and another patch that fixes the guava Debianization to find the right version number.
