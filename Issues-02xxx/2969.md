I've attached a series of patches that makes the Debian package version numbers get computed automatically from the SAGE spkg version numbers.  

The code I ran rename the existing spkgs is the following shell one-liner:

for i in `\ls *.spkg`; do mv $i `echo $i | sed 's/\.\(p.*\.spkg\)/-\1/'`; done

There are also a few patches that decrease version numbers of some Debian packages whose version numbers were too high, and another patch that fixes the guava Debianization to find the right version number.

Component: **debian-package**
