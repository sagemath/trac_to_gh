Well, there already seems to be a notebook running on port 8000, so could that have something to do with that? Can you check and report back?

Do we support more than one notebook running from the same Sage instance?

I don't think so. I would love to have the possibility to run

Could you try with a fresh NOTEBOOK directory?  E.g.,

Let me tell what I did a few minutes ago.

I created a worksheet 'test' with sage-2.11, saved it and quit.

Started the notebook under sage-3.0.alpha5, selected 'test' and clicked on delete.

With the error mentioned above :(

Worksheets created with earlier versions and with alpha5 don't give this error!

I reproduced this failure on a different machine Fedora 8, 32 bits with a ws
made under sage-2.11. using Firefox-2.0.0.13.

Narrowing(?) this down: I get the same failure under sage-2.11 :(

Starting the notebook and selecting nothing(!) clicking on Archive or Delete gives the internal server error. Both on Fedora 7 and 8.

This issue seems to be introduced with sage-2.10.1.

In sage-2.9 clicking on the Archive button gives a warning.

Don't think so. My Fedora install is just English (American). I do not use
any localization.

Something strange was going on with the notebook(), but
after hg_sage.pull() and ./sage -br the notebook
starts in Firefox with still the problem I have reported in trac #2935.

But when I start firefox by hand:  https://localhost:8001/
everything seems to work!

<div id="comment:14" align="right">Comment 14</div>

Once again this is what I do now to avoid the error:

Start the notebook in sage-3.0.

Close the notebook tab in firefox.

Connect to https://localhost:8001/

Now I have a notebook running in which I can Archive en Delete worksheets.
