Hi Tom,

the spkg at

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mabshoff/SPKG/eclib-20080310.p0.spkg

fixes the problem Mike had and another thing I found:

* the name of the spkg must match the directory name, i.e. eclib-20080310.p0.spkg unpacks into eclib-20080310.p0
* you forgot to update SPKG.txt

The new spkg builds fine, but I am doing some more testing before giving it a positive review.

Cheers,

Michael
