You know, we do evaluate the function for lots of points in the 
interval, so we ought to have a pretty intelligent idea of the max 
and min of the function.  This ought to let us get a pretty good 
guess at a ymin and ymax.  If we really wanted to get fancy, we 
could do a small statistical analysis to throw out outliers too.
