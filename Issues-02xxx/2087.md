When I install an optional package via

 ./sage -i [optional package]

the last line of output is "Making script relocatable".

I frequently do the install in the background, redirecting
the output to a file
and then use "tail -f" to monitor the output (and then go off
and do something else).   When I come back, it is unclear
to me whether the install has finished.  Perhaps something
like "install finished" could be added as a last line.

Just a suggestion.

The patch I will attach shortly does print the following at the end of an install:

```
Successfully installed valgrind_3.3.0
Now cleaning up tmp files.
Making SAGE/Python scripts relocatable...
Making script relocatable
Finished installing valgrind_3.3.0.spkg
```
where valgrind_3.3.0.spkg in this case was `$PKG_NAME.spkg`

Cheers,

Michael
