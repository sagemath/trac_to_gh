That last sentence should read: "If I'm supposed to ignore

question is: has the format to sage -t changed in such a way that one
is to ignore such failures? Or, maybe I'm using sage -t incorrectly.

I've taken David's bundle and manually applied it against 2.10.2.rc0, making a few small fixes in the process (fixed a few long lines, added a citation for Jmol, etc.)  The result is in the attached patch, which (if positively reviewed) should be applied instead of the bundle.

I ran sage -t tut.tex and it succeeded, and ./build_pdf and looked at the resulting pdf file.
