I have just started reading the Sage reference manual (release 2008.02.22) and I noticed an example of substitution in section 4.1 that contradicted the description that preceded it:


---
*If there is no ambiguity of variable names, we don't have to specify them:*

...

*However if there is ambiguity, we must explicitly state what variables we're substituting for:*

```
sage: f = sin(2*pi*x/y)
sage: f(4)
sin(8*pi/y)
```

---

Either the documentation should be changed so that it accurately describes what happens in this example or the implementation should be changed so that an exception is raised in a case like this.

I have a strong preference for the latter solution. I don't find the current substitution behavior in case of ambiguity useful (is it even clearly defined?), and I can think of many examples where this behavior could easily lead to subtle bugs.

<div id="comment:1" align="right">comment:1</div>

I am new to Sage so I am not yet able to hack the implementation myself, but it should be fairly straightforward to fix this.

I have noticed that there is a number_of_arguments method, so if the substitution argument doesn't specify a variable, the code should check that self.number_of_arguments()==1 and raise an exception if not.

Currently, if you don't specify variables, then the implicit order is the one from f.variables()

```
sage: f = sin(2*pi*x/y)
sage: f.variables()
(x, y)
sage: f(2)
sin(4*pi/y)
sage: f(2,2)
0
sage: f(x,2)
sin(pi*x)

This was fixed with #5413.

Substitution is symbolic expressions now requires stating the variables explicitly.
