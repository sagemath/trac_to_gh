sage -ba; sage -testall works on intel OS X 10.4. 

The most significant change is more flexible c(p)def functions and overriding. Specifically, c(p)def functions can now:
* have optional arguments (which may grow)
* be defined in the module scope
* are always cimport-able if defined in the .pxd (i.e. "api" by default)
* declare narrower return types than the superclass
* cpdef can override cdef

There are also better conversions (<type?> does a type-checked cast, <int>x does the right thing), and numerous optimizations (especially with regard to tuple unpacking) and bugfixes. 


Component: **packages: standard**

Two things
* the name of the spkg needs to be lower case, i.e. `Cython` vs. `cython`
* A `sage -ba` works fine on sage.math, but upon startup I get:
