Get the spkg in http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/robertwb/cython/ 

sage -ba; sage -testall works on intel OS X 10.4. 

The most significant change is more flexible c(p)def functions and overriding. Specifically, c(p)def functions can now:
* have optional arguments (which may grow)
* be defined in the module scope
* are always cimport-able if defined in the .pxd (i.e. "api" by default)
* declare narrower return types than the superclass
* cpdef can override cdef

There are also better conversions (<type?> does a type-checked cast, <int>x does the right thing), and numerous optimizations (especially with regard to tuple unpacking) and bugfixes.
