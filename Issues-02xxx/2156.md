sage -ba; sage -testall works on intel OS X 10.4. 

The most significant change is more flexible c(p)def functions and overriding. Specifically, c(p)def functions can now:
* have optional arguments (which may grow)
* be defined in the module scope
* are always cimport-able if defined in the .pxd (i.e. "api" by default)
* declare narrower return types than the superclass
* cpdef can override cdef

There are also better conversions (<type?> does a type-checked cast, <int>x does the right thing), and numerous optimizations (especially with regard to tuple unpacking) and bugfixes.

Two things

* A `sage -ba` works fine on sage.math, but upon startup I get:

About the case: sure, I ended up doing that when I looked into the spkg and made sure there was no "junk" in it due to the increased size.

An interesting data point: After installing the old cython.spkg (0.9.6.11b) and doing a `sage -ba` I still go the same error. Only after deleting the installed Cython in `site-packages`, doing another install of 0.9.6.11b and then `sage -ba` did the error disappear.

Good news: the updated spkg and the additional patch make sage start after a `sage -ba`. Ergo positive review, running `-testall` to make sure everything is still working.
