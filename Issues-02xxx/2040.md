1. 2d graphics -- the show method of a 2d graphics option *must* document e.g., the axes_labels option, but doesn't, making it useless

```
sage: P = point((0,0))
sage: P.show?
```

nothing about axes labels.

2. The axes labels appear in the notebook but not from the command line.  Try
this in the notebook (good), and command line (bad):

```
sage: plot(sin,0,1).show(axes_labels=['x','Pr(x)'])
```

This is a simple patch that seems to work as it should.  I tested it on 3.0.2.rc3, both the show and save changes; saving to png and pdf.  plot.py passes all tests.   

I think it would be nice to add this to the plot command as well, but that can be another ticket if others agree.
