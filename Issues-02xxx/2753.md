The attached patch keeps track of the random number seed used on Sage startup, and lets you set a single random number seed, which gets propagated on demand into random number generators for GMP (+ MPFR), Python, NTL, Pari, gp, GAP, and libc (so far).

Also, it moves away from libc's random() in favor of the other generators mentioned above, which are portable across operating systems and architectures; this means that doctest results using random numbers are now reproducible, so I've removed many "# random" from the doctests.

Passes testall on the platforms I have access to (32-bit x86 Linux, 64-bit x86 Linux, and 32-bit x86 OSX).

**Resolution:** fixed

Applies cleanly to Sage 2.11. I am taking cwitty's word on doctests- I haven't run any of my own. IMO, this greatly improves the robustness of our doctesting infrastructure.
