REFEREE REPORT:

I tested this on a bunch of platforms and it works.

I read the code and it looks sane.

COMPLAINT: there is not a *single* line of documentation or comments anywhere
that explain why the new version works when the original didn't or what is
going on.  Shame!  But I still give this a positive review so we can start
testing again.

TO USE: Apply  pb_unittest.2.patch to hg_sage and scripts-2553.patch to hg_scripts
