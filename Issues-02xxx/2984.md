20:30 < wstein|afk> It says "These messages are informative only. When any application performs an unaligned 
                    access, the processor traps into the kernel and the kernel emulates the unaligned access. 
                    The program will work correctly however there will be a performance hit, as emulating the

This will not be needed once #2209 is done, I hope.
