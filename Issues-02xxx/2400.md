I tried doing some integrals today and the output doesn't make much  
sense to me:

sage: f = e^(-x2)
sage: f.integrate(x, 0, 0.1)
2066*sqrt(pi)/36741
sage: f.integrate(x, 0, 1/10)
sqrt(pi)*erf(1/10)/2

Hmmmm. Does this mean erf(1/10) is a rational number? That's a little  
surprising to me. In fact:

sage: RR(f.integrate(x, 0, 0.1))
0.0996676643523801
sage: RR(f.integrate(x, 0, 1/10))
0.0996676642903363

What's going on here?

The maxima matrixexp function has problems with floating point entries.  I don't think that should keep us from fixing *wrong* output (or at least, unnecessarily rounded) from maxima due to their rounding floating points to rationals.

I've attached a patch which works around the problems in the matrixexp function by specifying keepfloat: false for that one command.  I've also added a note talking about maxima automatically rounding floating point numbers to the docstring for matrixexp.
