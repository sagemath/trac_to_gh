```
I tried doing some integrals today and the output doesn't make much  
sense to me:

sage: f = e^(-x2)
sage: f.integrate(x, 0, 0.1)
2066*sqrt(pi)/36741
sage: f.integrate(x, 0, 1/10)
sqrt(pi)*erf(1/10)/2

Hmmmm. Does this mean erf(1/10) is a rational number? That's a little  
surprising to me. In fact:

sage: RR(f.integrate(x, 0, 0.1))
0.0996676643523801
sage: RR(f.integrate(x, 0, 1/10))
0.0996676642903363

What's going on here?

Following a lead from the mailing list, I added "keepfloat: true" to the init_code for the maxima interfaces.  The patch is attached.

The last post at http://www.nabble.com/matrix-exponential--td6816907.html suggests using the "diag" package instead of the "linearalgebra" package for calculating the matrix exponential.  This works with keepfloat:

```
sage: maxima.interact()

  --> Switching to Maxima <--

maxima: keepfloat: true
true
maxima: load("diag")
?\/home\/grout\/sage\/local\/share\/maxima\/5\.13\.0\/share\/contrib\/diag\.mac
maxima: mat_function(exp,matrix([3.0,1.0],[1.0,2.0]));
matrix([(sqrt(5)+1)*%e^((sqrt(5)+5)/2)/(2*sqrt(5))+(sqrt(5)-1)*%e^-((sqrt(5)-5)/2)/(2*sqrt(5)),%e^((sqrt(5)+5)/2)/sqrt(5)-%e^-((sqrt(5)-5)/2)/sqrt(5)],[%e^((sqrt(5)+5)/2)/sqrt(5)-%e^-((sqrt(5)-5)/2)/sqrt(5),2*%e^((sqrt(5)+5)/2)/(sqrt(5)*(sqrt(5)+1))+2*%e^-((sqrt(5)-5)/2)/(sqrt(5)*(sqrt(5)-1))])
```

The maxima matrixexp function has problems with floating point entries.  I don't think that should keep us from fixing *wrong* output (or at least, unnecessarily rounded) from maxima due to their rounding floating points to rationals.

I've attached a patch which works around the problems in the matrixexp function by specifying keepfloat: false for that one command.  I've also added a note talking about maxima automatically rounding floating point numbers to the docstring for matrixexp.
