```
If I call `sys.exit()` from a Sage script, the script exits but not with the correct exit code. For example, the script

```
import sys

print 'exiting!'
sys.exit(1)
```
exits with exit code 0 when run from Sage:

```
$ sage exitcode.sage 
exiting!
1
$ echo $?
0
```
(the 1 gets printed because the preparser turns it into a Sage integer, and Python prints out anything except Python integers.) But the same script works properly when run from Python:

```
$ python exitcode.sage
exiting!
$ echo $?
1
```
I don't know if this is Sage or IPython behavior, but having this work would be really useful.


Component: **user interface**
