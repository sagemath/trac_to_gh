This might be superseded by #2936, but if the functionality is not in there it can probably ported to the new codebase.

This just works.  There's no way for a user to actually use it short of explicitly typing
/passwd in the URL.  But it does work correctly and the underlying code looks good.

I wish it were somehow tested, but I don't know how to test it (yet).

So it's a preliminary and solid step to this functionality, so it should go in.  

I don't think it overlaps with #2936 which is more backend stuff, whereas this is more UI oriented.
