I was looking into the R pexpect interface and noticed that the R help system is totally broken for us. 

However, adding 

make vignettes 

to the R spkg-install fixed this. According to the R website this is for some reason necessary for 
builds based on the subversion source.

With the old package in R, ?mean returned garbage. Now it returns the documentation.

Positive review, i.e. the help system now works. But I had to do a couple things:

* add and SPKG.txt entry for the new version
* commit outstanding changes in the main hg repo

The new spkg can be found at

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mabshoff/release-cycles-2.10.4/alpha0/r-2.6.1.p15.spkg

Cheers,

Michael
