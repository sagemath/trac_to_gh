I've noticed a lot of confusion by the list of systems in the drop-down menu for Sage, especially between the optional and non-optional systems.  This patch:
* makes which systems are optional clear
* Adds an html system (which is pretty funny -- all input gets html'd). 

The html part of this patch relies on #2890.
