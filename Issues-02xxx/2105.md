Marshall Buck on [sage-support] writes:

```
sage: R.<x> = GF(2)[]
sage: f = x^5+x^2+1
sage: fx = ntl.GF2X(f)
```
gives error:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):    fx
  File "ntl_GF2X.pyx", line 141, in
sage.libs.ntl.ntl_GF2X.ntl_GF2X.__init__
AttributeError: 'sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_modn_dense_ntl.Po' object has no attribute '_Polynomial_dense_mod_n__poly'
```

`fx = ntl.GF2X(f.list())` works, as well as `fx = ntl.GF2X(f.ntl_ZZ_pX())`
