Here's a patch improving some things associated with scalar multiplication over ZZ.

Prior to patch:

```
sage: R.<x,y,z>=ZZ[]
sage: f=x+y+z
sage: timeit f*3
1000 loops, best of 3: 322 Âµs per loop
```

After patch:

```
sage: R.<x,y,z>=ZZ[]
sage: f=x+y+z
sage: timeit f*3
10000 loops, best of 3: 68 Âµs per loop
```

**Resolution:** fixed

I say apply, it looks good to me.  There are additional improvements, it seems: maybe caching one, and the TODO (typoed to TOOD) about addition and subtraction.

Every parent should have a one cache called `_one_element` where *should* means that a parent is already supposed to implement it.
