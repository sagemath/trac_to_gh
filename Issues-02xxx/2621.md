When parallel doctesting a clean, i.e. never before doctested, tree there are concurrency issues when creating the .doctest directory:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/scratch/mabshoff/release-cycle/sage-2.11.alpha1/local/bin/sage-doctest", line 427, in <module>
    test_file(argv[1])
  File "/scratch/mabshoff/release-cycle/sage-2.11.alpha1/local/bin/sage-doctest", line 321, in test_file
    os.makedirs(".doctest")
  File "/scratch/mabshoff/release-cycle/sage-2.11.alpha1/local/lib/python2.5/os.py", line 172, in makedirs
    mkdir(name, mode)
OSError: [Errno 17] File exists: '.doctest'
```
The above is just a scary message and doesn't affect the operation of the doctests. Creating all the .doctest directories before starting to run the doctests would fix the problem.
