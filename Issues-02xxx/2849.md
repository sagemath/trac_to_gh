Dustin Moody reported

```
    While working on some things, I found a bug in SAGE:

 sage:k.<a>=GF(3^5)

 sage:E=EllipticCurve(k,[-1,-1])

 sage:E.trace_of_frobenius()
 0

 This isn't correct.  It should be -27.  I also discovered you can get
around it.

 sage:E.cardinality_exhaustive()
 271

 sage:E.trace_of_frobenius()
 -27

 Somehow, doing .cardinality_exhaustive() fixes the bug.
```

Here's the patch:   A case where q=3 (mod 4) only worked for p>3 and was being used for p=3, odd degree.  Should be a trivial review.

Note that I am in the middle of implementing vastly better support for the cases j=0 and j=1728, which are not so straightforward in characterisitcs 2 and 3 but I am getting there!

Looks fine and it fixes the issue.  I've added a mini-patch that puts in a doctest demonstrating the fixed status.
