```
sage: maxima.eval('sage0: x == x;')
display2d : false; 
(%o2) false

0; 
(%o4) 0
```

It hangs there.  If doing the same thing in Maxima, we get the following results:

```
(%i1) sage0: x==x;
Incorrect syntax: = is not a prefix operator
sage0: x==
        ^

```

Passes relevant tests, catches several different types of incorrect input errors, and helped me learn a little more about pexpect.  Positive review, and thanks! 

Unfortunately, it doesn't catch when someone does something like this, but I'm not sure this is really an "error", as it's intended that Maxima can handle this sort of thing... yet it could easily come as a result of an error by the user.  Oh well.
