**Attachment:** [sage-2860.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket2860/sage-2860.patch.gz)

Attached patch fixes this.  

Nobody has a test case to reproduce the claimed problem.  So I read
the code, vastly improved its documentation, and did make a change that
logically must fix exactly the reported bug.

Like was said, we've never been able to reproduce this.  However, the "continue" added to line 59 looks like it should do the trick.
