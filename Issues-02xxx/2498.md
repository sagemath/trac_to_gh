```
PARI's polynomial irreducibility and factoring routines are being used incorrectly for certain base rings. Here is an example:

```
sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(Integers(35))
sage: f = (x^2+2*x+2)*(x^2+3*x+9)
sage: f
x^4 + 5*x^3 + 17*x^2 + 24*x + 18
sage: factor(f)
x^4 + 5*x^3 + 17*x^2 + 24*x + 18
sage: f.is_irreducible()
True
```

The PARI documentation for `polisirreducible` says: "Irreducibility is checked over the smallest base field over which pol seems to be defined", whatever that means.

We should put in some checking to make sure this crazy behaviour doesn't happen, or at the very least put in big fat warnings in the documentation.

-1 -- let's just not allow this crap.

That's the sort of ick that I don't like about PARI.

Just checking that I understand what we want to see here: suppose we are dealing with a polynomial over Z/nZ with composite n.  Then we want that both factor() and is_irreducible() throw a NotImplementedError instead of calling pari and getting an incorrect answer.

I wanted to make sure before I went and changed this.

It might be more useful now, but it's bound to become out of
date, in which case such a list would be wrong, and could turn
out to be way *less* useful than nothing.
