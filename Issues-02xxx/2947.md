While debugging #2946 on IRC, Jason found that `block_matrix()` doesn't properly handle an empty list.

The attached patch makes `block_matrix([])` return a 0x0 matrix over ZZ. If nrows and ncols are also specified, and subdivide isn't false, this 0x0 matrix will be further subdivided into nrows x ncols 0x0 matrices. This subdivision might be overkill, but it's probably the most consistent return value. Other opinions are welcome, of course.
