While debugging #2946 on IRC, Jason found that `block_matrix()` doesn't properly handle an empty list.

The attached patch makes `block_matrix([])` return a 0x0 matrix over ZZ. If nrows and ncols are also specified, and subdivide isn't false, this 0x0 matrix will be further subdivided into nrows x ncols 0x0 matrices. This subdivision might be overkill, but it's probably the most consistent return value. Other opinions are welcome, of course.

Disregard the last comment, it should have been on the #2947 ticket. My bad.
