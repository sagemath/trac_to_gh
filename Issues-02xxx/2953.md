On Itanium with gcc 4.3 we need to add climits to gmp++.h. The spkg at 

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mabshoff/release-cycles-3.0/alpha6/givaro-3.2.10.rc3.p1.spkg

fixes that.

Cheers,

Michael

The difference between this and the previous spkg is the attached patched. The fix should also go into LinBox upstream.
