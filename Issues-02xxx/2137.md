This is not implemented yet, though it will be implemented.   
There is a partial workaround that might be enough for you now.

(1) Create test.pyx and main.sage as follows:
teragon:tmp was$ more test.pyx
def f(int n):
    return n
teragon:tmp was$ more main.sage
print f(3)

(2) You can use main.sage if you do the following:
sage: load test.pyx
Compiling test.pyx...
sage: load main.sage

I think this is fixed, since the example in the description works for me:

```sh
$ sage main.sage 
Compiling test.pyx...

```

Should we close this ticket?
