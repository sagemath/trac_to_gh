Displaying nice latex pictures for all Dynkin diagrams of affine and classical types.

Also:

- Improves the description of which conventions are used for Dynkin
  diagrams and Cartan matrices (Bourbaki/Kac).

- Misc improvements to Cartan types, including a global option
  for displaying Cartan types using Kac's conventions and much
  documentation cleanup.

That being said, plot should definitely be overriden to get appropriate pictures. Volunteers?

Hi Travis,

I pushed a reviewer patch on the queue which makes the logic more concise as we had discussed this morning. Please check my changes and fold them. Due to some changes I undid in my patch, you probably want to have a look at the folded patch, and strip away trivial space changes that could be left due to uncomplete undoes.

I'll then have a final check on the updated patch.

Cheers,
                                     Nicolas

Hey Nicolas,

Thank you for the review. I had to make some minor tweaks to affine types B,C, and D. However this patch will change depending on what happens in #14248.

The new patches contains two little changes we agreed with Travis / on sage-devel:

- Some trailing whitespace in new lines
- Updating the number of currently ignored tests in doctest/sources

All long test passed.
