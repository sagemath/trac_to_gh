We have two concepts of "aspect ratio" that we'd like to expose to the user.

This patch exposes the following behavior:

```
    * Figure aspect ratio -- controls the final image size, including any text labels, etc. This will be set using the following options:
          o figsize
                + single number - use this as a base size for the width of the figure canvas
                + two numbers - an actual figure size in inches
                + None - use the default size in Matplotlib
          o fit_tight
                + if True, clip or extend the resulting figure to the plot objects (so the resulting figure will probably not have figsize dimensions
                + if False, the resulting figure has exactly figsize dimensions, but items in the plot may be clipped or there may be excessive padding around drawn objects
    * Pixel aspect ratio
          o aspect_ratio -- the ratio height/width for a unit square
                + 1 -- a unit square appears to have equal height and width.  This will be the default for Graphics objects (so if a default is not explicitly set, the default is this.)
                + 'auto' -- plot the given data limits in the given (or computed) figsize, filling the figure (default for plot and list_plot)
                + number -- ratio of height to width.
```

For reference, in Mathematica (see http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/ref/AspectRatio.html?q=AspectRatio&lang=en )

* Graphics objects use Automatic aspect ratio
* plot and listplot use 1/golden ratio
* parametric plot uses automatic
* contour plot uses aspect ratio of 1

Automatic is an aspect ratio determined by the pixels in the plot.  It does not distort the plot (i.e., circles are still circles).

#9813 takes care of two cases of these.

Interestingly, from the above list, it seems like the golden ratio is only used for a minority of functions (i.e., "plot" and "list_plot").  So maybe we ought to change the global default to aspect_ratio=1 and just set plot and list_plot to have default golden ratio aspect ratios.

| Matplotlib aspect ratio setting | Matplotlib adjustable setting | Mathematica [AspectRatio](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/search/opensearch?q=wiki%3AAspectRatio) setting | Explanation |
| 'auto' | doesn't seem to matter | Full | Make the current data limits fill the available sized box |
| 'equal' or 1 | 'box' | Automatic | Make each pixel be square (aspect ratio 1) |
| | | | |

It appears that specifying a number in matplotlib ('box' adjustable) makes the *pixels* have a certain height-to-width ratio (e.g., a circle in the picture will appear to have the given aspect ratio), but in Mathematica, a number specifies the overall ratio of the *image* height-to-width.  Thus the numbers are not directly comparable.

Plus, in matplotlib, you can have the 'datalim' be adjustable, which changes the data limits on your plot to make the pixels have a certain aspect ratio.

We have two concepts of "aspect ratio" that we'd like to expose to the user.

* Figure aspect ratio -- controls the final image size, including any text labels, etc.  This will be set using the following options:
  * fig_aspect_ratio
    * number - make an image with the specified aspect ratio (within reason) using the figaspect matplotlib function (which tries to be marginally smart, which actually may be a dumb thing to do...)
    * 'auto' (default) - use bbox_inches='tight' to create a figure that holds the drawn objects
  * figsize
    * single number - use this as a base size for fig_aspect_ratio calculations (i.e., bigger numbers = bigger figures)
    * two numbers - an actual figure size in inches
* Pixel aspect ratio
  * aspect_ratio -- the aspect ratio of a pixel in the image (or of a unit square in data coordinates, for example).  The default here will change depending on the type of plot
    * 'equal' or 1 -- square pixels.  This will be the default for most things
    * 'auto' -- plot the given data limits in the given (or computed) figsize, filling the figure
    * number -- ratio of width to height (or height to width; I can't remember).  For plot() and list_plot(), this will default to giving a golden ratio aspect ratio
  * aspect_ratio_adjust -- what should we adjust to achieve the desired aspect ratio for the items drawn?  Note that by default, the axes limits are enlarged slightly; to eliminate this, set axes_pad=0
    * 'box' (default) -- the frame axes
    * 'datalim' -- the data limits

What do people think?

-* Figure aspect ratio -- controls the final image size, including  any text labels, etc.  This will be set using the following options:
-  * fig_aspect_ratio
-    * number - make an image with the specified aspect ratio (within  reason) using the figaspect matplotlib function (which tries to be  marginally smart, which actually may be a dumb thing to do...)
-    * None (default) - use bbox_inches='tight' to create a figure that holds the drawn objects
+* Figure aspect ratio -- controls the final image size, including  any text labels, etc.  This will be set using the following options:
   * figsize
     * single number - use this as a base size for fig_aspect_ratio calculations (i.e., bigger numbers = bigger figures)
     * two numbers - an actual figure size in inches
     * None - use the default size
+  * fit_tight
+    * if True, clip or extend the resulting figure to the plot objects (so the resulting figure will probably not have figsize dimensions
+    * if False, the resulting figure has exactly figsize dimensions, but items in the plot may be clipped or there may be excessive padding around drawn objects
 * Pixel aspect ratio
-  * aspect_ratio -- the aspect ratio of a pixel in the image (or of a  unit square in data coordinates, for example).  The default here will  change depending on the type of plot
-    * 'equal' or 1 -- square pixels.  This will be the default for most things
+  * aspect_ratio -- the aspect ratio of a pixel in the image (or of a  unit square in data coordinates, for example).  The default here will  change depending on the type of plot
+    * 'equal' or 1 -- square pixels.  This will be the default for most things
     * 'auto' -- plot the given data limits in the given (or computed) figsize, filling the figure
-    * number -- ratio of width to height (or height to width; I can't  remember).  For plot() and list_plot(), this will default to giving a  golden ratio aspect ratio
-  * aspect_ratio_adjust -- what should we adjust to  achieve the desired aspect ratio for the items drawn?  Note that by  default, the axes limits are enlarged slightly; to eliminate this, set  axes_pad=0
+    * number -- ratio of height to width.
+  * aspect_ratio_adjust -- what should we adjust to  achieve the desired aspect ratio for the items drawn?  Note that by  default, the axes limits are enlarged slightly; to eliminate this, set  axes_pad=0
     * 'box' (default) -- the frame axes
     * 'datalim' -- the data limits

This ticket is still needs_work.  Remaining items include:

* Updating docs to reflect changes, including
  * Most aspect ratios now default to 1
  * new/changed options:
    *  fig_tight 
    * the new definition of aspect_ratio (= 1/old definition)
    * aspect_ratio_adjustable
* Make [GraphicsArray](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/search/opensearch?q=wiki%3AGraphicsArray) work (likely using the nice features of matplotlib in 1.0 for doing multiple subplots!)

Warning: this patch changes the definition of aspect_ratio.  Before, it was width/height, but now it is height/width.  The new meaning is consistent with matplotlib and Mathematica.

Since the patch now changes a very fundamental thing about Sage (the meaning of aspect ratio), it probably should be put off until a major release.

Apparently this statement isn't true.  The old aspect_ratio and new aspect_ratio mean the same thing.  I was basing the statement on reading the docs.  Either the current docs are backwards, or I was misreading them.

I hope to take care of novoselt's comments - 'equal' and the documentation - today.  This will depend on #7981, #8632, #10244, and #10143.

> Would it be possible to extend the functionality so that it is possible to specify either only width or only height of the final figure? I am thinking of using it in conjunction with SageTeX, where it would be natural to ask either for `width=\textwidth` or `height=0.5\texthight` and have the second dimension determined automatically based on the actual plot and aspect ratio.


I think this is a good idea, but I don't think the people who might work on this will have time for it before bitrot sets in even further.  I have opened ticket #10633 for this.

I had to change a few things based on the new save() but otherwise nearly all is the same. It also turned out that fig_tight was never used in .matplotlib(), and in fact only can be passed to matplotlib's savefig(), so I treated it basically the same as transparent in .save().

I can also remove 'equal' if you want, that's fine.

Before I go ahead and update this, though, I have a question. The two functions not documented (`pad_for_tick_labels` and `adjust_figure_to_contain_bbox`) only are used in a commented-out line

```
            # this messes up the aspect ratio!
            #figure.canvas.mpl_connect('draw_event', pad_for_tick_labels)
```
So... should they even be included at this time?

The problem with the `plot_field3d` turns out to be the following very bad behavior of plotting vectors after this patch 

```
sage: v = vector([1.,2.,3.])
sage: v.plot() # all is well
sage: plot(v) # passes in aspect_ratio to a 3d graphics, which already has such a thing, and get nasty traceback
```
The culprit was telling `plot_vector_field3d` to do `plot(v)` for each vector instead of `v.plot()` as it should have.  However, this exposes something else really dumb - namely, that `plot.py` turns vectors into tuples before it plots them

```
    from sage.structure.element import is_Vector
    if kwds.get('parametric',False) and is_Vector(funcs):
        funcs = tuple(funcs)


    if hasattr(funcs, 'plot'):
        G = funcs.plot(*args, **original_opts)
    # if we are using the generic plotting method
    else:
```
this presumably avoids the fact that

```
sage: w = vector([x^2,3,x^3])
sage: plot(w,(x,0,1))
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
NotImplementedError                   
```
but still this is a problem.  So after fixing this issue, I'm opening a ticket for making vector plotting more sensible. 

I think this change might need review (?) so I'm setting to 'needs review'.

To buildbot and reviewer: apply trac_2100-aspect-ratio-rebase.patch and trac_2100-3d-vector.patch.  Depends on #7981, #8632, #10244, and #10143.

I'm setting this to positive review - it is a great improvement and it is a shame that it took us so long ;-)

I am fine with the reviewer patch and I did take a look at a few (although definitely not all) plots in the documentation. Circles are finally circles!!!

I have also discovered the following behaviour which may be a bug:

```
sage: x,y = var('x,y') 
sage: print x, y
sage: f(x,y) = x^2 + y^2 - 2 
sage: implicit_plot(f, (-3, 3), (-3, 3),fill=True).show(aspect_ratio=1) 
sage: implicit_plot(f, (-3, 3), (-3, 3),fill=False)
```
The first line (with `fill=True`) completely fills the plot, not just the disk.

This also happens with e.g. 4.6.1.alpha3, so this is definitely not related.   It sounds a LOT like #9744.  It'd be great if you could confirm that.  I thought we'd already taken care of this... unfortunately not, it seems.

The correct fix is to remove that kwd from the plot when 

```

        if plot_type == 'arrow' or plot_type == 'point':
            dimension = len(coords)
            if dimension == 3:
                from sage.plot.plot3d.shapes2 import line3d, point3d
                
                if plot_type == 'arrow':
                    return line3d([(0,0,0), coords], arrow_head=True, **kwds)
                else:
                    return point3d(coords, **kwds)
```
that should do it.  I will try this later.

Okay, now I am not rushing out the door and can think straight.  The problem is that this was never doctesting the thing in question in the first place because of the issues raised in #10638.  

I *think* the issue is that `_extract_kwds_for_show` keeps the ``@`options` value of `aspect_ratio='auto') in play; when this gets passed to the `show()` method of `Line` (which is what `line3d` creates in this case), it refers to the one in `base.PrimitiveObject`, which unfortunately then puts this value of `aspect_ratio` in:

```
        opts = {}
        opts.update(SHOW_DEFAULTS)
        if self._extra_kwds is not None:
            opts.update(self._extra_kwds)
        opts.update(kwds)
```
and then doesn't realize it's a problem in

```
        if opts['frame_aspect_ratio'] == 'automatic':
            if opts['aspect_ratio'] != 'automatic':
                # Set the aspect_ratio of the frame to be the same as that of
                # the object we are rendering given the aspect_ratio we'll use
                # for it.
                opts['frame_aspect_ratio'] = \
                    self._determine_frame_aspect_ratio(opts['aspect_ratio'])
```
Which is where the problem happens.

Although fixing this in the vector plotting didn't seem to work immediately.

Unless we wanted to change all the 'auto' in this patch to 'automatic'.  I don't know if that is desirable either, though.  What do others think?

Patch looks good.  Confirmed that kcrisman's code looks 'good' after the patch too :)  Positive Review. Great job guys.

Note: I do get doctest failures on plot_field.py, but the failures are not caused by the patches to this ticket.

It is not easy for me to determine a priori which patches conflict with eachother, so what you propose isn't really possible.  It's not that I looked at both patches and decided which one to merge.  What happened is that I already decided to merge #11491 before I even considered the patch here.

Since the sage-devel discussion I mentioned, there is an agreement that once a patch is merged (even in a future alpha version), it should stay merged if possible.
