Sequence(ZZ) should fail immediately in the first place. In the session below, I entered the command, waited some time and pressed CTRL+C many times. The computation was not only interrupted, but my sage session also crashed. Output below:

With sage-4.6.alpha1, I cannot reproduce the crashes anymore.  Doing `Sequence(ZZ)` or `list(ZZ)` will still take forever, but I don't think this is a big problem (`ZZ` is infinite, after all).
