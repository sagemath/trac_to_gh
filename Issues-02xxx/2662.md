Create a simplify_full function that (somewhat intelligently?) applies a battery simplifications to try to get a function to be simpler.  

It would be nice to support some of the options that FullSimplify in Mma has (see http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/ref/FullSimplify.html?q=fullsimplify&lang=en ):

* user can pass in a "complexity function" which determines how simple an expression is
* user can pass in a time limit for the simplification
* user can pass in a list of things that won't be simplified
* etc.

mhansen created a simplify_full function in #2661.  So how about this ticket is the enhancement ticket for putting the Mma options that we can into full_simplify.
