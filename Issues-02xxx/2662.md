Create a simplify_full function that (somewhat intelligently?) applies a battery simplifications to try to get a function to be simpler.  

It would be nice to support some of the options that FullSimplify in Mma has (see http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/ref/FullSimplify.html?q=fullsimplify&lang=en ):

* user can pass in a "complexity function" which determines how simple an expression is
* user can pass in a time limit for the simplification
* user can pass in a list of things that won't be simplified
* etc.

mhansen created a simplify_full function in #2661.  So how about this ticket is the enhancement ticket for putting the Mma options that we can into full_simplify.

This definately *has* to be handled better in new symbolics then it is currently.

Note also there are several other open tickets about the various simplify functions, with no resolution yet on what our "real" options should be.
