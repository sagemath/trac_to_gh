ATLAS 3.8.1 has been released.  It fixes all the known bugs in 3.8.0.  There
are also several other improvements, but probably the most important is that
I have finally fixed the Level 1 timing, so that it doesn't die so much with
"unable to get timings within tolerance" when you don't have architectural
defaults.

The ChangeLog entry is below.

Cheers,
Clint
ATLAS 3.8.1 released 02/21/08, Changes from 3.8.0:
   * Fixed bug in slvtst that counted complex flops same as real
   * Fixed bug causing wrong answer for row-major gemm C=A*A' or A'A 
   * Fixed bug in configure causing Pentium-M to be IDed as CoreDuo
   * Fixed bug in tfc.c causing memory overwrite when too many samples taken
   * Improved L1 BLAS timers so they work like the rest of the package, and
     thus don't die all the time on tolerance failures
   * Improved ATLAS/tune/blas/gemm/mmsearch.c:
     - for x86, tried more registers, since smart compiler can reduce A & B
       regs to 2 (and possibly even 1)
     - Made it so search tries both load-C-at-top and load-C-at-bottom of
       M loop.  Bottom is superior for error, and ATLAS originally defaulted
       to load-C-at-top.
   * Added configure support for new K10h platform from AMD, as well as
     basic architectural defaults (no new kernels, just good search)

Power throttling checking was disabled as per irc discussion, and after testing from me, positive review.
