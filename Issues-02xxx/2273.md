Right now, thanks to #2049, we can (have Maxima) compute the exponential of a symbolic matrix:

```
sage: var('t')
sage: A = Matrix(SR, [[t, 0], [0, t]])
sage: A.exp()
[e^t   0]
[  0 e^t]
```

This is great, but it would also be nice to have this for numerical matrices.  On a related note, the following is perplexing (to me):

```
sage: A=Matrix(RDF,[[1,-2],[2,-1]])
sage: exp(A)
...
<type 'exceptions.TypeError'>: cannot coerce type '<type 'sage.matrix.matrix_real_double_dense.Matrix_real_double_dense'>' into a SymbolicExpression.
sage: exp(1.0*A)
...
<type 'exceptions.TypeError'>: cannot coerce type '<type 'sage.matrix.matrix_real_double_dense.Matrix_real_double_dense'>' into a SymbolicExpression.
sage: exp(pi/(3*sqrt(3))*A)
[ 1 -1]
[ 1  0]
```

Yes folks, the last one works (and gives the right answer, btw).  Weird.

Now that we have the Jordan canonical form (#874) we could use it to compute the matrix exponential.

#4733 implements this, though it could be done better, maybe, with the Jordan form code.
