When applying the patch for a overhauled matrix() function at 
#2651, I get doctest failures 
from sage/plot/plot3d/transform.pyx related to calling 
matrix() with a list of rows, but specifying a number of rows that 
conflicts.

You can see these failures by applying the patch and running sage -t 
-long on 
devel/sage/sage/plot/plot3d/shapes2.py (and the same failures make a 
whole bunch of other doctests fail too).

For transform.pyx, the call to matrix on line 44 appears to flatten the 
trans argument (i.e., list(trans)), but many times what is actually 
passed to Sage is a list containing a single RDF vector instead.

I discussed this solution with robertwb and cwitty.  I added a `__list__()` method to RealDoubleVectorSpaceElement to allow its elements to be converted to a list.  This makes the hand-off between Transform and matrix() work (see transform.pyx line 44).  

However, the vector was still coming into the Transform object wrapped in a one-element list.  The problem was that Graphics3d.translate() allows a variable number of arguments for convenience.  Before, if the first argument was a list or a tuple (note NOT a vector), this sequence was passed directly to self.transform().  As suggested by robertwb, replacing the code

```
        if isinstance(x[0], (tuple, list)):
            x = x[0]
```
with 

```
        if len(x)==1:
            x = x[0]
```
works since a sequence is the only acceptable one-argument input in this case.  This solution also avoids having to check types.

Note that changing the isinstance() call in the scale() method just below DOES NOT work.  I didn't take the time to figure out why; everything seems to be working now.
