```

When applying the patch for a overhauled matrix() function at 
#2651, I get doctest failures 
from sage/plot/plot3d/transform.pyx related to calling 
matrix() with a list of rows, but specifying a number of rows that 
conflicts.

You can see these failures by applying the patch and running sage -t 
-long on 
devel/sage/sage/plot/plot3d/shapes2.py (and the same failures make a 
whole bunch of other doctests fail too).

For transform.pyx, the call to matrix on line 44 appears to flatten the 
trans argument (i.e., list(trans)), but many times what is actually 
passed to Sage is a list containing a single RDF vector instead.
