This now works (but is very very slow):

```
sage: R.<x,y> = PolynomialRing(GF(2147483659),order='lex')
sage: ideal([x^3-2*y^2,3*x+y^4]).groebner_basis()
[x + 1431655773*y^4, y^12 + 54*y^2]
```

Both patches look good, there's a lot to like in the first patch.  Apply!

I personally prefer long outputs of doctests to be all one line -- I find it makes it easier to find errors -- but that's no reason to reject a good patch :)
