**Attachment:** [sage-debian-build.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket2759/sage-debian-build.patch.gz)

Patch looks good to me. One problem is that it is against some non-existing repo, i.e. one that should be in `data/extcode/dist`. I don't have one there and all the files are check into the repo in `data/extcode/`. I applied the patch via GNU patch and committed in Tim's name. The applied patch is at

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mabshoff/release-cycles-3.0/alpha0/trac_2759_sage-debian-build.patch

Cheers,

Michael
