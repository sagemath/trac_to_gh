Patch looks good to me. One problem is that it is against some non-existing repo, i.e. one that should be in `data/extcode/dist`. I don't have one there and all the files are check into the repo in `data/extcode/`. I applied the patch via GNU patch and committed in Tim's name. The applied patch is at
