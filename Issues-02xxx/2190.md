Saturation of a matrix, i.e., this command in Magma:

```
    (<Mtrx> X) -> Mtrx
    
    The basis of the saturation w.r.t. Q of the space spanned by the rows of X.
```
is really important to a huge amount of my modular forms research.
In Magma this command exists and is quite fast, because I specifically
needed it for my work and Allan spent a lot of time on making it quite
good.  In Sage, it's built on top of PARI's `matkerint` command (one
can -reduce computing saturation to computing the
kernel over ZZ of the transpose matrix).   As a result, Sage is almost
completely and totally useless at doing any saturations when the size
is at all interesting for research.  For example, a very tiny example
below is nearly a hundred times slower in Sage than in Magma!

```
sage: a = random_matrix(ZZ, 40, 42)
sage: w = a.row_space()
sage: time s =w.saturation()
CPU times: user 0.79 s, sys: 0.07 s, total: 0.86 s
Wall time: 0.89
sage: b = magma(a)
sage: magma.eval('time c := Saturation(%s);'%b.name())
'Time: 0.010'
sage: 0.89 / 0.01
89.0000000000000
```

Here are some more examples:

```
sage: a = random_matrix(ZZ, 150,150)
sage: w = a.row_space()
sage: time s = w.saturation()
CPU times: user 1.36 s, sys: 0.21 s, total: 1.57 s
Wall time: 1.64
sage: m = magma(a)
sage: magma.eval('time c := Saturation(%s);'%m.name())
'Time: 0.290'
```

and a very typical one for my research would look like this:

```
sage: a = random_matrix(ZZ, 100,300)
sage: w = a.row_space()
sage: time s = w.saturation()
CPU times: user 17653.78 s, sys: 360.28 s, total: 18014.06 s
Wall time: 18241.30
sage: 18014/3600.0    # FIVE HOURS!!
5.00388888888889
sage: a = random_matrix(ZZ, 100,300)
sage: m = magma(a)
sage: magma.eval('time c := Saturation(%s);'%m.name())
'Time: 0.810'
```

I just want to pause to emphasize that:
1. there is no open source code in the world as far as I know that
can do saturations quickly; only Magma does them right now, and
2. doing these reasonably quickly is utterly essential to my modular computational forms research.  
3. The current situation is that what should be an easy everyday calculation for me -- e.g., saturating a 100x300 -- takes FIVE HOURS in Sage, but less than one second in Magma!


Fortunately, there is a fast algorithm for saturation that depends mainly on kernels over GF(p) and HNF, and we now have very fast HNF because of #174. 

Here's some code in Magma that does p-satuation.  This combined with other tricks should lead to a saturation algorithm.  Porting this to Sage is definitely step 1.

```
function pAdicSaturation(B,p) 
    if Type(B[1]) eq SeqEnum then
        V := RSpace(Rationals(),#B[1]);
        B := [ V | v : v in B];
    end if;
    V := Universe(B);
    n := Degree(V);
    for i in [1..#B] do
        B[i] *:= LCM([ Denominator(c) : c in Eltseq(B[i]) ]);
    end for;
    ZZ := Integers();
    FF := FiniteField(p);
    B := RMatrixSpace(ZZ,#B,n)!Matrix(B);
    m := Rank(B);
    B := Submatrix(HermiteForm(B),1,1,m,n);
    N := RMatrixSpace(FF,m,n)!B;
    while Rank(N) lt m do 
        K := Kernel(N);
        vprintf pAdicSaturation : 
            "Rank(N) + Rank(K) = %o + %o = %o\n", Rank(N), Rank(K), m;
        C := RMatrixSpace(ZZ,#Basis(K),n)!
        Matrix([ (1/p)*V!&+[ ZZ!u[i]*B[i] : i in [1..m] ] : u in Basis(K) ]);
        vtime pAdicSaturation, 2 : 
            B := Submatrix(HermiteForm(VerticalJoin(B,C)),1,1,m,n);
        N := RMatrixSpace(FF,m,n)!B;
    end while;
    vprintf pAdicSaturation : "Rank(N) = %o \n", Rank(N), m;
    return [ B[i] : i in [1..m] ];
end function;
```

The patch is here: 

  http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/was/tmp/saturation.hg

This includes the hnf stuff from #174, since this code depends on it.
It also includes numerous bug fixes and documentation enhancements to
the new determinant code.  

VERY IMPORTANT: Sage-2.10.2 should not be released without this,
unless all the new HNF code is also removed, since this fixes so
many subtle issues with that code that I discovered when building
this code on top of it.

Here are some obligatory benchmarks for new saturation code.   The speed
is still slower than Magma in many cases, but vastly faster (e.g., over 3000
times faster on a reasonable problem) than Sage used to be:

```

sage: a = random_matrix(ZZ,40,42)
sage: time b = a.saturation()
CPU times: user 0.19 s, sys: 0.04 s, total: 0.23 s
Wall time: 0.23
sage: a = random_matrix(ZZ,150)
sage: time b = a.saturation()
CPU times: user 0.01 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.01 s
Wall time: 0.01
sage: a = random_matrix(ZZ,100, 300)
sage: time b = a.saturation()
CPU times: user 5.16 s, sys: 0.24 s, total: 5.40 s   # this used to take 5 hours!
Wall time: 5.40
```

Note: to speed up sage more the main thing will be to just optimized the "add_row" procedure, which should be easy.
