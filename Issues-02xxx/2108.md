Attached file includes ATLAS tuning information for Intel prescott cpu's. It was generated using the instructions in ticket:1886.

Here is the sage-devel thread:

http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/msg/b61176e3e1a2189e

Since ATLAS doesn't detect my cpu properly, the architecture name it uses is `UNKNOWNx8632SSE3`. Should I do anything to change this?

Here is the output from `/proc/cpuinfo`:

Ok, we now need to add proper ATLAS detection of Prescott CPUs to merge this.

Looking forward to a new atlas package. :)

Trac is buggy with attached tgz archives, so it is better to link them. I can get at those via directly accessing sagemath.org. The interesting tgz is now at
