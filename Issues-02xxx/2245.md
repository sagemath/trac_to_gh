The doctest coverage for devel/sage/sage/modular/abvar is as follows:

```
teragon:abvar was$ sage -coverage .
abvar.py: 62% (20 of 32)
abvar_ambient_jacobian.py: 28% (2 of 7)
abvar_modsym_factor.py: 60% (3 of 5)
abvar_newform.py: 0% (0 of 1)
constructor.py: 100% (3 of 3)
cuspidal_subgroup.py: 16% (1 of 6)
finite_subgroup.py: 12% (4 of 33)
hecke_operator.py: 66% (4 of 6)
homology.py: 57% (16 of 28)
homspace.py: 0% (0 of 2)
lseries.py: 0% (0 of 6)
morphism.py: 0% (0 of 2)
torsion_point.py: 0% (0 of 2)
torsion_subgroup.py: 37% (3 of 8)

Overall weighted coverage score:  39.4%
Total number of functions:  141
```

The goal of this ticket is to change that to 100%.

This is in preparation for substantial work to move
the modular abelian varieties package forward in preparation
for lots of enhancements to it that are coming up.
