Looking a bit at this patch, does NetworkX do much for graph drawing that we couldn't be doing ourselves with matplotlib. Right now, for instance, it doesn't play well with the 2d->3d command because you can't (easily) get at the primitives that make up a graph. 

That being said, I think arrows are much nicer than sleeves.

Robert, the patch currently doesn't apply cleanly any more due to

```
changeset:   8329:657c0727bbd2
user:        Robert L. Miller <rlm@rlmiller.org>
date:        Thu Feb 07 00:18:51 2008 -0800
summary:     plot loops.
```
The issue is with the second hunk in `sage/graphs/graph.py`, so could you rebase the patch with your plot loop patch applied?

Cheers,

Michael

Rebased- in doing so, I uncovered two bugs:
1 Graphics import depended magically on it happening on another level
2 Arrow plotting would have crashed on plotting loops

Should now be ready to include.
