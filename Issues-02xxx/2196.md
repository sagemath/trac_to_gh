```
The code for quadratic, quartic and sextic twists of elliptic curves does not check that the twisting parameter is nonzero, and hence fail when a singular curve tries to be constructed.  Instead we output a helpful message.

Note that in characteristic 2, the quadratic twist by 0 is allowed (but gives back the same curve), just as twisting by 1 in odd characteristic.

The patch provided also enhances the Hasse_bounds function (which should probably be put somewhere other than ell_generic.py).

This should be applied.  What I meant by 'not line up' was that they are incongruous:

```
if self.j_invariant() !=K(0): raise ValueError, "Sextic twist not defined when j!=1728"
```
The test is for $K(0)$ but the message reads $j != 1728$.  What is the correct fix?
