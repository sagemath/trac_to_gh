I would like a command so that I can get a list of objects that a particular function acts on

```
sage: Objects(.factor) 

[PolynomialRing, MultivariatePolynomialRing, IntegerRing, etc.]
```

but it wouldn't return FractionFieldofPolynomialRing  (for example)

This might be accomplished by pruning class_graph(sage) for the highest level that includes such a command 

Component: **user interface**
