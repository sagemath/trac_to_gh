But it causes a new doctest failure:

```
mabshoff@sage:/scratch/mabshoff/release-cycle/sage-2.11.alpha0$ ./sage -t -long devel/sage/sage/plot/plot.py
sage -t -long devel/sage-main/sage/plot/plot.py             File "plot.py", line 3513:
    sage: plot(x^(1/3), (x,-1,1))
Expected nothing
Got:
    WARNING: When plotting, failed to evaluate function at 99 points.
    Last error message: 'negative number cannot be raised to a fractional power'
    <BLANKLINE>
**********************************************************************
1 items had failures:
   2 of  28 in __main__.example_111
***Test Failed*** 2 failures.
For whitespace errors, see the file .doctest_plot.py

exit code: 256

The following tests failed:

so I am reopening it.
