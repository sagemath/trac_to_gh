```
sage: var('x')
x
sage: x.conjugate()
x
```

Under the assumption that x might be complex, this should really return conjugate(x).


Component: **calculus**

<div id="comment:2" align="right">comment:2</div>

This could be handled using Maxima's declare facility:

```
sage: sage.calculus.calculus.maxima.eval('declare(x, complex)')
'done'
sage: x.conjugate()
conjugate(x)
```

This also fixed by Pynac:

```
sage: x = var('x', ns=1)
sage: x
x
sage: x.conjugate()
conjugate(x)
```

This is fixed in 4.0.rc0. There is a doctest in line 3871 of sage/symbolic/expression.pyx.

This bug should be closed as fixed.
