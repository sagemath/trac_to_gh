```
sage: var('x')
x
sage: x.conjugate()
x
```

This could be handled using Maxima's declare facility:

```
sage: sage.calculus.calculus.maxima.eval('declare(x, complex)')
'done'
sage: x.conjugate()
conjugate(x)
```

This also fixed by Pynac:

```
sage: x = var('x', ns=1)
sage: x
x
sage: x.conjugate()
conjugate(x)
```
