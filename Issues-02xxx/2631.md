There should be a visual distinction between input cells which have been evaluated and those that have not, and also to indicate when a previously evaluated cell has been edited and thus the (apparent) output is not actually the output of the input cell (cf Mathematica's behavior on this). A simple way to do this would be to change the color of evaluated input cells to blue, or to change the color of the boarder of input box.  One reason to do this is that it is difficult to tell if you have evaluated a cell whose contents don't return anything (e.g. "a = 1+2").

There already is such a distinction!  Unevaluated cells have
a red line to the left of them.  Maybe this isn't clear enough?
Or maybe it is once one knows about it.

This is a good idea.  Note that having a cell such that "previously evaluated cell 
has been edited and thus the (apparent) output is  not actually the output of the input cell" was only first added to Sage (by Boothby) I think in 2.10.4 (I just
noticed it has a massive bug in it too).  What does Mathematica do?

Now that you mention them, I do see these red lines when I load up an old worksheet.   But they don't appear when new input cells are created, which is a bug, I think.   I was working with fresh worksheets since I've only just started using the notebook, so I didn't see the red lines.

> What does Mathematica do?

On evaluation, Mathematica labels the input and output cells by "In[n] :=" and "Out[n] :=" so you can refer to the output later.  When you start editing a previously evaluated input cell, the "In" and "Out" disappear.   For Sage, you could just have the red line/box reappear if the user starts editing a cell (but not if they simply select it, move the cursor around, but don't actually edit).
