There already is such a distinction!  Unevaluated cells have
a red line to the left of them.  Maybe this isn't clear enough?
Or maybe it is once one knows about it.

This is a good idea.  Note that having a cell such that "previously evaluated cell 
has been edited and thus the (apparent) output is  not actually the output of the input cell" was only first added to Sage (by Boothby) I think in 2.10.4 (I just
noticed it has a massive bug in it too).  What does Mathematica do?

On evaluation, Mathematica labels the input and output cells by "In[n] :=" and "Out[n] :=" so you can refer to the output later.  When you start editing a previously evaluated input cell, the "In" and "Out" disappear.   For Sage, you could just have the red line/box reappear if the user starts editing a cell (but not if they simply select it, move the cursor around, but don't actually edit).
