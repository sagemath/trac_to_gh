**********************************************************************
File "real_rqdf.pyx", line 32:
    sage: RQDF(a)
Expected:
    0.868588963806503655302257837833210164588794011607333132228907565
Got:
    0.868588963806503655302257837833210164588794011607333132228907566
********************************************************************** 
```
The above failure corresponds to:

```
Mixing of symbolic an quad double elements:
    sage: a = RQDF(2) / log(10); a
    2.00000000000000/log(10)
    sage: parent(a)
    Symbolic Ring
    sage: RQDF(a)
    0.868588963806503655302257837833210164588794011607333132228907565
```
The issue seems to be a numerical inconsistency with the RQDF, which doesn't guarantee the same precision for all digits like MPFR does.

Cheers,

Michael
