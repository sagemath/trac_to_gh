New patch added to address comments by referee. I think you have to apply the first patch and then the second patch to 2.10.3.

Added one more patch to address problems noticed by the referee. When running sage -testall,
I noticed another problem. One of the functions requires an internet connection (it goes to codetables.de and fetches data). At this moment, that site is down, so the test failed.
I added the comment "## requires internet, long time" since timing out raises a socket.error.
This is the content of the last patch.
8866+8867+8868+8869 get applied to 2.10.3. Please let me know if it is 
preferable to make a patch for 2.10.4.alpha0 instead.

Oops,

This is probably just not checking for trivial generators or something. I don't think these patches introduced this, but it's very closely related...

Thank you very much for finding this! I can fix this easily. 

There still is the problem of the example

```
sage: C = QuasiQuadraticResidueCode(11)
sage: C.automorphism_group_binary_code()


------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGFPE: An unhandled floating point exception occured in SAGE.
This probably occured because a *compiled* component
of SAGE has a bug in it (typically accessing invalid memory)
or is not properly wrapped with _sig_on, _sig_off.
You might want to run SAGE under gdb with 'sage -gdb' to debug this.
SAGE will now terminate (sorry).
------------------------------------------------------------
```
I am forced to "kill -9" the entire process in this example.
The group is not trivial:

```
sage: C = QuasiQuadraticResidueCode(11)
sage: C
Linear code of length 22, dimension 11 over Finite Field of size 2
sage: C.is_self_dual()
True
sage: C.permutation_automorphism_group()
Permutation Group with generators [(6,9)(8,17)(10,19)(11,16)(12,20)(13,22)(14,15), (5,8)(7,16)(9,18)(10,15)(12,21)(13,14)(19,22), (4,6)(7,14)(9,18)(10,12)(11,20)(13,16)(15,21)(19,22), (4,7)(6,14)(9,15)(10,19)(11,16)(12,22)(13,20)(18,21), (3,4)(5,7)(8,16)(10,19)(11,17)(13,14)(15,22), (2,3)(7,21)(10,13)(11,20)(12,16)(14,15)(19,22), (1,2)(6,12)(8,17)(9,20)(11,16)(13,15)(14,22)(18,21)]

I have tried to create a patch incorporating 8866+8867+8868+8869, but based on 2.10.4.alpha0, as requested by the referee. Passes sage -testalll, except for a dsage failure,
devel/sage-coding1/sage/dsage/tests/testdoc.py, which I think is unrelated to this patch.

Regarding the problem with permutation_automorphism_group, the plan of course is to drop that function and use Robert Miller's code instead. So 
(a) I'm not sure what the problem is since I can't figure out from the traceback above what paramaters were useb ("just call this on random binary codes, it comes up pretty quickly" isn't very
specific). 
(b) Since it will be deprecated ASAP, maybe this can be left until the next patch?

I do not support removing the `permutation_automorphism_group` function.

I see two reasons not to deprecate the other version. For one, it
seems to work on non-binary codes, and further my version only runs on
very small codes. Second, I am still debugging my version, and it is
good to have another version to run examples on, to check for a
difference in output. It was while I was looking for such examples
that the weird traceback I got occurred.

It isn't generally the philosophy of Sage to delete a function because it has bugs. ;)

Why doesn't this style of coding bother you!?\n```\nI need further explanation. I wrote that file with the following goals in mind:\n(i) the file should be human readable,\n(ii)the entries should contain enough information to determine the sd codes uniquely\n(iii) the entries should contain all the \"expensive\" computations (eg, spectrum, aut gp order)\n(iv) a new entry should be easy to add by *someone else*.\nSo, that is the (subjective) basis for the data structures. If I understand your comment correctly, you are implying that\n\n```\nsage: C = self_dual_codes_binary(10)\n```\ncomputes information for (as an example) the sd codes of length n=8 and throws that out before returning the output. I simply do not understand how that is correct. The program is simply a case-by-case program which, in this example, reads off n as 10 and then proceeds to construct the dictionary of inequivalent self-dual binary codes of length 10 (and only 10). At least, unless I'm misunderstanding how Python works, that is what I think it does.\n\nHope this works this time!",

The attached patch I think does what you want.

(a) It passes sage -testall on sage-2.10.4+your two patches above,
(b) all "## blah" and "#blah" were replaced by "# blah",
(c) it contains the fixed version of perm_aut_gp - for example

```
sage: for i in range(100):
....:     C = RandomLinearCode( 20, 10, GF(2) )
....:     print i, ", G= ", C.permutation_automorphism_group()
....:
0 , G=  Permutation Group with generators [()]
1 , G=  Permutation Group with generators [()]
2 , G=  Permutation Group with generators [()]
3 , G=  Permutation Group with generators [(12,15), (2,12)]
...
```
runs without crashing,
(d) regarding your comment:

```
In sd_codes.py, you have a function to return the codes of a certain length, yet when the function is called, the data for *all* lengths is prepared, before the data of the specified length is returned (and the rest thrown away). Why doesn't this style of coding bother you!?
```
I need further explanation. I wrote that file with the following goals in mind:
(i) the file should be human readable,
(ii)the entries should contain enough information to determine the sd codes uniquely
(iii) the entries should contain all the "expensive" computations (eg, spectrum, aut gp order)
(iv) a new entry should be easy to add by *someone else*.
So, that is the (subjective) basis for the data structures. If I understand your comment correctly, you are implying that

```
sage: C = self_dual_codes_binary(10)
```
computes information for (as an example) the sd codes of length n=8 and throws that out before returning the output. I simply do not understand how that is correct. The program is simply a case-by-case program which, in this example, reads off n as 10 and then proceeds to construct the dictionary of inequivalent self-dual binary codes of length 10 (and only 10). At least, unless I'm misunderstanding how Python works, that is what I think it does.

Hope this works this time!

David,

Apologies, I haven't slept much this week :-). I misread the code- I thought one big dict was getting built. I guess the real thing is that the code is very hard to read. There are several databases included with Sage, and they are not source-code databases. That is a very strange choice to me.

Some of your doctests have `<BLANKLINE>`'s after the commands. Things look better, and you'll be more consistent with the rest of the source code in Sage, if you simply remove these lines. The doctests should still pass the same. It's a little jarring for someone reading the docs.

Why are the minimum distance bound functions commented out?

The rest of the code looks pretty good. As I've indicated, I give this patch a positive review, modulo the few issues mentioned, but you're going to need to get a second opinion from someone else.

Hi David,

I did mention some of my concern with this patch to rlm in IRC (the "##" issue, the missing raw docstrings and the less than elegant form of sage/coding/sd_codes.py) and since those have been taken care of I am satisfied. I did look around some more in the docstring and while a bunch of TeX markers are missing and there probably will be TeX problems once we build the documentation I am still giving this a positive review. I also assume that the doctests are correct, I didn't check with Guava to verify any of them.

What is needed in the future:

* somebody ought to take a general design of the this subsystem. Not that I am aware of any deficiancies
* we need somebody else how intensively uses the subsystem to shake out bugs
* please submit incremental, small patches instead of monster patches in the future. It makes review and integration much easier

As you wrote above "The function permutation_automorphism_group is still rather ugly, but at least this puts some lipstick on the pig and it doesn't barf on you half the time" I see this as a chance to get the code in shape :)

Cheers,

Michael
