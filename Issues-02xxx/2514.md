I have a number of changes to the modules in coding. With permission of Robert Miller, it is rather large ("code bomb"). However, most are guava wrappers, rewritten as pure Python/SAGE functions.

I added the comment "## requires internet, long time" since timing out raises a socket.error.

<a id='comment:7'></a>Thank you very much for finding this! I can fix this easily. 

There still is the problem of the example

```
sage: C = QuasiQuadraticResidueCode(11)
sage: C.automorphism_group_binary_code()


------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGFPE: An unhandled floating point exception occured in SAGE.
This probably occured because a *compiled* component
of SAGE has a bug in it (typically accessing invalid memory)
or is not properly wrapped with _sig_on, _sig_off.
You might want to run SAGE under gdb with 'sage -gdb' to debug this.
SAGE will now terminate (sorry).
------------------------------------------------------------
```
I am forced to "kill -9" the entire process in this example.
The group is not trivial:

```
sage: C = QuasiQuadraticResidueCode(11)
sage: C
Linear code of length 22, dimension 11 over Finite Field of size 2
sage: C.is_self_dual()
True
sage: C.permutation_automorphism_group()

Regarding the problem with permutation_automorphism_group, the plan of course is to drop that function and use Robert Miller's code instead. So 
(a) I'm not sure what the problem is since I can't figure out from the traceback above what paramaters were useb ("just call this on random binary codes, it comes up pretty quickly" isn't very

<a id='comment:12'></a>I do not support removing the `permutation_automorphism_group` function.

I see two reasons not to deprecate the other version. For one, it
seems to work on non-binary codes, and further my version only runs on
very small codes. Second, I am still debugging my version, and it is
good to have another version to run examples on, to check for a
difference in output. It was while I was looking for such examples
that the weird traceback I got occurred.

It isn't generally the philosophy of Sage to delete a function because it has bugs. ;)

<a id='comment:27'></a>The attached patch I think does what you want.

(a) It passes sage -testall on sage-2.10.4+your two patches above,
(b) all "## blah" and "#blah" were replaced by "# blah",
(c) it contains the fixed version of perm_aut_gp - for example

```
sage: for i in range(100):
....:     C = RandomLinearCode( 20, 10, GF(2) )
....:     print i, ", G= ", C.permutation_automorphism_group()
....:
0 , G=  Permutation Group with generators [()]
1 , G=  Permutation Group with generators [()]
2 , G=  Permutation Group with generators [()]
3 , G=  Permutation Group with generators [(12,15), (2,12)]
...
```
runs without crashing,
(d) regarding your comment:

```
In sd_codes.py, you have a function to return the codes of a certain length, yet when the function is called, the data for *all* lengths is prepared, before the data of the specified length is returned (and the rest thrown away). Why doesn't this style of coding bother you!?
```
I need further explanation. I wrote that file with the following goals in mind:
(i) the file should be human readable,
(ii)the entries should contain enough information to determine the sd codes uniquely
(iii) the entries should contain all the "expensive" computations (eg, spectrum, aut gp order)
(iv) a new entry should be easy to add by *someone else*.
So, that is the (subjective) basis for the data structures. If I understand your comment correctly, you are implying that

```
sage: C = self_dual_codes_binary(10)
```

Apologies, I haven't slept much this week :-). I misread the code- I thought one big dict was getting built. I guess the real thing is that the code is very hard to read. There are several databases included with Sage, and they are not source-code databases. That is a very strange choice to me.

Why are the minimum distance bound functions commented out?

Sorry, I misunderstood again. When I asked you if you
objected to a "code bomb", I was assuming that you were
the only referee. Since you said no, you didn't mind, I
submitted it.

<a id='comment:31'></a>Hi David,

I did mention some of my concern with this patch to rlm in IRC (the "##" issue, the missing raw docstrings and the less than elegant form of sage/coding/sd_codes.py) and since those have been taken care of I am satisfied. I did look around some more in the docstring and while a bunch of TeX markers are missing and there probably will be TeX problems once we build the documentation I am still giving this a positive review. I also assume that the doctests are correct, I didn't check with Guava to verify any of them.

What is needed in the future:

* somebody ought to take a general design of the this subsystem. Not that I am aware of any deficiancies
* we need somebody else how intensively uses the subsystem to shake out bugs
* please submit incremental, small patches instead of monster patches in the future. It makes review and integration much easier

As you wrote above "The function permutation_automorphism_group is still rather ugly, but at least this puts some lipstick on the pig and it doesn't barf on you half the time" I see this as a chance to get the code in shape :)

Cheers,

Michael
