From the remains of #2350

Make it so that:

* plot(list) does what it currently does (i.e., superimpose the plots) 

* plot(list, array=True) does what show does in 2.10.2 (i.e., put the plots into an array).

* change the docs to show() to more clearly reflect the purpose of the function. 

Component: **graphics**
