I observe that the doc-tests do not actually run this code due to the fact that is_homogeneous is overridden (as it should be) in MPolynomial_libsingular.  Indeed, the only way I can find to actually run this code in normal use is:

```
sage: R.<x,y>=BooleanPolynomialRing(2)
sage: x.is_homogeneous()
...
<type 'exceptions.AttributeError'>: 'sage.rings.polynomial.pbori.BooleanMonomial' object has no attribute 'degree'
```
and that fails.

I am of two minds:

 *1) This method should be implemented special for the BooleanPolynomial and the generic implementation left unneeded and unwritten

 *2) Or, the above bug should be fixed.

My preference is choice 1 since it seems it is generally possible to implement this function in a much faster way when you know the data layout.

Or, is there some use of this function that I'm missing?
