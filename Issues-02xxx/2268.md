The following patch "makes the common case fast."  If there is a trivial coercion map this can improve performance by 30x or more.  Furthermore the previous has_key() was not compiling into fast code, this improves it.  It also cleans up the try statement by replacing it with the if statement that maintains backwards compatibility.  This if statement should be eventually removed, but there is a significant body of doctests that fail because code calls has_coerce_map with nonsensical arguments (sometimes self is not a Parent, for instance).  Non-trivial speedups are not as dramatic but still easily measurable in tight loops.  This code has been verified at the .c file level for reference issues and make checked.

Thanks for your contribution. Actually, the entire coercion model is being re-worked, I think you might find http://wiki.sagemath.org/days7/coercion/ interesting. In particular, this function has been rewritten. 

As far as your code goes, I think you are making things too hard on yourself trying to use the Python C API. Cython will do most of that for you to make your life easier: 

```
if PyObject_RichCompareBool(self, S, Py_EQ)==True: 
```

is faster (and easier to read) as 

```
if self == S:
```
and 

```
PyObject_TypeCheck(self._has_coerce_map_from,NoneType)==1)
```
would be faster if written

```
self._has_coerce_map_from is None
```

Also

```
try:
    return self._has_coerce_map_from[S]
except AttributeError:
    pass
```
Is faster than testing the key first, and then retrieving the object (as that requires two lookups rather than one on success). 

The point that the trivial case should be handled first is a very good one and the new coercion code will do that.

The try should not even need to be there, and is there only because code is broken.

Furthermore, to maintain compatibility with existing code, it is necessary to reset the _has_coerce_map_from attribute in the exception.

Using the Python/C API directly significantly impacts readability, and often doesn't offer any speed improvements. Using a try/except in Cython is free if no error is thrown, which will usually be the case (only once for a given ring will it fail). What you are doing with `PyObject_GetItem` is manually catching and clearing the error (rather than letting Cython do it for you), which is not a huge speed gain. The same can be said of using the `PyObject_RichCompareBool` manually. 

I've attached an alternative patch that is instantly understandable to anyone who knows Python, and should be just as fast (look at the generated C). 

As to the new coercion code, see the bundles/patches on the wiki. The new function is not a plug-in replacement for this one though. 

BTW, the has_key was there to cover up a segfault in a previous version of Pyrex error handling.
