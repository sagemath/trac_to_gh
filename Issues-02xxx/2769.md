When saving plots without axes, matplotlib produces invalid PDFs:

```
p = plot(x^2, x, 0, 1)
p.save('withaxes.pdf')
p.save('withoutaxes.pdf', axes=False)
```

the second file is not valid; if you use it in a LaTeX document, it makes the text shrink for the rest of the page -- see the attached PDF. If you try to convert withoutaxes.pdf to postscript using pdf2ps, you get:

```
drake@sansu5:~$ pdf2ps withoutaxes.pdf 
   **** Warning: File has imbalanced q/Q operators (too many q's)

   **** This file had errors that were repaired or ignored.
   **** The file was produced by: 
   **** >>>> matplotlib pdf backend <<<<
   **** Please notify the author of the software that produced this
   **** file that it does not conform to Adobe's published PDF
   **** specification.
```

This is probably a matplotlib problem, and I think it's [been noticed and fixed in the most recent version](http://www.nabble.com/Problem-with-matplotlib-and-pdflatex-td16210144.html).
