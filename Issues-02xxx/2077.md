sage: a=matrix([[1,2],[3,4]])
sage: a.column(0)
(1, 3)
sage: a.column(1)
(2, 4)
sage: a.column(3)
(2, 4)
sage: a.column(2)
(1, 3)
```

The documentation for a.column says that it behaves like list indexing when given a negative index.  We should probably also act like list indexing for positive indices that are too big and throw an error:

```
sage: l=range(3); l
[0, 1, 2]
sage: l[3]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
<type 'exceptions.IndexError'>            Traceback (most recent call last)

<type 'exceptions.IndexError'>: list index out of range
```
