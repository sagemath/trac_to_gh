This works

```
sage: 1.digits(16,'0123456789abcdef')
['1']
sage: 2.digits(16,'0123456789abcdef')
['2']
```
but this don't

```
sage: 0.digits(16,'0123456789abcdef')
[]
```

The problem exists for all bases. The '0'-value is never returned.

Component: **basic arithmetic**

I'm supposing that the poster of this bug wants:

```
sage: 0.digits(16,'0123456789abcdef')
['0']
```

I do not like that.  I think one should use str for this (witness 2.10.2's current operation):  

```
sage: 0.str(10)
'0'
sage: f=0.str(10)
sage: [c for c in f]
['0']
```

I don't think that what I suggested is a perfect analog for what may have desired, but I don't like the inconsistency that this desired "fix" introduces for digits.

This example above (base=16) is from the docstring.
You're right that you should use ".str" if you just want to get the string representation of a number in a given base.

But the digits function can do more. It can take any indexable object as source for the digits.
So i think this is really a bug which should be fixed, because this 

```
sage: 0.digits(11,'pleasefixme')
```
should return

```
['p']

I see that there is some precedent for agreeing that this is a bug:

sage: 0.ndigits()
1
```

With-out applying and running the code, I have some comments.

 1) I do not like the change in semantics when the digits are passed in.  I think that is way too arbitrary.  Essentially, you are overriding the default to padto when digits are passed in and making it default padto=1.

 2) The "zero = 0" in the snippet below will create a python int with 0 -- it should be a sage int.  Use the_integer_ring._zero_element

```
 
if digits is None: 
    zero = 0           # value for padding 
else: 
    zero = digits[0]   # value for padding 
```

 3) Could you also in this patch change ndigits so it returns 0 for 0?  I think that accurately reflects the will of sage-devel and fits in this patch nicely.

Thanks for coding this patch up!
