For some reason the jmol directory shipped with SAGE does not contain the doc/ directory, which causes it to fail to build on Debian (or anything else, I'm pretty sure).  The current spkg-install script just copies the pre-built jmol jars, but presumably it'd be better to build our own (certainly Debian will want me to do this).

The doc/ directory is not large, so I'm not sure why it is missing, so I've obtained a copy of the doc directory from the jmol-11.5.2 upstream.  

I also move the "jmol/" directory to "src/" for compliance with our new spkg format standards.

I'll post a new SPKG later tonight.

We also *VERY MUCH* want easy-to-build-from source java code
for this package. Note that there is a jmol optional src package
here:

JMol itself builds from source just fine if you install Sun Java (currently in Debian non-free) and ant.  It looks like the optional spkg has a bunch of dependencies that are shipped with the jmol spkg; so I guess that's what we're missing?  

The new spkg with Debian build support is available here:
