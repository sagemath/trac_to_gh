I wrote a Makefile for genus2reduction Debian builds, and made Debian apply it as a quilt patch (so it's available as a patch in dist/debian/patches/ of the genus2reduction spkg).  We should probably move the Makefile into the "upstream" eventually.

Component: **debian-package**

Since Sage is now upstream for genus2reduction I would suggest that we close this ticket once we have resolved #2225.
