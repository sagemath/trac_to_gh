[Tue Mar 4 2008] [05:06:54] <dmharvey>  how many finite field implementations do we have?
[Tue Mar 4 2008] [05:06:56] <dmharvey>  it's crazy.
```

I propose:
* implement `FiniteField_ntl` which covers `ntl.GF2E`, `ntl.ZZ_pE` and `ntl.lzz_pE` via a bunch of function pointers. This introduces a pointer dereference as overhead but this should be relatively cheap compared to the actual operations (small fields are implemented via Givaro anyway). 
* kill `FiniteField_ext_pari` 

This would leave us with two implementations: one for small extension fields and one for larger (in terms of the order)

<a id='comment:1'></a>Actually, malb, I retract my statement. The problem is not that we have way too many implementations of finite fields (and your proposed solution wouldn't fix that anyway, because `FiniteField_ntl` would need to split into three underlying implementations, so it's just window-dressing).

I think the real problem is just that the PARI version is slow! It's slow because:
* it's in python
* it uses crazy decimal-string formats internally for all kinds of operations
* PARI does not use asymptotically fast algorithms for arithmetic. (This is not a problem for small fields, but it's precisely when the fields become large that it's a problem, and this is precisely when we're using PARI.)

Another problem is that for prime fields, we still use the python implementation `FiniteField_prime_modn`.

So I propose the following. As malb says, kill `FiniteField_ext_pari`. Replace with the following, all in cython:
* `FiniteField_prime_modn` (already exists, but needs to be cythonised)
* `FiniteField_ntl_gf2e` (already exists).
* `FiniteField_givaro` (already exists).
* `FiniteField_ntl_zz_pE`
* `FiniteField_ntl_ZZ_pE`

Possible the first one needs to be split into two, one for "small" moduli (word-sized) and one for "large" moduli (mpz).

Hi, I wrote FiniteField_ext_pari long ago and only ever meant it is
a "reference implementation" to fix the API.  I'm very happy that you're
talking about doing a real fast implementation as you suggest above.

Maybe we should still consider this window-dressing to keep the number of classes down and make writing fast code easier. With this cosmetic change the author only needs to check for one rather than three types.

This is #417

The field is Python but the elements are not:

```
sage: k = IntegerModRing(7)
sage: type(k)
<class 'sage.rings.integer_mod_ring.IntegerModRing_generic'>
sage: type(k.random_element())
<type 'sage.rings.integer_mod.IntegerMod_int'>

sage: k = GF(7)
sage: type(k)
<class 'sage.rings.finite_field.FiniteField_prime_modn'>
sage: type(k.random_element())
<type 'sage.rings.integer_mod.IntegerMod_int'>
```

I don't understand. If `ntl.GF2E`, `ntl.ZZ_pE` and `ntl.lzz_pE` all should be covered by the same class `FiniteField_ntl`, why shouldn't the givaro implementation also be covered there? What do the NTL classes have in common that makes them different from e.g. givaro?

They have the same C++ interface, i.e. it should be easy to setup a struct of function pointers for arithmetic and other stuff. I'm not pushing for it though. Also, for Givaro the extra pointer lookup would hurt but for the NTL classes probably not.

What C++isms would Cython have to support to take advantage of the similarity between, say, ZZ_pX and xx_pX?
