Lines longer than about 74 characters in verbatim environments are longer than the text width in the pdf files.  Worse, if they're longer than about 80 characters they just fall off the page and the rest gets cut off.

The attached doc patch does the following:
1. Ignore the "slightly long, but still completely visible" lines (i.e left them the way they were).  They're not that pretty, but wrapping them only makes things nicer by a marginal amount.
2. Manually wrapped the really long lines where stuff was lost: when these lines corresponded to sage: input commands, I broke them up in a place that looked ok to me with a backslash and continued on the next line.  I added warnings to the reader not to type in the ....: that appear on subsequent lines then.  If the lines correspond to long sage output, I just broke them after 72 characters, the exact same way that sage would behave if the terminal were 72 characters wide.

Hi Alex, 

you seem to have used some kind of hard wrapping to correct the issue. And the result some times cases line breaks inside words like

```
2480 Eisenstein subspace of dimension 1 of Modular Forms space of dimension 2 f 
2481 or Congruence Subgroup Gamma0(11) of weight 2 over Rational Field 
```

Cheers,

Michael

Attachment: **[tut_verbatim.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket2041/tut_verbatim.patch.gz)**

The new patch `tut_verbatim.patch` looks good to me except

```
999	 	for computation of gcd's and Gr\"obner basis 
 	999	for computation of gcd's and Gr\"obner bases 
```

Applying with that hunk removed. Great work Alex.

Cheers,

Michael
