I'm attaching a fix. The fix also cleans up a few related functions. The problem was in the `_coset_reduction_data` functions -- specifically, one of the functions only generated data up to the square root of the level. However, in use, one needs more data -- at the very least, one needs to generate all data up to where the gcd of the term with N is at most square root of N. In that case, it seems easier to just generate all the data.

Added some doctests, though I'm not completely satisfied with my doctests: in particular, I couldn't come up with a doctest for `_reduce_cusp` that would have `t == -1`. I'd be happy if someone came up with one and added it. 

I just noticed that this patch is actually in the tree where I'd already applied AlexGhitza's patch from #2995. Given that it's already been merged anyway, I'm just not going to worry about it.

There are some typos, namely `specfically` in at least two places.

I'm worried about the lack of `t==-1` doctest as well, but this looks good to me anyway.

Two comments:

1. this patch is great; not only does it fix the current issue, but also fixes #2938.  Awesome!

2. regarding t = -1: looking at the code, I notice that t = -1 is returned only if, towards the end, u > N_over_2; but before that u goes through a bunch of reductions modulo d, so u is at most d.  On the other hand, d=gcd(v,N), so the only way this can be bigger than half of N is if it's equal to N, i.e. if v = N.  Having run a lot of random examples, I don't think t is ever -1, but it would be nice to have a theoretical proof of this (maybe William or John know this, or maybe they know how to construct an example with t=-1).

Having said this, I think we should be grateful for point (1) and merge, and figure out point (2) later.
