Thanks for caring about this issue so much.

I don't think fixing this is critical to the success of manipulate.  I do appreciate your concern.  This ticket is pretty vague...

Timothy,

as William pointed out the ticket you opened is vague and cannot really be solved. So I changed the summary to something more achievable and from your comment it is what you intend to do. Feel free to correct the "Summary" line.

Cheers,

Michael

<div id="comment:4" align="right">Comment 4</div>

This ticket is 22 months old and the notebook has changed in that time, but I think it is well worth fixing the W3C validation errors, for reasons that are not so obvious. 

When I look at the Wolfram Reserach site

http://www.wolfram.com/

and see 259 Errors, 4 warning(s)

http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wolfram.com&charset=%28detect+automatically%29&doctype=Inline&group=0&user-agent=W3C_Validator%2F1.654


it gives me the impression of not taking care of details. Wolfram Reserach could reasonably argue they would rather devote time to improving Mathematica, than fixing the web site. One can see some logic to that. But I personally still see this as not paying attention to detail. 

In contrast, the Sage web 

site has few if any issues with the W3C validator. The home page is faultless in this respect 

http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sagemath.org%2F&charset=%28detect+automatically%29&doctype=Inline&group=0

As such, even if the notebook looks fine, I believe the errors should be removed, to give the impression that attention is paid to detail. 

A google search on 'W3C validator' shows 2,230,000 hits. It is obvious people do use that tool. 

Dave
