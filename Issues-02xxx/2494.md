BUG 1:

Hi,
I was just trying to calculate some stuff with spherical Bessel
functions and got this error message:

sage: spherical_bessel_J(3,.1)


....
6823         return x
  6824     except SyntaxError:
-> 6825         raise TypeError, "unable to make sense of Maxima
expression '%s' in SAGE"%s
  6826     finally:
  6827         is_simplified = False

<type 'exceptions.TypeError'>: unable to make sense of Maxima
expression '9.5185197208655641L-6' in SAGE
sage:
KeyboardInterrupt

I checked it, it happens for small values of the argument x.
Does anyone has a solution or work around?

Greets,

schorsch
```

BUG2

```
sage: spherical_bessel_J(3,.1, algorithm='scipy')

Probably many of the special functions in functions/special.py have similar bugs.
