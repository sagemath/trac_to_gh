Here's a pure python implementation of an algorithm to factor polynomials over ZZ using kronecker's trick (specializing a variable to a large prime reduces you to a poly of fewer variables).  Note that this also fills in an implementation of factoring over ZZ[x,y] --- we don't have any implementation at all for this currently.  It's also faster than singular (over QQ) for some cases.

Here's an example with my favorite trouble-maker for singular.

this patch:

```

singular:

I am no expert on factoring algorithms, but this does seem to fill a needed hole, is reasonably implemented, and has some rudimentary doctests.

I say apply.

Isn't this whole area going to be addressed soon anyway, so that this code will likely be reviewed and enhanced shortly?

REVIEW:

This absolutely should not be applied for the simple reason that the file `sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_factor.py`
introduces 7 new functions that have 0 docstrings and 0 doctests, and essentially 0 documentation.  My understanding, which I want to push very hard, is that no new code should go into Sage that reduces the overall doctest coverage score. 

Joel -- can you add doctests and docstrings for every single function `multi_polynomial_factor.py`?    I do that with *all* new code I write for Sage.
