I think the problem is the first row of the matrix is the zero row, which is clearly wrong.

**Attachment:** [sage-2398.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket2398/sage-2398.patch.gz)

I've attached a patch that fixes the problem.  It was actually potentially fairly
serious, though something one wouldn't see much on "random" input.

The fix involves changing one line (the patch is longer, but only for cosmetic reasons and because of adding a doctest).

I ran the sanity check scripts and this code still works after the patch, by the way.  So that one tiny patch, which is clearly right, doesn't break things.
