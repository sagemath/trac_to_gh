In the fix posted above, I did two things:

* removed `selberg_zograf_bound`, because it was causing numerical issues here 
 and there, and wasn't actually used anywhere.

* changed the default choice of totally real field of discriminant 5 (which gets
 added to the list by hand), because John had done that in his patch. Unfortunately,
 I switched a `-` for a `+` when doing it, and added a non-totally-real field.

The new patch I've attached fixes the second of these.
