This sounds daunting but actually Brian Lauber already has mostly done this.  

I've attached a patch that *doesn't work* very well against sage-3.0.alpha5.  It's just for reference sake.  It has a lot of really good code in it, and does sort of work.  It probably *did* work fine against sage-10.4.   My hope is that he can update the page to work with
sage-3.0, then fix all issues, and we can get this into Sage. 

Brian Lauber describes the patch thus:

```
Okay, this version of the patch set is diffed against the current branch.  I believe there was only 1 merge conflict, and it was trivial to resolve.  Here is what you need to know about the redesign:


1. Authentication is handled by 3 separate interfaces:

  * PasswordChecker:  This checks a username/password pair on behalf of the Notebook

  * PasswordChanger:  This can change the password associated with a username.  A running Notebook instance does not need to have a PasswordChanger since some backends might not support it (for example: if the campus has a central sign-on service).

  * RegistrationManager: This is used to add and remove users from the notebook.  Once again, a Notebook does not need to define a RegistrationManager if the backend does not support adding or removing users.  Additionally, an administrator could simply choose to forgo a RegistrationManager for security reasons.


2. User information is maintained by UserInformation objects.  These break the user's information into three basic types:

  * PersonalInformation: Examples include first name, last name, e-mail, etc

  * Preferences: Information regarding the user's preferred notebook experience.  Enabling pretty print by default is once example.

  * Permissions: This actually controls how the user is allowed to interact w/ the Notebook's backend.  Currently, it only consists of an account_type field.  In the future, this should be broken into several finer-grained permissions, such as can_create_worksheets, can_create_groups, etc.

Reasons for negative review:

* Patch bomb.  This patch touches many files in the notebook directory, and many more outside the notebook directory: the bundle itself is trash.  This could be fixed by making a clean patch vs. a current version of the notebook.

* Opaque.  I'm having a hard time understanding what's going on, since the bundle is so disorganized.  Any changes to the security system *MUST* be completely transparent.

* Bad?  I don't like what I see.  But that might be because of the bundle, too.

* Not ready.  I see a lot of TODOs.  Those would need to be resolved.

* Security.  Frankly, I don't know who Brian Lauber is.  I don't know who he's affiliated with, or what his security experience is.  While he may be trustworthy, I do not trust him for now.  This is not a permanent decision against Brian; I just don't have enough info.
