The setup:

```
sage: C = QuadraticResidueCode(7, GF(2))
sage: G = C.permutation_automorphism_group()
sage: G.order()
168
```
Before:

```
sage: time SG = G.subgroup(list(G.gens()[:3]))
CPU times: user 0.86 s, sys: 0.34 s, total: 1.20 s
Wall time: 1.24
```
After:

```
sage: time SG = G.subgroup(list(G.gens()[:3]))
CPU times: user 0.00 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.00 s
Wall time: 0.00
```
