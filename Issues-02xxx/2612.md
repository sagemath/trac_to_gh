Since python does well with a leading sign (+ or -)

```
sage: int('+1')
1
sage: int('-1')
-1
```
the sage Integers should do the same.

```
sage: Integer('-1')
-1
sage: Integer('+1')
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
<type 'exceptions.TypeError'>             Traceback (most recent call last)

/home/mrk/<ipython console> in <module>()

/home/mrk/integer.pyx in sage.rings.integer.Integer.__init__()

<type 'exceptions.TypeError'>: unable to convert x (=+1) to an integer
```
So the case of a leading "+" must be fixed

Component: **basic arithmetic**
