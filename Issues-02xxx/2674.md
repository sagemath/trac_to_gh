Reported by Jay Pottharst <sharlaon@gmail.com>:

```
sage: b=CuspForms(22).basis()
sage: sum(b)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
NameError: global name 'other' is not defined
```
This covers up a possibly larger problem:

```
sage: ssum=0
sage: for u in b:
...     ssum=(ssum+u)
...
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: unsupported operand parent(s) for '+': 'Integer Ring' and
'Cuspidal subspace of dimension 2 of Modular Forms space of dimension
5 for Congruence Subgroup Gamma0(22) of weight 2 over Rational Field'
```

The first problem is easily fixed.

I disagree that the second issue is a bug:

```

Note that 

  b[0] + 0

and 

  0 + b[0]

should *not* work, since in each case that's a canonical coercion,
and there is no natural map from ZZ (the parent of 0) into CuspForms(...)
for any weight except 0.   In Sage coercions should not happen automatically
unless they are in some way natural and well defined on the whole domain
of the coercion (in this case ZZ).
```

This new patch fixes the first issue reported above, as well as making the natural coercion from a subspace of modular forms into its parent work. 

Interestingly, this makes the second issue work, too.

So I'm not sure whether or not I like that this second issue works, because I agree with William's point that it should only work if there is a coercion from ZZ to a space of ModularForms. However, it's working "for free" for us, because it ultimately uses that the following works:

```
sage: M = ZZ**5
sage: M(0)
(0, 0, 0, 0, 0)
sage: M(1)
...
<type 'exceptions.TypeError'>: can't initialize vector from nonzero non-list
```

The issue is that a free module knows how to coerce 0 in, but no other integer (even when the module is rank 1 over ZZ, which I think is a good thing). So we could easily change it to make William's expectations correct by changing free modules, where the same issue arises.
