Professor Stein:
After registering for the sage notebook, I noticed that my confirmation
email was tagged as spam. looking at the headers I saw
math.sage.washington.edu (more accurately its IP 128.208.160.191) was
blacklisted by XBL:
http://www.spamhaus.org/xbl/
Checking XBL, I found that the IP was included since it was included in
another blacklist, CBL:
http://cbl.abuseat.org/lookup.cgi?ip=128.208.160.191

CBL lists the server for non-RFC2821 compliant HELO host names. Checking
the header of the notebook registration confirmed this.

Received: from localhost.localdomain (sage.math.washington.edu
[128.208.160.191])
by mail.erkert.com with SMTP id 97F2E2CB077
for <>; Fri,  4 Apr 2008 04:37:23 -0700 (PDT)

To remove the server from the blacklists CBL&XBL, it should be a pretty
easy fix and is discussed for numerous MTAs on:
http://cbl.abuseat.org/namingproblems.html
