**********************************************************************
File "optimize.py", line 309:
~    sage: minimize_constrained(f, [[None,None],[4,10]],[5,5])
Expected:

**********************************************************************
1 items had failures:
~   1 of  11 in __main__.example_6
***Test Failed*** 1 failures.
For whitespace errors, see the file .doctest_optimize.py
