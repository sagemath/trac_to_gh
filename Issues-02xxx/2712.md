Following John Cremona's suggestion, I've added 'scalar_part()", 'pure_part()', and 'is_pure()' for quaternions.

The method 'is_scalar()' is already implemented, so in a sense, this completes the picture.  This was spurred on by a request on the support list (from Chris Godsil).

The implementation assumes characteristic not 2, which is OK since it's implicitly or explicitly assumed throughout the quaternion code.

I think the terms 'scalar' and 'pure', for a value in the base ring and having trace 0 (and being non-zero), respectively, is fairly standard.
