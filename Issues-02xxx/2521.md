```
sage: G = DirichletGroup(4)
sage: G(1).gauss_sum_numerical()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: 1 must be coercible into Cyclotomic Field of order 2 and degree 1 (and is not an element)
```

Instead the result should be 0:

```
sage: G(1).gauss_sum()
0
```

<a id='comment:1'>Comment 1:</a>
This is fixed in sage-3.0.alpha2:

```
sage: G=DirichletGroup(4)
sage: G(1).gauss_sum_numerical()
-1.22464679914735e-16
```

I think it is due to Craig Citro's fixes in the cyclotomic fields code (see #2192).
