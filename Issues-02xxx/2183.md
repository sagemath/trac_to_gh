David,

please export a single patch next time since this is a single commit only. It makes review on the command line easier and in case of rejects makes it possible to edit the patch by hand.

You should also add an indicator like "[with patch|bundle, needs review]" so that people are aware that there is a patch.

Cheers,

Michael

There is also no reason not to still try to get this into 2.10.2, so for something as simple as this it is always recommended to assign against the current milestone.

There are some typos in the opening docstring.

The tests don't always make it clear that scipy agrees with the previous implementations, which is what I was looking for.

I say apply.
