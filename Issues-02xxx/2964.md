WeylGroup gets a proper `__call__` method that produces a WeylGroup element. Previously if G is a Weyl group then G(m) produced a MatrixRing element. This part is a bugfix.

Root systems get a method to produce the highest root, relevant to the affine root system. This could be
implemented as a case-by-case method and that would be faster, but searching through the roots for
the highest weight is of acceptable speed.

Weyl Groups get a method to produce the long element of the Weyl group. Not implemented yet for E7 and E8.

Weyl group also gets a method to produce the identity element as a WeylGroup element. Strictly speaking this is
not necessary since W(1) will also produce the unit.
