It seems that the constructors `PolynomialRing` and `MPolynomialRing` are actually the same function.

sage.rings.polynomial.multi_polynomial_ring imports `PolynomialRing` as `MPolynomialRing`, and this gets imported into global scope.

Keeping to the python mantra "there is only one way to do it", the alias `MPolynomialRing` should be removed.

See ticket:2000 about this issue as well, though I don't see creating multivariate polynomial rings with only 1 variable as a valid use case to keep `MPolynomialRing`.

Yep, since this works I agree with you:

```
sage: type(PolynomialRing(QQ,'x',1))
<type 'sage.rings.polynomial.multi_polynomial_libsingular.MPolynomialRing_libsingular'>
sage: type(PolynomialRing(QQ,'x'))
<class 'sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_ring.PolynomialRing_field'>
```
