See below. 

```
sage: R.<x,y,z> = BooleanPolynomialRing(3)
sage: R.random_element()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
<type 'exceptions.TypeError'>             Traceback (most recent call last)

<type 'exceptions.TypeError'>: cannot convert <type 'dict'> to BooleanPolynomial

```

By the way, wouldn't it be better to call it `PolynomialBooleanRing` instead
of `BooleanPolynomialRing`?  I suggest this for two reasons:
1. It is PolyBoRi, after all, not BoPolyRi.
2. The other Sage polynomial ring(s) starts with "Polynomial"

Looks good to me.

The docstrings are not formatted nicely -- they should be wrapped at 78 chars.
