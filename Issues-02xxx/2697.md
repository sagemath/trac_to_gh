This is right:

```
sage: integrate(x, x,-1,1)
0
```

This error message (which is because I forgot to give the variable of integration) is
completely broken. The "raise err" line in the source code should be just "raise", i.e., delete err, which makes no sense. Or?  Anyway, this is just wrong as is.

```

Attachment: **[int_without_var.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket2697/int_without_var.patch.gz)**

These should now work:

```
sage: integrate(x, -1,1)
0
sage: integrate(sin(x),0,pi)
2
```

Sadly, because I don't know enough about Maxima to get it to accept the default variable, we still get this joke one might make in freshman calculus:

```
sage: integrate(sin,0,pi) 
pi*sin 
```

Traceback (most recent call last):

Rather than catching the error that, say, 0 is not a valid variable name, perhaps one should look at the number of variables passed to determine how to integrate. E.g. 

```
sage: integrate(sin(x))               # 0 args, implicit indefinite
cos(x)
sage: integrate(sin(x), y)            # 1 arg, explicit indefinite
sin(x)*y
sage: integrate(sin(x), pi, 2*pi)     # 2 args, implicit definite
-2
sage: integrate(sin(x), y, pi, 2*pi)  # 3 args, explicit definite
pi*sin(x)
```

Hopefully my final solution is still pretty good, though; it does all of the above, except you will have to declare y beforehand (I couldn't find a way around that), and the first integral is -cos(x) :)\n\nAs a bonus, I was finally able to figure out how to do this, which now works:\n\n```\nsage: integrate(sin,0,pi)\n2\n```\nThat alone is worth it for me.",

Turns out that this actually comes from the original code, where the second item was turned into a variable in case someone used some already-in-use identifier for the variable; the problem was that it turned things like e and pi into variables.  

> Rather than catching the error that, say, 0 is not a valid variable name, perhaps one should look at the number of variables passed to determine how to integrate. E.g.

> sin(x)*y
> sage: integrate(sin(x), pi, 2*pi)     # 2 args, implicit definite
> -2
> sage: integrate(sin(x), y, pi, 2*pi)  # 3 args, explicit definite
> pi*sin(x)
> ```

Good idea!  In the end, though, it was easier for me to just jury-rig the code as is.  When I make my own functions I try to do that sort of planning, but I don't feel confident enough (or have enough time) to completely change the way this type of code works.  Hopefully my final solution is still pretty good, though; it does all of the above, except you will have to declare y beforehand (I couldn't find a way around that), and the first integral is -cos(x) :)

As a bonus, I was finally able to figure out how to do this, which now works:

```
sage: integrate(sin,0,pi)
2
```
That alone is worth it for me.

Attachment: **[2697-integrate-without-var.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket2697/2697-integrate-without-var.patch.gz)**

I don't have a chance to review this yet (tomorrow?) but at least want to point out that the other day I noticed that the functionality did also not work for CallableSymbolicExpression (e.g. lines 5779 or so the integral() method), which seems to have an even more primitive version of the same code.  E.g., to try the original example for this ticket:

```
sage: f(x)=x
sage: f
x |--> x
sage: type(f)
<class 'sage.calculus.calculus.CallableSymbolicExpression'>
sage: integrate(f,-1,1)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)
<snip>
sage: f.integral(-1,1)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)
<snip>
```
But this does work, so I think one would really have to fix the CallableSymbolicVariable piece:

```
sage: f.integral(x,-1,1)
0
sage: integral(f,x,-1,1)
0
```
Thanks for working on this - I knew it would be impossible for me to get to it until after the semester, and that proved to be true.

I assume I should only apply trac_2697.patch and authorship as well as review credit is shared between Robert and Karl-Dieter?

Ok, this is on the CallableSymbolicExpression side so it's my fault; looks like it is adding 1+(1-x) for some reason, which I think I should be able to track down.  I am downloading 3.3.alpha0 currently, it should build overnight, and then hopefully sometime tomorrow I can fix this.

For reference (mainly to myself not to forget in morning) - fix is to replace lines 5806 to 5812

```
	        elif b is None and a is not None: 
	            # two arguments, must be endpoints 
	            a, b = x, a 
	            x = self.default_variable() 
	 
	        if not isinstance(x, SymbolicVariable): 
	            x = var(repr(x)) 
```
with

```
	        elif b is None and a is not None: 
	            # two arguments, must be endpoints 
	            a, b = x, a 
	            x = None

                if x is None:
                    x = self.default_variable()

	        elif not isinstance(x, SymbolicVariable): 
	            x = var(repr(x)) 
```
as robertwb did in the first part of this. Never occurred to me someone might actually *intentionally* pass None for the variable...

Also need to add a doctest, and perhaps a comment that Maxima interprets variable=None as intending for integration to be "d1" or something like that, while Sage usually looks for whatever variable makes sense. E.g. the surprising last line below:

```
sage: j(x)=x^2
sage: integral(j,None,0,1)
1/3
sage: j._maxima_().integrate(None,0,1)
x^2
sage: j._maxima_().integrate(None,0,2)
2*x^2
```
Does anyone know if that is a feature or a bug in Maxima?  Either seems plausible, though I would think maybe feature.

Attachment: **[trac_2697.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket2697/trac_2697.patch.gz)**

This patch (trac_2697.patch) should take care of the piecewise error and still do the new things, plus adds a little documentation for things like f(x)=x^2.  My calculus.py always times out in testing, but hopefully running that test and the piecewise.py test should lead to a final positive review.
