Well, as far as I know this patch hasn't been posted or merged. Unless it is part of the interactive patchset. That seems to be the case, i.e. notebook/js.py  states:

```

#     Tom wrote in email to me at wstein@gmail.com on March 2, 2008: "You have my permission

Tom, if you close any tickets please give a reference to the ticket that solved the issue.

Cheers,
