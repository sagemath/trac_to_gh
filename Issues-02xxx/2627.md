`Integer(abs(gamma(n+1))) - factorial(n)` should be zero for all positive integers, but on 2.10.3, I get:

```
sage: [ Integer(abs(gamma(n+1))) - factorial(n) for n in range(20, 30) ]

[0,
 0,
 0,
 1572864,

 -220528115712,
 11417398804480,
 -55923527647232]
```

I'm guessing this is due to some numerical noise. There should be some type-checking done in the gamma function.

I would also like to see, for instance, gamma(1/2) return sqrt(pi) instead of a floating point number, although I think the above issue is more pressing and easier to deal with.

The right fix would probably be to add a .gamma() method to the integers, and then also make the generic gamma use interval arithmetic.

The is one doctest failure:

```
sage -t  devel/sage-main/sage/functions/transcendental.py
**********************************************************************
File "transcendental.py", line 102:
    sage: gamma(6)
Expected:
    120.000000000000
Got:
    120
**********************************************************************
```
Trivial fix coming up.

Cheers,

Michael
