If I have a notebook server already running, and I start a new one, I get something like this:

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------
| SAGE Version 2.11, Release Date: 2008-03-30                        |
| Type notebook() for the GUI, and license() for information.        |

Please wait while the SAGE Notebook server starts...
...
The notebook files are stored in: /Users/justin/.sage//sage_notebook
Port 8000 is already in use.
Trying next port...

*                                                  *
****************************************************
There is an admin account.  If you do not remember the password,
quit the notebook and type notebook(reset=True).
Another twistd server is running, PID 19662

This could either be a previously started instance of your application or a
different application entirely. To start a new one, either run it in some other
directory, or use the --pidfile and --logfile parameters to avoid clashes.
```

It's not clear how to use the second suggestion (using the additional parameters), and I sure couldn't get it to work.

Using an alternate directory does work, but that somehow didn't come through in this error message.

This new patch should do it. It outputs the following message instead:

```
Another Sage Notebook server is running, PID 13463.

Please either stop the old server or run the new server in a different directory.

I've added a second minor patch (to be applied after `trac_2779-sagenb-error-message.patch`) that moves displaying the "Please open your browser" banner to below the check Tim added.
