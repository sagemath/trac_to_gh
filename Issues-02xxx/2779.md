If I have a notebook server already running, and I start a new one, I get something like this:

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
| SAGE Version 2.11, Release Date: 2008-03-30                        |
| Type notebook() for the GUI, and license() for information.        |
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Please wait while the SAGE Notebook server starts...
...
The notebook files are stored in: /Users/justin/.sage//sage_notebook
Port 8000 is already in use.
Trying next port...

*                                                  *
****************************************************
There is an admin account.  If you do not remember the password,
quit the notebook and type notebook(reset=True).
Another twistd server is running, PID 19662

This could either be a previously started instance of your application or a
different application entirely. To start a new one, either run it in some other
directory, or use the --pidfile and --logfile parameters to avoid clashes.
```

It's not clear how to use the second suggestion (using the additional parameters), and I sure couldn't get it to work.

Using an alternate directory does work, but that somehow didn't come through in this error message.
