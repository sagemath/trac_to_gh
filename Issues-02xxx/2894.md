```
The following code takes .004ms/call, which is about 5 times faster than the existing get_cell():

```
var cell_element_cache = [];
function get_cell2(id) {
    var v = cell_element[id];
    if(v == undefined)
        v = cell_element[id] = get_cell(id)
    return v;
}
```

It follows that we should update get_cell to the 5-times faster version, since get_cell is called  quite frequently in the notebook code.

as tested with

```
var t0;
var e;
var n = cell_id_list[cell_id_list.length-1];
var N = 100000.;
t0 = time_now();
for(i=0;i<N;i++)
   e = get_cell(n);
t1 = time_now();
alert((t1-t0)/N);
```

Hi Tom,

this patch is identical to #2887 where William posted your code except for the added comment by you. Since #2887 has been credited to you I will merge the extra comment and close this as fixed.

Thought?

Cheers,

Michael
