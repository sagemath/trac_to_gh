On the page

http://www.sagemath.org/doc/html/tut/node16.html

in the second paragraph the following sentence has problems.

"Note that the Sage kernel of a matrix $A$ is the ``left kernel'', i.e. the space of vectors 33#1 such that 34#2."

I'm not exactly sure what 33#1 and 34#2 should be, but these symbols certainly don't make sense.

The tex file says:

```
Note that the \sage kernel of a matrix $A$ is the ``left kernel'', i.e.
the space of vectors $w$ such that $wA=0$.
```
I assume that <code>\`\`left kernel''</code> confuses tex2html, so changing that to emph might fix the issue.

Cheers,

Michael

This was a latex2html issue.  It's been fixed by #3347, so this ticket should be closed.
