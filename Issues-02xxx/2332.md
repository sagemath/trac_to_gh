Problems with the evaluate link that appears in the active notebook cell have
been reported by several people on the Sage mailing lists.  Here's the latest
bug report, which has some interesting ideas about possible solutions.

I just want to point out that the evaluate link *does* work for me
and most people in Firefox.   It does not work for me in Safari.
I don't understand why it doesn't work, but all your hints in this
email will help.  Thanks!  We're tracking this issue at

I found Justin's suggested mod: extend the timeout in cell_blur, to be effective.
Maybe Williams machines are faster than my little laptop. Tried 200ms but that was
unreliable, 250ms seems to work OK.

I await Justin's proposed mods....
