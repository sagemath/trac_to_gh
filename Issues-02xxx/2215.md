<div id="comment:0"></div>

it seems like matrix(thing) should usually work if we can think of "thing" as a matrix.  In this case, we even already have a p.to_matrix() function.

I created an hg bundle which modifies this patch. It makes it such that 
perm -> matrix(perm) is consistent with the corresponding map on perm gp
elements and respects multiplication. It passes sage -t but sage -testall failed
in *many* places, though none which seemed related to this patch.

To quote from that page:

```
You can make all changes in the repository you're working in as a bundle by
typing hg_sage.bundle('mybundle') (this creates an hg bundle mybundle.hg). 
Alternatively, you can export any particular changeset as plain text 
patches by typing hg_sage.export(...); note that each individual changeset 
is recorded as a different patch. hg_sage.export(...) needs at least the 
argument revs - integer or list of integers (revision numbers); use the 
hg_sage.log() function to see them. An optional second argument is a 
'patch_filename', default is '(changeset_revision_number).patch'.
```
The command `hg_sage.bundle('mybundle')` creates a bundle against the current main repo, which is at 2.10.1. Use `hg_sage.export(...)` with the right commit numbers, which `hg_sage.log()` does tell you.

Cheers,

I tried to figure out to_matrix but failed. It seemed to me that it was
implicitly using a global variable, permutation_options or something like that.
I though global variables were Bad. Is there a reason not to use optional
parameters instead? Anyway, I think the matrix command of a permutation
should agree with the the matrix command of a permutation, when regarded as an element
of permutation group.
