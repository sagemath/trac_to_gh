Matrices with 0 eigenvalues crash jordan_form.  1x1 matrices do not seem affected, so the simplest example is:

```
j1 = matrix(ZZ,2,2,[[0,0],[0,0]])
j1.jordan_form()
```

The following code might be of some use in testing this; the function tough_nut(n) produces a highly degenerate nilpotent n by n matrix:

```
def uprand(i,j, max_i = 1):
    if i > j: return 0
    if i == j: return 1
    return Integer(randint(0,max_i))
def superd(i,j, odds = .75):
    if j - i == 1: 
        temp = random()
        if temp < odds: return 1
        else: return 0
    return 0
def tough_nut(m_size, odds = .75):
    t1 = matrix(ZZ,m_size,m_size,[[uprand(i, j, max_i = 4) for j in range(m_size)] for i in range(m_size)])
    t2 = matrix(ZZ,m_size,m_size,[[uprand(i, j, max_i = 4) for j in range(m_size)] for i in range(m_size)])
    t2 = t2.transpose()
    pre_j = matrix(ZZ,m_size,m_size,[[superd(i,j, odds = odds) for j in range(m_size)] for i in range(m_size)])
    mystery_mat = t1*t2*pre_j*t2.inverse()*t1.inverse()
    return mystery_mat
```

At first I thought this was only caused by nilpotents, but it affects many matrices with a zero eigenvalue.  Maybe it is more pervasive than that.

The current `jordan_form` computes the number of Jordan blocks of size 1 at eigenvalue x of a matrix A as `rank(A) - rank(A - x)`. This should be `dim(ker(A-x)) = size(A) - rank(A - x)`.

The attached patch fixes this.
