<div id="comment:1" align="right">Comment 1</div>

The last line should probably read

```
raise ValueError, "-(2*k)/B_k (=%s) must be invertible in the %r"%(a0inv, K) 
```

rather than

```
raise ValueError, "-(2*k)/B_k (=%s) must be invertible in the %s"%(a0inv, K._repr_()) 
```

Other than that, I approve.
