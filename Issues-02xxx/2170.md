```
The digits function should be rewritten to have a special
case in the base 10 case, since as illustrated below
it is currently **WAY** slower than just doing str(...) on 
the input number!

```
sage: a = 3^100000
sage: time w = a.digits(base=10)
CPU times: user 1.00 s, sys: 0.01 s, total: 1.01 s
Wall time: 1.01
sage: time v = list(reversed(str(a)))
CPU times: user 0.02 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.02 s
Wall time: 0.02
sage: v[:10]
['1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '2', '2', '5', '5']
sage: w[:10]
[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 5, 5]
```


Component: **basic arithmetic**

REVIEW: The patch needs to be changed to only use the mpz string trick when the base is  small enough to work with GMP.   Right now we have:

Before patch:

```
sage: a = 9939082340
sage: a.digits(512)
[100, 302, 26, 74]
```

After patch:

```
sage: a = 9939082340
sage: a.digits(10)
['0', '4', '3', '2', '8', '0', '9', '3', '9', '9']
sage: a.digits(32)
['4', '3', 'n', 'k', '6', '8', '9']
sage: a.digits(62)
['g', 'L', 'N', 'd', 'q', 'A']
sage: a.digits(63)
------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGBUS: A bus error occured in SAGE.
This probably occured because a *compiled* component
of SAGE has a bug in it (typically accessing invalid memory)
or is not properly wrapped with _sig_on, _sig_off.
You might want to run SAGE under gdb with 'sage -gdb' to debug this.
SAGE will now terminate (sorry).
------------------------------------------------------------

```
l = <object> PyString_FromString(str_out) 
```

could simply read 

```
l = str_out
```

and Cython will do the string conversion for you. This looks like it was copied from `Integer.str()` and should be changed there as well. 

It certainly needs to be fixed to handle the base > 62 case, and this patch changes the semantics of the function as well, so I don't think it should be applied as is.

Attachment: **[8312.2.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket2170/8312.2.patch.gz)**

Attached is a revised patch, fixing the issues reported by the reviewers (whom we thank):

```
sage: a = 9939082340
sage: a.digits(512)
[100, 302, 26, 74]
sage: a.digits(10)
[0, 4, 3, 2, 8, 0, 9, 3, 9, 9]
sage: a = 3^100000
sage: time w = a.digits(base=10)
CPU times: user 0.12 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.12 s
Wall time: 0.11
sage: w[:10]
[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 5, 5]
```
We also made the change suggested by Robert (in Integer.str() too).
The new digits() function is faster for 10 <= base <= 62, but not as fast as in the 1st (wrong)
patch; the bottleneck seems to be the map(make_integer, l) call.

Oh, I see, upon more reflection.  I see that my idea of "big" wasn't quite big enough.  Once, we have a really big number, this patch becomes effective.

Here's what I observe for moderate numbers:

```
# vanilla 2.10.2
sage: a = 28356982659^15
sage: %timeit w = a.digits(base=10)
10000 loops, best of 3: 67 Âµs per loop
```

```
# Patched version
sage: a = 28356982659^15
sage: %timeit w = a.digits(base=10)
10000 loops, best of 3: 136 Âµs per loop
```

I do see that my memory allocation comment is entirely incorrect though.  I'm still a bit disturbed though.  Why should we suddenly get slower at 63?  Can't we extract gmp's algorithm for larger bases?  Part of the reason for my questions is that I want to use the digits method for mpoly factoring and it has some issues with large bases.

Modulo my comments above about the variable 'l', I think this is a good patch for the moment and should be included.  I do think there is a better answer in the long-term for larger bases though.

Well, I guess I should've waited to post the first two after I thought about this a bit more.  :)

I now have some serious reservations about this patch:

1)  It actually makes small cases slower.  (See above)

2)  It doesn't handle negatives correctly (what is correct?) -- we need a doc-test to clarify intent here.

```
sage: n=-20385
sage: n.digits(100)  # this is what used to occur with negatives
[-85, -3, -2]
sage: n.digits(10)  # the last zero comes from '-' in the string?
[5, 8, 3, 0, 2, 0]
```

3)  The version that runs with a non-None digits parameter is still slow.

4)  A big base (bigger than 62) is still slow.

5)  I now have cold feet about the 'PyMem_Free'.  Shouldn't it be 'free' since presumably gmp allocated with 'malloc'?  Or, did we hack gmp?  Or, doesn't it matter?

Now, this raises some questions in my mind.  What should happen with negatives when digits are specified?
