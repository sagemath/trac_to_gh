This is very very likely caused by #2209.

20:18 < mhansen> That Weyl group issue on Itanium is weird.  The code that raises that error is from a call 
                 in GAP.
20:19 < wstein> Gap is potentially broken on itanium.
20:19 < wstein> We have to build it -O0 to get it to build at all.
20:19 < wstein> So possibly all problems originate from that.
20:20 < wstein> See #2209.
20:20 < mhansen> I'm pretty sure that's the issue since the code causing that error is very simple and works 
                 on lots of other things.
