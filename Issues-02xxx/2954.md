```
Itanium 2 on RHEL 5 and pretty much any other modern kernel is not properly detected. ATLAS also uses the -m64 flags which is not available on RHEL 5 on Itanium. The spkg at

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mabshoff/release-cycles-3.0/alpha6/atlas-3.8.1.p0.spkg

fixes both issues.

Cheers,

Michael

Build time on Itanium is quite bad, especially compared to x86-64, but I guess that it is partially the fault of gcc 4.1.1 I used.

Oh well,
