Well, against my 2.11.rc0 build I got the following doctest failure:

```
sage -t  devel/sage-main/sage/graphs/graph.py
**********************************************************************
File "graph.py", line 1695:
    sage: cube.is_circular_planar()
Expected:
    False
Got:
    (False, Graph on 9 vertices)
**********************************************************************
```
It seems easy enough to fix. Care to update the patch?

Cheers,

Michael
