The logging facilities in misc/log.py are extremely broken.

The DVI logger produces a symlink to `$SAGE_ROOT/devel/doc/commontex/macros.tex`. There's no devel/doc directory; there's no doc/commontex directory anywhere in the Sage tree, and there's no file macros.tex anywhere in the Sage tree!

The optional directory that can be specified in the constructor does not actually accept a directory name. If you try `L.('/tmp')` it will fail, because it tries to create a directory such as `/tmp-2008-blah`, which fails because I'm running Sage as a user and can't create directories in the root directory.

The HTML logger works a bit better, but when starting it, it does not find the `xdg-open` command, even though that is installed on my system.

The view() command should allow the user to specify a viewer; it's silly that the only way to tell Sage which viewer to use is with an environment variable.

It would also be nice if there was a text logger available in log.py. I know there's the IPython logging system, but it would be nice if those text-based logging capabilities were available from log.py.

The patch, btw, is against 2.10.3.

The attached patch fixes all issues mentioned in the report, and adds a text logger.

There is an off-by-one error in the IPython input/output history; I don't know if that is a genuine bug, but I had to account for it, and it was tricky.

Hi Dan, thanks for seeing this. Could you completely remove this class (log_mathml)? It's not that useful anymore.

The patch looks good and the logger works! I have 2 requests: it would be nice if the docs specified that the log directory has to be a *relative* path. Also: when you instantiate the logger, you could return a message saying where the log file is being saved
