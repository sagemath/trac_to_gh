I've attached a patch with one possible fix for the .small_roots() problem.

Evidently the current algorithm can return roots much larger than X, which breaks the doctest.  Under the assumption that more roots==good, I left that behavior (and documented it), and fixed the doctest to search for the root it wants.  Another possible fix would be to filter the roots and discard roots larger than X.

This does not answer the outstanding question, but while looking at this code (and I did not get past the docstring, this is really not something I am familiar with) I found the following:

```
sage: N=10001
sage: p,q = map(lambda (r,m): r, N.factor())
```
which is so opaque that I could not ignore it.  Pleasr replace that last line with

```
sage: p,q = N.prime_divisors()
```

The attached patch
* replaces the opaque doctest line with `N.prime_divisors()`
* enforces roots <= X

This should fix the issue (it does for me on sage.math).

REVIEW:

Looks good (though I don't understand/know this LLL algorithm).  One thing -- cwitty's patch fixed some latexing/formating issues around line 320, and your patch doesn't fix those same issue.  You should remake your patch so that it fixes those formatting issues too, though this isn't at all critical.
