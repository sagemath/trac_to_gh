With this patch, when I do something like "sage -tp fjfjfjfjfj", it doesn't tell me that I gave it a bad file:

```
drake@klee:/var/tmp/sage-4.1.2.alpha2$ ./sage -tp fjfjfj 
Global iterations: 1
File iterations: 1
Using cached timings to run longest doctests first.
Doctesting 0 files 
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
Timings have been updated.
Total time for all tests: 0.1 seconds
```
Also, when it makes an assumption about the number of threads, I'd like it to print that it's using 1 thread. (Mostly for my own reassurance.)

```

That's easy enough to change; see the new patch.  This version also sets numthreads to be no more than the number of files.

> **Release manager**: please check the files `COPYING.txt`, `install`, and `spkg-install` into the sage_scripts hg repo! Right now they're not tracked at all.

When packaging the Sage source tarball, the files `COPYING.txt`, `install`, and `spkg-install` all end up in the package `sage_scripts.x.y.z.spkg`. When building from source, those three files end up as

* `COPYING.txt` becomes SAGE_ROOT/COPYING.txt --- The directory `SAGE_ROOT` is not tracked:

 ```
 [mvngu@sage sage-4.1.2.alpha2]$ hg st
 abort: There is no Mercurial repository here (.hg not found)!
 ```
* `install` becomes SAGE_ROOT/spkg/install --- The directory `SAGE_ROOT/spkg` is not tracked:

 ```
 [mvngu@sage spkg]$ pwd
 /scratch/mvngu/release/sage-4.1.2.alpha2/spkg
 [mvngu@sage spkg]$ hg st
 abort: There is no Mercurial repository here (.hg not found)!
 ```
* `spkg-install` becomes SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/sage-spkg-install --- The directory `SAGE_ROOT/local/bin` is indeed tracked.

As it now stand, the changes to `spkg-install` can be checked in to `SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/sage-spkg-install`. Changes for the other two files would need to be manually applied to the relevant files.
