That's easy enough to change; see the new patch.  This version also sets numthreads to be no more than the number of files.

When packaging the Sage source tarball, the files `COPYING.txt`, `install`, and `spkg-install` all end up in the package `sage_scripts.x.y.z.spkg`. When building from source, those three files end up as

* `COPYING.txt` becomes SAGE_ROOT/COPYING.txt --- The directory `SAGE_ROOT` is not tracked:
 {{{
[mvngu`@`sage sage-4.1.2.alpha2]$ hg st
abort: There is no Mercurial repository here (.hg not found)!
 }}}
* `install` becomes SAGE_ROOT/spkg/install --- The directory `SAGE_ROOT/spkg` is not tracked:
 {{{
[mvngu`@`sage spkg]$ pwd
/scratch/mvngu/release/sage-4.1.2.alpha2/spkg
[mvngu`@`sage spkg]$ hg st
abort: There is no Mercurial repository here (.hg not found)!
 }}}
* `spkg-install` becomes SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/sage-spkg-install --- The directory `SAGE_ROOT/local/bin` is indeed tracked.

As it now stand, the changes to `spkg-install` can be checked in to `SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/sage-spkg-install`. Changes for the other two files would need to be manually applied to the relevant files.
