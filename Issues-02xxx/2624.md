With this patch, when I do something like "sage -tp fjfjfjfjfj", it doesn't tell me that I gave it a bad file:

```
drake@klee:/var/tmp/sage-4.1.2.alpha2$ ./sage -tp fjfjfj 
Global iterations: 1
File iterations: 1
Using cached timings to run longest doctests first.
Doctesting 0 files 
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
Timings have been updated.
Total time for all tests: 0.1 seconds
```
Also, when it makes an assumption about the number of threads, I'd like it to print that it's using 1 thread. (Mostly for my own reassurance.)

```
               else:
                    continue # prefer silence to: raise TypeError, "Unknown File %s" % F

That's easy enough to change; see the new patch.  This version also sets numthreads to be no more than the number of files.

> **Release manager**: please check the files `COPYING.txt`, `install`, and `spkg-install` into the sage_scripts hg repo! Right now they're not tracked at all.

When packaging the Sage source tarball, the files `COPYING.txt`, `install`, and `spkg-install` all end up in the package `sage_scripts.x.y.z.spkg`. When building from source, those three files end up as

* `COPYING.txt` becomes SAGE_ROOT/COPYING.txt --- The directory `SAGE_ROOT` is not tracked:

 ```
 [mvngu@sage sage-4.1.2.alpha2]$ hg st
 abort: There is no Mercurial repository here (.hg not found)!
 ```
* `install` becomes SAGE_ROOT/spkg/install --- The directory `SAGE_ROOT/spkg` is not tracked:

 ```
 [mvngu@sage spkg]$ pwd
 /scratch/mvngu/release/sage-4.1.2.alpha2/spkg
 [mvngu@sage spkg]$ hg st
 abort: There is no Mercurial repository here (.hg not found)!
 ```
* `spkg-install` becomes SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/sage-spkg-install --- The directory `SAGE_ROOT/local/bin` is indeed tracked.

As it now stand, the changes to `spkg-install` can be checked in to `SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/sage-spkg-install`. Changes for the other two files would need to be manually applied to the relevant files.

There is no 4.1.2.alpha3. Sage 4.1.2.alpha3 was William Stein's release for working on making the notebook a standalone package.
