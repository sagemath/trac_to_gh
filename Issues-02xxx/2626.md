Sage 2.10.4 contains 5 `__list__` methods, which are never called.  Apparently the authors of these methods thought that list(x) would call `x.__list__()`, but it does not; the Python source code contains no instance of the string "`__list__`".

list(x) does call `x.__iter__()`, which is how the doctests on these methods manage to work.

The methods should be removed, so as not to mislead future developers into thinking they do something.

The attached patches remove all `__list__` instances mentioned above. I don't know how I got the idea that there is a special method called `__list__` in the first place. 

PS: I refuse to write a doctest for `SchemeMorphism_coordinates` because I don't even know how to construct such a thing! This class doesn't have a single line of documentation (though it is short to be fair).

Nice patches, all the doctests pass [with known exception]. malb is correct in skipping doctests for `SchemeMorphism_coordinates` - hopefully somebody else will take care of that in a subsequent patch. Positive review.

Cheers,
