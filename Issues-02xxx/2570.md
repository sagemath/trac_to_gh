One could add functionality to `hg_sage` to make it take a list of patches or bundles, apply each and rollback (but not revert!) until either (1) no patches are left, or (2) an error occurs. This would allow one to flatten patches and bundles by using this, then commiting.

This could still be useful, but given recent developments (i.e., increasing developer use of just hg and probably eventual switch to git) we can put this on sage-wishlist.
