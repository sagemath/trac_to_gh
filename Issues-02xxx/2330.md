It's awesome to have weight 1 forms!

Overall, the code looks good.  A few issues to be addressed:

* There's a plugin failure complaining about two lines with non-ASCII characters
* The definition of `R` in the docstring of `modular_ratio_space` is off by one compared to the usage of `R` in the code.

I'm not sure what's wrong with the other patchbots, but I've seen some of these errors in other places.  It's certainly not a problem with your code.
