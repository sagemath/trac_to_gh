<a id='comment:10'></a>It's awesome to have weight 1 forms!

Overall, the code looks good.  A few issues to be addressed:

* There's a plugin failure complaining about two lines with non-ASCII characters
* The definition of `R` in the docstring of `modular_ratio_space` is off by one compared to the usage of `R` in the code.
