It's awesome to have weight 1 forms!

Overall, the code looks good.  A few issues to be addressed:

* There's a plugin failure complaining about two lines with non-ASCII characters
* The definition of `R` in the docstring of `modular_ratio_space` is off by one compared to the usage of `R` in the code.

I'm a bit puzzled that four out of the five patchbot reports for the first version of the code are reporting test failures, all of which are nothing to do with the ticket as far as I can see -- is there something wrong with the patchbot? Most of them seem to be timeout errors.
