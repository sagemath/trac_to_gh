Hi Mike!

Just a quick idea:
Couldn't one simply do

```
    def png(self, *args, **kwds):
        ...
        f = lambda x: x if not isinstance(x,basestring) else ('%s'%x if x[0]==x[-1]=='"' else '"%s"'%x)
        return RFunction(self, 'png')(*[f(x) for x in args], **dict([(x,f(y)) for x,y in kwds.items()]))
```

This would transform any string into a '"string"', unless string starts and ends with '"' already, and any other input is untouched. In particular, my suggestion would not break existing code, since `r.png(file='"myplot3.png"')` would still be valid.

I don't know in what way png is usually called: Frequently and with many arguments? Then my suggestion might involve a performance problem. Also I don't know if the application of `f` to `args` is needed as well, or if the application to `kwds` would be enough.

Regards,
   Simon
