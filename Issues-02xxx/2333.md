To apply a patch from trac, e.g., the one here:
     https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/2245
do this:

 1. Click on the patch.
 2. Go to the bottom of the screen and copy and paste the url for "Original format",
e.g., right click and say "copy".
 3. Paste the result into hg_sage.apply(...), e.g.,
sage: hg_sage.apply('https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket2245/sage-2245.patch.gz?format=raw')

--

It would also be nice if hg_sage were smart enough to automatically detect the
non-raw url (that you click on in step 1 above) and automatically get the raw file
instead.  E.g., this could be made to work

sage: hg_sage.apply('https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket2245/sage-2245.patch.gz')

This would be easy to implement -- if ever the input to apply contains
   http://[anything]attachment/ticket/2245/[anything]
and doesn't end in ?format=raw, just append it.   That would make it easy to 
completely skip the step where you have to find the raw format link.

Since this is so trivial to implement I've made it a trac ticket:
