Get any binary of sage, type "sage -br", and it is broken.
The workaround is to touch any pyx file.  This should have been fixed but hasn't, and is a `_major_` problem.  This *must* be fixed for 3.0.

This is caused by the sage directory is symlink fix from a while back. We need to invalidate the cache when files are moved.
