Get any binary of sage, type "sage -br", and it is broken.
The workaround is to touch any pyx file.  This should have been fixed but hasn't, and is a _major_ problem.  This *must* be fixed for 3.0. 

**Assignee:** mabshoff

**Resolution:** fixed

This is caused by the sage directory is symlink fix from a while back. We need to invalidate the cache when files are moved.
