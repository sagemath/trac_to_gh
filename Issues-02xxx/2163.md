At the command line:

```
sage: a=plot(x^2,(x,-1,1))
sage: a.show??
sage: a.show?
```

In either of the last two commands, the plot pops up on my Ubuntu 7.10 box (as well as the help).

This is due to the following:

```
String Form:    <bound method Graphics.show of >
```

whereas after show_default(False), we get:

```
String Form:    <bound method Graphics.show of Graphics object consisting of 1 graphics primitive>
```
