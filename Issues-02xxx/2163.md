At the command line:

```
sage: a=plot(x^2,(x,-1,1))
sage: a.show??
sage: a.show?
```

In either of the last two commands, the plot pops up on my Ubuntu 7.10 box (as well as the help).

I had already fixed some problems caused by removing the 'nodoctest' at the top before realizing there's no good way to test the function which I added.

The thing which addresses this ticket is the last hunk at the bottom of the patch.
