This is due to the following:

```
String Form:    <bound method Graphics.show of >
```

whereas after show_default(False), we get:

```
String Form:    <bound method Graphics.show of Graphics object consisting of 1 graphics primitive>
```

I had already fixed some problems caused by removing the 'nodoctest' at the top before realizing there's no good way to test the function which I added.

The thing which addresses this ticket is the last hunk at the bottom of the patch.
