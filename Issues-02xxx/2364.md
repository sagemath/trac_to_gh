It should be better documented in animate.py how to specify the interframe delay and the number of iterations.  At the very least, this should be described in the .show() docstring; better yet if it was also documented in the class docstring for Animation, which is what you see when you type:

```
sage: animate?
```


Keywords: **animate**

Component: **documentation**

Attachment: **[2364.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket2364/2364.patch.gz)**

Here's a patch, based on 3.1.3.alpha2. I started working on animate.py before I knew about this ticket, so the patch does more than is required:

1. It improves the documentation for `show` and `animate`, as requested.

2. It adds docstrings and doctests to several functions for which they were missing; the file now has over 90% coverage.  (Only `__init__` is undocumented now.)

3. Many doctests used to be optional, things like

```
sage: a = animate([sin(x + float(k)) for k in srange(0,2*pi,0.3)], 
...                xmin=0, xmax=2*pi, figsize=[2,1])
```
These don't need to be optional -- the optional part comes in calls to `a.show()`, which calls the `convert` program -- so I've removed lots of optional tags. This way more of the code is actually doctested.

4. I also deleted one method: `_set_axes`. This method was undocumented. It was short and pretty simple. It was also called every time an animation was created; indeed, that was its only appearance in the code. So I just copied its contents (only 5 lines) to where it was called in the `__init__` method.

> I didn't change the location of the file -- as far as I know it's always been this way.  Given this, it seems like the patch does not make anything worse, and for the most part improves the original file.  I think the issue about the location of the save file should be a new ticket.

Sure. The issue will pop up once somebody runs doctests as non-owner. I don't particularly care if that issue gets fixed now or not, so a new ticket would get this patch a positive review.

Cheers,

Michael

Unfortunately (?), doctests won't catch it, since these commands are all optional -- they all rely on the `convert` command being present.

Yes, but someone [can you guess? :)] has started running Sage with "-t -long -optional", so in the future we will catch this. I am all for merging this patch after someone verifies that the animate command still works as expected.

Oh dear.  I don't know how to write the doctests, then.  For example, I have a doctest which shows what happens when `convert` is missing: 

```
        If ImageMagick is not installed, you will get an error message:
            sage: a.gif()       # optional
            /usr/local/share/sage/local/bin/sage-native-execute: 8: convert: not
            found

            Error: ImageMagick does not appear to be installed. Saving an
            animation to a GIF file or displaying an animation requires
            ImageMagick, so please install it and try again.

            See www.imagemagick.org, for example.
```
This will fail if you run the optional doctests with `convert` installed.  Should I delete the doctest and just display the error message?

Also, I have doctests like this

```
            sage: a.save(show_path=True)  # optional
            Animation saved to file /home/isaac/.sage/sage0.gif.
```
in which I have inserted an invented pathname. What should I do about these?

Nope, if someone runs optional doctests and the binary required is not there it will blow up. Nothing can change that until we have a more clever "#optinal" doctest treatment.

This would need to be changed to 

 "Animation saved to file .../sage0.gif."

Attachment: **[2364-new.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket2364/2364-new.patch.gz)**

Here are two patches, fixing the optional doctests.  Now `sage -t -optional animate.py` works on my machine.

The patch **2364-doctest-delta.patch** shows the differences between the previous patch and this one: only a few doctests were changed.

The patch **2364-new.patch** incorporates all of the patches into one file (so if you apply 2364.patch, 2364-delta.patch, and 2364-doctest-delta.patch, you will get the same as if you just applied this one).

So: either the two delta patches need to be refereed (since 2364.patch has received an essentially positive review), or 2364-new.patch needs to be refereed.
