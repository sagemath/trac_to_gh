I'm confused on how to test this - can you provide an example of using jpeg?

I think I have everything installed/patched OK, I'm just not sure how to use it.  I tried hacking the plot save command, but ran into trouble with matplotlib since it doesn't have good jpeg support.

I am now having problems different from before.  The jpeg spkg seems to install OK, and when installing the gd spkg I get the following encouraging message from the configuring:

```
** Configuration summary for gd 2.0.33:

   Support for PNG library:          yes
   Support for JPEG library:         yes
   Support for Freetype 2.x library: yes
   Support for Fontconfig library:   no
   Support for Xpm library:          no
   Support for pthreads:             yes
```
...but then the build fails, and there is a message:

```
*** Warning: linker path does not have real file for library -ljpeg.
*** I have the capability to make that library automatically link in when
*** you link to this library.  But I can only do this if you have a

*** The inter-library dependencies that have been dropped here will be
*** automatically added whenever a program is linked with this library
*** or is declared to -dlopen it.
```

...which occurs before the actual error:

```
/usr/libexec/gcc/i686-apple-darwin8/4.0.1/ld: Undefined symbols:
_gdImageCreateFromJpeg
_gdImageJpeg
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status

make: *** [all] Error 2

```

It would be very nice to have this stuff working; being able to quickly import images as matrices is something matlab and mathematica users take for granted.  Unfortunately I don't think I have the skills needed to fix this.

We are already using gd-2.0.35, so what changes do you propose to make? Either way, an jpeg.spkg would have to be voted in anyway.
