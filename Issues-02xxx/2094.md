I think I have everything installed/patched OK, I'm just not sure how to use it.  I tried hacking the plot save command, but ran into trouble with matplotlib since it doesn't have good jpeg support.

It would be very nice to have this stuff working; being able to quickly import images as matrices is something matlab and mathematica users take for granted.  Unfortunately I don't think I have the skills needed to fix this.
