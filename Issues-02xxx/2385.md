This patch adds a polynomial_coefficient method which aims to replace the coefficient method for mpolynomials.

Some problems with the coefficient function are:

```
sage: R.<x,y,z>=ZZ[]
sage: f=(x^2-2)*(y-1); f
x^2*y - x^2 - 2*y + 2
sage: f.coefficient(R(1))
2
sage: f.coefficient(x^2)
y - 1
sage: f.polynomial_coefficient({x:0})
-2*y + 2
```
Note that ZZ and QQ are not consistent in this either:

```
sage: R.<x,y,z>=QQ[]
sage: f=(x^2-2)*(y-1); f
x^2*y - x^2 - 2*y + 2
sage: f.coefficient(R(1))
x^2*y - x^2 - 2*y + 2
```

Some of the problems are that there is no way to state that I want all the terms which do not have x.  The polynomial_coefficient method fixes that by taking a dictionary with degrees.

I don't think the patch I posted is the end of the story on this.  I believe that the coefficient method should be a synomyn for polynomial_coefficient or monomial_coefficient.  I'm not sure which.  I'm also not sure what the best parameters are for polynomial_coefficient.  The dictionary syntax is my preferred, but I'm aware that some people may not like dictionaries quite as much as I do.

```
sage: R.<x,y,z>=ZZ[]
sage: f=(x^2+1)*(y-1)

sage: f.polynomial_coefficient({x:2}).parent()

```

I took the word specific to imply situation 1 which seems to me the code does what you say it should do.

If you are meaning situation 2, then I didn't put the result in the ring ZZ[y,z] simply because I didn't really appreciate it in my computational context.  One reason not to create the new ring ZZ[y,z] would be speed concerns both at creation and with later arithmetic.  That is, it could be that I really do want to do arithmetic with this coefficient in the large ring and this is a moderately expensive coercion -- certainly something you would not want to do inside of a tight loop.

However, the parent of the result of polynomial_coefficient is a very legitimate point to discuss.  I think my speed concerns are valid and sufficient argument, but this is one of the reasons that I don't think this patch is the final word on this point.

<a id='comment:6'></a>I now understand -- and apologise, since I had not fully appreciated the crucial distinction between the existing function monomial_coefficient() and the new one polynomial_coefficient().

Now I understand this distinction, it is important that other Sage users and developers do too -- and that means including some more cross-referencing in the docstrings.  At the very least there should be "see also polynomial_coefficient()" to the doc for monomial_coefficient(), as well as  vice versa (which I can see in your patch, but not the former).

Also, can you give a more precise but succinct definition of your polynomial_coefficient() function, more than just examples?

Lastly, in your docstrings you descibe the parameter as a "list" while it is in fact a Python dict.  That needs changing.

Sorry to be so picky -- the basic idea is certainly a good one.

Thanks very much for the comments.  I think that documentation is the principal hurdle this patch faces so I want to get it right!  I posted a new patch to address your comments.

Well, I actually thought my description was pretty good.  It's sort of difficult to get succinct.  Feel free to post better alternatives to the first paragraph of polynomial_coefficient doc-string.
