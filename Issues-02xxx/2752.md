I speeded up the *all_paths()* function for graphs.

The improvement is mainly based on 'getting rid of the recursion' :-)


On my machine (Pentium M) it's about 5 times faster, without more memory consumption.

rlm: can you poke take a look? It would also be nice to see some figures of before and after with various graphs. Bonus points if someone  also measured memory consumption before and after.

The code looks good.  Very dense graphs on a small dumber of vertices see a major slowdown with this patch, although performance in the sparse case looks good.

Timings for larger, sparser graphs might be on their way.
