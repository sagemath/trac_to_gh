The issue here is likely that we use

```
os.kill(int(pid),0)
```
It is likely that using "kill -9 $PID" via os.system() ought to fix the issue.

Cheers,

Michael

I believe the problem was that if clisp crashed and restarted those processes could get stuck at 99% and not be killed at exit.

This hasn't been reported in a while, so I would prefer to close this as fixed. Thoughts?

Cheers,

Michael
