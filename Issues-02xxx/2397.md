This could also be done with matrix_from_rows_and_columns(self, rows, columns)

I'll open a new ticket.

Patch worked.

This seems to be consistent. I can reproduce this Segmentation fault on an other install.

My hypothesis is that a cdef is replaced by a def. Is this possible?

Gladly. The bug was in `matrix_from_columns`, around line 718.  I was checking against `self._ncols`:
  

```
            for r from 0 <= r < self._ncols: 
                A.set_unsafe(r,k, self.get_unsafe(r,columns[i])) 
```

when I should be checking against `self._nrows`

```
            for r from 0 <= r < self._nrows: 
                A.set_unsafe(r,k, self.get_unsafe(r,columns[i])) 
```

This didn't go over well for non-sqaure matrices, since we weren't checking bounds anyway.

> The hg bundle should also work now.

we have a very strong preference for patches over bundles, especially for single commits. Is there a specific reason you don't use mercurial to export patches?

Cheers,

Michael
