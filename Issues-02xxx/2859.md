Try the following:

```
plot(vector((0,0,-1)))
```

The resulting vector points up, but should point down.

The problem is in arrow3d:

```
sage: arrow3d((0,0,0), (0,0,-1))
*points up*
```

All right, this was because we were taking the cross product with (0,0,1) and using that to decide whether or not to rotate the vector, ignoring the case that we point in the opposite direction (but still have a cross product of zero).

Patch will be attached.  I'm marking this a blocker since it gives a *wrong* result and William said that wrong results should be marked as blockers.

It doesn't relate.  

In this ticket, the arrow is actually wrong (the assumption in the code is that "parallel to (0,0,1)" == "pointing in the same direction as (0,0,1)", which is just wrong.

The issue in #1777 is a cosmetic issue related to the menus in JMOL.

The patch works as advertised and the code looks good to me. Positive review for the code, and I'll give it full positive review once you sort out this minor complaint about the doctest: instead of "A downward pointing arrow should have a transformation scaling the points to their negatives" do you mean to say something like "a downward-pointing arrow *corresponds* to a transformation *which reverses the z-coordinates* of points"?

Mostly I'm confused because when you give me a vector in R<sup>3</sup> and ask me what linear transformation of R<sup>3</sup> to itself that it's describing, I naturally think of reflection across the perpendicular plane. The vector (0,0,-1) doesn't say "take (x,y,z) to (-x,-y,-z)" to me...but maybe this is just me, and perhaps it's more an issue with `get_transformation` than with `arrow3d`.

At any rate, if you're a bit more clear in that description, you'll be good to go.
