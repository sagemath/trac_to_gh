I just checked, this ticket depends on #2622 and #2611 . After these two have been applied it applies cleanly.

> Looking at the patch, it looks pretty good. The only comment I have is that `__interface` shouldn't have to be declared in `pbori.pxd` -- it should already be there from `ring.pxd` 


It isn't:

```
sage: search_src("__interface")
----------------------------------------------------------------------
| SAGE Version 2.10.4, Release Date: 2008-03-17                      |
| Type notebook() for the GUI, and license() for information.        |
----------------------------------------------------------------------
structure/sage_object.pyx:                X = self.__interface[I]
structure/sage_object.pyx:                    self.__interface = {}
structure/sage_object.pyx:                    # an __interface attribute.
structure/sage_object.pyx:                self.__interface[I] = X
rings/polynomial/pbori.pyx:        self.__interface = {}
rings/ring.pxd:    cdef public object __interface
rings/polynomial/pbori.pxd:    cdef public object __interface
```

That definition in `ring.pxd` is for `FiniteField`.

You are correct about `__interaface`, sorry. Still trying to figure out all the dependancies I need to test this (#2622 seems nontrivial).

Don't apply this patch, I'm splitting this up in the not PolyBoRi related parts and the PolyBoRi parts which I base on the 0.3.1 patch.
