sage-build-debian will probably eventually want to look something like this.  I'm not applying it as a patch because it'll break the previous patchset:

DEBIAN_REPO would be set to point to a temporary Debian repository that is in the approx sources.list for SAGE, so that each package has its dependencies uploaded to the test repo when it comes time to build it for Debian.

#!/bin/sh -x
echo "Starting Debian build"
[ -d dist/debian ] || exit 0 # exit cleanly for packages we're using the Debian versions of
mv dist/debian src/
sage-dasource src/
sage-sbuildhack "$DEBIAN_RELEASE" *.dsc || exit 1
mkdir -p $SAGE_ROOT/deb
DEBIAN_ARCH=$(echo lenny-amd64 | cut -f 2 -d-)
reprepro -b $DEBIAN_REPO --ignore=wrongdistribution include *_${DEBIAN_ARCH}.changes
mv *.dsc *.changes *.build *.deb *.tar.gz *.diff.gz /deb
echo "Debian Build complete"

Patches look good to me. I sat next to Tim as he wrote most of the code, so maybe somebody else wants to take another look. In the end we might need to generalize the code a little more for other packaging systems.

Cheers,
