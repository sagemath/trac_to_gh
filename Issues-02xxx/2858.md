To my understanding, the issue in #1877 was the specifying of the same variable in two different ranges.  This issue is different: when I use "-u", I get an error, but when I use an expression that is equivalent to "-u", I don't get an error.  In either case, I'm not specifying two of the same variable for the ranges.

I think these issues are different.  They may be symptoms of the same thing, but I doubt it.

Changing the issue title to be more descriptive.

To elaborate on the reopening: the issue here is not with the ranges (to my knowledge, it isn't even possible to specify variables for the ranges in parametric_plot3d).  The issue here is with the components of the function being plotted.
