I think these issues are different.  They may be symptoms of the same thing, but I doubt it.

Changing the issue title to be more descriptive.

To elaborate on the reopening: the issue here is not with the ranges (to my knowledge, it isn't even possible to specify variables for the ranges in parametric_plot3d).  The issue here is with the components of the function being plotted.

The problem seems to be in parametric_plot3d.py in adapt_to_callable, in the line "s=sum(f)".  If there is a u and a -u as components of f, then sum(f) cancels these and the variable disappears.
