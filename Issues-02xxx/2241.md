The ticket is different than #2239. 

The issue seems to be in the coercion code somewhere:

```
==25102== 164,280 bytes in 4,107 blocks are definitely lost in loss record 8,413 of 8,436

I don't know how to read this.  Will a similar approach as in #2239 fix this memleak?  (In totallyreal_rel.py, numpy.roots is called on an array of floats instead of ints...)
