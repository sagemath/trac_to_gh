The following works:

```
sage: p = ((1, 2, 4, 5, 3, 6))
sage: q = Permutation(p)
sage: q.to_cycles()
[(1, 2, 4, 5, 3, 6)]
sage: q.cycle_type()
[6]
```

...but if `p` is a list of tuples, it doesn't, and Permutation doesn't tell you that it's not happy with the input:

```
sage: p = [(1, 2, 4, 5, 3, 6)]
sage: q = Permutation(p)
sage: q.to_cycles()
