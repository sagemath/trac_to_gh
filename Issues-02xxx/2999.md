AFAIK at least ratpoints doesn't [yet] have its own ticket; I would have left this ticket open as a meta-ticket until all issues (or spkgs) have really been fixed.

Aha.  I knew `CC` was "intentionally" unset in GAP's `spkg-install` for a long time (which was annoying anyway), but **now** I still get:

```
gcc version 4.6.3 (GCC)

*WARNING*: Unsetting CXX since that tends to break GAP building

************************************************************************

```

So if there's been an issue with `CC` and `CXX` set, it might have been **fixed upstream** (I believe so), but it **isn't fixed in Sage**.

[The problem here simply is that the "default" `gcc`, which is 4.4.3, doesn't understand some of the options I pass in `CFLAGS`.  GCC 4.6.3, specified in `CC`, of course *does* understand them.]

This (ratpoints) is now #12682 (**needing review**).
