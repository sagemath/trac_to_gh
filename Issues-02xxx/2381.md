Is the a way to produce "quiver plots" for 2d vector fields? plot_vector_field should accept functions of two parameters, but doesn't:

Usage example:

```
sage: vf1 = plot_vector_field((lambda x:sin(x), lambda y:cos(y)), (-3,3), (-3,3))
```

With 2 arguments:

```
sage: plot_vector_field((lambda x,y:y,lambda x,y:(cos(x)-2)*sin(x)),(-pi,pi),(-pi,pi))
<type 'exceptions.TypeError'>: <lambda>() takes exactly 2 arguments (1 given)
```

Having functions that take two arguments is the right thing to do.  I have a patch that I'll post here in a second.
