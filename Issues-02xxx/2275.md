I don't think this is a good idea:

```
All sloane_functions have extensive examples, but from design they are
placed just after the class declaration.
It feels stupid to have "internal" functions
starting with '__' or '_' documented with EXAMPLES!

Let us think at the effect on the reference manual.
I don't think it is a good idea to have internal functions like
__init, _repr and other "hidden" fuctions documented with examples
figuring in the Reference Manual.

If we want users of the OEIS to use Sage, we have to provide them with
adequate examples. Maybe raising the doctest coverage with 2% looks good
but it isn't in this case.

Adding some sloane-functions I was following the 'template'. So there
is, maybe, something wrong with the overall design.

Generally spoken yes, but in this case I have my doubts.
