When the new code for point counting on elliptic curves over arbitrary finite fields was implemented, I left handling the special cases j=0 and j=1728 for a rainy day.  These cases were handled in not too bad a way, but as there are special formulas for these cases it was always going to be a good idea to implement them.

Not having any reference which does everything needed here (especially for the really exceptional cases where the characteristic is 2 or 3 and j=0=1728) I worked it all out from scratch, and here is the result.

There are copious comments and doctests.  I will write up the full justification in due course.  In the meantime I hope we can merge this patch (based on 3.0.alpha1) quite soon!

Two small changes to be applied after the main patch:

* In abelian_group() when j=0 or 1728 call cardinality() first, now that it is very fast, as that speeds up the group computation

* In abelian_group(), a small adjustment to speed up the linear_relation() finding for the second generator.
