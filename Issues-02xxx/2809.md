In combinat/root_system.py, the fundamental weights for the various root systems are entered by hand. For G2, the fundamental weights were the negatives of what they should be.

Attachment: **[g2.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket2809/g2.patch.gz)**

This is a dupe of #2808, so I am closing it. Dan: once you open a ticket and you hit "submit" you should remove the "preview" bit from the url before going on. This is a buglet in trac and you aren't the first one who has been bitten by it.

Cheers,

Michael
