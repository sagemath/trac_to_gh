For your information, you might find the attached version more
packageable (it can live outside NTL, for instance). Yet, the build
process is still tricky: Auto tuning and so on. Depending on your
preferred practices for sage, your preferred option could be to
statically save the thresholds file per-machine.

GF2X has now its own development page: http://gf2x.gforge.inria.fr/.
It should be easier to incorporate into Sage now, but maybe it would be better
to include it through NTL, since since NTL 5.5, NTL can be configured to use GF2X as
auxiliary package. In such a way, Sage will benefit from GF2X for all computations with NTL.

Paul, I'm finally packaging this, only planning to build NTL on top of it, no "native" interface.
Is tuning still highly recommended? Because it really takes a long time.
I was thinking of providing an option (GF2X_TUNE=yes/no, any better idea?) to enable/disable it, not sure what the default should be.
The README suggests it would be yes by default.

Upped spkgs, with the GF2X_TUNE option off by default (took one hour on a quite recent Xeon (with only one thread, but I did not test whether tuning gets parallelized)).
Set it to yes to perform tuning.

I did not check this actually speeds up NTL, anyone wanting to benchmark the new NTL spkg against the old one please go ahead.

As NTL is a standard spkg, not sure what the way to go is.
Jeroen please decide what to do.

> Jeroen please decide what to do.

Why should I?  *You* should decide if you want this:
a. as standard package (which requires a discussion on `sage-devel` and changes to `spkg/standard/deps`)
b. as optional package (but then NTL needs to work both with and without `gf2x`)
c. not at all

Just for hint, my experience playing with FLINT, using gf2x for GF(2) polynomials instead of the basic implementation inside FLINT using long gave an incredible speedup.
And from the maybe 4 years ago comments in the ticket description, it should also seepdup NTL.
I just don't have the time or the motivation to benchmark products of GF(2**n) elements (once you don't use Givaro) right now to prove it is beneficial.

Jean-Pierre,

make tune-lowlevel is still highly recommended, since it will choose the best routine up to 9 words.
It takes a little more than one minute on my 4-year-old laptop (including recompiling the library).

Then you can do say `make tune-toom TOOM_TUNING_LIMIT=100` to choose the best algorithm up to say
100 words (i.e., degree < 6400 on a 64-bit computer). It should take a few minutes only.

On my pc, multiplying two random elements of GF(2**10000) goes from 103us in Sage 5.9 with old NTL to 21.4us in 5.10.rc0 with NTL+gf2x.

while trying gf2x-1.1 on my laptop, I hit a bug due to the fact that the tuning gave
`GF2X_MUL_TOOM4_ALWAYS_THRESHOLD=16`, whereas a value at least 30 is required.
The following patch will avoid this problem (or detect it earlier). It is against the development version but should be easily adapted to 1.1:

W.r.t. gf2x:

The following doesn't work (`-O0` never takes effect):

```sh

if [ "$SAGE64" = "yes" ]; then
    echo "Building a 64-bit version of gf2x."
    ABI="64"; export ABI
    CFLAGS="-O2 -g -m64 $CFLAGS"; export CFLAGS
else
    CFLAGS="-O2 -g $CFLAGS"; export CFLAGS
fi

if [ "$SAGE_DEBUG" = "yes" ]; then
    echo "Building a debug version of gf2x."
    CFLAGS="-O0 -g $CFLAGS"; export CFLAGS
fi
```

`$SAGE_LOCAL` should be quoted in the `rm` commands in `spkg-install`.

Harmless, but warning could be avoided by using `sizeof(gf2x_mul_pool_t)` or `sizeof(p[0])` instead in

```c
void gf2x_mul_pool_init(gf2x_mul_pool_t p)
{
    memset(p, 0, sizeof(p));
}
```

You didn't fix "gf2x is a C/C+ software package" though... ;-)

Could you attach a diff of **your** changes?

I don't want to re-review everything.  Retesting is odd enough.

I would have dropped the "C++"; if gf2x was (partially) implemented in C++, we'd have to set / change `CXXFLAGS` as well.

I'd probably also use `$CFLAG64` instead of hardcoding `-m64`.
