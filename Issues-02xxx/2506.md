I think this may be a subtlety having to do with Python comparison (although I'm tempted to call it a bug, maybe "subtlety" is more P.C.). The funny thing is if you define the method

```
def __ne__(self, other):
    return (not (self == other))
```
you get the correct behavior. Before making a patch, it might be good to figure out why this is the case...

The correct behavior is the following:

```
sage: g = Graph()
sage: g2 = g.copy()
sage: g == g
True
sage: g != g
False
sage: g2 == g
True
sage: g2 != g
False
sage: g is g
True
sage: g2 is g
False
```

Aparently, to have proper behavior, we do have to implement the `__ne__` method:
