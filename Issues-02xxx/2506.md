I think this may be a subtlety having to do with Python comparison (although I'm tempted to call it a bug, maybe "subtlety" is more P.C.). The funny thing is if you define the method

```
def __ne__(self, other):
    return (not (self == other))
```
you get the correct behavior. Before making a patch, it might be good to figure out why this is the case...
