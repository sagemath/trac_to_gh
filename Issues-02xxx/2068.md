Hi,

libpng-1.2.22.p5 added this in spkg-install:
LDFLAGS="-L\"$SAGE_LOCAL/lib\" $LDFLAGS"

I tried the following modification:
LDFLAGS="-L$SAGE_LOCAL/lib $LDFLAGS"
and it worked.

The problem is that quoting the arg of -L seems still wise as the path
could contain a space but it seems it interferes with the (eval
"$ac_link") 2>conftest.er1  in src/configure.
E.g. the original LD_FLAGS definition works if we use instead: (eval
bash -c \"$ac_link\") 2>conftest.er1

```

Component: **packages: standard**
