which only returns lists rather than Partition_class objects.


This is also useful where you don't necessarily need the Partition_class object, you just need the values.


Before the patch:

```
sage: timeit a = Partitions(40).list()
10 loops, best of 3: 1.4 s per loop
```

After the patch:

```
sage: timeit a = Partitions(40).list()
10 loops, best of 3: 280 ms per loop
```
