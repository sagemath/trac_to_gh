On Mac OS X (10.4.11 in my case), when the configure script for 'gnutls' runs, it will detect 'guile' and attempt to build the Guile bindings, if it finds a locally-installed Guile package (in my case, from MacPorts, in "/opt").  This causes the build to break.

```

If the PATH variable does not give access to the installed Guile package, the build proceeds without a problem.

I think this is a bug, since building Sage should be independent of the packages installed elsewhere on the system (that is why Sage has so many pieces, after all).

Some possible fixes:
- force the PATH variable to some plain-vanilla setting.
- use the "-norc" and "-noprofile" switches when starting subshells
   (and maybe make sure the shells are not 'login' or 'interactive')
- force the building of 'gnutls' to avoid this particular problem
   (I think this can be done with "--enable-guile=no' in the configure
   script)

Hi Justin, 

I am not sure if disabling guile support will work as you suggest, i.e. `--enable-guile=no`, but the spkg at 

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mabshoff/SPKG/gnutls-2.2.1.p1.spkg

does that. I don't think your other suggestions will work since it will break the build for other people. It might actually be also worth to fix the issue by fixing the Makefiles.

Cheers,

Michael

Based on my experience with 2.10.1.rc[345], this can be overcome the 'configure' flag "--enable-guile=no".  That seems to be the most straight-forward solution.

Hi Justin,
