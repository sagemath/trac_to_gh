On some OS/compiler variants, the "Padlock" support fails to compile.

See http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/9d4b39e961c24e4f/89bfb1cd2822ffd2?lnk=gst&q=rijndael#89bfb1cd2822ffd2 for details.

The easy fix is to add "--disable-padlock-support" in the call to configure.

The spkg at

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mabshoff/release-cycles-2.10.2/alpha0/libgcrypt-1.4.0.p0.spkg

adds the option Paul suggested. It passes compile tests on 32 and 64 bit Linux boxen.
