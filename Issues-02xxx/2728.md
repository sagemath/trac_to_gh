I think these are problems with the maxima doctests below, unless there's a good reason why things should be printing without the "0." at the front or why small roundoff errors should matter.  None of them are materially different answers.

This is running with maxima 5.13.0 (the current in Debian lenny).

This is not **Sage Specific**: It might be due to Debian packaging an older version of Maxima or alternatively be caused by using gcl instead of clisp. It is certainly borderline, but I don't think in this case it is on our end to fix this. 

Cheers,
