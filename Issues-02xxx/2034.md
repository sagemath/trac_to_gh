Add `__floordiv__` to the coercion model for `RingElement` and change `__floordiv__` to `_floordiv_` where applicable.

This does not change any semantics of floor division, but it does fix floor division in a few cases where coercion is involved. It also fixes various segmentation faults like

```
sage: R.<x> = QQbar[]
sage: int(1) // x
...
```

Finally, we also implement `__itruediv__`, which was forgotten when adding `__truediv__`.

According to the "principle of least surprise", supporting floordiv for finite fields looks suspicious

```
sage: ZZ(5) // ZZ(3)

sage: GF(7)(5) // GF(7)(3)

If this is just an alias of division, why do we need it?

That's outside the scope of this ticket. This ticket only implements coercion for `__floordiv__`, it doesn't otherwise change the semantics of floor division. There shouldn't be anything controversial in this ticket.
