```
The function

 random_prime(n)

returns differing types of objects. When n is 2, it returns a Sage
integer. When n is > 2, it returns a Python integer. A look at the
source code gives the impression that it should return a Sage
integer.

Perhaps devel/sage-main/sage/rings/arith.py line 907 should be
changed from
   return p
to
   return integer_ring.ZZ(p)
