It would be really nice if this worked:

```
sage: var('x y')
sage: f=x^2+y^2<=1
sage: g=f._fast_float_('x','y')
sage: g(1,2)
False
sage: g(0.5,0.5)
True
```

Here is a toy implementation:

```
def ff(func,*args):
    g1 = func.left()._fast_float_(*args)
    g2 = func.right()._fast_float_(*args)
    oper = func.operator()
    def ret(*sub_args):
        return oper(g1(*sub_args), g2(*sub_args))
    return ret
```
