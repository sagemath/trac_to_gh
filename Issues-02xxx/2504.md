The following was reported by Luis Finotti on sage-support, here: http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support/browse_thread/thread/f01e8661743d36d4#

The following commands return an error:

```
   P.<x>=PolynomialRing(QQ)
   f=x^17+3
   K=NumberField(f,'a')
   K.units(proof=True) # default
```
because Sage is incapable of performing the computation with proof=True.
(The error ends with "not enough precomputed primes, need primelimit ~  (35)".)

If you then do

```
   K.units(proof=False)
```
you get an answer immediately; then repeating the original

```
   K.units(proof=True)
```
gives you the unproved answer again even though proof=True is specified.

Wait -- if you ask for units with proof, the value is cached.  If you then ask for it without proof, shouldn't we return the cached value?  The code doesn't look like it does that.

You are completely right.  I've replaced the patch and reorganized the code so it looks a bit cleaner.
