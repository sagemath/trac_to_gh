I used these packages to upgrade from earlier versions of Jaap's packages; the installations went perfectly, and my code (which uses wxPython, vtk, and tvtk (from mayavi)) worked fine after the upgrade.

mayvi2 should be built locally, so no need to get external sources!

Dependencies for now:

install vtk-5.0.4.spkg (see https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/2493 )

Be sure you have installed wxPython-2.8.7.1.spkg (in experimental already!)
 and setuptools-0.6c8.spkg

Or put everything temporarily in spkg/standard, etcetera see the README.txt

A couple remarks:

* the build directory should be called src
* please remove the `.svn` directories, that cuts the size of the spkg in half.
* check in the file to the repo. I did the initial checkin, so in the future you need to check in only the changes

The updated spkg is at

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mabshoff/release-cycles-2.11/experimental/mayavi_2.1.1-20080307.p0.spkg

Cheers,

One thing I forgot: I very much dislike the fact that it forced automated downloads of things like wxPython in case it isn't installed. It is clear from the readme that those ought to be already installed, but we need to find a more elegant way how to solve the "dependency of non-standard spkg" problem.

Cheers,

Michael

Before we have this elegant solution the spkg-install should be consistent with reality!
So reflect that mayavi2 depends on vtk-5.0.4.p0 as you name the package.

The same holds for the vtk spkg, because it depends on cmake.

Jaap



```
#!/bin/sh

sage -i wxPython-2.8.7.1
sage -i vtk-5.0.4.p0


cd src

python egg_builder.py -r -v

easy_install -f dist -H dist enthought.mayavi*
```

The mayavi_2.1.1-20080307.p1.spkg does not work for me.


```
MayaVi2 seems to build, but fails to run mlab!

What the difference between mayavi_2.1.1-20080307.p1.spkg
and my original mayavi_2.1.1-20080307.spkg?

1) mv mayavi_build src
2) rm all .svn stuff
3) add .hg and friends

```

My hypothesis for now is that the .svn directories contain
essential information for the build system. I might be wrong, ...

I did a diff -r on both directories, only .svn files missing! See:

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jsp/diff_file

I did a fresh install on fresh installed sage-2.10.4,
sage-2.11.alpha0, sage-2.11.alpha1 on two machines. The results are consistent.

About time to close this ticket again! A working modified version can be found here:

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jsp/mayavi_2.1.1-20080307.p1.spkg

Now the package is announced to be in sage-2.11 I don't think it is wise to have a wrong spkg in the experimental repo.

Updated the spkg with Jaap's latest. So I am closing this again since I just mirrored the repo out again.
