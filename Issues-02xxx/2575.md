i'm using ccache to speed up compilation. this works very well for other packages, but the configure script of GAP seems to be have an error.

environment variables:

```
CC=ccache gcc
CXX=ccache g++
```

my guess:

<div id="comment:1" align="right">Comment 1</div>

just fo the record, problem still exists in 3.0 - this time the build process doesn't halt but continues (no info about failed gap).

after ./sage startup it raises a runtime exception complaining about broken gap.

This has now popped up in other places. For now the short term solution is to unset CC in spkg-install. More long term we need to fix the autoconf issue and/or report this bug upstream.

We do not reopen tickets that have been fixed. This is not a regression, but the problem is that you set CXX in addition to CC. Unsetting CXX in the spkg-install will fix your problem, but for that open another ticket.

Harald, 

I now see that your original bug report also raises the issue with CXX, but since we hit this bug on another machine with CC and not CXX set we ended up fixing only the CXX case. You should still open a new ticket and not open old tickets for issues like that since it will muddy HISTORY.txt, i.e. fixing #2575 twice will only confuse people looking for specific tickets. Also resolving those tickets is messy since the comments on this ticket are already long. So a clean new ticket will solve all those problems.

Perhaps striping 'ccache' out with 'sed' might have been a better solution.

this ticket is already closed & fixed since it works. Is there a new compile problem? (If yes -> new ticket)

for me ccache works!

And stripping stuff out is probably not so cool, since it disables ccache ;)

Unsetting `CC` and `CXX` (as is currently done) also disables it. ;-)

If GAP still fails to configure / build when `CC` or `CXX` contain multiple words, we should probably unset `CC` and `CXX` **just in that case**, since currently even `CC=gcc-4.6.3` etc. are broken, and if the "default" gcc doesn't understand the flags intended for `$CC`, the build fails for no real reason.

For the record: My GAP 4.4.12.p7 spkg for #7041 will just do that.
