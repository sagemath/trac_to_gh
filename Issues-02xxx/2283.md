In this example the last print statement goes boom, but should work fine.

```
class Foo:
   def __rmul__(self, left):
      return 'hello'

H = Foo()
print int(3)*H
print 3*H
```

<a id='comment:2'></a>Currently, (before this patch), if a class did

```
_r_action = __rmul__
```

things would work since the coercion model looks for an _r_action function as a last resort.  This patch just makes this line unnecessary by having the coercion system also look for an __rmul__ function (which is standard python; see http://docs.python.org/ref/numeric-types.html)

Apparently this patch is controversial to at least one person, so it probably ought to be discussed.

credit goes to gfurnish for noticing and helping track down the segfault that the original patch introduced!

Apply coercion-rmul2.patch instead of coercion-rmul.patch
