I also think the patch looks good, though I agree with malb's points.  Also I have no experience myself in wrapping code (even my own ;)) so the fact that it looks ok to me does not count for much.

Since this patch has required a little tinkering with eclib itself, I think I need to download that, compare with the latest version of my own, and check that nothing is broken...
