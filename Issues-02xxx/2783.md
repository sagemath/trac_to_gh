Hi,

I was very embarrassed while teaching today since maybe 15 times I got
crap like this in the output from the notebook:

```
print "\x01r\x01e580"
```

This is from the synchronization code that *I* wrote.  It "should" never happen.  Anyways it does -- but of course only when 40 people are watching you :-(.  Anyways, to solve this ticket should mean to simply look at that synchro code again, think about it, and rewrite it in a way that is _more_ robust. 

William

I doubt it.  rpy is a C-library interface to R.

Those special looking \x01r characters are synchronization control characters that Sage itself (in the file worksheet.py) puts in the output stream.
