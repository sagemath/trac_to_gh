<a id='comment:8'></a>From CRAIG:

```
So I think I'm ready for this to get merged. I've played around with
just about all of the code, and I looked through the last 2-3 files
that I hadn't looked at much since Tucson. I can't say that I read
every line of everything, of course, but I feel pretty comfortable
with the code overall. There are lots of things I want to start
working on, of course, but none of them are defects -- they're all
enhancements.

I went ahead and reformatted one or two things, and added some long
doctests to the top of homspace.py. I feel like adding a 387th patch
to the ticket is silly, since you'll probably also have one or two
small touch-ups, so you'll probably just re-roll the bundle. I'm
attaching the patch to this email.

As long as you feel like the code you didn't write seems reasonable
enough, I feel like this is ready to get merged.
```


I've posted a new abvar.hg patch, which is the one that should be applied.
