From CRAIG:

```
So I think I'm ready for this to get merged. I've played around with
just about all of the code, and I looked through the last 2-3 files
that I hadn't looked at much since Tucson. I can't say that I read
every line of everything, of course, but I feel pretty comfortable
with the code overall. There are lots of things I want to start
working on, of course, but none of them are defects -- they're all
enhancements.

I went ahead and reformatted one or two things, and added some long
doctests to the top of homspace.py. I feel like adding a 387th patch
to the ticket is silly, since you'll probably also have one or two
small touch-ups, so you'll probably just re-roll the bundle. I'm
attaching the patch to this email.

As long as you feel like the code you didn't write seems reasonable
enough, I feel like this is ready to get merged.
```


I've posted a new abvar.hg patch, which is the one that should be applied.

IIRC this compares just memory posititions, so it ought to be #random.

Modular Abelian Varieties

Code at https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/2544

Todo on Wednesday, March 19

9:00-12:00am

DONE (craig) 3: Hom(A,B) for A, B simple
DONE (robert) 3: Hom(A,B) in general
DONE (william) 2: cokernels of morphisms
DONE (william) 2: dual of A when A is maximal
DONE (william) images of abelian varieties and groups under morphisms. (2 hours)
DONE (william) intersections of finite groups
12:00am - 5am + airport:

plan for:
trim the paper
doctests
optimization
bug hunting

(craig) 2: norm equations (clean up patch) (1 hour)
5: minimal isogeny degree (3 hours)
intersection pairing.

(william) 3: dual isogeny when A,B both maximal
Todo on Tuesday, March 18

DONE (craig) 2: disc(End(A))
DONE (craig) 2: degeneracy maps
DONE (craig) 1: fix hecke operators
DONE (robert) 1: create newforms and abvars from label, where label is 389aG1, 389aGH[2,3], 389b, 389c, etc.
DONE (robert) 1: complementary isogeny (invert matrix and clear denom)
DONE (william) 2: quotient by abelian subvariety
DONE (william) 2: kernels of morphisms
DONE (william) 2: projection (only when 'maximal')
Todo on March 16

   Jacobian of the modular curve associated to the congruence subgroup Gamma0(37)
DONE (william) Move functions out of abvar_modsym_factor into abvar and delete that file.
DONE (william) Torsion subgroups:
(already done) Refactor base class
(done) Get implementation to work with defining data being (lattice, abvar); compute generators.
(done) Quotients by finite subgroup
DONE (craig) Implement f.number() for f a newform.
DONE-ish (craig) Compute the Hecke algebra image in End(A) and find a good clean way to represent for Hecke stable. New object that is a subring of End(A). Have methods like R.index_in(S).
DONE (craig) abelian varieties should cache their ambient modular abelian variety
