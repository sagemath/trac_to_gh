Hi,

I wrote db and version methods that all SageObjects have.  It seemed like a good idea at the time.  They didn't catch on -- nobody finds this interesting, etc.  I vote for completely removing them from Sage.

Otherwise all is well.  I guess this is my fault for asking for the deprecation warning after you did your long doctests, my apologies.
