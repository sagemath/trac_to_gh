Expected:
    Help on FiniteWordPath_2d_str in module sage.combinat.words.paths object:
    ...
    Methods inherited from FiniteWordPath_2d:
    ...
    Methods inherited from FiniteWordPath_all:
    ...
    This only works on Python classes that derive from SageObject.
Got:
<stuff ending with>
     |      This only works on Python classes that derive from SageObject.
     |      
     |      TESTS::
     |      
     |          sage: v = DiGraph().version()
     |          doctest:... DeprecationWarning: version() is deprecated.
     |          See http://trac.sagemath.org/2536 for details.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage -t src/sage/combinat/words/paths.py  # 1 doctest failed
```
Otherwise all is well.  I guess this is my fault for asking for the deprecation warning after you did your long doctests, my apologies.
