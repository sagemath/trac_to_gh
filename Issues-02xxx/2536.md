I'm a little surprised that doctest works since it does return a value, but I guess the `:...` covers that instead of the usual `:...:`.    Running doctests again but hopefully all is well.

Expected:

    This only works on Python classes that derive from SageObject.
Got:

Otherwise all is well.  I guess this is my fault for asking for the deprecation warning after you did your long doctests, my apologies.
