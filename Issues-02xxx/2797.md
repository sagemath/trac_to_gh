A minor update to the `zn_poly` spkg I posted a few days ago. This fixes some memory leaks in the test suite and a read from uninitialised memory picked up by valgrind, and retrospectively renames the previous release to `zn_poly-0.8.alpha0` :-)

<a id='comment:1'>Comment 1:</a>
There are two issues with this SPKG which I have fixed:

* the changes to SPKG.txt haven't been checked in
* the spkg named zn_poly-0.8.p0.spkg must unpack to zn_poly-0.8.p0

I have fixed both issues [and some in accuracies in SPKG.txt, i.e. the renaming, in the SPKG I merged.

Cheers,

Michael
