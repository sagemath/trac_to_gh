I think this is a ** MAJOR BUG ** introduced by a new feature that Tom Boothby
just implemented in the notebook (and that I didn't catch in the referee process).  
This is definitely a block for 2.11.    Try the following to replicate it:
   1. Create a new blank worksheet with several blank cells
   2. Type 2+2 in the first cell -- do *NOT* press shift enter. 
   3. Simply move the cursor out of the first cell to the second one (use down arrow).
   4. Now refresh the page -- or better leave the page and go back and refresh.
  The plus sign vanishes!

The problem is that when you change a cell and move the cursor out,
the changed cell is incorrectly sent back to the server.   To avoid this
for now, never ever change a cell without shift-entering it.
