Some comments from IRC:

[17:16] <jason-> hi everyone.
[17:16] <mabshoff> Hi jason
[17:16] <mabshoff> Hi jason-
[17:16] <jason-> mabshoff: did you get the long doctest resolved?
[17:16] <wstein> hi
[17:17] <jason-> sorry we didn't check those doctests.
[17:17] <jason-> oh, so it wasn't really a problem?
[17:17] <mabshoff> jason-: Ahh, you read the log.
[17:17] <jason-> :)
[17:17] <mabshoff> But the problem is still open.
[17:17] <mabshoff> I am about to open tickets for all rc1 issues that I see and release a rc1 tarball 
[17:17] <mabshoff> and binary dist for sage.math in about an hour or two.
[17:17] <jason-> okay, I'll read that then.
[17:17] <jason-> great.
[17:18] <mabshoff> Give me a sec, I can point you to the failure then.
[17:18] <mabshoff> I didn't happen before merging Robert's patch, so it isn't in rc0.
[17:18] <mabshoff> But it is PermutationGroup related, i.e. 
[17:18] <mabshoff>     PermutationGroup([perm_group_elt(aa) for aa in gens]).order() # long time###line 1208:_sage_    >>> PermutationGroup([perm_group_elt(aa) for aa in gens]).order() # long time
[17:18] <mabshoff> Expected:
[17:18] <mabshoff>     46080
[17:18] <mabshoff> Got:
[17:18] <mabshoff>     16492674416640
[17:19] <jason-> wow, that's a big difference.
[17:19] <mabshoff> Yep. It makes me a little queasy.
[17:19] <jason-> i hope it's not a sign issue.
[17:19] <mabshoff> I think wdj and mhansen worked in that area a while back, so the doctest might 
[17:19] <jason-> (i.e., -46000 interpreted as an unsigned number)
[17:19] <mabshoff> Ok, that makes sense.
[17:20] <jason-> when I see numbers jump like that, that's what I think of.
[17:20] <cwitty> sage: (16492674416640).str(base=16)
[17:20] <cwitty> 'f0000000000'
[17:20] <mabshoff> A wrapping issue would explain it.
[17:20] <mabshoff> Let me run valgrind on it.
[17:20] <mabshoff> Maybe it is in initialization issue.
[17:20] <jason-> yeah, that hex string looks awfully suspicious :)
[17:21] <jason-> and that's a cool function too.  I'm going to have to remember that.
