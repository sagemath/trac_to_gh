This isn't an "easy" problem, but it looks [this](http://www.intridea.com/2007/12/16/faking-onpaste-in-firefox) should do the trick.

> That will not work on cells that are created after the page loads. 

Indeed.  I don't think this patch should go in with that major shortcoming.  Can we just set the onpaste handler for all worksheet cells whenever they are created? 

2. I just tried pasting text into both firefox and safari cells and they *already* do resize.  So is this whole ticket just invalid?   Maybe no patch is needed at all anyways?    That matches with my memory, which is that Tom and I fixed this problem a year ago or so by rewriting the textarea resize code.
