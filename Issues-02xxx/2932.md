From Alex Ghitza:

```
sage: M = matrix(CDF, 2, 2, [(-1 - 2*I, 5 - 6*I), (-2 - 4*I, 10 - 12*I)])
sage: M.is_invertible()
True
sage: M.determinant()
5.3290705182e-15 + 1.7763568394e-15*I
sage: M.inverse()
[ 1.01330991616e+15 - 2.58956978574e+15*I -5.06654958079e+14 +
1.29478489287e+15*I]
[ 5.62949953421e+14 + 5.62949953421e+14*I -2.81474976711e+14 -
2.81474976711e+14*I]

So because of roundoff errors, Sage thinks that we have an invertible
matrix.  But the code for echelon_form knows that it's not invertible:

sage: M.echelon_form()
[                                    1.0                             1.4
+ 3.2*I]
[-2.22044604925e-16 - 4.4408920985e-16*I
~       0]
sage: M.rank()
1

I propose that this code is working as intended - it cannot be expected that floating point calculations always provide the same results as would be obtained using precise calculations. It cannot either be assumed that two calculations that are equivalent using precise numbers are equivalent when using approximations. The attached patch adds docstring explanations of this to real and complex number classes and fields.

Other than that, I get this using Sage version 3.0:

```
sage: M = matrix(CDF, 2, 2, [(-1 - 2*I, 5 - 6*I), (-2 - 4*I, 10 - 12*I)])
sage: M.is_invertible()
False
```

If is_invertible and inverse() do not use standard numerical linear algebra functions (e.g., use ATLAS), then why not?  If it's an issue of NotImplemented, then let's open a ticket.  I would probably get to it by sometime this summer, since we have a numerical linear algebra workshop where I'm at.

From IRC (with editing out of other unrelated conversation):

```
[20:15] <jason--> re: 2932; what algorithms are used for numerical linear algebra over CDF for inverse() and is_invertible()?
[20:15] <jason--> I don't find those functions in matrix_complex_double_dense.pyx
[20:16] <jason--> are they the generic algorithms in matrix*.pyx?
[20:16] <wstein-3053> If they aren't in matrix_complex_double_dense then they are the generic ones.
[20:17] <jason--> thanks; also, does anyone have any feelings for GSL compared to numpy for numerical linear algebra?
[20:17] <wstein-3053> numpy is usually better.
[20:18] <jason--> okay; do you mind if we switch the determinant function to numpy for matrices over CDF?
[20:18] <wstein-3053> jason-- please do.
[20:19] <jason--> okay; ticket coming right up.
