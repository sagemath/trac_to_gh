BOOM!


This is a bug.  Fortunately, there is an easy workaround (see below). 
Don't put PolynomialRing(CC, 1); instead put PolynomialRing(CC).

sage: R.<z> = PolynomialRing(CC)
sage: f = z^4 - 6*z + 3
sage: f.factor()
(1.00000000000000*z - 1.60443920904349) * (1.00000000000000*z - 0.511399619393097) * (1.00000000000000*z + 1.05791941421830 - 1.59281852704435*I) * (1.00000000000000*z + 1.05791941421830 + 1.59281852704435*I)

The problem is that PolynomialRing(CC,1) creates a *multivariate polynomial ring*
which happens to be in 1 variable, whereas PolynomialRing(CC) creates a 
univariate polynomial ring (which is implemented under the hood differently
than a multivariate polynomial ring).

The bug is that PolynomialRing(CC,1) should create a univariate ring,
whereas MPolynomialRing(CC,1) should be how one creates a multivariate
poly ring in 1 variable.   (I think.)

Alternatively, the bug is that factoring a multivariate polynomial in 1 variable
uses Singular instead of other better univariate code that we have.

I agree.

Also, I agree.

Since MPolynomialRing is deprecated now, the reported behavior is indeed the correct behavior.

This is fixed in the attached patch.
