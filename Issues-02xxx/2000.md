BOOM!


This is a bug.  Fortunately, there is an easy workaround (see below). 
Don't put PolynomialRing(CC, 1); instead put PolynomialRing(CC).

sage: R.<z> = PolynomialRing(CC)
sage: f = z^4 - 6*z + 3
sage: f.factor()
(1.00000000000000*z - 1.60443920904349) * (1.00000000000000*z - 0.511399619393097) * (1.00000000000000*z + 1.05791941421830 - 1.59281852704435*I) * (1.00000000000000*z + 1.05791941421830 + 1.59281852704435*I)

The problem is that PolynomialRing(CC,1) creates a *multivariate polynomial ring*
which happens to be in 1 variable, whereas PolynomialRing(CC) creates a 
univariate polynomial ring (which is implemented under the hood differently
than a multivariate polynomial ring).

The bug is that PolynomialRing(CC,1) should create a univariate ring,
whereas MPolynomialRing(CC,1) should be how one creates a multivariate
poly ring in 1 variable.   (I think.)

Alternatively, the bug is that factoring a multivariate polynomial in 1 variable
uses Singular instead of other better univariate code that we have.

Since MPolynomialRing is deprecated now, the reported behavior is indeed the correct behavior.

This is fixed in the attached patch.
