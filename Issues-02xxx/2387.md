Create a `_sage_init_` function that behaves like the `_maxima_init_`, `_magma_init_`, etc., functions which returns a string sufficient to construct the given object in Sage.

For example:

```
sage: a=matrix([[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]])
sage: a._sage_init_
'matrix([[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]])'
```

<div id="comment:2" align="right">comment:2</div>

I've posted a stab at it by searching for `_magma_init_` functions and implementing `_sage_init_` next to it for most cases.

How should we deal with:

```
sage: R.<y>=ZZ[]                                           
sage: a=matrix(R, [[y,1],[1,y^2]])                         
sage: a._sage_init_()                                      
"matrix(PolynomialRing(ZZ, 'y'), [[y, 1], [1, y^2]])"
```

The string returned will not construct the object usually since y is not a variable in a new session.  However, putting in the parent of y would make things much uglier.  How would you handle this situation?

I don't think it is possible without changing _sage_init_'s protocol
as suggested by carl witty (either allow a sequence of semicolon separated statements or have two blocks, an initialization block and a eval block).  I think I prefer the latter solution, since it can be used to do the former and more, but not conversely.
