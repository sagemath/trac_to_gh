Defined parent of a group homomorphism such that the following example
works (and similar for permutation groups):

```
sage: G.<x,y> = AbelianGroup(2,[2,3]); G 
Multiplicative Abelian Group isomorphic to C2 x C3
sage: H.<a,b,c> = AbelianGroup(3,[2,3,4]); H
Multiplicative Abelian Group isomorphic to C2 x C3 x C4
sage: phi = AbelianGroupMorphism(G,H,[x,y],[a,b])
sage: phi

AbelianGroup morphism:
  From: Multiplicative Abelian Group isomorphic to C2 x C3
  To:   Multiplicative Abelian Group isomorphic to C2 x C3 x C4
sage: phi.parent()
Set of Morphisms from Multiplicative Abelian Group isomorphic to C2 x C3 to Multiplicative Abelian Group isomorphic to C2 x C3 x C4 in Category of groups
sage: Hom(G,H) == phi.parent()
True
```

Apply aa5061b07eef.  Documentation and tests are fantastic!

45b75671c677 and 25e03ebc5b0d appear to be the same.  Whether it should be applied... I say yes, but I'm worried that it will fail on infinite domains.

02e052cfe50a should be applied, although I don't like leaving commented code around.

#1840 is aa5061b07eef.

#1893 is 45b75671c677 and 25e03ebc5b0d.

So the only new patch is 02e052cfe50a.
