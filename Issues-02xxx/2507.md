I **really** like that someone sat down to write doctests for `quotient_ring_element.py`, but I see some issues:

```
sage: Q = ZZ.quotient(10*ZZ)
sage: type(Q)
<class 'sage.rings.integer_mod_ring.IntegerModRing_generic'>
sage: type(Q.gen())
<type 'sage.rings.integer_mod.IntegerMod_int'>
```

and

```
sage: R.<a> = QuotientRing(QQ[x], x^2 + 1)
sage: type(R)
<class 'sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_quotient_ring.PolynomialQuotientRing_field'>
sage: type(a)
<class 'sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_quotient_ring_element.PolynomialQuotientRingElement'>
```

Thus, the documentation doesn't actually illustrate the class. AFAIK this class is mainly useful/used for multivariate polynomial rings. This theory reinforced by the `lm()` and `monomials()` methods. This class is just a mess, maybe?

First, two trivial issues with the patch `trac_2507.patch`. The double colon on line 48 is not indented properly. It should be aligned with the double colon on line 53. Also, the docstring for `_div_` is a bit confusing due to excessive use of the word "quotient". The word "quotient" as used in

```
263	        Quotient of quotient ring element ``self`` by another quotient ring 
264	        element, ``right``. If the quotient is `R/I`, the division is 
265	        carried out in `R` and then reduced to `R/I`.
```
has two meanings: to denote division of one element by another; and to mean a quotient ring. When division is intended, I think "division" should be used instead of quotient. So line 263 of the docstring can be changed as follows to avoid confusion/ambiguity:

```
263	        Division of quotient ring element ``self`` by another quotient ring 
264	        element, ``right``. If the quotient is `R/I`, the division is 
265	        carried out in `R` and then reduced to `R/I`.
```
The other issue is that in the constructor signature

```
77	    def __init__(self, parent, rep, reduce=True):
```
the input are not documented. My knowledge of quotient rings is pretty limited, and it can be difficult to work out what each of the arguments `parent`, `rep` and `reduce=True` means, and how to use them properly.
