Chris,

please make sure that you properly mark tickets with doctests added. Otherwise we cannot find them since attaching patches does not trigger an email to sage-trac.

<a id='comment:5'></a>I **really** like that someone sat down to write doctests for `quotient_ring_element.py`, but I see some issues:

```
sage: Q = ZZ.quotient(10*ZZ)
sage: type(Q)
<class 'sage.rings.integer_mod_ring.IntegerModRing_generic'>
sage: type(Q.gen())
<type 'sage.rings.integer_mod.IntegerMod_int'>
```

and

```
sage: R.<a> = QuotientRing(QQ[x], x^2 + 1)
sage: type(R)
<class 'sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_quotient_ring.PolynomialQuotientRing_field'>
sage: type(a)
<class 'sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_quotient_ring_element.PolynomialQuotientRingElement'>
```

Thus, the documentation doesn't actually illustrate the class. AFAIK this class is mainly useful/used for multivariate polynomial rings. This theory reinforced by the `lm()` and `monomials()` methods. This class is just a mess, maybe?
