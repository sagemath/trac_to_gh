This is a companion to #2409

```
sage: parametric_plot((t^2,t),-12,12)
```
works as expected, but 

```
sage: parametric_plot((1,t),-12,12)
...
<type 'exceptions.TypeError'>: 'float' object is unsubscriptable
```
does not.

More generally, I would like to see the following syntax supported 

```
sage: parametric_plot((1,t),(t,-12,12))
```
which is much cleaner mathematically (no hidden reliance on variable name 't') and is also very analogous to 

```
sage: plot(t,(t,-12,12))
```

<a id='comment:2'>**Comment 2:**</a>
For reference:

parametric_plot3d automatically calls fast_float on its arguments correctly, so parametric_plot3d((1,t,2), (t,-1,3)), for example, just works.

Why are we not calling fast_float on functions in plot() or parametric_plot?  Probably because noone has had time to implement it; contour plots and vector plots both do it.  I'll open a new ticket.

Here, I'll post a patch which corrects a bug in how exceptions are handled in plot.  Currently, the TypeError that is being triggered is then ignored when plot tries to access the non-existent data point (the data[i][1] line).  This changes the error in this case from a nonsensical indexing error to a sensible "Can't call an Integer" error (from trying to evaluate 1(-12).
