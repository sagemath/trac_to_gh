It would be nice if the following worked, if f was a function:

```
sage: integrate(f, x)

sage: # Double indefinite integral wrt x
sage: integrate(f, x, x)

sage: # limits and a double integral: x is the inner integral, y is the outer integral (note that this order is backwards from Mma...they think of nested integrals as int dx int dy function, so the first parameter is the outer integral in Mma.)
sage: integrate(f, (x, 0, 1), (y, 1, 2))
sage: integrate(f, (x, 0, y), (y, 1, 2))

sage: # Double integral, x is the inner integral, y is the outer integral
sage: integrate(f, x, y)
```

What do you propose to do about the following case:

```
# Current behavior, definite integral with x and y as bounds
sage: var('x,y')
sage: integrate(x^2,x,x,y)
y^3/3 - x^3/3

# Triple Integral, twice with respect to x, once with respect to y
sage: integrate(x^2,x,x,y)
x^4*y/12

# i.e. same as

I would say that deprecating `integral(f(x),x,a,b)` for a definite integral will be too large a backward incompatible change to pull of.

The gain for multiple integrals is also a little tricky: The proposed order for integral(f(x,y),x,y) where x is inner and y is outer is definitely consistent with mathematical notation `int int f(x,y) dx dy` but it's opposite to python's iteration order `[ (i,j) for i in range(3) for j in range(3) ]`, where j iterates in the inner loop.

Also, the proposed notation is for multiple integrals, which in mathematics are usually written as multiple (nested) integrals anyway. Single integral notation is usually reserved for higher dimensional integrals (Lebesgue, usually), in which case no particular "integration order" is implies, and indeed the domain of integration might not allow for a direct translation into nested integrals.
