It is a shame that normal arithmetic for polys over GF(2) still seems
to be implemented by the ntl ZZ_pX library, which is usually at least
10 times slower than GF2X,  up to degree 2<sup>17</sup> anyway. In that range
GF2X matches the speed of magma.

This is related to #4302, and will probably be fixed with #4302, thus might be marked as
duplicate of #4302.
