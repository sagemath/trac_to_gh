It would be nice to shorten the menu quite a bit and pick the options that make sense to us.

See http://chemapps.stolaf.edu/jmol/docs/examples-11/new4.htm point 13 for how to do this.

The spkg is **not** based in the latest jmol.spkg in tree and is missing fixes to spkg-install. Bad Jason :)

Timothy: **always** check the repo and verify that it is based on the previous spkg.
