Hi,

Here's something unpleasant that occurs in sage-3.0.rc0:

```
sage: wronskian(1, e^(-x), e^(2*x))
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
<type 'exceptions.AttributeError'>        Traceback (most recent call last)

     81             # .derivative on everything 
     82             fs = args
     83             row = lambda n: map(lambda f: f.derivative(n), fs)
---> 84         return matrix(map(row, range(len(fs)))).determinant()

     84         return matrix(map(row, range(len(fs)))).determinant()

```

There is an easy fix, see the patch.  I have also removed "differentiate" as an alias for "derivative", since I seem to remember that the consensus on sage-devel was to keep only "derivative" and "diff".
