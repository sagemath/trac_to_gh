Review:

1. I like all the tests and docs you have added, with one possible exception.  Your comment concerning the gcd functions talks about gcds in QQ, saying that they exist since QQ is trivially a PID.  There is some confusion here.  If you treat QQ as a ring, then gcd(a,b) should be 1 for all a,b in QQ (except a=b=0) since the ideal they generate is the unit ideal.  But this is not what gcd(a,b) actually does for a,b in QQ:  it returns a generator for the Z-module generated by a and b (rather than the Q-module).

I suspect that this needs better documentation.  As it stands, it is certainly confusing.

2. I'll have a go at doctesting the remaining functions.

The extra patches and clarifications look good, with one very small exception:  ZZ.gens() returns a tuple of length 1, not 2!

```
sage: ZZ.gens()
(1,)
sage: len(ZZ.gens())
1
```

It's just that Python displays 1-tuples with a trailing comma.
