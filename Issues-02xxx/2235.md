Combining # long with # 32-bit / # 64-bit seems to completely ignore the # long directive.

There's a long doctest in sage/rings/number_field/totallyreal_rel.py that is what caused me to notice this; I've made that a # no doctest for now, because it was causing timeouts on some machines. When this bug is fixed, that needs to be changed into a # long. 

Depends on #12415
