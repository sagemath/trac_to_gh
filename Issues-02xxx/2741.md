This is not implemented.  I wish you would implement it  :-) 

Robert Bradshaw might have some useful advise.

Well, he already answered my question in the source.

In sage/sage/plot/plot3d/index_set.pyx, starting at line 658 (in 2.10.4):

```
        # If we wanted to turn on display of the mesh lines or dots
        # we would uncomment thse.  This should be determined by
        # render_params, probably. 
        #s += '\npmesh %s mesh\n'%name
        #s += '\npmesh %s dots\n'%name
```

Uncommenting the appropriate line does indeed give a mesh in JMOL.  So now the question is how to expose this to the user.  And how to extend it to do nontrivial mesh functions.
