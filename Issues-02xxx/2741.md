This is not implemented.  I wish you would implement it  :-) 

Robert Bradshaw might have some useful advise.

Well, he already answered my question in the source.

In sage/sage/plot/plot3d/index_set.pyx, starting at line 658 (in 2.10.4):

```
        # If we wanted to turn on display of the mesh lines or dots
        # we would uncomment thse.  This should be determined by
        # render_params, probably. 
        #s += '\npmesh %s mesh\n'%name
        #s += '\npmesh %s dots\n'%name
```

Uncommenting the appropriate line does indeed give a mesh in JMOL.  So now the question is how to expose this to the user.  And how to extend it to do nontrivial mesh functions.

Timothy's patch looks good to me. Somebody didn't doctest his own patch ;)
