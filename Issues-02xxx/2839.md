The patch also includes a speed up for change of bases over QQ.

Before:

```
sage: time s(p(s([17,11])))
CPU times: user 1252.31 s, sys: 8.24 s, total: 1260.55 s
Wall time: 1259.90
s[17, 11]
sage: time a = s([10,10]).itensor(s([10,10]))
CPU times: user 30.87 s, sys: 0.21 s, total: 31.09 s
Wall time: 31.09
```

After:

```
sage: time s(p(s([17,11])))
CPU times: user 257.11 s, sys: 0.03 s, total: 257.14 s
Wall time: 257.15
s[17, 11]
sage: time a = s([10,10]).itensor(s([10,10]))
CPU times: user 3.60 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 3.60 s
Wall time: 3.60
```
