We should be able to somehow get a printout of a matrix that is suitable for pasting into an input cell.

I think that is what repr is supposed to do.  Currently, repr is the same as str, which seems like a bug considering the python convention.

Component: **porting: Cygwin**

SAGE blatantly and *systematically* does not follow that Python convention.

I am happy if we implement systematically a method `_input_form_`  (say -- after Mathematica's well chosen named InputForm) for objects which returns -- if possible (sometimes it isn't!) -- an expression that sage_evals to that object.  

Discuss!
