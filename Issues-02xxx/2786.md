I have made an spkg for `zn_poly` 0.8, please see attached.

Currently spkg-install runs a test suite (about 10 minutes). This should be disabled in the deployed version. I wasn't quite sure of the right way to do that.

It may or may not be necessary to touch files in the sage library that depend on `zn_poly` and rebuild:

```
touch devel/sage/sage/schemes/hyperelliptic_curves/hypellfrob.pyx
touch devel/sage/sage/schemes/hyperelliptic_curves/hypellfrob/*.cpp
```

So far I have positive build/tune/test reports from mhansen (Ubuntu Gutsy, 64-bit), wstein (osx 10.5.2), ddrake (Ubuntu Hardy, 32 bit), and myself (intel 64 mac OSX 10.4.11, ppc 64 mac OSX 10.4.11, AMD64 linux).

David,

the spkg looks food and builds fine. Numerous other people in IRC have confirmed that it builds for them, too. But: While the tuning phase is quick it seems that the spkg linked above runs integrity tests which took an extra eleven minutes of cputime on sage.math. While I think this is a good idea for 3.0.alphaX I would recommend that you turn that off before the final release of 3.0. Positive review.

Cheers,

Michael

Of course... I believe I already mentioned this above :-)

Question: is there any standardised way to put in test suites like that which run only in alpha releases?

Maybe we should add spkg-check-alpha, but that would increase build times across the board. Another possibility would be to run spkg-check depending on version number. We should take that over to sage-devel.\n\nCheers,\n\nMichael",
