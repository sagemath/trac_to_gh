The matrix eigenspaces() function is broken for rings over SR since the algorithm iterates over factors of the characteristic polynomial. "for e,f in mat.charpoly().factor()" works for matrices over polynomial rings, but not over the symbolic ring.  This is also brought up in #2021.

Data:

```
sage: a=matrix(SR,[[1,2],[3,4]])
sage: b=matrix(QQ,[[1,2],[3,4]])
sage: [i for i in a.fcp()]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
<type 'exceptions.TypeError'>             Traceback (most recent call last)

/home/grout/sage/devel/sage-main/sage/matrix/<ipython console> in <module>()

<type 'exceptions.TypeError'>: 'SymbolicArithmetic' object is not iterable
sage: [i for i in b.fcp()]
[(x^2 - 5*x - 2, 1)]
```

and 

```
sage: a=matrix(SR,[[1,2],[3,4]])
sage: [i for i in a.fcp().factor_list()]
[(x^2 - 5*x - 2, 1)]
```

So apparently we need to somehow call factor_list() when we have a symbolic matrix or we need to change SymbolicArithmetic? to iterate through factor_list() when we ask for an iterator.  I don't know which is better.  Comments?

<a id='comment:6'></a>I really don't think Factorization should not about SymbolicConstant at all.

Also, the doctests don't actually test a repeated factor, which would test the second set of failures.

So this should not be applied yet, if at all.
