sage -t  devel/sage-main/sage/misc/sageinspect.py           **********************************************************************
File "sageinspect.py", line 412:
    sage: sage_getdef(sage.rings.integer.Integer.factor, obj_name='factor')
Expected:
    "factor(algorithm='pari', proof='True')"
Got:
    "factor(algorithm='pari', proof='True', limit='None')"
**********************************************************************
1 items had failures:
   1 of  24 in __main__.example_10
***Test Failed*** 1 failures.

```

FIX -- just change the doctest -- this makes perfect sense.
(I added a new limit option to factor). 

Component: **doctest coverage**
