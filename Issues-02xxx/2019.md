There is a serious problem with gap_packages-4.4.10_3.

If this package is not installed then

sage: C = RandomLinearCode(10, 3,GF(2))
sage: Cd = C.dual_code()

works fine. Otherwise, you get the following error (which is not
fixed by gap_reset_workspace() and has been verified on 
an ubuntu machine and an intel macbook):

This is not a fix but a work-around:
If you create a clone then the problem goes away!

Here seems to be the solution, which makes the above problem go away: 

(1) in SAGE, run gap_reset_workspace()
(2) quit SAGE
(3) restart SAGE.

I don't know how to add this to the spkg-install script or even if that is the 
type of command one wants added to that. Maybe it should be added to sage-spkg??

I tried (1)+(2) before reporting the problem to trac in the first place but 
forgot to add step (3).

Possibly this is a bug in the version of guava included in gap_packages* ??
In any case, I prepared a new gap_packages* tarball with a few updated packages,
including a new version of guava. It is at
http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/wdj/patches/gap_packages-4.4.10_4.spkg
Seems to work fine but I am running sage -testall now and will report any problems.
However, even with this new package, you must do (1)+(2)+(3) after installing.

This seems to emphasize in my mind the need to write the guava functions in native 
Python as much as possible.

Fortunately there is now a simple solution to this problem.

From spkg-install do

```
touch "$SAGE_LOCAL"/bin/gap_stamp
```

Then any user who starts sage will automatically have their gap workspace reset.
Any time any spkg install gap stuff, it is supposed to touch the above file.

That did it- thanks!

I am uploading right now a new version of
http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/wdj/patches/gap_packages-4.4.10_4.spkg
which has this command added to spkg-install

Thanks again William.
