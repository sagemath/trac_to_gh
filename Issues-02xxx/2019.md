There is a serious problem with gap_packages-4.4.10_3.

If this package is not installed then

sage: C = RandomLinearCode(10, 3,GF(2))
sage: Cd = C.dual_code()

works fine. Otherwise, you get the following error (which is not
fixed by gap_reset_workspace() and has been verified on 
an ubuntu machine and an intel macbook):

Here seems to be the solution, which makes the above problem go away: 

(1) in SAGE, run gap_reset_workspace()
(2) quit SAGE
(3) restart SAGE.

I don't know how to add this to the spkg-install script or even if that is the 
type of command one wants added to that. Maybe it should be added to sage-spkg??

I tried (1)+(2) before reporting the problem to trac in the first place but 
forgot to add step (3).

Possibly this is a bug in the version of guava included in gap_packages* ??
In any case, I prepared a new gap_packages* tarball with a few updated packages,
including a new version of guava. It is at
http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/wdj/patches/gap_packages-4.4.10_4.spkg
Seems to work fine but I am running sage -testall now and will report any problems.
However, even with this new package, you must do (1)+(2)+(3) after installing.

This seems to emphasize in my mind the need to write the guava functions in native 
Python as much as possible.

Fortunately there is now a simple solution to this problem.

From spkg-install do

```
touch "$SAGE_LOCAL"/bin/gap_stamp
```

Then any user who starts sage will automatically have their gap workspace reset.
Any time any spkg install gap stuff, it is supposed to touch the above file.
