BipartiteGraph.__init__ does not call the base class `__init__` for some inputs, leaving the object unusable.  For example, 

```
sage: B = BipartiteGraph(None)
sage: B
```
will throw an exception because the base class attributes have not been initialized.  The attached patch ensures the base class `__init__` is called.

Some notes:

1. "TESTS" should actually be labeled "EXAMPLE" or "EXAMPLES". This is just the convention.

2. Comments in the examples don't need "#"; see many other doctests for examples of the formatting.

3. I've moved the networkx import further down so it only happens if it needs to. This import, if it hasn't been done before, takes several seconds... (I know this doesn't seem to make much sense now, but soon we won't be importing networkx by default whenever we have a graph, so it will make sense eventually.)
