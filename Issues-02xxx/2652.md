Requested by jpviiva on #sage-devel...

This could be a new keystroke (Control-Enter perhaps?) that evaluates the current cell without moving the cursor to the next block.  Another possibility (probably less desirable) is to fix it so that if you evaluate a cell, then press backspace, you end up at the same cursor location instead of at the beginning of the block.

**Upstream:** Reported upstream. Developers acknowledge bug.
