For various reasons, ease of maintenance among others, the coding theory functions in SAGE which are GAP wrappers for GUAVA functions will be moved over to pure Python/SAGE. This is just a "first installment". In this patch (to be attached once the testall suite is completed)

HammingCode, CyclicCode, dual_code, put_standard_form,

are moved over and the simple function LinearCodeFromCheckMatrix is added.
The amusing utility function "permutation_action" is needed, which provides a
(left) action of SymmetricGroup(n) on a list/vector/sequence/matrix of
length n.

**Assignee:** @rlmill

linear_code.py (rewrote standard_form and dual_code in python, so they do not call GAP)
guava.py (deleted HammingCode and CyclicCode)

I would also plead you once more to use the export command, if needed via the command line, i.e. `hg export $CHANGESET` because there are clearly some issues with the way you do bundle :(

I just figured out how to export a doc bundle to a patch. It's actually obvious and easy, so I don't know what the problem was before. It is attached too. 

Can you tell me if these are acceptable or if they need to be redone?

The patch looks good and does apply cleanly against my 2.10.3.alpha0. That isn't a formal review, just a technical observation. The reason the bundle is so large because William hasn't pushed out the changes from 2.10.2 to the repos and it contains every commit from 2.10.1 onward. So in the end it is all William's fault :)

To export the doc patch go into `$SAGE_ROOT/devel/doc` and us hg to do an `hg export tip` (at least for the last commit). You can do the same using Sage's hg interface to the doc repo, i.e. do `hg_doc.log()` to see the changelog.

I can now see that we crossed paths while I wrote the answer to your initial question. Both patches look correct and apply cleanly against my current repo. So once they get positively reviewed (by rlm?) they can go in.
