```
For various reasons, ease of maintenance among others, the coding theory functions in SAGE which are GAP wrappers for GUAVA functions will be moved over to pure Python/SAGE. This is just a "first installment". In this patch (to be attached once the testall suite is completed)

HammingCode, CyclicCode, dual_code, put_standard_form,

are moved over and the simple function LinearCodeFromCheckMatrix is added.
The amusing utility function "permutation_action" is needed, which provides a
(left) action of SymmetricGroup(n) on a list/vector/sequence/matrix of
length n.

Component: **coding theory**

Modified were the files

guava.py (deleted HammingCode and CyclicCode)
