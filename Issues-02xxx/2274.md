For various reasons, ease of maintenance among others, the coding theory functions in SAGE which are GAP wrappers for GUAVA functions will be moved over to pure Python/SAGE. This is just a "first installment". In this patch (to be attached once the testall suite is completed)

HammingCode, CyclicCode, dual_code, put_standard_form,

are moved over and the simple function LinearCodeFromCheckMatrix is added.
The amusing utility function "permutation_action" is needed, which provides a
(left) action of SymmetricGroup(n) on a list/vector/sequence/matrix of
length n.

Assignee: @rlmill

Resolution: fixed

I would also plead you once more to use the export command, if needed via the command line, i.e. `hg export $CHANGESET` because there are clearly some issues with the way you do bundle :(

I can now see that we crossed paths while I wrote the answer to your initial question. Both patches look correct and apply cleanly against my current repo. So once they get positively reviewed (by rlm?) they can go in.
