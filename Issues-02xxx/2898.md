Yep.  I think it's just a NotImplementedError.  Please implement it
and post a patch.  Make sure that it only succeeds if

   Integer(k(a)) == a

and otherwise fails.  I.e., Integer(k(a)) should *not* truncate k(a).

Unfortunately, this patch gives:

```
sage: 1.0r/8
1/8
```
which is IMHO unacceptable.

I think that the bug is actually in the coercion framework, rather than in this patch; so I've opened a new issue for that bug at #3938.  Once it is fixed, then we can revisit this patch.

Hi Robert,

so if I understand you correctly this patch here should not be merged since it fixes a symptom and not the root cause.

I'm confused by the real_mpfr.pyx part of the fixups patch.  I can't find the misspelling "cannonical" anywhere in that directory in sage-3.3alpha2.

The real_mpfr.pyx part of the fixups patch should be deleted-mabshoff corrected the typo when merging #3938.

Doctests pass in all files touched by the fixups patch.  I'd like someone else to look at the code it touches in free_modules.pyx and verify the changes there.  Other than that, this looks good to me.
