```
This causes an error in the coercion system:

```
sage: R.<q>=QQ[]
sage: L.<x,y,z> = LaurentPolynomialRing(R)
sage: f=(x+y+z^-1)^2
sage: f.substitute(z=1)
```
This is because the coefficients of `f` (which has `L` as its parent) do not lie in `R`, but in its fraction field, due to the `z^-1` and the way `__pow__()` is implemented.


Component: **algebra**

It seems that David's patch is not the right solution, so can someone come up with a better patch?

<div id="comment:9" align="right">comment:9</div>

It seems the underlying problem is that `LaurentPolynomial_mpair.__pow__()` can return Laurent polynomials whose coefficients do not lie in its base ring, but in its fraction field:

```
sage: R.<q>=QQ[]
sage: L.<x,y,z> = LaurentPolynomialRing(R)
sage: g=z^-1
sage: parent(g)
Multivariate Laurent Polynomial Ring in x, y, z over Univariate Polynomial Ring in q over Rational Field
sage: parent(g.coefficients()[0])
Fraction Field of Univariate Polynomial Ring in q over Rational Field
```
The last line should simply be `Univariate ...`

A slightly unrelated note: `z^-1` still lies in `L` (ignoring this bug), but `1/z` and `~z` return elements of the fraction field of `L`.
