In matrix2.pyx under eigenspaces():

```
        Next we compute the eigenspaces over the finite field
        of order 11:
        
            sage: # A = ModularSymbols(43, base_ring=GF(11), sign=1).T(2).matrix()
            sage: A = matrix(QQ, 4, [3, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 1, 0, 10, 9, 2, 0, 9, 0, 2])
```

It seems like the description should be deleted or the doctest should be run and the output included.

okay, now I've messed all the attachments up.  What I mean is that the third patch "eigenspace-docs.2.patch" includes the first patch and the second patch, and so is the only patch that needs applying.  William deserves credit for the first patch, though.
