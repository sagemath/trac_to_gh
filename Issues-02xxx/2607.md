This was reported by Dean Moore on sage-support.  Consider:

```
sage: f(x) = -x*sin(x^2)
sage: f.find_minimum_on_interval(-2.5, 2)
(-1.3076194129914434, 1.35521114057)
sage: f.find_minimum_on_interval(-2.5, -1)
(-2.1827697846777219, -2.19450274985)
```

So find_minimum_on_interval() returns a local minimum as opposed to the global one.  (The same issue applies to find_maximum_on_interval.)  This is due to the fact that the function wraps scipy.optimize.fminbound, which is only a local optimizer (Carl Witty pointed this out).  We should instead use one of the global optimizers, i.e. scipy.optimize.anneal or scipy.optimize.brute.

(-0.38490017945975047, 0.57735026913115706)

Answering the question first...

Sure, but it would be nice if we at least got the 'right' answer for 'easy' functions.  That's all I'm looking for here, not things like finding a minimum on a set of measure zero...

---


I think we can fix Brent to use this.  Compare:

```
sage: optimize.fminbound(h._fast_float_(x),0,6,full_output=True)
(3.8298366870225147, -1.327181022449951, 0, 10)
sage: optimize.fminbound(h._fast_float_(x),0,3,full_output=True)
(0.86667541098916612, -2.7358151040622416, 0, 9)
sage: optimize.brent(h._fast_float_(x),brack=(0,6),full_output=True)
(0.86667608708813437, -2.73581510406422, 11, 12)
```
This shows that brent does give the 'right' answer in this case.   So when does it give a 'wrong' answer?

```
sage: j(x) = sin(x)
sage: optimize.brent(j._fast_float_(x),brack=(0,6),full_output=True)
(10.995574367047061, -0.99999999999999689, 10, 11)
sage: 3.5*pi.n()
10.9955742875643
```
Well, of course - there IS no calculus-style minimum of sin between 0 and pi!  Only a minimum relative to the interval itself.  Interesting that it goes all the way to 7/2*pi, rather than 3/2*pi, but oh well!

So the fix is to switch to Brent, and then if it gives an answer outside the interval, pick the 'lower' endpoint.  This would need lots of testing with well-behaved functions to make sure they actually work correctly.

Here's another example where `brent` does better.

```
sage: j(x) = sin(x^8)-.1*x
sage: optimize.brent(j._fast_float_(x),brack=(0,2),full_output=True)

Of course, this does cause problems for my supposed algorithm to then go back to an endpoint, since it's *just* outside of it...

I just ran into this bug with the following input:

```
   find_maximum_on_interval(fast_float(8*e^(-x)*sin(x) - 1, x), 0, 8)
    (1.5791755355586754, 0.78539817769603915)

    find_maximum_on_interval(fast_float(8*e^(-x)*sin(x) - 1, x), 0, 9)
    (-0.9951835373923219, 7.0685835435476418)
```
...and was truly surprised that `find_maximum_on_interval` is not monotonic (in the sense that a bigger interval should always give a (weakly) bigger maximum)!

At the VERY LEAST, we should fix the documentation to specify that this finds *local* extrema, and perhaps change the name of the function, too, since it does *not* always find the actual maximum value on the interval!

Note that one strange workaround is to simply plot the function; something like:

```
def find_maximum_on_interval(f, a, b):
    return plot(f, a, b).ymax()
```
seems like it would be pretty effective, despite being inelegant and crude!

However, no one is offerring a fix to the code; it looks like we are going to change the documentation, and then later fix the actual function. This will require two tickets. We could use this ticket for the documentation and a new ticket for the code, or vice versa. We can change the description of this ticket if we want.\n\nThe exact way we do this doesn't seem very important to me, as long as we fix the documentation and later fix the code.

> I'm not in favour of giving a positive review, since the proposed patch does not solve the problem described in the description of that ticket.


Fair enough. However, no one is offerring a fix to the code; it looks like we are going to change the documentation, and then later fix the actual function. This will require two tickets. We could use this ticket for the documentation and a new ticket for the code, or vice versa. We can change the description of this ticket if we want.

The exact way we do this doesn't seem very important to me, as long as we fix the documentation and later fix the code. If you would like to make a new ticket and move attachment:trac2607.patch and attachment:trac2607-whitespace.patch over, that's fine.

Attachment [trac2607-doctest-and-spacing.patch](tarball://root/attachments/some-uuid/ticket2607/trac2607-doctest-and-spacing.patch) by aginiewicz created at 2012-06-24 10:13:11

I added the commit message to whitespace patch and rebased renaming patch based on it (keeping original authors/dates, I did not wanted to claim their work and it was minor rebase only to accommodate the commit message taken from comment by Dan).

I also uploaded trac2607-doctest-and-spacing.patch, which adjusts doctest for numerical noise, fixes spacing to be more consistent (3 places, spaces between arguments - i.e. "0,5" looks very close to "0.5" instead of "0, 5") and changed "f.find_local_minimum(" to "find_local_minimum(f" - because after all this test occurs in definition of find_local_minimum function, not method.
