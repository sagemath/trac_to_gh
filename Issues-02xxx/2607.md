This was reported by Dean Moore on sage-support.  Consider:

```
sage: f(x) = -x*sin(x^2)
sage: f.find_minimum_on_interval(-2.5, 2)
(-1.3076194129914434, 1.35521114057)
sage: f.find_minimum_on_interval(-2.5, -1)
(-2.1827697846777219, -2.19450274985)
```

So find_minimum_on_interval() returns a local minimum as opposed to the global one.  (The same issue applies to find_maximum_on_interval.)  This is due to the fact that the function wraps scipy.optimize.fminbound, which is only a local optimizer (Carl Witty pointed this out).  We should instead use one of the global optimizers, i.e. scipy.optimize.anneal or scipy.optimize.brute.

#5960 was a dup.   Here are the examples from there.

sage: h.find_minimum_on_interval(0, 2*pi)
(-1.3271810224585345, 3.8298351449342838)
But there is another local minimum at h(0.8666760871050464) = -2.73581510406


sage: find_minimum_on_interval(x*(x-1)*(x+1), -2, 2)
(-0.38490017945975047, 0.57735026913115706)
The minimum on this interval is the endpoint h(-2) = 6.


sage: find_minimum_on_interval((x-2)*(x-1)*x*(x+1) - x, -2, 2)
(-0.43749999999999994, -0.49999999973911674)

but
sage: find_minimum_on_interval((x-2)*(x-1)*x*(x+1) - x, 0, 2)

Answering the question first...

Sure, but it would be nice if we at least got the 'right' answer for 'easy' functions.  That's all I'm looking for here, not things like finding a minimum on a set of measure zero...

---


I think we can fix Brent to use this.  Compare:

```
sage: optimize.fminbound(h._fast_float_(x),0,6,full_output=True)
(3.8298366870225147, -1.327181022449951, 0, 10)
sage: optimize.fminbound(h._fast_float_(x),0,3,full_output=True)
(0.86667541098916612, -2.7358151040622416, 0, 9)
sage: optimize.brent(h._fast_float_(x),brack=(0,6),full_output=True)
(0.86667608708813437, -2.73581510406422, 11, 12)
```
This shows that brent does give the 'right' answer in this case.   So when does it give a 'wrong' answer?

```
sage: j(x) = sin(x)
sage: optimize.brent(j._fast_float_(x),brack=(0,6),full_output=True)
(10.995574367047061, -0.99999999999999689, 10, 11)
sage: 3.5*pi.n()
10.9955742875643
```
Well, of course - there IS no calculus-style minimum of sin between 0 and pi!  Only a minimum relative to the interval itself.  Interesting that it goes all the way to 7/2*pi, rather than 3/2*pi, but oh well!

So the fix is to switch to Brent, and then if it gives an answer outside the interval, pick the 'lower' endpoint.  This would need lots of testing with well-behaved functions to make sure they actually work correctly.

Here's another example where `brent` does better.

```
sage: j(x) = sin(x^8)-.1*x
sage: optimize.brent(j._fast_float_(x),brack=(0,2),full_output=True)
(2.0000389609484905, -1.2000038913452364, 22, 23)
sage: optimize.fminbound(j._fast_float_(x),0,2,full_output=True)
(1.5288339777087034, -1.152883200877608, 0, 16)
```
Of course, this does cause problems for my supposed algorithm to then go back to an endpoint, since it's *just* outside of it...

I just ran into this bug with the following input:

```
   find_maximum_on_interval(fast_float(8*e^(-x)*sin(x) - 1, x), 0, 8)
    (1.5791755355586754, 0.78539817769603915)

    find_maximum_on_interval(fast_float(8*e^(-x)*sin(x) - 1, x), 0, 9)
    (-0.9951835373923219, 7.0685835435476418)
```
...and was truly surprised that `find_maximum_on_interval` is not monotonic (in the sense that a bigger interval should always give a (weakly) bigger maximum)!

At the VERY LEAST, we should fix the documentation to specify that this finds *local* extrema, and perhaps change the name of the function, too, since it does *not* always find the actual maximum value on the interval!

Note that one strange workaround is to simply plot the function; something like:

```
def find_maximum_on_interval(f, a, b):
    return plot(f, a, b).ymax()
```
seems like it would be pretty effective, despite being inelegant and crude!

Hmm, maybe Paul is suggesting we should use the new "system warning that you won't get what you think/mathematically correct result" in Sage whose name I forget?  Paul, the warning is just in the documentation, not the function itself.

Yes. Or simply ignored.

The warning is in the documentation, which isn't the best...but it's better than right now, where it's impossible to figure out without reading a lot of code. There will, of course, be a followup ticket that actually fixes the functionality.

However, no one is offerring a fix to the code; it looks like we are going to change the documentation, and then later fix the actual function. This will require two tickets.

I added the commit message to whitespace patch and rebased renaming patch based on it (keeping original authors/dates, I did not wanted to claim their work and it was minor rebase only to accommodate the commit message taken from comment by Dan).

I also uploaded trac2607-doctest-and-spacing.patch, which adjusts doctest for numerical noise, fixes spacing to be more consistent (3 places, spaces between arguments - i.e. "0,5" looks very close to "0.5" instead of "0, 5") and changed "f.find_local_minimum(" to "find_local_minimum(f" - because after all this test occurs in definition of find_local_minimum function, not method.
