This patch causes a doctest failure for me:

```
sage -t -long devel/sage/sage/matrix/matrix2.pyx

File "matrix2.pyx", line 1170:
    sage: A.right_nullity()
Expected:
    1
Got:
    0
**********************************************************************
1 items had failures:
   1 of   4 in __main__.example_26
***Test Failed*** 1 failures.
For whitespace errors, see the file .doctest_matrix2.pyx
