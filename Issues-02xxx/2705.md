Creating a 2000x2000 full matrix is much faster than creating a 500x500 sparse matrix:

```
sage: %time A = random_matrix(ZZ,2000)
CPU times: user 0.97 s, sys: 0.28 s, total: 1.25 s
Wall time: 1.25

sage: %time B = random_matrix(ZZ,500,sparse=True)
CPU times: user 7.20 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 7.20 s
Wall time: 7.20
```

Keywords: **sd31**

Component: **linear algebra**

could it have anything to do with the fact that a random matrix is not sparse in nature?

I noted that even when we specify the density of nonzero entries, a sparse matrix still takes a significant amount of time.

```
sage: time B = random_matrix(ZZ, 2000, density=.05, sparse=True)
Time: CPU 7.02 s, Wall: 8.77 s
sage: time A = random_matrix(ZZ 2000, density=.05, sparse=False)
Time: CPU 1.20 s, Wall: 1.70 s

Well...apparently density=.05 is too dense for a 2000x2000 matrix

```
sage: time A = random_matrix(QQ, 2000, density=.01, sparse=True)
Time: CPU 2.17 s, Wall: 2.82 s
sage: time A = random_matrix(QQ, 2000, density=.01, sparse=False)

However, sparse matrices in sage are in need of some tender loving care (according to some other sage devs)
