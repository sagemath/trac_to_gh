A major new version of twisted has been released and I strongly recommend that we upgrade to it for sage-3.0.  There are a ton of new features and many bug fixes. Some specifics that are relevant to dsage are:

- The reactor now has a blockingCallFromThread method for non-reactor threads
  to use to wait for a reactor-scheduled call to return a result (#1042, #3030)
- LoopingCall now allows you to specify the reactor to use to schedule new
  calls, allowing much better testing techniques (#2633, #2634)
- twisted.python.log now contains a Twisted log observer which can forward
  messages to the Python logging system (#1351)
- Log files now include seconds in the timestamps (#867)
- PB now supports anonymous login (#439, #2312)
- twisted.spread.jelly now supports decimal objects (#2920)
- twisted.spread.jelly now supports all forms of sets (#2958)

Also, this release is easy_install'able. I don't know if we ever use easy_install to install packages or what the thought on it is.
