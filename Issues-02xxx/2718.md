E.g., issues like this:

```
The athlon 32-bit linux box has the most files failing:
   http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/was/build/tests/2.11.alpha2/Linux-meccah.log

sage -t  devel/sage-main/sage/interfaces/psage.py
sage -t  devel/sage-main/sage/interfaces/sage0.py
sage -t  devel/sage-main/sage/dsage/tests/testdoc.py
sage -t  devel/sage-main/sage/calculus/calculus.py

Also tut.tex fails due to the timeout. 

We should raise the timeout, since calculus is a timeout issue, and
it should be possible to test Sage even on a mere 2.1Ghz machine.

I tested that the patch applies and doctesting still works; I did not explicitly test that the timeout changed.

Looks good.
