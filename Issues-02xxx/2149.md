By the way, wouldn't it be better to call it `PolynomialBooleanRing` instead of `BooleanPolynomialRing` I suggest this for two reasons: 
* It is `PolyBoRi`, after all, not `BoPolyRi`. 
* The other Sage polynomial ring(s) starts with "Polynomial"

By inspection only, the patch looks good. I assume it passes all the tests.

I am still not decided about this naming issue though. The arguments for renaming are not really valid.
- It's named `PolyBoRi` to make it easy to pronounce. All the literature on `PolyBoRi` talks about Boolean polynomials, see http://polybori.sourceforge.net/further.shtml.
- The class names should be easy to understand for humans, machines don't care what they are anyway. So why make them look machine like? `UnivariateRationalPolynomialRing` is more natural and easier to understand than `PolynomialRingUnivariateRational`.

If we agree that the original reasoning is correct, we should consider renaming `BooleanPolynomial` to `Polynomial_Boolean`, similarly for `BooleanMonomial` and `BooleanMonomialMonoid`. 

Note that none of these names are meant to be seen/used directly. AFAIK, the intention was to remove the `BooleanPolynomialRing` from the global scope, when it can be constructed with the usual methods.

BTW, to comply with current naming scheme, the new name should be `MPolynomial_something`.

It seem a pity for mhansen to have wasted his time, but that is not in itself a very strong argument!

[00:31] <mhansen> Or wontfix.
[00:31] <mabshoff> let me check in a minute
[00:31] <mhansen> Sure, no problem.
