After:

```

./jacobian_morphism.py
ERROR: Please define a s == loads(dumps(s)) doctest.
SCORE ./jacobian_morphism.py: 100% (17 of 17)

```

The final `s == loads(dumps(s))` requires lots of other fixes to happen first, so it could be a while.

Review:  this looks like an excellent job with a lot of useful explanations and examples.  I successfully applied the patch to 2.10.4.rc0.  Testing all files in sage/schemes/hyperelliptic/ resulted in one error:

That example is marked known failure and the relevant trac number (#2586) is beside it.  I am happier with a useful failing doctest than no doctest, or a useless doctest, or a doctest certifying bad output.

Thanks for the prompt review!

Nick, I changed the above lines to 

```
+            sage: print latex(Q + Q)
+            \left(x^{2} + 5x + 1, y + 3\alphax + 6\alpha + 2\right) # this is a bug - see trac #2586
```
Once #2586 is fixed the doctest will fail and I am sure the person will fix the doctest.

Cheers,

Michael
