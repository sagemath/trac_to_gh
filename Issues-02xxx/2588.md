The final `s == loads(dumps(s))` requires lots of other fixes to happen first, so it could be a while.

Review:  this looks like an excellent job with a lot of useful explanations and examples.  I successfully applied the patch to 2.10.4.rc0.  Testing all files in sage/schemes/hyperelliptic/ resulted in one error:

Once #2586 is fixed the doctest will fail and I am sure the person will fix the doctest.
