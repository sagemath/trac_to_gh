When I build eclib and singular for Debian, I get a bunch of errors from dpkg-shlibdeps.  When I build the sagemath package, I get countless pages of scrolling of this sort of error.  I should track down what's going on here.

These messages are intended to indicate unecessary -lblah flags, i.e. where we have a -lntl or whatever when linking the shared library, but the shared library doesn't directly use any of the symbols of ntl.  In newer dpkg the messages look like:

dpkg-shlibdeps: warning: dependency on libgmpxx.so.4 could be avoided if "debian/liblinbox0/usr/lib/liblinbox.so.0.0.0" were not uselessly linked against it (they use none of its symbols).
dpkg-shlibdeps: warning: dependency on libblas.so.3gf could be avoided if "debian/liblinbox0/usr/lib/liblinbox.so.0.0.0" were not uselessly linked against it (they use none of its symbols).


Since it seems that on other platforms one does need to link against all one's dependencies, not just one's direct dependencies (at least, I'm guessing this is what's going on; when we followed similar indications on genus2reduction it ended up breaking things on OS X), I'm not sure there's anything one should do about these.  Thus, I'm closing the ticket.
