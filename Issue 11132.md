Keywords: S-class groups

There are some serious problems at present with the code for S-class groups.  They only emerge when the class groups isÂ non-cyclic.  For example,

```
sage: K.<a> = QuadraticField(-105)
sage: C = K.class_group(); C
Class group of order 8 with structure C2 x C2 x C2 of Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^2 + 105
sage: S = (K.ideal(11, a + 7),)
sage: K.S_class_group(S)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
IndexError: Argument length (= 3) must be 2.
```
This problem arises when the class group and the S-class group have differing numbers of generators.  It arises essentially because generators of S-class groups are created as `FractionalIdealClass` elements rather than `SFractionalIdealClass` elements.

But there is a more serious problem.  The Pari data for the S-class group which we failed to construct above can be obtained as

```
sage: SC_data = K._S_class_group_and_units(S)[1]; SC_data
[(Fractional ideal (10, a + 5), 2, 10), (Fractional ideal (6, a + 3), 2, 6)]
```
so that if

```
sage: P, Q = [u[0] for u in SC_data]
```
the S-classes of the ideals `P` and `Q` (each of order 2) generate the S-class group.  However,

```
sage: P._S_ideal_class_log(S)
[0, 0]
```
which cannot be correct.

The patch rectifies the defects.  It also incorporates enhancements for both class groups and S-class groups.

In particular:

The computation of S-class groups is made faster when the ideals in S are all principal.

The computation of ideal_class_logs is speeded up by setting a pari flag.

The code for S-class groups is made more compatible with that for class groups.

As Robert doesn't seem to reply, do you want to give this a positive review, or have someone else review it too?

Let's give it a positive review, since I clearly thought it deserved that 5 weeks ago!
