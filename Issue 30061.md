We make the following changes to `sagelib`:
- remove the call to `sage.repl.ipython_kernel.install` from the installation steps done by sagelib's `setup.py` -- it is not compatible with modern python packaging methods anyway
- add a `console_script` that installs a kernel spec (using `sage.repl.ipython_kernel.install`), call it `sage-kernel` (interface similar to: https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install/kernel_install.html)
- Change `sage-notebook` (which implements `sage -n`) to a shell script that invokes the correct jupyter (from system if installed in system, from SAGE_LOCAL if installed there)

We call `sage-kernel` in `build/pkgs/sagelib/spkg-install` instead.

I think it gets linked in the help menu.

By the looks of it, the standard Python3 kernel populates that help menu with external links to the python website.

I suspect this locally hosted approach was taken to make sagemath more functional in offline settings (which do happen, particularly in more remote places where internet connections aren't so plentiful or are unreliable)

isn't copying/building the docs and optionally deleting the installation source the normal way to install software docs?

It's about the location. Sure, installing the docs `.../local/share/docs` is completely reasonable. That's an installed location, not a source or build location.

Installing the sagemath kernel in jupyter produces a link to it in `.../local/share/jupyter/kernels/sagemath`. That's a different location (and possibly in a different "local" tree: for instance, the first might be in `$SAGE_LOCAL` whereas the latter might be in `$HOME/.local` if someone decides to install the sagemath kernel for the system-jupyter but only for the one user.

Telling the standard jupyter install_kernel machinery to make `doc` available in the relevant `kernels/sagemath` would *copy* it; not symlink. From jupyter's perspective that's probably a reasonable thing and the most reliable, but it's not what we want, because we don't want two copies of the sage doc -- we probably want 0 or 1.

Other kernels do seem to make doclinks available in the help menu, but they are links to the actual documentation hosted by the project; so not a local copy.

It looks like a symlink was an easy solution to make the docs available to jupyter to serve without copying them over. But it seems that having a symlink in the `kernels/sagemath` directory is a little unusual from a jupyter perspective.

From #33855#comment:5:

  The kernel might also be missing in the wheels. Best to redo the kernelspec generation/installation similar to ​https://github.com/ipython/ipykernel/blob/main/setup.py#L108

  When building a wheel, the symlink `doc` must be omitted but the other files should be listed as `data_files`.
