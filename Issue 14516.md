Assignee: @aghitza

CC:  sage-combinat

Keywords: padé approximant, power series

It would be good to have Padé approximants for formal power series


```
sage: z = PowerSeriesRing(QQ, 'z').gen()
sage: pade(exp(z),4,0)      
1/24*z^4 + 1/6*z^3 + 1/2*z^2 + z + 1
sage: pade(exp(z),3,1)
(1/144*z^3 + 1/24*z^2 + 1/8*z + 1/6)/(-1/24*z + 1/6)
```


patch in preparation

Yes, the patchbot is wrong. But if you write "Padé" in the title of a Sage ticket then

- your ticket will not be tested
- the patchbot that tried to test your ticket will stop

I suggest to revert to the proper "Padé" after ticket #14707 has been fixed. Maybe you can help to get somebody interested in actually fixing it.

Hi Frédéric,

I had a look at your new version and started changing a few things in `u/mmezzarobba/14720-pade`, but I stopped midstream. (I'm intentionally not setting the ticket's branch field to my branch, because it is half-broken.)

Here are some remaining issues.

* The code does not work over `RR`:
  {{{
  sage: R.<z> = RR[[]]
  sage: f = exp(2*z)
  sage: f.pade(3,3)
  ...
  ValueError: variable names must be alphanumeric, but one is '0.000000000000000 + 1.00000000000000*z' which is not.
  }}}
  I fixed the `ValueError` by changing the definition of `polyring` to `self.parent()._poly_ring()`, but this is not enough: the degrees of the resulting polynomials are wrong due to round-off errors.
* The doc should mention how large the order of `self` needs to be (and/or the function should raise a meaningful error when it is too small).

I have added a truncation to the polynomials computed as determinants, in order to ensure they have the right degree. This probably means that the algorithm is not very well suited to handle the case of real coefficients, but, well, in the absence of another algorithm..
