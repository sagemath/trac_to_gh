As [reported before](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-notebook/browse_thread/thread/476cf49a8a66cc3c/1d1e8da9c01c40e4) static 3D plots are horrible if Sage Notebook is running with separate accounts for server and worker. If the ulimits for the worker are too tight (meaning < 5 GB!!! virtual memory), Tachyon is used to draw the static plot instead of jmol. Since sizes of lines/arrows and transparency are interpreted differently, the result is truly horrible. With enough memory available, the plots seem to be done by jmol, but there is permission issue preventing anything being shown apart from error messages.

"java -version" does not work for me unless I increase virtual memory limit above 4Gb.

The permission issue is with references to files which are stored in server directories closed to everybody except for the server. Trying to manually set group access bits does not help - they are reset on cell reexecution. I don't think there is anything wrong with jmol here and memory issue, while annoying, can be lived with. But permission errors don't go away even after using [Jason's patch](https://gist.github.com/3527075#file-patch-to-sagenb-patch) to make plots interactive by default (I see the plots and they are interactive, but somewhere there is still access to restricted files generating errors).
