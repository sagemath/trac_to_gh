This is closely related to #13545, but is not a duplicate.

It is possible to create a variable whose name is 'lambda' by bypassing the `SR.var()` function, which prohibits it.  However, this leads to crashes later, when that function is used internally:

```
sage: l = SR.symbol('lambda')
sage: l
lambda
sage: latex(l)
\lambda
sage: l^2
lambda^2
sage: solve( l^2, l )

```

If the reason for prohibiting this name is that it can't be used when `var()` creates a Python global variable, that prohibition should be enforced in `var()`, not in `SR.var()`.

`lambda` is a [reserved keyword](https://docs.python.org/2.7/reference/lexical_analysis.html#keywords) in Python, so just like `and` or `def` it shouldn't be used as a variable name.

I maybe agree. `SR.var` doesn't particularly inject a binding into a python scope, so it doesn't necessarily need to check whether things are python identifiers.

That said, for the sanity of the system it might be a good idea to make some checks on what kind of math symbols we allow. These things tend to end up in strings to various interfaces (although we wouldn't really need to do that for maxima, but we still do). It might even be that we end up "eval"-ing expressions in python, in which case python identifiers shouldn't be allowed.

Would it be helpful to relax the restriction and see if the tests fail?

Out of curiosity, how is "D[0](f)(x)" made into valid python syntax?

It already is: you don't get a syntax error if you type it into sage.

If you want to ensure it executes properly in addition to being valid syntax you have to bind D to an object that puts the information in the right places. I posted this example elsewhere but I can't locate it right now:

```
class Dclass(object):
  def __getitem__(self,a):
    if isinstance(a,tuple):
        L=[i for i in a]
    else:
        L=[a]
    def derivator(f):
        return sage.symbolic.operators.FDerivativeOperator(f,L)
    return derivator
D=Dclass()
```
With this binding, you get:

```
sage: D[0,0,0](sin)(x)
-cos(x)
```

**EDIT:** Found the original code (it's painful how google results now depend on which computer you use!) in
[this sage-devel discussion](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/xBHw11qUARg/0eqj3eUFsFkJ)

`@`kcrisman thanks, that's good to know.

`@`nbruin thanks - this seems to say that `SR` expressions can be parsed as python expressions but not `eval`ed, since this operator isn't defined in Sage as is.
