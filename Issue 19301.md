`@`stumpc5

- `x.parent().gens()` should return `x.parent()._gens` which is a tuple
  so the order should be fixed.

- `x.parent().gens()` and also `parent` are in general different, the
  whole purpose of this patch is to make sure that, when they differ, some
  natural coercion can still be implemented.

- I did not run precise tests but I expect the new version to be slower than the
  old one (maybe even significantly slower); the point though is that the
  current version is not working as it should. I could make a much faster
  function that returns some hardcoded nonsense but it would clearly not be the
  right function. More seriously I should run some benchmark, any idea on which?

`@`vdelecroix

I agree that the behaviour of `LaurentPolynomialRing` and that of
`PolynomialRing` should be the same. The point is that currently they are
not.

For example the same code in the ticket description evaluates to

```
sage: L = PolynomialRing(ZZ, 'x0,x1,x2,y0,y1,y2')
sage: P = PolynomialRing(ZZ, 'y0,y1,y2')
sage: P.inject_variables()
Defining y0, y1, y2
sage: y0 in L
True
sage: L = PolynomialRing(ZZ, 'x', 4)
sage: R = PolynomialRing(ZZ, 'x3,x2,t,s')
sage: R.inject_variables()
Defining x3, x2, t, s
sage: L(x3)
x0
sage: L(t)
x2
```

I do not know how to fix the first issue in the ticket description while leaving the second one as is. This patch just exchange one inconsistent behavior for another. Any Idea on how to deal with this in a more elegant/consistent/efficient way is extremely welcome.

Unless I did a mistake, the conversion rules are the same for `PolynomialRing` and `LaurentPolynomialRing` (but the semantic of the operation `in` is not as you noticed). The rules are as follows for a map `R -> S`:
1. if the variables of `R` are included in the variables of `S` then the map `R -> S` is given by names of variables
2. else if `R` has less or equal variables than `S`  then the map `R -> S` is given by the order of the variable
3. else if some variable of `R` are present in `S` then there is a partial map considered
4. otherwise an error is raised

```
sage: R1 = PolynomialRing(ZZ, 'x,y')
sage: R2 = PolynomialRing(ZZ, 'x,t')
sage: R3 = PolynomialRing(ZZ, 't,x')
sage: R4 = PolynomialRing(ZZ, 'x,t,y')
sage: map(R4, R1.gens()) # rule 1

sage: map(R1, R2.gens())  # rule 2

sage: R1(R4('t')) # rule 4
Traceback (most recent call last):

TypeError: Could not find a mapping of the passed element to this ring.
```
These rules should not change. You can have a look at the implementation of `_element_constructor_` for polynomial rings.

Is that behaviour what you expected?

I would say: "A map between two rings is always better than a partial map". Whatever you think it is how it works in Sage. If you want to change it you should ask more opinions on [sage-devel](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sage-devel).

One possibility would be to modify the rule 2 in the following form

2'. else if `R` has less or equal variables than `S` then the map `R -> S` is given by a mapping of the variables of `R` into `S` first trying to match names and then in variable order.

But as I said, the place to discuss it is sage-devel and not a ticket.

Dear All,

as requested by vdelecroix I posted a question on sage-devel about this issue;
Volker's reply was this:

```
   Let me try to summarize the expected behavior: If there is a coercion
   of the base rings, then there should be a coercion to the (laurent)
   polynomial ring with additional variables. The variables in the
   different rings are identified using their name (and not index in
   gens() or any other rule).Â
   sage: cm = get_coercion_model()
   sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
   sage: S.<x,t> = QQ[]
   sage: cm.explain(R, S, operator.add)
   Coercion on left operand via
       Conversion map:
         From: Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Rational Field
         To:   Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, t over Rational
   Field
   Arithmetic performed after coercions.
   Result lives in Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, t over Rational
   Field
   Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, t over Rational Field
   No coercion if variable names are not strict subsets:
   sage: T.<x,y> = QQ[]
   sage: cm.explain(T, S, operator.add)
   Unknown result parent.
   But explicit conversion can still work, e.g. by falling back to the
   index in gens():
   sage: T(S.gen(0))
   x
   sage: T(S.gen(1))
   y

```

Accordingly I modified this patch so that it only changes the old behaviour when trying to map a laurent polynomial `x` into a ring containing all the variables of `x.parent()`

After the patch the behaviour is 

```
sage: R = LaurentPolynomialRing(QQ,'x2,x0')
sage: S = LaurentPolynomialRing(QQ,'x',3)
sage: f = S.coerce_map_from(R)
sage: f(R.gen(0) + R.gen(1)^2)
x0^2 + x2
sage: T = LaurentPolynomialRing(QQ,'x2,x0,t')
sage: S.has_coerce_map_from(T)
False
sage: S(T.gen(0))
x0
```

Could you please test this?
