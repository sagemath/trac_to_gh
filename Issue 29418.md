With #29633, we now generate a full list of packages that Sage uses (with links to documentation - see #27495)
for the reference manual from information in `build/pkgs/*/SPKG.rst` (which used to be `SPKG.txt`).

The purpose of this ticket is to improve the `SPKG.rst` files. 

1. If other sources have better information than what is in `build/pkgs`, update `build/pkgs` accordingly. (See https://wiki.sagemath.org/SageWiki)

   - https://github.com/sagemath/website/blob/master/conf/packages.yaml (which is used for generating http://www.sagemath.org/links-components.html)
   - https://wiki.sagemath.org/spkg (another incomplete list of packages)
   - `src/doc/en/installation/standard_packages.rst` (yet another incomplete list of packages)

2. Delete/archive the obsolete other sources.
