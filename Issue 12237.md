```
g=Graph(multiedges=True)
g.allow_multiple_edges(False)
```


That's just confusing. "multiedges" is shorter: what about renaming allow_multiple_edges to allow_multiedges, allows_multiple_edges to allow_multiedges, ...? Deprecating period in this case should be long, of course.

If this matters, in `networkx` they use the `multiedges` variation.
