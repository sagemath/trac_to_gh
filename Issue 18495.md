CC:  @nathanncohen @yuan-zhou zwang @jdemeyer

Keywords: LP, glpk

Expose the GLPK functions glp_eval_tab_row, glp_eval_tab_col in Sage's GLPKBackend class.

See [GLPK manual](http://fossies.org/linux/glpk/doc/glpk.pdf), section 4.3 "Simplex tableau routines".

One needs these functions if one wants to implement tableau cutting planes such as Gomory's fractional cut.

Hello !

Could you allocate memory *after* raising an exception? Otherwise, those exceptions trigger memory leaks.

`sig_on` and `sig_off` should always appear in pairs, but perhaps you should use `sig_check` in this special case?
http://www.sagemath.org/documentation/html/en/developer/coding_in_cython.html#interrupt-and-signal-handling

Can you check that the pointers you allocate are not 'null'?

Bonjour Nathann,

Thanks for the reference! It says that `sig_str` behaves the same as `sig_on`. I just mimic the code in the `GLPKBackend.solve` and `GLPKBackend.row` methods.

Does one need to deallocate the memory if an Error is raised between `sig_on` and `sig_off`?

How to check that the pointers are not 'null'?

Yuan

with "if my_pointer == NULL" ?

```

+            raise MemoryError
```


This occurs twice.

`for 0 < j <= i:` is "old-style", you should use "for j in range(i)" instead, which is translated into the very same C code.

Finally, this piece of code had bad side-effects:


```
+        try:
+            sig_on()
+            i = glp_eval_tab_row(self.lp, k + 1, c_indices, c_values)
+            sig_off()
+        except Exception:
+            sage_free(c_indices)
+            sage_free(c_values)
+            raise MIPSolverException('GLPK : basis factorization does not exist')
```


Indeed, as it catches everything and only raises MIPSolverException, it can transform a KeyboardInterrupt into a "GLPK: basis factorization does not exist". And of course the C function `glp_eval_tab_row` cannot be expected to raise any exception.

I don't think that it is worth adding a sig_on/sig_off in this function, considering how short it is.

Nathann, if the second allocation fails, your version would leak the memory of the first allocation.

sig_on/sig_off catches all kinds of signals, and here it is used to catch SIGABRT, which GLPK invokes via abort() whenever there is an error. 

Is there a way to distinguish which signal was caught?

Sorry, I wrote this yesterday evening just before going to sleep and I was exhausted:


```
+        cdef int * c_indices = <int*> sage_malloc((n+1)*sizeof(int))
+        cdef double * c_values = <double*> sage_malloc((n+1)*sizeof(double))

+            raise MemoryError
```


> sig_on/sig_off catches all kinds of signals, and here it is used to catch SIGABRT, which GLPK invokes via abort() whenever there is an error. 

Oh, okay. Sorry.

> Is there a way to distinguish which signal was caught?

Just type "raise" instead of "raise <something>". It will raise what was caught. You can also use this model:


```
try:
    your_glpk_function(...)
else: # only executed if everything went well
    <copy the C data wherever you need>
finally: #whatever happens
    <free the memory>
return <whatever you need> 
```


Also, I don't think you should both with a loop of 'append'. Something like `values = [c_values[j] for j in range(i)]` works fine.

Replying to [comment:16 ncohen]:
> `except Exception: raise` is useless, isn't it?

You are right, of course. I've removed it.

> Could you also update the malloc blocks?

Done.

Hello !

I made some modifications, in a commit at public/18732:

- The first line of each docstring must be a short sentence describing what the function does

- Some inequations could be turned into latex formulas

- A row/col problem? Please check
  {{{
-        cdef int n = glp_get_num_rows(self.lp)
+        cdef int n = glp_get_num_cols(self.lp)
  }}}

If you agree with this, you can set the ticket's status to `positive_review`.

Nathann

P.S.: Please fill the 'author' field.
