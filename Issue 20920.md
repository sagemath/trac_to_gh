#20835 introduced a systematic encoder for linear codes which always obtains as the systematic positions the lexicographically minimal possibility. It would be nice if the user could specify the systematic positions.

At the same time, one could improve some methods of `AbstractLinearCode` to take advantage of the new improved systematic capabilities.

Hello,

Tests pass and documentation builds, and you made nice improvements (included a few I was about to open a ticket for, like the improvement to `redundancy_matrix`'s doc `:)`).

I give this ticket a positive review.
