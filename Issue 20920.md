# Issue 20920: Improvements to systematic encoder for linear codes

Keywords: linear cod

#20835 introduced a systematic encoder for linear codes which always obtains as the systematic positions the lexicographically minimal possibility. It would be nice if the user could specify the systematic positions.

At the same time, one could improve some methods of `AbstractLinearCode` to take advantage of the new improved systematic capabilities.

I've implemented the systematic encoder improvements as well as employed the new capabilities to simplify a few methods in `AbstractLinearCode`.

Hello,

Tests pass and documentation builds, and you made nice improvements (included a few I was about to open a ticket for, like the improvement to `redundancy_matrix`'s doc `:)`).

I give this ticket a positive review.

David
