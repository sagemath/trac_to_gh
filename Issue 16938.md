The main "problem" of replacing `__cmp__()` is pointed out in http://www.mail-archive.com/sage-devel`@`googlegroups.com/msg73051.html. Until we find a reasonable solution for it, we should continue with the easier tickets, like #16529.

> What is the reason for explicitly defining all 4 comparisons in `src/sage/dynamics/flat_surfaces/strata.py` instead of defining one (e.g. `__gt__`) and using the class decorator `functools.total_ordering`?

All comparisons need `self._marked_separatrix == other._marked_separatrix` and I think this leads to problems with the class decorator.

I do not think that it is //always// the right approach to solve the easier problems before the hard ones.

We have done this with good reason for stage 1 (#15980). But the completion of stage 1 has to precede the completion of stage 2. And now we have the hard problems that remain in stage 1!

I think that stage 2 (#16052) could use a tool like https://github.com/PythonCharmers/python-future to good effect. 
Clearly this does not prevent us from solving some of the problems (added originally to stage 2) in a stage 1 style (as was possible for `filter` and `reduce`, and I think it is also possible for `map` #16073!).

But we should try to complete stage 1 as soon as possible: if we cannot solve those remaining hard problems then Sage will not available under Python 3.

Anyway I will have a look at #16529 ;-)
And I will try to grok the //rich comparison// stuff - it is difficult and but it is also necessary!
