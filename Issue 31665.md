Possible followup to #31756 : trying to enhance our interface to Mathematica by //simple// means.

Mathematica has many functions not implemented in Sage. Some of them are (semi-)trivial possible additions (e.g. Mathematica's `HypergeometriPFQRegularized`, which is but). the normalized versin of Sage's `hypergeometric`. They are not in the scope of this ticket, and adding them should be discussed on a case-by-case basis

Mathematica also has many "special-case" functions where Sage has only a "general case" ; for example, Sage's `hypergeometric` translates Mathematica's `HypergeometricPFQ`, but should also translate Mathematica's `Hypergeometric0F1`, `Hypergeometric1F1` and `Hypergeometric2F1` (it currently doesn't).

Such functions are a first scope of the present ticket : adding these translations add to the ability of using in Sage sime Mathematica's results.

But the most pressing enhancements are as follow :  many Mathematica functions, which //do// have Sage equivalents, are ill-translated by the current interface. A prime example is :

```
sage: arctan(x)._mathematica_()==mathematica.ArcTan(x)
False
```

This (seriously) limits the ability to delecate some calculations to Mathematica when it migh be better than Sage.

Detecting such cases is not trivial. A first approximation restricted to //Symbolic Functions// can be obtained by :

```
from sage.symbolic.function import Function
Funs=[eval(u) for u in dir(sage.functions.all) if u in globals() and isinstance(eval(u), Function)]
X=var("x", n=6)
DFuns={u:u.number_of_arguments() for u in Funs}
TransOK={}
for u in DFuns.keys():
    try:
        TransOK.update({u:bool(u(*X[:DFuns[u]]).diff(x0)._mathematica_() ==\
	                       mathematica.D(u(*X[:DFuns[u]]), x0))})
    except:
        TransOK.update({u:"Doesn't (back?)translate."})
BadTrans = [u for u in TransOK.keys() if not TransOK[u]]
NoTrans = [u for u in TransOK.keys() if type(TransOK[u]) is str]
```

The result is edifying :

```
sage: len(dir(sage.functions.all))
197
sage: len([u for u in dir(sage.functions.all) if u[0]!="_"])
189
sage: len(DFuns)
130
sage: len(BadTrans)
43
sage: len(NoTrans)
50
```

Doing the same work for the 59 functions  not derived from //Symbolic Function// isn't as trivial. Suggestions welcome.

Suggestions also welcome on how to attack this not-trivially-sized problem...
