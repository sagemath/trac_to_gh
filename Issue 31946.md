This would provide the operators currently implemented in `Polyhedron_base`: `__neg__`, `__truediv__`, `_add_`, `__sub__`, `_acted_upon_`

We also add an ``@`abstract_method(optional=True) ConvexSet_base.minkowski_sum`.

We do not make them available in `ConvexSet_base` because they may conflict with other intended operator semantics.
