# Issue 14026: Update developer conventions page for multiline equations

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/14230

Assignee: tscrim

Currently there is no mention of handling multiline equations in the developer's guide (that I could find). This adds a note to the conventions page in the MATH block section about multiline equations.

Here are some minor rewordings. I think I'm happy with it, but I have to run right now. I'll double check later.
