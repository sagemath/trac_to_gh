Hi, as discussed with some people from the SAGE combinat group I (together with two students of mine) developed a class for subshifts of finite type which I would like to get feedback on and which could (hopefully should) be included into SAGE eventually.

The code already includes the basic features for playing around with those symbolic dynamical systems, but of course it will be extended over time. Just thought it would be nice to get some feedback on this first version right now, especially as the code is already long.

Hi Michael,

i got the following error : 

IndentationError: unindent does not match any outer indentation level (finite_type_shift.py, line 2415)

One space is missing at line 2415. After fixing this, the tests do pass.

Also, don't forget to add yourself on the first page of the trac.

Hi,

I looked very quickly at the code on a friend's computer, and suggest to chqnge the code of the method `entropy` from:

```python
if logarit == True:
    if self._is_empty:
        return -Infinity
    else:
        return log(max([x for x in self._matrix.eigenvalues()
                          if x in RR]))
elif logarit == False:
    if self._is_empty:
        return 0
    else:
        return max([x for x in self._matrix.eigenvalues() if x in RR])
else:
    raise ValueError("logarit must be either True or False")
```

to:

```python
if self._is_empty:
    if logarit:
        return -Infinity
    else:
        return 0
else:
    M = max([x for x in self._matrix.eigenvalues() if x in RR])
    if logarit:
        return log(M)
    else:
        return M
```

This is simply an example to show how to deal with conditions and booleans. Also, in this case, the value error was not necessary since python will return an error if logarith does not evaluate to a bool.

Hi,

I also get doc building warnings, which (as usual) are due to some minor formatting errors.

Otherwise all the tests pass on my sage 5.0.1.

I've played quite a lot with the ``SFT`` class, I found it very usable and found no bugs. Thanks!

How many warnings do you get when building the documentation ? You need to fix all of them. That being said, the warning are not always self-expaining...

```
sage -b && sage -docbuild reference html
```

After taking a look at the patch, I believe many of the warning are of the same type. Indeed, an empty line is needed before any enumeration. Instead of

```
	    - ``format`` - (default: 'edge') this flag selects one of two possible 
	      representations for the SFT: 
	        - 'vertex' - a representation of the SFT as a vertex shift 
 	        - 'edge' - a representation of the SFT as an edge shift 
	      If this parameter is not provided in the constructor the 'edge' 
	      representation is chosen by default. 
```

you need to write

```
	    - ``format`` - (default: 'edge') this flag selects one of two possible 
	      representations for the SFT: 

	        - 'vertex' - a representation of the SFT as a vertex shift 
 	        - 'edge' - a representation of the SFT as an edge shift 
	      If this parameter is not provided in the constructor the 'edge' 
	      representation is chosen by default. 
```

How many warnings do you get when you add those empty lines before every enumeration?

Hey slabbe, thanks for the comment. I tried it, but still get some docbuild warnings, see below. It appears there are empty lines missing also after certain blocks, but I dont know exactly where.

Is there any way to see where exactly they are produced? the numbers seem not to match line numbers in the .py file. Is there any good reference for sphinx or the syntax I should use for SAGE to build the doc without warnings?

Very annoying this sphinx thing!

Any comment very welcome. Thanks.

Attachment [12996-docfix-tj.patch](tarball://root/attachments/some-uuid/ticket12996/12996-docfix-tj.patch) by tjolivet created at 2012-08-01 09:22:36

Hi, I uploaded a patch which fixes the 18 docbuild errors/warnings I had on **my** machine (I hope it works on other systems as well). These were quite nasty to find, it can drive one crazy.

The most common were : no blank line after at the end of a "-" list of items.

There was also the special character sequence that consists of two concatenated "*", which placed alone in text caused problems.

I fixed a few other things as well.

Having used the patch and analysed it I'd be ready to give it a positive review.

Also, one of the most useful and not-too-long-to-implement would be state splittings/amalgamations which are very easy to program using matrix line/columns operations (already in Sage :p).

Yes... it is. The number refers to the line number inside each doctring, but you don't know which... By chance, we write documentation almost always the same way and there are few rules to learn. Here is what I suggest. You first read

http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/rst/quickref.html

Then, you practice yourself with the script `SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/rst2html.py`

For example, you copy a doctring between `r"""` and `"""` of your file into a file `fichier.rst` like this one:

```
INPUT: 

- ``init_obj`` - (default: None) can be any of the following: 
    - a directed (multi)graph 
    - a square matrix with non-negative integer entries 
    - a list of forbidden words (over some alphabet) either given as 
        - a list of strings (with or without symbol separators), e.g. 
          ['11', '123', '4'] (no separator) or ['1.1', '1.2.3', '4'] 
          ('.' used as separator) 
        - a list of lists containing elements of the alphabet, e.g. 
          [[1, 1], [1, 2, 3], [4]] or [['a', 'a'], ['a', 'b', 'b']] 
        - a list of instances of the SAGE class Words (over the alphabet), 
          e.g. [Word("11"), Word(["1", "2", "3"]), Word("4")] 
  If this parameter is not provided the full-shift over the specified 
  alphabet will be created. If neither this parameter nor an alphabet 
  is given the empty shift will be created. 

- ``alph`` - (default: None) a list of symbols (the alphabet) used in the 
  definition of the SFT. If this parameter is not provided a standard 
  alphabet will be created (whenever possible) from the ``init_obj``. The 
  elements of the alphabet can be general SAGE objects which do not 
  contain the substring ``symb_sep`` in their string representation. 
  Nevertheless it is preferable to use symbols which are either 
  non-negative integers or short strings (e.g. single letters). 

  The alphabet is not allowed to contain repetitions (literal copies as 
  well as symbols whose string representations do coincide) and whenever 
  its elements have distinct lengths the use of ``symb_sep`` is strongly 
  advised. We also highly recommend the use of unambiguous alphabets! 
```

Then, you call the following command on it :

```
$ ~/Applications/sage-5.2/local/bin/rst2html.py fichier.rst fichier.html
fichier.rst:14: (WARNING/2) Definition list ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent.
```

Now, the number 14 refers really to the line 14 in the file fichier.rst. You may also open the html file to see where is the warning :

```
$ open fichier.html
```

You may also copy and paste docstring into this website I just found and never used before :

http://rst.ninjs.org/

hi,

Few more remarks

* the output is too verbose. When I print a number I do not want to see "Number 3112. It is not prime and its divisors are 1, 2, 4, 8, 389, 778, 1556 and 3112." but only "3112". The same for shifts. Methods are here to get more informations.

* Because you inherit from SageObject, the method repr with two underscores should be modified into a repr with one underscore (see the code and the documentation of SageObject). In particular, SageObject takes care of custom names.

* the option "alph" is named "alphabet" in the words library but they should have the same name·

* the alphabet in your class are lists but there is a class for alphabet in sage.combinat.words.alphabet, why not using it?

* The name of the method an_element is not appropriate. an_element should return an element of the subshift.

Hi Vincent,

I addressed most of your comments:

- renamed method "__repr__" to "_repr_". (although I still dont see the difference - I looked at the documentation of SageObject, but did not get the point - can you explain this, maybe in a private email)
- renamed option "alph" to "alphabet"
- the option "alphabet" accepts as input both a list and an alphabet (as defined in the word class), so externally there is no difference. Internally I prefer the standard type list - it has less overhead, especially as it is accessed a lot in building admissible words etc.
- changed documentation of "an_element". Your comment seems to be based on a misunderstanding as the method already DID return an element of the SFT in form of an iterator - how else would you represent an infinite sequence of symbols? Comments welcome.

Your first comment is not yet addressed, as I dont know what you would like to see as output. If the SFT has a name this name is returned, but if it does not? The method could just return "An SFT", but what is the point of this, you could just check "isinstance" - it is not very informative, so I thought having at least the alphabet would be helpful. Any suggestions on this from your side would be very welcome.

Best
M.

Hi Michael,

> - renamed method "__repr__" to "_repr_". (although I still dont see the difference - I looked at the documentation of SageObject, but did not get the point - can you explain this, maybe in a private email)
> Your first comment is not yet addressed, as I dont know what you would like to see as output. If the SFT has a name this name is returned, but if it does not? The method could just return "An SFT", but what is the point of this, you could just check "isinstance" - it is not very informative, so I thought having at least the alphabet would be helpful. Any suggestions on this from your side would be very welcome.


The SageObject implements custom names and it is not needed to reimplement it

```
sage: class A(SageObject): 
....:     pass
sage: a = A()           
sage: a
<class '__main__.A'>
sage: a.rename('toto')
sage: a
toto
sage: a.reset_name()
sage: a
<class '__main__.A'>
```

The method __repr__ of SageObject precisely choose whether to use the custom name or the method _repr_ that are implemented in derived classes.

> - renamed option "alph" to "alphabet"
> - the option "alphabet" accepts as input both a list and an alphabet (as defined in the word class), so externally there is no difference. Internally I prefer the standard type list - it has less overhead, especially as it is accessed a lot in building admissible words etc.


Cool! I hope that in a next future it would be simpler and faster to use alphabet.

> - changed documentation of "an_element". Your comment seems to be based on a misunderstanding as the method already DID return an element of the SFT in form of an iterator - how else would you represent an infinite sequence of symbols? Comments welcome.


I agree that mathematically the sequence belongs to the SFT but as a Python object it is an iterator and not an element of the subshift.  What I mean by an element is something that knows what its parent is. In other words with the following behavior

```
sage: S = MySFT()
sage: S
My SFT
sage: s = S.an_element()
sage: s in S
True
sage: s.parent()
My SFT
```
(the notion of element/parent is explained in the Sage reference http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/coercion.html)

In your case you may use infinite which can be initialized from iterators. A basic example is as follows

```
sage: W = Words('ab')
sage: from itertools import count
sage: W('a' if (n%5+1)%3 else 'b' for n in count())
word: aabaaaabaaaabaaaabaaaabaaaabaaaabaaaabaa...
```

Anyway, the issue about element/parent will be solved with the "categorification" of shifts and languages (ticket #12224).

>> * the output is too verbose. When I print a number I do not want to see "Number 3112. It is not prime and its divisors are 1, 2, 4, 8, 389, 778, 1556 and 3112." but only "3112". The same for shifts. Methods are here to get more informations.


My comment about the output is no more than a comment. I find it too verbose but I do not know what is better. For graphs the ouptut is simply "Graph on 12 vertices". You may choose "SFT over {a, b, c}" where {a, b, c} is replaced by whatever is the alphabet but you may prefer as well to keep the old version.

Hoping that the definitive version is not far away.

Best,
Vincent

Hi all,

*ping*

What is the status of that ticket ? My question is partly because of ticket #12224 which modifies the structure of words. There are evident conflict with this one, but it won't be hard to merge them (I can even do it). I suggest that this one goes first, in which case I will put a dependency on #12224 and do the merge within #12224.

Comment on last modifications:
* you used "on {a,b,c}" instead of "over {a,b,c}" which is currently in used in words

What do you think ?

Best,
Vincent

Hi all,

coming back from my summer vacations I uploaded a new patch.

1) I changed the output from "A SFT on alphabet" to "A SFT over alphabet"
2) I changed the names of three methods (as indicated by vdelecroix)
3) I changed the "warnings" line, so only my module is affected (thanks for pointing out how to do this vdelecroix)
4) I played around with the SearchForest, but fially decided to keep the code as was before (I was not able to use SearchForest to produce the admissible words in the order I intended) and with a postprocessing step the code is clumpsy and slower

One final thing to do:
If I delete the "warnings.formatwarning = sft_warning_style" line 130 the output of two tests (producing a Warning) are modified including a file name and a non-standard line number which gets me into trouble with the doctest. Any idea how to tell SAGE to ignore the filename and line-number in the output of the doctest?

Best
M.

It seems about time to give this ticket a positive review, but why has the patchbot always been refusing to apply the patches?

1. The file `doc/en/reference/index.rst` changed in a recent version of Sage. Hence, there is now a small reject with the first patch which should be fixed :

2. The coverage of the folder `sage/dynamics/symbolic` is not 100% as it should:

```
sage/dynamics/symbolic $ sage -coverage .

No functions in ./__init__.py
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Missing documentation:

Missing doctests:
     * line 2855: def _allwords(self, n)

     * line 3002: def _create_fwords_DiGraph(self)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

I know it is hidden functions and so on, but they should be documented and doctested as any other.

3. I looked more carefully at the code for the first time. I realize that the SFT, which can be created from three distinct input types (digraph, matrix, forbidden words), compute everything at the creation of the SFT. For example:

```
   sage: X = SFT(["0101", "100"], alph=["0", "1"])  # computation of the matrix is done here
   sage: M = X.matrix()                             # not here
```

Since there is only one class for SFT, I understand why everything is computed in the init. Because, we want to make sure once the init is done, that every objects behave the same what ever input was given.

If I had to code such a class now, I would create four classes : `SFT`, `SFT_from_digraph`, `SFT_from_matrix` and `SFT_from_forbidden_words`. I would put methods that depends on the representation inside child classes and general methods in the top class.

```python
class SFT(SageObject):
    def __classcall__(self, data):
        if data is a digraph:
            return SFT_from_digraph(data)
        elif data is a matrix:
            return SFT_from_matrix(data)
        if data is forbidden words:
            return SFT_from_forbidden_words(data)
    def matrix(self):
        raise NotImplementedError("this is a specific method and must be coded in the child class")
    def some_general_method(self):
        pass
class SFT_from_digraph(SFT):
    def __init__(self, data):
        self._graph = data
    def matrix(self):
        M = ... # compute the matrix from the graph
        return M
class SFT_from_matrix(SFT):
    def __init__(self, data):
        self._matrix = datta
    def matrix(self):
        return self._matrix
class SFT_from_forbidden_words(SFT):
    def __init__(self, data):
        self._forbidden = data
    def matrix(self)
        M = ... #compute the matrix from forbidden words
        return M
```

The advantage is that the code is closer to the reality (more clear, easier to maintain) and also more efficient (the matrix, for above example, is computed only if the user needs it).

This ticket is open since too long time. I feel bad for asking such modifications so late... Should we just make it get into Sage and make future improvements then? I am sure the code is usefull as it is now so... So Michael, what do you think? Are you still motivated to work on it now?
