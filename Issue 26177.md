# Issue 26177: rational_power_parts should return Integer instances (not int)

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/26414

Original creator: jdemeyer

Original creation time: 2018-10-05 15:03:17


```
sage: x, y = rational_power_parts(1, 1/1)
sage: type(y)
<type 'int'>
```


This is causing breakage with Cython language_level=3 due to an `int`/`int` division.

This should be re-targeted for 8.5.
