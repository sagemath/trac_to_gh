# Issue 15401: Recompiling an extension every time we rebuild

Everytime I rebuild sage with 6.1.beta4 (even with no changes), I have the following cython file being rebuilt:

```
building 'sage.groups.perm_gps.partn_ref2.refinement_generic' extension
```

While this doesn't take a long time, it shouldn't happen.
