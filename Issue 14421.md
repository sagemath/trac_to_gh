While packaging lrcalc for Debian, our qa tool lintian detected that the lrcalc library is calling exit(). And indeed, it calls exit and shuts down Sage every time it runs out of memory, in mathlib/alloc.c.

We already discussed this with the upstream author Anders Skovsted Buch and with Nicolas Thi√©ry. It's a bug in lrcalc, but since Anders has no time to fix it, one could fix it in Sage first. Normally one would make the library report an error and let the program using the library handle it. The problem is that lrcalc does not free its memory and returns to a clean state after an error. Anders says this would be difficult to achieve. A workaround would be to perform each calculation in a new thread that is thrown away in the case of an error.


Version: 1.1.6

Steps to reproduce:

Limit the memory for this shell to 900 MB so the memory will quickly be full:

ulimit -Sv 900000

Start Sage and run a lrcalc command that needs a lot of memory:

sage

sage: import sage.libs.lrcalc.lrcalc as lrcalc

sage: sage.libs.lrcalc.lrcalc.mult([20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1], [20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1])

Anne forwarded me this message from Anders and I am cc'ing all the relevant suspects and then some.  This issue is relevant because of a bug found in the Schur product in symmetrica (reported in #15397).  I am proposing that lrcalc be used to compute the product of two Schur functions.:

My latest version of lrcalc is 1.1.7.  I'm not sure what has been
included in sage.  The latest version of the library requires that the
calling program uses setjmp() to recover from a failed call to lrcalc.
Probably sage has a wrapper function that calls the lrcalc library
already.  It should be modified as follows:


```
result_type * call_lrcalc_mult(args)
{
   if (setjmp(lrcalc_panic_frame))
     {
       /* if this code is executed, then lrcalc ran out of memory. */
       return NULL;
     }
   prd = mult(args);
   sageprd = < convert prd to sage structures >
   return sageprd;
}
```


But again, to obtain any real improvement, somebody has to figure out
how much memory lrcalc can safely use, this might not be entirely
trivial to determine.

Another message that Anne forwarded to me relevant to this ticket:

Hi Anne,

I did know about that one, and I already did some work on this so that
the latest version of lrcalc does not call exit (I think). But this
doesn't really make a difference, at least not under linux.

Lrcalc calls exit() whenever a call to malloc() returns a zero pointer
(which means out-of-memory).  But I am told that under linux, malloc()
NEVER returns zero.  In stead, if the kernel cannot fulfill a request
for more memory, it simply kills off the program that requests it.  So
if that is true, it doesn't matter if lrcalc calls exit or not, the
kernel will still kill the library and the rest of sage if lrcalc ever
runs out of memory.

I made some changes to the library that makes it possible to stop in the
middle of a computation and clean up gracefully, and this could be done
if lrcalc ever uses "too much" memory.  But the library would need sage
to tell it exactly how much memory it is allowed to use.  I don't have
time to get involved with programming sage proper, so somebody else will
have to figure out a way to determine how much memory can safely be
consumed.  If somebody can do this, then I should be able to make sure
that lrcalc will return with an error if that amount of memory is ever
reached.

Anders

That's not entirely true. It's true that Linux allows "overcommitting" (allocating more memory than is available), but only to a certain extent. If you allocate an enormous amount of memory, `malloc()` will fail anyway. Second of all, this is a configuration parameter and this overcommitting can be disabled. Third, when running under `ulimit -v`, you can never allocate more memory than the limit.

As for returning an error value during a computation: you can use `sig_error()` for this (introduced in #9640 and more examples in #15352).

Further reply from Anders Buch:

"Hello,

The situation is that sage can call lrcalc, which can in turn consume a
lot of memory if the input partitions are too large.  If this happens
under any os, then the whole sage process (and possibly the system too)
will be brought to its knees, and in some cases killed by the os.

If lrcalc is free to call malloc as much as it wants, then this is the
scenario that results when the input is too large.  Personally I am fine
with using programs that work like this, but it may not meet the needs
of all users.  However, since version 1.1.6 of the lrcalc library only
calls exit() in an out-of-memory situation, I think it is silly to worry
about that use of exit() if nothing else is done to avoid situations
where sage crashes because lrcalc eats all the memory.  It doesn't
matter who kills the process, and if it is to be killed, then the
user/system will suffer the least if it happens quickly!

I should also add that the partial fix to the lrcalc library that I have
made includes keeping all memory allocated by lrcalc in a doubly linked
list, so that everything can be freed up gracefully in case lrcalc has
to stop a computation and return an error code.  This means that the
error-handling code will make lrcalc use more memory and run slightly
slower.
