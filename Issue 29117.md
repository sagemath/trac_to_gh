As noted in #29373 (Upgrade freetype)  Need to add some certificates package so that https downloads of an upstream_url work:

```
  [freetype-2.10.1]   Attempting to download from https://download.savannah.gnu.org/releases/freetype/freetype-2.10.1.tar.gz
  [freetype-2.10.1]   [xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx]
  [freetype-2.10.1]   ERROR [transfer|run:135]: [Errno socket error] [SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed (_ssl.c:727)
  [freetype-2.10.1]   ************************************************************************
  [freetype-2.10.1]   Traceback (most recent call last):

zlib not found in slackware-14.2-standard (https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/524868652)

they by default install zlib which is too old (1.2.8).
they have 1.2.11 in patches/, so, interactively, one would use `slackpkg` to update.
But automatically?

The workflow is getting zlib 1.2.11, and now it says `configure: will use system package and not install SPKG zlib`.
