At the Developer's Guide, section "Upgrading Sage with queues present" can be find the following information:

     Sometimes for intermediate releases you will need a URL as an argument to the -upgrade switch. Check the Sage discussion groups, where these locations are typically announced.

I look at the discussion group and can't find the link. Looking at the download page of the developer release, I find the link in the file sage-X.X.YYYY.txt.

Will help new developers if the information in the Developer's Guide are change.

The links are always posted in sage-release (and right now only in that group). So the documentation is accurate, although it could be more specific.
