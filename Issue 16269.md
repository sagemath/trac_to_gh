FYI, I didn't call this magmatic rng/ring because of #15043, and from a quick search, rng/ring almost always assumes associativity (i.e., we do _not_ want to do something similar to #15043 for rngs/rings).

Changing keywords from "nonassociative" to "nonassociative, rng, rings, sd58".

Hi!

Thanks for investigating this and #16492. If at this point there is no real code to put in them, it might not be worth it creating those categories. But let's discuss this face to face next week since I am on the train to Davis :-)
