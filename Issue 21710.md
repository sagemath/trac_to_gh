Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: moritz

Original creation time: 2016-11-23 13:44:45

CC:  nthiery jipilab

Keywords: days79, latex, tikz

For certain images generated with tikz, using view with the default `tightpage=True`. (The feature was made default in #21929)

An example would be graphs:

```
G=graphs.PetersenGraph()
view(latex(G), tightpage=True)
```

I propose to add an additional optin "border" to specify the size of the border and choose `5mm` as a default for this.

Jeremias, can you add your username and name to the list in the "Wiki" home page of the Sage trac? This allows Sage to attribute your contribution properly.

I tested that documentation builds fine. The problem is fixed by the commits. Doctest pass in `sage/misc/` and in `sage/graphs`. To me this is a positive review.

I let Jeremias or Moritz change the status to positive review since I added a small commit on top of theirs.

I added my name to the Wiki page, hopefully at the intended place. I will put it to positive review now, last commit by slabbe looks fine.
