I think it would be good if the user could set some global option which solver to use, such that (s)he doesn't have to give the solver each time a high-level function is called.

Well, the "default solver" is already automatically picked as the best among those installed. Cplex is taken if available, then Coin, then GLPK (default, always there).. This is mainly for checking that the results are coherent when the solver changes... 

How do you think such a global option should be set/read ?.. I do not know the custom for this in Sage `^^;`

Sure, you pick the overall best, but for a particular problem another one might be better and it would be nice to force a particular solver. Another application would be benchmarketing.

I'd suggest this user interface:

```python
sage: default_mip_solver()
'Coin'
sage: default_mip_solver('GLPK')
sage: default_mip_solver()
'GLPK'
```

Well, then for a *particular* problem the ``solver`` parameter should be the perfect answer, wouldn't it ? `:-p`

I'll be writing this patch, it shouldn't take long `:-)`

I think

```python

```
should be `:func:`. 

Other than that, the patch looks good. So once all doctests pass and this is fixed, I'm happy to give this patch a positive review.
