The failure occurs when `dot2tex` has been installed and was probably the result of #18545.

Yes, you are correct.

Okay, it might not be as simple as exposing a bug but bad input. If I use

```
F_internal = [(c[0],c[1],None) for c in F.cover_relations() if c in L.cover_relations()]
```

then I can see the plot.

Actually, this even works:

```
sage: F_internal = [tuple(c) for c in F.cover_relations() if c in L.cover_relations()]
```

Which makes sense considering the assertion is checking `assert isinstance(edge, tuple)`. What I suggest is making it also allow `list`.
