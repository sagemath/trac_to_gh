As reported at https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-release/UdllnAJFufA/-e8ArqwFBAAJ there is often a failure when
testing `combinat/posets/posets.py`

The failure occurs because `graphviz_string` does not allow edges to be given as lists (exposed by #18545).

That portion of the `L.plot(...)` call that appears to be the problem is `cover_colors={'black': F_internal}`. If it is removed then the `posets.py` test passes even with `dot2tex` installed.

Okay, it might not be as simple as exposing a bug but bad input. If I use

```
F_internal = [(c[0],c[1],None) for c in F.cover_relations() if c in L.cover_relations()]
```
then I can see the plot.

Actually, this even works:

```
sage: F_internal = [tuple(c) for c in F.cover_relations() if c in L.cover_relations()]
```
Which makes sense considering the assertion is checking `assert isinstance(edge, tuple)`. What I suggest is making it also allow `list`.
