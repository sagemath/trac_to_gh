Stalled in `needs_review` or `needs_info`; likely won't make it into Sage 9.5.

Does the provided code is enough to define a polyhedron with both strict and non-strict inequalities? It seems weird to introduce this class and not being able to use it.

Not by itself, no, which is why the lines marked `# temporary workaround` in the doctests are necessary.
