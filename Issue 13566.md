after #11829, #11838, #12918, #12928, #13672, here is another bug in multivariate arithmetic over prime fields:

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage: U.<y,t> = GF(2)[]  
sage: f
y*t^8 + y^5*t^2 + y*t^6 + t^7 + y^6 + y^5*t + y^2*t^4 + y^2*t^2 + y^2*t + t^3 + y^2 + t^2
sage: f.factor()
y*t^8 + y^5*t^2 + y*t^6 + t^7 + y^6 + y^5*t + y^2*t^4 + y^2*t^2 + y^2*t + t^3 + y^2 + t^2
sage: f % (t^2+t+y+1)
0
```

When will Sage be usable for this kind of computation?
| Sage Version 5.4.1, Release Date: 2012-11-15                       |

Paul,

to be fair #13672 isn't a bug in Singular but an issue with Pari and how we use it. Also, I am not sure there is a component we could use besides Singular for factoring. In any case, I've forwarded your bug report.

If there were any (for multivariate polynomials etc.), we would immediately use it in Singular.
BTW: when reported upstream, the response time is quite good, I think.

Jeroen,

> Wouldn't it be safer to include all four commits?

indeed (maybe only the first three, since the last one only adds tests). But I didn't know how to extract the diff, thus I edited the Singular source file manually, it took then several hours on my laptop to recompile the spkg and rebuild Sage, thus I was quite happy it worked (currently running
sage -t --long).

> Did you check whether this solves #14658?

unfortunately not. The first example of #14658 does no longer produce an error (same with vanilla 5.11 btw) but the factorization is incomplete:

```
sage: R.<x1,x2,x3> = QQ['x1,x2,x3']                              
sage: f = (x1+x2+x3)*(2*x1-x2+x3+2)*(4*x1+x2+x3+2)*(8*x1-x2+x3+4)
sage: f.factor()                                                 
(x1 + x2 + x3) * (64*x1^3 - 24*x1^2*x2 - 6*x1*x2^2 + x2^3 + 56*x1^2*x3 - 8*x1*x2*x3 - x2^2*x3 + 14*x1*x3^2 - x2*x3^2 + x3^3 + 128*x1^2 - 20*x1*x2 - 4*x2^2 + 68*x1*x3 - 4*x2*x3 + 8*x3^2 + 80*x1 - 4*x2 + 20*x3 + 16)
```

The other example still breaks with `Floating point exception`.
