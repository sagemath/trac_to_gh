Change the VS code config as follows:
- Use the correct path to the python executable (python doesn't exists for me in bin, but python3 does)
- Remove deprecated/unused config options
- Exclude symlinks to sage/src from search, since otherwise they show up as multiple hits (please add such symlinks in the vs config in the future).
