50 is the threshold for defaulting to `algorithm='padic'`. The following works fine: `random_matrix(ZZ,60).determinant(algorithm='pari')`

There is an infinite recursion going on where we compute a determinant over `ZZ` by working mod p and we compute a determinant over `GF(p)` by lifting to `ZZ`...
