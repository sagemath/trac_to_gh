There have been a spate of reports of issues like #26996 all stemming from people trying to build Sage on Linux systems that do not already have a supported Fortran compiler installed (but easily could).

The problem *only* occurs when trying to install the gfortran SPKG on Linux, and the fact that it's come up so frequently is alarming, as there should not be any good reason for people to be compiling gfortrans just for Sage.

There is discussion on #27054 about recommending it as a prerequisite.  I would go one step further and just fail--with a helpful error message-at `./configure` time, at least on platforms like Cygwin and most Linux distributions, to just install the system's fortran compiler, unless a flag is given to explicitly request it.  Because there's very rarely any good reason for someone to be wasting their time on that just to build Sage, and it seems many people have been doing so unwarily for a long time.

I don't think that #26996 should be used as a reason. That's a bug in the build system, that we could just fix independently.

I'm not saying that this ticket by itself is a bad idea, just that #26996 is not a good reason for it.

I agree, that's not the motivation at all.  My point was that it happened to expose the fact that a *lot* of people, more than I'd imagined was the case, were trying (and in the past, presumably, succeeding) to build gfortran when it wasn't really necessary for them to.

Instead of refusing to build it, I think we should in general suggest a list of system packages to install, at the end of the `configure` run, similar to #26964.

I have revised the ticket description accordingly.

What about embray's suggestion to fail on some platforms if gfortran is not installed? I worry that many users will run `make` without first running `./configure`, so the messages printed here will get lost.

I wouldn't object if Sage converted to the more standard `./configure; make` procedure, but we're not there yet. On a separate ticket, we should at least encourage this workflow. (As a side note, it annoys me that `make distclean` also runs `./configure`.)

Good point.
