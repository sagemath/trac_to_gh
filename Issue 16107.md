Fan comparison does not work if one fan lives in a non-saturated sublattice (I hope that's the right term):


```
sage: N = ToricLattice(1) 
sage: B = N.submodule([(2,)]).basis()
sage: f = Fan([Cone([B[0]])])
sage: B = N.submodule([(1,)]).basis()
sage: f2 = Fan([Cone([B[0]])])
sage: f == f2
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ArithmeticError: cannot interpret [(1)] as a sublattice of Sublattice <N(2)>!
```


The reason is simply that

```
sage: f.virtual_rays()
```

throws this exception. I don't know enough about fans to understand whether they can be made to work in such lattices, too, but it is also required in other places that the lattices for toric varieties be saturated anyway. Therefore I'am attaching a branch that catches this exception and does not compare the virtual rays of fans in such lattices, which seems to fix the problem.

Lastly, why should one even worry about this? Since `ToricDivisorGroup` inherits from `UniqueRepresentation`, it compares fans of newly created toric varieties with all fans in the cache. If one therefore has one malfunctioning fans, creating divisors in 'good' toric varieties will fail, too:


```
sage: N = ToricLattice(2) 
sage: B = N.submodule([(2,1), (1,2)]).basis()
sage: f = Fan([Cone([B[0], B[1]]), Cone([B[1], -B[0]-B[1]]), Cone([-B[0]-B[1], B[0]])])
sage: X = ToricVariety(f)
sage: aK = -X.K()

sage: B = N.submodule([(1,0), (1,1)]).basis()
sage: B[0].parent() is B[0].parent().saturation()
True
sage: f2 = Fan([Cone([B[0], B[1]]), Cone([B[1], -B[0]-B[1]]), Cone([-B[0]-B[1], B[0]])])
sage: X2 = ToricVariety(f2)
sage: from sage.schemes.toric.divisor import ToricDivisorGroup
sage: aK2 = -X2.K()
ArithmeticError: cannot interpret [(1, 2), (-1, -3)] as a sublattice of Sublattice <N(1, 2), N(0, 3)>!
```

Here's the quick fix. Doctests in /geometry and in /schemes pass.

Virtual rays should always work, so let's try to fix them! And fan in non-saturated lattices also should work, although it is technically trickier to construct a proper dual lattice (which should be a superlattice of the dual of saturation...)

Hi Andrey,

thanks again for taking a look. Well, fixing virtual rays would of course be better.  The line throwing an exception is

```
quotient = N.quotient(self.rays().matrix().saturation().rows())
```

since there may be rows that aren't elements of N. A (dirty) possible solution that comes to mind is to instead take to quotient of the ambient module of N wrt to these elements and then take the submodule of that quotient lattice, i.e. something like this:

```
qp = N.ambient_module().quotient(self.rays().matrix().saturation().rows())
quotient = qp.submodule(N.gens())
```

I'm afraid that that's probably something too naive/stupid and I'd be happy to hear why. :)

Best,
Jan

I think that's a fine solution - we really want to take the quotient of N by the vector space span of rays and then lift its generators to N.

I've taken the liberty to force push the new changes, since we cannot do much with the old ones and I suppose it's very unlikely that anybody will have based their branch on them. The new branch does exactly what written above and I've changed the description of the ticket accordingly.

Thanks Andrey!
