Question:  is a review of this required to look at the "upstream tarball" or only to verify that the metadata files are ok and it installs ok and runs?

IMHO metadata only and check that it works (well, it does ;-). It is not a library that we are going to use as a foundation for computations...

Although personally I think the repacking of the tarball is a little silly.
