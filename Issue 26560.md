Keywords: jeu de taquin

This is an implementation of the abstract PathTableau class. This gives the
jeu-de-taquin operation of evacuation on skew semistandard tableau, the operation of promotion on rectangular semistandard tableaux, dual equivalence graphs for semistandard tableaux, and rectification of skew semistandard tableaux. These operations are constructed from an efficient implementation of the Bender-Knuth moves.
