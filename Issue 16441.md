# Issue 16441: Fix coercions for descent and symmetric group algebras

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/16678

Original creator: tscrim

Original creation time: 2014-07-18 16:35:59

Assignee: tscrim

CC:  darij

Keywords: symmetric group algebra, descent algebra

This splits off the first issue of #15475 (which has already been reviewed by Darij). This will also address some of the issues noted on https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/rXobHQXrCck.

Thanks for the split, which was rather appropriate. Positive_review on my side.

Trivial failures due to SGA's being returned from `SymmetricGroup(n).algebra()`.

See followup #16625. Sorry I did not spot this earlier; it's too bad the change was released in 6.3, since now we are reverting a backward incompatible change, making it compabible back to <=6.2 but not 6.3 ...

#16925, not #16625.

I'm seeing it right that only the SymmetricGroup.Algebra part of this ticket will be reverted?

Replying to [comment:11 darij]:
> #16925, not #16625.

Oops, I am up-down dislexic apparently :-)

> I'm seeing it right that only the SymmetricGroup.Algebra part of this ticket will be reverted?

Definitely.
