Yes.  [comment:ticket:20926:60 As mentioned] on #20926:  Also Givaro's *testsuite* currently requires `-std=c++98` (not fixed yet, no ticket).

Note that GCC 6.x defaults to even C++14.

Yes, you can safely close it for the same reason as #20926 was closed. For the record LinBox, FFLAS-FFPACK and Givaro are tested on a Continuous Integration with gcc-4.9, gcc-5 and gcc-6 (I'm currently setting up a gcc-7 build).
