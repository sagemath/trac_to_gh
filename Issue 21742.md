sage: RealIntervalField(128)(u)

Problem is fixed. Documentation builds fine. Positive review.

Vincent, do you want to create a ticket for the unsolved problem with `RealLazyField` ?

Thanks.

I actually think that we should get rid of `RealLazyField` in any coercion involving number fields... I opened #21991.

As patchbots say there is a broken doctest in `polynomial_rational_flint.pyx`

```
sage: R.<t> = QQ[]
sage: f = 1 + t/2
sage: f.reverse(I)
```

The patchbot says:

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage -t --long src/sage/modular/modform/ambient.py  # Timed out
----------------------------------------------------------------------
```

I can not reproduce the problem. All other tests passed. Positive review.
