Github projects, when tagged via `git tag`, get automatically packaged (see project page / releases), and the URL has a standardized form, as well as the tarball. So, it would be most convenient if a project like patchbot that adheres to the SPKG directory structure could be installed by just saying

```
sage -i https://github.com/robertwb/sage-patchbot/archive/2.1.1.tar.gz
```

Sage would then take the `PACKAGE_NAME` from `SPKG.txt`, or it could be given as optional argument to `sage -i`.
