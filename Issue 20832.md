```
sage: Permutations([0])[0] == [0]
False
```

This is unexpected as

```
sage: Permutations([0])[0], [0]
([0], [0])
```

Both have the same string representation and

```
sage: Permutations([0])[0].parent()
Permutations of the set [0]
```

so it is a SageObject and some coercion or whatever should go on on comparison.

I think this is more an issue with the default `_cmp_` in `ClonableArray` wanting to have a common parent, but there are not coercions between most combinatorial objects (nor should there be typically). IMO, this is even worse:

```
sage: Permutations([1])[0] == Permutation([1])
False
```

However, I don't agree with the argument that "same representation => equality". Should the partition `[2, 1]` equal the permutation `[2, 1]`? (Currently they do, but I think that is a small issue and you should not rely on this behavior.) We run into a major notation problem as there is not enough valid syntax and math notation to separate the two clearly; context (or their parents) separate them.
