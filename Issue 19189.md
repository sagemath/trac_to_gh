Hi!
I've fixed the conflict and committed the changes.

In principal, I agree with your suggestion. The problem was I could not build sage on my PC without fixing this problem, and it took a while until I could get everything to work (trac user, git, etc.).

Anyway, hopefully it can be reviewed now.
Thanks,
Eran
