Hi! Your basic approach looks good, however, you should merge the latest beta (`8.2.beta8`) into your branch and fix the resulting merge conflict with your adaption of the brial configuration. (This issue has been fixed in #24860, which is merged in beta8.)

As a suggestion: you should keep fixes for unrelated problems (like in this case the brial problem) separate from the code for this ticket (basically, separate fixes deserve separate tickets).

I'll review this as soon as the conflict is resolved.

Hi!
I've fixed the conflict and committed the changes.

In principal, I agree with your suggestion. The problem was I could not build sage on my PC without fixing this problem, and it took a while until I could get everything to work (trac user, git, etc.).

Anyway, hopefully it can be reviewed now.
Thanks,
Eran
