Assignee: @williamstein

Some desirable additions to the tab completer:
* include `x.foo_bar` in the completion of `x.bar<tab>` (search all words after splitting at underscore)
* Ditto for CamelCase: Include `RealField` in `Field<tab>`
* All-caps as shortcut for CamelCase: `AMPD<tab>` should yield `AtkinModularPolynomialDatabase`
* Turn on IPython's greedy completion (completion of lists): `lst[0].<tab>` shows the methods of `lst[0]`

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/14552

I'd be happy to work on this, but I have a few questions before I start:
* Are the suggested enhancements actually the behavior we want?
* Are there any other enhancements that should be included?
* Where would I go to find the relevant code? i.e. Where do I start making these changes?
I'm changing the status to 'needs_info'; is that the correct way to use this status?

Number 3 shouldn't cause any namespace issues. The first one was a request by David Roe on #14548 since English places adjectives first whereas you might use tab completion looking for the subsequent noun. 

In any case, its hard to judge from the outset if it'll be too much. Perhaps the additional completions should only shown if the list of actual completions is very short. It would be nice to have a prototype implementation to try it out.

Number 4 you can do already on-the-fly with

```
sage: get_ipython().Completer.greedy = True
```

It just needs to be integrated into `sage.misc.sage_extension`.

For the others you should read the `IPython/core/completer.py` source. You'd probably have to write a derived `class SageCompleter(Completer)`.

I never heard back from the author of the IPEP, so I've implemented the requested changes as IPython stands now. A few notes on the implementation:

1. The new completions should work for any global names, attribute names, and modules. They do not work for filenames (seems 
 unnecessary and difficult) or IPython magic functions (there are few enough and none of them really apply).
1. In an effort to not overpollute the completion space, the new completions are only shown if there were no "traditional" completions 
available. This seems to work pretty well for me, but perhaps other people will find it too restrictive. Let me know how you like it.

I've tested the misc directory but not the entire Sage library. I wanted to get some feedback on the functionality before going through that whole process. I've also built the documentation, which seems fine.

The new functionality is not doctested because I have no idea how to go about testing tab completion. Does anyone have any ideas how this can be best done? I would guess that I can use the get_test_shell function in the interpreter module, but I don't know how to make that work. 

Finally, I tried to use my best judgement on where things should be placed in the Sage library, but I'm not sure if everything is in an appropriate place, so if you could look at that too, that would be great.

Some comments before you go on with this patch. It should be mentioned in the documentation that these enhanced completions (except the greedy one) make sense only in the notebook. In fact, they should perhaps be enabled only if we are indeed working in the notebook. For instance, look at this output in the terminal. There is no way I can continue with the completion on the terminal (unless the shell can tab through the separate options, like zsh).

```

a[1].bit_length   a[1].conjugate    a[1].denominator  a[1].imag         a[1].numerator    a[1].real
```


Also, as you can see from the following output, not all the suggestions are being made. There is some stuff missing.

```
sage: Fiel  # <--------- Where are the RealField, ComplexField, RealLazyField, etc?
Field         FieldElement  Fields
```


Now, some documentation changes :)
1. Use `:trac:`14552`` instead of `http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/14552`. The URL will be automatically generated.
2. Don't break the `:class:`~IPython.frontend.terminal.interactiveshell.TerminalInteractiveShell`` into two lines. It looks a bit weird when rendered:

```
   This method is basically copied from the method it overrides in "
   TerminalInteractiveShell", but using "SageCompleter" as the
   completer instead. This was done to address

Attachment [trac_14552_tab_completer_cycle.patch](tarball://root/attachments/some-uuid/ticket14552/trac_14552_tab_completer_cycle.patch) by scmancuso created at 2013-05-31 19:58:09

The patch I uploaded has some bugs. I was working on fixing them, but as I was working with it, I just found that there were far too many completions to cycle through in most cases. For example, 

```
sage: Fie<tab>
AlgebraicField                     ResidueField
AlgebraicRealField                 UniversalCyclotomicField
...
RealIntervalField                  is_pAdicField
RealLazyField                      pAdicField
sage: AlgebraicField
```

gives sixty possible completions, and, most annoyingly, automatically fills in with the first one (AlgebraicField), requiring that you tab-cycle through them to find the one you want. Obviously this is unacceptable. If we enable tab-cycling, then I think we should go back to the way I first implemented it, where the traditional completions are used if there are any, and the new completions are used only if there were no traditional completions. 

The other option is to not have any tab-cycling, and then we could show all completions (traditional and new), or the way I originally implemented it.
