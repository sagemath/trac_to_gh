This should be without quotes, similar to the difference between `repr()` and `str()` of a Python string:

```
sage: print pari('"hello world"')
"hello world"
```

- The patchbot reports a doctest failure in `sage.interfaces.interface.InterfaceElement.__reduce__`.  I think the quoted version `"abc"` is the correct output.  Probably `gen.__reduce__()` should use `__repr__()` instead of `__str__()`.
- It would look better to use `%r` in the error message that you change in the patch, and actually I would also prefer putting a space after the `=`, i.e.

```
raise TypeError("x (= %r) must be of type t_INT, but is of type %s" % (x, x.type()))
```

(For the second point, maybe we can even remove the type check and rely on PARI to raise an error.)
