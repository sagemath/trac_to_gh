I propose a correction for a bug in DiGraph.spectral_radius().

The problem.
The following code does'nt stop:
 sage: g = DiGraph([(0,1),(1,2),(2,0),(2,0)], multiedges=True)
 sage: g.spectral_radius()

The solution.
The fact that it doesn't stop comes from the fact that the graph is not aperiodic. So I propose to raise a error when we detect that the graph is peridic rather that going to an infinite loop.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/26559

I agree with the proposed change. We could also try to improve method `is_aperiodic` (currently using a method from `NetworkX`, so we have to pay for the transformation) but this can be done later.

One solution to avoid to pay for is_aperiodic() is to throw two threads: one that compute is_aperiodic(), the other one that compute the spectral radius(). If is_aperiodic() returns false, then we stop everything and raise an error. If the computation of the spectral radius ends, then we stop the thread computing is_aperiodic().

Before and after the test `is_aperiodic`, you have introduced lines with trailing white spaces (4 spaces) and this is something to avoid. You must remove these spaces (but keep empty lines).
