# Issue 13328: Large number of warnings: referenced before assignment during Sage 5.3 build

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: startakovsky

Assignee: tbd

Not sure if this is something which is known, but I didn't see a ticket open for it.  For a while every line lists something like "warning: /path/to/some-package/some-file referenced before assignment......"  for the linux installation from source of SAGE 5.3

Assuming this is a minor/trivial thing.

It would be nice.  I don't think anyone is going to fix it anytime soon - likely it's a Cython-specific thing, in fact.

Most of these are fixed and most of the non-fixed ones involve macros or C++ references which cannot be obviously fixed.
