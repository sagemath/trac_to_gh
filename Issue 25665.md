Sage currently doesn't have much support for linear algebraic groups.  This ticket is for creating some infrastructure for working with them, by starting with algebraic tori.

Sage does have support for matrix groups (`sage/groups/matrix_gps/`), for root systems (`sage/combinat/root_systems/`) and for affine schemes (`sage/schemes/generic/scheme.py`).  Algebraic groups will be built out of these ingredients.

Magma's functionality for algebraic groups includes invariant theory (https://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/magma/handbook/invariant_theory).  In this ticket we will focus more on questions of rationality and Galois cohomology.

We also note that the functionality we envision for algebraic groups is fairly distinct from that of finitely presented matrix groups (e.g. as summarized in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.05984.pdf).
