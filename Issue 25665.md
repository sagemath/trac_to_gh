# Issue 25665: Algebraic tori

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Sage currently doesn't have much support for linear algebraic groups.  This ticket is for creating some infrastructure for working with them, by starting with algebraic tori.

Sage does have support for matrix groups (`sage/groups/matrix_gps/`), for root systems (`sage/combinat/root_systems/`) and for affine schemes (`sage/schemes/generic/scheme.py`).  Algebraic groups will be built out of these ingredients.

Magma's functionality for algebraic groups includes invariant theory (https://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/magma/handbook/invariant_theory).  In this ticket we will focus more on questions of rationality and Galois cohomology.

We also note that the functionality we envision for algebraic groups is fairly distinct from that of finitely presented matrix groups (e.g. as summarized in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.05984.pdf).

Patchbot is not happy, see the plugins.

Now doc builds, but patchbot is still not happy. Please care about that.

Yep, we're still working on various parts of the code, and will address the patchbot failures.

Comment by roed created at 2019-11-27 08:03:22

Still need to make various changes, but I think I've addressed the patchbot problems (though there may still be some failing tests)


---

Comment by chapoton created at 2019-11-27 08:15:56

here, the doctests should be indented more

```
+        EXAMPLES::
+
+        sage: T1 = AlgebraicTorus(Lattice_ambient([], 1));
+        sage: T2 = T1.norm_one_restriction(G)
+        sage: G = SymmetricGroup(3)
```



---

Comment by chapoton created at 2019-11-27 14:16:16

patchbot is almost happy (excluding the doctests):

```
+src/sage/modules/glattice.py:290: 'sage.combinat.permutation.Permutation' imported but unused
```

patchbot is still not happy, and moreover there are really many failing doctests...


---

Comment by roed created at 2019-11-30 20:04:25

Yep, we know about the doctests.  The code is still in progress, and I recently changed the print representation without updating the test results.  I'm pretty busy this coming week and won't have time time to work on this ticket much, though Thomas might.  I'm planning on coming back to it once I get back to Boston though.

Thanks for the interest in the ticket!

So I talked with Thomas yesterday, and he told me you were having a pickling issue. The problem comes from the fact that actions cannot be pickled:

```
sage: V = QQ^3
sage: v = V((1, 2, 3))
sage: cm = get_coercion_model()
sage: a = cm.get_action(V, QQ, operator.mul)
sage: dumps(a)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
AttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)
[snip]
/home/travis/sage-build/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/sage/categories/functor.pyx in sage.categories.functor.Functor.__reduce__ (build/cythonized/sage/categories/functor.c:2242)()
    212         """
    213         return (_Functor_unpickle,
--> 214                 (self.__class__, list(self.__dict__.items()),
    215                  self.__domain, self.__codomain))
    216 

AttributeError: 'sage.structure.coerce_actions.RightModuleAction' object has no attribute '__dict__'
```

This is #29031.

`Tate_Cohomology` should probably be renamed `tate_cohomology` to match our coding standards
