The patchbot report is a bit weird, so I hope we can safely ignore it. Other than that, can you include just one more doctest to show that symbolic variables can be used? I have something like this in mind:

```
sage: pari([10, 'x', x^2, 20]).lcm()
20*x^2
sage: pari([10, 'x', x^2]).gcd()      
1
```

I added two doctests that are very similar to these.  We can probably ignore the patchbot, as it includes heaps of other commits.

Thanks. This passes all doctests.

There is just one more thing that escaped my attention earlier: the following documentation (two instances) should mention "list or tuple" instead of "vector", because sage vectors do not work as input, and only list or tuple does.

Other than this minor thing, I think it is good to go.
