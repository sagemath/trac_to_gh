This should be imported from elsewhere to remove a compile-time dependency on GSL in `sage.symbolic`

```
src/sage/symbolic/pynac_impl.pxi:from sage.libs.gsl.types cimport *
src/sage/symbolic/pynac_impl.pxi:from sage.libs.gsl.complex cimport *
src/sage/symbolic/pynac_impl.pxi:from sage.libs.gsl.gamma cimport gsl_sf_lngamma_complex_e
src/sage/symbolic/pynac_impl.pxi:    cdef gsl_complex res
src/sage/symbolic/pynac_impl.pxi:            res = gsl_complex_log(gsl_complex_rect(real, 0))
src/sage/symbolic/pynac_impl.pxi:        res = gsl_complex_log(gsl_complex_rect(real, imag))
```
