# Issue 25058: k-boundary, k-skew-linked diagram, k-irreducible partitions

Issue created by migration from Trac.

I plan to add a bunch of sage things for the combinatorial k-objects listed.  If code for these things already exists, I would appreciate a heads up.

  * KBoundary class
  * KInterior class
  * KSkewLinkedDiagram class
  * KIrreduciblePartition class

I don't know if all of these things need/should have their own class.  Any useful thoughts are appreciated.

Changing type from PLEASE CHANGE to enhancement.

It seems that classes about kThings use a lowecase k, so I'll follow the same convention (with the exception of "KBoundedQuotientBasis", "KBoundedSubspace", "KBoundedSubspaceBases", which should probably be changed, unless the K stands for Kostka or something special in those cases).

There is a typo in the skew_partition file where it "inner" and "outer" are switched:

"We say
that `p_1` and `p_2` are respectively the *inner* and *outer* partitions of ``skp``."

Here is an interesting question.  Should a kBoundary be a SkewPartition or a SkewTableau?  In other words, should it be merely the shape, or should the cells be filled in with hook lengths?  I think in our minds we visualize a k-boundary with the little hook lengths filled-in.  However, I think the k-boundary as defined should be *only* a SkewPartition.  So that is how I plan to proceed.

Memoirs of the AMS, Volume 223, Number 1050 (fourth of 5 numbers): "The k-boundary of a partition L is the skew shape of cells with hook [length] bounded by k: bdyk(L) = L/interiork(L)."

It seems that k_boundary and k_interior already exist in Partition.  I should be moving/reusing that code I guess but now making kBoundary and kIntererior full-fledged classes?

Indeed, they already exist in sage. They should definitely be partitions and not tableaux. The hook length can easily be computed from the partition and are fixed for a given (skew) partition. What do you want to do with these? It depends on that whether you should make them into classes or not.

When running `sage -t partition.py skew_partition.py k_shape.py` I am getting an error in skew_partition line 568:


```
AttributeError: 'SkewPartitions_all_with_category.element_class' object has no attribute 'is_skew_linked_diagram'
```


full output:


```

I'm hoping this error will go away if I re-build all of sage.  But I got the same error when I tried creating a subclass of `SkewPartition` and putting my method `is_skew_linked_diagram` in the subclass.  Very sad.

Did you run `sage -b`? You need to actually rebuild the Sage source for Sage to know about your changes.

Thanks, Travis!  I'm going to pursue this ticket a lot less aggressively while the code is still being written.  George has suggested that it may be easier to wait until the code has been completed, and then see which parts of the code turn out to be useful, and then migrate that into Sage.

For now, anyone is welcome to use the code here:

Travis,

I am currently stuck on this issue https://ask.sagemath.org/question/42732/codomain-could-not-be-determined/ and sorely in need of help :(  Can you offer any advice?

Matt

Are you at the SageDays at ICERM?

Unfortunately I couldn't make it because I was sick :(  My name is Matthew Lancellotti and I'm building this code for Jennifer Morse.  Jennifer speaks well of you!  Feel free to contact me here, through github, or at ml9nn at virginia dot edu at any time.  Have a nice day!
