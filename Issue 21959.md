ping ? anybody for a review ? this essentially just means checking that the export works as well as before, with a better (more compact) binary format for STL files.

I'll do the review. It's very useful to have it more lightweight. 

Sorry for not reacting before. It's the end of semester in my lab, so everybody is kind of overwhelmed with the everyday work.

I tested with an implicit plot


```
var('x,y,z')
G = implicit_plot3d((x^2+y^2+2*z^2-1/3)^2==((z-1/2)^2-2*x^2)*((z+1/2)^2-2*y^2),(x,-1,1),(y,-1,1),(z,-0.5,0.5))
G.save('implicit.stl')
```


the Moebius surface 


```
from sage.plot.plot3d.parametric_surface import MoebiusStrip
S = MoebiusStrip(1,.2)
S.save('Moebius.stl')
```


and the buckyball polyhedron  


```
G = plot(polytopes.buckyball())
G.all[-1].save('buckyball.stl')
```


I looked at the saved stl files in Blender. They looked fine, normals where coherent when possible. 

One remark, unrelated to the binary format: the implicit plot had some "double points" (points very close to each other) which causes tiny triangles.

so, positive review ?

For the question about tiny triangles, this would be for another ticket maybe. We are using something called a "marching cubes" algorithm. Maybe there is room for improvement, but this is not for me and not for now.

Yes, in principle.
I just had to leave home before all the doctests finished (it's sooo slooow). 
Now I am running them on the cloud, but I had to rebuilt the whole thing first, that's why it is taking some time. As soon as it's done, it will be a positive review. 

Actually, just doctesting sage/plot/plot3d/base.pyx was quite fast and it worked fine. But if I understand well I am supposed to doctest everything, right ?
