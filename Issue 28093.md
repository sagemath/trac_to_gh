# Issue 28093: Cygwin: Use cygstart instead of rundll32 to open files/websites

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28330

Keywords: cygwin browser

Cygwin includes a program called `cygstart` which is effectively like the `open` program, in that it will open URLs in the system's default browser, and will open files, given a file path, in the default application registered for files of that type (if any).

This is similar to the existing hack that was added to sage some time ago of calling rundll32.exe directly.  Unfortunately, this is approach appears to be broken on modern Windows, and/or invokes a User Access Control dialogue asking the user to grant permission to "Make changes to your computer" which, while misleading, is somewhat threatening and/or disconcerting when just trying to open a file.

`cygstart` gets around all this.

In the Windows installer for Sage, I already add `BROWSER=cygstart` to the default environment, so it's not usually a serious problem. But better to also fix this in the code.

Using py2-based or py3-based Sage built from source in Cygwin on Windows 7, and running:

```
sage: tutorial()
```

- before this ticket: nothing happens
- after this ticket: the html page for the tutorial opens in the default browser

This is very nice! Positive review.
