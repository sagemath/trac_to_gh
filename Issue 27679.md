Please review, somebody ? This cuts off slightly sage startup time.

I am a little worried about multiple lazy_import resolutions of the designs stuff. I am wondering if it might be better to lazily import the whole catalog instead. Or do you think I am being paranoid or that we should take the more granular approach?

I think that I tried that first, and was forced to the current solution. I suspect that the line

```
from . import design_catalog as designs
```

may be preventing the lazy import. Let me try again.

This seems to work, let us see if the patchbot turns green.


---

Comment by tscrim created at 2019-06-06 10:25:17

That seems to cause massive breakage on one of the patchbots. `:/`

ok, this was the reason for not doing it. Let me put back my previous branch..

You write that this is all to avoid importing `urllib`.  But is `urllib` a major contributor to start-up time?  `lazy_import` has its own overhead.  Less directly than actually importing one module in many cases.  But is adding _more_ `lazy_imports` actually better in this case than avoiding just one import (urllib)?

Note, I'm all for more lazy_import in general so I'm not changing the ticket status, but I don't understand the motivation here or if it's justified.

I used `sage -startuptime` to see what imported modules could be avoided without too much work. I have seen in the list `email` and `http`. Tracking who imported them lead to `urllib`.

Seems like a bit overkill.  Just loading plain `IPython` causes both the `email` and `urllib` modules to be loaded (but not `urllib.requests` which is showing up in `./sage -startuptime`).  Running the Jupyter notebook is almost certain to ultimately use the others.

Does this definitely shave anything noticeable off the startup time (again, all for it if it does)?

Answering my own question, I noticed an improvement with this patch of ~100-150ms over without it, pretty consistently.  In this game every bit counts, so, +1.

Not in Sage 8.8.  Let's please to try keep tickets' milestones related to the release in which we actually intend to include them, and in particular the release in which they were _actually_ included, especially when closing tickets.
