I think that I tried that first, and was forced to the current solution. I suspect that the line

```
from . import design_catalog as designs
```

may be preventing the lazy import. Let me try again.

You write that this is all to avoid importing `urllib`.  But is `urllib` a major contributor to start-up time?  `lazy_import` has its own overhead.  Less directly than actually importing one module in many cases.  But is adding *more* `lazy_imports` actually better in this case than avoiding just one import (urllib)?

Note, I'm all for more lazy_import in general so I'm not changing the ticket status, but I don't understand the motivation here or if it's justified.

Seems like a bit overkill.  Just loading plain `IPython` causes both the `email` and `urllib` modules to be loaded (but not `urllib.requests` which is showing up in `./sage -startuptime`).  Running the Jupyter notebook is almost certain to ultimately use the others.

Does this definitely shave anything noticeable off the startup time (again, all for it if it does)?
