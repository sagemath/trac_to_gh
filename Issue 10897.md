I have a workaround I am testing for this (patch coming soon) that recognizes some subgroups of permutation groups (including stabilizer subgroups of the symmetric group), and can compute the order very quickly (~600 microseconds).  The running time of foo(200) above is still about a second, because GAP takes that long to construct the stabilizer group and give us back the generators.

In the future, I can add some more cases, or try to develop a more general theory for quickly computing these group orders (the special case I added is based on a argument from graph theory).


```
sage: def foo(n):
....:     G = SymmetricGroup(n)
....:     H = G.stabilizer(n//2)
....:     return H.order()
....: 
sage: %timeit foo(200)
5 loops, best of 3: 935 ms per loop
```

* Change "that" to "for which" below?

 	1322	        # generators of the form ((1, 2), (1, 3), ..., (1, m))
```


* Delete "the order of " below:

```
        1330      "We then know that the order of this group is isomorphic to S_n" -- rewrite
```


* Is there confusion between "n" and "m" in the comments?

* It would be nice to have a doctest like this:

```
sage: [SymmetricGroup(n).stabilizer(1)._gap_().Size() for n in [2..10]]
[1, 2, 6, 24, 120, 720, 5040, 40320, 362880]
sage: [SymmetricGroup(n).stabilizer(1)._order() for n in [2..10]]
[1, 2, 6, 24, 120, 720, 5040, 40320, 362880]

I think it's more an issue of the code review tool we're using, e.g., trac.  For example, http://code.google.com/ has line-by-line code review annotation, and fully supports Mercurial.

Wow, at least one of those doctest failures shows that there is a mistake in this algorithm:

```
sage: G = DihedralGroup(5).cayley_graph().automorphism_group()
sage: sage: G.order()
6
sage: G._gap_().Order()
10
sage: len(list(G))
10
```


I think that the author was perhaps assuming that the generators are all transpositions, but didn't test this:

```
sage: G.gens()
[(1,8)(2,10)(3,4)(5,6)(7,9), (1,10)(2,3)(4,5)(6,7)(8,9)]
sage: G.gens()[0].cycle_tuples()
[(1, 8), (2, 10), (3, 4), (5, 6), (7, 9)]

But in the code in the patch we have

```
1357	            a, b = g.cycle_tuples()[0]
```

It does, sort of, but the .patch file actually had two separate HG commits in it, which "we don't do".  I (the reviewer) have replaced it by a new patch with only one commit, and fixed the patch log description to start with "Trac #10976".
