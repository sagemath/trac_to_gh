Arghs. Needs to check how to rebase(?) this change. It is meant only to change documentation at the beginning of file.

Iteration round 1 for documentation in this file.

Can you say what exactly you did ? The reviewer has to check that you did no *remove* anything from the index, and that everything is in the right category.

If you say that you just sorted the categories then some scripts can be written to check it, but otherwise that's a much bigger amount of work.

> Can you say what exactly you did?

I did almost nothing (in this round, more to come...): just changed phrasing of one-line descriptions as said in PEP 0257. No re-categorizing functions or like.

Oh true, it seems that you removed the 's' at the end of the words. Could you update the first lines of each function too?

I would like to do it later, when going throught the functions. Otherwise this patch will never get accepted because of continuing need to rebase and conflicts with other modifications.
