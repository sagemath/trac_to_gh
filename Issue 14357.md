You are duplicating the citation:

```
[plane_cur] /home/vbraun/opt/sage-5.10.beta2/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/sha_tate.py:docstring of sage.schemes.elliptic_curves.sha_tate.Sha.an_padic:8: WARNING: duplicate citation MTT, other instance in /home/vbraun/opt/sage-5.10.beta2/devel/sage/doc/en/reference/plane_curves/../plane_curves/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/sha_tate.rst
```

I do not have this problem on 5.10.beta1.

The reference is not duplicated in the file itself.

I will try with beta2 when I got it.

no problem either with 5.10.beta2. The doc builds without any warnings.

Sorry for the confusion, stale citation pickle I think...

Maybe I should rather remove the offending Unicode sha ?

No, its a good testcase. Eventually we should just extend the pdf doc build by all unicode code points that we need, and the patch at #14571 is a step in that direction.
