For some reason, passing Python's `time.sleep()` a Sage `RealLiteral` less than 1 returns more-or-less immediately:


```
sage: x = 0.5
sage: type(x)
<class 'sage.rings.real_mpfr.RealLiteral'>
sage: x2 = float(0.5)
sage: type(x2)
<class 'float'>
sage: timeit('sleep(x)')
625 loops, best of 3: 1 µs per loop
sage: timeit('sleep(x2)')
5 loops, best of 3: 500 ms per loop
sage: # One more time for the folks in back...
sage: timeit('sleep(x)')
625 loops, best of 3: 1.01 µs per loop
```


It's not just in the context of `timeit` either.  0.5 is long enough that if you do `sleep(x2)` directly you can feel the delay, whereas with `sleep(x)` there is much less or even no perceptible delay.''

However, 


```
sage: timeit('sleep(1.0)')
5 loops, best of 3: 1 s per loop
```


as expected.

It feels like there's been a bad habit in CPython lately of needlessly breaking support for custom numerical types.

Wait until you see the code. DRY clearly does not apply to the CPython code base: I had to make the same fix 3 times.

Have you seen Sage's code base? ;)

For this ticket 1 time is enough, solved with two line patch:

```diff
--- a/Python/pytime.c
+++ b/Python/pytime.c
@@ -404,9 +404,11 @@
 }

This patch solves only one thing:

```
TypeError: 'sage.rings.real_mpfr.RealLiteral' object cannot be interpreted as an integer
```

and only for `time.sleep()`

I understand that custom builded python is not for everyone.
