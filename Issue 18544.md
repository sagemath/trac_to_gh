This is so that one can use the original names of upstream tarballs. 
See #10879, whose upstream is called .....tgz

Also, perhaps .zip files should be supported as well by the spkg scripts, if possible.
See #18708.

Really it shouldn't make any assumptions on the file name; It is specified in checksum.ini + package-version.txt. Would be easy to fix with #18748

Certainly not `.zip` since `sage-spkg` does not support `unzip`, nor do we currently have an `unzip` package.

Python's zipfile module can easily be used to unzip
