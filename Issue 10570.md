I verified the examples using Mathematica, but can't comment on the rest of the ticket. 

I think it's useful to indicate how the results are known to be correct. In this case I agree they are.

I applied the patch to sage-4.7.rc2, did 'sage -b', and then ran
'make testlong'.  All tests passed.  Positive review.
