The test I've added highlights how the edges of a facial cycle in a planar graph become a vertex bond in the dual.

The commit I made looks like it modified a lot of methods, but it just took some lines filled with only spaces and replaced them with blank lines. I hope that's okay. I can revert it or make other idiomatic changes if desired.

Since this isn't a bug, I would suggest something more explicit about what is going on, such as:

```diff
-:trac:`27832`::
+This also keeps track of edge labels::
```

Also, since it is not a dummy index

```diff
-verts = [tuple(_) for _ in self.faces()]
+verts = [tuple(f) for f in self.faces()]
```

Done and done.

Replying to [comment:4 tscrim]:

That's how the vertex list was constructed before. It did strike me as odd but I wasn't aware it made a difference.

`_` is a valid variable name, but I have been told a general convention is that `_` should only be used when the iterating object is not used in the iterator, e.g.

```
[5 for _ in range(10)]
```

When you do `e = e.pop()`, we have a single edge not only not because `self is simple`, but also because we consider 3-connected graphs only. 
For instance, this method will raise an error if the graph is a cycle, or for any graph obtained by subdividing the edges of a 3-connected planar graph. In both cases we would get several edges in the set `e`.

May be you should clarify this in the code.
