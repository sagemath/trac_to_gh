I also included the `PartitionAlgebra` from `diagram_algebras.py` while we are at it. If you agree with my addition, then positive review.

Does this mean that we have two implementation of the same thing ?

ok, let it be. The file partition_algebras is clearly in a "needs care" state, but
this is not for this ticket.

Replying to [comment:4 chapoton]:

Yes, but it corresponds to the `PartitionAlgebra_ak` (with a different implementation of indexing set of the basis). Likewise with `BrauerAlgebra` and `PartitionAlgebra_bk` (although I'm not sure about the half version of the latter), along with `PlanarAlgebra` and `PartitionAlgebra_pk`.

Agreed.

Actually, question: should we use `PlanarAlgebra` for `PlanarPartition` instead of `PartitionAlgebra_pk`? IMO, the classes in `diagram_algebra.py` are the way to go moving forward.

Well, planar algebra has another meaning (in subfactor theory)

I would prefer to keep PlanarPartition, unless you have a better name (Noncrossing Partitions ??)

I'm not saying change the name, but asking which implementation should we use.

oh, indeed. Here is the list of things in diagram_algebra:

```
class DiagramAlgebra(CombinatorialFreeModule):
class PartitionAlgebra(DiagramAlgebra):
class SubPartitionAlgebra(DiagramAlgebra):
class BrauerAlgebra(SubPartitionAlgebra):
class TemperleyLiebAlgebra(SubPartitionAlgebra):
class PlanarAlgebra(SubPartitionAlgebra):
```

I would agree to expose all of them (or maybe not `SubPartitionAlgebra` and `DiagramAlgebra`) and hide all the things in partition_algebras

I will do that (those two classes you mention are ABCs IIRC).
