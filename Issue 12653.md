1. GCC-4.7.x on ia64 is very broken.  We should install GCC in this case.  Note that currently it won't actually work as MPIR and MPFR fail to build with gcc-4.7.x on ia64.  For MPIR, see #11616.

2. When Debian multiarch is detected, do not install GCC.  The stderr of "gcc -v -E -x c /dev/null" says:

Maybe a leading space or `grep '[^=]/usr/include/.'` is sufficient?

I'd still change the `grep` pattern to not match typical `--with-gxx-include-dir` `configure` options.

Btw., it seems Ubuntu / Debian changed the multi-arch stuff in 12.04 such that there only setting `LIBRARY_PATH`  would be necessary (unless one created symbolic links for `crt?.o`); i.e., there's now a symbolic link from `/usr/include/asm/` to (e.g.) `x86_64-linux-gnu/asm/`.  (Dan, can you confirm that?  In your case it would presumably be a link to `i386-linux-gnu/asm/`.)

----

According to GCC bugzilla, the two bugs referred to for [FSF] GCC 4.6.![01] are both fixed in 4.6.1, so I'm not sure whether 4.6.1 would be [too] broken for Sage, or on which platforms.

Hmmm, `gcc` should actually be `$CC`, since we tested the version of the latter (and would use that one to build GCC anyway).

The `grep` should be ok, although the safest way would probably be to search for (literally) `multiarch`, which is contained in the configure options (e.g. `--enable-multiarch`), and/or the command line of `cc1` (`-imultiarch <system triplet>`).

GCC 4.6.1 as released doesn't have these bugs, but pre-releases of GCC-4.6.1 do still have those bugs.  Basically I provided a work-around for this GCC bug in some spkg but somebody still had problems because he had a pre-release of GCC 4.6.1 (I don't know whether it came with the system or whether he installed it himself).

Positive review to attachment:12825_change_include_grep.patch, which works correctly in Ubuntu 11.10 and 12.04.

In my 12.04 virtual machine, there's no symlink in `/usr/include`. If I don't set the include paths, gcc fails to build. I don't know about Debian, as I don't have any Debian VMs installed.
