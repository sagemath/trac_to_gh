with PPL providing MIP solver thanks to #20354 and #20351, it becomes important to have an option to ask for integer solutions only. A silly bug is fixed along the way.

`delsarte_bound_additive_hamming_space` should perhaps have a test involving `isinteger=True`?

Looking at the file, perhaps the English transliteration `Kravchuk` should be made an alias for the French transliteration `Krawtchouk`?
