Let us use by default quadratic number fields or QQ instead of the UniversalCyclotomicField, when possible, to define the matrix version of finite Coxeter groups.

This should be faster, hopefully.

Thank you for doing this. This has been something on my todo list for quite some time. I changed the default base ring to `ZZ` for all simply-laced types because it was 3x faster for listing all of the elements of D<sub>4</sub>. For the bilinear form, I just forced the use of the fraction field. If my changes are good, then positive review.
