As Nathann remarked when we were doing the graph symmetry tests it could make sense to add an optional argument to is_vertex_transitive & friends passing the automorphism group. That would be make great sense in order to reduce the number of times the automorphism group is computed in, say the function is_semi_symmetric. 

For some reason I've received many emails of people asking how to check if a graph G is H-*-transitive for a subgroup H of Aut(G). That would of course already be covered if we include the caching thing.

I am too busy to do that myself right now and I am leaving this as an easy TODO ticket in case anyone is willing to do it.

Perhaps we should just cache the result of `.automorphism_group()`, given that we have immutable graphs. And we could have notes in the related functions saying that it uses the cache if the graph is immutable ?

Yes this looks like a good way to do it. Though it we would then need to address separately this new feature of testing transitivity on subgroups of Aut(G) ?

Sorry, I answered on this ticket the first paragraph of the ticket's description, but they are different issues.

I do not believe that the computation that you mention is really a graph feature.... It feels much more like a `PermutationGroup` method: we already have ``AG.is_transitive(domain=X)`` which tests if `AG` is transitive on `X`. We could add to it what ``AG.orbit``  already handle, i.e. orbits of pairs, tuples, etc ...
