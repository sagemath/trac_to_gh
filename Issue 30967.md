# Issue 30967: doctests: Filter out linker warning messages

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31204

Original creator: mkoeppe

Original creation time: 2021-01-07 21:43:55

CC:  jhpalmieri dimpase fbissey

(from #30589)

On OS X Big Sur + various homebrew packages, if I use

```
% ./configure --with-system-python3=no --enable-download-from-upstream-url 
```

then Sage builds (if I also incorporate various other changes from #30651), but I get doctest failures of the form

```
File "src/sage/misc/sagedoc.py", line 646, in sage.misc.sagedoc.format
Failed example:
    cython('\n'.join(cython_code))
Expected nothing
Got:
    ld: warning: dylib (/usr/local/lib/libmpfr.dylib) was built for newer macOS version (11.0) than being linked (10.9)
    ld: warning: dylib (/usr/local/lib/libgmp.dylib) was built for newer macOS version (11.0) than being linked (10.9)
    ld: warning: dylib (/usr/local/lib/libgmpxx.dylib) was built for newer macOS version (11.0) than being linked (10.9)
    ld: warning: dylib (/usr/local/lib/libgsl.dylib) was built for newer macOS version (11.0) than being linked (10.9)
    ld: warning: dylib (/usr/local/lib/libntl.dylib) was built for newer macOS version (11.0) than being linked (10.9)
```

We should filter out these warnings in doctesting.

I've only seen this on OS X. The following has worked for me, although it hasn't been thoroughly tested:

I can produce a branch easily enough.

Looks fine to me. I briefly looked to find instances of this on Linux in GH Actions logs, but did not find anything, it's likely that I have confused this with something else.

This doesn't quite catch all of the warnings:

I'm not sure why the "..." doesn't capture all of this. Maybe it matches the verbatim "..." in the doctest output, or maybe it doesn't capture multiline strings.

I modified the filter a bit, starting it with "dylib..." instead of "ld: warning: dylib...", since I've seen a few cases without "ld: warning".

Comment by @zlscherr created at 2021-02-03 01:24:49

I was doing some testing today and could, for example, eliminate these warnings by doing something like:

MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=11.0 ./sage -t --random-seed=0 src/sage/docs/instancedoc.pyx

I think the underlying problem lies in the python that sage is using.  You can see this, for example, by running sage and trying



```
import sysconfig
sysconfig.get_config_var("MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET")
```


the issue is that the homebrew libraries were built on a particular operating system with its own deployment target, which is newer than the python target of sage.  This problem also manifests itself in #31227 where /usr/bin/python3 has the target set to 10.14.6 for some reason.

I wonder if you can try to fix this by making sage set MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET environment variable when it's run.  You can probably get away with just setting it to whatever version of the Mac operating system you are on.

I like the idea but I'm not getting it to work:

```
% MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=11.2 ./sage
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

sage: sysconfig.get_config_var("MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET")                                
'10.9'
```

Maybe part of the solution is #18272: we should not be artificially setting `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET`. That may only help when we are using Sage's own Python, but I think this problem also arises with `/usr/bin/python3` or the homebrew Python 3.

Comment by @zlscherr created at 2021-02-03 02:46:25

What happen's if you try


```
MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=11.0 ./sage -t src/sage/misc/sagedoc.py
```


That won't change sysconfig's deployment target, but it might stop the linking warnings.

(I just ran make distclean for some reason and won't be able to test until tomorrow)


---

Comment by @zlscherr created at 2021-02-03 18:29:26

ok, that definitely didn't work.  For some reason that seemed to work with /usr/bin/python3 but not with the sage built python which is built for target 10.9


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2021-02-03 19:40:52

We should definitely stop arbitrarily defining `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET`, the main use for it is producing binaries that are backward compatible up to a point. We shouldn't have any business setting it to something else than the host building system value unless we make a binary build.


---

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2021-02-04 04:12:28

I've posted a branch at #18272 to stop defining `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET`. I've only tested it on Big Sur, but so far it's pretty good. I am still hitting these "ld" warning messages when building with `/usr/bin/python3` (but not with homebrew or with Sage's own Python), so we will still need this ticket. I'm testing whether

```
% MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=11.0 make ptestlong
```

works when Sage is built with `/usr/bin/python3` on top of #18272.

Changing status from needs_review to needs_info.


---

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2021-02-04 04:18:18

Marking as "needs info" because the suggestion from comment:9 may be the right approach, and it would be better than filtering out the warnings.


---

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2021-02-04 19:15:01

I like gh-zlscherr's suggestion, but what is the right way to do it?

1. unconditionally (on OS X only, I mean) set `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` before running doctests?
2. set it conditionally based on some test of Python? If so, what test?
3. don't set it at all, but print a message (either always or conditionally) suggesting that the user might set it?
4. something else?

Do we set it in `src/bin/sage-runtests` or somewhere else?

Changing priority from major to critical.


---

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2021-03-13 21:58:26

Maybe we should filter out the warnings and on separate tickets deal with the underlying issue of setting `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET`. For example: I don't see the warnings at all on OS X 11.2 using homebrew's Python, but when Sage builds its own Python, I can't eliminate the warnings by setting `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` during doctesting.

+1 for this strategy.

Let's get this ticket into Sage 9.3. https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/actions/runs/649866485 tests this ticket together with #31492 - but there seems to be a scarcity of macOS runners on GH Actions at the moment

It is, and the only thing I can think is to change the doctest:
