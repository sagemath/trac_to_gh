After fixing #19012 it appears that there is another problem

```
sage: K.<phi> = NumberField(x^2-x-1, embedding=1.618)
sage: P1 = Polyhedron([[0,1],[1,1],[1,-phi+1]])
sage: P2 = Polyhedron(ieqs=[[-1,-phi,0]])
sage: P1.intersection(P2).vertices_list()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
AssertionError
```

Hmmmm... Turns out that a vertex is not exactly what I first thought:


```
sage: Polyhedron(ieqs=[[-1,1,1,1]]).vertices()
(A vertex at (0, 0, 1),)
```


What you did here sounds correct regardless `:-P`
