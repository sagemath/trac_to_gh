# Issue 18776: Bug 2 in intersection of polyhedron (generic backend)

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: vdelecroix

CC:  vbraun fchapoton ncohen

After fixing #19012 it appears that there is another problem

```
sage: K.<phi> = NumberField(x^2-x-1, embedding=1.618)
sage: P1 = Polyhedron([[0,1],[1,1],[1,-phi+1]])
sage: P2 = Polyhedron(ieqs=[This is the Trac macro *-1,-phi,0* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#-1,-phi,0-macro))
sage: P1.intersection(P2).vertices_list()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
AssertionError
```

Hmmmm... Turns out that a vertex is not exactly what I first thought:


```
sage: Polyhedron(ieqs=[This is the Trac macro *-1,1,1,1* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#-1,1,1,1-macro)).vertices()
(A vertex at (0, 0, 1),)
```


What you did here sounds correct regardless `:-P`
