I have now successfully started SAGE. My problem was using "The
Unarchiver" to open the compressed file. (The Unarchiver.app is
available at http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/system_disk_utilities/theunarchiver.html.)
When I used the standard shell tools gunzip and tar to install SAGE,
everything worked fine. I assume this has been the problem all along.
This might be worth a warning to other Mac users.

Thanks, Max

Possibly invalid because of the switch to DMGs?
