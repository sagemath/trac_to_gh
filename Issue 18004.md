CC:  @vbraun @nathanncohen

Construction of polytopes with number field coordinates are very slow. There are several reasons for that:
- quadratic number field element hash is slow (already solved in #18215)
- `NumberField.__cmp__` is slow
- we can avoid many useless copies and recomputation in the algorithm `Vrep2Hrep` and `Hrep2Vrep`

After applying the branch the speedup is really cool...

Before

```
sage: %runfile polyhedron_test.py
sage: %time gr = great_rhombicuboctahedron()
CPU times: user 4.66 s, sys: 24 ms, total: 4.68 s
Wall time: 4.66 s
```
After

```
sage: %runfile polyhedron_test.py
sage: %time gr = great_rhombicuboctahedron()
CPU times: user 292 ms, sys: 28 ms, total: 320 ms
Wall time: 306 ms
```

(But I am still not able to build the [600-cell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/600-cell))

Oh, okay. Then change the cache's name please

Then should it be really fixed inside of this class? Or do we keep this code as it is and try to solve the #18231 instead.

> The function just constructs a matrix, why the name is badly chosen? You will get the very same answer as calling `matrix(self.problem.base_ring(), data)`. Except that it is faster.


Precisely because the name does not reflect the difference. `matrix_from_cached_vector_space` does.

> What about `.build_matrix` and `.build_matrix_space`?


I hate this class already.

> I do not understand you remark about the `if`.


Oh. Well, because all that 'matrix' does is a if. If it is not a function of its own, you just have to copy this 'if' around.

`linear_subspace.matrix` calls `linear_subspace.basis_matrix`. Having aliases is cool, but avoiding using them is cooler ;-)

Great! Thanks. It becomes reasonable to start using the generic backend.

Next step: avoid the recomputation of vertices! The algorithm is currently

```
INPUT: vertices
OUTPUT: (vertices, hyperplanes)
ALGO:
  1. compute hyperplanes from vertices (with no redundancy)
  2. recompute vertices from hyperplanes (with no redundancy)
  3. return (vertices, hyperplanes)
```
And it is precisely step 2 which takes an infinite amount of time for the 600-cell!
