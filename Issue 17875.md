[This SO question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29401669/weighted-graph-drawing-using-sage/) suggests it's not particularly obvious where to look if you want to take a graph determined by a matrix and then have your own vertex labels.  This should be clarified in the constructor documentation and/or with an example or two.
