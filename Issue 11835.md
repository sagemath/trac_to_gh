# Issue 11835: creation of extension field of finite field needs more parameter checking

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/12007

In sage-4.7.2,


```
sage: F = GF(2)
sage: P.<x> = PolynomialRing(F)
sage: H.<h> = GF(2^8, name='h', modulus=x^3+x+1) # 2^8 rather than 2^3
sage:
sage: len(set([h^i for i in xrange(10000)]))
21
```


H is something - but it is not a field!
