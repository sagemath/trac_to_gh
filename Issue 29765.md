CC:  jhpalmieri heluani

currently WARNINGs are treated as errors, and we filter out harmless ones. Since Sphinx 3.0, docbuilds are localised, and fail if locale is e.g. French, cf. 

https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-release/7wBxNRbJaaU/hzptnsQpCQAJ

setting LANG=C provides a workaround.

FWIW

`LANG=C.UTF-8 make` succeeds.

With qualification : after this (successful) build of the documentation, `make` in an environment where `LANG` is fr_FR.utf-8 //fails//. `LANG=C.UTF-8 make` succeeds.

In other words, any use of `make` entailing an attempt to make/check the domumentation will fail if LANG amounts to french...

this should do the job, but we should have also have a long hard look at the mess of favicon and other warnings. Sphinx people [say](https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues/4860) that

There are also still some apparent leftovers of sagenb, e.g. stuff in `src/sage/ext_data/images/` - all of it added by commit `0f0517c0c90`:

    Added a dir "images", and put in several static images for the notebook.

and never touched ever since.

Nevermind, I  had not applied it yet. Sorry for the noise. 

In my system this patch results in a lot of warnings: 


```
bash: warning: setlocale: LC_ALL: cannot change locale (C.UTF-8)
```


I suppose this is because of 

```
$ locale -a
C
en_US.utf8
POSIX
```

I missed this message, it does not break anything that I can see, it's arch linux, I only generate those locales by default:

```
$ grep -v '^#' /etc/locale.gen
en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8
```
