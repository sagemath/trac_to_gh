# Issue 15442: ld cannot find libsingular on Cygwin64.

It seems ld on Cygwin64 does not look for .so extension and so fails to find libsingular.so.

The changes to src/sage/libs/singular/function.pyx mean that I can't rebuild sage with OS X 9.1.  The key error messages are 

```
sage/libs/singular/function.cpp:11286:90: error: invalid conversion from 'sleftv*' to 'int' [-fpermissive]
sage/libs/singular/function.cpp:11323:38: error: no matching function for call to 'sleftv::Copy(sleftv**)'
```

I don't think this ticket modified that file, did it?

Ah.  I didn't understand that a commit could be listed under two tickets.  Having found the commit, I think I just searched for tickets in which you were an author and the summary contained singular.

I see now that the problem I had has been picked up in sage-release.  Sorry for bothering you.

This one is also Cygwin64 specific.
