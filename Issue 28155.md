Python3 introduce a new attribute `__weakref__` in the datastructure for classes in addition to `__dict__`. As such, this attribute should not be copied over by `dynamic_class`. Otherwise we get errors, typically upon introspection:
```
    sage: from inspect import getmembers
    sage: c = EllipticCurve([0,0,1,-1,0])
    sage: getmembers(c)
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
    <ipython-input-5-bef5f5512029> in <module>()
    ----> 1 getmembers(c)

    /opt/sage-git/local/lib/python3.7/inspect.py in getmembers(object, predicate)
    339         # looking in the __dict__.
    340         try:
--> 341             value = getattr(object, key)
    342             # handle the duplicate key
    343             if key in processed:

    TypeError: descriptor '__weakref__' for 'Sets.ParentMethods' objects doesn't apply to 'EllipticCurve_rational_field_with_category' object
```
The same error can be triggered by calling directly `c.__weakref__`.

This can be reduced down to:
```
        sage: class A:
        ....:     pass
        sage: A.__weakref__
        <attribute '__weakref__' of 'A' objects>
        sage: Foo1 = sage.structure.dynamic_class.dynamic_class("Foo", (), A)
        sage: "__weakref__" in Foo1.__dict__
        True
```
(should be False).

This ticket fixes this.

(FWIW `__weakref__` is not new, just this error, but the fact it was being copied is a mistake)

moving milestone to 9.0 (after release of 8.9)
