I am guessing that this could be a problem for pexpect interfaces, like the one for fricas.  We are going to hit the limit with `factorial(1558)`.

Well, Python is clearly using a quadratic time algorithm for this while GMP is using a subquadratic algorithm.  I wish that Python had at least improved their algorithm when they hit this bug, rather than just setting a limit like this.


```
sage: s = '1'*1000000
sage: %time x = int(s)
CPU times: user 4.65 s, sys: 0 ns, total: 4.65 s
Wall time: 4.64 s
sage: %time x = Integer(s)
CPU times: user 32.1 ms, sys: 8.25 ms, total: 40.3 ms
Wall time: 40.3 ms
```


My vote would be to [set](https://docs.python.org/3.10/library/stdtypes.html#int-max-str-digits) the limit to either 0 (unlimited) or 1000000 at Sage startup.  Of course, Sage Integers will be unaffected.

Similar pet peeve -- Python's arbitrary precision integer arithmetic is overall still asymptotically slow, whereas Chrome's V8 has huge integer arithmetic that is asymptotically "competitive" with GMP (using BigInt).  Python should too.

This is in my dev console in Chrome:

```
> n = BigInt('1'.repeat(1000000))
11111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111â€¦111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111n
> t=new Date(); s=n.toString(); new Date() - t
207
```


Both Safari and Firefox refuse to make large integers and complain "Out of memory".  So +1 to V8 here.  The code isn't too complicated either.
