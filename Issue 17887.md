CC:  sage-combinat @anneschilling @nthiery @nathanncohen @nexttime @bsalisbury1 @tscrim

On a system without dot2tex installed:

```
sage: P = posets.PentagonPoset()
An exception has occurred, use %tb to see the full traceback.

SystemExit: 1

To exit: use 'exit', 'quit', or Ctrl-D.
```
I believe the problem is coming from this:

```
sage: from sage.graphs.dot2tex_utils import have_dot2tex
sage: have_dot2tex()
An exception has occurred, use %tb to see the full traceback.

SystemExit: 1

To exit: use 'exit', 'quit', or Ctrl-D.
```
which is obviously wrong and extremely confusing to users - surely poset creation is independent of TeX!

And it looks like the optional package dot2tex IS installed, but there is no dot2tex itself.

That's "new-style spkg" weirdness:

The old one (2.8.7.p2) is a real spkg, and listed on `.../packages/optional/`.

The new one (2.9.0dev) has its package metadata only shipped with newer versions of Sage (part of the "unified" git tree, such that you cannot install it on older Sage versions); its corresponding upstream tarball is available as [http://sagemath.org/packages/upstream/dot2tex/dot2tex-20120520.tar.bz2](http://sagemath.org/packages/upstream/dot2tex/dot2tex-20120520.tar.bz2).

Did you try to reinstall it with `sage -f dot2tex`?  (Note that at least GraphViz is a prerequisite of it.)

Tons of errors, GraphViz is not installed. The issue, however, is that I am not trying to make any pictures! Changes that I think have to be done (either one will suffice, but both are better):
1. Check that things work properly, i.e. don't crash if they don't work.
2. Check that prerequisites are installed during installation of dot2tex and fail if they are not available.

I does not look like #17171 addresses the first point, not sure about the second one.

Yes.  I could reproduce the errors you reported on a previously TeX-free system, but only after installing dot2tex (without `-c`, otherwise the installation would have failed).

Installing GraphViz alone didn't help; after installing a couple of additional (La)TeX-related packages the errors in Sage finally vanished, while the number of failures in dot2tex's test suite only decreased.




> The issue, however, is that I am not trying to make any pictures!


Yep, that's odd, although you must have installed dot2tex at some point... ;-)  (So the ticket's title is somewhat misleading.)




> Changes that I think have to be done (either one will suffice, but both are better):

Agreed, a non-working dot2tex installation shouldn't affect rather unrelated things, especially since you cannot (easily) uninstall dot2tex.




>  2. Check that prerequisites are installed during installation of dot2tex and fail if they are not available.


Yep, some minimal prerequisite check should probably be performed in its `spkg-install`.  (Test suite failures don't necessarily mean dot2tex would be completely unusable, and we normally don't want to run a test suite unless the user explicitly asked for doing so.)




> I does not look like #17171 addresses the first point, not sure about the second one.


Well, not yet, still needs review...

P.S.:  From dot2tex's `SPKG.txt`:

```
## Dependencies

graphviz (www.graphviz.org) should be installed and in the path (for
example via the graphviz spkg).

preview, a LaTeX package for extracting parts of a document.
```

Necessary, but presumably not sufficient (at least to make 2.9.0dev's test suite pass), but perhaps the packages I installed are also too old.
