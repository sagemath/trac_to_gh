I regenerated some of the patches we maintain for R, from a repository based on R 3.3.3, the current version in Sage since #20523.  So the new patches should apply more cleanly.  I also updated a few of the patches slightly:

* Updated `hardcoded_dirs.patch` so that it only takes action if `$SAGE_LOCAL` is actually set.  Otherwise it would set an invalid `$R_HOME_DIR`.  This was confusing for testing the validity of the patch set outside the context of Sage.

* The original `m4_macro_bug.patch` only patched the m4 script, but did not update the `configure` script with the resulting changes.

* The patches for Cygwin were not being applied (see [comment:13:ticket:22627]).  This fixes that, but also reworks the original `cygwin.patch` in such a way that it doesn't break building on other platforms.  Instead it includes new logic for handling a DLL import library (referred to as `LDLIB`) that is only used where relevant (I think this would useful to MinGW as well but we're not worrying about that right now).

This fixes building R 3.3.3 on Cygwin.

Looks like the Cygwin aspect of this still needs work, as building rpy2 demonstrates for me.  I'm not sure libR.dll is being installed in the correct place.

Sorry, I think it is this after all.  I can't reproduce the problem on an older branch, and there were no changes to rpy2.  I think it's probably an installation path issue with the new build changes to R.
