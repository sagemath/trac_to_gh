Keywords: gsoc poset linear extension

This is a meta ticket for the following GSoC 2020 project by Stefan Grosser
[Project Proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11r5f2TlPnN4g0jzTXgHz2EZgWkTQT0_XsvGPd_HTy-o/edit?usp=sharing)

The goal will be to add multiple classes to FinitePoset such as d-complete, tree, and mobile, where all of these families have individual interest. Specifically, all of these classes permit efficient computation of the number of linear extensions. 

This will start with Ticket #29686, which will implement the classes. Later tickets will be added to implement computing linear extensions.
