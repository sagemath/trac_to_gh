I have had a look through the patch.  Am I right that almost all the changes are either (1) tidying up whitespace, (2) changing syntax for error raising or (3) small changes to docstring formatting?  I saw almost nothing else.

There are a few places where the syntax of a trac reference is changed but still does not use the :trac:`1234` form.  Is that an oversight?

Otherwise, assuming that all the doctests still pass I see no reason why not to approve this patch, though I am slightly nervous about conflicts with other patches which affect this file.  Specifically, does this apply after #12509?

Ok, here is a new patch, which applies on 5.10.beta3.

I have taken care of the forgotten trac links.

Yes, this patch only does trivial things, but I understand your concerns. I should not have broken anything, I hope I was careful enough. 

By the way, do you know of other coming patches touching this file ?

No -- but of course there might be, we will see.

This patch applies fine to 5.10.beta3, the tests in the touched file all pass, and sage -docbuild reference html works fine (though it did say that no targets were out of date in [schemes] which seems odd.  Nevertheless I think this deserves a positive review as we do not want more delay or it may need rebasing again.

This doesn't apply to sage-5.10.beta4:

```

Hunk #100 FAILED at 2677
Hunk #102 succeeded at 2795 with fuzz 2 (offset 6 lines).
Hunk #103 FAILED at 2797
Hunk #104 FAILED at 2820

```

Sorry Frederic, as I feared there were some new dependencies and beta4 came out after I had done my test.

ok, I will take care of that, but not right now.

This should be good to go. Anybody for a review ?

I checked that the patch applies fine to 5.10.rc0, and did a  complete test, hence another positive review.  Very sorry my delay caused this to miss 5.10 (unless there is to be another rc version -- this patch only affects docstrings!)

Yes, there will be, but since this is a large and unimportant patch, I would rather postpone it.

> this patch only affects docstrings!
Looking at the patch, that's actually far from true...

No problem.

OK I admit that (it's not my patch) -- docstrings, whilespace, and some pyflakes/pep8 tidying.  So, not just docstrings.
