I have had a look through the patch.  Am I right that almost all the changes are either (1) tidying up whitespace, (2) changing syntax for error raising or (3) small changes to docstring formatting?  I saw almost nothing else.

There are a few places where the syntax of a trac reference is changed but still does not use the :trac:`1234` form.  Is that an oversight?

Otherwise, assuming that all the doctests still pass I see no reason why not to approve this patch, though I am slightly nervous about conflicts with other patches which affect this file.  Specifically, does this apply after #12509?

Ok, here is a new patch, which applies on 5.10.beta3.

I have taken care of the forgotten trac links.

Yes, this patch only does trivial things, but I understand your concerns. I should not have broken anything, I hope I was careful enough. 

By the way, do you know of other coming patches touching this file ?

No -- but of course there might be, we will see.

This patch applies fine to 5.10.beta3, the tests in the touched file all pass, and sage -docbuild reference html works fine (though it did say that no targets were out of date in [schemes] which seems odd.  Nevertheless I think this deserves a positive review as we do not want more delay or it may need rebasing again.
