Many doctests depend on nonpackages (softwares external to Sage) installed and available on the system, such as latex, magma, mathematica, maple, etc. This patch allows to run the optional doctests if the nonpackages are available, when you include "nonpackages" value to the "--optional" tag, as in the following example.

sage -t --optional=nonpackages ./src/sage/repl/rich_output/pretty_print.py

This is a rewrite of #18904.

I don't like the fact that you *explicitly* need to specify `--optional=nonpackages`. That's almost as much "effort" as writing `--optional=latex,magma,internet`. Also the name "nonpackages" is a bit strange: why is "octave" a nonpackage?

Also, I don't believe that `have_latex()` is a sufficient test to check that `latex` works. You should really run `latex` to be sure. All the other tests actually run the optional program.

Currently doctests for Sage optional packages, if installed on the system, are automatically run only if "--optional" is given. Doctests for nonpackages are run only if "--optional=nonpackages" is given. Perhaps we should keep this ability because of the performance issues that you mention...

The behavior "--optional" tag has changed after the merged ticket: http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/18558, but the developer's manual seems not updated completely to reflect the changes. The following is from experiments and the documentation. So would you verify my understanding?

(1) "-t" : tests all ordinary doctests and also doctests about installed optional packages, in effect equivalent to "-t --optional=optional".
(2) "-t --optional": no-op
(3) "-t --optional=PKGS":   only run doctests including one of the "# optional - xxx" tags where xxx is listed in PKGS; 
                                     if "sage" is listed will also test the standard doctests; 
                                     if "optional" is listed will also test all available(installed) optional packages; 
                                     if set to "all", then all tests will be run; 
If this is correct, then

(A)  Via this ticket I want to add one more line to (3):

                                    if "external" is listed, then also include all doctests  with "# optional - xxx" where xxx is an available external softwares and resources like "magma", "matlab", "internet", "latex", etc (basically everything that is not a Sage standard or optional package).

(B) Also we can change (1) to equate "-t" to "-t --optional=optional,external".

Do you agree?

Once we implement "external", "all" will mean "sage"+"optional"+"external". Then we may set "-t --optional" to mean "-t --optional=all".

Hmmm. It seems possible... But what do you think it means that "maple" appears in the list? Does it mean that maple is available and tests depending on it will be tested. This behavior defeats the lazy mechanism. Does it simply mean that any doctests depending on maple will run if maple turns out to be available lazily and not otherwise?

I think that the `internet` doctests have to be robust enough that if an external website changes something, our tests will still pass. I tried to argue for this at #16252, but there was disagreement. I think it's either that or we don't enable `internet` testing by default.

For this ticket, I will stop at providing the framework for tests requiring external softwares.  Thus

(1) Any expert is cordially invited to contribute commits for better and new `has_xxx` tester for the software `xxx`.

(2) Turning on `external` by default should be dealt with in another ticket.

(3) Fixing all doctest failures that result from changing the default should be dealt with separate tickets.
