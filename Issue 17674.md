Hello Travis,

Could you add this new function to the index of poset methods, at the top of the file ?

Thanks,

I am sorry I did not notice it earlier, but your doctest has an output which can potentially be architecture dependent, i.e. the list of two posets on 5 and 3 elements.

You can easily fix it by creating a poset with two connected components on 5 elements.
