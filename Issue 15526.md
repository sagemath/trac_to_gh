This patch implements an inverse entropy function.

There is no nice expression for the inverse, so we resort to root finding. For a value of `q` (the base of the logarithm), the function is strictly increasing in the interval `[0, 1-1/q]` and hence has a unique value in this interval.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/15763
