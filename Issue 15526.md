# Issue 15526: Implement an inverse entropy function

This patch implements an inverse entropy function.

There is no nice expression for the inverse, so we resort to root finding. For a value of `q` (the base of the logarithm), the function is strictly increasing in the interval `[0, 1-1/q]` and hence has a unique value in this interval.

Dima.. you should fix your git username. Your hg user name was "Dmitrii Pasechnik" whereas your git one is "Dima Pasechnik". It will come up as a new contributor in sage releases.
