Can we allow Python3.10.1 (which is e.g. default Python3 in alpine/edge)?

That was done in #30766

I seem to have trouble with Python 3.10.1, numpy, and system openblas on alpine, some weird numpy build error.  (might be alpine-specific - #33083)

See attachment for details.

musl libc + system openblas + system python 3.10.1

If I try installing numpy using pip3, I'm getting numpy 1.22.0 (from a wheel)

but it's build fails with essentially the same error

This has nothing to do with this ticket! `numpy` is not touched here.

Could someone please put it back to positive review.

This ticket was always in review. Anyhow, it looks good to me now :-)
