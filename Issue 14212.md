the following is weird:

```
sage: RDF(1/10)-RDF(1)/RDF(10)
-1.38777878078e-17
```

One would expect that the conversion from 1/10 to RDF is done as follows:
- first convert 1 to RDF, which is exact
- then convert 10 to RDF, which is exact
- then divide RDF(1) by RDF(10)

For RR we get as a comparison:

```
sage: RR(1/10)-RR(1)/RR(10) 
0.000000000000000
```


More examples:

```
sage: for p in [1..10]:
....:     for q in [1..10]:
....:         if RDF(p/q) <> RDF(p)/RDF(q):
....:             print p, q
....:             
1 5
1 10
2 5
2 10
4 5

9 5
9 7
9 10
10 3

10 9
```

and for RR:

```
sage: for p in [1..10]: 
....:     for q in [1..10]:
....:         if RR(p/q) <> RR(p)/RR(q):
....:             print p, q

Tracing things back, the conversion eventually gets done by:


```
mpq_get_d(self.value)
```


since `Rational` is just a wrapper around an `mpq`.  This is where the weirdness seems to be.

ok, then the explanation is that `mpq_get_d` (according to the GMP manual) rounds towards zero.

One could call `mpz_get_d(numerator)/mpz_get(denominator)` but then for large numerator and denominator one would get three roundings, instead of only one when calling `mpq_get_d`.

I propose to close this ticket.

As Paul explained, the rounding is the same for RR and RDF: RDF rounds its computations to the nearest. 

Actually, the problem is somewhere else: the conversion from QQ to RDF rounds towards zero, which is not consistent with the general behaviour of RDF.

what is annoying is that RDF and RR give different results. The fact that RR gives `0.0` in that case
is not that important, for example:

> IMHO, this conversion from QQ to RDF should be fixed, if possible. 

it is possible: first call the MPFR function `mpfr_set_q` on the rational fraction
(which is what `RR(p/q)` does) then convert back to `double` with `mpfr_get_d`, but this might be less efficient than the current code, since it would convert from QQ to RR, then from RR to RDF.

Converting separately the numerator and the denominator to RDF, then dividing in RDF does not work,
due to double rounding.
Consider for example the fraction `p/q` where `p=2403806706169061971` and `q=983883817941434958`. If you first round p and q to RDF (say with `mpz_get_d`), then you get
`2403806706169061888/983883817941435008`, which is rounded to nearest to 
`5501555564164225/2251799813685248`, whereas the direct rounding of p/q to nearest gives
`2750777782082113/1125899906842624`:

```
sage: p=2403806706169061971; q=983883817941434958; pp=RR(p); qq=RR(q)
sage: (pp/qq).exact_rational()
5501555564164225/2251799813685248
sage: RR(p/q).exact_rational()

Robert, would the following be ok in what concerns speed?

Let p/q the fraction to be converted to RDF, I assume p, q > 0.

1) multiply p or q by a power of 2 into pp and qq so that both have the same number of bits
   (using mpz_sizeinbase and mpz_mul_2exp from GMP)

2) if pp < qq, multiply pp by 2<sup>54</sup>, otherwise multiply pp by 2<sup>53</sup>, using mpz_mul_2exp

3) now 2<sup>53</sup> <= pp/qq < 2<sup>54</sup>, compute (using mpz_tdiv_qr) the quotient r = trunc(pp/qq) and the
   remainder s; we know that r has exactly 54 bits

4) if r is even, return r*2<sup>k</sup> where k is the normalizing constant (exact since r is exact on 53 bits)

5) if s is not zero, return (r+1)*2<sup>k</sup> [r+1 is even, and exact on 53 bits, even in the
   case where r+1 = 2<sup>54</sup>]

5a) if s=0, return (r-1)*2<sup>k</sup> if the bit of weight 1 of r is 0, otherwise (r+1)*2<sup>k</sup>

I guess mpq_get_d does basically steps 1-4, thus it should be comparable in speed.

here is some tentative code which converts from QQ to RDF with rounding to nearest.
In the usual case where both the numerator and the denominator are less than 2<sup>53</sup> in absolute value, it is about twice as fast as `mpq_get_d`.

```

  size_t na, nb;
  mpz_t aa, bb;
  double d;

  /* easy case: |a|, |b| < 2^53, no overflow nor underflow can occur */

            mpz_sub_ui (aa, aa, 1);
          else
            mpz_add_ui (aa, aa, 1);
        }
      else
        {
          if (mpz_sgn (aa) > 0)
            mpz_add_ui (aa, aa, 1);
          else
            mpz_sub_ui (aa, aa, 1);

    }

  mpz_clear (aa);
  mpz_clear (bb);
  d = mpz_get_d (aa); /* exact */
  return ldexp (d, (long) sa - (long) sb);
}
```

However I don't know where to incorporate that code in Sage. Could someone help?

this was my first idea. Then I realized I was often using say `RDF(1/2^100)`.

Jeroen,

as an author I'm not supposed to review that ticket, but I have a few questions:

- why the `or A.condition()` in `matrix/matrix_double_dense.pyx`?

- in `matrix/matrix_mod2e_dense.pyx` I wonder why you had to change only one value,
  and not all from lines 788 to 811

- in `plot/colors.py` the new value is closer to 2/7 than the old one (as expected):

```
sage: (RR(rainbow(7, 'rgbtuple')[5][0]).exact_rational()-2/7)*1.0
-1.26882631385732e-16
```


- idem in `rings/contfrac.py`:

```
sage: (RR(float(a)).exact_rational()+17/389)*1.0
-1.60539961787057e-18
```


- the test `float(1/10) * 10 == float(1)` is misleading: it might make think that this is now true for any value of q instead of 10, which is wrong (consider q=49).

- efficiency is not that bad in the "easy" case (was 4.8 ms before):

```
sage: l=[a/b for a in [1..99] for b in [1..99]]
sage: %timeit c = map(RDF,l)
100 loops, best of 3: 2.97 ms per loop
```


- we have lost a little in the "general" case (was 5.04 ms before):

```
sage: l=[(2^53+a)/(3^53+b) for a in [1..99] for b in [1..99]]
sage: %timeit c = map(RDF,l)                                 
100 loops, best of 3: 7.38 ms per loop
```


- `q0 = aa/bb / 2^shift` should be `q0 = a/b / 2^shift`

- `|d| <= 2^-1075` should be `|d| < 2^-1075`

- `shift >= 972` can be changed to `shift >= 971`, since for 971 we get `|d| >= 2^1024` and `2^1024` gives infinity

- maybe we can avoid the copy done by `mpz_init_set` and point directly to the corresponding numerator or denominator?

- I would add an example showing that the conversion now agrees with RR:

```
sage: all([RDF(a/b) == RR(a/b) for a in [1..99] for b in [1..99]])
True
```


I see you have dealt with the subnormal case too: great!

I don't think that's true. I read your patch, understood it (so that's a review of your code) and made some modifications. So I think it is perfectly fine if you review the patch.

That's a cool doctest trick I learned recently. If the condition fails, it will output the exact value of `A.condition()` instead of simply returning `False`.

Well, I assume the others are cases where the old and new mpq->double conversion code agree.

> - the test `float(1/10) * 10 == float(1)` is misleading: it might make think that this is now true for any value of q instead of 10, which is wrong (consider q=49).
OK, true. I will remove that test.

I have no idea how to do that in Cython. Besides, we do change the value of `aa` and `bb`, so we need an init anyway.

OK, good idea. I'll also test negative numerators.

I'm fine in giving comments, but I would prefer someone else gives "positive review".

good. I learned something too!

when I did those tests by hand in a vanilla session, I got different values, thus I guess they depend on the seed value, and the previous tests, which is not very good.

you could have different variables to store the quotient and remainder, and split the code
to perform the division directly on a or b.

* in the following test, you can replace 20 by 13. Also, you could add `all([RDF(q) == RR(q) for q  in Q])` which would exercise the code for large numerators and denominators.

```
sage: Q = continued_fraction(pi, bits=3000).convergents()[20:]
sage: RDFpi = RDF(pi) 
sage: all([RDF(q) == RDFpi for q  in Q]) 
```


* is the `except?` value really needed in `mpq_get_d_nearest`?

* please replace `round-to-even` with `round-to-nearest-even`. Round to even and round to odd also exist.

* please replace `occured` by `occurred` (several places, already mentioned)

Apart from that (and if tests still pass) I'm fine with the patch.
