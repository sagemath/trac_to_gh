# Issue 33162: Bug in ExpressionNIce with composite variables

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/33399

Original creator: egourgoulhon

Original creation time: 2022-02-22 12:50:36

CC:  tscrim

In Sage 9.6.beta2, we have

```
sage: from sage.manifolds.utilities import ExpressionNice
sage: u, v = var('u v')
sage: f = function('F')(u + v)
sage: f
F(u + v)
sage: ExpressionNice(diff(f, u))
d(F)/d(u + v)
```

So far, so good, but

```
sage: f = function('F')(u - v)
sage: ExpressionNice(diff(f, u))
d(F)/du - v
```

This bug has been reported in https://groups.google.com/g/sage-support/c/fbE0APqThEk

Thank you for the review. Here is a new version, which avoids `import re`.

What do you think about the new version? Sorry for having pushed it after your positive review, but I thought this rewriting was better than the quick fix I first submitted, especially because it relies on standard Python, without the need of importing the `re` module.

This version is also fine. Note though that `re` *is* part of the Python standard library.

Thank you!

You are right; I should have said _basic_ Python, instead of _standard_ Python. My concern was actually the CPU performance: it's always better to avoid an import, isn't it? (unless of course the function you import does the job more efficiently).

This module is already widely used by pretty much everything, so it's likely to be already loaded. And it's likely to be faster than doing the loop over the characters in the new version. But I don't think it matters.
