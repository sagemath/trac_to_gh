Keywords: polyhedra, dilation

The new dilation with #29200 shows us two bugs:


```
sage: 2*Polyhedron([[]], backend='cdd')
...
TypeError ...
```


and


```
sage: K.<sqrt2> = QuadraticField(2)
sage: sqrt2*Polyhedron(backend='normaliz')
...
AttributeError
```


There are two tiny fixes to it:
- Make sure to tell the empty polyhedron appart at `Polyhedron_base.__init__`.
- Add a trivial equation for initialization of the universe polyhedron with backend `cdd`.

#29842 will add doctests to this.

What also doesn't work for `cdd` and this is how the `TestSuite` detected the problem is `2*Polyhedron(backend='cdd')`. The problem is that it tries to discover the action via

`parent(Polyhedron(backend='cdd')).an_element()`, which is `Polyhedron([[]], backend='cdd')`.

I think you should add a doctest that more specifically illustrates this subtle point of the behavior of `Polyhedron_base.__init__` when generators are involved.

inequalites -> inequalities.

I will improve this.

The reason for using generators is that we don't have to build a list/tuple that is possibly discarded. Once we are there, we need to generate all the generators. Of course it might be better if you can really just generate them, when you feed them to the backend, but the backends require that you don't call `_init_from_Vrepresentation`, when vertices and rays and lines are empty. So we should respect that.
