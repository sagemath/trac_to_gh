This metaticket collects tickets related to manifolds in Sage 9.3 or higher. For the initial implementation of manifolds in Sage up to version 9.2, see the metaticket 1: #18528. 

The works listed here result from the [SageManifolds project](http://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/), developed by the following [authors](http://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/authors.html).
