Thanks for the report. What authentication method did you select?
Username and password? Google? Other?

We need more details, i just created a password-protected account without problem.

Signing in using Google authentication was broken,
but is fixed now.

Hopefully this also solves account creation using
Google accounts.

Thanks to Thierry Monteil for fixing this!
And thanks again for the report.
