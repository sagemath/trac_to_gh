# Issue 21036: Clean up of mpfi interface and rings/real_mpfi.pyx

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/21273

Original creator: fbissey

Original creation time: 2016-08-18 00:43:04

The current `sage/libs/mpfi.pxd` files defines some mpfi function that are for internal use only and are not defined in mpfi.h anymore. Two of these functions are then used in `sage/rings/real_mpfi.pyx`.

Spotted from QA warnings in sage-on-gentoo.
