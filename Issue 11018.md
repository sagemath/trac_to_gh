That is really vague. What I mean is what is described at [this ask.sagemath.org](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/498/composite-function) request.

```

var('x,y,z,t')

g(t) = (t, t^2, t^3)

f(x,y,z) = (2x,y+x+z,yx)
```

wants to have f(g(t)) 'just work', though one poster points out that `f(*g(t))` does. 

We'd want this to work for explicit vector objects, too.

#11507 is related, but separate.
