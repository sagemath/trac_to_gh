Here are some tests:

involving the unknown as exponent:


```
sage: solve((2/3)^x-2, x)
[3^x == 2^(x - 1)] # not explicit x = ..
sage: giac('solve((2/3)^x-2, x)')
list[ln(2)/(ln(2)-ln(3))]  # ok
```


from #3745:


```
sage: sage: solve((sin(x) - 8*cos(x)*sin(x))*(sin(x)^2 + cos(x)) - (2*cos(x)*sin(x) - sin(x))*(-2*sin(x)^2 + 2*cos(x)^2 - cos(x)), x) 
[x == pi, x == 1/2*pi, x == 0]  # wrong
sage: giac('solve((sin(x) - 8*cos(x)*sin(x))*(sin(x)^2 + cos(x)) - (2*cos(x)*sin(x) - sin(x))*(-2*sin(x)^2 + 2*cos(x)^2 - cos(x)), x)')
list[-2*atan(sqrt(2)),0,2*atan(sqrt(2)),pi]  # ok
```
