This can even lead to disaster, I think:

```
sage: F = (4*cos(9*pi/180)^2 - 3)*(4*cos(27*pi/180)^2 - 3)
sage: F.maxima_methods().trigrat()
sqrt(5) + 2*cos(7/10*pi) - 2*cos(1/10*pi) - 2*I*sin(3/5*pi) +
2*I*sin(2/5*pi) + 1
```

I really am not interested in seeing `I` turn up in such a simplification, regardless of the "correct" answer.

Oh, that's silly. I'm setting it back to "needs review" to make the report visible for now. Hopefully we can have this fixed.

While this one could be resolved by adding a `trigreduce` to the queue:

```
sage: F = (4*cos(9*pi/180)^2 - 3)*(4*cos(27*pi/180)^2 - 3)
sage: F.maxima_methods().trigrat()
sqrt(5) + 2*cos(7/10*pi) - 2*cos(1/10*pi) - 2*I*sin(3/5*pi) +
2*I*sin(2/5*pi) + 1
sage: _.maxima_methods().trigreduce()
sqrt(5) - 2*cos(3/10*pi) - 2*cos(1/10*pi) + 1
```

I cannot see how to fix the doctest failure:

```
File "src/doc/de/thematische_anleitungen/sage_gymnasium.rst", line 394, in doc.de.thematische_anleitungen.sage_gymnasium
Failed example:
    (sin(x + y)/(log(x) + log(y))).simplify_full()
Expected:
    (cos(y)*sin(x) + cos(x)*sin(y))/log(x*y)
Got:
    ((-I*arctan2(0, x) - I*arctan2(0, y))*sin(x + y) + log(abs(x)*abs(y))*sin(x + y))/(arctan2(0, x)^2 + 2*arctan2(0, x)*arctan2(0, y) + arctan2(0, y)^2 + log(abs(x))^2 + 2*log(abs(x))*log(abs(y)) + log(abs(y))^2)
```

the minimal case being

```
sage: log(x).maxima_methods().trigrat()
I*arctan2(0, x) + log(abs(x))
```
