# Issue 22414: symbolic AppellF1

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/22651

Original creator: rws

Original creation time: 2017-03-20 09:25:10

Pynac already has a symbolic AppellF1. This ticket would implement the interface. The main problem seems to provide numerics as there is no library whatsoever providing this. An arb ticket was already opened:

This commit does no numerics but this would suffice for the purposes of #22650.
