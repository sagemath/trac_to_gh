# Issue 23387: 0 should not be a primitive root

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: dkrenn

Original creation time: 2017-08-16 08:59:51


```
sage: mod(0, 17).is_primitive_root()
```

should return `False`.

This also fixes the issue with `p^j` being a primitive root mod `p^k` where `p` is an odd prime.

I think `0` is considered a primitive root mod `1`.

LGTM (modulo patchbot), however, I think a second reviewer should have a look (I created this patch out of the fix proposed on the sage-devel mailing list)

Fine with me as well, subject to tests succeeding.
