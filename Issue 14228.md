Assignee: sage-combinat

Keywords: hash, set

The following code raises an exception:


```
sage: S=Set(ZZ).union(Set([infinity]))
sage: hash(S)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
RuntimeError: maximum recursion depth exceeded
```


The same should happen for intersections, differences, and symmetric differences.
