CC:  sage-combinat @anneschilling


When constructing elements of a crystal of tableaux, the entries are
converted to crystal letters if they are not yet such::


```
    sage: T = CrystalOfTableaux(['A',3], shape = [2,2])
    sage: t = T(list=[3,1,4,2])
    sage: t
    [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
    sage: type(t[0])
    <class 'sage.combinat.crystals.letters.ClassicalCrystalOfLetters_with_category.element_class'>
    sage: type(t[1])
    <class 'sage.combinat.crystals.letters.ClassicalCrystalOfLetters_with_category.element_class'>
```


However this is currently not the case if the entries are plain int's::

```
    sage: t = T(list=[int(3),1,4,2])
    sage: type(t[0])
    <type 'int'>
    sage: type(t[1])
    <type 'sage.rings.integer.Integer'>
```


Possible fix: have CrystalOfTableauxElement.__init__ check whether
list[0] is not an instance of parent.letters.element_class instead of
testing for an Integer.

Another (more subtle) bug which comes from the same issue:


```
sage: C = KirillovReshetikhinCrystal(['A',int(4),1], 1,1)
sage: C[0].e0()
# Boom
AttributeError: 'int' object has no attribute 'epsilon'
```

The problem seems to be in that elements are created from `C.cartan_type().n` somewhere (I didn't track this down).

I've uploaded my fix for this which automatically calls the `CrystalOfLetters` on each element in the list (which should just type check and return the element back if it already is a letter). There is a slight performance hit (see below) for doing this rather than just checking the leading element. Also this takes care of input like:


```
sage: t = T(list=[T.letters(3),1,4,2])
sage: t = T(list=[CrystalOfLetters(['D',6])(3),1,4,2])
```

(Note CrystalOfLetters checks (well lack thereof) are not robust enough to catch the second input as an error, but that's a separate issue.) Really the question boils down to how pathological do we think the users might be with this versus the speed hit? If people think this is a good fix, this is ready to review.

Thanks,
 Travis

Hi Travis,

Thanks for looking into this. In principle your solution is good, though I am not so happy about the performance loss. Also, it might be better to spell out the problem before your added test in the patch than (or in addition) to refer to this ticket.

Best,

Anne

```

Here's a few other things I've tried:

With first checking an `isinstance()`:

```
letters_type = type(parent.letters) # It was slightly slower to put this in the lambda function
letters_check = lambda x: x if isinstance(x, letters_type) else parent.letters(x)
TensorProductOfCrystalsElement.__init__(self, parent, map(letters_check, list))

sage: %timeit L = [x for x in B]
5 loops, best of 3: 661 ms per loop
```


By using the `in` check:

```
letters_check = lambda x: x if x in parent.letters else parent.letters(x)
TensorProductOfCrystalsElement.__init__(self, parent, map(letters_check, list))

sage: %timeit L = [x for x in B]
5 loops, best of 3: 852 ms per loop
```


Here's my baseline timing with the current patch:

```
sage: %timeit L = [x for x in B]
5 loops, best of 3: 610 ms per loop
```
