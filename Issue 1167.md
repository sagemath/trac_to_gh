On page 2.4.1 of the Sage Tutorial ("Univariate Polynomials"), the word "interderminant" should be "indeterminate".

On page 2.4.2 of the Tutorial "Next lets do some arithmetic" should be "Next let's do some arithmetic".

On page 2.5 of the Tutorial "the Euler's \phi-function" should be "Euler's \phi function".

On page 2.5.1 of the Tutorial "we construct the group of Dirichlet character mod 20" should read "we construct the group of Dirichlet characters mod 20".
