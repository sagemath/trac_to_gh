# Issue 17638: Doctest failures with group-writeable umask

Issue created by migration from Trac.

The recently-updated setuptools fails with group-writeable umasks:

```
doctest:1224: UserWarning: /mnt/disk/home/release/.sage//.python-eggs is writable by group/others and vulnerable to attack when used with get_resource_filename. Consider a more secure location (set with .set_extraction_path or the PYTHON_EGG_CACHE environment variable).
```

Also, update to setuptools 12.4 (though that alone doesn't help)

OK, I see what you mean by "that alone doesn't help", have you put a pull request upstream as they requested?

Yes, at https://bitbucket.org/pypa/setuptools/pull-request/124/

I am assuming from the conversation upstream that it will indeed be pulled so +.
