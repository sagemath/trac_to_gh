This is a good move.

The logic in the following is weird

```
fld = map(lambda fnc : fnc(R), [is_FiniteField, is_RationalField, is_pAdicField])
fld_type = fld.index(True)
```

You would rather do something like

```
fields = [
   ("FiniteField", is_FiniteField, HyperellipticCurve_finite_field),
   ("RationalField", is_RationalField, HyperellipticCurve_rational_field),
   ("pAdicField", is_pAdicField, HyperellipticCurve_padic_field)]
for name, test, cls in fields:
    if test(R):
        ....    # treat the class
        break   # the tests are exclusive, no need to run through all cases
```

What do you think about removing the inheritance from `HyperellipticCurve_generic`
in `HyperellipticCurve_rational_field`, `HyperellipticCurve_padic_field`, etc? All the inheritance is handled by this new function anyway.

In this case, the function would be

```
cls = [HyperellipticCurve_generic]

...

if len(cls) > 1:   # contains more than just HyperellipticCurve_generic
    cls = type("HyperellipticCurve_" + "_".join(cls_name), tuple(cls), {})

return cls(PP, f, h, names=names, genus=g)

How about this new version? There I just use the information of the classes that are imported in the module.

The methods in `HyperellipticCurve_rational_field` and others use methods from `HyperellipticCurve_generic`, so I don't think that it is a good idea.

So I don't think "terrible" is an appropriate adjective! (Unless you have an other way to catch the existing classes?) A list of ifs might just get very long and unpractical.

The list has length one and after #22173 it will have length two. I don't understand this objection.

"Terrible design" is appropriate.

1. As I said it is unreadable.

2. The code is sensitive to code injection

```
sage: import sage.schemes.hyperelliptic_curves.constructor as constructor
sage: constructor.HyperellipticCurve_g3 = int
```

You might consider this as a super feature, but it is very much error prone.

3. The way it is written goes through several dictionary accesses and a try/except each time a hyperelliptic curve is created. This is a waste of time as you want constructors to be as light as possible.

I would suggest we go back to the initial solution that was proposed: use a dictionary associating the class name to the actual class. I find it much more readable than the list of ifs and easier to extend.

Following Viviane's comment, I went back to using a dictionary.

I am not sure of the meaning of the error that the bot gives, I think it comes from the fact that some files where removed and is otherwise green.

You might want to test that inheritance is actually correct in the doctests

```
sage: R.<t> = PolynomialRing(GF(next_prime(10^9)))
sage: C = HyperellipticCurve(t^5 + t + 1)
sage: import inspect

Is it better to add a test for every case or with the one you gave it's enough?

Also, while looking into this I realized that I am duplicating the classes with only one superclass.

```
sage: R.<t> = PolynomialRing(GF(next_prime(10^9)))
sage: C = HyperellipticCurve(t^7 + t + 1)
sage: import inspect
sage: inspect.getmro(type(C))
(<class 'sage.schemes.hyperelliptic_curves.constructor.HyperellipticCurve_FiniteField_with_category'>,
 <class 'sage.schemes.hyperelliptic_curves.constructor.HyperellipticCurve_FiniteField'>,
 <class 'sage.schemes.hyperelliptic_curves.hyperelliptic_finite_field.HyperellipticCurve_finite_field'>,
 <class 'sage.schemes.hyperelliptic_curves.hyperelliptic_generic.HyperellipticCurve_generic'>,
...)
```


Would it be preferable to initiate the `created_classes` dictionary with the classes `HyperellipticCurve_g2`, `HyperellipticCurve_FiniteField`, etc to avoid that? That could also simplify the last part of the code if `HyperellipticCurve_generic` was added too.
