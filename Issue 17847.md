Sage library code should *not* use `var()`!

I assume you mean `sage.calculus.calculus.var.var`. Searching the source for `calculus.var` shows that the only files at risk for doing so are:

```
calculus/calculus.py:1532:        sage: sage.calculus.calculus.var_cmp(x,x)
calculus/calculus.py:1534:        sage: sage.calculus.calculus.var_cmp(x,var('z'))
calculus/calculus.py:1536:        sage: sage.calculus.calculus.var_cmp(x,var('a'))
calculus/desolvers.py:1162:        from sage.calculus.var import var
misc/sageinspect.py:188:       'sage/calculus/var.pyx'
crypto/lwe.py:99:from sage.calculus.var import var
symbolic/random_tests.py:275:    vars = [(1.0, sage.calculus.calculus.var('v%d' % (n+1))) for n in range(nvars)]
matroids/catalog.py:46:from sage.calculus.var import var
geometry/riemannian_manifolds/parametrized_surface3d.py:1508:        from sage.calculus.var import var
geometry/riemannian_manifolds/parametrized_surface3d.py:1621:        from sage.calculus.var import var
combinat/finite_state_machine.py:820:from sage.calculus.var import var
combinat/sf/jack.py:38:from sage.calculus.var import var
combinat/sf/hall_littlewood.py:28:from sage.calculus.var import var
combinat/sf/llt.py:33:from sage.calculus.var import var
combinat/sf/macdonald.py:49:from sage.calculus.var import var
```

unless someone has gone out of their way to obfuscate the incantation.

Looks good and passes tests in specific main categories.

```diff
             sage: Sym = SymmetricFunctions(FractionField(QQ['t'])).macdonald()
             Traceback (most recent call last):
             ...
-            ValueError: parameter q must be in the base ring
+            TypeError: unable to convert string
```

Is this a regression in terms of the error message, an improvement, or just a change?  To me it seems more confusing but maybe that's an appropriate message for users of this material.

Probably all three. In any case, the code is more clear, the exception type (`TypeError` instead of `ValueError`) is surely better. The error message is less clear, but that's something which can be fixed independent of this ticket.

(As a personal pet peeve, I really dislike excessive exception raising code. Moreover, I prefer a good traceback over a good error message.)

`@`kcrisman: I can improve the "unable to convert string" error message on a new ticket, but only if somebody (you?) commits to reviewing it.

Until the end of the semester I can commit to nearly nothing, unfortunately, and in any case I don't know that code at all so I'd be reluctant to say what a "good" message would be :-(

Would you be willing to just accept the change on this ticket then?

Well, most people who don't know programming would probably prefer the opposite.

Actually, upon reading the code I think that this is definitely a regression.  The only reason it complains about a string is because one doesn't do `var('q')`; surely there is a way to check whether the string `'q'` will be a variable in the given ring.  I agree that the way the original code was written is not optimal with such a default, but given that the documentation does directly refer to a parameter `q` (and `t`) this change is not good.  Surely there is some way to at least use

```
self.q = Sym.base_ring()(q)
```

or something like it to try to convert the string and then give a sensible error if it's not possible, since this is clearly how it's designed.  The new error message makes it sound like you aren't supposed to use a string, which is manifestly not the case - especially since the string is the _default_!

That said, I am happy with anything that raises an error that the user can actually understand, so I'm not suggesting one has to go back to the previous.  Perhaps

```
try:
    self.q, self.t do their thing
except TypeError:
    do something with SR.var
```

and then all other errors are as they should be, instead of raising the message error as previously.

I get your point. In Python 2, this is difficult to get right. In Python 3, there is [https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3134/](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3134/).

The error message is now

```
TypeError: unable to evaluate 'q' in Fraction Field of Univariate Polynomial Ring in t over Rational Field
```

The change message here lgtm, thanks for updating that.  I'll look briefly at #18110 as well.


---

Comment by kcrisman created at 2015-04-02 16:28:55

I guess that was all I needed to review - if it still passes tests I have no further objections.

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2015-04-02 21:26:19

OK, so positive_review modulo #18110.
