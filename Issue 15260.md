Here is the problem, presumably (`lcm` not being symbolic in this way):

```
sage: lcm(10,x)
10*x
```

We can all be Gauss with this.

```
sage: sum(lcm(1,x),x,1,100)
5050
```

The solution is to make sure that `lcm(a,b)` does something symbolic, or throws an error, when we feed it symbolic entries.  Is there already a ticket for this, perhaps?
