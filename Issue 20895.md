Many efforts have been done to convert old style packages to new style ones. This ticket proposes to get rid of the possibility of installing remote old style packages, i.e. forbid `sage -i package_name` (but not `sage -i /path/to/downloaded/tarball.spkg`).

The (somehow outdated, see #21130) list of old style packages is available at:
- http://files.sagemath.org/spkg/optional/list
- http://files.sagemath.org/spkg/experimental/list

see also: #19213, #21130 (in particular the discussion there)
