At #1819 Volker Braun suggested:

 * An alias `MPolynomialIdeal.basis` = `MPolynomialIdeal.gens`
 * `Move MPolynomialIdeal.basis_is_groebner` to `PolynomialSequence.is_groebner`
 * `Move MPolynomialIdeal.interreduced_basis` to   `PolynomialSequence.interreduce`.
 * there shouldn't be a `PolynomialSequence.groebner_basis`
