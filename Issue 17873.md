Only one question:

```
+        if isinstance(x, basestring):
+            from sage.misc.sage_eval import sage_eval
```

but there is no corresponding import for `y`, so in theory there could be some situation where `x` wasn't a basestring (whatever that is) but `y` was.  ?  Otherwise looks good.
