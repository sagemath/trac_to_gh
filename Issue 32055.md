In [https://arxiv.org/abs/0909.2808](https://arxiv.org/abs/0909.2808), Stoll proves that there exists a minimal representative of a point cluster. A point cluster is a formal sum of points of projective space. Here, minimal means that the representative minimizes the convariant he defines.

This ticket aims to add functions to find an approximation of the minimal representative. Such an approximation is useful as it can be used to reduce projective subschemes of dimension less than 1. We add a method to projective subschemes which implements such a reduction.

A couple comments here.

- Reduction theory of point clusters in projective space is published: https://ems.press/journals/ggd/articles/4454


- `subschemes of dimension less than 1`  why not say dimension 0. If there are no points it doesn't work either...


- need a statement that this is not necessarily the smallest possible coefficients, just one that corresponds to the minimal covariant (and there could be others)


- `We create a subscheme of dimension 1 with large coefficients and reduce`  -> dimension 0



- This one gets the False return in Magma and a different value the this function. What is happening with it?

```
P.<x,y>=ProjectiveSpace(QQ,1)
f=DynamicalSystem([23454*x^2 + 234087*y^2, 234729384*y^2])
X=f.periodic_points(1,return_scheme=True)
print(X)
X.reduce_coefficients(return_transformation=True)
```




- Here is a P3 example

```
#long time
P.<x,y,z,w>=ProjectiveSpace(QQ, 3)
X = P.subscheme([2342*x^2*y - 23744*x*y^2 + 2234398*y^2*w - 239874234*x*w^2,\
  223487*x*y^2 + 2342*x^2*z - 23234975*x*z^2 + 2234398*y*z*w,\
  2342*x^2*w - 23284*x*w^2 + 2234398*y*w^2,\
  223487*y^3 + 23744*y^2*z - 23234975*y*z^2 + 239874234*z*w^2,\
  23744*y^2*w - 23284*y*w^2 + 239874234*w^3,\
  -223487*y^2*w + 23234975*z^2*w - 23284*z*w^2])
X.reduce_coefficients(return_transformation=True)

- If you run the example from the equations rather than the points, you get the False

```
P1<x,y> := ProjectiveSpace(Rationals(), 1);
X:=Cluster(P1,[23454*x^2*y - 234729384*x*y^2 + 234087*y^3]);
ReduceCluster(X);
```

If you run it with the points Magma, is producing the same output as this function. I wonder if the False, is just noting that the new version has larger coefficients so you're better off with the identity?

- I looked through the code and had a few more comments.

- name: What do you think about `reduced_form()` so that it matches the other function (in rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial.pyx)

- 1440, 1472 point cluster is a Magma term -> dimension zero scheme is more familiar to our users

- period at end of lines 1460, 1464

- 1475. grammer: Seems like `that transformation` is referencing `representative`, which is not right. Need to re-word this a little bit

- 1551. Scheme must be dimension 0

- 1552. do no need the extra variable subscheme (just use `self`)

- 1561 output description says tuple, but you are simple returning two objects



- reduce_cluster.py

- file needs full header

Added a check to emulate that functionality

> - 1548. example has no output

Added output, but I can't quite get the formatting right. Could you take a look?


> - 122 - you have `B*pnt` and Stoll has `pnt*B` (whereas 131 you match his order). I'm getting the correct answers either way, which is interesting...

Taking a look at it, B is a symmetric matrix. B1 is a symmetrix matrix, and B is e<sup>B1</sup>, which is also symmetric.

The main issue I've found is the embedding code is not working; both passing in an embedding and letting the code choose one.

- embedding parameter doesn't work


```

K.<k> = NumberField(x^2 + 1)
P.<x,y,z> = ProjectiveSpace(K, 2)
emb=K.embeddings(CC)[0]
X = P.subscheme([2141136680*x^2 - 27173976948*x*y + 86218809624*y^2 - 3237154682*x*z + 20541978363*y*z + 1223552253*z^2, \

- same is true when your code picks the embedding

```
R.<x> = QQ[]
K.<k> = NumberField(x^4 + 1)

X = P.subscheme([2141136680*x^2 - 27173976948*x*y + 86218809624*y^2 - 3237154682*x*z + 20541978363*y*z + 1223552253*z^2, \
                      (-23886292125*k + 10098628775)*x^2 + (303150593245*k - 128165707435)*x*y \

                      - 115909272072050820*y^3 - 1028706119154993*x^2*z + 13055708282282128*x*y*z \
                      - 41423764177605297*y^2*z + 777643541637373*x*z^2 - 4934687875458069*y*z^2 - 195951485913414*z^3])
X.reduced_form()
```



- output says tuple as return type -- that is not what you have

- no [CamelCase](CamelCase) for function names (e.g., MatExp)

The embedding keyword should be fixed now. I switched from using an actual embedding to using complex numbers.

The return type is a tuple when `return_transformation` is `True`.

```
type(X.reduced_form(embedding=emb, return_transformation=True))
<class 'tuple'>
```

But it isn't when `return_transformation` is `False`. Do you think these should both be tuples?
