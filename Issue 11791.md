Using 4.7.2.rc0, I get the following behaviour:

```
p = circle((1,4), 3)
p.show() # Shows "round" circle
p += line([(3,4), (5,6)])
print p.aspect_ratio() # Outputs 1
p.set_aspect_ratio(1) # This should definitely make it 1
p.show() # Shows a distorted circle
p.show(aspect_ratio=1) # Shows "round" circle
```

In 4.7.1 everything behaves as expected, i.e. the first plot is not round, but two others are.

It may be related to #2100. I tried to look into it, but I don't quite understand how and where `__aspect_ratio` is taken into account internally. Do you guys have any clue?

Notice:

```
sage: p = circle((1,4), 3)
sage: p._extra_kwds
{}
sage: q = line([(3,4), (5,6)])
sage: q._extra_kwds
{'aspect_ratio': 'automatic'}
```

So when you add p and q, the `_extra_kwds` dicts get combined, so the automatic aspect ratio for q overrides the setting for p.

There are lots of different settings for plots, and they don't seem to be stored in consistent ways: some are in this `_extra_kwds` dict, some (like `__aspect_ratio`) are stored as attributes, and some (like "aspect ratio") are stored in more than one way, not necessarily consistently.

I am fine with overwriting settings - whatever is the aspect ratio for the combination is fine (or is a matter of taste). But when I explicitly set the aspect ratio to 1 after recombination and it does not work - it is a bug!
