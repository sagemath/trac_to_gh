Keywords: Laurent polynomials

Right now, if we divide a Laurent Polynomial by a monomial, the result will live in the fraction field of the corresponding polynomial ring:


```
sage: R.<s,q,t>=LaurentPolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: f=s^2*q+q^(-1)*t
sage: f
s^2*q + q^-1*t
sage: f.parent()
Multivariate Laurent Polynomial Ring in s, q, t over Rational Field
sage: f/s
(s^2*q^2 + t)/(s*q)
sage: (f/s).parent()
Fraction Field of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in s, q, t over Rational Field
```


But monomials here are units, so dividing by them should result in an element of the same ring.

This patch solves this:


```
sage: R.<s,q,t>=LaurentPolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: f=s^2*q+q^(-1)*t
sage: f.parent()
Multivariate Laurent Polynomial Ring in s, q, t over Rational Field
sage: f/s
s*q + s^-1*q^-1*t
sage: (f/s).parent()
Multivariate Laurent Polynomial Ring in s, q, t over Rational Field
```

ok, looks good to me.
I just made a few cosmetic changes in the doc, so I allow myself to put the ticket to positive
review.
