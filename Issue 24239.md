So whats the plan, have a symlinked tarball or two packages refer to the same tarball? The latter seems more sane to me. Whereas the former raises some questions, e.g. what to upload to mirrors. 

Looking up tarball name -> package name isn't really important I think. Could just return a set of matching packages.

It is needed because the tarballs on the server are stored per package. The URL is something like `.../spkg/upstream/gcc/gcc-7.2.0.xz`, where `gcc` is the package name.

I am testing this together with #12426. If this is the only scenario to consider, this looks good. Should then #12426 become a dependence here?
