# Issue 31185: Stopgap for #31421

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31422

Original creator: mjo

Original creation time: 2021-02-21 00:55:08

This "fixes" the issue in #31421 by removing two ``@`cached_method` decorators. They can be put back if someone is able to track down the root cause of the weirdness.

In contrast to those in #31421, these answers are correct.

Travis figured out that this issue isn't specific to cartesian products, which means... (1) that I have a lot more time bombs in my code, and (2) that this isn't a good stopgap.
