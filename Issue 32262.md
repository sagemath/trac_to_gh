On my side, self-tests pass, pip is usable, data on OEIS can be fetched. For this later however, i have to export `SSL_CERT_DIR` environment variable to `/etc/ssl/certs`. So perhaps there is an issue with `certifi`, not sure if this has to be part of this ticket.

Here are some additional bits: i setup a VM for this ticket, without `openssl` nor `openssl-dev` from the distro (Debian), and with `openssl 3.0.0` spkg installed . However, when i do 


```
sage: import ssl
sage: ssl.OPENSSL_VERSION

i got

which means that the Python shipped with Sage sometimes links to the `libssl1.1` that is shipped with the distro. This package is needed for important things like `passwd`, `ssh`, `apt`, etc. If i destroy the distro by removing `libssl1.1`, `./configure` aborts with

You may be right that, since i installed a lot of Sage dependencies, Python 3 might be the one of the distro, hence it is normal that it links with `libssl1.1`. Let me test with a bare VM.

I setup a bare VM with the minimal dependencies, in particular no Python 3. I can reproduce the previous error with `urllib` and OpenSSL 3.0.0.


Replying to [comment:4 mkoeppe]: 
> Is this different from the behavior without this ticket?

No, the error appears both with OpenSSL 3.0.0-beta2 and 3.0.0, which means that the introduction of OpenSSL 3.x in Sage was not tested enough.

Hence, since self-tests pass, since 3.0.0 is the first stable release of OpenSSL 3, and since there is no regression compared to the current OpenSSL 3.0.0-beta2, i suggest that we merge this ticket.
