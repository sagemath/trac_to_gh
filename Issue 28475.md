# Issue 28475: clarify acceptable input to prime_range

The function `prime_range` has two algorithms, and they do not accept the same types of input. The  "pari_isprime" algorithm accepts any input that can be coerced to an integer, because the `primes` function executes `start = ZZ(start)` and `stop = ZZ(stop)`. In contrast, the "pari_primes" algorithm simply executes the cython code `c_start = start` and `c_stop = stop` (where `c_start` and `c_stop`  are `cdef long`), without any coercion. But "pari_primes" does accept non-integer real numbers as input, which the "pari_isprime" algorithm does not. (Actually, this description of "pari_primes" is not completely accurate after ticket:28467, but the behavior is still similar to this.)

This ticket proposes to harmonize the two algorithms, so that both accept anything that either can be coerced to an integer, or is a real number. (Note that the file ??? would cause a doctest error if the "pari_primes" algorithm were changed to reject non-integer real input.)

The proposed patch may also provide error messages that are more helpful when code runs into trouble by passing bad input to `prime_range`, because an exception will be thrown up front, during the attempt to coerce or round.

The issue in this ticket was split off from ticket:28467.
