# Issue 29532: Computation of linear branch number gives incorrect result for a non-invertible SBox

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29769

Original creator: ruhm

Original creation time: 2020-05-31 11:04:59

Keywords: sbox


The function linear_branch_number() in sage.crypto.sbox.SBox produces incorrect result for a non-invertible SBox. For example,

```
sage: from sage.crypto.sbox import SBox
sage: f = SBox([0, 2, 0, 6, 2, 2, 3, 7])
sage: f.linear_branch_number()
2
```


The output should be equal to 1 instead of 2.

Moving to 9.4, as 9.3 has been released.
