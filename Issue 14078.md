# Issue 14078: sage-ptest's usage message doesn't say anything about the -sagenb switch

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/14282

Trying to understand how "make ptestlong" works, I found I had to understand what "sage-ptest -sagenb" does, and that isn't documented by the script.

I would write a patch if I knew what it does.

AFAIK, ptestlong these days is just `./sage -t -p --all --long --logfile=logs/ptestlong.log`, and can be read right out of the `Makefile`.
