As mentioned on [this sage-devel thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/n2Sc8moP7Jk) the `.subs()` method of matrices behaves badly with polynomials.

```python
sage: x = polygen(ZZ)
sage: matrix([[x]]).subs(x=1)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: must not specify both a keyword and positional argument
sage: x.subs(1).parent()
Integer Ring
sage: matrix([[x]]).subs(1).parent()
Full MatrixSpace of 1 by 1 dense matrices over Univariate
Polynomial Ring in x over Integer Ring
```

Looks good. What about 'does on coefficient': isn't a 's' missing there?

Otherwise it's good. Regardless of what you choose to do with this, you can set the ticket to `positive_review` on my behalf.

```

The current situation is not homogeneous:


```
sage: R.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: M = matrix([[x]])
sage: M.subs({x:1}).parent()
Full MatrixSpace of 1 by 1 dense matrices over Integer Ring

sage: R.<x,y,z> = ZZ[]
sage: M = matrix([[x]])
sage: M.subs({x:1}).parent()
Full MatrixSpace of 1 by 1 dense matrices over Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y, z over Integer Ring
```


This is probably due to a problem in the substitution at the polynomial level.

Also, the parent of the result should be determined by the parent of the matrix and the parent of the substitued values, not only the entries of the result, or it will be unpredictable.

It is. And then indepent of this ticket.

```
sage: R.<x,y,z> = ZZ[]
sage: x.subs(x=1).parent()
Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y, z over Integer Ring
sage: x.subs(x=RDF(1)).parent()
Real Double Field
```

The above subs is clearly broken and you are welcome to fix it.

The method `matrix.subs()` is just a shortcut to apply `subs` to all coefficients. It is needed because otherwise there is the one that is inherited from `Element`.

> Also, the parent of the result should be determined by the parent of the matrix and the parent of the substitued values, not only the entries of the result, or it will be unpredictable.

I do not see what I can do better for the sake of this ticket. This is not clear enough to me what I should do. Perhaps opening a ticket "give specifications for subs and include it in the coercion model"?

not merging ticket is also a good way to not fix it ;-)
