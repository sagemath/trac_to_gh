Well, I must admit that I am not so sure. At some point in the past, these little dashes were posing problems for doc-building. Obviously, the few ones that are still there do no pose any such problem, and they are there since some time already.

Either we can do that as a little doc-sanitizing (even if maybe not really useful)
or we can close as invalid.

Please read [comment:11] again: I think you should **either** rebase on #20496 **or** add the backslashes where needed in the references that you change.

I just think that will make the merge easier, regardless of which ticket gets merged first.
