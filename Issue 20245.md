Why?


---

Comment by chapoton created at 2016-04-21 15:29:15

Well, I must admit that I am not so sure. At some point in the past, these little dashes were posing problems for doc-building. Obviously, the few ones that are still there do no pose any such problem, and they are there since some time already.

Either we can do that as a little doc-sanitizing (even if maybe not really useful)
or we can close as invalid.

Is there any reason to _not_ do this?

I guess these will give strange errors when somebody copypaste text from manual to some text processor. Maybe something like "Can not save character - in this encoding" or like. It is much more confusing than, say, "Can not save character ä in this encoding".

I think there is no reason not to do that. So if you feel like giving a positive review, please do so.

OK. Compiling and testing.

Is OK.

Backslash abbreviated first names: `.. [Dejean] F. Dejean` should be `.. [Dejean] \F. Dejean`.

And this obviously conflicts with #20496 :-(


---

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2016-04-26 13:41:56

I think you should either rebase on #20496 or add the backslashes where needed in the references that you change.


---

Comment by chapoton created at 2016-04-26 15:59:35

Come on, Jeroen, this ticket was positive reviewed, whereas #20496 is not yet. Why should you decide that this ticket must be rebased and not the other way round ?

This being said, I am nevertheless willing to cooperate.

Please read [comment:11] again: I think you should *either* rebase on #20496 *or* add the backslashes where needed in the references that you change.

I just think that will make the merge easier, regardless of which ticket gets merged first.

I think you forgot this:

```diff
         .. [Ser1985] C. Series. The geometry of Markoff numbers. The Mathematical
-           Intelligencer, 7(3):20–29, 1985.
+           Intelligencer, 7(3):20--29, 1985.

            trajectories in the regular octagon, :arxiv:`0905.0871`, 2009.
```

Can you fix both the above references?
