# Issue 15838: Python 3 preparation: Handle the changes to "next()"

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: wluebbe

Original creation time: 2014-04-07 08:52:16

Keywords: python3

The tool 2to3 changes the use of iterator's `next()` method to the `next()` function.


It also renames the `next()` method to `__next__`.


But the code has to depend on the Python version!

There are 84 effected modules. 

This ticket is tracked as a dependency of meta-ticket ticket:16052.

Ah shoot, I still need to remove that commit from my branch. On it's way ...

Ok, done. Now all the Python level calls to `.next()` on an actual iterator have been replaced by calls to `next(...)`.

I have left most Cython files alone (or more precisely unrolled my changes after seeing that they were breaking stuff). The iterator protocol there already uses `.__next__`, so probably there is nothing to be changed. I could not find a good ref on the web about Cython + the iterator protocal + migration to Python 3 though.

I believe this is good to go. Frédéric, please proofread my changes!
