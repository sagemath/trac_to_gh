# Issue 23103: Unify test: vs. tests::

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: jmantysalo

Original creation time: 2017-06-29 18:25:01

This patch unifies remaining `TEST:` to `TESTS:`, i.e. those that have an explanation before first test.

I hope the regexps for stripping them can be simplified later.
