Assignee: jason, was

Keywords: 3d point hue

Both of the following work. Both draw an orange 2d point.


```
sage: point((2,3), hue=0.1)
sage: point((2,3), color=hue(0.1))
```


The following work. It draws an orange 3d point.


```
sage: point((2,3,4), color=hue(0.1))
```


The following doesn't work. It draws a 3d point having the default blue color.


```
sage: point((2,3,4), hue=0.1)
```
