The patchbot reports several errors. Some of them are due to a change in `src/sage/coding/delsarte_bounds.py`. The solution is

```diff
-    return A, p, m if return_data else m
+    return (A, p, m) if return_data else m
```

Also, you added a `return False` in the try except statement. Could this be the source of other doctests errors ?

now doctests do pass. The red plugins are caused by a broken patchbot, so nothing to care about here.

Parfait !

LGTM.
