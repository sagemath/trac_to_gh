"orientation- preserving" should be written without a space.

Also, I do not know the area, so should it be "the list" or "a list". Hence someone else should check this.

Otherwise all seems to be good.

Btw, for next typo ticket: `egrep -R '<sup>[</sup>#]+[a-z]-$' src/sage`

This should be re-targeted for 8.5.
