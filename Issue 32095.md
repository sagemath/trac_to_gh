I at least use these shortcuts a lot, but I guess that is not a strict requirement to have them fixed. It would just mean a lot of relearning for me.

These both continue to not work (so they don't need to be fixed)

```
$ ./sage -btp8 src/sage/combinat/partition.py 
Error: unknown option: -btp8
$ ./sage -tp8 src/sage/combinat/partition.py 
Error: unknown option: -tp8
```

but this now works (before it didn't):

```
$ ./sage -t -p8 src/sage/combinat/partition.py
```

This may be difficult to fix. What's the point of tp alone, given that the default value for nthreads is 1 ? This amounts to say, parallel, but not parallel.

Note that
`./sage -tp 8 src/sage/combinat/partition.py`
works fine, and same for btp.

There is an inherent ambiguity in the options

```
-p filename.py
```

that argparse cannot really handle, if I understand correctly.

I would see a solution to avoid breaking `sage -tp file.py`

but at the prize of breaking

`sage -tp 4 [...]`

The idea is to always add the argument 0 to `-p` when using `-tp` or `-btp`.

So what would you prefer ?

People would still be able to use

```
sage -t -p 4 [...]
```

What about `.pyx` (and probably `.pxd` and `.pxi`) files? I think those also need to be added to the list.

Thanks for the suggestion about pyx. I have added that.

I think everything works smoothly now.

What would still fail would be something like

```
sage -tp src/sage/combinat/
```

which can easily be obtained as

sage -tp 0 src/sage/combinat
