# Issue 19332: Section "inputs" to "input" in docstrings

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Sage has 135 `INPUTS` section. This patch changes them to `INPUT`. It may help in future, if we want more structured docstrings.

Please note `matrix_integer_dense.pyx` that has special input section name.

This is not yet as needs_review, as I want to run tests just to be sure.

OK. Pushed, compiling now.

There are also some `OUTPUTS`, but better to get this closed before it clashes with some other change. And still many docstrings have wrong indentation etc.

Tests passed.

Btw, there is also `TESTS` vs `TEST`... There should be something semiautomatic to prevent this. Like trac giving warnings, i.e. developer would be forced to explicitly click "Yes, I know there are >80 char lines. I know and did it intentionally."

Thanks.

And now let's see how many other tickets will be in collision course...
