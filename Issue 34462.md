A while-we-are-at-it thing you can ignore if you want, but the bullet points in `categories/examples/` are overindented by the space. Otherwise LGTM.

in `src/sage/algebras/free_algebra_quotient.py`

```diff
-    def _coerce_map_from_(self,S):
+    def _coerce_map_from_(self,S ):
```

In `src/sage/categories/examples/finite_coxeter_groups.py`:  `- `n` -- an integer with `n>=2`` -> `- `n` -- an integer with `n\geq 2`` ?
