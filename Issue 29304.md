Do we know which versions of system giac are acceptable? According to our update tickets (see #29552) >= 1.5.0-63 and < 1.6 are fine.

What does the check for `ConvertUTF16toUTF8` in the proposed `spkg-configure.m4` test? Does this test for a minimum version? 

Is there a way to test the patchlevel of giac? `giac --version` does not include this information.

On Debian testing, installing `xcas`, `libgiac` (and their dependencies) is not detected by `./configure`. From `config.log` :

```
configure:35644: result: giac-1.5.0.87p0:                             does not support check for system package; will be installed as an SPKG
```
