Its implementation of `__iter__`, `__contains__`, `__len__` are not compatible with anything in the [collections.abc](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.abc.html) protocols.

To improve interoperability, we propose to make changes to make it a [collections.abc.Mapping](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.abc.html#collections.abc.Mapping) (= supporting the operations of a `dict` but without mutability):
- Because a `Mapping` is a `Collection`, we change the `__iter__` method from yielding (key, value) items to yielding keys only. (Thus it will be compatible with the existing `__contains__` method which check for the presence of a key)
- Add methods `keys`, `items`, `values` with the semantics familiar from `dict`.

(In #24815, it was proposed to make it a [collections.abc.Sequence](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.abc.html#collections.abc.Sequence).)

I am against this change. They are vectors and only on their backend are implemented as a `dict`, but they are not dictionaries, nor mappings. Likewise, I strongly oppose changing them to iterating over keys. This brings their implementation further from the other free module vectors. The reason we iterate over both is because there is no natural way to order the basis so the sequence of coefficients occurs in a particular order (which will unfortunately be a source of incompatibility). Hence, most of the time when iterating we want to use both the support index and the coefficient. Being vectors, they don’t have `keys` and `values`, but `support` and `coefficients`. Nor do they have a reasonable notion of containment.

Contrast this to the “usual” free modules, where they have a natural compatibility with `sequence` as elements in R<sup>n</sup>, which are also how we think of finite sequences.

Yes, and there are two interpretations of this when the parent is a submodule.

- one is `monomial_coefficients`, which refers to the basis of the submodule
- one is the proposed new `items`, which will refer to the ambient. (This will be compatible with sparse vectors in `sage.modules`.)

We want the two implementations to have the same API as much as possible. R<sup>n</sup> vectors iterate over coefficients, but iterating over keys/supports here would be the exact opposite of that behavior.

So actually returning the coefficient as part of the iterator instead of saying you should access it by a completely different method is exactly the same by your logic. You wouldn’t agree that it is a much smaller change to have R<sup>n</sup> vector iterators change to return the pairs?

Unfortunately because of different implementation goals (mainly the speed that is needed for the R<sup>n</sup> modules), we cannot enforce compatibility for everything. I would rather all vectors follow what CFM vectors do from a more abstract mathematical point of view, but we have to make trade-offs. This one is here very clear-cut.

If we change the iterator for R<sup>n</sup> modules to make it compatible with what `IndexedFreeModuleElement` does, then this would lead to slow downs because the R<sup>n</sup> module elements are fairly likely to be used in time-critical code sections (where extra indirections can matter).

Yes, of course the current implementation of `support()` is bad. It's another Python2-ish leftover of returning lists all the time.

I don’t think it is necessarily worth it as it won’t be run in tight loops. Although it would just become `if len(phi.support()) == 1 and 0 in phi.support() and phi[0] < ell:` I guess.
