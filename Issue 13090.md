# Issue 13090: Update doctests after bug correction in pynac

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/13262

In current sage (5.1), parenthesis printing in power objects depends on the expression they are part of:


```
sage: latex(x^(2/3))
x^{\frac{2}{3}}
sage: latex(x^(2/3)+1)
x^{\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)} + 1
```


This comes from pynac, and has been fixed there. The attached patch fixes the corresponding doctests in sage (requires pynac at least from 15/07/2012)

Changing keywords from "" to "pynac printing".

Pynac 0.2.6 contains the fix mentioned here. Updating the spkg is #13729.

I give a positive review to Sebastian's patch with doctests.
