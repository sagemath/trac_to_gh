('im_func' | 'im_self' | 'im_class')
```

For additional information from http://docs.python.org/2/reference/datamodel.html#index-39

//Changed in version 2.6: For Python 3 forward-compatibility, im_func is also available as !__func!__, and im_self as !__self!__.//

8 modules were changed. Only the case "im_func -> !__func!__" was found.

One occurrence in `sage/structure/element.pyx` had already been handled in ticket:15983.

Resolved automerge conflict by rebasing on 6.2.beta5.

1 file was already fixed in 6.2.beta5. So only 7 files remain.

I did 

```
git merge u/chapoton/15991 u/wluebbe/ticket/15986 u/wluebbe/ticket/15987
}}} 
on top of `u/wluebbe/ticket/15992` (which is rebased on `6.2.beta5`)

Test report:
{{{
./sage -t -p --all --long --logfile=logs/ptestlong-alle4.log
...
All tests passed!
}}}
