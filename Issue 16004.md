Just a small comment: perhaps it would be easier to use

```
"""
text text text
text text text
"""
```

instead of

```
"text text text " +
"text text text "
```

Hi Nathann,

1) You forgot to add your functions in the head docstring.

2) Could you do appropriate doctests as in #16227? Especially check that the constructor work for these values.

3) There is a typo or an error in `_MOLS_from_string`. The characters belong to `a-z` and not `0-z`... but, in prevision of bigger constructions it would be better to really start from `0` (which is `chr(48)`) and go up to `z` (which is `chr(122)`).

Yo !

Right ! Fixed it.

I just did. I also did the same for the constructor included in #16235, but as I guess the two tickets will be merged at the same time...

> 3) There is a typo or an error in `_MOLS_from_string`. The characters belong to `a-z` and not `0-z`... but, in prevision of bigger constructions it would be better to really start from `0` (which is `chr(48)`) and go up to `z` (which is `chr(122)`).

If someday it becomes useful, we will do that. This function is hidden, we can change it whenever we want.

Hi Nathann,

In `latin_squares.py`, there was a useless

```
    elif n == 10 and k == 2:
        if existence:
            return True

        from database import MOLS_10_2
        matrices = MOLS_10_2()
```

that I removed (it is superseeded by the introduction of the 3 MOLS in this ticket). If you are happy with that, set it to positive review.
