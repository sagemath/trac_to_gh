I'm currently building this on vbraun's testing machine. In the worst case, we just have to remove the test.

It seems that OS X simply doesn't support `ulimit -v`.

I think this fix was incomplete, because it does not provide a workaround for the next two tests in the example:


```
            sage: import resource
            sage: if resource.RLIMIT_AS == getattr(resource, 'RLIMIT_RSS', None):
            ....:     # Skip this test if RLIMIT_AS is not properly
            ....:     # supported like on OS X, see Trac #24190
            ....:     raise RuntimeError("matrix allocation failed")
            ....: else:  # Real test
            ....:     MatrixSpace(GF(2), 2^30)(1)
            Traceback (most recent call last):
            ...
            RuntimeError: matrix allocation failed
            sage: MatrixSpace(GF(2), 1, 2^40).zero()
            Traceback (most recent call last):
            ...
            OverflowError: ...
            sage: MatrixSpace(GF(2), 2^40, 1).zero()
            Traceback (most recent call last):
            ...
            OverflowError: ...
```


The `MatrixSpace(GF(2), 1, 2^40).zero()` and so on still happily gobble up as much memory as they can if `RLIMIT_AS` was not set.  See #25884 and #23979.  In the latter, I dealt with the fact that setting `RLIMIT_AS` doesn't work on Cygwin, but in that case it raises a `ValueError`.  I'm guessing, from this ticket, that on OSX the `setrlimit` call doesn't raise an exception, but doesn't actually work either.  

I think we need a better solution for dealing with tests on systems where setting memory limits by the test runner doesn't work properly...

I take it back--the other tests do immediately raise `OverflowError` as they should.  Question is then why the `MatrixSpace(GF(2), 2^30)(1)` is being run at all on Cygwin.  It shouldn't, and yet it seems it does...
