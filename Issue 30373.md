OpenBLAS fails to build with Xcode 12. Partial fix at https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS/issues/2805, but this does not appear to completely solve the problem.

This is marked critical, not a blocker, since there is a workable homebrew package that can be used instead.

applying a patch to OpenBLAS's lapack.h allows one to build version 0.3.9
