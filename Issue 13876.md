There are test failures here.  Any idea what's causing them?

I have no idea, I cannot reproduce it. Perhaps a bug in the patchbot client?

From looking at the actual failures, that seemed likely.  I'll try it on my machine.

Works for me.  Since I don't see why the changes here would cause such failures, I'll go with the "bug in the patchbot client" explanation.
