Is it with both clang and gcc?

Yes, both clang and gcc. If I start with a Sage tarball and I set `SAGE_CHECK=yes` and `SAGE_INSTALL_CCACHE=yes`, then I get this failure with `gcc`. If I use #12426, I get this failure with `clang`.

On the other hand, if I build Sage first and then do `./sage -f -c ccache`, I get this failure with `gcc`, but with `#12426`, it skips the tests:

```

OK the message for clang when starting from a sage build is caused by

```
compiler_version="`$COMPILER --version 2>&1 | head -1`"
case $compiler_version in
    *gcc*|*g++*|2.95*)

    *clang*)
        COMPILER_TYPE_CLANG=1

        echo "WARNING: Compiler $COMPILER not supported (version: $compiler_version) -- not running tests" >&2
        exit 0
        ;;
esac
```

the test is written with the results of a linux install in mind. It would fare better if things were identified from configure using ax_compiler_vendor.m4. It is really curious it fails the way it does if you build it as part of the toolchain.

I think we may have a case where testing on OS X is just not currently supported.

Hum... So the test suite doesn't pass on OS X with either compilers but for me it is with slightly different errors. I didn't try to do it as part of a sage install. One thing that the test suite doesn't deal with properly is xcode's installed `/usr/bin/gcc`. It cannot properly identify it as being clang the way it is written. But CC=clang is properly identified (but test suite fails). 

The latest version of ccache (3.3.4) still has the detection issue but I haven't checked yet if the test suite passes when configured properly.

When you say it pass with `clang`, did you set `CC=clang` or did you let `CC` default to `/usr/bin/gcc`? The first case is no problem, the other is why I added a patch.

I just built with this plus #12426, so I let `CC` default to `/usr/bin/gcc`.

I'll have to figure out what is happening with gcc from sage. Any chance of you checking things on linux to see if it is OS X only?",

All right passes its tests here with sage's own gcc on Gentoo linux. So it is a OS X only issue.

I note that it looks like the original report. I haven't tested sage's own gcc during this ticket because I don't like building it on my laptop. But pre-built gcc binaries have been fine. So I am starting to think that the root cause of this particular report is the way sage builds gcc on OS X.

Now that building sage on OS X uses clang by default, do we care so much about the problem with sage's own gcc?

Note that `sage -f -c ccache` does not start the testsuite here (bug). I could only force that with `SAGE_CHECK='yes' ./sage -f ccache`. I confirm that 3.3.4 passes the testsuite with clang-5.0.1 on Linux.
