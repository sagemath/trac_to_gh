# Issue 10655: Prime typeset badly on plots

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/10717

Original creator: novoselt

Original creation time: 2011-01-30 18:17:08

Assignee: jason, was

When I try to put something like `$\sigma'_0$` on plots, the prime looks very big (see attached pdf). I found that `$\sigma^'_0$` looks OK, but there should be no need for such tricks, especially since this forms looks bad in proper LaTeX.

This is a problem in matplotlib.  I've emailed the matplotlib list: http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_name=4D484307.7010604%40creativetrax.com&forum_name=matplotlib-users

Incidentally, that discussion does show a workaround that doesn't fix the issue at the core.
