```
sage: p = MixedIntegerLinearProgram()
sage: b = p.new_variable()
sage: p.add_constraint(int(1) <= b[0] + b[1] + b[2] <= int(2))
sage: p.show()
Maximization:
 
Constraints:
  x_0 + x_1 + x_2 <= 2.0
Variables:
  x_0 is a continuous variable (min=0.0, max=+oo)
  x_1 is a continuous variable (min=0.0, max=+oo)
  x_2 is a continuous variable (min=0.0, max=+oo)
```


The code above works on the command-line. In a script, you can do without the `int()`.

It seems to work, except for bizarre behavior if one does try to chain in comparisons between constants.


```
sage: p = MixedIntegerLinearProgram()
sage: b = p.new_variable()
sage: b[0] <= 2 <= 2
True
sage: 0<=b[0]<=b[0]<=b[0]<=1
0 <= x_0 <= 2 <= x_0 <= x_0 <= 1
```


(The documentation should probably explain what is expected to work and what is not!)

I note that the unrelated comparison-hack code for SR silently throws away chained inequalities.

```
sage: var('x')
x
sage: x <= 2 <= 3
x <= 2
sage: x <= 2 <= x
x <= 2
```


Also, should `add_constraint` allow the user to add tautological constraints like this:

```
sage: p = MixedIntegerLinearProgram()
sage: p.add_constraint(0<=0)
ValueError: argument must be a linear function or constraint, got True
```


Someone should probably review your changes to `Parent` before this ticket is set to positive_review.

There are theoretical limits to what can work without fundamentally changing Python (or the preparser if you want to go that way), that's why it is called a "hack".

I could add a bit of documentation, although a full explanation would probably be too technical.
