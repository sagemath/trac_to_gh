Trivial failures due to change in output:

```
sage -t --long --random-seed=0 src/sage/functions/piecewise.py  # 4 doctests failed
```

Once fixed, you can set it to a positive review.

For the record: Python 8 defaults to UTF-8 source coding, so the #coding header is just cargo cult from when Python2 defaulted to the (in hindsight) wrong encoding. Nowadays the # coding header is superfluous. Pep8 says:

Files using ASCII (in Python 2) or UTF-8 (in Python 3) should not have an encoding declaration.

Thanks. I have removed the `non_ascii` patchbot plugin in https://github.com/sagemath/sage-patchbot/commit/af55241865faf2a7f89a2b6cc40caa5ce483ff67
