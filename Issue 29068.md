... as it is used in `cython_aliases`, as reported in https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/lMDRg3OJtl4/zU-AQNZwAQAJ

But actually I think a better solution than `cython_aliases` needs to be found in the longer term. Installed .pxd headers should be made usable without a special environment.

Yeah, most of what `cython_aliases` does is run pkg-config for you. I think the standard cython build tools allow you to do that manually if you want, but what's missing is a way to easily get e.g. all of the flags that sage itself used. Probably sagelib needs a *.pc file at some point, and you could just gets the libs/include-dirs from that.

funny spacing:

```
+var('ARB_LIBRARY',                   'arb')
```

align at least the line directly above it too, then.
