currently the docs in `SAGE_LOCAL/share/doc` are kind of lost to a casual user. We should advertise them in the main docs `index.html` (which is made from `doc/<LANG>/website/templates/index.html`).

We could run a script (after building, after the usual docbuilding, and/or from `sage-location`) to collect top-level HTML pages below `$SAGE_SHARE/doc/` and create an index file from those.

We could also create more symbolic links, e.g. `$SAGE_SHARE/cvxopt/doc` -> `$SAGE_SHARE/doc/cvxopt/...`.

Do you mean to say: create something to merge into the main index?

This looks like creating more mess. I'd stick to `$SAGE_SHARE/doc/` as the place where such docs should go to. Spkg's that use some other place should be fixed.
