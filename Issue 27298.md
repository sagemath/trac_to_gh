This is a nice addition!

How did you const6ruct the table of knots? Used some scripts to parse the data from the knot atlas?

Well, just taking the table and cleaning it by hand in emacs, using search-and-replace.

I think this is a little misleading about the `from_table` input:

```
a pair of integers `(n, k)` where `n` is the crossing number
```

as it makes it seem like it should take a tuple. I think it would be better to have a more standard `INPUT:` block of

```
- ``n`` -- the crossing number
- ``k`` -- a positive integer
```


A little formatting thing, I think the first entry of the knot table should be on its own line instead of part of the `small_knots_table = {`. I would also indent all of them to make it clear they are enclosed in something.

Other than these two things, LGTM, and this will be a very nice addition to have.

Doing this for links might also be a good follow-up too based on this: http://katlas.org/wiki/The_Thistlethwaite_Link_Table
