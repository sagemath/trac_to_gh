I think this is a little misleading about the `from_table` input:

```
a pair of integers `(n, k)` where `n` is the crossing number
```

as it makes it seem like it should take a tuple. I think it would be better to have a more standard `INPUT:` block of

```
- ``n`` -- the crossing number
- ``k`` -- a positive integer
```


A little formatting thing, I think the first entry of the knot table should be on its own line instead of part of the `small_knots_table = {`. I would also indent all of them to make it clear they are enclosed in something.

Other than these two things, LGTM, and this will be a very nice addition to have.
