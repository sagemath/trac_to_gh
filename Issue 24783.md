# Issue 24783: Some updates to use pycygwin

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: embray

Original creation time: 2018-03-21 17:37:55

Updates a few modules to use the `cygwin.cygpath` function instead of running a subprocess to use `cygpath` (one of the main reasons for PyCygwin).
