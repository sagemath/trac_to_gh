#22801 introduced SymPy as an optional engine for symbolic calculus on manifolds. However, not all simplifications are performed by SymPy; in particular those depending on assumptions are still treated via Maxima.

Basically, one needs to pass Sage's `assumptions()` to SymPy and use them via `refine` (cf.  http://docs.sympy.org/latest/modules/assumptions/refine.html) or maybe via the context manager `assuming` (cf. http://docs.sympy.org/latest/modules/assumptions/assume.html).
