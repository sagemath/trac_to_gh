# Issue 27469: building doc: u'\xe9' in position 19: ordinal not in range(128)

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27706

Original creator: vdelecroix

Original creation time: 2019-04-20 02:24:33

Due to local settings, the sphinx log might contain non ascii characters. As a consequence, one sees the following in the log

```
[dochtml] UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode character
u'\xe9' in position 19: ordinal not in range(128)
```
