n = 2:

```
sage: Matrix([[1, 1], [1, 1]])^(-1)
...
ZeroDivisionError: 
```


apparently all other n:

```
sage: Matrix([[1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1]])^(-1)
...
ZeroDivisionError: input matrix must be nonsingular
```

I just noticed these weak error messages the other day - it'd be great to have all the cases of non-invertible matrices give a common, and informative, message.  Two suggestions:

(a)  At the sage prompt run  `search_src("ZeroDivisionError")` and I think you will find two or three more places in the matrix code that could also be improved.

(b) For Python 3 raising an error will require syntax like:


```
raise ZeroDivisionError("input matrix must be nonsingular") 
```


Might as well do it that way now.
