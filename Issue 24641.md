The function `function()` from `symbolic/function_factory.py` allows to create symbolic functions on the command line, and it has an excellent docstring which is not shown with `function?` because the function is wrapped by `function()` from `calculus/var.pyx`. Part of the var function needs to be in Cython for specific reason.

This ticket moves the global function to the one in `function_factory.py`, leaving the part that needs to be in Cython inside `var.pyx`, merging docstrings, and so making it all accessible with `function?`.

Work on this uncovered that many doctests weren't adapted to the deprecation ticket #17447 but passed nonetheless for some reason.

Why not simply copy the good docstring to the `function` function in `src/sage/calcular/var.pyx`? Seems like the simplest solution...

```

I would start the EXAMPLES with this one:


```
We create a formal function called supersin ::

[...]
```


and I would put the following block 


```
   In Sage 4.0, basic arithmetic with unevaluated functions is no
   longer supported:

      sage: x = var('x')
      sage: f = function('f')
      sage: 2*f
      Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
      TypeError: unsupported operand parent(s) for *: 'Integer Ring' and '<class
 'sage.symbolic.function_factory.NewSymbolicFunction'>'

   You now need to evaluate the function in order to do the
   arithmetic:

      sage: 2*f(x)
      2*f(x)

   In Sage 4.0, you need to use "substitute_function()" to replace all
   occurrences of a function with another:

      sage: var('a, b')
      (a, b)
      sage: cr = function('cr')
      sage: f = cr(a)
      sage: g = f.diff(a).integral(b)
      sage: g
      b*diff(cr(a), a)
      sage: g.substitute_function(cr, cos)
      -b*sin(a)

      sage: g.substitute_function(cr, (sin(x) + cos(x)).function(x))
      b*(cos(a) - sin(a))
```


somewhere more below. Do you agree?
