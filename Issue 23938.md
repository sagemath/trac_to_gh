# Issue 23938: Optimizations to generating rigged configurations

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: tscrim

Original creation time: 2017-11-08 05:55:59

CC:  sage-combinat aschilling bsalisbury01

Keywords: rigged configurations, crystals

We get more speed by

- Faster method to compute `phi` and `_calc_vacancy_number` for `i = oo`.
- Cythonization of `RiggedPartition`.

Note #24141 is not a strict dependency, but it does take those optimizations of the Kleber tree further.

```
sage: RC = RiggedConfigurations(['F',4,1], [This is the Trac macro *3,9* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#3,9-macro))
sage: K = RC.kleber_tree()
sage: %time len(RC.module_generators)
CPU times: user 3.4 s, sys: 92 ms, total: 3.49 s
Wall time: 3.32 s
71009
sage: %time L = [mg.weight() for mg in RC.module_generators]
CPU times: user 4.82 s, sys: 56 ms, total: 4.87 s
Wall time: 4.78 s
```

vs 8.1.beta9 with #24141:

```
sage: %time len(RC.module_generators)
CPU times: user 4.12 s, sys: 80 ms, total: 4.2 s
Wall time: 4.18 s
71009
sage: %time L = [mg.weight() for mg in RC.module_generators]
CPU times: user 7.42 s, sys: 52 ms, total: 7.47 s
Wall time: 7.42 s
```
