CC:  sage-combinat @anneschilling bsalisbury01

Keywords: rigged configurations, crystals

We get more speed by

- Faster method to compute `phi` and `_calc_vacancy_number` for `i = oo`.
- Cythonization of `RiggedPartition`.

Note #24141 is not a strict dependency, but it does take those optimizations of the Kleber tree further.
