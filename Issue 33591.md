`@`isuruf Where should we point Sage users who encounter problems of this kind with the conda packages?

I think they should open an issue on the feedstock, i.e., at https://github.com/conda-forge/sage-feedstock/issues.

I'm not sure why the single threaded version was picked up. You can change the entry in `build/pkgs/pari/distros/conda.txt` to `pari=*=*_pthread` to ensure that we pick up the threaded version.
