sage/plot/plot.py is missing coverage for the important function `_plot` as well as for some GraphicsArray methods.  This is documention, but putting under graphics component since it requires good knowledge of this.

Possibly wrong (function name doesn't occur in doctests):
	 * _set_figsize_(self, ls):

This was fixed by #12495.
