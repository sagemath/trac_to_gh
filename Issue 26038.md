+1 to the other changes but strong -1 to sorting the `sinks()`. The vertices (and hence the output) may not be sortable. The better thing to do in this case is to either directly call `sorted` on the offending doctests (which I don't really care for, but you cannot get around that for a non-deterministic doctest) or add a `sort=False` keyword to `sinks()`. Anyways, the changes to `sinks()` should be done on a separate ticket for better separations-of-concerns and matched with a corresponding change to `sources` and similar methods.

Changes to `sinks()` reverted. I sorted the doctest results instead.

I get a doctest failure due to this change:

```diff
                 sage: T = B.tensor(B)
                 sage: T.lowest_weight_vectors()
-                ([3, 3], [3, 2])
+                ([3, 2], [3, 3])
 
```

Did you want a `sorted` on that output as well?

Apparently py2 test have not be done with â€‹`71986e2`. Sorry for that.
