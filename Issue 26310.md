Keywords: py3, graph

Done in this ticket:
- rewrite/simply `kruskal` using proper `DisjointSet`
- avoid comparison of vertex labels in `boruvka` using `frozenset`
- PEP8 cleaning

Some `sort` operations remain in `kruskal`.
- Edges must be visited by increasing weights. However, there is no reason for sorting by vertex labels as well
- the output list of edges is sorted. There is no reason for this, especially since other methods don't do that, e.g., `boruvka`
So we can decide to change that as well in this ticket.
