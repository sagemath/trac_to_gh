Docstring for `gyration()` in `alternating_sign_matrix.py` needs a period at the end.

Maybe shorten the name of `to_link_pattern_dyck_word()` to just `to_dyck_word()`? As far as I know, the only natural map to dyck words from ASMs is via the link pattern. If another such map is ever discovered/implemented, then we could lengthen the name, or just distinguish between them via an optional parameter.

There actually is already a to_dyck_word method, so I modified that one to include both methods of obtaining a Dyck word, dependent on a parameter.

Ignore comment about missing period, I fail at reading diff.

First sentence of doc for `to_dyck_word()` should be a single compact sentence, caveats/explanations should be pushed to a second paragraph, or included in `INPUT:`.

Methods should be `last_diagonal` and `link_pattern`.

Lastly, there should be some kind of error raised if the parameter is set to be something other than one of those two options.

Duplicate citation (reference for Wieland was already in fully packed loops).
