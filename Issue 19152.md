Docstring for `gyration()` in `alternating_sign_matrix.py` needs a period at the end.

Maybe shorten the name of `to_link_pattern_dyck_word()` to just `to_dyck_word()`? As far as I know, the only natural map to dyck words from ASMs is via the link pattern. If another such map is ever discovered/implemented, then we could lengthen the name, or just distinguish between them via an optional parameter.

There actually is already a to_dyck_word method, so I modified that one to include both methods of obtaining a Dyck word, dependent on a parameter.

Ignore comment about missing period, I fail at reading diff.

First sentence of doc for `to_dyck_word()` should be a single compact sentence, caveats/explanations should be pushed to a second paragraph, or included in `INPUT:`.

Methods should be `last_diagonal` and `link_pattern`.

Lastly, there should be some kind of error raised if the parameter is set to be something other than one of those two options.
