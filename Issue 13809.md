# Issue 13809: Partition orderings

Keywords: partitions, ordering

On #13605, the notion of overriding the default order on partitions was introduced. However due to speed regressions (#13991), we needed to push the part of #13605 that converted `Partitions*` into subclasses of `UniqueRepresentation`. This ticket is for separating out ordering on partitions.
