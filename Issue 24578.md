For *most* intents and purposes instances of `FreeModuleElement` can be used equivalently to `list` or `tuple`, in that they all meet the requirements of the [Sequence](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#sequence-types-list-tuple-range) protocol (which on Python 3 also includes `range`).

This simplifies some code that treats `Vector` distinctly from `list` and `tuple`.  To be clear, in this case we are explicitly treating the `FreeModuleElement` type, and not the abstract `Vector` type which does not meet these requirements, but that's okay since `FreeModuleElement` implements any concrete vector space elements.

By convention, this always imports `collections.Sequence` as `SequenceABC` so as to not confuse it with Sage's `Sequence` class.

If implemented well, this could be very fast. It could be used for ABCs as well as for other common type checks in Sage like `isinstance(..., Element)`. We could take inspiration from `src/sage/structure/coerce_dict.pyx`.\n\nI'm thinking about this again, and wondering what exactly you mean.  I think we really need some convenient `isiterable` and perhaps `issequence` functions, perhaps in `sage.cpython`.  It doesn't necessarily *have* to work with the ABC framework.  Perhaps we can just explicitly enumerate some specific types we care about for these cases (list, tuple, vector, (x)range, ...) which are going to be by far the most common.  On the other hand, this is pretty inflexible, and that's where the ABC system is quite nice as it is very flexible, but that comes at a small cost.\n\nThere is also already caching built into ABCs, albeit implemented mostly in pure Python.  Each ABC has a `_abc_cache` attribute, which is a `WeakSet` of all types known to implement that ABC (e.g. `Sequence._abc_cache` on Python 2 contains, by default, `list`, `tuple`, `basestring`, `buffer`, and `xrange`).  There is also a `Sequence._abc_negative_cache` for negative lookups, also  `WeakSet`.  This gets invalidated any time a new ABC is registered.\n\nSome interesting news is that Python 3.7 added a new C implementation of ABCMeta, which makes everything a bit faster.  On Python 2.7:\n\n\n```\npython2.7 -m timeit -s 'from collections import Sequence; l=[]' 'isinstance(l, Sequence)'\n```\n\n\nand on 3.7:\n\n\n\n```\npython3.7 -m timeit -s 'from collections.abc import Sequence; l=[]' 'isinstance(l, Sequence)'\n500000 loops, best of 5: 543 nsec per loop\n```\n\n\nSo a little more than twice as fast?\n\nNegative lookups are improved even more:\n\n\n```\npython2.7 -m timeit -s 'from collections import Sequence; l=0' 'isinstance(l, Sequence)'\n100000 loops, best of 3: 2.17 usec per loop\n```\n\n\n\n```\npython3.7 -m timeit -s 'from collections.abc import Sequence; l=0' 'isinstance(l, Sequence)'\n500000 loops, best of 5: 534 nsec per loop\n```\n\n\nOf course, isinstance on a non-ABC is still much faster:\n\n\n```\npython3.7 -m timeit -s 'from collections.abc import Sequence; l=0' 'isinstance(l, tuple)'\n2000000 loops, best of 5: 168 nsec per loop\n```\n\n\nbut naturally, it slows down if the argument is a tuple, the more elements you add.  This is probably significantly optimized in Cython too.\n\nGoing back to Python 2, I think nearly half the time is just spent in the lookup into the `WeakSet` cache:\n\n\n```\npython2.7 -m timeit -s 'from collections import Sequence; l=[]' 't = getattr(l, \"__class__\", None); t is not None and t in Sequence._abc_cache'\n1000000 loops, best of 3: 0.663 usec per loop\n```\n\n\n(I can't make this test as easily on Python 3.7 since the `_abc_cache` is no longer exposed as  Python attribute).  So the C implementation from Python 3.7 is probably spending the majority of its time in this cache lookup, since it's doing away with some overhead from making a Python method call, the `getattr` call, etc.\n\nI wonder if we couldn't do better.  The use of a `WeakSet` makes sense for the case of classes that are created and later destroyed (more commonly these will be in the negative cache, since you'd be even less likely to register them to an ABC).  That said, it's still pretty uncommon even for classes to be deleted.  For builtin types, and for *most* classes in Sage, classes will never be deleted, and we could just cache them in a fixed-size array (if a new class is registered to the ABC it would have to be realloc'd, but this is rare).  \n\nThough I have doubts whether it's worth micro-optimizing this further.  So I'd lean instead toward just backporting the C implementation of ABCMeta to Python 2, if anything at all.",

> I have sometimes been thinking about adding a fast Cython function caching calls to `isinstance(..., some_type)`. If implemented well, this could be very fast. It could be used for ABCs as well as for other common type checks in Sage like `isinstance(..., Element)`. We could take inspiration from `src/sage/structure/coerce_dict.pyx`.

I'm thinking about this again, and wondering what exactly you mean.  I think we really need some convenient `isiterable` and perhaps `issequence` functions, perhaps in `sage.cpython`.  It doesn't necessarily *have* to work with the ABC framework.  Perhaps we can just explicitly enumerate some specific types we care about for these cases (list, tuple, vector, (x)range, ...) which are going to be by far the most common.  On the other hand, this is pretty inflexible, and that's where the ABC system is quite nice as it is very flexible, but that comes at a small cost.

There is also already caching built into ABCs, albeit implemented mostly in pure Python.  Each ABC has a `_abc_cache` attribute, which is a `WeakSet` of all types known to implement that ABC (e.g. `Sequence._abc_cache` on Python 2 contains, by default, `list`, `tuple`, `basestring`, `buffer`, and `xrange`).  There is also a `Sequence._abc_negative_cache` for negative lookups, also  `WeakSet`.  This gets invalidated any time a new ABC is registered.

Some interesting news is that Python 3.7 added a new C implementation of ABCMeta, which makes everything a bit faster.  On Python 2.7:


```
python2.7 -m timeit -s 'from collections import Sequence; l=[]' 'isinstance(l, Sequence)'
```


and on 3.7:



```
python3.7 -m timeit -s 'from collections.abc import Sequence; l=[]' 'isinstance(l, Sequence)'
500000 loops, best of 5: 543 nsec per loop
```


So a little more than twice as fast?

Negative lookups are improved even more:


```
python2.7 -m timeit -s 'from collections import Sequence; l=0' 'isinstance(l, Sequence)'
100000 loops, best of 3: 2.17 usec per loop
```



```
python3.7 -m timeit -s 'from collections.abc import Sequence; l=0' 'isinstance(l, Sequence)'
500000 loops, best of 5: 534 nsec per loop
```


Of course, isinstance on a non-ABC is still much faster:


```
python3.7 -m timeit -s 'from collections.abc import Sequence; l=0' 'isinstance(l, tuple)'
2000000 loops, best of 5: 168 nsec per loop
```


but naturally, it slows down if the argument is a tuple, the more elements you add.  This is probably significantly optimized in Cython too.

Going back to Python 2, I think nearly half the time is just spent in the lookup into the `WeakSet` cache:


```
python2.7 -m timeit -s 'from collections import Sequence; l=[]' 't = getattr(l, "__class__", None); t is not None and t in Sequence._abc_cache'
1000000 loops, best of 3: 0.663 usec per loop
```


(I can't make this test as easily on Python 3.7 since the `_abc_cache` is no longer exposed as  Python attribute).  So the C implementation from Python 3.7 is probably spending the majority of its time in this cache lookup, since it's doing away with some overhead from making a Python method call, the `getattr` call, etc.

I wonder if we couldn't do better.  The use of a `WeakSet` makes sense for the case of classes that are created and later destroyed (more commonly these will be in the negative cache, since you'd be even less likely to register them to an ABC).  That said, it's still pretty uncommon even for classes to be deleted.  For builtin types, and for *most* classes in Sage, classes will never be deleted, and we could just cache them in a fixed-size array (if a new class is registered to the ABC it would have to be realloc'd, but this is rare).  

Though I have doubts whether it's worth micro-optimizing this further.  So I'd lean instead toward just backporting the C implementation of ABCMeta to Python 2, if anything at all.
