Updated version, now also computes the inverse of the Suter slide without iterating it n-1 times

Review patch which removes non-ascii characters, reworks the doc, and checks that the input is valid. If you're happy with my changes, go ahead and set this to positive reivew.

minor changes to Travis's review

I agree with most of your review; thanks for catching the non-ascii copypasta in particular. I've made checking optional and reinstated the "length = m" condition in the docstring since various people (like me) consider (2, 1), (2, 1, 0) and (2, 1, 0, 0, 0, ...) to be three equivalent ways to write one and the same partition.

Here's the new review patch. Come find me if you want anything else changed.

Apply: trac_14763-suter_slides-dg.patch trac_14763-review-ts.patch

Please put the exp vs. n/2 check back.

Lines 1781-1784 are redundant. That's my bad, sorry. I thought if the empty partition case was necessary in the positive exp case, it would also be in the negative exp one; but it isn't.

Lines 1785-1786 have a (now redundant) check.

Thanks for reviewing!

The empty partition case is necessary in both positive and negative ``exp``; there's even a doctest on it on line 1696.

Apply: trac_14763-suter_slides-dg.patch trac_14763-review-ts.patch

I'm fine with it either way; I just don't see how anything will change if lines 1783-1786 are removed. Not like checking an int for being 0 is a time issue...

So positive review?


---

Comment by darij created at 2013-06-19 08:57:12

Yes.

Oh, here's something I forgot to write. Line 1781 could (and I think should) be a simple "else", since we're in the while-loop. If you agree, Travis, I'll change it.

It is possible to change it, and I've done so.
