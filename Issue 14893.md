In sage-5.12.beta4, the command

```

I've tripped over this multiple times, too. This is due to circular imports in the matroid code. For example:

Depending on initialization order, importing matroids can fail. So if you delete `doc/output` and then run `make doc`, it works. But if some docs have been cached then the import order changes and *BOOM*. This is really bad. Python lets you get away with circular imports to some extend, but not forever. 

The matroid guys should linearize their imports, thats the only long-term solution.

Let me explain the reason for those circular imports.

We have an abstract class Matroid with default implementations for nearly every method. For some of those, we return a subclass such as MinorMatroid or DualMatroid; for others (like is_isomorphic()) we convert to a BasisMatroid and use its implementation.

The class BasisMatroid is a subclass of BasisExchangeMatroid, which subclasses Matroid.

If you know of a way to get this functionality without circular imports, I'm all ears!

You can import the derived class at method scope. Those imports are resolved only when you call the method.
