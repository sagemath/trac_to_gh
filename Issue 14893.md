In sage-5.12.beta4, the command

```

I've tripped over this multiple times, too. This is due to circular imports in the matroid code. For example:

```

Depending on initialization order, importing matroids can fail. So if you delete `doc/output` and then run `make doc`, it works. But if some docs have been cached then the import order changes and *BOOM*. This is really bad. Python lets you get away with circular imports to some extend, but not forever. 

The matroid guys should linearize their imports, thats the only long-term solution.

Let me explain the reason for those circular imports.

We have an abstract class Matroid with default implementations for nearly every method. For some of those, we return a subclass such as MinorMatroid or DualMatroid; for others (like is_isomorphic()) we convert to a BasisMatroid and use its implementation.

The class BasisMatroid is a subclass of BasisExchangeMatroid, which subclasses Matroid.

If you know of a way to get this functionality without circular imports, I'm all ears!

Obviously, the file containing the base must never import the derived at module level. 

You can import the derived class at method scope. Those imports are resolved only when you call the method.

I changed matroid.pyx so it only imports derived classes at method scope. I also moved one import statement from the utilities module.

One of the imports used to be a cimport, and had to be changed to a normal import. This was not in a performance-critical method, so there should be no impact on the runtime of any code.
