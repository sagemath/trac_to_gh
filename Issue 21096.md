# Issue 21096: Port Alekhnovich algorithm from CodingLib

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/21333

Keywords: sd75, polynomial, root finding

Johan Rosenkilde's [Codinglib](https://bitbucket.org/jsrn/codinglib) implements Alekhnovich algorithm to compute the roots (in `F[x]`) of a polynomial in `F[x][y]`, where `F` is a finite field.

This ticket ports this implementation to Sage.

I decided to make Alekhnovich algorithm default (both for "simply" root-finding in for polynomials, and as root-finder for GuruswamiSudan decoder). Tell me if you view it as a bad idea!

Note: First 7 commits are from #21331. Only two latest commits (tagged 21333) really belong to this ticket.
