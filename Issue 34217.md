1. Would you add one or two examples to `sage_bootstrap.app.create` like other methods?

2. In `sage_bootstrap.creator.set_python_data_and_scripts()`, the `raise` statement at the end needs to be edited. In its docstring, `wheel` case needs to be added.

3. In `sage_bootstrap.pypi.PyPiVersion.url`, there is unnecessary `print` statement (for debugging?)
