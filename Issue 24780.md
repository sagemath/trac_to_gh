Better! Though you should not expect any object to have a `parent` method. You should here use the `parent` function (from `sage.structure.element`).

```
sage: u.subs({x0:1r, x1:2r})
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
AttributeError: 'int' object has no attribute 'parent'
```


It would also be good to check that substituting **all** variables by some elements of a given multiplicative monoid does work

```
sage: F = FreeGroup(2)
sage: x0, x1 = F.gens()
sage: u = x0*x1
sage: u.subs({x0:3, x1:2})
6
sage: u.subs({x0: matrix(ZZ, 2, [1,1,0,1]), x1: matrix(ZZ, 2, [1,0,1,1])})
[2 1]
[1 1]
```


And note that if the universe is not a monoid you might get very strange behavior... but I don't think that we should worry about this.

Not me. The only words that support matrix vector substitution are the ones where the letter corresponding to the vector appears only once with a positive sign at the end. Better do matrix substitution and then multiply.
