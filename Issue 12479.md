It seems like everything is okay here.  Certainly it fixes the problem, other keywords do apply to all pieces of the function.

When did the `:trac:` thing come in?  This sounds vaguely familiar... at any rate, it works very nicely in the live doc!

5.0.beta4, apparently. Psyched that I no longer have to worry about word-wrapping "trac #12345" in the doctests.
