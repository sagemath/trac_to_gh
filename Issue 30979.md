CC:  @tobiasdiez @kliem @dimpase

(from #31064)

We add the following to the `local-...` environments:

- an environment variable that can be passed to tox to skip system package installs, directly reusing a previously set up system

  This can save time and also give developers more control for experiments with system packages.

- a target or environment variable to give an interactive shell.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31216

Thanks! Would it also make sense to add one to skip `make`? (I remember you once told me how to do this, I think, it was via `config.status` or something - but maybe the version using skip is closer in spirit anyway).

I'll review this once #30944 is merged in develop.

I think there is a "esac" missing at the end of these two lines:

```

`tox -e local-sudo-standard Makefile` with `SKIP_BOOTSTRAP: yes` and `SKIP_CONFIGURE: yes` still runs `bootstrap` and `base-toolchain` in the `make` command, which then fails since `configure` was not called before.
