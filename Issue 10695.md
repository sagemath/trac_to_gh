# Issue 10695: FFT.__setitem__ assumes values are uninitialized

Expected:

```
F = FFT(1)
F[0] = (1,1)
F[0] = 1
print F[0]
(1.0, 0.0)
```


Sage 4.6.1:

```
F = FFT(1)
F[0] = (1,1)
F[0] = 1
print F[0]
(1.0, 1.0)
```


Easy to fix:


```
    def __setitem__(self, size_t i, xy):
        # just set real for now
        if i < 0 or i >= self.n:
            raise IndexError
        if isinstance(xy, (tuple, ComplexNumber)):
            self.data[2*i] = xy[0]
            self.data[2*i+1] = xy[1]
        else:
            self.data[2*i] = xy
```


by adding the line


```
            self.data[2*i+1] = 0
```

Still occurs in 6.1.
