The call of the _rank_function of a hasse diagrams breaks the dumps method of the object because of a nasty implementation of a cached parameter. (I suppose it's an old stuff that should be changed to lazy_attribute or something similar)


```

sage: P = Poset()
sage: H = P._hasse_diagram
sage: s = dumps(H)         
sage: H.rank_function()
<built-in method !__getitem!__ of dict object at 0x8a3ecec>
sage: s = dumps(H)
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
!TypeError: expected string or Unicode object, !NoneType found
```
