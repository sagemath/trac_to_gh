Hi Nathann,

I guess this one needs also needs to be rebased on #16286 (that is a dependency of #16235).

Anyway, there is some rebase to do as there are some merging conflict with #16241.

Hi Nathann,

Don't you have better reference rather than "given by Brendan McKay"?

I thought that we moved `TD6_12` from `orthogonal_arrays` to `database`... what happend?

Yo !

> Don't you have better reference rather than "given by Brendan McKay"?

Well.... I sent him an email, he gave me the matrices .... `:-P`

> I thought that we moved `TD6_12` from `orthogonal_arrays` to `database`... what happend?

Yeah I thought I did  too... Perhaps one of the conflicts, who knows ? `:-D`

Anyway the good news is that we did not end up with a weird situation where it has not been moved WHILE some code is trying to load it from database.py. At least it works. Well, we will fix that in a later patch. I hope that Volker will release the next beta soon, because right now the Design code is a bit "foggy". It exists as a set of differences on several trac tickets, but I would like to have it in Sage and be sure that there are no conflicts anymore `:-D`
