Hi Nathann,

Don't you have better reference rather than "given by Brendan McKay"?

I thought that we moved `TD6_12` from `orthogonal_arrays` to `database`... what happend?

Yeah I thought I did  too... Perhaps one of the conflicts, who knows ? `:-D`

Anyway the good news is that we did not end up with a weird situation where it has not been moved WHILE some code is trying to load it from database.py. At least it works.
