Terminal may be pollute color sequences in environment variables during build.
Basically, my build log is full green.

This can be avoided by restoring default color after the dump of variables.

while this work with `bash` and `zsh` on rxvt-unicode/xterm I expect it to work on any terminal on linux.
I cannot test it on other OS.
