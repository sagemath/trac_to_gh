By more strictly enforcing PEP8 (here, it is the 80 char/line), I would argue degrades the readability; specifically:

```diff
-        return super(FreeZinbielAlgebra, cls).__classcall__(cls, R, n, tuple(names))
+        superclass = super(FreeZinbielAlgebra, cls)
+        return superclass.__classcall__(cls, R, n, tuple(names))
```


```diff
-            return self.element_class(self, x.monomial_coefficients(copy=False))
+            return self.element_class(self,
+                                      x.monomial_coefficients(copy=False))
```

I do see more of a better case in the former than the latter for making the change. Since this is not a major difference, and hence bikeshedding, I am going to accept this as-is. However, I would prefer not to see such changes (in particular, the latter one) unless there is a more compelling reason for it.
