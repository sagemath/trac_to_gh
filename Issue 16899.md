# Issue 16899: upgrade latte_int to 1.7.1, and fix the gmp config error

Issue created by migration from Trac.

as reported, gmp currently needs to be installed to build `latte_int`, 
otherwise configure fails. The fix for this is to add `--with-gmp=$SAGE_LOCAL` to the list of `configure` parameters in `spkg-install`.

Besides, `latte_int` is now version 1.7.1, not 1.6 (shipped now).

I've updated the setup to follow the new spkg layout. So a reviewer will need to checkout the corresponding git branch and copy the upstream tarball by hand, as mentioned in the ticket description.

I just download the tarball and it installs fine! Thanks.

I will play a bit with latte and see if everything is fine.

I tried installing it with `SAGE_CHECK=yes` and it did pass all the tests there.

Hi,

I just pushed one commit where I removed the trailing whitespaces that you introduced. If it is ok, you can set to positive review.
