CC:  @videlec @nthiery

as reported, gmp currently needs to be installed to build `latte_int`, 
otherwise configure fails. The fix for this is to add `--with-gmp=$SAGE_LOCAL` to the list of `configure` parameters in `spkg-install`.

Besides, `latte_int` is now version 1.7.1, not 1.6 (shipped now).

The [link](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/dima/packages/latte_int-1.7.1.tar.bz2) to tarball, to place in `SAGEROOT/upstream', before trying `sage -f latte_int`.

I tried installing it with `SAGE_CHECK=yes` and it did pass all the tests there.

Hi,

I just pushed one commit where I removed the trailing whitespaces that you introduced. If it is ok, you can set to positive review.
