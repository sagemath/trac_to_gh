`ETuple` used in exponents of generic multivariate polynomials implement their own iterator `ETupleIter` which is broken with respect to

```
sage: from array import array
sage: R.<x,y,z> = QQ[]
sage: e = (x*y*z).exponents()[0]
sage: array('l', e)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: 'sage.rings.polynomial.polydict.ETupleIter' object is not iterable
```

The reason is that `ETupleIter` does not implement `__iter__` while it is customary to return `self`. Here is the example of lists

```
sage: it = iter([1,2,3])
sage: iter(it) is it
True
```

And the broken version with `ETuple`

```
sage: it = iter(e)
sage: iter(e)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: 'sage.rings.polynomial.polydict.ETupleIter' object is not iterable
```
