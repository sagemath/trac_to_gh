CircleCI and [GitLab](GitLab) CI currently both build-from-latest using `sagemath/sagemath-dev:develop`. This leads to annoying errors when building from older branches as the build process won't find the commit that `sagemath-dev:develop` was built from in that branch.

Instead, we should build from `sagemath-dev:latest-tag-in-branch`, so currently we would build from `sagemath-dev:8.4.rc0` for new branches but also branches based on older states of the repository would still work. In particular, the build is more reproducible. Rerunning a build later, does not try to build from a different base build.

I have been getting bitten by this and it's confusing.  That said, I wonder if this is really a good idea.  For unmerged tickets we really want to make sure they work against the *latest* develop branch.  Instead I think we should try to apply the ticket on top of the current develop.

Maybe that's what you're doing as well too; I might be missing something.  I don't think there's much value in doing builds against old tags.

If the last commit in the old branch is older than the current develop, then it should try automatically to rebase the branch on the newest develop, or merge it, and if there are merge conflicts then it should refuse to run the rest of the pipeline (on [GitHub](GitHub) for example it generally won't run CI services if a PR has merge conflicts with the current master branch IIUC).",

E.g. If the last commit in the old branch is older than the current develop, then it should try automatically to rebase the branch on the newest develop, or merge it, and if there are merge conflicts then it should refuse to run the rest of the pipeline (on [GitHub](GitHub) for example it generally won't run CI services if a PR has merge conflicts with the current master branch IIUC).

There's a reasonable message in the build log I think. `Could not find commit `cat docker/.commit` in your local Git history. Please merge in the latest built develop branch to fix this: git fetch trac && git merge `cat docker/.commit`. I think I'd just leave this alone.
