The `pillow` spkg seems to be missing many dependencies.

As reported in https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/3j5LF0NQDPU/1HLqz8bgAgAJ for `ubuntu-focal`.

The Pillow "Installation" page lists some of the software that Pillow can make use of,
as well as some of the prerequisite installs in various package managers.

Well, I have listed the ones that we have as spkg in dependencies.

Do you know if any of the additional libraries for which we don't have spkg add something as far as Sage is concerned?

zlib is probably not needed to be listed, ad it is a dependency of python

Replying to [comment:7 dimpase]:

Can't rely on that any more because we now use system python3
