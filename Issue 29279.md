Keywords: sum, prod, product

The documentation strings for `sum`, `prod` and `product` should link to each other.

Changing keywords from "sum, prod, product" to "beginner, sum, prod, product".

Changing type from PLEASE CHANGE to enhancement.

Setting new milestone based on a cursory review of ticket status, priority, and last modification date.

I'd like to fix the first two points. I've looked around in the codebase and what I understand from the description is that docstrings in `sage.misc.functional.symbolic_sum` (aliased as `sum`), `sage.misc.functional.symbolic_prod` (aliased as `product`) and `sage.misc.misc_c.prod` should be linked to each other. Also, the docstring for `symbolic_sum` is a little confusing and the distinction between Sage's `symbolic_sum` and Python's `sum` must be made clear. Is this correct? I'm new to Sage so please tell me if I've understood this wrong, in which case, any references will be appreciated.

That is correct. Looking forward to your contribution.

Hi, I'm new to Sage. Would I be able to contribute to this as well?

I've fixed the first two points. Review needed. I'm not sure how to link the commits like I've seen in other tickets.

Please fix the repeated typo `sybmolic` for `symbolic`.

Trac automatically links to the commits. Sometimes this
takes a while and links appear with the next comment that
gets posted. They ended up appearing alongside my comments.

```
Code highlighting:
  {{{#!python sum finding 
  from builtins import sum as python_sum
  python_sum([2,3,4])
 
  }}}
```

Make sure the alternative suggestion more transparently matches the original:

```diff
         Also, only a limited number of functions are recognized in symbolic products:: 

             sage: product(valuation(n, 2), n, 1, 5)
             Traceback (most recent call last):
             ...
             TypeError: unable to convert n to an integer
 
         Again, use ``prod()``::

-            sage: prod(valuation(n, 2) for n in range(1, 6))
+            sage: prod(valuation(n+1, 2) for n in range(5))
             0  
```

Maybe even improve the example to one that returns a nonzero value:

```diff
         Also, only a limited number of functions are recognized in symbolic products:: 

-            sage: product(valuation(n, 2), n, 1, 5)
+            sage: product(valuation(2*n, 2), n, 1, 5)
             Traceback (most recent call last):
             ...
             TypeError: unable to convert n to an integer
 
         Again, use ``prod()``::

-            sage: prod(valuation(n, 2) for n in range(1, 6))
-            0
+            sage: prod(valuation(2*n, 2) for n in range(1, 6))
+            6
```

Make sure to avoid trailing whitespace (the two spaces after `0`.)
