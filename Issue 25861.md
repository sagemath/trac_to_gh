Good idea! It's something that I always wanted to do but never found the time...

Some immediate comments:

1. Regarding

To what extent is this related to code from Dokchitser or Stein? If the answer is "not at all", then the author block, the copyright block, the name of the module and the name of the class `Dokchitser_Pari` should be fixed.

2. Assigning `self.pari = Pari()` looks strange as there is really one PARI running. Better be honest about that and use a single global `pari` variable (you can import it from `sage.libs.pari`).

3. `self.pari('default(realprecision, %s)')` is a bad idea for multiple reasons. The proper way to deal with precisions in library mode is either to set the precision argument for every function call or to use inexact inputs.

4. Avoid using global PARI variables like in the `pari_precode` example `tau(n)=...`. Remember that there is only one global PARI instance, so global variables are global state! If you want functions, why not use actual functions (using the `->` syntax)?

5. You can replace `pari.FUNCTION(pari(FOO))` by `pari.FUNCTION(FOO)`.

6. It is still not clear to me why you keeping using "dokchitser" (I may be missing something, but then it should be clarified)

7. Using the `.sage()` method is often not the best way to convert a PARI object to Sage because you loose information about the parent. For example:

```
sage: x = RR.pi()
sage: parix = pari(x)
sage: parent(parix.sage())
Real Field with 64 bits of precision
```

It would be better to replace `parix.sage()` by `RR(parix)` in this case.

There are Dokchitser's algorithms (described in a famous article in Experimental Math) and Dokchitser's implementation of them (that we use so far). Pari is using (maybe an enhanced version of) the algorithms of Dokchitser or at least similar basic ideas.

I don't think that is sufficient reason to use the name "Dokchitser". Personally, I think it is especially confusing because we also have Dokchitser's GP scripts (where he is the actual author). I would rather name the module `lfunctions_pari.py` or something along those lines.

Replying to [comment:23 chapoton]:
> I also have a difficulty with passing a function as you suggested.

Are you getting the error `incorrect type in vecan_closure [wrong arity] (t_CLOSURE)`? That could be considered a `cypari2` bug.

Support for functions in `cypari2` is still incomplete, but this hack works for me:

```
sage: def zeta_coeffs(n):
....:     return [1 for i in range(n)]
sage: zeta = pari.lfuncreate([pari("f -> (n -> f(n))")(zeta_coeffs), 1, [0], 1, 1, 1, 1])
```


It's quite important to keep a reference to the function `zeta_coeffs`, otherwise this will crash.

The function is supposed to return a vector with `n` components, not a single number. See the docs for `lfuncreate`.

So you should conceptually replace `n->f(n)` by `n->vector(n, k, f(k))`.

Just a few quick comments to start with, as I have not yet built the code or looked in detail at the new interface:

1. In the example for a Dirichlet L-function can you add the display of L itself to show the effect of its having been renamed?

2. The docstring for delta_lseries is surely wrong: only one of the options interfaces with the (soon to be obsolete?) code of Tim Dok.  And why is the default not the new pari version?  Same for Dedekind Zeta.

3. Should we have some examples computed with both gp and pari to show how they compare?

>    1. In the example for a Dirichlet L-function can you add the display of L itself to show the effect of its having been renamed?

Sure, done.

>    2. The docstring for delta_lseries is surely wrong: only one of the options interfaces with the (soon to be obsolete?) code of Tim Dok.  And why is the default not the new pari version?  Same for Dedekind Zeta.

Fixed the docstring of delta_lseries

Concerning the switch to "pari" by default, maybe this new interface is not yet mature enough.

But this is already the case, I think.

A comment and a question:

`RANK 1 ELLIPTIC CURVE:` -> `.. RUBRIC:: Rank 1 elliptic curve` (see, e.g., `combinat/root_system/cartan_type.py`)

Should `init_coeffs` be exposed to the user as a public function? If so, should it be allowed to be run multiple times?

Can we please try to move on here ? This seems to me to be a progress over the current situation, even if a tiny one.

I think one can keep `init_coeffs` as a public method, to be used as explained:

```
+        Initialisation of a :pari:`lfun` from motivic data.
+
+        This can happen either in one stage or in two stages: the coefficients
+        can be given using the ``init`` keyword, or entered using
+        the :meth:`init_coeffs`.
```


There remains something not very clear about the handling of poles and residues.

I would like to get more feedback from lmfdb or pari people.

Sorry for taking time to get back to this.

I do not quite understand the necessity of the `init_coeffs` method. I feel like there would be more standard ways to refactor that out (for example, just allowing initialization as normal). Or is this meant to be something done more lazily? You could also remove the `__init` attribute by just setting `self._L = None` in the `__init__` and checking against that.

A little bit better doc formatting IMO:

```diff
-    Create a PARI `L`-function (:pari:`lfun` instance) with
+    Create a PARI `L`-function (:pari:`lfun` instance) with::
 
-    ``lfun_generic(conductor, gammaV, weight, eps, poles, residues, init)``
+        lfun_generic(conductor, gammaV, weight, eps, poles, residues, init)
```


This seems dubious to me:

```python
    values_on_gens = (chi(x) for x in pari_gens)

    # now compute the input for pari (list of exponents)
    P = chi.parent()
    if is_ComplexField(P.base_ring()):
        zeta = P.zeta()
        zeta_argument = zeta.argument()
        v = [int(round(x.argument() / zeta_argument))
             for x in values_on_gens()]   # <<<---- This part here
    else:
        dlog = P._zeta_dlog
        v = [dlog[x] for x in values_on_gens]
```

with `value_on_gens` being a generator object, I don't think it should be callable.

`check_functional_equation` could use some more standard docstring formatting.

Otherwise everything else LGTM. A lot of these points I do not care about too much (since I doubt I will ever use this code because it is outside my research area), but I still feel it is worth a quick moment of thought.
