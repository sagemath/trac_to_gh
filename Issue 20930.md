Currently there is a bug with converting Singular polynomial rings defined over field extensions to Sage polynomial rings:


```
R.<x,y> = PolynomialRing(QuadraticField(-1), 2)
S = R._singular_()
S.sage()
```

Okay, I made the minor change in the `sage_global_ring` function and added an example demonstrating the fix. I ran some doctests and this change doesn't appear to break anything.
