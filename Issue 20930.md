CC:  @bhutz @miguelmarco

Currently there is a bug with converting Singular polynomial rings defined over field extensions to Sage polynomial rings:

```
R.<x,y> = PolynomialRing(QuadraticField(-1), 2)
S = R._singular_()
S.sage()
```

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/21167
