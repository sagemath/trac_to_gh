Some little things: The error message should start with a lower case letter (Python convention).
Also some PEP8 changes:


```diff
-                    if t != 0 and t.q()==0:
+                    if t != 0 and t.q() == 0:
                         break
-                if t.q()!=0:
+                if t.q() != 0:
```


```diff
-                if v<=1 or (v == 2 and ZZ(-1).kronecker(p) != u.kronecker(p)):
+                if v <= 1 or (v == 2 and ZZ(-1).kronecker(p) != u.kronecker(p)):
```


```diff
-                a = k(G[0].numerator()); b = k(G[1].numerator());
+                a = k(G[0].numerator())
+                b = k(G[1].numerator())
```


```diff
-                        x = ((-c - b*y**2)/a)
+                        x = (-c - b*y**2) / a
```


The list comprehension doesn't allow for short-circuiting:

```diff
-                if t.q() == 0 and all([t.b(g)==0 for g in isotropic]):
+                if t.q() == 0 and all(t.b(g) == 0 for g in isotropic):
```
