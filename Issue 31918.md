- missing word in `INPUT`

a list of points in this projective space.


- documentation states that this is checking that the list of points are independent. You are checking if all N+1 subsets are independent.

Those are not the same thing.

```
P.<x,y,z> = ProjectiveSpace(QQ, 2)
points = [P(1, 0,0), P(0, 1,0), P(0,0,1),P(1,1,1)]
P.is_linearly_independent(points)
```


I understand testing the N+1 minors as your intended application is PGL transforms and you can't have a list of more than N+1 points which are independent. But if you are checking all N+1 subsets, then I don't see why you're limiting yourself to N+3 points


```
P.<x,y,z> = ProjectiveSpace(QQ, 2)
points = [P(1, 0,0), P(0, 1,0), P(0,0,1),P(1,1,1), P(2,3,4),P(-3,5,7)]
M = matrix([list(t) for t in points])
M.minors(3)
```




- Maybe there should be an optional parameter here


```
is_linearly_independent(list, n=None)
```


if None, just checks independence of the list

Otherwise checks if the size n subsets are all linearly independent

Minors is only the right check when n=N+1. Otherwise, you need to take the submatrices with the appropriate points and check the ranks.

Understood, updated.

Functioning fine on normal input. Bad input gives some weirdness


```
P.<x,y> = ProjectiveSpace(QQ, 1)
points = [P(1, 0), P(1, 1), P(2, 1)]
P.is_linearly_independent(points,0)
```



```
P.<x,y> = ProjectiveSpace(QQ, 1)
points = [P(1, 0), P(1, 1), P(2, 1)]
P.is_linearly_independent(points,5)
```

Now throws a value error as not subset of length 5, added as test.

Removed unused import. Otherwise looks fine.
