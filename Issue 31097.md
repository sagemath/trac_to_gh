(extracted from #29865)

The dependency on `sage.libs.arb` was introduced in #30486. 
We catch `ImportError` so that there are no failures in modularized 
settings (#29865 - packages `sagemath-objects`, `sagemath-categories`).



Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31334
