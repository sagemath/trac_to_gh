The file `sage/combinat/words/nfactor_enumerable_word.py` and its class `Word_nfactor_enumerable` were introduced by ticket #8604. Just when it got merged into Sage, I realized it was a mistake. This class should not exist. The fact that its name was ugly was an indice. All those methods should be in a Language class (see #12225). It would get things a lot cleaner.

Only the class `FiniteWord_class` was inheriting from it, so it farly easy to fix : just move the 14 methods from one class to the other.
