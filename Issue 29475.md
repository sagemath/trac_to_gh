Hmm, it seems that adding `__ne__` breaks things elsewhere.

maybe `__bool__` was not needed, see

https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__bool__

Why a `bool` here:

```diff
-        if self._inner_shape != []:
+        if bool(self._inner_shape):
```

Once changed or justified, you can set a positive review.
