There is a general issue with tarballs being shared between packages: the mirror url cannot be uniquely determined. E.g. now the gap tarball might be at
* http://files.sagemath.org/spkg/upstream/gap/gap-4.10.0.tar.gz
* http://files.sagemath.org/spkg/upstream/gap_packages/gap-4.10.0.tar.gz
This leads to the build failure

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/var/lib/buildbot/slave/sage_git/build/build/bin/../sage_bootstrap/download/cmdline.py", line 118, in run_safe
    run()
  File "/var/lib/buildbot/slave/sage_git/build/build/bin/../sage_bootstrap/download/cmdline.py", line 100, in run
    app.download_tarball(args.url_or_tarball, args.destination)
  File "/var/lib/buildbot/slave/sage_git/build/build/bin/../sage_bootstrap/download/app.py", line 43, in download_tarball
    tarball.download()
  File "/var/lib/buildbot/slave/sage_git/build/build/bin/../sage_bootstrap/tarball.py", line 162, in download
    raise FileNotMirroredError('tarball does not exist on mirror network')
sage_bootstrap.tarball.FileNotMirroredError: tarball does not exist on mirror network
```

For now I'll just download the tarball to both upstream locations but thats a stupid workaround
