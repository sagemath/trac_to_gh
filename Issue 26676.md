because this currently uses the ``richcmp`` coming from ``WithEqualityById``, that only handles `==` and `!=`

plus a small-scale cleanup of the modified file

You have CC'd me as author of most of the code in this file, but I don't really understand this richcmp stuff so will keep quiet.  If no test fail then I'm fairly sure it will be OK for me.  There certainly are difficult problems surrounding how the curves in each isogeny class can be sorted for labelling purposes for the LMFDB but that is not affected by this code change.

Thanks, John. This is certainly a harmless change, but I wanted to keep you informed.
