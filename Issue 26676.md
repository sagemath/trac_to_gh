You have CC'd me as author of most of the code in this file, but I don't really understand this richcmp stuff so will keep quiet.  If no test fail then I'm fairly sure it will be OK for me.  There certainly are difficult problems surrounding how the curves in each isogeny class can be sorted for labelling purposes for the LMFDB but that is not affected by this code change.
