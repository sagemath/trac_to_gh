To check whether this comes in through pkg-config, I used:

```
for a in $(pkg-config --list-all | sed 's/ .*//;'); do printf "$a: "; pkg-config --cflags $a; printf "$a: "; pkg-config --libs $a; done
```

However, on my system, the command line in the ticket description does not find any relevant packages that directly use `/usr/local/{include,lib}` (only `lua` and `fuse` do)

We can work around the existence of this `distutils.cfg` by using `setuptools` (#30912) - more specifically versions of `setuptools` that bring and use their own copy of distutils.

setuptools 49.6.0 (in Sage 9.3.beta6) does not; >=50.0.0 does; >=50.1.0 only does if `SETUPTOOLS_USE_DISTUTILS=local` is set. (https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/history.html#v50-1-0)
