I read the patch, I compiled sage and its documentation with it and checked it looked better... so I guess it's a positive review!

And, as it was a problem on another of these tickets: the pdf version also builds fine.

This commit _removes_ `sage/ext/pselect` from the reference manual, surely that was not intended???

I am adding `pselect` back in #17900...
