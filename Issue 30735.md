Keywords: threejs jsmol jupyter

From Matthias Koeppe on #30915:

The issue is about share/jupyter/nbextensions/threejs and the fact that there will be several unrelated copies of that.

Here is an example.

Let's say system jupyter is installed in /usr, so the notebook server is accessing /usr/share/jupyter/nbextensions.
Sage-9.x may be installed in /home/x/sage-9.x/local/ and may need threejs r122.
Sage-9.y may be installed in /home/x/sage-9.y/local/ and may need threejs r155.
Let's say r122 and r155 are mutually incompatible.
As `@`enriqueartal has reported above, our offline threejs graphics needs /usr/share/jupyter/nbextensions/threejs/. But the system does not provide it -- it must come from Sage. If we create a symlink /usr/share/jupyter/nbextensions/threejs -> /home/x/sage-9.x/local/share/jupyter/nbextensions/threejs, then Sage 9.x will work with the system jupyter notebook; but Sage 9.y will not.

Do you agree?

So this means that we need a versioned installation scheme. The details of this installation scheme is what I am trying to discuss with you, in particular because it is certainly related to that new repository.

I'm no expert on Python, especially the way implementations my differ, but it can access the local file system and Sage already has `THREEJS_DIR`. Why not set the symlink to Three.js or any package when the kernel initially loads? That way the system package will use whatever version accompanies the kernel.

Why exactly would someone want to do this? I can see a user not wanting to upgrade to the newest version, but why would they use an older version when the newer one will almost certainly be an improvement?

For "sagelib" I disable https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/develop/src/sage/repl/ipython_kernel/install.py#L281 because of the way I have to install documentation following Gentoo's guidelines (not everyone in Gentoo is happy with the current way of doing this) and I do the stuff from that line manually. For the rest, sagelib's kernel install is used - it wasn't always the case.

I just change the kernel specs to use the current python directly.

I don't support any versioning of sage whatsoever. Multiple pythons are supported and work thanks to the current Gentoo python infrastructure that supports it. But stuff in `/usr/share/jupyter/` has to be somewhat python independent really.

`sage-9999` is just sage straight from the git develop branch, so right now 9.2.beta3 (but in my case, Volker's develop branch).

Users who want versioning, usually are after reproducibility. In that case system packaging is not part of the solution. containers on the other are an ideal tool for that.

I had to update the path in `sage.repl.rich_output.backend_ipython.BackendIPythonNotebook.threejs_offline_scripts` similar to what you did for `BackendIPythonCommandline` in order to avoid 404s in jupyter/jupyterlab.

Since I already had the fix locally, I hope you don't mind that I've gone ahead and pushed it and pointed the ticket at it.

Ran both `online=True` and `online=False` for the command-line, jupyter, and jupyterlab. I also verified that the CDN fallback works for jupyter and jupyterlab (for the "Save as HTML" feature).

If the plan is to start shipping multiple old versions of Three.js with every new Sage release, then I don't much like that idea. If goes against the entire sense of improving software with a new release.

I would rather implement an idea Joshua raised some time ago on a ticket I can't locate: separate the Three.js viewer as a stand-alone package and keep all the versioning issues there. All of the dependencies of Sage on Three.js are in the template. If that were a separate package it would track the correct version of Three.js by default.

Joshua, can you remember which ticket had your thoughts on this? Are you game to take a crack at implementing this?

The problem remains that the Javascript code needs to be accessed by the Jupyter installation (notebook server), whereas the template needs to be accessed by Sage (Python code). These are in general separate installations - as I have explained with the example in the ticket description. So I don't think that this will help unless I misunderstand something there.

I believe this was comment:4:ticket:30620 and comment:7:ticket:30620 ("Three.js: future of examples/js files").

I don't think it'd solve the present versioning issue, though. We'd just be worrying about providing multiple offline versions of this new package instead.

Let's discuss what the ticket changes step by step.

1) renames directories from `threejs` to `threejs-sage` (in share/ and share/jupyter/nbextensions/) to reflect the fact that it is a Sage-specific fork

for example in this change

```
-THREEJS_DIR = "@prefix@/share/threejs"
+THREEJS_DIR = "@prefix@/share/threejs-sage"
