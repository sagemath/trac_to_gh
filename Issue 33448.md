`Triangulation` already has a method `normal_cone`, which computes the normal cone of the GKZ polytope that exposes the triangulation.

What seems to be missing is a method to compute regular triangulations, given an element of the normal cone (a weight/lifting vector), computes the regular triangulation (or more generally, subdivision) of the point configuration / polyhedron. 

Under some conditions, this would also make sense for polyhedral complexes.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/33685

It is very confusing that “triangulation” is called although often times it is just a subdivision.

Does the function “is regular subdivision” test whether other is a subdivision of self, or the reverse?

Would it be better to limit the scope of `is_regular_subdivision` to only the case where `self` satisfies `is_simplicial_complex` and `is_compact`? 

I notice that this requirement is specified in the method `as_triangulation`. But then, inside `is_regular_subdivision`, `self.as_triangulation` is called with `check=False`, which doesn't make sense to me.
