An error with division of infinities:

```
sage: infinity / unsigned_infinity
ValueError: unsigned oo times smaller number not defined
sage: SR(infinity)/unsigned_infinity
0
sage: gamma(SR(-2))/gamma(-4)
0
```

note also that `limit` returns "infinities" from the SymbolicRing and not from the InfinityRing,
whereas it takes as input elements from the InfinityRing:

```
sage: a=+Infinity
sage: b=limit(x, x=a)
sage: type(a), a.parent()
(sage.rings.infinity.PlusInfinity, The Infinity Ring)
sage: type(b), b.parent()
(sage.symbolic.expression.Expression, Symbolic Ring)
```

As a consequence, the equality `a==b` does not return True:

```
sage: a==b
+Infinity == +Infinity
```

Hmm... But isn't that the case with anything in the Symbolic Ring? For example,


```
sage: SR(4) == 3
4 == 3
sage: type(limit(1/x, x=1))
<type 'sage.symbolic.expression.Expression'>
```


Calling `bool` with the equality returns a boolean:


```
sage: bool(a == b)
True
```


Calling `.pyobject()` on the result from `limit` would be sensible, I think. We have the following discrepancy now:


```
sage: type(diff(1))
<type 'sage.symbolic.expression.Expression'>
sage: type(integrate(0, x))
<type 'sage.rings.integer.Integer'>
```


It's very troubling how broken arithmetic and comparisons with infinities is at the moment, as shown in #11506.

ok I revert my comment [comment:1].

Fixed by #11506; the same error is now raised in all three cases.  We should just add a doctest.

Here is a doctest.

Looks good and works.
