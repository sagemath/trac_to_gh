I'm unable to access the branch `u/zgershkoff/typos` and so I cannot help yet reviewing the patch.

It seems that I've made the commit and pushed it correctly so I'll change the ticket status to 'needs review'.

The commit message is somewhat unfortunate but I guess it is not really a problem. (you are probably aware that "fixed typo" would have been better.)
