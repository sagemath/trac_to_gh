# Issue 11362: Increase test_executable timeout in ppl.pyx

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/11534

Original creator: jdemeyer

Original creation time: 2011-06-22 20:25:19

Assignee: mvngu

In `devel/sage/sage/libs/ppl.pyx`, there are various tests of the form

```
(out, err, ret) = test_executable(['sage', '-c', sage_cmd])
```

It turns out that these commonly result in timeouts (much more often than the basic tests in `sage/tests/cmdline.py`).  The proposal is to increase the timeouts in ppl.pyx.

Yes, good point. I keep forgetting that not everybody runs on a solid state drive. Those tests don't take any time at all on my system, but if you run on NFS then the startup can be painful.

Positive review!

Unfortunately, now I am regularly hitting the "whole file" timeout for `ppl.pyx` on various systems.  A timeout of `ppl.pyx` is now one of the most common reasons for a build to fail on the buildbot.  I think the test takes too long, although I cannot rule out a true bug.  Volker, any ideas to fix this?

Some doctests spawn a new sage process because they are testing debugging output that ppl writes to stdout. Presumably these take a long time on machines where Sage startup takes forever. How about we mark all doctests that spawn a new sage process as

```
  # optional - FAST_SAGE_STARTUP
```

or something like that? We do test the ppl functionality independently, so they aren't really necessary for doctest coverage. If you agree with this then I can make a patch.

Actually I discovered the problem is not related to `test_executable` but it is instead #11849.
