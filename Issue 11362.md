Assignee: mvngu

In `devel/sage/sage/libs/ppl.pyx`, there are various tests of the form

```
(out, err, ret) = test_executable(['sage', '-c', sage_cmd])
```
It turns out that these commonly result in timeouts (much more often than the basic tests in `sage/tests/cmdline.py`).  The proposal is to increase the timeouts in ppl.pyx.

Yes, good point. I keep forgetting that not everybody runs on a solid state drive. Those tests don't take any time at all on my system, but if you run on NFS then the startup can be painful.

Positive review!

Some doctests spawn a new sage process because they are testing debugging output that ppl writes to stdout. Presumably these take a long time on machines where Sage startup takes forever. How about we mark all doctests that spawn a new sage process as

```
  # optional - FAST_SAGE_STARTUP
```
or something like that? We do test the ppl functionality independently, so they aren't really necessary for doctest coverage. If you agree with this then I can make a patch.
