The fixed test in `sagedoc.py` is still failing :


```
File "src/sage/misc/sagedoc.py", line 1026, in sage.misc.sagedoc.?
Failed example:
    print(search_src(" fetch(", "def", interact=False)) # py3

    re.error: missing ), unterminated subpattern at position 6
```


We have seen similar cases where the exception seems to not be caught by the doctest framework in py3 but don't remember the fix right now.

As the test is tagged with `#py3` this patch fix the problem even if i am not sure why `...error` don't work in this case.
