```
sage: Q=QuadraticForm(matrix.diagonal([2,-2]))
sage: Q

Quadratic form in 2 variables over Integer Ring with coefficients: 
[ 1 0 ]
[ * -1 ]
sage: Q.polynomial()
2*x0^2 - 2*x1^2
sage: Q(vector(ZZ,[36,25]))
671
```

Clearly, the correct answer is 22.
Evaluating quadratic forms is the one thing in the quadratic forms package that MUST not have a bug. Thus this is a blocker.
