Helloooo Dima !

I can build this design but I do not know how to build the graph from it. It is explained there [1] but I am afraid that I do not understand what those polarities are, and how to use them. Would it happen to make more sense for you ? `^^;`

A polarity of a symmetric design is simply an automorphism p of order 2 of the incidence graph, which maps points to blocks. A point P is called absolute if P lies in the block p(P).
Once you know p with all points absolute, you can reorder points and blocks in the way that the incidence matrix has all 1s on the diagonal, and this is essentially the adj.mat. of the graph you are after.

Now, how does one go about finding polarites? Construct the incidence graph, compute its automorphism group a, find representatives of the conjugacy classes of a, select these which have representatives of order 2, mapping points to blocks. In this case there will be just two such class representatives, so you need to pick one, p, with all points absolute.

Let me know if you get stuck...

Hellooooo Dima,

Thank you for this explanation. I pushed a last commit that lets us build the graph (slowly). The branch contains a method that I thought I would need: `PermutationGroup.relative_action`. Turns out that I do not use it, though I think it is a nice thing to have. I leave it there thinking that it does not complicate the review much, but I will move it to another ticket if you ask.

One more down!

well, I think it's platform-independent: have a look at

```
$SAGEROOT/local/gap/latest/pkg/design/lib/blockdesign.g
```

you'll see in `WittDesign`

```
   M24:=Group([ (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23),

      (1,24)(2,23)(3,12)(4,16)(5,18)(6,10)(7,20)(8,14)(9,21)(11,17)(13,22)
      (15,19) ]);
   W24:=BlockDesign(24,[[1,2,3,4,5,8,11,13]],M24);
   W24.autGroup:=M24;
   Unbind(W24.autSubgroup);
   W24.allTDesignLambdas:=Immutable(TDesignLambdas(5,24,8,1));
   W:=W24;
   for i in Reversed([n+1..24]) do
      W:=DerivedBlockDesign(W,i);
   od;
```

it hardcodes the group and a block of the "big" Witt design S(5,8,24).

A 2-design is called symmetric if it has as many points as blocks, and with the number of blocks on a point equals the block size (e.g. PG(2,q), and, more generally, finite projective planes, are symmetric 2-designs).

The dual of a symmetric 2-design is the design with points and blocks swapping the roles. 

A symmetric 2-design is called self-dual if it is isomorphic to its dual.
A self-dual symmetric 2-design is called self-polar if it has a polarity.

OK, and for the good measure, a duality is an isomorphism between the design and its dual. Every polarity is a duality. Dualities can be computed in the same way as polarity (just drop order==2 requirement). So it would also be very natural to have `is_self_dual` method, too.

Okay, good. Thank you for these changes, and the modifications you brought to the functions I wrote.

Now, Dima, it is time for you to learn how to use git, because you cannot continue using tools that you do not understand. You need to use 'tig', which is a command-line tool that displays the branch of a git tree: it is *very* helpful to learn git, and *very* helpful to work with Sage.

Then, you should learn how to use 'git rebase -i', which lets you rename/merge commits before pushing them. That will make your branches much cleaner. Also, please remember to give a proper commit message <anytime>, but in particular for the 'merge' commits.

Good to go.
