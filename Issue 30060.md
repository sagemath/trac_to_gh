# Issue 30060: Elliptic curve lift_x with extend for p-adics needs names argument

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/30297

Original creator: alexjbest

Original creation time: 2020-08-05 20:46:34

Keywords: padics, elliptic curves

Currently

```
            sage: K = Qp(5)
            sage: E = EllipticCurve([K(0), K(1)])
            sage: E.lift_x(1, extend=True)
```

fails as the `extension` method for p-adic fields takes prec as a second argument, so add the argument name `names` explicitly.
