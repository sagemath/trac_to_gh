now using coercion for comparison of hyperbolic points

also correct a wrong repr

(a step towards #22297)

`HyperbolicModel` is a subclass of `UniqueRepresentation`, so there shouldn't be any rich comparison methods.

Sorry, but I do not understand precisely what you mean.

I introduced here `__eq__` and `__ne__` in the class `HyperbolicModel`. This is probably not needed, just a side effect of my lazyness to undo what I did. Do you mean that I should remove them ? If yes, I agree.

The most important part of the ticket is the change of behaviour for hyperbolic points. Here I really think that one needs `_richcmp_`

`UniqueRepresentation` has custom (rich) comparison methods to do equality by id. So yes, you interpreted my comment correctly: `__eq__` and `__ne__` should be removed. I agree the important behavior is for hyperbolic points. Thanks.
