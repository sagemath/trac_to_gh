Should this be set to positive review since it should be closed?

Wasn't sure about what to do with a duplicate to close as 'won't-fix'.

But, yes, this is ready to be closed and the branch *not* merged.

Yeah, set it to positive review with the milestone as wontfix.  It's best to also delete the branch and commit fields.
