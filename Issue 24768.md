Keywords: integral real variable

It seems to me that

```
assume(x, 'real')
integral(1/x, x)
```

should return

```
log(abs(x))
```

but it returns

```
log(x)
```

But maybe I am missing something.

on the negative real axis, log(abs(x)) and log(x) differ by a multiple of `I pi`, so they are equally valid primitives.

Do we need a new `real_valued_integral` function?

Changing component from PLEASE CHANGE to calculus.
