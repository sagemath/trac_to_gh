Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/22150

Before

```
sage: QQ[2^(1/3)].coerce_embedding() is None
True
```

After

```
sage: QQ[2^(1/3)].coerce_embedding()
Generic morphism:
  From: Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^3 - 2
  To:   Algebraic Real Field
  Defn: a -> 1.259921049894873?
```

Needs rebase.

Moreover, there is a problem coming from

```
sage: sqrt(-3).is_real()
True
```

Whoops, I had forgotten about this ticket, but see #23117.

so we can close this as duplicate, right ?

Hmm. currently we get:

```
Generic morphism:
  From: Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^3 - 2
  To:   Real Lazy Field
  Defn: a -> 1.259921049894873?
```

with target the real lazy field instead of AA.

It would have been better if you just have read the ticket description.

What do you mean ? The ticket description is no longer valid...

The branch is not either. I think that #23117 was actually a bad idea. Coercion should not go through the real lazy field.

Replying to [comment:9 vdelecroix]:

I agree that complex embeddings should go to `QQbar` or something like that by default, but for me this is a separate issue, already tracked elsewhere.

However, having the `K[α]` syntax create the “standard” embedding makes more sense to me (less confusing, probably breaks fewer existing things) than having it attempt to embed the number field in `α`'s parent or something like that—if that's what you have in mind.
