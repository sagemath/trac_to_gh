Keywords: combinatorial polyhedron, f-vector

The goal of this ticket is to parallelize the f-vector of polyhedra.

This will include having a `nogil` version of the most important methods of `FaceIterator`.

Also we will do some improvements of the current code, mostly for very sparse polyhedra.

This is the current schedule:

- Move most important attributes of `FaceIterator` to a structure.
- Make a `nogil` version of the most important methods of `FaceIterator`.
- A first parallel version.
- Each copy of the structure has access to a job number and uses it to reduce overhead.
- Improvements for very sparse polyhedra.
