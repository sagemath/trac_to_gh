Interesting. This still limit the `jupyter` notebook to be installed in the same prefix as the python executable. Could we just call things relying on it being in the `PATH`? That may be especially helpful for nix.

If you start jupyter-notebook from vanilla sage's root or any of the usual commands, I expect you will get the sage version because `SAGE_LOCAL/bin` will be in your `PATH`.

It seems to me that the real problem is that we would like to pass the path to the location of the kernels to `jupyter-notebook`. I'll look into that.

The way I currently handle jupyter is as follows: I have a custom kernel spec (independent of the one sage generates) which can then be used either by a system-wide jupyter service or by the notebook sage launches. Jupyter is taken from the system of course and sage is wrapped with an appropriate `JUPYTER_PATH` pointing to the kernel spec.

OK, but in regards to the branch currently in this ticket, `jupyter-notebook` is assumed to be installed in the same prefix as the python interpreter.
