Keywords: gap

Having installed `gap_packages`, the following in a fresh Sage session fails:

```
sage: C = codes.HammingCode(GF(2), 5)
sage: C.covering_radius()  # optional - gap_packages (Guava package)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
RuntimeError                              Traceback (most recent call last)
...
RuntimeError: Gap produced error output
Error, Variable: 'GeneratorMatCode' must have a value
```

This is also evident running the doc-test with `--optional=sage,gap_packages`.

I've added the appropriate `gap.load_packages` call, along with a guard for having it installed. I also added that guard to other places in `sage/coding` where `guava` is loaded. I also added a guard for fields of size `> 256` where the GAP function fails ungracefully (as for `linear_code.minimum_distance`).
