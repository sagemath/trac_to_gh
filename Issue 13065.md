The unrecognized options should be addressed I think.

No idea how to interpret *"`factory.h` not found! Install factory before building libfac!"*, as the build succeeded.

*"Building without python support"* can safely be ignored I guess, as we use our own Cython wrappers.

I fixed the fixable warnings.  Many of them are caused by recursive calling of `configure`, for example, the top-level `configure` calls `omalloc/configure`.  Many options are supported by some (but not all) `configure` scripts.  These will give warnings and I don't see how to avoid these.

I assume that this is work in progress (i.e., you haven't tried to fix doctest errors yet).

Anyway, here's what I got on Ubuntu 10.04.4 LTS x86_64, with Sage 5.2.rc0 and GCC 4.7.0:

```
The following tests failed:

	sage -t  --long -force_lib devel/sage/doc/en/constructions/polynomials.rst # 1 doctests failed
	sage -t  --long -force_lib devel/sage/sage/rings/function_field/function_field.py # 1 doctests failed
	sage -t  --long -force_lib devel/sage/sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_libsingular.pyx # 3 doctests failed
	sage -t  --long -force_lib devel/sage/sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_ideal.py # 1 doctests failed
	sage -t  --long -force_lib devel/sage/sage/calculus/wester.py # 1 doctests failed
	sage -t  --long -force_lib devel/sage/sage/libs/singular/function.pyx # 2 doctests failed
	sage -t  --long -force_lib devel/sage/sage/combinat/words/words.py # 0 doctests failed
```

(The last failure was a segfault with a large traceback IIRC.  Somewhat surprisingly successfully compiled with `-O3`, although many if not most compile commands override this by `-O2`; looks as if they use `CPPFLAGS` *instead of* `CXXFLAGS` in some parts.) 

Let me know in case you're interested in further output; I guess you can reproduce most of the errors.

Yes, the most obvious one... :-)

spkg and patch apply/install fine. Also the tests are fine. So I'm close to a positive review, just waiting for the patch from #12089.

Just for the record:  Did pass `ptestlong` (with a bit of luck, cf. the "random" factoring) with Sage 5.2[.rc0] (Ubuntu 10.04.4 LTS x86_64, FSF GCC 4.7.0, with `-O3`, see above).

Patch applies to Sage 5.3.beta0 as well (a few lines offset, never mind).

Only just noticed that old installations get removed before we even attempt to build the new one; this should in general only be done if the build succeeded.

(Haven't yet closely looked at [the changes to] `spkg-install`.)

yes, I can confirm that installing this spkg on MacOSX one gets Singular LIB files into `SAGELOCAL/lib/`, as well as in the right place, i.e. `SAGELOCAL/share/singular/`, which is certainly not what one would want.

Just in case (won't have time tomorrow), I was so free to propose a changed spkg here: http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/dreyer/spkg/singular-3-1-5.p0.spkg 

As before, the changes are not committed yet. Also I haven't changes the URL in the description, as Jeroen might continue with other fixes.

The changes are as follows (for review):

Good suggestion, however #12089, #13344 are about *compiling* Singular so I don't think we should add a regression test for that (the real test is just checking that any upgrades don't break the build).

We could test existence of *.lib files in the LIB directory for #13344, or of $SAGE_LOCAL/LIB directory.
The problem is critical on Cygwin where LIB resolves to lib and messes PyOpenSSL compilation (although that package won't be built anymore soon), but was also present on every platform.

There is a small thing that I'd like to change: There is a header table.h, that is currently not installed. However, it is needed by libsing (not libsingular).

libsing is a package allowing GAP to use Singular natively. I don't know if it would be of general interest to have it in Sage. Anyway: Should there be a new ticket for the installation of table.h, or should it be done here?
