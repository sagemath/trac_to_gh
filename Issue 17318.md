On a sage-devel thread [1] there seems to be a general agreement that the dev scripts should be kept around for those who use them, but that we should remove the doc so that new users learn 'git trac' or git directly.

The doc has been printing a hint to "not use them" since a while, by the way.

Should you not remove more stuff from src/doc/en/reference/dev/index.rst? It looks to me like the whole of the sage/dev hierarchy is made up of  sage-dev scripts and commands.

Sorry for that, I should have seen it `:-/`

There was a mention left of this "sagedev" scripts. I added a commit to removes it: could anybody review it ? It is quite short. 

Thanks,

Nathann

Yes indeed. In sage-on-gentoo I remove that folder altogether which is why I didn't realise you had missed one bit.
