The current version of `database_knotinfo` introduced an essential change that effects a couple of doctests. Explicitely they replaced many braid representatives of proper links by braids with smaller index. For example the braid of `L4a1_0` changed like this:

```
-        '{4, {1, -2, 3, -2, -1, -2, -3, -2}}'
+        '{3, {-2, -2, -1, 2, -1}}'
```

Surely, this is an improvement which is worth to have it visible in Sage.

The only change of proper code I do is the adaption of the new braid representatives in the static dictionary of the demonstration cases. All other changes just concern the documentation. 

The new braid representatives turned some tests for `NotImplementedErrors` of the method `get_knotinfo` to be successful. Therefore, I replace these examples by other test cases.

Note, that the correction of the optional doctest in `link.py` at line 3744 was not caused by the upgrade of the database but rather by ticket [#30997](https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/30997) where it went unnoticed.

The former braid representatives are still kept in the database in a new column `braid_notation_old`. For compatibility reason I add this to the static dictionary of the demonstration cases.

For testing I started a [GitHub workflow](https://github.com/soehms/sage/actions/runs/1382182523).
