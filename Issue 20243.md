Issue created by migration from Trac.

the method `centralizer_size` (with its default options t=q=0)
is spending some time to take a product of several 1.

Let us spare us that.

This will also prevent some bad behaviour in py3.

You can remove the list in the second `prod`. Also, it will probably be cleaner (in terms of the coercions) and possibly faster to do `ZZ.one()` instead of `1`.

The `1 - q**j` and `1 - t**j`.
