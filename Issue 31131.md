In Sage 9.1 or 9.2, I can type this and
get some timing output.

```
sage: time a=1+2
CPU times: user 5 µs, sys: 2 µs, total: 7 µs
Wall time: 7.63 µs
```


However, when I put

```
time a=1+2
```

into `footime.sage` and then run

```
sage footime.sage
```

I see the following output:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "footime.sage.py", line 7, in <module>
    __time__=misc.cputime(); __wall__=misc.walltime(); a = _sage_const_1 +_sage_const_2 ; print("Time: CPU %.2f s, Wall: %.2f s"%(misc.cputime(__time__), misc.walltime(__wall__)))
NameError: name 'misc' is not defined
```


There is a generated `footime.sage.py` with the following content.

```

# This file was *autogenerated* from the file footime.sage
from sage.all_cmdline import *   # import sage library

_sage_const_1 = Integer(1); _sage_const_2 = Integer(2)
__time__=misc.cputime(); __wall__=misc.walltime(); a = _sage_const_1 +_sage_const_2 ; print("Time: CPU %.2f s, Wall: %.2f s"%(misc.cputime(__time__), misc.walltime(__wall__)))

```
