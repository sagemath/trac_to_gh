ppurka suggests prepending `$SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/build/sage/` to `PYTHONPATH` in `sage-env`. This indeed works, but I'm not sure what else it might break. Advice?

Is sage-env even called from anywhere outside Sage scripts? It seems weird that all the sage scripts are called as `#!/usr/bin/env bash` but the scripts themselves are not written (most of the time) as bash scripts. It should probably be like the `$SAGE_ROOT/sage` script should be POSIX shell compatible and then the rest should be proper bash scripts, since they anyway invoke bash. It will make the scripts nicer and easier to read.

Thanks for the PYTHONPATH fix. Didn't know that empty paths resolve to current directory.

If they are mostly written as POSIX-compatible, why not just go all the way and make them all call `sh` instead, and remove bashisms? But this is getting off topic, I think...

Hmmm.  In principle we should avoid bashisms whenever possible.

The main reason we use `bash` is that we can to some extent rely on it being functional; there are too many broken Bourne shells, or at least `/bin/sh`ells.

Nice service, thanks.

I just wonder how many parts of Sage (unconsciously exploiting it) break if we fix this bug.
