Here is distro package information for csdp.
Can someone do the `spkg-configure.m4` file?

Changing keywords from "" to "spkg-configure, csdp".

Still the "official" coinor-csdp uses `Makefile`. I mentioned to `@`gh-brianborchers, the author of csdp, our autotoolized fork (https://github.com/dimpase/csdp), done years before "official" csdp got on [GitHub](GitHub), never got a reply.

Not sure what can be done about it.
