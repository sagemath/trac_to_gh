Likewise for `ExtPowerFreeModule` etc.

The current code creates an element without components if the base module has no default basis. Such elements are not useful for running the test suite because adding them gives a "no common basis" error.

That currently all tests work depends in a subtle way on the order in which modules are created.

In this ticket, we propose to change the `_an_element_` method to create a default basis in the base module if none already exists -- this matches what `FiniteRankFreeModule._an_element_` already does.

This will simplify further refactoring of the code, such as the identification of modules discussed in #30241.
