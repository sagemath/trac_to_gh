# Issue 22314: Deprecate the old .field() method from polyhedron class

Ticket #11634 made the ppl library be the default backend for the `Polyhedron class`.

Currently, Polyhedron objects still have a `.field()` method which is ill-named and since #11634 out-dated.

This ticket deprecates this method.

In `cdd_convert` you need to test the deprecation

No deprecation here?

Hmm. Right. I confused the keyword with the method here. I will add a deprecation warning.

Since it is in a nested function, I removed the deprecation warning.

This was intended merely to make the nomenclature about base ring consistent across the geometry component...

I can not reproduce the timeout from the patchbot.
