# Issue 24592: zero_matrix() should pass the correct zero

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/24829

The method `zero_matrix()` passes `coerce=False` to the matrix class constructor. If so, it should pass the correct zero of the base ring, not `int(0)`.

This bug causes segfaults in #24742 because the `coerce` flag is honored in more cases.
