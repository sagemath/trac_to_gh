# Issue 23620: Implement cppstr() to convert any C++ object to str

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/23857

In order to clean up the wrapping of C++ code, we need conversion of C++ objects to a string. This is currently done in a hacky way in `ccobject.h` but we propose a much cleaner interface using more modern Cython features.

This is nice! How did you test the Python3 version?

To be honest, I did not. I am just hoping that it works.
