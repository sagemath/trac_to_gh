Hello,

Why is it a cached method?

The thing is that caching costs (in memory) and these methods do not (in time). So I really do not see the point. Do you agree to also "uncache" the `vertex_graph` method?

I think that in most cases, the use of cached method is dirty programming (though it is very cool in development phase).

I am always using this with generic linear forms where every edge is not parallel to the kernel of the form. I then turn the digraphs into posets. Anyway, I have replaced `>` by `>=` so that doubled edges are added when this happen. This will raise an error when I use the Poset constructor, so I am happy with that.

I have also added a keyword to ask for the reverse orientation.

How can I check if the input is a linear form ?

Replying to [comment:12 chapoton]:
> How can I check if the input is a linear form ?

I uploaded a patch that checks if the input is an instance of `VectorSpaceMorphism` whose codomain has dimension 1.

I removed from the doc the possibility to input a list or a tuple since it was not working in the previous version (it is doable to try/except `f = vector(f)` but i am not sure we have to think for the user).

> I have also added a keyword to ask for the reverse orientation.

It works well. Do you have some important reason to go in the decreasing direction by default ? If not, i would prefer to have it the other way by default, to be consistent with the MILP default, but perhaps i miss some other use case.

ok, thanks.

I have made it increasing by default, as you seem to prefer it so.

I have added a test to check that the orientation is correct.

I have also removed an usused import and made two minor pep8 changes.
