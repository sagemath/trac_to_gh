# Issue 23342: Error with NumPy's np.random?

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/23579

Original creator: mforets

Original creation time: 2017-08-03 21:34:08

Keywords: numpy, random, documentation

Accessing the docstring of NumPy's `random` module is broken:


```
sage: import numpy as np
sage: np.random?
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
NotImplementedError: Column or row spanning cells are not implemented.
```

In the future, please try to remember to *post the traceback*.

As I understand the trace, IPython calls obj.getdoc() to get the docstring. This is intercepted by Sage's inspection module which does its own cleanup of docstrings (instead of a function in `inspect`) and this cleanup (Sphinx?) barfs on some details in the docstring.

This is not a problem anymore in current versions of Sage, such as 9.2.
