# Issue 25210: Support all GiNaC substitution flags

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: rws

Original creation time: 2018-05-27 05:29:11

The `ex.subs()` command only allows `flags=0`, so for example patternless substitution of wildcards is not possible:

```
sage: w1 = SR.wild(1)
sage: sin(w1).subs(w1==x)
x
```

(here the default algorithm matches w1 to the whole expression)
