There are a couple of things to fix in the [documentation](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/sage/categories/finite_coxeter_groups.html) of Finite Coxeter Groups, like: 

#. Codifying `self`, `True`, `False` and so on... 
#. The recursive algorithm in the docstring of method `bruhat_upper_covers` needs fixing. 

Minor "defects" but will improve consistency.
