Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: knsam

Original creation time: 2013-02-02 15:38:16

Assignee: mvngu

Keywords: beginner

There are a couple of things to fix in the [documentation](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/sage/categories/finite_coxeter_groups.html) of Finite Coxeter Groups, like: 

#. Codifying `self`, `True`, `False` and so on... 
#. The recursive algorithm in the docstring of method `bruhat_upper_covers` needs fixing. 

Minor "defects" but will improve consistency.

There are some other things we could fix: I think we could take this ticket to fix some of the todos in this ticket. I need help from you guys. For a start, I'd like to fix the name for the method `long_element`. 

I'll do the other to-dos in a short while (two weeks) and post a patch.

I propose to just use this ticket for the trivial correction already in the commits.
