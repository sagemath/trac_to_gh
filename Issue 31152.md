In an editable install of sagelib (#31377), the `tdlib` subdirectory is considered as a namespace package directory, causing the failures reported on that ticket.

We fix this by moving the file `tdlib/sage_tdlib.cpp` (the only file in that subdirectory) one level higher.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31389

I tried it and it looks good to me, but may be I have not tested it enough. Should I do something special apart testing that doctests pass ?
