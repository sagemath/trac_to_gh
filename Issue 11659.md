At the Mathemagix conference in Paris, Hans Sch√∂nemann answering to
one of my questions said that the `Proof=false` option for multivariate
polynomial factorization over prime fields would not longer be needed up
from Singular 3.1.3 (i.e., the corresponding bug should be fixed in
Singular).

Thus one could remove that option once Singular 3.1.3 is within Sage.
