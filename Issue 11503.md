This is a recurrent question in the sage-support list. I considered appropriate to add a couples of lines in the FAQ to mention some SAGE important environmental variables.

Special attention is given to *SAGE_BROWSER*, since this is the most common variable change by new users. This is briefly mentioned in the paragraph "What are Sageâ€™s prerequisites?" but in my humble opinion, it would be nice to have a paragraph addressing exactly this question. It is not probable that people wanted to specifically changing the default browser will not look to Sage pre-requisites.

It should perhaps specifically differentiate between variables (mostly) related to building, and those important in "daily use".

I'm also in favour of supporting `~/.sagerc` to put frequently used options / settings  etc. into (i.e., a shell script that is sourced by `sage`).

I simply add the most relevant environment variables to the FAQ. A link to all variables (including those used during building) is also provided for more interested readers.

> I'm also in favour of supporting `~/.sagerc` to put frequently used options / settings  etc. into (i.e., a shell script that is sourced by `sage`).

I completely agree with you!
