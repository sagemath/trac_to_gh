It seems you did a typo when filling the "Dependencies" field of the ticket (a very old closed ticket).

I'm curious what you plan to use this for, but the package is fine.

One detail: there are long lines in `SPKG.txt` which should be wrapped to < 80 chars. If you fix this, you can set the ticket to positive_review.

Make a small wrapper to get polynomials over RR and CC and have an efficient complex multiprecision FFT.
