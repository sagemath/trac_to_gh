I haven't done a full review yet, but most of what I've tried has worked well. Here are a couple quick comments.

- need doctests that test the ring parameter and algorithm parameter (can be either embedding or field)

- 'alg' = True is very non-descriptive. Keep in mind there are only two options currently implemented, but that doesn't mean we couldn't implement further options for algorithms later. Better to name the algorithms something rather than just check Boolean.

- embeddings doesn't work for .periodic_points()

```
P.<x,y>=ProjectiveSpace(QQ,1)
K.<v>=QuadraticField(5)
phi = QQ.embeddings(K)[0]
f=DynamicalSystem_projective([x^2-y^2,y^2])
f.all_periodic_points(ring=phi)
f.periodic_points(1,R=phi)
```

A couple minor formatting fixes mainly with the doctest.

I also modified how the algorithm selection is done as it wasn't quite working correctly.

You need to add some examples testing the all the code paths.
