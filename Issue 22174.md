Isn't that part of #20136 or #21437?

Maybe it could be made part of those. It will certainly conflict with #21437.

Since I'm already working on this anyway, let me continue and then look at what should happen.

I'm adding a simple patch here which makes sense by itself. Further changes will be for other tickets.

LGTM. But would the patchbots test this with the optional meataxe package installed?

Only the patchbots which have meataxe installed. I believe that `arando` does at least.
