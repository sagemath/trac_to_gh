Why did you keep `len` with this change:

```diff
-    if len(entries) == 0 and ring is None:
+    if not len(entries) and ring is None:
```

Otherwise LGTM.

I was forced to reintroduce this one, because its removal was causing many failing doctests.

Probably has to do when `entries` is an `ndarray`. Anyways, it is a micro-optimization. Thanks.
