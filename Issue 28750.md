As I wrote in #28936 I don't really see the advantage, but, as long as it doesn't hurt...

how should this be tested? I don't know much about tox, especially I don't know what is really does, besides that it's a kind of venv in which some magic happens.

All I can find is #28936#comment:5 - which points at some tox config I don't know how to use.
