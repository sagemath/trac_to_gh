* trac_13369-cluster_seed-cs-NEW.patch is an exact copy of trac_13369-cluster_seed-cs.patch, except in quiver.py where the change to lines 97-100 now apply to lines 201-204 instead.  (Also one typo fixed.)

This was done because trac_13369-cluster_seed-cs.patch no longer applies after recent changes to 10538, although it really was only this four line conflict.

* More substantially, trac_13369-cluster-seed-gm.patch fixes compatibility issues with recent changes to 10538 and 10527.  One can now apply all patches in 10527 in order, then all patches in 10538 in order, then the *two patches*

trac_13369-cluster_seed-cs-NEW.patch followed by trac_13369-cluster_seed-gm.patch,

and then the rebuilt sage passes all doc tests and appears to work correctly.

* A more substantial review will be forthcoming.

Replying to [comment:2 gmoose05]:

I just renamed and uploaded the two relevant patches without any changes.

Also, despite the patchbot's inability to apply the patches, it works fine with 5.3.rc1 on my machine (with the 10527 and 10538 patches applied first).

Both patches rebased according to the new lazy import. No other changes.

Hi,

I updated my first patch (and uploaded Gregg's patch without changes). This resulted in some missing doctests which I then added in yet another patch. We also had some old things in the ClusterVariable class which I removed. If we need that back later, we can do it in another ticket...

Cheers, Christian

Changing keywords from "cluster algebra, quiver" to "cluster algebra, quiver, days45".
