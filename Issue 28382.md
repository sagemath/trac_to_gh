# Issue 28382: Reference manual doesn't build with --include-tests-blocks

Blocks starting with `TESTS` are omitted, by default, in the reference manual, but can be included by passing `--include-tests-blocks` to `sage --docbuild`. The goal here is fix errors in the docstrings so that building with this option actually works.
