# Issue 16462: degree of multivariate polynomial rings with weighted degree is inconsistent

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/16699

Original creator: lftabera

Original creation time: 2014-07-22 11:01:24

Keywords: weighted degree

Depending on the type fo the ring (Singular vs polydict) the return of degree differs.


```
sage: R1.<x,y>=PolynomialRing(QQ,'x,y',order=TermOrder('wdeglex',(2,3)))
sage: (x+y).degree()
3
sage: R2.<u,v>=PolynomialRing(QQ['t'],'x,y',order=TermOrder('wdeglex',(2,3)))
sage: (u+v).degree()
1
```

This looks good to me, passes the tests! 

Though some bot seems to be unhappy with this ticket, I have not been able to find a problem so that I turn it to `positive_review`.
