# Issue 10343: Polyhedron incorrectly handles RR-vertices

Issue created by migration from Trac.

```
sage: p = Polyhedron(vertices=[vector(RR, [1/2, 3/4]), vector(RR, [4, 5])])
sage: p
A 0-dimensional polyhedron in QQ^2 defined as the convex hull of 1 vertex.
sage: p.vertices()
[This is the Trac macro *0, 0* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#0, 0-macro)
sage: p = Polyhedron(vertices=[vector([1/2, 3/4]), vector([4, 5])])
sage: p
A 1-dimensional polyhedron in QQ^2 defined as the convex hull of 2 vertices.
sage: p.vertices()
[[1/2, 3/4], [4, 5]]
```

I think that the first case should give either a numerical polyhedron or at least an error message.

Changing keywords from "" to "sd40.5".

There is some change in this behaviour:

```
sage: Polyhedron(vertices=[vector(RR, [1/2, 3/4]), vector(RR, [4, 5])])

Would be nice to have a better error message or handle it - if I replace RR with RDF there is still an error despite RDF support with `field=RDF`.

This is fixed by #11763, which brings sanity to coercion as a side-effect:

```
sage: Polyhedron(vertices=[vector(RR, [1/2, 3/4]), vector(RR, [4, 5])])
A 1-dimensional polyhedron in RDF^2 defined as the convex hull of 2 vertices
```
