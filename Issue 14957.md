the exceptions are not properly imported there, and there are no doctests for them:

```
sage: delsarte_bound_additive_hamming_space(11,3,4,d_star=9)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
NameError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

    261       try:
    262         bd=p.solve()
--> 263       except sage.numerical.mip.MIPSolverException, exc:
    264         print "Solver exception: ", exc, exc.args
    265         if return_data:

NameError: global name 'sage' is not defined
```


Attached is the patch that puts in proper imports for MIPSolver exceptions, and doctests for them.

Not sure what is up with the patchbot. It applies and doctests just fine.
