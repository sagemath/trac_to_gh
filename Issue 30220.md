Agree with all the `occur*` fixes here.

One comment about the removal of the `CommonR = ...`
line at the end of this if/else block:


```diff
 if hasattr(PARENT,'_P'):
     CommonR = PARENT._P
 else:
     VarList = set([])
     for P in TODO:
         if P._p!=0:
             if P.is_unit(): # self generates all of PARENT
                 if RStrat is not None:
                     RStrat.add_generator(PARENT(1))
                 return SymmetricIdeal(PARENT,[PARENT(1)], coerce=False)
             VarList = VarList.union(P._p.parent().variable_names())
     VarList = list(VarList)
     if not VarList:
         return SymmetricIdeal(PARENT,[0])
     VarList.sort(key=PARENT.varname_key, reverse=True)
     from sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_ring_constructor import PolynomialRing
-    CommonR = PolynomialRing(self.base_ring(), VarList, order=self.ring()._order)
```


This block is at lines 502--518 of `src/sage/rings/polynomial/symmetric_ideal.py`.

Since the value of `CommonR` set in this block is not used after that
(whether it was set in the "if" or in the "else" part), and neither
is the value of `VarList`, the whole if/else block could become:


```diff
if not hasattr(PARENT, '_P'):
    VarList = set()
    for P in TODO:
        if P._p != 0:
            if P.is_unit():  # self generates all of PARENT
                if RStrat is not None:
                    RStrat.add_generator(PARENT(1))
                return SymmetricIdeal(PARENT, [PARENT(1)], coerce=False)
            VarList = VarList.union(P._p.parent().variable_names())
    VarList = list(VarList)
    if not VarList:
        return SymmetricIdeal(PARENT, [0])
```


This could be done here or elsewhere,
as quite distinct from the rest of the present ticket.

Possibly `PARENT(1)` should be `PARENT.one()`.

In `src/sage/graphs/generic_graph.py`, while we're at it, maybe fix plural:


```diff
-            # We count the number of occurrence of each distinct label
+            # We count the number of occurrences of each distinct label
```

And regarding `R(1)` vs `R.one()` here is one more:


```diff
- return SymmetricIdeal(self.ring(), [self.ring()(1)],
+ return SymmetricIdeal(self.ring(), [self.ring().one()],
```

Maybe fix "can not" -> "cannot"? or maybe
do that at a wider scale in another ticket.

Then positive review.

Changing `R(1)` to `R.one()` and `R(0)` to `R.zero()`
at scale could also be another ticket.

rebase, just fixing an easy conflict in combinatorial_face.pyx
