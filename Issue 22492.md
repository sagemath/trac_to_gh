This ticket exposes (by turning on a flag) certain nontrivial data computed in the `hecke_series` which is currently hidden from the user. This may be (is) useful in other applications of A.Lauder's code.

a question: in the second function

```
+      the integers ``elldash`` and ``mdash``.
```

shouldn't elldash be ell ?

Oops, I think that the email got buried among others...

I still think that it should say what it says. The integer ell can be deduced from the size of the matrices in Alist...

Thank you for looking into this!
