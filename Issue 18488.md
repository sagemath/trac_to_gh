Keywords: topological manifolds

This ticket implements morphisms of topological manifolds, i.e. continuous maps between topological manifolds. This is a follow-up of #18640 within the [SageManifolds project](http://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/). See the metaticket #18528 for an overview.

Two new Python classes are introduced in this ticket:
- the parent class `TopManifoldHomset` for sets Hom(M,N) of morphisms between two 
  topological manifolds M and N over the same topological field K
- the element class `ContinuousMap` for elements of Hom(M,N), i.e. continuous maps M --> N

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/18725
