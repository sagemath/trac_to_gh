# Issue 18488: Topological manifolds: morphisms

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/18725

Original creator: egourgoulhon

Original creation time: 2015-06-18 08:21:09

Assignee: egourgoulhon

Keywords: topological manifolds

This ticket implements morphisms of topological manifolds, i.e. continuous maps between topological manifolds. This is a follow-up of #18640 within the [SageManifolds project](http://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/). See the metaticket #18528 for an overview.

Two new Python classes are introduced in this ticket:
- the parent class `TopManifoldHomset` for sets Hom(M,N) of morphisms between two 
  topological manifolds M and N over the same topological field K
- the element class `ContinuousMap` for elements of Hom(M,N), i.e. continuous maps M --> N

The above commit takes into account [this discussion on sage-devel](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/Vzfj1haZHho) and on ticket #18529: it removes `UniqueRepresentation` for the class `TopologicalManifoldHomset`, leaving only `WithEqualityById`.

[2577fc5](http://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/commit/?id=2577fc55c357f3ecefc5f7bdc4ad43ef9b145b0e) was meant to go on #18640. However, #18640 will merge in with this cleanly (at the very minor cost of a merge commit). The other option would be to start a "new" branch here rebased on #18640.

Okay, I made it through this ticket. I made a number of formatting changes and little tweaks that I think improves the doc (including a few I missed on the previous ticket). I also made aliases `*expression` of `*expr` because it is good to be verbose, made some things ``@`cached_method` rather than doing attribute caching, and used the ``@`options` decorator for some `plot()` options. If you agree with my changes, you can set a positive review.

Thank you very much for all the improvements. I've made a few checks on the impact on the subsequent tickets in #18528 (especially regarding the changes in `TopologicalManifoldHomset.__call__`); they all passed. So I am setting the ticket to positive review.
