# Issue 27752: remove _r_action_ and _l_action_ from docs, and code

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27989

_r_action_ and _l_action_ are in the docs, despite removed in #5597

quick grepping through src/sage/ shows that  _r_action_ is never defined/used (only mentioned in commented out code
or in messages), and  _l_action_ is defined exactly once, in `src/sage/rings/multi_power_series_ring_element.py`
and only used there, once.

So none of this is understood by any coersion/etc frameworks.

A documentation bug, I suppose (and probably a bug in `src/sage/rings/multi_power_series_ring_element.py`, which uses
wrongly named stuff...)

I would somehow prefer to make the whole "action" business flexible enough that the parent of a method can define _via categories_ (I think that's the point that currently is lacking) which method of the element shall be used for the action. But I definitely should dive into the code before giving any recommendations...

As the Sage-8.8 release milestone is pending, we should delete the sage-8.8 milestone for tickets that are not actively being worked on or that still require significant work to move forward.  If you feel that this ticket should be included in the next Sage release at the soonest please set its milestone to the next release milestone (sage-8.9).

If you see the original discussion:

https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/q_672YMI4m4

the issue is not just to remove _l_action_ and _r_action_, but to document how to implement coercion for action properly using _act_on_ and _acted_upon_, instead of now non-existing _l_action_ and _r_action_

oh, well. This can be done in 2 different tickets, I think.

I have opened a separate ticket for the documentation: #28017

I suggest to merge this ticket with #28017, to which I just pushed a patch. Then Frédéric and I could be coauthors for the patch. And then we can close this ticket as invalid.

There is no need to merge. Let us just do one thing after the other.

I don't see a problem to continue on #28017, which I am currently testing etc.
