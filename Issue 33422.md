You have a bunch of extra files in here which probably should not have been in there (e.g. html).  I would make a clean branch with only the actual changes in it (i.e., don't just delete those files and then commit again).

Changing type from PLEASE CHANGE to enhancement.

There are also some formatting issues with very long lines - we tend to want something like 72-character lines for easy viewing in Terminals (or at least that used to be the case).

please never use "import *"

```
+src/sage/combinat/independence_posets.py:38:1 'sage.graphs.independent_sets.IndependentSets' imported but unused
+src/sage/combinat/independence_posets.py:39:1 'from sage.combinat.cyclic_sieving_phenomenon import *' used; unable to detect undefined names
+src/sage/combinat/independence_posets.py:302:25 'out' may be undefined, or defined from star imports: sage.combinat.cyclic_sieving_phenomenon
+src/sage/combinat/independence_posets.py:715:5 local variable 'D' is assigned to but never used
```

should the branch here be replaced by

```
u/nathanwilliams/independence_posets
```

or not ?


---

Comment by chapoton created at 2022-05-07 18:09:26

```

and you should rather act in your own name, not under Nathan's login and name
