The only `README.txt` I found is on the sagemath website when going to "Download" and then "Mac OSX". It does not tell anything about the three different format of installation.

Searching the Sage repo on GitHub for "readme":

- search: https://github.com/sagemath/sage/search?q=readme

reveals three files

- [README.md](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/master/README.md)
- [build/README.txt](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/master/build/README.txt)

I added a few more things that I know about. I made quite a few minor changes, mostly related to the correct spelling/casing of trademarks and fixed some sentences that I stumbled upon.

Something that I am still not sure about: Should we consistently call this thing Sage or [SageMath](SageMath)? Currently it's still a bit of a mix though I replaced most instances of Sage with SageMath…something that we might want to revert.

Anyway, I don't think we should strive for perfection here. This had already been quite an improvement :)
