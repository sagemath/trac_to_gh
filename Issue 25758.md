Update the instructions in the installation guide

```
+OS X dmg
+--------
+
+A possible alternive on OS X is to use ``app.dmg`` or ``dmg`` files. Such
+installation will automtically create shortcuts on your desktops. Simply
+follow the section "Download Guide" above and download the ``dmg`` file
+corresponding to your system.
+
+TO BE FINISHED
```


And earlier you also have something about which one is best.  There is a separate readmeosx file somewhere which will answer many of your questions here; the short version is that app.dmg is better for those wanting a GUI, dmg is better for those only wanting command line access.  tar.gz is definitely not preferred for mac

The only `README.txt` I found is on the sagemath website when going to "Download" and then "Mac OSX". It does not tell anything about the three different format of installation.

Searching the Sage repo on GitHub for "readme":

- search: https://github.com/sagemath/sage/search?q=readme

reveals three files

- [README.md](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/master/README.md)
- [build/README.txt](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/master/build/README.txt)
- [src/sage/ext/mac-app/README](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/master/src/sage/ext/mac-app/README)

The last one might the one kcrisman has in mind.

Oops, I missed some. Searching again for "mac"

- search: https://github.com/sagemath/sage/search?q=mac

I found these two too:

- [src/bin/sage-README-osx.txt](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/master/src/bin/sage-README-osx.txt)
- [src/mac-app/tools/createDSStore/README.txt](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/master/src/mac-app/tools/createDSStore/README.txt)

Thanks Samuel! It is definitely `src/bin/sage-README-osx.txt` and this file will be removed by this ticket (or more precisely, replace its content with "go read the installation manual").


---

Comment by kcrisman created at 2018-08-07 20:57:44

Whoah Nelly!  But note that that file actually shows up in the dmg created (if you open it it appears in a nice Mac-specific Finder way).  So be careful about this, and be sure to have someone test with a Mac on a app dmg, possibly also regular dmg.

`This content of this file has been moved to the installation guide`. That's not correct, is it? It has been moved to the mac-app README hasn't it? Should we just delete this file?


---

Comment by saraedum created at 2018-08-22 03:37:05

I added a few more things that I know about. I made quite a few minor changes, mostly related to the correct spelling/casing of trademarks and fixed some sentences that I stumbled upon.

Something that I am still not sure about: Should we consistently call this thing Sage or [SageMath](SageMath)? Currently it's still a bit of a mix though I replaced most instances of Sage with SageMathâ€¦something that we might want to revert.

Anyway, I don't think we should strive for perfection here. This had already been quite an improvement :)

No! This file is distributed together with the macOS applications. You can see that in `25995`

```diff

Let just write that this file has moved then...

I moved the Linux instructions and updated the fact that you absolutely need the documentation (otherwise `?` is just broken).

I think this is in good enough shape for now. What do you think?

In the future we might want to update instructions for optional packages (Arch Linux provide some with `pacman` and `pip install` does work).

I don't understand. The file in `src/bin/` is not distributed with the macOS app anymore. So why do we need it?

Sure. It's fine to tell people to install documentation. Note that the `?` bug is fixed in #25786 which needs review :).

> I think this is in good enough shape for now. What do you think?
Yes, it looks good to me. Have you had a look at the generated HTML?

> In the future we might want to update instructions for optional packages (Arch Linux provide some with `pacman` and `pip install` does work).
Sounds good. But let's put this into another ticket.

I tought it was (my modification in the Makefile is just changing the path). I don't have a mac and I will not try to find one to test it. Let me post something on sage-devel.

I can test it on a mac if you want me to.

If you have time to do so, please do! See also [this post on sage-devel](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/S3afK1C-bnA).

I'm not quite sure what the question is here, but here are my comments: first, running `make` from `src/mac-app` works for me with this branch. Second, I think you could just delete the (now very small) file `src/bin/sage-README-osx.txt`, since you've moved the important parts to `src/mac-app/`, and that's the natural place for that information.

Thanks for checking! Does the sage-README-osx.txt is inside the mac-app produced?

I will delete the one in `src/bin` following your advice.

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2018-08-23 18:42:40

The correct `README.txt` file is produced in the top-level of the `.dmg` file. (And the tiny `sage-README-osx.txt` file in `src/bin` is present in the app, also.)

Comment by saraedum created at 2018-08-23 22:59:36

Hmâ€¦I don't see what could possibly breakâ„¢, but let me try to build it anyway.


---

Comment by kcrisman created at 2018-08-24 00:12:16

Thanks esp. to jhpalmieri for checking out that this all is still working!


---

Comment by saraedum created at 2018-08-24 00:26:57

Sorry, I can't test this on my macOS as I cannot upgrade to a version that is supports xcode (and I don't want to hack around to install an old xcode.)

Comment by vdelecroix created at 2018-09-01 15:07:57

Could we set to positive review then?
