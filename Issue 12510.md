# Issue 12510: Fix "hardcoded" 'gcc' in ratpoints 2.1.3 [p2]

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/12682

Keywords: spkg CC compiler hard-coded

The upstream `Makefile` defines `CC` to `gcc`, which could be overridden by using `make CC="$CC" ...` in `spkg-install` (similar for `INSTALL_DIR`, which the `Makefile` defines to `/usr/local`).

The updated spkg patches the `Makefile` to let `CC` just _default_ to `gcc`, and take the value of the environment variable `CC` if the latter is defined (which is _always_ the case in Sage, but that doesn't matter).  Similar for `INSTALL_DIR`, such that `spkg-install` can (and does now) make use of the `install-lib` target, also quoting the target filenames to allow spaces in `$SAGE_LOCAL`.

I've also cleaned up `SPKG.txt` and `spkg-install` a little; the latter now also uses `$MAKE` instead of `make`.

I'm not sure whether we should add running some tests (there's a `test` target which does use the built library), or even add an `spkg-check` script; if so, perhaps on a follow-up ticket.  [See also my comment in `SPKG.txt`.]

Diff between the p2 and my p3. For reference / review only.

Diff between the vanilla Makefile and the (patched) one of the p3.  For reference and (better) review only.

I would just pass the environment variables to `$MAKE` to keep the size of our patches down. Our goal should be zero patches. The `$INSTALL_DIR` stuff should be quoted, though. Can we report that upstream?

Well, of course we could.  Using `?=` is IMHO also more convenient and less error-prone (although less portable, i.e., not supported by all `make`s, which probably matters _to upstream_), especially if you have a couple of invocations of `make`, and/or a couple of variables to override.

If we submit a patch upstream, we should also add an alias `check` for the `test` target, and probably more.  I just needed a quick solution... ;-)

The best thing is always(?) to have a `configure` script which _generates_ the Makefile(s) such that we don't have to patch them.  (Cf. Lcalc, which Rishikesh wanted to "autotoolize" a while ago...)  For some (small) packages this would of course be a bit overkill.

works well and looks good!

FYI, it doesn't appear as if upstream is too concerned with portability, considering ratpoints uses a few gnu extensions (such as inline functions)

Changing keywords from "spkg CC compiler hard-coded" to "rd2 spkg CC compiler hard-coded".

I think you mean nested functions.  "inline functions" are perfectly fine C99 or C++.

yes, that is what I meant :)
