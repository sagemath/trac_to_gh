The current branch provides the new functionality and gives a short "howto" use Python's logging module.

What is left: Update the whole Sage-library to use the new sage.misc.verbose.verbose (it's syntax compatible).

Old sage.misc.misc.verbose is deprecated. Once the deprecation period is over, we can switch to sage.misc.verbose.* in the global name space.

It's not about the OS. 
Python's logging, or rather the way that this patch intends to use it to replace the verbose facility, "does not work" in SageMathCloud. Try this example, from the patch on this ticket, in SMC.

```
+    sage: import logging
+    sage: logging.basicConfig()
+
+Setting the level::
+
+    sage: logging.getLogger().setLevel(logging.INFO)
+
+Log something::
+
+    sage: logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
+    sage: logger.info('Hello. I am talking to you.')
+    INFO:__main__:Hello. I am talking to you.
```

Yes, I've looked at this before. Can you (or someone else who is knowing something about these stream handlers) include the relevant part(s) of code here in the branch on this ticket?

I've added something based on that code.
Doesn't work yet with the Jupyter notebook, either because there's already a handler installed when `basic_sage_logging_config` is called or something overrides it later. This needs investigating

About SageMathCell - logging is already used there with the relevant file https://github.com/sagemath/sagecell/blob/master/log.py

I don't recall much detail by now, but when I was making things work the problem was that IPython and tornado are trying to install their own loggers as well and perform global initialization if they don't detect one present. Listing all loggers/handlers after startup in a particular environment may be helpful to figuring out what to do.

The upstream fix for the logging problem in Jupyter notebooks appears to be fixed in newer versions of ipykernel. 
#22125 upgrades to 4.5.2, which should be new enough (haven't tested).
Is it possible to add doctests for this?
