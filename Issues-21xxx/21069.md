Because `ClonableArray` also takes the parent into consideration of equality checking, we currently have the following:

```
sage: Permutations([1])[0] == Permutation([1])
False
```
I propose to have `Permutations(range(n))` be *identical* to `Permutations(n)`.

I think this is more an issue with the default `_cmp_` in `ClonableArray` wanting to have a common parent, but there are not coercions between most combinatorial objects (nor should there be typically). IMO, this is even worse:

```
sage: Permutations([1])[0] == Permutation([1])
False
```
However, I don't agree with the argument that "same representation => equality". Should the partition `[2, 1]` equal the permutation `[2, 1]`? (Currently they do, but I think that is a small issue and you should not rely on this behavior.)

 ```
-sage: Permutations([0])[0] == [0]

-This is unexpected as

-Both have the same string representation and
