Because `ClonableArray` also takes the parent into consideration of equality checking, we currently have the following:

```
sage: Permutations([1])[0] == Permutation([1])
False
```
I propose to have `Permutations(range(n))` be *identical* to `Permutations(n)`.

No because nobody should be using `_set` (nor do we have to respect it) because it is hidden.

> 2. Is the time to call `StandardPermutations_n` higher than for `Permutations_set`? (I suspect it is, if only due to things like `cat = FiniteWeylGroups().Irreducible() & FinitePermutationGroups()`.) Is this relevant?


I don't understand what you're asking. If you're saying putting `StandardPermutations_n` as a superclass of `Permutations_set`, then we should not do that. It is too much of a can of worms and far outside the scope of this ticket.

There are already such tests, so it really should not unless you're constantly doing things like `[1,2,...,n,'a']`. I also doubt it would be the bottleneck in a loop.
