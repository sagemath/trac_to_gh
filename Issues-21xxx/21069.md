Because `ClonableArray` also takes the parent into consideration of equality checking, we currently have the following:

```
sage: Permutations([1])[0] == Permutation([1])
False
```
I propose to have `Permutations(range(n))` be *identical* to `Permutations(n)`.

 ```
-sage: Permutations([0])[0] == [0]

-Both have the same string representation and
