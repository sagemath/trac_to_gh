This patch will add a helper function to `hasse_diagram.py` to check that a subset of elements is convex in a poset.

Will be needed to check user input for Alan Day's doubling construction.

What is `x` here:

```python
lambda v: [v for v in self.neighbor_out_iterator(x) if v < s_max and s not in ok]
```
I don't see it in the code. Also, at present it seems like that function could be pulled out of the `for` loop.

What the hell I did? Should be `b`, but I do not know how this happened and was not catch by doctest. Now compiling and re-checking.

> I don't see it in the code. Also, at present it seems like that function could be pulled out of the `for` loop.


I don't understand. The idea is to (try to) found an element `a` in S covered by element `b` not in S and then check if some directed path from `b` goes to some element `c` in S.

This was an interesting case. Basic "bug" is just a feature, and can be seen with

```
sage: g = Graph(42)
sage: for x in g.depth_first_search(0, neighbors=lambda v: junk(v)):
....:     print(x)
```

which will output `0` and only after that gives error message. So I really must re-check my code and make a doctest that will catch error like this one.

Looks good. Two trivial things:

- I'm paranoid, but anytime there is latex, I like to use raw strings: `r"""`
- Could you break this line:
  {{{#!diff
-neighbors = lambda v_: [v for v in self.neighbor_out_iterator(v_) if v <= s_max and v not in ok]
+neighbors = lambda v_: [v for v in self.neighbor_out_iterator(v_)
+if v <= s_max and v not in ok]
  }}}

You can set a positive review on my behalf.
