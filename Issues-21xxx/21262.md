```
We propose the addition of the following methods and classes to skew polynomials: 
1. class `CenterSkewPolynomial_generic_dense`
2. class `SectionSkewPolynomialCenterInjection`
3. class `SkewPolynomialCenterInjection`
4. class `CenterSkewPolynomialRing`
5. def center in class `SkewPolynomialRing_general`

In addition, we designed a special class `SkewPolynomial_finite_order_dense` for dense skew polynomial over fields when the twisting endomorphism has finite order (in which case the centre has finite index). It includes the following methods:
- `reduced_trace`
- `reduced_norm`
- `is_central`
- `bound`
- `optimal_bound`

Note: The original ticket #13215 first introduced this functionality (only for finite fields). That was subsequently modified to support the basic implementation of skew polynomials and the center based methods from that ticket that were removed are being reintroduced here. 


Depends on #13215
Depends on #29452

Please also note that the current code is more or less just what was in the original patch for #13215 related to Center related methods and classes. No effort has e.g. been made yet to accommodate for changes in #13215 since this addition was factored out.

As I said before, the features provided by this ticket do not only make sense for finite fields but more generally for fields on which the twisting endomorphism has finite order. I then renamed the class `SkewPolynomial_finite_field_dense` and called it `SkewPolynomial_finite_order_dense`. 
Moreover, I polished the code and made all methods work (e.g. some imports were missing). 

Ticket ready for review.

I am a strong -1 on using `UniqueFactory` in place of `UniqueRepresentation`. All of that code should be in `SkewPolynomialRing_general`, and it would be better to make it a `__classcall_private__` so you don't have to handle the `element_class` in the key and the input data is only normalized on the main entry point. Actually, I don't immediately see the need for this and why it cannot just be set in subclasses...

You can also do away with the `self._polynomial_class` attribute in place of `self.Element`.

For the coercions, it probably would be better to use

```
center_inject.register_as_coercion()
```
There also is a new mechanism for doing base ring injections. See #29247 and #19225. So you should use

```
def _coerce_map_from_base_ring(self):
```

Many reasons. You don't need the flexibility of `UniqueFactory`. It spreads out the implementation, entry point, and functionality. For instance, the entry point is a separate class from the actual object, and the unpickling is not handled within either object. Since the implementation is separate from the entry point, you get this:

```
sage: F.<x,y> = FreeAlgebra(QQ)

----> 1 isinstance(F, FreeAlgebra)

TypeError: isinstance() arg 2 must be a type or tuple of types
```
This makes code maintenance harder since there is no indication within the particular class that it should have the unique representation behavior. I find more black magic is involved with `UniqueFactory` than `UniqueRepresentation`. I don't see what is harder to comprehend either; both require someone telling you about the magic.

Also, today, I don't completely agree with the design choices I made about 8 years ago, e.g.:
- now, I don't think that it's a good idea to have specific classes for the centre (namely `CenterSkewPolynomialRing` and `CenterSkewPolynomial_generic_dense`) because they don't inherit extra methods when the base ring has extra structures (for example, if we are working over a finite field, the center is a polynomial ring over a finite field for which more functionalities are available); on the other hand, the benefit of having a separate class is (I think) to provide tools to handle coercion properly (since currently the center remembers the skew ring); a solution could be to let the `center` method return a classical polynomial ring together with the embedding into the skew ring, I don't know
- on a related note, I don't think that it's a good idea either to use the name `(x^r)` for the name of the central variable because it is not alphanumeric, which could be the source of many problems, e.g.:

```
sage: k.<a> = GF(5^3)
sage: Frob = k.frobenius_endomorphism()
sage: S.<x> = k['x',Frob]
sage: Z = S.center()
sage: Z.change_ring(k)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: variable name '(x^3)' is not alphanumeric
```
- I'm not sure that it's a good idea to have two spellings for the same method (`center` and `centre`): it's not really useful and it appears to be quite annoying for tab-completion

What's your opinion on these points?

Thank you. I appreciate you going back to `UniqueRepresentation` here. Actually, below reminded me of another good thing: you don't get either duplicate or two separate documentations for the same object. Here are my answers to your questions.

1 - It might be worthwhile to make a façade parent for the center, which can have some extra methods attached to it by the elements are just normal polynomials. I guess it depends on how much extra features you want the center to have. If it is just about how they retract to the full skew polynomial ring, then I would just do as you suggest and return a normal polynomial ring over a finite field and implement the to/from maps in the skew poly ring.
2 - I concur. Maybe `xpr` for the variables?
3 - I agree. We generally use the American spellings in Sage.

Some of these comments below might not apply as you refactor the code.

Another suggestion I have would be moving the doc from `SkewPolynomial_finite_order_dense.__init__` to the class level. This way you could also add a test for the `__init__` that runs the `TestSuite(foo).run()`. This also makes it easier in the compiled doc and using `?`.

```diff
-We check that the reduced trace is additive:
+We check that the reduced trace is additive::
```

```diff
-`K[X,\sigma] / K[X,\sigma]*P` (which is a `K`-vector space
+`K[X,\sigma] / K[X,\sigma] P` (which is a `K`-vector space
```
(At least, I think you don't want the `*` here in the latex result, but maybe you do.)

The `EXAMPLES of VARIABLE NAME CONTEXT::` block is over-indented.

The `__classcall_private__` will need some doctests that check that it handles the uniqueness well or raises errors in cases you want it to.

A good option might be

```python
category = Algebras(base_ring).or_subcategory(category)
```
as this handles `None` as an input in the way you'd expect and makes sure nobody passes something strange like `Manifolds()`.

You still have `self._polynomial_class` in the center class.

See [comment:15](#comment%3A15) with `_coerce_map_from_base_ring`. This could simplify your `CenterSkewPolynomialRing.__init__` implementation.

OK, I addressed all your comments. I finally decided to remove the class `CenterSkewPolynomialRing` and to add the keyword argument `coerce` to the method `center` to let the user choose if he/she wants to set a coercion map or not.

I don't understand why:

```
Element = sage.rings.polynomial.skew_polynomial_finite_order.SkewPolynomial_finite_order_dense
```
fails (see line 1301 of `skew_polynomial_ring.py`), giving the error

```
AttributeError: module 'sage.rings.polynomial' has no attribute 'skew_polynomial_finite_order'
```
Any idea?

I think that is a little sketchy because it depends on the order the modules are imported. I would make an explicit top-level import of

```python
from sage.rings.polynomial.skew_polynomial_finite_order import SkewPolynomial_finite_order_dense
```
and then do `Element = SkewPolynomial_finite_order_dense`. There shouldn't be a circular dependency as the element classes (usually) do not need to know generically about the precise parent class, and the methods that do can just import it locally.

Beyond that, it looks good. Thank you. I do have one last question: Why is the default for the center to not have it as a coercion map?

There was actually circular dependencies passing through `sage.matrix.matrix_dense.Matrix_dense` but I removed this import and rewrote the methods `_matphir_c` and `_matmul_c` accordingly.

I've hesitated but I think it's safer like this. The reason is that if the user has already created (in the same session) a polynomial ring over the fixed field with the same variable name, then his ring will be automatically endowed with my coercion map, which could be not desired.

Can you explain a bit more about the circular import you got? It seems like there shouldn't be one and I would think removing the `matrix_dense` import is not the best strategy.

I don't see why they would reasonably have a separate polynomial ring that would not behave like the center, call the center, but then do something coerce into the skew polynomial ring. That sounds like a logic bug. Being able to turn off the coercion is good to find this and fix it, but I don't see how this would be applied incorrectly and not be a true bug.

You can ignore the startup modules as that is not always the most reliable patchbot module. (It passed on one of the patchbot reports.) The bigger issue is the docbuild failure.

Well, simply adding

at the top of `skew_polynomial_finite_order.pyx`, I get this error when I start sage:

Well, it's a common operator to create a polynomial ring over a finite field (at least for me). So I easily imagine I create a polynomial ring over `GF(5)` for some reason and, later on in the same session (for some related reason), create a skew polynomial ring over `GF(5^3)` and compute its center. In that case, I won't probably want the two constructions to implicitely interfere.
(But I confess that coercion into the skew ring won't probably cause many troubles.)

It's fixed (hopefully).

So the issue comes from the call to `sage.rings.all` rather than the individual files that define these fields. The `sage.rings.all` calls `sage.rings.polynomials.all`, which then tries to import the skew polynomial ring, and hence the cycle. So to me there are two "good" ways to break this:

1. Make the skew polynomial rings a lazy import.
2. Change the `sage.matrix.args` to import from the specific files that define `ZZ, RDF, CDF`:

   ```python
   from sage.rings.integer_ring import ZZ
   from sage.rings.real_double import RDF
   from sage.rings.complex_double import CDF
   ```

That is the point. This will not cause any problems in the computations that you would do. This wouldn't create some strange different coercion path or override an action that otherwise would be there. Could this be a problem though: **F**<sub>5</sub>[x][y,\sigma] and then the center is **F**<sub>5</sub>[x]?

Yes, probably; I let `coerce=True` to be the default.

I think not. Because **F**<sub>5</sub>[x] coerces to **F**<sub>5</sub>[x][y,\sigma] and therefore creation another coercion or conversion map from **F**<sub>5</sub>[x] to **F**<sub>5</sub>[x][y,\sigma] will raise an error in both cases.

Ah, right, very good point. However, that would be a strange error message for the uninformed, so there probably should be a `..

Actually, I'm happier with my new implementation of `_matphir_c` and `_matmul_c` which doesn't use `MatrixSpace`, and so the faulty import is no longer required.

I changed the error message if the creation of the coercion/conversion map fails (although I think that this case won't happen shortly because the method `center` is only available when the twisting map implements the methods `order` and `fixed_points`, which is only the case for Frobenius endomorphisms so far).

Actually it doesn't because it's not allowed (for safety, as explained in the documention of the method `sage.structure.parent.Parent.register_coercion`) by the general coercion mecanism.
So, I added a doctest showing that this raises an error.

Done.

I am not too surprised it does that, but I would have thought Sage would allow the promotion of a conversion map to a coercion. Well, at least it is documented so users are aware of it.

I agree that it could be nice to have this in sage; a possibility could be to implement a new method `promote_to_coercion(self, ring)` in the `Parent` class.
If you agree, I propose to open another ticket to discuss this.

Also, thinking again at all of this, I am worried by the following: if the default variable name `z` leads to an error for some reason, then the methods `reduced_trace` and `reduced_norm` won't work. At least, I think we should add a keyword argument `var` in those methods to let the user specify the variable name he wants.

Going further, I also think that it would be nice to allow for customizing the default central variable name. Maybe, we can have a method for this and/or update it each time a new center (i.e. with a new variable name) is created.

I just pushed an implementation of this.
And I also deciced to abandon the option `coerce=False` because it causes too much troubles (especially in the methods `reduced_norm` and `reduced_trace` which are both calling `center`, it was not clear which value should be passed in).

I agree that it is causing too many problems.

You can get rid of the gender issue by

```diff
-However, the user can speciy a different variable name if he/she wish::
+However, the user can specify a different variable name if desired::
```
(Note also the typo.)

I think you should explain a little bit more about `default` in the `INPUT:` block, perhaps saying something like <code>if \`\`True\`\` then set the default variable name for the cener to be \`\`name\`\`</code>

Hmm, there was still a problem:

```
sage: k.<a> = GF(7^4)
sage: phi = k.frobenius_endomorphism()
sage: S.<x> = k['x', phi]
sage: (x^4).is_central()
True
sage: Z.<u> = S.center(); Z
Univariate Polynomial Ring in u over Finite Field of size 7
sage: S.center()
Univariate Polynomial Ring in z over Finite Field of size 7
```

On the last line, the variable name is `z` but it should be `u`. The reason is that the call to `is_central` creates a center and then sets the default variable name.

My last commit fixes this.

With a specific variable like this, there is almost surely no chance of it being selected. Granted, 10 random letters is highly unlikely to produce something used. The other argument would be consistency across sessions.\n\nAlso, don't you want to actually create the `_working_center` in this case?

I don't think it makes a difference other than 1 line for other users if they want to modify it.

It won't have random failures. For example, it could choose a variable that is already used one time then work the next. With a specific variable like this, there is almost surely no chance of it being selected. Granted, 10 random letters is highly unlikely to produce something used. The other argument would be consistency across sessions.

Also, don't you want to actually create the `_working_center` in this case? Actually, why not just use this fixed (dummy) variable as `_working_center` instead of the current try-except? One extra parent for each instance isn't going to make much difference in terms of memory.

<div id="comment:59" align="right">comment:59</div>

Actually, I see a problem with always using the same variable name for the "working" center.
Assume that, for some reason, somebody needs to implement a method like this in the class `SkewPolynomialRing` (or one of its derivative):

```
    def my_method(self):
        center = self._working_center
        z = center.gen()  # z = DUMMY_SKEW_VAR_CENTER
        ring = center.quo(z^2 + 1)
        twist = ring.hom([-z])
        skew.<T> = SkewPolynomialRing(ring, twist)
        ...
```

and assume that the user runs the following session:

```
sage: k.<a> = GF(5^3)
sage: Frob = k.frobenius_endomorphism()
sage: S.<x> = k['x', Frob]
sage: S.my_method()
```

Then, when `S` is defined, Sage creates the ring `GF(5)[DUMMY_SKEW_CENTER_VAR]` together with a coercion map into `S`. Now when we call `my_method`, the fixed point of `twist` is again `GF(5)` and so the call to `SkewPolynomialRing` recreates the ring `GF(5)[DUMMY_SKEW_CENTER_VAR]` and now set a coercion map into `skew`, taking `DUMMY_SKEW_CENTER_VAR` to `T^2`. But we also have coercion maps `GF(5)[DUMMY_SKEW_CENTER_VAR] -> ring -> skew` where the composite maps `DUMMY_SKEW_CENTER_VAR` to `z`...

I confess that, currently, this bug can't happen because `twist` does not have a method `order` but it clearly shows that using always the same variable name for the center may cause subtle troubles.

Below, I propose a new implementation avoiding random choices of variable names (and thus being more canonical and reproducible in some sense).

I don't know if it's a bug in `register_as_coercion` or if the user is supposed to check by himself consistency of the coercion model before calling it.
