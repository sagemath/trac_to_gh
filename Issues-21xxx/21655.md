Expected behaviour:

```
sage: hermite(n,x).diff(n)
diff(hermite(n, x), n)
```
for all cases where we throw runtime or not implemented errors at the moment. This concerns mostly orthogonal poly functions. The aim is a better workflow for the user, with no interrupts.

Do you have an idea about what needs to be done in case someone decides to work on this? Ie, some tips about how to start?

The runtime errors are partly thrown in Pynac, they should return `fderivative` instead like is done with anonymous functions:

```
sage: f=function('f')(x)
sage: diff(f,x)
diff(f(x), x)
sage: _._dbgprinttree()
fderivative f @0x3dc6b00, hash=0x1023d72de5409a, flags=0xb, nops=1, params=0
    x (symbol) @0x3049d20, serial=5, hash=0xf0a9622e, flags=0xf, domain=0, iflags=0000000000000000
    =====
```
The others are errors thrown in Python. I'm not sure which will be simple to change.
