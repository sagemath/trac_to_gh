The "relative distance" of a linear code is `d/n`, where `d` is the minimum distance and `n` the length of the code. This is a quite useful number that some coding theorists use. This should be available for any linear code in Sage. 

Note that it should be implemented on the class `AbstractLinearCode` to be available to both `LinearCode` and specific families of codes such as `GeneralizedReedSolomonCode` or `HammingCode`.
