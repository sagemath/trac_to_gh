This ticket is meant to improve support for Linux with [vm.overcommit = 2](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/vm/overcommit-accounting).

In Sage, the PARI stack takes a large amount of virtual memory but only a small part is usually used.

When allocating memory, this memory is "committed" which means that it is made available as virtual memory. However, as long as a program is not using that memory, this costs nothing because the kernel does not need to make available actual memory (physical or swap) for it. This is different with `vm.overcommit = 2`: then all committed memory is counted. In that case, even unused virtual memory means that the system will have less memory available.

This can be solved by using the `PROT_NONE` flag of [mmap(2)](https://linux.die.net/man/2/mmap). This means that the memory cannot be read nor written. In this case, the kernel does not commit this memory (it does show up as virtual memory in `top`). Note that this is not actually documented anywhere, but that is how it works.

This branch adds a PARI patch which implements this `PROT_NONE` trick. We first allocate the PARI stack in the usual way (so the maximum stack size is limited by the available virtual memory, which makes sense) but then uncommit most of the stack by reallocating it with `PROT_NONE`.

Finally, note that this patch does not functionally affect PARI (but I did run doctests just in case).

I just want to add that I don't really like that this seems to be relying on undocumented (as far as I can tell) low level memory management features, though it is behavior that seems to be used by other libraries that have interesting memory management strategies, such as openJDK and jemalloc. So be it.

Indeed. It seems to be a more-or-less known trick, but it's not officially documented.

#21622 has an explicit instruction to merge it together with #21582 (this ticket). That did not happen.

Instead, please merge this together with #21637, which also includes a PARI version bump.
