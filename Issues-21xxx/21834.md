```
For minpoly, the current code states that it constructs the multiplication matrix which is suboptimal in the trivial case where the element lies in the prime field.

And even in non-trivial cases we should not go this way but use Shoup's algorithm which is implemented in PARI.


Before:

```
sage: K.<z> = GF(461**173)
sage: %timeit K(55).minpoly()
100 loops, best of 3: 3.21 ms per loop
```

After:

```
sage: K.<z> = GF(461**173)
sage: %timeit K(55).minpoly()
1000 loops, best of 3: 207 µs per loop
```

<a id='comment:8'></a>With my changes the doc is wrong.
E.g. for extensions using PARI, in the "matrix" case, it is actually PARI charpoly function which is used.

While fixing this, I'll also fix the charpoly general case.

Voucl we deal with that in another ticket?

<a id='comment:15'></a>- Maybe add a doctest for the `"matrix"` option of `minpoly()`? 
- The doctest for `charpoly()` should be changed: it tests PARI twice.
- Are you sure the doctest of `FiniteFieldElement_pari_ffelt.minpoly()` tests the correct field? I have the impression that's a Givaro field.

More generally, I was wondering: some day Givaro may implement minimal polynomials, and we may override `minpoly()` in `FiniteField_givaro`. At that moment, the doctest in `element_base.pyx` may become stale without us noticing.

Similarly, what if someday we decide that `GF(19^2)` should be implemented by a different subsystem?

I have the impression that doctests that rely on some mathematical object being implemented by some specific subclass are very brittle. Is there a better way to write these doctests so to be sure that they call the right method?

You're right I spotted taht one but wanted to exercice the reviewer :/

Sure...
We could also decide to implement _minpoly in subclasses and let the minpoly in Finite... class use that by default if it exist or fallback when given an algorithm.
But that sounds horrible and complicated, doesn't it?

We could force the super class method to be called.

Create the field using

```
sage: GF(19^2, impl="pari_ffelt")
```
if you want that implementation.
