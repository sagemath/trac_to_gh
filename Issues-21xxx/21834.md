For minpoly, the current code states that it constructs the multiplication matrix which is suboptimal in the trivial case where the element lies in the prime field.

And even in non-trivial cases we should not go this way but use Shoup's algorithm which is implemented in PARI.


Before:

```
sage: K.<z> = GF(461**173)
sage: %timeit K(55).minpoly()
100 loops, best of 3: 3.21 ms per loop
```

After:

```
sage: K.<z> = GF(461**173)
sage: %timeit K(55).minpoly()
1000 loops, best of 3: 207 Âµs per loop
```

With my changes the doc is wrong.
E.g. for extensions using PARI, in the "matrix" case, it is actually PARI charpoly function which is used.

While fixing this, I'll also fix the charpoly general case.

I'm not quite satisfied by the current situation:
* maybe we could have a "matrix" option for minpoly doing either the charpoly of the matrix and getting the right factor or just calling minpoly on the matrix
* the "charpoly" option for minpoly is not that useful :/ it would only be for a class implementing a very fast charpoly and no minpoly.

Does anyone think anything?

About the class name, it seems it was meant to represent any finite extension of a finite ring.
But it also seems it is only used for finite fields extensions at the moment.
And that some functions in there might be finite field specific...

Voucl we deal with that in another ticket?

Sure...
We could also decide to implement _minpoly in subclasses and let the minpoly in Finite... class use that by default if it exist or fallback when given an algorithm.
But that sounds horrible and complicated, doesn't it?
