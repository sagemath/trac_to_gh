I don't think the change to `sage_src_pari()` makes sense because it makes the assumption that the code is being run directly from the sage source tree.  Of course, that's the typical case. But the code is not otherwise designed in such a way that that *must* be the case, nor do I think it necessarily should be.  I like the way it was done better.

And I do think it is a reasonable assumption that the current working directory at build time is the  source directory (*). Most `setup.py` files make that assumption, so if you see this `sage_setup` stuff as an extension of `setup.py`, it makes perfect sense.\n\n(*) To be very precise, let's define the source directory as the directory containing `setup.py`, which is `$SAGE_SRC = $SAGE_ROOT/src` in Sage.",

> I don't think the change to `sage_src_pari()` makes sense because it makes the assumption that the code is being run directly from the sage source tree.


Let me clarify: that code is only meant to be run during the *build* of Sage. And I do think it is a reasonable assumption that the current working directory at build time is the  source directory (*). Most `setup.py` files make that assumption, so if you see this `sage_setup` stuff as an extension of `setup.py`, it makes perfect sense.

(*) To be very precise, let's define the source directory as the directory containing `setup.py`, which is `$SAGE_SRC = $SAGE_ROOT/src` in Sage.
