Let me clarify: that code is only meant to be run during the *build* of Sage. And I do think it is a reasonable assumption that the current working directory at build time is the  source directory (*). Most `setup.py` files make that assumption, so if you see this `sage_setup` stuff as an extension of `setup.py`, it makes perfect sense.

(*) To be very precise, let's define the source directory as the directory containing `setup.py`, which is `$SAGE_SRC = $SAGE_ROOT/src` in Sage.
