<a id='comment:3'></a>I must say I had to check that we already have a directive in `flint.pxd` as I couldn't see `flint` being added again.

There are several instances of `# distutils: libraries = flint` in `pxd` files inside `sage/libs/flint`, are they all needed? I would have thought some of them could be trimmed.

Do you have concrete suggestions about which ones should be removed?

Why should we remove `# distutils: libraries = flint` from a file just because it happens to `cimport` a file which also has `# distutils: libraries = flint`? Imagine that we remove that and that somebody in the future decides to stop `cimport`ing `sage.libs.flint.fmpz_vec`. Then you get breakage.

I prefer that each `# distutils` directive declares whatever is in *that* file, regardless of which other things it happens to `cimport`.
