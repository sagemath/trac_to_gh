I must say I had to check that we already have a directive in `flint.pxd` as I couldn't see `flint` being added again.

There are several instances of `# distutils: libraries = flint` in `pxd` files inside `sage/libs/flint`, are they all needed? I would have thought some of them could be trimmed.

Do you have concrete suggestions about which ones should be removed?

This is actually documented in `src/sage/libs/pari/types.pxd` but not in other `types.pxd` files.
