To make installing Perl modules easier on Mac OS X, we should set the ARCHFLAGS environment variable. This is to make sure that the output of `perl -MExtUtils::Embed -e ldopts` and `perl -MExtUtils::Embed -e ccflags` (picked up from system `perl`) do not contain `-arch` flags incompatible with our gcc.

This simplifies `perl_term_readline_gnu` (#20894), `polymake` (#20892), and makes installing `pypolymake` (#21170) as a pip package possible.
