```
sage: R = QQbar['s,t']
sage: type(R({(1,2): 3}).coefficients()[0])
<type 'sage.rings.integer.Integer'>
```
but it should be an element of `QQbar`.

This results in an error in the laurent polynomial code:

```
sage: L.<a,b> = LaurentPolynomialRing(QQbar)
sage: (a+a*b) // a
```
raises an `AttributeError` as an Python `int` does not have a `divides`-method. (The Python `int` comes from line 1600 in `laurent_polynomial.pyx`, but the true problem is the one at the top.

<a id='comment:3'></a>The branch u/dkrenn/laurent-floor-hash does at least fix the symptome, so that

```
sage: L.<a,b> = LaurentPolynomialRing(QQbar)
sage: (a+a*b) // a
```
returns a result.
