```

upon trying to install automake 1.9.

This also left the autoreconf script installed by sage broken:

```
autoreconf: Entering directory `.'
autoreconf: configure.ac: not using Gettext
autoreconf: running: aclocal -I m4 --output=aclocal.m4t
/home/embray/src/sagemath/sage/local/bin/aclocal: line 25: /home/embray/src/sagemath/sage/local/automake-1.15/bin/aclocal: No such file or directory
autoreconf: aclocal failed with exit status: 127
```

It would be nice if sage packages didn't actually install anything into `$SAGE_LOCAL` until it has successfully built.

Manually going into the automake-1.9 source directory and copying the `config.guess` from my system's `/usr/share/automake-1.15` allowed it to build.

Actually, ended up just

```
find . -name 'config.guess' -exec cp /usr/share/automake-1.15/config.guess {} \;
```

I wonder if some variant of this wouldn't be good to include in the build scripts for the spkg (without hard-coding `automake-1.15` of course).  In other words, just take the latest `config.guess` from the system, if it exists.

Sage provides more or less up to date config.* scripts.
You can try to modify the spkg-install script to copy them at build time to let the build proceed...
But maybe installing autotools on a cygwin setup is not the best idea :/

For now I hand-edited the Makefile.build to copy my working config.guess to the proper place when building all the automakes, so I've kicked off that build.

In the meantime I've edited `spkg-write-makefile` (will post a patch soon) to add such a step to the makefile (the details are subject to debate; I haven't thought it through fully).  Once I've bootstrapped my $SAGE_LOCAL with a working autotools build I can re-run `spkg-write-makefile` to provide an updated `Makefile.build` as well.
