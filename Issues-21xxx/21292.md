This changed the output checker to add an `# ignored` flag that can be used in doctests to run a line of a test but not check its output.  Actually this is just a renaming of the existing `# random` flag, without the semantic weight of calling a result "random".  "random" is still kept as an alias for "ignored" both for backwards compatibility, and because it *could* be useful as a semantic indication that some output truly is expected to be random.

This is useful for cases like the one I described [here](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/3-rnq2QgWTQ/1NvKKteeAwAJ), where for documentation purposes it's nice to display the output of some code, but that output may not be reliable across platforms, and ultimately does not affect the result of the test.

(Just about one sentence I'd say.)

Why did you add `?:` to the `ignored_marker` regex???

On second thought, there's so many cases of `# random` in the source code that if I try to change it it may conflict with just about every other unmerged branch.

Perhaps it should suffice to just update the documentation to suggest using `# ignored` instead of `# random` and keep the latter deprecated.

And what is the semantic difference between "not reliably deterministic" and "random"? I think you are trying to see a difference where there is none.

Again, I'm not strictly against this ticket, I just wouldn't bother...
