```
as a step towards python3

replace xrange by Python3-style range, after

"from six.moves import range" (as fast as xrange)

here only in the combinat folder

* mechanical replacement of xrange by range
* insertion of the imports in the changed files
* fine tuning by hand so that tests pass

Depends on #21374

It is about 10x slower to use the new range:

```sage
sage: %timeit for x in range(500000): pass
100 loops, best of 3: 12.5 ms per loop
sage: %timeit for x in xrange(500000): pass
100 loops, best of 3: 6.32 ms per loop
sage: from builtins import range
sage: %timeit for x in range(500000): pass
10 loops, best of 3: 111 ms per loop
```
So I am -1 for changing the `xrange -> range` now. All of these we should be able to do by running `sed` on the code base when we switch to python3.
