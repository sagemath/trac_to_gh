Fixes numerical noise in a single doctest in `sage/matrix/matrix_double_dense.pyx` on Intel Haswell.

The doctest fails when doing a native build with any GCC version that
supports Haswell:

```

I've simply increased the tolerance from 1e-14 to 1.1e-14.

It even fails with Sage's GCC, without setting any `*FLAGS`, and without setting `SAGE_ATLAS_ARCH`, in the latter case at least sometimes, as ATLAS-tuning is a bit non-deterministic.
