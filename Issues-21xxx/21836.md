This patch will add functions to get meet- and join-prime elements of a lattice.

Test code:

```
def join_primes_trivial(self):
    result = []
    for x in self.join_irreducibles():
        if all(self.le(x, a) or self.le(x, b) for a, b in Subsets(self, 2) if self.le(x, self.join(a, b))):
            result.append(x)
    return result

set_random_seed(42)
for _ in range(1000):
    L = Posets.RandomLattice(15, 0.99)
    if sorted(L.join_primes()) != sorted(join_primes_trivial(L)):
        L.show()
        break
    if sorted(L.meet_primes()) != sorted(join_primes_trivial(L.dual())):
        L.show()
        break
else:
    print("OK")
```

For "multiloop breaks", you could split that into a small function within `prime_elements` (which doesn't need to be doctested). Right now the code just looks somewhat fugly.

Yep. Python is not easy when the code should be recursive and try to found a "solution" in some sense. Only good way I know is to raise an exception like `FoundSolution()`. This is not recursive, and so not that bad, but anyway not easy.

> Two other little things: Does the iteration order for `upset` matter? Considering you're doing containment checking, you should make it a `(frozen)set`. Also

Good point! Order does not matter for the validity of the code. For speed I guess it will only matter for special cases like vertically decomposable lattice.

`set` is faster. For `BooleanLattice(10)` it is about 7-times faster, and for all lattices of 11 elements about 10% faster. There is no measurable difference between `set` and `frozenset`.

Whatever. I alreaydy thinked about that, and they are both as good to me.

So, the question remains if we shall accept `break-else-continue-break-else` -structure for speed or not.

Annoyingly, Python doesn't have a `goto` statement. However, pulling it out into a separate internal function as I originally suggested resulted in a 2x speedup:

```sage
sage: L = posets.BooleanLattice(10)
sage: %time L._hasse_diagram.prime_elements()   # My branch
CPU times: user 24 ms, sys: 4 ms, total: 28 ms
Wall time: 20.6 ms

sage: %time L._hasse_diagram.prime_elements()   # Your branch
CPU times: user 56 ms, sys: 12 ms, total: 68 ms
Wall time: 57.6 ms
```
This is due to the (much) more complicated logic of your `break`-`else` statements.

If you agree with my changes, then you can set a positive review.

I was not able to reproduce that much speedup. But anyways your version is faster, and easier to read. Thanks!

Lesson to learn for me: (internal) function call in Python is very cheap.
