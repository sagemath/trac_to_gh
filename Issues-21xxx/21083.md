Yes upstream is me for all that's worth [in a maintenance capacity only) and I meant to do this. Anyway those issues were technically addressed in 0.8.7, `brial` should compile with C++11. The only issue is that you need at least C++98. If we decide to default it to C++11 we must make sure that the sage extension is also compiled with C++11.
