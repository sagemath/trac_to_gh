We currently work around BRiAl 0.8.5 not building in C++11 mode by passing `-std=c++98`, which is odd.

**Fixed upstream**: [https://github.com/BRiAl/BRiAl/issues/11](https://github.com/BRiAl/BRiAl/issues/11)

Also the patch from https://github.com/BRiAl/BRiAl/pull/15 is added, which is needed for #23943.

**Tarball**: https://github.com/BRiAl/BRiAl/releases/download/1.0.1/brial-1.0.1.tar.bz2

Yes upstream is me for all that's worth [in a maintenance capacity only) and I meant to do this. Anyway those issues were technically addressed in 0.8.7, `brial` should compile with C++11.

So you mean add `--with-boost-unit-test-framework=no` as `./configure` flag and then run the testsuite as usual?
