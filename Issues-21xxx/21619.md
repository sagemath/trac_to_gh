Two issues I could not solve due to lack of expertise in sage:

-reuse a plain polynomial ring over ZZ and 


-reuse Singular polynomial ring over QQ

instead of creating a new one every time,

        # if I understand nrnMapGMP/nMapFuncPtr correctly we need first

+        # todo (later): reuse ZZr

+        rComplete(ZZr,1)
```

```
