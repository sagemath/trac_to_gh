Leif mentioned on sage-devel:

```
3) Probably disable the color mode. 
```

I'm not sure what he means with that, but just typing ```%colors NoColor``` after the weird sage prompt doesn't help.

Here's a simple change that enables "simple prompts" when sage is run within an Emacs inferior shell. 
However, as has been noted [here](http://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/24453/weird-shell-output-when-using-ipython-5), the "simple prompts" mode lacks multi-line support, so one gets this:

```
In [1]: def f(x):
  File "<ipython-input-1-cde3fd95d55b>", line 1
    def f(x):
             ^
SyntaxError: unexpected EOF while parsing
```

A few remarks :

* The [current patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/92378caa0c1a030b9399e889f42edb5afc8c6d87) waits endlessly for a prompt.
* When interrupted (C-G), it gives a functional prompt : the Sage REPL is working.
* When inline plots are enabled, they are displayed, but the sustems claims (falsely) to have launced a png viewer.
* When tyepeset output is enabled in the menu, the output is displayed as text :

```
In [24]: integrate(arctan(x),x)


BEGIN_TEXT:x*arctan(x) - 1/2*log(x^2 + 1):END_TEXT
BEGIN_LATEX:\newcommand{\Bold}[1]{\mathbf{#1}}x \arctan\left(x\right) - \frac{1}{2} \, \log\left(x^{2} + 1\right):END_LATEX
```
* Ditto when using the `%display typeset` magic...

//"Oooohhh, so clooose..."//

HTH,

I did it (not quite sure yet whether I like Ubuntu 16.04...)

Anyway: `M-x sage-shell:run-sage` starts sage and I can evaluate stuff.

* I have no tab-completion (the modeline says: "No match")
* sending a buffer to the `*sage*` buffer breaks emacs `(Error running timer: (wrong-type-argument bufferp nil)` occupies the modeline and won't go away anymore.

I am using sage 7.4.beta1 with the patch on this ticket applied, emacs is 24.5.1.  Running `emacs -q` and then in `*scratch*`:

```
(require 'package)
package

(add-to-list 'package-archives
             '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/"))
(("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/") ("gnu" . "http://elpa.gnu.org/packages/"))

(package-initialize)
t
(setq sage-shell:use-prompt-toolkit 'T)
T
(setq sage-shell:sage-root "~/SAGE")
"~/SAGE"
```
and finally

```
M-x sage-shell:run-sage
```
gives

Wow!  I think you are getting very close!

* tab completion works
* sending a buffer with `C-c C-c` to the sage buffer works, also loading a file with `C-c C-l` works.
A little suggestion: if the current buffer is a visited file in sage mode, it would be nice to have `C-c C-c` load the file instead, asking whether to save the buffer if necessary.  Because:

```
sage: load('/tmp/sage_shell_mode17030j9Q/sage_shell_mode_temp.sage')
```
doesn't give me a clue which file I actually loaded!

* unfortunately, sending a line to sage does not work correctly:

```
sage: load('/tmp/sage_shell_mode17030j9Q/sage_shell_mode_temp.py')
  File "/tmp/sage_shell_mode17030j9Q/sage_shell_mode_temp.py", line 3
    sage: fricas('3 * 5')                                                       # optional - fricas
        ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```
I think it doesn't strip the "sage:" anymore - was this done by ipython before?

How difficult would you estimate porting your fixes would be?

But perhaps rather: should we take this as a cue to merge the efforts of `sage-shell-mode` and `sage-mode`; after all, they're trying to do more or less the same. The current maintainer of `sage-mode` is Ivan Andrus but my impression is that he is really only maintaining - not developing. `sage-shell-mode` is much more vibrant in comparison! My impression is that `sage-shell-mode` currently does completion better than `sage-mode`, but `sage-mode` can render latex and images. There might also be small differences in how editing directly in the shell works?

My own contributions to `sage-mode` are modest: I've written the current help file/landing page, I wrote a small set of functions, `sage-blocks.el`, for giving light-weight notebook-like editing, and I've helped report and track down some bugs. Rather than porting fixes to `sage-mode`, I would be interested in trying out `sage-shell-mode` and lending a hand on implementing the features that would make it a great alternative for current `sage-mode` users. I'm also an `eVil`-user, so I would naturally be testing/modding `sage-shell-mode` to work under those conditions.

Best,
Johan

I don't want to handle escape sequences if possible. But developers of IPython choose `prompt_toolkit` rather than `readline` and `prompt_toolkit` uses a lot of escape sequences. Therefore I think `sage-shell-mode` should handle them. And I don't want to use the simple prompt workaround at the moment.

That would be great!

Another tiny problem: saying

```
(sage-shell:define-alias)
```
in `.emacs` doesn't work - must it be in `.emacs.d/init.el`?

```
Warning (initialization): An error occurred while loading `/home/martin/.emacs':

I suggest to close the ticket, since `sage-shell-mode` now works very well, as far as I can tell.

**Thank you stakemori!

The optional package `sage-mode` does not work anymore, so it probably should be moved to experimental or something similar.

I have no idea how to do any of this, though.

To do this, `sage-shell-mode` has to renamed to `sage-mode` or `sage`. This is convention of elisp.

If mkoeppe's request to `prompt_toolkit` is accepted, `sage-mode` will be resurrected. So concerning with alias or renaming, I will see how it goes for a while.

Thank you for your good work, Johan!

I sent a PR (https://github.com/sagemath/website/pull/95) to https://github.com/sagemath/website.
