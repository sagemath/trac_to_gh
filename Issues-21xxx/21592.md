See for example `isogeny_graph()` on elliptic curves over the rational numbers: http://sage-doc.sis.uta.fi/reference/curves/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_rational_field.html. The note "The vertices are labeled 1 to n - -" is not shown at all. The reason is

```
.. note:
```

that should be

```
.. note::
```

According to

```
egrep -R -i '^ +\.\. note:$' src/sage
```

there are 19 files with this bug and a total of 34 lines to correct.

(Also this patch corrects some "Dieudonne" to "Dieudonné".)

Perl is... perl.

```
find src/sage -name '*.py' -or -name '*.pyx' -or -name '*.pxi' | xargs perl -e 's|(^ +)\.\. note:(?=$)|$1.. note::|g;' -p -i.bak
```

Anyways, this should work. Not tested yet, just compiling.

Just that I didn't remember that. Thanks!

Next question: what to do for blocks that have

```
.. note:

Not indented block here.
```

? Or how to found them automatically?

Uh, I don't like Sphinx.
