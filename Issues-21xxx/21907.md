Of course, one could ask for a better error message.

<a id='comment:2'></a>I don't understand. The documentation seems to clearly state that non-integral values are allowed:

```
This definition is valid for arbitrary complex order s and for all complex 
arguments z with |z|<1; it can be extended to |z|≥1 by the process of analytic 
continuation.
```
And non-integral values are accepted in my testing:

```
sage: polylog(1.1 + 2.2*I, 3.3 + 4.4*I)
