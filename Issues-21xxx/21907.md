This seems to be invalid. `polylog(x,x)` is not correct, the first argument must be an integer.

Of course, one could ask for a better error message.

I don't understand. The documentation seems to clearly state that non-integral values are allowed:

```
This definition is valid for arbitrary complex order s and for all complex 
arguments z with |z|<1; it can be extended to |z|≥1 by the process of analytic 
continuation.
```
And non-integral values are accepted in my testing:

```
sage: polylog(1.1 + 2.2*I, 3.3 + 4.4*I)                                                        
-13.9758786469542 + 8.16803654165145*I
```

PS I think the documentation should tell us which parameter is `s` and which is `z`. (And I find the phrase "complex order s" to be confusing.)
