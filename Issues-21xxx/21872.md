Are you sure that installing a *conversion* map is the right solution? In many similar situations, there is no such map:

```
sage: K.<I>=NumberField(x^2+1)
sage: K(1) in QQ
True
sage: QQ._convert_map_from_(K) == None
sage: P.<t>=ZZ[]
sage: P(1) in ZZ
True
sage: ZZ._convert_map_from_(P) == None
True
sage: L.<u>=FunctionField(QQ) #this is one of your cases
sage: L(1) in QQ
False
```

It might be worth checking how these other cases succeed in making this work, and why they're doing it. It might be because their methods predate the coercion framework, but it might also be because introducing cycles in the conversion graph is not preferred.

nbruin: Thanks for having a look at this.

Conversion to `ZZ` works differently:

```
sage: sage: K.<I>=NumberField(x^2+1)
sage: ZZ.convert_map_from(K)

Conversion via _integer_ method map:
  From: Number Field in I with defining polynomial x^2 + 1
  To:   Integer Ring
sage: ZZ.convert_map_from(QQ)
```
So, this path does not apply for function fields.

Asking for a conversion to `QQ`:

```
sage: QQ.convert_map_from(K)
Conversion map:
  From: Number Field in I with defining polynomial x^2 + 1
  To:   Rational Field
```
so a `DefaultConvertMap_unique` which

```
    […] defers action to the codomain's
    element_constructor method, WITHOUT passing in the codomain as the
    first argument. […]
```
i.e., the target ring needs to understand what to do with the elements. I certainly do not want to teach the rational ring what a function field element is.

Finally, cycles in conversions are no problem. Conversions are not automatically composed (unlike coercions.)

For the conversion down to the constant base field, I do not really have an option. (I would have to change `_convert_map_from_` for `Field` or something similar.)

```
sage: K.<x> = FunctionField(QQ)
sage: from sage.rings.function_field.function_field import FunctionField_polymod
sage: K.<x> = FunctionField(QQ)
sage: R.<y> = K[]
sage: # work around caching by calling the class directly
sage: %timeit FunctionField_polymod(y^2-x, 'y')
```
Yes, object creation time does go up here from 332 µs to 555 µs. I am not sure if that is an issue. Function fields are cached after all, and I have a hard time imagining someone to create tons of them with different defining polynomials. I implemented this with `_convert_map_from_` on the level of function fields (but I still need the `register_conversion_map` for the constant base field) which gets this number down to 440 µs. Imho, the code is substantially less readable that way. So, about 110 µs seems to be the cost of a call to `register_conversion_map`.

David, what do you think?

I don't have immediate examples, although I could imagine that fibred surfaces (either arithmetic or otherwise) might give rise to such a scenario. The bottleneck could arise if someone wants to try something really easy with the fibers, but ends up creating the fibers as curves and perhaps creating the function fields as an unintended side-effect.

Indeed, but I would suggest being a little conservative with implementing this. Can we first just install the conversion to the base ring and not transitively close over all the base rings below that?

Incidentally, you have to be very careful about how you implement the conversion maps to the base rings. They will be cached on the codomain (i.e., on the base ring), so you should make sure you're *not* storing any references to the domain or its elements in the map object. All of that needs to be recovered from the argument (this is part of the reason why conversion to ZZ is implemented the way it is).

Otherwise, you'll see that function fields over QQ end up not being garbage collected, because an eternal object (QQ) is keeping a reference to them in the form of registered conversion maps.
This is why maps in the coercion system do NOT store their domain. See #14711 for some of the black magic that was required.

So, one thing you should probably test is that

```
K.<t>=FunctionField(QQ)
P.<X>=PolynomialRing(K)
c=1
while True:
  L=K.extension(X^2-t^2+c*t)
  u=QQ(L(1))
```
doesn't leak.

Good point; I think the current implementation has this problem.

#14711 is interesting.  I'll have to think about how that should affect conversions.  But the memory leak issue definitely should be addressed.

I assume you want to increment `c` inside your loop.

Thanks for all the input. I had not thought about leaks here.
Sadly, `_make_weak_references()` does not do the trick.
The `register_convert_map` implementation has a line that says `self._convert_from_hash.set(mor.domain(),mor)` which does not seem to use weak references.

you probably mean "an element of the function field that lies in the base field". All elements of the function field are defined *over* the base field by definition.

Elsewhere: be careful with calling subfields "constants". For instance, the function field `QQ(x)[y]/(y^2-2)` has as constant subfield `QQ(sqrt(2))`, whereas the base field is QQ. Finding the exact constant field (i.e., the algebraic closure of the base field in the function field) takes considerable computation, so I'm not sure this is part of the scope of this ticket.
