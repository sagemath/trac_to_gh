Note that there is

```
    def max(m):
        m = list(m)
        return m[0].max(*m[1:])
```
defined a couple of lines above, so this is IMO indeed what is wanted.

And, eigenvalues are not there for inexact rings:

```
sage: Matrix(RIF, [[1,2],[4,5]]).eigenvalues()
/opt/sage/8.6/src/bin/sage-ipython:1: UserWarning: Using generic algorithm for an inexact ring, which will probably give incorrect results due to numerical precision issues.

> You would better use arb matrices whose multiplications are infinitely faster than the generic Sage matrices (which is what is used for mpir). With this change, you can write direct C code for the routines `max`, `min`, `rho`, `pp` and `p`. Even if your input are rational matrices, I bet that it is better to first convert them to real ball matrices. Carrying large numerators/denominators is most of the time a terrible idea.


I agree that using matrices over `QQ` is not ideal, but with the eigenvalue discussion I do not see much other choices here.

And, after all, this should be a first implementation to compute something at all. Improvments later on are very welcome.

And there is also

```
def rho(M):
   return max(R(abs(v)) for v in M.eigenvalues())
```
which is incorrect (since here `R=RIF` (at least in the default situation)).
