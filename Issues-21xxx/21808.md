Currently, `gen.python()` is the same as `gen.sage()` which returns Sage objects. There should be a pure Python version, returning Python objects.

We implement the following conversions inside a `gen_to_python` function

* `t_INT` -> `int` or `long`
* `t_REAL` -> `float`
* `t_COMPLEX` -> `complex`
* `t_FRAC` -> [fraction](https://docs.python.org/2/library/fractions.html)
* `t_INFINITY` -> `float`
* `t_STR` -> `str`
* `t_VEC`, `t_COL` -> `list`
* `t_MAT` -> `list` of `list`s

For all other types, the function raises a `NotImplementedError`.
