This ticket adds three methods to graphs to compute three variations  of the Cheeger constant:

- the "transition isoperimetric number" (`cheeger_constant`)
- the edge isoperimetric number (`edge_isoperimetric_number`)
- the vertex isoperimetric number or magnifying constant (`vertex_isoperimetric_number`)

Note that the implemented Cheeger constant is also the **conductance** of the simple random walk on the graph.

- One-sentence descriptions will be used in the toc and they should really be just one sentence. It is kind of dull to have "Return the edge-isoperimetric number of a graph." when the name is `edge_isoperimetric_number()`, but there is no good alternative.

You could do the following to reduce overall computation time:

```
for k in range(1, self.order()//2):
    for s in Subsets(self.vertices(), k):
         ....
```
and of course start methods testing the trivial cases.

I strongly believe that the best way to go is a C backtracker implemented on sparse C graphs. It will be at least 100x faster. With the current code it is not even possible to make computation with graphs with 20 vertices.

Whole idea of *Algorithmically hard stuff* as a TOC headear is odd. To compare, posets have *Properties of the poset*, even when `height` is trivial, `width` is harder but polynomial and `dimension` is proven to not be in `P`.

So yes, please do that.

It might be something on your computer. It looks fine with the patchbot as well as on my computer. Did you do a `make doc-clean` before building the doc?

Works, thanks (took 2.5 hours, though...).

Some minor suggestions:
- In the cheeger constant docs, I'd replace `S(X)` with `Vol(X)` (it's a more common notation)
- I'd add "SEE ALSO" sections from each of the isoperimetric constants to the others.

Other than that, everything looks great. You may switch to positive review after you apply the suggestions, or if you decide not to apply them.

Hi, I apologize for yet another late response, but just wanted to ask: for graphs without edges (and at least 2 vertices) you set the Cheeger constant to be 1.

It is correct that the constant is not well defined for graphs without edges, but still I would maybe set it to be 0, to be consistent with the general idea that larger Cheeger constant means higher connectivity, and the specific idea that non-connected graphs have Cheeger constant 0.

In fact, if you agree with this then we may add a quick heuristic at the beginning of the method, which checks whether the graph is connected, and returns 0 otherwise.

* Why not cythonizing method `vertex_isoperimetric_number` ? 

* in file `index.rst`, I think that the first initial of a ref needs a `\`, like in `.. [ADKF1970] \V. Arlazarov`

* At the top of file `isoperimetric_inequalities.pyx`, you should add some words on the kind of methods that are in this file.

* in `graph.py`, method `vertex_isoperimetric_number`: `and the sum is taken over the subsets` -> `and the minimum is taken over the subsets`

* in method `cheeger_constant`, please add definition of `\partial X`
* similarly, in `edge_isoperimetric_number`, please define `\partial S`

For `vertex_isoperimetric_number`, it is not realistic to try to compute this value for large graphs. For up to 31 vertices, you can do in Cython:

```
from sage.graphs.graph_decompositions.fast_digraph cimport FastDigraph, compute_out_neighborhood_cardinality, popcount32
from sage.rings.integer cimport Integer

def vertex_isoperimetric_number_fast(self):
    """
    """
    cdef FastDigraph FG = FastDigraph(self)

    cdef int card, boundary, S
    cdef int mc = FG.n // 2
    cdef int p = FG.n
    cdef int q = 0
    
    for S in range(1, 2**FG.n):
        card = popcount32(S)
        if card <= mc:
            boundary = compute_out_neighborhood_cardinality(FG, S)
            if boundary * q < p * card:
                p = boundary
                q = card

    return Integer(p) / Integer(q)
```
it iterates over all the non-empty subsets of vertices. `popcount32(S)` counts the number of `1`'s and so of vertices in the current subset `S`, and `compute_out_neighborhood_cardinality` computes the number of vertices in `N(S)\S`.

```
sage: %time vertex_isoperimetric_number(G) # your method
CPU times: user 4.36 ms, sys: 1.76 ms, total: 6.13 ms
Wall time: 9.11 ms
3/2
sage: G = graphs.CompleteGraph(5)

2/15
```
We can certainly do something similar for the other methods. We just need a smart way to compute `|\partial X| / |Vol(X)|` and `|E(X)|` (which is not properly defined in the method) and `|\partial S| / |S|`.

It is of course possible to add a parameter `k` to compute the value only over all subsets of order `k` (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isoperimetric_inequality)

I'm not claiming that `FastDigraph` is perfect. It was useful for implementing vertex separation and cutwidth.

However, for such algorithms, the extra cost of using bitsets is not justified since we can hardly go above 32 nodes: huge computation time and memory usage.\\
Here, if you think it is possible to compute the `vertex_isoperimetric_number` on larger graphs, then you can use `binary_matrix`. Another idea could be to use `short_digraph` and the same structure as for other methods, and maintain the vertices in the boundary (e.g., use an array to store the number of edges from `S` to each vertex outside `S`, and increase/decrease `vol` each time a cell becomes non-zero/zero).

I did some tests using `static_dense_graph`, and so `binary_matrix`, for `cheeger_constant` and `edge_isoperimetric_number`. My code is slightly faster for dense graphs but slower for sparse graphs. Not so interesting here.

There are a small improvements you can do:
- to update `vol` in `cheeger_constant`: use an array to store the degree of vertices, and then, instead of doing `vol += 1` inside the for loop, do `vol += degree[u]` outside.
- add definition of `E(S)`. 
- have you tried maintaining the value `E(S)` ?
- you use a bitset to maintain the set of vertices in the subgraph. Wouldn't it be faster to use an array of `bint` ? You don't use bitset operations here, and memory usage is clearly not an issue.

An algorithm for iterating over connected subgraphs is described here https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15658245/efficiently-find-all-connected-induced-subgraphs. May be we can adapt it...

At least, it is possible to avoid the recursion and so to have a connected subgraph iterator. Not clear how to get an efficient implementation. I'll think about it.

To improve even more the computation of Cheeger constant, there should be an iterator over connected subgraph so that the complement is also connected! I can comment on this when your ticket is open.

Are you ok setting this ticket in positive review as it is? It will serve as a base for further improvements.

I have a much better implementation for `vertex_isoperimetric_number` using the ideas from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15658245/efficiently-find-all-connected-induced-subgraphs. You can use it on a multigraph with loops. No limit on the number of vertices, but of course the time complexity remains. 

Roughly, it uses a non-recursive version of the algorithm to generate all connected subgraphs of order at most `n/2`. I'm therefore using a binary matrix as a stack of bitsets.

@dcoudert: I would be happy to use the subgraph iterator from #25553 however
- it is only implemented for dense graphs
- the iterator carries many information that would be extremely useful for implementing isoperimetric constants (such as boundary)
- passing around lists of vertices (the output of the iterator) is a big waste

One possible way to proceed is to make a proper Cython class for the subgraph iterator so that we can grab information (at C level) at each step of the iteration.

What do you think?

It's reasonably fast this way :P But of course we could implement a sparse graph counter part.

We can certainly add such a class if it's needed. However, you have to be very careful if you want to access extra data. May be it's easier to copy/paste the code of the iterator, so that you can use the information you want safely at the time you need it.
The advantage of the class is to silently switch between sparse and dense representations.

- make a class for connected subgraphs iterator and use it to speed up / simplify some parts (#comment:59)
