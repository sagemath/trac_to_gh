This ticket adds three methods to graphs to compute three variations  of the Cheeger constant:

- the "transition isoperimetric number" (`cheeger_constant`)
- the edge isoperimetric number (`edge_isoperimetric_number`)
- the vertex isoperimetric number or magnifying constant (`vertex_isoperimetric_number`)

Note that the implemented Cheeger constant is also the **conductance** of the simple random walk on the graph.

You could do the following to reduce overall computation time:

Whole idea of //Algorithmically hard stuff// as a TOC headear is odd. To compare, posets have //Properties of the poset//, even when `height` is trivial, `width` is harder but polynomial and `dimension` is proven to not be in `P`.

So yes, please do that.

1) You should test the case with 1 vertex.

2) I fixed the backtracker in C. It is still available at `u/vdelecroix/cheeger`. It would be easy to adapt to the other constants.

Works, thanks (took 2.5 hours, though...).

Some minor suggestions:
- In the cheeger constant docs, I'd replace `S(X)` with `Vol(X)` (it's a more common notation)
- I'd add "SEE ALSO" sections from each of the isoperimetric constants to the others.

Other than that, everything looks great. You may switch to positive review after you apply the suggestions, or if you decide not to apply them.

Hi, I apologize for yet another late response, but just wanted to ask: for graphs without edges (and at least 2 vertices) you set the Cheeger constant to be 1.

It is correct that the constant is not well defined for graphs without edges, but still I would maybe set it to be 0, to be consistent with the general idea that larger Cheeger constant means higher connectivity, and the specific idea that non-connected graphs have Cheeger constant 0.

In fact, if you agree with this then we may add a quick heuristic at the beginning of the method, which checks whether the graph is connected, and returns 0 otherwise.

I also agree that you should test that the input graph is connected.

Some remarks:
* Why not cythonizing method `vertex_isoperimetric_number` ? 

* in file `index.rst`, I think that the first initial of a ref needs a `\`, like in `.. [ADKF1970] \V. Arlazarov`

* At the top of file `isoperimetric_inequalities.pyx`, you should add some words on the kind of methods that are in this file.

* in `graph.py`, method `vertex_isoperimetric_number`: `and the sum is taken over the subsets` -> `and the minimum is taken over the subsets`

* in method `cheeger_constant`, please add definition of `\partial X`
* similarly, in `edge_isoperimetric_number`, please define `\partial S`

For `vertex_isoperimetric_number`, it is not realistic to try to compute this value for large graphs. For up to 31 vertices, you can do in Cython:

```

from sage.rings.integer cimport Integer

def vertex_isoperimetric_number_fast(self):

    cdef int card, boundary, S
    cdef int mc = FG.n // 2
    cdef int p = FG.n

    for S in range(1, 2**FG.n):
        card = popcount32(S)

                q = card

    return Integer(p) / Integer(q)
```
it iterates over all the non-empty subsets of vertices. `popcount32(S)` counts the number of `1`'s and so of vertices in the current subset `S`, and `compute_out_neighborhood_cardinality` computes the number of vertices in `N(S)\S`.

We can certainly do something similar for the other methods. We just need a smart way to compute `|\partial X| / |Vol(X)|` and `|E(X)|` (which is not properly defined in the method) and `|\partial S| / |S|`.

It is of course possible to add a parameter `k` to compute the value only over all subsets of order `k` (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isoperimetric_inequality)

I'm not claiming that `FastDigraph` is perfect. It was useful for implementing vertex separation and cutwidth. It can certainly be cleaned/improved/etc. (e.g., using `__builtin_popcount` and `uint_fast32_t`). However, for such algorithms, the extra cost of using bitsets is not justified since we can hardly go above 32 nodes: huge computation time and memory usage.\\
Here, if you think it is possible to compute the `vertex_isoperimetric_number` on larger graphs, then you can use `binary_matrix`. Another idea could be to use `short_digraph` and the same structure as for other methods, and maintain the vertices in the boundary (e.g., use an array to store the number of edges from `S` to each vertex outside `S`, and increase/decrease `vol` each time a cell becomes non-zero/zero).

I did some tests using `static_dense_graph`, and so `binary_matrix`, for `cheeger_constant` and `edge_isoperimetric_number`. My code is slightly faster for dense graphs but slower for sparse graphs. Not so interesting here.

There are a small improvements you can do:
- to update `vol` in `cheeger_constant`: use an array to store the degree of vertices, and then, instead of doing `vol += 1` inside the for loop, do `vol += degree[u]` outside.
- add definition of `E(S)`. 
- have you tried maintaining the value `E(S)` ?
- you use a bitset to maintain the set of vertices in the subgraph. Wouldn't it be faster to use an array of `bint` ? You don't use bitset operations here, and memory usage is clearly not an issue.

> I have implemented an iterator over connected subgraphs in Cython. It is reasonably fast. I should open a ticket for it, but I don't know yet in which file to add it. Any suggestion ?


`connected_subgraphs_iterator.pyx`? Please, cc me.

> It can certainly help improving this ticket, although current implementations are quite good. 


To improve even more the computation of Cheeger constant, there should be an iterator over connected subgraph so that the complement is also connected! I can comment on this when your ticket is open.

Are you ok setting this ticket in positive review as it is? It will serve as a base for further improvements.

I have a much better implementation for `vertex_isoperimetric_number` using the ideas from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15658245/efficiently-find-all-connected-induced-subgraphs.

Roughly, it uses a non-recursive version of the algorithm to generate all connected subgraphs of order at most `n/2`. I'm therefore using a binary matrix as a stack of bitsets.

`@`dcoudert: I would be happy to use the subgraph iterator from #25553 however
- it is only implemented for dense graphs
- the iterator carries many information that would be extremely useful for implementing isoperimetric constants (such as boundary)
- passing around lists of vertices (the output of the iterator) is a big waste

One possible way to proceed is to make a proper Cython class for the subgraph iterator so that we can grab information (at C level) at each step of the iteration.

What do you think?

It's reasonably fast this way :P But of course we could implement a sparse graph counter part.

We can certainly add such a class if it's needed. However, you have to be very careful if you want to access extra data. May be it's easier to copy/paste the code of the iterator, so that you can use the information you want safely at the time you need it.
The advantage of the class is to silently switch between sparse and dense representations.

For me this patch is good to go as is and we can let possible improvements for future tickets like:
- algorithms for specific graph classes such as trees (#comment:28) or cliques
- make a class for connected subgraphs iterator and use it to speed up / simplify some parts (#comment:59)

I'm a bit lost in who should be in authors or reviewers or both...
