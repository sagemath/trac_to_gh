This ticket adds three methods to graphs to compute three variations  of the Cheeger constant:

- the "transition isoperimetric number" (`cheeger_constant`)
- the edge isoperimetric number (`edge_isoperimetric_number`)
- the vertex isoperimetric number or magnifying constant (`vertex_isoperimetric_number`)

Note that the implemented Cheeger constant is also the **conductance** of the simple random walk on the graph.

Whole idea of //Algorithmically hard stuff// as a TOC headear is odd. To compare, posets have //Properties of the poset//, even when `height` is trivial, `width` is harder but polynomial and `dimension` is proven to not be in `P`.

So yes, please do that.

<a id='comment:24'></a>Well, I guess that at least for trees the algorithm can be vastly improved.

<a id='comment:43'></a>Works, thanks (took 2.5 hours, though...).

Some minor suggestions:
- In the cheeger constant docs, I'd replace `S(X)` with `Vol(X)` (it's a more common notation)
- I'd add "SEE ALSO" sections from each of the isoperimetric constants to the others.

Other than that, everything looks great. You may switch to positive review after you apply the suggestions, or if you decide not to apply them.

<a id='comment:48'></a>Hi, I apologize for yet another late response, but just wanted to ask: for graphs without edges (and at least 2 vertices) you set the Cheeger constant to be 1.

It is correct that the constant is not well defined for graphs without edges, but still I would maybe set it to be 0, to be consistent with the general idea that larger Cheeger constant means higher connectivity, and the specific idea that non-connected graphs have Cheeger constant 0.

In fact, if you agree with this then we may add a quick heuristic at the beginning of the method, which checks whether the graph is connected, and returns 0 otherwise.

<a id='comment:52'></a>For `vertex_isoperimetric_number`, it is not realistic to try to compute this value for large graphs. For up to 31 vertices, you can do in Cython:

```
from sage.graphs.graph_decompositions.fast_digraph cimport FastDigraph, compute_out_neighborhood_cardinality, popcount32
from sage.rings.integer cimport Integer

def vertex_isoperimetric_number_fast(self):
    """
    """
    cdef FastDigraph FG = FastDigraph(self)

    cdef int card, boundary, S
    cdef int mc = FG.n // 2
    cdef int p = FG.n
    cdef int q = 0
    
    for S in range(1, 2**FG.n):
        card = popcount32(S)
        if card <= mc:
            boundary = compute_out_neighborhood_cardinality(FG, S)
            if boundary * q < p * card:
                p = boundary
                q = card

    return Integer(p) / Integer(q)
```
it iterates over all the non-empty subsets of vertices. `popcount32(S)` counts the number of `1`'s and so of vertices in the current subset `S`, and `compute_out_neighborhood_cardinality` computes the number of vertices in `N(S)\S`.

```

We can certainly do something similar for the other methods. We just need a smart way to compute `|\partial X| / |Vol(X)|` and `|E(X)|` (which is not properly defined in the method) and `|\partial S| / |S|`.

It is of course possible to add a parameter `k` to compute the value only over all subsets of order `k` (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isoperimetric_inequality)

To improve even more the computation of Cheeger constant, there should be an iterator over connected subgraph so that the complement is also connected! I can comment on this when your ticket is open.

Are you ok setting this ticket in positive review as it is? It will serve as a base for further improvements.

<a id='comment:79'></a>`@`dcoudert: I would be happy to use the subgraph iterator from #25553 however
- it is only implemented for dense graphs
- the iterator carries many information that would be extremely useful for implementing isoperimetric constants (such as boundary)
- passing around lists of vertices (the output of the iterator) is a big waste

One possible way to proceed is to make a proper Cython class for the subgraph iterator so that we can grab information (at C level) at each step of the iteration.

What do you think?

It's reasonably fast this way :P But of course we could implement a sparse graph counter part.

We can certainly add such a class if it's needed. However, you have to be very careful if you want to access extra data. May be it's easier to copy/paste the code of the iterator, so that you can use the information you want safely at the time you need it.
The advantage of the class is to silently switch between sparse and dense representations.
