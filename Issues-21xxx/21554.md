It turns out that not only can one declare integer, one can declare noninteger.  See [here](http://maxima.sourceforge.net/docs/manual/maxima_11.html#Item_003a-integer).  Let's add an example pointing this out, perhaps with the example from [this question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/39612476/declare-a-variable-as-not-an-integer-in-sage-maxima-solve/).

Yea, I can change that statement to a more clear one. Also, #21946 and this ticket are not dependent.

this ticket is closed. Any changes to the branches here will be ignored. (So it should go to another ticket, say #21946) But still, your branch did not and does not make sense. The purpose of this ticket is to document and provide a test for `noninteger` assumption. E.g. 

```
sage: var('K')
K
sage: assume(K, 'noninteger')
sage: solve([K^2==1],K)
[]
```
The doctring should say what this test doing: it is showing how to use this type of assumption, and not something about reals. (Yes, I agree that the link for an example in the ticket description is somewhat misleading, but, well...)

even better example:

[K == 1/2*I*sqrt(3) - 1/2, K == -1/2*I*sqrt(3) - 1/2]
