Currently one of few missing SRGs from A.E.Brouwer's database of SRGs is one with parameters (378,116,34,36), due to M.Muzychuk, construction S6 from "A generalization of Wallis-Fon-Der-Flaass construction of strongly regular graphs." J. Algebr. Comb. 25(2), 169–187 (2007).

Most of the work is already done by Rowan Schrecker, and mostly just needed to be merged, see https://github.com/rschrecker/MuzychukProject
(few easy bugs were fixed along the way, more examples/tests added, etc)

Hello,

clearly I don't understand your code, but I have simple remarks.

```
    for x in range(m):
        L_i[x] = [edge for edge in L.edges(labels=False) if x in edge]
```
should be 

```
    for x in range(m):
        L_i[x] = L.edges_incident(x, labels=False)
```

Then for this block

```
+    for C in ParClasses:
+        EC = matrix(QQ, v)
+        for i in range(v):
+            for j in range(v):
+                for line in C:
+                    if i in line and j in line:
+                        EC[i, j] = 1/k
```
Why not using this instead. I assume that `line` is a pair.

```
+    for C in ParClasses:
+        EC = matrix(QQ, v)
+        for line in C:
+            EC[i, j] = E[j, i] = 1/k
```

* `[i, j] = line` -> `i,j = line`

no, `line` is a hyperplane in the (d-1)-dimensional affine space over GF(n), and `C` is a class of
parallel hyperplanes.

OK, so you can at least do:

```
for C in ParClasses:
    EC = matrix(QQ, v)
    for i in range(v):
        for line in C:
            if not i in line:
                continue
            for j in range(i+1,v):
                if j in line:
                    EC[i, j] = EC[j, i] = 1/k
```

Some possible minor improvements:

1) test `assert d > 1, 'd must be at least 2'` first.

2) replace 

```
    L_i = [0]*m
    for x in range(m):
        L_i[x] = L.edges_incident(x, labels=False)
```
with `L_i = [L.edges_incident(x, labels=False) for x in range(m)]`

3) precompute `ones_v = ones/v`} and use `EC -= ones_v` to avoid computing `ones/v` for each parallel class. It is also reused later in the code

4) use 

```
for i,j in itertools.combinations(line, 2):
    EC[i,j] = EC[j,i] = 1/k
```

5) the block `elif Phi == 'fixed':` could be
`Phi = {(x,line):val for x in range(m) for val,line in enumerate(L_i[x])} `

6) `phi = {(x, line):ParClasses[Phi[(x, line)]] for x in range(m) for line in L_i[x]} `

7) `A_i = [((v-k)/v)*ones - k*F_i[x] for x in range(m)]` or may be `A_i = [(v-k)*ones_v - k*F_i[x] for x in range(m)]`

8) add seealso sections in methods `MuzychukS6Graph` and `is_muzychuk_S6`.

Also, you should add a space after each `#` to ease the readability.

Method `MuzychukS6Graph` is working correctly. You still have to improve its description. Something is missing with the last sentence `Let L be the complete graph...`.

I don't understand the proposed behavior of method `is_muzychuk_S6`. 

```
sage: is_muzychuk_S6(378, 116, 34, 36)
(<function MuzychukS6Graph at 0x19dce9cf8>, 3, 3)
sage: is_muzychuk_S6(378, 116, 34, 37)
```
With such a name, the method should return `True` or `False`, but it returns either the generator + parameters or nothing.
This is apparently the standard in `strongly_regular_db.pyx` but I don't understand this choice. Why not using an extra boolean parameter `certificate` to return either a boolean or a boolean plus the generator+parameters.

I'll have a look, sure.

these `is_...()` are internal functions, optimised for speed. If `is_...()` returns nothing it indicates failure.

They were not meant for outside use. Also note that returning a generator is almost as cheap as returning a boolean, so there is really little incentive in having an extra parameter.

none of the files in `src/sage/graphs/` is touched by #21454.
