1. Remove the `localvars` class which is never used (it is imported in `parent` but nothing is done with it). There is another `localvars` in `parent_gens`, that one is used.

2. Remove `_temporarily_change_names`: this was only used in the unused `localvars`.

3. Remove `injvar`, which has been deprecated a very long time ago (#4143).

4. Deprecate `has_base`, which is unused.
