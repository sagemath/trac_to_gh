```
Not all special functions have doctests for conversion to Sympy like this one:

```
sage: log_gamma(x)._sympy_()
loggamma(x)
```
Let's make sure they all have one and, if not working, use this ticket to document progress.

Another problem this ticket will address is fictitious/speculative conversions like those of `struve_H` to `struveh` (which does not yet exist in SymPy) which give misleading errors when tried.

Not covered:
* incomplete gamma (#21407)
* `piecewise` (#21412)

The SymPy side is missing some of our functions. The resp. metaticket is https://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues/11579
