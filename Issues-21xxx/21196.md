<a id='comment:10'></a>Here's my idea--it worked for me.  The idea is that there is an optional gnulib version appended to the libtool version (with a `+`).  If given, it will check out that tag from the gnulib repo before building (otherwise it defaults to the master branch, which worked for all but libtool 2.4.3 anyways).

I admit the syntax is a bit awkward and am open to other ideas.  I just didn't want to hard-code a special case *just* for this version (though that might be acceptable as well given that it ended up being the only one affected AFAICT).
