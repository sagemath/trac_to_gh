```
I'm adding three new methods to compute families of operators on some given cone:

* Positive operators (matrices that are positive with respect to the cone ordering on the space).

* Cross-positive operators (a bigger set than the positive operators, only "positive" on orthogonal pairs).

* Z-operators (negative cross-positive operators).

The last is obviously trivial once the second is in place.

<a id='comment:3'></a>I've just fixed the most egregious long-running tests -- I accidentally copy/pasted a call to `ZZ.random_integer()` with no bounds into a few doctests.

I've left all of the tests with `max_ambient_dim=3` for now, which seems to run quickly and predictably. I would prefer 4, but sometimes corner cases pop up, for example:

```
sage: K = Cone([ (-6, 0, -11,  0),
....:            (-2, 1, -64,  2),
....:            (-1, 2,  10,  1),
....:            ( 1, 1,   0, -1),
....:            ( 0, 0,   0, -1),
....:            (-6, 0,   0, -1) ])
sage: timeit("K.positive_operator_gens()")
5 loops, best of 3: 21.3 s per loop
```

I don't think there's any way to fix that (that example is even proper), so sticking with 3d is probably wise. I can add a few longer tests to my personal repo for the paper for good measure.

```
While it is in general good to have more tests, I think this goes over the board: the last statement includes all previous ones and assuming that randomness works makes running those tests a waste of time.

I didn't get into the math details of the subsequent ones, but if it is the same here, i.e. that some tests follow from other ones, I think they should be removed.

Keeping tests for corner cases like trivial cones/spaces, on the other hand, is probably good since they tend to be mathematically obvious but programmatically buggy.
