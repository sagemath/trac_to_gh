I'm adding three new methods to compute families of operators on some given cone:

* Positive operators (matrices that are positive with respect to the cone ordering on the space).

* Cross-positive operators (a bigger set than the positive operators, only "positive" on orthogonal pairs).

* Z-operators (negative cross-positive operators).

The last is obviously trivial once the second is in place.

I've just fixed the most egregious long-running tests -- I accidentally copy/pasted a call to `ZZ.random_integer()` with no bounds into a few doctests.

I've left all of the tests with `max_ambient_dim=3` for now, which seems to run quickly and predictably. I would prefer 4, but sometimes corner cases pop up, for example:

```
sage: K = Cone([ (-6, 0, -11,  0),
....:            (-2, 1, -64,  2),
....:            (-1, 2,  10,  1),
....:            ( 1, 1,   0, -1),
....:            ( 0, 0,   0, -1),
....:            (-6, 0,   0, -1) ])
sage: timeit("K.positive_operator_gens()")
5 loops, best of 3: 21.3 s per loop
```

I don't think there's any way to fix that (that example is even proper), so sticking with 3d is probably wise. I can add a few longer tests to my personal repo for the paper for good measure.

+I'm adding three new methods to compute families of operators on some given cone:
 
 * Positive operators (matrices that are positive with respect to the cone ordering on the space).
 
@@ -7,5 +7,3 @@
 * Z-operators (negative cross-positive operators).
 
 The last is obviously trivial once the second is in place.
-
-Most of the properties that I'm testing haven't been published yet, but the algorithms themselves should be OK. The papers containing those algorithms are still in progress, but only the nonpolyhedral case requires any work. When the cones are polyhedral (and thus closed), you can verify the algorithms in a few lines.

This is a bit non-committal:

```
+        OUTPUT:
+
+        A list of `m`-by-`n` matrices where `m` is the ambient
+        dimension of ``K2`` and `n` is the ambient dimension of this

```
Why "should have"? Is it not guaranteed to be the case? The fact that their combination has the same property only reflect the fact that such elements form a cone, yet it does not imply that returned elements generate that cone. Returning just a zero matrix or even an empty list would fit this description ;-)

+
+        Each positive operator should send the generators of one cone
+        into the other cone::
...
+        Each positive operator should send a random element of one cone
+        into the other cone::

+        cone into the other cone::
...
+        A random positive operator should send a random element of one

```
While it is in general good to have more tests, I think this goes over the board: the last statement includes all previous ones and assuming that randomness works makes running those tests a waste of time.

I didn't get into the math details of the subsequent ones, but if it is the same here, i.e. that some tests follow from other ones, I think they should be removed.

Keeping tests for corner cases like trivial cones/spaces, on the other hand, is probably good since they tend to be mathematically obvious but programmatically buggy.
