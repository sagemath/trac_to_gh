We define some graph. It is the both sided Cayley graph of the monoid generated by two partial maps (defined in Chapter 5 Green’s relations and local theory of the book by Jean Éric Pin):

```python
sage: S = FiniteSetMaps(5)
sage: I = S((0,1,2,3,4))
sage: a = S((0,1,3,0,0))
sage: b = S((0,2,4,1,0))
sage: roots = [I]
sage: succ = lambda v:[v*a,v*b,a*v,b*v]
sage: R = RecursivelyEnumeratedSet(roots, succ)
sage: G = R.to_digraph()
sage: G
Looped multi-digraph on 27 vertices
```

We view the graph:

```python
sage: G.latex_options().set_options(prog='dot',format='dot2tex')
sage: view(G, tightpage=True)
```

We view it using dot language subgraphs clusters (here the strongly connected components) and also using optional package dot2tex:

```python
sage: G.latex_options().set_options(prog='dot',format='dot2tex')
sage: C = G.strongly_connected_components()
sage: G.latex_options().set_options(subgraph_clusters=C)
sage: view(G, tightpage=True)
```

The patch is working well, except when we set `edge_labels=True`. Is such case, the vertices are effectively grouped by clusters, but the boxes around the clusters are not drawn.

```
sage: G = digraphs.Kautz(3, 2)
sage: C = [[u for u in G.vertices() if int(u[0])==l] for l in range(4)]
sage: G.latex_options().set_options(prog='dot',format='dot2tex', subgraph_clusters=C)
sage: view(G, tightpage=True)

Indeed, but `graphviz` seems to create the boxes correctly:

```
sage: G = digraphs.Kautz(3, 2)
sage: C = [[u for u in G.vertices() if int(u[0])==l] for l in range(4)]
sage: with open('file.dot', 'w') as f:
....:     f.write(G.graphviz_string(edge_labels=True, subgraph_clusters=C, color_by_label=True))
....: 
sage: !dot file.dot -Tpdf -ofile.pdf
sage: !open file.pdf
```

so maybe it is a problem in `dot2tex`. I will see if I can find a workaround...

I was able to construct a small example showing the bug:

```python
edges = [(i,(i+1)%3,a) for i,a in enumerate('abc')]
G_no_labels = DiGraph(edges)
G_with_labels = DiGraph(edges)
C = [[0,1], [2]]
kwds = dict(subgraph_clusters=C,color_by_label=True,prog='dot',format='dot2tex')
G_no_labels.latex_options().set_options(edge_labels=False, **kwds)
G_with_labels.latex_options().set_options(edge_labels=True, **kwds)
```

With no labels, each cluster is constructed within a scope including a `\filldraw` line:

```
sage: latex(G_no_labels)
\begin{tikzpicture}[>=latex,line join=bevel,]
%%
\begin{scope}
  \pgfsetstrokecolor{black}
  \definecolor{strokecol}{rgb}{0.0,0.0,0.0};
  \pgfsetstrokecolor{strokecol}
  \definecolor{fillcol}{rgb}{0.94,1.0,1.0};
  \pgfsetfillcolor{fillcol}
  \filldraw (8.0bp,57.0bp) -- (8.0bp,135.0bp) -- (36.0bp,135.0bp) -- (36.0bp,57.0bp) -- cycle;
\end{scope}
\begin{scope}
  \pgfsetstrokecolor{black}
  \definecolor{strokecol}{rgb}{0.0,0.0,0.0};
  \pgfsetstrokecolor{strokecol}
  \definecolor{fillcol}{rgb}{0.94,1.0,1.0};
  \pgfsetfillcolor{fillcol}
  \filldraw (17.0bp,8.0bp) -- (17.0bp,37.0bp) -- (45.0bp,37.0bp) -- (45.0bp,8.0bp) -- cycle;
\end{scope}
...
\end{tikzpicture}
```

With labels, some `\filldraw` line is missing in one of the scope:

```
sage: latex(G_with_labels)
\begin{tikzpicture}[>=latex,line join=bevel,]
%%
\begin{scope}
  \pgfsetstrokecolor{black}
  \definecolor{strokecol}{rgb}{0.0,0.0,0.0};
  \pgfsetstrokecolor{strokecol}
  \definecolor{fillcol}{rgb}{0.94,1.0,1.0};
  \pgfsetfillcolor{fillcol}
\end{scope}
\begin{scope}
  \pgfsetstrokecolor{black}
  \definecolor{strokecol}{rgb}{0.0,0.0,0.0};
  \pgfsetstrokecolor{strokecol}
  \definecolor{fillcol}{rgb}{0.94,1.0,1.0};
  \pgfsetfillcolor{fillcol}
  \filldraw (25.0bp,8.0bp) -- (25.0bp,37.0bp) -- (53.0bp,37.0bp) -- (53.0bp,8.0bp) -- cycle;

Not yet. My first hypothesis was: it works when the size of the cluster is one. But it turns out to be false when I constructed another example where bigger cluster were drawn. Next thing I want to do is check dot2tex code to see why `\filldraw` is missing.

The only place where `\filldraw` appears in `dot2tex.py` file is inside the method `draw_polygon`. The only place where `draw_polygon` is called is in method `do_draw_op` which does something like:

```
            if op in ['e', 'E']:

            elif op in ['p', 'P']:

            elif op in ['C', 'c']:
                s += self.set_color(drawop)
            elif op == 'S':
                s += self.set_style(drawop)
            elif op in ['B']:
                s += self.draw_bezier(drawop, style)
            elif op in ['T']:
                ...
                many lines
                ...
                s += self.draw_text(drawop, lblstyle)
