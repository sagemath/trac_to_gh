Currently, SageMath hardcodes the metaclasses DynamicMetaclass, DynamicClasscallMetaclass, DynamicInheritComparisonMetaclass, DynamicInheritComparisonClasscallMetaclass, NestedClassMetaclass, InheritComparisonMetaclass, and InheritComparisonClasscallMetaclass. 

Apparently, they are all based on few single-purpose metaclasses (DynamicMetaclass, InheritComparisonMetaclass, NestedClassMetaclass and ClasscallMetaclass), and the hardcoded combinations exist because Python doesn't allow much freedom when providing different metaclasses in the bases of a class definition. And apparently several combinations are missing.

The purpose of this ticket is to allow for an automatic creation of combined metaclasses, so that only the single-purpose metaclasses need to be implemented, and all other metaclasses will be created dynamically.

The approach is by introducing a meta-metaclass SageMetaclass --- i.e., any metaclass in Sage is *instance* of SageMetaclass.

As explained on the `sage-devel` post, I am curious to see if you can make this work on Python 3.

Yes.

I am confident that it would work on Python 3, of course with the modified syntax

```
class Foo(metaclass=Bar):
    ...
```
instead of

```
class Foo:
   __metaclass__ = Bar
```

The idea is: "metaclass used in Sage" should be synonymous to "instance (not sub-class!) of SageMetaclass" (hence, SageMetaclass is a metametaclass and is itself a subclass of type).

SageMetaclass defines a `__call__` method for its instances (thus overriding `type.__call__`). When such instance is used as a metaclass when defining a class, then the metaclass' `__call__` method inspects the bases of the to-be-created class and dynamically creates (if necessary) a common sub-class of the metaclasses of the bases. Eventually, the class is created as an instance of the common (dynamic) metaclass. And python will be happy, because the metaclass of the new class is a sub-class of the metaclasses of the given bases.

Both in Python 2 and in Python 3, the metaclass is called during creation of a class (which is where all magic happens). That's why I think it should work on Python 3 as well.

I have pushed a proof of concept. The following works:

```
sage: from sage.structure.metaclass.metaclass import MyNestedClass, MyUniqueRepresentation
sage: class MyCombinedExample(MyNestedClass, MyUniqueRepresentation):
....:     pass
....: 
sage: C = MyCombinedExample(4,5)
sage: C is MyCombinedExample(4,5)
True
sage: C is MyCombinedExample(5,5)
False
sage: C.Test() is C.Test()
True
sage: loads(dumps(C)) is C
True
```

The metaclasses of the base classes MyNestedClass and MyUniqueRepresentation in the above class definition are incompatible:

```
sage: type(MyUniqueRepresentation).__mro__
(<class 'sage.structure.metaclass.metaclass.ClasscallMetaclass'>,
 <type 'type'>,
 <type 'object'>)
sage: type(MyNestedClass).__mro__
(<class 'sage.structure.metaclass.metaclass.NestedClassMetaclass'>,
 <type 'type'>,
 <type 'object'>)
```
Nonetheless, it just works. In fact, the resulting class is instance of a metaclass that is created on the fly:

```
sage: type(C)
<class '__main__.MyCombinedExample'>
sage: type(type(C))
<class '__main__.ClasscallNestedClassMetaclass'>
sage: type(type(type(C)))
<class 'sage.structure.metaclass.metaclass.DynamicSageMetaclass'>
```

Slightly strange for me is this: The metaclass that actually appears in the definition of `ClasscallMetaclass` and `NestedClassMetaclass` is not the class `SageMetaclass` but the function `sage_metaclass` --- from the patch:

```
from sage.misc.nested_class import nested_pickle
class NestedClassMetaclass:
    __metaclass__ = sage_metaclass
    def __init__(cls, name, bases, namespace):
        nested_pickle(cls)
```

If I replace `sage_metaclass` by `SageMetaclass` then the example stops working, which is something I don't fully understand. Unless Python 3 disallows to use a function as `__metaclass__`, there is hope that it would work with Python 3 as well.

Sure, so far it is just a proof of concept.

Would you agree with `MetaMetaclass` and (for the function that actually appears in the metaclass definitions) `meta_metaclass`? Or maybe just `Metaclass` and `metaclass`.

There are two things in the code: `SageMetaclass`, which is for hard-coded (single purpose, atomic) metaclasses, and `DynamicSageMetaclass` for those that are dynamically created.

What about the following scheme:

- `BaseMetaclass` (instead of `SageMetaclass`): Its instances are metaclasses that are basic in the sense that one can combine them.
- `DynamicMetaclass` or `CombinedMetaclass` (instead of `DynamicSageMetaclass`): Its instances are metaclasses that are dynamically/automatically created from a combination of base metaclasses.
- `auto_metaclass`: The function that I currently call `sage_metaclass`. It returns an instance of `BaseMetaclass` or `CombinedMetaclass`, depending on the context.
- The base metaclasses should be named `<Feature>ClassMetaclass`, which corresponds to the existing naming scheme in Sage and means that an instance of `<Feature>ClassMetaclass` is a class that provides a single feature (such as: It has a classcall, or it allows nesting).
- The combined metaclasses should be named `<Feature1><Feature2>...<Feature_n>ClassMetaclass` (which in the current proof of concept is slightly different). So, it would be `ClasscallDynamicNestedClassMetaclass` for a metaclass whose instances are dynamic classes that have a classcall and allow nesting.

I think `auto_metaclass` would be a good name for the function that appears in the metaclass definition, i.e.

```
class NestedClassMetaclass:
    __metaclass__ = auto_metaclass
    def __init__(cls, name, bases, namespace):
        nested_pickle(cls)
```

Just a minor comment: you don't need the `abc` module for that (especially if it's giving you problems). You could just define `__instancecheck__` and/or `__subclasscheck__` directly.

Right, it uses [PyType_IsSubtype](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/type.html#c.PyType_IsSubtype) which doesn't use `__subclasscheck__`.

It checks only the MRO. Basically, it implements `issubclass(x, y)` as `y in x.__mro__`.

Ouch. That's efficient, but bad for my purpose.

I just came up with a totally different approach.

In a nutshell: There should only be a single metaclass (hence, there will be no metaclass conflict), but there are also several functions affecting the class creation, and the metaclass will choose which of the functions are to be applied, based on attributes of the class and its bases.


More elaborated:

One could have just a single meta*class*, say, `class UniversalMetaclass(type)`, and a couple of *functions*, say, `nested_class_metaclass` and `classcall_metaclass`. These functions would return instances of `UniversalMetaclass`. So, roughly one would have

```
class SomeNestedClass(metaclass=nested_class_metaclass):
    ...

class UniqueRepresentation(metaclass=classcall_metaclass):
    ...
sage: type(SomeNestedClass) == type(UniqueRepresentation) == UniversalMetaclass
True
```

Now, when one does

```
class CombinedClass(UniqueRepresentation, SomeNestedClass):
    ...
```
then first of all Python 3 would not complain, since the metaclasses of both bases are identical. What we want is that the features used in the creation of `UniqueRepresentation` (namely addition of a classcall method)  and of `NestedClass` (namely invocation of `nested_pickle` upon creation of the class) are combined.

So, the question is: Given `UniqueRepresentation` and `SomeNestedClass`, how can we access the functions `classcall_metaclass` and `nested_class_metaclass`? In Python 2, this would be `UniqueRepresentation.__metaclass__`, but that's gone in Python 3.

But why couldn't we simply have our own attribute, say, `cls.__features__`, returning a tuple (or frozen set) of functions that were invoked during creation of the class `cls`?

In the creation of `CombinedClass`, Python 3 would conclude that `UniversalMetaclass` is responsible for the class creation (as it is the common metaclass of the bases).

We could make it so that `UniversalMetaclass` applies each function in `X.__features__` during creation of `CombinedClass`, for each base class `X` of `CombinedClass`, but of course without repetitions. And finally, it would store the tuple of functions in `CombinedClass.__features__`.

I will try this.

I did some research on the differences of Python 2 and Python 3 regarding metaclasses. In Python 2, the metaclass seems to come into play quite late in the class creation. But in Python 3, the first step is to determine the metaclass (which means that incompatible metaclasses of the bases result in an immediate error). Then, `metaclass.__prepare__` is called to initialise the namespace of the to-be-created class. Then, the body of the class definition is executed, followed by calling the metaclass to actually create the class. And eventually, class decorators are called.

So, we have in Python 3:

```
>>> def c_decorator(cls):
...     print("decorating the class")
...     return cls
... 
>>> class Meta(type):
...     @classmethod
...     def __prepare__(mcls, name, bases):
...         print("preparing the namespace")
...         return dict()
...     def __new__(cls, name, bases, namespace):
...         print("new class")
...         return type(name, bases, namespace)
... 
>>> @c_decorator
... class C(metaclass=Meta):
...     pass
... 
preparing the namespace
new class
decorating the class
```
Both `__prepare__` and class decorators are new in Python 3. Perhaps they can be used?

Again, it would be needed to have a `UniversalMetaclass`, since there must be no conflicts with the metaclasses of the bases. Then, `UniversalMetaclass.__prepare__` can add some information to the class' namespace, taking into account the bases. Based on this information, `UniversalMetaclass.__new__` can do special things during the class creation.

Class decorators seem less relevant to me. They are called after creation of the class, but they wouldn't be called again when sub-classing. So, that post-production should better be done inside of `UniversalMetaclass.__new__`.
