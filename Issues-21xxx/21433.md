I think that this is a bug:

```
    sage: K = GF(5^2); K
    Finite Field in z2 of size 5^2
    sage: L = GF(5^4); L
    Finite Field in z4 of size 5^4
    sage: from sage.categories.pushout import pushout
    sage: P = pushout(K,L); P
    Finite Field in z4 of size 5^4
    sage: P is L
    False
```

I had a closer look at this issue. Here is what happens: the function `pushout` recreates the finite field with the extra attribute `structure=None` which becomes part of the key used in `UniqueFactory`. Actually the key is built from all attributes including those that are not used or have no meaning. E.g.:

```

I would gladly remove the component `str(kwds)` from the key (see `sage.rings.finite_rings.finite_field_constructor:549`). Any comment?

My proposal was too coarse and broke many doctests.

My new weaker suggestion is to remove from the key only the named attributes whose value is None (cf patch implemented in the current branch).

Ticket set to needs_review.

Isn't using `str(...)` in a key a questionable idea anyway? Is this just a hack to work around the fact that a `dict` is not hashable?

Dropping the `None`s is just assuming that these are the default values, right? Wouldn't it be better to add the default values explicitly to the key?

As far as I understand, the point is that we don't know - or more exactly we don't want to precise at this point - what kind of attributes can arise and thus a fortiori we don't know their default values.

For example, the Givaro library accepts an attribute `repr` (for specifying the internal representation of the elements of the finite field). Of course, two Givaro finite fields with different `repr` option cannot be equal, so that `repr` should definitely be a part of the key.

Another option would be to make the list of all possible attributes and only include them in the key.

Sorry for holding up this simple fix. I know this is frustrating. I'll try to be more responsive.

What do you think about just removing the attributes that we know to cause trouble here?

<div id="comment:22" align="right">Comment 22</div>

The last commit now means we do not had oddities like:

```
sage: GF(25, impl='givaro') is GF(25, impl='givaro', repr='poly')
False
```
It also means we no longer accept junk keywords that makes different keys (i.e., this now raises a `TypeError`):

```
sage: GF(25) is GF(25, foo='bar')
False
```
I was tempted to have `elem_cache` and `repr` raise an error when the implementation is not givaro, but because `elem_cache` was listed as an argument, I decided to just ignore it for backwards compatibility.

IMO, what we really should be using is `UniqueRepresentation` and letting subclasses handle this through their `__classcall__` and `__classcall_private__`. However, that is a much more invasive change and this is on the path towards that.

Travis, please feel free to set this to positive review once the doctests pass.

Volker, I was not aware of that. I thought that passing doctests were a prerequisite for merging things. Not for positively reviewing things; in particular since there were hardly any patchbots left until a few days ago (when we started a couple of additional ones.) Sure the manual says that all tests should pass but it also tells me to build the reference manual which I can't because I have not enough RAM for that. In any case, I will be more careful with that in the future but I found "wtf" to be a slightly too strong remark here.
