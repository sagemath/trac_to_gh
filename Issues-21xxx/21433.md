I think that this is a bug:

```
    sage: K = GF(5^2); K
    Finite Field in z2 of size 5^2
    sage: L = GF(5^4); L
    Finite Field in z4 of size 5^4
    sage: from sage.categories.pushout import pushout
    sage: P = pushout(K,L); P
    Finite Field in z4 of size 5^4
    sage: P is L
    False
```

My proposal was too coarse and broke many doctests.

My new weaker suggestion is to remove from the key only the named attributes whose value is None (cf patch implemented in the current branch).

Ticket set to needs_review.

Replying to [saraedum](#comment%3A7):
> Dropping the `None`s is just assuming that these are the default values, right? Wouldn't it be better to add the default values explicitly to the key?


As far as I understand, the point is that we don't know - or more exactly we don't want to precise at this point - what kind of attributes can arise and thus a fortiori we don't know their default values.

For example, the Givaro library accepts an attribute `repr` (for specifying the internal representation of the elements of the finite field). Of course, two Givaro finite fields with different `repr` option cannot be equal, so that `repr` should definitely be a part of the key.

Another option would be to make the list of all possible attributes and only include them in the key.

Sorry for holding up this simple fix. I know this is frustrating. I'll try to be more responsive.

What do you think about just removing the attributes that we know to cause trouble here?

The last commit now means we do not had oddities like:

```
sage: GF(25, impl='givaro') is GF(25, impl='givaro', repr='poly')
False
```
It also means we no longer accept junk keywords that makes different keys (i.e., this now raises a `TypeError`):

```
sage: GF(25) is GF(25, foo='bar')
False
```
I was tempted to have `elem_cache` and `repr` raise an error when the implementation is not givaro, but because `elem_cache` was listed as an argument, I decided to just ignore it for backwards compatibility.

IMO, what we really should be using is `UniqueRepresentation` and letting subclasses handle this through their `__classcall__` and `__classcall_private__`. However, that is a much more invasive change and this is on the path towards that.
