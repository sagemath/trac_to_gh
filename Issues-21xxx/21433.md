I think that this is a bug:

```
    sage: K = GF(5^2); K
    Finite Field in z2 of size 5^2
    sage: L = GF(5^4); L
    Finite Field in z4 of size 5^4
    sage: from sage.categories.pushout import pushout
    sage: P = pushout(K,L); P
    Finite Field in z4 of size 5^4
    sage: P is L
    False
```

    "body": "<a id='comment:1'></a>I had a closer look at this issue. Here is what happens: the function `pushout` recreates the finite field with the extra attribute `structure=None` which becomes part of the key used in `UniqueFactory`. Actually the key is built from all attributes including those that are not used or have no meaning. E.g.:\n\n```\n    sage: K = GF(5^2)\n    sage: L = GF(5^2, irrelevant_attribute='Hello')\n    sage: K is L\n    False\n```\n\nI would gladly remove the component `str(kwds)` from the key (see `sage.rings.finite_rings.finite_field_constructor:549`).

As far as I understand, the point is that we don't know - or more exactly we don't want to precise at this point - what kind of attributes can arise and thus a fortiori we don't know their default values.

For example, the Givaro library accepts an attribute `repr` (for specifying the internal representation of the elements of the finite field). Of course, two Givaro finite fields with different `repr` option cannot be equal, so that `repr` should definitely be a part of the key.

Another option would be to make the list of all possible attributes and only include them in the key.

<a id='comment:22'></a>The last commit now means we do not had oddities like:

```
sage: GF(25, impl='givaro') is GF(25, impl='givaro', repr='poly')
False
```
It also means we no longer accept junk keywords that makes different keys (i.e., this now raises a `TypeError`):

```
sage: GF(25) is GF(25, foo='bar')
False
```
I was tempted to have `elem_cache` and `repr` raise an error when the implementation is not givaro, but because `elem_cache` was listed as an argument, I decided to just ignore it for backwards compatibility.

IMO, what we really should be using is `UniqueRepresentation` and letting subclasses handle this through their `__classcall__` and `__classcall_private__`. However, that is a much more invasive change and this is on the path towards that.
