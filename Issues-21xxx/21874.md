But handling the locale/filesystem encoding seems best left to Python. What if `datastring` is `bytes`, `string` is python's utf-8, and the user's locale is ISO-8859? What is safest among `open(datastring.decode() + string)` and `open(datastring + string.encode())`? Probably neither.

If `string` is ASCII, then `string.encode()` should be pretty safe since most encodings map ASCII to ASCII bytes.

Same goes for `datastring.decode()`, then. I was obviously thinking of the case where they contain non-ASCII characters.
