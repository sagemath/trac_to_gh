See https://docs.python.org/3/howto/unicode.html#unicode-filenames

Note the sentence "When opening a file for reading or writing, you can usually just provide the Unicode string as the filename, and it will be automatically converted to the right encoding for you". This means that Python does a conversion of encoding, so it makes sense to use `bytes` for filenames to avoid conversions.

Same goes for `datastring.decode()`, then. I was obviously thinking of the case where they contain non-ASCII characters.
