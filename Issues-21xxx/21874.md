`listdir` outputs `str` when given `str` and `bytes` when given `bytes`:

```
>>> import os
>>> type(os.listdir(b'.')[0])
<class 'bytes'>
```

```
>>> import os
>>> type(os.listdir('.')[0])
<class 'str'>

See https://docs.python.org/3/howto/unicode.html#unicode-filenames

Note the sentence "When opening a file for reading or writing, you can usually just provide the Unicode string as the filename, and it will be automatically converted to the right encoding for you". This means that Python does a conversion of encoding, so it makes sense to use `bytes` for filenames to avoid conversions.

If `string` is ASCII, then `string.encode()` should be pretty safe since most encodings map ASCII to ASCII bytes.

Same goes for `datastring.decode()`, then. I was obviously thinking of the case where they contain non-ASCII characters.

I see one on line 83 of `parser.py`, and there `string` is `pari.desc`, so I agree with you (assuming that gp correctly handles locale encodings). Any other places?",
