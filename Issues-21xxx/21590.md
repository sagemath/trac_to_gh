+This ticket is meant to implement a new class of objects: ribbon graphs. These are graphs together with a cyclic ordering of the half edges adjacent to each vertex. This data allows us to unambiguosly "thicken" the  ribbon graph to an orientable surface with boundary.
 
+This will be done by encoding the ribbon graphs in two permutations. As done for example in [Gir] (and many other places). This is also meant to include basic methods of the class to compute:
+  
+* Genus of the thicekning
+* Number of boundary components
+* Labeling of the boundary components (see also [Gir])
+* A basis of the homology of the graph (and so of the thickening)
+    -This base satisfies the condition that each element of the basis is an embedded circle in the graph and contains one (and only one) edge that is not in any other element of the basis.
+
+This is implementation is useful in itself but is also meant to serve as a base for a later implementation of something called "tete-a-tete" graphs which is an original idea by the mathematician Norbert A'Campo [Nor] and has been developed in my thesis. These other graphs model periodic automorphisms of the thickening of the graph.
