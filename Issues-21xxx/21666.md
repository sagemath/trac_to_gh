This is kind of first part of #17147.

This will 1) make `Posets.DivisorLattice(n)` faster; for example for `n=123456789098765432100` it took 0,87 seconds without this, 0,17 seconds after this, and 2) make the linear extension to always be ascending numbers; try for example `Posets.DivisorLattice(12).meet_irreducibles()`.

If this breaks nothing I will continue with other poset examples.
