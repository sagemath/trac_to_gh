This patch adds a function to check if a lattice is semidistributive, i.e. both meet- and join-semidistributive.

It is not explicitly said in any paper that a join- (or meet-)semidistributive lattice with equal number of meet- and join-irreducible elements is (fully) semidistributive. However, J.B. Nation forwarded a proof by Kira Adaricheva to me. It uses the fact that a meet-semidistributive lattice has a kappa function for every join-irreducible (dually, a dual kappa for meet-semidistributive lattices). An element that is minimal among those below a meet-irreducible but not below the upper cover of meet-irreducible is join-irreducible. Following that we can deduce that kappa and dual-kappa are in 1-to-1 relationship, and so the lattice is (fully) semidistributive.

<a id='comment:3'></a>Kevin, can you review this?

The paper http://www.math.hawaii.edu/~jb/unbound.ps says "If L also satisfies `SD_\vee`, then `\kappa` is one-to-one - -", hence the part "A semidistributive lattice must have equal number of meet- and join-irreducibles." at the code. Otherwise this should be trivial.
