I was occasionally getting failures in this test.  It seems that what was happening is:

```
singular('i')
```

would be called, even after a failed

```
singular._sendstr('int i = 5;')
```

Not clear if the command send with `_sendstr` actually failed, or just didn't finish sending/evaluating before the call to `singular('i')`.  But forcing a `singular._synchronize()` before the test seems to make sense.  I haven't been able to reproduce the failure since adding this, though I wasn't getting it reliably in the first place.

Keywords: expect cygwin singular
