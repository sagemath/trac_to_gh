Example (with bliss installed):

```python
sage: G = Graph(':C_kQ')
sage: G.automorphism_group(algorithm='bliss').order()
8
sage: G.automorphism_group(algorithm='sage').order()
4
```

This ticket changes the default behaviour so the `'sage'` algorithm is used by default when dealing with multiedges, and an error is raised if `'bliss'` is given explicitly. Similar situation for `canonical_label`.
