Travis or FrÃ©dÃ©ric, I want an opinion.

Currenlty finite lattices have `is_modular` with two different uses: it can check if a lattice is modular, or if all elements in a given subset are modular. Then there is `is_modular_element` that checks only one element.

This feels somewhat unnatural. Compare to `is_compelemted` vs. `complements`; but then `complements` can give dictionary for complements of every element, whereas `pseudocomplement` does not. And there is no function to check if given subset has a complement or pseudocomplement.

An element of a lattice can be tuple, and tuple can also be an argument to `is_modular`.

So what should we do for this? I can of course just add `certificate` to `is_modular` such that it raises an exception when used in combination with current `L`-parameter. But what you think?

It would be easy to extend `complements` to have this functionality. However, `P.is_modular(elts)` is really just (slightly faster) shorthand for `all(P.is_modular_element(x) for x in elts)`, and since that is not doing anything complicated code-wise, I would not remove this feature.

I don't see any problem. You should pass in a list/tuple with the element to `is_modular` in that case. In particular, `is_modular` is assuming the input is a list of elements, not a single element.

This is not a sentence:

```
        some subset of elements are all modular. An element `x` in a
        lattice `L` is *modular* if `x \leq b` implies
        for every `a, b \in L`.
```
Replace `\not=` with `\neq`. I also disagree with raising an error here:

```
        if certificate and L is not None:
            raise ValueError("parameters L and certificate can not be combined")
```
There still is a meaningful certificate, it is now just a pair of entries that do not satisfy:

```
H._rank[a] + H._rank[b] == H._rank[H._meet[a, b]] + H._rank[H._join[a, b]]
```
There is a small problem because the definition given did not match what the code is actually checking. Yet, it still should be possible to make everything consistent.
I also disagree with putting the condition inline instead of in an equation environment.

True. Then this is a defect.

Only if the poset is ranked. But yes, I think I can make a certificate.

As you wish. But for example `is_join_semidistributive()` then looks a little different.

Good point about the rankedness, but we should be try to be consistent with our certificate.

Thank you.

However, looking at the previous documentation, I like the flow better (1 element modular and then the definition for the entire poset). You can also use `\neq` instead of `\not=`.

Another possible optimization, which would mean more work, would be to push the actual comparison tests to `HasseDiagram` and just convert back the elements in the certificate. However, we don't have to do this on this ticket.
