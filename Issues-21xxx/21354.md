Travis or FrÃ©dÃ©ric, I want an opinion.

Currenlty finite lattices have `is_modular` with two different uses: it can check if a lattice is modular, or if all elements in a given subset are modular. Then there is `is_modular_element` that checks only one element.

This feels somewhat unnatural. Compare to `is_compelemted` vs. `complements`; but then `complements` can give dictionary for complements of every element, whereas `pseudocomplement` does not. And there is no function to check if given subset has a complement or pseudocomplement.

An element of a lattice can be tuple, and tuple can also be an argument to `is_modular`.

So what should we do for this? I can of course just add `certificate` to `is_modular` such that it raises an exception when used in combination with current `L`-parameter. But what you think?

It would be easy to extend `complements` to have this functionality. However, `P.is_modular(elts)` is really just (slightly faster) shorthand for `all(P.is_modular_element(x) for x in elts)`, and since that is not doing anything complicated code-wise, I would not remove this feature.

I don't see any problem. You should pass in a list/tuple with the element to `is_modular` in that case. In particular, `is_modular` is assuming the input is a list of elements, not a single element.

This is not a sentence:

```
        some subset of elements are all modular. An element `x` in a
        lattice `L` is *modular* if `x \leq b` implies
        for every `a, b \in L`.
```
Replace `\not=` with `\neq`. I also disagree with raising an error here:

```
        if certificate and L is not None:
            raise ValueError("parameters L and certificate can not be combined")
```
There still is a meaningful certificate, it is now just a pair of entries that do not satisfy:

```
H._rank[a] + H._rank[b] == H._rank[H._meet[a, b]] + H._rank[H._join[a, b]]
```
There is a small problem because the definition given did not match what the code is actually checking. Yet, it still should be possible to make everything consistent.
I also disagree with putting the condition inline instead of in an equation environment.

True. Then this is a defect.

Only if the poset is ranked. But yes, I think I can make a certificate.

As you wish. But for example `is_join_semidistributive()` then looks a little different.

I'll look at this a day or few days later.

Good point about the rankedness, but we should be try to be consistent with our certificate.

IMO, it's easier to read with it being on its own line in the html docs. Thanks.

I will be at a SageDays this upcoming week so I should get to review it quickly.

Replying to [@tscrim](#comment%3A18):
> Any thoughts on the certificate given an `L`?

I think I'll just implement the `L` parameter for non-ranked lattices as you suggested, also with `certificate`. That may take some time. (Please notify if you plan to do it yourself, so we won't do the same job twise.)

This may relate to #21903: what is the fastest way to compute neutral elements? It is easy to find a non-distributivity certificate, and can the lattice be "shrinked" so that only neutral elements remain? Gonna think that for a while too...

Thank you.

However, looking at the previous documentation, I like the flow better (1 element modular and then the definition for the entire poset). You can also use `\neq` instead of `\not=`.

Another possible optimization, which would mean more work, would be to push the actual comparison tests to `HasseDiagram` and just convert back the elements in the certificate. However, we don't have to do this on this ticket.

Well, yes and no. This is more logical if we think the function as a whole. OTOH if we see `is_modular()` without `L`-parameter a "main function" for this, then it should be said first. Anyways, I changed that.

True, but even more than that I should think about the algorithm itself. No time for that for now.

I would change it to:

```
        .. MATH::

            x \vee (a \wedge b) = (x \vee a) \wedge b

        for every element `x \leq b` and `a`.
```
Otherwise LGTM and you can set a positive review on my behalf.
