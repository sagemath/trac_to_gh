The following should probably work:

```python
sage: x = SR.symbol('x', domain='integer')
sage: y = SR.symbol('y', domain='integer')
sage: x % y
```
but instead it raises the following error:

```pytb
TypeError: unsupported operand parent(s) for '%': 'Symbolic Ring' and 'Symbolic Ring'
```

This is the behaviour in SymPy:

```python
In [9]: x%y
Out[9]: Mod(x, y)
```

Component: **symbolics**

Keywords: **remainder, modulo**

There is consensus on sage-devel that operations combining variables and elements of Zmod should not be supported by the symbolic ring (which mainly deals with calculus). While this is not such an operation per se, the expression will certainly be used later in operations. I'm not dismissing the ticket, just saying don't hold your breath.
