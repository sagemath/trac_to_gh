`ipywidgets` uses `inspect.getcallargs` which has a subtle bug in case the inspected function has a `func` keyword argument: http://bugs.python.org/issue20108

This is fixed in Python 3.3 and later. We can easily backport the fix to Python 2.7.

While I'm at it, I also removed `sdist.patch` (which was about `.hg` directories and is clearly no longer relevant) and renamed some patches with the Python issue number.

**Note to the release manager**: ideally, this would be merged together with #21441 since both tickets trigger recompilation of all Python packages.
