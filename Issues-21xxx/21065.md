To fix unpickling of old objects it is necessary to know both module and callable. At the moment module may be invisible:

```
sage:  load('http://rlmiller.org/de_codes/get_code.php?id=16_08')
...
/home/novoselt/sage/src/sage/structure/sage_object.pyx in sage.structure.sage_object.unpickle_global (build/cythonized/sage/structure/sage_object.c:12911)()
   1323     mod = sys_modules.get(module)
   1324     if mod is not None:
-> 1325         return getattr(mod, name)
   1326     try:
   1327         __import__(module)

AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'unpickle_FiniteField_prm'
```
After the fix:

```
sage:  load('http://rlmiller.org/de_codes/get_code.php?id=16_08')
...
ImportError: cannot import unpickle_FiniteField_prm from sage.rings.ring, call register_unpickle_override('sage.rings.ring', 'unpickle_FiniteField_prm', ...) to fix this
```
