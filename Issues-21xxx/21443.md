As reported on both [Ask](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/34723/error-with-solve-on-mac-os-x-10116/) and [sage-support](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-support/FDticzVa0ro), the precompiled binaries for Mac OS X are encountering errors when calling Maxima with `solve()`.

The solution for the Ask user was to install the Command Line Tools and delete the hidden `/.sage` directory, but this should not be necessary for precompiled binaries.

Clarification by @slel on another [Ask](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/35495/reinstall-to-fix-it-error-to-solve-simple-equation/) question:

```
Be careful, the directory ~/.sage contains your sage notebook worksheets.
Having encountered similar problems in the past, it was enough to remove these files:
~/.sage/sage_notebook.sagenb/users.pickle
~/.sage/sage_notebook.sagenb/sagenb.pid
```


The same error appears to have [occurred](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-support/wj4ObDhv_xE) a couple years ago and was fixed by #17375.
