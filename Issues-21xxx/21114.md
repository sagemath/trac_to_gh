Since we meanwhile require a *system* python to let Sage build anyway, we don't have to wait with building ATLAS until Sage's python has been built, as ATLAS doesn't install any Python libraries, but only its `spkg-install` has been rewritten in Python quite a while ago.

This requires two things:

* Remove the dependency of ATLAS on `$(PYTHON)` (which means Sage's `python2` or `python3` package) in its `dependencies`.

* Make ATLAS' `spkg-install` again a shell script, renaming the current one to `spkg-install.py`, say, where the shell script just contains

```sh
#!/bin/sh
exec python spkg-install.py
```
   This is necessary because `sage-spkg` checks whether *Sage's* `python` is already installed if an `spkg-install` script starts with `#! ... python`, and bails out otherwise:

```
atlas-3.10.2.p2
====================================================
Setting up build directory for atlas-3.10.2.p2
Finished set up
Error: The spkg-install script is written in Python, but the Python
package is not yet installed in Sage.  You should add $(PYTHON)
as dependency in build/pkgs/atlas/dependencies
make[2]: *** [.../sage/local/var/lib/sage/installed/atlas-3.10.2.p2] Error 1
```
  (Note that this message originates from a build where the `Makefile` was broken, such that the `make` dependency of ATLAS on the python package was fulfilled by `$(PYTHON)` accidentally being empty.  So one won't get this message unless the `Makefile` is corrupted.)

Rather orthogonal to that, our top-level `configure` doesn't contain any check for `python` yet, although currently at least `sage-download-file` and `sage-uncompress-spkg` require (a system) python (in the beginning of the build).  I'll address that on another ticket -- see #21116.

Depends on #30350
