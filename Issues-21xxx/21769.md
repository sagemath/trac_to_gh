You can pass in words:

```
sage: d = {Word('00'):Word('0000'), Word('01'):Word('1001'),
....:      Word('10'):Word('0100'), Word('11'):Word('1101')}
sage: WordMorphism(d)
WordMorphism: 00->0000, 01->1001, 10->0100, 11->1101
```
However, it is a bit cumbersome.

I'm not an expert enough on words to say if this is a valid morphism or not, but at least my na√Øve thought (i.e., equating to a morphism of a free monoid) is the domain must be letters. So I would expect this assumption in the code. Vincent, perhaps you can comment more on this?

The alphabet can be anything, including strings of length two. The syntax `"00->0000,01->1001,10->0100,11->1101"` is only a wrapper to ease self-evident definitions (imagine if the alphabet contains the string '->'...), so it won't work when there is an ambiguity, which is good. We wight be a bit more flexible, but we should not guess in case of ambiguity.

Be careful by the way that Travis's proposition lead to a morphism  with domain `Finite words over {word: 00, word: 01, word: 10, word: 11}` and codomain `Finite words over {'0', '1'}` (you might have expected the codomain to be `Finite words over {word: 00, word: 01, word: 10, word: 11}`, but how could Sage guess?).

<div id="comment:5" align="right">comment:5</div>

Here is the motivation that I had when I made this ticket: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baum%E2%80%93Sweet_sequence

I think that it would be possible to do this by doing something like

```
a->aa
b->ca
c->ba
d->db
```

and then just change a to 00, b to 01, c to 10, and d to 11.

Dear Marco,

1) The sequence you used does not coincide with wikipedia at the seventh position

```
1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0 # in the ticket
1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1 # on wikipedia
```
  there is something wrong with the substitution definition.

2) You should say that the Baum-Sweet word is on the alphabet `{0, 1}`.

3) You should add a reference to wikipedia (see for example `finite_word.py` line 3568 on how to do that).

4) I do not like calling `f: 00 -> 0000, 01 -> 1001, etc` a morphism. The reason is that you consider the alphabet `{0,1}` and `f` is not a morphism of the free monoid `{0, 1}*`. It is a morphism of the submodules of words of even length that is generated by `{00, 01, 10, 11}` ( it is a free monoid on these four generators). Either you say that it is a morphism on this specific submonoid or you say something more vague such as "rewriting rule".

Just to be clear,

Did you mean submonoid?

If so, would

```
The Baum-Sweet Sequence is an infinite word over the alphabet `\{0,1\}` defined as a
fixed point of the following morphism over the submodule of words of even length
generated by `\{00,01,10,11\}`:
```

be sufficient or should I just write it is a word over `\{0,1\}` with the following string substitution rules...

This is less formal but less precise... up to you.

If it was me, I would actually use the second formulation first and then make a remark about the fact that this substitution rule could be define as a morphism on the submonoid of words of even length.

Hi, sorry, I had a visitor last week and I was not working during the weekend... In this comment, I am replying only to the description of the ticket:

Replying to [ticket:21769 mcognetta]:
> WordMorphism fails with morphisms that have domains with elements of greater than length 1.

I do not agree, letters can be anything that is hashable:

```
sage: m = WordMorphism({
....: (0,0):[(0,0),(0,0)], 
....: (0,1):[(1,0),(0,1)], 
....: (1,0):[(0,1),(0,0)], 
....: (1,1):[(1,1),(0,1)]})
....: 
sage: 
sage: m
WordMorphism: (0, 0)->(0, 0),(0, 0), (0, 1)->(1, 0),(0, 1), (1, 0)->(0, 1),(0, 0), (1, 1)->(1, 1),(0, 1)
sage: m([(0,0)])
word: (0, 0),(0, 0)
sage: m([(0,0),(1,0),(0,1)])
word: (0, 0),(0, 0),(0, 1),(0, 0),(1, 0),(0, 1)
sage: m([(0,0),(1,0),(0,1),(1,1),(1,1)])
word: (0, 0),(0, 0),(0, 1),(0, 0),(1, 0),(0, 1),(1, 1),(0, 1),(1, 1),(0, 1)
sage: m.fixed_point((0,0))
word: (0, 0),(0, 0),(0, 0),(0, 0),(0, 0),(0, 0),(0, 0),(0, 0),(0, 0),(0, 0),(0, 0),(0, 0),(0, 0),(0, 0),(0, 0),(0, 0),(0, 0),(0, 0),(0, 0),(0, 0),(0, 0),(0, 0),(0, 0),(0, 0),(0, 0),(0, 0),(0, 0),(0, 0),(0, 0),(0, 0),(0, 0),(0, 0),(0, 0),(0, 0),(0, 0),(0, 0),(0, 0),(0, 0),(0, 0),(0, 0),...
```

But then those letter of arbitrary length are still considered as of length 1. Is this what you want?

```
sage: w = m([(0,0)])
sage: w
word: (0, 0),(0, 0)
sage: w.length()
2
```

> There is also some unfortunate behavior if you try to define the morphism as a dict.

In the documentation, you will see that the images must be defined as a list. For example, Thue Morse morphism can be defined like this using a dict:

```
sage: WordMorphism({0:[0,1], 1:[1,0]})
WordMorphism: 0->01, 1->10
```

Therefore, I do not see what you are expecting from this part of the description of the ticket:

> ```
> sage: WordMorphism({00:0000,01:1001,10:0100,11:1101})
> DeprecationWarning: use 0o as octal prefix instead of 0
> If you do not want this number to be interpreted as octal, remove the leading zeros.
> See http://trac.sagemath.org/17413 for details.
>   exec(code_obj, self.user_global_ns, self.user_ns)
> WordMorphism: 0->0, 1->1001, 10->64, 11->1101
> ```

Note also that leading zero are intepreted as octal system in Python:

```
sage: 0100
64
```

> It makes sense why the above example does not work, but it would be nice if one could do it this way.

What do you mean by "this way"? Because I do not think that we want to change the fact that 0100 is 64 in Python...

A morphism is a function which satisfies f(uv) = f(u)f(v). Therefore, defining the images on the letters is sufficient. Maybe what you want to implement is something more general (like a substitution). If yes, I think it would be easier to implement as a new Python class in a new file substitution.py, instead of generalizing morphism.py.

Would it be possible that the description of the ticket be updated to what is now the current goal of the ticket? Thank you!

It would be nice to support morphisms with domain being a submoinoid of the free monoid like we have here: the monoid generated by {00, 01, 10, 11}¬†which is the even length words. In this context, the Baum-Sweet sequence is a fixed point! But it is beyond the scope of this ticket.

----
-**The following is from the original ticket before it was modified.**
-
-WordMorphism fails with morphisms that have domains with elements of greater than length 1.
-For example, the morphism below:
-
-
-00‚Üí0000
-
-01‚Üí1001
-
-10‚Üí0100
-
-11‚Üí1101
-
-One fix for this could be checking if the language of domain of the morphism is prefix-free (if it is, the morphism should still be valid) or if every element in the domain is the same length.
-
-Example:
-
-```
-sage: WordMorphism("00->0000,01->1001,10->0100,11->1101")
-ValueError: The second and third characters must be '->' (not '0-')
-```
-
-There is also some unfortunate behavior if you try to define the morphism as a dict.
-
-```
-sage: WordMorphism({00:0000,01:1001,10:0100,11:1101})
-DeprecationWarning: use 0o as octal prefix instead of 0
-If you do not want this number to be interpreted as octal, remove the leading zeros.
-See http://trac.sagemath.org/17413 for details.
-  exec(code_obj, self.user_global_ns, self.user_ns)
-WordMorphism: 0->0, 1->1001, 10->64, 11->1101
-```
-
-It makes sense why the above example does not work, but it would be nice if one could do it this way.
-
-I tried to mess around with it a few more times to see if there was a way of doing it without modifying the underlying code but I didn't get anywhere. I was trying to use patterns used in the examples as that would be what most users would go off of.
-
-```
-sage: WordMorphism({(0,0):(0,0,0,0),(0,1):(1,0,0,1),(1,0):(0,1,0,0),(1,1):(1,1,0,1)})
-WordMorphism: (0, 0)->0000, (0, 1)->1001, (1, 0)->0100, (1, 1)->1101
-```
-
-
-I'd like to work on this if this is deemed something that should be fixed.
