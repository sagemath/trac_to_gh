Building sage outputs a lot. Especially in highly parallelized builds, the output is not very useful. 

This ticket implements an option to silence the build, using `make` argument (or environment variable) `V=0`. (This mimics the interface of [Automake silent rules](https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/html_node/Automake-Silent-Rules.html#Automake-Silent-Rules); so this is one step towards #21566):

```
$ make -j8 V=0 autotools
make -j8 build/make/Makefile
make[1]: warning: -jN forced in submake: disabling jobserver mode.
make[1]: `build/make/Makefile' is up to date.
*** ALL ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES BEFORE BUILD: ***
... long list of environment variables elided -- this ticket does nothing about that ...

```

Note that, though all output is redirected, the interactive questions (#20884, #21082) still go through to the terminal. This is achieved by using `/dev/tty`.

The patch also unconditionally silences a few make recipe lines involving `sage-logger`.

Follow-up ticket: #21589

Two comments: 

- in the past (see #12729, for example), there were objections (by Jeroen, and maybe others) to not producing the full `install.log` file as is done now: this can be useful for debugging race conditions.

- I think the output hard to read. I would like something like the proposed output at #12729 better. That is, change

```
Running 'sage-spkg mpc-1.0.3.p0', output appears in /path/to/SAGE_ROOT/log/pkgs/mpc-1.0.3.p0.log ...
Running 'sage-spkg mpc-1.0.3.p0', output appears in /path/to/SAGE_ROOT/log/pkgs/mpc-1.0.3.p0.log ... done
```
 to something like

```
[mpc-1.0.3.p0] installing. Log file: logs/pkgs/mpc-1.0.3.p0.log
  [mpc-1.0.3.p0] installed successfully.
```
 The path to the log file should be given relative to `SAGE_ROOT`, which shortens the message, making it less likely that the line wraps, since line-wrapping is part of what makes the output hard to read.

Okay, so I assume that if this is merged, `configure` will automatically be updated.

This doesn't silence warnings, maybe it's not silencing STDERR, only STDOUT. So I see messages on the screen like

```
make[3]: warning: -jN forced in submake: disabling jobserver mode.
make[3]: `/Users/jpalmier/Desktop/Sage_stuff/sage_builds/TESTING/sage/local/var/lib/sage/installed/zlib-1.2.8.p0' is up to date.
```
I want to see warnings if there is a serious problem, but it would be nice if I didn't have to see these minor ones.

I'm also seeing many lines of the form

```
cp /Users/jpalmier/Desktop/Sage_stuff/sage_builds/TESTING/sage/src/ext/doctest/invalid/syntax_error.tachyon /Users/jpalmier/Desktop/Sage_stuff/sage_builds/TESTING/sage/local/share/sage/ext/doctest/invalid/syntax_error.tachyon
```
I guess they come from the target `$(SAGE_EXTCODE)`. I think that output should be silenced, too, or at least abbreviated ("[sage-extcode] installing...").
