There are implementations of `quo_rem()` in `Polynomial_generic_dense` and the like, but not in the `Polynomial` base class itself, so that specialized implementations of polynomials must implement it to workâ€”while `Polynomial` does provide `_add_`, `_mul_` etc.

Component: **commutative algebra**
