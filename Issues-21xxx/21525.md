The wrapper script installed by our autotools package (from `build/pkgs/autotools/autofoo`)
depends on the SAGE_LOCAL variable. Not a good idea; we can do better.

(This is a step towards this goal of #21566: "By allowing the user to choose the installation hierarchy, there are new requirements. What is installed there should run without requiring environment variables to be set.")
