Avoid

```
try:
    something()
except:
    ...
```
but catch a specific exception instead (to avoid catching `KeyboardInterrupt` for example).

In a few cases, I am replacing

```
try:
    something()
except:
    raise ...
```
by

```
something()
```
since the original exception is often more interesting than the newly raised exception.

One more `except:` is fixed by #21231.

I can not test `src/mac-app/tools/createDSStore/biplist/__init__.py`, but OTOH can't see what could go wrong with it.

But how do I got

```
$ ./sage -t build/sage_bootstrap/download/cmdline.py

? Is there something special about testing this file?

I don't think that files inside `build/sage_bootstrap` are meant to be doctested. In any case, the file `build/sage_bootstrap/download/cmdline.py` contains no doctests.

OK, then I mark this as positive review.

I changed milestone to 7.5, as 7.4rc0 is already out. I guess this kind of changes won't be closed in rc-phase.
