For example

```
G = Graph()
known_kaboom = ['is_prime', 'layout_graphviz']
errors = []
for f in [y for y in dir(G) if y[0] != '_']:
    if f in known_kaboom:
        continue
    try:
        attrcall(f)(G)
    except TypeError as e:
        if "takes exactly" in e.message:
            continue
    except Exception as e:
        print(f, e)
        print
        errors.append(f)
        continue
errors
```

shows some errors on empty graph (or more general in a corner case: `eulerian_circuit` on any graph without edges). Correct them.

True, but that should done in every function, not just for those I now modified.

Maybe at the same time when checking docstrings. There are too many "Returns" vs. "Return", "Return if the graph..." vs. "Tests whether the graph" etc, and also some indentation errors.

I don't like these lines:

```diff
+        if self.size() == 0:
+            raise ValueError("can't get a random vertex from the empty graph")
```

There are graphs with no edges which are not the empty graph.

Perhaps you wanted to put there `self.order()` instead?

Some other failures (here `g` is the empty graph).

1. `g.average_degree()` (both this and `g.maximum_average_degree()` may raise, perhaps, `ZeroDivisionError`, but in this case a more informative error would be helpful probably)
2. `g.bridges()` raises `StopIteration`.  Should probably return an empty list.
3. `g.density()` returns 0.  This should probably raise an error instead (`ZeroDivisionError`?) or return NaN.
4. The diameter and radius methods for the null graph currently raise a `ValueError`. Shouldn't they return plus or minus inifnity, as they represent the minimum and the maximum of some function, taken over an empty set?
5. `g.gomory_hu_tree` raises `StopIteration`.
6. About your fix in finding Hamilton cycles: I don't think that the problem of finding a Hamilton cycle is not well defined for graphs with less than 2 vertices.  I just think that these graphs are not Hamiltonian.  If one tries the method `g.hamiltonian cycle` on `PetersenGraph`, for example, the error raised is `EmptySetError: The given graph is not Hamiltonian`.  I don't think there should be a difference between the responses.  Not sure `EmptySetError` is the best response; but if this is the response for the Petersen graph, it should be the response for 0/1-vertex graphs as well, as these graphs simply do not have a Hamilton cycle (as thry do not even have cycles!).

9. Not sure about that: but isn't the empty graph vertex transitive?
10. The number of faces of the empty graph is no 0, but rather 1 - or undefined.  A matter of taste probably.  See also #22003.
21. `g.show3d` raises an unrelated error: `AttributeError: 'int' object has no attribute 'show'`.

Finally, should we add the alias `NullGraph` to `EmptyGraph`?

OK, I'll check them.

Yes, but it is irritating.

OK, here is a patch that makse those graphs to return False.

However, I do not know that much about graphs. Hence I hope someone else also to comment on this. I suppose there has been some reason for making them to raise an exception.

> 8. In the function `is_weakly_chordal` you have added a test for `is_long_hole_free`. Seems to be a copy-paste error. Make sure you fix and test both.


Yes, my error. Corrected.

I confused myself between methods `is_hamiltonian` and `traveling_salesman_problem`. I checked again and it's OK.

Concerning error messages, I saw in other tickets that messages should start with `the` instead of `The` and that endpoint should be removed. This is correct here.

This patch passes all tests on `src/sage/graphs`, so for me it's good to go.
