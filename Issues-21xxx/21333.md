Johan Rosenkilde's [Codinglib](https://bitbucket.org/jsrn/codinglib) implements Alekhnovich algorithm to compute the roots (in `F[x]`) of a polynomial in `F[x][y]`, where `F` is a finite field.

This ticket ports this implementation to Sage. The proposed implementation is a modification of Codinglib's code, using Sage's polynomials instead of (explicitly manipulated) list of coefficients. As a result, we get a slight improvement on the running times. (Quick and dirty tests show gain of 10% to 20%.)
