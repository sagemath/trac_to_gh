IMO, a better way to do

```python
        pseudocomplements = [self.pseudocomplement(e) for e in self]
        if None in pseudocomplements:
            raise ValueError("lattice is not pseudocomplemented")
```
would be

```python
        pseudocomplements = []
        for e in self:
            p = self.pseudocomplement(e)
            if p is None:
                raise ValueError("lattice is not pseudocomplemented")
            pseudocomplements.append(p)
```
because it will error out faster if there is a problem.

Can be done, of course, but are you sure about this? It means optimizing for a part that should not be run often. (`is_pseudcomplemented()` has short-circuit evaluation, of course.)

To compare, I have not thinked speed at all when making this. There might be some easy way to compute the skeleton much faster.
