IMO, a better way to do

```python
        pseudocomplements = [self.pseudocomplement(e) for e in self]
        if None in pseudocomplements:
            raise ValueError("lattice is not pseudocomplemented")
```
would be

```python
        pseudocomplements = []
        for e in self:
            p = self.pseudocomplement(e)
            if p is None:
                raise ValueError("lattice is not pseudocomplemented")
            pseudocomplements.append(p)
```
because it will error out faster if there is a problem.

Can be done, of course, but are you sure about this? It means optimizing for a part that should not be run often. (`is_pseudcomplemented()` has short-circuit evaluation, of course.)

To compare, I have not thinked speed at all when making this. There might be some easy way to compute the skeleton much faster.

What more to optimize? Not useful but very interesting question!
