In the html compiled doc of `sage.coding.hamming_code`, the `[HP]` doesn't show up as a link for me. Shouldn't it?

EDIT: Many other links are also not hyperlinked, maybe all occurrences where the def is not in the same file, at least uses of [HP] and [BH12].

I just don't get Sphinx: apparently the errors I saw (missing hyperlink + error in incremental build) was because of the **non-ReST** citation `[HP]` in `linear_code.py`? Great error then: `WARNING: citation not found: HP`...

IMHO it was because in the first branch I removed `.. [HP] ` in one file and left `- [HP] ` in another, without replacing it by `.. [HP] `. No wonder incremental build did not work.
