<a id='comment:12'></a>- With the updated version of magma, I'm getting consistent results with most examples. Although here is one that is not working correctly:

```
234*x^11*h + 104832*x^10*h^2 + 21346884*x^9*h^3 + 2608021728*x^8*h^4 +

3962625618555930456*x^2*h^10 + 32266526239647689652*x*h^11 +
119421058057217196228*h^12
```

It looks like the z0 part is correct, then the 2nd part is not.

- I'm not sure the inversion is correct. Take a look at part (2) on p13 of the paper. It may be causing the difference here

```
-234*x^10 - 95940*x^9*h - 17701164*x^8*h^2 - 1935379368*x^7*h^3 -138869177616*x^6*h^4 - 6832744528662*x^5*h^5 - 233468654564574*x^4*h^6 -5470310129096358*x^3*h^7 - 84114643276174446*x^2*h^8 -766469114143193916*x*h^9 - 3142950903278916444*h^10
```
which has

```
magma: [1,-41,0,1] vs sage: [-1,-41,0,-1]
```
or this may be the same error as in the previous bullet point.

- Also, the code is in need of a comments describing what each piece is doing.

- I also think the try/except for the NJinv can be simplified to

```
if NJinv.base_ring() != KK:
    NJinv = matrix(KK,2,2,[KK(zw.numerator()/zw.denominator()) for zw in NJinv.list()])
```
Then you can remove the .numerator() on the v0's later in the code.

<a id='comment:21'></a>I did some general code clean-up and added some more description to the documentation. I also fixed the formatting issues in the documentation and examples. You should double check those changes.

For functionality

- I'm getting consistent results with Magma now. The only difference (besides trivial differences) is that in the case of a polynomial with a single multiple root, Magma moves that root to infinity and then minimizes the resulting poly. I assume this is to make the 'degree' as low as possible. This implementation does not, but the resulting coefficients here are actually smaller, so I don't really see this is an error, just a difference in implementation.

For projective morphism, there are a couple things 

- the error_limit param needs to be passed in as well and an example where prec/error is needed.

- It is currently removing any multiple roots from the dynatomic: is this what you want to do since the algorithm is able to handle multiple roots as long as the multiplicity isn't too high?

btw, I set the default prec to 300, since that worked for nearly all my randomly generated examples.

<a id='comment:24'></a>A couple basic issues from the docs

in multi polynomial:

- input not formatting correctly

- check consistency in your use of the ZZ versus Z macro for integer ring

in projective:

the following do not match and does not need to be repeated twice anyway.

```
Still seeing issues in projective morphism
See sage.rings.polynomials.reduced_form() for details.

See sage.rings.polynomial.multi_polynomial.reduced_form() for the information on binary form reduction.
```


The following examples fail

```
P.<x,y>=ProjectiveSpace(QQ,1)
H=End(P)
f=H([x^3,y^3])
f.reduced_form()
```

QQbar seems to work for polys but not maps

```
P.<x,y>=ProjectiveSpace(QQbar,1)
H=End(P)
f=H([x^4,y^4])
f.reduced_form()
```

The behavior for RR,CC is not consistent between polynomials and morphisms

```
P.<x,y>=ProjectiveSpace(RR,1)
H=End(P)
f=H([x^4,y^4])
f.reduced_form()
```

vs

```
R.<x>=PolynomialRing(RR)
F=19*x^8 - 262*x^7 + 1507*x^6 - 4784*x^5+9202*x^4 - 10962*x^3 + 7844*x^2-3040*x+475
G=F.homogenize()
G.reduced_form()
```
