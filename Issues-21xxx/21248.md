- With the updated version of magma, I'm getting consistent results with most examples. Although here is one that is not working correctly:

```
234*x^11*h + 104832*x^10*h^2 + 21346884*x^9*h^3 + 2608021728*x^8*h^4 +
212413000410*x^7*h^5 + 12109691106162*x^6*h^6 + 493106447396862*x^5*h^7
+ 14341797993350646*x^4*h^8 + 291976289803277118*x^3*h^9 +
3962625618555930456*x^2*h^10 + 32266526239647689652*x*h^11 +
119421058057217196228*h^12
```

It looks like the z0 part is correct, then the 2nd part is not.

- I'm not sure the inversion is correct. Take a look at part (2) on p13 of the paper. It may be causing the difference here

```
-234*x^10 - 95940*x^9*h - 17701164*x^8*h^2 - 1935379368*x^7*h^3 -138869177616*x^6*h^4 - 6832744528662*x^5*h^5 - 233468654564574*x^4*h^6 -5470310129096358*x^3*h^7 - 84114643276174446*x^2*h^8 -766469114143193916*x*h^9 - 3142950903278916444*h^10
```
which has

```
magma: [1,-41,0,1] vs sage: [-1,-41,0,-1]
```
or this may be the same error as in the previous bullet point.

- Also, the code is in need of a comments describing what each piece is doing.

- I also think the try/except for the NJinv can be simplified to

```
if NJinv.base_ring() != KK:
    NJinv = matrix(KK,2,2,[KK(zw.numerator()/zw.denominator()) for zw in NJinv.list()])
```
Then you can remove the .numerator() on the v0's later in the code.

- docs still don't build

- here is another one that maybe doesn't work

```
-1872*x^5*h - 1375452*x^4*h^2 - 404242956*x^3*h^3 - 59402802888*x^2*h^4 - 4364544068352*x*h^5 - 128270946360960*h^6
```

Stoll's implementation in magma gives

```
12168*x^3 - 18252*x^2 + 9828*x - 1872
[-148  147]
[   1   -1]
```
Although he may be doing some extra reducing to get the lower degree result

Here is a similar one that also maybe doesn't work:

```
-1872*x^4 - 1098396*x^3*h - 241680348*x^2*h^2 - 23634111384*x*h^3 - 866695583520*h^4

I did some general code clean-up and added some more description to the documentation. I also fixed the formatting issues in the documentation and examples. You should double check those changes.

For functionality

- I'm getting consistent results with Magma now. The only difference (besides trivial differences) is that in the case of a polynomial with a single multiple root, Magma moves that root to infinity and then minimizes the resulting poly. I assume this is to make the 'degree' as low as possible. This implementation does not, but the resulting coefficients here are actually smaller, so I don't really see this is an error, just a difference in implementation.

For projective morphism, there are a couple things 

- the error_limit param needs to be passed in as well and an example where prec/error is needed.

- It is currently removing any multiple roots from the dynatomic: is this what you want to do since the algorithm is able to handle multiple roots as long as the multiplicity isn't too high?

btw, I set the default prec to 300, since that worked for nearly all my randomly generated examples.

<a id='comment:24'>**Comment 24:**</a>
A couple basic issues from the docs

in multi polynomial:

- input not formatting correctly

- check consistency in your use of the ZZ versus Z macro for integer ring

in projective:

the following do not match and does not need to be repeated twice anyway.

```
Still seeing issues in projective morphism
See sage.rings.polynomials.reduced_form() for details.

See sage.rings.polynomial.multi_polynomial.reduced_form() for the information on binary form reduction.
```


The following examples fail

```
P.<x,y>=ProjectiveSpace(QQ,1)
H=End(P)
f=H([x^3,y^3])
f.reduced_form()
```

QQbar seems to work for polys but not maps

```
P.<x,y>=ProjectiveSpace(QQbar,1)
H=End(P)
f=H([x^4,y^4])
f.reduced_form()
```

The behavior for RR,CC is not consistent between polynomials and morphisms

```
P.<x,y>=ProjectiveSpace(RR,1)
H=End(P)
f=H([x^4,y^4])
f.reduced_form()
```

vs

```
R.<x>=PolynomialRing(RR)
F=19*x^8 - 262*x^7 + 1507*x^6 - 4784*x^5+9202*x^4 - 10962*x^3 + 7844*x^2-3040*x+475
G=F.homogenize()
G.reduced_form()
```

Go ahead and test this version and let me know what you find.

You should rather avoid playing with the milestone once the ticket is closed.

This being said, nothing bad should happen.

Side remark: has anybody proofread this code ? there are several typos (boundry, lease, ...)

Yeah, i don't usually mess with the milestone post closing, but when it was marked positive 7.4 was still in beta, then it got released and this was closed into 7.5.

I didn't expect correcting that to interfere with other fields.


side reply: apparently not as carefully as you.
