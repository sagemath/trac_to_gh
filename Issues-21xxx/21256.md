There are various issues with `widgetsnbextension`:

1. It must be installed using `pip`. The typical `python setup.py install` does not work. See [https://github.com/ipython/ipywidgets/issues/718](https://github.com/ipython/ipywidgets/issues/718). This is fixed by #20218.

2. We need to enable the `widgetsnbextension` for `ipywidgets` to actually work.

3. We add a patch to remove deprecated ``@`interact` abbreviations. This patch is applied upstream to version 6. To be more compatible with SageNB, we add this patch right now.
