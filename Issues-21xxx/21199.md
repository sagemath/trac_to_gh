Installing optional package `python3` currently breaks sage, as it relinks `python` to `python3` in `SAGE_LOCAL/bin`. It should not do this.

In the latter case then yes, it should not change the `python` link.

I bet people doing `./sage -i python3` will expect Sage to suddenly work with Python3, which is not the case.  So I'd simply disable that option (for the time being).

I'm not entirely sure, but I think Cython extension modules compiled for/with Python2 won't work with Python3 (and vice versa), so we'd at least have to rebuild all of these.

Just having another Python interpreter inside Sage you cannot use with Sage IMHO doesn't make sense.

There's `update-alternatives` (on Debian at least), but while you can otherwise of course have both `python2` and `python3` at the same time, you'd have to install any additional package into **both**, since these are *separate*, independent installations.

That's similar to having *two instances of Sage*, one configured to use Python2 (the default), the other with `SAGE_PYTHON3=yes` (IIRC).

You mean in the **same** Sage installation?

Exactly that IMHO doesn't make sense, and would just cause lots of trouble (or needless additional work in order to support that, presumably just for a while anyway, since in the long run Sage will always and only build and use its own *Python3*).

\\

> and that would be especially good for development of Python 3 in Sage.

For developing migration, you should have a *separate* Sage installation configured with `SAGE_PYTHON3=yes`.

\\

> Installing one just shouldn't break the other.  Clearly that's not currently the case.

Sure.  Disable that, with an appropriate message if someone tries to... ;-)

In fact, it turned out that to completely fix my Sage installation, I also needed to rebuild python2 package, and then run make.
Otherwise ipython, doctesting, and some stuff related to dictionaries didn't quite work.
So this is not that trivial, apparently, and needs further investigation.

Well, this points out to more bugs, IMHO...
On the other hand it could be the damage from setting the symbolic link the way it is done now, and if it did not happen then things work.

By the way, `python3` doesn't even have an `SPKG.txt`, so it's not a valid spkg anyway. ;-)

\\

W.r.t. having to reinstall `python2`:

The `spkg-install` files currently also wipe out `$SAGE_LOCAL/lib/libpython*` before installing the new version.

What do you mean exactly by "Sage installation"?  You mean the filesystem in `$SAGE_LOCAL`?  What's the big deal?  I usually have like a dozen Pythons installed at the same time.  This is no problem.

That's a lot of duplicated software just to have two different Pythons installed.  No, that doesn't make any sense.  Currently you may have to do that--I'm just saying `./sage` itself should know which Python it's using, and be able to switch that as needed.

Changing it to experimental is now #21698. Please let's get this into 7.4.
