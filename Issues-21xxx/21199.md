Installing optional package `python3` currently breaks sage, as it relinks `python` to `python3` in `SAGE_LOCAL/bin`. It should not do this.

If having both Python2 and Python3 at the same time (modulo the link) *really works* (which I doubt), then we could of course just prevent symlinking `local/bin/python` to `python{2,3}` in the `spkg-install` files, in case the other Python is already installed.

There's `update-alternatives` (on Debian at least), but while you can otherwise of course have both `python2` and `python3` at the same time, you'd have to install any additional package into **both**, since these are *separate*, independent installations.

That's similar to having *two instances of Sage*, one configured to use Python2 (the default), the other with `SAGE_PYTHON3=yes` (IIRC).

You mean in the **same** Sage installation?

Exactly that IMHO doesn't make sense, and would just cause lots of trouble (or needless additional work in order to support that, presumably just for a while anyway, since in the long run Sage will always and only build and use its own *Python3*).

\\

> and that would be especially good for development of Python 3 in Sage.

For developing migration, you should have a *separate* Sage installation configured with `SAGE_PYTHON3=yes`.

\\

> Installing one just shouldn't break the other.  Clearly that's not currently the case.

Sure.  Disable that, with an appropriate message if someone tries to... ;-)

By the way, `python3` doesn't even have an `SPKG.txt`, so it's not a valid spkg anyway. ;-)

W.r.t. having to reinstall `python2`:

The `spkg-install` files currently also wipe out `$SAGE_LOCAL/lib/libpython*` before installing the new version.

What do you mean exactly by "Sage installation"?  You mean the filesystem in `$SAGE_LOCAL`?  What's the big deal?  I usually have like a dozen Pythons installed at the same time.  This is no problem.

That's a lot of duplicated software just to have two different Pythons installed.  No, that doesn't make any sense.  Currently you may have to do that--I'm just saying `./sage` itself should know which Python it's using, and be able to switch that as needed.

Changing it to experimental is now #21698. Please let's get this into 7.4.
