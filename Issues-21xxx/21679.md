<a id='comment:2'></a>- Upstream gpg signature is correct
- `sage -f -c openssl` builds and self-tests without error
- After `sage -f python2` and `make`, `sage -pip` works remotely (uses https) and `sage -n jupyter` starts without complaining about broken ssl.

I am not sure if i should add some other test. Anyway, it could be nice if from time to time, some OSX user could to the same tests, perhaps when we will move to openssl 0.1.1x.
