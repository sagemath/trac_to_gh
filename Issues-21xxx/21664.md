sage: P = QQ^10
sage: t = type(P())
sage: t.__new__(t, P);
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occurred.
This probably occurred because a *compiled* module has a bug
in it and is not properly wrapped with sig_on(), sig_off().
Python will now terminate.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

The main change is to initialize the `_entries` of the vector in the `cdef _init()` method. This ensures that `__new__` creates valid objects.

See #21658 for more context. This branch doesn't add doctests for `__new__`, since it will be tested by #21658.
