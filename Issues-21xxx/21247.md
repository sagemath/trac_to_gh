as a tiny step towards python3, let us avoid using cmp for lazy import.

Let us just try to delete `__cmp__` from this file. There remains `__richcmp__`.

The `__cmp__` in `lazy_import.pyx` should stay because it is part of a framework (lazy imports) and not an individual class.

So I propose to close this as invalid/wontfix.

But is this really needed ?

Does removing it break something ?

How to get rid of the `cmp` inside this method ?

I may be doing stupid things, but your very short comments are not really helpful.

I'm writing short comments mainly because I have not thought very much about it. I'd rather write a short comment now with the idea that we can still think about it or discuss later.

I would like to propose this for review again, as this does not break anything.

Maybe we cannot allow to say "let us not remove this cmp now, wait until all the others have been removed" about every instance of cmp, after all. :)

Could you please explain why you think this should not be done now ?

* Does "being part of a framework" means something precise ?

* The bot is green, so this does not break anything.

* We remove `__cmp__` but there is still `__richcmp__`.

Since you seem to be insisting a lot, here is a possible compromise:

```python
def __cmp__(self, other):
    raise NotImplementedError("Old-style comparisons are not supported for lazily imported objects")
```

That will raise an exception when somebody tries to use this `__cmp__`. So if you break something, you will break it *explicitly* and people don't have to figure out that a subtle change in lazy imports broke their use case.

If this passes patchbot testing, so you can set the ticket to positive_review.
