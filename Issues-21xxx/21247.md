as a tiny step towards python3, let us avoid using cmp for lazy import.

Let us just try to delete `__cmp__` from this file. There remains `__richcmp__`.

Does removing it break something ?

How to get rid of the `cmp` inside this method ?

I may be doing stupid things, but your very short comments are not really helpful.

I'm writing short comments mainly because I have not thought very much about it. I'd rather write a short comment now with the idea that we can still think about it or discuss later.

<a id='comment:11'></a>Could you please explain why you think this should not be done now ?

* Does "being part of a framework" means something precise ?

* The bot is green, so this does not break anything.

* We remove `__cmp__` but there is still `__richcmp__`.

```python

That will raise an exception when somebody tries to use this `__cmp__`. So if you break something, you will break it *explicitly* and people don't have to figure out that a subtle change in lazy imports broke their use case.
