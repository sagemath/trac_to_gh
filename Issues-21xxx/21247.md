as a tiny step towards python3, let us avoid using cmp for lazy import.

Let us just try to delete `__cmp__` from this file. There remains `__richcmp__`.

The `__cmp__` in `lazy_import.pyx` should stay because it is part of a framework (lazy imports) and not an individual class.

So I propose to close this as invalid/wontfix.

But is this really needed ?

Does removing it break something ?

How to get rid of the `cmp` inside this method ?

I may be doing stupid things, but your very short comments are not really helpful.

I'm writing short comments mainly because I have not thought very much about it. I'd rather write a short comment now with the idea that we can still think about it or discuss later.

Could you please explain why you think this should not be done now ?

* Does "being part of a framework" means something precise ?

* The bot is green, so this does not break anything.

* We remove `__cmp__` but there is still `__richcmp__`.

<div id="comment:12" align="right">Comment 12</div>

Since you seem to be insisting a lot, here is a possible compromise:

```python
def __cmp__(self, other):
    raise NotImplementedError("Old-style comparisons are not supported for lazily imported objects")
```

That will raise an exception when somebody tries to use this `__cmp__`. So if you break something, you will break it *explicitly* and people don't have to figure out that a subtle change in lazy imports broke their use case.

If this passes patchbot testing, so you can set the ticket to positive_review.
