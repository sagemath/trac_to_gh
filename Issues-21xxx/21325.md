<a id='comment:18'></a>1. `pad_right`: One-sentence description: the syntax ```zero``s` does not yield the desired formatting: The output is `zero``s to have at least the given ``length.`

2. `pad_right`: PEP8: Missing spaces after commas in input of examples and tests.

3. `subsequence`: Description of the input parameter `b`: The meaning of `c_j(a_n+b_j)` is unclear to me.

4. `subsequence`: First example: I think that it might be more intuitive to have a simpler linear representation for the sequence `(n)_{n\ge 0}`. The current representation corresponds to the vector `(n, 2n+1)`; a representation corresponding to the vector `(n, 1)` would be simpler. It might also be helpful to state the vector explicitly.

5. `subsequence`: the new method `linear_representation` implemented in the review phase of a precursor ticket could be used instead of manually extracting the information.

6. `subsequence`: For the example `C.subsequence(3, 1)`, it might be helpful to document that this does what it should do by adding some tests of the shape
   {{{
   #!python
   sage: var('n')
   sage: def v(n):
   ....:     return vector([3*n + 1, 6*n + 1])
   sage: S.mu[0] * v(n) == v(2*n)
   True
   sage: S.mu[1] * v(n) == v(2*n + 1)
   True
   }}}
   Similar tests would be welcome in other examples, too, e.g. for `C.subsequence(1, -1)`, the vector is something like `[n -1 + delta_0(n), 2*n - 1 + delta_0(n), 4*n + 1]` where `delta_0(n)` corresponds to `int(n == 0)`:
   {{{
   #!python
   sage: function('delta_0')
   sage: def v(n):
   ....:     return vector([n -1 + delta_0(n), 2*n - 1 + delta_0(n), 4*n + 1])
   sage: def simplify_delta(expr):
   ....:     return expr.subs({delta_0(2*n): delta_0(n), delta_0(2*n + 1): 0})
   sage: simplify_delta(v(2*n) - S.mu[0]*v(n)).is_zero()
   True
   sage: simplify_delta(v(2*n + 1) - S.mu[1]*v(n)).is_zero()
   True
   }}}
   or, for `S = C.subsequence(1, {0: 1, -1: -1})`:
   {{{
   #!python
   sage: def v(n):
   ....:     return vector([1 - delta_0(n), 1])
   }}}

7. `subsequence`: is there are a particular reason to write `lines = dict((r, []) for r in A)` instead of `lines = {r: [] for r in A}`

8. `subsequence`: I think that the code could be simplified by constructing the matrices of the new linear representation as block matrices in terms of the original matrices. For instance, the loop over `i in srange(dim)` and then extracting the `i`-th row of `self.mu[f]` could be omitted (with the additional benefit of not computing `d` and `f` in `mu_line` for all values of `i`); the index computation `(di*dim)*(0,)` in `pad` could be replaced by taking the zero matrix of the parent of `self.mu[f]` (or create that zero matrix once, instead of the current `zero`), `ndim` would be unnecessary.

9. `subsequence`: I think that in the block calling `mu_line`, a comment stating that we now compute the contributions of `v(an+c)[an\ge 0]` to the linear representation by using `v(a(kn+r)+c)[a(kn+r)+c\ge 0] = v(kan+ar+c)[kan+ar+c\ge 0] = v(k(an+d)+f)[an+d\ge 0]=mu[f]v(an+d)[an+d\ge 0]` where `v(n) = self.__getitem__(n, multiply_left=False)` would be helpful.

10. `subsequence`: I am not so sure about the comment on the various ranges (and consequently, the tests testing that the range of `c` is large enough): It seems that no predefined range is used (anymore?), everything is generated dynamically. The only thing which actually matters is termination of the procedure, and if I am not mistaken, then `-|b| \le f \le max(a, |b|)` always holds which implies termination.

21. `subsequence`: I think that the construction of the new left vector could be simplified by constructing it as a "block vector" instead of an actual sum of padded tuples:

    }}}

43. `partial_sums`: the new method `linear_representation` implemented in the review phase of a precursor ticket could be used instead of manually extracting the information.

54. `partial_sums`: is there are a particular reason to write `B = dict((r, sum(self.mu[a] for a in A[r:])) for r in A)` instead of `B = {r: sum(self.mu[a] for a in A[r:]) for r in A)`?

65. `partial_sums`: `dict((r, W.augment((-B[r+1]).stack(self.mu[r]))) for r in A)` vs. `{r: ... for r in A}`

<a id='comment:19'></a>Following the discussion on [sage-devel](https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/X0a-ENF6LNk), here are two minor remarks:

Replying to [comment:18 cheuberg]:
> 18. It seems that there is no function `block_vector` in [SageMath](SageMath). I think that always constructing them via conversion to tuples, adding tuples, converting back to a vector is not very readable. I posted about `block_vector` on [sage-devel](https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/X0a-ENF6LNk/m/0iRDn28eAAAJ). If no such function is introduced in appropriate places, I suggest to have a local function in `recognizable_series.py`.
  
One can use Python's [itertools.chain](https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.chain) or [chain.from_iterable](https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.chain.from_iterable) where appropriate. For example:

```python
sage: from itertools import chain
sage: vector(chain([1,2,3], [4,5,6]))
(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) 
```

> 14. `partial_sums`: is there are a particular reason to write `B = dict((r, sum(self.mu[a] for a in A[r:])) for r in A)` instead of `B = {r: sum(self.mu[a] for a in A[r:]) for r in A)`?

I do not know much about k-regular sequences, but from a quick read it seems great to have them implementated in Sage.

> 1. `pad_right`: One-sentence description: the syntax ```zero``s` does not yield the desired formatting: The output is `zero``s to have at least the given ``length.`


Done.

> 2. `pad_right`: PEP8: Missing spaces after commas in input of examples and tests.


Done.

> 3. `subsequence`: Description of the input parameter `b`: The meaning of `c_j(a_n+b_j)` is unclear to me.


Indeed, this was incorrect. Changed now.

> 4. `subsequence`: First example: I think that it might be more intuitive to have a simpler linear representation for the sequence `(n)_{n\ge 0}`. The current representation corresponds to the vector `(n, 2n+1)`; a representation corresponding to the vector `(n, 1)` would be simpler. It might also be helpful to state the vector explicitly.


Yes, indeed we should use the simpler linear representation; changed.
Vector explicitly added (in separate commit).

> 5. `subsequence`: the new method `linear_representation` implemented in the review phase of a precursor ticket could be used instead of manually extracting the information.


Done.

> 6. `subsequence`: For the example `C.subsequence(3, 1)`, it might be helpful to document that this does what it should do by adding some tests of the shape [...]


Tests added in the `TESTS` section to not pollute the examples section in terms of readability.

> 7. `subsequence`: is there are a particular reason to write `lines = dict((r, []) for r in A)` instead of `lines = {r: [] for r in A}`


I vaguely remember that an older Python version didn't support this and parts of the code are quite old in terms of Python versions. Nevertheless, changed, as this is clearly an improvement.

Changed. However, I am not fully convinced that this rewriting made it that much better/easier to read as hoped; nevertheless, it think it made it somehow easier to understand what is going on. The loop over i, for sure, needed to be pulled out, even without the change to block matrices.

Comment (as stated) added.

> 10. `subsequence`: I am not so sure about the comment on the various ranges (and consequently, the tests testing that the range of `c` is large enough): It seems that no predefined range is used (anymore?), everything is generated dynamically.

Ok.

>     {{{

This is indeed much simpler; changed.

> 12. `partial_sums`: The description of the parameter `include_n` is rendered incompletely because ``n`th` is not formatted appropriately.


Done.

> 13. `partial_sums`: the new method `linear_representation` implemented in the review phase of a precursor ticket could be used instead of manually extracting the information.


Used now.

> 14. `partial_sums`: is there are a particular reason to write `B = dict((r, sum(self.mu[a] for a in A[r:])) for r in A)` instead of `B = {r: sum(self.mu[a] for a in A[r:]) for r in A)`?


Done.

> 15. `partial_sums`: `dict((r, W.augment((-B[r+1]).stack(self.mu[r]))) for r in A)` vs. `{r: ... for r in A}`


Done.

> 16. `partial_sums` I think that using `block_matrix([[B[0], -B[r-1]], [Z, self.mu[r]]])` would be more readable than constructing the block matrix via `stack` and `augment`; I do not think that reusing the same first block column in all matrices is worth the effort.


Agreed; changed.

Do we mind, that now the output of the linear representation sometimes is a displayed as block matrix? I guess not...

> 17. The patchbot notes two issues raised by pyflakes; one of them can probably be fixed by merging the latest version of #21318


I think this should be fixed already. Let's see what the patchbot reports.

> 18. It seems that there is no function `block_vector` in [SageMath](SageMath). I think that always constructing them via conversion to tuples, adding tuples, converting back to a vector is not very readable. I posted about `block_vector` on [sage-devel](https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/X0a-ENF6LNk/m/0iRDn28eAAAJ). If no such function is introduced in appropriate places, I suggest to have a local function in `recognizable_series.py`.


Changed to `vector(chain(...))` as discussed on the mailing list and ticket.

> 19. I am curios why there are no methods `shift_left` and `shift_right`; they could easily be implemented via `subsequence`.


Simply because not implemented. Done now.

> 20. The methods `partial_sums` and the difference methods are mostly inverse to each other.

I agree that this should be done on a follow-up ticket.

<a id='comment:29'></a>Thank you, I reviewed the changes and added a few reviewer commits (sorry for messing up the history on trac here by mistyping my branch name; the last five commits are new).

I propose another variant in branch `u/cheuberg/21325-variant` (not linked to this ticket) where I try to avoid padding and indices.

The essential lines are

```python
        kernel = list(b)

        zero_M = self.mu[0].parent().zero()
        zero_R = self.right.parent().zero()
        # Let v(n) = self.__getitem__(n, multiply_left=False)
        rule = {}
        # We will construct `kernel` and `rule` in such a way that for all
        # c in `kernel`,
        #     rule[r, c] = (f, d)
        # holds for some 0 <= f < r and some d in `kernel` such that
        #     v(a(kn+r)+c) [a(kn+r) +c >= 0] = mu[f] v(an+d) [an+d >= 0].

        ci = 0
        while ci < len(kernel):
            c = kernel[ci]
            for r in A:
                # We now compute the contributions of v(an+c)[an >= 0] to
                # the linear representation by using
                #   v(a(kn+r)+c) [a(kn+r)+c >= 0]
                #   = v(kan+ar+c) [kan+ar+c >= 0]
                #   = v(k(an+d)+f) [an+d >= 0]
                #   = mu[f] v(an+d) [an+d >= 0].
                d, f = (a*r + c).quo_rem(k)
                if d not in kernel:
                    kernel.append(d)
                rule[r, c] = (d, f)
            ci += 1

        def matrix_row(r, c):
            d, f = rule[r, c]
            return [self.mu[f] if d == j else zero_M for j in kernel]

        result = P.element_class(
            P,
            {r: Matrix.block([matrix_row(r, c) for c in kernel])
             for r in A},
            vector(chain.from_iterable(
                b.get(c, 0)*self.left
                for c in kernel)),
            vector(chain.from_iterable(
                (self.__getitem__(c, multiply_left=False) if c >= 0 else zero_R)
                for c in kernel)))
```

I do not mind.

Should the `f` in `-|b| \le f \le max(a, |b|)` be a `d`?
