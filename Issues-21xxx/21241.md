In src/doc/en/faq/faq-usage.rst around line 362, text says

```
You can also disable the preprocessor in your code via
 ``preparse(False)``.
```

This should read

```
You can also disable the preprocessor in your code via
 ``preparser(False)``.
```

Example: try the following in sage command line session. It fails with an exception.

```
num = 123
num.bit_length()
```

But this succeeds and produces output:

```
preparser(False)
num = 123
num.bit_length()

```


Keywords: **faq-usage faq preparser preparse**

In the next sentence please change "can may" to "can" and ". Or switching" to " or switch" for correct grammar.

There are two other instances of "preparse(" in this file on L286 and L333 which are correct. ~~Please correct those as well.~~
