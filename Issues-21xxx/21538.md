`./configure` should accept an argument `--with-packages=...` so that a user can request a list of packages to be installed.

One could consider to have `sage -i` edit `config.status` (`ac_cs_config`) whenever a package is installed.

Also there should be an argument `--ignored-installed-packages` so that the contents of `$SAGE_LOCAL/var/lib/sage/installed` is ignored by `configure`. This is may be useful to ensure predictable builds.

See also: #21700 - crucial to get all dependencies of all optional packages right, because we no longer can tell the user to "first install this, then install that".

Yes, this syntax could also work and is probably a better idea. 

I like `--with-foo=/path/where/installed` too, but as I said on #21566, it won't happen on this ticket.

#27567 offers a slightly different approach, but I think effectively serves the same purpose as this proposal.

One thing it doesn't do yet is provide a way to enable specific optional/experimental packages at configure time.  One might also consider that useful, but I'm treating it as a separate issue for now.
