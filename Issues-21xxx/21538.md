`./configure` should accept an argument `--with-packages=...` so that a user can request a list of packages to be installed.

One could consider to have `sage -i` edit `config.status` (`ac_cs_config`) whenever a package is installed.

Also there should be an argument `--ignored-installed-packages` so that the contents of `$SAGE_LOCAL/var/lib/sage/installed` is ignored by `configure`. This is may be useful to ensure predictable builds.

See also: #21700 - crucial to get all dependencies of all optional packages right, because we no longer can tell the user to "first install this, then install that".

#27567 offers a slightly different approach, but I think effectively serves the same purpose as this proposal.

One thing it doesn't do yet is provide a way to enable specific optional/experimental packages at configure time.  One might also consider that useful, but I'm treating it as a separate issue for now.
