I would also be in favor of:
* shipping the seadata "normal" database as a standard package, it is "only" 18 MB and necessary to do usual crypto stuff on elliptic curves over finite fields of 400-bit size but I'm highly biased here (also note that there is a "big" version now),
* splitting the current database_pari into separate packages, that will surely ease integration into distros.

What do you think?

I don't think it matters for distros. Distros can do whatever they want with those packages, independent of how Sage packages them.
