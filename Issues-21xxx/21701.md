This looks like a `pynac` or `pynac` related problem.

Do you have a clue Ralph? I have a feeling this will require some work `pynac` side rather than `sage` side, but I don't mix very well with `c++`.

Can you try with `clang -stdlib=libstdc++ ...`?

I just noticed that clang is used instead of clang++, that may have an impact. I will try to rectify that and if it doesn't work try what you said.

Even manually adding `#include <list>` in the cpp file doesn't solve the problem. There must something subtle at work.

```
pynac.pxd:        bint is_not_equal "operator!=" (GParamSetIter i)
```
looks strange. IIRC iterators can be compared for non-equality using merely `!=`.
If in `sage/libs/pynac/pynac.pyx` (line 194) I replace

```
while itr.is_not_equal(s.end()):
```
with 

```
while itr != s.end():
```
this still compiles (with gcc), and tests in symbolic/ pass, too.

Can you try this with clang?

Why would you remove these that compile? This seems to be asking for trouble.
The whole point of that `operator!=` is that you can actually provide your own implementation. E.g. in Sage there  are lots of these in `local/include/[boost,NTL]`, and moreover in

```
local/include/pynac/ptr.h:      bool operator!=(const ptr<U> & rhs) const throw() { return p != get_pointer(rhs); }
local/include/pynac/ptr.h:      inline friend bool operator!=(const ptr & lhs, const U * rhs) throw() { return lhs.p != rhs; }
local/include/pynac/ptr.h:      inline friend bool operator!=(const U * lhs, const ptr & rhs) throw() { return lhs != rhs.p; }
local/include/pynac/ex.h:       bool operator!=(const const_iterator &other) const throw()
local/include/pynac/ex.h:       bool operator!=(const _iter_rep &other) const throw()
local/include/pynac/ex.h:       bool operator!=(const const_preorder_iterator &other) const throw()
local/include/pynac/ex.h:       bool operator!=(const const_postorder_iterator &other) const throw()
local/include/pynac/operators.h:const relational operator!=(const ex & lh, const ex & rh);
local/include/pynac/numeric.h:  bool operator!=(const numeric &other) const;
```
We should check whether one of the latter must have been taken by the compiler,
but somehow the compiler didn't manage it.
I guess that in particular `GExListIter` and `GExSetIter` are dealt with such an operator in `local/include/pynac/ex.h`, and it does do some stuff...

I could understand keeping them just in case if they were working, but my experience is that they do not. If I keep them there someone will try to use them and break the clang build.

just removing them potentially introduces bugs/memory leaks. I'd think it's ok to remove the `GParamSetIter` operator!=, but not the other two. Did you have to remove the latter to compile, too?

Anyhow, this all should be fixable by doing something right in C++ code.

Hmm, what do you mean by saying "not used"? Try removing definitions of 
`operator!=` from pynac C++ headers in local/include/, and see how far
you can go (using gcc, even). E.g. this one (in ex.h) clearly does stuff:

```
        bool operator==(const const_iterator &other) const throw()
        {
                return are_ex_trivially_equal(e, other.e) && i == other.i;
        }

        bool operator!=(const const_iterator &other) const throw()
        {
                return !(*this == other);
        }
```
by invoking `are_ex_trivially_equal()`. (This would be a proper test of "not used" claim).

I forgot there is one more problem to build sage with clang that is not included in this ticket. The first line `src/sage/libs/pynac/pynac.pxd` has to be edited out.

I see no problem because in `ginac/fderivative.h`

```
typedef std::multiset<unsigned> paramset;
```
this is just a standard container with a standard iterator. Rather, the Pynac interface in `pynac.pxd` could be cleaned up more rigourously (in another ticket).

and this is why the 1st chunk of the patch :

```
     cdef GParamSetIter itr = s.begin()
     res = []
-    while itr.is_not_equal(s.end()):
+    while itr != s.end():
         res.append(itr.obj())
         itr.inc()
     return res
```
is perfectly fine with me, 
but the other ones are about different containers, and it seems that for them
`operator!=` implementations are provided, and are not totally trivial
(see my comment 39 above).
