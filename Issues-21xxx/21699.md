Did any of you run full doctests (i.e. `make ptestlong`) with this branch applied and `latte_int` installed?

I did 

```
sage -tp --long --optional=4ti2,atlas,ccache,database_gap,gap_packages,mpir,python2,latte_int,sage src/sage/geometry/
```
which is good enough, as `latte_int` is not used elsewhere
