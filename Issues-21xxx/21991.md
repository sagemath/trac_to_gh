As I was working with quadratic fields I encountered #21979 that might have been caused by `RealLazyField` related problems. Namely

```
sage: a = QuadraticField(5).gen()
sage: u = -573147844013817084101/2*a + 1281597540372340914251/2
sage: v = RLF(u)
sage: v
0.?e6
sage: v.is_zero()
False
sage: RealIntervalField(128)(v)
0
```

The attached patch fixes the problem reported in this ticket. However, the reason the conversion worked in some cases in spite of the misnamed conversion method: namely, that `RealIntervalFieldElement.__init__()` has a code path that attempts conversions to `RealField`s with directed rounding. This is sort-of-okay (and used in sage...) in the case of an “atomic” floating-point evaluation (assuming the conversion code correctly takes the rounding mode into account), but certainly not in that of `RLF`, which calls the conversion recursively on the operands of a `LazyBinop`. I'd be tempted to remove this code path altogether. However, it is used elsewhere; besides, some code in Sage does seem to have been written with the idea that it is each parent's responsibility to ensure that its conversions to `RealField` with directed rounding return upper/lower bounds on the true value.

So I'm not sure what to do. An option might be to move all existing conversions to `RealField` that return rigorous bounds to separate methods (`_mpfr_upper_bound_()` and similar, say), and call these methods directly when we expect rigorous bounds...

I am also tempted to avoid the real lazy field as much as possible. The current conversions `lazy -> interval` and `lazy -> floating` are nonsense. Did you make a list of what break when removing these methods?

Getting rid of `RLF/CLF` is doable everywhere in number fields (not sure whether it is the case).

It certainly would be possible to use them less (and also more efficiently), but it is also very convenient to have a unified way to represent constants that can be evaluated to arbitrary precision.
