Installing psutil on cygwin simply doesn't work.  It actually refuses to install on cygwin.  See attached log.

The relevant upstream issue for psutil is here: https://github.com/giampaolo/psutil/issues/82 

My in-progress pull request is here: https://github.com/giampaolo/psutil/pull/998

The attached patch is based on the current version of my pull request, where all (relevant) tests pass on Cygwin.  The code itself is a bit of a mess and needs refactoring, so it will take a little more time before I can get this accepted upstream.  But in the meantime I will maintain this patch for Sage.

That would make sense to do when a new stable release would come out. As long as we are in the "beta" stage, it doesn't really matter much.

The attached patch applies my prototype for Cygwin support in psutil.  It actually supports most of psutil's interfaces on Cygwin, not just (but certainly including) the handful used by Sage.  I could maybe make a pared down patch with just the bare minimum, but I'm not sure that's worth the trouble now.  The patch applies to psutil 5.2.0 hence the dependency on #22625

I think that this Cygwin module for psutil still needs more refactoring work before it's ready to merge upstream, but I plan to continue working on it when I can.  In the meantime, this version works (it passes psutil's test suite).  This issue is a major blocker to Cygwin support so it would be helpful to add this patch now, as I don't know how much longer it will take to get a final version of it upstream.
