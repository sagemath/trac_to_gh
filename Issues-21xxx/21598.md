Installing psutil on cygwin simply doesn't work.  It actually refuses to install on cygwin.  See attached log.

The relevant upstream issue for psutil is here: https://github.com/giampaolo/psutil/issues/82 

My in-progress pull request is here: https://github.com/giampaolo/psutil/pull/998

The attached patch is based on the current version of my pull request, where all (relevant) tests pass on Cygwin.  The code itself is a bit of a mess and needs refactoring, so it will take a little more time before I can get this accepted upstream.  But in the meantime I will maintain this patch for Sage.

Depends on #22625

That would make sense to do when a new stable release would come out. As long as we are in the "beta" stage, it doesn't really matter much.

I think it is pretty easy to use it. So it should not take much effort. But maybe it would be better for the Sage-on-Cygwin project to not immediately use `psutil`?

 Installing psutil on cygwin simply doesn't work.  It actually refuses to install on cygwin.  See attached log.
 
-The relevant issue for psutil is here: https://github.com/giampaolo/psutil/issues/82  It was determined unfixable due mainly to lack of time / expertise.  I at least suspect I can get something working.
+The relevant upstream issue for psutil is here: https://github.com/giampaolo/psutil/issues/82 
+
+My in-progress pull request is here: https://github.com/giampaolo/psutil/pull/998
+
+The attached patch is based on the current version of my pull request, where all (relevant) tests pass on Cygwin.  The code itself is a bit of a mess and needs refactoring, so it will take a little more time before I can get this accepted upstream.  But in the meantime I will maintain this patch for Sage.
