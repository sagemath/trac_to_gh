Installing psutil on cygwin simply doesn't work.  It actually refuses to install on cygwin.  See attached log.

The relevant upstream issue for psutil is here: https://github.com/giampaolo/psutil/issues/82 

My in-progress pull request is here: https://github.com/giampaolo/psutil/pull/998

The attached patch is based on the current version of my pull request, where all (relevant) tests pass on Cygwin.  The code itself is a bit of a mess and needs refactoring, so it will take a little more time before I can get this accepted upstream.  But in the meantime I will maintain this patch for Sage.

That would make sense to do when a new stable release would come out. As long as we are in the "beta" stage, it doesn't really matter much.

I think that this Cygwin module for psutil still needs more refactoring work before it's ready to merge upstream, but I plan to continue working on it when I can.  In the meantime, this version works (it passes psutil's test suite).  This issue is a major blocker to Cygwin support so it would be helpful to add this patch now, as I don't know how much longer it will take to get a final version of it upstream.
