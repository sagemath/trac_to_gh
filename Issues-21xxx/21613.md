Currently there is a `src/Makefile` at the root of the sagelib sources that is required to be invoked in order to make sure the packages in `sage_setup.autogen` and that autogenerated sources are placed in the sage sources before running its `setup.py install`.

#21480 inverts things somewhat by removing the old Makefile (really making it into a no-op for now), but pulling out the `sage_setup.autogen` stuff into a separate makefile that is still invoked by calling `make` from the `setup.py` (in the current version of that ticket it is even called unconditionally).  This is pretty non-standard.

The appropriate time to do this would be either just before the `build_py` command is run, or the `build_ext` command is run (in the case of autogenerated sources for extension modules).

In the current cases we have its very trivial to check whether or not any of the sources actually need to be regenerated, and this is a pretty normal thing to do in some other complex Python packages.  For example, the package responsible for generating the source files (e.g. currently the `sage_setup.autogen` sub-packages) simply needs to be responsible for knowing what its own source code files are, and knowing the paths for its generated sources--then just compare modtimes.  Invoking make is not required at all.

One can do even better by having one of the generated files be a hash of the source files, and compare the hashes instead (this avoids rebuilds when switching between git branches but where the files didn't otherwise change).

Could you make a ticket on top of #21480 (and probably #21604) that moves the invocation of `make  -f generate_py_source.mk` to the right place?

Determine directly in the Python code whether or not autogenerated sources need to be built, without requiring a makefile or anything.  I think this is simple and clear to anyone who looks at the code.

If in the future we want more full make-like capabilities I've got something in the works for that, but it seems unlikely that anything more complicated than this is needed any time soon.

On this ticket, [0394333](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/0394333a54e51c53b9404f248220a412cf13e00e) needs to be reverted, `generate_py_source` removed again from `MANIFEST.in`

(Of course, the manifest is out-of-date in many respects (#21516).)

Please don't do that.
setup.py needs to be able to run without SAGE_SRC set.

However, prior to this ticket the `setup.py` was depending on `SAGE_SRC` anyways, implicitly, through running Python from the makefile.

I could modify that code to only use `SAGE_SRC` if it is set, but that's not going to work because it *is* set to "/doesnotexist".  I could check explicitly for that path but that's rather ugly too.
