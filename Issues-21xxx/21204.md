If so, then you could reuse the guessing functionality in FriCAS.  Of course, FriCAS is not a standard package, although I think it should be, for many reasons.  In any case, the guessing package within is fast and well tested, and covers a lot of ground - essentially everything which is available for 1-dimensional guessing.  For example:

I've found in the book of Allouche and Shallit:

   "It is known that k-regular power series satisfy Mahler functional equations; see Rand ́e [1992], Dumas [1993a], and Becker [1994]."

so I believe the answer to your question is affirmative.

I didn't know about this feature of FriCAS, but looks good :)

Are there any plans to make FriCAS standard (I tried with `sage -i fricas`, but installation fails :(

You mean guessing the Mahler functional equation, right?

I think having this would be interesting and good. I am still not sure how exactly I would get the k-regular sequence out of it; I have to dig into this topic a bit further, I guess. (At the moment, I do not see directly, where the parameter k comes into play, as the FriCAS guessing works without this parameter.)
This is not my top priority at the moment (as the simple implementation of guessing of this ticket satisfies my needs and gives exactly the kind of representation I need.

As FriCAS is an optional package, I would guess, when having the interface you speak about, would be used as an alternative choice which guessing-algorithm was used. (Maybe even if FriCAS was a standard package...not sure at the moment...)

From what you can suggest by reading the above, I am not sure what the implications for this ticket are. However, having such a functionality of guessing the functional equation would definitely something nice to have in [SageMath](SageMath).

The current beta merges automatically and cleanly, so there is no difference on which branch to put it (as the patchbot runs it in the latest beta anyways). 

The reason for putting it on the latest stable is that this code is loosely related to a mathematical paper, so might be used by someone now and putting it on a stable version makes this using easier (as no beta needs to be compiled separately).

(And, the reason for merging in a newer version of [SageMath](SageMath) at all was a non-tivial merge conflict. If that would not have been, then it would still be 9.3.)

And merging the latest beta does not work any more, either.

<a id='comment:42'></a>I started reading this and have a lot of questions. I might then have to reread the code because I am not yet confident that I understand everything, so I apologise in advance if some further questions pop up at a later iteration.

While reading the code, I tried to make some notes on what the various routines are doing; I pushed those notes to branch `u/cheuberg/sequences/k-regular-guess-documentation`; after polishing those, it might be worthwhile to include these.
Due to my question 16 below, these notes might still require substantial rewrite (I am not sure about left/right).

1. `k_regular_sequence.value` in the docstring: the `\operator` does not yield the desired output in the HTML documentation.
2. `k_regular_sequence.split_interlace`: from the description, I do not understand what "split a digit into `p` parts" shall mean. Instead of the many examples (which might be moved to `TESTS`) I'd prefer to see fewer examples with an explanation what the output means. Perhaps "split into `p` parts" could be made explicit into saying that it will be expanded as a `k/p`-ary expansion? And also say that "value of the expansion" means expansion in base `k/p`?
3. `kRegularSequenceSpace.guess`: One-sentence description: perhaps "Guess a k-regular sequence whose first terms coincide with ..."?
4. `kRegularSequenceSpace.guess`: it is unclear to me what "bootstrapping this guessing" means.
5. `kRegularSequenceSpace.guess`: please use the "new" method `linear_representation` for all examples
6. `kRegularSequenceSpace.guess`: In the first example, it may be helpful to explain what "variant 1" and "variant 2" are (variant 1: without a bootstrapping sequence; variant 2: with the constant sequence as a bootstrapping sequence).
7. `kRegularSequenceSpace.guess`: I suggest to compare the outputs of Variant 1 and Variant 2 (that they yield the same sequence).
8. `kRegularSequenceSpace.guess`: it would be helpful to indicate the vector valued sequences used in the various examples (Sum of digits, variant 1: (s(n), s(2n+1)); variant 2: (1, s(n)), all natural numbers: (n, 2n+1), indicator function of even integers: ([n even], 1), indicator function of odd integers: )
9. `kRegularSequenceSpace.guess`: I suggest to rename all functions containing `linear_dependence` in their name to `linear_combination` (we are actually interested in the coefficients, not the existence of coefficients)
10. `kRegularSequenceSpace.guess`: I suggest to rename `guess_linear_dependence` to `linear_combination_candidate`: we are not guessing here, but we are deriving the only candidate and are checking it in the next step.
21. `kRegularSequenceSpace.guess`: I am surprised that `verify_linear_dependence` has `(n_max - r_L) // k**t_L + 1` as an upper bound for the loop. I think that the code does not guarantee that it will never evaluate `f` for some higher values than `n_max`, that might happen in `some_inverse_U_matrix`. On the other hand, something might be considered to be linearly dependent on the available functions while in truth it is not; this should not cause real problems.
32. `kRegularSequenceSpace.guess`: I do not understand the `if seq(0):` part: Why does it make a difference whether the zeroth element of the given sequence vanishes or not? I do not know whether it is related, but the following is not what I expect:
    {{{
sage: def s(k):
sage:     return k
sage: Seq2 = kRegularSequenceSpace(2, ZZ)
sage: S1 = Seq2.guess(s)
sage: S2 = Seq2.guess(s, sequence=S1)
sage: S1
2-regular sequence 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, ...
sage: S2
2-regular sequence 0, -2, -2, -6, -2, -6, -10, -14, -2, -6, ...
}}}
13. `kRegularSequenceSpace.guess`: I am surprised by `if t_R >= max_dimension:`: I thought that `max_dimension` will be the dimension of the matrices of the resulting regular sequence, but it seems to be the exponent? Shouldn't it be called like that in this case?
24. `kRegularSequenceSpace.guess`: I do not understand why the parameter s is actually stored into `lines`, I do not think it is ever used.
