Sage 7.3.beta8 is giving me a lot of errors of the form

```
[atlas-3.10.2.p2] cat: /usr/local/src/sage-config/local/bin/sage-banner: No such file or directory
```

The reason is that the file `local/bin/sage-banner` is installed at some point but it is always read by `sage-env`.

<a id='comment:6'>Comment 6:</a>
I would replace

```
    if [ -n "$banner_file" -a -f "$banner_file" ]; then
        cat "$banner_file"
    fi
```
by

```
    cat "$banner_file"
```
since we want to see an error message when we ask for the banner but it doesn't exist.
