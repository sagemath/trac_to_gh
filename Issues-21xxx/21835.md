Note : All these trials were made with #21782, now necessary on my Debian system using gcc 6.2.0.

The logs show that :
* without #21812, pip 8.x.y (our current version) advertising its new version creates spurious doctest failures.
* with #21812, pip 8.x.x solves this problem. **BUT**
* this log was obtained after a serial build of Sage ; a parallel build fails on Singular.
* Manually upgrading pip to 9.0.0 causes **different** spurious doctest failures, by pip advertising a deprecation of its previous format.
* These pip 9.0.0 deprecation warnings occur whether or not #21812 is installed.

I conclude that #21812
* is only a temporary fix,
* may be troublesome with some configurations.

I'm afraid that our current policy of "don't upgrade until absolutely necessary", while implementing a well-founded unease with novelty for novelty's sake, leads us to paint ourselves in unmaintainable corners.

In the present case, pip is now a cornerstone of python infrastructure.  Trying to maintain its old format exposes us to the risk of more and more Sage-specific pip-related patches, aggravating its maintenance burden. While not as serious as the python2-python3 divergence, that, IMHO, we considered way too late, the analogy is here.

I'd consider what is currently a booboo as an incentive to *fix* the problem, not to work around it.

Of course, you can also consider that pip, used to add new packages, is not useful for "a majority" of Sage users. You will have as much trouble convincing me that you have tryng to convince me that SSL support can be optional (you didn't succeed yet).

Culd you please consider this bug as a serious warning about our future maintenance burden ?
