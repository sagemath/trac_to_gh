The FriCAS interface is currently very rudimentary.  In particular, converting the results of a computation into sage types is available only in very few special cases.

Depends on #21209

1) implement a method that (reliably!) yields a tuple `(type, 1d algebra output, 2d algebra output, error message, etc)` as strings.  `1d algebra output` should come in "unparsed inputform" as one very long string, I'd say.  `2d algebra output` should be empty if 1d output is available.

It should be able to deal with very long lines, too, possibly be using file io.  This involves use of ioHook and some regexps.

2) implement a method that translates fricas output into sage types.

I think this could work as follows: we want to map fricas types to sage constructors, possibly recursively.  Recall that what's really sent to fricas is something like `"sage23 := [x<sup>n/y</sup>n for n in 1..3]"`, so that sage can access the result using the variable `"sage23"`.  This string is referred to as `self._name`

Now what I propose is a method which takes a parsed type, e.g., `"Integer"` or `("List", "Integer")` or 
`("UnivariatePolynomial", "x", ("Fraction", "Integer"))`

```
def to_sage(type):
    if type == "Integer":
         return to_sage_integer()
    elif type == "String":
         return to_sage_string()
    ...
    elif isinstance(type, tuple):
        if type[0] == "List":
            return to_sage_list(type[1])
        elif type[0] == "Fraction":
            return to_sage_fraction(type[1])
        ....
```

and so on.

So, if the type is `("List" ("Fraction" ("UnivariatePolynomial" "x" "Integer")))`, this method would call

```
    to_sage_list(("Fraction" ("UnivariatePolynomial" "x" "Integer"))
```

which might be something like

```
def to_sage_list(self, type):
    n = fricas.eval("#" + self._name).to_sage_integer()
    return [fricas.eval(self._name + ".%n").to_sage(type) for n in range(1,n+1)]
```

<a id='comment:15'>Comment 15:</a>
I have a question about the `_fricas_init_` and `_fricas_` methods
defined in various files, in particular in
`~/sage-develop/src/sage/rings/rational_field.py` and `in
~/sage-develop/src/sage/rings/real_mpfr.pyx`, see below.

The question is: the doctests work without adapting the methods.
What are the methods supposed to do?

`~/sage-develop/src/sage/rings/rational_field.py`

```
    def _axiom_init_(self):
        r"""
        Return the axiom/fricas representation of `\QQ`.

        EXAMPLES::

           sage: axiom(QQ)    #optional - axiom # indirect doctest
           Fraction Integer
           sage: fricas(QQ)   #optional - fricas # indirect doctest
           Fraction(Integer)

        """
        return 'Fraction Integer'

    _fricas_init_ = _axiom_init_
```



in `~/sage-develop/src/sage/rings/real_mpfr.pyx`

```
    def _axiom_(self, axiom):
        """

            3.1415926535897932384626433833
            sage: axiom(R(pi))  # optional - axiom # indirect doctest
            3.1415926535 8979323846 26433833
            sage: fricas(R(pi)) # optional - fricas

        prec = self.parent().prec()

        #Set the precision in Axiom
        old_prec = axiom('precision(%s)$Float'%prec)
        res = axiom('%s :: Float'%self.exact_rational())

Calling `fricas("something stupid")` ends up in `fricas.set` which calls `expect._eval_line` not `fricas.eval`.  This interface stuff is truly twisted. Check especially the inheritance.  `FriCAS` inherits from `Expect` that inherits `Interface`. Check `__call__` and `_create` in `Interface` and go from there.

`fricas.py` should probably override `_eval_line` in the same way as `axiom.py`.

I am not sure of the relevance of the particular substitutions that were performed by the old `axiom.py` code.

Sorry for just including a patch but I am not sure whether or not I could have just pushed this change to trac since this branch seems to be private.

FriCAS uses

```
sage: fricas('asin(x)')
asin(x)
sage: fricas('acos(x)')
acos(x)
sage: fricas('atan(x)')
atan(x)
```

Sage replaces `asin`, `acos` and `atan` with `arcsin`, `arccos` and `arctan`

```
sage: asin(x)
arcsin(x)
sage: acos(x)
arccos(x)
sage: atan(x)
arctan(x)
```

But FriCAS does not use these names so the following results in an error:

```

...

Removing `|startKeyedMsg|` and `|endOfKeyedMsg|` and the like is not completely trivial, but I'll try!

Thanks, Martin. Here is a small patch that fixes a few problems with FriCAS-generated LaTeX. For example:

```
sage: latex(fricas("integrate(sin(x+1/x),x)"))
 \int ^{\displaystyle x} {{\sin  \left( {{{{{ \%A} ^{2}}+1} \over \%A}}  \right)} \  {d \%A}}   

```

and also subscripts and subscripts in a few other cases.

Hi Bill,

I don't understand your patch: why would you replace `\sp{` by `^{` if you replace `\sp` by `^` anyway.  Also, isn't `\sp` valid LaTeX?

But more importantly: shouldn't this patch really applied to FriCAS itself?

But maybe you really want mathjax or even 1d output of FriCAS objects, then look into
mathjax.spad or 1d.spad. Most importantly, the output form can be changed at runtime.

Note that these files are GPL3+ and are therefore not (yet) part of FriCAS.

Note the space `'\sp '`. It is looking for termination of `\sp`.

Not as far as I know - maybe TeX?  In any case it does not work in Sage notebook.

Perhaps.  Waldek would probably accept a patch to that effect.

I think Waldek is unlikely to change his position on the exclusion of copyleft licensed code in FriCAS since FriCAS already has a more permissive license. Of course that does not prevent its inclusion in the FriCAS external package here if someone were so inclined.

I wanted to avoid overriding `eval` and `_eval_line` because they do not have much description, so their expected behaviour is not completely clear to me.

The easy thing would be to have another option `reformat=True`, which sets `|$ioHook|` to `nil`, and call `eval` with `reformat=False` always...

There is actually an easy way to achieve what you want:
First say:

```
fricas._eval_using_file_cutoff=30
```
(I don't know what a good value is.  Don't make it 0 or 1.)
and then:

```
%fricas
for i in 100000..100010 repeat
  if i<5 then
    output i
  else
    output partition(i+1)
```

Note however, that the result will not be displayed one by one, but only after the full thing is finished.  I hate that.

Nice!  In fact

```
fricas._eval_using_file_cutoff=1
```
seems to work for me.  Did you have a problem setting it to 1?

I could be happy with just such a flag option, especially if it was a bit more obvious like:

```
fricas.inputFormat(true)
```
But why not make it the default? Would you expect a serious performance issue?

Of course, but this is not a problem in one of the most important uses: defining a long function.

Not sure yet, especially about the user interface.

Yes.

In case you have time there are two major things that remain to be done (on separate tickets):

* find out how Waldek's fricas-as-library works.

* find out how to make `fricas._eval_line` and `fricas.eval` print stuff they receive immediately, until a special marker is encountered.  (We can control the special marker via `|$ioHook|`, but for the moment let's pretend it is `|startAlgebraOutput|`.  To be honest, I don't even know whether this is possible.

I don't want to modify this ticket much further, unless the patchbot requires me to do so, to have it merged soon.

Thanks, fixed.  I'm very sorry, but my git-foo is very weak, so there are some commits in the branch which do not belong.

If there is an easy way to get rid of them, please let me know...  They are:

```
​43c1136	Exclude plain text from IPython super call
​b027498	Merge branch 'u/vbraun/call_repr_once' of git://trac.sagemath.org/sage into develop

​1347786	Add jump_number() to posets.
​3e6ef52	<tab> to spaces.
​fe815c8	Merge branch 'u/jmantysalo/jump_number' of git://trac.sagemath.org/sage into fricas-interface
​aa04d96	Add algorithm-keyword to canonical labeling of posets.
​d923dc1	Merge branch 'u/jmantysalo/posets__add_algorithm_keyword_to_canonical_relabel__' of git://trac.sagemath.org/sage into fricas-interface


​92378ca	Fix for sage shell with TERM=dumb
​fc0b081	Merge branch 'u/mkoeppe/sage_mode_for_emacs_has_display_problem_in_sage_7_4_beta0' of git://trac.sagemath.org/sage into fricas-interface
```

Or should I just create a new branch and copy the good stuff into that new branch?

There is something strange about the way FriCAS matrices are being typeset.


```
sage: latex(fricas("matrix([[1,2],[3,4]])"))
 {\left[ 1, \: 2  \right]} \  {\left[ 3, \: 4  \right]} 
```
but

```
sage: fricas("matrix([[1,2],[3,4]])::TEX")
["$$", "\left[", "\begin{array}{cc}", "1 & 2 \\ ", "3 & 4 ", "\end{array}",
 "\right]", "$$"]
```
However in other cases it looks normal. For example:

```
sage: latex(fricas("integrate(sin(x/(1+sqrt(x))),x)"))
 \int ^{\displaystyle x} {{\sin  \left( {{ \%A \over {{\sqrt { \%A}}+1}}}  \right)} \  {d \%A}}   

sage: fricas("integrate(sin(x/(1+sqrt(x))),x)::TEX")
["$$", "\int \sp{\displaystyle x} {{\sin ", "\left(",
 "{{ \%A \over {{\sqrt { \%A}}+1}}} ", "\right)}", "\  {d \%A}} ", "$$"]
```

I am using `outputAsTex`.  Should I use `::TEX` instead?

I am perplexed that `outputAsTex` does not produce the same thing as `::TEX`. I was not aware of that. Perhaps this should be reported as a bug in FriCAS? In any case it seems that the FriCAS command:

```
)set output tex on
```
uses the latter method.

```
(1) -> outputAsTex matrix [[1,2],[3,4]]
$$
{\left[ 1, \: 2 
\right]}
\  {\left[ 3, \: 4 
\right]}
\leqno(1)
$$

                                                                   Type: Void
(2) -> matrix([[1,2],[3,4]])::TEX

   (2)
   ["$$", "\left[", "\begin{array}{cc}", "1 & 2 \\ ", "3 & 4 ", "\end{array}",
    "\right]", "$$"]
                                                              Type: TexFormat
(3) -> )set output tex on
(3) -> matrix([[1,2],[3,4]])     

        +1  2+
   (3)  |    |
        +3  4+
$$
\left[
\begin{array}{cc}
1 & 2 \\

\end{array}
\right]
\leqno(3)

                                                        Type: Matrix(Integer)

I think it is reasonable to expect that typeset mode with the FriCAS interface would produce the same result.

Thanks for the update. The output of

    sage: latex(fricas("matrix([[1,2],[3,4]])"))
    \left[ \begin{array}{cc} 1 & 2 \\ 3 & 4 \end{array}  \right]

now looks good but ...

In

    sage --notebook

the output from a cell beginning with

    %fricas

is no longer being typeset even though the `[x]Typeset` option is checked.

You should not use a bare `except:` (see the end of `src/sage/symbolic/integration/external.py`). Moreover, I would suggest to replace

```
     try:
        return result.sage()
     except:
        raise ValueError("Unable to parse: {}".format(result))
```
by

```
return result.sage()
```
