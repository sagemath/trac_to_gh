<a id='comment:1'></a>1) implement a method that (reliably!) yields a tuple `(type, 1d algebra output, 2d algebra output, error message, etc)` as strings.  `1d algebra output` should come in "unparsed inputform" as one very long string, I'd say.  `2d algebra output` should be empty if 1d output is available.

It should be able to deal with very long lines, too, possibly be using file io.  This involves use of ioHook and some regexps.

2) implement a method that translates fricas output into sage types.

I think this could work as follows: we want to map fricas types to sage constructors, possibly recursively.  Recall that what's really sent to fricas is something like `"sage23 := [x<sup>n/y</sup>n for n in 1..3]"`, so that sage can access the result using the variable `"sage23"`.  This string is referred to as `self._name`

Now what I propose is a method which takes a parsed type, e.g., `"Integer"` or `("List", "Integer")` or 
`("UnivariatePolynomial", "x", ("Fraction", "Integer"))`

```
def to_sage(type):
    if type == "Integer":
         return to_sage_integer()
    elif type == "String":
         return to_sage_string()
    ...
    elif isinstance(type, tuple):
        if type[0] == "List":
            return to_sage_list(type[1])
        elif type[0] == "Fraction":
            return to_sage_fraction(type[1])
        ....
```

and so on.

So, if the type is `("List" ("Fraction" ("UnivariatePolynomial" "x" "Integer")))`, this method would call

```
    to_sage_list(("Fraction" ("UnivariatePolynomial" "x" "Integer"))
```

which might be something like

```
def to_sage_list(self, type):
    n = fricas.eval("#" + self._name).to_sage_integer()
    return [fricas.eval(self._name + ".%n").to_sage(type) for n in range(1,n+1)]
```

<a id='comment:15'></a>I have a question about the `_fricas_init_` and `_fricas_` methods
defined in various files, in particular in
`~/sage-develop/src/sage/rings/rational_field.py` and `in
~/sage-develop/src/sage/rings/real_mpfr.pyx`, see below.

The question is: the doctests work without adapting the methods.
What are the methods supposed to do?

`~/sage-develop/src/sage/rings/rational_field.py`

```

           sage: fricas(QQ)   #optional - fricas # indirect doctest
           Fraction(Integer)

        """
        return 'Fraction Integer'

    _fricas_init_ = _axiom_init_

I am not sure of the relevance of the particular substitutions that were performed by the old `axiom.py` code.

Sorry for just including a patch but I am not sure whether or not I could have just pushed this change to trac since this branch seems to be private.

```

```
sage: asin(x)

Note the space `'\sp '`. It is looking for termination of `\sp`.

Not as far as I know - maybe TeX?  In any case it does not work in Sage notebook.

Perhaps.  Waldek would probably accept a patch to that effect.

<a id='comment:56'></a>There is actually an easy way to achieve what you want:
First say:

```
fricas._eval_using_file_cutoff=30
```
(I don't know what a good value is.  Don't make it 0 or 1.)
and then:

```
%fricas
for i in 100000..100010 repeat
  if i<5 then
    output i
  else
    output partition(i+1)
```

Note however, that the result will not be displayed one by one, but only after the full thing is finished.  I hate that.

Nice!  In fact

```
fricas._eval_using_file_cutoff=1
```
seems to work for me.  Did you have a problem setting it to 1?

I could be happy with just such a flag option, especially if it was a bit more obvious like:

```
fricas.inputFormat(true)
```
But why not make it the default? Would you expect a serious performance issue?

Of course, but this is not a problem in one of the most important uses: defining a long function.

Yes, but that might have been noise.

Not sure yet, especially about the user interface.

Yes.

In case you have time there are two major things that remain to be done (on separate tickets):

* find out how Waldek's fricas-as-library works.

* find out how to make `fricas._eval_line` and `fricas.eval` print stuff they receive immediately, until a special marker is encountered.  (We can control the special marker via `|$ioHook|`, but for the moment let's pretend it is `|startAlgebraOutput|`.  To be honest, I don't even know whether this is possible.

I don't want to modify this ticket much further, unless the patchbot requires me to do so, to have it merged soon.

<a id='comment:67'></a>Thanks, fixed.  I'm very sorry, but my git-foo is very weak, so there are some commits in the branch which do not belong.

If there is an easy way to get rid of them, please let me know...  They are:

```
​43c1136	Exclude plain text from IPython super call
​b027498	Merge branch 'u/vbraun/call_repr_once' of git://trac.sagemath.org/sage into develop

​1347786	Add jump_number() to posets.
​3e6ef52	<tab> to spaces.
​fe815c8	Merge branch 'u/jmantysalo/jump_number' of git://trac.sagemath.org/sage into fricas-interface
​aa04d96	Add algorithm-keyword to canonical labeling of posets.
​d923dc1	Merge branch 'u/jmantysalo/posets__add_algorithm_keyword_to_canonical_relabel__' of git://trac.sagemath.org/sage into fricas-interface


​92378ca	Fix for sage shell with TERM=dumb
​fc0b081	Merge branch 'u/mkoeppe/sage_mode_for_emacs_has_display_problem_in_sage_7_4_beta0' of git://trac.sagemath.org/sage into fricas-interface
```

Or should I just create a new branch and copy the good stuff into that new branch?

<a id='comment:81'></a>Thanks for the update. The output of

    sage: latex(fricas("matrix([[1,2],[3,4]])"))
    \left[ \begin{array}{cc} 1 & 2 \\ 3 & 4 \end{array}  \right]

now looks good but ...

In

    sage --notebook

the output from a cell beginning with

    %fricas

is no longer being typeset even though the `[x]Typeset` option is checked.
