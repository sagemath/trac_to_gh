sequel of #21296 and #21304

with an eye towards python3 compatibility

when iterating over a dict, one does not need to call .keys()

and when asking for the list of keys, it is better to call list(d) for compatibility with py3

Removing .keys() when possible is performed in some files in combinat folder

<a id='comment:2'></a>Two stupid things. You made a PEP8 change which made me notice that while-we-are-at-it^(TM), could you make this change:

```diff
-        if len(positions) == 0:
+        if not positions:
```
Also, in `CyclicSievingPolynomial`, you can replace `keys` by `orbit_sizes`.
