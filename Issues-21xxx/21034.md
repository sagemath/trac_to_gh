How did you "pull in" the changes? BTW, if you do `git trac checkout 21034` you will always get the Sage version of the branch in 21034, regardless of your develop. Also a hint: `make start` will skip building the expensive step of building the docs.

You should also download the pynac tarball and copy it into `upstream/` before making.

<a id='comment:13'></a>Sorry Ralf, but still getting the error. Curiously even though it references "sagelib-7.3.beta5.log" this file hasn't been modified building either beta8 or beta9.

Before you ask, 7.3.beta9 develop also compiles cleanly on Mac OS X El Capitan.

Looking back to the pynac 0.6.7 upgrade, there is a [comment](https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/20742#comment:11) from Travis that looks relevant. This prompted me to see which beta included 0.6.7 and sure enough it was beta5.

I'll be the first to admit knowing nothing about building tarballs, but are you sure there isn't a problem there? The tarball for 0.6.8 isn't downloading automatically to the `upstream` folder.
