... this is so that it does not have to rely on downloading the generated files, nor on an external installation of the autotools (which is convenient on Mac OS X because one has to remove fink from PATH).

This patch sources `src/bin/sage-env` in order to augment PATH just before calling the autotools.

Depends on #21047
