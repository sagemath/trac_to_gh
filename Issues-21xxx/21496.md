This is a merge of this project: https://github.com/williamstein/sage_modabvar

Most of the code is checked against Magma. Here's a SMC worksheet checking most of the doctest examples: https://cloud.sagemath.com/projects/0d310a14-a099-47d9-87c7-df6b63af54a6/files/worksheets/magma_test_examples.sagews

The methods that aren't covered in the worksheet are:
* `is_J0`, `is_J1`: they're really short
* `elliptic_curve`: this checks that the newforms agree for conductor up to 50: `all([S.newform(names='a') == S.elliptic_curve().newform() for N in [1..50] for S in J0(N) if S.dimension() == 1])`
* An algorithm for computing the divisor of order of the rational torsion subgroup is known in the J1(p) case. It is also conjecturally the order of the rational torsion subgroup. This is cover in this paper: http://math.stanford.edu/~conrad/papers/j1p.pdf and the code has been checked against the table in pg. 393.
* `newform_decomposition`: This checks it against another way of computing it:

  `all([J0(N).newform_decomposition('a') == [S.newform('a') for S in J0(N)] for N in [1..50]])`

  `all([J1(N).newform_decomposition('a') == [S.newform('a') for S in J1(N)] for N in [1..30]])`
