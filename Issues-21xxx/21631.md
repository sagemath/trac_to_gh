At the time of cleaning up, it seems we end up with a ring set to NULL and call p_Delete with that at

Didn't find out yet what changed.
Hopefully I'll be successfull tomorrow.

Still issues with matrix ordering...
Maybe my comment here:
* #17254#comment:157
Was not so wrong.
But there is also

and

Looks like both issues about "local/mixed" and total degree are related to this commit:
* https://github.com/Singular/Sources/commit/45f4b2d83e0b667a78f6a5d22c428bf88f28fca7
and commits following it.
Now the `p_WTotalDegree` function gives negative results so the Sage hackish code returns `-1`.

In fact we now end up in a "very bad" block because of the matrix entries set to `0`:
* https://github.com/Singular/Sources/commit/0d91221c4a45f7a2621d280d09e628b3e963a60d#diff-d09c8493af07f5c7209a8ad3ce8842feR3826

+            nonneg++;
+            found=1;
+          }
```
which leads to `OrdSgn = -1` (and `MixedOrd = 1`) whereas before we had `OrdSgn = -1`.

Not sure what should happen when matrix ordering has zeros inside.

If the first nonzero element in each column is positive, the ordering is global. From the comments, it says they look at "other blocks." I don't remember offhand how wvhdl works in this case (not sure I ever knew) but it's not clear to me they're looking further down the column than the first row. If not, that would be a bug.

What is sure is that in the case

```
            sage: tord = TermOrder(matrix([3,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0]))
```
singular gets a `OrdSgn = -1` now.

And I get

```
sage: tord=TermOrder(matrix([3,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0]))
sage: R.<x,y,z> = PolynomialRing(QQ,3,order=tord)
sage: x.parent()._singular_()
