This ticket allows a `$SAGE_LOCAL` directory different from `$SAGE_ROOT/local`.

The idea is that #21479 would set `$SAGE_LOCAL` to the `--prefix` chosen by the user.

that seems to make sense. but it's dangerous really. SAGE_LOCAL is an internal directory and an implementation detail currently.

if you expose this, users will start expecting stuff in SAGE_LOCAL created by the build process. an ideal build process does not (will not/should not) use SAGE_LOCAL. any transition to fixing this will heavily interfere with user experience (only if they override SAGE_LOCAL, of course).

ok, now i explained why "set prefix==SAGE_LOCAL" is probably not a good idea. and here, an alternative, "expose SAGE_LOCAL", appears to be much worse... hmm

there's a problem here. can you please give some more insight on what you are trying to achieve with the customized SAGE_LOCAL?

thanks

I am not changing that. I still consider it an implementation detail.

I am allowing Sage to be installed in a custom directory, which is not `$SAGE_ROOT/local`.

SAGE_LOCAL cannot be the installation directory *and* an implementation detail.

but you seem to have your own definition for both these terms, rendering this discussion pointless.

The current reality is that `$SAGE_LOCAL` is the installation directory and an implementation detail. So I am really not changing that.

you put "Allow SAGE_LOCAL to be customized" into the title. this (to me) implies that SAGE_LOCAL would become a user controlled variable (see above). i hope not! but is it really your intent?

i figured, that maybe/actually/hopefully you want to introduce prefix (defaulting to $(builddir)/local), then set SAGE_LOCAL=prefix. then do some modifications so the rest of dist can cope with it.

about the title... what about "implement pretend-prefix using SAGE_LOCAL" or "use SAGE_LOCAL to implement pretend-prefix"? (yes, "pretend", because it will look like prefix to the user, while the build process will still write to it).

My idea is that this ticket simply allows `SAGE_LOCAL` to be set to a different directory and that #21479 implements the `./configure` logic to automatically set `SAGE_LOCAL` to the `--prefix` given.

It seems a bit unusual, I don't think there's such a thing as a tmp directory other than `/tmp` or more precisely, whatever `mktemp(1)` provides.

But I don't insist. It's just a maintenance script for autotools, after all.
