I have been editing attached files with vim and it usually reloads the files with no issues.  Occasionally the file will not reload and needs to be manually reattached, I have not been able to figure out how to reproduce this bug.  I have now found a new and more serious issue: this time when the file detached, it disappeared from SAGE's knowledge of the file system and SAGE crashed completely.  I do not know what I did differently to cause this crash, I am attaching the crash report.

Seems to be related to this [sage-devel discussion](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/KZ-eiUNS2jg/uB3oM0eFLwAJ) from September 2015 where few solutions were provided including

```
:set backupcopy=yes 
```

which I am using in my vimrc file ever since.
