<a id='comment:22'></a>This presumably broke `sage_mode` (cf. [this post on sage-devel](http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.mathematics.sage.devel/88271)).

And this also seems related:

```
After the update, on exit from Sage I get

Exiting Sage (CPU time 0m0.17s, Wall time 0m44.15s).
:0: UserWarning: You do not have a working installation of the service_identity module: 'No module named service_identity'.  Please install it from <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/service_identity> and make sure all of its dependencies are satisfied.  Without the service_identity module and a recent enough pyOpenSSL to support it, Twisted can perform only rudimentary TLS client hostname verification.  Many valid certificate/hostname mappings may be rejected.

After doing "sage --pip install service_identity"
this warning goes away.

Any idea what happens here?
