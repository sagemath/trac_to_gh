This is a follow up to #17254 which upgraded to singular 4:

* debug (with xalloc) build on OS X (om_Info gets undefined (U) in Singular, note that it is ok on linux (B), maybe depends on ocmpiler, linker vesions)
* failing test in debug mode

<div id="comment:11" align="right">Comment 11</div>

the last issue ( "no minpoly allowed..") can be fixed with

https://github.com/Singular/Sources/pull/814
(avoids intermediate object between ring declaration and minpoly definition in 'normal.lib')

Did you get answers from Hans for the other issues?
Or, could you track them down?

Those like this were still present last time I checked and those about stuff not being where it belongs through kTest_L and kTest_TS as mentioned here:

No feedback from Hans and I had no time to look at it.

I just reminded Hans kindly to look at that issue since it is
a blocker ticket for sage.

https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/libsingular-devel/TPZNlvZXei0/CptSq0fdAgAJ

Let's see if something happens.
