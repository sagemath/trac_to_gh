Polynomial.reverse(d) over ℚ is inconsistent with the generic implementation. The name of the optional argument is different, and its interpretation is slightly different:

```
sage: x = polygen(QQ)
sage: y = polygen(QQbar)
sage: (x+1).reverse(1)
1
sage: (y+1).reverse(1)
x + 1
```

In addition, the documentation of the generic `reverse()` (which arguably should *specify* what `reverse()` is supposed to do for sage polynomials) incorrectly states that “the reverse polynomial will have the specified degree”:

```
sage: (y^2).reverse(5)
x^3
```

Finally, the generic implementation is buggy when the optional argument is zero.
