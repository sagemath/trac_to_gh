Probably can just return Integer(0)

I use this braces notation myself, but I can imagine that it's not universally used, and some people may prefer `\mathop{\mathrm{frac}}(x)`.  Perhaps a global option?

I retract this comment. I didn't realize `int()` makes Python bignums.

<a id='comment:10'></a>Looks good to me.

For full symbolic functionality (which I never use), I guess one would need to tie this in with the simplification and assumptions machinery, so that things like this behave better:

```
sage: simplify(frac(frac(x)))
frac(frac(x))
sage: simplify(frac(floor(x)))
frac(floor(x))
sage: assume(x, 'integer')
sage: simplify(frac(x))
frac(x)
```
Perhaps on a follow-up ticket?
