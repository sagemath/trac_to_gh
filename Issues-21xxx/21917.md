Here are some comments:

1. `INPUT:` is missing

2. No empty line is needed between input items.

3. You should describe the type of the input:

```
- ``n`` -- integer, number of nodes of the graph
```

4. There *must* be `EXAMPLES::`. There can be also some `TESTS::`. I suggest to keep the limit cases inside a TEST block:

```
            sage: hypergraphs.RandomBinomialUniform(50, 3, 1).num_blocks()
            19600
            sage: hypergraphs.RandomBinomialUniform(50, 3, 0).num_blocks()
            0
```

and the one with `p=0.2` inside the `EXAMPLE` block without the call to that other `numblock` method.

```
sage: hypergraphs.RandomBinomialUniform(50, 3, 0.2)
Incidence structure with 50 points and 3915 blocks 
```

5. I think that the line `sage: set_random_seed(0)` is not necessary because the doctest framework already set the random seed so that random doctest always return the same thing...

6. Is the `seed` input only there for doctests reason? Or do you expect a human user to need this? If not, I would suggest to remove this input to the function. Also not that you can add `# random` at the end of a `sage:` line in doctests so that it only tests that no error are produced. See http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#section-further-conventions

7. In fact, I would remove `num_blocks()` everywhere in the examples. When we quickly look, we think that this methods return a integer...

8. I would suggest that you read the section http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#documentation-strings. Normally, everything that I said is explained there.

9. `(default=None)` -> <code>(default: \`None\`)</code>, in case you keep the seed input

Hello,

I do not understand what you are doing with the `seed` variable in your code... it is set but never used! Manipulating the random state should not be part of your function. There are Sage functions for that purpose.

This is very inefficient if p is small

```
edges = [e for e in combinations(range(n), k) if random() < p]
```
You need to use another approach...

The cardinality of your "edge space" is binomial(n,k). What you want to do is basically pick a binomial random variable B(binomial(n,k), p) and then pick that number of sets. This can be done as follows

```
sage: S = Subsets(range(50), 5)
sage: sample(S, 10)
[{34, 38, 5, 30, 21},
 {16, 1, 35, 5, 45},
 {34, 3, 4, 5, 15},
 {9, 2, 5, 6, 47},
 {35, 20, 37, 22, 15},
 {0, 17, 42, 12, 45},
 {8, 24, 19, 13, 22},
 {36, 42, 28, 5, 29},
 {48, 17, 49, 33, 7},
 {1, 39, 29, 43, 9}]
```
Hence you just need to generate a random number distributed with binomial distribution.

`sample` yields an `OverflowError`:

```python
sage: n = 10000
sage: p = 1/n
sage: k = 17
sage: sample(Subsets(range(n), k), binomial(n, p))
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<ipython-input-57-6d20b3bde428>", line 1, in <module>
    sample(Subsets(range(n), k), binomial(n, p))
  File "/usr/lib/sagemath/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/misc/prandom.py", line 178, in sample
    return _pyrand().sample(population, k)
  File "/usr/lib/sagemath/local/lib/python/random.py", line 321, in sample
    n = len(population)
OverflowError: Python int too large to convert to C long
```

I am also quite worried about the fact that `numpy` probably converts `p` into a float. Not sure it should matter much, but still...

(this was tested in Sage 7.3... until I'll build 7.5beta3 properly)

I confirm the behavior on the latest beta (7.5.beta4). I don't think the conversion to float by numpy matters.

On the other hand, as we discussed in Jerusalem it would actually be simpler to have two methods:
* one for GNM (not needing binomial)
* one for GNP (that calls GNM with appropriate parameters)

I'm also in favor of having GNM and GNP like methods.

In above example, you use `binomial(n, p)` with `p=1/k`. If p is a float, then `binomial` will raise `TypeError: either m or x-m must be an integer`.
You may try this instead `sample(Subsets(range(n), k), randint(0,binomial(n, k)))`.


Obviously, the main limitation for the maximum size of a random uniform hypergraph is not what `range` can handle but the memory of your computer. `1e9` should already be beyond what you can do.

David.

OK, so this is my plan for the uniform model:

```python
        if m < 0:
            raise ValueError("Number of edges must be nonnegative.")

        from sage.combinat.subset import Subsets
        all_edges = Subsets(n, k)
        max_points = len(all_edges)
        if m > max_points:
            raise ValueError("Number of edges may not exceed {}".format(
                max_points))

        from sage.misc.prandom import sample

        try:
            edges = sample(all_edges, m)

        except OverflowError:
            from sys import maxint
            from sage.functions.other import binomial

            if binomial(n, k) > maxint:
                raise OverflowError("binomial(n, k) may not exceed {}".format(
                    maxint))

            raise

        from sage.combinat.designs.incidence_structures import IncidenceStructure
        return IncidenceStructure(edges)
```

Now, for the binomial model, which function do you think I should use?

1. Import `numpy.random.binomial`, or
2. Implement `binomial` in `sage.misc.prandom` (either as a call to numpy, or copying code from numpy? I think it is implemented in C in numpy...)

I would actually regroup and simplify the errors (and please in the error message start with lower case and no ponctuation at the end)

```python
from sage.combinat.subset import Subsets
from sage.misc.prandom import sample
all_edges = Subsets(n, k)
try:
    edges = sample(all_edges, m)
except OverflowError:
    raise OverflowError("binomial({},{}) too large to be treated".format(n,k))
except ValueError:
    raise ValueError("number of edges m must between 0 and binomial({},{})".format(n,k))

from sage.combinat.designs.incidence_structures import IncidenceStructure
return IncidenceStructure(edges)
```
I don't think that the overflow in `sample` has to do with the second argument... It is raised (indirectly) in your example by

```
sage: len(Subsets(range(10000), 17))
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
OverflowError: Python int too large to convert to C long
```

The problem by this implementation is that it creates a hypergraph without the isolated vertices.  This is easy to fix, I'm on it.

`Retrun` -> `Return`

in method, `BinomialRandomUniform`, shouldn't you ensure that `m = nrn.binomial(binomial(n, k), p)` can be done / that it's not too large? or is it handled in `UniformRandomUniform` ?

The `TESTS` block is in fact a `EXAMPLES` block.

What if `n` or `k` or `n` are values `<= 0`? You may need specific tests for theses cases.

Thanks, will fix.

Indeed, for large inputs there's some weird issue in numpy I can't really understand at the moment:

```
sage: nrn.binomial(binomial(10000, 7), 0.1)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-6-d91f2b509dee> in <module>()
----> 1 nrn.binomial(binomial(Integer(10000), Integer(7)), RealNumber('0.1'))

mtrand.pyx in mtrand.RandomState.binomial()

TypeError: Cannot cast array data from dtype('O') to dtype('int64') according to the rule 'safe'
```

> The `TESTS` block is in fact a `EXAMPLES` block.

Ok.

> What if `n` or `k` or `n` are values `<= 0`? You may need specific tests for theses cases.

Will do.
