Just like `setuptools` (#13201), `pkg_resources` (vendored by `pip` or stand-alone) has race conditions when building in parallel.

**First race condition:**

```
The same error can also happen in the non-vendored `pkg_resources` package, which is part of `setuptools`.

**Second race condition:**

Some vendored packages inside `pip` conditionally import certain packages. One example from `local/lib/python/site-packages/pip/_vendor/requests/certs.py`:

```python
try:
    from certifi import where
except ImportError:
    def where():
        """Return the preferred certificate bundle."""
        # vendored bundle inside Requests
        return os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), 'cacert.pem')
```
This is bad because it can happen that we are (un)installing `certify` while running a different instance of `pip`.

**Third race condition:**
The file `local/bin/pip` contains the line

```
from pkg_resources import load_entry_point
```
It turns out that `pkg_resources` actually imports the packages `zope` and `mpl_toolkit` (from matplotlib) due to these packages having `.pth` files. This is again a race condition.

**Note:** it seems that these race conditions only happen while *uninstalling* a package.

OK, I needed a few iterations to get this right. But now it seems to work.

The way I tested this:

1. Build `sage-7.4.beta2` (the last version before #20218).

2. Build `sage-7.4.beta6` (the last version before #21441).

3. Build this branch with lots of processes.

`pip` (indirectly) imports various Python packages. Sometimes it can happen that one `pip` instance imports a package while a different `pip` instance uninstalls that package. This is obviously problematic.

Regarding the last comment, this kind of code is problematic (example taken from `local/lib/python/site-packages/pip/_vendor/requests/certs.py`):

```python
try:
    from certifi import where
except ImportError:
    def where():
        """Return the preferred certificate bundle."""
        # vendored bundle inside Requests
        return os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), 'cacert.pem')
```

It is possible that one `pip` instance runs `from certifi import where` while another `pip` instance uninstalls `certifi` at the same time.

Right--my problem with this approach to fixing it is that I don't think pip was meant to run in parallel at all--much less when it's also uninstalling things.

Sprinkling the code with ignored `OSError`s in various places is probably not a solution that will be accepted upstream, where one would instead want more careful design to allow parallel execution in a consistent manner.

That said, if this works around the issue for our purposes for now I'm fine with it.  The only thing I might change (but maybe it doesn't matter?) is to make a few of those try/excepts a little more localized--specifically just right around the `find_egg_in_zip` calls.

To solve this issue, I see 3 posssible solutions:

1. Ensure that `sys.path` only contains the Python standard library directories (in particular, not `site-packages`) while running `pip`.

2. Change the vendored code inside `pip` to not import any non-vendored libraries. For example, the code from [comment:20] could be changed to just define `def where()` unconditionally.

3. Implement a locking mechanism while running `pip` (which would immediately solve all race conditions with `pip` but would slow down a parallel build).

Erik, what is your opinion?

Looking at some `strace` outputs, `pkg_resources` is totally crazy.

When doing `import pkg_resources`, it attempts to open the file `/usr/local/src/sage-git/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/zope.py` 81 times (failing 81 times).

Similarly, it tries to open `/usr/local/src/sage-git/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/mpl_toolkits.py` 45 times (failing 45 times).

I guess this is related to the fact that these define special `.pth` files:

```
$ ls -l local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/*.pth
-rw-r--r-- 1 jdemeyer jdemeyer 314 Oct 12 12:23 local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/configparser-3.5.0-py2.7-nspkg.pth

+It turns out that `pkg_resources` actually imports the packages `zope` and `mpl_toolkit` (from matplotlib) due to these packages having `.pth` files. This is again a race condition.
 
 **Note:** it seems that these race conditions only happen while *uninstalling* a package.

Three things:

1) If we want to implement the locking mechanism in Python (makes sense to me) might as
well reimplement `sage-pip-install` in its entirety in Python, rather than add yet another script.  This would further the (ideal, to me) goal of having fewer shell scripts, and would be less confusing.

2) As implemented this is not at all portable, and of course portable file-locking is hard to get right.  I propose that we vendor the [fasteners](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/fasteners) module which already provides a more portable and well-tested file lock.

3) I would suggest implementing a reader/writer-like lock to allow multiple `pip installs` to run simultaneously, and only prevent other `pip`s from running during a `pip uninstall`.

Since I have experience with the fasteners module I can take that over if you want.
