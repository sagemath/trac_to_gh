Constructing Hecke operators acting on modular symbols can blow up the memory usage, though it doesn't have to. The eclib code has sparse and dense options for generating Hecke operators, but the sage caller only calls the dense options. The simple solution is to modify the sage caller to add a flag which specifies to use the sparse options: perhaps a better solution would be to intuit whether the resulting matrix is likely to be sparse and do something intelligent.

<a id='comment:4'></a>I got a rather crude version of this up and running, so here's a patch. The crude part is that I ask `eclib` for dense vectors one at a time, rather than asking for a whole sparse matrix; but this was easier to wrap (I didn't need to tamper with the include files to expose any functionality) and already avoids an obvious quadratic memory step. 

I tried this out on my usual compute server:

```
sage: time C = CremonaModularSymbols(400001, sign=-1)
CPU times: user 26.6 s, sys: 119 ms, total: 26.7 s
Wall time: 26.7 s
sage: time T2a = C.hecke_matrix(2)
CPU times: user 17.7 s, sys: 4.9 s, total: 22.6 s
Wall time: 22.6 s
sage: time T2b = T2a.sage_matrix_over_ZZ(sparse=True)
CPU times: user 26.2 s, sys: 83 ms, total: 26.2 s
Wall time: 26.3 s
sage: del T2a
sage: time T2c = C.sparse_hecke_matrix(2)
CPU times: user 1min 10s, sys: 548 ms, total: 1min 11s
Wall time: 1min 11s
sage: time T2b == T2c # True but not instant for sparse matrices
CPU times: user 11 s, sys: 650 ms, total: 11.7 s
Wall time: 11.7 s
True
```
The regression (48.9s to 71.7s) is annoying; the bottleneck is the line

```
        ans = M(entries=d)
```
where `M` is the matrix space of sparse matrices and `d` is the dict mapping coordinate pairs to matrix entries. I had the thought that the matrix constructor must be copying the dict (as is necessary generically) even though in this case it's not required, but I don't think that's the issue:

```
sage: time dd = copy(d) #too short
CPU times: user 960 ms, sys: 73 ms, total: 1.03 s
Wall time: 1.03 s
sage: time dd = deepcopy(d) #too long
CPU times: user 2min 21s, sys: 1.7 s, total: 2min 23s
Wall time: 2min 23s
```
On the memory side (crudely measured by watching `top`), the computation of `T2b` via `T2a` peaks at 5.9g whereas the computation of `T2c` peaks at 1.6g, so at least that went according to plan.

And in my intended use case I work modulo some prime, and this is a big win:

```
sage: time T2d = C.sparse_hecke_matrix(2, base_ring=GF(2))
CPU times: user 15.3 s, sys: 317 ms, total: 15.7 s
Wall time: 15.7 s
sage: time T2e = C.sparse_hecke_matrix(2, base_ring=GF(next_prime(2^30)))
CPU times: user 24.3 s, sys: 607 ms, total: 25 s
Wall time: 25 s
}
```
so I'm taken care of.

<a id='comment:8'></a>Oh, now this is bad news.

```
sage: C = CremonaModularSymbols(45, cuspidal=True,sign=-1)
sage: T2a = C.hecke_matrix(2).sage_matrix_over_ZZ()
sage: print T2a
[-1 -1 -1]
[ 0  1  2]
[ 0  0 -1] 
sage: T2b = C.sparse_hecke_matrix(2)
sage: print T2b
[-1 -1  0]
[ 0  1  2]
[ 0  0 -3]
```
This is only an issue when `cuspidal=True`: the `eclib` function `heckeop` takes the projection onto the cuspidal subspace into account but `heckeop_col` does not. 

It looks like `s_heckeop` does account for the cuspidal projection, so switching to that should fix this problem.

I can see that to provide the interface needed will require adding to eclib.  Sorry.

I don't expect that to be any better than the current version though since for each i,j the elem() method will do a linear search along the i'th row to see if the j'th entry is present.

That said, `svec.h` does appear to include some access functions:

```
  // functions to enable iteration over the entries without direct
  // access to the entries map:
  map<int,scalar>::const_iterator begin() const {return entries.begin();}
  map<int,scalar>::const_iterator end() const {return entries.end();}
  map<int,scalar>::iterator begin() {return entries.begin();}
  map<int,scalar>::iterator end() {return entries.end();}
  void erase(int i);  // erases v[i]; error if not set
  int first_index() const {return entries.upper_bound(0)->first;}
  std::set<int> support() const;
```
that should avoid creating a dense vector; but I need to learn a bit more about Cython to figure out how to exploit those.

Cython does support that (I'm assuming that `map` means `std::map`):

```
from libcpp.map cimport map

cdef extern from "...":
    cdef cppclass ...:
        map[int, scalar].iterator begin()
        map[int, scalar].iterator end()
