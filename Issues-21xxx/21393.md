Hi Vincent,

Thanks for your comments.

Replying to [vdelecroix](#comment%3A5):
> What is the point of all these methods raising `NotImplementedError`?


Documentation, mostly: I believe that every time a method can be implemented by several implementation variants of objects of some kind, there should be either a generic implementation or at least a stub raising `NotImplementedError` to specify the method name, arguments and semantics.

Replying to [vdelecroix](#comment%3A6):
> You could check that `power_trunc` does work where `_power_trunc` has some overflow.


Guessing you're thinking of `pol.power_trunc(very_large, small)`: no, it doesn't, because `polynomial_element.Polynomial` calls `_cmp_` on the coefficients calls `_cmp_` to check for equality, and that doesn't work with balls. There's a general problem here that goes well beyond the scope of this ticket. I could perhaps redefine comparison methods for polynomials with ball coefficients as a workaround, but I'd prefer to keep that for a separate ticket if you don't mind.

The problem with this approach is that you let these methods appear in the tab completion. With a well defined documentation. But these methods just not work. Not very user friendly.

Where in `power_trunc` you need to perform a call to `_cmp_`!? If some generic methods are broken, it should be mentioned somewhere. Or even overriden with `NotImplementedError`.

I disagree: on the contrary, methods like `compose_trunc` are methods *of polynomials*, not of polynomials over whatever specific ring. They should ideally be implemented by all subclasses—they just aren't yet. It is much, much better IMO to have a method that doesn't work in all cases but has a docstring specifying what it is supposed to do *whenever* it works (allowing in particular to write generic code) than to have methods that make sense in all cases come and go (or exist but be inconsistent with each other) depending, e.g., what ring you are working on!

Well, `generic_power_trunc` (which you wrote `:-)`) compares polynomials using `==`, which doesn't work over all coefficient rings, due to the way polynomial comparison is implemented—and to the general mess with comparisons. That's an issue that affects lots of operations with objects with interval or ball coefficients, I don't think it makes much sense to try to document it every time...

At the end, the difference is

```
sage: my_object.my_method()  # current version
AttributeError
sage: my_object.my_method()  # your version
NotImplementedError
```
I do not see the real plus of what you did. The only reasonable way is to actually implement the generic version.

That being said, it is good that the base class defines the API for all the subclasses. But Python is not very suited for that purpose. I do not like methods that pretend to exist

```
def is_riemann_conjecture_true(self):
   r"""
   Answers whether the Riemann conjecture is valid
   """
   raise NotImplementedError
```

There is only one comparison of polynomials at

```
# check for idempotence, and store the result otherwise
cdef Polynomial a = p.truncate(prec)
cdef Polynomial aa = a._mul_trunc_(a, prec)
if aa == a:
    return a
```
If the answer is `False` for the comparison it does not matter at all.

The main point is to define the API—both for the user and for implementers of subclasses, as you say yourself. Besides, to me, the first exception means “there's no such method”, period, while the second one means “the method makes sense, but doesn't work yet in the case you asked for”. It's no different from having a single generic implementation with several cases, only some of which are implemented.

Sure, but that's not the problem. What happens is the following.

```

    962         cdef int c

    951             if c: return c
    952         return 0

    872                 return 0
--> 873             if (<Element>left)._richcmp_(right, Py_LT):
    874                 return -1
    875             if (<Element>left)._richcmp_(right, Py_GT):

/home/marc/co/sage/src/sage/rings/complex_arb.pyx in sage.rings.complex_arb.ComplexBall._richcmp_ (build/cythonized/sage/rings/complex_arb.cpp:13232)()

   1568         elif op == Py_GT or op == Py_GE or op == Py_LT or op == Py_LE:

   1570 
   1571     def identical(self, ComplexBall other):

```

I'd say the main issue is that `Polynomial` implements `_cmp_()` rather than `_eq_()`, and does so by calling `cmp()` on the coefficients, even though the coefficient ring may not be totally ordered. But I don't think that's easy to fix, and in any case that's out of scope for this ticket.

I'm not sure I understand: the documentation for ``@`abstract_method` says that (i) it is for methods that should be implemented by *all* concrete derived classes (ii) it prevents from using `obj.method?` to access the documentation, while what I think I want is a method (i) that may be implemented by some derived classes only, and (ii) whose docstring can be accessed in the most standard possible way.

Sorry for not responding, I seem to have missed your post. In regards to (i), you can do ``@`abstract_method(optional=True)` to make it not mandatory. Doing this gives you a way to check if it is implemented (`obj.method == NotImplemented`), which is distinct from if something further down throws a `NotImplementedError`. For (ii), that is only when `obj.method` is not implemented by a concrete class, but otherwise it prevents `?` from getting the doc (which, because it is not implemented, it should not IMO).

However, all of those methods, implemented or not, do require at least one doctest.

I also don't see why you need the `_acb_poly_*` methods in the `.pxd` file, you don't call them anywhere in the code.

Similarly, you don't have any of the `_*_series` methods implemented. If you're trying to set the API for polynomials, I think that is better done on a separate ticket (since you aren't adding those methods here).

Added. I sometimes wonder how sage survives with such policies `:-/`...

I'm not sure I understand. If you're talking about the `.pwd` file under `libs/`, I put the complete API of `acb_poly` there (with some stuff commented e.g. when it depended on types I didn't want to import for no reason).

> Similarly, you don't have any of the `_*_series` methods implemented. If you're trying to set the API for polynomials, I think that is better done on a separate ticket (since you aren't adding those methods here).


I just took the opportunity to take care of the `_*_series` methods that already were implemented in other subclasses of `Polynomial` (cf. the commit message).

IMO the only thing that matters in the end are commits—tickets are just there to organize the review. But if you or anyone is willing to review some (reasonably consistent!) subset of the commits on this ticket, please say so, and I'll split the ticket (or just drop the remaining commits).

Ah, crap, that's right. You can simply remove them because they (currently) don't work.

Well, it's moot for this ticket anyways.

Well, it usually is a simple thing to do at least, but I can relate.

You only need to add things that you use into the `pxd` file since the library can handle its own internal calls. I think it makes it harder to maintain (more likely to get conflicts) and understand (more to sift through and confusing about what function to use).

It's not clear that these should be included as part of the API of all polynomials, especially since they are hidden methods. Are they called indirectly by some (public) method of the base polynomial class?

> IMO the only thing that matters in the end are commits—tickets are just there to organize the review. But if you or anyone is willing to review some (reasonably consistent!) subset of the commits on this ticket, please say so, and I'll split the ticket (or just drop the remaining commits).


It's a matter of locality of searching trac tickets, but it's not that big of a deal.

Not exactly, but they are called (or at least intended to be callable, I don't know how things are standing now) by power series classes. So they certainly are part of the (sage-internal) API of polynomials.

IIRC, `iteritems` is okay in Cython files with Python3. So I believe you can ignore that.

I can accept the `_*_series` in that case. From looking at other files in `sage/libs`, I am okay with the `.pxd` file modulo the commented out lines: Either remove them or uncomment them.

Uncommenting them would require additional imports (that's why they were commented out), so I removed them. (This is inconsistent with what we did elsewhere under `sage/libs/arb`, however.)
