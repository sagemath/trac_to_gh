At the moment `normalize()` will not expand factors of fractions. If fractions are combined however, the final numerator is expanded:

```
sage: ((x^(y/2) + 1)^2*(x^(y/2) - 1)^2/(x^y - 1)).normalize()
(x^(1/2*y) + 1)^2*(x^(1/2*y) - 1)^2/(x^y - 1)
sage: (x + y^2/(x + 2)).normalize()
(x^2 + y^2 + 2*x)/(x + 2)
```

The alternatives are provided atm by Maxima

```
sage: ((x^(y/2) + 1)^2*(x^(y/2) - 1)^2/(x^y - 1)).simplify_rational(algorithm='simple')
(x^(2*y) - 2*x^y + 1)/(x^y - 1)
sage: (x + y^2/(x + 2)).simplify_rational(algorithm='noexpand')
((x + 2)*x + y^2)/(x + 2)
```

https://github.com/pynac/pynac/issues/191

After Pynac will have implemented `normalize()` options to these effect the calls to Maxima in `simplify_rational` should be replaced by the respective calls to Pynac.

This is implemented in Pynac master ~~but one doctest depends on #21360~~. Also, nested application ("full") needs to be done.

Minor point: "and and" should be "and".

Apart from that, I don't understand why `algorithm="full"` attempts to factor the simplified fraction (which is a potentially costly operation). Is there something in the way the Pynac `normal()` function works that makes it necessary to do so?

Indeed the performance question was the source of some headaches to me, as well. I figured at the time consistency with Maxima behaviour was more important. Without `factor` the following doctests will fail:

I don't know exactly what either Maxima or Pynac does, but just by chance, do you think it would be okay to keep the loop but *expand* the denominators instead of calling `factor()`?

This will, additionally to the two doctests above, fail this doctest:

```

I think I see now how to resolve the three tests without factoring. Pynac's gcd needs to be a bit more aware of powers in the expression and needs to replace some of them with new symbols. This way also exponentials can be handled identically (which does not work atm).
