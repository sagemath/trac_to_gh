At the moment `normalize()` will not expand factors of fractions. If fractions are combined however, the final numerator is expanded:

```
sage: ((x^(y/2) + 1)^2*(x^(y/2) - 1)^2/(x^y - 1)).normalize()
(x^(1/2*y) + 1)^2*(x^(1/2*y) - 1)^2/(x^y - 1)
sage: (x + y^2/(x + 2)).normalize()
(x^2 + y^2 + 2*x)/(x + 2)
```

The alternatives are provided atm by Maxima

```
sage: ((x^(y/2) + 1)^2*(x^(y/2) - 1)^2/(x^y - 1)).simplify_rational(algorithm='simple')
(x^(2*y) - 2*x^y + 1)/(x^y - 1)
sage: (x + y^2/(x + 2)).simplify_rational(algorithm='noexpand')
((x + 2)*x + y^2)/(x + 2)
```

https://github.com/pynac/pynac/issues/191

After Pynac will have implemented `normalize()` options to these effect the calls to Maxima in `simplify_rational` should be replaced by the respective calls to Pynac.

This will, additionally to the two doctests above, fail this doctest:
