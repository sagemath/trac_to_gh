This patch modifies the `_mul_` and `_len_` methods of free_monoid_element to allow for negative exponents.  It also incorporates an `_invert_` method.  

These changes effectively allow one to use the free_monoid as a free group so that the free algebra may be used as a "free Laurent polynomial ring".

I had a look at this code and did some refactoring. I could not push to `u/drupel/21192` so I made a new branch at `u/etn40ff/21192`.

The code looks good to me and ready for a positive review. These changes, though, might be controversial since they add an operation that is not really meant to be there. I would feel better if someone with more experience were to give a positive review.

A strong -1 to this ticket. You should just use a free group instead.

One other possible thing (which should have a post to sage-devel once it is positively reviewed) is to implement the canonical coercion to the corresponding free group with division/invert returning an element of the free group.
