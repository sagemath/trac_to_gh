Not sure if it's a bug or a problem with the documentation, but without any assumptions on `x`, `solve(x==x, x)` returns `[x == r1]`.  The documentation does not state what `r1` is, but gives the following example:

```
   If there is a parameter in the answer, that will show up as a new
   variable.  In the following example, "r1" is a real free variable
   (because of the "r"):

      sage: solve([x+y == 3, 2*x+2*y == 6],x,y)
      [[x == -r1 + 3, y == r1]]
```

However, without assumptions on `x`, there's no reason to believe that `x` is real.

This ticket also fixes a grammar issue introduced in #21554 (see comments).

First of all, I would have written

```
Still, it's unclear what the following sequence of assumptions following this line has 
to do with the one of solutions being real. Do you mean to say that in order to make sure that one (rather, every?) solution is real, you need to make the following assumptions? Something else?

It was a part of ticket #21554 which has already been merged.

According to the documentation provided earlier, the solution of the equation described in the issue is r1, which is a real number (That is what the documentation says!). But the solution to this equation can be a complex number too! So, I just changed the documentation and redefined r1 to be any arbitrary constant.

I understand this --- my question is wholly about the commit from #21554.
How does this docstring clarify anything about assuming non-integer? I don't get it.

Differently named branches always have some common commits (and as I wrote on sage-support, it is the case that the commit c7acfd6 from #21554 is present in the branch here). Branch names are merely labels in the directed graph of commits in a repo.

Anyhow, c7acfd6 needs fixing, if only because it's broken English there...
