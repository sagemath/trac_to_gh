Not sure if it's a bug or a problem with the documentation, but without any assumptions on `x`, `solve(x==x, x)` returns `[x == r1]`.  The documentation does not state what `r1` is, but gives the following example:

```
   If there is a parameter in the answer, that will show up as a new
   variable.  In the following example, "r1" is a real free variable
   (because of the "r"):

      sage: solve([x+y == 3, 2*x+2*y == 6],x,y)
      [[x == -r1 + 3, y == r1]]
```

However, without assumptions on `x`, there's no reason to believe that `x` is real.

This ticket also fixes a grammar issue introduced in #21554 (see comments).

Depends on #21554

It was a part of ticket #21554 which has already been merged.

According to the documentation provided earlier, the solution of the equation described in the issue is r1, which is a real number (That is what the documentation says!). But the solution to this equation can be a complex number too! So, I just changed the documentation and redefined r1 to be any arbitrary constant.

I understand this --- my question is wholly about the commit from #21554.
How does this docstring clarify anything about assuming non-integer? I don't get it.

Differently named branches always have some common commits (and as I wrote on sage-support, it is the case that the commit c7acfd6 from #21554 is present in the branch here). Branch names are merely labels in the directed graph of commits in a repo.

Anyhow, c7acfd6 needs fixing, if only because it's broken English there...
