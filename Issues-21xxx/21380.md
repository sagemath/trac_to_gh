## Abstract

This ticket stands to clean `CategoryObject` and `Parent` with respect to:
- hacks and too specialized methods (e.g. `base` or `_ngens_`)
- undocumented and old (e.g. `sage.structure.generators`)
- duplicated stuff (e.g. `_an_element_` and `an_element`)

## Subtasks

### Base and generators

We should move out of `CategoryObject` the attributes and methods related to generators and variable names.

Attributes:
- `_names`

Methods:
- `gens_dict`
- `gens_dict_recursive`
- `objgens`
- `objgen`
- `_first_ngens`
- `_defining_names`
- `_assign_names`
- `__temporarily_change_names`
- `variable_names`
- `variable_name`
- `latex_variable_names`
- `latex_name`
- `inject_variables`
- `base_ring`

It is not clear where all this should be moved... Moreover "generators" is ambiguous since "monoid generators", "group generators", "algebra generators", ... are different things.

### Keep

These were originally proposed to be removed too, but are sufficiently useful:

Attributes:
- `_base`
Methods:
- `base`
Functions:
- `normalize_names`
- `certify_names`

### Tickets

Some related tickets are
 
- gradual transition for to remove inheritance from `ParentWithGens` to `Ring` (#13683? still useful?)

- #24430: normalization for `_names`, `variable_name` and `variable_names` in the context of polynomials and series

### Transition to `FiniteEnumeratedSet`

- set the category to `FiniteEnumeratedSets` where appropriate (#12957)

- Move `__len__` and `__getitem__` from `Parent` to `FiniteEnumeratedSets` (#12955)

- deprecate `CombinatorialClass` in favor of the `EnumeratedSets` category (#12913, #19986)

### Duplicated names for same function

- cleanup `an_element` (#18291)

- cardinality vs order (#18410)

### Others

- move `Set_generic` and `Set_Python_type_class` out of `sage.structure.parent`. Moreover we should use `UniqueRepresentation` instead of the custom class factory `Set_PythonType`.

- Various fixes in category initialization (#21353)

- cleanup variable factories  (#18390)

- cleanup cartesian products (task ticket #15425)

### Closed tickets

- refactor `getattr_from_other_class` (#20686)

- Simplify `_populate_generators_` (#21381)

- Remove `sage.structure.generators` (#21382)

- Remove `ParentWith*AbelianGens` (#21383)

- Remove `_populate_generators_` (#21385)

- Always enable `debug.bad_parent_warnings` (#24109)

After thinking about this now and then, I think that it does make sense to keep `_base` inside `CategoryObject`. There are a lot of objects which naturally have a base object. For efficiency and simplicity, I suggest to keep `CategoryObject._base`.

Well, we cannot define "base" in full generality. Some objects do not have a natural base and then this attribute should simply be `None`.

But in certain important categories, we can define "base". For example, for modules, we define "base" to mean the parent of the scalars used for scalar multiplication.

This is precisely the reason why I dislike it. It is a fake global concept that is mostly meant for "the underlying ring of a module". And because  modules are important all parents have an attribute `_base` as well as methods `base` and `base_ring`. Think for a minute about the list of parents without base: permutations, graphs, groups, rings, schemes, simplicial complexes, ...

Moreover, I (maybe wrongly) thought that this "base ring of a module" is the kind of information that belongs to the category

```
sage: Modules(ZZ)
Category of modules over Integer Ring
sage: Modules(ZZ).base()
Integer Ring
```

Note that there are a *lot* of parents in Sage which represent a module of some sort. Most of them do not inherit from `Module`. So even if we implement `_base` in the `Module` class, that won't help unless we change a large number of parents to inherit from that.

Most of the arithmetic/coercion model has been cleaned up by now, but those two methods are an ugly remaining corner. I would like to define `_lmul_` and `_rmul_` as multiplication by an element of `parent._base`. Ideally, that would have fast access to the `_base` attribute.


Once more, `_base` means "base ring on a module"! Would be better to use the name `_base_ring` and mention that it will be used for scalar multiplication. That would be a clear semantic.

Why `CategoryObject` and not `Parent`?

Moving `base()` and `base_ring()` to the category would not be possible if the attribute `_base` is private. How do you plan to declare it?

I was thinking of a hierarchy like this:

+-Parent
+---ParentWithBase  (maybe useless right now)
+-+-ParentWithGens
  |
  +-+-ParentWithBaseAndGens
    |
    +-Module (etc).
```

Getting the base ring and the generators are very common operations, so a slowdown in that access could potentially have much larger speed implications.

There usually should not be too many simple getter methods in a category that are used in tight loops that this is a problem, but there are a few that do warrant the special attention.

I don't think that it makes much sense to have unrelated classes `ParentWithBase` and `ParentWithBaseAndGens`. Since base seems more important than gens, I would actually suggest

```

We have objects with base but without gens (e.g., polytopes), objects without base but with gens (e.g., permutation groups), as well as with(out) both. So I was trying to address that with my proposed hierarchy. At least I would like `ParentWithGens` in between `Parent` and `ParentWithBase` as there are very few things in Sage that have gens but no concept of base.

Yes, definitely. Although most of them are really fundamental parents such as `Ring`, number fields, etc. I guess we can take care of the leaf classes a little more easily, such as `ComplexIntervalField`.

I think this would be the most sensible solution since most of our Cython parent classes would inherit from the `ParentWithGensAndBase` (e.g., `Ring`, where we really treat everything as some `R`-algebra), but would keep the flexibility for other parents in a reasonable way.
