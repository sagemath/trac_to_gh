```
There is an easily reproducible bug with assumptions:

```
sage: var("p", domain="positive")
p
sage: assume(p<1)
sage: bool(p<1)
True
sage: bool(p^2<1)
True
sage: bool(p^6<1) # Should be True
False
```

The same happens for `var("p")` and then assuming `assume(p>0)`. The following list should be `[0..999]`, but we see something different:

```
sage: [i for i in range(1000) if bool(p^i < 1)]
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 16, 25, 27, 32, 64, 81]
```

Yes, this is already in Maxima:

```
(%i1) assume(p>0);
(%o1)                               [p > 0]
(%i2) assume(p<1);        
(%o2)                               [p < 1]
(%i3) is(p^2<1); 
(%o3)                                true
(%i4) is(p^6<1);        
(%o4)                               unknown
```
Now I see that http://maxima.sourceforge.net/docs/manual/maxima_11.html#assume mentions
 Maxima's deduction mechanism is not very strong; there are many obvious consequences which cannot be determined by is. This is a known weakness. 
But Maxima does have a tristate, as can be seen above. See #17700 for more.

Should the milestone of this ticket be changed to sage-duplicate or to sage-wishlist?
