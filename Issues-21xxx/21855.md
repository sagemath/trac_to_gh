1.

```
sage: P = LaurentPolynomialRing(QQ, 'a, b')
sage: Q = LaurentPolynomialRing(P, 'c, d')
sage: Q(P.0)
c
```
but the expected result is `a` as it is with polynomial rings:

```
sage: P = PolynomialRing(QQ, 'a, b')
sage: Q = PolynomialRing(P, 'c, d')
sage: Q(P.0)
a
```
2. (In some sense) more generally, conversion between certain laurent polynomial rings (e.g. isomorphic rings) fail. E.g. the following should work

```
sage: L.<a, b, c, d> = LaurentPolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: M = LaurentPolynomialRing(QQ, 'c, d')
sage: Mc, Md = M.gens()
sage: N = LaurentPolynomialRing(M, 'a, b')
sage: Na, Nb = N.gens()
sage: M(c/d)
sage: N(a*b/c/d)
sage: N(c/d)
sage: L(Mc)
sage: L(Nb)
```
3. As needed to fix the above, a method `is_constant`, as well as methods for the conversions of constant laurent polynomials are to be implemented.

Depends on #21833

Since (multivariate) polynomial and Laurent polynomial rings should have essentially the same coercions, how difficult would it be to pull out the code to find the coercions into standalone functions (or as a mixin-class)? Or are there some subtle differences that I am not quite considering? I feel like this could make code maintenance easier in the long-run.

Some other small things:

- Please make sure your `INPUT` blocks are in the proper format (sorry to sound like a broken record)
- (Short) Error messages should not have periods.
- It is with a capital letter "Laurent".
- This is a cleaner way of doing multiline statements

  ```python
        return (self._mon == ETuple({}, int(self.parent().ngens()))
                and self._poly.is_constant())
  ```

[chapoton](#comment:17) thanks for doing this.

> - (Short) Error messages should not have periods.

I am for a correct punctation. Thus if it is a proper English sentence (short or longer), there should be a period. E.g.

```
ValueError: a is not constant.
```
Thus either we (meaning I) add the period again or we rewrite this to `a not constant`. What do you prefer? (FYI, I prefer the former as it sound "more round".)

> - It is with a capital letter "Laurent".

Thank you for doing.

Ok, I am fine with it.

The short version is that this is a Python convention that we (should) try to adhere to. The more technical reason: while they could be considered full sentences, they technically don't begin with a capital letter (the type of error is taken more as a bullet point).

LGTM. Thanks.

Is this really so? I have not found this convention, so it would be great if you could provide a link etc.

By just looking what Python does, it seems not to be clear, what the rule is: E.g. `rational division by zero` (which is produced by `1/int(0)`) could also mean "use correct punctation and capitalization", i.e. if not a proper English sentence start small and end with `.`, and that does not exclude, if a proper English sentence, then start capitalized and end with period.

> The more technical reason: while they could be considered full sentences, they technically don't begin with a capital letter (the type of error is taken more as a bullet point).

So, this means `a is not constant.` should not start with a formula, but something like `The input a is not constant.` should be fine. ;)

> LGTM. Thanks.

Good math papers should never start sentences with formulas. :P We can also always change sentences into clauses too. ;)
