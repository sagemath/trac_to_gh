A doctest in `misc/cython.py` passes unnecessary include directories, depending on `SAGE_LOCAL`

```
"#cinclude %s/include/singular %s/include/factory"%(SAGE_LOCAL, SAGE_LOCAL)
```

(They are unnecessary because every singular-related include already uses `singular/....h` and will therefore be found already when `SAGE_LOCAL/include` is on the include path.)

We can remove these includes, thereby removing one more explicit dependency on $SAGE_LOCAL. 

(see also #15105)

(The same file also uses `$SAGE_LOCAL/include/flint`, but that needs handling in a different way -- this is #21803.)

Flint's header files are installed in SAGE_LOCAL/include/flint but include each other without the "flint/" prefix.
This makes it necessary to add a separate include path.

That doesn't matter because

```
#include "foo.h"
```
will always look for `foo.h` in the same directory as the including file.

So, the include path would only matter for external includes (i.e. from Sage) and there we always use the `flint/` prefix.
