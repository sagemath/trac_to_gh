This patch extends the developers' manual with instructions on how to maintain a set of patches using git.
It also explains when to patch, when to repackage.

My biggest issue on #18920 was that git produces patches per commit, not per file (the latter was the original structure of patches in Sage, it seems).

A sane workflow in this case would be to maintain Sage patches as a branch for the Maxima git repo, that can be rebased against their updates. This would be then (semi)automatic to produce a new set of patches.

Is there *any* package which actually uses the procedure explained in "How to maintain a set of patches"? It would be strange to document that as if it is standard practice, when in reality it is never done.

Not fully yet. 

- I've created a patch for `gc` like this from the fork at https://github.com/mkoeppe/bdwgc -- but I did not import the existing `cygwin64.patch` that was in the sage patches.

- I've created the SCIPoptsuite patches like this -- but I cannot use a public github for the changed SCIP sources because of its licensing.
