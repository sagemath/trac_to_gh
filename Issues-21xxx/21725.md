There is a current trend to develop Cython libraries as separate packages, rather than as part of Sage.

Many of these libraries take numbers of various kinds as input or produce them as output.

It would be nice if these Cython libraries could do conversions from/to Sage number types. Otherwise, on the Sage side we would have to provide a separate wrapper around the Cython wrapper. 

Currently, this leads to 
- awkward dependencies (such as fpylll depending on sagelib - see [this sage-devel discussion](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/s8yeEPK_9zU) and #21728) and to 
- duplication of effort (for example, PyPolymake and its GMP wrappers)

We need to develop shared infrastructure (a new lightweight library, which does NOT depend on sagelib) for this.

If a Python call + a copy per number conversion it not too high a price to pay, then perhaps sage objects backed by a “well-known” C library could provide an interface that would make them read/write an `mpz_t` (resp. `mpq_t`, `mpfr_t`, `mpfi_t`...) from/to a specified location? This would at least make it possible to exchange multiple-precision numbers with sage without build-depending on it.

For example, it would not seem so hard to provide a C library with a minimal interface such as

```
int mpz_from_python_integer(mpz_t target, PyObject *object)
```
that fills `target` with a GMP integer converted from `object`
and returns an error code if it can't.

By default (in plain Python), it would only deal with Python integers.

But libraries that provide new integer types such as sagelib can hook into this, for example by defining a method or any other of Python's dynamic mechanisms.


For the opposite conversion, for converting to the Python/Sage world, one would pass an extra argument to the wrapped function that indicates the type of output (Python integer? Sage integer? ...)

Various libraries that I am currently interested in (polymake, normaliz) need Cython wrappers, which should be usable with or without Sage. The interfaces are using integers (and integer vectors, matrices, and more complicated structures) - and one should be able to request Python integers or Sage integers from the Cython wrapper. 
However, it should definitely not build-depend on sagelib (because we will need the opposite dependency -- sagelib will have to build-depend on pyPolymake, pyNormaliz etc.)

This is exactly the kind of thing I am fighting with in pypolymake. Actually pypolymake could easily provide a function to set the interface

```
int set_pypolymake_mpz_wrapper((PyObject *) (mpz_t, PyObject *))
```
I am not sure what is the best approach here but +1 for having a standardized and Sage agnostic way of doing it! I am available to test as many approaches as suggested within pypolymake. 

Note that we might want to do that for many basic types (integer, rational, floating point real and complexes, Zmodn, matrices, polynomials, ...). And this explosion might become a nightmare.

I hope that you mean a Python module and not a C library. Libraries are a pain in Python.

One thing we really need to consider is efficiency. We already have plenty of slow ways to do what you want (e.g. for integers we can go via Python ints, for other types we could use strings).

I don't think it was created with this use case in mind, but I still think that this could be a good starting point. We obviously would need to add a Cython interface.

I have been looking at `gmpy2` for the last hour or so. I think it could work to use the `gmpy2` types as intermediates for the proposed conversions.

The big issue is that `gmpy2` currently does not expose a C or Cython interface. So either we need to work with upstream to implement that or we need to fork `gmpy2`.

The C prototypes that I wrote are an illustration of what I would do if we were making the Python wrappers by hand instead of using Cython.

Of course, we should be making a Cython library with corresponding Cython prototypes.

My idea would be:

- Add an `__mpz__` method to various types. This will be used to convert an "arbitrary" object to a `gmpy2` integer (which is just a thin wrapper around an `mpz_t`). This conversion will not be very fast, but probably fast enough for most use cases.

- For the cases where we have complete control over the types, we could use Cython code to construct a `gmpy2` integer using the C interface.

- For conversion from `gmpy2` to a type `t`, we just need to add some `isinstance(x, gmpy2.mpz)` branches in `t.__init__`.

As I said before, this would require non-trivial (but backwards compatible) changes to `gmpy2`.

Why do you think it would be better to go through Python wrappers rather than direct C function calls? Note that such situation would create a dependency to gmpy2 for many projects. On the plus side, flint and arb have [python-flint](https://github.com/fredrik-johansson/python-flint).

I just don't see how one could implement that if you don't want build-time dependencies and you don't want Python objects to be involved. You need to pass around `mpz_t` pointers but you cannot literally do that in Python: you need to wrap the `mpz_t` pointer in some Python object. And that's precisely what `gmpy2` does.

You will need a dependency on *something* anyway. This feature needs to be implemented somewhere (not in thin air) and you will need to depend on that.

> That being said, what would be the integration of these wrappers in the Sage ecosystem? For example with respect to coercion, would it make sense to have Sage types inheriting from these wrappers, etc.

I see those `gmpy2` types purely as a way of passing around data. There should be a conversion from/to those types, but nothing more than that. Inheriting from those types wouldn't work because that's incompatible with the Sage coercion model.

We could still support those types in the Sage coercion model, like we currently do for the standard Python types like `int`. But that's not a priority.

I don't really understand what you mean with that comment. Are you saying that we could use this instead of `gmpy2`? One issue is the fact that GMP/MPIR types are more "standard" than the FLINT types. A second issue is that `gmpy2` looks more optimized for speed than `python-flint`.

This is not exactly what I need for pypolymake. This library is just a Python interface to polymake (that is currently a mix of C++ and Perl). When the answer to some method is an integer I want the possibility to return a Sage integer (if it is used from Sage), a gmpy2 integer (if it is used from Python with gmpy2 available) or a Python integer.

This is the kind of template I have

```
cpdef my_integer_question():
    cdef mpz_t ans
    my_polymake_function(ans)
    return mpz_wrapper(ans)
```
And I want this `mpz_wrapper` parametrizable (on module loading or by the user). This is currently working but not very clean.

With your proposal, this function will have to go through `gmpy2` and then call a (possibly pure Python) conversion `gmpy2 -> whatever`.

```
cpdef my_integer_question():
    cdef mpz_t ans
    my_polymake_function(ans)
    my_gmpy2 = mpz_wrapper(ans)
    return gmpy2_converter(my_gmpy2)
```

I am not sure I prefer the gmpy2 version.

Anyway, I would still like to know what you think of my idea to use `gmpy2` as "de facto" standard to pass around integers.

Does it really take 2 weeks to figure out what the ticket is about?

I'm picky about this one because I feel like I might be interested and I could help if only somebody would clarify what this ticket is about.

In reality, I guess that this ticket is really about several things and each of those things should get its own ticket.
