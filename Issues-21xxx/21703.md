PARI now stores its precision internally in bits (as opposed to decimal). This ticket adds an interface for the PARI precision in bits. It also removes the `PariInstance._real_precision` attribute and rewrites the documentation about PARI precision.

Very interesting, I learned a lot on real precision in PARI.

I'm good with it, but wouldn't the "guide" be best put in `__init__`, so that it would be read by anyone who types `pari?`?

I decided to not return the old value in `set_real_precision_bits()` because the PARI call does not return it either. If users really want the old value, they can still call `get_real_precision_bits()`.

I did not change `set_real_precision()` because we cannot do that without a deprecation.

That was my guess, but I think in this case the docstring misses the point: unless he counts the digits by hand, the user won't realize that the output is printed with 192 bits of precision instead of 180. Maybe adding a `parent(_)` to the docstring would help clarify? Something like this:

```
sage: pari(1).sin(precision=180).sage()
0.841470984807896506652502321630298999622563060798371065673
sage: x = pari(1).sin(precision=180)
sage: x
0.841470984807897
sage: x.bitprecision()
192
sage: x.sage()
0.841470984807896506652502321630298999622563060798371065673
sage: parent(_)
Real Field with 192 bits of precision
```

And maybe line 169 should print with 180 bits, to highlight the difference.

Also, in lines 182-183, when you write "real precision", there is confusion btw real as in reality and real as in real number (frankly, after re-reading for the 10th time that sentence, I'm not sure I understand it).

PARI uses the term "real precision" to mean precision of real numbers. I use it the same way.

In this case, words (i.e. units of 32 or 64 bits)

?? 5*32=160. How does that fit with 192 bits of precision?

It's actually `(5 - 2) * 64 = 192`:

```
sage: from sage.libs.pari.pari_instance import prec_words_to_bits
....: prec_words_to_bits(5)
192
```
