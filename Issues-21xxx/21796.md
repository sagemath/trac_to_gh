As discussed on #15105, Debian splits the GAP installation into `lib` and `share`. 
We could do the same.

The problem here is that the upstream's milestone for this to happen is apparently "Ice age in Hell"...

Either before or after the heat death of the universe ;-)

Sanitizing the gap directory structure is likely to break some GAP third-party packages that expect said layout...

Oh well--Jeroen is also right, I think, that there's no reason to tinker with GAP's installation layout in the Sage distribution unless there's a demonstrable need for it.  But I think it's good to leave this ticket open for discussion.

My big ears tell me they are actually not interested in being packaged, so they don't really care about cost to anyone else.

Agree on keeping the status quo until something needs to be done.
