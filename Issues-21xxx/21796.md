As discussed on #15105, Debian splits the GAP installation into `lib` and `share`. 
We could do the same.

The problem here is that the upstream's milestone for this to happen is apparently "Ice age in Hell"...

The problem is that there's no cost to them not having a more standard packaging scheme--instead they're just pushing the cost on to everyone else who wants to help distribute their software.

Oh well--Jeroen is also right, I think, that there's no reason to tinker with GAP's installation layout in the Sage distribution unless there's a demonstrable need for it.  But I think it's good to leave this ticket open for discussion.
