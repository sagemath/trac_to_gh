On a machine which had an older version of Cython installed but which was upgraded recently after #20218 was merged:

```
$ ls -ld local/lib/python/site-packages/Cython*
drwxrwxr-x 12 jdemeyer jdemeyer 4096 Sep  6 21:23 local/lib/python/site-packages/Cython
drwxrwxr-x  5 jdemeyer jdemeyer 4096 Sep  6 21:22 local/lib/python/site-packages/Cython-0.23.3-py2.7-linux-i686.egg
drwxrwxr-x  2 jdemeyer jdemeyer 4096 Sep  6 21:14 local/lib/python/site-packages/Cython-0.24.1-py2.7.egg-info
```

Despite Cython-0.24.1 being available, the older version 0.23.3 is still used by default. This causes breakage when building the Sage library.

```
>>> import Cython
>>> Cython.__version__
'0.23.3'
>>> import sys
>>> [x for x in sys.path if 'Cython' in x]
['/home/jdemeyer/sage-git/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/Cython-0.23.3-py2.7-linux-i686.egg']
```

The problem is not limited to Cython, the same happens for other packages too.

This is a blocker ticket since it breaks upgrades from older Sage versions.

**Steps to reproduce**:

1. `./sage --sh -c 'easy_install cython==0.23.3'`   # Install an older version of Cython.

2. `./sage -f cython`   # Rebuild the Cython in Sage. This *should* uninstall the old version but it doesn't.

**Note to the release manager**: ideally, this would be merged together with #21552 since both tickets trigger recompilation of all Python packages.

That is not entirely trivial because you need to figure out which package to uninstall. You cannot do `pip uninstall .`, you need something like `pip uninstall $PKGNAME`.

Other than that, I like the idea. We could probably drop the `--ignore-installed --no-deps` options too.

Fair point.  A broader idea I had is that as many of the `spkg-install`s (but not all!) have sections for uninstalling previous installations, that step should maybe be broken out to a separate `spkg-uninstall` script.  Another step in making the packages a little more uniform in how they are managed.  But my hope was to find a simple way to address this specific issue *now*.

> Other than that, I like the idea. We could probably drop the `--ignore-installed --no-deps` options too.

I don't know what you mean here.  If `--ignore-installed` is dropped then it's a moot point.  pip will uninstall the previous version of the package without that flag.  It seems that `--ignore-installed` is just very literal in its intent.  It really means "pay no attention whatsoever to what I already have installed".

Here's an initial stab at a fix.  Adds a new `sage-pip-install` script to wrap `pip`, since otherwise this got too unwieldy.  It just ensures that any previous installations of the package are thoroughly uninstalled before the actual `pip install` call.

In the process I found out that Cython's `setup.py` is badly behaved--`./setup.py --name` should really *only* print the package's name (if it prints anything else it should be to stderr).  This is easy enough to work around, but I wonder what other packages make this mistake, and I'm testing for that now...

There are a few others I've found:

* pari_jupyter
* widgetsnbextension
* giacpy
* matplotlib

I've already opened an issue for matplotlib, though I don't have a patch.  I think the check is good to leave in even if these are fixed because you never know when another package is going to be added, or updated in such a way that it breaks this.

Doesn't that mean basically any package that uses pip?  I avoided doing that in #20218 since there was no real change in the packages themselves.  How they are installed is changed, but it shouldn't have otherwise impacted their functionality.

I'm not opposed to doing it anyways, but I'm not sure it's really needed either.

Yes indeed.

The *intent* was to have no real change. But this whole ticket is about an accidental change.

Given that the packages were installed badly, the change *does* impact the functionality.

Another example of breakage is the patchbot report of #20767: it reports a failure because the Cython update #21126 didn't work. If you don't force a rebuild, it will keep using the wrong version.

But that was only an issue specifically because Cython was updated.  The version number of Cython was bumped, at it was reinstalled.  It just didn't uninstall the old version.  Neither the old version nor the new version were "installed badly" on their own--only insofar as two copies were installed.

If a package wasn't otherwise updated there's no reason to reinstall it.

...in the latest beta. If you assume that people upgrade at every beta release, then you might be right. But people might have skipped some beta releases (upgrading from an older version to the current version) and then more packages might be affected. I suggest we don't guess and just upgrade all `pip`-installed packages.

Right, it wasn't "installed badly" in the strict sense. But still, the packages are installed badly in the sense that if you try to `import` them, you get the wrong version.

I think the mass replacement of `PIP_INSTALL` with `sage-pip-install` was excessive.  I deliberately did not do that in the first place, because

a) I wanted to avoid another mass update of `spkg-installs` when that was already done to put `PIP_INSTALL` everywhere, and

b) Leaving `PIP_INSTALL` as a variable means such mass updates can be avoided in the future.  For example, future improvements in pip itself might render the `sage-pip-install` script superfluous, at which point it might be nice to remove it.

I also have ideas for more work to generalize common installation steps so that maybe many of these spkg-installs will just be pointers to a common install script for Python packages, so that will reduce duplication as well, at which point `PIP_INSTALL` might not be as useful.  But for now I think it's easier to leave it so that this can be changed in one place.

> The patch bumps the version numbers of dozens of packages without making changes to them.

This patch *does* make implicit changes to all those `spkg-install` scripts because it changes `$PIP_INSTALL`. See [comment:21] and following.

In any case, if this is merged with  #21552, then all Python packages need to be rebuilt anyway so it wouldn't matter.

I don't personally think it's terribly important to bump all these package versions since it doesn't actually change all of them--for example packages that did not use setuptools (and thus are not installed as .egg directories) really aren't changed *at all*.

That said, strictly speaking, Jeroen is right that this does change runtime behavior since it will change what `sys.path` looks like.  Also nice to bump the version numbers to force all the .egg installs to be removed.
