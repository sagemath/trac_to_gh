Before:

```
sage: QQi.<i> = QuadraticField(-1)
sage: a = i/3 + 1/5
sage: timeit('a.imag()', number=10^4, repeat=20)
10000 loops, best of 20: 56.2 µs per loop
```

After:

```
sage: QQi.<i> = QuadraticField(-1)
sage: a = i/3 + 1/5
sage: timeit('a.imag()', number=10^4, repeat=20)
10000 loops, best of 20: 658 ns per loop

Guessing the biggest gain was from

```diff
-            q = K(0)
+            q = K.zero()
```
LGTM.

In the case of ℚ[i], I don't think so (this line is not executed): if I remember right the most costly part was `embedding =  self._parent.coerce_embedding()`.

Thanks for the review!
