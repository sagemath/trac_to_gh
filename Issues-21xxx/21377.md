I actually have most tests failing now, because of bad indentation.  For example:

```
File "src/sage/interfaces/fricas.py", line 1104, in sage.interfaces.fricas.FriCASElement._sage_
Failed example:
    a = fricas('(1 + sqrt(2))^5'); a                              # optional - fricas
Expected:
       +-+
    29\|2  + 41
Got:
    +-+
    29 \|2  + 41

```
However, I cannot tell whether the tests passed before the switch to FriCAS 1.3.2.
