I actually have most tests failing now, because of bad indentation.  For example:

```
File "src/sage/interfaces/fricas.py", line 1104, in sage.interfaces.fricas.FriCASElement._sage_
Failed example:
    a = fricas('(1 + sqrt(2))^5'); a                              # optional - fricas
Expected:
       +-+
    29\|2  + 41
Got:
    +-+
    29 \|2  + 41

```
However, I cannot tell whether the tests passed before the switch to FriCAS 1.3.2.

I am not sure how to proceed - on the one hand, I think it makes sense to merge this, because I do not know what made the output break (I do *not* mean the additional space) - it was broken before the upgrade, too.

Frederic, can you confirm that the tests pass on your computer?  It's strange that the space introduced in FriCAS would not show up on your system.

So is https://github.com/pynac/pynac. The maintainer just uploads a suitable tarball when doing a release. This means you need to do at least one release in the repo.
