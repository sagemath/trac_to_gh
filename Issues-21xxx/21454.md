The eventual goal is to move all references to a central file. This deals with many of the references, but not all of them. (So far, it hasn't dealt with the references in `combinat`, `graphs`, `rings`, or `schemes`.)

I started looking at the combinat files (looking only so far), and see many REFERENCE blocks with entries like:

```
:wikipedia:`Ordered_partition_of_a_set`
```
What should be done with these? Probably they should be left in place and only papers moved, although some papers only had arxiv or DOI links rather than full journal references.

Perhaps I was unlucky in the files that I looked at, but many of the files that I lookedat are using the references incorrectly, which means that there is little hope of scripting this...

They could be moved to a master list or left in place. Probably better to move them if they have a valid citation key, because part of the point of the master list is to avoid duplications.

In addition, some of the references are incomplete (preprints which have now been published, published papers with no year listed, etc.). There are also badly used references (e.g. things of the form `[Ref]` missing the trailing underscore).

So I don't know how to script it. I also don't know how to break it into small pieces in any good way: the master bibliography file is going to be touched by every change to the references, so even if we break this into lots of tickets, they would probably have to be merged in a specific order.

More an argument for doing this task earlier rather than later :-)

Perhaps grep for REFERENCES, parse stuff `"<whitespace>[...]"` in the lines following REFERENCES before next `"""`, then re-grep that file for `[...]` without the underscore. Should not be too bad in a Perl script.

> So I don't know how to script it. I also don't know how to break it into small pieces in any good way: the master bibliography file is going to be touched by every change to the references, so even if we break this into lots of tickets, they would probably have to be merged in a specific order.

Perhaps something like:

1. Ticket for creating master bibliography with a line `### sage.<module>` for each module of Sage.

2. A ticket for each module (or perhaps multiple small modules in one ticket), moving refs into the respective part of `### sage.<module>`. All these tickets should be mergeable in arbitrary order.

3. A ticket depending on all the previous which resorts the master
    bibliography file and removes the module lines.

But this is possibly a total nightmare on top of the diff of this ticket?

Best,
Johan

Regarding `[Du2003]`: are you concerned because it ought to be `[Duu2003]`? I hadn't gotten around to changing that one yet.

Regarding `REFERENCE` blocks: some of them are still useful, for example to list basic references in the introductory documentation at the top of a file.

Regarding finding references, we should not count on them being in `REFERENCE[S]` blocks; indeed some are not. So I've just been searching using the regular expression `'^[ ]*\.\.[ ]+\['`.

Regarding wikipedia references, after thinking about it more, they could probably be removed and just made into inline references of the form <code>:wikipedia:\`blah\`</code> -- creating a separate citation often doesn't add anything. But this could also be done on another ticket.

Finally, we could view this ticket (or some subset of the changes here) to be a starting point, and then follow up on other tickets.

I merged in Sage 7.4.beta4 and fixed merge conflicts. I also fixed some things which I believe caused compilation errors on my machine.

Can it become a problem that this index file lies in `en/reference`? If we need a reference in e.g. a tutorial, can it cause problems to do a local reference there? Can it use overlapping labels?

In the Developer's guide, does it make sense to recommend people to make `REFERENCES` blocks? What are they good for, when every reference will be a hyperlink to the master bib anyway? If we decide to keep it anyway, the example should be changed to follow the naming conventions. Also, perhaps we should add a warning about the trailing underscore after reference links (since omitting them doesn't cause compilation error).

Best,
Johan

I did not look through every single modification you did, but I did some random sampling and it looks good. And it compiles on my machine. Did you do this manually or did you use scripts?

Please set to positive review if you accept my changes.
