Thank you. This is very good!

I made some minor changes. So if you're okay with them, you can set a positive review.

This approach introduces an extra crossing, (plus the effect of computing the braids, which might contain more crossings than the PD or GC representations).

Something based on the oriented gauss code colud produce an output with exacty as many crossings as the sum  original knots:

```

sage: B = BraidGroup(2)
sage: K = Knot(B([1,1,1]))
sage: ogc1 = K.oriented_gauss_code()
sage: ogc2 = K.oriented_gauss_code()
sage: m = max(ogc1[0][0])
sage: ogc = [[ogc1[0][0] + [sign(i)*(abs(i)+m) for i in ogc2[0][0]]], ogc1[1]+ogc2[1]]
sage: K2 = Knot(ogc)
```
