When building Singular on a system that has Flint (i.e. in Sage), its configure/makefiles add some compiler and linker flags specifically "needed" for Flint.

One of these flags includes `-lmpir` which is incongruous with the fact that Singular itself links with GMP with `-lgmp`.

This patch removes the unnecessary `-lmpir`.  As was mentioned in [this thread](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/6niNzyvh55I/VPtl88tUBwAJ), there has been effort in the past (for compatibility purposes) to remove explicit mentions of "mpir" in build systems for Sage packages in favor of "gmp".  This is just an example that slipped through the cracks.

It didn't cause a problem on Linux because everything in Singular linked first with GMP via `-lgmp`, so all symbols got resolved to libgmp, and libmpir was never even used (not even added as a `DT_NEEDED` entry).  However due to subtle linking differences in Cygwin (that I have no worked out the specifics of), some symbols end up being found in libgmp while most others are found in libmpir, and the resulting executables end up loading both.

This is related to #21174, but not necessarily dependent.  Not sure whether or not this is worth reporting upstream.

<a id='comment:6'></a>Note that #17254 upgrades Singular to 4.x (but it doesn't seem this ticket will be ready soon).

While (I've heard) a lot has changed in the new Singular version, including the build, I haven't looked at the latter yet.

So we *may* have to apply a similar patch to Singular 4.x as well.

<a id='comment:7'></a>It is still unclear to me why the linker didn't bail out when I built Sage with `--with-mp=gmp` from scratch on a Linux system where MPIR isn't installed.

I also have no traces of MPIR in my Singular build logs even in Sage builds with MPIR.

\\

And btw., unless you specify `--as-needed`, any shared library you give on the linker command line will appear as a dependency in the shared library or program you create, no matter whether any symbol from it is referenced or not, provided the library can be found of course.  (This may be the default on some systems though.)

AFAIK on Cygwin static import libraries are used, where in principle only object files with referenced symbols should get included into the link (unless one specifies `--whole-archive`).

Ok, looking closer, the `configure` check for FLINT simply failed (because of the `-lmpir`), and Singular "silently" got built without FLINT, without me ever noticing. XD

Trying again I have to take that back; no idea how, but I somehow must have misgrepped `mpir`, or accidentally only searched Sage trees that were in fact built with GMP, searched all logs but Singular's was deleted, or whatever.  When building with MPIR, `-lmpir` is of course there.

So more or less incidentally, this ticket will also fix that when configuring Sage with `--with-mp=gmp`, currently Singular gets built without (using) FLINT. :-)

The `-p1` when patching (I think).

Looks like you didn't put `latest/` in when creating the patches.

(Just try `head build/pkgs/singular/patches/*.patch`.)
