I would say parents should only compare equal if they are the same (in which sense ?).

Converting to `__richcmp__` seems to be causing problems with pickling.

I have currently no idea what to do, but this is standing on our **long** way to py3.

In Parent, we only have `_cmp_` which calls `__cmp__` and `_richcmp` which call `_cmp_`

I think one should add there a `_richcmp_` (possibly replacing the existing `_richcmp`) that first tries to call `__richcmp__` and then falls back to calling `__cmp__`.

Should this be looked at in #22029 or in a new ticket ?
