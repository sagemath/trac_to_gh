*I ran into an unexpected error in `EllipticCurve_from_cubic`, with the following cubic and rational point:*

```python
R.<x,y,z> = QQ[]
cubic = -3*x^2*y + 3*x*y^2 + 4*x^2*z + 4*y^2*z - 3*x*z^2 + 3*y*z^2 - 8*z^3
EllipticCurve_from_cubic(cubic, (-4/5, 4/5, 3/5))
```
*Note that it works as expected using instead the different rational point `(1, 1, 0)`.*

*On investigation, I found there is a case that isn’t handled correctly. The code computes*

```python
P2 = chord_and_tangent(F, P)
```
*and if `P2` is projectively equivalent to `P` then it uses a different algorithm. If they’re different, it then computes*

```python
P3 = chord_and_tangent(F, P2)
```
*and uses an algorithm that fails if `P3` is equivalent to `P2`.*

*I think the attached patch fixes this problem. At least, with this patch it now works for my examples.*
