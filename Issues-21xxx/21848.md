The failure looks like this:

```

```

with several more undefined references, all of which look like they belong to readline.

Manually adding `-lreadline` worked around the problem, but I haven't looked deeply into why this is needed.

Now I'm also getting similar problems with functions from omalloc:

```

```

This one is a bit simpler I think--`-lomalloc` should be coming after `-lSingular` if there are symbols in libSingular that need to be resolved in libomalloc.  We've had issues like this before on Cygwin.

Not sure why `-lreadline` was needed though when it wasn't needed elsewhere.

Depends on #21957

I think, at a bare minimum, the `LT_INIT` calls in all the `configure.ac`s in singular should look like:

```
LT_INIT([win32-dll])

in order to support properly linking and building DLLs with libtool on Windows.

The problems with the Singular build go quite deep.  There are several issues, but chief among them is a bit of carelessness when linking the numerous libraries that make up Singular.  This carelessness can be forgiven, because on Linux it's perfectly valid to leave some symbols unresolved at link time for shared libraries.  Windows, unfortunately, is much stricter about this and requires every symbol in a DLL to be resolved at link time, and there are a number of examples of this.

libtool, meanwhile, is a bit overly aggressive and will refuse to build a shared lib if it even *thinks* there are symbols that won't be resolved at link time, but I think it can be mistaken about this sometimes (I'm not sure exactly why).  For example, in the case of libresources above, it only depends on libc, but libtool still complains (even though it will be linked with libc automatically).
