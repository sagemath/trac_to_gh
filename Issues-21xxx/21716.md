I'm so confused...

One says to cite like

```
[Sage] William A. Stein et al., Sage Mathematics Software (Version 4.3).
       The Sage Development Team, 2009, http://www.sagemath.org.
```
the other 

```
SageMath, the Sage Mathematics Software System (Version x.y.z),
   The Sage Developers, YYYY, https://www.sagemath.org.
```
and as far as I understand #27663 doesn't address this at all.
