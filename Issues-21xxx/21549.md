The Sage-in-Emacs interface `sage-mode` is broken since IPython 5.0, see #21227. `sage-shell-mode` by stakemori is a very good alternative. This is distributed using the Emacs package manager MELPA, which should be familiar to any Emacs user (in both senses of the word "should"), so there is no real reason to distribute that with Sage or even have an spkg for it.

The suggestion is therefore simply to remove `sage-mode` as an optional package from Sage.
