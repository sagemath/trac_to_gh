I am not claiming that. I am adding `# known bug`, which means that I agree that there is a problem somewhere.

Of course, if the real bug can be fixed, that would be better. But in the mean time, just to have all doctests formally passing (and make a 32-bit patchbot useful), I propose to add the `# known bug`.

If Mathias is OK with that, i am also in favor to set this ticket to positive review (i confirm that the patch fixes the doctest on my 32bit VM).

If someone has an idea where the bug comes from and how to fix it, that would be great.
