I am not claiming that. I am adding `# known bug`, which means that I agree that there is a problem somewhere.

Of course, if the real bug can be fixed, that would be better. But in the mean time, just to have all doctests formally passing (and make a 32-bit patchbot useful), I propose to add the `# known bug`.
