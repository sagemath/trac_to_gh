Which of the following exits your shell?

```sh
exit 1 | exit 0

exit 0 | exit 1

exit 1 | exit 1

exit 0 | exit 0
```
*(The answer is "none of them".)*

To test this, do for example:

```sh
mkdir build/pkgs/broken_package
./configure && echo Apparently no error.
echo broken > build/pkgs/broken_package/type
./configure && echo Apparently no error.
```
Optionally take a look at `build/make/Makefile`...

Then pull the branch here, run `autoconf`, and retry the above (perhaps first after having done `rm -r build/pkgs/broken_package`).

Well, that's standard(ized) (Bourne) shell behavior.

Even if we keep it in `configure[.ac]`, the shell functions could be improved (e.g. not rereading the folders and files five times).  But we could of course use Python there as well, where it (creating the Makefile) IMHO belongs.

Note that while we meanwhile require a system python, AFAICS there's not a single test for python in `configure`yet.

P.S.:  You have similar problems in functional languages or attribute grammars, without global variables (Pfui anyway) and without passing pointers or references for results... ;-)

So the shell's behavoir appears to be good, the problem being that not everybody's aware of when subshells (with their own environment) are invoked.

I think this makes it even more unlikely people will notice *warnings* etc. from `configure`.

I've opened [ticket:21116 a follow-up] for a couple of improvements to `configure`.

Not intended for rewriting it in Python though. ;-)
