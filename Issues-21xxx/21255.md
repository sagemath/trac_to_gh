Right now a `Cone` is not a parent, and it does not have a specific category.

```
sage: C = Cone([[1,0], [1,5]])
sage: C.category()
Category of objects
```
I am wondering whether suitable categories, such as `SemiModules` (here, using the monoid of nonnegative integers), `Cones` (nonnegative reals), ... should be set up.
This category framework should then be general enough to represent other (non-polyhedral) cones, such as the cone of convex functions of a real variable; the cone of semidefinite matrices; etc.

Also, there should be a method to create the affine semigroup of the integer points in a cone (its generators are computed by the method `semigroup_generators`) as a monoid.

Thanks for sharing this perspective and background. However it seems that it is a goal in Sage that "every set should be a parent".

I'm afraid the project is a bit short on policies. It's what I gathered from reading http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/categories/sage/categories/primer.html, https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/CategoriesRoadMap etc. and looking at various examples such as posets.

Hoping that people familiar with the category framework can help to clarify.

> Does it cover subsets of bigger sets? I.e. if I have a bunch of subsets of some set S, should elements of each of these subsets have different parents rather than S? Seems quite odd to me. 

It's already the case as soon as the subsets have enough (algebraic) structure. Example, for point lattices:

```
sage: L1 = (QQ^2).span([[1, 6], [1,0]], ZZ)
sage: L2 = (QQ^2).span([[1, 3], [1,0]], ZZ)
sage: L1.0
(1, 0)
sage: L2.0
(1, 0)
sage: L1.0 == L2.0
True
sage: L1.0.parent()

Free module of degree 2 and rank 2 over Integer Ring
Echelon basis matrix:
[1 0]
[0 6]
sage: L2.0.parent()

Free module of degree 2 and rank 2 over Integer Ring
Echelon basis matrix:
[1 0]
[0 3]
```
I guess in the end the question is: Do cones have enough structure to warrant similar behavior? The category- and axiom-based inheritance of methods, including _test_* methods, seems quite attractive to me, and it would be nice if cones could benefit from this infrastructure.

> What about parents for operations? Should adding two points belonging to two cones result in constructing the Minkowski sum cone where the result is guaranteed to live???

It sounds a bit excessive, but that matches the sound of the word "pushout".

If you want to consider a cone is considered as a set of objects (i.e., an object in a concrete category), then it should be a `Parent` and the elements should be a subclass of `Element`. If you want to consider them in some objects in a non-concrete category, then I think they should just be a `CategoryObject` (where we would need to add support for `ObjectMethods`, but you can work around this for now with an ABC). Be warned, we have yet to really include non-concrete categories, so you are wondering into the wilderness here.

A facade parent `P` is for when the elements of `P` would more naturally belong to another parent, but you want to construct them through `P`.

However, it seems the idea is to consider cones as a vector space but over a semiring (more explicitly, an additive monoid with a distributive multiplicative structure). Perhaps a more simple question, is every module over a (commutative?) ring/field a cone?

The pushout construction of Sage should work well if you do want to have compatible arithmetic and coercion.
