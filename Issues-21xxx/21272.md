Have you considered turning `__u` into a sparse polynomial, shifting it, and computing the hash from there? I guess that would be my only proposal here to remove a duplication of code. But it is probably not worth it. Your tests should catch any changes in the implementation of the hash function of polynomials…

Converting the data structure at the time of the hash is not a good idea (time costly). Is this what you were proposing? On the other hand, modifying the internal data structure of laurent polynomials is beyond the scope of this ticket.
