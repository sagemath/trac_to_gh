Have you considered turning `__u` into a sparse polynomial, shifting it, and computing the hash from there? I guess that would be my only proposal here to remove a duplication of code. But it is probably not worth it. Your tests should catch any changes in the implementation of the hash function of polynomialsâ¦

Converting the data structure at the time of the hash is not a good idea (time costly). Is this what you were proposing? On the other hand, modifying the internal data structure of laurent polynomials is beyond the scope of this ticket.
