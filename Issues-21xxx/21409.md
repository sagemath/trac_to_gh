sage -t --long src/sage/matrix/action.pyx
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/matrix/action.pyx", line 331, in sage.matrix.action.VectorMatrixAction._create_codomain
Failed example:
    A = VectorMatrixAction(MatrixSpace(QQ, 3, 5), VectorSpace(CDF, 3)); A
Expected:
    Right action by Full MatrixSpace of 3 by 5 dense matrices over Rational Field on Vector space of dimension 3 over Complex Double Field
Got:
    <repr(<sage.matrix.action.VectorMatrixAction at 0xc87fc76c>) failed: RuntimeError: This action acted on a set that became garbage collected>
**********************************************************************
```
The matrix/vector spaces must be references in the test

Keywords: random_fail
