Apperently something goes wrong when taking the intersection of a polyhedron in RDF and one in QQ:
Q plays the role of box in the function `plot_feasible_set` of `interactive_simplex_method.py`.

Here is a smaller example of the failing intersection between QQ and RDF polyhedra:

```
sage: Q=Polyhedron(ieqs=[[-499999,1000000],[1499999,-1000000]])
sage: P=Polyhedron(ieqs=[[0,1.0],[1.0,-1.0]], base_ring=RDF)
sage: Q.intersection(P)
The empty polyhedron in RDF^1
sage: P.intersection(Q)
A 1-dimensional polyhedron in RDF^1 defined as the convex hull of 2 vertices
sage: Q=Polyhedron(ieqs=[[-4999999,10000000],[14999999,-10000000]])
sage: P.intersection(Q)
``` 
The last command then raises 
`ValueError: *Error: Numerical inconsistency is found.  Use the GMP exact arithmetic.`, which is better than a wrong result, I guess. In any case one should perhaps do the conversions of the base ring more explicitly.


The relevant function in base.py reads:

```       
        new_ieqs = self.inequalities() + other.inequalities()
        new_eqns = self.equations() + other.equations()
        parent = self.parent()
        try:
            return parent.element_class(parent, None, [new_ieqs, new_eqns])
        except TypeError as msg:
            if self.base_ring() is ZZ:
                parent = parent.base_extend(QQ)
                return parent.element_class(parent, None, [new_ieqs, new_eqns])
            else:
                raise TypeError(msg)
```
So in the example above we have in the new_ieqs variable:

```
(An inequality (1.0) x + 0.0 >= 0,
 An inequality (-1.0) x + 1.0 >= 0,
 An inequality (-10000000) x + 14999999 >= 0,
 An inequality (10000000) x - 4999999 >= 0)
```
Which leads to the unexpected behaviour

This commit fixes the instances of the problem, that I added. 

The original thing is still not working, but this is now another bug (more later).

    "body": "<a id='comment:13'></a>\nI submitted a fix to this bug. \n\n\nExplanation:\nWhat went wrong was was happens if a polyhedron in `QQ` is intersection with a polyhedron in `RDF`; basically it takes the union of the inequalities. The inequalities are typically stored as linear inequality with coefficients in `ZZ`. Those coefficients can get very large and cause numerical trouble when converted to `RDF`. Thus it is advisable to convert the inequalities to `RDF` only after some renormalization. We choose to divide all terms of the inequality by the absolute values of the coefficient with the largest absolute value. (In case all the coefficients are zero, we leave it as is.)\n\nThis helped with the examples above. In the original question there was another problem: in the method `_solve` of the class `InteractiveLPProblem(` in the `interactive_simplex_method.py` file, taking the base ring to be something other than the base ring of the feasible region (which might have been coerced to something else) caused trouble. I changed this by simply setting \n\n```\nR = F.base_ring()\n```\n\nThen I was able to produce the plot.",

I submitted a fix to this bug. 


Explanation:
What went wrong was was happens if a polyhedron in `QQ` is intersection with a polyhedron in `RDF`; basically it takes the union of the inequalities. The inequalities are typically stored as linear inequality with coefficients in `ZZ`. Those coefficients can get very large and cause numerical trouble when converted to `RDF`. Thus it is advisable to convert the inequalities to `RDF` only after some renormalization. We choose to divide all terms of the inequality by the absolute values of the coefficient with the largest absolute value. (In case all the coefficients are zero, we leave it as is.)

This helped with the examples above. In the original question there was another problem: in the method `_solve` of the class `InteractiveLPProblem(` in the `interactive_simplex_method.py` file, taking the base ring to be something other than the base ring of the feasible region (which might have been coerced to something else) caused trouble. I changed this by simply setting 

```
R = F.base_ring()
```

Then I was able to produce the plot.
