Hello Édouard,

As you just fixed an error related to the indentation level, 
I think it's fine if you complete the review process yourself.
It's not a fundamental change, so it's fine `:)`

That may be the right thing to do yes. You may replace the whole block of doctests by something like

```python
Note that since ticket :trac:`21326`, codes cannot be of length zero::

    sage: G = Matrix(GF(17),[])
    sage: C = LinearCode(G)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    ValueError: length must be a non-zero positive integer
```

My only hesitation is whether the presence of these doctests in `src/sage/coding/encoder.py` are a indication that codes of length zero may be useful to have. I really have no idea what this should be, but you may asked David or Johan just to be sure.

Actually, I asked David and Johan before doing this method.
So, it's ok, the block of doctests can be replaced by what you propose.
