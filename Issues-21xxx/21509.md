-fbissey [proposes](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/21480#comment:88) to install `cython_debug` somewhere in `SAGE_LOCAL` because it is needed for debugging at runtime.
+1. Store `cython_debug` in `site-packages/sage/cython_debug` instead of in the Cython build directory.
 
-This depends on #24690 which installs the source files in `site-packages`. The debugging information should probably also be stored there.
+2. Upgrade cysignals.
 
-We shouldn't be relying on the sources or the source directories at runtime. In distros most debugging info is usually striped from the runtime executables and libraries and loaded on demand from a central location. We should similarly install this debugging info rather than keeping it in the source tree.
