I ran into an unexpected error in `EllipticCurve_from_cubic`, with the following cubic and rational point:

```
sage: R.<x,y,z> = QQ[]
sage: cubic = -3*x^2*y + 3*x*y^2 + 4*x^2*z + 4*y^2*z - 3*x*z^2 + 3*y*z^2 - 8*z^3
sage: EllipticCurve_from_cubic(cubic, (-4/5, 4/5, 3/5))
```

Note that it works as expected using instead the different rational point (1, 1, 0).

On investigation, I found there is a case that isn’t handled correctly. The code computes

```
P2 = chord_and_tangent(F, P)
```
and if P2 is projectively equivalent to P then it uses a different algorithm. If they’re different, it then computes

```
P3 = chord_and_tangent(F, P2)
```
and uses an algorithm that fails if P3 is equivalent to P2.

I think the attached patch fixes this problem. At least, with this patch it now works for my examples.

Best wishes,
Robin

While waiting for the branch to build I am looking at the code more.  (I am happy that the patch fixes the bug but...)

It is easy to find any rational flexes (there are 0, 1 or 3):

```
C = Curve(cubic)
hessian_pol = Matrix([[cubic.derivative(v1, v2) for v1 in R.gens()] for v2 in R.gens()]).det()
H = Curve(hessian_pol)
flexes = C.intersection(H).rational_points()
```
and simpler code would (1) test if P is a flex (iff it is on the Hessian), use it if so; else (2) look for any rational flexes and use one instead if they exist; else (3) use the generic case of what is here already.

Something else about the documentation:  assuming that C is smooth, its Jacobian J is an elliptic curve whether or not C has a rational point, and (as already observed) the Jacobian can be constructed using a different function.  But of course unless C has a rational point, C and J cannot be isomorphic.  The Jacobian() function seems to do everything one would want here:

```
sage: Jacobian(cubic, curve=Curve(cubic))

Scheme morphism:
  From: Projective Plane Curve over Rational Field defined by -3*x^2*y + 3*x*y^2 + 4*x^2*z + 4*y^2*z - 3*x*z^2 + 3*y*z^2 - 8*z^3
  To:   Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 = x^3 - 2353/3*x + 227950/27 over Rational Field
  Defn: Defined on coordinates by sending (x : y : z) to
...
```
and the only point about supplying a point on the original cubic is that you then know that this map is an isomorphism.

Sorry to hear that. I have no idea what you are doing wrong. That never happens to me.

Either you are doing something or there is a genuine bug in Sage. One issue with this ticket is that the branch is based on a very old version. In theory that shouldn't matter, but in practice it probably does.

It would be hard to give a proper reproducible bug report.  From what I remember, I started with a current develop branch in which "make build" runs fine, then checked out the public/21092 branch on this ticket and did "make build" again but that failed, and when I then checked out the develop branch again "make build" failed once again.  I don't think that should happen, but I am quite capable of having done something different in between which would invalidate the report.

That's what I thought.  It might be relevant that this is the same machien where I was trying to install jupyter, jupyter-hub via anaconda and all that, without having much of an idea of what I was doing (the documentation for all that is really bad).

Anyway "make distclean; make build" ran overnight OK and so I do now have a working branch with 8.1.rc2 + the patch from this ticket.

First review pass:

please use `.. NOTE::` in capital

maybe say somewhere that the given point may be ignored if the curve has a rational flex ?

typo `returned cannor be evaluated`

typo `anf the inverse morphism`

typo `will beused as a base`

typo `if not point is given and there are not rational` where not should be no (twice)

In chord_and_tangent, the new doc line is too long (should break at 80 chars)

In chord_and_tangent, I am concerned that the use of rational points may restrict the use of this function to the field QQ.

Everywhere, we need at least one example over QQ[sqrt(5)] for instance. And if possible one over QQ(t) ?

It seems to work fine as it is over finite fields and number fields.  Over Q(t) it doesn't because somehwere (not in this code itself) a polynomial factorization is done which requires "proof=False"; however the old code (before this patch also fails over Q(t) for a quite different and stupid reason (the function `projective_point` fails when the coordinates of points are not integers (or perhaps rationals)!  So this is already better regarding support of base fields other than Q.

All we need do as add the parameter factor=False each time we call `tangents()` and all these cases work fine!

I will prepare the new patch when I can.
