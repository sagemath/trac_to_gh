CC:  @defeo

Several compiler warnings show up when compiling the Cython files in `src/sage/libs/pari`. These can easily be fixed, except for some spurious `-Wmaybe-uninitialized` warnings which come from the `sig_on()` statements.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/21705

You really need to start from a known state, so you omitted an important part: what happened before the `git checkout HEAD^`?

If you really want to diff logs, you should do:

```
export MAKE="make -j1"   # Build serially to have reproducible logs
git checkout t/21705/ticket/21705
make build               # Put the build in a known state, ignore this log
git checkout HEAD^
make build &>log1
git checkout t/21705/ticket/21705
make build &>log2
```
and then compare `log1` and `log2`.

I had made this branch, yes. But you are right, I forgot about `-j1`. I did what you just suggested, and I confirm there are no new warnings.
