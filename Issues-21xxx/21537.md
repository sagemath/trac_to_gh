That would be a solution for those who want to install Sage in a prefix that's only writable by root.

In this way, building can take place in unprivileged user account.

It could perhaps also be enabled by `./configure --enable-sudo-install`. (not on this ticket)

This ticket makes routine changes to all `spkg-install` scripts. Whenever installing has more steps than just `make install`, it moves the install part to a separate script `spkg-do-install`.

*** See #21726 for a slightly different approach ***

Practical matters:
* documentation 
* If you need a password and that the time between sudo-ing is longer than the time out, you will have to insert the password quite a number of times. In the case of a parallel install, will it block output to screen until you have entered the password?

I don't know enough of the mechanics of sage standard output on screen to know how requesting a password will affect the flow.

The problem of parallel output and prompts has been discussed before in #20884, #21082. 
Also #21539 could help.

Right now, in this patch I am calling `spkg-do-install` scripts with `$SAGE_SUDO` from various package's `spkg-install` scripts.
Of course, each package's `spkg-install` script needs to be changed for `$SAGE_SUDO` to work, and installing packages that have not been prepared for it will cause an error when trying to install them to a prefix that is only root-writable.

An "easier" solution would be to just call `spkg-build` if it exists, unprivileged, and then call `spkg-install` using `$SAGE_SUDO`. This would "just work" without making changes to the -- but it would run a lot of stuff as root until a package moves its build part from `spkg-install` to `spkg-build`.

Thoughts?

In general, yes, it should not be a problem.  This does not affect rpath or soname for extension modules--I mean in principle it could but that would be a pathological case the likes of which I've never seen, and that is definitely not supported.

In principle one could also imagine a module that when installed generates some files containing hard-coded paths, but can't think of anything like that.  Most well made Python modules are good about keeping such things relative and dynamic.  So I'd be surprised if that's a problem anywhere, though if it is obviously exceptions can be made.

(**Update:** In fact, I should add, this is how distutils builds packages normally anyways--first it builds everything to `build/`, and then simply copies from there directly to the install location--what I described simply adds one additional copy.  All the "install" commands really do in distutils is copy files--all the real work should usually be done in the "build" command (or sub-commands thereof).)
