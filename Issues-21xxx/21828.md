Sage on OpenSuSE 42.2 (built from scratch with internal gcc-4.9 and 5.4) crashes on the command `Poset().is_incomparable_chain_free(1,1)`. Reason is there is no check in the `SubgraphSearch` member functions for an empty graph, so happily unallocated memory is changed in `_initialization()`.

This was discovered because of several failing doctests on OpenSuSE, presumably because of the system's more stringent memory model.
