Sage on OpenSuSE 42.2 (built from scratch with internal gcc-4.9 and 5.4) crashes on the command `Poset().is_incomparable_chain_free(1,1)`. Reason is there is no check in the `SubgraphSearch` member functions for an empty graph, so happily unallocated memory is changed in `_initialization()`.

This was discovered because of several failing doctests on OpenSuSE, presumably because of the system's more stringent memory model.

1. `MemoryAllocator` raises exceptions when out of memory, so the `NULL` checks are no longer needed.

2. I'm surprised that `for 0 < i < self.ng` is legal Cython syntax. Cython understands `for i in range(1, self.ng)` though. To be safe, you may want to add `cdef int i`.

3. My impression is that `self.ng` is constant. So I don't understand code of the form

```
if self.ng == 0:
   raise StopIteration
....
if self.ng > 0: ...
```
Isn't the latter trivially true?
