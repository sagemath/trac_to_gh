In Cython, it depends on whether the loop variable is *typed* or *untyped*. Typed means something like

```
cdef long i
for i in range(...):
    ...
```

For *untyped* variables, Cython does no special optimization. In this case, you can do the same as for Python.

For *typed* variables, `range()` is the same as `xrange()`. But `six.moves.range` is a lot slower.

Finally, let me add that Cython understands `xrange()`. So there is not even a need to get rid of `xrange()` in Cython files.

So a concrete suggestion for this ticket would be:

- keep the replacements `range()` -> `list(range())`.

- keep all changes to doctests.

- undo the changes to `xrange()` in Cython code.

- remove all imports of `six.moves.range` in Cython code.


I'm sorry to set a positive_review ticket back to needs_work, but I really feel that this ticket was done too quickly. Remember that Cython and Python are different programming languages (which happen to have a similar syntax for convenience).
