Would it be beneficial to expand a rational polytope so that its points are integral, and then filter out the points which would not be integers upon shrinking?

I'm guessing the way to check for translates of a rational/lattice polytope is to actually look at the differences of the vertices relative to a fixed vertex?

Yes, that could be a simple technique that would require only small changes of the code.
The normaliz manual (https://www.normaliz.uni-osnabrueck.de/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Normaliz3.1.1Documentation.pdf, page 64, section 6.1) explains an "approximation technique" similar to this idea.

It is explained, for example, in http://www.combinatorics.org/ojs/index.php/eljc/article/view/v15i1r16/pdf Lemma 11.

Thank you for the reference. Do you think you could provide this implementation? I am pretty sure I could do the first half above.

This should have low priority until someone "really" wants to do computations with semirational polytopes.
For the more common case of rational polytopes, with MUCH less effort one can make an "easy" implementation of a normaliz interface (using file passing instead of using libnormaliz).
