<a id='comment:10'></a>This should now be ready for review, except for the root issue.

The problem with canonical labeling is that we use the canonical labelling of the **graph**, not the one of the tree. So we cannot assume that the root has number 0.

I don't necessarily see why this wouldn't work, but maybe I'm missing something.

We should also changed the `show` to `plot` inside the method (which will re-introduce output).

I only see the unicode trees in the unicode art, so I am not surprised this doesn't make a difference. I think it would be something we'd need to setup with the pdf builder, and I think that's more trouble than its worth right now.
