Automatic evaluation of symbolic expressions of "numerics" prevents construction of such expressions despite them being perfectly numerically approximatable (or otherwise useful) if exact evaluation in the algebraic sense fails. This is usually not a problem with function expressions (because of the easily added `hold=True`), and sums and products (?), but powers have to be constructed awkwardly:

```
            sage: SR(2) ^ SR(QQbar(sqrt(2)))
            Traceback (most recent call last):
            ...
            TypeError: no canonical coercion ...
            sage: SR(2).power(SR(QQbar(sqrt(2))), hold=True)
            2^1.414213562373095?
```

The ticket catches `TypeError`s in the first case and automatically uses the second form, to allow:

```
            sage: SR(2) ^ SR(QQbar(sqrt(2)))
            2^1.414213562373095?
```

```
sage: a = 2 ^ pi.sqrt() + 1
sage: a
2^sqrt(pi) + 1
sage: a.n()
4.41634542118404
```
And why is `pi` not numeric?

``` 
sage: pi.is_numeric()
False

Because traditionally in Pynac all Python objects that can't be converted to Pynac objects are wrapped inside a `numeric` object. Constants can be converted and are handled correctly. That's why pi is non-numeric.
