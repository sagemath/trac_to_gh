This can cause subtle bugs with comparisons between wrapped elements of a poset, which might not be given by the poset. We fix this and the triangularity issue that was hacked around in #21054, which introduced this problem.

See the discussion on #21054.

Great job! Two things, though:

- I suggest replacing the doc of `_Key` by something more readable:

```
    Helper class to serve as a key for comparing elements of the
    lattice.

    The change-of-basis morphisms between the bases of the
    :class:`MoebiusAlgebra` are triangular with respect to the partial
    order of the poset. Since this partial order might not agree with
    the standard comparison function ``cmp``, we need a wrapper around
    the elements of the lattice which ensures that calling ``cmp`` on
    them (when wrapped) actually compares them using the lattice's
    partial order. This helper class is precisely that.
```
(You probably can do better.)

- Do we know that whatever the `module_morphism` infrastructure does to `key` allows `key` to live in a poset? I see `leading_item` being called in https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/develop/src/sage/modules/with_basis/morphism.py ; what does this return when there are several maximal items?

Thank you for looking at this.

I made that a lot shorter because (IMO) this class does not deserve any real documentation because it is hidden from the doc and never exposed to the user. You are only going to see this if you are looking at the code, but it is clear from the code what this class does. I feel it is just an implementation detail because of how we handle posets.

There is only one maximal element because the Möbius algebra is only defined for lattices.
