This can cause subtle bugs with comparisons between wrapped elements of a poset, which might not be given by the poset. We fix this and the triangularity issue that was hacked around in #21054, which introduced this problem.

See the discussion on #21054.

Great job! Two things, though:

- I suggest replacing the doc of `_Key` by something more readable:

```
    Helper class to serve as a key for comparing elements of the
    lattice.

    The change-of-basis morphisms between the bases of the
    :class:`MoebiusAlgebra` are triangular with respect to the partial
    order of the poset. Since this partial order might not agree with
    the standard comparison function ``cmp``, we need a wrapper around
    the elements of the lattice which ensures that calling ``cmp`` on
    them (when wrapped) actually compares them using the lattice's
    partial order. This helper class is precisely that.
```
(You probably can do better.)

- Do we know that whatever the `module_morphism` infrastructure does to `key` allows `key` to live in a poset? I see `leading_item` being called in https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/develop/src/sage/modules/with_basis/morphism.py ; what does this return when there are several maximal items?

There is only one maximal element because the MÃ¶bius algebra is only defined for lattices.

Sorry, I am about to take off for vacations and was busy with preparation. I just had a look at the code. I believe the key function, should really just be an ranker according to the default linear extension. Luckily, I just remembered that we already had rankers as a picklable object:

```
sage: key = sage.combinat.ranker.rank_from_list(['a', 'b', 'c'])
sage: key('b')
1
sage: loads(dumps(key))
{'a': 0, 'c': 2, 'b': 1}
sage: key == loads(dumps(key))
True
