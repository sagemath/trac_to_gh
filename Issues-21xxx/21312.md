Thanks for this fix; at first glance it looks ok to me, I will try to give it a more in-depth review soon.

On a related topic: in my usual testing example I get a major slowdown replacing my custom made iterator with a `RecursivelyEnumeratedSet`. To explore a 8-regular graph with 25080 vertices it takes 54.6 seconds as opposed to 29.9. I am not sure if this depends on the `__hash__` function I implemented or to the fact that I am a little bit more careful on which edges I travel along and which I can disregard a priori.

Another thing: maybe `depth_first_search_iterator` can be tweaked not to compute a whole graded component before returning. I have half and idea on how to do this, let me carefully think if it is feasible.

If you can provide a working example illustrating this, I will be curious in investigating it.

To get the example I am thinking about you need to merge in #21254 and #19538.
Then

```
sage: A = ClusterAlgebra(['E',8])
sage: %time A.explore_to_depth(infinity)
CPU times: user 27.1 s, sys: 215 ms, total: 27.3 s
Wall time: 27.2 s
```
and

```
sage: A = ClusterAlgebra(['E',8])
sage: seeds = RecursivelyEnumeratedSet([A.initial_seed()], lambda S:
[S.mutate(i,inplace=False) for i in range(8)], structure='symmetric')
sage: %time  len(list(seeds))
CPU times: user 54.1 s, sys: 68 ms, total: 54.1 s
Wall time: 54.1 s
25080
```
(you need to recreate `A` because it keeps track of few computationally
intense bits).

The speedup I get, I think, depend mostly on line 1961 and partly on line 1968
of cluster_algebra.py. The first makes sure that once an edge is known we do not
walk it twice, the second enforces the fact that we only need to walk three
sides of a square.

In my experience, this kind of thing can be done by adding information into the nodes:

```
A = ClusterAlgebra(['E',8])
initial_node = tuple(A.initial_seed(), -1)
initial_nodes = [initial_node]
def succ(node):
    S, i = node
    allowed_directions = range(i+1, 8)
    return [(S.mutate(j,inplace=False),j) for j in allowed_directions]
seeds = RecursivelyEnumeratedSet(initial_nodes, succ, structure='symmetric')
```
Then `post_process` can return only the interesting part (at least now for forest, it works) of each node.

But I can't say if such an approach could work in your case.

The speedup seems to be very close to a factor of 2.

Commenting out line 1961 and changing line 1968 as you suggest makes `explore_to_depth` slower but not 2 times slower. With this change, using `RecursivelyEnumeratedSet` is about 15% slower :

```python
sage: from pandas import DataFrame
sage: df = DataFrame(index="E6 E7 E8".split())
sage: df['explore_to_depth'] = [2.53, 15.8, 124.]
sage: df['rec_enum_set'] = [2.91, 18.5, 141.]
sage: df['ratio'] = df.rec_enum_set / df.explore_to_depth
sage: df
    explore_to_depth      rec_enum_set             ratio
E6  2.53000000000000  2.91000000000000  1.15019762845850

E8  124.000000000000  141.000000000000  1.13709677419355
```

Are there other hypothesis you are using on the structure of the graph?

I do not think I am using any other assumption.

Note that the main loop I would write without using the assumptions above would be

```
while gets_bigger and depth_counter < kwargs.get('depth', infinity):
     # remember if we got a new seed
     gets_bigger = False

     for key in clusters.keys():
         sd, directions = clusters[key]
         while directions:
             # we can mutate in some direction
             i = directions.pop()
             new_sd  = sd.mutate(i, inplace=False, mutating_F=mutating_F)
             new_cl = frozenset(new_sd.g_vectors())
             if not new_cl in clusters:
                 # we got a new seed
                 gets_bigger = True
                 # next round do not mutate back to sd and do commuting mutations only in directions j > i
                 new_directions = [ j for j in allowed_dirs if j != i ]
                 clusters[new_cl] = [ new_sd, new_directions ]
                 yield new_sd
     # we went one step deeper
     depth_counter += 1
```
which should be slightly faster than the version you tested because it does not
run the useless line

```
j = map(tuple,clusters[new_cl][0].g_vectors()).index(new_sd.g_vector(i))
```

I had already commented that line in my previous post, also since commenting only line 1961 gives a syntax error. The only difference with your suggestion was that I was using

```python
new_directions = [ j for j in allowed_dirs if j != i or new_sd.b_matrix()[j,i] != 0 ]
```
instead of

```python
new_directions = [ j for j in allowed_dirs if j != i ]
```

An hypothesis that we can't do right now inside the code of `RecursivelyEnumeratedSet` with symmetric structure since if `y in succ(x)`, then we can't assume that

```python
list(succ(x)).index(y) == list(succ(y)).index(x)
```
Also, the graph might not be k-regular (to make sure, that is the number of outgoing edges being constant).

But we can use that hypothesis in the `succ` function:

```python
sage: A = ClusterAlgebra(['E',6])
sage: def succ(S):
....:     p = S.path_from_initial_seed()
....:     i = p[-1] if p else -1
....:     return [S.mutate(j,inplace=False) for j in range(6) if j != i]
sage: seeds = RecursivelyEnumeratedSet([A.initial_seed()], succ, structure='symmetric')
sage: %time len(list(seeds))
CPU times: user 2.69 s, sys: 200 ms, total: 2.89 s
Wall time: 2.75 s
833
```

With this new `succ` function and removing the part `or new_sd.b_matrix()[j,i] != 0`, the ratio become about 5% slower using `RecursivelyEnumeratedSet` :

```python
sage: from pandas import DataFrame
sage: df = DataFrame(index="E6 E7 E8".split())
sage: df['explore_to_depth'] = [2.61, 16.1, 121.]
sage: df['rec_enum_set'] = [2.75, 16.9, 128.]
sage: df['ratio'] = df.rec_enum_set / df.explore_to_depth
sage: df
    explore_to_depth      rec_enum_set             ratio
E6  2.61000000000000  2.75000000000000  1.05363984674330
E7  16.1000000000000  16.9000000000000  1.04968944099379
E8  121.000000000000  128.000000000000  1.05785123966942

Meanwhile, I was managed to use the second assumption (if I am not mistaken):

```python
sage: A = ClusterAlgebra(['E',8])
sage: allowed_dirs = range(8)
sage: def succ(S):
....:     p = S.path_from_initial_seed()

....:         i = p[-1]
....:         L = []
....:         for j in allowed_dirs:

....:              if j > i or new_sd.b_matrix()[j,i] != 0:
....:                  L.append(new_sd)
....:         return L
....:     else:
....:         return [S.mutate(j,inplace=False) for j in allowed_dirs]
sage: seeds = RecursivelyEnumeratedSet([A.initial_seed()], succ) # not symmetric anymore right?
```

but I do not get any significant improvement compare to just avoid branches `j!=i` :

```python
sage: %time len(list(seeds))
CPU times: user 2min 8s, sys: 605 ms, total: 2min 8s
Wall time: 2min 8s
25080
```

which is the same (128 s) as above.

I don't know if we can make the first assumption cleanly into the function `succ` (difficult to understand line 1959), but maybe the Recursively Enumerated Set class can be changed (or copied and changed) so that  the [line](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/master/src/sage/sets/recursively_enumerated_set.pyx#L1032) does: if `y in B` then change `y` so that we do not go to `x` when we visit `y`.

We should test if it works and if it is worth it, and if so, create a new ticket for it.

> PS: This ticket was meant to solve an issue and we are discussing something else. I guess we better leave this open till we are done.

I agree. I wait for a review of this ticket then:)

No problem. `RecursivelyEnumeratedSet` should be fast so that people really want to use it. So your example raises good questions.

Positive review.

It does make sense for code such as #21254 to use `RecursivelyEnumeratedSet` just because it is useless to keep reinventing the wheel each time. Moreover it offers quite a lot of useful features. 

Two consideration about speed: 

1) I guess there are several use cases in which the function `succ` is expensive but it is not too expensive, once a duplicate element has been found, to trim the directions in which `succ` is computed. This is the case, for example, of the code we discussed. It could be useful if `RecursivelyEnumeratedSet` could take a second function as input that is called each time a new element in the set is found and that takes care of pruning the search tree accordingly.

2) how essential is the `'forest'` requirement to the parallelized map/reduce? The code we discussed could benefit much from this.

It is essential. I'm planning to write some analogous code for directed
acyclic graph, but this need to completely rethink the algorithm. If I manage,
there certainly will be two independent codes for forests and DAGs. And there
is a good change that the DAG code will be less efficient.

Using the forest hypothesis, a work stealing algorithm allows the perform the
computation with minimal communications. This is crucial because in Python,
communication are done interprocess through pickling, so that they are quite
slow. For DAGs, you need a strategy to ensure that two differents processes
are not computing the same nodes...

That's a bummer! I am not sure DAGs would could be used in my case either.

One stray thought: can you use hashes for communication rather than the whole objects? You could get some mileage from the fact that you will be pickling a smaller amount of data.
