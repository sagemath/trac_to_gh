The Sphinx-generated documentation has index files for modules. E.g. looking at http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/a_tour_of_sage/py-modindex.html

Checking upon the first link in this list, it points to a non-existing page. It seems like as if sphinx doesn't correctly cross link to a sibling. I.e. instead of `/html/en/a_tour_of_sage/...`

http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/a_tour_of_sage/algebras/sage/algebras/affine_nil_temperley_lieb.html#module-sage.algebras.affine_nil_temperley_lieb

it should be `/html/en/reference/...`

http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/algebras/sage/algebras/affine_nil_temperley_lieb.html#module-sage.algebras.affine_nil_temperley_lieb

Upstream (Sphinx) fix:
- pull request: https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/pull/2816
- released in: Sphinx 1.4.6
- corresponding Sphinx upgrade in Sage: #22252

As I found [on the mailing list](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/3nl4vQWgWog/qI562OupBAAJ), I encountered this problem in the doctests, with an incorrect link being generated for `sage.rings.padics.tutorial`.

This behavior can be explained in part by [this comment](https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/blob/211fd352ae80f5c901b5c539a7c86348e8941094/sphinx/ext/intersphinx.py#L315) in the `sphinx.ext.intersphinx` source:

```
        # Duplicate values in different inventories will shadow each
        # other; which one will override which can vary between builds
        # since they are specified using an unordered dict.  To make
        # it more consistent, we sort the named inventories and then
        # add the unnamed inventories last.  This means that the
        # unnamed inventories will shadow the named ones but the named
        # ones can still be accessed when the name is specified.
```

In my specific case, entries for `sage.rings.padics.tutorial` are showing up in the `objects.inv` for each of 

```
/home/embray/src/sagemath/sage-cygwin/local/share/doc/sage/html/en/reference/plotting
/home/embray/src/sagemath/sage-cygwin/local/share/doc/sage/html/en/reference/padics
/home/embray/src/sagemath/sage-cygwin/local/share/doc/sage/html/en/reference/plot3d	
```

Since these are stored as keys in a dict the order can nondeterministic.  In my case `plot3d` ends up being last.

What's still mysterious is why `sage.rings.padics.tutorials` would even have reference in the plotting or plot3d docs' objects.inv.  Neither of those documents even reference it.

Incidentally when I run my serial docs build, `plot3d` and `plotting` are built immediately after `padics`.

If I understand the build system right, however, each sub-document should be built in its own sphinx environment.  Yet it seems as if there's some "leaking" between the environments during the initial pass, and this shouldn't happen.

After building Sage and the documentation with this branch, I randomly tested links in `py-modindex.html` files and didn't find any bad links. Needless to say, there is now no such file in either `html/en/a_tour_of_sage` as reported above, or in `html/en/thematic_tutorials` as currently appears in Google's webmaster tools.

I don't know enough about this part of Sage to comment on whether this is the best way to fix the problem, but it certainly does appear to deal with the issue. This should really get into 7.4 so that the next version of the documentation will look better to Google. What else needs to be tested for that to happen?
