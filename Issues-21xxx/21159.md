In all linear code classes, constructed generator matrices and parity check matrices are cached for efficiency. However, they are often not immutable, leading to incorrect behaviour if the user inadvertently changes them.

```
sage: C = codes.GeneralizedReedSolomonCode(GF(7).list(), 3)
sage: C.generator_matrix()[0,0] = 0
sage: C.generator_matrix().row(0) in C
False
```

All such cached matrices should be made immutable by `G.set_immutable(True)`.
