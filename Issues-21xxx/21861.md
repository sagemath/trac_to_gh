This patch adds functions to check if the lattice is regular, uniform or isoform.

Second, "backend" functions will make it easier to construct the lattice of congruences.

Third, there was a slight error in `congruence()` of Hasse diagram with `start`-parameter. This patch corrects that.

Related: #20058, #22225, #22238, #22229.

Added.

As you wish, removed. I guess everyone looking at the code can see that there might be a place for optimization.

The question can be phrased like this: "Suppose that the congruence generated by pair (a,b) is regular, and so is the congruence generated by (c,d). Is the congruence generated by both together then also regular?" (And same for uniform and isoform congruences.)
