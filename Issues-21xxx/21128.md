This is meant to improve the way how plain Python modules can use `_richcmp_`.

We need access to the CPython function `PyObject_RichCompare()` which —as far as I know— is not exposed by Python. So we add a Python interface to `PyObject_RichCompare()` called `richcmp()`.

The function `py_rich_to_bool` is not a public function, so I don't think we should do the trouble of deprecating it. But if you insist, I will do that.

It is not clear to me what is a public function. `py_rich_to_bool` is exactly the kind of function that is helpful for external Sage modules. Hence a deprecation seems reasonable to me.

`py_rich_to_bool` is replaced by the existing function `rich_to_bool` and no documentation is lost. The function `richcmp()` is a new function analogous to `cmp()`.

Looks good.

Nevertheless, I would also prefer a deprecation for `py_rich_to_bool`.
