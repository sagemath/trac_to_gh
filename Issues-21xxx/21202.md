None of the below does what k-regular sequence do, so how to accomplish working with k-regular sequences by not adding another class? ;)

To make it clear: A k-regular sequence is a very concrete object with rules how to manipulate them. I am **not** intending to add a kind of **metaclass** for sequences.

> There are already
> - lazy lists in `sage.misc.lazy_list`


Are more like a data structure behind; do not fit into the parent/element scheme of [SageMath](SageMath).

> - words in `sage.combinat.words`


Of course, generalizing words sufficiently, then more or less every sequence is a word. k-regular sequences have values in ZZ or QQ or something else. Moreover, they have a kind of rich arithmetic structure, which has to be implemented.

> - C finite sequence in `sage.rings.cfinite_sequence`


This is probably closest to k-regular sequences, but in some sense, k-regular sequence are more general, in some sense, they are orthogonal to C-finite sequences. Thus this cannot be used very well.

> - paths of directed graphs in `quivers.paths.pyx`


Never seen before, but for sure something different.

> Would be nice to unify them at some point.


I completely agree. Any ideas how to accomplish this? The category framework might help...
