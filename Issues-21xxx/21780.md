The behavior of the method does not correspond to what the documentation says. In the following example, the base ring is not isomorphic at all.

```
sage: P.<x, y, z> = GF(31)[]
sage: F = Sequence([x*y, z])
sage: F.change_ring(ZZ)
[x*y, z]
sage: F.change_ring(ZZ).universe()
Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y, z over Integer Ring
```
As this is the natural behavior for `change_ring`, I would keep it and adapt the documentation.

Hi Vincent,

I see your point. I initially wrote the documentation by referring to the documentation of `change_ring()` in `MPolynomialRing_generic` class

```
sage: P.<x, y, z> = ZZ[]
sage: P.change_ring?
Docstring:
   Return a new multivariate polynomial ring which isomorphic to self,
   but has a different ordering given by the parameter 'order' or
   names given by the parameter 'names'.

   INPUT:

   * "base_ring" -- a base ring

   * "names" -- variable names

   * "order" -- a term order

   EXAMPLES:

      sage: P.<x,y,z> = PolynomialRing(GF(127),3,order='lex')
      sage: x > y^2
      True
      sage: Q.<x,y,z> = P.change_ring(order='degrevlex')
      sage: x > y^2
      False
```
I will make the change in docstring accordingly. But in that case, should the docstring of `change_ring()` of `MPolynomialRing_generic` class must be changed too ? Do you agree ?

Regards,
Rusydi

You are definitely right. It would make sense to also modify the documentation of `MPolynomialRing_generic` accordingly. Could you do it simultaneously in this ticket?

In both docstrings it would be good to say that each argument is optional. Your examples are well chosen to illustrate the behavior.

Note that when `base_ring` is not specified, then the new polynomial ring is actually isomorphic.

I feel this behaviour of `change_ring()` in Ideal, which takes a ring as input, is too restrictive. The main purpose of calling `change_ring()` in `PolynomialSequence()` using optional arguments is to simplify how users can modify a set of polynomials. There should not be any need to explicitly construct a new ring when one only wants to change, say, the term ordering while keeping the rest (variable names and base ring).

Oops!

I don't know why `MPolynomialIdeal.change_ring` was designed this way. We may think of changing it, however this would require a deprecation process.

In my opinion `change_ring` is a misnomer in the first place. It would have been much less error prone to have methods `change_order` and `change_names`, then we would have had no ambiguity on what these methods do.

It might be worth asking on sage-devel what other developers involved in multivariate polynomial rings think of this.

Hello,

Ideals are not restricted to polynomial rings (e.g. order in number
fields). Hence "change_ring" in that case should be generic enough.

For me,
 * it would be better to have "change_ring" consistent everywhere
(possibly using *args and/or **kwds)
 * if not possible, it would be better to have consistency of
"change_ring" for Polynomial, MPolynomial and PolynomialSequence
rather than with ideal

Vincent
```

From Vincent's reply, I dont see any need to make this implementation to be consistent with Ideal. But I have to disagree with his second suggestion because the method `change_ring()` in `Polynomial` and `MPolynomial` has different purpose than I originally intended for `PolynomialSequence`. From the documentation, `change_ring()` in Polynomial and MPolynomial only changes the coefficients. This essentially only change the base ring. So, I don't think this is a good reason to make change_ring() consistent with the one implemented for Polynomial and MPolynomial.

So since `PolynomialSequence` is not as generic as `Ideal` and also with the reason that I mentioned above, I would suggest to keep the patch in this ticket as it is for the moment.

Regards,

{
    "body": "<div id=\"comment:19\" align=\"right\">comment:19</div>\n\nSo, to summarize, there are two different concepts that are called *\"changing ring\"* in Sage:\n\n- Changing the **coefficient** ring (or, more generally, *base ring* in Sage jargon),\n- Changing the **ambient** ring.\n\nDepending on the object, the method `change_ring()` does one or the other. I know by experience that this causes a lot of confusion to students. In my opinion it would have been better to have two different and more explicit names (e.g., `change_base_ring()` and `change_parent_ring()`)\n\nFor **univariate** and **multivariate polynomials** `change_ring()` changes the coefficient ring. Changing the ambient ring is easily done by changing parent:\n\n```\nsage: A.<X> = QQ[]\nsage: X.change_ring(RR).parent()\nUnivariate Polynomial Ring in X over Real Field with 53 bits of precision\nsage: B = QQ['X,Y']\nsage: B(X).parent()\nMultivariate Polynomial Ring in X, Y over Rational Field\n```\n\nFor **ideals of multivariate polynomials** `change_ring()` changes the ambient ring.

So, to summarize, there are two different concepts that are called *"changing ring"* in Sage:

- Changing the **coefficient** ring (or, more generally, *base ring* in Sage jargon),
- Changing the **ambient** ring.

Depending on the object, the method `change_ring()` does one or the other. I know by experience that this causes a lot of confusion to students. In my opinion it would have been better to have two different and more explicit names (e.g., `change_base_ring()` and `change_parent_ring()`)

For **univariate** and **multivariate polynomials** `change_ring()` changes the coefficient ring. Changing the ambient ring is easily done by changing parent:

```
sage: A.<X> = QQ[]
sage: X.change_ring(RR).parent()
Univariate Polynomial Ring in X over Real Field with 53 bits of precision
sage: B = QQ['X,Y']
sage: B(X).parent()
Multivariate Polynomial Ring in X, Y over Rational Field
```

For **ideals of multivariate polynomials** `change_ring()` changes the ambient ring. This can be used to change the coefficient ring too:

```
sage: A.<X,Y> = QQ[]
sage: I = A.ideal(X)
sage: B = QQ['X,Y,Z']
sage: I.change_ring(B).ring()
Multivariate Polynomial Ring in X, Y, Z over Rational Field
sage: C = RR['X,Y']
sage: I.change_ring(C).ring()
Multivariate Polynomial Ring in X, Y over Real Field with 53 bits of precision
```

**Ideals of univariate polynomials** have no `change_ring()` method.

Polynomial sequences are similar to ideals in the fact that **their parent is not the ring**:

```
sage: A.<X,Y> = QQ[]
sage: S = Sequence([X,X^2])
sage: I = S.ideal()
sage: S.parent()
<class 'sage.rings.polynomial.multi_polynomial_sequence.PolynomialSequence_generic'>
sage: I.parent()
Monoid of ideals of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in X, Y over Rational Field
sage: S.ring()
Multivariate Polynomial Ring in X, Y over Rational Field
sage: I.ring()
Multivariate Polynomial Ring in X, Y over Rational Field
```

So we cannot use coercion to change their ambient ring. However polynomial sequences are different from ideals in that they're not an algebraic structure per se; in this respect they are more similar to polynomials.

If we want to be consistent with Vincent's proposal, we should make polynomial sequences behave as much as possible like polynomials. To that extent:

- the `parent()` of a polynomial sequence should be the ring,
- `change_ring()` should change the **coefficient ring**.

Note that in this case the only way to change the **ambient ring** would be a list comprehension, or something similar.

If we want to be consistent with my proposal, we should make polynomial sequences behave as much as possible like ideals. To that extent:

- `parent()` will stay not well defined,
- `change_ring()` should change the **ambient ring**.

The **coefficient** ring could then be changed via `change_ring()`, like for ideals.

I say "Vincent's" and "my" proposal, but I'm actually quite undecided myself. I would like if more devs stepped up and gave strong arguments for one or the other. There might also be other objects to keep into account, and inconsistencies I haven't thought of.

In the end, I think my preferred solution would be to deprecate `change_ring()`, and have two methods with more explicit names. This requires even more consensus, however.

P.S.: Sorry for delaying your ticket, @rusydi. It looks like you opened a can of worms :)
