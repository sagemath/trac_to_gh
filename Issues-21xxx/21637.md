With certain operating systems, certain compilers and certain compiler flags (in particular Cygwin with `SAGE_DEBUG=yes`), the PARI function `is_universal_constant()` can be broken. This leads to a `0` return value for closures returning `gnil`:

```
sage: pari("x -> print(x);")("hello")
hello
0
```

**Upstream report**: http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/archives/pari-dev-1610/msg00006.html

This branch simply adds a patch from upstream.

Depends on #21582

**Keywords:** pari windows cygwin

**Branch:** [0e7d231ec555f0c320add18d2cbc75b028cfb510](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/0e7d231ec555f0c320add18d2cbc75b028cfb510)

**Upstream:** Fixed upstream, but not in a stable release.

**Reviewer:** Erik Bray

**Author:** Jeroen Demeyer

I have trouble compiling 7.5beta0 with #20523 (R 3.1.1, *a priori* unrelated), and this patch is the prime suspect.

I'll annotate #20523 (reminder...).

`pari-2.8-2771-gb70b447` is an old version. Please delete that log file such that you are no longer confused by it.

`pari-2.8.0.alpha.p2` is the current version which built correctly. So I see no problem here.

I have already tried that : The damn thing sprouts back (and the error is the same...).

I see it : I've spent a large part of Sunday trying to get 7.5beta0+#20523 to compile, to no avail... the problem comes back even after a `make distclean`.


Currently I'm compiling 7.4+#20523+#a preliminary version of 21744 (not yet pushed), which seems to have passed the critical point. However, each passage from 7.4 to 7.5.beta0 needs >1h to compile (something seems to have radically changed, and I don't see what...).

I'll keep you posted after a `ptestlong` of this 7.4 patched version.

[EDIT] According to [Volker's announcement](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-release/RxGpeK0kMsc), the present patch (#21637) has been added between 7.4 and 7.5beta0... To me, it's newer than 2.8.0.alpha.p2 (which I seem to remember to have seen late 7.4 betas...). Hasn't it been merged in error ? On my workin sage installation(7.4) :

In that case, you are either using an old version of Sage (if so: merge current `develop`) or there is something wrong with your branch (which git branch is that?).

`develop`##20523+#21744 (and, yes, I did `git fetch` and `git pull` before that.

Maybe I should try a fresh tree ?

Double-check that your `develop` branch is really what you think it is (should be `7.5.beta0`). If it is, you somehow messed up the merging of `develop` with those 2 branches.

Starting from a fresh tree, I managed to build and ptestlong successfully (modulo the usual transient error on `simplicial_complex.py`) #20523+#21744 over both 7.4 and 7.5beta0.

I still do not understand how I managed to mess up my previous attempts.
