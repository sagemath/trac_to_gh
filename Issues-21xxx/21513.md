`rst2ipynb` converts rst source to ipynb worksheet.

- upstream tarball : https://pypi.python.org/packages/59/74/ed45a207317c8dbfe987db83841ba4d262cfe9fc561fe3180185f82f1e95/rst2ipynb-0.2.1.tar.gz


This package will be used through the straightforward `sage -rst2ipynb` command, see #21514 You can still test it by hand as follows: install `pandoc` on your system and if you have a `myfile.rst` do:

```
sage -sh
rst2ipynb --kernel='sagemath' myfile.rst -o myfile.ipynb
```

Indeed.

<a id='comment:15'></a>Thanks for the info. I forgot about #21514.

I managed to run `make rst_to_ipynb` succesfully from scratch on another machine.

I did some testing... Sage blocks like the following works great:

```
sage: 4+4
8
sage: for i in range(5):
....:     print i
0
1
2
3
4
```

They are translated into one input block + one output block. Great.

I get a problem with

```
>>> 4+4
8

<a id='comment:20'></a>Hi Thierry,

Adrien tried to use rst-to-ipynb by cloning the repo; that was painful
to use for him (getting the dependencies, ...). So I ended up making
it into a proper Python/pip package, which installs the conversion
script. While I am at it, I might as well upload the package on pipy
(planning to do this tomorrow).

At this stage, the script is called rst2ipynb for consistency with
`sage -rst2ipynb` and many existing `rst2xxx` converters.

Questions:
- Should the pip package be called rst2ipynb or rst-to-ipynb?
- In the former case, should the github repo be renamed rst2ipynb?
- Once we have a proper pip package on pipy, do we need a Sage package?
  (if no, sorry for the lack of sync; we could have saved the writing
  of this package).

Cheers,
      Nicolas

<a id='comment:21'></a>Let me just remind that Sage is a collective effort, which aims to share the development of common features in order to focus on the code specific to our own research.

All the `sage -rst2ipynb` stuff (packaging, scripting,...) is ready for 3 months now (i wrote those in August during https://wiki.sagemath.org/days75).

If, instead of trying alternate/duplicate ways to install it painlessly, those tickets had been reviewed, `sage -rst2ipynb` command would have been in Sage 7.4 already and Adrien would not even have had to clone anything nor to suffer some dependencies issues, because some Sage developers (myself and the reviewers) would have taken care of this once for all.

Now, could please someone review the last 2 tickets (this one and #21514 that i will push over this branch after it is reviewed) so that `sage -rst2ipynb` command will be available to every Sage user in the next release, which might end up in real-life interesting feature requests and useful improvements.

I presume Sebastien noticed the `>>>` issue because he used the package on a concrete use case that led to errors. The rst-to-ipynb package development will benefit from its easy availability to every Sage users, each with their specific workflow.

---

That said, regarding pip installation, there are two very different things: having rst-to-ipynb being pip-installable, and having it hosted/mirrored on PyPI.

If you write a convenient setup.py script, we could modify the spkg-install script to use the pip command for the install. But please do not condition the review of this ticket to that, plan it for 7.6 instead, or earlier if the last 2 ticket get merged soon.

Now, regarding fetching from PyPI for Sage, it is another story, since rst-yo-ipynb depends on notedown and pandoc_attributes, whose versions on PyPI are bitroting a lot behind the github source from which the Sage packages are built. Changes since the last PyPI update (more than 1+1/2 year) include Python3 support and various fixes.

If you have enough free time for not only creating, but also being commited to maintaining a PyPI rst-to-ipynb package indefinitely, it is definitely interesting.

It could even replace the current spkgs on the longer run, but it requires first to pressure notedown/pandoc_attributes dev to also update his PyPI repositories, and probably he does not have much time for this.

Moreover, regarding the development of rst-to-ipynb, i guess it is better to develop and test it against the latest versions of its dependencies, and not the PyPI ones, since in case of an upstream problem, it is much more doable to obtain a pull than to obtain a new PyPI release.

That said, having a somehow degraded (because of older dependencies) version on PyPI could be interesting for non-Sage users, but it would currently be a loss for Sage, and since the packaging work with up-to-date dependencies is done anyway, i do not see any benefit in relying on older Python3 incompatible versions.

This is only a very personal suggestion, but if i had such free time, i would better work on having a rst2ipynb feature being part of Jupyter (which is why i promoted the licensing of rst-to-ipynb to be the same as the jupyter one), so that it will be much more maintained, widely tested, used in different contexts, hence improved. It would perhaps imply finding a non-pandoc way to do the conversion, i am not sure.

Regarding the naming scheme, it is not very important, and certainly not imposed by the `sage -rst2ipynb` command name, since this later needs a dedicated script anyway (being interfaced with the `sage` command and specifying the Sage kernel).

Please, let us focus on having a public working `sage -rst2ipynb` command first. It is a key step for a lossless sagenb to jupyter migration.

<a id='comment:23'></a>Salut Thierry,

With Sébastien, we are precisely in the process of reviewing this
ticket and its `sage -rst2ipynb` counterpart, with goal to get it done
hopefully today. That's what led me to try first a manual install of
rst2ipynb, and realize it was even more messy than I thought. Making
it pip installable / a pipy package is part of that collective effort
to work with upstream and write stuff useful to the larger community :-)

I agree, it would have been more productive to discuss earlier on the
best approach for packaging.

Thanks for pointing out the caveat about the outdated versions of
notedown on pipy. Plus the necessity to pass down extra arguments for
the kernel. This is indeed a good reason to have a sage package, at
least for now.

My plan:
- Do tiny further edits to rst2ipynb, and make an "official release".
  (it's already pip installable)
- Release it on pipy (that's cheap anyway)
- Update the Sage package to use pip to install it from a source clone.

For the long run: having a reST to ipynb converter under the Jupyter
umbrella would indeed be best. The current pandoc+notedown approach is
reaching its limits (e.g. for handling cross references, in particular
for multi-file documents). I believe more in a Sphinx-based
approach. In a discussion with the Jupyter dev, they pointed out that
pandoc was a heavy dependency, and that Sphinx also looked better to
that respect.

Cheers,
                                   Nicolas

<a id='comment:31'></a>I am sorry that I was late at working on this ticket this Fall.

I agree to postpone the fix of `>>>` blocks to a later release of rst2ipynb.

I intend to review this ticket so that it gets a positive review *during* Sage Days 79.

+1

Nicolas, can you redo your last commit and use `git mv` instead (you will need to `git push -f` your new branch: whatever).
