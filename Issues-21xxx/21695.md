OK I was basing my conclusion from the fact that `import_array`  is defined in numpy by

```
#if PY_VERSION_HEX >= 0x03000000
#define NUMPY_IMPORT_ARRAY_RETVAL NULL
#else
#define NUMPY_IMPORT_ARRAY_RETVAL
#endif

#define import_array() {if (_import_array() < 0) {PyErr_Print(); PyErr_SetString(PyExc_ImportError, "numpy.core.multiarray failed to import"); return NUMPY_IMPORT_ARRAY_RETVAL; } }
```
which means that in `python2.7` in case of exception you will get `return ;` without any values which clang doesn't like. Of course if you can fix it in cython, I am all for it. There are two other places in sage that does use `import_array` and they do the way of my initial patch and it compiled. So, I guess I was being practical about it.
