Let `MIPVariable` not inherit from `Element` but `SageObject`. The only reason it used to be this way is to be able to multiply variables with scalars that can be dealt with in other ways. The previous inheritance scheme used the old parent framework that we try to get rid of.

+1 on getting rid of this kludge if we finally can!

About the change `Parent.__init__` -> `Ring.__init__`: if this does not induce complications, I would tend to use the occasion to not have `InfinityRing` inherit from `Ring` and instead pass `category=Rings()` to `Parent.__init__`.

I don't expect a need for pure speed for this parent, right? Of course the elements could still belong to `RingElement`.

Ah, shoot. That would be easy to fix by moving up those methods to
`Rings`, which anyway we want to do at some point. But then that's
starting to shift beyond the scope of this ticket.

As an intermediate step, one could keep for now the inheritance from
`Ring`, and pass a `category=Rings()` argument to `Parent`.

As you feel like guys!

<div id="comment:30" align="right">Comment 30</div>

The only current changes I'd really want to keep are in `rings/infinity.py` so infinity rings properly declare their categories.

Also, from looking at the code for `MIPVariables`, the parent probably should be removed and instead `MIPVariable` just implemented as `__mul__` and `__rmul__` as a subclass of `SageObject`.

Want me to do both of those things here on this ticket and make this independent of #24109?
