Could you provide the commands available to check the data in the package?

What do you think about using pari and deprecate the database?

Maybe you should ask the PARI developers (are you currently in Bordeaux?)

> What do you think about using pari


This already happens. The database is no longer used by anything else in Sage.

> and deprecate the database?


I don't think this is needed. It is still useful to avoid long computations if you need the large polynomials.
