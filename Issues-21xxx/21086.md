1. You need to check for errors in `spkg-install` (in particular, the `mv` commands).

2. You can replace

```

if [ -d ${TARGET} ]
then
	echo "REMOVING PREVIOUS VERSION"
    rm -rf ${TARGET}
fi
```
by

```
rm -rf ${TARGET}
```

3. I don't like this error handling:

```
         try:
             coeff_list = _dbz_to_integer_list(modpol)
        except IOError:
            raise KeyError("No database entry for modular polynomial of level %s"%level)
```

I think it would be better to raise the error directly in `_dbz_to_integer_list` and then only if the file really cannot be opened. If the error is raised while reading the file, it should be propagated as `IOError`. I also think that `KeyError` is not really appropriate, since it's not a key. I would prefer `LookupError`.

I should also add that this package is not as important as it used to be, since PARI can now compute the modular polynomials provided by this package.

Could you provide the commands available to check the data in the package?

What do you think about using pari and deprecate the database?

This already happens. The database is no longer used by anything else in Sage.

I don't think this is needed. It is still useful to avoid long computations if you need the large polynomials.
