1. You need to check for errors in `spkg-install` (in particular, the `mv` commands).

2. You can replace

```

if [ -d ${TARGET} ]
then
	echo "REMOVING PREVIOUS VERSION"
    rm -rf ${TARGET}
fi
```
by

```
rm -rf ${TARGET}
```

3. I don't like this error handling:

```
         try:
             coeff_list = _dbz_to_integer_list(modpol)
        except IOError:
            raise KeyError("No database entry for modular polynomial of level %s"%level)
```

I think it would be better to raise the error directly in `_dbz_to_integer_list` and then only if the file really cannot be opened. If the error is raised while reading the file, it should be propagated as `IOError`. I also think that `KeyError` is not really appropriate, since it's not a key. I would prefer `LookupError`.

Could you provide the commands available to check the data in the package?

What do you think about using pari and deprecate the database?

I don't think this is needed. It is still useful to avoid long computations if you need the large polynomials.
