<a id='comment:2'></a>This is a first implementation of LR tableaux. Things to improve:

- allow for skew LR tableaux

- improve the iterator (it is currently a dumb iterator selecting semistandard tableaux that are LR with respect to a given sequence of weights)

<a id='comment:3'></a>Hey Maria and Anne,

I've taken a look over this and there are a few polishing things that need to be done.

- You should have documentation for each of the classes. This is important both for locality of documentation and so `LittlewoodRichardsonTableau?` does not show the `__init__` documentation. You can just put the `INPUT:` block at the class level doc as well.
- For error messages, they are typically not considered complete sentences, and should not start with a capital letter or end with punctuation.
- In the documentation, double backticks is code formatting, single is latex. So you should change, e.g., ``self`` to ```self```.
- For inputs, we are trying to standardize them to the form
  {{{
- ``arg`` -- (optional) some explanation
  }}}
  (note, also no punctuation).

It also seems like what you want LR tableaux to inherit from is `SemistandardTableaux_shape_weight`. This way you can just use the base class iterator instead of creating a new parent. Actually, better yet, you could just call `for t in symmetrica.kostka_tab(self.shape, self.weight):`. As of right now, your iterator does not create instances of `LittlewoodRichardsonTableau`:

```
sage: from sage.combinat.lr_tableau import LittlewoodRichardsonTableaux
sage: LR = LittlewoodRichardsonTableaux([3,2,1],[[2,1],[2,1]])
sage: LR[0]
[[1, 1, 3], [2, 3], [4]]
sage: type(_)
<class 'sage.combinat.tableau.SemistandardTableaux_shape_weight_with_category.element_class'>
```

This suggestion does not seem to work. We are anyway planning to implement a smarter iterator, so it is probably not worth it to call symmetrica.

<a id='comment:14'></a>Hi all,

I wrote an iterator, `LRtabs_multi`, that calls Anders Buch's fast lrcalc code (which can compute LR tableaux with specified skew shape). The tableaux we want can be found using a sequence of lrcalc calls.

I didn't rewrite the current `__iter__` method because this new one is slightly more general (it can compute skew tableaux rather than straight shape tableaux).

<a id='comment:16'></a>Hi Jake and all,

Thank you for your improvements. I rewrote the __iter__ method that uses lrskew and your method _tableauJoin (which I renamed _tableau_join). It seems shorter than what you had as it does not need standardization or destandardization. See what you think. It should be relatively easy to upgrade the whole class to allow for SkewTableaux as well. But perhaps we can leave that for another
ticket?

Best,

Anne
