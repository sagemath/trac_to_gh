Could you change the doctest for being more explicit about what should be imported/used to make the test pass. One possibility

```
sage: from sage.combinat.posets.cartesian_product import CartesianProductPoset
sage: QQ.CartesianProduct = CartesianProductPoset  # needed until #19269 is fixed

With your version it is quite subtle why it does not fail.
