`./sage -t --randorder n src/sage/combinat/posets/` fails for `n=2` and `n=5`. I have no idea why.

Could you change the doctest for being more explicit about what should be imported/used to make the test pass. One possibility

```
sage: from sage.combinat.posets.cartesian_product import CartesianProductPoset
sage: QQ.CartesianProduct = CartesianProductPoset  # needed until #19269 is fixed
```
With your version it is quite subtle why it does not fail.
