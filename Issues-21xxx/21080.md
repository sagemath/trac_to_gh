This was just missing `import` statements on `TESTS` block. It worked when first test to run had the right import.

```
sage: from sage.combinat.posets.cartesian_product import CartesianProductPoset
sage: QQ.CartesianProduct = CartesianProductPoset  # needed until #19269 is fixed
```
With your version it is quite subtle why it does not fail.
