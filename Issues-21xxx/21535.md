This is a follow-up on #21480, which put `src/setup.py` in charge of all `sagelib`building and removed dependencies on various environment variables, as a step towards the goal of making `sagelib` an ordinary Python package (#21507). 

However, there is still a dependency on `$SAGE_CYTHONIZED`, which needs to be set in a way that matches the build-base (set by `setup.py build --build-base`).

This dependency should be removed.

Also, `--inplace` should be supported.
(See also: #12659: build the sage library in place)

See also #21508 on other cleanup issues of `src/setup.py`.

That would be great!

By the way, in my current attempt at #21469 I noticed that `--build-base` already works. 

This line in `src/setup.py`:

```
build_base = 'build' # the distutils default. Changing it is not supported by this setup.sh.
```
is probably a leftover from my earlier changes, and should probably be removed. The variable `build_base` does not seem to be used, and the comment is no longer correct.

Here is a branch getting rid of `SAGE_CYTHONIZED`. Unfortunately, two doctests in `sage_setup` still require `SAGE_CYTHONIZED`, so I just hardcoded the value there. This clearly goes against DRY, so I'm not so happy with it. Ideas or improvements are welcome.

Commit 33746a2 is good, but I think some of the changes in 769de13 are not going in the right direction.

1) In particular the following, I think, breaks the already working `--build-base` feature (see comment 14)!

```diff
diff --git a/src/setup.py b/src/setup.py
index 6354427..be4036d 100755
--- a/src/setup.py
+++ b/src/setup.py
@@ -52,12 +52,16 @@ sys.excepthook = excepthook
 
 build_base = 'build' # the distutils default. Changing it is not supported by this setup.sh.
 
+# Directory to store Cython-generated files
+SAGE_CYTHONIZED = os.path.join(build_base, "cythonized")
+
```

2) The hardcoded paths depending on SAGE_SRC make it harder for the VPATH patch. Perhaps it's best to do this work after VPATH (#21469) is done.
