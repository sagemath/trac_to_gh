This is a follow-up on #21480, which put `src/setup.py` in charge of all `sagelib`building and removed dependencies on various environment variables, as a step towards the goal of making `sagelib` an ordinary Python package (#21507). 

However, there is still a dependency on `$SAGE_CYTHONIZED`, which needs to be set in a way that matches the build-base (set by `setup.py build --build-base`).

This dependency should be removed.

Also, `--inplace` should be supported.
(See also: #12659: build the sage library in place)

That would be great!

By the way, in my current attempt at #21469 I noticed that `--build-base` already works. 

This line in `src/setup.py`:

```
build_base = 'build' # the distutils default. Changing it is not supported by this setup.sh.
```
is probably a leftover from my earlier changes, and should probably be removed. The variable `build_base` does not seem to be used, and the comment is no longer correct.

Commit 33746a2 is good, but I think some of the changes in 769de13 are not going in the right direction.

1) In particular the following, I think, breaks the already working `--build-base` feature (see comment 14)!

```diff
diff --git a/src/setup.py b/src/setup.py
index 6354427..be4036d 100755
--- a/src/setup.py
+++ b/src/setup.py
@@ -52,12 +52,16 @@ sys.excepthook = excepthook
 
 build_base = 'build' # the distutils default. Changing it is not supported by this setup.sh.
 
+# Directory to store Cython-generated files
+SAGE_CYTHONIZED = os.path.join(build_base, "cythonized")
+
```

2) The hardcoded paths depending on SAGE_SRC make it harder for the VPATH patch. Perhaps it's best to do this work after VPATH (#21469) is done.

Well, in #21480 the variable `build_base` was still used, but some of Erik's later tickets seem to have removed all uses of it.

I'm not actively concerned about any of my existing open tickets addressing issues in the setup.py.  I'd like to get back to that at some point but if any of those tickets still end up being useful I'll rework them.
