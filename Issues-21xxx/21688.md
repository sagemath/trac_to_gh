In `sage-env`, there is

```
PYTHONPATH="$SAGE_LOCAL/lib/python:$SAGE_LOCAL/lib/python/site_packages"
```

However, `site_packages` does not exist (but `site-packages` does exist). Since this is obviously not needed (it shouldn't be, Python should be able to find its `site-packages` directory), we just remove that directory.
