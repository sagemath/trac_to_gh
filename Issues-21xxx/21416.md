This package provides the GAP kernel for the Jupyter notebook,
making it available from the Sage's Jupyter notebook .

The source repository is at
- https://github.com/gap-packages/jupyter-kernel-gap

**Demo notebook**
- https://github.com/OpenDreamKit/OpenDreamKit/blob/master/WP4/D4.4/demo-gap.ipynb

**Tarball**
- https://pypi.python.org/packages/6d/02/2c88024c5851d8fc2a1340d1ffe9a2daf7d2fb0b72468e88348809d19ecd/jupyter-kernel-gap-0.9.tar.gz

Note. This is an optional package. To make it available to an existing Sage installation,
run the following command in a terminal:

```
sage -i gap_jupyter
```

True, but I don't see why that means that we shouldn't merge it in Sage. There are several abandoned projects in Sage already, even as standard packages.

+1. What would be bad would be to introduce the feature, and then later have to remove it because it does not work anymore. Here upstream is very motivated by the feature, and has gone a long way toward the newer implementation with libgap being planned for next GAP release.

So we can expect the new implementation to come along in the coming months. And for now the current implementation works and is useful.

I'll double check with Markus that he is ok to expose the current implementation.
