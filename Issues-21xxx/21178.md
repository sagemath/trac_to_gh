Sorry, I missed your previous post.

I actually (also) just normalized the few instances of `Return` to `Returns` because the vast majority of functions and methods in that file uses not just `Returns`, but also `Applies`, `Tests`, `Computes` and the like.

Wasn't aware that finally one form was agreed on, since this discussion happened a couple of times, essentially coming to the conclusion that it should be consistent within a file or package.

I'll try to change everything to imperative form then (although I don't like it, and a mathematician shouldn't either, perhaps except for some very computional ones, since you don't *tell* a function to behave like this or that, but define its meaning, and a function application *equals* some expression you obtain by term rewriting -- the only imperative being telling some interpreter or solver to *evaluate* something according to given definitions).
