CC:  @jm58660

I was asked if Sage provides code to iterate over all orientations of a graph. We should add this to Sage.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/21415

Seems reasonable. So this needs just definition, examples and so on. The graph may not have multiple edges nor loops, but it can have weight (or other labels) assigned to edges.

I can see no easy way to optimize this, `product` already does what is possible.

Something like this for docstring?

```
    """
    Return an iterator over orientations of the graph.
    
    An *orientation* of an undirected graph is a directed
    graph such that every edge is assigned a direction.
    Hence there are `2^s` oriented digraphs for a graph
    with `s` edges.
    
    EXAMPLES::
        
        sage: G = Graph([[1,2,3], [(1, 2, 'a'), (1, 3, 'b')]], format='vertices_and_edges')
        sage: it = G.all_orientations()
        sage: D = it.next()
        sage: D.edges()  # Random order for orientations
        [(1, 2, 'a'), (1, 3, 'b')]
        sage: D = it.next()
        sage: D.edges()  # Random order for orientations
        [(2, 1, 'a'), (1, 3, 'b')]
    
    TESTS::
        
        sage: G = Graph()
        sage: G_ = [g for g in G.all_orientations()]
        sage: len(G_)
        1
        sage: G_[0]
        Digraph on 0 vertices
        
        sage: G = Graph(5)
        sage: it = G.all_orientations()
        sage: G_ = next(it)
        sage: G_.size()
        0
    """
```

Should the name be `all_orientations()` or just `orientations()`?

Also, the docstring looks good. We will just have to add some tests for multiedges and/or loops. However, the order of the iterator and edges should be consistent when the vertices have a total ordering (like the integers).

I didn't know that `sort=True` is the default for `edges`. Actually I didn't even know about the option. But that is good, we can have easier examples.

I would say Python is not switching to more iterator style per-se, but having default behavior that is more practical for the typical programming purpose.

I put the code into a branch, taking some from the ask answer, and kept only an iterator because of how big is does get.

- `implementation` is missing from the `INPUT` block.

- "optional" at documentation of parameter `sparse` is strange, and `data_structure` does not have it; that is inconsistent.

- Spaces in the line after one-line description (and that makes index of functions quite bad).

- Is it meaningful to copy name of original graph? Sounds strange to have a directed Petersen graph.

Otherwise it seems to work, attributes for allowing loops and/or multiedges works and so on.

This is not included in *any* documentation. I am following suit.

`sparse` is there as a shorthand for (the necessary) `data_structure`, so it is optional.

Will fix.

Should we add "directed" to the front of the name or just drop it altogether? I don't have a preference on this.

I do not understand. Both parameters are optional, as both have a default value. But whatever, won't block me from giving review.

No, not "directed". Maybe "An orientation of ..." or nothing. I can't say either.

How I see it, `data_structure` is necessary, even though it has a default value, but `sparse` is not.

I added "An orientation of" when a name is specified.

I've addressed all of the mentioned issues.

Seems good and tests passed, documentation builds etc.

But only now, when you added a test for multigraphs, I really thinked about this; sorry about being late. What about orientations of `Graph({1: [2, 2]}, multiedges=True)`? The code gives 4, but only 3 different. Same applies to graphs with loops.

I don't know how we should address this. But at a minimun this should be documented.

Actually, the loop is wrong; for that, either orientation is equivalent. However, for the multiedges, you just can't distinguish them. I think it would be much harder to code that, so I will just document the behavior.
