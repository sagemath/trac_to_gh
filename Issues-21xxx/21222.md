Right now the ECM interface is broken for me on Cygwin, such that calls to `ecm` are segfaulting.  That's a separate issue though (no ticket yet).  What bothers me in this case is that the implementation of `ECM.one_curve` hides lower-level errors like this, by catching any `ValueError` from `ECM._parse_output` and returning a valid output as if no factors were found (when in fact the `ecm` process itself crashed so yes technically no factors were found...).

Really an error should have been raised much earlier, probably from `ECM._run_ecm`, but it only checks for errors by checking for output on `stderr`.  It does not check the return code, though it probably should.
