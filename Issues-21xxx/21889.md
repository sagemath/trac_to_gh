<a id='comment:20'></a>It's not a doctest testing doctest strings ;)
It a doctest for a method that builds a table of methods and inserts it in the html doc. See for instance `sage/graphs/graph.py` and the corresponding html page. 
It's very convenient to have a nice html doc. We could use it more.
