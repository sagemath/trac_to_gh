This initial packaging :
* builds with no error on top of 7.5beta0
* passes its own test suite successfully.

The resulting Sage passes testlong with no errors (not even transient, for a marvel...

Marking `needs_review`. See the thread on `sage-devel` for discussion of conditional installation.

I don't like this style of logging:

```
CC       libcurl_la-curl_gethostname.lo
```
I like to see the `gcc` command-line to figure out what is going on.

Usually, this can be changed by passing `V=1` to the `make` command line (see for example `build/pkgs/libfplll/spkg-install`)

In this branch :
* Sage shell checking
* verbose compilation
* patching (and empty patches directory), [Sage Maintainer's Guide](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/packaging.html#patching-sources) style.

This builds and passes the package's own test suite without errors ; the resulting Sage passes ptestlong with the usual transient error on `simplicial_complex.py`, which passes succesfully standalone.

Re: #20692 : This ticket has been in the works for 5 months and still depends on two other tickets. I'd rather not wait for it to be merged in Sage before getting the damn `curl` in Sage : `R` depends on it, and updating it begins to be a matter of some (slight) urgency : more and more `R` packages can no longer be installed under 2.4.2...  That doesn't mean I won't revise the way to patch things when #20692 is merged.

Anyway, the point is moot for now : there are **no** patches...

The issue raised by Volker is valid, but has little to do with the present issue (nor with R's update...).

Furthermore, I think we shouldn't try to solve locally a systemwide problem.

Therefore, the obvious solution is to add OpenSSL as a prerequisite to Sage. (easy patch : two words in the main README.md...).

Would *that* be a problem ?

Should we open a discussion on sage-devel ?

Thanks for the heads-up. It's important, and I'm afraid that the full size of the problem hasn't yet been considered : the R ecosystem is much larger (by about 3-4 magnitudes) than some seem to think...

I think that the (pseudo-)legal considerations which motivated last month's [saga](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/QaBdHSNJuKg) leave us few options.

I looked a bit closer to the idea of using an `rpy2`-based new interface to an external `R`. This is doable, but not in the short term.

I am under the impression that the current (pexpect) interface won't work reliably with a system R (especially on "exotic" systems such as cygwin and the Mac). Therefore, depending on a systemwide installation for R is out of the question in the short term. We need an interim solution.

My current plan is :
* Mark this ticket (#21767) as invalid/won't fix, forthe (pseudo-)legal reasons discussed in the saga.
* Document in the REAME.md and various places in the [Installation guide](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/index.html) that **Sage** depends on `libcurl` and building it depends on `libcurl`'s development files.
* Make `xz` (existing package) and `pcre` (proposed new package) standard packages (see #21744 and #21770 respectively).
* patch the `R install-spkg` to test for the existence and correct capabilities of libcurl before starting to install ; display an explicitly Sage-centered message and fail if not found / not correct.
* make `R` depend on `xz` and `pcre`

Only *after* this interim solution works, envision the much larger task of creating a new interface.

Jean-Pierre : I think that omitting `https` requirement for R is a *very* bad idea : I do not know how longer R users will be able to depend on http-only repositories ; and, as I said before, R practical use is highly dependent of access to the 9000+ R packages in existence.

Advice required. Do you think useful to open an new discussion on [sage-devel](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sage-devel) ?

Note 1 : the patchbot test of #21744 is marked "pending". What does that mean ?

Note 2 : the patchbot test of #21770 fails repeatedly due to thye source tarball being unavailable on Sage standard repositories. What should I do ? The (ftp) address of the original tarball is in the ticket's header.

After #22189, curl remains a valid solution. I took the opportunity to upgrade curl to 7.52.1

Still `needs_review`

Sage-7.6.beta4 + #20523 + #21767 (this patch) + #21770 passes ptestlong witht two transient errors :

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage -t --long src/sage/homology/simplicial_set_morphism.py  # Bad exit: 2
sage -t --long src/sage/homology/simplicial_complex.py  # 1 doctest failed
----------------------------------------------------------------------
```
Both tests pass when run standalone.

This should close the R saga (for now) by allowing the current interfaces to work with R >= 3.3.x.

Still `needs_review`

I have mentioned before that I really would not like that...

So far, we have always been fixing packages requiring OpenSSL such that they would work without OpenSSL (with reduced functionality). I think that can and should be done for R also.

But somehow failed to explain the reasons of your dislike.

And that's why Sage's pip, compiled on a VM without OpenSSL, is unusable. "Reduced functionality", indeed...

> I think that can and should be done for R also.


That should be done **upstream** :
* in R (the R Core Team introduced the SSL requirement with R 3.3 after having maintained an internal library for years...) ;
* in Python (which explicitly depends on OpenSSL).

But I really think that this is weather-fighting (and a rearguard fight, BTW). You still have to convince us that OpenSSL drawbacks (what are they ?) are worth committing a large part of our limited resources to work around it.

It's simple: an extra dependency makes it harder to build Sage. So far, we tried hard in Sage to have a minimal set of dependencies: all dependencies to build Sage are either obviously needed (compilers, make, ...) or are installed by default on most typical operating systems (Python).

Anyway, sorry for reviving this here as curl can build without ssl.
The issue is with R checking that curl supports ssl and I've posted a patch on the R ticket to remove that check.

`@`emmanuel: can you update curl to the latest upstream version?
Then I'll push the positive review button.
