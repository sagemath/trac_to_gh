Python `__slots__` allows to create Python classes without `__dict__` attribute (that is there is a fixed set of attributes). This is done with declaring this list as in

```
class A(object):
    __slots__ = ["attr1", "attr2"]
```
Using slots reduces the memory footprint of Python objects and consequently allocation time

```
sage: class A(object): pass
sage: class B(object): __slots__ = []
sage: time l = [A() for _ in range(50000000)]  # ~4G of RAM
CPU times: user 26.3 s, sys: 708 ms, total: 27 s
Wall time: 27 s
sage: time l = [B() for _ in range(50000000)]  # ~1G of RAM
CPU times: user 5.26 s, sys: 376 ms, total: 5.64 s
Wall time: 5.64 s
```
However using this feature breaks a certain number of Sage features

1. The function `is_extension_type` from `sage.structure.misc`. Such object would be recognized as "extension type". It might be fine but should be documented.

2. `cached_method` does not work properly

```
class A(object):
    __slots__ = []
    @cached_method
    def f(self):
        print "compute"
        return 1
```
  gives

```
sage: a = A()
sage: a.f()
compute
1
sage: a.f()
compute
1
```

Replying to [ticket:21348 vdelecroix]:
> 1. The function `is_extension_type` from `sage.structure.misc`. Such object would be recognized as "extension type". It might be fine but should be documented.

And the function `is_extension_type` should be renamed to what it really tests. For example, `has_writable_dict` might be a better name.

Right. I just created the ticket to weight pros and cons... and whether some of Sage features can be adapted.
