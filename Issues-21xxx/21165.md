`sage.coding.linear_code` has a number of global functions and class methods which are badly named, badly documented, badly placed or badly conceived. This ticket takes some steps towards cleaning up.

This ticket fixes the following issues:

- Renamed and moved `best_known_linear_code`, `best_known_linear_code_www`, `bounds_minimum_distance` and `self_orthogonal_binary_codes` to new module `sage.coding.databases`, also deprecating them from the global namespace. Also improved their documentation. Added the new module to `codes`.
- Rename the module `sd_codes` to `self_dual_codes`.
- Remove the function `sd_codes.self_dual_codes_binary` from the global namespace, renaming it into `self_dual_binary_codes` accessible from `codes.databases`. Removed all helper computations that were done at Sage startup from `sd_codes`, making them all private and evaluated only when calling `self_dual_binary_codes`.
- Deprecated `sd_zeta_polynomial` and its helper functions. After struggling for
  a long time, I found out that this method supposed to compute exactly the same
  as `zeta_polynomial`, except that it uses a method which only works for
  self-dual codes. The method is a semi-explicit expression for the zeta
  function which has theoretical interest, but no computational interest (it is
  not faster to compute). So the method should simply be removed.
- Deprecated `LinearCodeFromVectorSpace` and made `LinearCode` accept a vector space at construction time.
- Improved some unhelpful doc-examples in `sage.coding.extended_code`.
- Some cleanup of the imports on the top-level of `linear_code.py`.
- Rename and deprecate from the global namespace the functions `code2leon`, `min_wt_vec_gap`.
- Improve the deprecation message for `wtdist_gap`.
- Improved doc of `covering_radius`.
- Use `weight_distribution` as primary term instead of `spectrum`, but support the second as an alias. Inline the helper function `_spectrum_from_gap`. Improved the doc.
- Renamed `code_constructions.LinearCodeFromCheckMatrix` to `code_constructions.from_parity_check_matrix`. Simplified its doc.
- Changed a random doctest in `punctured_code` whose output changed after an unrelated patch (due to `RandomLinearCode`)
- Simplified `RandomLinearCode`, renamed to `codes.random_linear_code` and fixed order of arguments.
- Removed `TrivialCode` as it was mathematically senseless and hadn't worked for a while (it had no tests).
- Massively modernized and simplified the doc of `code_constructions.py`.
- Privatized and/or deprecated the helper functions of `code_constructions.py`.

Hello,

Thanks for cleaning up all this!

I only have a couple of remarks:

- There's a lone import statement at the bottom of `databases.py`. Is there any reason why it's here and not at the top of this file with the others?

- Same file, the first two methods do not have an `INPUT` block, while they do have some input arguments.

Otherwise, tests pass and documentation builds, everything seems to be properly deprecated, I agree with your changes.

BTW, it was not merging with the latest beta, fixed this and pushed my change.

Best,

David

Replying to [dlucas](#comment%3A7):

It's not there to make the functional available to code in the module, but rather to make the function available on the command line as `codes.databases.<tab>`.

However, your comment made me realise that all the global imports at the top of `databases.py` are also present in that tab-completion. So now I've localised all of those.

> - Same file, the first two methods do not have an `INPUT` block, while they do have some input arguments.

I've added it.


> Otherwise, tests pass and documentation builds, everything seems to be properly deprecated, I agree with your changes.

Be aware that many of the tests in `databases.py` require the spkg
`gap_packages` or `internet`, and are not run by default with `./sage -t`. I
had forgotten this myself, but now made them run and fixed some import bugs.

> BTW, it was not merging with the latest beta, fixed this and pushed my change.

Thanks, and thanks for reviewing.

Best,
Johan

Hello,

Just found a broken doctest in one of the thematic tutorials (forgot to test that yesterday).
It was a trivial deprecation, fixed it myself and pushed the related change.
I'm fine with this ticket, so if you're fine with my change, you can set this ticket to positive
review.

Hello,

Fixed.
Or, to be more specific, I already fixed it. Commit [189d8e5](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/189d8e59744914fb14ff052436f53e59f3cb2927).
I pushed my branch once again, hopefully it will work this time.

BTW, I don't know what happened.
`git trac pull 21165` returned `already up-to-date with u/jsrn/21165_linear_code_cleanup`.
Which explains why I did not catch that failing doctest: it's fixed on my side...
