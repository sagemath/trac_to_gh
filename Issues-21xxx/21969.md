<a id='comment:10'></a>This is very wrong:

```
            lx = <SingularFunction>self
            rx = <SingularFunction>other
```            
since those casts don't check that they make sense. You need a *checking* cast

```
            lx = <SingularFunction?>self
            rx = <SingularFunction?>other
```
Also please add this doctest:

```
sage: groebner == None
```
With this current branch, this segfaults (because of the reason above).
