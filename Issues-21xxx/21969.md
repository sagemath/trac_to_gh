I would say that the current code works correctly.

Note that richcmp is not only about equality or unequality, but also about comparison. And the only solution is to refuse to compare things when this is meaningless. If I have understood correctly, Python3 is much more restrictive on what it is allowed to compare.

This is very wrong:

```
            lx = <SingularFunction>self
            rx = <SingularFunction>other
```            
since those casts don't check that they make sense. You need a *checking* cast

```
            lx = <SingularFunction?>self
            rx = <SingularFunction?>other
```
Also please add this doctest:

```
sage: groebner == None
```
With this current branch, this segfaults (because of the reason above).
