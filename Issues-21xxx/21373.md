We should try to fix these warnings:

```
warning: -jN forced in submake: disabling jobserver mode.
```

There are 3 different issues:

1. The warnings appears several times at the top-level (not inside a package build) and during the build of the Sage library. This can probably be fixed by moving this snippet from `sage-env` higher up:

```sh
# If MAKEFLAGS exists, assume it got set by make.
# Therefore, remove all flags from $MAKE
if [ "${MAKEFLAGS-__unset__}" != "__unset__" ]; then
    MAKE=`echo "$MAKE" | sed 's/ .*//'`
fi
export MAKE
```

2. For several packages, the warning correctly appears because we explicitly force `-j1` (presumably to fix parallel build issues):
- `brial`
- `gap`
- `pari`
- `pkgconf`
- `python2`
- `singular`
- `zeromq`

3. Other packages where this warnings appears:
- `openblas`: no idea where it comes from, probably the `openblas` build system itself.

So this proposal just doesn't work.

How about this:

```
$ cat Makefile 
all: opts

opts:
	@echo $(MAKEFLAGS)
```
Now:

```
$ make -j10
-j10 --jobserver-auth=3,4
```
That is, you can parse top-level MAKEFLAGS and get the value you need.

Not really because we are talking about the user running the system `make`.

What we *could* do is try to support both mechanisms: for users running a recent enough version of `make`, we could support `make -j10`.
