There is an inconsistency in the interface between fields and vector spaces.

```
sage: F.<a>=GF(9)
sage: V=F.vector_space()
sage: V(a)
(0, 1)
sage: G.<b>=GF(3)
sage: W=G.vector_space()
sage: W(b)
...
TypeError: can't initialize vector from nonzero non-list

The cause is

sage: a._vector_()
(0, 1)
sage: b._vector_()
...
AttributeError: 'sage.rings.finite_rings.integer_mod.IntegerMod_int' object has no attribute '_vector_'
```

Adding a `_vector_` method to the `GF(p)` elements will be a simple fix. 

Along the way, we also clean up `_vector_` and `_matrix_` methods in the class `FinitePolyExtElement`.

Note that the following also works

```
sage: K = GF(9)
sage: V = VectorSpace(K, 1)
sage: V(K.an_element())
(0)
```
Hence I guess that a default `_vector_` at the category level would actually make sense.

The `_vector_` method for elements has no link to the `vector_space` method for parents.

This is not an argument. Moreover using category allows to have these methods available for any rings or fields.

The part that was missing in the current implementation is the basic construction `ring -> one dimensional vector space over this ring`. This construction makes sense for any ring and hence makes sense in Sage category framework.

You are right that for *some* specific ring, there might be other natural vector spaces. In this case it is possible to add more specialized implementations. And this is exactly what is being done for finite fields.

<a id='comment:13'>Comment 13:</a>
(1) You added `vector_space` method to the fields category. How can this be useful at all? You can always construct the vector spaces directly by `QQ*n`.

(2)  About `_matrix_` method: Its docstring says "Return the matrix of right multiplication by the element on the power basis `1, x, x^2, \ldots, x^{d-1}` for the field extension.  Thus the \emph{rows} of this matrix give the images of each of the `x^i`." So we have

```
sage: b=a^10
sage: v=b._vector_()
sage: m=a._matrix_()
sage: w=(a*b)._vector_()
sage: m*v == w
True
```

Shouldn't this be called the "matrix of left multiplication by the element a"? And the columns of this matrix give the images of `x^i`?

(3) The `reverse` argument for `_matrix_` method corresponds to `reverse`ed `_vector_`. Therefore I expect `m*v == w` still holds with reversed versions. But

```
sage: v=b._vector_(reverse=True)
sage: m=a._matrix_(reverse=True)
sage: w=(a*b)._vector_(reverse=True)
sage: m*v == w
False
sage: m*v
(1, 1, 1, 1)
sage: w
(1, 1, 1, 0)
sage: 
```
I think this is a bug. Why does transposing the matrix gives what we want? The correct way would be reversing all columns and all rows.

By the way, you changed the docstring for `reverse` argument. But the original one makes more sense.

So the bug dealt with the present ticket is just in the prime finite field. I still think that touching the Rings category is not the right way.

Before:

```
sage: K.<a>=QQ.extension(x^2-2)
sage: K.vector_space()

(Vector space of dimension 2 over Rational Field, Isomorphism map:
   From: Vector space of dimension 2 over Rational Field
   To:   Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^2 - 2, Isomorphism map:
   From: Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^2 - 2
   To:   Vector space of dimension 2 over Rational Field)
sage: a.vector()
(0, 1)
sage: vector(a)
(0, 1)
```

After your patch:

```
sage: a.vector()
(0, 1)
sage: vector(a)
(a)
```

So `.vector()` and `._vector_()` should be context-sensitive.
