```
A lot of the stuff (not necessarily all) in `$SAGE_SRC/ext` belongs directly in the sage Python package--in particular any files that are needed for the package itself to function properly. 

A model for that is `sage.gaprc`, a file required for the `libgap` module to work, which is installed in `sage.libs.gap` as "package data" as of #22626.

In this ticket, we install all of `ext` as package data of `sage`.

- In a follow up ticket, if we identify any files in `$SAGE_SRC/ext` that aren't explicitly required from the package, we will move them to a more appropriate place.



Depends on #29233

There are several files in `$SAGE_SRC/ext` that there's no reason to ever allow to be out of sync with the Python package, and that could be given the same treatment.

For files in `$SAGE_SRC/ext` in general, that aren't explicitly required from the package (are there any such files) it might be better to move out of `src/` entirely?

Looks good but there are a few doctests errors on the patchbots and I think at least some of them are really related to this ticket

Looking at this file, there is no tests in it, which suggests it may not have been tested before and may be nothing in `ext_data` should.

This one is actually the exact same error but on another file

New round of patchbot

```
sage -t --long --warn-long 286.7 src/sage/rings/function_field/function_field.py  # Timed out
sage -t --long --warn-long 286.7 src/sage/doctest/sources.py  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t --long --warn-long 286.7 src/sage_setup/clean.py  # 1 doctest failed
```
The time out is strange but was already there in the previous round so there may be something about it (but what?). The testing in `doctest/sources.py` is still present even so we don't test `postprocess.py` anymore so there is something more to do somewhere in there.
And lastly we have some stale files - not unexpectedly at this stage

```
sage -t --long --warn-long 286.7 src/sage_setup/clean.py

Real cool! Everything in the one ticket, the nodoctest stuff means that I can ditch packaging code I had to add because of QA complaints in Gentoo.

Which bit do you find strange? the stale file in `ext_data`? It looks like when you install stuff with distutils all python file are byte-compiled by default, including the ones in `package_data` (which I wasn't expecting but this is probably a blanket scan of what's installed).

I think this is ready for positive review.
