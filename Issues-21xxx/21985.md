Some objects, such as `FreeAlgebra` and `IwahoriHeckeAlgebra`, do not implement the `_latex_` method.

See the [_latex_ method](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/blob/master/src/sage/algebras/letterplace/free_algebra_letterplace.pyx#n466) of the letterplace implementation of free algebras for an idea how to solve this issue.
