I fixed this a while ago, but realized I don't think I ever made a ticket for it.

This test fails due to minor numerical differences (again, probably originating in the `log()` function) so that the polynomial returned by `z.algdep(5)` ends up being slightly different (it gets an extra factor of `x^2`).  This makes the test a little more flexible to such differences.

#21292 remains stalled, but this simple test fix doesn't require it; better to just fix this.
