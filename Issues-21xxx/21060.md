Seems to work, so I guess I must put this to positive_review.

But I don't understand the statement "Note that even with this option, the tests within a given doctest block are still run in order." about testing in random order. Is "doctest block" a combination of `EXAMPLES` and `TESTS` in one function? I would have guessed that the test block fails for missing import statement if run before examples block.
