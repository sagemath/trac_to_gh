This is a first part of #13827.

Currently setting a color for one vertex will change default pink to blue in other vertices. This patch will correct it. Also we make it possible to set a default color with `vertex_color` and have some vertices colored differently with `vertex_colors`. To test try for example

```
sage: g=graphs.PetersenGraph()
sage: g.show()
sage: g.show(vertex_color='green')
sage: g.show(vertex_colors={'red': [0,1], 'blue': [3,4]})
sage: g.show(vertex_color='green', vertex_colors={'red': [0,1], 'blue': [3,4]})
sage: g.show(vertex_colors='green')
```

It looks like you took out some default rainbow coloring in the code. Since this is a part of Sage I'm unlikely to use much, I would like to understand the impact this will have on other users. While it's certainly better to have more control over the coloring, how many people are likely to complain if the rainbow coloring is gone?

I was not able to run that part of code. It seems to refer `partition`-option. However, currently

```
g = graphs.PetersenGraph()
g.show(partition=[[1,2],[3,4]])
```

have same problem of changing default color for non-listed vertices. With this patch they will stay pink, and also you can say

```
g.show(partition=[[1,2],[3,4]], vertex_color='gray')
```

If that is a good idea then I'm fine with it, but I would rather have some additional input. Nathann Cohen wrote the original coloring code in 2009, so I'd like to hear from him or interested others on this change.
