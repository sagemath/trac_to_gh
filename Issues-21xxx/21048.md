This is a first part of #13827.

Currently setting a color for one vertex will change default pink to blue in other vertices. This patch will correct it. Also we make it possible to set a default color with `vertex_color` and have some vertices colored differently with `vertex_colors`. To test try for example

```
sage: g=graphs.PetersenGraph()
sage: g.show()
sage: g.show(vertex_color='green')
sage: g.show(vertex_colors={'red': [0,1], 'blue': [3,4]})
sage: g.show(vertex_color='green', vertex_colors={'red': [0,1], 'blue': [3,4]})
sage: g.show(vertex_colors='green')
```

I was not able to run that part of code. It seems to refer `partition`-option. However, currently

```
g = graphs.PetersenGraph()
g.show(partition=[[1,2],[3,4]])
```

have same problem of changing default color for non-listed vertices. With this patch they will stay pink, and also you can say

```
g.show(partition=[[1,2],[3,4]], vertex_color='gray')
```
