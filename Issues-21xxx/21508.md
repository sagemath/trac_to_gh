Sub-tasks:

- #21480: Make sagelib setup.py self-contained and independent of SAGE_ROOT
- #21613: Make setup.py not depend on make
- #21604: Cleaning up stale installed files in setup()
  - See also #21654: Disentangle cleaning of stale installed files in build directory and in install directory
- #21600: Use custom build_ext to compile Cython code

In particular, 
- `src/setup.py --help` should return immediately.
- `src/setup.py clean` should not build anything but just clean (and everything that is now done by `make clean` in the `src` directory should be done by it; see #29411)

Also the following should be done:
- #29702: Move all code from `src/setup.py`, `src/fpickle_setup.py` to `sage_setup`
- #21516: Fix sagelib sdist (`src/setup.py sdist`)
- #21535: Make `src/setup.py` respect `--build-base` and `--inplace`, independent of `SAGE_CYTHONIZED`
- #21573: Make sure `src/setup.py` respects `--install-base` and `--root`
- #21678 Testsuite for `src/setup.py`
- #30580 `sage_setup`: Remove import-time dependency (`setup_requires`) on `pkgconfig`, `numpy`

Also see: 
- #20108: Use `package_data` instead of `data_files` in setup.py
- #21682: Add a separate "cythonize" command to setup.py
- #12659: build the sage library in place
- #13190: make sage use setuptools instead of distutils
- #29701: Meta-ticket: Replace use of OptionalExtension by namespace packages
