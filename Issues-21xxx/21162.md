Implement row standard tableau in sage, of both partition and partition tuple shape. A row standard tableau is a tableau in which the numbers `1,2,...,n` appear in increasing order, from left to right, in each row. These tableau are naturally in bijection with the cosets of the corresponding Young subgroup (or standard parabolic) in the full symmetric group and hence they index bases for various permutation modules, which is why it will be useful to have them.

The shape of a row standard tableau should really be a composition, rather than a partition, but implementing tableau of composition shape would take significantly more effort. For the corresponding modules, up to isomorphism, it is enough to consider row standard tableaux of partition shape so this ticket only considers row standard tableau of partition (tuple) shape. It also defines residue sequences for such tableaux, which are needed in the KLR setting.

The new classes implemented are:

```
RowStandardTableaux
RowStandardTableaux_all
RowStandardTableaux_size
RowStandardTableaux_shape
RowStandardTableauTuples
RowStandardTableauTuples_all
RowStandardTableauTuples_level
RowStandardTableauTuples_size
RowStandardTableauTuples_level_size
RowStandardTableauTuples_shape
RowStandardTableaux_residue
RowStandardTableaux_residue_shape
```

The last commit message is misleading: this commit makes `StandardTableauTuples` inherit from `RowStandardTableauTuples` but I ended up leaving `StandardTableaux` inheriting from `SemiStandardTableaux`, and not making it inherit from `RowStandardTableaux` as well, because having it inherit from both wouldn't gain anything and would probably result in a fractional slow-down. The problem is that `StandardTableaux` now has two natural parents and there is no reason to prefer one over the other so I let the code history in sage decide. Currently this doesn't affect anything because, for example,

```
sage: [[1,2,3],[4,5]] in RowStandardTableaux()
True
sage: [[1,2,3],[4,5]] in RowStandardTableaux(5)
True
sage: StandardTableau([[1,2,3],[4,5]]) in RowStandardTableaux(5)
True
```
works as one would expect.

The patchbot errors seem to all be documentation and this builds fine for me. Am missing something?

Thanks Darij! Sorry! I completely agree. I think that all of these are fixed in my soon-to-be-uploaded commit. At the same time, I have put in slightly better tests in the sense that the row standard tests now typically use tableaux that are row standard but not standard whereas previously they were often standard tableaux (which are of course also row standard, but that's not the point).

This ticket refactors the standard tableaux classes through the row standard classes. As part of this refactoring `StandardTableaux_size` is now a derived class of `DisjointUnionEnumeratedSets` so the iterator comes for free.

>and why there are so many seemingly unrelated changes to other classes. 


As far as I can see there is only one not directly related change and this is adding `block` methods to `Partition` and `PartitionTuple`. In fact, these are related because these classes implement the combinatorial machinery needed to index bases for the standard modules of the KLR algebras of type `A` and the `block` methods determine when these modules belong to the same block. Apart from this, this ticket only implements row standard tableau of partition and partition tuple shape together with residue sequences for these tableaux. The residue sequences are of course crucial in the KLR setting. The residue sequence classes are not described in the ticket description but they do appear in the list of new classes at the bottom. I can add a description if you'd like.

<a id='comment:22'></a>Now I got a little carried away with doing cleanup for `Tableau(Tuple)`, but some of it was necessary for compatibility with the changes I wanted to do here. In particular, these resulted in a 3x speedup for iteration of the tableau tuples with a fix residue sequence. I also got some other iterator speed improvements, and now the code is using more standard idioms and/or less duplicate checking. There is likely more refactoring to be done, but this overall improves the situation IMO.

TL;DR If my changes are good, then positive review.

<a id='comment:23'></a>Doc of class RowStandardTableaux still speaks of standard tableaux. Also this is wrong:

```
+        elif n in SkewPartitions():
+            from sage.combinat.skew_tableau import StandardSkewTableaux
+            return StandardSkewTableaux(n)
```

I see the word "semirow" used several times in the doc of tableau tuple classes, but never defined.

```
    A class for row standard tableau of shape a partition tuple. This is
    a tuple of row standard tableau with entries `1, 2, \ldots, n`, where `n`
    is the size of the underlying partition tuple, such that the entries
    increase along rows in each component of the tuple.
```
This isn't very clear. You want to say:

```
    A class for row standard tableau tuples of shape a partition tuple.

    A row standard tableau tuple of shape
    `(\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \ldots, \lambda_k)` is a tuple
    `(T_1, T_2, \ldots, T_k)`, where each `T_i` is a tableau
    of shape `\lambda_i` whose entries increase along rows, and
    with the following property: If we set
    `n = |\lambda_1| + |\lambda_2| + \cdots + |\lambda_k|`,
    then each of the numbers `1, 2, \ldots, n` appears
    in exactly one of the `T_i`, and appears exactly once in
    this `T_i`.
```

In the `tableau_tuple.py` file, shouldn't `Class RowStandardTableaux_residue` be renamed `Class RowStandardTableauTuples_residue`?

I have rewritten this as:

{{{
    A row standard tableau tuple of size `n` is an ordered tuple of row
    standard tableaux (see :class:`RowStandardTableau`), with entries `1, 2,
    \ldots, n` such that, in each component, the entries are in increasing
    order along each row. If the tableau in component `k` has shape
    `\lambda^{(k)}` then `\lambda=(\lambda^{(1)},\ldots,\lambda^{(l)}` is a
    :class:`PartitionTuple`.

}}}

Using `lambda_k` to refer the the components of the partition is likely to confuse because `\lambda_k` is commonly used for a part of a partition. Having explicit references to the row
standard and partition tuple classes should remove any ambiguity.

I have rewritten the documentation for the block method. In particular, previously it said towards the end that this method is for blocks of the cyclotomic Hecke algebras of type A and it now says this at the top and with a little more detail. I have replaced `quantum characteristic` with `:meth:quantum_characteristic`

I also fixed up the referencing relating to this ticket -- there are still a few other embedded references in these files rather than in `index.rst`...

Ah, I see that I was updating code for the block method of a residue sequence. I have now also revised the documentation for the `block` methods of partitions and partition tuples.
