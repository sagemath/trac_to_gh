The function `ctypes.util.find_library` does not currently work on Cygwin (though there is a patch I'm going to try to get upstream into Python...eventually...).

I'm not sure the approach I've taken is necessarily the best.  I added a `find_library` function to `sage.misc.misc` which by default is just the original `ctypes.util.find_library`, but uses the Cygwin version on Cygwin (and has the potential to have other platform-specific versions).

I don't think `sage.misc.misc` is necessarily the best place for this, but I do think it would be good (if there isn't already) if Sage had a place for platform/python-version compatibility wrappers.  I think it's definitely better to provide workarounds directly in Sage wherever possible, rather than relying on upstream patches.  And having a compatibility module for Python issues specifically is generally pretty straightforward.

That said, I don't know that there are currently many examples of this in Sage.  Or if there are they're scattered about at random.

This also fixes one related test that fails on Cygwin (on Cygwin libc is found in cygwin.dll, not in a file with "libc" in the name).

Rebased, and moved things around a bit so that this is in a new `sage.misc.compat` module, which I think makes sense to have.

Will still be nice to get this fixed upstream in Python, which I will try to do.  But it will probably take a while, and probably won't even happen except in Python 3.

Alternative solution to the original problem: don't use `ctypes.util.find_library` in the Sage library. It is used only in one place. It turns out that this can easily be avoided because:

1. You could replace the usage of `ctypes` by Cython.

2. The only line where `ctypes` is needed is to call `self._libc().signal(SIGPROF, SIG_DFL)` but that could be replaced by Python's `signal.signal()` instead. I might be missing something, but that should work too...

This definitely needs a doctest. I don't feel like installing `gperftools` just to test this.

I suggest to add a doctest to the module docstring, to ensure that `find_library` will be tested both on Cygwin and non-Cygwin systems.

FWIW the doctests in gperftools do test this, and they pass.  I don't think you need gperftools installed just to test it.  But I don't mind adding a module-level doctest.

Alternatively, for better consistency across platforms, it might be better if our own `find_library` wrapper were defined in all cases.  In most cases it would then just defer to the implementation in ctypes.  Then I can put the doctest in the function docstring.

Right, but then you only test `find_library` if you run the optional `gperftools` tests.

I don't care much. I just want a non-optional doctest one way or another.

FWIW, this does work on Linux because it tries a number of different strategies to find libraries on Linux, one of which is to actually call `ld` with the `--trace` flag which will actually print out whatever library gcc finds for the given library name.  And because sage-env sets `LDFLAGS` we get the right result for libraries installed in Sage.

I'm curious about a few things. First, why use

```
if sys.platform == 'cygwin':
    def _find_library(name):
        ...
elif ...
    def _find_library(name):
```
as compared to

```
def _find_library(name):
    if sys.platform == 'cygwin':
        ...
    elif
        ...
```
or

```
def find_library(name):

        ...

        ...

?

Second, is the resulting version of `find_library` different enough from the standard Python one that it should have a new name?

Third, why use `sage_wraps`? It conceals the new docstring and source code when doing introspection.

Fourth, is there any particular reason the copyright is in William Stein's name, not yours?

This is a normal pattern, especially for a system compatibility module like this.  Think of it like an `#ifdef` in C.  This defines different implementations of the function for different platforms, rather that having one big implementation with per-platform implementations in an if-statement.

> Second, is the resulting version of `find_library` different enough from the standard Python one that it should have a new name?


No, it is the same thing.  Again, the point of this is to provide a compatible replacement.

> Third, why use `sage_wraps`? It conceals the new docstring and source code when doing introspection.


The docstring here is for developer documentation, not user documentation.  Again, this is just providing a replacement for the system builtin which is missing / buggy / incomplete in the default implementation.

> Fourth, is there any particular reason the copyright is in William Stein's name, not yours?


I probably copied it from somewhere else.  Frankly, I don't care. I hereby give copyright of my code to William Stein.

You should also add to the docstring something like "This provides a replacement for the Python function ctypes.util.find_library, adding ...". It will be much easier to maintain if future users know why the changes were made.

Finally, Sage development policy is that every function and method should have a docstring which includes an EXAMPLES block. Please add those to both instances of `_find_library`.

There is nothing in the Sage developer's guide about exceptions for internal details, and many such details are documented, with doctests. The documentation is not just for users, but for developers: ease of maintenance, etc. Same with doctests: it is extremely useful to know if something internal breaks.

I'm not sure what you mean, since the heading is already "EXAMPLES:", which is perfect. For the two `_find_library` functions, you could add exactly the same doctest or something else ('gap', for example).

1. Try `try` block is too small: anything changing `os.environ['DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH']` should be inside the try.

2. The `finally` does not remove the environment variable `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` if it was unset before.

There is also a style issue:

with code of the form

```
change_state()

try:
    ...
finally:
    reset_state()
```
it is more likely that people will write code between `change_state()` and the `try` statement:

```
change_state()

code_added_here_by_mistake()

try:
    ...
finally:
    reset_state()
```
When everything is inside the `try`, this is much less likely to happen.

Please elaborate...

I have fixed many race conditions in Sage. They may be unlikely, but not hypothetical.

For me, it's a simple discussion: the code that I propose is more correct than the code that you propose (for example: my code will deal correctly with a `KeyboardInterrupt` between the `chdir()` system call and the entering of the `try` block).

So you need to explain either why I'm wrong, or why, despite my code being more correct, your code is still better anyway (and correctness of code beats PEP 8 hands down).

The problem is that you are confusing the `os.chdir()` Python function with the `chdir(2)` system call.

Your statement is correct when interpreting it as the system call. Unfortunately, in Python, it is possible that the Python function raises an exception even if the system call succeeded (and this isn't hypothetical, I have managed to reproduce exactly this with `os.fork()`).

PS 1: Even the Python standard library suffers from such issues. I remember debugging a race condition in the Sage Notebook which was traced to the Python `tempfile` module.

PS 2: This is exactly why I prefer to use Cython for anything involving system calls. It doesn't suffer from these issues because you can call the system call directly.

What do you mean with "any possible state"? I think that there are only 2 possibilities: either the value in the dict was updated, or it wasn't. If you are worrying about deleting a key which may not exist, you can use `os.environ.pop(key, None)`.

{
    "body": "<a id='comment:66'></a>\nFirst of all, is a signal is delivered during the call of a *python* function like `os.chdir()` it doesn't matter if the signal is delivered before or after the system call.  Python will note it and call the Python-level signal handler *after* the completion of that call instruction, before executing the next Python instruction.  So actually it doesn't matter whether or not the system call failed because the keyboard interrupt will always be raised after (and if it did succeed then you do have a point, though only if some code higher up is catching the `KeyboardInterrupt`).

First of all, is a signal is delivered during the call of a *python* function like `os.chdir()` it doesn't matter if the signal is delivered before or after the system call.  Python will note it and call the Python-level signal handler *after* the completion of that call instruction, before executing the next Python instruction.  So actually it doesn't matter whether or not the system call failed because the keyboard interrupt will always be raised after (and if it did succeed then you do have a point, though only if some code higher up is catching the `KeyboardInterrupt`).  These details are also probably CPython-specific but that's the only Python implementation we care about.

I don't think it's particularly more or less correct.

For example, if you *really* wanted to handle the possibility of an exception occurring in `os.environ.__setter__` the most correct way would actually be something like:

```
old_foo = os.environ['FOO']  # Also, where should this go??
try:
    try:
        os.environ['FOO'] = bar
        cleanup = True
    except:
        cleanup = False
        raise

     do_stuff()
finally:
    if cleanup:
        os.environ['FOO'] = old_foo
```

And even this is less than perfect because if an exception occurs during `os.environ['FOO']` you can't say for sure if the system call itself succeeded unless you handle specific exceptions like `MemoryError` versus `KeyboardInterrupt` separately.  Also in my example above an exception could occur between `os.environ['FOO'] = bar` and `cleanup = True`.  Even `cleanup = True` might not work correctly, albeit due to [a bug in Python](http://bugs.python.org/issue30744) :)  I suppose that during the cleanup you could check `os.environ['FOO'] != old_foo` but my point is that if you're at that level of micro-optimisation for exceptional conditions you probably shouldn't be writing it in Python in the first place.  

In fact if you just read the Python documentation the vast majority of similar examples are *not* written like this.  For example a very common idiom is with locks:

```
    lock.acquire()
    try:
        do_something()
    finally:
        lock.release()
```

Same if you use `with lock:` since the above is essentially the pseudo-code for how the `with` statement is implemented.  At the level of the Python interpreter there are two separate instructions `SETUP_WITH` and `WITH_CLEANUP`.  If an exception occurs after the `SETUP_WITH` but before `WITH_CLEANUP` it will always jump to `WITH_CLEANUP` before raising.  However, if an exception occurs inside the context-manager's `__enter__` then `__enter__` never returns (sucessfully) and the block inside the `with` statement is not set up (and hence the "finally" block that calls the `__exit__` is never set up either).  So the end result is the same as the above pseudo-code.

If what you're describing is really a problem then code like, when using locks this could lead to deadlocks.  But at the same time it's not appropriate to try to call `lock.release()` unless `lock.acquire()` *definitely* succeeded, in which case you need extra exception handling around `lock.acquire()`.

So with all that said, I think if you're really convinced that this order of doing things is "wrong" this is the wrong place to split hairs about it, and you should bring it up with python-ideas.  Honestly I'd probably even support you there if you demonstrated a good example of it.

This is not actually true. I actually tested this and the `__exit__` in a `with` block *is* called, even if an interrupt occurs during `__enter__`.

In other words, this Python code

```
lock.__enter__()
try:
    ...
finally:
    lock.__exit__()
```
is unsafe while

```
with lock:
    ...
```
is safe from this race condition.

Of course, this is only really true if `__enter__` is implemented in C or Cython. In pure Python, `__enter__` itself could raise a `KeyboardInterrupt`. But `threading.Lock` is implemented in C, so that example would work.

I don't see how that is relevant to the current discussion. Why should it matter whether or not other people make the same mistake?

Now, back to this ticket. Concretely, I propose to

1. Move all code which changes `os.environ` *inside* the `try` block.

2. Replace `del os.environ['DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH']` by `os.environ.pop('DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH', None)`

As far as I can tell, this is 100% safe and no more complicated than the current code.

If you are interested, this test code shows the difference between `try`/`finally` and `with` for `threading.Lock`:

```python
from cysignals.tests import interrupt_after_delay
from time import sleep
from threading import Lock


def try_release(lock):
    try:
        lock.release()
    except Exception:
        return False
    return True


def test_lock1(lock, ms):
    try:
        interrupt_after_delay(ms)
        with lock:
            while True:
                sleep(1)
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        pass

    
def test_lock2(lock, ms):
    try:
        interrupt_after_delay(ms)
        lock.acquire()
        try:
            while True:
                sleep(1)
        finally:
            lock.release()
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        pass


lock = Lock()

for a in range(1000):
    for t in range(8):
        test_lock1(lock, t)
        if try_release(lock):
            print("test_lock1 #{}: lock was held (t={})".format(a, t))

        test_lock2(lock, t)        
        if try_release(lock):
            print("test_lock2 #{}: lock was held (t={})".format(a, t))

print("DONE")
```

It is not hard to reproduce the situation where the lock ends up being locked after calling `test_lock2`. With `test_lock1`, this never happens.

Exactly, but that's an implementation detail.  It works out that way if `__enter__` is written in C because there are no Python opcodes executed by the function, so the interrupt isn't handled and the exception is not raised until after the C function has returned and the frame for the `with` statement block has been set up.

As far as the Python documentation and language design go, however, this distinction does not exist.  However, you do have a good point here--it might be worth bringing up to the Python folks.

My point is that you're obsessing over implementation details about CPython in order to make sweeping statements about actually pretty standard patterns being "wrong".

Come on Erik, I think that's not very fair. On [comment:70], I made a very concrete suggestion for a small and simple fix. I still don't get why you refuse to make that change. I just pushed that change myself.

I hope that we can still resolve this discussion in friendliness...

I agree with this and understand your frustration. Let's just say that you were unlucky that you got hit by several people insisting strongly on a minor issue.

To be 100% honest, I do think that you could have avoided some trouble here by just doing what the reviewers (John and me) asked you to change instead of going into a lengthy discussion. For example, even if you think that my most recent change wasn't required, it doesn't hurt either.

Anyway, as far as I'm concerned, this ticket is good to go.

Let me ask you this though: Say I had explicitly implemented a context manager for setting/restoring an environment variable (something I feel like I've done dozens of times before in writing test suites).  Would you have raised an objection in that case?  Because all I'm doing here is hand-writing the context manager protocol out of laziness.

In other words (and I didn't know this) if I have:

```
os.environ['FOO'] = 'a'
try:
    ...
```

the disassembly looks like

```
STORE_SUBSCR
SETUP_FINALLY
```

so this is actually atomic.  But it's not perfect--my actual code was like:

```
if something:
    os.environ['FOO'] = 1
else:
    os.environ['FOO'] = 2
try:
    ...
```

In this case, in one of the branches (probably the second one) the `STORE_SUBSCR` will be atomic with `SETUP_FINALLY`, whereas in the first branch there's a `JUMP_FORWARD` first.  Really it would need to be smarter, either by following jumps to see what the next instruction would be, or perhaps better something more like Nick Coghlan's idea of having a generic way to make all ops up to a particular instruction atomic w.r.t. signals.

It's hard to answer such hypothetical questions.

Anyway, the Python bug made me realize that it's simply very hard (if not impossible) to write 100% interrupt-safe Python code. So I do feel a bit stupid now for insisting so much.

On a Virtulbox running Windows10 professional, I compiled 8.0.rc0 + #23339 + #21233 + #23097 + #21399 (present ticket) with the options :

```
export PREREQ_OPTIONS=--with-blas=atlas
export SAGE_ATLAS_LIB=/usr/lib
export MAKE="make -j4"
```

This passes ptestlong with no failures.

==> positive_review

Note : I have no advice on the contents of the patches (I do not know Cygwin well enough to undetstand what they are supposed to do) ; I just checked that this leads to a functional Sage.
