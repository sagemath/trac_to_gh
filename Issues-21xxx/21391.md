This is to have a place for code examples and discussion of impact of the proposal in https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!topic/sage-devel/auLwQWtpnz0

The following produces a segmentation fault (Sage 7.4, Ubuntu 14.04 or OS X 10.10.5),
see [Ask Sage](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/35770/).

```
sage: F = GF(3)
sage: num, den = F(2)*x + F(1), x
sage: num/den
 ... segmentation fault ...
```

With this branch this gives: `TypeError: Multiplication of symbolic variable and an element of a ring with positive characteristic.`
