```
The tensor product of cohomology rings of product of two spaces is twisted in the following sense:

(a ⊗ b) ⌣ (c ⊗ d) = (-1)<sup>|b|·|c|</sup>(a ⌣ c)⊗(b ⌣ d)

However there is no way to inform sage of this twisting at the moment:

```
S_2 = delta_complexes.SurfaceOfGenus(2);
H = S_2.cohomology_ring(QQ);
H2 = tensor([H,H]); 
```
In H2 the multiplication is the non-twisted one.

maybe tensor([H,H], twisted=True) could be introduced.

<div id="comment:1" align="right">comment:1</div>

So for this, the tensor creates an instance of `sage.combinat.free_module.CombinatorialFreeModule_Tensor`, which is in the category

```sage
sage: H2.category()
Category of finite dimensional tensor products of algebras with basis over Rational Field
```
Now the easiest way out would be creating a class for the tensor product of two homology spaces (which could be something we might want anyways) that inherits from `CombinatorialFreeModule_Tensor` and overrides `product_on_basis` (which comes from the category).

Another approach that is more work, but much more gratifying (and something we need to do) is changing around the categories. In particular, from Hatcher, the cohomology over a commutative ring is a commutative superalgebra. So we would need to change its category:

```sage
sage: H.category()
Category of finite dimensional graded algebras with basis over Rational Field
```
Then we would need to create a category of tensor products of commutative superalgebras with a default (twisted) multiplication.

I'm more for doing option 2, but it could have some technical issues that we might have to work through as well. I'll leave the choice up to you.

Ok, I'm fine with both ways (the second seems more future proof, so that would be my personal choice).

The only problem is that I have very little idea about sage type theory... err.. the categorical background behind sage objects ;-)

looking at superalgebras definition (acutally never heard of) Clifford algebras are also the natural examples.

So: where can I learn about category structures as implemented in sage?

In the `src/sage/categories/` folder is where the source code is. There's a detailed description of Sage's category framework [here](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/categories/sage/categories/primer.html). [Simon King's tutorial](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/thematic_tutorials/coercion_and_categories.html) is more on creating parents and elements, so doesn't quite apply.

One of the easiest ways to start working on this would be to copy code from elsewhere in Sage. I would probably mimic what is done in `sage/categories/algebras.py` first (don't forget to also add the imports).

Yes, Clifford algebras are the standard examples of superalgebras. Exterior algebras (which are a special case of Clifford algebras) and their generalizations of C(D)GA (Commutative (Differential) Graded Algebras) are also another class of good examples.

It looks that it would be nice to have `SuperAlgebrasWithBasis.example()`;

Also I think something should be put to cohomology documentation as a (test case?)
that the tensor-product of cohomologies (e.g. H¹(S¹)⊗H¹(S¹)) respects the anticommutativity present in (i.e. H¹(S¹×S¹)).

What do You think?


Below is the very first try; For now without any docs.

The second looks good, but for the first, you should also add `.Commutative()`.

> It looks that it would be nice to have SuperAlgebrasWithBasis.example();

I think having a `Superalgebras(R).example()` should be done as a separate ticket (but +1 to doing it).

> Also I think something should be put to cohomology documentation as a (test case?) that the tensor-product of cohomologies (e.g. H¹(S¹)⊗H¹(S¹)) respects the anticommutativity present in (i.e. H¹(S¹×S¹)). 

+1 to adding such an example to the cohomology ring doc.

Then why is Commutative commented from axiom_whitelist in `super_modules.py`?

I know it is a matter of convention (CDGAs are commutative, where we mean graded anitcommutativity, etc.), so what does actually the axiom_list mean?

Does Algebras(R).Commutative() mean something else than Algebras(R).Graded().Commutative() (as it should?) Where can one find out?

Ok, I'm struggling with yet another problem:

To confirm that cohomology rings are recognized as super:

```
sage: S_2 = delta_complexes.SurfaceOfGenus(1);
sage: H = S_2.cohomology_ring();
sage: H.category()
Join of 
Category of graded algebras with basis over Rational Field and 
Category of finite dimensional algebras with basis over Rational Field and 
Category of super algebras over Rational Field and 
Category of commutative algebras over Rational Field
```

Yet tensor product of those is not a super algebra (I also checked `.categories()`:

```
sage: H2 = H.tensor(H);
sage: H2.category()
Category of finite dimensional tensor products of algebras with basis over Rational Field
```

I thought it's enough to add 

```
def extra_super_categories(self):
    return [self.base_category()]

```
to `SuperAlgebrasWithBasis.TensorProducts`, to make sage recognize tensor product of super algebras as a super algebra. It does so on the category level:

```
sage: SuperAlgebrasWithBasis(QQ).TensorProducts().super_categories()
[Category of super algebras with basis over Rational Field,
 Category of tensor products of algebras with basis over Rational Field]
```

Cool. Yet the example as above still fails to live up to category of super algebras;
I also checked that `H2.product_on_basis` points to the method from the category of algebras;

What am I missing??

Well, to be fair, this is a much more challenging example of a category construction.

It means every superalgebra with basis is (naturally) a graded algebra with basis.

That is because we construct a super algebra from an algebra via a functorial construction (i.e., adding the grading), whereas an algebra is a concrete category created by imposing axioms. It is related to the second paragraph, and is the reasoning why we need a stub category (at least, for the code).

If I understand Correctly I have to implement `GradedSuperAlgebrasWithBasis` as an object of `GradedSuperModulesCategory` which then should be object of the join of (I mean inherit from both of) (`Regressive`?)`CovariantConstructionCategory` and `Category_over_base_ring`?

If we have this I need to 

* add `Commutative` axiom to both `SuperAlgebras` and `SuperAlgebrasWithBasis`, so that (deconstructing call creating cohomology ring) `SuperAlgebras(base_ring).WithBasis().Graded().FiniteDimensional().Commutative()` constructs
  1. first a (regressive) object of `GradedSuperAlgebrasWithBasis`, then
  2. (insert some magic here) adds Commutative axiom.

Then the final thing will be an object of `CategoryWithAxiom_over_base_ring`, i.e. a superalgebra (with presence of basis and grading now "shadowed" by insertion of the axiom `Commutative`) and therefore call to `TensorProduct` will finally pick the right category (and `product_on_basis()`).

Is that correct?

Question no. 1: `SuperModulesCategory` (super of `SuperAlgebrasWithBasis`) is not considered **Regressive** (as `GradedModulesCategory` is). As far as I understand the goal is to implement e.g. tensor product of superalgebras as a superalgebra, hence `SuperAlgebraWithBasis` should be considered as Regressive? Is there a need to reflect that in code?

Question no. 2: Implementing the axiom `Commutative` should I create separate files "commutative_super_algebras.py" with `class CommutativeSuperAlgebra(CategoryWithAxiom_over_base_ring)`, or should I rather implement those as subclasses in super_algebras.py (and similarly for "_with_basis")?
