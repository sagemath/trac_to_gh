Note, the package currently is a "script" package whose `spkg-install` calls "pip".
Can't make it a "pip" package at the moment because some environment variables need to be set.

You can already install it in sage through PyPI

```
$ sage -pip install pypolymake
```
and even the development version with

```
$ sage -pip install git+https://github.com/videlec/pypolymake.git
```

(it does not work for everybody, [including me right now](https://github.com/videlec/pypolymake/issues/13))

I thought so...

BTW, I'll try to create a pexpect interface to polymake, see #22452. I guess having Python bindings and a pexpect interface at the same time (similar to having libsingular and the Singular pexpect interface) would be a good argument for making Polymake a standard package.

To my mind, polymake is too fragile (and too big) to become standard, or even optional.

Is "big" a problem? In what sense is it fragile? Does Polymake change its API very often? Does it have too many serious bugs to be useful? Till now, I didn't have that impression, but perhaps I didn't use Polymake intensely enough.

It does not seem to be that big. However compilation takes a lot of time. 

> In what sense is it fragile?


This is a more serious issue: compilation is fragile. You need a working perl environment which are configured differently on different computers. See for example [this sage-devel thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/h2QKknRAVwA).

No polymake is a very neat software! Only installation is delicate.
