Add vertical composition of lattices, i.e. the ordinal sum of `A` and `B` with the top of `A` and bottom of `B` unified.

(Also add `is_[meet|join]_distributive()` to index of functions with this.)

OK for me. (But you forgot a colon, and when I corrected that, I noticed that I had added another `SEEALSO` block to a function already having one.)

I have no preference between `b_K` and `\bottom_K`, but now they are different in this and `star_product` in `posets.py`. To be resolved later.

I have no opinion at all, so even a weak opinion is enought to use `b_K`. And `\bot` is kind of used already in `is_orthocomplemented`.
