After #19122, counting points at infinity still needs to be fixed for hyperelliptic curves of genus 1 given by an equation `y^2 + h(x)*y = f(x)` when `h != 0`.  Consider the following example (cf.[comment:17](#comment%3A17):ticket:19122):

```
def test(p):
    S.<z> = GF(p)[]
    D = HyperellipticCurve(-z^2 + z, z^2)
    return D.count_points_exhaustive()
```
Running this for `p = 2` and `p = 3` gives

```
sage: test(2)
[4]
sage: test(3)
[4]  # or [3], after #19122
```
Both answers should be 5.

The attached branch fixes the bug basically by removing the special case *g* = 1 in `cardinality_exhaustive()`.  It also streamlines the code, making the parallels between the computations in the various cases (affine and infinite points, even and odd characteristic) more apparent.
