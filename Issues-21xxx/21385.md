`Parent.__init__()` takes a `gens` keyword argument, but it turns out that nothing in Sage actually uses this argument. So we simply remove it. Then we can also remove the `_populate_generators_` method which is never actually called.

I don't see the point of deprecation here because the `gens` do not work anyway. Currently, the `gens` are passed to `_populate_generators_` which assigns a `_generators` attribute which is then never used.

So I am not removing any functionality, I am basically just removing dead code.

In any case, this ticket depends on #21382 which should be reviewed first.

Fine then. (I hadn't paid attention to the fact that `Parent.__init__()` also accepted `**kwds`, sorry.)

Yes, I posted the comment here since it applied to the second commit, but I was actually waiting for your answer to set the first ticket to positive review `:-)`.
