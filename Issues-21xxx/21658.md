```
For any type `t`, the following should not crash Python:

```
t.__new__(t)
```

For `Element` classes, we also test

```
t.__new__(t, parent)
```
where `parent` is a parent (this mimics a typical call to `__new__` for elements).

It is of course legal for this to raise ordinary exceptions.

One could argue that you should not call just `__new__` like this since this will create invalid objects anyway. That is true, but this test checks for bugs in the object creation and deletion code. For example, if `__new__` or `__init__` or code calling `__new__` raises a Python exception, then `__dealloc__` should not segfault (which is exactly what caused the crash reported at #21628).
