I have cured the symptoms and not the disease by moving a few imports of `six.moves.range` inside some functions (in 3 modules) instead of having them at the module level.

The culprits (triggering the import of six.moves.range in all sage) are some imports of these 3 modules in the following style

```
import blabla as bla
```
some of them occuring in elliptic curves.
