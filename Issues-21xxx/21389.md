This is a slight tweak to the docbuild code to avoid the overhead of using `multiprocessing.Pool` for a single-process doc build.

On Cygwin particularly the docbuild crashes when using multiprocessing.  This seems to be a Cygwin fork problem.  Nevertheless this simple change makes sense in general (even if single-process doc builds are not common on any other platform).
