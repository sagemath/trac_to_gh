New functions have been added: coset_leaders,  coset_weight_distribution, covering_radius(without Magma), newton_radius and unique_decoding_radius().

Documentation now is correct

Hello Irene,

I actually implemented a version of `covering_radius` which does not use GUAVA in
#19913. It automatically detects if GUAVA is installed, and if it's not, it uses a
very slow Python algorithm instead of using GUAVA.

We should benchmark your implementation and mine, and keep the fastest one.
BTW, I did some benchmarking GUAVA vs. naive Python implementation, and GUAVA was
always faster (which is why I automatically use GUAVA calls if the user has GUAVA installed).

David

In the _insert_next_fq method, you treat these two different cases:

```
        if List:
            for i in s:
                new = v.__copy__()
                for q in Fqstar:
                    new[i]=q
                    if new not in List:
                        List.append(new.__copy__())
        else:
            for i in s:
                new = v.__copy__()
                for q in Fqstar:
                    new[i]=q
                    List.append(new.__copy__())
```

is it really what you want to do? wouldn't it make sense to just use the first case everywhere?

That whole helper-method can be simplified into an almost-one-liner: all error-vectors of weight 1 can be created as:

```
   I = identity_matrix(F, n)
   single_errs = ( a * I.row(i) for a in F for i in range(n) )
```

Now you want to extend `List` with the elements `[ v + e for e in single_errs ]`. 
But you want to avoid duplicating the elements already in `List`. Therefore you should use a `set` for `List`. This causes a small snag since `set`s only work for **immutable** vectors.

Assuming `single_errs` was computed outside at the beginning of the method, then the update of `List` in the loop of `coset_leaders` could look like

```
    shifts = [ v + e for e in single_errs ]
    for w in shifts: w.set_immutable()
    List.union(shifts)
```

`List` breaks the convention of starting variables with minuscule. What about the name `worklist`?

Best,
Johan

I think the `if` condition should be kept. It makes a difference and avoids a linear search inside a `for` loop in the case `List` is empty.

> This causes a small snag since sets only work for immutable vectors.


I think we should not return immutable vectors from coset leaders. The output might be used for further computations by the user and then it will create strange issues, which will be hard to debug. The less surprises we have for the user, the better it is.

> `List` breaks the convention of starting variables with minuscule. What about the name `worklist`?


This can be done I suppose, just for consistency.

> The keyword algorithm for the "one"/"all" of coset_leaders is not good


I agree. This is not really a different algorithm.

If you care about the `coset_leaders` method I see many improvements possibles:
* use `deque` instead of `list` for the worklist;
* append generators instead of real lists;
* take care to enumerate your candidates uniquely;
* use a hashed container for the syndromes already seen;
* early abort when you have seen all the possible syndromes;
* normalize syndromes (e.g. only keep those starting with `1`).

Just as a quick model you might want to look at this:

```sage
import collections

def coset_leaders_one(C):
    H = C.parity_check_matrix().transpose()
    K = C.base_ring()
    q = K.cardinality()
    def my_generator(v):
        t = list(v)
        for i, vi in enumerate(v):
            if vi: break
            for a in K:
                if a:
                    t[i] = a
                    yield vector(t)
            t[i] = 0
    def normalize(s):
        for si in s:
            if si:
                return tuple(s / si)
        return tuple(s)
    z = vector(K, C.length())
    sz = normalize(C.syndrome(z))
    S = {sz: z}
    generators = collections.deque([my_generator(z)])
    target_size = (q ** H.ncols() - 1) // (q - 1) + 1
    while generators:
        g = generators.popleft()
        for v in g:
            syndrome = normalize(v*H)
            if syndrome not in S:
                S[syndrome] = v
                if len(S) == target_size:
                    r = [S.pop(sz)]
                    for s in S.values():
                        r.extend(a * s for a in K if a)
                    return r
                if not v[0]:
                    generators.append(my_generator(v))
```

You can adapt this for the case where you want them all.

The ticket where this should be done is #19913 .

Sadly I won't have time to do more on this in the foreseeable future, but would be pleased if someone else is motivated enough to integrate this on his own.

And as a side remark, the code in the branch from[comment:19](#comment%3A19) is even much better.

6 time faster on your example code:

```
sage: C
[7, 5, 3] Generalized Reed-Solomon Code over Finite Field in a of size 2^3
sage: %timeit coset_leaders_one(C)
100 loops, best of 3: 3.03 ms per loop
sage: %timeit _coset_leaders(C)
1000 loops, best of 3: 477 Âµs per loop
```

and on a some bigger examples

```
sage: C = codes.random_linear_code(GF(7), 32, 27)
sage: %timeit coset_leaders_one(C)
1 loop, best of 3: 1.35 s per loop
sage: %timeit _coset_leaders(C)
10 loops, best of 3: 78.2 ms per loop
sage: C = codes.random_linear_code(GF(3), 32, 22)
sage: %timeit coset_leaders_one(C)
1 loop, best of 3: 23.8 s per loop
sage: %timeit _coset_leaders(C)
1 loop, best of 3: 1.18 s per loop
```

I didn't try with the implementation from here...
