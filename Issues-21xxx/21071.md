```
The following comes very unexpected

```
sage: ((1+x^2)/x^2).subs({x^2: 42})
43/x^2
```

The problem is the internal representation as

```
sage: ((1+x^2)/x^2).operands()
[x^2 + 1, x^(-2)]
```

I'm not completely sure I agree with this:

```diff
     sage: eq.substitute(a=x, x=1)
-    x + 1 == sin(1/x)
+    x + 1 == sin(1)
```
On the LHS, you simplify `x` then `a` (or simultaneously where one substitution does not affect the other), whereas on the RHS, you currently do `a`, then `x` (with the new `x` from the `a`). So I see this as an inconsistency. IMO, they should be done simultaneously, and the RHS should be `sin(1/x)`.

Quoting from [http://www.ginac.de/reference/basic_8cpp_source.html#l00606](http://www.ginac.de/reference/basic_8cpp_source.html#l00606), it looks like this is pretty fundamental:

``` 
  606 ex basic::subs(const exmap & m, unsigned options) const
  607 {
  608     size_t num = nops();
  609     if (num) {
  610 
  611         // Substitute in subexpressions
  612         for (size_t i=0; i<num; i++) {
  613             const ex & orig_op = op(i);
  614             const ex & subsed_op = orig_op.subs(m, options);
  615             if (!are_ex_trivially_equal(orig_op, subsed_op)) {
  616 
  617                 // Something changed, clone the object
  618                 basic *copy = duplicate();
  619                 copy->clearflag(status_flags::hash_calculated | status_flags::expanded);
  620 
  621                 // Substitute the changed operand
  622                 copy->let_op(i++) = subsed_op;
  623 
  624                 // Substitute the other operands
  625                 for (; i<num; i++)
  626                     copy->let_op(i) = op(i).subs(m, options);
  627 
  628                 // Perform substitutions on the new object as a whole
  629                 return copy->subs_one_level(m, options);
  630             }
  631         }
  632     }
  633 
  634     // Nothing changed or no subexpressions
  635     return subs_one_level(m, options);
  636 }
```
The problem is that substitutions are done on the subexpressions and *then* on the entire expression. So, we have:

```
sage: (x/a).subs({a:x,x:1})
1/x
sage: (x/a).subs({a:x,x:1,1/x:17})
17
```
I'm pretty sure this is because of line 629. This is not because of premature evaluation (which, as you show, can also be an issue)

There is an ambiguity. What is the expected result of

```
sage: f = piecewise([((0,2), x), ([-2,0], -x)]
sage: (x+f).subs(x==1)

piecewise(x|-->1 on (0, 2), x|-->-1 on [-2, 0]; x) + 1
or
2?

Plot expects this to be `2`.
