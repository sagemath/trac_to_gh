This patch will add a function to iterate over isomorphic sublattices; compare to `isomorphic_subposets_iterator()`.

Implementation is trivial. Better ideas are welcome.

This (indirectly) calls `self.meet()` and `self.join()`, hence does not make sense to move function to posets.

In this implementation `other` can really be any poset, but if it is not a lattice by structure, the function will return empty list (i.e. instantly raise `StopIteration`). How should this behave?

Ah, yes. I agree.

You should add an example showing this happens and perhaps change the input to say <code>- \`\`other\`\` --  finite poset</code>.

One other little detail, remove the period in the `.. SEEALSO::` blocks.
