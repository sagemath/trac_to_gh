This patch will add a function to iterate over isomorphic sublattices; compare to `isomorphic_subposets_iterator()`.

Implementation is trivial. Better ideas are welcome.

You should add an example showing this happens and perhaps change the input to say `- ``other`` --  finite poset`.

One other little detail, remove the period in the `.. SEEALSO::` blocks.
