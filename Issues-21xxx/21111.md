This patch will unify keywords `certificate` and `certify` to just `certificate`.

I have no specific reason to select one over other; just that `certificate` is currently much more used.

This can be seen a continuation to the serie #19550, #19559, #19572 and to #19855.

Done at https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/b__PEZIjKmg . No clear conclusion: one wants 'certify', another "slightly prefers" 'certificate', third "have no strong opinion". Then 'certify' is shorter, but not much, and 'certificate' is currently more used, but maybe in parts that are not so much used(?).

I suggest that we proceed with this ticket, as we may as well toss a coin to resolve this.
