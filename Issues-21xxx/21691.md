The central objects for linear codes in Sage prints unnecessarily long, even though there are established conventions for shorter description. This ticket proposes a change to that:

```
Linear code of length 7, dimension 3 over Finite Field of size 2^3
   should be
[7, 3] linear code over GF(8)
```

Printing `GF(8)` is the only controversial thing here, from a Sage POV. The
argument is that linear codes are always over finite fields, so it is
unnecessarily verbose to insist on the long printing. (formally, using `LinearCode` over a ring has not been deprecated yet, see #20387, but a code over a ring is not a "linear code" in the classical sense)

Other proposed changes are:

* `Generalized Reed-Solomon Code` -> `Reed-Solomon Code` (whenever the column multipliers are all-1)
* `Extended code coming from <bla>` -> `Extension of <bla>`
* `Punctured code coming from <bla>` -> `Puncturing of <bla>`
* `Subfield subcode over <subfield> coming from <code>` -> `Subfield subcode of <bla> down to <subfield>`

Related objects (e.g. encoders and decoders) have been shortened similarly
(though much more could be done here).

An unrelated change which I put here anyway is a polishing of `AbstractLinearCode`'s class doc, and improved error messages for its `encoder()` and `decoder()` methods.

Hi Johan,

Nice changes, it makes it really more readable. I only have one suggestion for punctured codes. You wrote for instance: `Puncturing of [11, 5] linear code over GF(7) punctured (...)` but I think writing "Puncturing/punctured" only once would be even easier to read. However I'm not that fluent in english, so maybe I'm wrong...

I also made 3 optional doctests pass in guava.py and merge with the latest beta (7.5.beta1).

Julien

Hi Julien,
Thanks for the review and good catch with the optional doctests. I agree with you on the puncturing. What about `Puncturing of [11, 5] linear code over GF(7) at positions [1,2]`?

I would make the change, but I'm running some heavy computations and I'm worried that I'll break something by recompiling and experimenting. Could you do it?

Best,
Johan

Hi Johan,

I did that change. Patchbot also found doctest failures in some crazy tutorials (one about linear codes and ciphers, the other about graphs...). I fixed them.

I'll wait your green light on my changes to give the positive review.

Best,

Julien
