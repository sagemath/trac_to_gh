Hello,

There's only a few changes:

- I merged points 6. and 7. from the `Encoder` section, as advised.
- I fixed a typo.
- I added an extra comment on how to proceed if the developer wants to implement a "generic" decoder.

I might have forgot a few comments. I you can remember something I forgot to fix/find something else to fix, just let me know.

Setting on `needs_info` for now.

David
