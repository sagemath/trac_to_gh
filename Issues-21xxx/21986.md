The following is a common problem with infinite objects:

```
sage: B = crystals.infinity.Tableaux(["G", 2])
sage: latex(B) # Never stops
```

This happens because `B._latex_` is the implementation of generic _latex_ from sage/categories/crystals.py that calls `self.digraph()`. But `B.digraph()` is infinite.

Suggestions on how to fix this:
* `B.digraph()` should raise `NotImplementedError`, until we have a way to represent infinite digraphs. It is a better API, in my opinion, not to remove this method.
* `B.latex()` should return something like `"\\mathcal{B}"`, and adding a new method `B.tikz()` that for infinite crystals takes the LaTeX string of `B.subcrystal(max_depth=3)` and appends `"\\vdots"` to denote that it is an infinite crystal.

You are faster than me.
It might be my ignorance, but is the import of `CategoryWithAxiom` needed?
