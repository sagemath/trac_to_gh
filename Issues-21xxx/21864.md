From jdemeyer in #9536:

> it would make sense to use $PIP_INSTALL for a few more packages where no extra options are needed: fpylll, gambit, sagenb, sagetex.

This ticket makes Sage use `$PIP_INSTALL` for
- fpylll
- sagenb
- sagetex

Because of an [upstream issue](https://github.com/gambitproject/gambit/issues/207) with gambit, we exclude gambit for now.

I think I originally explicitly excluded those packages because it wasn't clear exactly what the impact would be and I didn't take the time to test it.  There should definitely be a ticket for this though.
