I'm not sure if this example from [ask.sagemath](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/35227/basic-question-about-annihilator/) is user error, bad doc, or a bug.

```
var('x0,x1,x2')
r0 = vector(QQ,[3,1,-2])
r1 = vector(QQ,[1,-5,3])
r = span([r0,r1])
s = 2*x0 - 3*x1 - 4*x2 == 0
r.annihilator([vector([2,-3,-4])])
```
result:

```
AttributeError: 'sage.rings.rational.Rational' object has no attribute '_vector_'
```

<div id="comment:4" align="right">Comment 4</div>

I believe that user wants

```
sage: v = vector([2,-3,-4])
sage: r.intersection(matrix(v).right_kernel())
Free module of degree 3 and rank 1 over Integer Ring
Echelon basis matrix:
[  4  60 -43]
```
Could you forward this along as I don't have an ask.sagemath account?

Also, I think of annihilators in a more general context, as a ring/algebra R acting on an R-module. This is an explicit assumption of `annihilator`:

```
The codomain is any vector space, and ``action`` is
linear on its first argument; typically it is bilinear;
```
Although the requirement that it is an honest action is not a strict requirement, but it must be something realizable as a module (vector space?).
