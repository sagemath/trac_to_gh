I am trying to build vaucanson in sage and I get the following problem with Cython 0.25.1 merged in 7.5.beta1 (#20596). That problem does not appear with Cython 0.24. But the problem is really in backport_abc package not in Cython.

I would like to make vaucanson as an optional Sage package.

Question: I am trying to find a workaround. I was thinking to add a patch on Cython-0.25.1. But where is the file backports_abc.py ? It does not seem to be inside of Cython-0.25.1 ?

Jeroen, if you agree, I will change the title of this ticket to "update backports_abc to 0.5" and I suggest to not close this ticket as "won't fix".

For the same reason as there was a `.p0` in the version number for 0.4 without any patches to apply. So I removed the `.p0` to be consistent with the fact that there is no patches to apply.

I also added a link to the tarball available on pypi in the first line of description of this ticket.

Needs review.
