The IML package should be better wrapped up, for instance in `sage/libs/iml`. The functions are hidden in `sage/matrix/matrix_integer_dense.pyx`.

There is a problem that IML conflicts with linbox: https://github.com/linbox-team/linbox/issues/35

For instance, adding : 

```
cdef extern from "linbox/solutions/solve.h" namespace "LinBox":
     pass
```
on top of `sage/matrix/matrix_integer_dense.pyx` prevents it from compiling.

<a id='comment:5'></a>What is the point of this:

```
cdef long iml_nullspaceMP(long n, long m, const mpz_t *A, mpz_t * *mp_N_pass):
    return nullspaceMP(n, m, A, mp_N_pass)

cdef iml_nonsingSolvLlhsMM(SOLU_POS solupos, long n, long m, mpz_t *mp_A, mpz_t *mp_B, mpz_t mp_N, mpz_t mp_D):
    nonsingSolvLlhsMM(solupos, n, m, mp_A, mp_B, mp_N, mp_D)
```
Why not just call the IML functions directly?

If it's related to the problem in the ticket description, I'd rather try to fix that problem or at least understand why it does not work.
