It would be nice to have the cup product available for arbitrary cochains, without involving `homology_vector_space_with_basis`. Of course its not well-defined on the level of cochains, but at least one could check that products are non-zero if there is torsion over ZZ etc.

There are potentially two places where to put it:

* Method of `Chain.Element`, then chains would need to know about their cell (sub)complex. Right now they don't reference their cell complex as far as I can see. 

* Method `GenericCellComplex.cup_product(self, left_cochain, right_cochain)`. Then chains need to know their degree (dimension of cells). Right now they don't store their degree, although the documentation says that they must be of homogeneous degree.

Thoughts?
