It would be nice to have the cup product available for arbitrary cochains, without involving `homology_vector_space_with_basis`. Of course its not well-defined on the level of cochains, but at least one could check that products are non-zero if there is torsion over ZZ etc.

There are potentially two places where to put it:

* Method of `Chain.Element`, then chains would need to know about their cell (sub)complex. Right now they don't reference their cell complex as far as I can see. 

* Method `GenericCellComplex.cup_product(self, left_cochain, right_cochain)`. Then chains need to know their degree (dimension of cells). Right now they don't store their degree, although the documentation says that they must be of homogeneous degree.

Thoughts?

Using `Chain.Element` seems good to me. It doesn't look like the `Chains` class is used much, so I think we could add extra arguments to the `__init__` method specifying the degree and the associated cell complex.

(The `Chains` class could use other improvements, too, like a map to the associated chain complex.)

There is something wrong here (cochains should be chains in the OUTPUT):

```
+    def dual(self):
+        """
+        Return the chains
+
+        OUTPUT:
+
+        The cochains of the same cells with the same base ring.
```
and also here (two blank lines is too much):

```
+        Integer. The dimension of the cells.
+
+        EXAMPLES::
+
+
+            sage: X = simplicial_complexes.Simplex(2)
```
