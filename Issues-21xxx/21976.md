At the moment, (many) multivariate laurent polynomials and their rings are expensively converted when passed through `_element_constructor_`. The aim of this ticket is to detect a couple of special cases, where this can be done more directly, e.g., if the to-be-converted element has the same parent or the same polynomial ring as the laurent polynomial ring.

Along the way, I pickling bug is fixed.

Looks good. I have two questions:

```
-        if P is self:
-            return x
```
Shouldn't we have this speedup (as there is really nothing to do in this case)?

```
-        elif P == self:
-            return element_class(self, x)
```
Skipping this indeed will result in the same behavior. A question: Should we keep this after all in the spirit of "Explicit is better than implicit"?
