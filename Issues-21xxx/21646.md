This patch will slightly modify instructions for docstrings.

I would like to have even more pre-specified formats for some classes of functions. For example should Boolean-valued `is_something()` function be "Return `True` if...", "Test whether" or something else? Also we have an arbitrary decision to use `algorithm=` instead of `implementation=`, `method=` etc.

But as a first part, what you think about these changes?

Sohehow "Use `algorithm` if there are several algorithms or backend programs to select from." sounds odd to me. It left me wondering what else I could use or what is the meaning of this sentence. Compare to "- - describes the function or method's effect as a command - - *not* as a description - -"

But as you wish, this is now changed too.

I was thinking that you could document a few standard keywords in the same way:

- `algorithm`: choose between various implementation (with `None` meaning a sensible default, which could depend on installed optional packages).

- `proof`: is this is `True`, require a mathematically proven computation. With `False`, a probabilistic algorithm may be used.

- `check`: do some additional checks to verify the input parameters. This should not otherwise influence the functioning of the code (if code works with `check=True`, it should also work with `check=False`).

As a *separate* list, it would already make more sense to me. That wouldn't clutter the original "keywords to use" list.
