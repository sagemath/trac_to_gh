This patch will slightly modify instructions for docstrings.

I would like to have even more pre-specified formats for some classes of functions. For example should Boolean-valued `is_something()` function be "Return `True` if...", "Test whether" or something else? Also we have an arbitrary decision to use `algorithm=` instead of `implementation=`, `method=` etc.

But as a first part, what you think about these changes?

How about this "instead of" -formulation?

Sohehow "Use `algorithm` if there are several algorithms or backend programs to select from." sounds odd to me. It left me wondering what else I could use or what is the meaning of this sentence. Compare to "- - describes the function or method's effect as a command - - *not* as a description - -"

But as you wish, this is now changed too.

This is exactly what I hope to have in this list; and for example `inplace` should be added. But I still think that "Do not use"-list could be added; it will make this more explicit. An alternative for `inplace` with default `False` could be for example `return_copy` with default `True`, and that could be explained.

Has there been or suggested some other parameter name for `coerce`?

As a *separate* list, it would already make more sense to me. That wouldn't clutter the original "keywords to use" list.

Not that I know, at least `coerce` is used consistently for this. But I guess that `convert` would be a better name.

  This is a list of some keyword arguments that many functions and methods take.

  as explained here. Do not use a different keyword with the same meaning
