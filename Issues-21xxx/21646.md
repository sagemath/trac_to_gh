This patch will slightly modify instructions for docstrings.

I would like to have even more pre-specified formats for some classes of functions. For example should Boolean-valued `is_something()` function be "Return `True` if...", "Test whether" or something else? Also we have an arbitrary decision to use `algorithm=` instead of `implementation=`, `method=` etc.

But as a first part, what you think about these changes?

Sohehow "Use `algorithm` if there are several algorithms or backend programs to select from." sounds odd to me. It left me wondering what else I could use or what is the meaning of this sentence. Compare to "- - describes the function or method's effect as a command - - *not* as a description - -"

But as you wish, this is now changed too.

As a *separate* list, it would already make more sense to me. That wouldn't clutter the original "keywords to use" list.

Not that I know, at least `coerce` is used consistently for this. But I guess that `convert` would be a better name.

Here is a proposal: replace

```
* Function parameter names:
```
by

```
* Common function keyword arguments:

  This is a list of some keyword arguments that many functions and methods take.
  For consistency, you should use the keywords from the list below with the meaning
  as explained here. Do not use a different keyword with the same meaning
  (for example, do not use ``method``; use ``algorithm`` instead).
