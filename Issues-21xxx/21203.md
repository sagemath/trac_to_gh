Linear representation changed and some text added. For sure more could always be made...

Example added.

Yes, indeed. Naming is not that easy here. Everything with "base" seems to be no option was we have "k" that is called base as well. I now give "coefficient_ring" a try (also changed at at #21295), but I am very open to other, better suggestions.

Changed.

<a id='comment:38'></a>Thank you for your changes.

I have one question and another minor suggestion.

9. What was the motivation to remove "If not specified (`None`), then the integer ring is used." ?

10. I suggest to use `raise ... from None` where appropriate (e.g., the `OverflowError` caught in `_n_to_index_`) to avoid lengthy stack traces like

```
...
/local/cheuberg/local/sage-9.3.rc3/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/sage/combinat/words/word_char.pyx in sage.combinat.words.word_char.WordDatatype_char._set_data (build/cythonized/sage/combinat/words/word_char.c:3830)()
    110         for i in range(self._length):
--> 111             self._data[i] = data[i]
    112 

OverflowError: can't convert negative value to unsigned char

During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:

ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)

/local/cheuberg/local/sage-9.3.rc3/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/sage/combinat/k_regular_sequence.py in _n_to_index_(self, n)
    353             return W(n.digits(self.k))
    354         except OverflowError:
--> 355             raise ValueError('value {} of index is negative'.format(n))

ValueError: value -1 of index is negative
