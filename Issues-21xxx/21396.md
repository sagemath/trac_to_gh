I haven't looked in detail at this failure and where exactly the numerical difference is creeping in, but for now it should suffice to just add an `abstol` on the test.

The failure in `gamma_inc` is due to a slight difference in the value of `log(3)` which was discussed here: https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/3-rnq2QgWTQ/E2o6RZniAAAJ
