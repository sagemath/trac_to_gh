The following was broken in sage-7.2 (but works at least in sage-7.4.beta4)

```
sage: x = SR.var('x')
sage: L = LaurentPolynomialRing(ZZ)
sage: SR(L.one() * x)(x = 3)
x
```
Similarly, this was rather wrong

```
sage: parent(L.one() * x)
Univariate Laurent Polynomial Ring in x over Symbolic Ring
```

Original report: [this sage-support thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-support/VRHrBnbcBG4) for what to do.
