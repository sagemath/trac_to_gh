Do you have a script to test it? I mean, the total number of such graphs is known for small values of  n (cf. https://oeis.org/A007085) and so it's possible to run it many times and see whether you can get anywhere close to a uniform distribution.

By the way, there are few trailing spaces in the branch.

Hmm, this algorithm does not generate only 3-connected graphs.

It seems that the sequence of numbers is not in the OEIS:

```
sage: resu = {i: set() for i in range(1,6)}
sage: liste = []                           
....: for n in range(1,6):
....:     for k in range(6600):
....:         g = graphs.RandomBicubicPlanar(n)
....:         h = g.copy(immutable=True)
....:         resu[n].add(hash(h))
....:     liste.append(len(resu[n]))
sage: liste
[1, 3, 17, 103, 642]
```

Probably a better way to check would be to return also the root edge, so that the number of different possible outputs is given by Tutte's formula in A257.

Replying to [@fchapoton](#comment%3A9):
> Hmm, this algorithm does not generate only 3-connected graphs.

Right - but you could drop ones that are not 3-connected,
and also drop the marked (root) edge and count the results up to an isomorphism, and this would give you the OEIS sequence.

Asking the user to check the original article for this is a bit too much...

Here is at least a way to check that it generates
A000257: Number of rooted bicubic maps: a(n) = (8n-4)*a(n-1)/(n+2)

A procedure to faithfully encode the rooted map in a digraph:

```
def bicubic_dual_grand(g):
    G = DiGraph()
    for a, b, c in g.edges():
        ac = a + (c,)
        bc = b + (c,)
        G.add_edge((ac, bc))
        G.add_edge((bc, ac))
    for vert in g:
        if vert[0] == 'i':
            clef = (0, 1, 2)
        else:
            clef = (1, 0, 2)

        A, B, C = [vert + (c,) for c in clef]
        G.add_edge(A, B)
        G.add_edge(B, C)
        G.add_edge(C, A)

    op_root = [u for u in G.outgoing_edge_iterator(('n', -1, 0))
               if u[1][0] == 'i']
    G.delete_edge(op_root[0])
    return G
```
then

```
sage: resu = {i: set() for i in range(1,6)}
sage: liste = []                           
....: for n in range(1,6):
....:     for k in range(400*n):
....:         g = bicubic_dual_grand(graphs.RandomBicubicPlanar(n)).canonical_label()
....:         h = g.copy(immutable=True)
....:         resu[n].add(h)
....:     liste.append(len(resu[n]))
sage: liste
```
Checking uniformity should be doable similarly.

I don't always get all the graphs; in some runs for n=6 I get one graph less, and for n=7 I got only 1230 (instead of 1584, according to [OEIS](https://oeis.org/A000257)).
Here is one more run of your script in the range [1..8]:

```
sage: liste
[1, 3, 12, 56, 288, 1242, 2418]
```

I did not check, perhaps the non-uniformity is not in your branch, but somewhere else...

Increasing bound to 4000*n gives

```
[1, 3, 12, 56, 288, 1584, 8710]
```

OK, this looks reasonable. If there is anything regarding the distribution in the text you refer to, please add it to the docs. Otherwise it's good to go.

Thanks for your help.

As I have already explained in the doc, the distribution is uniform.
