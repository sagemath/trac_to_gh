<a id='comment:9'></a>Hmm, this algorithm does not generate only 3-connected graphs.

It seems that the sequence of numbers is not in the OEIS:

```
sage: resu = {i: set() for i in range(1,6)}
sage: liste = []                           
....: for n in range(1,6):
....:     for k in range(6600):
....:         g = graphs.RandomBicubicPlanar(n)
....:         h = g.copy(immutable=True)
....:         resu[n].add(hash(h))
....:     liste.append(len(resu[n]))
sage: liste
[1, 3, 17, 103, 642]
```

Probably a better way to check would be to return also the root edge, so that the number of different possible outputs is given by Tutte's formula in A257.

Right - but you could drop ones that are not 3-connected,
and also drop the marked (root) edge and count the results up to an isomorphism, and this would give you the OEIS sequence.

Increasing bound to 4000*n gives

```
[1, 3, 12, 56, 288, 1584, 8710]

OK, this looks reasonable. If there is anything regarding the distribution in the text you refer to, please add it to the docs. Otherwise it's good to go.
