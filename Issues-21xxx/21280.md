class N(object):
    
    @cached_method
    def blub(self):
        print('called P.blub')
        return 3

    @cached_method
    def noblub(self):
        print('called P.noblub')
        return None
    
n = N()
print n.blub()
print n.blub()
print '---'
print n.noblub()
print n.noblub()
```
results in

```
called P.blub
3
3
---
called P.noblub
None
called P.noblub
None
```
which demonstrates that a return value `None` is **not** cached.

This is also in contrast to

```
@cached_function
def c():
    print('called c')
    return None

print c()
print c()
```
which results in

```
called c
None
None
```
i.e., it works with `cached_function`
