General, dense, univariate Skew Polynomials and SkewPolynomial Rings over generic commutative base rings are already supported in Ticket #13215. This ticket proposes adding functionality for additional methods and optimized algorithms for such Skew Polynomials specifically over Finite Fields. This includes:
1. Class SkewPolynomial_finite_field(SkewPolynomial_generic_dense)
2. Class SkewPolynomialRing_finite_field(SkewPolynomialRing_general)

Note: There are a number of additional functionalities such as a class for Karatsuba multiplication in finite fields, center of skew polynomial ring, factorization and irreducibility that were written in the original #13215. Those will be added in separate tickets. 

Depends on #13215

I've added the relevant classes and methods fixed all doctest errors that remained, added missing documentation and tests, and cleaned up the code. I am facing a couple of tiny issues with the minimum subspace polynomial (MSP), multi-point evaluation (MPE) and interpolation methods. I think I should have them ready in a short while. 
Please let me know what else I can add to this ticket. If there isn't anything, then I'll open the ticket for review once I add MSP, MPE and interpolation.

I've been thinking about whether the functions minimum_subspace_polynomial, multi_point_evaluation and interpolation_polynomial make any sense for general skew polynomial rings. I politely doubt that you were really considering this when you put the functions in SkewPolynomial_general (since the current implementation not at all works for general skew polynomial rings). But it turns out they *do* make sense and the algorithms more-or-less immediately works. So I suggest those three functions should be in their own tickets.

- It seems minimum_subspace_polynomial *does* make sense in general, but it should be called something different and the implementation should be fixed. Firstly, the name and your current implementation is a verbose translation from linearized polynomials. This obviously leads to confusion and incorrect behaviour for even skew polynomials over finite fields with twist map the frobenius (for instance, in linearized polynomials `x<sup>(q</sup>i)` translates to `x^i` in skew polynomials).

    My suggestion is to call the function `minimal_vanishing_polynomial`. Given elements a1,...,an, it is defined as the (unique) minimal-degree polynomial p
  such that p is monic (leading coefficient is 1) and p(ai) = 0 for i=1,...,n.

- The implementation of course also needs to be slightly modified:

      - Given an empty list of points, return 1.

      - Given a singleton point a, return x - sigma(a)/a.   (use pen-and-paper to see that I am right)

      - Given a list of points, use divide and conquer as you do now.

- Then multi_point_evaluation also makes sense, and it's implementation is close to what you have now: as I've mentioned before, you should use sigma instead of q-powering everywhere. While were on it, you write "pow(a, pow(q, 0))" several places, but this is clearly just "a"!

- `x = self([0,1])` should be `x = self._parent.gen()`.

- Instead of lines such as

      ```
            y = []
            y.append(bla-bla) 
            return y
      ```

      you should write 

      ```
            return [ bla-bla ]
      ```

- In multi_point_evaluation you have a duplicate line `r = ....` with `return ...`. Worse, that line is incorrect: you shouldn't convert to sets, then union, then convert back to a list (you lose ordering of evaluations, and the user *wants* to know that e.g. multiple input evaluates to, say, 1). Just concatenate the two lists: `self.multi_point_evaluation(R_A, A) + self.multi_point_evaluation(R_B, B)`.

- minimum_subspace_polynomial and multi_point_evaluation are mutually recursive and will generate the same minimum subspace polynomials an exponential number of times right now. We need to add caching: add `@cached_method` to minimum_subspace_polynomial.

- multi_point_evaluation is a fairly complicated procedure compared to just calling `n` times `__call__`. Try to do timings to see if it is worth it. (Asymptotically, there is only a gain if some fast multiplication and `quo_rem` of skew polynomials is implemented, which it isn't).

- With minimum_subspace_polynomial and multi_point_evaluation then interpolation_polynomial also makes sense for general skew polynomials. The implementation you wrote immediately works, except that you again should replace `pow(x, (pow(q,0)` with `self._parent.one()`, and `x = self([0,1])` with `x = self._parent.gen()`.

- Note that all three functions are easily tested: for the minimum_subspace_polynomial, just check the degree of the output and that it evaluates to zero on all the input poins. For multi_point_evaluation, just check that the evaluations match using single `__call__`'s. For interpolation_polynomial just check that the degree is less than the number of points, and that the output evaluates correctly at all input. Be sure to test your functions on skew polynomials over finite fields, both with sigma being the Frobenius or a power of Frobenius, and also on skew polynomials over another ring.

The point of the specialised implementations over finite fields is to have improved performance. Do you have timing results to demonstrate that each arithmetic operation is now faster than with the generic implementation?

Hello,

I have some more comments:

- Is there any reason why `cdef` methods in `skew_polynomial_finite_field.pyx` are not doctested?
- In the same module, a lot of methods do not respect documentation conventions. See `cdef SkewPolynomial_finite_field_dense _rgcd` for instance, whose documentation is this single sentence: `Fast right gcd.`. Some methods (e.g. `_rightpow_`, `_leftpow`) do not even have this `Return(s) blah blah` line which explains what they're supposed to do...
- `skew_polynomial_finite_field.pyx`'s title is `This module implements skew polynomials over finite fields.`. I think it should be changed to `Skew polynomials over finite fields`, or something equivalent.
- A lot of elements are not properly formatted in docstrings of `skew_polynomial_finite_field.pyx`: it should be `<double backtick>self<double backtick>` instead of `self`, etc.
- In `class SkewPolynomialRing_finite_field`, docstring of `twist_map` is not helpful as it says `Return the twist map`.

If the singleton point is 0, I simply return x and otherwise x - sigma(a)/a as you pointed out, right?

um.. you mean self.gen(), right? Because self._parent.gen() would give an error.

I don't think these should be accessible from the command line. They should be called behind-the-scene when you use `SkewPolynomialRing(R)` and `R` is a finite field.

Yes, at that point I hadn't realised that all the functions apply to general skew polynomial rings.

> That meant these had to either go in the general or finite field ring classes. I looked up some papers and found that the theory for polynomial interpolation of skew polynomial rings exists, although I didn't really try and study any of that.

I don't know what to reply to that. If you don't *know*, then 1) try to figure it out, using math; and if you fail at that 2) ask (and we will try to do step 1 ourselves). By now you should be well-enough versed in the basics of skew polynomials that you at least shouldn't try to put q-powers everywhere. I would have expected you just to put the functions it in the finite field-class since that is the only case that you studied. If you thought it might apply generally, you should prove it and/or discuss with us.

Your "mistake" of course lead me to reflect upon it, which turned out for the better, but still.

> Just to confirm again, should I create a new ticket and place them there?

Yes please, as they do not pertain specifically to finite fields.

> > - Given a singleton point a, return x - sigma(a)/a.   (use pen-and-paper to see that I am right)

> If the singleton point is 0, I simply return x and otherwise x - sigma(a)/a as you pointed out, right?

0 is not a valid input. 0 does not span a vector space (well, it spans a vector space of dimension 0), and *any* skew polynomial evaluates to 0 on 0.

> > - `x = self([0,1])` should be `x = self._parent.gen()`.

Yes I meant `self.gen()`.

OK.

And the lines in the `skew_polynomial_ring_constructor.py` file. Not command line. My apologies.

Here are some mathematical comments:
- I would say (but I'm not sure) that the benefit of using a divide-and-conquer method for multi-point evaluation only appears if you are using fast multication algorithms
- the problem of "minimum subspace polynomial" reduces to the computation of some lcm: the minimum subspace polynomial of a family (a_1, ..., a_n) (with a_i nonzero for all i) is the left lcm of the degree 1 skew polynomials (X - sigma(a_i)/a_i). Again I think that computing it using a divide-and-conquer method is only interesting when fast multiplication and half-gcd are available (but these should be hidden at some point in Wachter-Zeh algorithm)
- the interpolation problem is just a noncommutative CRT: finding P such that P(a_i)=b_i is equivalent to finding a skew polynomial P which is congruent to b_i modulo (X - sigma(a_i)/a_i). I think that it would be interesting in any case to implement a method `CRT` (and then possibly let `interpolation` call it, but of course it is not mandatory).

Otherwise, documentation is updated. Code is scrubbed and cleaned. Remaining tests pass and these classes and modules are called upon when the the base ring is a finite field.

@xcaruso I believe what you want is `cpdef`.

In any case, timing tests should be performed before any code modifications.

I made a try. I added this method

```
cpdef test_quo_rem(self,other):
    if not isinstance(other,SkewPolynomial_generic_dense):
        raise TypeError
    cdef SkewPolynomial_finite_field_dense R = self.parent()(list(self))
    Q = R._rquo_inplace_rem(other)
    return (Q,R)
```

and compare timings:

```
sage: k = GF(5^3)
sage: S.<x> = SkewPolynomialRing(k,k.frobenius_endomorphism())
sage: A = S.random_element(degree=1000)
sage: B = S.random_element(degree=500,monic=True)
sage: %timeit A.right_quo_rem(B)
1 loop, best of 3: 610 ms per loop
sage: %timeit A.test_quo_rem(B)
1 loop, best of 3: 642 ms per loop
```

So, the difference is not sensible.
