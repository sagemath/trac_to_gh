General, dense, univariate Skew Polynomials and SkewPolynomial Rings over generic commutative base rings are already supported in Ticket #13215. This ticket proposes adding functionality for additional methods and optimized algorithms for such Skew Polynomials specifically over Finite Fields. This includes:
1. Class SkewPolynomial_finite_field(SkewPolynomial_generic_dense)
2. Class SkewPolynomialRing_finite_field(SkewPolynomialRing_general)

Note: There are a number of additional functionalities such as a class for Karatsuba multiplication in finite fields, center of skew polynomial ring, factorization and irreducibility that were written in the original #13215. Those will be added in separate tickets.

<a id='comment:4'></a>I've been thinking about whether the functions minimum_subspace_polynomial, multi_point_evaluation and interpolation_polynomial make any sense for general skew polynomial rings. I politely doubt that you were really considering this when you put the functions in SkewPolynomial_general (since the current implementation not at all works for general skew polynomial rings). But it turns out they *do* make sense and the algorithms more-or-less immediately works. So I suggest those three functions should be in their own tickets.

- It seems minimum_subspace_polynomial *does* make sense in general, but it should be called something different and the implementation should be fixed. Firstly, the name and your current implementation is a verbose translation from linearized polynomials. This obviously leads to confusion and incorrect behaviour for even skew polynomials over finite fields with twist map the frobenius (for instance, in linearized polynomials `x<sup>(q</sup>i)` translates to `x^i` in skew polynomials).

    My suggestion is to call the function `minimal_vanishing_polynomial`. Given elements a1,...,an, it is defined as the (unique) minimal-degree polynomial p
  such that p is monic (leading coefficient is 1) and p(ai) = 0 for i=1,...,n.

- The implementation of course also needs to be slightly modified:

      - Given an empty list of points, return 1.

      - Given a singleton point a, return x - sigma(a)/a.   (use pen-and-paper to see that I am right)

      - Given a list of points, use divide and conquer as you do now.

- Then multi_point_evaluation also makes sense, and it's implementation is close to what you have now: as I've mentioned before, you should use sigma instead of q-powering everywhere. While were on it, you write "pow(a, pow(q, 0))" several places, but this is clearly just "a"!

- `x = self([0,1])` should be `x = self._parent.gen()`.

- Instead of lines such as

      {{{
            y = []
            y.append(bla-bla) 
            return y
      }}}

      you should write 

      {{{
            return [ bla-bla ]
      }}}

- In multi_point_evaluation you have a duplicate line `r = ....` with `return ...`. Worse, that line is incorrect: you shouldn't convert to sets, then union, then convert back to a list (you lose ordering of evaluations, and the user *wants* to know that e.g. multiple input evaluates to, say, 1). Just concatenate the two lists: `self.multi_point_evaluation(R_A, A) + self.multi_point_evaluation(R_B, B)`.

- minimum_subspace_polynomial and multi_point_evaluation are mutually recursive and will generate the same minimum subspace polynomials an exponential number of times right now. We need to add caching: add ``@`cached_method` to minimum_subspace_polynomial.

- multi_point_evaluation is a fairly complicated procedure compared to just calling `n` times `__call__`. Try to do timings to see if it is worth it. (Asymptotically, there is only a gain if some fast multiplication and `quo_rem` of skew polynomials is implemented, which it isn't).

The implementation you wrote immediately works, except that you again should replace `pow(x, (pow(q,0)` with `self._parent.one()`, and `x = self([0,1])` with `x = self._parent.gen()`.

<a id='comment:6'></a>Hello,

I have some more comments:

- Is there any reason why `cdef` methods in `skew_polynomial_finite_field.pyx` are not doctested?
- In the same module, a lot of methods do not respect documentation conventions. See `cdef SkewPolynomial_finite_field_dense _rgcd` for instance, whose documentation is this single sentence: `Fast right gcd.`. Some methods (e.g. `_rightpow_`, `_leftpow`) do not even have this `Return(s) blah blah` line which explains what they're supposed to do...
- `skew_polynomial_finite_field.pyx`'s title is `This module implements skew polynomials over finite fields.`. I think it should be changed to `Skew polynomials over finite fields`, or something equivalent.
- A lot of elements are not properly formatted in docstrings of `skew_polynomial_finite_field.pyx`: it should be `<double backtick>self<double backtick>` instead of `self`, etc.
- In `class SkewPolynomialRing_finite_field`, docstring of `twist_map` is not helpful as it says `Return the twist map`.

Based on the discussions before, the plan was to add these in the finite fields ticket. That meant these had to either go in the general or finite field ring classes. I looked up some papers and found that the theory for polynomial interpolation of skew polynomial rings exists, although I didn't really try and study any of that. I just went kinda assumed that the algorithms by Wachter-Zeh would be valid and placed it there.
Just to confirm again, should I create a new ticket and place them there?

If the singleton point is 0, I simply return x and otherwise x - sigma(a)/a as you pointed out, right?

> - `x = self([0,1])` should be `x = self._parent.gen()`.
 
um.. you mean self.gen(), right? Because self._parent.gen() would give an error.

> - minimum_subspace_polynomial and multi_point_evaluation are mutually recursive and will generate the same minimum subspace polynomials an exponential number of times right now. We need to add caching: add ``@`cached_method` to minimum_subspace_polynomial.
 
Done. And I'll report back with some timing results once I test that these are working properly.

I don't think these should be accessible from the command line. They should be called behind-the-scene when you use `SkewPolynomialRing(R)` and `R` is a finite field.

> I've fixed the documentation for the latter class. I removed MPE, MVP, Interpolation, _leftpow_, _rightpow_ methods. The first three I am adding as a new ticket in a short while. The last two because they depend on "center"-related stuff and that comes in a later ticket.


OK.

Yes, at that point I hadn't realised that all the functions apply to general skew polynomial rings.

> That meant these had to either go in the general or finite field ring classes. I looked up some papers and found that the theory for polynomial interpolation of skew polynomial rings exists, although I didn't really try and study any of that.

I don't know what to reply to that. If you don't *know*, then 1) try to figure it out, using math; and if you fail at that 2) ask (and we will try to do step 1 ourselves). By now you should be well-enough versed in the basics of skew polynomials that you at least shouldn't try to put q-powers everywhere. I would have expected you just to put the functions it in the finite field-class since that is the only case that you studied. If you thought it might apply generally, you should prove it and/or discuss with us.

Your "mistake" of course lead me to reflect upon it, which turned out for the better, but still.

> Just to confirm again, should I create a new ticket and place them there?


Yes please, as they do not pertain specifically to finite fields.

> >       - Given a singleton point a, return x - sigma(a)/a.   (use pen-and-paper to see that I am right)
 
> If the singleton point is 0, I simply return x and otherwise x - sigma(a)/a as you pointed out, right?

0 is not a valid input. 0 does not span a vector space (well, it spans a vector space of dimension 0), and *any* skew polynomial evaluates to 0 on 0.

> > - `x = self([0,1])` should be `x = self._parent.gen()`.
 
> um.. you mean self.gen(), right? Because self._parent.gen() would give an error.

Yes I meant `self.gen()`.

> Done. And I'll report back with some timing results once I test that these are working properly.


OK.

<a id='comment:29'></a>You would need to make a copy of `self`. Just creating another reference to `self` doesn't cause `self` to not be changed by `_inplace_rrem`. All that snippet does is what `cpdef` would do (plus create the extra temp reference).

However, you are correct in that `cdef` methods are faster (they are at the C level instead of the python level).

```
cpdef test_quo_rem(self,other):
    if not isinstance(other,SkewPolynomial_generic_dense):
        raise TypeError
    cdef SkewPolynomial_finite_field_dense R = self.parent()(list(self))
    Q = R._rquo_inplace_rem(other)

and compare timings:

```
sage: k = GF(5^3)
sage: S.<x> = SkewPolynomialRing(k,k.frobenius_endomorphism())
sage: A = S.random_element(degree=1000)
sage: B = S.random_element(degree=500,monic=True)
sage: %timeit A.right_quo_rem(B)
1 loop, best of 3: 610 ms per loop
sage: %timeit A.test_quo_rem(B)
1 loop, best of 3: 642 ms per loop
```

So, the difference is not sensible.
