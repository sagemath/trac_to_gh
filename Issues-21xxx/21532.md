./configure should not create the directory hierarchy under SAGE_LOCAL.

Normally this is the task of `make install`; but since our `make` already does the equivalent of "make install" (see #21479 and #21495 for discussion), we should do this during `make`.

. . . 

A possible implementation would be to use the currently unused automake-generated `build/make/Makefile-auto` to do that by calling `make -f Makefile-auto install` during `make`.
