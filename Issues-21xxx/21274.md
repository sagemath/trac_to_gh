```
As a followup to #21232 these automatic simplifications should be added:

```
sage: frac(frac(x))
frac(x)
sage: frac(floor(x))  # ceil
0
sage: assume(x, 'integer')
sage: frac(x)
0
sage: assume(x > 0)
sage: frac(tanh(x))
tanh(x)
```

A very micro optimization:

```
sage: %timeit ZZ.zero()
The slowest run took 46.49 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
10000000 loops, best of 3: 61.5 ns per loop
sage: %timeit 0    # Preparsed as Integer(0) with the 0 being a python int
The slowest run took 40.29 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
10000000 loops, best of 3: 71 ns per loop
sage: z = int(0)
sage: %timeit Integer(z)
The slowest run took 53.93 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
10000000 loops, best of 3: 75.2 ns per loop
