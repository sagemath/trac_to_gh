#21539 added support for `make V=0` to silence the build.
This helps, for example, with Travis CI builds, which have a limit on the allowed output.

However, with some long-running spkg builds (such as gcc) it could be nice to have some indication of progress (for example, with a Travis CI build, to avoid the 10-minute-no-output kill).

This could be done by calling something like pv (the Pipe Viewer) in `sage-logger`. We can implement what we need in a few lines of basic Python, no need to add a pv dependency (note, for example, the Ubuntu pv package is not whitelisted for Travis CI container-based builds).

The opportunities for bikeshedding are endless on this one. I have a first implementation that just reads lines from stdin and discards them and checks the elapsed time; prints a 'still here' message to stderr every 5 minutes. (Good enough for a Travis CI build.) But could add: 
- an optional prefix such as `[gcc-4.3.4]`
- progress indication, measured by output number of lines divided by expected number of lines
- watching for regex that indicate progress milestones (e.g., `Comparing stages 2 and 3`)

This seems to be combining several things....  Since when are we trying to build Sage on Travis?

Yes, it's combining it with some experimental Travis build scripts, because this was my main use case for the progress meter. The ticket is not ready for review.
