Followup on #20690:

The symbolic link `src/doc/common/themes/sage/static/thebe.js` points to `../../../../../../local/share/thebe/thebe.js` which is in the Sage **installation** directory `$SAGE_LOCAL`. Having such a symlink from the source to the installation directory really makes no sense and goes against the goal of making Sage more modular.

I don't have a good suggestion for what to do with thebe.js.  It's a
general problem: we are lacking a clean solution for managing the
javascript packages Sage depends on. Reverting to the first
implementation of #20690 (including thebe.js directly in Sage's lib)
is indeed on the ugly side. But this is a simple solution that seems
to actually ease the life of our packagers for now, and we are already
doing that for mathjax.

What are we doing for mathjax? I cannot really find how we make mathjax work, but it's certainly *not* the same way as we do with `thebe.js`.

This is not true, mathjax is installed separately for a while now (it used to be bundled with sagenb, and was made a spkg to avoid duplication since jupyter also depends on mathjax).

For sagenb, it also uses symlink, the only difference is that the symlink is installed during sagenb's `spkg-install` (in particular, both sides of the symlink belong to the `SAGE_LOCAL` directory, which i guess is why no downstream packager complained). As i told in the previous ticket, there is no docbuild pkg where to install the symlink, but we can try to set is somewhere in the docbuild script, so that both sides of the symlink are done within the `SAGE_LOCAL` directory.

The use of symlink at install time used to be the case for jupyter as well, but it seems not to be the case anymore, so perhaps we could try to mimic the jupyter way (i have no idea how mathjax and jupyter are currently linked).

Sounds good - could you prepare a patch for that? 
If no better place can be found, I suppose it would even be OK to make the symlink in one of the doc-related targets of `build/make/deps`.
