Previous description was (now implemented):

I noticed that the derivative of the gegenbauer polynomial wrt x was not implemented, so I wrote a patch for it.

I used the formula C'(n,a,x) = 2*a*C(n-1,a+1,x)

With the patch applied I get, for example:


```
sage: var('a');
sage: derivative(gegenbauer(2,a,x),x)
4*(a + 1)*a*x

```


Depends on #21645

I'll both implement in Pynac directly. See also #21644.

Thanks for adding the derivative wrt m, I wasn't aware of this identity (where did you get it?).

Btw, what is the guiding principle to decide if things should go into pynac or pure sage?

I was under the impression that 'performance' was the primary factor to move things to pynac. Is this the case here?

Adding the derivative functions to Pynac only complicates the situation here as we lose a unified handling of the derivatives within the Python file, like in this case with 'hermite' needing a fix in Pynac and gen_laguerre in Sage. I don't think this adds to 'clarity'.

So I disagree with moving the derivative of gegenbauer to Pynac, as it is not performance motivated and could be easily done in Sage.
