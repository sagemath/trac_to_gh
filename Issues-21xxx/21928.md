<a id='comment:9'></a>Thanks for proposing a fix to this issue. I just downloaded the branch. It works great.

Here are two relatively small comments that I would suggest to change before positive review:

1. I think the `nterms=10` would be better put as an argument with a default value of 10 for the `_latex_` method like it is done for the method `str` of the same object. The first thing that will happen is that somebody want to see 13 terms (with the ...). I know that `_latex_` method is used from `latex` function which might not forward arguments `*args, **kwds`. Something more complicated involving a new method could be done like [here](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/master/src/sage/combinat/words/morphism.py#L813) but I do not think it is necessary. To my opinion, I would just move `nterms=10` to the argument which will allow somebody to see 13 terms (with the ...).

2. The two output  lines in doctests are very long. I suggest to wrap them to keep less than 80 characters on each line. The doctest framework won't notice the newlines. Alternatively, the code could include well placed `\n` so that `\frac{\displaystyle` are all well aligned vertically.
