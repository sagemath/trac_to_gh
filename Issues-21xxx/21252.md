This patch is based on recent results of "Nonlinear Invariants Attack" by Todo, Leander, and Sasaki in http://eprint.iacr.org/2016/732.pdf. For an mxm S-Box S, the attack requires to find m-variables Boolean functions g such that g(x) + g(S(x)) is a constant function. The implementation of this patch is based on the method proposed by authors in Section 3.1 of http://eprint.iacr.org/2016/732.pdf.

Hi,

my two cents:
* you can't rely on the ordering of a `set` for a doctest.
* this can be made more efficient with something like that:

```sage
def nonlinear_invariants(self):
    m = self.m
    F2 = GF(2)
    one = F2.one()
    zero = F2.zero()
    R = BooleanPolynomialRing(m, 'x')
    def to_bits(i):
        return tuple(ZZ(i).digits(base=2, padto=m))
    def poly_from_coeffs(c):
        return R({to_bits(j): one for j,ci in enumerate(c) if ci})
    L = [[zero if ((v & w) == w) == ((sv & w) == w) else one
          for w in range(1<<m)]
         for v,sv in enumerate(self._S)]
    M = Matrix(F2, L)
    T0 = {poly_from_coeffs(Ai) for Ai in M.right_kernel()}
    M[:,0] = one
    T1 = {poly_from_coeffs(Ai) for Ai in M.right_kernel()}
    return tuple(T0 | T1)
```
(I'm to lazy to push a real commit...)

Some comments/suggestions.

1. Wouldn't it make more sense to return truth tables (i.e. crypto.BooleanFunction instances)? The ANF can be obtained by calling the respective method.

2. Instead of doing the linear algebra, we can look at the cycle structure (or, in general, the functional graph). This should be more efficient.

3. Since invariants form a vector space, it may make sense to return a basis, instead of generating all functions (argument option?). Or better, can we make a VectorSpace of BooleanFunctions in Sage? Then it would effectively be a basis and have a straightforward iteration overall all linear combinations.

4. Would be nice to have an option to get invariants g(S(x)) = g(x) separately from those with g(S(x)) = g(x) + 1.

It's nice to see that this functionality is being added.

Having an implementation of suggestion 2 by gh-hellman would be very nice. Maybe this could be a feature to be added in a later version.

That said, I think suggestion 3 above (returning a vector space object rather than all elements individually) is pretty important. Aside from the fact that a VectorSpace is more convenient if you want to find common invariants for several functions, it also helps to avoid potential unpleasant surprises since returning the set of all invariants can sometimes result in very long lists. For example, for the n-bit identity permutation the result will be a list of length `2**(2**n)`.

If it's not possible/easy to construct subspaces of a BooleanPolynomialRing in sage, I would suggest to return a subspace of `VectorSpace(GF(2), 2**n)` instead (basically the truth tables as proposed by gh-hellman in suggestion 1).
