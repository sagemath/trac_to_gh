Hi,

my two cents:
* you can't rely on the ordering of a `set` for a doctest.
* this can be made more efficient with something like that:

```sage
def nonlinear_invariants(self):
    m = self.m
    F2 = GF(2)
    one = F2.one()
    zero = F2.zero()
    R = BooleanPolynomialRing(m, 'x')
    def to_bits(i):
        return tuple(ZZ(i).digits(base=2, padto=m))
    def poly_from_coeffs(c):
        return R({to_bits(j): one for j,ci in enumerate(c) if ci})
    L = [[zero if ((v & w) == w) == ((sv & w) == w) else one
          for w in range(1<<m)]
         for v,sv in enumerate(self._S)]
    M = Matrix(F2, L)
    T0 = {poly_from_coeffs(Ai) for Ai in M.right_kernel()}
    M[:,0] = one
    T1 = {poly_from_coeffs(Ai) for Ai in M.right_kernel()}
    return tuple(T0 | T1)
```
(I'm to lazy to push a real commit...)

Some comments/suggestions.

1. Wouldn't it make more sense to return truth tables (i.e. crypto.BooleanFunction instances)? The ANF can be obtained by calling the respective method.

2. Instead of doing the linear algebra, we can look at the cycle structure (or, in general, the functional graph). This should be more efficient.

3. Since invariants form a vector space, it may make sense to return a basis, instead of generating all functions (argument option?). Or better, can we make a VectorSpace of BooleanFunctions in Sage? Then it would effectively be a basis and have a straightforward iteration overall all linear combinations.

4. Would be nice to have an option to get invariants g(S(x)) = g(x) separately from those with g(S(x)) = g(x) + 1.
