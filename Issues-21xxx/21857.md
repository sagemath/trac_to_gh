```
sage: V = PolynomialRing(QQ, 'c')
sage: M = PolynomialRing(QQ, 'c, d')
sage: N = PolynomialRing(M, 'a, b')
sage: V(N(M.0))
```
raises

```
TypeError: unable to convert 'c' to a rational
```
The above should work, as `M.0` is clearly a polynomial in `c`.

The same goes wrong with `LaurentPolynomialRing`
