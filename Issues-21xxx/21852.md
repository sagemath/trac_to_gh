When the valuation is non-trivial, we were not always performing the required number of p-adic lifting iterations.

<a id='comment:6'></a>The following

```
log(e - val//2)/log(2)
```
can easily be deduced from the number of digits of `e - val//2`. This would better be computed with

```
(e - val//2 - 1).nbits()
```

Concerning speed

```
sage: %timeit ceil(log(2**5)/log(2))
1 loop, best of 3: 36.9 ms per loop
sage: %timeit (2**5 - 1).nbits()
1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.19 Âµs per loop
```
