It seems to be an issue with `WordDatatype_char.__richcmp__` in that if the `cmp` is non-zero, it needs to include 3 (which is `!=`):

```diff
         cdef int test = (<WordDatatype_char> self)._lexico_cmp(other)
         if test < 0:
             return op < 2 or op == 3
         elif test > 0:
-           return op > 3
+           return op >= 3
         else:
             return op == 1 or op == 2 or op == 5
```

Looking at the fix suggested by Travis, I believe the problem is not the variable but what is on the left side vs right side: `A != B` versus `B != A`.

I guess the problem comes from the recent upgrade of cmp to richcmp for Python 3 support done in #21435.

Hmmm, looking at this further. I do not think this bug was included by #21435. It seems to come from the original implementation of `WordDatatype_char`.

I can confirm this using [sagecell](https://sagecell.sagemath.org/) which runs 7.3:

```
shape1 = Word([1,2], alphabet=[1,2])
shape2 = Word([1,1], alphabet=[1,2])
print shape1 == shape2, "should be False"
print shape2 == shape1, "should be False"
print shape1 != shape2, "should be True"
print shape2 != shape1, "should be True"
print shape2 == shape2, "should be True"
print shape2 != shape2, "should be False"
print version()
```

returns

```
False should be False
False should be False
False should be True
True should be True
True should be True
False should be False
SageMath version 7.3, Release Date: 2016-08-04
```

Yes, I agree.
But, a little bit less efficient if op == 5 when test >0 for instance...

I must leave now to take a train, I won't have acces to internet until monday.
