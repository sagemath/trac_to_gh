```diff

         if test < 0:
             return op < 2 or op == 3

         else:

<a id='comment:6'></a>Hmmm, looking at this further. I do not think this bug was included by #21435. It seems to come from the original implementation of `WordDatatype_char`.

I can confirm this using [sagecell](https://sagecell.sagemath.org/) which runs 7.3:

```
shape1 = Word([1,2], alphabet=[1,2])
shape2 = Word([1,1], alphabet=[1,2])
print shape1 == shape2, "should be False"
print shape2 == shape1, "should be False"
print shape1 != shape2, "should be True"
print shape2 != shape1, "should be True"
print shape2 == shape2, "should be True"
print shape2 != shape2, "should be False"
print version()
```

returns

```
False should be False
False should be False
False should be True
True should be True
True should be True
False should be False
SageMath version 7.3, Release Date: 2016-08-04
```
