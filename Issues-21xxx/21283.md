Multivariate polynomials exhibit this behavior:

```
sage: T.<a,b> = PolynomialRing(QQ, 2)
sage: (~a).parent()
Fraction Field of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in a, b over Rational Field
```
But multivariate power series don't (and should):

```
sage: R.<x,y> = PowerSeriesRing(QQ, 2)
sage: (~x).parent()
...
NotImplementedError: Multiplicative inverse of multivariate power series currently implemented only if constant coefficient is a unit.
```
This is the primary issue holding up resolution of the mostly unrelated issue #8972.

Keywords: **multivariate series, fraction field**
