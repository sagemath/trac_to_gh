Hi ralf,
in your branch the package-version.txt is pynac 0.7.0.
So is there another branch with 0.7.1, or where can I download it?

Frédéric, thanks for the interest. Sorry, I was a bit fast. I will change the dependency to the pynac-0.7.1 upgrade ticket when that version is released. It is possible to test pynac git master now but there are more steps involved (see https://github.com/pynac/pynac/wiki/Setting-up-a-development-environment) so I don't expect anyone to do this now.
