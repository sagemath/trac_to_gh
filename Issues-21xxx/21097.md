<a id='comment:6'></a>In the cases of dynatomic_polynomial([0,0]) and dynatomic_polynomial(0), it returns the number 0.  Should always return a polynomial, so should be the zero polynomial.

In documentation: We have

```
R.<x,y> = PolynomialRing(QQ)
S = R.quo(R.ideal(y^2-x+1))
P.<u,v> = ProjectiveSpace(FractionField(S),1)
H = End(P)
f = H([u^2 + S(x^2)*v^2, v^2])
f.dynatomic_polynomial([1,1])
```

In this case, 

```
f.dynatomic_polynomial([1,1]).parent()
```
also returns Symbolic Ring.

Might be good to move all of the "Symbolic Ring" examples to the end. A  little confusing as currently formatted.
