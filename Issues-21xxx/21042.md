Attempting the contour plot

```
var('x y')
contour_plot(0, (x,-1,1), (y,-1,1))
```

does not show a plot and fails with the error

```
/home/sc_serv/sage/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/repl/rich_output/display_manager.py:590: RichReprWarning: Exception in _rich_repr_ while displaying object: zero-size array to reduction operation minimum which has no identity
  RichReprWarning,

```

Contour plots of nonzero values display as expected. It was reported on [this ask question](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/34111/unable-to-create-a-contour_plot-of-a-system-of-inequalities/).

It's not just the zero function, something else weird is going on here. This produces the line `x=y` like you'd expect:

```
contour_plot(x-y, (0,1), (0,1), contours=[0], fill=False)
```

But then this produces... nothing:

```
contour_plot(abs(x-y), (0,1), (0,1), contours=[0], fill=False)
```

Even though it should be the same plot. Which is weird, but not as weird as being able to fix it with...

```
contour_plot(abs(x-y)-0.000001, (0,1), (0,1), contours=[0], fill=False)
```

which gives you (roughly) the plot of `x=y` again.

I think contour plot and implicit plot work by detecting
sign changes to know where something vanishes.

So no surprise they don't work well with absolute values
and squares of some quantities even though those have
the same vanishing loci.

This heuristic is real hacky, but it can only improve things; and the important part is that we now warn the user anyway.
