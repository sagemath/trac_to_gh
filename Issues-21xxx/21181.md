Also in `bispecial_*`.  (Hard to see with two backticks above, especially when the editor in addition wraps long lines in case the window is too narrow... 8-/ )

I have tried to recreate a branch (by hand!)

u/chapoton/poor_branch_21181

but it may be bad, missing some commits.

It would be better if leif had a copy of his own branch, and could make a new branch from the commit bb7d7aeff37e6077f8270c854a50b34ffb3d9bdc

Sorry for all the trouble. I make a forced push on public/21178, having forgotten that this branch was used in 21181 (which is rather bad practice and done after my own advice !)
