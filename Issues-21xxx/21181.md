In `schuetzenberger_involution`, it looks like the `INPUT:` block was one space too few (and then your changes to the bullet points). Also, in `*_special_factors`, we should make the bullet points the correct indentation:

```
- this is a long sentence that goes on but
  should be aligned with the first letter
