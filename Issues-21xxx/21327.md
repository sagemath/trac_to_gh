Linbox has a sage interface, exploited by sage's linbox interface. This unpleasant situation (upstream had to be modified to fit inside sage) was necessary: Linbox is a C++ library heavily using templates, and at that time Cython was not capable of handling C++ libraries. Thus a C-only interface had to be built into LinBox.

Cython has improved, and sage's linbox binding should now be capable of accessing LinBox directly, removing the need for a dedicated interface upstream.

There is a problem that IML conflicts with linbox: â€‹https://github.com/linbox-team/linbox/issues/35

I understand, however, as you know, fixing the problem requires:
a. Fixing upstream
b. Opening, reviewing and merging a new ticket for the new upstream package

Upstream evolves slowly (the previous version in sage, 1.3.2, was released in 2012...). I'm afraid that this whole process will take a long time, and I'm worried that this ticket will stall for reasons that are beyond my control. I started working on this 3 weeks ago, and backward-incompatible changes were introduced in both the Givaro and Linbox packages, that have been upgraded in sage recently. As such, I had to figure that out when I rebased.

I'd rather see this ticket go through quickly, instead of seeing it rot.

Hello,

I just discovered this ticket while working on #22924 (see also #22872 and [cylinbox](https://github.com/videlec/cylinbox)). My original aim was actually to use linbox for solving sparse integer systems. However, a cleanup was needed before.

I will read what is in the branch `u/Bouillaguet/linbox_cpp` before going further. Charles, do you plan continuing working on it?
