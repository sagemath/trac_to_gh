For example ``QQ['a','b'],['x','y']`` flattens to ``QQ['a','b','c','d']``.
```
should I read <code>\`\`QQ['a', 'b', 'x', 'y']\`\`</code>?

Would be good to add doctest for `QQbar`. By the way, the string method would also fail for something like the following (that would be good to doctest as well)

```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^3 - 2)
sage: R = K['x','y']['a','b']
```
