I plan to add code for Minkowski Decomposition of Polytopes
based on the algorithm in "On the space of Minkowski summands of a convex polytope" [http://www.eurocg2016.usi.ch/sites/default/files/paper_76.pdf](http://www.eurocg2016.usi.ch/sites/default/files/paper_76.pdf) (which appeared in the conference EuroCG 2016, Lugano, Switzerland, March 30-April 1, 2016)

For special cases such as associahedra, specialized algorithms are available - e.g., C. Lange, Discrete & Computational Geometry volume 50, pages 903–939 (2013) https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00454-013-9546-5
