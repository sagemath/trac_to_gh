/ffi.d:148:44: error: 'FFI_SYSV' undeclared here (not in a function)
[ecl-16.1.2.p2] Makefile:85: recipe for target 'ffi.o' failed
```

The package libffi-devel-gcc5 is installed. The file `/usr/include/ffi.h` does not contain FFI_SYSV but the file ffitarget.h does and it is included unconditionally in ffi.h

It turns out the reason for the failure on OpenSuSE is that in ffitarget.h FFI_SYSV is not defined if `__x86_64__` is defined because the `__x86_64__` case preceeds the default case (where FFI_SYSV is defined as well). ECL however has this in `src/c/ffi.d`:

```
#ifdef HAVE_LIBFFI
static struct {
        const cl_object symbol;
        ffi_abi abi;
} ecl_foreign_cc_table[] = {
        {@':default', FFI_DEFAULT_ABI},
#ifdef X86_WIN32
        {@':cdecl', FFI_SYSV},
        {@':sysv', FFI_SYSV},
        {@':stdcall', FFI_STDCALL},
#elif defined(X86_WIN64)
        {@':win64', FFI_WIN64},
#elif defined(X86_ANY) || defined(X86) || defined(X86_64)
        {@':cdecl', FFI_SYSV},
        {@':sysv', FFI_SYSV},
        {@':unix64', FFI_UNIX64},
#endif
};
```

Reported as https://gitlab.com/embeddable-common-lisp/ecl/issues/302

The workaround would be to deinstall the OpenSuSE package libffi-devel-gcc5 which falls back to installing an earlier version of libffi-devel. Ultimately this must be resolved in libecl/libffi however.

Another workaround is using `SAGE_INSTALL_GCC=yes` when making Sage.

Log is attached to #21804.

The incompatible libffi change happened here:

```
commit ef76205647bca77796882d31f6ab5e889f461f07
Author: Richard Henderson <rth@twiddle.net>
Date:   Thu Oct 30 12:13:31 2014 -0700

    x86: Tidy ffi_abi
    
    The x86_64 unix port only handles one ABI; don't define all of the
    other symbols.  The UNIX64 symbol retains the same value.
    
    The i386 ports ought to have the same symbols, even if we can't yet
    unify the values without incrementing the libffi soname.
```

This means all libffi versions from 3.2 up are incompatible.

It is still relevant. I am using the modern openSUSE Leap 15.0 and compiling sage gives the same error as in this bug report (a google search on the error led me here).
I had to uninstall libffi-devel from openSUSE.

One thing in the ticket description is buffling - that building Sage's gcc package is another workaround. As well, the topic still says gcc5 - aren't you on gcc7 meanwhile?

So all this needs an update, I suppose.
