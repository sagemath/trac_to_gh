Running ECM with almost any inputs results in a segfault on Cygwin64.

This is because any time it enters one of its hand-written assembly routines it needs to use the appropriate calling convention (Microsoft x64 convention on Windows), but it is only picking the correct Windows calling convention when compiling with mingw.  It should do the same with Cygwin as well.

One possible workaround without patching would be to configure ECM with `--disable-asm-redc` to disable the custom assembly code entirely.  But this is also overkill--the code works just fine as long as it's configured correctly for the platform.

Nope, in 7.0.3 (now `configure.ac`) there's still:

```sh

# do the necessary definitions and includes
  AC_DEFINE([USE_ASM_REDC],1,[Define to 1 to use asm redc])

  AC_SUBST([CCAS])
  GMP_PROG_M4
  GMP_ASM_UNDERSCORE
  GMP_ASM_TEXT
  GMP_ASM_GLOBL
  GMP_ASM_TYPE

  case $host in
    *-*-mingw32) GMP_DEFINE([WINDOWS64_ABI], 1)
                 AC_DEFINE([WINDOWS64_ABI], 1,[Define to 1 if x86_64 mulredc*() functions should be called with Windows ABI]);;
    *) ;;
  esac

  case $host in
    pentium3-*-*)
      echo "WARNING: Your processor is recognized as Pentium3."
      echo "         The asm code uses SSE2, and therefore it might"

1. This should be reported upstream.

2. You need to patch `configure.in` *before* `configure` otherwise the build system will want to run `autoconf` to update `configure`.

3. I cannot test this, but the patch is clear. If you say this makes ECM work on Cygwin64, that's good enough for me.

On **32-bit** systems (including Cygwin**32**), *other* assembly files are used, which may cause similar problems (because they at least don't care about Pascal calling convention).

There's also some *inline assembly* which is used on 32-bit (x86) systems only; there I'm not sure whether it complies also to the Win32 ABI w.r.t. register usage.

Sure.  In any case, it's easy to work around potential problems on Cygwin32 by simply setting `ECM_CONFIGURE="--disable-sse2 --disable-asm-redc"` before or when (re)installing the package.

I replied to Paul on the upstream bug report.  (The patch here won't *break* anything on Cygwin32, but it won't solve potential similar issues on 32-bit Cygwin either.)

You may try trunk (outside of Sage) with `--enable-sse2` (but without `--enable-asm-redc`), perhaps running `make longcheck` instead of just `make check`, and afterwards with `--enable-asm-redc` (but without `--enable-sse2`).

Some reports using ECM trunk.
On a x86_64, with a Cygwin64 setup, outside of Sage, using my own GMP 6.1.1 (dll) and Cygwin's GCC:

```
./configure --prefix=$LOCAL --with-gmp=$LOCAL --enable-shared --disable-static
```
I get

```

and make fails with

Windows does not like `$_GLOBAL_OFFSET_TABLE` I would say.

Using ECM 6.4.4 on my Cygwin64 setup with the patch to use Win64 ABI, I get a similar configuration and `make` is fine.
Surely `WANT_ASSERT` gets set in one case and not in the other, leading to the invalid use of the GOT in the trunk version.
But then `make check` fails with

```
./test.pp1 ./ecm.exe
Cygwin runtime failure: /home/jp/ecm-6.4.4/.libs/ecm.exe: Invalid relocation.  Offset 0x3025f223a at address 0x100414542 doesn't fit into 32 bits
############### ERROR ###############
Expected return code 8 but got 127
make: *** [Makefile:1982: check] Error 1
```

Going back to the trunk version and passing `--disable-assert`, `make` is fine.
And `make check` runs but fail all tests.

```
FAIL: test.pp1
FAIL: test.pm1
FAIL: test.ecm
```
with the same relocation errors as in 6.4.4 as the log files tell.

On the same x86_64 machine, with the trunk version, using a Cygwin32 setup with a similar configure command, I get:

```
configure: Build for host type i686-pc-cygwin
configure: CC=gcc, CFLAGS=-W -Wall -Wundef -m32 -O2 -pedantic -fomit-frame-pointer -mtune=sandybridge -march=sandybridge
configure: Linking GMP with -lgmp
configure: Not using asm redc code
configure: Using SSE2 instructions in NTT code
configure: Using APRCL to prove factors prime/composite
configure: Assertions enabled
configure: Shell command execution disabled
configure: OpenMP disabled
configure: Memory debugging disabled
```
and `make` and `make check` are ok.

I'm not sure I understand the meaning--I took "in a later stable release" to mean there will eventually be a stable release that contains this fix.  "Later" to me implies that it doesn't exist yet, but will.

No, "later" refers to what we currently have in Sage, so *"fixed in a later [stable] upstream release"* means there exists some upstream version without the issue, but Sage hasn't yet upgraded to it (which is quite often the case as some upgrades aren't straight-forward, for various reasons).
