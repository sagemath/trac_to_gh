Given a modular abelian variety, this function returns the newforms of the simple subvarieties in the decomposition of self as a product of simple subvarieties, up to isogeny.

There is currently a decomposition method for modular abelian variety but it does a lot more work than just finding the newforms. For many purposes, just determining is newforms is sufficient.
