This again... corrected.

> and remove the comma here <code>Return \`\`True\`\` if the lattice is join-distributive, and \`\`False\`\` otherwise.</code>

Duh. Done, but this exactly same phrase is used in about 20 functions. This is one more reason to have a "prototype" of specific kind of functions.

More to do?
