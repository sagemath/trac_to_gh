Implement functions to compute the blow up of an affine curve at a point, and to construct a nonsingular model for the curve by blowing up its singular points. These functions should describe the blow up/nonsingular model in terms of affine patches.

    "body": "<div id=\"comment:6\" align=\"right\">comment:6</div>\n\nI think this is looking good overall. I have a few nits and a couple suggestions.\n\n- you have no examples over `A^3` or higher even though it is in the general curve class\n\n- I'm not sure I like the behavior that you get when you resolve a curve where all the singularities are not rational. You essentially get the curve itself back. Perhaps you should raise an error of the form \"no rational singularities, use extend=True\" or something like that.\n\n  - you should explicitly use the keyword in examples: 'extend=True' instead of just 'True'\n\n- For the extend = True example, here is one that takes < 1s instead of the 3s that yours takes. I didn't look closely at yours, so if it tests additional functionality, then by all means leave it.\n\n```\nC=A.curve(x^4 + 2*x^2 + y^3 + 1)\n```\n- I was testing blowup() and really wanted to pass it a point other than the original. Is that a pain, to translate the point and then translate back?\n\n\n- the error cases are not run in the examples and they should be\n\n- in extension(): two code improvements\n\n```\nL = [pt[j] for j in range(len(self.ambient_space().gens())) for pt in pts]}}\n```\ncan be the simpler\n\n```\nL = [t for pt in pts for t in pt ]\n```\n\nand\n\n```\nK = number_field_elements_from_algebraics(L)[0]\nreturn [K, self.base_ring().embeddings(K)[0]]\n```\ncan be\n\n```\nK,a,phi = ...\nreturn [K,phi]\n```\nsince number_field_elements_from_algebraic returns the embedding it used, so you can return that instead of just the first element of embeddings.",

I think this is looking good overall. I have a few nits and a couple suggestions.

- you have no examples over `A^3` or higher even though it is in the general curve class

- I'm not sure I like the behavior that you get when you resolve a curve where all the singularities are not rational. You essentially get the curve itself back. Perhaps you should raise an error of the form "no rational singularities, use extend=True" or something like that.

  - you should explicitly use the keyword in examples: 'extend=True' instead of just 'True'

- For the extend = True example, here is one that takes < 1s instead of the 3s that yours takes. I didn't look closely at yours, so if it tests additional functionality, then by all means leave it.

```
C=A.curve(x^4 + 2*x^2 + y^3 + 1)
```
- I was testing blowup() and really wanted to pass it a point other than the original. Is that a pain, to translate the point and then translate back?


- the error cases are not run in the examples and they should be

- in extension(): two code improvements

```
L = [pt[j] for j in range(len(self.ambient_space().gens())) for pt in pts]}}
```
can be the simpler

```
L = [t for pt in pts for t in pt ]
```

and

```
K = number_field_elements_from_algebraics(L)[0]
return [K, self.base_ring().embeddings(K)[0]]
```
can be

```
K,a,phi = ...
return [K,phi]
```
since number_field_elements_from_algebraic returns the embedding it used, so you can return that instead of just the first element of embeddings.

Thanks! Made most of the changes.

There were two `A^3` examples in blowup() and resolution_of_singularities() so I left those as is, but I could still add some more higher dim. examples (the output gets long quickly).

For the extension() function I tried using the composite_fields functionality that number fields have; I think this might be cleaner than the approach I was trying with passing the generator of a number field as a QQbar element to number_field_elements_from_algebraics along with the other QQbar numbers in order to get a bigger field.

I think I could get blowup() to work for arbitrary points. After moving a point to the origin and blowing up, I'm not sure how to transform back though as the blowup will live in a mixed product space. I think maybe just constructing the ideal for the blow up centered at a different point directly might work.

Given a point `P = (p_1,...,p_n)`, I think the ideal of the blow up at that point would be generated by the polynomials `(x_i - p_i)s_j - (x_j - p_j)s_i` where the `x_i` are the coords for the affine component, and the `s_i` are the coords of the projective component of the product space. I tried something like this in my first attempt at the blowup function, but was unsure whether it was the right construction. Do you think this gives the right ideal? It seems like it should still give the closure of the graph of the rational map defined `(x_1,...,x_n) ---> (x_1 - p_1 :... : x_n - p_n)` which I think is how the blow up at `P` is defined.

Ok, I generalized the blowup() function to work for arbitrary points. This simplified some of the code in resolution_of_singularities since there's no longer a need to keep track of change of coordinate maps used to move points to the origin. However, I ran into a couple of issues when testing some higher dimension examples.

It seems that the way I was trying to isolate the strict transforms of the curves wrt the blow ups isn't always sufficient for higher dimension curves, and sometimes the resulting curves would be reducible even though the original curves were irreducible. To address this, the blowup() function now looks at the irreducible components of the transformed curve (after substituting the relations that hold in a particular chart of the blowup) and ignores any component that lies within the exceptional divisor.

In implementing the above I noticed another issue which occurs when the transform of the curve coincides with the exceptional divisor. An example of this is when blowing up the line `x` at the origin; in one of the charts the transformed line and the exceptional divisor both seem to be defined by `x`. If I understand correctly the strict transform is the closure of the preimage by the projection map of the line minus the origin, which I think should be empty in that chart. The output in the current implementation is:

```
A.<x,y> = AffineSpace(QQ, 2)
C = A.curve([x])
C.blowup([0,0])[0]
(Closed subscheme of Affine Space of dimension 2 over Rational Field
defined by: 1, Affine Plane Curve over Rational Field defined by s0)
```

Should the strict transform be empty in the first chart, and if so, would it be better to leave that chart out of the output?

I also encountered an unrelated issue with applying change_ring to the transition maps when extending the base field. A simplified example of the problem is:

```
K.<a> = QuadraticField(-1)
A.<x,y> = AffineSpace(K, 2)
H = End(A)
phi = H([x/y, y])
emb = K.embeddings(QQbar)[0]
phi.change_ring(emb)
```

which raises a `TypeError` without any description. This appears to only be an issue when there are actual fraction field elements defining the morphism. The line that breaks is `R = self.coordinate_ring().hom(R, T.ambient_space().coordinate_ring())` in the `change_ring` function for the SchemeMorphism_polynomial class of generic/morphism.py. Is this actually a bug, or perhaps am I just misusing the functionality?

Alright, I made the changes and did some more functionality testing. So far everything seems to be working as intended on the examples I've come up with, and I think this should be good for review again.

I've also been trying to implement a projective blow up function; for a projective curve defined by `f_1,...,f_m` in `P^n`, I was thinking to use the ideal generated by `f_1,...,f_m, x_i*y_j - x_j*y_i` for `i,j = 0,...,n-1` in the product space `P^n\times P^{n-1}` to define the blow up of the curve at the point `(0:...:0:1)`, where the `x_i` are the coords for `P^n` and the `y_i` are the coords for `P^{n-1}`.

This seems fine to me, so I'll mark it positive.

As for the projective blow-up. Those equations don't really make a lot of sense. I was trying to think of a general form for a projective blow-up, but really, this is a local object and the most natural way to think of it is through affine charts anyway.

So I'm fine with holding off on projective blow-ups.
