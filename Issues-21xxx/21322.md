`@coerce_binop` is an important decorator used on binary operators to automagically apply the coercion framework on its arguments. It's widely used on e.g. `gcd` operations (`_add_`, `_sub_` etc. have coercion handled with another mechanism).

The current `@coerce_binop` has the following dangerous behaviour, where, if the decorated method is given an extra unnamed argument, the `self`-argument is swallowed:

```
    sage: P.<x> = GF(5)[]
    sage: f = x^2
    sage: g = x
    sage: f.gcd(g)
    x
    sage: f.gcd(g, 1)
    1
```

The reason is that `@coerce_binop` included a hack to allow calls such as
`Polynomial.gcd(f,g)` where `f` and `g` are polynomials and the `gcd` method is
decorated with `@coerce_binop`. The reason that this required a hack at all is that `@coerce_binop` was implemented as a class: it seems that creating decorators as classes implies a very unfortunate behaviour:

```
class MyDec:

   def __init__(self, f):
       self.f = f

   def __call__(self, x):
       print "decorated: ", self , x
       self.f(x)

mydec = MyDec

class A:

    def __init__(self, a):
        self.a = a

    @mydec
    def met(self, x):
        print "x:", x
        
myA = A(1)
myA.met(5)

```

the above prints something like

```
    decorated:  <__main__.MyDec instance at 0x7f63c5ab6c20> 5
```

and then crashes with 

```
    AttributeError: MyDec instance has no attribute 'a'
```

This is because the `self` in `__call__` of `MyDec` becomes the `MyDec` instance
-- the `A` instance is never passed to the decorating class instance!


The solution here is to rewrite `coerce_binop` as a function. At the same time, we can use `@sage_wraps` which ensures proper documentation (e.g. source file and line which was not retained in the previous `coerce_binop`).
