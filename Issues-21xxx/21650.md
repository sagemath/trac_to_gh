Every grepping of source code is easier if there is just one way to do something. Also some user might wonder if there is a difference between ... and ....:. Hence I suggest mass change from old-style doctest continuation lines.

This part does that in graphs folder.

Done by

```
find src/sage/graphs/ -name '*.py' -or -name '*.pyx' | xargs perl -e 's|^( *)\.\.\.  |\1....:|g;' -p -i.bak

It would be nice if you also fixed the indentations to have 4 spaces on these doctests while we are at it (there are a few that have less). You can set a positive review on my behalf either way.

Good point, but there are much more of those, see

```
egrep -R '^ *\.\.\.\.: {1,3}[^ ]' src/sage  | wc -l
```

Hence I open a new ticket about this; that shall be done after all old-style line continuations are done.
