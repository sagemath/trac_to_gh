This patch will 1) slightly speed up computing `is_eulerian()`, 2) make it possible to check if a poset is (only) k-eulerian for some integer k, 3) get a "certificate" of non-eulerianity, i.e. endpoints of a non-eulerian interval and 4) add `star_product()`. The last logically belongs to this IMO, as it is mostly used for generating a new Eulerian poset.

It is logically possible to define this for `P` and `Q` if `P` has top and `Q` has bottom. However, this implementation requires both to have both bottom and top. On the other hand this does not check if a poset is graded.

Do you have a reference for testing only even ranks differences ?

Those corrected. I don't know if I should write "k-Eulerian" or "k-eulerian"; Volker said that english is not consistent on that.
