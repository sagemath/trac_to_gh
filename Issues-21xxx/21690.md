This only started since #21221 was merged.

There are two issues here, one of which is definitely an upstream bug, and the other of which is more of an omission but could be addressed upstream as well.

1. Compiling with `-std=c++11` fails on Cygwin.  I haven't pinpointed the *exact* cause, but this is not the first time (e.g. #21185) this has been an issue on Cygwin.  Really this is a bug with newlib, which has bugs in its headers w.r.t. C standard versions.  Compiling with `-std=gnu++11` fixes the first two issues above.  This could be addressed either in Sage's `spkg-install` or in a patch to fplll's `configure.ac`.

2. The second issue is simply a bug.  fplll does not define the macro `FPLLL_WITH_LONG_DOUBLE` on Cygwin, so the definition of the destructor `~LLLReduction()` should be be bracketed with `#ifdef FPLLL_WITH_LONG_DOUBLE`

(P.S. I can't wait to get that cygwin build bot up and running :D)

Here's an initial fix (against #21675) which includes the patch to `lll.h` and a patch to `spkg-install`.

I'm also about to try a patch to the `configure.ac` for supporting Cygwin.
