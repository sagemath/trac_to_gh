The Chow ring of a matroid was implemented in ticket #19587.  However, there is a small error in the set of quadratic relations.  The line 

```
Q = [gens[i] * gens[i+j+1] for i,F in enumerate(flats)
     for j,G in enumerate(flats[i+1:]) if F < G or G < F]
```
should read

```
Q = [gens[i] * gens[i+j+1] for i,F in enumerate(flats)
     for j,G in enumerate(flats[i+1:]) if not (F < G or G < F)]
```
since the quadratic relations are imposed when two flats are incomparable.
