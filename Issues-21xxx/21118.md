<a id='comment:4'></a>A couple things here.

- the 2nd doc test fails without #21108, so that should be list as a dependency on the ticket

- OUTPUT: List -> List of integers

- the block

```
if self.is_morphism():
    D = [1,self.degree()]
    for n in range(2, iterates+1):
        D.append(D[1]**n)
```

can be replaced with

```
if self.is_morphism():
    d = self.degree()
    return [d**k for k in range(iterates+1)]
```

- the line

```
for n in range(0, iterates+1):
```

can be written as

```
for n in range(iterates+1):
```

- add a todo block to improve the iteration after composition (#15378) is implemented
