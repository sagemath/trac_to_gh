```
Currently, (1) at runtime sage requires some files from under SAGE_DOC_SRC. For example:

```
$ git grep SAGE_DOC_SRC -- src/sage
[..]
src/sage/misc/sagedoc.py:    sys.path = [os.path.join(SAGE_DOC_SRC, 'common')] + oldpath
[..]
src/sage/misc/sphinxify.py:    confdir = os.path.join(SAGE_DOC_SRC, 'en', 'introspect')
```

However, this is awkward for binary distros such as Debian, who don't install source code onto end user machines by default. Indeed, even Sage's own Makefiles don't install these files into SAGE_LOCAL, even though they are a runtime necessity.

In addition to this, (2) there are many cases where Sage tracks SAGE_DOC_SRC and hacks it into `sys.path` via `os.environ`, which is not very clean.

This ticket proposes the following change (or something similar)

- src/doc/common/* -> src/sage/docs/common/*
- src/doc/en/introspect/* -> src/sage/docs/introspect/*


This would solve the above two issues - instead of (2) one can just do `from sage.doc.common import conf` or `from sage.doc.introspect import conf`, and (1) is taken care of automatically because everything under `src/sage` is installed as standard python modules.

One could also remove the `OMIT = ["introspect"]` exception in src/sage_setup/docbuild/build_options.py.

Does this sound sensible? If so I can do this for our Debian packaging already, test it, and send in an initial patch.

Putting the documentation as top-level directory of the project is the standard thing to do with Sphinx. We aren't quite using Sphinx in the standard way as there is a lot of Sage customization, but still... I see no reason to be even more different.

Just saying "it would make our lives easier to do X" is not a good explanation. You really need to justify better why you want to do X.

If you use an argument of the form "I want X because it helps Y" and we both agree that Y is a good thing, you still need to explain why X helps with Y. And I am totally missing that.

And this title is totally confusing me, I hardly see how it relates to moving `src/doc/common`. It might relate to moving the `introspect` doc, but then the title covers only a part of the ticket.

I'm starting to agree it would be good if this common doc stuff just went in a `sage.misc.docs` sub-package or something.  As it is common/conf.py imports from sage so it already has a dependency on it anyways.

This would be a good move toward the previously-discussed ideal of making it easier for third-party packages to use Sage's documentation utilities.

Another options which I've brought up before is to move all docs-related utilities to a separate sage_documention package (to which `sage_setup.docbuild` would also be moved).  This would necessarily be a runtime dependency of sage for docstring sphinxifying to work.

Here's my attempt at solving this.  It included a few other changes that I felt were needed (in addition to #22061), but that are not directly relevant either, so might be worth moving to another ticket.

I don't feel strongly about the choice of `sage.misc.docs`, but I am convinced that these files should be somewhere (for now) in the `sage` package.

I've reviewed this patch and it look quite good to me (though I'm not very competent about the necessity of this changes for better packaging in distros). I still have a few remark

- I agree with the comment in the head of commit [1e372a8](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/1e372a8e0cd5cab6523f6cafba7698bfa0761a07) that the moving of ``module_list.py`` into ``sage_setup`` should go into another ticket.

- I would have put thing under something like ``sage/doc-conf`` or ``sage/doc-script``. I'm not too happy putting this in misc...

- In `sage_setup/docbuild/__init__.py`, it says:
  {{{
  The sphinx subprocesses are configured in conf.py
  }}}
  I'd rather put here a comment explaining where to find this `conf.py` and why it was moved there.

- Finally, we should take the opportunity to update `python.inv`.

I'm not sure I'm completely competent to put a positive review here. And I'd rather have someone else looking quickly.

Replying to [embray](#comment%3A45):
> jdemeyer: You had mentioned that there was some other work you were doing that this ticket should depend on?  Is there a branch for that posted yet, that I could base on?  Or is mainly just a matter of naming the package in sage `sage.doc` (or is it `sage.docs`)?


There is at least #22611, which creates the `sage.docs` directory.

You should also be aware of #22252 which affects docbuilding. Depending on how well `git` can deal with renames, this will probably not actually conflict.

New branch for this ticket based on #22655, which separates out the build changes to be considered separately.  This now just makes the code moves suggested in the description of the ticket.

To be clear, nothing substantive changed in these files except to update some imports, and remove bits of code that were previously needed to manipulate `sys.path`.  Now functions like `sphinxify` can work without `SAGE_DOC_SRC` needing to be installed somewhere on the system.
