Currently, (1) at runtime sage requires some files from under SAGE_DOC_SRC. For example:

```
$ git grep SAGE_DOC_SRC -- src/sage
[..]
src/sage/misc/sagedoc.py:    sys.path = [os.path.join(SAGE_DOC_SRC, 'common')] + oldpath
[..]
src/sage/misc/sphinxify.py:    confdir = os.path.join(SAGE_DOC_SRC, 'en', 'introspect')
```

However, this is awkward for binary distros such as Debian, who don't install source code onto end user machines by default. Indeed, even Sage's own Makefiles don't install these files into SAGE_LOCAL, even though they are a runtime necessity.

In addition to this, (2) there are many cases where Sage tracks SAGE_DOC_SRC and hacks it into `sys.path` via `os.environ`, which is not very clean.

This ticket proposes the following change (or something similar)

- src/doc/common/* -> src/sage/docs/common/*
- src/doc/en/introspect/* -> src/sage/docs/introspect/*


This would solve the above two issues - instead of (2) one can just do `from sage.doc.common import conf` or `from sage.doc.introspect import conf`, and (1) is taken care of automatically because everything under `src/sage` is installed as standard python modules.

One could also remove the `OMIT = ["introspect"]` exception in src/sage_setup/docbuild/build_options.py.

Does this sound sensible? If so I can do this for our Debian packaging already, test it, and send in an initial patch.

Putting the documentation as top-level directory of the project is the standard thing to do with Sphinx. We aren't quite using Sphinx in the standard way as there is a lot of Sage customization, but still... I see no reason to be even more different.

Just saying "it would make our lives easier to do X" is not a good explanation. You really need to justify better why you want to do X.

If you use an argument of the form "I want X because it helps Y" and we both agree that Y is a good thing, you still need to explain why X helps with Y. And I am totally missing that.

And this title is totally confusing me, I hardly see how it relates to moving `src/doc/common`. It might relate to moving the `introspect` doc, but then the title covers only a part of the ticket.

I agree that sage at runtime should not refer to anything in SAGE_DOC_SRC.
Whatever is needed from there should be installed in an appropriate place in SAGE_LOCAL.

I'm starting to agree it would be good if this common doc stuff just went in a `sage.misc.docs` sub-package or something.  As it is common/conf.py imports from sage so it already has a dependency on it anyways.

This would be a good move toward the previously-discussed ideal of making it easier for third-party packages to use Sage's documentation utilities.

Here's my attempt at solving this.  It included a few other changes that I felt were needed (in addition to #22061), but that are not directly relevant either, so might be worth moving to another ticket.

I don't feel strongly about the choice of `sage.misc.docs`, but I am convinced that these files should be somewhere (for now) in the `sage` package.

I've reviewed this patch and it look quite good to me (though I'm not very competent about the necessity of this changes for better packaging in distros). I still have a few remark

- I agree with the comment in the head of commit [1e372a8](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/1e372a8e0cd5cab6523f6cafba7698bfa0761a07) that the moving of ``module_list.py`` into ``sage_setup`` should go into another ticket.

- I would have put thing under something like ``sage/doc-conf`` or ``sage/doc-script``. I'm not too happy putting this in misc...

- In `sage_setup/docbuild/__init__.py`, it says:

  ```
  The sphinx subprocesses are configured in conf.py
  ```
  I'd rather put here a comment explaining where to find this `conf.py` and why it was moved there.

- Finally, we should take the opportunity to update `python.inv`.

I'm not sure I'm completely competent to put a positive review here. And I'd rather have someone else looking quickly.

The other changes are necessary because of the poor way we currently handle non-Python files in packages, and I made some improvements there.  You're right though that it's not directly related; rather it was a prerequisite.  I could create a separate ticket if you prefer and move those changes.  Then this ticket would become dependent on the new ticket.

I'm not really convinced that you need to make such big changes (like moving `module_list.py`). But if you do make those changes, I think they should be on a different ticket.

To be clear, nothing substantive changed in these files except to update some imports, and remove bits of code that were previously needed to manipulate `sys.path`.  Now functions like `sphinxify` can work without `SAGE_DOC_SRC` needing to be installed somewhere on the system.
