This is a follow up to #17254 which upgraded to singular 4:

The linking order for Singular libraries is determined by `pkgconfig` which gives

```
-lomalloc -lSingular -lpolys -lfactory -lresources
```
This does not look that right.

This is because `pkgconfig` uses sets that don't preserve the order of libraries (and include directories or macros etc...).

A solution is to migrate `pkgconfig`  from sets to list.

https://github.com/matze/pkgconfig/issues/10 

has been opened upstream to explain the rational, along with a pull request to implement it at 

https://github.com/matze/pkgconfig/pull/11

This has now been accepted upstream and is part of a new release with a few other fixes.

You mean during the build of Singular itself or Sage modules using Singular?

I have been working on making `pkgconfig` use lists instead of sets and then doing some deduplication. 

There are two issues with deduplication - which was originally achieved by using sets:
* Is it really necessary, that makes longer lines but `pkg-config` doesn't do it in the first place. Which brings us to second issue
* Currently the first instance of everything is kept. Not a problem for macros, may be for include directories and library directories. Definitely a potential problem for libraries.

I don't think deduplication - potentially from the end of the list rather than the beginning of it, is worth it.

Opinion?

On second thought, the problem is really in `pkgconfig` (the Python package) which simply reads the system `.pc` files. So there is no need to regenerate the `.pc` files. So no further action is needed I guess.

I am now going to do a complete build from scratch with this ticket and see if it works...

Hum, I can reproduce it. It is triggered by the `site.cfg` generated for `numpy` (installed at `local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/numpy/distutils/site.cfg`). There is now a repetition of `openblas` for `blas_libs` and that seems to be the issue strangely enough (it should be able to take more than one library).
