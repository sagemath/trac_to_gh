This is a follow up to #17254 which upgraded to singular 4:

The linking order for Singular libraries is determined by `pkgconfig` which gives

```
-lomalloc -lSingular -lpolys -lfactory -lresources
```
This does not look that right.

This is because `pkgconfig` uses sets that don't preserve the order of libraries (and include directories or macros etc...).

A solution is to migrate `pkgconfig`  from sets to list.

https://github.com/matze/pkgconfig/issues/10 

has been opened upstream to explain the rational, along with a pull request to implement it at 

https://github.com/matze/pkgconfig/pull/11

This has now been accepted upstream and is part of a new release with a few other fixes.

**Tarball**: [https://pypi.python.org/packages/9d/ba/80910bbed2b4e646a6adab4474d2e506744c260c7002a0e6b41ef8750d8d/pkgconfig-1.2.2.tar.gz](https://pypi.python.org/packages/9d/ba/80910bbed2b4e646a6adab4474d2e506744c260c7002a0e6b41ef8750d8d/pkgconfig-1.2.2.tar.gz)

Upstream: Fixed upstream, in a later stable release.

You mean during the build of Singular itself or Sage modules using Singular?

which is what you are seeing. If you still have a sage with ATLAS somewhere look at what you get for lapack. This needs to be fixed upstream so that something preserving the order is used instead of a set.

<a id='comment:9'></a>I have been working on making `pkgconfig` use lists instead of sets and then doing some deduplication. 

There are two issues with deduplication - which was originally achieved by using sets:
* Is it really necessary, that makes longer lines but `pkg-config` doesn't do it in the first place. Which brings us to second issue
* Currently the first instance of everything is kept. Not a problem for macros, may be for include directories and library directories. Definitely a potential problem for libraries.

I don't think deduplication - potentially from the end of the list rather than the beginning of it, is worth it.

Opinion?

On second thought, the problem is really in `pkgconfig` (the Python package) which simply reads the system `.pc` files. So there is no need to regenerate the `.pc` files. So no further action is needed I guess.

I am now going to do a complete build from scratch with this ticket and see if it works...
