This is a follow up to #17254 which upgraded to singular 4:

The linking order for Singular libraries is determined by `pkgconfig` which gives

```
-lomalloc -lSingular -lpolys -lfactory -lresources
```
This does not look that right.

This is because `pkgconfig` uses sets that don't preserve the order of libraries (and include directories or macros etc...).

A solution is to migrate `pkgconfig`  from sets to list.

https://github.com/matze/pkgconfig/issues/10 

has been opened upstream to explain the rational, along with a pull request to implement it at 

https://github.com/matze/pkgconfig/pull/11

This has now been accepted upstream and is part of a new release with a few other fixes.

**Tarball**: [https://pypi.python.org/packages/9d/ba/80910bbed2b4e646a6adab4474d2e506744c260c7002a0e6b41ef8750d8d/pkgconfig-1.2.2.tar.gz](https://pypi.python.org/packages/9d/ba/80910bbed2b4e646a6adab4474d2e506744c260c7002a0e6b41ef8750d8d/pkgconfig-1.2.2.tar.gz)

You mean during the build of Singular itself or Sage modules using Singular?

That's an annoying defect that I have noticed before in the python interface to pkg-config. The libraries are put in a set and of course it is not preserving the order. It was already evident when using ATLAS for blas/lapack.

```
$ pkg-config --libs Singular
-lSingular -ldl -lpolys -lflint -lmpfr -lntl -lgmp -ldl -lfactory -lflint -lmpfr -lntl -lgmp -lomalloc -lresources 
```
but

```
$ python
Python 2.7.10 (default, Jun 12 2016, 19:30:46) 
[GCC 5.3.0] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import pkgconfig
>>> singular_pc = pkgconfig.parse('Singular')
>>> list(singular_pc['libraries'])
[u'omalloc', u'dl', u'Singular', u'polys', u'factory', u'flint', u'ntl', u'gmp', u'resources', u'mpfr']
>>> singular_pc['libraries']
set([u'omalloc', u'dl', u'Singular', u'polys', u'factory', u'flint', u'ntl', u'gmp', u'resources', u'mpfr'])
```
which is what you are seeing. If you still have a sage with ATLAS somewhere look at what you get for lapack. This needs to be fixed upstream so that something preserving the order is used instead of a set.

Is this upstream:

It does not look very active, last release was three years ago.

I have been working on making `pkgconfig` use lists instead of sets and then doing some deduplication. 

There are two issues with deduplication - which was originally achieved by using sets:
* Is it really necessary, that makes longer lines but `pkg-config` doesn't do it in the first place. Which brings us to second issue
* Currently the first instance of everything is kept. Not a problem for macros, may be for include directories and library directories. Definitely a potential problem for libraries.

I don't think deduplication - potentially from the end of the list rather than the beginning of it, is worth it.

Opinion?

 This does not look that right.

+This is because `pkgconfig` uses sets that don't preserve the order of libraries (and include directories or macros etc...).

+A solution is to migrate `pkgconfig`  from sets to list.

On second thought, the problem is really in `pkgconfig` (the Python package) which simply reads the system `.pc` files. So there is no need to regenerate the `.pc` files. So no further action is needed I guess.

I am now going to do a complete build from scratch with this ticket and see if it works...
