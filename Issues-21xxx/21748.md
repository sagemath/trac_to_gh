The current behavior of `mod` on Sage rationals is currently useless

```
sage: (2/3).mod(5)
0
sage: (2/3).mod(6)
0
```
And very different from what `mod_ui` does

```
sage: (2/3).mod_ui(5)
4
sage: (2/3).mod_ui(6)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ArithmeticError: The inverse of 3 modulo 6 is not defined.
```

This ticket stands for:
- changing the behavior of `mod` on rationals to be consistent to the current `mod_ui` (and handle the potential overflow in `mod_ui`)
- deprecate `mod_ui` in favor of `mod`

This change will make Sage compatible with PARI/GP `Mod` and maple `mod`.
