In categories, it is better to write `x + y` instead of `x._add_(y)` since the latter can be a lot slower if `_add_` is implemented in Cython.

We also remove several redundant implementations of `_sub_` where they coincide with the default implementation from `ModuleElement`.

I would think that avoiding the additional call to `__add__` (which does some additional checks) would result in a speed gain. Does this have to do with how cpdef functions are implemented in Cython?

<a id='comment:9'></a>And the call of `x + y` to `x.__add__(y)` is optimized by Python, so it is reasonably fast. Compare:

```
sage: timeit('a + a', number=10^6, repeat=20)

sage: timeit('a._add_(a)', number=10^6, repeat=20)

I don't really have an explanation of why `__add__` is slower than `_add_`, I would have expected them to be equally slow.

<a id='comment:11'></a>I checked the diff and it does what the ticket claims.

Just for a complete confirmation, could you post it a new benchmark where the code to be benchmarked is called 100 times in a loop inside a function? Just to make sure that there is no interference from the fact that we are timing at very low granularity.

Once confirmed, you can set a positive review on my behalf.

Thanks!
