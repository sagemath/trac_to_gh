In SageMath 7.5.rc0:

```
sage: JH(22, [-1]).decomposition()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
NotImplementedError:
```
The thing that is not implemented is a degeneracy map between spaces of modular symbols.

See also #21799.


Depends on #21927

It seems the following is a more immediate example:

```
sage: ModularSymbols(GammaH(11, [-1]), 2).modular_symbols_of_level(22)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: N (=22) should be a factor of the level                of this space (=11)
```
This does work when replacing `GammaH(11, [-1])` by `Gamma1(11)` or `Gamma0(11)`.

<a id='comment:4'>**Comment 4:**</a>
The above error is apparently deliberate, according to the following comment in the method `sage.modular.modsym.ambient.ModularSymbolsAmbient_wtk_gamma_h.modular_symbols_of_level`:

```
# We deliberately don't allow N to be a multiple of the level here,
# because there are many possibilities for what H could be at the
# higher level (and we don't implement the degeneracy raising maps
# anyway)
```
A canonical choice for the `H` at higher level `N` is to take the inverse image of `H` in (**Z**/*N***Z**)<sup>×</sup>.  However, we then still have to implement the degeneracy maps.  Doing this will require implementing the function `sage.modular.arithgroup.congroup.degeneracy_coset_representatives_gamma_h` and the method `sage.modular.modsym.ambient.ModularSymbolsAmbient_wtk_gamma_h._degeneracy_raising_matrix_1`.
