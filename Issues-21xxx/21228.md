This is a follow-up on #20259, which added the `output="matrix"` argument to `restricted_automorphism_group`. It returns a `MatrixGroup`.

In this ticket, I propose to add `output="affine"` to return an `AffineGroup`.

I wonder why I didn't do that in #20259. Either I didn't know about `AffineGroup` or it was lacking in functionality.

Answering my own question: it seems that an `AffineGroup` always refers to the group of *all* affine transformations, not a subgroup.

So, as far as I can tell, the object you want to return doesn't exist in Sage (and it would be non-trivial work to implement it).
