I am building Sage on a 32-bit Linux Docker (https://github.com/mkoeppe/docker-images/tree/master/sagemath-buildenv-32bit). 

Building ecl fails with this error: `getcontext failed: Use another register retrieval method?`

This is solved with a patch that is a backport from the patch mentioned here
https://github.com/ivmai/bdwgc/issues/133
(branch here: https://github.com/mkoeppe/bdwgc/tree/gc7_2f_sage)
