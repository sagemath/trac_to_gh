Hi Jeroen,

It's fine with me to remove this doctest either here or directly in #20767. The doctest just above will probably need to be changed too in #20767, right?

If you prefer to keep this change in this separate ticket, you can set a positive review on my behalf.

No, because that's `_mul_parent` which is still in `coercion_methods.pyx`.

Done. At this point I have a working #20767 but I'm trying to split off non-essential parts like this to make the review easier.
