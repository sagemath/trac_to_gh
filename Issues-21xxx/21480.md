This ticket changes the build process of sagelib in the following way:
- `src/Makefile` delegates ALL building to `src/setup.py`
- `src/setup.py` no longer depends on environment variables `$SAGE_ROOT`, `$SAGE_SRC`, `$SAGE_DOC_SRC` etc. (to demonstrate this, `Makefile` poisons these environment variables). It still depends on `$SAGE_LOCAL` and environment variables that point below it.

This ticket is meant as:
- preparation for VPATH builds of sage-the-distribution (#21469)
- working towards the goal of making `sagelib` pip-installable -- see #21507 for the eventual goal of having sagelib on PyPI
- making the flow of directory information at build time clearer for developers

 More specifically, the goal of this ticket is that only SAGE_LOCAL needs to be set when the user does 'pip install' of the sagelib. (This ticket almost achieves this, except it also needs SAGE_PKGS and SAGE_CYTHONIZED to be set. The hope is that #20382 and other future tickets will develop better mechanisms to communicate package and directory information to the build.)

. . . . . . . 

Some possibly useful information:
- Documentation on distutils (https://docs.python.org/2/install/), describing use of `--build-base` to do VPATH builds.
- `pip install` keeps the source directory clean, building instead in a temporary directory, by copying the sources. 
 `pip install` also offers options `--build` to select a build directory, but there are some pip issues: [2060](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/2060), [2053](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/2053), [804](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/804) that affect this
- #14807 has some tricks to making VPATH builds work without copying all python source files. But it uses automake instead of setup.sh; we will not do this in our ticket.

Am interesting issue is that technically `cython_debug` has to be installed somewhere (preferably somewhere standard) to be accessible at runtime separately from the source. 

I do something in sage-on-gentoo but that's not really satisfactory.

Yes, the plan *after* #21469 is to use the Sage builddir -- not just for sagelib, but also for other packages.

*Before* #21469 is merged, I want to use `$SAGE_ROOT/var/tmp/sage/build/sagelib` to match what other packages do.

Really `sagelib-$SAGE_VERSION`? Do you want to fill up everybody's hard disks with Sage build directories? Not to mention that this would require to rebuild everything whenever the Sage version changes.

i understand that SAGE_BUILD_DIR is the srcdir for toplevel configure.

as long as sagelib is rooted in $(toplevel)/src, it might be less confusing to choose $SAGE_BUILD_DIR/src (not $SAGE_BUILD_DIR/sagelib) as the builddir for sagelib.

(future: replace src by sagelib, but on both ends)

i dont know exactly how the approach using setup.py will emulate VPATH builds. i think it should imitate "what automake would do", where applicable.

Here's a first version for review. It seems to work for me.

There are still some to-do items (see comments in `src/Makefile`):

- I am now using `--build-base`, but setup.sh also depends on `SAGE_CYTHONIZED`, defined in `src/sage/env.py`.

 I think it would be better if `setup.sh` instead inferred that location from the build-base that was passed to it. 

 However, setup.sh already does a lot of stuff depending on `SAGE_CYTHONIZED` before `distutils.core.setup` is even called.
 Can this be fixed?

 I think I could use some help from the Python experts in the cc list of this ticket on this.

- `sage/libs/pari/auto_gen.pxi` and `sage/ext/interpreters/__init__.py` still need to be taken care of in preparation for the VPATH build.

Thinking about it more, I disagree with building in `$SAGE_BUILD_DIR/sagelib` by default.

`$SAGE_LOCAL` (which contains `$SAGE_BUILD_DIR`) is meant as *install* directory, not as *build* directory.

Let's keep `$SAGE_LOCAL` to be exactly the install directory and nothing else (*).

I *do* agree with making the build directory configurable for `VPATH` builds. For typical packages however, if you do not do a `VPATH` build, the build directory is the same as the source directory. Sage should follow the same model. This means that the build directory should be `$SAGE_SRC` *by default*.

> Let's keep $SAGE_LOCAL to be exactly the install directory and nothing else (*). 

this is part of the problem with the current "build system". SAGE_LOCAL is *not* the install directory. it is where stuff ends up during the build process.

outside sage, an install directory is typically what you pass to --prefix, and where stuff is put into by "make install". you do that (if you are a sysadmin), after assuring that "make check" passes...

yes i know why SAGE_LOCAL exists, but it should be clear that it's not necessary and that it only has "evolved" that way. having simplified things in the past, now it is falling on your feet.

note how i tried to fix/work\ around that in my attempt to autotoolize sage (both the library and the distribution)... my point: the best approach will be to *not use SAGE_LOCAL* at all. here's the chance to cleanup sagelib, as a start.

that said: keep up the good and interesting work @mkoeppe. i hope i will have some more time later this year ...

Why do you think that `$SAGE_LOCAL` is **not** the install directory? It is the directory where everything is installed, which by definition makes it the install directory. The fact that Sage does not (yet) support `--prefix` doesn't change this fact.

> the best approach will be to *not use SAGE_LOCAL* at all.

I like to know why you think that.

> Why do you think that $SAGE_LOCAL is not the install directory?

you wrote it. "--prefix" is not implemented/supported. (but it should be). there's no way to really "install" stuff in the usual sense. e.g., there is no way to *install stuff after make check has passed*. (i don't know if toplevel make check is currently implemented at all, just a thought).

> where everything is installed, which by definition makes it the install directory

actually nothing gets installed. what is done is mostly overhead. working around the fact that some packages don't work right after the build alone. when i was done with the "package content lists" for spkg-install, i noticed that it was a huge waste of time... don't repeat that, better just skip the "install" step.

> I like to know why you think that [SAGE_LOCAL should not be used].

every instance/use of SAGE_LOCAL breaks sagelib on (lets call it) foreign distros a bit. that's not helpful. it will as well interfere with any attempt on rewriting sage-the-distribution (be it autotools based, or pip or ebuild). the autotools approach (not a necessary step, but an example) provides a transition path to anything...

sage-the-distribution is a platform for sage (core) development. no more, no less. other platforms will come and go. what is needed is sagelib without the dependency on this (and on SAGE_LOCAL). why: because developers should be able to use sagelib and develop sage extensions on *their own platforms*, with *their own* tools and *their own* review policies.

so: please embrace contributions that reduce the use of SAGE_LOCAL.

(yes, its getting off-topic. but i hope, this answers the question.)

I agree on this as well. #21469 (VPATH for distro) will do that.

In this ticket, I first want to make the `--build-base` work. In particular, get rid of SAGE_CYTHONIZED.

This also works towards the eventual goal of making 'sagelib' pip-installable.

The actual location used is a detail that will be easy to change later.

The fact that the installation process does not implement `./configure --prefix` does not mean that it's not an installation process...

> every instance/use of SAGE_LOCAL breaks sagelib

But why? 

Of course, it's all a matter of definition. I consider the process of copying files to `$SAGE_LOCAL` an "installation" and you do not (for reasons which are still unclear to me). I think things will become much simpler for you if you accept the fact that `$SAGE_LOCAL` is the installation directory and that copying files to `$SAGE_LOCAL` is an installation.

I absolutely does not. You are just saying "it breaks stuff" but not explaining *why*.

One reason *why* is that in many deployment scenarios  you will want to test what you have built before installing it. And Sage does not support this.

indeed. in "build"-"check"-"install" there is not much room for definitions of "build" and "install".

this is drifting towards the question of whether or not sage should stick to common practices and terminology. you know i think it should.

Of course you can:

```
$ cd $package_source
$ sage --sh
$ ./configure --prefix="$SAGE_LOCAL"
$ make install
```

I have done this many times as first step of testing a new package or a package upgrade.

-Currently, building sagelib creates the `src/build` directory, with subdirectories `cython_debug`, `cythonized`, `lib.UNAME`, `temp.UNAME`. 
+This ticket changes the build process of sagelib in the following way:
+- `src/Makefile` delegates ALL building to `src/setup.sh`
+- `src/setup.sh` no longer depends on environment variables `$SAGE_ROOT`, `$SAGE_SRC`, `$SAGE_DOC_SRC`, `$SAGE_CYTHONIZED` etc. (to demonstrate this, `Makefile` poisons these environment variables). It still depends on `$SAGE_LOCAL` and environment variables that point below it.
+- `src/setup.sh` accepts `build --build-base=BUILD-BASE`. This is where building takes place (where subdirectories `cython_debug`, `cythonized`, `lib.UNAME`, `temp.UNAME` are created). The default is the `build` subdirectory (of `src`).
+- `src/Makefile` sets `--build-base` to the `build-sagelib` subdirectory (of `src`).
 
-In preparation for VPATH builds of sage-the-distribution (#21469), let's keep `src/` clean by using `setup.py --build-base=$SAGE_BUILD_DIR/sagelib`
+This ticket is meant as:
+- preparation for VPATH builds of sage-the-distribution (#21469)
+- working towards the goal of making `sagelib` pip-installable 
 
-(`$SAGE_BUILD_DIR` defaults to `$SAGE_ROOT/var/tmp/sage/build/`)
-
-As a second goal of this ticket, `setup.sh` is put in charge of ALL sagelib building. 
+. . . . . . . 
 
 Some possibly useful information:
 - Documentation on distutils (https://docs.python.org/2/install/), describing use of `--build-base` to do VPATH builds.

Moreover, there are too many things already called "build" -- better be specific.

`setup.sh` needs to be in charge of building everything, if sagelib is to become a well-behaved Python package.

Well, it's easy for the reviewer to test a different value of `--build-base`.

> Moreover, there are too many things already called "build" -- better be specific.

But `src/build` is pretty clear: it is the build directory corresponding to `src`, which is the Sage library. I don't like to change it just for the sake of changing it.

I am aware that the arg parsing code is ad hoc, but it's easy to understand code. 

I do not want to defer getting `--build-base` working to some distant future, when someone finds the time to clean up `setup.py`.

The current structure of `setup.py` does not make this easy. SAGE_CYTHONIZED is used before `setup` is even invoked.

I want the feature of `--build-base` now, not in the distant future. It is easily achieved with this patch. 
The arg parsing is ad hoc; but given the current state of `setup.py`, which does not take care at all about standard distutils behavior, it is an improvement.

My other concerns while they could influence design here are separate issues:
* separation of build time, doctest time and runtime variables. `SAGE_SRC` shouldn't be found in runtime code for example, neither does `package.py` belong there.
* Is there a standard place where `cython_debug` can be installed? It is needed for debugging and shouldn't live under `SAGE_SRC`.

Agreed on a separate ticket. But I mention `cython_debug` because it is mentioned in the summary. I am pointing to the fact that it should be installable when it is currently not. I am on an awareness campaign :)

You don't need the `--build-base` hack for VPATH builds to work. You could just set `SAGE_CYTHONIZED` correctly from the `Makefile`.

 This ticket changes the build process of sagelib in the following way:

-- `src/Makefile` sets `--build-base` to the `build-sagelib` subdirectory (of `src`).
 
 This ticket is meant as:
 - preparation for VPATH builds of sage-the-distribution (#21469)
 - working towards the goal of making `sagelib` pip-installable -- see #21507 for the eventual goal of having sagelib on PyPI
+- making the flow of directory information at build time clearer for developers

With this change I've tested that I can do `sage -n jupyter` and then run a kernel from the Jupyter notebook. 
`SAGE_LOCAL/bin/sage` picks up its environment variables from the server that runs it, so everything works.
Does it have to work in other settings that I'm unaware of as well?

- #21508: Clean up src/setup.py to bring it to standard distutils behavior
- #21535: Make src/setup.py independent of SAGE_CYTHONIZED

true.

there is a python alternative that is no more complex than a simple makefile *plus* make. it's the simple makefile + a *subset* of make implemented in python. (yes, you could use GNU make as an intermediate solution...)

but seriously: what's all the fuss about reinventing and replacing make? it should obviously be the other way round: python is not the right tool for the job, it's make. unlike python, make is *designed* for this. no matter which language you implement it in.

if there's a need for a make replacement (completely different[tm]), is sage the right community or the right project to invent it in?

For the record: in sage-on-gentoo I ship the `.pyx` files next to the matching `.so` files. In any case distro ship debugging symbols without the sources. Of course at some point you may need the source code but this is trivial to get and unfold separately in most cases.
