Installing the optional `python3` package leaves the Sage installation unusable. 

The package should be marked as experimental, so that users are warned about it.

This has been suggested in [a previous discussion in 2015 ... continued in 2016](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-support/Xecajaxz1rA/6yVdH-ZkAwAJ), but no action was taken. Let's get this done in 7.4.

Of course, it would even be better if installing of `python3` did not break the Sage installation -- that's ticket #21199.

Thanks for the review.

Sage does have a distinction between "safe" optional and "dangerous" experimental packages.
The only package that I know that actually breaks the whole Sage implementation is `python3`. 

This ticket is not about fixing a bug in an optional package, but rather fixing the misclassification bug of this package. 

Moreover it seems important enough to me to get it into the current release.

IMHO a **requirement** on an optional package is that it does not break the doctests, if installed. And this one surely does, blocker or not.
