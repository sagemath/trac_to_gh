in fact it is related to the singular update #17254 where all the 

```
if r.ringtype == 0:
```
were replaced by 

```
if r.cf.type == n_unknown:
```
but it seems not equivalent with QQ coefficients.

Remarks: The interred_libsingular function of multi_polynomial_ideal_libsingular.pyx
ends with an explicit:

```
# divide head by coeffi
...
```
and the groebner_basis function doc have still five examples giving:

```
[a - 60*c^3 + 158/7*c^2 + 8/7*c - 1, b + 30*c^3 - 79/7*c^2 + 3/7*c, c^4 - 10/21*c^3 + 1/84*c^2 + 1/84*c]
```
so what is the best thing for the interreduced_basis command to output?

<a id='comment:1'></a>I don't think that it is related to #21860 (giac update), but it is related to the singular upgrade:

with sage 7.5beta2 (singular4)

```
sage: P.<a,b,c> = PolynomialRing(QQ,3, order='lex') 
sage: toto=ideal([7*a - 420*c^3 + 158*c^2 + 8*c - 7, 7*b + 210*c^3 - 79*c^2 + 3*c, 84*c^4 - 40*c^3 + c^2 + c])

sage: 
```
but with older versions with singular3 it gives

```
[a - 60*c^3 + 158/7*c^2 + 8/7*c - 1, b + 30*c^3 - 79/7*c^2 + 3/7*c, c^4 - 10/21*c^3 + 1/84*c^2 + 1/84*c]

<a id='comment:2'></a>In fact the doctest was not using the result computed by giac but was recomputing everything with singular so I have changed this.

I have not yet changed the output doc string because it seems not coherent with the documentation of
interreduced_basis:

```
   If this ideal is spanned by (f_1, ..., f_n) this method returns
   (g_1, ..., g_s) such that:

   * (f_1,...,f_n) = (g_1,...,g_s)

   * LT(g_i) != LT(g_j) for all i != j

   * LT(g_i) does not divide m for all monomials m of

        {g_1,...,g_{i-1},g_{i+1},...,g_s}

   * LC(g_i) == 1 for all i if the coefficient ring is a field.

```
but

```
sage: P.<a,b,c> = PolynomialRing(QQ,3, order='lex')
sage: toto=ideal([7*a - 420*c^3 + 158*c^2 + 8*c - 7, 7*b + 210*c^3 - 79*c^2 + 3*c, 84*c^4 - 40*c^3 + c^2 + c])
....: 
sage: g=toto.interreduced_basis()
sage: g[0].lc()
7
sage: toto.base_ring()

<a id='comment:9'></a>So if I am right it seems that the old test ringtype != 0 was used as a trick to detect if the  ring of coefficient was not a field, and seems equivalent to 

   cf.type ==  one of n_Z, n_Zm, n_Zmn, n_Z2n

in src/sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_libsingular.pyx
in the gcd and lcm a test has been added so the code is equivalent to the old one.
            if r.cf.type == n_Znm or r.cf.type == n_Zn or r.cf.type == n_Z2m :
                raise NotImplementedError("Division of multivariate polynomials over non fields by n

in interreduced the normalisation of the head coefficient may be never executed and is not equivalent to the old code. So I suggest 2 modification.
either:
   1)  change the doc a dima suggest to do the same as singular and delete the normalisation code
or
   2)  replace the cf.type == n_unknown by  
            if r.cf.type != n_Znm and r.cf.type != n_Zn and r.cf.type != n_Z2m 
       and keep the doc as is

for plural.pyx it should be OK because of the or

But in src/sage/libs/singular/singular.pyx the 2 substitutions gives  strange code:

```

    elif isinstance(base, IntegerModRing_generic):
        if _ring.cf.type == n_unknown:
            return base(_ring.cf.cfInt(n, _ring.cf))
        return si2sa_ZZmod(n, _ring, base)

```

```
    elif isinstance(elem._parent, IntegerModRing_generic):
        if _ring.cf.type == n_unknown:
            return n_Init(int(elem),_ring)
        return sa2si_ZZmod(elem, _ring)

``` 
for instance n_Zp had ringtype == 0
