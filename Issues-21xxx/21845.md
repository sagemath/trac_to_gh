Aside from the main point of the ticket, I made some other small changes: tinkered with `basis_coefficients` to speed it up a little, and also to make it work using either total degree or not, in the multi-graded case. This required adding some ignored keyword arguments to methods like `degree` in the singly graded case -- it was either this or add some try-except clauses of the form

```
try:
   d = blah.degree(total) # multi-graded case
except AppropriateErrorForBadKeyword:
   d = blah.degree()      # singly graded case
```
Just allowing `degree` to always accept "total" as a keyword seemed cleaner.

Bike-shedding: changed "multigraded" to "multi-graded" throughout, just for consistency. (Most of the time it was "multi-graded" already.)

I made some very minor tweaks. If you agree with my changes, then you can set a positive review.
