This ticket is meant to implement a new class of objects: ribbon graphs. These are graphs together with a cyclic ordering of the half edges adjacent to each vertex. This data allows us to unambiguosly "thicken" the  ribbon graph to an orientable surface with boundary.

This will be done by encoding the ribbon graphs in two permutations. As done for example in [Gir] (and many other places). This is also meant to include basic methods of the class to compute:
  
* Genus of the thicekning
* Number of boundary components
* Labeling of the boundary components (see also [Gir])
* A basis of the homology of the graph (and so of the thickening)
    -This base satisfies the condition that each element of the basis is an embedded circle in the graph and contains one (and only one) edge that is not in any other element of the basis.

This is implementation is useful in itself but is also meant to serve as a base for a later implementation of something called "tete-a-tete" graphs which is an original idea by the mathematician Norbert A'Campo [Nor] and has been developed in my thesis. These other graphs model periodic automorphisms of the thickening of the graph.

This will be a nice addition. A few quick comments to help:

- You have a `.directory` file that has gotten mixed in with your commit.
- You should only import things you need, not `sage.all`. From within Sage, you can use `import_statements(foo)` to see the import.
- I've found it helpful to write docstrings (with doctests) as soon as I create a new function/method.

Looking forward to this being ready for review.

That's why there is no docstrings yet and the format is not yet adapted. \n\nThe import sage.all was just to check that the .py file actually compiled :)",

Replying to [tscrim](#comment%3A12):
> This will be a nice addition. A few quick comments to help:
> 
> - You have a `.directory` file that has gotten mixed in with your commit.
> - You should only import things you need, not `sage.all`. From within Sage, you can use `import_statements(foo)` to see the import.
> - I've found it helpful to write docstrings (with doctests) as soon as I create a new function/method.
> 
> Looking forward to this being ready for review.


Thank you for the comments!

Basically I was working on this on my own for doing some computations and somebody told me that this might be useful for other  people, so I decided to collaborate on Sage development. It happens that I had two ".sage" files that were written "for me". So now I am doing all the translation to python + adjusting to developers guide lines. That's why there is no docstrings yet and the format is not yet adapted. 

The import sage.all was just to check that the .py file actually compiled :)

I understand it is overkill for now, but I will open a new ticket shortly depending on this and add a second file. This file will be about the so called tete-a-tete graphs that model automorphisms of surfaces.

I thought it was appropriated but I will revert the changes if it is not. Also I don't know if this fits more in "geometry". ?¿

First of all: thank you! When this is positively reviewed, I have more interesting work to upload on other tickets (related to ribbon graphs)!

I already reverted .gitignore to its original state, thanks for that.

Should I change all imports for lazy imports? Will that do it?

You only need to change the one in `all.py`:

```
from .ribbon_graph import RibbonGraph, make_ribbon
```
as that is the one that gets called on startup (which then subsequently calls the ones in `ribbon_graph.py`).

I did not check all the code, but the following must be done:

* method `_find` should be simplified as follows, where an error is raised if the k is not in the list.

```
for i,lst in enumerate(l):
    if k in lst:
        return [i, lst.index(k)]
raise ValueError("element {} not found".format(k))
```

* method `_clean` should be simplied as `return [copy(elt) for elt in l if len(elt)>0]` 

* Many other simplifications could be done. For instance:
  - `darts_rho = [j for i in range(len(repr_rho)) for j in repr_rho[i]]` is `darts_rho = flatten(repr_rho)`
  - `darts_sigma = flatten(repr_sigma)`

Added.

No, you want the doc in the class-level doc because then it is accessible from the command line `RibbonGraph?`. It is also easy to find in the full doc page as well.

The changes look very good to me. (thank you).

If the other reviewer also agrees, it can be changed to positive_review.

I don't really understand what is a ribbon graph, so it's not easy to comment.
However, it is surprising to have methods for contracting and extruding edges but not a method to list vertices or edges.

Also, the method `bipartite_rib` that is added to the global namespace (I'm not sure it is useful here) should be renamed to e.g., `bipartite_ribbon_graph` or something like that.

A ribbon graph is an object that recovers the topology of a surface with boundary. You can see it as the "spine" (a strong deformation retract) of a surface with boundary. The combinatorial data of a ribbon graph (the two permutations) allow us to unambiguously thicken the graph to a surface with boundary. I think that to people familiar with the mathematical object this implementation is quite natural. 

I'm not on my laptop at the moment but I think that I state that one can look at the cycles that form sigma as the vertices and the cycles that form tho as the edges. The names are chosen sigma and tho because those are used in some texts as well as sigma_0 and sigma_1.

I don't understand what "useful" means in this context but the bipartite_rib function produces a lot of examples of ribbon graphs such that their thickenings (associated surfaces with boundary) are very much used in Singularity theory. In fact they are the building blocks for all Milnor fibers of plane curve singularities. And I will definitely use them on the implementation of tete-a-tete graphs. 

I agree on changing the name as well as the other correction. I will fix them when I get home!

I changed the constructor of `RibbonGraph` to allow access to the bipartite construction so we avoid putting more stuff in the global namespace.

Ribbon graphs also have appeared in the recent preprint https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00061, where they are related to Brauer graph algebras. I'm not entirely convinced that getting a list of edges and vertices is useful with the current implementation.

So, since Pablo says my changes are good, I'm setting this to a positive review. David, if you have any objections, feel free to set back to needs work.
