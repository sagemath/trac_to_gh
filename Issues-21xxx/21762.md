I have my `/bin/sh` symlink pointing to the dash shell (http://gondor.apana.org.au/~herbert/dash/), but ncurses isn't too happy about it.

Here's all it takes to reproduce this:


```
$ sudo ln -sf /bin/dash /bin/sh
$ sage -f ncurses

...

[ncurses-5.9.20131221] make[2]: Entering directory '/home/mjo/src/sage.git/local/var/tmp/sage/build/ncurses-5.9.20131221/src/narrow'
[ncurses-5.9.20131221] Makefile:1: *** recipe commences before first target.  Stop.
```

The full build log is attached.


Component: **build**

This probably got fixed upstream. I still use dash as my /bin/sh, so I'll come find this later and reopen it if I'm wrong.
