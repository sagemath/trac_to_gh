**This task ticket, organizing the steps necessary to eventually provide sagelib via PyPI, has been superseded by Meta-ticket #29705: Modularize sagelib into separate distributions (distutils packages).**

. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .


It would be used by a Python user as follows. Let's assume a user has already installed every package that sage-the-distribution provides on their distribution.
Then a simple

```
pip install sagelib
```
would install sagelib in the user's Python installation. Then the user could do `from sage.all import *`.

. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Here are the first steps:
- #21508: Clean up `src/setup.py` to bring it to standard distutils behavior
  - #21480: Make `sagelib setup.py` self-contained, independent of `SAGE_ROOT`
  - #21600: Use custom build_ext to compile Cython code
  - #21604: Cleaning up stale installed files in setup()
  - #21654: Disentangle cleaning of stale installed files in build directory and in install directory
  - #21516: Fix sagelib sdist (`src/setup.py sdist`)
  - #21535: Make `src/setup.py` respect `--build-base` and `--inplace`, independent of `SAGE_CYTHONIZED`
  - #12659: build the sage library in place
  - #21573: Make sure `src/setup.py` respects `--install-base` and `--root`
  - #21613: Make setup.py not depend on make (follow-up: #22044, #22094, #22106)
  - #22061: Don't hard-code the path to thebe.js (dup: #21527: Fix symbolic link to `thebe.js`)
  - #25546: Install Jupyter kernel in the correct prefix
  - #29041: at `./bootstrap` time, generate `src/requirements.txt`, `src/constraints.txt`, `src/setup.cfg` `[install_requires]` from `build/pkgs`
- #21678: Testsuite `for src/setup.py`
- #21785: Installation of `SAGE_SRC/ext/` in `SAGE_LOCAL/share/sage/ext/` should be done by `setup.py`, not `build/make/Makefile`
- #20108: Use package_data instead of data_files in setup.py
- #21682: Add a separate "cythonize" command to setup.py
- #21569: Install `src/bin/*` scripts via `setup.py` (`scripts`, `console_scripts`)
- #21570: Move non-scripts of `src/bin/` elsewhere (and also move their install location)
- #21571: Install `COPYING.txt` in `SAGE_LOCAL` and use it from `misc/copying.py`
- #21509: Install cython_debug somewhere in SAGE_LOCAL
- #21732: Move runtime documentation python modules into `src/sage`
- #29038: Python package `sage_conf`: Provides optional configuration information for `sagelib`

This defines **milestone 1**. `sagelib` is now a well-behaved Python package. It can be built and installed as follows (without invoking `sage -sh`):

```
export SAGE_LOCAL=/path/to/local/hierarchy/populated/by/sage/distribution
export SAGE_PKGS=/path/to/sage/distribution/source/directory/build/pkgs
$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/python setup.py install   # or pip install . 
```

. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Next steps:
- Remove the dependency on the environment variable SAGE_PKGS (#20382, ...)

This defines **milestone 2**. `sagelib` can now be built and installed as follows (without invoking `sage -sh`):

```
export SAGE_LOCAL=/path/to/local/hierarchy/populated/by/sage/distribution
$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/python setup.py install   # or pip install . 
```

. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Next steps:

- Remove the dependency on the SAGE_LOCAL environment variable
  - #15105: hardwired paths in src/sage
  - #21803: env.py, misc/cython.py: Define and use FLINT_INCLUDE_DIR
  - #29119: Add an autoconf configure script for sagelib
  - ...

This defines **milestone 3**. If SAGE_LOCAL is not set, then sagelib will discover system packages and Python packages installed in standard places. 

```
python setup.py install   # or pip install . 
```
At this point, sagelib will be a standard pip-installable Python source package, ready for upload to PyPI.

Binary packages (using wheels etc.) is beyond the scope of this ticket.

I wonder if this work might not also benefit from adopting portions of [astropy-helpers](https://github.com/astropy/astropy-helpers/tree/master/astropy_helpers) into Sage's build tools.  I don't think it would necessarily be appropriate to use directly--although there's nothing very "astropy" specific in astropy-helpers, a lot of it does assume one is using the astropy project template, or something close to it.  But large swaths of it are very generic, and I put a lot of work into developing tools for build sanity of large Python projects.

Some key features that I think might benefit sage include:

* per-subpackage `setup_package.py` modules, which can contain any number of a [(mostly) well-documented](http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/development/building.html#customizing-setup-build-for-subpackages) hooks for building compiled modules in that sub-package.  This provides a clear and explicit alternative to a monolithic module_list.py (see the discussion [here](https://github.com/cython/cython/pull/466#issuecomment-249185195)), and would also make it easier to break off some of Sage's subpackages into standalone packages should the time ever come for that.
* one of the less-well-documented features is also that `setup_package.py` can contain hooks for setup.py commands.  For example, if a module contains some generated code (a la `sage_setup.autogen`), it can include a `pre_build_ext` hook to make sure the generated code is up to date before running the `./setup.py build_ext` command (either explicitly, or implicitly as a sub-command).  This makes it relatively easy for individual submodules to put hooks into the build process without having to write complicated command subclasses cluttered with subpackage-specific crud.
* smarter handling of Cython modules--for example, when creating a source tarball it will make sure all Cython modules have been Cythonized, and it will include the resulting C/C++ sources in the source tarball.  This ensures that the user does not need Cython to be installed in order to build from source (which is good, because even if they do have Cython it will often be the wrong version--and in Sage's case missing important patches as well).

Those are the main ones for now but I could probably think of more.

> I don't like the phrasing "PyPI package".  There's no such thing as a "PyPI package" per se.  
> Let's be more clear about what we want here--should it be buildable from a source package?  Or are we providing binary wheels?  Both? Neither?


The scope of this ticket is a source package that is pip-installable and would be listed as such on PyPI.

Binary packaging (about which I don't know anything at the moment) is beyond the scope of this ticket.

Sorry, but I don't see how the above is an answer to my question.

...or maybe the problem is that the kernel spec is generated during the *install* phase.

Then the problem is not the fact that it is generated, but *when* it is generated.

Just to make me understand better, what are the commands that you would typically run to install a Python package this way?

that's straight on the file system.
