1. Use `truncate=False` by default in the `str()` method but use `truncate=True` in `__repr__`. For explicit string conversions using the `str()` method, I assume that the user wants full control and doesn't want random truncation to interfere. This can also be seen in the Sage library: there are a lot more places which call `x.str(truncate=False)` than `x.str(truncate=True)`. For normal printing, or conversion to `str`, truncation is still the default.

2. Implement a `x.str(digits=20)` argument to explicitly choose the number of digits for printing a real number.

There's some inconsistency in giving the defaults of arguments:

`(Default: 10)`  vs. `(default:10)` or even just mentioning it
in the text (e.g. for `no_sci`, where the default is `None`),
or in *some* cases also for `truncate`, where the default now is
`False`, but the description says (just) "if `True`, ...".

(But that's a minor thing, as you'd presumably have to touch
more regions to normalize all instances.)


P.S.:  I looked at your previous commit, and just briefly scanned the new one.
