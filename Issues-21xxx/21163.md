Change the implementation of `x.__richcmp__(y, op)` to try `y.__richcmp__(x, revop)` if `y` not a Sage `Element` and coercion fails. In Python terms: if `x.__ge__(y)` fails, try `y.__le__(x)`. This is precisely what Python does when a comparison returns `NotImplemented`.

If this reversed operation is not implemented (either the type does not define comparisons or the comparison returns `NotImplemented`), go on as usual. Because of this, we cannot just return `NotImplemented` in the coercion model, we need to implement the reversing ourselves.

In #20767, the analogous thing was done for arithmetic.
