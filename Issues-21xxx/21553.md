```
The gp function `allocatemem` is automatically attached to the `gen` type in the PARI interface. This permits the following code

```
sage: pari('10^8').allocatemem()
```

However, there is also hand-written support for it in `PariInstance`, which has saner syntax and better messaging:

```
sage: pari.allocatemem(10^8)
PARI stack size set to 100000000 bytes, maximum size set to 2598215680
```

As suggested in #20241, this ticket forbids the first syntax, only leaving the second option.
