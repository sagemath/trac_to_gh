Remind me, why are you pulling `SAGE_ETC` from `sage.misc.misc` rather than `sage.env`? In fact I would like to know if this file is needed at all.

It just write one useful line for `qepcadrc`

```
SINGULAR $expanded_path_to_SAGE_LOCAL/bin
```
If this is the path to singular, unless it is hardcoded to a location by default, it is in the path and therefore not very useful.
