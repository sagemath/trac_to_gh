Remind me, why are you pulling `SAGE_ETC` from `sage.misc.misc` rather than `sage.env`? In fact I would like to know if this file is needed at all.

It just write one useful line for `qepcadrc`

```
SINGULAR $expanded_path_to_SAGE_LOCAL/bin
```
If this is the path to singular, unless it is hardcoded to a location by default, it is in the path and therefore not very useful.

-This is split out from #15105.

 QEPCAD assumes unusual locations for several files, including 
 - `$SAGE_LOCAL/default.qepcadrc` (which would better live in `$SAGE_ETC` (= `$SAGE_LOCAL/etc`)
 - `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/qepcad.help` (which would better live in `$SAGE_LOCAL/share/qepcad`)
 
-The patch (split out from #15105) tried to makes a change regarding the location on the Sage side of things; but QEPCAD itself also would need changing.
+We already use Fedora's patches (https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/qepcad-B/blob/master/f/qepcad-B.spec), which make some changes to qepcad's environment.
 
-That's a bigger project; lots of things about QEPCAD need changing (build system, memory management, ...)
