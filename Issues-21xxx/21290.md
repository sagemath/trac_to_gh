CC:  @videlec

This is needlessly slow because of the additional `isfile()` check:

```
        elif os.path.isfile(package_filename):
            with open(package_filename) as f:
```
Just open the file...

Note: in practice, it does not matter a lot and it does not really speed up `list_packages()`.
