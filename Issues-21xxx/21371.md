```
Clean up Pynac interface in `src/sage/libs/pynac`:

1. A lot of functions have `except +` but don't have any C++ code so they cannot possibly raise C++ exceptions.

2. Drop all useless `object` typing.

3. Correctly declare C++ classes as `cppclass` instead of `struct`.

4. Move the `Some tests for the formal square root of -1.` in `pynac.pyx` to a real docstring.

5. Use `parent()` instead of the deprecated `parent_c()`.

6. Move all imports together instead of scattering them throughout `pynac.pyx`.
