This was just as a step to "needs_work". Sorry for not being as fast as light.

<a id='comment:8'></a>I see you try to avoid some boilerplate by separating the `cmp_deprecation` function.

However, you could simplify a lot more (not tested):

```python
def max_kwds(iterable, **kwds)
    if 'cmp' in kwds:
        deprecation(21043, "the 'cmp' keyword is deprecated, use 'key' instead")
        return max_cmp(iterable, kwds['cmp'])
    return max(iterable, **kwds)

def min_kwds(iterable, **kwds)
    # analogous

def leading_support(self, **kwds):
    return max_kwds(self.support(), **kwds)
```
which is simpler code with less boilerplate. If we ever remove the `cmp` flag, we just need to replace `max_kwds` by `max` and `min_kwds` by `min`.

It would be better to change them directly. But I do not really see the point.

Fine for me!

> But I do not really see the point.


Two points:

1. Less code duplication.

2. Simpler code (by avoiding duplication and using `**kwds` to remove the `if key is not None` branch).
