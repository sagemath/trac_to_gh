Here's a new attempt toward #21537 that is perhaps more elegant.

Let's change `build/bin/sage-spkg` as follows:

- If `spkg-build` exists, call that, followed by `$SAGE_SUDO spkg-install`. 
- Otherwise, just call `spkg-install` (withOUT $SAGE_SUDO). (Such packages cannot be installed into a SAGE_ROOT that is only root-writable, unless they use $SAGE_SUDO themselves.)


The patch changes two example packages, to demonstrate this: `4ti2` and `lcalc`.

Before the patch:

```
$ rm -Rf local/share/4ti2
$ mkdir local/share/4ti2
$ sudo chown root local/share/4ti2
$ ./sage -f 4ti2
[...]
[4ti2-1.6.7] mkdir: /Users/mkoeppe/s/sage/sage-rebasing/local/share/4ti2/doc: Permission denied
[4ti2-1.6.7] make[4]: *** [install-docDATA] Error 1
[...]
$ sudo chown root local/bin/ local/bin/lcalc
$ ./sage -f lcalc 
[...]
[lcalc-1.23.p14] cp -f lcalc /Users/mkoeppe/s/sage/sage-rebasing/local//bin/.
[lcalc-1.23.p14] cp: /Users/mkoeppe/s/sage/sage-rebasing/local//bin/./lcalc: Permission denied
[...] 
```

Then, after the patch:

```
$ export SAGE_SUDO="sudo -E"
$ ./sage -f 4ti2 lcalc  # succeeds
```

Other packages will be handled in follow-up tickets.

So, if I understand correctly, the point of calling `spkg-install` *without* `$SAGE_SUDO` if no `spkg-build` exists, is that for backwards-compatibility such packages should be assumed to be "special" in some way, and have to handle `$SAGE_SUDO` on their own.  Is that correct?
