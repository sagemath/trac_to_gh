Simply saying \"assumed to be only a non-final step in a sequence of several comparison checks.\" is absolutely not clear enough.\n\n3. Using `richcmp` is fine. The problem is *importing* `richcmp` (introducing Python overhead), not calling it.\n\n4. Replace `not(step is None)` by `step is not None`.\n\n5. Replace `richcmp(x, y, Py_EQ)` by `x == y`. Similarly, inside the first `if` branches where you know what `op` is.\n\n6.

1. `elif op in [Py_LT, Py_GT, Py_LE, Py_GE]:` should be optimized to `else`.

2. `richcmp_step` needs better documentation of what it does and how it should be used. Simply saying "assumed to be only a non-final step in a sequence of several comparison checks." is absolutely not clear enough.

3. Using `richcmp` is fine. The problem is *importing* `richcmp` (introducing Python overhead), not calling it.

4. Replace `not(step is None)` by `step is not None`.

5. Replace `richcmp(x, y, Py_EQ)` by `x == y`. Similarly, inside the first `if` branches where you know what `op` is.

6. I still have to check whether your helper function is better/worse/equivalent to my proposal in [#21176 comment:6](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/21176#comment:6)

7. I would prefer to use `NotImplemented` to signal "maybe" instead of `None`.

8. Code like

```
if richcmp(x, y, op):
    return True
else:
    return False
```
could be shorted to `return richcmp(x, y, op)`.

Thanks for the review.

1: Done

2: I have added some documentation, tell me if this is enough.

3: so there is nothing to do, right ?

4: Done

5: Done in all possible places

6: I see several differences: ~~mine compares the (potentially complex) objects at most once except when absolutely needed (yours does this always twice), and has the correct behaviour for NE (not sure about yours for that)~~

**EDIT**: in fact, there is no real difference, maybe. I prefer the logic of mine, but let me think about that.

The object `NotImplemented` is used whenever a comparison function cannot decide what the result of the comparison is. That looks very much like what is needed here.

Let's see what the patchbot says.

One detail: this is not entirely true:

```
OUTPUT: ``True`` or ``False``
```
since rich comparisons are not required to return `True` or `False`. I would be explicit and say something like:

```
OUTPUT: If ``op`` is not ``op_EQ`` or ``op_NE``, the result of ``richcmp(x, y, op)``. If ``op`` is ``op_EQ``, return ``False``. If ``op`` is ``op_NE``, return ``True``.
```
