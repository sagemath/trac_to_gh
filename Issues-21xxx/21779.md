1. `elif op in [Py_LT, Py_GT, Py_LE, Py_GE]:` should be optimized to `else`.

2. `richcmp_step` needs better documentation of what it does and how it should be used. Simply saying "assumed to be only a non-final step in a sequence of several comparison checks." is absolutely not clear enough.

Let's see what the patchbot says.

One detail: this is not entirely true:

```
OUTPUT: ``True`` or ``False``
```
since rich comparisons are not required to return `True` or `False`. I would be explicit and say something like:

```
OUTPUT: If ``op`` is not ``op_EQ`` or ``op_NE``, the result of ``richcmp(x, y, op)``. If ``op`` is ``op_EQ``, return ``False``. If ``op`` is ``op_NE``, return ``True``.
```
