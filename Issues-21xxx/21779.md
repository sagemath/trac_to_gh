ok, I was expecting this answer...

I introduced an helper function, to be used in this kind of situation.

1. `elif op in [Py_LT, Py_GT, Py_LE, Py_GE]:` should be optimized to `else`.

2. `richcmp_step` needs better documentation of what it does and how it should be used. Simply saying "assumed to be only a non-final step in a sequence of several comparison checks." is absolutely not clear enough.

3. Using `richcmp` is fine. The problem is *importing* `richcmp` (introducing Python overhead), not calling it.

8. Code like

```
if richcmp(x, y, op):

Thanks for the review.

1: Done

2: I have added some documentation, tell me if this is enough.

3: so there is nothing to do, right ?

4: Done

5: Done in all possible places

6: I see several differences: ~~mine compares the (potentially complex) objects at most once except when absolutely needed (yours does this always twice), and has the correct behaviour for NE (not sure about yours for that)~~

<a id='comment:29'>Comment 29:</a>
Let's see what the patchbot says.

One detail: this is not entirely true:

```
OUTPUT: ``True`` or ``False``
```
since rich comparisons are not required to return `True` or `False`. I would be explicit and say something like:

```
OUTPUT: If ``op`` is not ``op_EQ`` or ``op_NE``, the result of ``richcmp(x, y, op)``. If ``op`` is ``op_EQ``, return ``False``. If ``op`` is ``op_NE``, return ``True``.
```
