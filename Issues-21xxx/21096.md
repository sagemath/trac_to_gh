LGTM, but I imagined this was intended to speed up parent creation, and I couldn't find an example where it made a measurable difference. Do you have one?

I don't think so. Anyway, this is a relatively old ticket and I don't remember the reason for creating the ticket. Probably it was just an easy fix that I saw.

And by the way, this ugliness

```
from cpython.object cimport PyObject
cdef extern from *:
    PyObject* __pyx_d

(<object>__pyx_d)["debug"] = debug
```
will be better once Cython 0.25 comes out.
