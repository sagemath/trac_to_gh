After merging #17635, some modules were failing to link on Cygwin as first reported [here](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/17635#comment:239).

My testing indicates that this fixes the issue (with thanks to jdemeyer for pointing out `library_order_list`).

Cygwin is the only platform where the linking order of libraries matters that much. I guess linkers on other platforms are more intelligent.
