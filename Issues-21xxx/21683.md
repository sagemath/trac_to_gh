After merging #17635, some modules were failing to link on Cygwin as first reported [here](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/17635#comment:239).

My testing indicates that this fixes the issue (with thanks to jdemeyer for pointing out `library_order_list`).

I mean, I guess as long as it doesn't somehow break things on *other* platforms, though I see no reason it would.
