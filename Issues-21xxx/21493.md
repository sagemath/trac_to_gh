From [#21103 comment:8](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/21103#comment:8):
 What is considered upstream for this package? Should there be an spkg-src? The links in â€‹http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/interfaces/sage/interfaces/rubik.html and in SPKG.txt are broken.

 Why 3 spkgs? It would be enough to make 1 new "upstream" source package with an autotools build  system and put it on [GitHub](../wiki/GitHub). That's better than the current situation, with a fictional upstream source package that only exists on sage mirrors.

Whether 1 or 3 packages, I suggest a fork placed on [GitHub](../wiki/GitHub) to be a good approach, with sage being switched to use the forked project as the upstream.
