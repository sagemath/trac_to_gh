Take more care in passing `NATIVE=on` to NTL's `configure`.

Upstream only checks whether *the compiler accepts the option*, nothing beyond that.

This causes problems if the assembler isn't recent enough to understand all of the instructions GCC emits with `-march=native`, e.g. on older versions of MacOS X (with an ancient GAS as the default assembler), or on older Linux distros where Sage's GCC got built because the native one is outdated (more precisely, not sufficient to build Sage).

While we could (and hopefully will) add more sophisticated checks regarding the assembler's capabilities (or use an alternate one, e.g. clang's/LLVM's on Darwin, cf. #20779), we need a quick (and safe) fix for Sage 7.3.

W.r.t. upstream, thinking more about it I came to the conclusion that it's pretty ok to assume that the parts of the toolchain fit, and for an ordinary user manually running NTL's `configure` it's easy to just pass `NATIVE=off` if something doesn't work.

I tried out version (3) of this patch on OS X version 10.9 (which has the old `as`) and now NTL compiles fine.  So it looks good at my end.  

One very minor quibble with the OS X-specific comment in the spkg-install file:

```
TODO: If we pass '-q', it suddenly becomes LLVM's 'as', which should work.
```

It is true that NTL will compile if you add `-q`, but I wouldn't recommend doing so just for NTL, only Sage as a whole; I've seen weird segfaults when I've tried mixing the two assemblers...

I think (3) is still OK in this regard since it never changes the assembler, but just determines which will be used (and consequently whether we can expect it to work with the `-march=native` flag).

That's nearly dumber than simply disabling `NATIVE`; if NTL took a few seconds (maybe minutes) to build, I'd perhaps agree.  And we cannot be sure it will fail *early*.

Imagine we'd do so for every package, probably trying more than one option.

The part where you are checking version numbers in strings. This `2.2[2-9]*|2.3*)` for example is a very wrong way to test for a version number >= 2.22. But even if you fix that, you still have to "parse" the output of `as --version` correctly.

Show me a system where GAS 2.3 is used (and Sage at least partially builds)...

(Fixed that though.)

\\

> But even if you fix that, you still have to "parse" the output of `as --version` correctly.

If it contains `LLVM`, it's LLVM's `as`, certainly not GAS at least, and completely sufficient *here*.

If you instead meant to refer to `as -v`,

```sh
        GAS_VERSION=$( ${AS:-as} -v </dev/null -o /dev/null 2>&1 \
            | sed  -n '/GNU assembler/s/^.* \([12]\.[^ ][^ ]*\).*$/\1/p' )
```
works for all versions I encountered in this context (namely, Sage).  This is `spkg-install`, not `configure.ac`.  (Note that GAS doesn't support anything like `-dumpversion`, and distro packagers mess up what vanilla GAS gives.)

\\

And, again repeating myself, I'm not going to mess with Darwin and Xcode versions here, that belongs elsewhere.  (You may have noticed that I do not even check whether we're on Darwin if GAS is 1.38 or LLVM's assembler is present, because that's far beyond what we need here.

> On the other hand, I actually intended to add proper feature checks (for each "non-standard" ISA extension enabled by `-march=native`, which of course is a moving target), probably also with some runtime checks (actually *executing* instructions), because what CPUID reports isn't always correct (and hence GCC could be "wrong" as well), be it a crippled *and* flawed Intel chip, or a VM bug.

Looking deeper into NTL's configure process (I haven't done for a while), there's certainly room for improvements, i.e., changes we could submit upstream in the long run.

While there are tests for AVX, AVX2 and `__builtin_clzl()` actually running test code (implicitly testing the toolchain), the test program (which gets compiled *and* linked, but currently not run) for `CXXAUTOFLAGS` (which include `-march=native` if `NATIVE=on`) is the following:

```C
int main() { return 0; }
```
I think it's *unlikely* that GCC will generate code containing *any* ISA extension instructions for this, so the assembler won't complain there (and the program -- as is -- is likely to run without errors on *any* machine with the same [generic] architecture, not only on those with the specific one GCC *thinks* is the native).

Fixing the configure tests would be the best solution, but for now we should probably ship this workaround.

Replying to [@vbraun](#comment:22):
> Fixing the configure tests would be the best solution, but for now we should probably ship this workaround.

Yep.  Unfortunately NTL doesn't have the usual `configure && make` structure; `configure` calls a Perl script which generates (and continually rewrites) a makefile (and indirectly config files) which is then again called (`make -f ...`) from the script to perform some tests.

The "final" makefile then first builds kind of another configure chain and runs that before building the library; there, some tests simply happen "too late" (as building the tools may already fail).

(This is similar to a shell script which first tests features of the shell it is run with, but, when run with the wrong shell, already bails out with a syntax error when performing the tests supposed to avoid exactly that.)

So it's not easy to submit anything useful / acceptable upstream (without completely rewriting the above, or being too specific and probably kind of redundant in just fixing our problem which is rather uncommon).
