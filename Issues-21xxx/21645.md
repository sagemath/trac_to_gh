`sum(ex,...)` always gets sent to `calculus.symbolic_sum()` where Maxima is called. If unevaluated an anonymous function `sum` is returned.

```
sage: ex=sum(gamma(n), n,1,a)
sage: ex.operator()
sum
sage: type(_)
<class 'sage.symbolic.function_factory.NewSymbolicFunction'>
```

This is unsatisfactory in many regards. Calls always go through Maxima, even if one wants just a sum expression held unevaluated. Also the anonymous function cannot be evaluated or substituted. For these reasons making a full symbolic sum function is a natural decision.

<a id='comment:6'></a>Looking at the patch, I see presently special work happens on maxima's return values, which replaces maxima's "inert" sum with sage's newly grown symbolic sum function. I think that's problematic (for instance, we could have nested sums, and the nested sums would escape this treatment). Also, the test used (`isinstance(op,SymbolicFunction)`) is a little suspicious: I think it would get the result from

```
sum(f(x),n,0,0)

wrong.

It should be possible to use the standard SR-to-maxima and maxima-to-SR translation dictionaries for this, just as functions like sin etc. get properly translated. Isn't the line

```
+        BuiltinFunction.__init__(self, "sum", nargs=4,
+                               conversions=dict(maxima='sum'))
```
already enough to get the required automatic translations? If not, perhaps there is a manual override somewhere else that needs to be *removed* to let the normal translation take its course?
