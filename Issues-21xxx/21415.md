Something like this for docstring?

```
    """
    Return an iterator over orientations of the graph.
    
    An *orientation* of an undirected graph is a directed
    graph such that every edge is assigned a direction.
    Hence there are `2^s` oriented digraphs for a graph
    with `s` edges.
    
    EXAMPLES::
        
        sage: G = Graph([[1,2,3], [(1, 2, 'a'), (1, 3, 'b')]], format='vertices_and_edges')
        sage: it = G.all_orientations()
        sage: D = it.next()
        sage: D.edges()  # Random order for orientations
        [(1, 2, 'a'), (1, 3, 'b')]
        sage: D = it.next()
        sage: D.edges()  # Random order for orientations
        [(2, 1, 'a'), (1, 3, 'b')]
    
    TESTS::
        
        sage: G = Graph()
        sage: G_ = [g for g in G.all_orientations()]
        sage: len(G_)
        1
        sage: G_[0]
        Digraph on 0 vertices
        
        sage: G = Graph(5)
        sage: it = G.all_orientations()
        sage: G_ = next(it)
        sage: G_.size()
        0
    """
```

Should the name be `all_orientations()` or just `orientations()`?

Also, we may have an option to iterate over a random ordering of the orientations, for instance using this simple trick
`E = [[(u,v,l), (v,u,l)] if randint(0,1) else [(v,u,l), (u,v,l)]   for u,v,l in G.edges()]`

I would say Python is not switching to more iterator style per-se, but having default behavior that is more practical for the typical programming purpose.

I put the code into a branch, taking some from the ask answer, and kept only an iterator because of how big is does get.

- `implementation` is missing from the `INPUT` block.

- "optional" at documentation of parameter `sparse` is strange, and `data_structure` does not have it; that is inconsistent.

- Spaces in the line after one-line description (and that makes index of functions quite bad).

- Is it meaningful to copy name of original graph? Sounds strange to have a directed Petersen graph.

Otherwise it seems to work, attributes for allowing loops and/or multiedges works and so on.

This is not included in *any* documentation. I am following suit.

`sparse` is there as a shorthand for (the necessary) `data_structure`, so it is optional.

Will fix.

Should we add "directed" to the front of the name or just drop it altogether? I don't have a preference on this.

I will also add tests for non-simple graphs.

I do not understand. Both parameters are optional, as both have a default value. But whatever, won't block me from giving review.

No, not "directed". Maybe "An orientation of ..." or nothing. I can't say either.

OK. I can review this.

How I see it, `data_structure` is necessary, even though it has a default value, but `sparse` is not.

I added "An orientation of" when a name is specified.

I've addressed all of the mentioned issues.

Seems good and tests passed, documentation builds etc.

But only now, when you added a test for multigraphs, I really thinked about this; sorry about being late. What about orientations of `Graph({1: [2, 2]}, multiedges=True)`? The code gives 4, but only 3 different. Same applies to graphs with loops.

I don't know how we should address this. But at a minimun this should be documented.
