Here is some code that does it:

```sage
def all_orientations(G):
    from itertools import product
    E = [[(u,v,label), (v,u,label)] for u,v,label in G.edges()]

Seems reasonable. So this needs just definition, examples and so on. The graph may not have multiple edges nor loops, but it can have weight (or other labels) assigned to edges.

I can see no easy way to optimize this, `product` already does what is possible.

Something like this for docstring?

```
    """
    Return an iterator over orientations of the graph.
    
    An *orientation* of an undirected graph is a directed
    graph such that every edge is assigned a direction.
    Hence there are `2^s` oriented digraphs for a graph
    with `s` edges.
    
    EXAMPLES::
        
        sage: G = Graph([[1,2,3], [(1, 2, 'a'), (1, 3, 'b')]], format='vertices_and_edges')
        sage: it = G.all_orientations()
        sage: D = it.next()
        sage: D.edges()  # Random order for orientations
        [(1, 2, 'a'), (1, 3, 'b')]
        sage: D = it.next()
        sage: D.edges()  # Random order for orientations
        [(2, 1, 'a'), (1, 3, 'b')]
    
    TESTS::
        
        sage: G = Graph()
        sage: G_ = [g for g in G.all_orientations()]
        sage: len(G_)
        1
        sage: G_[0]
        Digraph on 0 vertices
        
        sage: G = Graph(5)
        sage: it = G.all_orientations()
        sage: G_ = next(it)
        sage: G_.size()
        0
    """
```

Should the name be `all_orientations()` or just `orientations()`?

I would say Python is not switching to more iterator style per-se, but having default behavior that is more practical for the typical programming purpose.

I put the code into a branch, taking some from the ask answer, and kept only an iterator because of how big is does get.

- `implementation` is missing from the `INPUT` block.

- "optional" at documentation of parameter `sparse` is strange, and `data_structure` does not have it; that is inconsistent.

- Spaces in the line after one-line description (and that makes index of functions quite bad).

- Is it meaningful to copy name of original graph? Sounds strange to have a directed Petersen graph.

Otherwise it seems to work, attributes for allowing loops and/or multiedges works and so on.

This is not included in *any* documentation. I am following suit.

> - "optional" at documentation of parameter `sparse` is strange, and `data_structure` does not have it; that is inconsistent.


`sparse` is there as a shorthand for (the necessary) `data_structure`, so it is optional.

> - Spaces in the line after one-line description (and that makes index of functions quite bad).


Will fix.

> - Is it meaningful to copy name of original graph? Sounds strange to have a directed Petersen graph.


Should we add "directed" to the front of the name or just drop it altogether? I don't have a preference on this.

> Otherwise it seems to work, attributes for allowing loops and/or multiedges works and so on.


I will also add tests for non-simple graphs.

OK.

I do not understand. Both parameters are optional, as both have a default value. But whatever, won't block me from giving review.

No, not "directed". Maybe "An orientation of ..." or nothing. I can't say either.

OK. I can review this.

How I see it, `data_structure` is necessary, even though it has a default value, but `sparse` is not.

I added "An orientation of" when a name is specified.

I've addressed all of the mentioned issues.

Seems good and tests passed, documentation builds etc.

But only now, when you added a test for multigraphs, I really thinked about this; sorry about being late. What about orientations of `Graph({1: [2, 2]}, multiedges=True)`? The code gives 4, but only 3 different. Same applies to graphs with loops.

I don't know how we should address this. But at a minimun this should be documented.
