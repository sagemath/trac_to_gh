Since the `PariInstance` object is really just a callable namespace without state, it should be possible to create multiple instances of it.

The rationale for this is that when multiple python modules depend upon CyPari, each one must instantiate its own `PariInstance` object, or possibly an object inheriting from it.

Since `PariInstance` initializes the PARI library upon `__init__`, we must be careful to do this initialization only once.

When `PariInstance.__init__()` is called a second time with a `size` argument which is larger than the current size, we should increase (but never decrease) the PARI stack size but otherwise do nothing.

Note that an alternate, reasonable, design would initialize the PARI library at module load, rather than in `__init__`. However this ticket is not concerned with this.

With the current design, we have the (dubious) advantage of being able to call `pari_close()` (via `PariInstance._close()`, and then reinitialize PARI by creating a new `PariInstance` object at leisure.
