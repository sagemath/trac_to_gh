Hello,

Thank you for adding this.

Here `n` is not the order of the CCC but the dimension. The order of CCC(n) is `d*2^d` (You could mention it in the documentation).
I suggest to replace `n` with `d` to avoid confusion with the order.


Use `<` instead of `\lt`. As you can see in the documentation displayed in a terminal, `\lt` is replaced with `lt`, which is not nice. Also, you can avoid using `\lfloor...\rfloor` and give directly the value for `n` even and `n` odd. I don't know what to do with the `oplus`. Actually I don't knwo what you mean by `x oplus 2^y`.

```
sage: G = graphs.CubeConnectedCycle?
Signature:      graphs.CubeConnectedCycle(n)
Docstring:     
   Returns the cube-connected cycle of order n.

   The cube-connected cycle of order n is the n-dimensional hypercube
   with each of its vertices replaced by a cycle of length n. The
   construction is as follows: Construct vertex (x,y) for 0 <= x lt
   2^n, 0 <= y lt n. For each vertex, (x,y), add an edge between it
   and (x, (y-1) mod n)), (x,(y+1) mod n), and (x oplus 2^y, y)

   INPUT:

      * "n" -- The dimension of the desired hypercube as well as the
        length of the cycle to be placed at each vertex of the
        n-dimensional hypercube. n must be a positive integer.

   EXAMPLES:

   The diameter of cube-connected cycles for n gt 3 is 2n+ lfloor
   frac{n}{2} rfloor -2

      sage: g = graphs.CubeConnectedCycle(9)
      sage: g.diameter()
      20

   All vertices have degree 3 when n gt 1

      sage: g = graphs.CubeConnectedCycle(12)
      sage: all(g.degree(v) == 3 for v in g)
      True
```

For the last example, observe that CCC(2) is a cycle of order 8, and so all vertices have degree 2.

The error message could be changed to `greater than 0`.

Best,
David.

PS: switch the ticket to need review when ready. It is still as new...

Hi, thanks for the comments.

I will add the suggested items. \oplus is for the bitwise xor operation. I am not sure the best way to have that in the docs? Maybe just `^`?

Some other comments:
* `order `d2^d`.` -> ` order `d\times 2^d`.` or `.` or `\cdot`. It will be nicer
* in the examples, you could change `sage: len(g)` with `sage: len(g)==d*2**d` and the expected result to `True`.
* `All vertices have degree `3` when `d > 1` ::` -> `All vertices have degree `3` when `d > 2` ::`


You are lucky that the `^` operator is working well here. I have different behavior when using the command line...

```
sage: G = graphs.CubeConnectedCycle(3)
sage: print G.vertices()
[(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 2)]
sage: def toto(d):
....:     G = Graph(name="Cube-Connected Cycle of dimension {}".format(d))

....:         G.add_edge((x, y), (x, (y-1)%d))
....:         G.add_edge((x, y), (x^pow(2, y), y))
....:     return G
....: 
sage: print toto(3).vertices()
[(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 2), (9, 1), (16, 1), (16, 2), (25, 1), (36, 1), (49, 1), (81, 2), (256, 2), (625, 2), (1296, 2), (2401, 2)]
sage: G.is_isomorphic(toto(3))
False
```
I don't know how to prevent such problem.

<a id='comment:18'></a>
Your construction does not follow the wolfram definition where `CCC(1)` has loops and `CCC(2)` has multiple (parallel) edges.

```
sage: graphs.CubeConnectedCycle(1).has_loops()
False
sage: graphs.CubeConnectedCycle(2).allows_multiple_edges()
False
```
So either you add necessary cases to strictly follow the wolfram definition, or you follow the usual assumption in graph theory that `CCC(1)` is an edge and so vertices have degree 1, and `CCC(2)` is a cycle of order 8 and so its vertices have degree 2.

If you check the original paper by Preparata and Vuillemin in 1981 http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=358660, you will see that the definition is slightly different and more general (extra vertices can be added).
If you remind me, I can check on Monday in reference books such as `J. de Rumeur, Communication dans les réseaux de processeurs, Masson, 1994` and others.


I realize that there is an error in your code with `d=1` due to `%1` since `1%1==2%1==0`. Furthermore, the test is not good since all vertices have by definition degree less than 3.

```
sage: g = graphs.CubeConnectedCycle(1)
sage: any(g.degree(v) < 3 for v in g)
True
sage: g.edges()
[]
sage: g.vertices()
[(0, 0), (1, 0)]

In your code, some edges are added twice. A simple method to avoid that is as follows:

```
    if d<1:
        raise ValueError('d must be greater than 0.')

    G = Graph(name="Cube-Connected Cycle of dimension {}".format(d))

    for  x in range(1<<d):
        G.add_cycle( [(x, y) for y in range(d)] )

    for x, y in G.vertices():
        G.add_edge((x, y), (x^(1<<y), y))

    return G
```
The `1<<y` are just minor improvements.

I also had issues with 7.4-beta4 (#21482), and it took me a lot of compilations to test te patch...

Concerning this ticket, we all make small mistakes. That's why the reviewing process is so important (ok, some times it's really boring).

We are almost done with this ticket. We mostly have to ensure that the definition fits the code and vice-et-versa ;)

I'm sorry you had difficulties installing/updating sage.

I have several comments. Let's start with the easiest one:
- `Returns the cube-connected cycle of dimension `d`.` -> `Return the cube-connected cycle of dimension `d`.`
- Instead of `<=`, you can use `\leq`. It will be much nicer.

In the examples:
- `sage: d = 10` this is large. In general we try to have quick tests since there are many many tests in Sagemath. `d = 3` could be enough, non?
- `sage: d = 9`. again, 4 is large enough.
- `sage: g = graphs.CubeConnectedCycle(12)` is clearly too large. 3 is enough here.

In the code:
- `if d<1:` -> `if d < 1:`
- `ValueError('d must be greater than 0.')` -> `ValueError('the dimension d must be greater than 0')` without `.` at the end. Change the test accordingly.


Now, there is something wrong with the way you handle the case `d == 1` and `d == 2`. If I use your code, I get:

```
sage: G = graphs.CubeConnectedCycle(1)
sage: G.edges()
[((0, 0), (0, 0), None), ((0, 0), (1, 0), None), ((1, 0), (1, 0), None)]
sage: G.has_loops()
False
sage: G.loops()
[]
sage: G = graphs.CubeConnectedCycle(2)
sage: G.edges(labels=0)

[((0, 0), (0, 1)),
 ((0, 0), (0, 1)),
 ((0, 0), (1, 0)),
 ((0, 1), (2, 1)),
 ((1, 0), (1, 1)),
 ((1, 0), (1, 1)),
 ((1, 1), (3, 1)),
 ((2, 0), (2, 1)),
 ((2, 0), (2, 1)),
 ((2, 0), (3, 0)),
 ((3, 0), (3, 1)),
 ((3, 0), (3, 1))]
sage: G.has_multiple_edges()
False
```
Could you tell me what you expect `CCC(1)` and `CCC(2)` to be ?


Also, I'm not able to build the documentation. I got:

```
OSError: [graphs   ] /Users/dcoudert/sage/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/graphs/graph_generators.py:docstring of sage.graphs.graph_generators.GraphGenerators.CubeConnectedCycle:33: WARNING: Unexpected indentation.
```
I suspect it is due to the line `The construction is as follows:`. Can you check ?

All these are only minor issues that can easily be fixed. Almost done !

According to Wikipedia [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cube-connected_cycles#Definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cube-connected_cycles#Definition).
In CCC(d), each node (x,y) should have `(x,(y+1)mod d) , (x,(y-1)mod d) and (x XOR 2^y, y)` has its neighbor( or adjacent vertices)

CCC(1) can be one of the following:

1).Graph with edges: `[((0, 0), (0, 0)), ((0, 0), (0, 1)), ((0, 1), (0, 1))]` if we dont consider a vertex to be its own neighbor unless there is a self loop.

2). A simple Graph with an edge: `[((0, 0), (1, 0))]`, If we consider a vertex to be its own neighbor as mentioned in following link [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/GraphNeighborhood.html](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/GraphNeighborhood.html)

CCC(2) should be\\
Simple Graph with edges: `[((0, 0), (0, 1)), ((0, 0), (1, 0)), ((0, 1), (2, 1)), ((1, 0), (1, 1)), ((1, 1), (3, 1)), ((2, 0), (2, 1)), ((2, 0), (3, 0)), ((3, 0), (3, 1))]`

Code works fine for CCC(d>3).

`@`docoudert: Can you guide me here?

There is still one ambiguity for CCC(2). It can have following edge set according to diagram or definition of CCC(2) in Wolfram :\\
1) `[((0, 0), (0, 1)), ((0, 0), (1, 0)), ((0, 0), (1, 0)), ((0, 1), (2, 1)), ((0, 1), (2, 1)), ((1, 0), (1, 1)), ((1, 1), (3, 1)), ((1, 1), (3, 1)), ((2, 0), (2, 1)), ((2, 0), (3, 0)), ((2, 0), (3, 0)), ((3, 0), (3, 1))]`

or

2) `[((0, 0), (0, 1)), ((0, 0), (0, 1)), ((0, 0), (1, 0)), ((0, 1), (2, 1)), ((1, 0), (1, 1)), ((1, 0), (1, 1)), ((1, 1), (3, 1)), ((2, 0), (2, 1)), ((2, 0), (2, 1)), ((2, 0), (3, 0)), ((3, 0), (3, 1)), ((3, 0), (3, 1))]`

Both cases satisfy the condition given.

But sticking to this definition given in[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Cube-ConnectedCycleGraph.html](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Cube-ConnectedCycleGraph.html) The cube-connected cycle graph of order n is the graph obtained by replacing each vertex in a n-dimensional hypercube by a cycle of length n.

Option (2) of comment 32 fits well because each node in hypergraph is replaced by cycle whose x is fixed and that pattern is also followed in all CCC(d>=3).
