Currently the scripts in `src/bin` are installed by `build/make/Makefile`.

As part of #21507, for those scripts that should be considered part of `sagelib`, the installation should be done by `src/setup.py` instead, using the [scripts and console-scripts](http://python-packaging.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command-line-scripts.html) features.

(Example, [ticket:21507#comment:14 received from was]: ​https://github.com/sagemathinc/smc/tree/master/src/smc_pyutil. See, in particular, the console_scripts section of setup.py: ​https://github.com/sagemathinc/smc/blob/master/src/smc_pyutil/setup.py#L58)

(Those scripts that don't belong into `src/bin` are moved to `build/bin` by #21559.
See also:  #21570: Move non-scripts of `src/bin/` elsewhere (and also move their install location; #21707: Split sage-env into sage-build-env and sage-env)

In #22731 comment 28, it is proposed to move scripts to `$SAGE_LOCAL/libexec`.
Could a setuptools expert comment whether `setup.sh` would be able to do this, or can it only install into `bin` (via the `scripts` and `console_scripts` features)?
