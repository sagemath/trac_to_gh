```
This trivial patch will speed up computation of meet matrix in lattices. Before:

```
sage: P = Posets.BooleanLattice(10)
sage: timeit("_ = P._hasse_diagram._meet", repeat=1, number=1)
1 loops, best of 1: 2.24 s per loop
```

After:

```
sage: P = Posets.BooleanLattice(10)
sage: timeit("_ = P._hasse_diagram._meet", repeat=1, number=1)
1 loops, best of 1: 917 ms per loop
```

And for small lattices:

```
sage: P10 = [P.with_bounds() for P in Posets(8)]
sage: timeit("len([P for P in P10 if P.is_meet_semilattice()])", repeat=1, number=1)
```

Without this patch it took 5.46 seconds, after the patch 1.54 seconds.

I have some questions:

I do not understand the comment `# T = {x_i \wedge z : z>-x_k`}
What is the meaning of `>-` ?

Does lc stands for "lower covers" ? if yes, that would be worth to say in a comment

Could you take the opportunity to make the method fully pep8 compliant ? only the line

```
raise ValueError("No meet for x=%s y=%s"%(x,y))
```
must be changed to

```
raise ValueError("No meet for x=%s y=%s" % (x, y))
```

It is very hard to think an example where my code would be slower. This references to a python dict, whereas current code references to a matrix; referencing to matrix elements in a loop is slow. And that matrix must be precomputed first. You can test what happens if you compute le-matrix first (assuming that the user has, say, computed Möbius function matrix), but there will still be speedup.

I added another example to description.

Changed. Then there is the error message formatting question... Python exceptions start with lowercase and do not end to a period. But this has been discussed in sage-devel without clear conclusion.

I guess it has meant covering. I removed it.
