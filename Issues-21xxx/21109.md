This trivial patch will speed up computation of meet matrix in lattices. Before:

```
sage: P = Posets.BooleanLattice(10)
sage: timeit("_ = P._hasse_diagram._meet", repeat=1, number=1)
1 loops, best of 1: 2.24 s per loop
```

After:

```
sage: P = Posets.BooleanLattice(10)
sage: timeit("_ = P._hasse_diagram._meet", repeat=1, number=1)
1 loops, best of 1: 917 ms per loop
```

And for small lattices:

```
sage: P10 = [P.with_bounds() for P in Posets(8)]
sage: timeit("len([P for P in P10 if P.is_meet_semilattice()])", repeat=1, number=1)
```

Without this patch it took 5.46 seconds, after the patch 1.54 seconds.

<a id='comment:3'></a>
I have some questions:

I do not understand the comment `# T = {x_i \wedge z : z>-x_k`}
What is the meaning of `>-` ?

Does lc stands for "lower covers" ? if yes, that would be worth to say in a comment

Could you take the opportunity to make the method fully pep8 compliant ? only the line

```
raise ValueError("No meet for x=%s y=%s"%(x,y))
```
must be changed to

```
raise ValueError("No meet for x=%s y=%s" % (x, y))
```

Have you run tests on smaller and larger lattices? Does the about 2x speedup still hold in those cases?

It is very hard to think an example where my code would be slower. This references to a python dict, whereas current code references to a matrix; referencing to matrix elements in a loop is slow. And that matrix must be precomputed first. You can test what happens if you compute le-matrix first (assuming that the user has, say, computed Möbius function matrix), but there will still be speedup.

I added another example to description.

Changed. Then there is the error message formatting question... Python exceptions start with lowercase and do not end to a period. But this has been discussed in sage-devel without clear conclusion.

I guess it has meant covering. I removed it.

> Does lc stands for "lower covers" ? if yes, that would be worth to say in a comment

Done.
