<a id='comment:12'></a>specialization seems to be giving strange errors. 
- when you also specialize x or y below it's fine, but if not we have the following:

```
S.<a,b> = PolynomialRing(QQ)
P.<x,y,z> = PolynomialRing(S)
R.<c,d> = PolynomialRing(P)
f = a*x^2+b*y^3+c*y^2-b*a*d+d^2-a*c*b*z^2
f.specialization(dict({a:2, z:4, d:2}))

Traceback (click to the left of this block for traceback)
...
TypeError: unable to convert x to an element of Univariate Polynomial
Ring in c over Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y over Univariate
Polynomial Ring in b over Rational Field

Doesn't distinguish between Multivariate and Univariate, also has this problem in Subschemes.

```
R.<l> = PolynomialRing(QQ)
S.<k,j> = PolynomialRing(R)
K.<a,b,c,d> = S[]

H = End(P)

Doesn't like having four variables.

**Questions:**
Should the two examples below work?

```
S.<p,q> = QQ[]
A.<r> = AffineSpace(S,1)
F = (r^2 + p*r^2)/(q+p)
G=F.specialization({p:42})
```

```
A.<i,j,k> = QuaternionAlgebra(QQ, -1,-1)
R.<w,v> = PolynomialRing(A)
F = w^3 + (i+j)*w + 1
G=F.specialization({w:7})
