<a id='comment:24'></a>**Errors:**

```
R.<l> = PolynomialRing(QQ,1)
S.<k,j> = PolynomialRing(R)
K.<a> = PolynomialRing(S,1)
J.<x,y> = PolynomialRing(K)
F = x^2 + y^2
G=F.specialization({y:56,j:5})
print G
G.parent()
``` 
Doesn't distinguish between Multivariate and Univariate, also has this problem in Subschemes.

```
R.<l> = PolynomialRing(QQ)
S.<k,j> = PolynomialRing(R)
K.<a,b,c,d> = S[]
P.<x,y> = ProjectiveSpace(K, 1)
H = End(P)
Q=P([a^2,b^2])
Q.specialization({a:2})
```
Doesn't like having four variables.

**Questions:**
Should the two examples below work?

```
S.<p,q> = QQ[]
A.<r> = AffineSpace(S,1)
F = (r^2 + p*r^2)/(q+p)
G=F.specialization({p:42})
```

```
A.<i,j,k> = QuaternionAlgebra(QQ, -1,-1)
R.<w,v> = PolynomialRing(A)
F = w^3 + (i+j)*w + 1
G=F.specialization({w:7})
```
