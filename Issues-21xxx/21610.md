We should try to fix these warnings:

```
warning: -jN forced in submake: disabling jobserver mode.
```

There are 3 different issues:

1. The warnings appears several times at the top-level (not inside a package build) and during the build of the Sage library. This can probably be fixed by moving this snippet from `sage-env` higher up:

```sh
# If MAKEFLAGS exists, assume it got set by make.
# Therefore, remove all flags from $MAKE
if [ "${MAKEFLAGS-__unset__}" != "__unset__" ]; then
    MAKE=`echo "$MAKE" | sed 's/ .*//'`
fi
export MAKE
```

2. For several packages, the warning correctly appears because we explicitly force `-j1` (presumably to fix parallel build issues):
- `brial`
- `gap`
- `pari`
- `pkgconf`
- `python2`
- `singular`
- `zeromq`

3. Other packages where this warnings appears:
- `openblas`: no idea where it comes from, probably the `openblas` build system itself.

The `make -jNUM` command can only work properly if you use `make` for everything. In Sage, we don't use `make` for all Python-related builds, in particular the build of the Sage library and the documentation. For this, we actually look at the environment variable `MAKE`. So this proposal just doesn't work.

I am adjusting the ticket issue.

OK, would this mean that it's just an unfortunate choice of the name for this variable?
So if we renamed it to something it would also fix these warnings, etc?

No, because it also serves as `MAKE` variable.

I think that we can fix the warnings without changing the variable name.

I've had this same thought before--really we should not be passing down `MAKE=make -jN` to sub-makes.

The problem is that for Sage's build it's being used for cross-purposes.  For packages that use make we want them to be able to take advantage of parallel builds (but jobserver mode is disabled that means the number of jobs started by make can actually well overtake `N`).  But at the same time we want to take advantage of it for Sage to build multiple packages simultaneously.

This statement is wrong. In Sage, parallel `make` works for packages using `make`. The problem is the parts of the build which do not use `make`, in particular the build of the Sage library and documentation.

How about this:

```
$ cat Makefile 
all: opts

opts:
	@echo $(MAKEFLAGS)
```
Now:

```
$ make -j10
-j10 --jobserver-auth=3,4
```
That is, you can parse top-level MAKEFLAGS and get the value you need.

mine is 4.2.1. Well, a bug in `make`...
In 3.81 it is `--jobserver-fds=3,4 -j` So they tried to fix it ;-)

Not really because we are talking about the user running the system `make`.

What we *could* do is try to support both mechanisms: for users running a recent enough version of `make`, we could support `make -j10`.
