There are a couple of things which can (and should) be improved:

* `configure` doesn't contain any check for `python` (and its version), despite Sage meanwhile requiring a *system* python to build (until one of Sage's python packages has been built).  This is a critical defect on its own, but as we've been living with that since Sage 6.7 IIRC, I haven't made this issue a blocker.  (`sage-download-file` or `sage-uncompress-spkg` simply *won't run* if there's *not any* `python` in the PATH, but we cannot be sure they'll work properly with some random version.)

* The checks for Xcode on Darwin (MacOS X) are presumably outdated, and `configure` eventually only gives warnings or hints.  (We should probably also check or deduce whether Xcode's default assembler is still Apple's ancient fork of the GNU assembler, which has major deficiencies, and install a wrapper script `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/as` which invokes LLVM's more recent assembler in that case.  Then the GCC package won't have to deal with that, which it currently doesn't anyway, potentially leading to build errors caused by the assembler not supporting the instructions Sage's GCC emits.  The latter can also happen on (older) Linux distros when Sage's GCC gets built, though, so something not Darwin-specific should be added to GCC's spkg-install, too.)

* The list of all Sage packages dumped near the end of `configure` lets any warning messages given earlier drown, so it's less likely people will notice them.  We could collect at least important warnings in order to give (or repeat) them at the end (a `configure` "summary" would IMHO be good anyway), and/or print more than one package name per line.

* Exclude "dummy packages" (which are only built on a few systems) like iconv:

```sh
# Only build iconv on Solaris, HP-UX and Cygwin. See
#     https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/8567 and
#     https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/9603
# for details.

case "$UNAME" in
CYGWIN|HP-UX|SunOS)
    ...
*)  # Not CYGWIN, HP-UX or SunOS (Solaris)
    echo "iconv will not be installed, as we only need to build it on"
    echo "Solaris, HP-UX and Cygwin, as the system's iconv will be used"
    echo "on other platforms, rather than the one shipped with Sage."
    echo "See:"
    echo "    https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/8567"
    echo "    https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/9603"
    exit 0
esac
```
  and Cephes:

```sh
if [ "$UNAME" != "FreeBSD" ]; then
    echo "We only install the cephes library on FreeBSD."
    exit 0
fi
```
etc. from the build when appropriate (i.e., set corresponding variables in the generated `Makefile` according to the platform).  We may in addition add checks for e.g. iconv instead, where easily `need_to_install_FOO` could be set.  (But then e.g. iconv's `spkg-install` should probably get rewritten as well, to not decide on installation of the package there [again].)  

* ... (There are quite certainly other things which could be improved.)

* Related (but also affects the `Makefile` / `deps` and many `dependencies` files of packages): \\
  Reintroducing the abuse of `PYTHON` (letting it point to `local/var/lib/sage/installed/python*` and letting `make` export it) was a bad idea; if it is set, upstream packages expect it to point to the Python interpreter, and explicitly unsetting it again in `spkg-install` scripts is a mess.

Regarding a wrapper script for the assembler on Darwin, see also #20779 (around [comment:ticket:20779:34 comment 34]).

Also *there* is some reasoning about Darwin versions and Xcode versions ([comment:ticket:20779:49 comment 49 ff.]); in some cases we may want to **require** a newer version of Xcode, provided there's one available for the given Darwin version (for example Xcode 7.3 or later on El Capitan / MacOS X 10.11, which is not available for earlier versions of MacOS X).

I am experimenting with FreeBSD 11.0, and there cephes nukes the Sage build.
