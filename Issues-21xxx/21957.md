This is a followup to #21848 on the more specific issue that Singular does not build shared libraries on Windows.

I think this was a problem even before Singular 4, but it didn't specifically cause any problems in testing.

Depends on #22425

Keywords: **singular cygwin windows**

Here are some patches to Singular based on the current version of my upstream PR.  This works for me, and shouldn't break anything on any other platforms, so I'd like to move forward with it regardless what the eventual upstream solution is.  Right now this is one of the biggest blockers on Cygwin.
