sage: factorial(-5)
...
ValueError: factorial -- self = (-5) must be nonnegative
```

Adapt the function's behaviour to what other CASs (sympy, Wolfram) do at integer n<-1: return unsigned infinity.

Note that already

```
sage: SR(-89).factorial()
Infinity
```
If you decide against Infinity then please change the above for consistency (you can find the code in `libs/pynac/pynac.pyx`).
