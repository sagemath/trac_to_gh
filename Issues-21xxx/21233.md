This fixes two sort of related issues.

The first is a test failure I had for this module on my Windows machine (though possibly not all that related to Cygwin):

```
sage -t src/sage/parallel/map_reduce.py

File "src/sage/parallel/map_reduce.py", line 217, in sage.parallel.map_reduce
Failed example:

        print("Computation normally finished")
        res
Expected:

        self._abort.value = True
    AttributeError: 'bool' object has no attribute 'value'

```

The computation timeout method crashes and the computation finishes "normally" due to a bug in the ordering of `self._timer.cancel()` and `self.finish()` which I fixed immediately.

However, the test was still failing due to the calculation still finishing before the timeout.  I lowered the timeout by an order of magnitude, which worked around it.  But I also wanted to convince myself that the timeout was really working properly, so I instead modified the test to timeout on a much larger calculation.  That was failing which led to finding the second issue fixed here, which is described in more detail in the commit message.

Now I'm thinking that in this part

```diff

+                logger.debug('Timed out waiting for results; aborted: %s' %

```
I can actually even do away with checking `self._aborted` since if the `get()` times out then we've already exceeded the timeout for the computation anyways.  Instead maybe it can just call `self._timer.join()` just to ensure that the timer already went off and called `self.abort`.

~~Or maybe even do away with the abort timer altogether and let the timeout be handled entirely here.  Not sure what implications that might have, if any.~~ I suppose you'd still want to have the abort timer in the case of a non-trivial reduce function.

I am trying to move towards py3, so I keep an eye on backward moves. There are surely many that escape my vigilance.

I would be strongly in favor of imposing that new code must be py3-compatible. Some of the patchbot plugins try to look out for that.

"from six.moves import queue" will do the job for you here.

I am using six all over the place, so I guess it is required.

Hi Erik,

In the method `get_result` you added a timeout on the call to `self._results.get`. Though I'm Ok with that, if this timeout fire your join the timer and simply return. I'd rather have an `AbortError` raised in that case. More precisely, I think the right way is to call the `abort` method, as if the other timer has fired. Actually, I'm not sure why you want this new timer. It seems to be redundant with `self.timer`, isn't it ?

Wow, this was a long time ago, and I never got around to looking at it again.  Thank you hivert for the review...

> Actually, I'm not sure why you want this new timer. It seems to be redundant with self.timer, isn't it ?

By "new timer" do you mean the new timeout in `self._results.get()` (since I didn't add any new timer per se)?  I admit I don't exactly recall, except that the main problem I had was very long blocking (for large computations) at this `get()` call.  In the commit message I wrote:

```
  Sometimes the main thread could hang at self._results.get() in self.get_results()
  This is because if a worker gets started on walk_branch_locally for a very large
  input before the computation is canceled, then self._results.get() will hang on
  the result from that worker.

  This is fixed by having self._results.get() timeout after no more than the
  timeout for the computation so that it can check the self._aborted flag before
  trying again.  This did necessitate changing self._results from a full-featured
  Queue rather than SimpleQueue; not sure what noticable impact that will have on
  a large calculation.
```

I think the point here is that the abort timer only calls `self._shutdown()` which sends poison pills to the workers but doesn't forcibly kill them.  So if a worker is somewhere deep in `walk_branch_locally` it doesn't get the poison pill. Instead it tries to finish the job it's currently doing, and `self._results.get()` waits forever.

But I guess you might have a point that now the `Timer` thread is not as important.  I guess one use for it still is if the `reduce_function` takes too long for some reason.

<div id="comment:17" align="right">comment:17</div>

On a Virtulbox running Windows10 professional, I compiled 8.0.rc0 + #21399 + #23339 (as suggested in [the Wiki](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/Cygwin64Port)) + #23097 + #21233 (present ticket) with the options :

```
export PREREQ_OPTIONS=--with-blas=atlas
export SAGE_ATLAS_LIB=/usr/lib
export MAKE="make -j4"
```

This passes `ptestlong` with no failures.

==> `positive_review`

Note : I have no advice on the contents of the patches (I do not know Cygwin well enough to undetstand what they are supposed to do) ; I just checked that this leads to a functional Sage.
