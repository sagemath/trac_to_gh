I'm hoping to learn how to be a better "sage citizen" who can at least easily contribute small patches, but in case that doesn't happen in the next few days (or months, or years), I ought to actually record the fix:

in `src/sage/matrix/matrix_integer_dense.pyx`

the lines

```
        if algorithm == 'flint' or (algorithm == 'linbox' and not USE_LINBOX_POLY):
            g = PolynomialRing(ZZ,names = var).gen()
            sig_on()
            fmpz_mat_charpoly(g.__poly,self._matrix)
            sig_off()

```

should be something like

```
        if algorithm == 'flint' or (algorithm == 'linbox' and not USE_LINBOX_POLY):
            g = (<Polynomial_integer_dense_flint>(PolynomialRing(ZZ,names = var).gen()))._new()
            sig_on()
            fmpz_mat_charpoly(g.__poly,self._matrix)
            sig_off()
```

(There's also a misleading line in the docstring above which says that linbox isn't used for this on 64-bit systems.)
