I understand that, but nobody has been explicit about *which* plot is the one which is supposed to fail without jmol. And again, I cannot reproduce the problem: for me, the doc builds **without** jmol.

I really don't like to add a "fix" for a problem when it's not at all clear what the problem is and whether the "fix" fixes it.

I feel that the problem is more subtle and we're missing something here...

Further analysis points to this `if` switch in `src/sage/plot/plot3d/base.pyx` in the `_rich_repr_jmol()` function:

```
        if not jdata.is_jvm_available():
            # We can only use JMol to generate preview if a jvm is installed
            from sage.repl.rich_output.output_graphics import OutputImagePng
            tachyon = self._rich_repr_tachyon(OutputImagePng, **opts)
            tachyon.png.save_as(preview_png)
        else:
            # Java needs absolute paths
            # On cygwin, they should be native ones
            scene_native = scene_zip
            import sys
            if sys.platform == 'cygwin':
                from subprocess import check_output, STDOUT
                scene_native = check_output(['cygpath', '-w', scene_native],
                                            stderr=STDOUT).rstrip()
            script = '''set defaultdirectory "{0}"\nscript SCRIPT\n'''.format(scene_native)
            jdata.export_image(targetfile=preview_png, datafile=script,
                               image_type="PNG",
                               figsize=opts['figsize'][0])
```

So the problem only occurs if Java is installed.

But this leaves the question: if Tachyon works, why not always use Tachyon to produce the plots?
