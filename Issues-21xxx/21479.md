I propose to support choosing a location for the SAGE_LOCAL tree, using 

```
./configure --prefix=SAGE_LOCAL
```
(the default would be, as before, the `local` subdirectory of SAGE_ROOT - see patch on the ticket).

I am fully aware that Sage's build system does not have a separation between 'make' and 'make install'; see #21495 for that. 

Nevertheless, SAGE_LOCAL should be considered the same as the `prefix` in the sense of the autotools.

This ticket is a step towards #21566.

<a id='comment:6'></a>(i completely agree with this)

a main obstacle is: the build system writes to $prefix during the build...

i suggest to do the transition one-package-at-a-time, and after `--disable-$package` is in place.

with `--disable-all`, it will be easiest to avoid writing to $prefix.

i think the behaviour of just "make" should not change, regardless of `--prefix`. it works perfectly well and *as intended* right now. clearly it should do something different under the hood, but that's not on this ticket.

> we do allow "make" to write into $prefix


why would you need/want that? can you please give an example?

my feeling is, that entangling prefix and SAGE_LOCAL further complicates the transition considerably. there will be no way to tell whether "this part still uses SAGE_LOCAL" vs. "this has already been cleaned". newcomers tend to grep a variable from the code, see how it is used and use it the same way. for a looong time to come.

`@`mkoeppe i've thought about it. it seems, the alternatives are much worse (#21501) or much more ambitious.

please go ahead with prefix==SAGE_LOCAL.

please consider to add a remark in some documentation (better place: `configure --help`?) on this temporary sort of prefix, such as 

"currently, `make install` is a no-op, that will change (hopefully). you should not expect a fully functional installation in $prefix before `make install` has finished."

<a id='comment:15'></a>Here's a first version of what I have in mind.

Some concerns:
- bootstrap. It's somewhat unclear what to do here. By the way, is it supposed to use the distribution's Python or ours?
- sage-location.

<a id='comment:16'></a>I don't like the duplication in `build/make/install` and `src/bin/sage-env`.

Here is a suggestion: add a new file, say `src/bin/sage-config` (or whatever you want to call it) to deal with configurable things like `SAGE_LOCAL`. You can also define the other `SAGE_*` directories (except `SAGE_ROOT`) there.

Then you can source this file in both `src/bin/sage-env` and `build/make/install`, which can then be independent of `configure`.

And I don't see the point of changing `$SAGE_ROOT/sage` because that is additional duplication.

```
## The first test does not actually work (see above).
```
("see above" can be really confusing because you don't know where to look.

Comments like these don't belong in the sources but in a Trac ticket:

```
	# TODO: Making directories in $prefix
	# should be done by 'make', not configure.
```

```
# TODO: Should the install hierarchy (local) really be deleted by make distclean?
```

```
#SAGE_ENV_DIR=`dirname $0`    ### Does not work. $0 is /bin/bash
```

It's referring to `dirname $0` -- which does not give the location of sage-env but rather /bin/bash. This is because sage-env is sourced (.) rather than executed.

Note this is existing code in `sage-env` which simply never worked.

I know, these comments are for the reviewer. I'll be happy remove them *after* we had a discussion about them... So do you have a comment on these?

BASH_SOURCE[0] gives the source of the "currently running function". See https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Bash-Variables.html (you need to read the entries for FUNCNAME and BASH_SOURCE).

Don't tell **me** but tell the person reading `sage-env` (i.e. clarify the comment in the file).

I realized that this is not entirely true. `sage-env` contains some code for discovering SAGE_ROOT when it is not set, but that code fails if $SAGE_LOCAL is not a direct subdirectory of $SAGE_ROOT. 
I suppose I could add the definition of SAGE_ROOT to sage-env-config. 
But that could go on a follow-up ticket as well.

Personally, I think that it should *not* be installed for an obvious reason: in order to find `sage-env-config`, you need to know `SAGE_LOCAL`, for which you need to source `sage-env-config`, for which you need to find `sage-env-config`...

Given that it should not be installed, a better place might be `build/bin/sage-env-config` instead of `src/bin/sage-env-config`.

And then you might as well drop the whole complicated stuff to figure out the directory of `sage-env` and just use `$SAGE_ROOT/build/bin/sage-env-config`.

If you agree, I could implement this.

($SAGE_LOCAL is just the first one that uses this file.) This is why it should be installed. \n\nThe idea is that `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/sage` would be able to work without having to go through the script `$SAGE_ROOT/sage` (and without depending on `$SAGE_ROOT` being set). As I realized in comment 68 above, it does not quite work yet -- because `sage-env` still tries to discover SAGE_ROOT. \nA complete solution would be to add a line that sets `SAGE_ROOT` to `sage-bin-config` as well.\nIf this sounds agreeable, I could do this.\n\n> Given that it should not be installed, a better place might be `build/bin/sage-env-config` instead of `src/bin/sage-env-config`.\n\n\nSee #21707 for a discussion regarding a distinction between build-time and run-time config variables; but I think SAGE_LOCAL (and SAGE_ROOT) should be defined in src/bin/sage-env-config (and installed in SAGE_LOCAL/bin/sage-env-config).\n\n> And then you might as well drop the whole complicated stuff to figure out the directory of `sage-env` and just use `$SAGE_ROOT/build/bin/sage-env-config`.\n> \n> If you agree, I could implement this.\n\n\nIn the end, anything that moves this ticket forward is fine with me.

> Do you expect `sage-env-config` to be installed in `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin`? Currently, that's a bit random, depending on whether or not `src/bin/sage-env-config` exists when running `./configure`.


Yes, it should be installed.

> Personally, I think that it should *not* be installed for an obvious reason: in order to find `sage-env-config`, you need to know `SAGE_LOCAL`, for which you need to source `sage-env-config`, for which you need to find `sage-env-config`...


`sage-env-config` is intended as a place for more variables defined by `configure`, to be used by $SAGE_LOCAL/bin/sage. ($SAGE_LOCAL is just the first one that uses this file.) This is why it should be installed. 

The idea is that `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/sage` would be able to work without having to go through the script `$SAGE_ROOT/sage` (and without depending on `$SAGE_ROOT` being set). As I realized in comment 68 above, it does not quite work yet -- because `sage-env` still tries to discover SAGE_ROOT. 
A complete solution would be to add a line that sets `SAGE_ROOT` to `sage-bin-config` as well.
If this sounds agreeable, I could do this.

> Given that it should not be installed, a better place might be `build/bin/sage-env-config` instead of `src/bin/sage-env-config`.


See #21707 for a discussion regarding a distinction between build-time and run-time config variables; but I think SAGE_LOCAL (and SAGE_ROOT) should be defined in src/bin/sage-env-config (and installed in SAGE_LOCAL/bin/sage-env-config).

> And then you might as well drop the whole complicated stuff to figure out the directory of `sage-env` and just use `$SAGE_ROOT/build/bin/sage-env-config`.
> 
> If you agree, I could implement this.


In the end, anything that moves this ticket forward is fine with me. But note there is more work planned that depends on this -- in particular #21469 (Enable VPATH builds).

The problem is that this comment is wrong:

```
    # Try to get autotools from our own package into PATH (Trac #21214)
    # This will fail for initial bootstrap, when sage-env-config has
    # not been created yet.
```
It's not just about autotools, it's also about getting `sage-download-file` in the `$PATH`.
