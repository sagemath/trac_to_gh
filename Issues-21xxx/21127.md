yes, I agree that this is not an easy review. But at least 4 of the files are
just modified by adding `optional - python2`.

And two other ones are just adding `...divide` so that the doctest can contain either `divide`or `true_divide`

In the coding file, we just get a correct result instead of an incorrect (but doctested) one.

In the two combinat files, the divisions are exact by congruence imposed on the parameters.

For the graph one, we divide by two an even quantity

For the logic one, we divide by 2 to perform a bit shift

for the knots one, I am not very sure of my change, but the doctests pass.

The crypto and hyperbolic are probably the more subtle ones.

See the bottom of the description of #15995:

```
export PYTHONIOENCODING="utf-8"

python -Qnew ./local/bin/sage-runtests --all
```
This runs all the tests with the new division behaviour. I have corrected here most of the failing doctests. There remains a few more difficult cases, where I have not been able to locate the problem.

I think we need a better strategy to deal with divisions.

Ideally, I would like to have a record of every single division operation in Sage. Then, for every division in the Sage sources:
1. If that division sometimes has a Sage `Element` as one of the arguments, it should be replaced by a true division.
2. If that division is always an `int`/`int` division, it should be replaced by a floor division.

I think this would take care of most divisions correctly.

Hmm... There was

`sk = ceil((C*(n1+n2))**(3/2))`

and in python2 for example `100**(3/2)` is `100`, whereas in python3 it is `1000.0`. But this seems to be a clear bug in current implementation. Maybe your change actually corrects this!

But I can not review this, as I do not know what `lwe.py` should do.
