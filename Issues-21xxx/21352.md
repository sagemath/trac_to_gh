<a id='comment:4'></a>Hello,

A framework which supports cryptosystems already exists in Sage (see `sage/crypto/cryptosystem.py`), but it does not contain a lot of code, and is designed in a way 
which does not support our needs.

We're about to discuss the redesign of this crypto framework.

<a id='comment:11'></a>This implementation is nice and barebone, but it's specialised to rank distance. The McEliece cryptosystem is originally, and usually, for Hamming-metric.

It seems that the only place this makes a difference in the current implementation is where the error is added. If this channel was simply given at construction time, then the class could be invoked with both a Hamming metric code or a rank metric code.

It would be nice to see a doctest with both instantiations.

The methods of the class are missing doc-strings and -tests, and the file should have a module doc-string that explains what the McEliece cryptosystem is.
