Also, the Russian character displays as a square box on Mac OS X El Capitan. Local Unicode fonts do not get incorporated into matplotlib output. Shouldn't there be some simple way to use local fonts?

I don't understand. This works:

```
DiGraph({u'Mäntysalo':[u'Frédéric']}).plot()
```

but this does not:

```
D = DiGraph()
D.add_edge(u'Mäntysalo', u'Frédéric')
G.show()
```

Do we want all vertex labels to be unicode automatically?  (I'm not sure if that is what is happening with the changed doctest in posets.)

On my machine (7.4.beta1), the example given in the ticket description does not work:

```
sage: Graph({'Б':[1,2]}).plot()
...
UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xd0 in position 0: ordinal not in range(128)
```

Probably due to:

```
sage: type('Б')
<type 'str'>
sage: type(u'Б')
<type 'unicode'>
```

you forgot the `u`. Ths is not an ascii string. As long as nobody cares about py3, we have to add a `u` for unicode strings.

The point was that 'Б' is a valid string (through not unicode), which is not handled by plot. If it will automatically be fixed by Python 3, it is probably better not to add artificial noise into the source code.
