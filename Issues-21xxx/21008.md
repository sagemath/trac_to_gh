```
Graph({'Б':[1,2]}).plot()
```

My mistake. Now it works and also

```
D = DiGraph()
D.add_edge(u'Frédéric', 'review', u'Mäntysalo')
D.show(edge_labels=True)
```

works.

On my machine (7.4.beta1), the example given in the ticket description does not work:

```
sage: Graph({'Б':[1,2]}).plot()
...
UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xd0 in position 0: ordinal not in range(128)
```

Probably due to:

```
sage: type('Б')
<type 'str'>
sage: type(u'Б')
<type 'unicode'>
```

The point was that 'Б' is a valid string (through not unicode), which is not handled by plot. If it will automatically be fixed by Python 3, it is probably better not to add artificial noise into the source code.
