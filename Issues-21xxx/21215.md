I propose to add periodic piecewise functions (for now, of a single real variable).

I see two main ways of doing so:

 (1) By extending `piecewise`. 

 (2) By making a suitably general symbolic mod function (#9935) and having the user combine it with a piecewise function. (This is how it is done in Mathematica, it appears - http://community.wolfram.com/groups/-/m/t/156025; see also https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Piecewise.html)

Glad to hear; this is what I would strongly prefer too.

Right now the result of `piecewise` has SR as its parent. Can this be changed so that it is in a more specific parent or category?

> As you seem to have a use case can you be please more detailed?

My first use case is in subadditive periodic piecewise linear functions, the periodic extensions of what can be seen here:
https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~mkoeppe/art/infinite-group/compendium.png
They appear in integer optimization. See https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~mkoeppe/art/infinite-group/ for more info if you're interested. I have some existing Sage code.

Generalizing slightly, I would actually like support for quasiperiodic piecewise functions -- that is, periodic plus a linear function.
Examples are `ceil` and `floor`. 

There is an algebraic viewpoint using group actions on this as well, which is useful for further generalizations, in particular for piecewise functions of several variables (#20877).

You are certainly aware that if they have one periodic piece they can be all expressed in terms of `floor`. Multiple pieces can be done by a combination of `floor` and `piecewise` I think.

Take as an example the floor function.
It can be written as x - frac(x). This is the unique way of writing it as a sum of a linear function and a periodic function (whose value is 0 at 0 - a normalization to make it unique).
This kind of direct sum decomposition should be accessible by methods of a quasiperiodic.

> Better question: how should the piecewise quasiperiodic be represented textually? 

Good enough for me if is printed as a sum of periodic and linear.
The periodic piecewise function could print like a piecewise function, followed by "extended periodically to R".

> What preferred way to input them?


No clear preference. The linear part could perhaps just be an optional argument in the constructor.
In the continuous piecewise linear case, I suppose one could have a shortcut to build quasiperiodic extensions of the given function, but this is not very important.
