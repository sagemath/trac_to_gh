In #21221, the package `libfplll` was renamed to `fplll`.

When building `fplll`, the old `libfplll` from sage-7.4.beta6 and earlier is still marked as installed.

This causes downgrades sage-7.4.rc0 -> sage-7.4.beta6 to fail since the build system does not know that `libfplll` was replaced by `fplll`. Therefore, after such a downgrade, the `libfplll` package is not reinstalled.

Solution:

1. Revert the renaming and remove `installed/fplll*` when installing `libfplll` (this ticket).

2. After the MPFR upgrade (#21660), rename `libfplll` -> `fplll` and remove `installed/libfplll*` when installing `fplll`.

Since `(lib)fplll` depends on MPFR, the changing of MPFR version will force a reinstallation of `(lib)fplll`. If both the `spkg-install` of `libfplll` and of `fplll` delete the other "installed" file, both downgrades and upgrades will work as expected.

That only solves the problem in one direction and will break a downgrade followed by an upgrade (`fplll` -> `libfplll` -> `fplll`).

You mean that `fplll` (and cython files depending on the lib) won't get rebuilt the second time?

Replying to [@jpflori](#comment%3A8):
> You mean that `fplll` won't get rebuilt the second time?

Exactly, because the build system will think that `fplll` is still installed.

The only way to get this working is to delete the files from `SAGE_SPKG_INST` in **both** directions (the old package should delete the new installed files and the new package should delete the old installed files).

Luckily, we can use the MPFR upgrade as an extra way to force a rebuild of `libfplll` when downgrading to sage-7.4.beta6 or earlier.
