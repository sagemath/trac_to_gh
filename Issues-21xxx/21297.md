This came up in the course of addressing #20511:

```
sage: R.<x,y,z> = PolynomialRing(QQ, 3)
sage: hash(R.ideal([x]))
0
sage: hash(R.ideal([x,y]))
0
```
But hashing for individual polynomials is itself broken (see #21272 and #21284), so probably best to fix that first.

Depends on #21272
Depends on #21284

Keywords: **hashing, polynomial rings, ideals**

Component: **algebra**
