Unfortunately this is one I don't fully understand.  At its core, this issue here is that on Windows (including Cygwin), the `tempfile.TemporaryFile` class is just an alias for `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile`:  https://hg.python.org/cpython/file/2.7/Lib/tempfile.py#l484

This is a bit unfortunate because the two don't have fully compatible interfaces.  At any rate, a major difference between the two is that in `NamedTemporaryFile.close()` the file is deleted after the object is closed (this of course assumes the file isn't being deleted before the handle is closed).

Because these exceptions were coming from a `__del__` the exception is not raised, but just printed.  This caused unpredictable test failures later on, due to the error messages being randomly inserted into test output.

The part of this that's mysterious to me is that I don't know why the temp files were being deleted before they got closed.  I couldn't find any place in our code that would explicitly delete them (not even `atexit` handlers).  Nor do I think the OS should be deleting them.  So that's a bit disconcerting.

I found this one place where explicitly using a `with` statement to ensure that the file was closed as soon as it was done with did the trick.  There are probably other places that could be more explicit about cleanup, but after fixing this one spot I was not able to reproduce the problem again.

Just a guess: maybe it has to do with the fact that the doctester forks and that the file is deleted by each forked subprocess?
