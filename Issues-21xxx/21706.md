The autotools package was changed from optional to experimental in #18563, which made this change for various packages.

The reason for changing autotools (missing xz dependency of libtool) has since been fixed in #21047.

The branch also fixes a build problem of autotools (texinfo) involving ncurses.

the interesting part of the attached log is

```
checking build system type... (cached) x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
checking for tgetent in -lncurses... no
checking for tgetent in -lcurses... no
checking for tgetent in -ltermlib... no

checking for tgetent in -lterminfo... no
configure: WARNING: probably need a terminal library, one of: ncurses curses termlib
 termcap terminfo
checking for library with termcap variables... 
```
while `ncurses` package is installed; my guess is that perhaps the appropriate `-L` is missing in LDFLAGS.

Anyhow, I don't see exactly what's happening in `spkg-install`, and why is does not run `./confgure`, which would be an appropriate place to pass proper `-L`.

It does run configure of all the packages involved, in `Makefile.build`. 

Here (on Mac OS X) I see:

```
[autotools-20141105] checking for tgetent in -lncurses... no
[autotools-20141105] checking for tgetent in -lcurses... no
[autotools-20141105] checking for tgetent in -ltermlib... no
[autotools-20141105] checking for tgetent in -ltermcap... yes
[autotools-20141105] checking for library with termcap variables... 
```
So on this system, tgetent is not provided by the ncurses library (from Sage's ncurses spkg) either, but rather from libtermcap.

Our `ncurses` package is built using configure option `--with-termlib`, which causes `tgetent` and friends to be put into the separate library `libtinfo`, not `libncurses`.

The ancient texinfo 4.13 that is used by our `autotools` package (with comment "texinfo 5.x breaks building old versions of autotools...") does not know about `libtinfo`.
