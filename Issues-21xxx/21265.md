This looks to be related to this: http://www.ginac.de/ginac.git/?p=ginac.git;a=commit;h=e5eeee53d814cedc12cd725e76b0eb87859cdd77  But in a different incarnation since (I think?) the ginac that the current pynac is based on is much older?

Not entirely sure why it only appears on Windows, but it wouldn't be the first time that the different linking routines used on Windows expose link issues that don't necessarily appear elsewhere (even if maybe they should).

Here's a working patch--this doesn't apply to ginac where all incarnations of this issue are already fixed.

I'm not sure what the procedure here is though.  Since we basically control pynac should the issue just be fixed in pynac, and pynac upgraded in Sage?  Or does it still make sense at this stage to have a patch to pynac in Sage?

Does this mean the Pynac code changes are not confirmed to resolve the issue?

To reinstall Pynac (in the sense that `make` will pick it up) after changes/patches outside the tarball the patchlevel must be increased, i.e. `0.6.8.p0` in `package-version.txt`. However, you can skip that by forcing a reinstall with `sage -p pynac; make`.

It is confirmed.  I had already made the changes and built pynac from source (that is actually compiled it).
