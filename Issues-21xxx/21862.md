Symbolic methods on relational expressions (equalities and inequalities) work inconsistently. Some of them directly apply to both sides, some don't do anything at all, and some behave unexpectedly.

For example, `collect` does nothing (same with inequalities):

```
sage: var('y')
y
sage: eq = x^2 + x*y + 3*x == 0
sage: eq.collect(x)
x^2 + x*y + 3*x == 0
sage: eq.lhs().collect(x)
x^2 + x*(y + 3)
```

`limit` behaves differently with different arguments, and it's not at all clear what it's doing:

```
sage: eq = exp(-x) == x
sage: eq.limit(x=0)
0
sage: eq.limit(x=2)
e^(-2) == 2
```

`factor` takes equalities and returns a non-relational expression:

```
sage: (x^2 + x == 0).factor()
(x + 1)*x
```
and doesn't work at all with inequalities:

```
sage: (x^2 + x > 0).factor()
ValueError: Unable to represent as a polynomial
```

Even more strange:

```
sage: (x == 3).exp()
e^(x == 3)
```
