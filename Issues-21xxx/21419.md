I would like to implement relations A-D from http://www.math.hawaii.edu/~jb/unbound.ps

It seems natural to first start from the function that is marked as greek letter kappa at the paper. Here I gave it just a name `kappa()`.

That's good name!

Rosenberg and Gert Sabidussi, or http://journals.cambridge.org/download.php?file=%2FJAZ%2FJAZ1_63_01%2FS1446788700000355a.pdf&code=9cc17eeb007fe5d050aadfcbedad50cd, but I did not found other mentions of "kappa function" spelled out.

Should I ask from J. B. Nation himself?

Name `maximal_incomparable_element` would suggest that function works for all elements in every poset, and it really could be defined so. But I have seen it only used for join-irreducibles.

I found a book that uses a section title "The $\kappa$ function". But to make this more complicated: there are also dual functions, i.e. "kappa'" defined for meet-irreducibles.
