I would like to implement relations A-D from http://www.math.hawaii.edu/~jb/unbound.ps

It seems natural to first start from the function that is marked as greek letter kappa at the paper. Here I gave it just a name `kappa()`.

That's good name!

By googling I found that Lattices and Ordered Sets by Steven Roman p. 225 uses the name "kappa function", but I can not see the page itself. The symbol itself seems to be coherently used for this, see Algebras and Orders by Ivo G. Rosenberg and Gert Sabidussi, or http://journals.cambridge.org/download.php?file=%2FJAZ%2FJAZ1_63_01%2FS1446788700000355a.pdf&code=9cc17eeb007fe5d050aadfcbedad50cd, but I did not found other mentions of "kappa function" spelled out.

Should I ask from J. B. Nation himself?

Hmm.. Hard to say. I left this open and think.

Name `maximal_incomparable_element` would suggest that function works for all elements in every poset, and it really could be defined so. But I have seen it only used for join-irreducibles.

J.B. Nation answered: "It seems that the 'kappa' notation is fairly widely used, but perhaps not enough to be called standard. It is useful though."

It is useful at least to check if a lattice is semidistributive or to compute canonical joinands. But to publish it on `lattices.py` or not to publish - that is the question.
