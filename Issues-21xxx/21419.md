I would like to implement relations A-D from http://www.math.hawaii.edu/~jb/unbound.ps

It seems natural to first start from the function that is marked as greek letter kappa at the paper. Here I gave it just a name `kappa()`.

That's good name!

By googling I found that Lattices and Ordered Sets by Steven Roman p. 225 uses the name "kappa function", but I can not see the page itself. The symbol itself seems to be coherently used for this, see Algebras and Orders by Ivo G.

Should I ask from J. B. Nation himself?

Hmm.. Hard to say. I left this open and think.

Name `maximal_incomparable_element` would suggest that function works for all elements in every poset, and it really could be defined so. But I have seen it only used for join-irreducibles.

Back to *needs_review*. This can not be "maximal incomparable element", as that is not the case in special case where an element covers a doubly irreducible element; then `\kappa(a)=a`. Hence I can see no easy name for the function at all, except "kappa".

Now the question is should we have this available at "interface level", i.e. in `lattices.py` at all, or just hidden in `hasse_diagram.py`. Also, is it more clear to explicitly say in the documentation that this is the greatest incomparable elemenet excluding the special case?

J.B. Nation answered: "It seems that the 'kappa' notation is fairly widely used, but perhaps not enough to be called standard. It is useful though."

It is useful at least to check if a lattice is semidistributive or to compute canonical joinands. But to publish it on `lattices.py` or not to publish - that is the question.
