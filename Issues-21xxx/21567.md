Trying to build Sage from scratch on OS X 10.12 results in a broken Python:

```
    Failed to build these modules:
    _scproxy    
```
We've seen this before -- see #17174 and #17169.

It was fixed by a gcc upgrade plus what looks like a hack -- from the gcc `spkg-install` script:

```

# On OS X 10.10 there is random ObjC stuff in a C header
if { uname -sr | grep 'Darwin 14\.' ;} &>/dev/null; then
    if [ -f /usr/include/dispatch/object.h ]; then

    else
        echo "Warning: header /usr/include/dispatch/object.h not found, not applying fix."
    fi
fi
```
I tried changing this so it would also apply if it matched `Darwin 16.`, but it didn't help. I'm a little wary of #21603 because of #20350, but I'll give it a try later today.

Replying to [@kiwifb](#comment:20):
> The mixing of objective C with C in system headers is deep with that one. I am almost ready to suggest we just compile `python` with clang on OS X. Should work.

Interesting idea. I built python with clang and things mostly worked. `r` and `psutil` failed to build. I got around that by building `r` with clang and basically ignoring `psutil`. I two some doctest failures, but they were not repeatable. I'm going to run doctests again to see what happens.

The `r` failure:

Now I see that if I build that with `clang`, it works too. (In all of these cases, I just put `CC=clang` some appropriate place in `spkg-install`.)

Openblas in use then - minor detail, we should get a switch to use Accelerate but that's low priority. 

Sierra makes Yosemite look like a picnic. Now the ants have arrived. Unless someone bundles some nice libc headers for OS X (I think intel may be doing this, I think they have their own libc) we are being pushed to clang.

sage is in no condition to be compiled with clang/clang++/gfortran right now, I don't think we can rely clang/g++/gfortran either at the moment. Using clang (not clang++) in a few key package is acceptable but in the long term, unless something happen in the GNU camp, we should prepare the move to clang/clang++/gfortran (or available fortran compiler coming along).

> I can push my current branch with the changes in [comment:23](#comment:23) if you think that's a good idea.

Yes, that would allow people on Sierra to build sage even if we don't push it in this form to release.

I think we should aim for something like clang/g++/gfortran for packages and gcc/g++/gfortran for sagelib. clang/clang++/gfortran for package and gcc/clang++/gfortran for sagelib would be even better but I don't believe we can pull it off. But I should give it a go to be sure since I have already done the package side.

The failure in matrix_integer_dense.pyx is also very common on OSX 10.11 right now (possibly related to openblas, not sure). Why not go with [comment:23](#comment:23), its definitely an improvement over not building.
