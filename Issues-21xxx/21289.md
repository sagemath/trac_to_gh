Can you check canonical label for plain graphs? Are you sure that you don't have Bliss installed in 6.9 but not in 7.4?

(no, i haven't installed bliss in either version)

The problem is actually elsewhere:

```
sage: timeit('p._hasse_diagram.canonical_label(algorithm="sage")')
5 loops, best of 3: 93 ms per loop
```

In 7.4, all the time is eaten by

```
sage: timeit("is_package_installed('bliss')")
5 loops, best of 3: 1.37 s per loop
```

I think that `Posets.canonical_label` should also accept the optional argument `algorithm`.

True. I can add it, but let's first check what is wrong here.

I think I got it. It does

```
proc = subprocess.Popen(["pip", "list"], stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
stdout = proc.communicate()[0]
return dict((name.lower(), version) for name,version in PIP_VERSION.findall(stdout))
```

and this is clearly too much for every function call.

Some are possibly OK, for example in `cremona.py`, because they only determine the error message.

However, that's not quite true either: if I'm going to catch an error, I possibly rely on it being thrown quickly...

?? If the result is cached, we got only one delay of two seconds. Currently running something like

```
g_list = [g.canonical_label() for g in g_list]
