Can you check canonical label for plain graphs? Are you sure that you don't have Bliss installed in 6.9 but not in 7.4?

(no, i haven't installed bliss in either version)

The problem is actually elsewhere:

```
sage: timeit('p._hasse_diagram.canonical_label(algorithm="sage")')
5 loops, best of 3: 93 ms per loop
```

In 7.4, all the time is eaten by

```
sage: timeit("is_package_installed('bliss')")
5 loops, best of 3: 1.37 s per loop
```

I think that `Posets.canonical_label` should also accept the optional argument `algorithm`.

True. I can add it, but let's first check what is wrong here.

However, that's not quite true either: if I'm going to catch an error, I possibly rely on it being thrown quickly...
