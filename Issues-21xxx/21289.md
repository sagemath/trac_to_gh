Can you check canonical label for plain graphs? Are you sure that you don't have Bliss installed in 6.9 but not in 7.4?

(no, i haven't installed bliss in either version)

The problem is actually elsewhere:

```
sage: timeit('p._hasse_diagram.canonical_label(algorithm="sage")')
5 loops, best of 3: 93 ms per loop
```

In 7.4, all the time is eaten by

```
sage: timeit("is_package_installed('bliss')")
5 loops, best of 3: 1.37 s per loop
```

I think that `Posets.canonical_label` should also accept the optional argument `algorithm`.

Is the problem `installed_packages()`? On my system it seems to be the problem.

True. I can add it, but let's first check what is wrong here.

and this is clearly too much for every function call.

Just do something like:

```
try:
    import sage.graphs.bliss
    have_bliss = True
except ImportError:
    have_bliss = False
```
and use this `have_bliss` variable where needed.

That's it!

raise PackageNotFoundError("bliss")
