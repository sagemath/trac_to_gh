Using the flattening morphism from #21106 we can divide more polynomials!  With the branch applied the following works

```
sage: R = QQ['a','b']['c','d']
sage: R('(a*b+1)*c + c^2').quo_rem(R('c'))
(c + a*b + 1, 0)
```
However, will persist a discrepency between `QQ['a']['b']['c']` and `QQ['a','b','c']` when the division is not exact.

```
sage: R1 = QQ['a']['b']['c']
sage: R2 = QQ['a','b','c']
sage: R1('a').quo_rem(R1('b'))
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ArithmeticError: Division non exact (consider coercing
to polynomials over the fraction field)
sage: R2('a').quo_rem(R2('b'))
(0, a)
```

Note that fixing the quo_rem resolves the issue in #21100. So I've included a commit with that example to test that issue. We can then close that ticket as resolved or whatever is appropriate.

If you're fine with the example, this can be marked positive-review.
