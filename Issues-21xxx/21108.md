CC:  @bhutz

Using the flattening morphism from #21106 we can divide more polynomials!  With the branch applied the following works

```
sage: R = QQ['a','b']['c','d']
sage: R('(a*b+1)*c + c^2').quo_rem(R('c'))
(c + a*b + 1, 0)
```
However, will persist a discrepency between `QQ['a']['b']['c']` and `QQ['a','b','c']` when the division is not exact.

```
sage: R1 = QQ['a']['b']['c']
sage: R2 = QQ['a','b','c']
sage: R1('a').quo_rem(R1('b'))
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ArithmeticError: Division non exact (consider coercing
to polynomials over the fraction field)
sage: R2('a').quo_rem(R2('b'))
(0, a)
```

Looks fine to me. All test pan out.

Note that fixing the quo_rem resolves the issue in #21100. So I've included a commit with that example to test that issue. We can then close that ticket as resolved or whatever is appropriate.

If you're fine with the example, this can be marked positive-review.
