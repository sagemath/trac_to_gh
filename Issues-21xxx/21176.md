as small steps towards py3

here is another bunch of cmp removed

method: try to compile sage with python3 and solve one failure after the other.

This should help to see what kinds of problems and solutions we will meet about cmp.

<a id='comment:6'>Comment 6:</a>
About `src/sage/categories/morphism.pyx`:

You are changing code of the form

```
c = cmp(x.A, y.A)
if c: return c
c = cmp(x.B, y.B)
if c: return c
c = cmp(x.C, y.C)
return c
```
to

```
t = (x.A, x.B, x.C)
u = (y.A, y.B, y.C)
return richcmp(t, u, op)
```

The latter is less efficient because it does not "lazily" compute the `.B` and `.C` attributes.

I think that more efficient code should be written. Here is an idea:

```
# Helper method in sage_object.pxd (based on #21128 to avoid conflicts)
cpdef inline richcmp_not_equal(x, y, int op):
    """
    Like ``richcmp(x, y, op)`` but where it is known that `x` is not equal to `y`.
    """
    if op == Py_EQ:
        return False
    if op == Py_NE:
        return True
    return PyObject_RichCompare(x, y, op)
    
# Actual code in _richcmp_
if x.A != y.A:
    return richcmp_not_equal(x.A, y.A, op)
if x.B != y.B:
    return richcmp_not_equal(x.B, y.B, op)
return PyObject_RichCompare(x.C, y.C, op)
```

In fact, I think this `_cmp_` in morphism is probably never used anywhere. The current code in the branch is broken (self.domain is missing parentheses), and yet all doctests pass !

About the general issue you ask, what about having a method

```
richcmp_lazy_for_list(self, other, list_of_functions, op)
```
where list of functions would be used as a "lazy-key" for comparison.

In the example appearing in morphism, we would use

```
richcmp_lazy_for_list(self, other, [lambda x: x.domain(), lambda x: x.codomain(),
  lambda x: tuple(x(gen) for gen in x.domain().gens())], op)
```

This `richcmp_lazy_for_list` would evaluate step by step, using as few functions as possible.

We are really hit hard here by the rather dubious preference in python3 for sorting keys rather than sorting functions. I think we need some kind of lazy-key mechanism.
