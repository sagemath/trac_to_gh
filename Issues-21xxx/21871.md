A graph is apex if it can be made planar by the removal of a single vertex. See [`the wikipedia article on Apex graph`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apex_graph) for more details.

I wrote this method after reading [`this question`](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/35112/how-do-i-write-function-to-test-if-a-graph-is-apex/) on https://ask.sagemath.org/.

So far I fixed the issue with immutable graphs, and I also added the feature to `graph_classes`. So we can write:

```
sage: G = graphs.PetersenGraph()
sage: G in graph_classes.Apex
False
sage: G = graphs.Grid2dGraph(5,5)
sage: G in graph_classes.Apex
True
sage: G = graphs.RandomBarabasiAlbert(100,2)
sage: G = G.copy(immutable=True)
sage: G.is_immutable()
True
sage: G in graph_classes.Apex
False
sage: G.is_apex()
False
sage: G = graphs.Grid2dGraph(5,5)
sage: G.add_path([(1,1),'x',(3,3)])
sage: G = G.copy(immutable=True)
sage: G in graph_classes.Apex
True
```

Now, concerning the behavior of `certificate`. You are right that it is too complex. What I could do is either to return the list of apex vertices when set to True, or to remove that parameter from method `is_apex` and add a method `apex_vertices`.
Let me know what you prefer.

David.

I would prefer adding `apex_vertices()`. (With SEEALSO-crosslinks in docstrings of course. I would also crosslink `is_planar` <-> `is_apex`.)

I have added method `apex_vertices` with a parameter to limit the number of returned apex vertices. This is mostly useful for the `is_apex` method which only ask for one apex vertex.

I have also added the see also sections.

OK, this works. One note about code and some bikeshedding:

Why

```
H = Graph([e for e in self.edge_iterator(labels=0)], immutable=False)
```

and not just `H = self.to_simple()`?

- Exception string should start with lowercase and not end to a dot. I don't like it, but this was discussed in sage-devel, and this is how plain Python does.
- Example "A 2D grid is apex, and it remains apex when adding a universal vertex" is odd at `is_apex()`, when you do not add the apex vertex. Maybe that example could be removed, and left only to `apex_vertices()`.
- `len(apex)>=k` should be `len(apex) >= k`. This is some PEP whose number I don't remember.
- Input parameter "k: when" should be "k -- when", copy the format from some existing function.

ok.

done

Well, it would be weird to remember all these numbers ;)

Right, I forgot.
