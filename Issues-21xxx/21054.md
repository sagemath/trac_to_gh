The multiplication in the Möbius algebra is defined using the join, whereas the transition matrices between the natural and idempotent bases are given using the meet.

```
sage: M = posets.BooleanLattice(4).moebius_algebra(QQ)
sage: I = M.I()
sage: E = M.E()
sage: I.one() * E.an_element() == E.an_element()
True
sage: E.an_element() * I.one() == E.an_element()
False
sage: E.one()
E[0]
sage: I.one()
I[0] + I[1] + I[2] + I[3] + I[4] + I[5] + I[6] + I[7] + I[8] + I[9] + I[10] + I[11] + I[12] + I[13] + I[14] + I[15]
sage: E(I.one())
E[15]
sage: I(E.one())
I[0]
sage: E.an_element() * E(I.one())
7*E[15]
```
We fix the transition matrix to use the join (the dual version of what is given in the references).

So the reason why this gets exposed is not with the Möbius algebra code, but instead with the `WithRealizations` framework or the `_test_one` method (and coercion) depending on how you look at it. The problem is that running the doctests in that order first produced the `I` basis, which becomes the first basis in the `_realizations` list, and this differs from the `a_realization()` basis (the `E` basis). So the `_an_element_` constructs an element from `realizations()[0]`, but `one()` uses `a_realization().one()`. So this coerces into the `I` basis, and then compares it to the `E` basis (or vice versa). It is this comparison which fails:

```sage
sage: L = posets.BooleanLattice(4)
sage: M = L.moebius_algebra(QQ)
sage: M.I()
Moebius algebra of Finite lattice containing 16 elements over Rational Field in the idempotent basis
sage: TestSuite(M).run()
Failure in _test_one:
...
------------------------------------------------------------
The following tests failed: _test_one
sage: I = M.I()
sage: E = M.E()
sage: I.one() * E.an_element() == E.an_element()
True
sage: E.an_element() * I.one() == E.an_element()
False
```
So IMO, the simplest fix is to use `a_realization` for `_an_element_` (which will probably fix some other `TestSuite` issues I've noticed in the past, which fails if a realization was never given).

However, with all of that being said, there still is a problem with the `one` for the idempotent basis:

```
sage: E.one()
E[0]
sage: I.one()
I[0] + I[1] + I[2] + I[3] + I[4] + I[5] + I[6] + I[7] + I[8] + I[9] + I[10] + I[11] + I[12] + I[13] + I[14] + I[15]
sage: E(I.one())
E[15]
sage: I(E.one())
I[0]
sage: E.an_element() * E(I.one())
7*E[15]
```
So the first issue is now #21059. For the main issue on this ticket, I guess I will have to read the references again to make sure there isn't something like a sign flipped.

Not exactly, but we are moving away from `_cmp_` altogether (#21043 to Python3). So there might be a problem with a facade poset whose elements have a partial ordering which is not compatible with the poset's ordering. Although the triangularity part is somewhat moot because we have an explicit description of both transition maps.

All tests pass for me, so if you agree with the above, then please set a positive review.

Thanks for looking at this. I know you've got a lot on your plate moving out to UMN, and it will be great to have you here.

Hi Travis and Darij!

Sorry for jumping in that late.

I also tend to see the coercion morphisms as being exposed, since, as
mentioned, the user can recover them through `coerce_map_from`. So it
would be indeed better to keep the triangularity feature.

I am uncomfortable with converting the poset to a non facade: this
forces users to do conversions whenever accessing the basis
indices. This can be painful and may lead to subtle bugs if the user
does not notice that the lattice was changed to non facades.

Instead we would want the term ordering to be computed through `P`
(e.g. through `P.le`). I did not follow the details, but in case this
is easier to implement once some other ticket will be merged, I guess
the current workaround can be ok.

I let you decide how to proceed!

Cheers,
                              Nicolas

Hi!

I am answering here for locality in the discussion, but of course this
belongs to the new ticket.

Is there anything that prevents us from defining a custom cmp function
that is consistent with the default linear extension of the poset and
passing it to `TriangularMorphism`?

Here is a facade poset for which cmp is wrong:

```
    sage: P = posets.SetPartitions(3)
    sage: P.category()
    Join of Category of finite lattice posets and Category of finite enumerated sets and Category of facade sets
    sage: P.top()
    {{1, 2, 3}}
    sage: sorted(P, cmp=cmp)
    [{{1}, {2}, {3}}, {{1}, {2, 3}}, {{1, 2}, {3}}, {{1, 2, 3}}, {{1, 3}, {2}}]
```

A proper cmp function:

```
    sage: key = dict((p,i) for i,p in enumerate(P.linear_extension()))
    sage: def mycmp(p,q): return cmp(key[p], key[q])
    sage: sorted(P, cmp=mycmp)
    [{{1}, {2}, {3}}, {{1}, {2, 3}}, {{1, 2}, {3}}, {{1, 3}, {2}}, {{1, 2, 3}}]
    ```

```
    sage: TriangularMorphism(..., cmp=mycmp)
```

This suggests that it would be nice for TriangularMorphism to accept a
`key` argument, but that's a different discussion.

Cheers,
                                Nicolas
