Let symbolic `factor_list()` do integer factorisation if given an integer or fraction.

```
sage: SR(50).factor_list()
[(50, 1)]
sage: SR(49/100).factor_list()
[(49/100, 1)]
```

Too much surprise for new users.

<a id='comment:5'></a>Two comments:

- I don't think SR needs to be imported at all. The very fact that we land in this `factor_list` implementation should mean that `self.parent()` should be SR. And if it isn't, that's probably the better parent to use anyway.

- If we're going to do this anyway, I think it's better if we have

```
sage: (5/3*x/(x+1)).factor_list()
[(x + 1, -1), (x, 1), (5, 1), (3,-1)]
```
because it's closer to the idea that the factorisation of a product U*V has a tendency to be the concatenation of the factorisations of U and V.


It should be clear that `factor_list` just returns *a* factorisation:

```
sage: ((sqrt(5)+1)^2*(x^2-5)).expand_rational().factor_list()
[(x^2 - 5, 1), (sqrt(5) + 3, 1), (2, 1)]
```

but keeping the convention that we factor rational numbers into their prime factors should be fine and could be nice for newbies.

This is only used internally, so it might be good to consider a customized exception:

And yes, I think `RuntimeError` is more appropriate (but if you insist on `ValueError` then I am good with it as well, although wanting to hear your arguments for that ;) )
