See [http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/probability/sage/probability/random_variable.html#sage.probability.random_variable.RandomVariable_generic](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/probability/sage/probability/random_variable.html#sage.probability.random_variable.RandomVariable_generic) for example.

A single `*` should be replaced with `\cdot`, and a double `**` should be replaced with `^`.
