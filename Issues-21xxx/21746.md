This branch does result in ~10% slowdown:

```
sage: V = VectorSpace(GF(2), 2^10)
sage: %timeit V([1]*(2^10))
The slowest run took 5.95 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
10000 loops, best of 3: 49.8 µs per loop
```
Before:

```
sage: V = VectorSpace(GF(2), 2^10)
sage: %timeit V([1]*(2^10))
The slowest run took 5.69 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
10000 loops, best of 3: 45.8 µs per loop
```
However, changing the for loop over `enumerate` back to `for i from 0 <= i < self._degree:` and setting `xi = x[i]` doesn't have a noticeable impact. So I think we have to deal with this.

I do have one nitpick: change the `ZeroDivisionError` to start with a lowercase. Once that is done, you can put this back to a positive review.

Thanks for the timings!

    mzd_set_ui(self._entries, 0)
```
