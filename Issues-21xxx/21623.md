Documentation builds, but failing doctest in `fast_callable.pyx`.

Would like more information on "overflow exceptions in `cot/csc`", which is presumably this [commit](https://github.com/pynac/pynac/commit/08a27812e3280bfa60ee341748ab82173ee13635). What does this fix exactly?

The versioning is nonstandard. If this is a minor update it should be 0.6.9.1, otherwise 0.6.10.

Curious. The doctest change seemeed necessary, but not anymore.

> Would like more information on "overflow exceptions in `cot/csc`", which is presumably this [commit](https://github.com/pynac/pynac/commit/08a27812e3280bfa60ee341748ab82173ee13635). What does this fix exactly?


I think I explained this already. The only exact numeric value that can go into `inverse()` is zero. All others are inexact. Otherwise the doctest that fails is:

```
File "src/sage/functions/trig.py", line 268, in sage.functions.trig.Function_cot.__init__
Failed example:

Exception raised:

        res = g_function_eval1(self._serial,
    OverflowError: numeric::inverse(): division by zero
```

> The versioning is nonstandard. If this is a minor update it should be 0.6.9.1, otherwise 0.6.10.


Where do you get the idea of a standard for versioning? I could use ISO 8601 of the release date as well for the version string. There is a tradition to use major/minor/micro for Pynac, and I changed micro from 9 to 91 (ninety one) to stay lexicographically consecutive.

I have a problem with the version number. In semantic versioning, incrementing by 82 implies that many private releases in between versions, which clearly wasn't the case. This version number is inconsistent with the entire versioning history of Pynac.

This version number appears to be an arbitrary choice. As a belatedly recognized direct contributor to this version, I think it is well within my purview to request a modification. As more of the symbolics of Sage is moved into Pynac, I would like to see that project become more of a true collaboration. Changing the version on GitHub is a straightforward process and would give evidence of acceptance of feedback.

I don't think this ticket should be approved with the current version number.
