Compare to #22010 and similar. This ticket makes same kind of modification, but also contains several manually removed `...` -lines, i.e. correct doctests that would not have noticed if a function would raise an exception. Hence I mark this as a bug correction.

You remove some spaces that should be there (for the Python standard 4 space indentation). Unfortunately, you will likely need to go back though this manually...

What? Does py3 require exactly 4-space indentation? If so, there must be a tool for that.

You did some changes like this:

```diff
 sage: def foo():
-...    return 5
+....:  return 5
```
whereas before it had the "proper" 4 spaces. While this isn't strictly necessary, the PEP8 standard is to have 4 spaces. I believe there are tools to check for PEP8, but we aren't completely compliant (because there are good times to bend/break the rules and there is a lot of old code that didn't even try to be PEP8).
