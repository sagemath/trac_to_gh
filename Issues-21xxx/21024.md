Do you mean that the attribution `David Moedinger (2014-07-30)` found in somewhat obscure place should be moved to the top?

How one can "take copyrights" when he/she added code to a file? I don't understand...

>But I would think it is a good idea to mention his name (maybe others?) in the AUTHORS field at the top of the module. An author may choose not to mention himself in the top of a module, but I think someone else has do it. That's is my opinion.


I will not object if anyone that has credit about any code in the file adds his or her name to the AUTHORS block. But I will not spend time to search for authors of each piece of code and add the names to the AUTHORS block.

<a id='comment:10'></a>Hi Kwankyu,
Thanks for looking at this again!

I agree that the existing weak Popov algorithm should just be removed, the algorithm should not support `k(x)` matrices but only `k[x]`.

I am surprised that the implementation of #16742 is so slow, but I can confirm your conclusion. David Mödinger was hired by me for a short while to produce that code, and at the time I know he convinced me that his timings were better than my own implementation. However retesting now, the implementation in [Codinglib](https://bitbucket.org/jsrn/codinglib) beats both his and your implementation by a wide margin. In particular, it seems your implementation becomes slow for large, low-degree matrices, since you iterate over, potentially, the whole matrix after every simple transformation:

```
 ---- Timing test: Big matrix ---- 
Codinglib 60 x 60 with deg 20 took on average 2.15060825348
Klee 60 x 60 with deg 20 took on average 17.5283669949
```

The above test was done by creating matrices which are extremely far from being row reduced: let `A, B` be two random lower-triangular matrices with 1 on the diagonal and everything else has high degree. Then we compute the weak Popov form of `A*B.transpose()`.

We can deprecate the support for `k(x)` in this ticket.

A matrix in weak Popov form is also row reduced. Thus, since either of our algorithms for weak Popov form are much faster than `row_reduced_form`, we should just call weak Popov instead. The answer is still correct (the returned matrix is row reduced), and it is computed faster. Therefore, I propose that `row_reduced_form` should just call the new `weak_popov_form` algorithm. And the current algorithm for `row_reduced_form` can be entirely removed.

Why not? Your code is already equipped with it. You need to just add some examples. 

Please also add your name to AUTHORS, to the code and to this ticket.

Did I say it? Your implementation is clear winner! :-)
