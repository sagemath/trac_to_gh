Sorry, I wrote my comment quickly. Maybe what I wrote was wrongly written. I was not meaning that you were trying to steal anybody's credit. Sorry if you understood that. That was clearly not my point. I just wanted to give proper credits to the initial author(s) of the moved code.

> Do you mean that the attribution `David Moedinger (2014-07-30)` found in somewhat obscure place should be moved to the top?

Yes. I am not a lawyer so I will not cite licences here, only my own opinion. If David Moedinger did not take copyrights in the original file, then, you might not include his name in the copyrights of the new file. But I would think it is a good idea to mention his name (maybe others?) in the AUTHORS field at the top of the module. An author may choose not to mention himself in the top of a module, but I think someone else has do it. That's is my opinion.

How one can "take copyrights" when he/she added code to a file? I don't understand...

>But I would think it is a good idea to mention his name (maybe others?) in the AUTHORS field at the top of the module. An author may choose not to mention himself in the top of a module, but I think someone else has do it. That's is my opinion.

I will not object if anyone that has credit about any code in the file adds his or her name to the AUTHORS block. But I will not spend time to search for authors of each piece of code and add the names to the AUTHORS block.

Hi Kwankyu,
Thanks for looking at this again!

I agree that the existing weak Popov algorithm should just be removed, the algorithm should not support `k(x)` matrices but only `k[x]`.

I am surprised that the implementation of #16742 is so slow, but I can confirm your conclusion. David Mödinger was hired by me for a short while to produce that code, and at the time I know he convinced me that his timings were better than my own implementation. However retesting now, the implementation in [Codinglib](https://bitbucket.org/jsrn/codinglib) beats both his and your implementation by a wide margin. In particular, it seems your implementation becomes slow for large, low-degree matrices, since you iterate over, potentially, the whole matrix after every simple transformation:

```
 ---- Timing test: Big matrix ---- 
Codinglib 60 x 60 with deg 20 took on average 2.15060825348
Klee 60 x 60 with deg 20 took on average 17.5283669949
```

The above test was done by creating matrices which are extremely far from being row reduced: let `A, B` be two random lower-triangular matrices with 1 on the diagonal and everything else has high degree. Then we compute the weak Popov form of `A*B.transpose()`.

Deprecation period for #16896, which contains the many annoying deprecations in `row_reduced_form` officially run out 19th January 2017.

I think this ticket is a good place to deprecate `k(x)` matrices.

We can deprecate the support for `k(x)` in this ticket.

Can we also not just throw away the old, slow `_row_reduced_form` algorithm, and simply make `row_reduced_form` an alias of `weak_popov_form`? (the alias makes sense as there might later be faster algorithms for computing just a `row_reduced_form`, particularly in a future release of LinBox).

Btw, my implementation is ready for also supporting shifts without too much penalty. This is something we should definitely add support for, though perhaps not in this ticket.

Why not? Your code is already equipped with it. You need to just add some examples. 

Please also add your name to AUTHORS, to the code and to this ticket.

OK, cool. Since we're at it, I think we should also:

1. Remove deprecations from #16896 and cleanup the related code (this ticket won't be in a stable release before the deprecation period runs out).
2. Add support for shifts, as you suggest.
3. Remove the old `row_reduced_form` algorithm and just call Mulders--Storjohann.

I'm pretty tied up this week, but I can try to get these last things done.
Best,
Johan

I already did (3) in the last commit. I can do (1). I can also do (2) if you comment here some nice examples; I will copy and paste.
