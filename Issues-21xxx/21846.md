Instead of doing this:

```
        if not isinstance(right, PointCollection):
            return NotImplemented
        cdef PointCollection left_pc = self
        cdef PointCollection right_pc = right
```
I would prefer

```
        try:
            cdef PointCollection left_pc = <PointCollection?>self
            cdef PointCollection right_pc = <PointCollection?>right
        except TypeError:
            return NotImplemented
```
which is safer and more Pythonic.

I'm not saying that the ticket should be set back to needs_work for this, but it's something to keep in mind for the next time...
