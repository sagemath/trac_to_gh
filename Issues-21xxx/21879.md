```
Currently, `is_injective` is almost never implemented:

```
sage: ZZ.hom(QQ).is_injective()
NotImplementedError
sage: QQ.hom(QQ).is_injective()
NotImplementedError
```
This makes the method `is_subring` mostly useless since its default implementation relies on `is_injective` of the "natural map":

```
sage: GF(3).is_subring(GF(9))
NotImplementedError
```
The changes introduced here, implement it as a method of the morphisms in the category of Rings where we can handle many common cases of morphisms (domain is a field, ….)

Note that `is_injective` is not shown in the tab completion anymore. A problem that is fixed in #21880.
