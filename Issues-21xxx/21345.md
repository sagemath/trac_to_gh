<a id='comment:2'></a>We can easily do better.

Previous code:

```
sage: G = graphs.PetersenGraph()
sage: %timeit G.edge_labels()
The slowest run took 5.12 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
100000 loops, best of 3: 11.9 µs per loop

sage: G = graphs.Grid2dGraph(50,50)
sage: %timeit G.edge_labels()
100 loops, best of 3: 6.98 ms per loop
```


Your code (almost the same):

```
sage: G = graphs.PetersenGraph()
sage: %timeit G.edge_labels()
The slowest run took 4.17 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
100000 loops, best of 3: 11.8 µs per loop

sage: G = graphs.Grid2dGraph(50,50)
sage: %timeit G.edge_labels()
100 loops, best of 3: 6.8 ms per loop
```


using instead `return list(l for _,_,l in self.edge_iterator())` seems more efficient.

```
sage: G = graphs.PetersenGraph()
sage: %timeit G.edge_labels()
100000 loops, best of 3: 10.1 µs per loop

sage: G = graphs.Grid2dGraph(50,50)
sage: %timeit G.edge_labels()
100 loops, best of 3: 2.81 ms per loop
```
