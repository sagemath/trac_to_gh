Long story : see [this](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-support/8TB431izNDc) sage-support thread.

Short story : Let M_x be the matrix representing a rotation of angle theta about the x axis (in ```R^3```), and M_y the matrix representing a rotation of angle phi about the y axis. Trying to find by elementary methods the axis of the composition, i. e. solving M_y*M_x*V-V for V, the only solution found its the trivial null vector.

This has been reproduced in Maxima and reported on their bug system as [bugs:3239](https://sourceforge.net/p/maxima/bugs/3239/), with no answer at the time of the present filing.

This can be worked around by using Sympy's solve, which involves some conversions using _sage_() (not *that* well documented).
