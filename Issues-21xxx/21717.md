The file

```
src/sage/libs/gmp/rational_reconstruction.pyx
```
implements rational reconstruction. However, it does not really belong in `src/sage/libs` since it doesn't implement a library interface. It is an implementation of an algorithm using GMP integers.

A better place would be

```
src/sage/arith/rational_reconstruction.pyx
```

Or remove it from the doc? I don't believe this is sufficiently interesting: http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/libs/sage/libs/gmp/rational_reconstruction.html
