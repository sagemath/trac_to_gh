As Jeroen described it in [[#21821 comment:15](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/21821#comment:15)], the `sage_setup` package is best conceived of as a collection of utilities extending the `setup.py`.  To that end, it doesn't make much sense to *install* it from the `setup.py`, at least not by default, since it shouldn't be used outside the context of running `setup.py` anyways.

If there is functionality in `sage_setup` that does make sense to run in other contexts, at runtime (`sage_setup.docbuild` might count) it should either be moved into the `sage` package itself, or a separate package that is installed, and that is explicitly designed to work outside the sage source tree.

Meanwhile everything in `sage_setup` should be explicitly designed to *only* work in the sage source tree (for the most part this just means making assumptions about paths relative to the source tree).

One argument *for* installing `sage_setup` is for testing it, but that isn't strictly necessary, and it doesn't make sense to test it outside the sage source tree (so long as it is designed explicitly to work in that context).
