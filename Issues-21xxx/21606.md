This code should be reviewed. But what's more important, is this kind of picture a good idea at all? I think that Nicolas was only one to comment my question about one year ago.

And if this is theoretically good idea, how about this picture? I do not have eyes for graphical things. A good example, or bad? If good, a good visualization or not?

What to do with non-doubled elements? Think about `LatticePoset({1:[(1,1)], (1,1): [(1,1,1)]})` or something similar.

I think this is very nice, and indeed the picture makes it clearer than plotting the poset.  Perhaps adding 

```
sage: L = LatticePoset({0:["a"], "a":["b","c"], "b":[1], "c":[1]})
sage: L.day_doubling(["a", "b", "c"])
Finite lattice containing 8 elements
```
is helpful.  Maybe you also want

```
The subset `S` is assumed to be :meth:`convex <sage.combinat.posets.hasse_diagram.HasseDiagram.is_convex_subset>` and connected.
```


In any case, I tried it on a few examples and I like it.

At least this made the code shorter. Hopefully I did not introduce bugs, please check.

Yep, automatically made plots are about never as good as hand-made, and Sage is not even a good at drawing. But still I think that the picture made by me is ugly. Hopefully some day someone with better color eye will change it.

Perhaps adding

I think that it should be easy to write by the user, there is already one example.

Hasse diagram is kind of internal documentation, so I just spelled out in the main text what convex and connected means.
