The motivation for this ticket is that the documentation for 

```
integral?
```
didn't mention very explicitly the different algorithms (it omits 'fricas', for example). The documentation that appears above is from the file
misc/functional.py.

However, grep'ing around I found out that there is a much better documentation in the integral() definition in sage/symbolic/integration/integral.py
but it simply never appears upon eitheir `integral?` or `integrate?`

Looking more closely, having the integrate() functions in both files seems redundant. One does `integrate = integral` and the other does `integral = integrate` at the end of their definitions.

My first reaction was to kill the definition from misc/functional.py
but I get a compilation error related to the docbuild(!) which I could not understand where it is coming from (yet).

So before going on with killing integral() from misc/functional.py (and obtaining the much better documentation from integral.py as a result) I would like to ask more experienced Sage developers what they think about this. Is this unification recommended or is it a stupid thing to try?

But again, the underlying motivation was about the poorer documentation from functional.py

I have prepared a preliminary patch (not to be applied) just to give an idea about what I meant above.

With the patch applied I get the (more helpful) documentation from integral.py upon `integral?`. Of course I could have just moved the text from integral.py to functional.py, but I thought that a bit of cleanup could be interesting.

So this patch also implies that `integrate` is no longer valid, and one should use `integral` only. That of course will break many tests (which could be fixed by `sed 's/integrate/integral/'`), but the point I want to raise is whether it is desirable to have two names for the same thing (for what it's worth, Mathematica admits only `Integrate`). IMHO, I think that Sage should allow only one name (my preferred choice would be `integrate`).

Of course, this patch is very preliminary. For example, I used the lazy_import() in all.py because I didn't know how to do it properly. This should be fixed I guess.

In any case, I realize that deprecating `integral` is a major decision. But the current situation with duplicated functions is not optimal (again imho). After my patch here I tested many integrals from examples in the sage source and they all worked the same way (provided integrate -> integral). So I guess that proves that there is some redundancy in the current code, and the documentation suffers from it.
