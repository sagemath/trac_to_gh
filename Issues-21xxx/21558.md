After #28197, we have prompt-toolkit 3.0.3. Something has changed, but `TERM=dumb ./sage` now has strange echo behavior.

This is not very important for us any more after #25363 (`--simple-prompt`), noting that the shortcomings of simple-prompt pointed out in https://github.com/prompt-toolkit/python-prompt-toolkit/issues/390#issuecomment-246825655 have been fixed.
