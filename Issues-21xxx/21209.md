subject says it all, see http://fricas.sourceforge.net/

The current version in Sage, 1.2.4, does no longer build with our version of ECL.  But 1.2.7 still has the same problem, so needs to get patched for it, replacing `uffi:` by `ffi:` in `src/lisp/fricas-lisp.lisp`.

I am currently rebuilding sage-develop...

Do I understand correctly that I should rename ```fricas-1.2.7-full.tar.bz2``` to ```fricas-1.2.7.tar.bz2``` before putting it into the ```upstream``` directory?

Would make sense.

Not sure if we can/should strip (=repackage) the tarball anyway; the description at least sounds as if there were things included we don't need for Sage / to ship.  But it isn't huge either.

If you do, you could create an `spkg-src` script, or at least document what you did in *"Special !Update/Build Instructions"* in `SPKG.txt`.

As far as I know: no, the things included in the "full" tarball are precisely those needed.

Unfortunately, build with ecl fails for the same reason as reported.

From Dima via sage-devel:

ECL does not use uffi: prefix any more, it's ffi: instead, according to their docs.
Replacing all the  uffi: with ffi: in src/lisp/fricas-lisp.lisp makes compiler happy.

Currently running the build, takes a while...

-The current version in Sage, 1.2.4, does no longer build with our version of ECL.
+The current version in Sage, 1.2.4, does no longer build with our version of ECL.  But 1.2.7 still has the same problem, so needs to get patched for it, replacing `uffi:` by `ffi:` in `src/lisp/fricas-lisp.lisp`.

`SPKG.txt` should get fixed and updated (as the patch has no header)... ;-)

I'd also add `[ -r "$patch" ] && ...` as usual.

Is there a test suite?

There is one trivial fix in ```axiom.py``` (line 686 should not be "\leqno(11)" but rather "..."), but the conversion of even basic fricas types to sage types is broken.

sage: a = fricas(1/2)
sage: a.variables()

For `fricas(1/2).sage()`, the fix looks doable, one needs to deal with `FriCAS`'s type Fraction. But the following is a bit weird:

```
sage: fricas(1/x).type()
Fraction(Polynomial(Integer))

sage: fricas(1/x).numerator()
1
sage: fricas(1/x).numerator().type()

sage: fricas(1/x).denominator().type()

Why do types of numerators and denominator are still `Fraction(...)`? This does not look right.

Just with the old interface, hence I reported it here.  (There were 27 orphans from perhaps testing `src/sage/interfaces/*` once or twice and one `ptestlong` I think.  I only incidentally noticed them after weeks because they weren't very active either.)

So when reviewing #21231, one should look whether there's still a problem.

Ah, sorry, forgot to answer.

You can also use e.g. `ps x | grep AXIOMsys | grep -v grep`.

(And `kill $(ps x | grep AXIOMsys | grep -v grep | awk '{ print $1 }')` ;-) )

<div id="comment:56" align="right">Comment 56</div>

Replying to [@mantepse](#comment%3A55):
> Thank you.  Indeed, there is a bug.  However, I don't know yet how to fix it, I thought that `fricas.quit()` would send `fricas._quit_string()` to fricas, but apparently it doesn't.  So, what should I do?  (I couldn't find anything but `_quit_string` in other interfaces...)

I think the problem is that more child processes of FriCAS are launched than `sage-cleaner` (a script that cleans up after Sage ends) is able to deal with.
In fact, you see that

```
sage: fricas._quit_string()
')lisp (quit)'
```
which is as it should be, as `FriCAS` inherits from `PanAxiom` class (in `sage/interfaces/axiom.py`), where `_quit_string` is defined.
And you see that `fricas.quit()` does kill the instance corresponding to `fricas.pid()`, as it should, by looking at the output of `ps -def...`.

Here is how it goes: I start Sage and execute `fricas.pid()` at the prompt; I see that this results in launching of a bunch of things:

```

```
of which the 1st one corresponds to PID reported by `fricas.pid()`. 

If I issue `fricas.quit()` and then quit Sage then no zombies live on. But if I just quit Sage then I get a zombie, one of these

```
/home/dima/Sage/sage/local/lib/fricas/target/x86_64-unknown-linux/bin/AXIOMsys -- /home/dima/Sage/sage/local/lib/fricas/target/x86_64-unknown-linux/bin/
```

Probably, the information on these extra processes' PIDs has to be registered somewhere for `sage-cleaner` to succeed.

Are you sure that `_quit_string` is used at all?  Because, if it is sent to fricas, then fricas should quit (and it does so on my machine).

Simply killing a few processes is error prone, I'd say.

The purpose of the Sage Cleaner is not to shut down pexpect interfaces, that is supposed to be done by Sage when exiting.

The Sage Cleaner is just there to afterwards (after a while) kill spawned processes if something went wrong.  And he doesn't know child processes spawned by these foreign ones, they have to belong to the same process group to make killing them work.

```

It shouldn't.  If I use `fricas._expect.write(")quit\r")`, fricas quits immediately.  So, indeed, `"\r"` is missing.  Should I simply modify the quitstring?

no, what you see is that fricas is running, with pid 10923, and that `fricas._expect.write(")quit\r")` is ignored by it. If you implemented `_quit_string` properly you would also be able to stop it as is possible with the old interface.

Dima, I don't understand your reasoning.  I would think that the first line below quits the fricas process on my machine, as the output of the second line shows.

```
sage: fricas._expect.write(")quit\r")
sage: !ps x | grep AXIOMsys | grep -v grep
sage: fricas.pid()
10923
```
The third line is in accordance with the doc of `.pid()`:

```
   Return the PID of the underlying sub-process.

   REMARK:

   If the interface terminates unexpectedly, the original PID will
   still be used. But if it was terminated using "quit()", a new sub-
   process with a new PID is automatically started.

   EXAMPLE:

      sage: pid = gap.pid()
      sage: gap.eval('quit;')
      ''
      sage: pid == gap.pid()
      True
      sage: gap.quit()
      sage: pid == gap.pid()
      False
```

So, in my opinion a possible fix is to append a `\r` to the quitstring - and of course, this should work with the old interface, too, although I did not test.

No idea though why fricas needs it, and, for example, gap, doesn't.

Thank you!

Indeed - I made a mess with the commits and found no time to correct them.  It would be of great help if you could, for example, create a "clean" branch from my branch, deleting all the commits which obviously don't belong (I made a list at the ticket).

I think the only work that remains to be done there is to add that "\r" to the quitstring, add a test to the `quit()` method, and probably some others to make the patchbot happy.

If the following an acceptable test for `quit()`?

```
sage: p = fricas.pid();
sage: l = !ps x | grep AXIOMsys | grep -v grep
sage: any(s.strip().startswith(str(p)) for s in l)
True
sage: fricas.quit()
sage: any(s.strip().startswith(str(p)) for s in l)
False
```

Jeroen just suggested on sage-devel to make the Python package `psutil` standard.

You could look into that for retrieving process information in a portable way.

I just managed to install `psutil`, and found out:

```
sage: import psutil
sage: p = fricas.pid(); p
22184
sage: pr = psutil.Process(p); pr

sage: fricas._expect.write(")quit\r")
sage: pr.children()
[]
sage: pr

```
This remaining job is killed when exiting sage.  However:

```
sage: p = gap.pid(); p
22582
sage: pr = psutil.Process(p); pr

sage: pr.children()

sage: gap.quit()
sage: pr

```
So it's better, but not perfect.  Is it good enough?
