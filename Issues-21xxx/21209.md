subject says it all, see http://fricas.sourceforge.net/

The current version in Sage, 1.2.4, does no longer build with our version of ECL.  But 1.2.7 still has the same problem, so needs to get patched for it, replacing `uffi:` by `ffi:` in `src/lisp/fricas-lisp.lisp`.

Do I understand correctly that I should rename ```fricas-1.2.7-full.tar.bz2``` to ```fricas-1.2.7.tar.bz2``` before putting it into the ```upstream``` directory?

Would make sense.

Not sure if we can/should strip (=repackage) the tarball anyway; the description at least sounds as if there were things included we don't need for Sage / to ship.  But it isn't huge either.

If you do, you could create an `spkg-src` script, or at least document what you did in *"Special !Update/Build Instructions"* in `SPKG.txt`.

As far as I know: no, the things included in the "full" tarball are precisely those needed.

Unfortunately, build with ecl fails for the same reason as reported.

From Dima via sage-devel:

ECL does not use uffi: prefix any more, it's ffi: instead, according to their docs.
Replacing all the  uffi: with ffi: in src/lisp/fricas-lisp.lisp makes compiler happy.

Currently running the build, takes a while...

Here is a discussion on [FriCAS list](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/fricas-devel/tko6MdXgFNM/fRb_JgGhCAAJ).
I take it that they see this as a bug. Perhaps there is a more intelligent way to fix this, more CL-y one...

I am still looking into the tests, but I suppose fixing them belongs to a different ticket.

Can I give this positive review?  (It works on my computer...)

`SPKG.txt` should get fixed and updated (as the patch has no header)... ;-)

I'd also add `[ -r "$patch" ] && ...` as usual.

Is there a test suite?

Does `make install` install the docs as well?  Do we otherwise want to install them, and if so, how, where?

There is one trivial fix in ```axiom.py``` (line 686 should not be "\leqno(11)" but rather "..."), but the conversion of even basic fricas types to sage types is broken.

Can anybody tell me where the method ``variables`` comes from (is implemented):

```
sage: a = fricas(1/2)
sage: a.variables()
[]
```
?

For `fricas(1/2).sage()`, the fix looks doable, one needs to deal with `FriCAS`'s type Fraction. But the following is a bit weird:

```
sage: fricas(1/x).type()
Fraction(Polynomial(Integer))
sage: fricas(1/x).denominator()
x
sage: fricas(1/x).numerator()
1
sage: fricas(1/x).numerator().type()
Fraction(Polynomial(Integer))
sage: fricas(1/x).denominator().type()
Fraction(Polynomial(Integer))
```
Why do types of numerators and denominator are still `Fraction(...)`? This does not look right.

OK, all done. Please have another look.
By the way, docs are installed in `SAGE_LOCAL/lib/fricas/target/x86_64-unknown-linux/share/`, at least if I do ` SAGE_SPKG_INSTALL_DOCS=yes sage -i fricas`.

Starting FriCAS at the `sage -sh` prompt then automatically pops up a docs "HyperText" menu, which uses some X11 stuff for displaying.

1) It's smells like a *minor* update (1.2.**4** to 1.2.**7**).

2) The *Dependencies* field of #21231 is empty.

Just with the old interface, hence I reported it here.  (There were 27 orphans from perhaps testing `src/sage/interfaces/*` once or twice and one `ptestlong` I think.  I only incidentally noticed them after weeks because they weren't very active either.)

So when reviewing #21231, one should look whether there's still a problem.

Ah, sorry, forgot to answer.

You can also use e.g. `ps x | grep AXIOMsys | grep -v grep`.

(And `kill $(ps x | grep AXIOMsys | grep -v grep | awk '{ print $1 }')` ;-) )

I think the problem is that more child processes of FriCAS are launched than `sage-cleaner` (a script that cleans up after Sage ends) is able to deal with.
In fact, you see that

```
sage: fricas._quit_string()
')lisp (quit)'
```
which is as it should be, as `FriCAS` inherits from `PanAxiom` class (in `sage/interfaces/axiom.py`), where `_quit_string` is defined.
And you see that `fricas.quit()` does kill the instance corresponding to `fricas.pid()`, as it should, by looking at the output of `ps -def...`.

Here is how it goes: I start Sage and execute `fricas.pid()` at the prompt; I see that this results in launching of a bunch of things:

```
dima     30739 30652  0 10:21 pts/4    00:00:00 /home/dima/Sage/sage/local/lib/fricas/target/x86_64-unknown-linux/bin/sman -nox -noclef -ws /home/dima/Sage/sage/local/lib/fricas/target/x86_64-unknown-linux/bin/AXIOMsys

dima     30747 30739  0 10:21 pts/4    00:00:00 /home/dima/Sage/sage/local/lib/fricas/target/x86_64-unknown-linux/lib/spadclient
dima     30748 30739  0 10:21 pts/4    00:00:00 /home/dima/Sage/sage/local/lib/fricas/target/x86_64-unknown-linux/bin/sman -nox -noclef -ws /home/dima/Sage/sage/local/lib/fricas/target/x86_64-unknown-linux/bin/AXIOMsys
```
of which the 1st one corresponds to PID reported by `fricas.pid()`. 

If I issue `fricas.quit()` and then quit Sage then no zombies live on. But if I just quit Sage then I get a zombie, one of these

```
/home/dima/Sage/sage/local/lib/fricas/target/x86_64-unknown-linux/bin/AXIOMsys -- /home/dima/Sage/sage/local/lib/fricas/target/x86_64-unknown-linux/bin/
```

Probably, the information on these extra processes' PIDs has to be registered somewhere for `sage-cleaner` to succeed.

Are you sure that `_quit_string` is used at all?  Because, if it is sent to fricas, then fricas should quit (and it does so on my machine).

Simply killing a few processes is error prone, I'd say.

The purpose of the Sage Cleaner is not to shut down pexpect interfaces, that is supposed to be done by Sage when exiting.

The Sage Cleaner is just there to afterwards (after a while) kill spawned processes if something went wrong.  And he doesn't know child processes spawned by these foreign ones, they have to belong to the same process group to make killing them work.

I just noticed that `fricas.quit()` does work (at least with the new interface).  However, it takes a very long time:

```

It shouldn't.  If I use `fricas._expect.write(")quit\r")`, fricas quits immediately.  So, indeed, `"\r"` is missing.  Should I simply modify the quitstring?

<a id='comment:66'></a>
Dima, I don't understand your reasoning.  I would think that the first line below quits the fricas process on my machine, as the output of the second line shows.

```
sage: fricas._expect.write(")quit\r")
sage: !ps x | grep AXIOMsys | grep -v grep
sage: fricas.pid()
10923
```
The third line is in accordance with the doc of `.pid()`:

```
   Return the PID of the underlying sub-process.

   REMARK:

   If the interface terminates unexpectedly, the original PID will
   still be used. But if it was terminated using "quit()", a new sub-
   process with a new PID is automatically started.

   EXAMPLE:

      sage: pid = gap.pid()
      sage: gap.eval('quit;')
      ''
      sage: pid == gap.pid()
      True
      sage: gap.quit()
      sage: pid == gap.pid()
      False
```

So, in my opinion a possible fix is to append a `\r` to the quitstring - and of course, this should work with the old interface, too, although I did not test.

No idea though why fricas needs it, and, for example, gap, doesn't.

Indeed - I made a mess with the commits and found no time to correct them.  It would be of great help if you could, for example, create a "clean" branch from my branch, deleting all the commits which obviously don't belong (I made a list at the ticket).

I think the only work that remains to be done there is to add that "\r" to the quitstring, add a test to the `quit()` method, and probably some others to make the patchbot happy.

If the following an acceptable test for `quit()`?

```
sage: p = fricas.pid();
sage: l = !ps x | grep AXIOMsys | grep -v grep
sage: any(s.strip().startswith(str(p)) for s in l)
True
sage: fricas.quit()
sage: any(s.strip().startswith(str(p)) for s in l)
False

I just managed to install `psutil`, and found out:

```
sage: import psutil
sage: p = fricas.pid(); p
22184
sage: pr = psutil.Process(p); pr
<psutil.Process(pid=22184, name='sman') at 140240479360400>
sage: pr.children()
[<psutil.Process(pid=22190, name='AXIOMsys') at 140240479356752>,
 <psutil.Process(pid=22191, name='session') at 140240479356816>,
 <psutil.Process(pid=22192, name='spadclient') at 140240479356880>,
 <psutil.Process(pid=22193, name='sman') at 140240479356944>]
sage: fricas._expect.write(")quit\r")
sage: pr.children()
[]
sage: pr
<psutil.Process(pid=22184, name='sman') at 140240479360400>
```
This remaining job is killed when exiting sage.  However:

```
sage: p = gap.pid(); p
22582
sage: pr = psutil.Process(p); pr
<psutil.Process(pid=22582, name='gap') at 140240479291088>
sage: pr.children()
[]
sage: gap.quit()
sage: pr
<psutil.Process(pid=22582 (terminated)) at 140240479291088>
```
So it's better, but not perfect.  Is it good enough?
