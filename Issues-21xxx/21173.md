I changed the name to inner_and_CM_twists and created two new functions called inner_twists and CM_twists.

    "body": "<div id=\"comment:7\" align=\"right\">comment:7</div>\n\nI think this needs some work in several respects:\n- The new methods need more documentation.  Briefly define what inner/CM twists are, explain more precisely what the output is (the characters, not the forms themselves), make it clear that CM twists are a special case of inner twists (in particular, the terminology \"outer twist\" does not seem appropriate).  Give a reference to the literature if possible.\n- Maybe clarify whether the results are provably correct.  This does not seem to be the case for the corresponding Magma functions; is it the case here?\n- Is it possible that there is more than one CM twist?  I thought that for a newform with CM, the character is unique.  In that case it would be more logical to return either the CM character or `None` (for non-CM forms), instead of a list.

I think this needs some work in several respects:
- The new methods need more documentation.  Briefly define what inner/CM twists are, explain more precisely what the output is (the characters, not the forms themselves), make it clear that CM twists are a special case of inner twists (in particular, the terminology "outer twist" does not seem appropriate).  Give a reference to the literature if possible.
- Maybe clarify whether the results are provably correct.  This does not seem to be the case for the corresponding Magma functions; is it the case here?
- Is it possible that there is more than one CM twist?  I thought that for a newform with CM, the character is unique.  In that case it would be more logical to return either the CM character or `None` (for non-CM forms), instead of a list.  If there can be multiple CM twists, could you give an example of such?
- In Python, objects of the form `[1, 2, 3]` are called lists, not arrays.
- In `inner_twists()` and `cm_twists()`, the `OUTPUT` block is not necessary in my opinion.
- I don't think the `OUTPUT` block should be indented.
