```
readelf -d `find /usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/sage -name \*.so` | grep -C 6 libgmpxx

File: /usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/sage/modular/arithgroup/farey_symbol.so

Dynamic section at offset 0x5bb88 contains 29 entries:
  Tag        Type                         Name/Value
 0x0000000000000001 (NEEDED)             Shared library: [libgmp.so.10]

That's the only hit with libgmpxx when compiled with `-as-needed`.

Will review this today.

Could, but I cannot answer that without doing sage archeology. Gentoo side as far back as ntl-5.5.2, `gmpxx` wasn't a requirement in dependency. So if it was in sage, that was probably a mistake.

<a id='comment:22'></a>Anyway, the *right* solution would be to add the flags to the file `src/sage/libs/m4ri.pxd`. If m4ri needs C99, then everything which uses that header should be compiled as C99.

```

if C99 is needed for `m4ri` we should get upstream to include it in the CFLAGS it sets, separately from fixing it for now.
