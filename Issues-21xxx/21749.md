That's the only hit with libgmpxx when compiled with `-as-needed`.

Could, but I cannot answer that without doing sage archeology. Gentoo side as far back as ntl-5.5.2, `gmpxx` wasn't a requirement in dependency. So if it was in sage, that was probably a mistake.

if C99 is needed for `m4ri` we should get upstream to include it in the CFLAGS it sets, separately from fixing it for now.
