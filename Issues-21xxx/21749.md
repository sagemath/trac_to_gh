Cool, for your question

```
readelf -d `find /usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/sage -name \*.so` | grep -C 6 libgmpxx

File: /usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/sage/modular/arithgroup/farey_symbol.so

Dynamic section at offset 0x5bb88 contains 29 entries:
  Tag        Type                         Name/Value
 0x0000000000000001 (NEEDED)             Shared library: [libgmp.so.10]
 0x0000000000000001 (NEEDED)             Shared library: [libgmpxx.so.4]
 0x0000000000000001 (NEEDED)             Shared library: [libstdc++.so.6]
 0x0000000000000001 (NEEDED)             Shared library: [libpython2.7.so.1.0]
 0x0000000000000001 (NEEDED)             Shared library: [libgcc_s.so.1]
 0x0000000000000001 (NEEDED)             Shared library: [libc.so.6]
```
That's the only hit with libgmpxx when compiled with `-as-needed`.

Will review this today.

Could, but I cannot answer that without doing sage archeology. Gentoo side as far back as ntl-5.5.2, `gmpxx` wasn't a requirement in dependency. So if it was in sage, that was probably a mistake.
