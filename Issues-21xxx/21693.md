Two functions related to the notion of linear structures in Boolean functions are implemented in this patch :

1. has_linear_structure() - determine whether the Boolean function has a nonzero linear structure
2. linear_structures() - obtain all linear structures of the Boolean functions as a vector subspace
3. is_linear_structure(val) - determine if val is a linear structure of this Boolean function

Similar functions are also implemented for mq.SBox.

<a id='comment:6'>Comment 6:</a>
There are doctest failures:
* you shouldn't use a random boolean function for doctest, it might have (with a small probability) some linear structure.
* remove a blank line

You can check locally that every test passes with the command `sage -t src/sage/crypto/boolean_function.pyx`.

You might use this syntax `ZZ(5).digits(base=2, padto=7)`.

`xrange` will disappear with python3, plus you don't really need it,
e.g. in `linear_structures`:

```sage
l = [ZZ(i).digits(base=2, padto=nvars)
     for i,ai in enumerate(self.autocorrelation())
     if abs(ai) == k]
```

Finally you might want to link this with `linear_structures` from `sage.crypto.mq.sbox.SBox` maybe adding a function `is_linear_structure` so that we can write

```sage
    all(s.component_function(b).is_linear_structure(alpha)
        for b,alpha,c in s.linear_structures()) == True)
```
but this is just a suggestion off the top of my head.

Hi [ylchapuy](#comment%3A6):

Thanks for the suggestions. In the latest commit I implemented a new function "is_linear_structure(val)", that returns True if "val" is a linear structure of this Boolean function. Following this, i have cleaned-up previous implementation of "linear_structures()" and "has_linear_structure()". Similar functions are also implemented in mq.SBox

Hello,

Your functions `has_linear_structure` and `linear_structures` are nonsense. You are calling 2<sup>n</sup> times `is_linear_structure` and hence coputing 2<sup>n</sup> times the autocorrelation where one would be enough! You should keep the three functions, but not call `is_linear_structure` in the two others.

1) In `is_linear_structure` why do you initialize `i` to `-1`? This value will be overriden in the `if/elif/else` statement.

2) There is no need to convert `int`, `long`, `Integer` inputs. You would better use the simpler

```
if isinstance(val, (tuple, list)):
    i = ZZ(val, base=2)
else:
    i = val

a = self.autocorrelation()
try:
    return abs(a[i]) == 1<<nvars
except IndexError:
    return False
except TypeError:
    raise TypeError("cannot compute ...")
```

3) You could add a `.. SEEALSO:` section to the documentation to make links between the three methods (see http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html).

You need a line break after `SEEALSO`.

In the documentation of `is_linear_structure` you need to add doctests to check that each kind of errors is raised appropriately.

Some small things:
- there is a macro for finite fields that makes it fancier in the documentation: use <code>\`\GF{p}\`</code> instead of <code>\`\`GF(p)\`\`</code>
- for finite fields, always use GF not F
- you should test the errors in the doctest (either in the `EXAMPLES` block or in a `TESTS` block)

Hi Vincent,

Running the doctests on both boolean_function.pyx and sbox.py gave no error on my machine.

```
rusydis-MacBook-Pro:sage rusydi$ ./sage -t src/sage/crypto/boolean_function.pyx src/sage/crypto/mq/sbox.py 
You are using pip version 8.1.2, however version 9.0.1 is available.
You should consider upgrading via the 'pip install --upgrade pip' command.
