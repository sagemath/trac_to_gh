Two functions related to the notion of linear structures in Boolean functions are implemented in this patch :

1. has_linear_structure() - determine whether the Boolean function has a nonzero linear structure
2. linear_structures() - obtain all linear structures of the Boolean functions as a vector subspace
3. is_linear_structure(val) - determine if val is a linear structure of this Boolean function

Similar functions are also implemented for mq.SBox.

<a id='comment:6'></a>There are doctest failures:
* you shouldn't use a random boolean function for doctest, it might have (with a small probability) some linear structure.
* remove a blank line

You can check locally that every test passes with the command `sage -t src/sage/crypto/boolean_function.pyx`.

You might use this syntax `ZZ(5).digits(base=2, padto=7)`.

`xrange` will disappear with python3, plus you don't really need it,
e.g. in `linear_structures`:

```sage
l = [ZZ(i).digits(base=2, padto=nvars)
     for i,ai in enumerate(self.autocorrelation())
     if abs(ai) == k]
```

Finally you might want to link this with `linear_structures` from `sage.crypto.mq.sbox.SBox` maybe adding a function `is_linear_structure` so that we can write

```sage
    all(s.component_function(b).is_linear_structure(alpha)
        for b,alpha,c in s.linear_structures()) == True)
```
but this is just a suggestion off the top of my head.

Hi Vincent,

Running the doctests on both boolean_function.pyx and sbox.py gave no error on my machine.

```
rusydis-MacBook-Pro:sage rusydi$ ./sage -t src/sage/crypto/boolean_function.pyx src/sage/crypto/mq/sbox.py 
You are using pip version 8.1.2, however version 9.0.1 is available.
You should consider upgrading via the 'pip install --upgrade pip' command.
