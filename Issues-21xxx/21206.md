This is to fix the tests in `sage.geometry.polyhedron.palp_database`, which were irregularly failing on Cygwin.  I don't think there's really anything Cygwin-specific about the issue, actually.  It just tends to exhibit itself on Cygwin because process shutdown takes longer, giving a wider window for the race condition described below.

This method had some code to force the PALP process to shut down at the end of iteration, rather than waiting for it to complete naturally.   However, this was failing randomly, at least on Windows, due to a race condition where the process could end between calling `poll()` and calling `terminate()` (and/or `kill()`)--the `terminate()` call would in turn cause an `OSError` ("No such process").

The newly added `terminate()` context manager does effectively the same thing as the old code, but also makes sure to close any streams, and handles the aforementioned race condition better.

Since the `terminate()` context manager is fairly generic, there is probably a better long-term home for it than here.

As discussed in #17864, a more general problem here is that `kill()` should not return an error when sent to already exited processes, and the fact that it does on Cygwin is probably a misfeature, so I have reported it upstream: https://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2016-08/msg00188.html  This issue isn't *necessarily* unique to Cygwin though.

**Update:** The Cygwin issue is now fixed upstream: https://cygwin.com/git/?p=newlib-cygwin.git;a=commitdiff;h=86f79af827729f3968d8b3b8f860ac29d200da0d  No harm in checking for this behavior regardless though.

The `t <= 4.0` part is to check that the sleep inside the `with terminate(sp, interval=5.0):` block was actually interrupted. If the interrupt didn't work, at least 5 seconds would have passed.

The `or t` part is a neat trick I learned from Robert Bradshaw. In case of a doctest failure (where `t <= 4.0` would be `False`), you see the actual value of `t` instead of just `False`.
