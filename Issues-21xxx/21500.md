To clarify a bit better what I mean:

1. The stuff you added about `ccache` really belongs with the part about `make` and not with `sage -b`.

2. Moreover, I would suggest to mention `make` first (so people become less drilled to use `sage -b` all the time) and `sage -b` after that.

For me, 1. must be fixed (hence needs_work), while 2. is an optional improvement that you may want to do.

Jeroen, the documentation as written is very clear on when to run `sage -b` and `make`. Since I'd assume it is mostly read by developers just getting started, the current order of instructions seems preferable to me. How many developers start out altering packages before Sage Python code?

I wanted my warning to be close to the statement "This should be quite fast", since that's what triggered the whole [discussion](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/jLUq1rqdOC4/SdjeLYQ4CgAJ) for me. I can see now that inserting the warning in the middle of the section is confusing, so I'll move it to the end. That way it will apply to all of the rebuilding cases described above it.

John, the installation guide doesn't make clear why one would want to install ccache. The only reason I did is because I regularly switch branches when working on tickets. That's a development issue, not an installation issue, so I think it belongs here.
