2. Moreover, I would suggest to mention `make` first (so people become less drilled to use `sage -b` all the time) and `sage -b` after that.

For me, 1. must be fixed (hence needs_work), while 2. is an optional improvement that you may want to do.

Almost everybody does! But, just like you, they do not realize that changing branches often means changing packages. That is exactly the problem with the current documentation (although I agree that this is orthogonal to this ticket).
