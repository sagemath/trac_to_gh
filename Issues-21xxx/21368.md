This shows how for example `vertex_colors` is used in both simple and multigprahs, but `vertex_shape` is not:

```
g = DiGraph({0: [1]})
g.show(vertex_shape='s', vertex_colors={'red': [0]})
g.allow_multiple_edges(True)
g.add_edge(0, 1)
g.show(vertex_shape='s', vertex_colors={'blue': [0]})
```

If I change `graph_plot.py` line 471 to be `if False:` it seems to work. So what is the reason to plot multigraph with `[circle(...) for ...]` and simple graph with `scatter_plot(...)`?

Hmm... Can you give an example of a graph that changes with this patch?

In general: We need a quite large test set to see that all combinations of graph/digraph, graph/pseudograph and graph/multigraph works. Also there can be several combinations of vertex sizes and colors etc. Edge coloring should work with or without edge labels etc. Something like

```
G = DiGraph(3)
G.allow_multiple_edges(True)
G.add_edge(1, 2, 'a')
G.add_edge(1, 2, 'b')
G.add_edge(2, 1, 'a')
G.add_edge(1, 3, 'd')
G.add_edge(1, 3, 'e')
G.add_edge(0, 3)
G.show(edge_colors={'red': [(1, 2, 'a')], 'blue': [(1,3)]})
```

should work.

<a id='comment:5'></a>Btw, this fails too:

```
G = graphs.CubeGraph(3)
G.show()
sage.graphs.graph_plot.DEFAULT_SHOW_OPTIONS['figsize'] = [2,2]
sage.graphs.graph_plot.DEFAULT_PLOT_OPTIONS['vertex_color'] = 'green'
G.show()
sage.graphs.graph_plot.DEFAULT_SHOW_OPTIONS['vertex_color'] = 'red'
G.show()
```

That is, `DEFAULT_SHOW_OPTIONS` accepts only some values whereas `DEFAULT_PLOT_OPTIONS` accepts them all.
