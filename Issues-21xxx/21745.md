For any subset of the real numbers we change the modulo operator to be

  x%y is the unique x' between [0,y) of the form x + ny with n integer

The main reason for the shift are the following incoherences

```
sage: 5 % 3
2
sage: 5. % 3.
-1.00000000000000
```
and

```
sage: 2/5 % 3
1
sage: 2./5. % 3.
0.400000000000000
```

The change mainly affects QQ and RR. This ticket concentrates on QQ. For other numbers see #21747.

The specifications for the transition period are as follows:
- both `//` and `%` with rational arguments will return rationals
- there will be a deprecation warning with `(p/q) % (r/s)` when `p/q` or `r/s` is not an exact integer
- there will be a deprecation warning with `(p/q) // (r/s)` when the result is not an exact integer
