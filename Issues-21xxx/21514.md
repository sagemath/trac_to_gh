<a id='comment:9'></a>Would it be possible to have some basic help message including examples:

```
$ sage -rst2ipynb -h
usage: rst2ipynb [-o OUTPUT] [-k KERNEL] [-v] [-d] [input]
rst2ipynb: error: unrecognized arguments: -h
```

like

```
$ sage -rst2sws -h
Usage: 

    sage -rst2sws [options] <source> <destination>

Generates Sage worksheet (.sws) from standalone reStructuredText source.

Example:

    sage -rst2sws file.rst file.sws

Remarks:

    About LaTeX:

        You can put LaTeX expression between backticks "`", dollar signs
        "$" or double dollar signs "$$". Math role is not supported yet
        (get involved!).

        Examples: `\\alpha`, $\\beta$ or $$\\gamma$$.

    About backslashes:

        In reStructuredText, backslashes must be escaped, otherwise they
        are ignored. This is not quite practical for Sage's purposes
        since backslashes are never escaped in the docstrings. If you
        write `\alpha`, $\beta$ or $$\gamma$$, add the line

            ..  escape-backslashes

        to the file and this script will consider all backslashes
        escaped. Alternatively, you may use the available options.

Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --escape-backslashes  Escape all backslashes in the input file before
                        execution. Default: disabled.
  --no-escape-backslashes
                        Disable escaping all backslashes in the input file
                        before execution. This overrides the presence of the
                        line '.. escape-backslashes' in the file, which can
                        also be used to escape all backslashes in the file.
```

using `argparse` or something?

Plan for the next version of rst2ipynb itself (in a later ticket)

- support for Python prompts `>>>>`

<a id='comment:28'></a>Dear Thierry, Nicolas,

After thinking about this, I suggest to merge into Sage the commit `017ecb7681c0159927cf8c5e6bf15391c651056e` which does not include Thierry's commit `​c0fe2a0`. Indeed, I asked for some nice help `sage -rst2ipynb -h` message, but after reconsideration I believe this is not the role of the bash code to do this. For the same reason as `sage -ipython -h` will give you the same thing as `ipython -h`. Therefore, I suggest to postpone the better help message to another ticket which will consist in updating `rst2ipynb` to a new version.

I wait for your approval before to do any change on this ticket.

(Git question: no branch are pointing to the commit `017ecb7681`, do I have to create a branch that links to this commit, or is the commit hash enough?)
