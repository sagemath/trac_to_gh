There are several errors in color handling of graph edges when the graph has multiedges and/or loops. Here are some blocks to show those:

```
# Third edge
g = Graph(); g.allow_multiple_edges(True)
g.add_edge(0, 1); g.add_edge(0, 1)
g.show(edge_colors={'red': [(0, 1)]})
```

```
# Direction of arrow
g = DiGraph(); g.allow_multiple_edges(True)
g.add_edge(0, 1); g.add_edge(1, 0)
g.show(edge_colors={'red': [(0, 1)]})
g.show()
```

```
# This must work even without multiedges=True
g = DiGraph();
g.add_edge(0, 1); g.add_edge(1, 0)
g.show(edge_colors={'red': [(0, 1)]})
```

```
# An example to check, failed at some point:
x = 101; y = 102
g = DiGraph(multiedges=True)
g.add_edge(0, 1, x); g.add_edge(0, 1, x); g.add_edge(0, 1, y); 
g.show(edge_colors={'red': [(0, 1, x)]})
```

```
# Labels in non-multigraph should also work in color settings:
g = DiGraph(loops=True)
g.add_edge(0, 1); g.add_edge(0, 2); g.add_edge(0, 0)
g.show(edge_colors={'red': [(0, 1)], 'blue': [(0, 2, 'xxx')]})
```

After this patch all of those works.

>This should fix the problem.

It does, and I can give it a positive review if you want. However, there is another bug, see direction of arrows:

```
g = DiGraph(); g.allow_multiple_edges(True)
g.add_edge(0, 1); g.add_edge(1, 0)
g.show(edge_colors={'red': [(0, 1)]})
g.show()
```

After your patch this will become a one arrow only, so there is bug in both with and without this patch. Do you want to look at that, or want me to make that another ticket?

The additional error you identified arises because currently unspecificed edges are first sorted by vertex and then tested against specified edges by edge label. If there are no edge labels then unspecified edges with the same vertices as those already specified will be ignored.

I replaced the test by labels with a test against an explicit list of edges already drawn. That should be more robust, but please test it in all the ways you can imagine.

I've also taken out the code you put in for #21053 because the default edge color is always available from the default options. This makes the code more consistent.

It works with `g.allow_multiple_edges(True)`.

Jori, try testing this update please. The last error was caused because the value returned by `self._graph.edge_label` on line 634(old)/641(new) changes depending on whether `allow_multiple_edges()` is true or false.

To clean up the code I've added the method `append_or_set()`, since the same test against `edges_to_draw[]` occurs five times.
