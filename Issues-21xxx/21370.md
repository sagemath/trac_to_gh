There are several errors in color handling of graph edges when the graph has multiedges and/or loops. Here are some blocks to show those:

```
# Third edge
g = Graph(); g.allow_multiple_edges(True)
g.add_edge(0, 1); g.add_edge(0, 1)
g.show(edge_colors={'red': [(0, 1)]})
```

```
# Direction of arrow
g = DiGraph(); g.allow_multiple_edges(True)
g.add_edge(0, 1); g.add_edge(1, 0)
g.show(edge_colors={'red': [(0, 1)]})
g.show()
```

```
# This must work even without multiedges=True
g = DiGraph();
g.add_edge(0, 1); g.add_edge(1, 0)
g.show(edge_colors={'red': [(0, 1)]})
```

```
# An example to check, failed at some point:
x = 101; y = 102
g = DiGraph(multiedges=True)
g.add_edge(0, 1, x); g.add_edge(0, 1, x); g.add_edge(0, 1, y); 
g.show(edge_colors={'red': [(0, 1, x)]})
```

```
# Labels in non-multigraph should also work in color settings:
g = DiGraph(loops=True)
g.add_edge(0, 1); g.add_edge(0, 2); g.add_edge(0, 0)
g.show(edge_colors={'red': [(0, 1)], 'blue': [(0, 2, 'xxx')]})
```

After this patch all of those works.

It does, and I can give it a positive review if you want. However, there is another bug, see direction of arrows:

```
g = DiGraph(); g.allow_multiple_edges(True)
g.add_edge(0, 1); g.add_edge(1, 0)
g.show(edge_colors={'red': [(0, 1)]})
g.show()
```

After your patch this will become a one arrow only, so there is bug in both with and without this patch. Do you want to look at that, or want me to make that another ticket?

I tried quite hard to found more errors on colors, but did not found any. I tested with and without loops, with and wihtout multiple edges, and with some options to `edge_colors`, `edge_style` and even `vertex_size`, `graph_border` and so on.

+There are several errors in color handling of graph edges when the graph has multiedges and/or loops. Here are some blocks to show those:
 
+```
+# Third edge
+g = Graph(); g.allow_multiple_edges(True)
+g.add_edge(0, 1); g.add_edge(0, 1)
+g.show(edge_colors={'red': [(0, 1)]})
+```
+
+```
+# Direction of arrow
+g = DiGraph(); g.allow_multiple_edges(True)
+g.add_edge(0, 1); g.add_edge(1, 0)
+g.show(edge_colors={'red': [(0, 1)]})
+g.show()
+```
+
+```
+# This must work even without multiedges=True
+g = DiGraph();
+g.add_edge(0, 1); g.add_edge(1, 0)
+g.show(edge_colors={'red': [(0, 1)]})
+```
+
+```
+# An example to check, failed at some point:
+x = 101; y = 102
+g = DiGraph(multiedges=True)
+g.add_edge(0, 1, x); g.add_edge(0, 1, x); g.add_edge(0, 1, y); 
+g.show(edge_colors={'red': [(0, 1, x)]})
+```
+
+```
+# Labels in non-multigraph should also work in color settings:
+g = DiGraph(loops=True)
+g.add_edge(0, 1); g.add_edge(0, 2); g.add_edge(0, 0)
+g.show(edge_colors={'red': [(0, 1)], 'blue': [(0, 2, 'xxx')]})
+```
+
+After this patch all of those works.

I can not say that I understand every bit of the code, but it seems reasonable, I did not found errors by testing, and possible bugs won't affect other parts of Sage.
