There are several errors in color handling of graph edges when the graph has multiedges and/or loops. Here are some blocks to show those:

```
# Third edge
g = Graph(); g.allow_multiple_edges(True)
g.add_edge(0, 1); g.add_edge(0, 1)
g.show(edge_colors={'red': [(0, 1)]})
```

```
# Direction of arrow
g = DiGraph(); g.allow_multiple_edges(True)
g.add_edge(0, 1); g.add_edge(1, 0)
g.show(edge_colors={'red': [(0, 1)]})
g.show()
```

```
# This must work even without multiedges=True
g = DiGraph();
g.add_edge(0, 1); g.add_edge(1, 0)
g.show(edge_colors={'red': [(0, 1)]})
```

```
# An example to check, failed at some point:
x = 101; y = 102
g = DiGraph(multiedges=True)
g.add_edge(0, 1, x); g.add_edge(0, 1, x); g.add_edge(0, 1, y); 
g.show(edge_colors={'red': [(0, 1, x)]})
```

```
# Labels in non-multigraph should also work in color settings:
g = DiGraph(loops=True)
g.add_edge(0, 1); g.add_edge(0, 2); g.add_edge(0, 0)
g.show(edge_colors={'red': [(0, 1)], 'blue': [(0, 2, 'xxx')]})
```

After this patch all of those works.

>This should fix the problem.


It does, and I can give it a positive review if you want. However, there is another bug, see direction of arrows:

```
g = DiGraph(); g.allow_multiple_edges(True)
g.add_edge(0, 1); g.add_edge(1, 0)
g.show(edge_colors={'red': [(0, 1)]})
g.show()
```

After your patch this will become a one arrow only, so there is bug in both with and without this patch. Do you want to look at that, or want me to make that another ticket?

Now this fails:

```
g = DiGraph();
g.add_edge(0, 1); g.add_edge(1, 0)
g.show(edge_colors={'red': [(0, 1)]})
```

It works with `g.allow_multiple_edges(True)`.

I can try to get more failing examples today.

Jori, try testing this update please. The last error was caused because the value returned by `self._graph.edge_label` on line 634(old)/641(new) changes depending on whether `allow_multiple_edges()` is true or false.

To clean up the code I've added the method `append_or_set()`, since the same test against `edges_to_draw[]` occurs five times.
