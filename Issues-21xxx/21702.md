We have the following:

```
sage: SymmetricFunctions(FractionField(QQ['q','t']))
Symmetric Functions over Fraction Field of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in q, t over Rational Field
sage: SymmetricFunctions(FractionField(ZZ['q']))
Symmetric Functions over Fraction Field of Univariate Polynomial Ring in q over Integer Ring
sage: SymmetricFunctions(FractionField(ZZ['q','t']))
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
```
However, the last one works with Sage 7.3.

I don't think this is caused by #12439 as the trace goes through libsingular.

Works for me on Sage 7.4.rc1:

```
sage: SymmetricFunctions(FractionField(QQ['q','t']))
Symmetric Functions over Fraction Field of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in q, t over Rational Field
sage: SymmetricFunctions(FractionField(ZZ['q']))
Symmetric Functions over Fraction Field of Univariate Polynomial Ring in q over Integer Ring
sage: SymmetricFunctions(FractionField(ZZ['q','t']))
Symmetric Functions over Fraction Field of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in q, t over Integer Ring
```
