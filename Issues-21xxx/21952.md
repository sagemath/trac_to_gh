As discussed in [this thread](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/uHsTOd5sTxY/ivpNHT1MAwAJ), cddlib's autotools files are quite outdated and in due for modernization.  In fact, somehow, its `configure.in` is not even compatible with the version of `automake` that the `Makefile.in`s were generated with.  This makes it difficult/impossible to make update cddlib's Makefiles (see #15872).

I reworked the latest version of cddlib (0.94h, though this work would also apply to at least the previous version, 0.94g) to use automake 1.14.1 (currently the highest version in sage, though #21196 would update that to 1.15).

I also cleaned up the contents of the tarball (removed .DS_Store files and other crud), and made it so that `make distcheck` works.

I've attached an updated upstream tarball, as well as a set of patches to the original upstream that should reproduce it.

**Keywords:** cddlib autotools

**Upstream:** Reported upstream. Developers acknowledge bug.

**Author:** Erik Bray

**Resolution:** wontfix

I wouldn't have thought that `ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS = -I m4` was necessary once you have `AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIR([m4])` but I could be wrong.

There are other things I am thinking off that can be done (VPATH) but we may not want to do everything at once.

"In the future other Autotools will automatically check the contents of AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIRS, but at the moment it is more portable to add the macro directory to ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS in Makefile.am, which is where the tools currently look."

That future is now, but I guess it still suggests it just in case.

What I don't understand is what the process is (though it seems like there is one?) of providing an alternative upstream tarball for one of the packages in Sage, such that is distributed to all the mirrors, etc.

I've attached such a tarball, as well as the patches that reproduce it from the original upstream tarball.

The problem here was that the source tarball itself was broken in various ways.

Most of the process is described here: http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/packaging.html#when-to-patch-when-to-repackage-when-to-autoconfiscate (and in the following sections).

The release manager adds the "upstream tar ball" to the server when the ticket is merged. Usually people just provide an URL in the description, rather than attaching it to trac. 

Instead of attaching patches here, use a public git repository. Make an `spkg-src` that can regenerate your "upstream tar ball" from the repository. See `bliss/spkg-src` for an example.

Some of the patches don't apply anymore so I rebase them. I am trying to convince the author of the beauty of github (or similar) and he wants to have a look. I proposed a new home for upstream here: https://github.com/cddlib/cddlib.

And a modified version of your patches is here: https://github.com/cddlib/cddlib/pull/1
