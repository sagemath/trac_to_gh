Every grepping of source code is easier if there is just one way to do something. Also some user might wonder if there is a difference between `...` and `....:`. Hence I suggest mass change from old-style doctest continuation lines.

This part does that in rings and misc folder.

Done by

```
find src/sage/rings src/sage/misc -name '*.py' -or -name '*.pyx' | xargs perl -e 's|^( *)\.\.\.  |\1....:|g;' -p -i.bak
```
