Wasn't sure, perhaps the method name `is_acyclic` is better?

Could you give a reference (a book or an article) to the notion in the docstring? For example if `_berge_` makes more sense than is_acyclic because it is used in several references. Is it the Berge from the book on graph theory? Could you then give that reference.

You can put your complete name in the Author field.

What is the most common usage? is_acyclic I would say is more explicit than `_berge_`

Then, in the docstring, you could mention that it is also sometimes called "Berge acyclic".

All test passed on Sage7.5.b3.

Thanks for your feedback!

I will add the proper definitions + references here, and later on I will add them to the docstrings.

a *k*-uniform **Berge cycle** of length is a cyclic list of distinct *k*-sets *F_1,...,F_l*, l>1, and distinct vertices *C = {v_1,...,v_l}* such that for each *1<=i<=l*, *F_i* contains *v_i* and *v_{i+1}* (where *v_{l+1} = v_1*).

This definition appears, for example, here:

- Füredi, Zoltán, and Tao Jiang. "Hypergraph Turán numbers of linear cycles." Journal of Combinatorial Theory, Series A 123.1 (2014): 252-270.

According to Wikipedia, this definition goes back to Claude Berge's book **Graphs and Hypergraphs**.
I saw it in the book by the following book of Berge:

- Berge, Claude. Hypergraphs: combinatorics of finite sets. Vol. 45. Elsevier, 1984.

It is not difficult to see that a hypergraph contains a Berge cycle if and only if its incidence graph contains a cycle.  This is also mentioned in the wikipedia page about hypergraphs.

The notions of **Berge-cyclic** and **Berge-acyclic** appear, for example, in the following paper:

- Fagin, Ronald. "Degrees of acyclicity for hypergraphs and relational database schemes." Journal of the ACM (JACM) 30.3 (1983): 514-550.

According to that paper, a hypergraph is Berge-cyclic if it has a Berge cycle; otherwise, it is Berge-acyclic.

Since this is the first known notion of cycles in hypergraphs, it makes sense to call it simply **cyclic** or **acyclic**, and these are indeed the notions that Berge has used; however, it seems like later authors have used the **Berge-** prefix, to make it less vague. I think, therefore, that we should keep the `berge_` prefix, and perhaps also add a `is_berge_cyclic` method as well.

- Could you make the reference labels uniform? You added `[Fag83]` and `[FT14]` while all others are of the form `[Fe1997]`, `[Fu1993]`.

- typo in the doc: `of length is a`

- I don't think it is necessary to have both `is_berge_acyclic` and `is_berge_cyclic`. Such duplication will moreover slow down the tab completion

```
sage: H.is_berge_<TAB>   # <-- nothing will happen with your version
```

- In the definition you do not mention that the hypergraph needs to be uniform but you do in the code

Looks good to me.

Some small issues:

In the documentation, "of length is a", I guess it lacks an \ell

In the references: it seems that there is no fixed style, but you can write the title of the references in italics using *asterisks*

<a id='comment:29'>Comment 29:</a>
After going through all the comment and definition of berge_acyclicity on Wikipedia[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypergraph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypergraph)

We can add the following methods with proper reference and documentation

```
def is_berge_acyclic(self):
    if not self.is_uniform()
        raise TypeError("Berge cycles are defined for uniform hypergraphs only")

    return self.incidence_graph().is_forest()
```

---

```
def is_berge_cyclic(self):
    if not self.is_uniform():
        raise TypeError("Berge cycles are defined for uniform hypergraphs only")

    return not self.incidence_graph().is_forest()
```

If currently, nobody is pursuing this ticket, Maybe I can give it a try.

I have added `is_berge_cyclic` method for uniform hypergraphs with proper documentation and doc-test. \\
I have intentionally left `is_berge_acyclic`, because it kind of seemed duplicate in some sense.\\
Any feedback will be helpful

> Why raising an error and not simply returning False ?

As it is mentioned in Wikipedia -[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypergraph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypergraph)\\

"In contrast with ordinary undirected graphs for which there is a single natural notion of cycles and acyclic graphs, there are multiple natural non-equivalent definitions of acyclicity for hypergraphs which collapse to ordinary graph acyclicity for the special case of ordinary graphs."\\

Due to the above-mentioned comment and also the definition which is written in the documentation of the method is for uniform hypergraph. That's why it is raising error for not being uniform, to be on the safe side.\\

PS: Although, I didn't find any text, restricting Berge acyclicity to uniform hypergraph. And also I am no expert in the matter of hypergraphs. So we can discuss whether to keep it as such or modify it.

OK, let it as is.

Some corrections / complements

```diff
-        Test whether uniform hypergraph is Berge-Cyclic.
+        Check whether ``self`` is a Berge-Cyclic uniform hypergraph.
```

```diff
-        For more information, see [Fag1983]_
+        For more information, see [Fag1983]_ and :wikipedia:`Hypergraph`.

Also, have you checked corner cases like empty hypergraph ?
