I would like it to be default for most users. But then for developers it might be easier if it is not.

Anyways, it seems that fix for this problem is removing two empty lines. Someone with more time should check what is the real problem.

Yes.  It would be good anyway for different purposes to have something like a "Sage developer mode" which is not enabled by default (or in stable releases, say).

Is it something that should go into the Sage Developer Guide (in order to avoid it in the future)?

Some patchbot should compile with the flag and another without flag.

I doubt how many developer or reviewer would compile documentation twise just to be sure.

I don't see the point of "optionally" removing `TESTS` blocks. That creates an interesting paradox: the people who know how to remove the `TESTS` blocks are precisely the people who would be most interesting in seeing the `TESTS` blocks.

Even the online documentation still has the `TESTS` blocks and that's the single place where they should not be shown.

(I know this is all orthogonal to this ticket, but I just don't understand why somebody would add an option to remove `TESTS` blocks but then not make it the default).

```

match the regular expression which is supposed to signify the end of a `TESTS` block: a word all in caps followed by a colon (to match things like "ALGORITHM:" or "REFERENCES:" which we want to include in the documentation).

I fully agree (and by the way think this belongs to this ticket).

Add `--include-test-blocks` for docbuilding and make `--no-tests` the default, probably completely removing that option.

IMHO `TESTS:` should never end up in PDFs for example; it *might* be convenient for some to review code / docstrings using HTML output, but those could explicitly ask for including them when building their docs.  (Just wondering whether that's a "global" option that eventually triggers complete rebuild when changed.)

The problem I see (OTOH) is that `EXAMPLES:` and `TESTS:` are often rather randomly used; many doctests that no user would ever be interested in are in `EXAMPLES:`, while some `TESTS:` sections on the other hand contain examples that would be valuable to users as well.  But that's just my uneducated impression I got over the last years, and I cannot give any recent examples, right now at least.

I think that it was discussed when add the switch. But I don't remember what was the reason to not make it default.

The online (terminal) help for `sage.libs.pari.pari_instance` gives the following:

I agree. Most common problem is to not have a `TESTS` block at all. I have changed those in my Grand Poset Documentaion Polishing Project. :=)

I guess this is partly because `--no-tests` is new and not the default. It makes much less sense to differentiate between examples and tests when both are shown to the user.

[snip]

Yes, and this is why I made [comment above](#comment%3A8) (plus looking at the documentation and source code in `misc/sagedoc.py`).

The original ticket #19503 was precisely about skipping `TESTS` blocks in introspection; the focus was not on the reference manual, and that's one reason the default is the way it is. Plus there was some discussion of the concern Leif expressed above, that some `TESTS` blocks have useful information, so if we remove them from the reference manual, we lose helpful information.

So here's the culprit (`src/sage/misc/sagedoc.py`, line 298 ff.):

```python
    # end_of_block: match a line starting with whitespace, then Sphinx
    # directives of the form ".. foo:". This will match directive
    # names "foo" containing letters of either case, hyphens,
    # underscores.
    # Also match uppercase text followed by a colon, like
    # "REFERENCES:" or "ALGORITHM:".
    end_of_block = re.compile('[ ]*(\.\.[ ]+[-_A-Za-z]+|[A-Z]+):')
    # header: match a string of hyphens, or other characters which are
    # valid markers for ReST headers: - = ` : ' " ~ _ ^ * + # < >
```

Currently, only another `TEST`[`S`]`:`[`:`] doesn't terminate the block to skip:

```python
...
        if not skip:
            m = tests_block.match(l)
            if m:
                skip = True
                indentation = m.group(1)
            else:
                s += "\n"
                s += l
        else:
            if end_of_block.match(l) and not tests_block.match(l):
                skip = False
                s += "\n"
                s += l
...
```

So we'd either have to whitelist PARI's `IFAC:` to not end a `TESTS` block, or (more seriously) have to explicitly look for *all* possible / "valid" section names (like `AUTHORS`, `REFERENCES`, etc.).

Not sure whether there is at all a complete list of such.  (AFAIK, it's just informal convention to use this or that.)

Works for me modulo adding more section names.

I was about to write that `l.find(indentation)` is *generally wrong* (and should be `l.startswith(indentation)`), but then suddenly realized that `.find()` is not C's `strstr()` and even works for the empty string... m)

I'm not entirely sure yet your approach works though.  Deeeeeep thinking required...

But anyway, I'll (ab)use my approach to find all kinds of section names (and misspellings) later...

(We could eventually also correct then.)

It won't work for e.g.

```
TESTS:

    ...

FOO:
    bar
```
will it?

(`FOO:` matches end_block and has the same indentation as `TESTS:` and doesn't match tests_block either, so you'd continue skipping.)

to make sure the match is indented more than "TESTS" was. I haven't tested it much (only on the example from pari_instance).

Yes.

I think Sphinx just looks for indentations. It treats them specially if they are preceded by a Sphinx directive like `.. NOTE::` or `.. MATH::`, but it doesn't care about `EXXAMMPLES::` or `TESTS::`, etc., if it doesn't start with `'.. '`.

.. EXAMPLES::

    sage: blah
    blah

Oh, and also

    sage: blah
    blah
```
as a single EXAMPLES block.

Nope, needs work.

There's an `else` missing to handle the case that a `TESTS` block is just terminated by an "ordinary" line (not matching the patterns), which of course has to be less indented than the starting `TESTS:`[`:`] (otherwise it wouldn't terminate the block).

See for example `src/sage/rings/asymptotic/asymptotic_expansion_generators.py`, where incidentally (because of the `::`) "only two" (non-empty) lines after the `TESTS` block get eaten up:

```python
r"""
Common Asymptotic Expansions

.. WARNING::

    As this code is experimental, a warning is thrown when an
    asymptotic ring (or an associated structure) is created for the
    first time in a session (see
    :class:`sage.misc.superseded.experimental`).

    TESTS::

        sage: AsymptoticRing(growth_group='z^ZZ * log(z)^QQ', coefficient_ring=ZZ)
        doctest:...: FutureWarning: This class/method/function is marked as
        experimental. It, its functionality or its interface might change
        without a formal deprecation.
        See http://trac.sagemath.org/17601 for details.
        Asymptotic Ring <z^ZZ * log(z)^QQ> over Integer Ring


Asymptotic expansions in SageMath can be built through the
``asymptotic_expansions`` object. It contains generators for common
asymptotic expressions. For example,
::

    sage: asymptotic_expansions.Stirling('n', precision=5)
    sqrt(2)*sqrt(pi)*e^(n*log(n))*(e^n)^(-1)*n^(1/2) +
    1/12*sqrt(2)*sqrt(pi)*e^(n*log(n))*(e^n)^(-1)*n^(-1/2) +
    1/288*sqrt(2)*sqrt(pi)*e^(n*log(n))*(e^n)^(-1)*n^(-3/2) +
    O(e^(n*log(n))*(e^n)^(-1)*n^(-5/2))

generates the first 5 summands of Stirling's approximation formula for
factorials.

...
"""
```

(IMHO you shouldn't need `previous` anyway, except for adding a blank line, in which case you don't have to keep the actual contents, only maybe the indentation / number of spaces, but I'm not even sure that's necessary.)

EDIT: Removed *[... has to be less] **(or equally)** [indented than ...]* again I added afterwards, because that's wrong.

A few comments: you need `previous` in the `header` case, since the previous line is the actual title of that header. Were you thinking of getting rid of it in general?

Good catch on the example in `asymptotic_expansion_generators.py`, but I think that's pretty rare. What may also occur, unfortunately, is something like

```
    TESTS::

        blah

    We should also test x::

        blah # should be considered part of the TESTS block

    Now the tests are over, so let's make some remarks.
    (This should not be part of the TESTS block.)
```
I don't know how to catch this. Maybe TESTS should be a Sphinx directive after all (but not on this ticket).

If you have time to work on your proposed changes, please go ahead.

So get rid of the leading space for the regexp for `header`, and don't bother in that case checking if the line starts with `indentation`?

I don't think we can, other than by detailing the documentation with a warning regarding exactly that case, and perhaps adding a tool to easily show what will get removed (without [looking at] HTML output; also since what `foo?` shows isn't always that readable).




> Maybe TESTS should be a Sphinx directive after all (but not on this ticket).

Well, you already mentioned the drawback; then we'd have to split almost any existing TESTS block into several.

I don't think that there is necessary a problem with ending a `TESTS` block by something matching `[A-Z]+:`. The problem is that indentation should be considered too: line which are more indented than the `TESTS:` header should always be considered as part of the `TESTS` block.

Replying to [@jdemeyer](#comment%3A53):

Rebased to 7.6.beta3.

To help with reviewing: this does nothing explicitly with Sphinx, because that work was done in the earlier ticket dealing with TESTS blocks. This modifies the function that detects when TESTS blocks start and end, so it is plain Python dealing with regular expressions.

Replying to [@jhpalmieri](#comment%3A74):

> To help with reviewing: this does nothing explicitly with Sphinx, because that work was done in the earlier ticket dealing with TESTS blocks. This modifies the function that detects when TESTS blocks start and end, so it is plain Python dealing with regular expressions. Sphinx then uses this to process docstrings, but it was already doing that.

Thanks for the explanation. This was the first time I look at Python implementation of regexps, but it seems to be clear. I mark this as a positive review.

(Sidenote: We should have something better! I mean a structured way so that Sphinx (or whatever we would use) would know the blocks and one could say something like `--docskip=tests,algorithm` or like.)
