sage: from sage.coding.codecan.codecan import PartitionRefinementLinearCode
sage: PartitionRefinementLinearCode.__new__(PartitionRefinementLinearCode)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occurred.
This probably occurred because a *compiled* module has a bug
in it and is not properly wrapped with sig_on(), sig_off().
Python will now terminate.

This seems to fix the segfault reported at #21628. Note that the segfault actually has nothing to do with the interrupt, since it can be reproduced by just calling `__new__` (see ticket description).

I understand the modification of `sig_malloc` to `check_malloc` and that you can then remove the memory checks.

Actually, that move is not super important, it's partially a style issue. Typically, `__cinit__` should do minimal initialization to construct a valid object (in the sense that operations with it at least should not segfault). Then `__init__` is used to actually initialize the object from the given input data.

> And how could the class work at all before when `__new__` crashes immediately?


It's actually not `__new__` which crashes, but `__dealloc__`. The command in the ticket description is invalid (it's missing an `n` argument), so a Python exception gets raised. But then the partially-constructed object is destroyed by `__dealloc__` and *that* crashes.
