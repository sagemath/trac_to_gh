Frédéric, this works with `intervals_poset` written by you; it uses `constructor = LatticePoset`. Also `relabel` works, it uses `constructor = FiniteLatticePoset . . . return constructor(. . ., category=self.category(), . . .)`.

What is the difference, and which one is better?

(Sidenote: As I work with this, maybe the parameter could be also `('bottom', None)` to add only another bound.)

The difference is that `LatticePoset` redirects to `Poset`, which does additional (pre)processing of the input. `FiniteLatticePoset` assumes the data is the correct format. So the latter is better for speed, the former is better for easier coding.
