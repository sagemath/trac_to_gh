This part of `src/setup.py` should be moved inside some distutils command:

```
#########################################################
### Clean
#########################################################

print('Cleaning up stale installed files....')
t = time.time()
from sage_setup.clean import clean_install_dir
output_dirs = SITE_PACKAGES + glob.glob(os.path.join(SAGE_SRC, 'build', 'lib*'))
for output_dir in output_dirs:
    print('- cleaning {0}'.format(output_dir))
    clean_install_dir(output_dir, python_packages, python_modules,
            ext_modules, python_data_files)
print('Finished cleaning, time: %.2f seconds.' % (time.time() - t))
```
