The title "Get rid of file descriptor 7 hack" is different from the description "build/make/Makefile should be written within an AC_CONFIG_COMMANDS procedure". Do you want to fix both things here? Can you please clarify?

And honestly, I think there is nothing wrong with the "file descriptor 7 hack". `autoconf` itself uses similar hacks internally.

Here's my proposed solution to this (I updated the ticket to mention `AC_CONFIG_FILE` since that's what this uses).

This adds a `build/make/Makefile.in` template that is used to generated `build/make/Makefile` in `config.status`.  The `configure` script now just collects values for some variables that are inserted into the Makefile template.  I tried to keep as much actual Makefile syntax out of the output variables as possible, sticking mostly to just lists of package names that are operated over.  Most of the rules for building packages are generated by the Makefile itself in `$(eval ...)` loops.  The end result I think is actually cleaner and easier to understand.

If any of this should be controversial, it may be the use of some more advanced GNU make constructs, the portability of which I'm not sure.  This was tested with GNU make 3.81 (about 11 years old), and 4.2.1 (very recent).  That said, it's using some relatively advanced GNU make features that may not be available in other makes.  I think it's still *better*, but if need be more of the Makefile generation could be pushed back into `configure`, but still provided via output variables, instead of writing directly to a file.

Increased the priority since I have other build system work that would likely depend on this, and also because it makes some non-trivial performance improvements, especially on Cygwin.

I think the proposed changes are an improvement. I find the proposed setup easier to read, understand, and modify than the previous echos in configure. It also feels closer to the intended way of using autoconf. I am not sure if the resulting Makefile is harder to read, I don't really see why, in any case, I can see why we would like to get rid of the `echo` hack which makes it quite annoying to edit `configure` imho.

Some comments (apart from these minor issues, I would not mind setting this to positive review):

* I might be totally misunderstanding something but the following comment does not actually apply to the `Makefile.in`, does it?

```
+# This file has been automatically generated by
+#   /home/embray/src/sagemath/sage/config.status
+# You should not edit it by hand
```
    I think that some general comment about sage-the-distribution would be nice here and some comment on what transforms this file to which other file.
* I don't really understand the following comment

```
+    # If $need_to_install_{PKG_NAME} is set to no, then set inst_<pkgname> to
+    # some dummy file to skip the installation.
```
    So, I guess `pkgname` and `PKG_NAME` are the same? But where is `inst_<pkgname>` being set below? (Only indirectly in `Makefile.in`, right?)
* I don't see where you are obscuring anything here. (You copied it over and it should probably go into the `.in` file.)

```
+    # Below we have to obscure A""M_V_at, or autoconf would complain:
+    # "error: possibly undefined macro: A""M_V_at"
```
* I would like the `configure.ac` to contain a `#` comment at the top which explains how this all works, in particular how this differs from a standard autoconf/automake setup.

I've actually been working off-and-on in my spare time on my own Python implementation of make.  It has a name but until I feel ready to post the code it's a secret :-)  It supports POSIX-compatible Makefiles but it also has its own pure-Python format that lets you write make rules in Python, including all the high-level constructs thereof.\n\nIn the meantime I don't really see how that would solve anything though.",

> Allow me to reboot this discussion in a hopefully constructive way... what would you think of using some high-level programming like Python to write the `build/make/Makefile`? That would solve the problem that `configure.ac` is a slow mess. On the other hand, we could write actual `Makefile` rules instead of using macros.


It's funny you suggest that.  I've actually been working off-and-on in my spare time on my own Python implementation of make.  It has a name but until I feel ready to post the code it's a secret :-)  It supports POSIX-compatible Makefiles but it also has its own pure-Python format that lets you write make rules in Python, including all the high-level constructs thereof.

In the meantime I don't really see how that would solve anything though.

Oops, I'm not sure how that got there since I wrote this six months ago :) It might be that I started from editing a generated file exactly as it says not to do. But let me double-check that `config.status` isn't *actually* putting that there because that would be a bug, and a bad one at that.

That would help, though I'm not sure where to put it.  It would be nice to have some documentation about though, as it took me a while to wrap my head around too.

Yes, maybe this could be spelled more consistently.

This definitely deserves better documentation (most of how this works is carried over from the existing Makefile--I really didn't change much...)  The actual physical (as in, a real file) targets associate with each package are the "stamp" files installed to `$SAGE_LOCAL/var/lib/sage/installed/<pkg_name>-<pkg_version>`.  Within the Makefile the paths to these files are stored in variables named `$(inst_<pkg_name>)`.

What this is referring to is that for packages which are not actually installed into Sage (e.g. we use the system version), instead of pointing to a real stamp file, the `$(inst_<pkg_name>)` just points to a dummy file indicating "yes, this dependency is satisfied".  This way we don't need to *remove* that package as a dependency of any other package.  It's just trivially satisfied.

Anyways, I'll see if I can make that comment clearer.

Carried over from the original configure.ac.  It's not relevant now anywhere so can just be deleted.

Okay, maybe that's a decent place to put it...

I'm going to try to do a bit of reformatting to make it a little easier to read.

One thing I'll point out that I haven't explicitly mentioned yet: I asked a few people about this before doing the work (I forget who) but at the time everyone seemed to agree that it would be fine to require GNU make, as there are other packages in Sage that require it, so building the full Sage-the-distribution doesn't work with any other make implementation anyways.

I suppose we could do that though.

> 2. We should detect `SHELL` rather than setting it to /bin/bash, because there are systems where it lives in e.g. /usr/bin/bash (https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/TheCaseForTheUsrMerge/)


Right; originally we had <code> SHELL = \`command -v bash\` </code> here.  I'll fix that.

> 3. Is Bash needed for the makefile at all? If we replace "source" with ".", does anything else crash with POSIX sh?


I'm not sure it's necessarily strictly needed for the makefile itself, but it in turn calls scripts that require bash, so I don't see any advantage in not just forcing bash in the makefile as well.

Last commit made the templates look a bit less noisy.  For example, before:

```
define NORMAL_PACKAGE_templ
$$(INST)/$(1)-$$(vers_$(1)): $$(foreach dep,$$(deps_$(1)),$$(inst_$$(dep)))
	+$(AM_V_at)sage-logger -p '$(SAGE_SPKG) $(1)-$$(vers_$(1))' '$(SAGE_LOGS)/$(1)-$$(vers_$(1)).log'
 
$(1): $$(INST)/$(1)-$$(vers_$(1))
 
$(1)-clean:
	rm -rf $$(INST)/$(1)-$$(vers_$(1))
endef
```

and after:

```
define NORMAL_PACKAGE_templ
$$(INST)/$(1)-$(2): $(3)
	+$(AM_V_at)sage-logger -p '$$(SAGE_SPKG) $(1)-$(2)' '$$(SAGE_LOGS)/$(1)-$(2).log'
 
$(1): $$(INST)/$(1)-$(2)
 
$(1)-clean:
	rm -rf $$(INST)/$(1)-$(2)
endef
```

I also added the `DEBUG_RULES` flag that I mentioned on sage-devel.  If you run the generated makefile in dry-run mode with this flag defined you can see exactly what the templates are outputting:

```
$ make -f build/make/Makefile -n DEBUG_RULES=1
# Rules for standard packages
$(INST)/4ti2-1.6.7:   $(inst_zlib)  $(inst_mpir)  $(inst_glpk)
        +sage-logger -p '$(SAGE_SPKG) 4ti2-1.6.7' '$(SAGE_LOGS)/4ti2-1.6.7.log'

4ti2: $(INST)/4ti2-1.6.7

4ti2-clean:
        rm -rf $(INST)/4ti2-1.6.7

$(INST)/alabaster-0.7.10:   $(inst_python2)  |  $(inst_pip)
        +sage-logger -p '$(SAGE_SPKG) alabaster-0.7.10' '$(SAGE_LOGS)/alabaster-0.7.10.log'
...

I really hope that you are right and that this won't turn in a "I told you so" scenario.

I'll stop protesting for now. There is not much to discuss further anyway, we each know the other's opinions.
