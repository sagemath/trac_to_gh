The new code uses `point_coordinates` provided by `ProjectiveGeometryDesign`, and they are only available with the default algorithm. Needless to say, the current `AffineGeometryDesign` does not provide `algorithm` choice.

         We ensure that the iteration order is so that all matrices with given

         It would be faster to generate the pivots columns following a Gray code.
