The new code uses `point_coordinates` provided by `ProjectiveGeometryDesign`, and they are only available with the default algorithm. Needless to say, the current `AffineGeometryDesign` does not provide `algorithm` choice.

- I implemented a more direct version
- did some cleanup in `AffineGeometryDesign` and `ProjectiveGeometryDesign`
- added a non-trivial check in case `check=True`

Please review.
