The new code uses `point_coordinates` provided by `ProjectiveGeometryDesign`, and they are only available with the default algorithm. Needless to say, the current `AffineGeometryDesign` does not provide `algorithm` choice.

- I implemented a more direct version
- did some cleanup in `AffineGeometryDesign` and `ProjectiveGeometryDesign`
- added a non-trivial check in case `check=True`

One question: your new code in `AffineGeometryDesign` uses `reduced_echelon_matrix_iterator` in a way that assumes a particular order the latter traverses matrices in question. This order is not documented, and can be changed, breaking your code in turn. I don't like this.
(One way out would be to document the order produced by `reduced_echelon_matrix_iterator` and add the relevant tests there)
