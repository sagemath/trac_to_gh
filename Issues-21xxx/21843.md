As discussed beginning [comment:20:ticket:21682 here], the current `.cython_version` stamp does not always accurately reflect all Cython build options which, if changed, should trigger a rebuild of Cython sources.

It would be good to have a more detailed `.cython_version` that includes all arguments to `cythonize()` and perhaps all `Cython.Compiler.Options`.

Although the values of these options are generally simple types, the `compiler_directives` dict alone makes this data structure complicated enough that an ad hoc format like the one currently used is not justified--instead a json-formatted file should work.
