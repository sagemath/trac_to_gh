2*n*hermite(n - 1, x)
sage: derivative(hermite(n,x),n)

so something is badly wrong with recognizing the diff. parameter. Note only `hermite` is implemented in Pynac.

I have a patch for this issue (at least for gen_laguerre, my copy of sage doesn't have a derivative method for hermite).

The bug was in handling the diff_param choice, the 'else' branch had the return value for when diff_param was x, but that means that anything that didn't match
the ifs before would return the derivative wrt x from the 'else' branch.

The attached patch fixes this (and adds proper handling to laguerre as well)

Ok, I did that now. But I was not sure if I should have rebased the new patch into the previous one or not, and when I decided to push I got an error message saying that I needed to 'pull'
first. After pulling an automatic merge was done, so now there are three commits in this branch.

Should I have rebased the doctest patch into the previous one? Would that require a 'forced' git push?
