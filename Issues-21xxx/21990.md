From reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/sagemath/comments/4wr20g/rational_input_issue_for_graphscompletegraph/

The lines responsible to it:

```python
        if format is None and isinstance(data, (int, Integer)):
            format = 'int'
```

We can add something like this

```python
        if format is None and isinstance(data, Rational):
            if data.is_integer():
                data = Integer(data)
                format = 'int'
```
just before.

What do you think?

Component: **graph theory**

Keywords: **complete_graph**

I think we have a common view here and suggest this to be closed as wontfix.

(Actually, I do not say that it is necessarily a good thing to have "type-based" checks. What is good is consistency. As we have decided to have types, then let it be so.

Maybe there could be some "common mistakes for [SageMath](../wiki/SageMath) beginner" for things like this? `is_prime(4/2)` would be easiest example to explain.)

This is also the case in:

* XCas
