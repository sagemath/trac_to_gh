From reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/sagemath/comments/4wr20g/rational_input_issue_for_graphscompletegraph/

The lines responsible to it:

```python
        if format is None and isinstance(data, (int, Integer)):
            format = 'int'
```

We can add something like this

```python
        if format is None and isinstance(data, Rational):
            if data.is_integer():
                data = Integer(data)
                format = 'int'
```
just before.

What do you think?

Honestly, I think this is not a bug. The behaviour of the function should depend on the input type, not on the input value. Therefore, if `graphs.CompleteGraph(5/2)` does not work, then `graphs.CompleteGraph(6/2)` should not work either.

In any case, if you think that rationals should work here, you should use `operator.index()` instead of special-casing `Rational`.

One more thing: if we think that this is not a bug, perhaps we do want to have a more informative error message when one tries to construct a complete graph with a rational argument.

I think we have a common view here and suggest this to be closed as wontfix.

(Actually, I do not say that it is necessarily a good thing to have "type-based" checks. What is good is consistency. As we have decided to have types, then let it be so.

Maybe there could be some "common mistakes for [SageMath](SageMath) beginner" for things like this? `is_prime(4/2)` would be easiest example to explain.)

Similarly, the question whether a given rational symbol is prime should return unknown.

This is also the case in:
* Sympy
* Wolfram Alpha
* XCas

This is also discussed here: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/sage-support/OcmTApLRi2s/HQgU0cTUAwAJ, and it seems like the conclusion is the change it.
