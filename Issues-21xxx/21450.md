In case of a problem with the sagetex install, one ends up with this:

```
...
sagetex.VersionError: versions of .sty and .py files do not match.
2016-09-08-060257.sagetex.sage was generated by sagetex.sty version "2012/01/16 v2.3.3-69dcb0eb93de", but
is being processed by sagetex.py version "2015/08/26 v3.0-92d9f7a".
Please make sure that TeX is using the sagetex.sty
from your current version of Sage; see
http://www.sagemath.org/doc/installation/sagetex.html.
```

However, that link currently redirects to another link, which breaks.   

I searched the install guide for sagetex and found nothing: http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/search.html?q=sagetex&check_keywords=yes&area=default

So no clue what to do...

The bad link is not in the [SageMath](SageMath) repository, but in SageTeX. I've opened a [pull request](https://github.com/dandrake/sagetex/pull/5) to fix that.

The link you're looking for is http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/tutorial/sagetex.html
