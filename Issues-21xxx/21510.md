<div id="comment:0"></div>

some file, `sage_started.txt` is falling on our feet in #15105.

the file is created by the build process in SAGE_ETC, which possibly is not writable at that time.

also, the file seems to have something to do with the first run of the `sage` script. the first run must be possible to happen before installing anything (such as in `make check`).

it seems that we need a sort of wrapper to implement a functional pre-install `sage`. this wrapper could also handle sage_started, or disable the mechanism.

What exactly is the problem to be fixed here? "foo is falling on our feet" is not very descriptive. You really need to give more details. Also, when you say things like "`SAGE_ETC`, which possibly is not writable at that time." you should justify that.

The description should be clarified to distinguish the following issues:
- What is `sage_started.txt`?
- Does it belong into `SAGE_LOCAL` (= `$prefix` by #21479) or rather into the build directory (SAGE_ROOT, distinguished in VPATH builds (#21469) from SAGE_SRC_ROOT)?
- If it does belong into `SAGE_LOCAL`, then if `SAGE_LOCAL` is only root-writable, then SAGE_SUDO needs to be invoked (#21537).
- Beyond that, any discussion of "separating `make` and `make install`" should please go to ticket #21495, not here.
