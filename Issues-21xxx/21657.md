Since `abs` is an explicit alias of `abs_symbolic` it should be explicitly imported from `functions/other.py`

This one is different, it looks like a bug in `BuiltinFunction._eval_mpmath_()`.

My sage-devel post repeated here:
`Expression.__abs__()` directly calls Pynac's `abs_eval` while `abs_symbolic` goes through `GinacFunction`'s Python code first, e.g.:

```
sage: abs_symbolic(x,x)
...
TypeError: Symbolic function abs takes exactly 1 arguments (2 given)

sage: abs(x,x)
...
TypeError: abs() takes exactly one argument (2 given)
```
so there is a difference that might show with other usages too.

Python's `abs` does a check on the number of parameters before dispatching. It has to because it dispatches through a slot in `PyNumberMethods`, going to a c-function that accepts only one argument (meaning that for instance on cython types, `abs(c)` can work just as fast as `len(c)` etc: these methods are resolved via a pointer on the type; no method resolution required)\n\nSo the error traceback of `abs(x,x)` and `abs_symbolic(x,x)` will be different even if you chance `Expression.__abs__`.\n\n> so there is a difference that might show with other usages too.\n\nThese difference have a good reason, though, and are evidence of an efficiency in `builtin.abs` that we do not want to lose (e.g., people doing numerical work are going to be quite upset if they don't get the usual `abs` in sage anymore and have to pay the price of full method resolution and a `GinacFunction`).\n\nDifferences between toplevel functions and symbolic functions happen more often, even for things that are in control of sage:\n\n```\nsage: F=integrate(function('f')(x),x,0,1); F\nintegrate(f(x), x, 0, 1)\nsage: integrate is F.operator()\nFalse\nsage: type(integrate)\n<type 'function'>\nsage: type(F.operator())\n<class 'sage.symbolic.integration.integral.DefiniteIntegral'>\nsage: integrate is sage.symbolic.integration.integral.integrate\nFalse\n```",

You can change that if you want to, but I'm not sure if one or the other has an advantage.

That doesn't confirm the statement you made above. Python's `abs` does a check on the number of parameters before dispatching. It has to because it dispatches through a slot in `PyNumberMethods`, going to a c-function that accepts only one argument (meaning that for instance on cython types, `abs(c)` can work just as fast as `len(c)` etc: these methods are resolved via a pointer on the type; no method resolution required)

So the error traceback of `abs(x,x)` and `abs_symbolic(x,x)` will be different even if you chance `Expression.__abs__`.

> so there is a difference that might show with other usages too.

These difference have a good reason, though, and are evidence of an efficiency in `builtin.abs` that we do not want to lose (e.g., people doing numerical work are going to be quite upset if they don't get the usual `abs` in sage anymore and have to pay the price of full method resolution and a `GinacFunction`).

Differences between toplevel functions and symbolic functions happen more often, even for things that are in control of sage:

```
sage: F=integrate(function('f')(x),x,0,1); F
integrate(f(x), x, 0, 1)
sage: integrate is F.operator()
False
sage: type(integrate)
<type 'function'>
sage: type(F.operator())
<class 'sage.symbolic.integration.integral.DefiniteIntegral'>
sage: integrate is sage.symbolic.integration.integral.integrate
False
```

I really didn't expect this simple change to cause so much trouble, so yes let's close it. Thanks for the feedback.
