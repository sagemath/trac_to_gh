`src/bin/sage-env` (with generated configuration in `src/bin/sage-env-config`; installed in `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin`) is used in all of the following contexts: 
1. Sage-the-distribution while building spkgs,
2. Sage-the-distribution for building sagelib,
3. for environment variables needed to start Sage,
4. as variables by Sage at runtime (through `sage.env`), and
5. for environment variables affecting subprocesses of Python invoked by sagelib modules. 

This ticket proposes to split the configuration according to these 5 contexts. This will make the installation of Sage more modular and flexible.

1./2. Create `build/bin/sage-build-env`(with generated configuration in `build/bin/sage-build-env-config`) for the build-time environment variables for sage-the-distribution (spkg and sagelib). It is not installed in $SAGE_LOCAL. 
   b. In `build/make/Makefile.in` and the scripts generated by `build/bin/sage-spkg`, source `build/bin/sage-build-env` in addition to `src/bin/sage-env`. This is #29052.
   c. Gradually, we will move settings from `src/bin/sage-env[-config]` to `build/bin/sage-build-env[-config]` that are known to be only needed for 1./2. (Note that not all compiler-related environment variables can be moved exclusively to 1./2. â€“ some need to be added to 5 as well for some some calls to compilers needed at runtime to support things like `%cython` (?) and `sage.calculus.desolvers.desolve_mintides`.) As well as users' use of `pip` to install additional Python packages! 
   d. Eventually, we will remove the call to `src/bin/sage-env` from the build scripts.

2./3. Obtain sagelib's build-time configuration such as `src/setup.py`'s `library_dirs` and runtime information (`sage.env`) from `sage-config` (introduced in #29038). 
   a. In `src/Makefile`, poison the `SAGE_LOCAL` variable.
   - #29411: make sagelib a script package
   - #29779: `pkg-config` installed from SPKG `pkgconf` should not depend on environment variable `SAGE_LOCAL`
   b. Pass `SAGE_PKGS` (if still needed at all - see #28815 or #29705) via `sage-config` instead of from `src/Makefile`.

3./4./5. Using `sage_conf` (Python module and script `sage-config`, #29038), make `sage.all` fully functional when imported from a Python, without setting any environment variables (`sage-env`).
a. Initially, phase out `src/bin/sage-env-config` by using `sage-config` instead.
   - #29384: Clean up `src/bin/sage-env-config.in`: Move logic to `src/bin/sage-env`, move non-environment configuration variables to `sage_conf.py`
   - #29825: Clean-up for src/bin/sage-env
b. Set `sage.env` variables via the Python module `sage_conf` instead of relying on information from environment variables. Example: `CYSIGNALS_CRASH_DAYS`
   - #34236 `sage.env`: Give values from `sage_conf` precedence over environment variables
c. Set environment variables that are needed only by subprocesses invoked by sagelib in the environment of these subprocesses, rather than relying on them begin set in `sage-env`. This environment could be provided by a variable `sage_conf.SAGE_SUBPROCESS_ENV` and/or more invidual variables. Example: `R_PROFILE`
   - #30563: Use configuration variable `MAXIMA` instead of hardcoding "maxima" 
   - #30818 Set environment for subprocesses invoked by Sage
d. Finally, remove use of `sage-env` for all purposes except for `sage -sh`.

**Aspects of downstream sage packaging:**

- The goal is to enable downstream sage packagers to use a whole unmodified `src` directory to build and install sagelib.
   - more precisely, to use the pip-installable source package created by `build/pkgs/sagelib/spkg-src` (#29950); see also #30036	(pip-installable sage)
- Downstream packagers could provide their own "implementation" (one Python module [sage_conf.py](https://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/tree/build/pkgs/sage_conf/src/sage_conf.py.in?id=1c5d011b5f05a954dd2ea810635c9d59cc48e7b5)) of the configuration module defined by #29038, instead of patching sources. They would not necessarily use the reference implementation in `build/pkgs/sage_conf`, which is intended for use with sage-the-distribution.

**Binary packages:**

- #31417 version of package `sage_conf` for relocatable binary distributions

**pip-installable Sage**

- #29039 pip-installable version of package `sage_conf` - installs non-Python bits of the Sage distribution in `~/.sage/`
- #31396 relocatable wheel version of package `sage_conf`

**More related tickets:**
- cleaning of `src/bin` as described in #21570, #21559.
- #25486: Discover `SAGE_SCRIPTS_DIR` to make `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/sage` work from any directory, in an environment without `SAGE_*` variables - this adds a `SAGE_ROOT` variable to `sage-env-config`
- #30724: `src/bin/sage-env`, `src/bin/sage-env-config.in`: Remove PYTHON_FOR_VENV
- #29133 META-META-TICKET: Build, packaging, testing improvements

 I have thought about it often. Of course that really means that you'll have to removing all the build time stuff. But in sage-on-gentoo where I ship a very simplified sage-env (in /etc as well) they are virtually doing the same thing, one in shell, the other in python.

 b. Set `sage.env` variables via the Python module `sage_conf` instead of relying on information from environment variables. Example: `CYSIGNALS_CRASH_DAYS`
 c. Set environment variables that are needed only by subprocesses invoked by sagelib in the environment of these subprocesses, rather than relying on them begin set in `sage-env`. This environment could be provided by a variable `sage_conf.SAGE_SUBPROCESS_ENV` and/or more invidual variables. Example: `R_PROFILE`
+   - #30563: Use configuration variable `MAXIMA` instead of hardcoding "maxima" 
+   - #30818 Set environment for subprocesses invoked by Sage
 d. Finally, remove use of `sage-env` for all purposes except for `sage -sh`.

<a id='comment:49'></a>Not sure if this is the right place, but I would suggest to use the refactoring process to also convert the environment variables to configuration files. 

The idea would be to have a `toml` file (or `yaml` or whatever you prefer) in some predefined folder (say `src` for the start). This file could be generated e.g by the `configure` script. This config file is then parsed and wrapped by a python class (natural candidate would be the current `sage_conf.py`). The python class also provides reasonable default values in case the config file doesn't exist. 

This has several advantages in my opinion:
- More transparent, as one sees on one glance which variables influence sage.
- Easily editable by the user/developer.
- Local (e.g. think about multiple virtual environments with different configs).
- Type-safe, i.e, it is ensured when parsing the toml file that the types of the config variables is correct.
- Easier for downstream package managers, since they only need to provide a proper config file.
- (Higher security as one cannot inject arbitrary python code, which would be the case if `sage_conf.py` should be edited.)

What do you think?

<a id='comment:50'></a>`sage_conf` defines an interface already - and the plan is indeed to get rid of dependencies on environment variables using this interface.

How `sage_conf` obtains the configuration is orthogonal to the defined interface.

I am not interested in defining configuration files at the moment.  There is just too much potential on wasting energy on discussions regarding the "best" config file format.

<a id='comment:59'></a>From the discussion in #32904 regarding `sage_conf` at build time (with pip's build isolation) vs. runtime:
- pip specifies "ignore-installed" while constructing the build environment and thus will build sage-conf twice. https://github.com/pypa/pip/blob/main/src/pip/_internal/build_env.py#L221
- The PyPI version `sage_conf` (from #29039) keys the `SAGE_ROOT`/`SAGE_LOCAL` that it creates in `~/.sage` to the version of `sage_conf`
- So if the `sage_conf` version is not completely pinned in the `sagemath-standard` build and install requirements, then different versions (and thus `SAGE_ROOT`s) may end up being used at build and install of `sagemath-standard`
