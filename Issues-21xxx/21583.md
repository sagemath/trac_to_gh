When this `xrange(...)` is passed to some Sage function, this actually changes what is being tested. For loops, I agree with this change. But doing this mass replacement everywhere, I don't agree.

Replying to [chapoton](#comment%3A3):

All replacements `xrange() -> range()` which are done in a **looping construct** are fine. This means replacements in code like `for i in xrange(n)` or in `[f(x) for x in xrange(n)]`.

Everything else (for example, the `matrix()` calls) should be investigated more carefully, preferably in a different ticket.

For the `matrix()` calls, you can use `six.moves.range` instead of `xrange` because those are equivalent in Python 2.
