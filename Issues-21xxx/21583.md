All replacements `xrange() -> range()` which are done in a **looping construct** are fine. This means replacements in code like `for i in xrange(n)` or in `[f(x) for x in xrange(n)]`.

Everything else (for example, the `matrix()` calls) should be investigated more carefully, preferably in a different ticket.
