I've made some reviewer changes, but you are currently inconsistent. If the user inputs something that is not a map, we raise a `ValueError`, but if the map has differing domain and codomains, then you return `False`. In both cases, the input is nonsensical, and I would argue (just like for `is_similar` for matrices) that the return should be `False` in both cases because they are not contiguous. Thoughts?
