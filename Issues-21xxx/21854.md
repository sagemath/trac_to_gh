Add `kappa_dual` as parallel to `kappa` and use them to check for `is[_meet|_join]_semidistributive()`.

For example to check if `Posets.TamariLattice(7)` is join_semidistributive takes 20 seconds without this patch, 0,04 seconds with this. (On old computer.)

Yes, can be done, but getting congruence-related functions done will give enought work to do until next beta.
