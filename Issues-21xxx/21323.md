OpenBLAS is currently configured to run in multithreaded mode.
This prevents a user to have control over the number of threads of his sage computation (in case he wants to split it in several processes).

Instead, I suggest to configure it with the `USE_THREAD=0` option which makes it a sequential BLAS.

Note that LinBox parallel routines (not yet exposed in SageMath) required a sequential BLAS. In turn they offer parallel speed-up of the same order, but with the option to set the number of threads as a parameters to the function called.

**Keywords:** BLAS, sd75

**Reviewer:** Jean-Pierre Flori, Clément Pernet

I see in OpenBLAS doc (https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS/wiki/faq):

```
    How can I use OpenBLAS in multi-threaded applications?

If your application is already multi-threaded, it will conflict with OpenBLAS multi-threading. Thus, you must set OpenBLAS to use single thread as following.
*    export OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1 in the environment variables. Or
*    Call openblas_set_num_threads(1) in the application on runtime. Or
*    Build OpenBLAS single thread version, e.g. make USE_THREAD=0
```
So it seems we could disable mt at runtime.
Any thought abour this?
