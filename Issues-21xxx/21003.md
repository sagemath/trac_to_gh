I marked all doctest `optional` and updated.


Suddenly, one doctest doesn't work anymore:

```
sage: g = graphs.CubeGraph(9)
sage: p = MixedIntegerLinearProgram(solver = "SCIP")                # optional - pyscipopt

sage: b = p.new_variable(binary=True)                               # optional - pyscipopt
sage: p.set_objective(p.sum(b[v] for v in g))                       # optional - pyscipopt
sage: for v in g:                                                   # optional - pyscipopt
....:     p.add_constraint(b[v]+p.sum(b[u] for u in g.neighbors(v)) <= 1) # optional - pyscipopt
sage: p.add_constraint(b[v] == 1) # Force an easy non-0 solution    # optional - pyscipopt
sage: p.solver_parameter("limits/absgap", 100)                      # optional - pyscipopt
sage: p.solve() # rel tol 100                                       # optional - pyscipopt
``` 
and totaly chrashes sage with an error message `free(): invalid pointer`. I don't quite know what is going on. 

What is really weird is that it works if I don't run the last line, but instead:

```
sage: q = copy(p)
sage: q.solver_parameter("limits/absgap", 100)
sage: q.solve()
0
```

(I temperarily change `9` to `4` in the doctest above, in order to be able to run the rest of the doctest. The current branch works without failures for me.)

I think Matthias made the backend Cython, because the `generic_backend.pyx` is also written this way and all the other files are written in this way. However other backends might actually need this. 

I agree that there we don't really need Cython for the pyscipopt backend. But it doesn't do any harm, does it? I am indifferent; we can change it or leave it, both is fine with me.

On the plus side

- do like the other backends

On the minus side

- two files (pxd/pyx) instead of one
- longer compilation time
- more delicate to debug

The reason why all other backends are written in Cython is because they do call C functions.

In the last commit, you added `elif solver == "Scip":` but in other places we have `for s in ["Cplex", "Gurobi", "Coin", "Glpk", "SCIP"]:` and in the last comment you used `'scip'`. I'm not sure which is the correct way to write it. In fact, I think that the name of the solver should not be case sensitive.

I tried different ways to write `scip` in `~/.sage/init-doctests.sage` and it's working, but I cannot ensure that `SCIP` has been used...

I checked why copying is so incredibly slow (see #33238).  Apparently, almost all of the time is spent in preparing the arguments for `add_linear_constraint`, more precisely, in `self.model.getConss()[index]`.  Indeed, calling `row_bounds` only once saves a quarter of the time.  
I have not found the definition of `self.model.getConss()` yet, but perhaps that there is some copying going on?

Here is the necessary modification to the backend:

Indeed.

```
    def getConss(self):
        """Retrieve all constraints."""
        cdef SCIP_CONS** _conss
        cdef int _nconss
        conss = []

        _nconss = SCIPgetNConss(self._scip)

So we are creating a list of 4100 constraints, pick one, throw the list away again.  We do this 4 (or at least 3) times per constraint, and for each of the 4100 constraints.

Maybe we can have something along the following lines:

```
def constraints(self):
    if self._constraints is None:
        self._constraints = self.model.getConss()
    return self._constraints
```
and do `self._constraints = None` in all methods that modify the array of constraints?

I hope that this is not too off topic here - please let me provide background on why I am copying MILPS:

In #33238, I need to solve a program with temporarily added constraints.  In principle, I see two options for doing this:

1. copy the MILP, add the new constraints to the copy, solve, throw away the copy

2. add the constraints, solve, remove the constraints

Currently, I am doing 1., because I am afraid that I cannot control what happens when adding a constraint.  In particular, a clever solver might detect that it is redundant, or an even more intelligent solver might rewrite the whole list of constraints.  Possibly I could check whether my new constraint wasn't added at all, but could a complete rewrite of a program happen in theory?

Removing constraints is supported by our frontend and backend interfaces and by the SCIP API.

Are you saying that it is *very* hard to imagine a solver that rewrites the constraints upon solving?

I would prefer that my code works generically, and not just specifically for SCIP.

Also, I don't really have any means to identify a constraint, except by index.  I admit it may be silly, but in principle I do not even know whether my solver adds a constraint at the beginning or at the end.

It might indeed be faster to add and remove constraints, because I am doing a lot of this.  However, comment:138 seems to contradict comment:137 and comment:135.

So maybe we could have some kind of flag telling us whether a solver does rewrite constraints or not?

I recommend that in your code you wrap your use of `add_constraint` with a check that exactly one constraint is added - just to document this assumption (which you are allowed to make).

Well, there is another thing with adding and removing: removing will - with the patch above - unnecessarily recompute the list of constraints again.  If I additionally check that adding the constraint also increases the number of constraints by one, then I have this overhead twice.

It's a bit strange that the backend needs the constraint to remove it, whereas in sage we need the index.

That said, replacing copy with adding/removing constraints makes a HUGE difference for this problem, roughly a factor of 8!

I won't be able to improve `__copy__` right now, but I'd appreciate improvements.
