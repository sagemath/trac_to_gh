<a id='comment:34'></a>I marked all doctest `optional` and updated.


Suddenly, one doctest doesn't work anymore:

```
sage: g = graphs.CubeGraph(9)
sage: p = MixedIntegerLinearProgram(solver = "SCIP")                # optional - pyscipopt

sage: b = p.new_variable(binary=True)                               # optional - pyscipopt
sage: p.set_objective(p.sum(b[v] for v in g))                       # optional - pyscipopt
sage: for v in g:                                                   # optional - pyscipopt
....:     p.add_constraint(b[v]+p.sum(b[u] for u in g.neighbors(v)) <= 1) # optional - pyscipopt
sage: p.add_constraint(b[v] == 1) # Force an easy non-0 solution    # optional - pyscipopt
sage: p.solver_parameter("limits/absgap", 100)                      # optional - pyscipopt
sage: p.solve() # rel tol 100                                       # optional - pyscipopt
``` 
and totaly chrashes sage with an error message `free(): invalid pointer`. I don't quite know what is going on. 

What is really weird is that it works if I don't run the last line, but instead:

```
sage: q = copy(p)
sage: q.solver_parameter("limits/absgap", 100)
sage: q.solve()
0
```

(I temperarily change `9` to `4` in the doctest above, in order to be able to run the rest of the doctest. The current branch works without failures for me.)

I did a rebase, and it was done automatically.
I ran all the tests, and (at least on my machine) everything works..

I am a bit confused, because I expected to see merge conflicts..

I think Matthias made the backend Cython, because the `generic_backend.pyx` is also written this way and all the other files are written in this way. However other backends might actually need this.

On the plus side

- do like the other backends

On the minus side

- two files (pxd/pyx) instead of one
- longer compilation time
- more delicate to debug

The reason why all other backends are written in Cython is because they do call C functions.

<a id='comment:7'></a>I checked why copying is so incredibly slow (see #33238).  Apparently, almost all of the time is spent in preparing the arguments for `add_linear_constraint`, more precisely, in `self.model.getConss()[index]`.  Indeed, calling `row_bounds` only once saves a quarter of the time.  
I have not found the definition of `self.model.getConss()` yet, but perhaps that there is some copying going on?

Here is the necessary modification to the backend:

<a id='comment:2'></a>I hope that this is not too off topic here - please let me provide background on why I am copying MILPS:

In #33238, I need to solve a program with temporarily added constraints.  In principle, I see two options for doing this:

1. copy the MILP, add the new constraints to the copy, solve, throw away the copy

2. add the constraints, solve, remove the constraints

Currently, I am doing 1., because I am afraid that I cannot control what happens when adding a constraint.  In particular, a clever solver might detect that it is redundant, or an even more intelligent solver might rewrite the whole list of constraints.  Possibly I could check whether my new constraint wasn't added at all, but could a complete rewrite of a program happen in theory?

Removing constraints is supported by our frontend and backend interfaces and by the SCIP API.

I would prefer that my code works generically, and not just specifically for SCIP.

Also, I don't really have any means to identify a constraint, except by index.  I admit it may be silly, but in principle I do not even know whether my solver adds a constraint at the beginning or at the end.

If I additionally check that adding the constraint also increases the number of constraints by one, then I have this overhead twice.

It's a bit strange that the backend needs the constraint to remove it, whereas in sage we need the index.

That said, replacing copy with adding/removing constraints makes a HUGE difference for this problem, roughly a factor of 8!

I won't be able to improve `__copy__` right now, but I'd appreciate improvements.
