Numerous doctests have to be changed, due to different outputs from PARI (in particular the unit group of number fields).

One doctest change is potentially dubious but has been checked by John Cremona:

```diff
         It can happen that no points are found if the height bounds
         used in the search are too small (see :trac:`10745`)::
 
             sage: K.<y> = NumberField(x^4 + x^2 - 7)
             sage: E = EllipticCurve(K, [1, 0, 5*y^2 + 16, 0, 0])
             sage: E.gens(lim1=1, lim3=1)
             []
-            sage: E.rank(), E.gens()  # long time (about 3 s)
-            (1, [(9/25*y^2 + 26/25 : -229/125*y^3 - 67/25*y^2 - 731/125*y - 213/25 : 1)])
+            sage: E.rank(), E.gens(lim3=12)  # long time (about 4s)
+            (1,
+             [(369/25*y^3 + 539/25*y^2 + 1178/25*y + 1718/25 : -29038/125*y^3 - 43003/125*y^2 - 92706/125*y - 137286/125 : 1)])
```

I had to increase the `lim3` value for Simon's 2-descent to find a point. The new point differs from the old point by a 3-torsion point and a sign.

Given that the sum of the two result is of 3-torsion, the new point is still a generator, so should we really worry?
`@`Jeroen: do you think the precision change is worrying?
