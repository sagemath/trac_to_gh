This ticket should accomplish:
* implement inverse error function `erfinv` (#11349)
* implement imaginary error function `erfi`.
* People need to manipulate statistical distribution functions as in https://ask.sagemath.org/question/35407/use-cumulative-distribution-functions/. To provide the means a symbolical version of `erfc` is necessary. The current `error_fcn()` is only numerical.
* put it all in a separate file `functions/error.py` with central documentation

<a id='comment:5'></a>The name `error_fcn` is nonstandard. I think it should be deprecated with an appropriate warning.

A couple minor things in the documentation in `error.py`:

1) One LaTeX instance of `\text` should be `\operatorname`

2) Five instances of code markdown in the AUTHORS section need double back ticks instead of single.
