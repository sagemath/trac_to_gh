```
sage: C = LinearCode(random_matrix(GF(47), 12, 43))
sage: C.canonical_representative()
<wait half an eternity or try to use C-c>
```
Pressing `C-c` either seems to have no effect, throws an exception which is not caught and computation continues, or segfaults.

This is very unfortunate because this is a function commonly tried but interrupted due to long run-time.

Depends on #21651

The call to `PartitionRefinementLinearCode` is a Python call, so `sig_on()` is inappropriate. `sig_on()` is only meant to wrap calls to external libraries that you have no control over.

In this case, you should use `sig_check()` in the Cython code instead.

Thanks. Of course you're the mastermind behind cysignals, but the documentation of cysignals *does* say: "You should put sig_on() before and sig_off() after any Cython code which could potentially take a long time.". Which is why I thought it would be OK to do that.

Further, removing that `sig_on/sig_off` pair, I get the following segfault when interrupting:

```
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occurred.
This probably occurred because a *compiled* module has a bug
in it and is not properly wrapped with sig_on(), sig_off().
Python will now terminate.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

Further leading me to believe `sig_on/sig_off` was the way to go.

I've tried to look closer at `PartitionRefinementLinearCode`: it quickly calls into `sage/groups/perm_gps/partn_ref2/refinement_generic.pyx` which is a very complicated, mutually recursive backtracking algorithm, and it's not very clear what the "expensive loop" is. Exactly why is it not OK to use `sig_on/sig_off` in such a case?

Also, it's not clear to me why Sage segfaults on `C-c` since all the code I can see is just Cython code. If this is expected behaviour, why is the following message printed if `sig_on/sig_off` is not the right way to solve such an issue?

Best,
Johan

That's probably an independent problem. I strongly suggest that you first fix this segfault before moving on. It is pointless to build on top of a broken foundation.

Do you have a GDB backtrace (if you have gdb installed, such a backtrace will be shown automatically) or a way for me to reproduce that segfault?

Haha, good point :-)

Hmm, OK. What I run to produce the segfault is the following:

```
sage: C = LinearCode(random_matrix(GF(47), 25, 35))
sage: C.canonical_representative()
< Hit C-c and watch the fireworks >
```

I do have gdb since gdb launches when I type gdb. It's not hard to test.

How do I know if it's "the right version"? It's 7.11.1. My gcc is 6.1.1. Presumably they fit together since they're in my package manager?
