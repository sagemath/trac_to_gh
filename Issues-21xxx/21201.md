Some rings have a polymorphic comparison with zero, e.g., comparison in `SR` can mean 1. "try to prove with certainty" or 2. "check if numeric zero". Other rings may have different features. This ticket implements a global `is_trivial_zero` that explicity requests the object's `is_trivial_zero` member if it exists, otherwise checks `obj==0`.

This ticket implements a global `is_trivial_zero` that explicity requests the object's `is_trivial_zero` member if it exists, otherwise checks `obj==0`.

Just to be sure: what do you mean by "check if numeric zero": check if something seems to be zero based on it numerical evaluation, or check if is syntactically zero? If the latter: yes, this is a very useful feature to have, for many, many types of objects. But in the case of `SR`, is there any strong reason to have `==` do more than check for syntactic equality?

At least some variants of these methods should take into account assumptions on the variables. I'm not sure what exact set of such methods would be needed, whether they should return plain booleans or use `Unknown`, nor how they should be named (and in particular, whether using the names `is_zero()` and `is_nonzero()` would conflict with their semantics elsewhere in Sage).",

Replying to [@rwst](#comment%3A10):
> Clearly not but unfortunately `bool()` with symbolic arguments does more by default.

Well, IMO (though I haven't really thought it through):
* `bool(expr)` should return `False` iff `expr` is exactly `SR(0)`, without any simplification, even trivial ones,
* `expr == 0` should return `True` when `bool(expr)` returns `False`, and may return `True` in some cases where trivial simplifications show that `expr` is zero, but shouldn't perform any nontrivial computation (I would say simplifying `x - x` to zero is okay, attempting to expand a polynomial is not—but this is of course debatable),
* there should be methods `expr.foo()` that attempt to prove that `expr` is zero (e.g. by simplifying it), that `expr` is nonzero (e.g. by substituting values for the variable and performing interval evaluation), that `expr` could be zero (for some values of the variables), and probably more. At least some variants of these methods should take into account assumptions on the variables. I'm not sure what exact set of such methods would be needed, whether they should return plain booleans or use `Unknown`, nor how they should be named (and in particular, whether using the names `is_zero()` and `is_nonzero()` would conflict with their semantics elsewhere in Sage).
