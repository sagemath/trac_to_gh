`entrypoints` is officially a dependency of the Jupyter `nbconvert` module, so Sage should also have it.

This distribution is missing a `setup.py` ([upstream denies this is a bug](https://github.com/takluyver/entrypoints/issues/8)), so we provide one within Sage.

`configparser` is a dependency of `entrypoints`.
