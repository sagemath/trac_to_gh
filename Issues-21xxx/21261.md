`entrypoints` is officially a dependency of the Jupyter `nbconvert` module, so Sage should also have it.

This distribution is missing a `setup.py` ([upstream denies this is a bug](https://github.com/takluyver/entrypoints/issues/8)), so we provide one within Sage.

`configparser` is a dependency of `entrypoints`.

**Tarballs**:

- https://pypi.python.org/packages/7c/69/c2ce7e91c89dc073eb1aa74c0621c3eefbffe8216b3f9af9d3885265c01c/configparser-3.5.0.tar.gz
