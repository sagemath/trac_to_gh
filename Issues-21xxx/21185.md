It probably failed to compile a test program or something.  If #20926 added `-std=c++98` this can lead to errors in some headers in Cygwin, which is an issued I've encountered a few times in different ways.  Changing it to `-std=gnu++98` should work.

<a id='comment:14'></a>Ticket #17635 now conflicts with this one, as the new releases of LinBox, !Givaro and fflas-ffpack all require `--std=c++11`.

As I'm not familiar with this cygwin issue and do not have access to a cygwin machine, could you confirm to me that adding a

```
if [ "$UNAME" = CYGWIN ]; then
     CXXFLAGS="$CXXFLAGS -std=gnu++11"
fi
```
in the spkg-install script would work on cygwin?
Or maybe the issue no longer exists with `--std=c++11`.

(I was actually in favour of making `-std=c++98` depend on the compiler used... ;-) )

Why not just add (in addition) `-fpermissive` on Cygwin?
