Linbox is a standard package for doing linear algebra over `\ZZ` and finite fields.

Both my cygwin32 and cygwin64 builds failed on this step. This is possibly a regression due to #20926. Checking now.

Yes, this is due to #20926; when I reverted that change, I could build linbox on Cygwin32. So would the best way forward would be to add a check against Cygwin or do something different?

Ah, it might be good to look in your `config.log` and see what failed at:

```

It probably failed to compile a test program or something.  If #20926 added `-std=c++98` this can lead to errors in some headers in Cygwin, which is an issued I've encountered a few times in different ways.  Changing it to `-std=gnu++98` should work.

Looks fine to me.

I do wonder, given that there are several packages that for one reason or another want to set a `-std` flag in `CFLAGS` and/or `CXXFLAGS` that there shouldn't be some reusable variable for it right in `sage-env`, which would include the workaround for Cygwin in one place.

Maybe not worth it though.  The issue we're having with fflas doesn't apply in all cases.  That is, many packages will build fine in Cygwin with `-std=c++98`.  There are just some bugs in some of the newlib headers that can crop up depending on what C(++) standard you're using and what order headers happen to be included in.

Ticket #17635 now conflicts with this one, as the new releases of LinBox, !Givaro and fflas-ffpack all require `--std=c++11`.

As I'm not familiar with this cygwin issue and do not have access to a cygwin machine, could you confirm to me that adding a

```
if [ "$UNAME" = CYGWIN ]; then
     CXXFLAGS="$CXXFLAGS -std=gnu++11"
fi
```
in the spkg-install script would work on cygwin?
Or maybe the issue no longer exists with `--std=c++11`.

(I was actually in favour of making `-std=c++98` depend on the compiler used... ;-) )

Why not just add (in addition) `-fpermissive` on Cygwin?

FYI, on my Cygwin32 and Cygwin64 setups, the provided tarballs use `-std=gnu++11` by default.
That's outside of Sage (and without NTL, IML), but I don't see why it would change when Sage builds it.
