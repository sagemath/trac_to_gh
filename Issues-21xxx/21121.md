Tolerance exceeded in 1 of 8:

```

Sage saying that 10<sup>-14</sup> > 10<sup>-14</sup> appears a bit stupid.

The attached branch fixes this by displaying `y > x` where:

- `x` is the required tolerance (given in the doctest) with 15 digits, rounded to nearest.

- `y` is the observed tolerance (computed by running the test) with 1 digit, **rounded up**. This means that using `# tol y` is guaranteed to make the test pass.

Assuming that the tolerance in the doctest is given to at most 15 digits of precision (almost certainly the case), `x` should be exactly what was in the doctest. In that case, `y` cannot be equal to `x`.

We also refactor the implementation for printing tolerance errors somewhat.

Finally, we use 1044 bits of precision to compute tolerances. This may seem overkill, but it is needed if we want to deal with tolerances on numbers computed with 1024 bits of precision.

I.e., we should **at least** make sure `"%.0e" % RIFtol(actual).center()` doesn't give the same as `"%.0e" % RIFtol(desired).center()`.  (Not sure whether using `.center()` here is at all the right thing, or whether we should at all use `RIF` for the *tolerance values* themselves; see also below.)

If it does, we may increase the number of (mantissa) digits in the former.  Or in both, until they differ.

And that's orthogonal to improving hints regarding the actual deviation, i.e., if one wants to adjust the *expected figures* rather than (just) the tolerance.

If the intervals of *want* and *got* do not overlap (i.e., when the tolerance is exceeded), we could also give `.upper()` and `.lower()` (or vice versa, depending on whether *want* is smaller or larger than *got*).

AFAICT, we unfortunately *there* do not know whether `# tol 1e-14` or e.g. `# tol 1.0e-14` was specified in the failing doctest.

To do:

Replace `True` by `dp <= some_meaningful_number` and `break` by `return ...` (returning what's now returned below, after the loop).

Then if we exit the `while` loop (giving up on too many decimal places), fall back to returning some other (meaningful) output, of course again other than `... x > x`.

You just need to print the numbers with directed roundings (up/down). But that needs #21124 to properly print the numbers.
