Whilst trying to package sagemath for Debian: https://anonscm.debian.org/cgit/debian-science/packages/sagemath.git/

During the docbuild, if I run:

```
$ find ./src/doc/en/reference/ -type f -exec ls -l --time-style=long-iso '{}' \; | sort -k6,7
```

I can see that the `.rst` files get touched during the docbuild. This breaks incremental build and makes it very time-consuming to debug segfaults.

I have already tried applying `build/pkgs/sphinx/patches/environment.patch` to my system sphinx. The patch applies, but the above behaviour remains.

No, it's definitely different. This is about incremental build, errors are not relevant.

More information: the doctrees and inventory is currently getting built in `~/.local/share/sagemath/doc`, but the rst files are being built in `sage.git/src/doc/en/reference` and they're being deleted and re-written every time.
