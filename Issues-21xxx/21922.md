Follow-up on #19853.
If there's an existing root-owned texlive hierarchy, the current script tries to use it but fails with permission errors. Instead, 
- it could use `tlmgr --usermode` to install into a user's `~/texmf`, 
- or use SAGE_SUDO (#21537) to install into the system texlive hierarchy, 
- or use `tlmgr --usermode --usertree` into $SAGE_LOCAL *and* set environment variables so that the installed stuff is found.
