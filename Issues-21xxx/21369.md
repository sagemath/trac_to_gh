2. Why this?

I understand and see that it makes sense, I am just wondering which bug it fixes.

3. The code mentioned in 2. could be improved a bit. Instead of using the `ret` variable, I suggest just returning the value directly. In the complex case, I would use `c = complex(self._eval_self(complex))` and then use the `real` and `imag` attributes (not functions).

4. Can you justify

It seems pointless to have `R_complex == R`.

Yes but this also prevents the `else` branch done (`R.complex_field()` with `R` being `complex`).

Can you add this as doctest then?

And delete the line `from sage.functions.other import real, imag`

And why is that a problem? Sure, it will raise an `AttributeError`, but that's caught. So I still don't see the point.
