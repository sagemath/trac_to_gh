You (or we) shouldn't search for optional packages in `spkg/optional/` **unless** there's no new-style version of a package.

All packages below `spkg/` are for "backwards-compatibility", i.e., older versions of Sage.

At some point, all old-style packages should be converted, such that we can (in principle) disable the installation of legacy spkgs into newer versions of Sage.

---

As you may know, I've always been against the "unified repo" as is (tying any spkg to specific Sage versions and vice versa, and offering only a single version of each at the same time), which is completely against the original philosophy (that anybody could offer *his/her* spkg, most being self-contained, some needing Sage library support of course).

Because of this, it's difficult to generally disallow the installation of "old-style" spkgs, unless or until we have a new format and mechanism for truly "external" packages.  (I suggested to split spkgs into two parts, the **S**age **pa**ckage **m**etadata, `.spam`, and an upstream tarball, years ago.  We could still do the same for at least "external" packages, namely create/use a tarball with just what is now in `build/pkgs/<pkgname>/`, although a single plain text file à la Arch Linux or !Gentoo/Funtoo would be better.)

A related problem is that our build / package system lacks any notion of version requirements, it always [en]forces to use exactly a single specific version of a package, no matter whether that's necessary or not, and true requirements are hardly documented.

That's because the "new-style" package is now categorized "experimental".

\\

> I want to be able to install all optional packages using `sage -optional` and this is badly broken.

Yes, it is.  Not long ago, it kept showing *only* legacy spkgs, now it gives an inconsistent mixture instead of what I mentioned above (namely legacy spkgs iff there's no "new-style" version at all).

> I also consider the current packaging system as very bad. But this ticket is about cleaning the websites mentioned in the description. And I think cleaning is a good step forward.

It's not the *website* that's broken, it's `sage --optional`, `sage --experimental` etc.  We should fix **that**, and not just try to hide the problem by more or less randomly deleting or moving some stuff.

What I said, fix the function showing optional/experimental packages.

Start with `build/pkgs/*` (as we do in `configure`), and if we at all still want to list legacy spkgs as well, only show those from `spkg/*` on files.sagemath.org that are *not* in the local repo (`build/pkgs/`).

Yes, see below.  We shouldn't have two implementations of the same thing (in addition not acting in the same manner).

While the last version of Sage without "new-style" packages was released quite a while ago, removing anything from `spkg/` breaks all the old versions.  I'm not aware of any announcement regarding that (although it's not unlikely I missed it), but I'm not aware of any "static" statement anywhere either.

If we *do* no longer support older versions, then **wipe out everything** below `spkg/`.

If there are still valuable optional/experimental packages which (after years?) haven't been converted, that's a bug, and there should be tickets for each.

I didn't say that.  I meant if you encounter an old-style package (from the file server), strip the version, including the Sage patch level, and of course the extension, convert it to lowercase, and see if that matches any of the folder names in `build/pkgs/`, or everything after the equals sign up to the first dash from the first line (or the line containing `tarball=`) of each `build/pkgs/*/checksum.ini`, again converted to lowercase.

What happened to the work of Nathann and others (about a year ago IIRC)?  We have been dealing with this a couple of times in the past...

Another thing we have to solve is of course any discrepancy between `sage-list-packages` or whatever its name is, and (the behavior of) `sage-spkg`.  Again, the easiest solution is to disable downloading old-style packages (automatically).  That's orthogonal to disallowing *installing* such (`sage -i /path/to/spkg`).

Since we meanwhile (rather "by accident") require a *system python* (>=2.6) anyway, if the python files there are stand-alone (i.e., do not need the Sage *library*), you could use them from `sage-spkg` as well.

Why not directly move them into `build/pkgs/` (with their "simplified" names), putting `legacy` into `type`, `tarball=...` (and checksums) into `checksums.ini`, what we consider the version into `package-version.txt`, and if one downloads them, into `upstream/` as usual.  (You could even already extract `spkg-{install,check}` and `SPKG.txt`.)

Then conversion will probably happen sooner...

I like very much the idea. But out of scope of #19213... I am opening a ticket for this which will be a dependency of #19213.

I guess because #19220 deals with throwing some away, while we here (or on #19213) try to keep the valuable ones, but presumably not by leaving them a) there b) as they are, which may also involve changes to the build system (perhaps on follow-ups though)...

The list of packages here is a subset of #19220, so this is just a duplicate of #19220.
