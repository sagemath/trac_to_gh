If you're going to try conversion anyway, I don't think it makes much sense to try coercion explicitly first. I think it's good custom that if a coercion exists, conversion should agree with it. So, in effect (and possibly even in implementation!), conversion would try a coercion already.

One of the reasons why conversion might not be appropriate here is that, for instance, `QQ("2")` works just fine. So, if you use conversion in exponents the following probably would hold:

```
sage: 2^"2"
4
sage: a=GF(3)(-1)
sage: 2^a
4
```
That's a little too lenient to my taste.
