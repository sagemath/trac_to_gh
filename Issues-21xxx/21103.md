I am not really convinced that the non-patched `Makefile`s are fine. Surely, the person who patched them must have had a reason for it. There is for example this comment in `build/pkgs/rubiks/patches/dietz-solver-Makefile`:

```
# This Makefile was seriously broken.

# LINK was set to g++, so I changed that to LD

Compare to the current source.  For the makefiles I removed from the patch there is no longer any difference from upstream (which has probably been patched).
