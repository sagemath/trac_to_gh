The `rubiks` package is copying files instead of proper patching. Clean this up.

See also #20837 and #20933 which did the same for other packages.

I am not really convinced that the non-patched `Makefile`s are fine. Surely, the person who patched them must have had a reason for it. There is for example this comment in `build/pkgs/rubiks/patches/dietz-solver-Makefile`:

```
# This Makefile was seriously broken.
# CC was set to g++. Since it was compiling C++ files,
# CXX should have been used.
# LINK was set to g++, so I changed that to LD
# CFLAGS was set to -O2. I've removed that, so it can be set
# in spkg-install.
# In any case, it should have been CXXFLAGS
# LFLAGS and INCLUDES were both empty
# David Kirkby, 29th Sept 2009
