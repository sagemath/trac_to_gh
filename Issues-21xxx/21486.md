I'm getting (on a Centos Linux docker image):

```
[rubiks-20070912.p18] ./spkg-install: line 144: which: command not found
```
The script uses `which` to find `install`, which does exist.

Looking at the spkg history (untar http://old.files.sagemath.org/spkg/archive/rubiks-20070912.p18.spkg and `hg view`), the reason of this apparent oddity is hg commit 283cfca20e94: `Work around Solaris problem with /usr/bin/install missing` by Michael Abshoff 2008-09-01.

Since Solaris is claimed to be [fully supported](https://wiki.sagemath.org/SupportedPlatforms#Fully_supported), we should try any fix there also (unfortunately i don ot see Solaris buildslaves anymore, but perhaps Jean-Pierre has one).

Well, rubiks is a bitrotting bundle of 3 packages, for which i am not sure upstream could be contacted (the links provided in SPKG.txt are dead). So, it will require the additional work of writing 3 fresh spkgs while i am not sure their code will evolve.

Why 3 spkgs? It would be enough to make 1 new "upstream" source package with an autotools build system and put it on [GitHub](GitHub). That's better than the current situation, with a fictional upstream source package that only exists on sage mirrors.

Right, thanks, I've fixed the description.

I wouldn't consider `which` a standard build tool. Its use in scripts is usually a bug.

`gcc` built just fine on my box, it does not seem to use `which`.

I've opened a ticket for `autotools` to fix the same issue (#21492).

#21492 does the same for `autotools`.

`gcc` `spkg-install` also uses `which`, but only on Darwin, where `which` exists. So no need for a patch.
