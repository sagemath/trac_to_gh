A bug-fix release which is needed for #20686.

```
0.24.1 (2016-07-15)
===================

Bugs fixed
----------

* IPython cell magic was lacking a good way to enable Python 3 code
  semantics.  It can now be used as "%%cython -3".

* Follow a recent change in PEP 492 and CPython 3.5.1 that now requires
  the "__aiter__()" method of asynchronous iterators to be a simple
  "def" method instead of an "async def" method.
  See https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0498/

* Coroutines and generators were lacking the "__module__" special
  attribute.

* C++ "std::complex" values failed to auto-convert from and to Python
  complex objects.

* Namespaced C++ types could not be used as memory view types due to
  a lack of name mangling.  Patch by Ivan Smirnov.

* Assignments between identical C++ types that were declared with
  differently typedefed template types could fail.

* Rebuilds could fail to evaluate dependency timestamps in C++ mode.
  Patch by Ian Henriksen.

* Macros defined in the "distutils" compiler option do not require
  values anymore.  Patch by Ian Henriksen.

* Minor fixes for MSVC, Cygwin and PyPy.
