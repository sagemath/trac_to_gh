CC:  @tscrim @fchapoton

When a warning happens in the doctester, the source filename is always replaced by `doctest`. This should be fixed.

Second, we display a complete traceback instead of just the warning message for warnings raised while doctesting.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/21191

Is it only for doctests? As I have complained here https://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-devel/-KiMrG--5x8/discussion it would be nice to have it for "regular" use as well and perhaps that fix should be done in IPython if possible.
