We currently don't have a fast callable interpreter that is specialized for ComplexField. The obvious candidate is to base one on the mpc library (although sage's [ComplexNumber](ComplexNumber) is not based on mpc!!)

<a id='comment:2'></a>There are a few copy-paste left-overs in comments (RR, mpfr instead of CC, mpc).

The library order in `# distutils: libraries =` is wrong, and I don't think you need GMP there.  But it seems redundant anyway, when you're importing from `sage.libs.{mpfr,mpc}`.

The main application would be computing the periods of algebraic Riemann surfaces. You end up with a lot of newton iterations on complex-valued polynomials to compute analytic continuations, in order to compute integrals numerically. Convincing examples require extensive code (this is functionality that I intend to contribute).

So, the simplest example is perhaps newton iteration?

```
def newton_iterate(f,z,w0):
    """ Approximate a value w such that f(z,w)=0, using Newton iteration starting at w0"""
    CC=w0.parent()
    R=f.parent()
    F=fast_callable(f,domain=CC)
    dF=fast_callable(f.derivative(R.1),domain=CC)
    delta=-F(z,w0)/dF(z,w0)
    Ndelta=delta.norm()
    w0+=delta
    while True:
        new_delta=-F(z,w0)/dF(z,w0)
        Nnew_delta=new_delta.norm()
        if Nnew_delta == 0 or Nnew_delta >= Ndelta: return w0
        delta=new_delta
        Ndelta=Nnew_delta
        w0+=delta
    
sage: R.<x,y>=QQ[]

sage: %timeit newton_iterate(f,CC(1,1),CC(1.2,1.2))
1000 loops, best of 3: 1.21 ms per loop
