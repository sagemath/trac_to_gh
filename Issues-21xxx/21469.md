**Executive summary** Currently, `--prefix` selects the install tree (`SAGE_LOCAL`) of sage-the-distribution. But often we want several builds out of (almost) the same source tree.

The `vpath` mechanism proposed here selects the build tree (`SAGE_ROOT`) of sage-the-distribution. This includes the configuration and build artefacts such as `src/build/...`.

[VPATH builds](https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/html_node/VPATH-Builds.html) are a powerful feature of autotools (and other) build systems. This feature allows the developer to build a package in a separate (initially empty) build directory tree. The source directory tree is only read from (and could even be mounted read-only) and is therefore always clean. 

This is a powerful feature for the developer because from the same source tree many different configurations can be built and tested, without having to go through "make distclean" and reconfiguration. The source tree can also be shared, for example using a networked file system between different hosts, running different architectures. Another modern use case involves VMs. For example, Docker allows to mount the source directory from the host in the VM (see #21474).

For Sage, "different configurations" could mean different architectures (via VMs), different sets of installed packages, Py2 vs Py3, etc.

This is how it is used.

```
 cd SAGE_ROOT
 autoreconf
```
and then

```
 mkdir BUILDDIR
 cd BUILDDIR
 SRCDIR/configure --srcdir=SRCDIR
 make
```

The present patch implements this. BUILDDIR from the above example is reflected in the old environment variable $SAGE_ROOT; this is now to be distinguished from SRCDIR, which is reflected in the new environment variable $SAGE_VPATH. $SAGE_LOCAL defaults to BUILDDIR/local, but can of course be changed using `configure --prefix`.

The present patch changes the various places where $SAGE_ROOT is used.
When "./configure" detects a VPATH build, it installs patched copies of `sage`, `Makefile` and `build/make/install` in BUILDDIR. 

With the current set of patches, the compilation goes through and gives a working `sage`, except for the docbuild.

The current patch makes some high-level preparations for a VPATH build, in particular the package system.

"make" runs through until it gets to sagelib, which needs some more VPATH work (the current patch tries to get away by just making a symlink from $SAGE_SRC_ROOT/src to $SAGE_ROOT/src, which of course fails).

I've set this to 'needs review' in the hope of receiving some feedback regarding the approach of this patch.

A VPATH build makes it easy to build from the same source in many different configurations. Concretely, I've started to run some VMs (with Linux 64 bit, 32 bit) via Docker, which mount the Sage source directory from the host.

Yes, this ticket does not address any of the issues that would arise in distribution packaging. 

Instead it adds a standard feature expected from autotools build system, for those who use sage as a distribution.

I sort of agree with François.

Part of the problem is that Sage is a distribution (a collection of packages) as well as a Python library. The fact this this is currently mixed up in the sources (the sources of the distribution-part and the library-part are in one repo) makes it more difficult to understand what this ticket is about.

For the distribution part, there really is no such thing as a build directory. There is a a temporary directory in `local/var/tmp/sage/build` but I would not consider that a build directory in the usual sense.

For the library part, a `VPATH` build is meaningful. Although, I think that `VPATH` builds are unusual in the Python world. Luckily, the default build directories are platform-dependendent. Anyway, it seems like this ticket isn't about that.

-It would be convenient for VPATH builds to work.
+VPATH builds are a powerful feature of autotools (and other) build systems. This feature allows the developer to build a package in a separate (initially empty) build directory tree. The source directory tree is only read from (and could even be mounted read-only) and is therefore always clean.

+The present patch implements this. BUILDDIR from the above example is reflected in the old environment variable $SAGE_ROOT; this is now to be distinguished from SRCDIR, which is reflected in the new environment variable $SAGE_SRC_ROOT. `local` is still a fixed subdirectory of $SAGE_ROOT.

The fact this this is currently mixed up in the sources (the sources of the distribution-part and the library-part are in one repo) makes it more difficult to understand what this ticket is about.

I've now clarified the goal in the description. I have not touched `sagelib` yet; but without VPATH work on sagelib, the distribution VPATH changes won't work. I could use help with the work on `sagelib`.

> For the distribution part, there really is no such thing as a build directory. There is a a temporary directory in `local/var/tmp/sage/build` but I would not consider that a build directory in the usual sense.

Right, `local/var/tmp/sage/build` falls short of being a real build directory. because for example `src/build/` has a lot of more generated stuff.

> For the library part, a `VPATH` build is meaningful. Although, I think that `VPATH` builds are unusual in the Python world. Luckily, the default build directories are platform-dependendent. Anyway, it seems like this ticket isn't about that.

Certainly there `src/build/lib.macosx-10.9-x86_64-2.7` includes the platform name, but it does not account for other configuration differences that a VPATH build can take care of (neither does `src/build/cythonized`).

It seems that `pip install` keeps the source directory clean, building instead in a temporary directory. 
`pip install` also offers options `--build` to select a build directory (though it seems as if it does not work with all packages).

On OS X, some directories are not being created:

```
$ mkdir BUILD
$ cd BUILD
$ /path/to/sage/configure --srcdir=/path/to/sage
...
/path/to/sage/configure: line 7017: build/make/Makefile: No such file or directory
```
If I create that directory, `configure` finishes but with warning messages like this

```
$ mkdir -p build/make
$ /path/to/sage/configure --srcdir=/path/to/sage
...
touch: /path/to/BUILD/src/bin/sage-env-config: No such file or directory
find: /path/to/BUILD/src/ext: No such file or directory

$ make

the documentation starts to build, but I eventually get an error:

```

Instead, I have changed `SAGE_SRC` to point to the actual source tree. This was inconsistent before.

More changes to the docbuild are necessary to separate sources from built files:

With that change, `make ptestlong` fails:

Testing that Sage starts...
[2017-08-30 09:19:29] 
This looks like the first time you are running Sage.
Cleaning up, do not interrupt this.
Done cleaning.
Yes, Sage starts.

Sage build/upgrade complete!

To install small scripts to directly run Sage's versions of GAP,
the PARI/GP interpreter, Maxima, or Singular etc. (by typing e.g.
just 'gap' or 'gp') into a standard 'bin' directory, start Sage
by typing 'sage' (or './sage') and enter something like

    install_scripts('/usr/local/bin')

at the Sage command prompt ('sage:').

It seems that you are attempting to run Sage from an unpacked source
tarball, but you have not compiled it yet (or maybe the build has not
finished). You should run `make` in the Sage root directory first.
If you did not intend to build Sage from source, you should download
a binary tarball instead. Read README.txt for more information.
************************************************************************
make: *** [ptestlong] Error 1
```
I think that the make target

```
TESTALL = $(top_srcdir)/sage -t --all
```
needs to be changed so that it runs `SAGE_ROOT/sage` instead of `SAGE_SRC_ROOT/sage`.

`./sage -t -all` also fails:

```
$ ./sage -t --all
/.../SAGE_SRC_ROOT/src/bin/sage-env: line 527: /.../BUILDDIR/src/bin/sage-arch-env: No such file or directory

This is a general problem, nothing to worry in the context of this ticket.

By the way you might like to use here the upgraded sphinx on #23023, which will most probably be in the next beta.

Unfortunately these warnings get upgraded to errors like this:

```
[dochtml] OSError: [parallel ] /Users/mkoeppe/s/sage/sage-rebasing/vpath/src/doc/en/reference/parallel/index.rst:17: WARNING: undefined label: sage.interfaces.psage (if the link has no caption the label must precede a section header)

which stops this build for me.

I'll try with  #23023 as suggested by Dima.

`make distclean` fails because `make sagelib-clean` fails:

```
cd "/.../SAGE_SRC_ROOT/src" && make -j6 clean
make[2]: warning: -jN forced in submake: disabling jobserver mode.
make[2]: *** No rule to make target `clean'.  Stop.
make[1]: *** [sagelib-clean] Error 2
```
I guess it should cd to `/.../BUILDDIR/src` instead.

Yes, this is how I am testing it (except I made `src/doc` writable).

Something in the code generator is missing error checking. I suspect it's coming from`src/sage_setup/autogen/interpreters/__init__.py`, which has some complicated exception handling.

> Where should those files be created?

They should be created in `SAGE_ROOT/src/sage/ext`.

It looks like they are actually created in `SAGE_SRC_ROOT=SAGE_VPATH`, then copied to `SAGE_ROOT/...`.

Yes, see `src/sage_setup/autogen/interpreters/__main__.py`.

we could simply modify whatever code looks for the `upstream/` directory (presumably mostly in `sage-spkg`) to explicitly look for it under `$SAGE_ROOT`.  In other words I don't see why making symlinks in the VPATH sources are necessary if we already *know* where to find the `upstream/` directory.

I hope to get back to it within the next month, but not right now. It will likely interact with some of my build-related tickets that are waiting for review...

If you need this earlier, please feel free to work on it.

I don't think comment 93 should hold up this ticket. Improvements could always be done in a follow-up ticket.
