This looks good to me. But since the new method`lc` is now a duplicate of `leading_coefficient` in univariate polynomial rings (to be compatible with multivariate polynomial rings' method `lc`, I'm wondering if:
- `leading_coefficient` should be deprecated or
- also the alias `leading_coefficient` should be supplied for the multivariate case.
