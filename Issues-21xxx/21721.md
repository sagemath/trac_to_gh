no, I think I simply used git to create/update patches.

Otherwise, this simply moves things around, right?

This ticket *edits* the patch to make it -p1 instead of -p0
Wouldn't it be better if there was a public git of the modified frobby, and a script that regenerated the patches?

I know that we don't (with [some](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/master/build/pkgs/gc/patches/0001-Workaround-missing-getcontext-in-Docker-osrf-ubuntu_.patch) [exceptions](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/tree/master/build/pkgs/scipoptsuite/patches/scip)), but my point is that it would be better if we did.
Our patch management seems ad-hoc (in contrast for example to Debian's tools and documented workflow for this)
and few people seem to be aware of `git format-patch`, which can be used to create a set of patches.
