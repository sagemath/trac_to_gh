part of the effort to move towards py3, which does not support
sorting according to a comparison function.

We will remove this after one year of deprecation.

IMHO, the job of changing it to a comparison key would be be essentially useless.

Given that python3 is still a **long** way ahead, please let us try not to spend too much time on futilities.
