part of the effort to move towards py3, which does not support
sorting according to a comparison function.

We will remove this after one year of deprecation.

This has never been used in sage, and has very probably never been used by anybody out there.

IMHO, the job of changing it to a comparison key would be be essentially useless.

Given that python3 is still a **long** way ahead, please let us try not to spend too much time on futilities.
