<div id="comment:0"></div>

The documentation of many functions in
`src/libs/singular/ `
is missing or incomplete. => fix it.

Some namings also seems unfortunate.

(Personally I was confused at least by `si2sa...()`' and `sa2si...()`' After a while I got that it was 'SingularToSage' and 'SageToSingular'
)



Depends on #17254

Component: **documentation**

Keywords: **Singular interface documentation**
