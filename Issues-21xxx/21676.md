Victor is good, not obvious to find but he does run tests with the appropriate `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` on linux at least.

Any of you have seen that while compiling singular 4? 

```
NTLconvert.cc: In function ‘CanonicalForm convertZZ2CF(const NTL::ZZ&)’:
NTLconvert.cc:509:38: error: invalid static_cast from type ‘const raw_ptr {aka _ntl_gbigint_body* const}’ to type ‘long int*’
       static_cast<long *>( a.rep.rep ); // what about NTL7?
```

It happens with and without the "nothrow" patch to `ntl`. Did I miss a patch to singular?

I did some experiments, starting with upgrading `singular` to 4.0.3p4 (without touching `ntl`)  on top of 7.5.beta0, since it contains the fix for `ntl` 10+. The plan was to change one thing at a time. You would think that it being just a patch level, it would be straightforward. Well so much for that
