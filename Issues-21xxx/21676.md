```
NTLconvert.cc: In function ‘CanonicalForm convertZZ2CF(const NTL::ZZ&)’:

And more in the same style that go to the `with opt_ctx: # we are preserving the global options state here` line before segfaulting. There are a few other original one but fixing the above would considerably reduce the number of failure all over the place.

Ideas?
