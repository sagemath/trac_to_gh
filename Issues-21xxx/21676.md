Any of you have seen that while compiling singular 4? 

```
NTLconvert.cc: In function ‘CanonicalForm convertZZ2CF(const NTL::ZZ&)’:
NTLconvert.cc:509:38: error: invalid static_cast from type ‘const raw_ptr {aka _ntl_gbigint_body* const}’ to type ‘long int*’
       static_cast<long *>( a.rep.rep ); // what about NTL7?
```

It happens with and without the "nothrow" patch to `ntl`. Did I miss a patch to singular?

```
And more in the same style that go to the `with opt_ctx: # we are preserving the global options state here` line before segfaulting. There are a few other original one but fixing the above would considerably reduce the number of failure all over the place.

Ideas?

Adding https://github.com/Singular/Sources/commit/861b7899904e3bbe3e8fe49fc0dd11ef9f5f238e to singular 4.0.3p4, I was able to compile sage-on-gentoo with ntl-10.1.0. A doc test run didn't reveal any failures from ntl.
Since we are now supporting C++11 should we enable threads in ntl (this requires C++11)?

Update to 10.1.0. The upstream tarball is no longer repackaged.

Enabling threads vould wait for another ticket?
