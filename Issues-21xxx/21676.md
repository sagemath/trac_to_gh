You want me to modify this to use the new version (which shouldn't need repacking)?
Or would someone consider to first include this version for which the modifications are much more trivial?

Any of you have seen that while compiling singular 4? 

```
NTLconvert.cc: In function ‘CanonicalForm convertZZ2CF(const NTL::ZZ&)’:
NTLconvert.cc:509:38: error: invalid static_cast from type ‘const raw_ptr {aka _ntl_gbigint_body* const}’ to type ‘long int*’
       static_cast<long *>( a.rep.rep ); // what about NTL7?
```

It happens with and without the "nothrow" patch to `ntl`. Did I miss a patch to singular?

```
And more in the same style that go to the `with opt_ctx: # we are preserving the global options state here` line before segfaulting. There are a few other original one but fixing the above would considerably reduce the number of failure all over the place.

Ideas?

Since we are now supporting C++11 should we enable threads in ntl (this requires C++11)?

Update to 10.1.0. The upstream tarball is no longer repackaged.
I merged #21631, that was surely unnecessary, but it's done.

Enabling threads vould wait for another ticket?

I wouldn't think threads would create much problems in themselves. The main problem is that all ntl dependencies needs to use a c++11 compiler. It may actually deserve another ticket because we may have to touch the sage library itself on a few key files and that's better done separately.
The other possible trouble is increased random failures in parallel doctesting because the machine is over-subscribed.
