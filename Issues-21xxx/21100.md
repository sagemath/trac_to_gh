Note: This ticket is now superseded by #21108.

When the gcd is a multivariate polynomial, it does not cancel upon scaling

```
R.<a,b>=QQ[]
P.<x,y,z>=ProjectiveSpace(R,2)
H=End(P)
f=H([a*(x+y)*x^2,b*(x+y)*y^2,(x+y)*z^2])
f.normalize_coordinates()
```

This division can be done through maxima

Reviewer: Ben Hutz

Resolution: wontfix

def normalize_coordinates(self, method=None):
    if method is None:
        # document why it is done this way
        try:
            self.normalize_coordinates(method='singular')
        except (TypeError, NotImplementedError):
            self.normalize_coordinates(method='maxima')
    elif method == 'singular':
        # do singular way
    elif method == 'maxima':
        # do maxima way
    else:
        raise ValueError("method={} not available".format(method))
```
This way you could have doctests for:
- the singular failure reported in this doctest
- comparison between maxima and singular versions

By the way, why do you catch both `TypeError` and `NotImplementedError`?

Does it work on last versions of singular?
