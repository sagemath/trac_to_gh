Note: This ticket is now superseded by #21108.

When the gcd is a multivariate polynomial, it does not cancel upon scaling

```
R.<a,b>=QQ[]
P.<x,y,z>=ProjectiveSpace(R,2)
H=End(P)
f=H([a*(x+y)*x^2,b*(x+y)*y^2,(x+y)*z^2])
f.normalize_coordinates()
```

This division can be done through maxima

Reviewer: Ben Hutz

Resolution: wontfix

This fixes the found bug. I haven't found any additional examples that we should be able to compute that we cannot. Searching for some additional difficult examples would be good.

I would prefer

```
def normalize_coordinates(self, method=None):
    if method is None:
        # document why it is done this way
        try:
            self.normalize_coordinates(method='singular')
        except (TypeError, NotImplementedError):
            self.normalize_coordinates(method='maxima')
    elif method == 'singular':
        # do singular way
    elif method == 'maxima':
        # do maxima way
    else:
        raise ValueError("method={} not available".format(method))
```
This way you could have doctests for:
- the singular failure reported in this doctest
- comparison between maxima and singular versions

By the way, why do you catch both `TypeError` and `NotImplementedError`?

Does it work on last versions of singular?

as for the most recent version of singular. I'm not sure, this fails on sage 7.3.beta9 and whatever singular is in that. I don't have a stand-alone singular.

Yes, I wasn't very happy with computing the gcd multiple times, but it did track the issue and the gcd is faster than the actual division step, so it wasn't a big performance hit in what we were doing.

I didn't experiment with the flattening code, but that sounds promising. I think it would also be useful for specialization in families.

Do you want to add the flattening functionality to polynomial rings, or have me take your flatten.py and flesh it out?

I guess the flattening can be done in another ticket. Concerning this one, it can either wait for flattening or it can be closed and refactored later on. If you have time for working on it please go ahead.

Not necessarily. In `dynatomic_polynomial` there are still problematic rings, namely

Will they appear in `normalize_coordinates`?

No, the further problematic rings treated in dynatomic don't have gcds, so it doesn't get that far.

I do think some of the special casing in dynatomic can now also be removed. I was going to do that in a different ticket.
