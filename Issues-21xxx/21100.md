```
Note: This ticket is now superseded by #21108.

When the gcd is a multivariate polynomial, it does not cancel upon scaling

```
R.<a,b>=QQ[]
P.<x,y,z>=ProjectiveSpace(R,2)
H=End(P)
f=H([a*(x+y)*x^2,b*(x+y)*y^2,(x+y)*z^2])
f.normalize_coordinates()
```

This division can be done through maxima

I would prefer

```
def normalize_coordinates(self, method=None):
    if method is None:
        # document why it is done this way
        try:
            self.normalize_coordinates(method='singular')
        except (TypeError, NotImplementedError):
            self.normalize_coordinates(method='maxima')
    elif method == 'singular':
        # do singular way
    elif method == 'maxima':
        # do maxima way
    else:
        raise ValueError("method={} not available".format(method))
```
This way you could have doctests for:
- the singular failure reported in this doctest
- comparison between maxima and singular versions

By the way, why do you catch both `TypeError` and `NotImplementedError`?

Does it work on last versions of singular?

Yes, I see the logic in that. I can do it that way.

err...I'll need to check but the NotImplementedError may not occur in this case. That is a carry over from dynatomic_polynomial where a similar thing is done. I'll look into the 'method' approach for that function too so the singular failure can be tracked.

as for the most recent version of singular. I'm not sure, this fails on sage 7.3.beta9 and whatever singular is in that. I don't have a stand-alone singular.
