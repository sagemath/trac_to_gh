```
Note: This ticket is now superseded by #21108.

When the gcd is a multivariate polynomial, it does not cancel upon scaling

```
R.<a,b>=QQ[]
P.<x,y,z>=ProjectiveSpace(R,2)
H=End(P)
f=H([a*(x+y)*x^2,b*(x+y)*y^2,(x+y)*z^2])
f.normalize_coordinates()
```

This division can be done through maxima

I would prefer

```
def normalize_coordinates(self, method=None):
    if method is None:
        # document why it is done this way
        try:
            self.normalize_coordinates(method='singular')
        except (TypeError, NotImplementedError):
            self.normalize_coordinates(method='maxima')
    elif method == 'singular':
        # do singular way
    elif method == 'maxima':
        # do maxima way
    else:
        raise ValueError("method={} not available".format(method))
```
This way you could have doctests for:
- the singular failure reported in this doctest
- comparison between maxima and singular versions

By the way, why do you catch both `TypeError` and `NotImplementedError`?

Does it work on last versions of singular?

Yes, I see the logic in that. I can do it that way.

as for the most recent version of singular. I'm not sure, this fails on sage 7.3.beta9 and whatever singular is in that. I don't have a stand-alone singular.

I did not see, but with what I proposed you might end up computing twice the GCD... don't know if it is a big problem.

Another option seems to flatten the polynomial ring in order to make singular happier

```
sage: R.<a,b> = QQ[]
sage: P.<x,y,z> = R[]
sage: p0 = a*(x+y)*x^2
sage: g = x + y
sage: p0.quo_rem(g)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: no conversion of this ring to a Singular ring defined
sage: Pflat.<x,y,z,a,b> = QQ[]
sage: p0 = Pflat(str(p0))   # conversion hack ;-)
sage: g = Pflat(g)
sage: p0.quo_rem(g)
(x^2*a, 0)
```
