Works. Mark as *positive_review* if you want, or look at two notes:

- Is there a reason for `D.iterator_edges(list(range(9))`, as `iterator_edges` can take an iterator?

- I don't like magic numbers in `range(65, 65+26)`. In principle the right solution is `string.ascii_letters`, but at least `# 65 = 'A' in character codes, 97 = 'a'` or something like that would be nice.

(But in both cases your patch do not change this, hence I did not put this to *needs_work*.)
