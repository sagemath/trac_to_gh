Various packages can be built with or without the presence of some other packages.

For example, the `latte_int` configure script detects `lrslib` and `lidia` if they are installed, and they provide additional features. `lidia` is quite a big package, and so it is not clear whether it should be a dependency. (Linux package managers have the notion of suggested or recommended packages for this situation.)

GNU make's "order-only dependencies" "sound" as if they can do this, but as Jeroen explains, they can't.

Of course, the user can just work around this issue by doing `sage -i lidia && sage -i latte_int` (or similar invocations such as `make lidia latte_int`, which are sequential from left to right thanks to our top-level Makefile), but **we must find a proper solution that ensures reproducible (deterministic) builds when a parallelized make is used**.  In particular, this is relevant after #21538, which provides `./configure --enable-lidia --enable-latte_int && MAKE=-j12 make`, for which the sequential workaround is not available. 


This feature can be implemented by Makefile trickery, of course. See #30560.


Tickets:

- #30560: `openssl` an optional dependency of `python3`

- `giac` detects `cocoa` (which we have added as an experimental package)

- `pynac` is able to use `giac` if present (but we currently explicitly disable its use)

- `latte_int` is able to use `lidia` for one subroutine -- a huge and unmaintained package; currently it is a normal dependency

- `polymake` has lots of optional dependencies

See #22491 for such an implementation (it does not pretend to address the general issue mentioned in the current ticket).

According to Matthias, one reason for not doing that could be that lidia is rather big and long to compile.

-Linux package managers have the notion of suggested or recommended packages for this situation.
-
-In any case, it would be good if whenever the user does `sage -i latte_int lidia` or `make latte_int lidia`, then `lidia` is treated as a dependency, so that the `latte_int` build is started only when the `lidia` build is completed.
-
-GNU make's "order-only dependencies" sound as if they can do this, but as Jeroen explains, they can't.
+GNU make's "order-only dependencies" "sound" as if they can do this, but as Jeroen explains, they can't.
 
 Of course, the user can just work around this issue by doing `sage -i lidia && sage -i latte_int` (or similar invocations such as `make lidia latte_int`, which are sequential from left to right thanks to our top-level Makefile), but **we must find a proper solution that ensures reproducible (deterministic) builds when a parallelized make is used**.  In particular, this is relevant after #21538, which provides `./configure --enable-lidia --enable-latte_int && MAKE=-j12 make`, for which the sequential workaround is not available.
