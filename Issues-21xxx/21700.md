Various packages can be built with or without the presence of some other packages.

For example, the `latte_int` configure script detects `lrslib` and `lidia` if they are installed, and they provide additional features. `lidia` is quite a big package, and so it is not clear whether it should be a dependency. (Linux package managers have the notion of suggested or recommended packages for this situation.)

GNU make's "order-only dependencies" "sound" as if they can do this, but as Jeroen explains, they can't.

Of course, the user can just work around this issue by doing `sage -i lidia && sage -i latte_int` (or similar invocations such as `make lidia latte_int`, which are sequential from left to right thanks to our top-level Makefile), but **we must find a proper solution that ensures reproducible (deterministic) builds when a parallelized make is used**.  In particular, this is relevant after #21538, which provides `./configure --enable-lidia --enable-latte_int && MAKE=-j12 make`, for which the sequential workaround is not available. 


This feature can be implemented by Makefile trickery, of course. See #30560.


Tickets:

- #30560: `openssl` an optional dependency of `python3`

- `giac` detects `cocoa` (which we have added as an experimental package)

- `pynac` is able to use `giac` if present (but we currently explicitly disable its use)

- `latte_int` is able to use `lidia` for one subroutine -- a huge and unmaintained package; currently it is a normal dependency

- `polymake` has lots of optional dependencies




Depends on #31017

That is an argument for *not* adding those dependencies. It's not an argument for adding them as *order-only* dependencies.

That works with a real dependency as well as an order-only dependency, so it's still not an argument for an order-only dependency.

If the user types "make latte_int" and lidia is not installed, then lidia should not be installed.
Hence an order only dependency, not a real dependency.

Like I said in [comment:10], order-only dependencies don't work that way.

It is better to do `make lidia && make latte_int` since `sage -i lidia` will build `lidia` and everything after it. (So if you have a fresh tarball, `sage -i lidia` will build all of Sage). So `sage -i lidia && sage -i latte_int` may cause some packages to be built twice.

(This isn't questioning the main point, that the order in which these are built is important and not taken care of with the current build system.)
