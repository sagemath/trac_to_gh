We should allow `singular_ring_delete(NULL)` and simply do nothing. This is analogous to `free(NULL)` which is also explicitly allowed as doing nothing.

See #21658 for why this is needed.

And yes, apart from #21658 it is typical behaviour that freeing an object can be safely done if that object contains only zero bytes. This is true for `free()` and `delete` in C++ but also `bitset_free()` in Sage and `mpz_clear()` in GMP/MPIR for example.
