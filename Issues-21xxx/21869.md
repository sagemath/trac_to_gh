+There are a number of trivial bugs that get fixed by monkey-patches in https://github.com/saraedum/mac_lane/blob/master/__init__.py
+
+1. Conversion from a Function Field to its Constant Field #21872
+2. Conversion from a Function Field to its underlying Polynomial Ring #23166
+3. Coercions between Function Fields #23167
+4. Coercions are injective if the underlying map is #21879
+5. Ring homomorphisms from Fields are injective #21879
+6. Polynomial rings embed into their fraction fields #23185
+7. The embedding of a ring into a polynomial ring over that ring is injective #23203, #23204, #23211
+8. p-adic rings embed into their fraction fields #23188
+9. Morphisms of number fields are injective #21879
+10. ZZ into QQ is injective #21879
+11. quotients of polynomial rings are injective/surjective #23190
+12. ZZ into a Number Field is injective #21879
+13. ZZ into an order of a Number Field is injective #21879
+14. ZZ does not map onto QQ #23186
+15. ~~ZpCA shifts are broken~~
+16. add default implementation of inverse_of_unit()  #23191
+
+## Add new features to Sage
+New features that the code needs to work
+
+1. Factorization over iterated extensions of finite fields. #21996
+2. ~~principal_part() and sides() of a Newton Polygon~~ (patch this in the calling code instead.)
+3. (cached_in_argument_method #22034)
+
+## Make tests non-trivial
+
+1. (some_elements() should be non-trivial for number fields/orders) #23192
+2. (some_elements() should be non-trivial/deterministic for rational function fields and their extensions) #23193

<a id='comment:38'></a>Thanks for reporting this. I think this is ok. The problem here is not that the polynomial is not integral but that the polynomial is not in the domain.

This works:

```
sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
sage: v = valuations.GaussValuation(R, QQ.valuation(2))
sage: v.reduce(x + 1/2)
ValueError: reduction not defined for non-integral elements and x + 1/2 is not integral over Gauss valuation induced by 2-adic valuation
```

This does not:

```
sage: R.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: v = valuations.GaussValuation(R, ZZ.valuation(2))
sage: v.reduce(x + 1/2)
TypeError: no canonical coercion from Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Rational Field to Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Integer Ring

<a id='comment:39'></a>You are in the wrong domain in this example I think:
This is the error you are seeing because there is no element of valuation -2 in `ZZ[x]`.

```
sage: R.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: v = valuations.GaussValuation(R, ZZ.valuation(2))
sage: v.element_with_valuation(-2)
ValueError: s must be in the value semigroup of this valuation but -2 is not in Additive Abelian Semigroup generated by 1
```

However, this works in `QQ[x]`.

```
sage: sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
sage: v = valuations.GaussValuation(R, QQ.valuation(2))
sage: v.element_with_valuation(-2)
1/4
```

Does that make sense? (Should it be documented more explicitly?)

+
+## Known Issues
+
+Some tests fail because some of the paths broke when moving the code from github into sage. The following are known problems â Julian aka saraedum is working on these:
+
+```
+sage -t --warn-long 39.1 src/sage/rings/function_field/function_field_valuation.py  # 126 doctests failed

+```
+
+# Necessary changes
+
+## Fix bugs in Sage
+There are a number of trivial bugs that get fixed by monkey-patches in https://github.com/saraedum/mac_lane/blob/master/__init__.py
+
+1. Conversion from a Function Field to its Constant Field #21872
+2. Conversion from a Function Field to its underlying Polynomial Ring #23166

+13. ZZ into an order of a Number Field is injective #21879
+14. ZZ does not map onto QQ #23186
+15. ~~ZpCA shifts are broken~~
+16. add default implementation of inverse_of_unit()  #23191
+17. R[x]âS[x] is injective/surjective if RâS is #23495
+

+
+## Known Issues
+
+Some tests fail because some of the paths broke when moving the code from github into sage. The following are known problems â Julian aka saraedum is working on these:
+
+```
+sage -t --warn-long 39.1 src/sage/rings/function_field/function_field_valuation.py  # 126 doctests failed

+```
+
+# Necessary changes
+
+## Fix bugs in Sage
+There are a number of trivial bugs that get fixed by monkey-patches in https://github.com/saraedum/mac_lane/blob/master/__init__.py
+
+1. Conversion from a Function Field to its Constant Field #21872
+2. Conversion from a Function Field to its underlying Polynomial Ring #23166
+3. Coercions between Function Fields #23167
+4. Coercions are injective if the underlying map is #21879

+12. ZZ into a Number Field is injective #21879
+13. ZZ into an order of a Number Field is injective #21879
+14. ZZ does not map onto QQ #23186
+15. ~~ZpCA shifts are broken~~
+16. add default implementation of inverse_of_unit()  #23191
+17. R[x]âS[x] is injective/surjective if RâS is #23495
+
+## Add new features to Sage
+New features that the code needs to work
+
+1. Factorization over iterated extensions of finite fields. #21996
+2. ~~principal_part() and sides() of a Newton Polygon~~ (patch this in the calling code instead.)
+3. (cached_in_argument_method #22034)
+
+## Make tests non-trivial
+
+1. (some_elements() should be non-trivial for number fields/orders) #23192
+2. (some_elements() should be non-trivial/deterministic for rational function fields and their extensions) #23193

+
+## Known Issues
+
+Some tests fail because some of the paths broke when moving the code from github into sage. The following are known problems â Julian aka saraedum is working on these:
+
+```
+sage -t --warn-long 39.1 src/sage/rings/function_field/function_field_valuation.py  # 126 doctests failed
+sage -t --warn-long 39.1 src/sage/rings/valuation/valuation.py  # 9 doctests failed

+```
+
+# Necessary changes
+
+## Fix bugs in Sage
+There are a number of trivial bugs that get fixed by monkey-patches in https://github.com/saraedum/mac_lane/blob/master/__init__.py
+
+1. Conversion from a Function Field to its Constant Field #21872
+2. Conversion from a Function Field to its underlying Polynomial Ring #23166
+3. Coercions between Function Fields #23167
+4. Coercions are injective if the underlying map is #21879
+5. Ring homomorphisms from Fields are injective #21879
+6. Polynomial rings embed into their fraction fields #23185
+7. The embedding of a ring into a polynomial ring over that ring is injective #23203, #23204, #23211
+8. p-adic rings embed into their fraction fields #23188
+9. Morphisms of number fields are injective #21879
+10. ZZ into QQ is injective #21879
+11. quotients of polynomial rings are injective/surjective #23190
+12. ZZ into a Number Field is injective #21879
+13. ZZ into an order of a Number Field is injective #21879
+14. ZZ does not map onto QQ #23186
+15. ~~ZpCA shifts are broken~~
+16. add default implementation of inverse_of_unit()  #23191
+17. R[x]âS[x] is injective/surjective if RâS is #23495
+
+## Add new features to Sage
+New features that the code needs to work
+
+1. Factorization over iterated extensions of finite fields. #21996
+2. ~~principal_part() and sides() of a Newton Polygon~~ (patch this in the calling code instead.)
+3. (cached_in_argument_method #22034)
+
+## Make tests non-trivial
+
+1. (some_elements() should be non-trivial for number fields/orders) #23192
+2. (some_elements() should be non-trivial/deterministic for rational function fields and their extensions) #23193
+3. (some_elements() should be non-trivial for fraction_fields of polynomial rings) #23194
+

+
+## Known Issues
+
+Some tests fail because some of the paths broke when moving the code from github into sage. The following are known problems â Julian aka saraedum is working on these:
+
+```

+
+# Necessary changes
+
+## Fix bugs in Sage
+There are a number of trivial bugs that get fixed by monkey-patches in https://github.com/saraedum/mac_lane/blob/master/__init__.py
+
+1. Conversion from a Function Field to its Constant Field #21872
+2. Conversion from a Function Field to its underlying Polynomial Ring #23166
+3. Coercions between Function Fields #23167
+4. Coercions are injective if the underlying map is #21879
+5. Ring homomorphisms from Fields are injective #21879

+8. p-adic rings embed into their fraction fields #23188
+9. Morphisms of number fields are injective #21879
+10. ZZ into QQ is injective #21879
+11. quotients of polynomial rings are injective/surjective #23190
+12. ZZ into a Number Field is injective #21879
+13. ZZ into an order of a Number Field is injective #21879
+14. ZZ does not map onto QQ #23186
+15. ~~ZpCA shifts are broken~~
+16. add default implementation of inverse_of_unit()  #23191
+17. R[x]âS[x] is injective/surjective if RâS is #23495
+
+## Add new features to Sage
+New features that the code needs to work
+
+1. Factorization over iterated extensions of finite fields. #21996
+2. ~~principal_part() and sides() of a Newton Polygon~~ (patch this in the calling code instead.)
+3. (cached_in_argument_method #22034)
+
+## Make tests non-trivial

+## Testing
+Because of all the dependencies of this ticket it is a bit hard to build this. If you have access to k8s, you can use the version in `~/Src/sage-mac_lane/` to try this package out. (Please do not push all the dependencies onto this branch as this is going to make reviewing this much harder.)
+
+## Known Issues
+
+Some tests fail because some of the paths broke when moving the code from github into sage. The following are known problems â Julian aka saraedum is working on these:
+
+```

+
+# Necessary changes
+
+## Fix bugs in Sage
+There are a number of trivial bugs that get fixed by monkey-patches in https://github.com/saraedum/mac_lane/blob/master/__init__.py
+
+1. Conversion from a Function Field to its Constant Field #21872
+2. Conversion from a Function Field to its underlying Polynomial Ring #23166
+3. Coercions between Function Fields #23167
+4. Coercions are injective if the underlying map is #21879
+5. Ring homomorphisms from Fields are injective #21879
+6. Polynomial rings embed into their fraction fields #23185
+7. The embedding of a ring into a polynomial ring over that ring is injective #23203, #23204, #23211
+8. p-adic rings embed into their fraction fields #23188
+9. Morphisms of number fields are injective #21879
+10. ZZ into QQ is injective #21879
+11. quotients of polynomial rings are injective/surjective #23190
+12. ZZ into a Number Field is injective #21879
+13. ZZ into an order of a Number Field is injective #21879
+14. ZZ does not map onto QQ #23186
+15. ~~ZpCA shifts are broken~~
+16. add default implementation of inverse_of_unit()  #23191
+17. R[x]âS[x] is injective/surjective if RâS is #23495
+
+## Add new features to Sage
+New features that the code needs to work
+
+1. Factorization over iterated extensions of finite fields. #21996
+2. ~~principal_part() and sides() of a Newton Polygon~~ (patch this in the calling code instead.)
+3. (cached_in_argument_method #22034)
+

+
+1. Conversion from a Function Field to its Constant Field #21872
+2. Conversion from a Function Field to its underlying Polynomial Ring #23166
+3. Coercions between Function Fields #23167
+4. Coercions are injective if the underlying map is #21879
+5. Ring homomorphisms from Fields are injective #21879
+6. Polynomial rings embed into their fraction fields #23185
+7. The embedding of a ring into a polynomial ring over that ring is injective #23203, #23204, #23211
+8. p-adic rings embed into their fraction fields #23188
+9. Morphisms of number fields are injective #21879

+
+## Known Issues
+
+Some tests fail because some of the paths broke when moving the code from github into sage. The following are known problems â Julian aka saraedum is working on these:
+
+```

+
+# Necessary changes
+
+## Fix bugs in Sage
+There are a number of trivial bugs that get fixed by monkey-patches in https://github.com/saraedum/mac_lane/blob/master/__init__.py

+Because of all the dependencies of this ticket it is a bit hard to build this. If you have access to k8s, you can use the version in `~/Src/sage-mac_lane/` to try this package out. (Please do not push all the dependencies onto this branch as this is going to make reviewing this much harder.)
+
+## Known Issues
+
+Some tests fail because some of the paths broke when moving the code from github into sage. The following are known problems â Julian aka saraedum is working on these:
+
+```

+# Necessary changes
+
+## Fix bugs in Sage
+There are a number of trivial bugs that get fixed by monkey-patches in https://github.com/saraedum/mac_lane/blob/master/__init__.py
+
+1. Conversion from a Function Field to its Constant Field #21872
+2. Conversion from a Function Field to its underlying Polynomial Ring #23166

+## Known Issues
+
+Some tests fail because some of the paths broke when moving the code from github into sage. The following are known problems â Julian aka saraedum is working on these:
+
+```

+```
+
+# Necessary changes
+
+## Fix bugs in Sage
+There are a number of trivial bugs that get fixed by monkey-patches in https://github.com/saraedum/mac_lane/blob/master/__init__.py
+
+1. Conversion from a Function Field to its Constant Field #21872
+2. Conversion from a Function Field to its underlying Polynomial Ring #23166

+16. add default implementation of inverse_of_unit()  #23191
+17. R[x]âS[x] is injective/surjective if RâS is #23495
+
+## Add new features to Sage
+New features that the code needs to work
+
+1. Factorization over iterated extensions of finite fields. #21996
+2. ~~principal_part() and sides() of a Newton Polygon~~ (patch this in the calling code instead.)
+3. (cached_in_argument_method #22034)
+
+## Make tests non-trivial
+
+1. (some_elements() should be non-trivial for number fields/orders) #23192
+2. (some_elements() should be non-trivial/deterministic for rational function fields and their extensions) #23193
+3. (some_elements() should be non-trivial for fraction_fields of polynomial rings) #23194

+## Testing
+Because of all the dependencies of this ticket it is a bit hard to build this. If you have access to k8s, you can use the version in `~/Src/sage-mac_lane/` to try this package out. (Please do not push all the dependencies onto this branch as this is going to make reviewing this much harder.)

+## Known Issues
+
+Some tests fail because some of the paths broke when moving the code from github into sage. The following are known problems â Julian aka saraedum is working on these:

+# Necessary changes
+
+## Fix bugs in Sage
+There are a number of trivial bugs that get fixed by monkey-patches in https://github.com/saraedum/mac_lane/blob/master/__init__.py
+
+1. Conversion from a Function Field to its Constant Field #21872
+2. Conversion from a Function Field to its underlying Polynomial Ring #23166
+3. Coercions between Function Fields #23167
+4. Coercions are injective if the underlying map is #21879
+5. Ring homomorphisms from Fields are injective #21879
+6. Polynomial rings embed into their fraction fields #23185
+7. The embedding of a ring into a polynomial ring over that ring is injective #23203, #23204, #23211
+8. p-adic rings embed into their fraction fields #23188
+9. Morphisms of number fields are injective #21879
+10. ZZ into QQ is injective #21879
+11. quotients of polynomial rings are injective/surjective #23190
+12. ZZ into a Number Field is injective #21879
+13. ZZ into an order of a Number Field is injective #21879
+14. ZZ does not map onto QQ #23186
+15. ~~ZpCA shifts are broken~~
+16. add default implementation of inverse_of_unit()  #23191
+17. R[x]âS[x] is injective/surjective if RâS is #23495
+
+## Add new features to Sage
+New features that the code needs to work
+
+1. Factorization over iterated extensions of finite fields. #21996
+2. ~~principal_part() and sides() of a Newton Polygon~~ (patch this in the calling code instead.)
+3. (cached_in_argument_method #22034)
+
+## Make tests non-trivial
+
+1. (some_elements() should be non-trivial for number fields/orders) #23192
+2. (some_elements() should be non-trivial/deterministic for rational function fields and their extensions) #23193
+3. (some_elements() should be non-trivial for fraction_fields of polynomial rings) #23194
+
+## Add the valuation code to Sage
+
+i.e., add these files https://github.com/saraedum/mac_lane to Sage.

+## Fix bugs in Sage
+There are a number of trivial bugs that get fixed by monkey-patches in https://github.com/saraedum/mac_lane/blob/master/__init__.py
+
+1. Conversion from a Function Field to its Constant Field #21872
+2. Conversion from a Function Field to its underlying Polynomial Ring #23166
+3. Coercions between Function Fields #23167
+4. Coercions are injective if the underlying map is #21879
+5. Ring homomorphisms from Fields are injective #21879
+6. Polynomial rings embed into their fraction fields #23185
+7. The embedding of a ring into a polynomial ring over that ring is injective #23203, #23204, #23211
+8. p-adic rings embed into their fraction fields #23188
+9. Morphisms of number fields are injective #21879
+10. ZZ into QQ is injective #21879
+11. quotients of polynomial rings are injective/surjective #23190
+12. ZZ into a Number Field is injective #21879
+13. ZZ into an order of a Number Field is injective #21879
+14. ZZ does not map onto QQ #23186
+15. ~~ZpCA shifts are broken~~
+16. add default implementation of inverse_of_unit()  #23191
+17. R[x]âS[x] is injective/surjective if RâS is #23495
+
+## Add new features to Sage
+New features that the code needs to work
+
+1. Factorization over iterated extensions of finite fields. #21996
+2. ~~principal_part() and sides() of a Newton Polygon~~ (patch this in the calling code instead.)
+3. (cached_in_argument_method #22034)
+
+## Make tests non-trivial
+
+1. (some_elements() should be non-trivial for number fields/orders) #23192
+2. (some_elements() should be non-trivial/deterministic for rational function fields and their extensions) #23193
+3. (some_elements() should be non-trivial for fraction_fields of polynomial rings) #23194
+
+## Add the valuation code to Sage
+
+i.e., add these files https://github.com/saraedum/mac_lane to Sage.

+## Fix bugs in Sage
+There are a number of trivial bugs that get fixed by monkey-patches in https://github.com/saraedum/mac_lane/blob/master/__init__.py
+
+1. Conversion from a Function Field to its Constant Field #21872
+2. Conversion from a Function Field to its underlying Polynomial Ring #23166
+3. Coercions between Function Fields #23167
+4. Coercions are injective if the underlying map is #21879
+5. Ring homomorphisms from Fields are injective #21879
+6. Polynomial rings embed into their fraction fields #23185
+7. The embedding of a ring into a polynomial ring over that ring is injective #23203, #23204, #23211
+8. p-adic rings embed into their fraction fields #23188
+9. Morphisms of number fields are injective #21879
+10. ZZ into QQ is injective #21879
+11. quotients of polynomial rings are injective/surjective #23190
+12. ZZ into a Number Field is injective #21879
+13. ZZ into an order of a Number Field is injective #21879
+14. ZZ does not map onto QQ #23186
+15. ~~ZpCA shifts are broken~~
+16. add default implementation of inverse_of_unit()  #23191
+17. R[x]âS[x] is injective/surjective if RâS is #23495
+
+## Add new features to Sage
+New features that the code needs to work
+
+1. Factorization over iterated extensions of finite fields. #21996
+2. ~~principal_part() and sides() of a Newton Polygon~~ (patch this in the calling code instead.)
+3. (cached_in_argument_method #22034)
+
+## Make tests non-trivial
+
+1. (some_elements() should be non-trivial for number fields/orders) #23192
+2. (some_elements() should be non-trivial/deterministic for rational function fields and their extensions) #23193
+3. (some_elements() should be non-trivial for fraction_fields of polynomial rings) #23194

+## Known Issues
+
+Some tests fail because some of the paths broke when moving the code from github into sage. The following are known problems â Julian aka saraedum is working on these:
+
+```
+src/sage/rings/valuation/inductive_valuation.py  # 10 doctests failed
+src/sage/rings/padics/padic_valuation.py  # 10 doctests failed
+src/sage/rings/valuation/valuation.py  # 26 doctests failed
+src/sage/rings/valuation/augmented_valuation.py  # 7 doctests failed
+```
+
+# Necessary changes
+
+## Fix bugs in Sage
+There are a number of trivial bugs that get fixed by monkey-patches in https://github.com/saraedum/mac_lane/blob/master/__init__.py
+
+1. Conversion from a Function Field to its Constant Field #21872
+2. Conversion from a Function Field to its underlying Polynomial Ring #23166
+3. Coercions between Function Fields #23167
+4. Coercions are injective if the underlying map is #21879
+5. Ring homomorphisms from Fields are injective #21879
+6. Polynomial rings embed into their fraction fields #23185
+7. The embedding of a ring into a polynomial ring over that ring is injective #23203, #23204, #23211
+8. p-adic rings embed into their fraction fields #23188
+9. Morphisms of number fields are injective #21879
+10. ZZ into QQ is injective #21879
+11. quotients of polynomial rings are injective/surjective #23190
+12. ZZ into a Number Field is injective #21879
+13. ZZ into an order of a Number Field is injective #21879
+14. ZZ does not map onto QQ #23186
+15. ~~ZpCA shifts are broken~~
+16. add default implementation of inverse_of_unit()  #23191
+17. R[x]âS[x] is injective/surjective if RâS is #23495
+
+## Add new features to Sage
+New features that the code needs to work
+
+1. Factorization over iterated extensions of finite fields. #21996
+2. ~~principal_part() and sides() of a Newton Polygon~~ (patch this in the calling code instead.)
+3. (cached_in_argument_method #22034)
+
+## Make tests non-trivial
+
+1. (some_elements() should be non-trivial for number fields/orders) #23192
+2. (some_elements() should be non-trivial/deterministic for rational function fields and their extensions) #23193
+3. (some_elements() should be non-trivial for fraction_fields of polynomial rings) #23194

+## Testing
+Because of all the dependencies of this ticket it is a bit hard to build this. If you have access to k8s, you can use the version in `~/Src/sage-mac_lane/` to try this package out. (Please do not push all the dependencies onto this branch as this is going to make reviewing this much harder.)

+## Known Issues
+
+Some tests fail because some of the paths broke when moving the code from github into sage. The following are known problems â Julian aka saraedum is working on these:
+
+```
+sage -t src/sage/rings/valuation/valuation.py  # 6 doctests failed
+sage -t src/sage/rings/valuation/valuation.py  # 6 doctests failed
+sage -t src/sage/rings/function_field/function_field_valuation.py  # 1 doctest failed
+sage -t src/sage/rings/padics/padic_valuation.py  # 4 doctests failed
+```
+
+# Necessary changes
+
+## Fix bugs in Sage
+There are a number of trivial bugs that get fixed by monkey-patches in https://github.com/saraedum/mac_lane/blob/master/__init__.py
+
+1. Conversion from a Function Field to its Constant Field #21872
+2. Conversion from a Function Field to its underlying Polynomial Ring #23166
+3. Coercions between Function Fields #23167
+4. Coercions are injective if the underlying map is #21879
+5. Ring homomorphisms from Fields are injective #21879
+6. Polynomial rings embed into their fraction fields #23185
+7. The embedding of a ring into a polynomial ring over that ring is injective #23203, #23204, #23211
+8. p-adic rings embed into their fraction fields #23188
+9. Morphisms of number fields are injective #21879
+10. ZZ into QQ is injective #21879
+11. quotients of polynomial rings are injective/surjective #23190
+12. ZZ into a Number Field is injective #21879
+13. ZZ into an order of a Number Field is injective #21879
+14. ZZ does not map onto QQ #23186
+15. ~~ZpCA shifts are broken~~
+16. add default implementation of inverse_of_unit()  #23191
+17. R[x]âS[x] is injective/surjective if RâS is #23495
+
+## Add new features to Sage
+New features that the code needs to work
+
+1. Factorization over iterated extensions of finite fields. #21996
+2. ~~principal_part() and sides() of a Newton Polygon~~ (patch this in the calling code instead.)
+3. (cached_in_argument_method #22034)
+
+## Make tests non-trivial
+
+1. (some_elements() should be non-trivial for number fields/orders) #23192
+2. (some_elements() should be non-trivial/deterministic for rational function fields and their extensions) #23193
+3. (some_elements() should be non-trivial for fraction_fields of polynomial rings) #23194
+
+## Add the valuation code to Sage
+
+i.e., add these files https://github.com/saraedum/mac_lane to Sage.

+Because of all the dependencies of this ticket it is a bit hard to build this. If you have access to k8s, you can use the version in `~/Src/sage-mac_lane/` to try this package out. (Please do not push all the dependencies onto this branch as this is going to make reviewing this much harder.)

+## Known Issues
+
+Some tests fail because some of the paths broke when moving the code from github into sage. The following are known problems â Julian aka saraedum is working on these:
+
+```
+sage -t src/sage/rings/valuation/valuation.py  # 6 doctests failed
+sage -t src/sage/rings/padics/padic_valuation.py  # 4 doctests failed
+```
+
+# Necessary changes
+
+## Fix bugs in Sage
+There are a number of trivial bugs that get fixed by monkey-patches in https://github.com/saraedum/mac_lane/blob/master/__init__.py
+
+1. Conversion from a Function Field to its Constant Field #21872
+2. Conversion from a Function Field to its underlying Polynomial Ring #23166
+3. Coercions between Function Fields #23167
+4. Coercions are injective if the underlying map is #21879
+5. Ring homomorphisms from Fields are injective #21879
+6. Polynomial rings embed into their fraction fields #23185
+7. The embedding of a ring into a polynomial ring over that ring is injective #23203, #23204, #23211
+8. p-adic rings embed into their fraction fields #23188
+9. Morphisms of number fields are injective #21879
+10. ZZ into QQ is injective #21879
+11. quotients of polynomial rings are injective/surjective #23190
+12. ZZ into a Number Field is injective #21879
+13. ZZ into an order of a Number Field is injective #21879
+14. ZZ does not map onto QQ #23186
+15. ~~ZpCA shifts are broken~~
+16. add default implementation of inverse_of_unit()  #23191
+17. R[x]âS[x] is injective/surjective if RâS is #23495
+
+## Add new features to Sage
+New features that the code needs to work
+
+1. Factorization over iterated extensions of finite fields. #21996
+2. ~~principal_part() and sides() of a Newton Polygon~~ (patch this in the calling code instead.)
+3. (cached_in_argument_method #22034)
+
+## Make tests non-trivial
+
+1. (some_elements() should be non-trivial for number fields/orders) #23192
+2. (some_elements() should be non-trivial/deterministic for rational function fields and their extensions) #23193
+3. (some_elements() should be non-trivial for fraction_fields of polynomial rings) #23194
+
+## Add the valuation code to Sage
+
+i.e., add these files https://github.com/saraedum/mac_lane to Sage.

+## Testing
+Because of all the dependencies of this ticket it is a bit hard to build this. If you have access to k8s, you can use the version in `~/Src/sage-mac_lane/` to try this package out. (Please do not push all the dependencies onto this branch as this is going to make reviewing this much harder.)

+## Known Issues
+
+Some tests fail because some of the paths broke when moving the code from github into sage. The following are known problems â Julian aka saraedum is working on these:
+
+```
+sage -t src/sage/rings/valuation/valuation.py  # 5 doctests failed
+sage -t src/sage/rings/padics/padic_valuation.py  # 3 doctests failed
+```
+
+# Necessary changes
+
+## Fix bugs in Sage
+There are a number of trivial bugs that get fixed by monkey-patches in https://github.com/saraedum/mac_lane/blob/master/__init__.py
+
+1. Conversion from a Function Field to its Constant Field #21872
+2. Conversion from a Function Field to its underlying Polynomial Ring #23166
+3. Coercions between Function Fields #23167
+4. Coercions are injective if the underlying map is #21879
+5. Ring homomorphisms from Fields are injective #21879
+6. Polynomial rings embed into their fraction fields #23185
+7. The embedding of a ring into a polynomial ring over that ring is injective #23203, #23204, #23211
+8. p-adic rings embed into their fraction fields #23188
+9. Morphisms of number fields are injective #21879
+10. ZZ into QQ is injective #21879
+11. quotients of polynomial rings are injective/surjective #23190
+12. ZZ into a Number Field is injective #21879
+13. ZZ into an order of a Number Field is injective #21879
+14. ZZ does not map onto QQ #23186
+15. ~~ZpCA shifts are broken~~
+16. add default implementation of inverse_of_unit()  #23191
+17. R[x]âS[x] is injective/surjective if RâS is #23495
+
+## Add new features to Sage
+New features that the code needs to work
+
+1. Factorization over iterated extensions of finite fields. #21996
+2. ~~principal_part() and sides() of a Newton Polygon~~ (patch this in the calling code instead.)
+3. (cached_in_argument_method #22034)
+
+## Make tests non-trivial
+
+1. (some_elements() should be non-trivial for number fields/orders) #23192
+2. (some_elements() should be non-trivial/deterministic for rational function fields and their extensions) #23193
+3. (some_elements() should be non-trivial for fraction_fields of polynomial rings) #23194
+
+## Add the valuation code to Sage
+
+i.e., add these files https://github.com/saraedum/mac_lane to Sage.

+## Known Issues
+
+Some tests fail because some of the paths broke when moving the code from github into sage. The following are known problems â Julian aka saraedum is working on these:
+
+```
+sage -t src/sage/rings/valuation/valuation.py  # 4 doctests failed
+sage -t src/sage/rings/padics/padic_valuation.py  # 2 doctests failed
+```
+
+# Necessary changes
+
+## Fix bugs in Sage
+There are a number of trivial bugs that get fixed by monkey-patches in https://github.com/saraedum/mac_lane/blob/master/__init__.py
+
+1. Conversion from a Function Field to its Constant Field #21872
+2. Conversion from a Function Field to its underlying Polynomial Ring #23166
+3. Coercions between Function Fields #23167
+4. Coercions are injective if the underlying map is #21879
+5. Ring homomorphisms from Fields are injective #21879
+6. Polynomial rings embed into their fraction fields #23185
+7. The embedding of a ring into a polynomial ring over that ring is injective #23203, #23204, #23211
+8. p-adic rings embed into their fraction fields #23188
+9. Morphisms of number fields are injective #21879
+10. ZZ into QQ is injective #21879
+11. quotients of polynomial rings are injective/surjective #23190
+12. ZZ into a Number Field is injective #21879
+13. ZZ into an order of a Number Field is injective #21879
+14. ZZ does not map onto QQ #23186
+15. ~~ZpCA shifts are broken~~
+16. add default implementation of inverse_of_unit()  #23191
+17. R[x]âS[x] is injective/surjective if RâS is #23495
+
+## Add new features to Sage
+New features that the code needs to work
+
+1. Factorization over iterated extensions of finite fields. #21996
+2. ~~principal_part() and sides() of a Newton Polygon~~ (patch this in the calling code instead.)
+3. (cached_in_argument_method #22034)
+
+## Make tests non-trivial
+
+1. (some_elements() should be non-trivial for number fields/orders) #23192
+2. (some_elements() should be non-trivial/deterministic for rational function fields and their extensions) #23193
+3. (some_elements() should be non-trivial for fraction_fields of polynomial rings) #23194

+## Testing
+Because of all the dependencies of this ticket it is a bit hard to build this. If you have access to k8s, you can use the version in `~/Src/sage-mac_lane/` to try this package out. (Please do not push all the dependencies onto this branch as this is going to make reviewing this much harder.)

+## Fix bugs in Sage
+There are a number of trivial bugs that get fixed by monkey-patches in https://github.com/saraedum/mac_lane/blob/master/__init__.py
+
+1. Conversion from a Function Field to its Constant Field #21872
+2. Conversion from a Function Field to its underlying Polynomial Ring #23166
+3. Coercions between Function Fields #23167
+4. Coercions are injective if the underlying map is #21879
+5. Ring homomorphisms from Fields are injective #21879
+6. Polynomial rings embed into their fraction fields #23185
+7. The embedding of a ring into a polynomial ring over that ring is injective #23203, #23204, #23211
+8. p-adic rings embed into their fraction fields #23188
+9. Morphisms of number fields are injective #21879
+10. ZZ into QQ is injective #21879
+11. quotients of polynomial rings are injective/surjective #23190
+12. ZZ into a Number Field is injective #21879
+13. ZZ into an order of a Number Field is injective #21879
+14. ZZ does not map onto QQ #23186
+15. ~~ZpCA shifts are broken~~
+16. add default implementation of inverse_of_unit()  #23191
+17. R[x]âS[x] is injective/surjective if RâS is #23495
+
+## Add new features to Sage
+New features that the code needs to work
+
+1. Factorization over iterated extensions of finite fields. #21996
+2. ~~principal_part() and sides() of a Newton Polygon~~ (patch this in the calling code instead.)
+3. (cached_in_argument_method #22034)
+
+## Make tests non-trivial
+
+1. (some_elements() should be non-trivial for number fields/orders) #23192
+2. (some_elements() should be non-trivial/deterministic for rational function fields and their extensions) #23193
+3. (some_elements() should be non-trivial for fraction_fields of polynomial rings) #23194

I see your point, but it's not the job of `valuation.py` to document technical details of the coercion model. I ask because I plan to change the behaviour of comparisons in #22029.
