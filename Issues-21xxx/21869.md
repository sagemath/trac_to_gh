<a id='comment:38'></a>Thanks for reporting this. I think this is ok. The problem here is not that the polynomial is not integral but that the polynomial is not in the domain.

This works:

```
sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
sage: v = valuations.GaussValuation(R, QQ.valuation(2))
sage: v.reduce(x + 1/2)
ValueError: reduction not defined for non-integral elements and x + 1/2 is not integral over Gauss valuation induced by 2-adic valuation
```

This does not:

```
sage: R.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: v = valuations.GaussValuation(R, ZZ.valuation(2))
sage: v.reduce(x + 1/2)
TypeError: no canonical coercion from Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Rational Field to Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Integer Ring
```

<a id='comment:39'></a>You are in the wrong domain in this example I think:
This is the error you are seeing because there is no element of valuation -2 in `ZZ[x]`.

```
sage: R.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: v = valuations.GaussValuation(R, ZZ.valuation(2))
sage: v.element_with_valuation(-2)
ValueError: s must be in the value semigroup of this valuation but -2 is not in Additive Abelian Semigroup generated by 1
```

However, this works in `QQ[x]`.

```
sage: sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
sage: v = valuations.GaussValuation(R, QQ.valuation(2))
sage: v.element_with_valuation(-2)
1/4
```

Does that make sense? (Should it be documented more explicitly?)

<a id='comment:9'></a>In `index.rst` there are some `\QQ`s that should probably be `\Q`s.  Have you tried building the documentation recently?  I'm surprised this didn't cause problems....

Is there a place I can look at the generated documentation online?  It might be easier to catch some kinds of problems there.

        :meth:`sage.structure.element.Element.__richcmp__`. When the valuations
        do not coerce into a common parent, a rather random comparison of
        ``id`` happens::

            sage: w = valuations.TrivialValuation(GF(2))
            sage: w <= v # random output
            True
            sage: v <= w # random output
            False
```
I plan to remove them in #26934

I see your point, but it's not the job of `valuation.py` to document technical details of the coercion model. I ask because I plan to change the behaviour of comparisons in #22029.
