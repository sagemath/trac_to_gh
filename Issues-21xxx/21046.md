I propose here to add fast modular symbols for elliptic curves. The proposed changes would add a cython file containing the new code to work with numerical modular symbols and integrate them for using for elliptic curves and their p-adic L-functions.

The idea is similar to #6666, where "analytic modular symbols" were added to elliptic curves. However the code there is very slow and this ticket would replace that code completely. 

So a modular symbol for a given elliptic curve can be computed using numerical integration on the upper half plane rather than using linear algebra to determine the space of all modular symbols of level N first. Unlike #6666, we use rigorous bounds on the error of computations to be certain that we get the correct rational number.

The code here compares in speed with eclib and is wayway faster than the python code within sage. When computing a single modular symbol or a few with small denominator, the code here is much faster than eclib and can cope with conductors in the millions. When computing all manin symbols for one curve, the speed is in the same order as for eclib for semistable curves, but sometimes slower.

<div id="comment:5" align="right">comment:5</div>

I have started reading the code, as a first step to reviewing this.  As I read I will note here some trivial things so they do not get lost.

- good documentation of the underlying mathematics!
- in one place you talk about making the precision "small" where there is a default prec=53, so haps that should be "large".
- "eclib" is "ec lib" in one place at least.
- After "The Manin constant for the `X_0`-optimal curve should be `1` if the curve lies outside the Cremona tables" you could add that with the range of the tables this is proved!  (That is perhaps implicit anyway, but not explicit.)
  - since you can call M(r) with a sign other than the one with which M was created, why specify a sign on creation at all?  Is it just to set a default?
  - the method M.value_r_to_rr() is rather a clumsy name.  Can you not make this just M(r,rr), where rr defaults in infinity?

Someone who knows cython should look at the code too (robertb?)

It seems a pity to me that you need a new class for your cusps rather than adding to the existing class.

In one place you mention that I do not always guarantee the optimal curve, which is correct (though I always guarantee c=1, if necessary by computing the full modular symbol not just the plus symbol).  See https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JohnCremona/ecdata/master/doc/manin.txt
I am not sure what is going on where you multiply t0 by 2 "just in case".

In one place you divide D by the maximal power of a prime l.  You could there use

   sage: N=10^10
   sage: N.prime_to_m_part(5)
   1024

The underlying summations to give the numerical values are of course also implemented in eclib (to arbitrary precision there too).  One day it would be possible to add the relevant functions to the eclib interface and use that (compiled C, possibly fater than cython).

In the function where it says that setup_twist needs to be called first, should there be a flag to indicate that that has been done (and calls the setup here if not set)?  Safer?

That's all for now.  I did read through all the code, but not that thoroughly, and have not started to build or test!

Hi John,

I am rebasing it now and I am trying to put in your comments already. I hope I have a new version soon.

Replying to [@JohnCremona](#comment:5):

> - in one place you talk about making the precision "small" where there is a default prec=53, so haps that should be "large".

I am trying to find that.

> - After "The Manin constant for the `X_0`-optimal curve should be `1` if the curve lies outside the Cremona tables" you could add that with the range of the tables this is proved!  (That is perhaps implicit anyway, but not explicit.)

done.

> - since you can call M(r) with a sign other than the one with which M was created, why specify a sign on creation at all?  Is it just to set a default?
> - the method M.value_r_to_rr() is rather a clumsy name.  Can you not make this just M(r,rr), where rr defaults in infinity?

I modelled `__call__` on the other modular symbols, so that `E.modular_symbol(implementation...)` all have the same call function.
Hence the possibility for the user to specify the dafault sign.

On second thought, I decided to make `value__r_to_rr` and `value_r_to_ioo` inaccessible. The reason is that the function as implemented only works for unitary cusps anyway. I can not see a use of having M(r,rr). The origin is a canonincal base-point for homology on E. Anyway, it would not take much longer to write M(r)-M(rr).

> Someone who knows cython should look at the code too (robertb?)

Sure, if we can motivate someone.

> It seems a pity to me that you need a new class for your cusps rather than adding to the existing class.

Maybe the name is misleading. This is really a rational point on the boundary of the upper half plane, not a point on a modular curve. I did not want to load anything heavy just for computing W_r.

> In one place you mention that I do not always guarantee the optimal curve, which is correct (though I always guarantee c=1, if necessary by computing the full modular symbol not just the plus symbol).  See https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JohnCremona/ecdata/master/doc/manin.txt
> I am not sure what is going on where you multiply t0 by 2 "just in case".

There is not a unique maximal curve in the isogeny class. Any two maximal ones are linked by a two isogeny to a common curve. So if we had the wrong maximal curve then an extra factor 2 will guarantee that we only assume that the Manin constant for one of the curves in the class is trivial. Moreover the Manin constant for semistable curves is known to be 1 or 2, so it is really a harmless precaution.

True. It would then make more sense to transport the whole code. But that is going to happen after my retirement, I fear.

The flag is that `_D` is set to -1. That is change in `_twisted_symbol`, too.

Sorry I am new to this, I think this should to be checked:

```
ainvs = [1, -1, 1, -1391, -25849]
E = EllipticCurve(ainvs)
M = E.modular_symbol(implementation="num")
M(1/2), M(1/5)
L = E.padic_lseries(5, implementation = 'num')
```
returns the following:
