Minor thing: `TESTS:` -> `TESTS::`.

Posting here the timings in the commit message for easier reference. Before:

```
sage: n = polygen(ZZ, 'n')
sage: pol = (n + 3)^5
sage: two = ZZ(2)
sage: three = int(3)
sage: %timeit pol(two)
The slowest run took 33.54 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
1000000 loops, best of 3: 206 ns per loop
sage: %timeit pol(three)
The slowest run took 29.94 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
1000000 loops, best of 3: 271 ns per loop
sage: x = polygen(QQ, 'x')
sage: pol2 = (x + 3)^5
sage: %timeit pol2(two)
The slowest run took 28.23 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
1000000 loops, best of 3: 422 ns per loop
sage: %timeit pol2(three)
The slowest run took 6.67 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
100000 loops, best of 3: 12.1 Âµs per loop
```
After:

```
sage: n = polygen(ZZ, 'n')
sage: pol = (n + 3)^5
sage: two = ZZ(2)
sage: three = int(3)
sage: %timeit pol(two)
The slowest run took 46.40 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
1000000 loops, best of 3: 195 ns per loop
sage: %timeit pol(three)
The slowest run took 31.22 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
10000000 loops, best of 3: 191 ns per loop
sage: x = polygen(QQ, 'x')
sage: pol2 = (x + 3)^5
sage: %timeit pol2(two)
The slowest run took 21.70 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
1000000 loops, best of 3: 406 ns per loop
sage: %timeit pol2(three)
The slowest run took 24.00 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
1000000 loops, best of 3: 457 ns per loop
```

Edit: Must look closer at the timings.
