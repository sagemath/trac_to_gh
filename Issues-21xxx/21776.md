The code for computing Galois representations of elliptic curves over number fields (which is used in isogeny computation) uses the default iterator over primes of degree 1 in the number field.  Two problems: first, the method K.primes_of_degree_one_iter() only gives primes up to some norm bound, and that is not always large enough if left at the default.  Second, where the function is used only principal primes are wanted but the iterator starts at 2 wheras there are no principal primes of norm less than discriminant/4!

I put in a custom iterator which helps a lot.

I will upload a patch when I have recovered an example which fails badly.

<a id='comment:2'></a>Two small things:

```diff
-    for l in D:
+    for l in D.iterkeys():
```
This change is unnecessary as the iteration over a dictionary is the keys (and `iterkeys` is going away in Python3).
Also, `xrange` is going away in Python3, so you should revert that change because the `from six.moves import range` already makes `range` an iterator, not a list.

I did not know that -- and in fact one thing I had done was to make the reverse change, thinking it was somehow more efficient.  Thanks.

I am happy with the changes since my commits.  What next?
