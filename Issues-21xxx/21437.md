Modules using the optional MeatAxe package need the following initialisation:

- MeatAxe executables rely on an environment variable declaring where to find multiplication tables. Of course, this needs to be done only once.
- Each module that links against the MeatAxe library, which is a static library, has to define a certain C variable, which serves the same purpose as the aforementioned environment variable.

I suggest to add here a function that does the initialisation and must be called be each module using MeatAxe functions. For that purpose, a new module `sage.libs.meataxe` is created.

Keywords: MeatAxe, matrix backend

Maybe it isn't strange after all. It is about a random test. The values I provide in the test are what I get when I start a fresh Sage session, but probably I forgot that the random seed in doctests is different.

Somewhere I was reading that sig_on/sig_off should be used if there are potentially long c commands, whereas in the code above (only very short commands are executed in tight loops) one should use sig_check.

Did I describe the intended use of sig_* correctly?

Working on #18514, I found that the situation is confusing for me.

My plan was:

- With the current code from here and #23352, `sage.matrix.matrix_gfpn_dense` overrides the MtxLibDir variable that is declared in `sage.libs.meataxe`, but it doesn't touch the environment variables.
- The cohomology code cimports MtxLibDir from `sage.matrix.matrix_gfpn_dense` and reads its content. It is then also written into an environment variable, so that the MTX-executables can find the multiplication tables.

The reality is:

- When the cohomology code cimports MtxLibDir, its content is a certain location in `/usr/local/`, which is where the multiplication tables can NOT be found. Thus, any computation crashes.

If I recall correctly, the reason for the bad behaviour is the fact that the meataxe library is a dynamic, not a static, library. Hence, any Cython module and any C program using meataxe has to define MtxLibDir explicitly: Cimporting it won't suffice.

I think I have removed all such cases. `sig_on()` now only appears three times in the code, namely

```python
        sig_on()
        OUT.Data = MatDup(self.Data)
        MatMul(OUT.Data,right.Data)
        sig_off()
```

```python
        sig_on()
        MatMulStrassen(OUT.Data, self.Data, right.Data)
        sig_off()
```

```python
        sig_on()
        try:
            OUT.Data = MatInverse(self.Data)
        except ZeroDivisionError:
            sig_off()
            raise
        sig_off()
```
It doesn't involve python code, right?

Example, with the latest commit:

```
sage: M = random_matrix(GF(81,'x'),1000)
MTX location /usr/local/mtx/lib
os.c(254):p081.zzz: No such file or directory
```
which is an unhandled crash. So, both MtxLibDir is not visible for `sage.matrix.matrix_gfpn_dense` (otherwise meataxe would find the multiplication table) and the error handler is not defined (otherwise it would raise an error rather than crash).

How can this be overcome?

By this, I mean: We have modules A,B,C, and A is supposed to do some initialisation to a dynamic library that A, B and C link against. Is it possible to make it so that "import A" in B and C automatically executes code that will do the initialisation in B resp. in C rather than only in A?

Here, we have A=sage.libs.meataxe, B=sage.matrix.matrix_gfpn_dense and C=the cohomology code from #18514

You're swapping "static" and "dynamic" but otherwise you are right: the problem with static libraries is that each Cython module gets its own "copy" of the static library.

Here is a better idea: in `meataxe.pxd`, define an inline function

```
cdef inline init_meataxe():
    # set up MtxLibDir and error handler
```
Then you just need to call `init_meataxe()` in the module(s) where you want to use MeatAxe.

Doesn't work. At least not when I do the following:

In sage/libs/meataxe.pxd

```python
cdef inline meataxe_init():
    ## Define an environment variable that enables MeatAxe to find
    ## its multiplication tables.
    from sage.env import DOT_SAGE
    MtxLibDir = PyBytes_AsString(os.path.join(DOT_SAGE,'meataxe'))
```
In sage/matrix/matrix_gfpn_dense.pyx:

```python
print("MTX location", MtxLibDir)
meataxe_init()
print("New location", MtxLibDir)
```
Before and after calling meataxe_init() I get the same wrong location.

You need `global MtxLibDir` otherwise `MtxLibDir` will be treated as local variable.

In the same pxd file:

```
    cdef extern char MtxLibDir[1024]    # Where to search/create multiplication tables
```
Is "global" needed, then?

Probably yes. You can move the error handler itself to the `.pyx` file but the call `MtxSetErrorHandler` in `init_meataxe()` in the `.pxd` file. Something like:

```
cdef void ErrorHandler(...)

cdef inline meataxe_init():
    ## Define an environment variable that enables MeatAxe to find
    ## its multiplication tables.
    global MtxLibDir
    MtxLibDir = PyBytes_AsString(os.path.join(DOT_SAGE,'meataxe'))

Since this patch is getting rather big, would it be possible to separate this part? Then we could keep this ticket just to fix things, not adding new functionality.

If you feel up to it, I would actually suggest to split it up even further. For example, the pickling fixes alone deserve a separate ticket.

NOTE: I'm not saying this just out of principle. My experience is that it's a lot easier to get multiple small tickets reviewed than one big ticket.

* 6e33226 - (t/23352/fix_random_matrix_gfpn_dense) Properly fill the last few columns of random meataxe matrices (2 days ago) <Simon King>

OK, quite a lot...

How to split that into smaller chunks? I see the following four topics:

1. Bug fixes, for example:
   * 6e33226 - Properly fill the last few columns of random meataxe matrices
   * 02fa8a2 - Make pickling machine independent
   * 9e0f5d4 - Fix reading mtx-matrix from non-existent file
2. Code style/cleanliness, for example:
   * b6c8114 - Make matrix_gfpn_dense python 3 compliant
   * 04e7986 - Improve use of sig_on/off/check
   * b70bc5f - Change some str into bytes
   * 413e4a9 - Remove deprecated Cython syntax, use check_malloc
   * d943f93 - Remove rawMatrix function 
3. Proper MeatAxe initialisation, for example
   * 08e03c2 - Change ErrorHandler? into sage_meataxe_error_handler
   * 353a8b9 - meataxe_init() inline function
   * 67a85ca - Move meataxe definitions from sage.matrix to sage.libs
   * c929fcc - Remove unused MTX* environment variables
4. Additions, for example
   * e17e4df - Document and test _rowlist_()
   * e861781 - Add c(p)def functions to get/set horizontal matrix slices

Since this ticket's name is about "addition", I suggest to deal with 4. *here*.

Since #23352 is about fixing something, I suggest to deal with 1. *there*, and make it a dependency of everything else.

And then there should be two new tickets for 2. and 3. Probably I will not cherry-pick commits, but will go through the whole diff and manually move stuff to the different topics.
Does that sound reasonable to you?

Hence, pickling must not dump the whole memory block, as it is machine dependent. Instead, only the parts of memory that are actually used to store data have to be dumped.
-- There are some auxiliary functions that I would like to use in my group cohomology package (related with slicing).
+- MeatAxe executables rely on an environment variable declaring where to find multiplication tables.
+- Each module that links against the MeatAxe library, which is a dynamic C library, has to define a certain C variable, which serves the same purpose as the aforementioned environment variable.
+
+I suggest to add here a function that does the initialisation and must be called be each module using MeatAxe functions. For that purpose, a new module sage.libs.meataxe is created.

You can remove

    object PyString_FromStringAndSize(char *s, Py_ssize_t len)
    char* PyString_AsString(object string)
```
and

I would also remove

If I understand correctly, it currently has to stay as it is and needs to be addressed as soon as Sage really moves on.

So, for now, I will change the code only according to your other objections.

I see. I didn't realize that wasn't already the case.  Is there any reason these have to be written in Cython? I don't see functions like these getting much speedup from it.  In any case , maybe I can just copy these directly into Sage and sprinkle them around the appropriate places.

You do get the speedup from *calling* those functions (calling a `cdef` function vs. calling a Python function).

And for `cypari2`, Cython was an obvious choice since `cypari2` is completely implemented in Cython.
