Modules using the optional MeatAxe package need the following initialisation:

- MeatAxe executables rely on an environment variable declaring where to find multiplication tables. Of course, this needs to be done only once.
- Each module that links against the MeatAxe library, which is a static library, has to define a certain C variable, which serves the same purpose as the aforementioned environment variable.

I suggest to add here a function that does the initialisation and must be called be each module using MeatAxe functions. For that purpose, a new module `sage.libs.meataxe` is created.

Depends on #23411
Depends on #23352

Keywords: **MeatAxe, matrix backend**

Question: By "dubious use of sig_on", do you mean stuff like the following?

```
                sig_on()
                if nc%MPB:
                    for i in range(nr):
                        y = <unsigned char*>x
                        for j in range(FfCurrentRowSizeIo-1):
                            y[j] = randint()%O
                        y[FfCurrentRowSizeIo-1] = randint()%(fl**(nc%MPB))
                        FfStepPtr(&(x))
                else:
                    for i in range(nr):
                        y = <unsigned char*>x
                        for j in range(FfCurrentRowSizeIo):
                            y[j] = randint()%O
                        FfStepPtr(&(x))
                sig_off()
```
Somewhere I was reading that sig_on/sig_off should be used if there are potentially long c commands, whereas in the code above (only very short commands are executed in tight loops) one should use sig_check.

Did I describe the intended use of sig_* correctly?

Working on #18514, I found that the situation is confusing for me.

My plan was:

- With the current code from here and #23352, `sage.matrix.matrix_gfpn_dense` overrides the MtxLibDir variable that is declared in `sage.libs.meataxe`, but it doesn't touch the environment variables.
- The cohomology code cimports MtxLibDir from `sage.matrix.matrix_gfpn_dense` and reads its content. It is then also written into an environment variable, so that the MTX-executables can find the multiplication tables.

The reality is:

- When the cohomology code cimports MtxLibDir, its content is a certain location in `/usr/local/`, which is where the multiplication tables can NOT be found. Thus, any computation crashes.

If I recall correctly, the reason for the bad behaviour is the fact that the meataxe library is a dynamic, not a static, library. Hence, any Cython module and any C program using meataxe has to define MtxLibDir explicitly: Cimporting it won't suffice.

The following would work:

- Define MtxLibDir in sage.matrix.matrix_gfpn_dense.
- Use a copy, say, `_MtxLibDr`
- As it turns out, when cimporting `_MtxLibDir`, one gets the correct value. Hence, one uses `_MtxLibDir` to override MtxLibDir in any module that uses the meataxe library.

Do you agree to add `_MtxLibDir` in this ticket, although I will only need it in #18514?

Concerning `MtxLibDir`: I think that part of the problem comes from insufficient separation between (1) the MeatAxe library and (2) the implementation of matrices using MeatAxe.

Things like dealing with the `MtxLibDir` and also the error handler really have nothing to do with matrices and should be moved to `src/sage/libs/meataxe.pyx`.

OK, but it means that I need to add a new module (currently, there is only the pxd file `src/sage/libs/meataxe.pxd`), and it also means that I need to import, right? "cimport" wouldn't suffice?

I think I have removed all such cases. `sig_on()` now only appears three times in the code, namely

```python
        sig_on()
        OUT.Data = MatDup(self.Data)
        MatMul(OUT.Data,right.Data)
        sig_off()
```

```python
        sig_on()
        MatMulStrassen(OUT.Data, self.Data, right.Data)
        sig_off()
```

```python
        sig_on()
        try:
            OUT.Data = MatInverse(self.Data)
        except ZeroDivisionError:
            sig_off()
            raise
        sig_off()
```
It doesn't involve python code, right?

The error handler involves Python code. So to be extra-safe, it would be better to surround the call to `PyErr_SetObject` with `sig_block()`/`sig_unblock()`.

Example, with the latest commit:

```
sage: M = random_matrix(GF(81,'x'),1000)
MTX location /usr/local/mtx/lib
os.c(254):p081.zzz: No such file or directory
```
which is an unhandled crash. So, both MtxLibDir is not visible for `sage.matrix.matrix_gfpn_dense` (otherwise meataxe would find the multiplication table) and the error handler is not defined (otherwise it would raise an error rather than crash).

How can this be overcome?

By this, I mean: We have modules A,B,C, and A is supposed to do some initialisation to a dynamic library that A, B and C link against. Is it possible to make it so that "import A" in B and C automatically executes code that will do the initialisation in B resp. in C rather than only in A?

Here, we have A=sage.libs.meataxe, B=sage.matrix.matrix_gfpn_dense and C=the cohomology code from #18514

A potential solution would be to write `sage.libs.meataxe.pxi`, and then include the .pxi file rather than cimport.

However, that sounds like an ugly hack.

You're swapping "static" and "dynamic" but otherwise you are right: the problem with static libraries is that each Cython module gets its own "copy" of the static library.

Here is a better idea: in `meataxe.pxd`, define an inline function

```
cdef inline init_meataxe():
    # set up MtxLibDir and error handler
```
Then you just need to call `init_meataxe()` in the module(s) where you want to use MeatAxe.

Doesn't work. At least not when I do the following:

In sage/libs/meataxe.pxd

```python
cdef inline meataxe_init():
    ## Define an environment variable that enables MeatAxe to find
    ## its multiplication tables.
    from sage.env import DOT_SAGE
    MtxLibDir = PyBytes_AsString(os.path.join(DOT_SAGE,'meataxe'))
```
In sage/matrix/matrix_gfpn_dense.pyx:

```python
print("MTX location", MtxLibDir)
meataxe_init()
print("New location", MtxLibDir)
```
Before and after calling meataxe_init() I get the same wrong location.

Don't! This **MUST** be inline and it **MUST** be in the `.pxd` file.

Probably yes. You can move the error handler itself to the `.pyx` file but the call `MtxSetErrorHandler` in `init_meataxe()` in the `.pxd` file. Something like:

```
cdef void ErrorHandler(...)

cdef inline meataxe_init():
    ## Define an environment variable that enables MeatAxe to find
    ## its multiplication tables.
    global MtxLibDir
    MtxLibDir = PyBytes_AsString(os.path.join(DOT_SAGE,'meataxe'))
    ## Error handling for MeatAxe, to prevent immediate exit of the program
    MtxSetErrorHandler(ErrorHandler)
```

For Python 3 compatibility, it would be good to add

```
from __future__ import absolute_import, division
```
in `src/sage/matrix/matrix_gfpn_dense.pyx`

Then you should also use floor division if that's what you want, for example here:

```
cdef size_t pickled_rowsize = len(Data)/nr
```
There might be other such places too, I have not checked.

Since this patch is getting rather big, would it be possible to separate this part? Then we could keep this ticket just to fix things, not adding new functionality.

If you feel up to it, I would actually suggest to split it up even further. For example, the pickling fixes alone deserve a separate ticket.

NOTE: I'm not saying this just out of principle. My experience is that it's a lot easier to get multiple small tickets reviewed than one big ticket.

If I see that correctly, the following git commits belong to this ticket:

* b6c8114 - (HEAD -> t/21437/fix-mtx-matrices) Make matrix_gfpn_dense python 3 compliant; fix a deprecation (20 seconds ago) <Simon King>
* 08e03c2 - Change ErrorHandler into sage_meataxe_error_handler (48 minutes ago) <Simon King>
* 353a8b9 - meataxe_init() inline function (49 minutes ago) <Simon King>
* 67a85ca - Move meataxe definitions from sage.matrix to sage.libs (4 hours ago) <Simon King>
* 6a65600 - Use a fixed copy of MtxLibDir (2 days ago) <Simon King>
* 04e7986 - Improve use of sig_on/off/check (2 days ago) <Simon King>
* b70bc5f - Change some str into bytes (2 days ago) <Simon King>
* c929fcc - Remove unused MTX* environment variables (2 days ago) <Simon King>
* d943f93 - Remove rawMatrix function (2 days ago) <Simon King>

* 4f3d56c - Fix index check in get_slice (10 months ago) <Simon King>
* e861781 - Add c(p)def functions to get/set horizontal matrix slices (10 months ago) <Simon King>
* 02fa8a2 - Make pickling machine independent (10 months ago) <Simon King>
* 778df7d - Help using MeatAxe executables in Sage (10 months ago) <Simon King>
* 9e0f5d4 - Fix reading mtx-matrix from non-existent file (10 months ago) <Simon King>

On top of that, #23352 adds one more commit:
* 6e33226 - (t/23352/fix_random_matrix_gfpn_dense) Properly fill the last few columns of random meataxe matrices (2 days ago) <Simon King>

OK, quite a lot...

How to split that into smaller chunks? I see the following four topics:

1. Bug fixes, for example:
   * 6e33226 - Properly fill the last few columns of random meataxe matrices
   * 02fa8a2 - Make pickling machine independent
   * 9e0f5d4 - Fix reading mtx-matrix from non-existent file
2. Code style/cleanliness, for example:
   * b6c8114 - Make matrix_gfpn_dense python 3 compliant
   * 04e7986 - Improve use of sig_on/off/check
   * b70bc5f - Change some str into bytes
   * 413e4a9 - Remove deprecated Cython syntax, use check_malloc
   * d943f93 - Remove rawMatrix function 
3. Proper MeatAxe initialisation, for example
   * 08e03c2 - Change ErrorHandler? into sage_meataxe_error_handler
   * 353a8b9 - meataxe_init() inline function
   * 67a85ca - Move meataxe definitions from sage.matrix to sage.libs
   * c929fcc - Remove unused MTX* environment variables
4. Additions, for example
   * e17e4df - Document and test _rowlist_()
   * e861781 - Add c(p)def functions to get/set horizontal matrix slices

Since this ticket's name is about "addition", I suggest to deal with 4. *here*.

Since #23352 is about fixing something, I suggest to deal with 1. *there*, and make it a dependency of everything else.

And then there should be two new tickets for 2. and 3. Probably I will not cherry-pick commits, but will go through the whole diff and manually move stuff to the different topics.
Does that sound reasonable to you?

+- MeatAxe executables rely on an environment variable declaring where to find multiplication tables. Of course, this needs to be done only once.
 - Each module that links against the MeatAxe library, which is a dynamic C library, has to define a certain C variable, which serves the same purpose as the aforementioned environment variable.
 
 I suggest to add here a function that does the initialisation and must be called be each module using MeatAxe functions. For that purpose, a new module sage.libs.meataxe is created.

This is not going to work on Python 3:

```
(the reason is that `os.path.join(DOT_SAGE, 'meataxe')` is `unicode`, not `bytes`.

I'm not sure if this should hold back this ticket, there are probably many issues like this in Sage.

```

I would also remove

```
from libc.stdlib cimport free
```
and replace `free()` by `sig_free()` in `free(old)`.

Let me think about this for a sec.  While it's true there are many issues like this in Sage, if we're aware of one now it would be better to address it now rather than make people working on the Python 3 port (i.e. Frédéric) pull their hair out later.

For one, why is it unicode (on Python 2) in the first place?

It's really `str` which is `bytes` on Python 2 but `unicode` (a.k.a. `str`) on Python 3.

If I understand correctly, it currently has to stay as it is and needs to be addressed as soon as Sage really moves on.

So, for now, I will change the code only according to your other objections.

You do get the speedup from *calling* those functions (calling a `cdef` function vs. calling a Python function).

And for `cypari2`, Cython was an obvious choice since `cypari2` is completely implemented in Cython.
