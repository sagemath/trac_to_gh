As reported on [sage-devel](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-devel/znjYsqv8BKw/discussion), using 7.4.beta6, I get

```
sage: (1/(1006987929*pi - 3163545880)).n()
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
ValueError: power::eval(): division by zero
```

But providing digits works:

```
sage: (1/(1006987929*pi - 3163545880)).n(digits=50)
3.2389954278022058869923921595406901102762355827180e6
```

Maybe also related:

```

sage: b = 1/3/(333362599*pi - 1047289492)

This is just one of these border cases. The only thing you can do atm is raising precision, which just sets the bar higher.

The only real solution would be to recognize that pi is irrational and raise the precision automatically. Drawback is that it could become slow.

Correct me but there is no way to get more precision out of operations with numbers of smaller precision, so the precision value is needed from the start.

Yes, and I think the division by zero `ValueError` should be caught and rethrown with an additional hint to raise the precision.

Replying to [@rwst](#comment%3A10):
> Correct me but there is no way to get more precision out of operations with numbers of smaller precision, so the precision value is needed from the start.

The only thing that I would correct in the last sentence is : "so  *some high enough* precision is needed from the start".

Maybe this is not what we want for `numerical_approx` function because it involves more computations (involving real interval arithmetics?) to compute what high enough precision is needed for the computations to get the output with the desired precision. But to me this is what I expected `numerical_approx` to do after reading its documentation:

```python
sage: def high_enough_precision(X, desired_prec):
....:     prec = desired_prec
....:     while -log(RealIntervalField(prec)(X).diameter(),2) < desired_prec:
....:         prec +=1
....:     return prec
....:
sage: high_enough_precision(pi, 53)
54
sage: high_enough_precision(pi-3.14, 53)
65
sage: B = (1/(1006987929*pi - 3163545880))
sage: high_enough_precision(B, 53)
108
```

Then, using 108 bits of precision in the internal computations really gives 53 bits of precision for the output:

```python
sage: RealIntervalField(108)(B)
3.238995427802206?e6
sage: B.n(digits=50)
3.2389954278022058869923921595406901102762355827180e6
```
 
 
> Yes, and I think the division by zero `ValueError` should be caught and rethrown with an additional hint to raise the precision.

Yes, it might be an intermediate solution. Because sometimes there is no `ValueError`, but the precision should still be raised like in the case of `pi-3.14`.
