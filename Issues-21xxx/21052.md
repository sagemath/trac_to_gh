Javier, there are still a number of tuples for argument ranges that have white space in them. Please close up all argument tuples, for example `(x, -r, r)` should be `(x,-r, r)`.

There are four back slashes `\` for line continuation that appear inside enclosing parentheses that can be removed. Please do so.

The remaining six back slashes appear with a plus sign before them: `+\`. This would read better if the plus signs appeared on the next line with their added terms. Please also leave a space before the back slashes so that they stand out better.

Doctests pass. Documentation builds and looks good except for the plot after the line "One can color the surface according to a coloring function and a colormap": something is distinctly wrong with the colormap in the Sphinx rendering. Any idea why that is?

There are still quite a few long lines in this file that could be broken. There are also a number of functional expressions that would benefit from more white space around plus and minus signs. In sinus, `+z` should be `+ z`, in one of the cubes `-1` should be `- 1`, in Chutmov `-0.3` should be `- 0.3`, in further Chutmov `-3` should be `- 3`.

See if you can make some more of the functions more readable by separating larger terms.

The two back slashes `\` in nested spheres can go as well. Thanks!

Done with the Clebsh surface, I also rewrote the Dupin Cycloid.

Looking good, just a few more things. In blob cube, please change `+sin(4*x)` to `+ sin(4*x)` twice.

Thanks for adding the reference for the Dupin cyclide and nice cleanup of the code! In the version that appears in the documentation, please change the exponentiation operator from `**` to `^`. Please also change `cyloid` to `cylide`.

Looks like the spelling of the Russian fellow's name is wrong: `Chutmov` should be `Chmutov` both times. My bad on this one!

The correction you made to the color map renders nicely. After these minor changes we're good to go.
