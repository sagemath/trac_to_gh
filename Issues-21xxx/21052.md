<a id='comment:4'></a>Javier, there are still a number of tuples for argument ranges that have white space in them. Please close up all argument tuples, for example `(x, -r, r)` should be `(x,-r, r)`.

There are four back slashes `\` for line continuation that appear inside enclosing parentheses that can be removed. Please do so.

The remaining six back slashes appear with a plus sign before them: `+\`. This would read better if the plus signs appeared on the next line with their added terms. Please also leave a space before the back slashes so that they stand out better.

See if you can make some more of the functions more readable by separating larger terms.

The two back slashes `\` in nested spheres can go as well. Thanks!

Done with the Clebsh surface, I also rewrote the Dupin Cycloid.
