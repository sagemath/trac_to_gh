This module uses structural results from "Cluster algebras IV" to implement cluster algebras as a subobject of `LaurentPolynomialRing_generic`.

It provides a new class `ClusterAlgebra`, and two new auxiliary classes `ClusterAlgebraSeed` and `ClusterAlgebraElement`.

I just fixed that; thank you for catching it. Is there any automatic way to check that the code adhere to all the conventions?
I only know of autopep8 but this does not test docstrings. 
(By the way we have plenty of long lines so we do not really adhere to pep8
either.)


On a different topic: there has been a discussion on sage-devel on the best way
to implement the exploring iterator. The discussion migrated to #21312 where the
possibility to use `RecursivelyEnumeratedSet` has been explored. It turns out that
this can be done gaining a significant slowdown. I ended up writing the
current solution. A migration to `RecursivelyEnumeratedSet` might be considered
for a follow-up ticket. I am just writing this here for the record.

<a id='comment:26'></a>More comments:

* probably .rk should be .rank (we prefer explicit names)

* `+ (a1, a2) = d_vector` could be `+ a1, a2 = d_vector` (and same thing in other places)

* remains at least one "usethe" and "itareator"

* in 
`+        g_mon = prod([self.ambient().gen(i)**g_vector[i] for i in xrange(self.rk())])`
you do not need the square bracket inside the prod.

* typo "g_vetor"

I am okay with having the module-level documentation being somewhat technical. However, I strongly think the main bulk of the documentation should be at the class-level for `ClusterAlgebra` (with the `__init__` only being a short 1-line and `TESTS::` with a (few) `TestSuite(C).run()` calls). This way the user can get it by `ClusterAlgebra?`.

<a id='comment:33'></a>Thanks everybody for the in depth comments and sorry for taking so long to
reply. 

I just updated the code implementing most of your suggestions. Here are some
extra remarks:

* xrange has been removed

* several indentations has been fixed in the documentation

* implementing index_set is probably a good idea but I might prefer to get first
  a positive review on this. I already know how this should be implemented and
  it will not take much.
 
* as far as the manipulation of `__doc__` I am posting a request for comments on
  sage-devel to see what is the general consensus on how to best implement this.

* same holds for methods not always defined

* brackets inside `prod()` and `dict()` has been removed

* `F_polynomials` is now implemented as an iterator

* I am not implementing c-vectors at this stage because, as the code is
  structured right now, we do not keep track of them. A future patch will
  address the issue of storing and producing exchange relations; c-vectors
  belong to that

* `d_vectors`: I did not implement it yet but it is easily doable. This raises a
  question concerning `cluster_variables` and `F_polynomials`.
  These, as `d_vectors` would be, are simple syntactic sugar around a `map`. For
  example `cluster_variables` is the same as
  {{{
  sage: map(A.cluster_variable, A.g_vectors())
  }}}
  is it worth implementing such methods or should we just get rid of them?
  Pros: less code to maintain!
  Cons: users might be scared?

Now to the more serious issue: I tried implementing Travis's suggestion about
documentation and I ran into some issues with `TestSuite` that I can't wrap my
head around. It looks like instances of neither `ClusterAlgebraElement` nor
`ClusterAlgebraSees` can't be dumped with `dumps`. 

```
sage: A = ClusterAlgebra(['B',4])
sage: x = A.initial_cluster_variable(0)
sage: S = A.current_seed()
sage: from six.moves import cPickle
sage: cPickle.dumps(x, protocol=2)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
PicklingError                             Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-7-78bafcb24ef1> in <module>()
----> 1 cPickle.dumps(x, protocol=Integer(2))

PicklingError: Can't pickle <type 'function'>: attribute lookup __builtin__.function failed
sage: cPickle.dumps(S, protocol=2)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
PicklingError                             Traceback (most recent call last)

----> 1 cPickle.dumps(S, protocol=Integer(2))

PicklingError: Can't pickle <type 'function'>: attribute lookup __builtin__.function failed
```

Where am I being stupid?

Are you saying that instead of using `MethodType` in the cases when I want them
I should define a subclass containing also the extra methods and dynamically
pick the right one in __init__? 
I am not sure this will work in both cases: I can see how it will help for the
extra methods in `ClusterAlgebraElement` but how do you make it work for the
extra methods in `ClusterAlgebra`?
The only way I see is to introduce a factory but I would really prefer to
avoid doing that.

This approach is not very readable (subsequently harder to debug) and strongly breaks encapsulation. So I am strongly against it.

I prefer to look at the usage from, well, the user's perspective. And using

```
sage: map(A.cluster_variable, A.g_vectors())
```
implies that I have understood already how the implementation works (or, at least, that I have read through the documentation). I'd therefore prefer to have explicit methods providing all sorts of data attached to a cluster seed (independent from how you handle the seed internally).

Just my 2 cents, it's your code so it's your decision what to provide how...

I will give it a try with `UniqueRepresentation` and report back when I am done. 
I am unfortunately quite short on time for sage lately so this may take a while.

As for subclasses I am quite against the idea because I will, hopefully soon,
add more methods defined only in certain cases and I would have to make a lot of
classes just to mix and match all the possibilities. I posted a reply on
sage-devel on this and I might just define the methods in any case and have them
raise and error when they are meaningless. Unless of course someone suggests
a better idea.

I don't understand why we need the `ClusterAlgebraSeed` when it seems like all of that functionality is (essentially) done by `ClusterSeed`.

<a id='comment:64'></a>Hi Emily,

I think the fix you made for the references was not the correct one: if I am not mistaken the goal is to go towards a unified reference system. 

I created a new ticket to fix the duplication in `ClusterSeed` #22160 (which needs a quick review) and I will shortly update a new version of this branch to reflect the changes. 
Once this is done this ticket will depend on #22160.
