Looking through the plotting and LaTeX generating code of different objects there seem to be some unstated conventions
and some inconsistencies between how show, plot and `_latex_` behave.
I could not find a place in the documentation, stating the conventions for these methods. 

For example here is what I think I understood:
- Everything that can be reasonably plotted to GraphicsObjects should have  plot method that produces this plot.

- Most stuff doesn't have a show method, but for example graphs do.

- The funtion 

  ```python
  show(G)
  ```
  is an alias for

  ```python
  pretty_print(G)
  ```
  which tries to find out what is the "best" representation for an    object.

- G._latex_ should produce a latex representation but there seems
  to be no concensus if this should be more like a plot of the
  object
  or the name of the object with fancy symbols that can be picked up  by MathJax

- Some objects like Polytopes solve this ambiguity by providing a tikz method

Then there are inconsistencies between how for example edge colorings are specified. In graph.plot the format is {color:edges},
in graph.set_latex_options it is either {edge:color} for tikzpictures or {color:edges} for dot2tex pictures.

Before fixing these inconsistencies, I think one needs a more or less precise definition of the semantics of these functions at a central place.
