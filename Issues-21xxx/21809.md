```
The Sage deprecation warnings in `src/sage/libs/cypari2/...` should be either removed or replaced by pure Python warnings.

We use the new `Obsolete` keyword in `pari.desc` to automatically generate deprecation warnings.

For simplicity, some deprecated code from #20216, #20217, #20219, #20205 is simply removed (even if the 12-month deprecation period ends only 15 May 2017).

Depends on #21756
