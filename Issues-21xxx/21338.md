<a id='comment:2'></a>Good idea.

- I think that this needs seealso-crosslinks with `sublattices_lattice()`.
- Should return type be lattice when `self` is of type lattice? Compare for example to `dual()`.
- We really should have a guideline whether to use `self` or "the thing" at docstrings. This now conflicts with other functions at `posets.py`.

<a id='comment:8'></a>This is natural in the following sense:

a poset is a category, a morphism of posets is a functor, a morphism between morphisms of posets is a natural transformation.

So if posets are understood in the proper language, there is no real choice for
a natural definition of a partial order on the morphisms from 2 to P.

Should I remove the cross-links ?
