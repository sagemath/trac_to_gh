Pynac-0.7.2:
* add libfactory interface; unconditionally replace GiNaC GCD with Singular (~~Giac GCD if available~~); this fixes #10284; it means that Singular is now another Pynac dependency
* ~~reenable unconditional use of Giac if available (#21885)~~
* fix zeta expansion around 1 (behackl) (#21899)
* fix Giac GCD doctest fail
* fix NaN unpickling (uncovered in #20939)
* fix Flint underlinking (fbissey)
* fix dilog problems (#19906)
* fix Singular GCD interface
* fix is_real(positive<sup>real</sup>) (#21940)
* better error message with evalf of some orthogonal polys
* improve pkg-config usage
* add internal rising/falling factorial

Hi ralf, I think that with this pynac the giac spkg must be a dependency.

Indeed, I have tried to build sage on a system which have also a version of giac that I am not allowed to remove (and no control of how it was built). In my case it was bernard parisse's binary package installed by root. So this version of libgiac was built with all options and with libao support, but the libao headers were not installed on my system.

But now when building sage, pynac found this unexpected giac and the built was broken because of libao problems.

Then installing also the giac spkg and the built of sage is going further (although I have not finshed yet)

Thanks for the effort Fr√©d√©ric.

Giac is not a standard package so can be no dependency. Pynac needs to detect such Giac versions that cannot be linked to. As I think this is more tricky we will disable Giac again and reenable in a later version when a solution is found.

I don't know the procedure for giac to become a standard package, but it may be the more natural solution. I can see that Francois Bissey is already updating giac often in sage-on-gentoo:
http://gpo.zugaina.org/sci-mathematics/giac/ChangeLog


About the broken built I can give more details:
The point is that my system have a:
/usr/lib/libgiac.la file containing this line:

```
# Libraries that this one depends upon.
dependency_libs=' -lntl -lpari -lgsl -lgslcblas -lrt -lpthread -lao -lblas -ldl -lpng -lmpfi -lmpfr -lgmp'
```
and the pynac built broke there:

```
  CXXLD    libpynac.la
/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lao
collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
Makefile:496: recipe for target 'libpynac.la' failed
```
Now I am testing the following:
I put a copy of this libgiac.la in your ginac dir but removed the -lao and -lblas tags.
Then I can build pynac without the giac spkg on this system and I have:

```
zeta(han)$ ldd local/lib/libpynac.so.9
	linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007ffe10db9000)

It seems that a broken libtool is the cause: https://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/devel/2010-November/146343.html
Maybe the `ld` flag `-no-add-needed` when compiling giac has an effect but that wouldn't affect existing `.la` files.

The other alternative, removing or changing the `.la` file before linking would be an idea but that looks unusual or hackish.

I think that no problems were reported with the giac spkg installed before pynac built, even if there is a system wide (broken or not) libgiac.
I guess that in all reported cases the libgiac in /usr/lib was from B. Parisse's binary package:
http://www-fourier.ujf-grenoble.fr/~parisse/debian/
(but it may happen often, for example when people also want xcas; I think it is also on sagemath cloud)

indeed it is an all in one package with libgiac.so linked to libao.so.4. But I think we could have more problems than just the libao-dev not installed. For instance it is built with some gcc<5 and I have problems with strings if I use gcc5 without a CXXFLAGS with -D_GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI=0 with parisse's package and the giac spkg not installed.

So you should also test in your configure a small program with a giac::gen initialized with a string.
Ex:

```
AC_LANG_PROGRAM([#include <giac/giac.h>], 
    [giac::context ct;
     giac::gen g(std::string("0"),&ct);])

```

NB: Sorry my ldd in comment 13 was not correct, unfortunately if I built pynac without the giac spkg but with parisse's giac .deb (with a modified libgiac.la in ginac/ and with gcc4.9) then pynac is linked to this /usr/lib/libgiac...

If I remember some discussion someone also wanted pynac to not be linked to an external library so that you can make binary distributions of sage so I think that you should enable giac only with the spkg or in distrib like fedora where you have  a offical package.

That looks a good idea to me.

I am the one who actually said it should happen that way at the sage binary package level.

The bot will take care of testing debian/ubuntu I guess. But yes one of the next step will be more robust detection of a working `giac` which may be a standard package in 7.5....

In my opinion there are two more things to do before switching `giac` on properly. 1) more robust detection so we definitely don't get non-working version.
