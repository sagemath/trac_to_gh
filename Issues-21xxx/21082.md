This is a follow-up on:
- #20884 closed defect (fixed): line buffering in sage-logger causes "hang" due to invisible prompt when installing experimental packages
- #21539 positive_review enhancement: make V=0 should silence the build --- which solved the 'buffered prompting problem' by using `/dev/tty`

This ticket adds options `-y` ("yes"), `-n` ("no") that get rid of user prompting for non-interactive installs of experimental/old-style packages.

Also if there is no controlling terminal, then `-n` is implied for experimental packages and `-y` is implied for old-style optional packages. (On Linux, this situation can be tested [by using `setsid`](http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/68574/invoke-a-command-script-disconnected-from-the-controlling-terminal) (for Mac OS X: see [here](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/kohsuke/9025027fc0c8be289d40/raw/406ea3b3f5f0cd8899dddc8ff9f66254ab002ccf/setsid.py)) or by using ssh without the `-t` option.)

The ticket changes the exit status from 0 to 1 if the user declines to install the package. Previously, the system would record a successful installation in `$SAGE_LOCAL/var/lib/sage/installed/`. 

Moreover, for experimental packages, `sage -info` no longer warns/prompts.
Instead, the package type is simply printed. None of our packages is so dangerous that merely viewing the SPKG.txt will cause harm.
