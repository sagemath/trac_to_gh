------------------------------------------------------------
The following tests failed: _test_pickling, _test_solve
```

The `_test_pickling` failure happens also on 64-bit systems (pickling is not supported by the MIP backends), but the `_test_solve` failure only on 32-bit.

Pickling is not supported by the MIP backends. 
Is there a better way of declaring this than just disabling the `_test_pickling` test?

I think that's the best way because it's very explicit.
