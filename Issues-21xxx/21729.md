In a recent preprint [https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.08272](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.08272) titled *Structural characterization of Cayley graphs*, Didier Caucal has proved that a directed graph is Cayley if and only if it is strongly connected, simple, deterministic, and vertex transitive.

The present method for determining if a graph is Cayley in Sage involves looking for a free transitive subgroup of the automorphism group, which appears to be slower for directed graphs. Moreover, it uses optional gap packages, which are not needed here. This method works only for directed graphs, and is sensitive to edge labels.

It runs a little faster than the existing code, even though my implementation is probably far from optimized.

```
sage: G = groups.permutation.Mathieu(9)
sage: S = Set(G).subsets().random_element()
sage: gr = G.cayley_graph(generators=list(S))
sage: %timeit gr.is_cayley()
100 loops, best of 3: 14.5 ms per loop
sage: %timeit gr.is_cayley_directed()
100 loops, best of 3: 6.92 ms per loop

At least `seen_ends` is now unused.

This can be done in two lines,

```
seen = set()
not any(e[2] in seen or seen.add(e[2]) for v in self for e in self.outgoing_edge_iterator(v))
```

but your version might be easier to read.

I still hope that someone who has read the paper can review this.

I don't think it's correct to say that this is a faster algorithm to determine if the graph is Cayley. This is an algorithm to do this for a special class of edge-labelled (di)graphs. It's not clear at all that this method can be efficiently extended to the unlabelled case (and indeed nothing of this is claimed in the paper).

In the docstring 

```
+        A directed graph with labeled edges is Cayley if and only if it is
+        strongly connected, vertex transitive, simple and deterministic.
```
the main result of the paper is misstated; certainly not every labelling of edges can be considered. Certainly for each vertex each outedge on it must have a different label. And a directed labelled Cayley graph has more restrictions of labels---there must be exactly k different labels, for k the out-degree of the (di)graph.

In this setting, a Cayley graph *is* a directed graph with edges labeled by generators. Dima rightly points out that if the edge labeling is changed, then the algorithm will not recognize the graph as Cayley. I pointed this out in the documentation:

```
+        This method is sensitive to edge labels::
+
+            sage: g = DiGraph([(1, 2, 1), (2, 3, 1), (3, 1, 1), (2, 1, 1), (3, 2, 1), (1, 3, 1)])

+            True
+            sage: g.is_cayley_directed()
+            False
```
Do you think I should make it more prominent? And of course, it is for this reason that the algorithm runs so fast - it uses the additional information (edge labels) which the earlier (Sabidussi) algorithm does not take into account.

The problem this ticket solve is the following: 

given a digraph D with edge labels 1,2,...,k, decide if there exists a group G generated by g_1,...,g_k so that D is the Cayley graph of G w.r.t. the generators g_1,...,g_k, right?

This is much more restrictive and much easier than recognising whether a digraph is a Cayley graph w.r.t. some group G with some set of generators.

In fact, it is straightforward to read the group off a Cayley graph with edge labels, and so I don't see why this is so interesting (it's good to have, but probably the punchline of the paper in question is somewhere else).
Indeed, if the arc (ij) is labelled by g this just means that the permutation g
maps i to j, and so you can reconstruct all the permutations, or get stuck at some point---the latter simply means that it's not a Cayley graph w.r.t. the set of generators corresponding to edge labels.

Checking transitivity of a permutation group given by generators is quite easy and can be done very efficiently. 

What is however less obvious is how to check is that you get a group acting regularly (i.e. transitively and with trivial vertex stabiliser). And this is something I did not mention in my previous comment.

For this, the quickest way I know is to write down the Schreier generators for the point stabiliser and check that they are all trivial.
This seems to be possible to do in time O(nr), with n the number of vertices and r number of group generators.

Does the paper offer anything faster?

I agree with Dima, this characterization is certainly not new, and probably not the punchline of the article advertised in the description. For example, it corresponds to the characterization of Galois covers in algebraic topology (see e.g. the book of A. Hatcher).

Dima: following these steps it is enough to check for a **single** vertex stabilizer
- Test whether the graph `G` is connected and at each vertex there are exactly an input and an output edges of each label. If not return `False`.
- Build the permutation group `P` acting on the vertices of `G` that consists in "following the labels" (one generator per label). Note that the transitivity of `P` is equivalent to the connectivity of `G`.
- Pick a vertex `v0` of `G`. If the vertex stabilizer in `P` of `v0` is trivial then return `True` otherwise return `False`.

The reason that it works is that vertex stabilizers are conjugate (since the group `P` acts transitively on the vertices).

As pointed out by Dima, testing whether an **unlabelled graph** is Cayley is much more interesting. It is certainly doable starting from the automorphism group of the graph and analyzing the vertex stabilizer of a point.
