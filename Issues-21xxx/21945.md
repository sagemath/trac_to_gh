The Python builtins `max` and `min` are not user-friendly because they give totally wrong results on symbolic input:

```
sage: max(1/(1-x), 1/x)
-1/(x - 1)
```

There exist functions `max_symbolic` and `min_symbolic` but people generally don't know those functions. They expect `max` and `min` to "just work".

One way this puzzles users is when plotting eg the following:

```
sage: plot(max(1/(1-x), 1/x), (x, 0, 1), ymin=0, ymax=10))
```

... for which a workaround is to plot using a lambda function:

```
sage: plot(lambda x: max(1/(1-x), 1/x), (0, 1), ymin=0, ymax=10)
```

Depends on #24838

Thanks for the info. The names are not intuitive, but perhaps we can live with it. Here's a short list of what these creatures should be able to do:

* Assume `x` and `y` are positive. Then `min_symbolic(x, y)` and `max_symbolic(x, y)` should return True.
* Similarly, for `x` and `y` which are both negative, nonnegative and nonpositive.
* Similarly, if `x` is assumed to be negative and `y` is assumed to be positive, then `min` and `max` should behave respectively.
* `min` and `max` of real symbols should be real.  Similarly for algebraic, rational, integer...
* Should `min_symbolic(x, x)` simplify to `x`?

It currently does. Regarding your other points, unfortunately, it seems those are not available. See also #17700 and #19162.
A "non-trivial" thing that does work is that

```
var("x,y,z")
assume(x>z)
assume(z>y)
print max_symbolic(x,y,z).simplify()
print min_symbolic(x,y,z).simplify()
```
prints `x` and `y`.
