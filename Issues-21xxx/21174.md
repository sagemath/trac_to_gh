```
When configuring MPIR with `--enable-gmpcompat` (which we do in Sage by default), (almost) the same files get installed under two different names:

* `mpir.h` and `gmp.h` -- identical copies (no links)
* `mpirxx.h` and `gmpxx.h` -- identical copies (no links)
* `libmpir.a` and `libgmp.a` -- identical copies (no links)
* `libmpirxx.a` and `libgmpxx.a` -- identical copies (no links)

More critical, as of MPIR 2.7.2, on ELF systems:

* `libmpir.so`[`.16`[`.6.2`]] and `libgmp.so`[`.16`[`.6.2`]] -- only the `soname` differs
* `libmpirxx.so`[`.8`[`.4.2`]] and `libgmpxx.so`[`.8`[`.4.2`]] -- only the `soname` differs

 (Similar on Darwin and Cygwin.)

This can lead to weird and hard-to-debug errors if programs or libraries accidentally link to **both** libmpir and libgmp (which may also happen if a program or library links to libraries A and B where A just uses libmpir and B only libgmp); see for example [this thread on sage-devel](http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.mathematics.sage.devel/87968).

For the first four instances, we could simply install symbolic links (on systems that support that) from `*mpir*` to their respective `*gmp*` counterparts (maybe also hard links, but symlinks seem more appropriate).

For the shared libraries, on ELF systems (and presumably analogously on Darwin) it would be sufficient to install just the GMP-named libraries and symbolic links from `libmpir`[`xx`]`.so` to `libgmp`[`xx`]`.so`, respectively.

Then the linker could (still) pick up `-lmpir` (aka `libmpir.so`, in a shared link) and would record `libgmp.so.16` as the soname in the `DT_NEEDED` tag; analogous for `-lmpirxx`.

I don't have a strong opinion on whether to install links or not; without them, we hopefully won't run into the mess you had again, but I'm open for different solutions on Cygwin anyway (I cannot test myself).  IIRC on Cygwin it's harder to separate "Sage libraries" from the system's, and it's probably not uncommon for Cygwin users to have *both* MPIR and GMP installed "system-wide".

No idea, I thought I had read something like that a while ago.

So you're in favour of not installing links (which AFAIK wouldn't be possible on Cygwin anyway)?
