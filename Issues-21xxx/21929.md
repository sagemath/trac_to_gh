The original implementation of `view`, produces a pdf in a4 format,
regardless of the typeset object. #6591 introduced the `tightpage`
option which produces a document whose size matches the typeset
object.

Since then, the `tightpage=True` option has grown popular; in fact
most of the time, this is the desirable choice. Therefore this ticket
makes `tightpage=True` the default.

Note: in some cases, the current implementation of tightpage crops the
border of the picture. This will be fixed in a separate ticket to make
tightpage even more appealing.
