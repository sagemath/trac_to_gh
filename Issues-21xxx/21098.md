This patch was originally #16152, but was mistakenly removed in #20927.  This patch is still needed to build PPL in Cygwin (the patch just needed to updated slightly for PPL 1.2).

A better patch would be to modify the autoconf files to not set `PPL_CXX_SUPPORTS_ATTRIBUTE_WEAK` in the first place on Cygwin64--as it is using `__attribute__((weak))` will compile fine, but fails to work properly at link time.  Not sure whether it's worth it though.

Reported upstream at https://www.cs.unipr.it/mantis/view.php?id=1690
Although this is more deeply an issue with Cygwin, it's a pretty difficult to resolve one, while easy enough to workaround.
