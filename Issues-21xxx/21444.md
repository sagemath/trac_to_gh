This came up in [ask-sage](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/34767/replacing-mathematical-functions-of-expressions-with-different-mathematical-functions-of-the-same-expression/?answer=34769#post-id-34769):

```
sage: tanh(SR.wild(0)) #for references; this works
tanh($0)
sage: coth(SR.wild(0))
ValueError: The name "" is not a valid Python identifier.
```
The traceback shows that this error happens when trying to parse back a maxima result with bare `_SAGE_VAR_` in it (i.e., a sage variable with an empty name)

It seems #20134 is implicated.

Another problem arises when a wildcard expression gets sent to maxima:

```
sage: sin(SR.wild(0)).simplify_full()
TypeError: ECL says: THROW: The catch MACSYMA-QUIT is undefined.
```

It may be that we can resolve both errors by ensuring that wildcards roundtrip properly to maxima (e.g., convert them to `_SAGE_WILDCARD_0` rather than the syntactically illegal `_SAGE_VAR_$0` and parse them back properly too).

It may also be that by giving `coth` and friends a slightly different treatment we can get them in line with `tanh` etc.
