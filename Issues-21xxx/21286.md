As Bill Page points out on:

https://github.com/pynac/pynac/issues/187

PyNaC does provide a special hook for printing FDerivative expressions. The relevant routine py_print_fderivative lives in
src/sage/symbolic/pynac.pyx, on line 583 (or thereabouts).

It look likes an expression `D[*params](f)(*args)` would get printed using a call of the form

```
py_print_fderivative(<id of f>,params,args)
```
so we'd have enough information to decide if `args` consist of distinct simple variables, in which case we could print it as

```
diff(f(*args),[args[i] for i in params])
```
or something nicer.

After finally tracking down where the hook for this exists, the actual change only requires a few lines. With the attached POC branch:

```
sage: var('x,y'); function('f')
sage: diff(f(y,x),x, y)
diff(f(y, x), y, x)
sage: diff(f(x+y,x-y),x,y)
D[0, 0](f)(x + y, x - y) - D[1, 1](f)(x + y, x - y)
```
so we get more intuitive printing when argument positions are easily determined by variable names, and revert to unambiguous notation if not. For univariate we do have:

```
sage: diff(f(sin(x)),x)
cos(x)*diff(f(sin(x)), sin(x))
```
of course, actual printing styles can be adapted.

The changed doctests with the new output suffice absolutely.

As the output is deemed satisfactory by reviewers, the `pynac.pyx` looks good, and `make ptestlong` passes, I'll set positive now. Thanks for the work.
