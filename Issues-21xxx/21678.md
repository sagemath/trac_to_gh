We should have a testsuite that tests the correct operation and interaction of various commands that a distutils-based `setup.py` should support.

Does something like this exist in the Python world already?

Any non-trivial functionality of setup.py should be implemented in the sage_setup library which can be unit tested in the usual way.

Yes, but I am thinking of higher-level tests, for example to ensure that making an sdist and then unpacking-building-cleaning succeeds and gives a tree that is the same as in the sdist archive. This is currently not tested at all and broken (#21516).

They're specifically geared toward testing the code in astropy-helpers itself, but this tests a lot of the other expected outputs of `setup.py` in the process.
