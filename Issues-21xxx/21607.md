CC to Nicolas, as the question is more general.

Replying to [@tscrim](#comment%3A4):
> This is completely non-future-proof. A better solution would be to use `self.__class__` or something to this affect.

Nope. Only really foolproof solution is to have base class `A` to never know anything about subclasses, only give hooks for them. A would have something like

```
def _give_f_constructor(self): return A
def f():
    . . . something here, for example, creates X . . .
    constructor = self._give_f_constructor()
    return constructor(X)
```

and then B might have

```
def _give_f_constructor(self): return B
```

It is not possible for a class `A` to know if somebody will add sub-sub-classes `B -> C -> D` and so on, so that for example `D.f()` should return a type of `C`. Complement of a bipartite graph was an example of this.

But in reality we can't achieve that. So, I can make the construction with `__class__`. But if the category system gives some solution to this problem, I will hear.

> I'm still -1 on removing <code>\`\`self\`\`</code> from docstrings.

Yeah, should be resolved in a way or another. Belongs to the same class than "certificate=" vs. "certify=", "algorithm=" vs. "implementation=" etc.

OK. Hope that Frédéric or Nicolas can review this, as I don't understand the category system.

Now, for example `relabel()` contains code block starting

```
if isinstance(self, FiniteLatticePoset):
    constructor = FiniteLatticePoset
elif isinstance(self, FiniteMeetSemilattice):
    constructor = FiniteMeetSemilattice
```

Should we change that too?
