CC to Nicolas, as the question is more general.

Replying to [@tscrim](#comment%3A4):
> This is completely non-future-proof. A better solution would be to use `self.__class__` or something to this affect.

Nope. Only really foolproof solution is to have base class `A` to never know anything about subclasses, only give hooks for them. A would have something like

```
def _give_f_constructor(self): return A
def f():
    . . . something here, for example, creates X . . .
    constructor = self._give_f_constructor()
    return constructor(X)
```

and then B might have

```
def _give_f_constructor(self): return B
```

It is not possible for a class `A` to know if somebody will add sub-sub-classes `B -> C -> D` and so on, so that for example `D.f()` should return a type of `C`. Complement of a bipartite graph was an example of this.

But in reality we can't achieve that. So, I can make the construction with `__class__`. But if the category system gives some solution to this problem, I will hear.

> I'm still -1 on removing <code>\`\`self\`\`</code> from docstrings.

Yeah, should be resolved in a way or another. Belongs to the same class than "certificate=" vs. "certify=", "algorithm=" vs. "implementation=" etc.

It is a subtle problem with `UniqueRepresentation` in that the class itself is part of the key for the cache. So what we have to do is pull out the actual class instead of the one created by the category framework. The category framework guarantees that the original class is in position 1 in the MRO (otherwise, the category methods would override the concrete classes), so this is safe to do.

OK. Hope that Frédéric or Nicolas can review this, as I don't understand the category system.

Now, for example `relabel()` contains code block starting

```
if isinstance(self, FiniteLatticePoset):
    constructor = FiniteLatticePoset
elif isinstance(self, FiniteMeetSemilattice):
    constructor = FiniteMeetSemilattice
```

Should we change that too?
