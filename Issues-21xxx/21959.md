<a id='comment:10'></a>Sorry for not getting back to you sooner on this. A few quick comments:

- Indentation is 4 spaces.
- You should have the 1-line description on the line after the `"""`.
- Perhaps make the `Beware...` sentence in a `.. WARNING::` block?
- It would be good to have doctests for every function and method.
- Why are the tests in `__auto_vars` marked as `# not tested`?
