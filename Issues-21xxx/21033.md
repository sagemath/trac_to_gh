There are now several packages where `build/pkgs/PACKAGE/type` is "pip".

Is there any documentation on this?

- #19213: For packages listed in build/pkgs/piprules, allow 'sage --optional' to list them

Certainly not standard since we need to ship the sources of standard packages with Sage. They aren't really optional nor experimental either. I see it as just a shortcut to `./sage --pip install PKG`.

"Official" or not, documentation is better than no documentation, no?

Let me ask again my question which you removed from the description above:

I tried to add a package of this type for pypolymake (for #20892), but adding the file build/pkgs/pypolymake/type does not seem to enable "sage -i pypolymake". What am I missing?
