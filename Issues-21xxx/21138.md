Ralf, I'd like to go through all special functions files and standardize the behavior of the LaTeX as much as possible.

Since the single quote has meaning in LaTex as a derivative, it makes sense to me to have LaTeX strings enclosed in double quotes by default. Most LaTeX strings I've seen already do that, so it will be simple to establish as a standard.

Functions names as an argument of GinacFunction or BuiltinFunction are currently generally in double quotes while conversion dictionaries generally use single quotes. I know that it works either way, but as long as I'm looking at the code I'm going to update arguments other than LaTeX strings to use single quotes for consistency.

Let me know if this sounds reasonable and I'll start working on other files. Thanks!

The changes are fine and the usage of `operatorname` is a necessary improvement. If you had only the quote convention changes though I would have deemed it a waste of a ticket (and a git branch).
