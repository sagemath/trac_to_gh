Indeed

- http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.spatial.ConvexHull.html
- http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.spatial.Delaunay.html
- http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.spatial.Voronoi.html

But scipy does not seem to ship the binaries... But however their interface is pretty good and that's actually what we should use!

which is rather disjoint.

Right, for polymake (#20892) we do need the binaries.
Could you update the SPKG.txt to include info about scipy?
