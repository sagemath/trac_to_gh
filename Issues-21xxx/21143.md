It builds fine for me on Mac OS X.

An answer to an Ask [SageMath](SageMath) question here claims that qhull is included with scipy: http://ask.sagemath.org/question/10254/how-does-one-use-the-qhull-optional-package/

Also there is this ticket: #12352

Indeed

- http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.spatial.ConvexHull.html
- http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.spatial.Delaunay.html
- http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.spatial.Voronoi.html

But scipy does not seem to ship the binaries... But however their interface is pretty good and that's actually what we should use!

Right, for polymake (#20892) we do need the binaries.
Could you update the SPKG.txt to include info about scipy?
