The goal of this ticket is to be able to explain to experienced Unix users what sage-the-distribution is, as follows:

 If you download sage-the-distribution and do
 {{{
 ./configure --prefix=/SOMEWHERE && make 
 }}}
 then that's the same as doing a sequence of about 100 times: 
 {{{
wget SOMEPACKAGE.tar.gz && tar xf SOMEPACKAGE.tar.gz && (cd SOMEPACKAGE \
&& ./configure --prefix=/SOMEWHERE && make && make install)
 }}}
 (and about a 50 times `pip install SOMEPACKAGE`).
 sage-the-distribution has figured out the right order of installing these packages, tricky configure options so that everything works, and on top has fixes for various outdated/handwritten/missing build systems of various packages.

Thus it is beyond the scope of this ticket:
- to separate `make` and `make install`. Our `make install` is a no-op. ANY discussion of this needs to go to ticket #21495, not here.

We will implement this goal without sacrificing any of the traditional convenience features that Sage-the-distribution has provided for the casual user (such as `sage -i` for installing packages; and that `./configure` is an *optional* step of the installation process).

We have a separate task ticket for the following:
- #21507: Make sagelib (sage-the-Python-library) a normal Python package, installable by `setup.py`, `pip`, etc. and eventually even via PyPI.  We will NOT turn sagelib to an automake package (which was proposed in #14807). 
(There will be some interaction with some of the steps of that ticket.)

Included on this ticket are the following steps.

Implement standard features expected of an autotools build system.

- Choosing the installation hierarchy (`configure --prefix=SAGE_LOCAL`). Right now it is the subdirectory `local` of `SAGE_ROOT`. 
  - #21501: Allow SAGE_LOCAL to be customized
  - #21534: Allow SAGE_LOCAL to be customized - follow-up
  - #21479: ./configure --prefix=SAGE_LOCAL
- By allowing the user to choose the installation hierarchy, there are new requirements. What is installed there should run without requiring environment variables to be set. It should not refer to the environment variables `SAGE_LOCAL`, or `SAGE_ROOT` (or `SAGE_SRC_ROOT`). An exception could perhaps be made for the latter for "debugging" or "source inspection" facilities:
  - #21525: package `autotools`: Don't depend on `$SAGE_LOCAL`
  - #21509: Install cython_debug somewhere in SAGE_LOCAL
- #21539: `make V=0` should silence the build
- #21775: make distclean: Don't delete the install hierarchy (SAGE_LOCAL)
- #21591: Replace use of `SAGE_ROOT` by more specific environment variables
- #21469: Enable VPATH builds (`SAGE_SRC_ROOT/configure --srcdir=SAGE_SRC_ROOT`)
- #22646: `./configure CC=/path/to/gcc ...`
- #28095: Add --enable-OPTIONALSPKG options to configure (see also earlier #21538)
- #29113: Reimplement `sage -i SPKG` for optional/experimental packages as `configure --enable-SPKG && make build` (follow-up: #29626)
- #21589: Make `make V=0` the default by `./configure --enable-silent-rules`
- Various other `configure` options, to replace use of environment variables that influence the build.

Clean up parts of the build system to make it more standard. This is to make it straightforward for developers familiar with the autotools system to contribute to sage.
- #21532: Create `SAGE_LOCAL` directory hierarchy during `make`, not `configure`
- #21524: `configure.ac`: write `build/make/Makefile` within an `AC_CONFIG_COMMANDS`, not during main `configure`

Make the separation between sage-the-distribution and sagelib (sage-the-Python-library) clearer. This will be beneficial for distributions such as Debian etc.
- #21559: Move sage-the-distribution scripts from `src/bin` to `build/bin`
- #21565: Add src/README.txt and build/README.txt

Following are workarounds to enable root-owned installation hierarchies (`prefix`).
- #21537: If `$SAGE_SUDO` is set, use it whenever we do `make install` of a package. Subtickets:
  - #21726: Support splitting spkg install into `spkg-build` and `spkg-install` (for SAGE_SUDO)
- #21536: documentation: Recommend GNU stow to people who want to install to `/usr/local`

Do you intend `./configure` to detect already installed dependencies so that `make` skips installing them? (Eventually? as part of this task?) For example, is the idea that `./configure` would finish by saying something like “the following dependencies are missing: ... please install them, or type `make` and I'll install my own copy”? (This wouldn't be *quite* standard, but close enough, while staying mostly compatible with the installation procedure of sage-the-distribution.)

Or would sage-the-distribution still always have its private version of everything, so that users would have to choose between installing it and installing sagelib directly (e.g., via pip)?

Which build system changes specifically?  I have a few open tickets that are making some not insignificant changes, but they don't terribly change things for this ticket. If anything they will help make it easier to implement the goals of this ticket.  There is one small conflict I can see: The work I'm doing in #22509 and in #23160 will mostly supersede the work you already did in #21537.
