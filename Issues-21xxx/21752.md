This patch will change some colours to colors.

The real question is larger: shall we add "Use US english" to the developer manual? I think that we should. (I have no prefence, but US english is currently more used.)

OK, but what you think about

```
class Color(object):

         """
         Return the integer representation of this colour.

or like? Fortunately we have only one form used as keyword or function name. I suppose that you wouldn't like them to have different spelling.
