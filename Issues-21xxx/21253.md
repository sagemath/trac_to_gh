Installation worked fine on 7.4.beta5 after downloading the file `pandoc_attributes-8bc82f6d.zip` in the upstream directory. I was able to test that the optional package works as expected using [examples](https://github.com/aaren/pandoc-attributes) from the github readme page.

Thanks for working on the `sage -rst2ipynb` which I soon want to run on some of my rst files.
