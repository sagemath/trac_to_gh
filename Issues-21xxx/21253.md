This patch will add a `certificate`-option to `is_complemented()`; compare to `is_sectionally_complemented()` and `is_relatively_complemented()`.

At the same time this drops computation time. As an example after meets and joins are computed for `TamariLattice(7)` it took 140 ms to check that it is complemented; with this patch it is about 85 ms. It is also faster when filtering complemented lattices from all 10-element lattices.
