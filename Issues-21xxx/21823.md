```

after this patch:

```
sage: timeit('P.is_pseudocomplemented()')

<a id='comment:3'>**Comment 3:**</a>
proof seems ok to me

it says that the pseucomplement of x is the meet of the pseudocomplements of the atoms below x

proof is very simple, take 7 lines at start of proof of Theoreme 3.3 page 96

You just need 3 French words : évident = obvious, montrer = show, implique = implies

:)
