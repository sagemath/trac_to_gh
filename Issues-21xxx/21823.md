<a id='comment:3'></a>proof seems ok to me

it says that the pseucomplement of x is the meet of the pseudocomplements of the atoms below x

proof is very simple, take 7 lines at start of proof of Theoreme 3.3 page 96

You just need 3 French words : évident = obvious, montrer = show, implique = implies

:)

Good point. This should work, but takes time to compile... How to doc-compile only master references file?
