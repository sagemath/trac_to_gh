The coding part of Sage (see #18846) contains Roth-Ruckenstein algorithm to compute the roots of a polynomial `Q(y)` with coefficients in `F[x]` (where `F` is a finite field). The purpose of this ticket is to move the implementation to make this algorithm a method of polynomials. 

Toward this end, we also define a generic implementation for roots of univariate polynomials over univariate polynomial rings, that goes through their factorization. And this requires to implement the factorization for these "recursive" polynomial rings: Currently, the algorithm consists in flattening the recursive polynomial ring and use methods for multivariate polynomial rings.
