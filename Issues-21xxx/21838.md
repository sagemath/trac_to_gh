The following example is confusing because of the apparition of the imaginary part

```
sage: y = QQbar(cos(pi/18))
sage: y.imag() == 0
True
sage: y
0.9848077530122081? + 0.?e-36*I
```
This ticket proposes to change the representation of known exact reals to be without imaginary part, that is

```
sage: y
0.9848077530122081?
```

Looks rather good, not so many doctest failures. And they seem to be improvements

```
sage -t --long --random-seed=0 src/sage/matrix/matrix2.pyx  # 8 doctests failed
sage -t --long --random-seed=0 src/sage/dynamics/arithmetic_dynamics/projective_ds.py  # 1 doctest failed

Opinions ? Is this the way to go ?
