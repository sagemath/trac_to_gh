CC:  tdumont @tscrim

The following example is confusing because of the apparition of the imaginary part

```
sage: y = QQbar(cos(pi/18))
sage: y.imag() == 0
True
sage: y
0.9848077530122081? + 0.?e-36*I
```
This ticket proposes to change the representation of known exact reals to be without imaginary part, that is

```
sage: y
0.9848077530122081?
```

Well, one could argue that we now do in every case what we were only doing (these `.is_zero` tests) for real fields before. Moreover, the changes only touch either the "repr", which is not time critical, or the method "interval", which is used only for inexact conversion to real numbers or complex numbers.

I would therefore advocate that this is ok. Maybe benchmarks would be welcome ?

Are you saying that with these changes, converting an element of QQbar to a complex interval can trigger an exactification to test if the element is real? Then I think that's a very bad idea. Testing if an element is real can be extremely costly, while converting to intervals (without caring if the result is real or not) is something you do all the time in some types of computations.

(I'm all in favor of printing elements of QQbar that are *already known* to be real without an imaginary part if we're not already doing it. And I don't really like the idea of testing if the real part is zero in `_repr_`, though I can live with it.)

Regarding RR, I expect the conversion to fail if the imaginary part is not exactly zero.

However, conversion to CC shouldn't ever call `exactify()` IMO.
