This is misleading:
[the "installation from source" documentation](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/source.html#installation-in-a-multiuser-environment) currently (2016-07-22, Sage 7.2) says:

> After building Sage, you may optionally copy or move
> the entire build tree to `/usr/local` or another location.
