Support old SageNB widgets in Jupyter notebooks. This is done by writing wrapper functions with the old SageNB names returning `ipywidgets` widgets. That is, we essentially do

```
def input_box(...):
    return ipywidgets.Text(...)
```

The current implementation should be 100% compatible with `ipywidgets`, just extending it with Sage functionality.

We also try to support the old SageNB ``@`interact` functionality. Many examples of SageNB interacts can be found on https://wiki.sagemath.org/interact and we try to support as much as possible in Jupyter.

These are the changes in functionality that I know of:

1. `slider(0,10)` returns a slider which runs over the *integers* from 0 to 10 (in SageNB, this ran over *floats* from 0.0 to 10.0).

2. `range_slider()` with rational numbers is not implemented: https://github.com/ipython/ipywidgets/issues/760 (now implemented in https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets/pull/1356)

3. The output is updated only once when a button is clicked multiple times: https://github.com/ipython/ipywidgets/issues/763 (the needed hook to implement this is done in https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets/pull/1259)

4. Labels do not support HTML, only plain text and LaTeX: https://github.com/ipython/ipywidgets/issues/817

5. The visual presentation of widgets can be different.

**Tarballs**:

At least, the API is mostly compatible. I don't know any case where SageNB and Jupyter have significantly different behaviour. For the things that SageNB supports but Jupyter does not, either drop support for that feature or work with upstream to implement the feature in Jupyter. I don't strive to achieve 100% compatibility, I'm happy if it mostly works.

In some cases, the visual presentation might be different (Jupyter using a drop-down box while SageNB uses something like radio buttons). I don't care about that.

One potential issue is that SageNB supports all kinds of numbers (`Integer`, `RealNumber`, `Rational`, ...) for sliders while Jupyter only supports `int` and `float`.

I say that it is quite important to work towards such a goal for all interfaces: SageNB, Jupyter, SageMathCloud, SageMathCell. It is highly annoying to develop a nice interact and then discover that it does not work with another interface. Perhaps SageNB can be left behind now, but I hope that other 3 can converge to a single documented standard...

In particular, this patch is re-using the existing widgets from `ipywidgets`, it doesn't add completely new widgets (it doesn't change any Javascript).

IMHO, sliders behave strangely in SageNB:

```
@interact
def f(x=(1, 10)):
    print(x, parent(x))
```
This gives a slider with floating-point values between 1 and 10. In `ipywidgets`, this would become a slider with integer values between 1 and 10. I think that the `ipywidgets` convention makes more sense here: the type of the variable should correspond to the type in the interact abbrevation (`x=(1, 10)` gives integers while `x=(1.0, 10.0)` gives floats).

On top of this, this gives Python `float`s while in a Sage context, an element of `RR` would be more appropriate.

starting with  a freshly fetched 7.6.beta4, ` make distclean && make ptestlong ` passes with one well-known-failure :

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage -t --long src/sage/homology/simplicial_complex.py  # 1 doctest failed
----------------------------------------------------------------------
```

which passes when ran standalone.

A couple warnings are repeated in `widgetsnbextension-2.0.0rc1.log` and `ipywidgets-6.0.0.rc2.log` :

```
/usr/local/sage-exp/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/setuptools/dist.py:285: UserWarning: Normalizing '2.0.0.rc1' to '2.0.0rc1'

/usr/local/sage-exp/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/setuptools/dist.py:285: UserWarning: Normalizing '6.0.0.rc2' to '6.0.0rc2'
```

which look like innocuous booboos.

==> `positive_review `

For the record : congratulations for this intricate, lengthy and much expected patch. Thank you very much !

I'd recommend expedited inclusion of this update, which should go a long way making the Jupyter notebook as functional as the old one.

I plan to merge this one in my current working branch (which includes #20523 an its dependencies) and give it a couple "real-life" functional tests. But unless the results turns out to be non- or barely-functional (which would surprise me), further enhancements should go towards a new ticket.

Damn !

from the PREP tutorial "Sage Interact Quickstart" :

```
sage: @interact
sage: def _(f=input_box(x^2,width=20),
....: color=color_selector(widget='colorpicker', label=""),
....: axes=True,
....: fill=True,
....: zoom=range_slider(-3,3,default=(-3,3))):
....:     show(plot(f,(x,zoom[0], zoom[1]), color=color, axes=axes,fill=fill, figsize=3))
```
(I added the `figsize=3`)

gives a **static** fgure, with no controls. I see that in the terminal windows from where I launched the notebook :

```
[IPKernelApp] WARNING | The installed widget Javascript is the wrong version. It must satisfy the semver range ~2.1.0.
```
One hidden dependency ? Something to document (in plain English...) ? 

Or something more serious ?

BTW : this works well in the old Sage notebook (same binary, ran from another terminal...).

Your example works for me. My guess is that it's something like a browser cache which might interfere. Can you try clearing the cache and try again?

> Your example works for me. My guess is that it's something like a browser cache which might 
interfere. Can you try clearing the cache and try again?

Done. Same result.

I might have another problem : when I type "SAGE_BROWSER=chromium sage -n jupyter", Sage still opens a Firefox sheet.

Logging out of this sheet, manually opening Chromium, and pasting the address given in the controlling terminal window allows to open the same sheet in Chrome, with the **same** result.

Suggestions ?

Do you happen to have another installation of `ipywidgets`/`widgetsnbextension` which might interfere?

I'm setting this back to needs_review because I cannot reproduce your problem. I hope that other people will try it, so we can see if it works for them.

I tried your patch on two different installations (one physical machine, one pristine VM) where it succeeded. Coming back to my initial test case, I took the speps to remove entierely ipywidgets an widgetsnbextension from the systemwide installs. Theren your patch worked.

I conclude that, somehow, the systemwide installation(s) of Python extensions take precedence over a sage-specific installation. hence a couple questions :
* Is that expected or is that a bug ?
* If a bug, does it deserve a ticket ?
* If expected (not a bug), shouldn't this behavior be documented ?

In any case, This lifts my objections ==> `positive_review`.

And kudos !

Actually, there are 3 patches. Two of them (`get_interact_value_output.patch` and `output_exception.patch`) should be in https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ipywidgets/6.0.0.rc3

The other one (`widget_repr.patch`) is being discussed at https://github.com/ipython/ipywidgets/pull/1031 but upstream isn't very happy about it. However, this one is really only relevant for doctesting, not for runtime functionality.
