You have to allow tabs in makefiles, so the Emacs configuration should probably apply `(indent-tabs-mode . nil)` specifically for Python files, Cython files, shell scripts, `ReST` files, `txt` files. Any others? (Emacs should recognize a shell script and set the appropriate mode from the line `#!/usr/bin/env bash`.

Did you see the change that sets the major mode of that file?

I don't like how this becomes the *first* section of the "General conventions" document, as if it is the most important thing. I would for example put it right before the section "The Pickle Jar".

Also the title "General Code Style" doesn't really convey that it's about whitespace.
