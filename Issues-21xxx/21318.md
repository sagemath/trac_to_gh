<a id='comment:22'></a>1. Please reconsider punctuation in input and output blocks.

2. I am not sure whether handling of automatic minimization is best done in the methods `_add_` and `hadamard_product` (especially unsure about the first because it would be rather painful to call it with disabled minimization, overriding the convention about private methods). Perhaps the parent could have a flag whether minimization should always be performed or not?

3. `_add_`: in the example, the (new) method `linear_representation` introduced during review of a previous ticket could be used instead of extracting the information manually.

4. `_add_`: parameter `minimize=False` is not tested.

5. `_neg_`: in the example, `.is_trivial_zero()` could be used.

6. `_rmul_`: in the example, the (new) method `linear_representation` introduced during review of a previous ticket could be used instead of extracting the information manually.

7. `_rmul_`: I am not convinced that this method is called by the tests: In order to understand the problems with the tests of `_lmul_`, I deliberately introduced an error here and it was not raised in the tests.

8. `_lmul_`: The available (untested) test does not seem to be completely rewritten to this case; the last lines seem to belong to the test of `_rmul_`.

9. `_lmul_`: please add a test where `_lmul_` is called explicitly.

10. `hadamard_product`: in the examples and tests, the (new) method `linear_representation` introduced during review of a previous ticket could be used instead of extracting the information manually.

21. `hadamard_product`: I think that

```python
Matrix(tuple(
    srow.outer_product(orow).list()
    for srow in self.mu[a].rows()
    for orow in other.mu[a].rows())))

```
    could be simplified to `self.mu[a].tensor_product(other.mu[a])` which I consider to be more concise and clearer. I am not sure whether rewriting the left vectors to matrices, then calling `tensor_product` on the two single-row matrices and then extracting the first row would be more readable, too (similarly for the right vectors).

12. `one_hadamard`: I do not think that `one = ZZ(1)` is appropriate for all values of `coefficient_ring`.

Done.

> 2. I am not sure whether handling of automatic minimization is best done in the methods `_add_` and `hadamard_product` (especially unsure about the first because it would be rather painful to call it with disabled minimization, overriding the convention about private methods).

I agree that this is not optimal. I've now written a decorator `minimize_result` and introduce a flag in the parent for controlling the behavior.

> 3. `_add_`: in the example, the (new) method `linear_representation` introduced during review of a previous ticket could be used instead of extracting the information manually.


Done.

> 4. `_add_`: parameter `minimize=False` is not tested.


Now tested (indirectly) in the new decorator `minimize_result`

> 5. `_neg_`: in the example, `.is_trivial_zero()` could be used.


Indeed. Done.

> 6. `_rmul_`: in the example, the (new) method `linear_representation` introduced during review of a previous ticket could be used instead of extracting the information manually.


Done.

> 7. `_rmul_`: I am not convinced that this method is called by the tests: In order to understand the problems with the tests of `_lmul_`, I deliberately introduced an error here and it was not raised in the tests.


The problem was, that the `RecognizableSeries` was derived from `Element` and not `ModuleElement`, therefore, a fall-back action using a double-and-add algorithm where doubling is done by addition, was used and so `_rmul_` and `_lmul_` were actually never called.

Fixed now and added a test to make sure these methods are called.

Also, left and right was switched; fixed.

> 8. `_lmul_`: The available (untested) test does not seem to be completely rewritten to this case; the last lines seem to belong to the test of `_rmul_`.


Output removed.

> 9. `_lmul_`: please add a test where `_lmul_` is called explicitly.


Not needed anymore, as `_lmul_` is now properly tested.

> 10. `hadamard_product`: in the examples and tests, the (new) method `linear_representation` introduced during review of a previous ticket could be used instead of extracting the information manually.


Done.

Indeed, using `tensor_product` improves the code a lot. It is now used for the vectors, too.

Changed.
