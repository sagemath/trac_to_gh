Because of the way `fork()` works in Cygwin, it is necessary after forking a process for the child process to manually re-load (using the Windows API `LoadModule`) all DLLs that were dynamically loaded in the parent process.

This means that if the actually DLL file of a DLL loaded by the parent is missing, re-loading the module in the child process fails.  Cygwin's `fork()` is very sensitive to this, and treats it as a failure, returning with a "Resource temporarily unavailable" error.

This occurs after evaluating an `InlineFortran` call, because it compiles a Python module around the given fortran code, imports that module, and then immediately deletes the actual library file once it's been imported.  Thus any subsequent attempt to `fork()` that process will fail on Cygwin.

This fix simply prevents the immediate deletion of the temporary DLL.  Instead it sticks around for the lifetime of the process, at the end of which it (should) be deleted by the atexit handler for cleaning up temp dirs--at this point it is generally safe to delete the DLL.
