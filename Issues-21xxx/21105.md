<div id="comment:0"></div>

For a number field element `a`, `abs(a)` currently returns a floating point real number

```
sage: K.<cbrt2> = NumberField(x^3 - 2, 'a', embedding=1.26)
sage: abs(cbrt2)
1.25992104989487
sage: parent(_)
Real Field with 53 bits of precision
```
If a coercion embedding is defined with value in `RR`, the absolute value can be defined internally as it is the case for `AA`

```
sage: abs(AA(2).sqrt() - AA(2))
0.5857864376269049?
```
and also for quadratic extensions

```
sage: K.<sqrt2> = NumberField(x^2 - 2, 'a', embedding=1.41)
sage: abs(sqrt2)
sqrt2
```
We propose to change the behavior for embedded number fields. Namely make `abs` an internal operation.

As a (minor) consequence of the current behavior, the inequalities from `sage.geometry.polyhedron.representation.Inequality` gets badly displayed

```
sage: K.<cbrt2> = NumberField(x^3 - 2, 'a', embedding=1.26)
sage: P = Polyhedron(vertices=[(1,1,cbrt2),(cbrt2,1,1)])
sage: P.inequalities()
(An inequality (-cbrt2^2 - cbrt2 - 1, 0, 0) x + 4.84732210186307 >= 0,
 An inequality (cbrt2^2 + cbrt2 + 1, 0, 0) x - 3.84732210186307 >= 0)
```

I don't understand this sentence from the doc of `abs`

```
If ``prec`` is ``None`` or 53, then the complex double field is
used; otherwise the arbitrary precision (but slow) complex
field is used.  The result is in the corresponding real field.
```
The "complex double field" refers to I guess "CDF" but which is actually not used! I would rather remove that sentence and explain that the default precision is `53`.
