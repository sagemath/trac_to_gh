No, it is correct.  The documentation says:

```
sage: R.<x> = ZZ[[]]
sage: x._cmp_??
Source:
    cpdef int _cmp_(self, right) except -2:
        r"""
        Comparison of self and ``right``.

        We say two approximate power series are equal if they agree for
        all coefficients up to the *minimum* of the precisions of each.
        Thus, e.g., `f = 1 + q + O(q^2)` is equal to `g = 1 + O(q)`.

        This is how PARI defines equality of power series, but not how
        Magma defines equality. (Magma would declare `f` and `g` unequal.)
        The PARI/Sage convention is consistent with the idea that
        comparison should take place after coercing both elements into
        a common parent.  Hence, in the above example `f` is truncated
        to `f + O(q)`, which is considered to be equal to `g`, even
        though the coefficients of `q` are unknown for both series in
        that comparison.
