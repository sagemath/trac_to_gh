`Expression` objects have `is_positive`, `is_negative` and `is_zero` methods.
However, they do not have `is_nonnegative` and `is_nonpositive` methods.

Perhaps we can simply implement it as follows:

```python
def is_nonnegative(self):
    return self.is_positive() or self.is_zero()
```

And similarly:

```python
def is_nonpositive(self):
    return self.is_negative() or self.is_zero()
```

If this is the case, we may wish to add a warning in the relevant docstrings.
We may still, however, add `is_nonnegative`, etc.  Shouldn't we?
