Btw, is there same problem for example in `src/sage/combinat/degree_sequences.pyx`

```
    sig_on()
    seq = <unsigned char *> sig_malloc((n+1)*sizeof(unsigned char))
    memset(seq,0,(n+1)*sizeof(unsigned char))
    sig_off()
```

By the way, this number shows that some integer overflow is happening also (a different issue from this ticket).

The number 18446744072098938880 equals `<size_t><int>(10 << 28)` where the correct value would be just `<size_t>(10 << 28)` = 2684354560.
