Uh, sorry. I tested `Graph(10^10)`, but wrote that only in sage-devel, not here.

> > With `/proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory` as `0` or `1` it ends with `MemoryError: failed to allocate 18446744072098938880 * 8 bytes`

By the way, this number shows that some integer overflow is happening also (a different issue from this ticket).

The number 18446744072098938880 equals `<size_t><int>(10 << 28)` where the correct value would be just `<size_t>(10 << 28)` = 2684354560.
