```
P = piecewise([((0,2),x),((2,6),2)])
print P
plot(P)
```
Before this would have plotted the whole thing, now it defaults to the usual plotting only from -1 to 1 (which of course gives an error).

Moreover pieces are joined and `detect_poles=True` option skips the origin for no good reason:

```
P = piecewise([((-1,2),x),((2,5),1)])
print P
plot(P, -1, 5, detect_poles=True)
```

The old `Piecewise` has a custom plot method. This method is omitted in the current `piecewise`.

1. Why there is commented code? Reference to some ticket explaining stuff is fine, but not strange imports etc.
2. Why there is extra printing of pieces???
3. If I do specify the domain, then each piece is plotted over this domain!

I'll see if I can resolve all this in the next hour or so.
