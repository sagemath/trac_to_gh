```
P = piecewise([((0,2),x),((2,6),2)])
print P
plot(P)
```
Before this would have plotted the whole thing, now it defaults to the usual plotting only from -1 to 1 (which of course gives an error).

Moreover pieces are joined and `detect_poles=True` option skips the origin for no good reason:

```
P = piecewise([((-1,2),x),((2,5),1)])
print P
plot(P, -1, 5, detect_poles=True)
```

Correct.  So it would be nice to emulate that so everyone's code doesn't break - I had a not-so-nice time drawing graphs on the fly in class today because of this.  It seems reasonable, since piecewise is an unusual situation.

1. Why there is commented code? Reference to some ticket explaining stuff is fine, but not strange imports etc.
2. Why there is extra printing of pieces???
3. If I do specify the domain, then each piece is plotted over this domain!

I'll see if I can resolve all this in the next hour or so.

Address 1&2 and simplify a bit to get

```python
        def plot(cls, self, parameters, variable, *args, **kwds):
            from sage.plot.all import plot, Graphics
            g = Graphics()
            for (dom, fun) in self.items():
                g += plot(fun, (variable, dom.inf(), dom.sup()), *args, **kwds)
                # If it's the first piece, pass all arguments. Otherwise,
                # filter out 'legend_label' so that we don't add each
                # piece to the legend separately (trac #12651).
                kwds.pop('legend_label', None)
            return g
```

3 is tricky, however, because of a variety of ways to pass left and right bounds. I think we should factor out the logic of getting these bounds into a separate function which will say always set `xmin/xmax` keywords, then we can call this function in the top level `plot` as well as `plot` methods and have a guaranteed uniform behavior. Thoughts?

Andrey, please go ahead with your own branch, the plotting code is quite opaque and uninteresting to me, and I'm into other projects right now.
