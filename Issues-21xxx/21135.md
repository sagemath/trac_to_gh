With recent octave versions (>= 4.0)

```
sage: octave('1')  # hangs forever
```

The reason is that newer octave launch the GUI interface by default (there is an option `--no-gui` to get rid of it). See https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/NEWS-4.0.html

Apparently, they also changed the prompt from `>` to `>>`.

```
$ octave --no-gui --silent
>> 1
ans =  1
```
but this is not documented in the changelog.

---
Note: to test this branch, you should
- apply the branch
- do `sage -b`
- run the octave tests with

```
$ export SAGE_ROOT=$(sage -root)
$ sage -t --optional=sage,octave $SAGE_ROOT/src/sage/interfaces/octave.py
```

The difference is not big, but there is one place I don't understand, and moreover it does not work with complex matrices. Namely, in `_matrix` there is the following change:

```
         from sage.matrix.all import MatrixSpace
-        return MatrixSpace(R, nrows, ncols)(w)
+        s = str(self).strip()
+        v = s.split('\n ')
+        nrows = len(v)
+        if nrows == 0:
+            return MatrixSpace(R,0,0)(0)
+        ncols = len(v[0].split())
+        M = MatrixSpace(R, nrows, ncols)
+        v = sum([[x for x in w.split()] for w in v], [])
+        return M(v)
```
moreover it doesn't work on SMC either, so I'd just skip it, unless I understand when one should return 0.

`octave-cli` is the more local thing to call...

If you use `octave-cli` then you can get rid of `--no-gui`.

As you do not use the `prompt` variable you would better remove it.

Since your code does not depend on octave version you would better get rid of my `get_octave_version`.

This bug forbids full checking (by make ptestlong) of a proposed patch, since such a test currently fails when octave>4.0.0 is installed : octave starts a GUI, doesn't return and the doctest times out.

FYI, the following diff (a four-letters patch...) against the current (7.4beta1) sage is **sufficient** to have sage passing the tests for external interfaces :

```

where in the branch do you see octave called?
octave-cli is called, yes.
Unless you have SAGE_OCTAVE_COMMAND set.
Certainly if you have it set to octave it will do not what you want.
Unset it, then the tests should pass, I think.

Think again :

```
charpent@SAP5057241:~$ sage -sh

Starting subshell with Sage environment variables set.  Don't forget
to exit when you are done.  Beware:
 * Do not do anything with other copies of Sage on your system.
 * Do not use this for installing Sage packages using "sage -i" or for
   running "make" at Sage's root directory.  These should be done
   outside the Sage shell.

Bypassing shell configuration files...

Note: SAGE_ROOT=/usr/local/sage-7
(sage-sh) charpent@SAP5057241:~$ echo $SAGE_OCTAVE_COMMAND

(sage-sh) charpent@SAP5057241:~$ which octave
/usr/bin/octave
(sage-sh) charpent@SAP5057241:~$ octave

[ Octave starts its GUI. I exit from it]

(sage-sh) charpent@SAP5057241:~$ exit
exit
Exited Sage subshell.
charpent@SAP5057241:~$ echo $SAGE_OCTAVE_COMMAND

charpent@SAP5057241:~$
```

Ergo SAGE_OCTAVE_COMMAND is not set neither in the Sage shell neither out of it.

A "make ptestlong" on this machine FAILS with a timeout on ...doctest/external.py", leaving an unclosable octave gui (you have to kill -TERM it...). From my check of 7.4beta0 :

```
...
sage -t --long --warn-long 50.8 src/sage/doctest/external.py
    Timed out
**********************************************************************
...
**********************************************************************
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage -t --long --warn-long 50.8 src/sage/doctest/external.py  # Timed out
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Total time for all tests: 8702.9 seconds
    cpu time: 11743.1 seconds
    cumulative wall time: 14507.8 seconds
```

The octave documentation does not hint at any way of making the CLI interface the default (all it does provide is the --no-gui option and the octave-cli binary). Therefore, this fix is somewhat urgent for people having octave>4.0.0 installed...

[ Snip again... ]

I am devasted to have to insist...

I can only conjecture that you have not pulled the right branch, `public/21135` before running your tests.

Could you please re-check? The change you proposed is equivalent to the branch in the sense that no octave is called, only octave-cli.

As well, could you please check that octave-cli does not launch GUI for you.

I have //**NOT**// pulled #21135 : my diff was against the current (pristine (unmodified)) 7.4beta1. My point was that a four-letters patch was enough to solve my current difficulty (i. e. breaking something that used to work), and that the other proposed modificatins (which aim at //enhancing// something that used to work) are a //**separate**// issue...

> Could you please re-check? The change you proposed is equivalent to the branch in the sense that no octave is called, only octave-cli.


No point. See above.

> As well, could you please check that octave-cli does not launch GUI for you.



It does not.
