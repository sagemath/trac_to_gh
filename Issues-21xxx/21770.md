The initial packaging builds without problem and passes its own testsuite ; the resulting Sage passes ptestlong with only the usual transient error on `simplicial_complex.py` (which passes standalone).

<a id='comment:8'></a>
Sage-7.6.beta4 + #20523 + #21767 + #21770 (this patch) passes ptestlong witht two transient errors :

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage -t --long src/sage/homology/simplicial_set_morphism.py  # Bad exit: 2
sage -t --long src/sage/homology/simplicial_complex.py  # 1 doctest failed
----------------------------------------------------------------------
```
Both tests pass when run standalone.

This should close the R saga (for now) by allowing the current interfaces to work with R >= 3.3.x.

Still `needs_review`

We've already been there (see previous saga...) :
* R is a standard package
* R depends on PCRE starting 3.3.x
* A standard package cannot depend on an optional package

Therefore pcre has to be standard. QED.

OK. If I follow you :
* PCRE is not used by anything in Sage
* PCRE is used by R

Therefore, by *modus tollens*:
* R is not in Sage.

We should submit this interesting conclusion to `sage-devel` : the discussion would probably be lively and entertaining (for questionable values of "entertaining"...).

I'm on it. Count about 15 minutes to post an update patch, about 2-3 hours to compile and ptestlong it.

BTW : since #21767 and the present patch have been merged in #20523, I'll have to update it also before review.

* Passes its own testsuite.
* (#21567 + #21770 + #20523 remerged with the two previous ones) passes ptestlong with two failures :

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage -t --long src/sage/homology/simplicial_complex.py  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t --long src/sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_ideal.py  # 1 doctest failed
----------------------------------------------------------------------
```

The first one is transient (passes when ran standalone) ; the second one is a well-documented, ticketed and not yet fixed difference on the expression of the expected result.

==> `needs_review` for good.
