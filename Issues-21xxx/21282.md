This is purely a matplotlib problem with the default font. There is nothing to be fixed here. As explained in the doc of axes_labels in sage/plot/graphics.py, unicode characters are already accepted and transmitted correctly to matplotlib.

Well, it didn't, apparently, in this case.  So is this an upstream problem to report there?  I think it would be reasonable to put this as an example that doesn't work in our doc, even, if upstream won't/can't fix it.
