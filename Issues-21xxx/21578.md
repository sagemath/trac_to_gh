I first noticed this problem [ticket:17635#comment:241 here]

Compiling any Cython modules that include `fflas.h` either directly, on indirectly through ffpack, linbox, etc. fail to compile on Cygwin (and hypothetically other platforms).

This is due to the following lines in, of all places, `pyport.h` (which is included by `Python.h`):

```
#if defined(HAVE_OPENPTY) || defined(HAVE_FORKPTY)
#if !defined(HAVE_PTY_H) && !defined(HAVE_LIBUTIL_H) && !defined(HAVE_UTIL_H)
/* BSDI does not supply a prototype for the 'openpty' and 'forkpty'
   functions, even though they are included in libutil. */
#include <termios.h>
extern int openpty(int *, int *, char *, struct termios *, struct winsize *);
extern pid_t forkpty(int *, char *, struct termios *, struct winsize *);
#endif /* !defined(HAVE_PTY_H) && !defined(HAVE_LIBUTIL_H) */
#endif /* defined(HAVE_OPENPTY) || defined(HAVE_FORKPTY) */
```

~~Cygwin does not have (for whatever reason) `HAVE_PTY_H` or `HAVE_LIBUTIL_H` defined (even though pty.h *does* exist on Cygwin--this might be a bug in Python's configure.ac).~~ **Correction:** `HAVE_PTY_H` *is* defined, so maybe `termios.h` is being included from somewhere else.  Turns out the real culprit (still in `pyport.h`) is:

```
/* On QNX 6, struct termio must be declared by including sys/termio.h
   if TCGETA, TCSETA, TCSETAW, or TCSETAF are used.  sys/termio.h must
   be included before termios.h or it will generate an error. */
#if defined(HAVE_SYS_TERMIO_H) && !defined(__hpux)
#include <sys/termio.h>
#endif
```

My Linux system does not have `sys/termio.h`, but Cygwin does--apparently--maybe for some backward compatibility reason (it is simply an alias for `sys/termios.h` with an *s*).

This results in `Python.h` including `termios.h` which [defines](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/termios.3.html) several macros for baud rates with names like `B0`, ..., `B230400`.  This ends up breaking `fflas-ffpack/fflas/fflas_igemm/igemm_kernels.inl`, which is included (indirectly) from `fflas.h`, because it contains a variable named "`B0`" which is replaced by the macro in `termios.h`

What a pain to have B0 defined!
I've fixed upstream fflas-ffpack, by renaming `B0` into `B_0` (and other variables in the same way, for consistency): [https://github.com/linbox-team/fflas-ffpack/commit/346498a71b2759f5913ba8c4c2fe025bbf8b3faa](https://github.com/linbox-team/fflas-ffpack/commit/346498a71b2759f5913ba8c4c2fe025bbf8b3faa)
