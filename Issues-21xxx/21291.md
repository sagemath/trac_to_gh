In 6.9.beta5 I have:

```
sage: sage: timeit("is_package_installed('bliss')")
625 loops, best of 3: 163 µs per loop
```
w￼hereas in 7.4.beta1

```
sage: timeit("is_package_installed('bliss')")
5 loops, best of 3: 1.36 s per loop
```

possibly related: #20382

Both keep calling 'pip list' as well (same issue as with Tutte polynomial).

I guess this is because of the PIP stuff which got added in #19213. I see no easy fix... the only possibility is removing the use of PIP in `is_package_installed`.

I thought of (temporarily anyway, because of #20382) adding some keyword (default: `False`) like `update` or `include_pip_packages`, passing that in addition where/when appropriate.

That way we wouldn't completely exclude "pip" packages elsewhere.

IMHO `installed` (or some related variable) should be a dictionary mapping just "base" package names to {`True`, `False`}, i.e., a `set()`.

Then `is_package_installed()` could just `return package in WHATEVER` (unless also `update=True` was passed, or the variable is yet `None`).

The package versions could be recorded in *separate* dictionaries.

There's also a colon missing after `default`.

\\

Isn't the description of `exclude_pip` in `list_packages()` as wrong as that of `local`?

If the former is `True` (**not** `False`), PIP packages are excluded (not considered), or keep the `False`, and remove the "not" in *"then [also] pip packages are not considered."*.

Similar for the latter (`local`):  Either change `False` to `True`, or remove the "not".

Next typo (in before):

s/if set to ``True`` **than** connection error/if set to ``True`` **then** connection error/

\\

According to [the current Sage Developer's Guide](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#documentation-strings), the syntax for arguments is

```
INPUT:

- ``foo`` (default: ``'bar'``) -- I won't describe its meaning here
```
that is, with a colon after `default`, and a **double-dash** before the description.

The *"**than** no error is raised"* is still in.

Also, in *"a sublist of 'standard', 'optional', ..."* the package type strings should have code markup (<code>\`\`'standard'\`\`</code> etc.).

Similar further down in `package_versions()`; there, math markup (only single backticks) is used instead of double backticks.

No, you just made it worse... ;-)

I only meant replace the misspelled *"than"* by *"then"*.

Now the *"than"* is still in, and the description is wrong, as `ignore_URLError=True` of course means **don't** raise an exception but simply return `None` on errors, but you turned the *"no error"* into *"an error"* and added another logically wrong sentence.

I'll push a branch with the fixes *later* if you don't have the time.

It's still a blocker ticket...

So I've fixed more docstrings on top of your changes.

Either check out my branch `u/leif/21291`, or simply set the ticket to positive review.

For beta4, it's unfortunately meanwhile too late.
