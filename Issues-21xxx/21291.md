In 6.9.beta5 I have:

```
sage: sage: timeit("is_package_installed('bliss')")
625 loops, best of 3: 163 µs per loop
```
w￼hereas in 7.4.beta1

```
sage: timeit("is_package_installed('bliss')")
5 loops, best of 3: 1.36 s per loop
```

possibly related: #20382

Both keep calling 'pip list' as well (same issue as with Tutte polynomial).

I thought of (temporarily anyway, because of #20382) adding some keyword (default: `False`) like `update` or `include_pip_packages`, passing that in addition where/when appropriate.

That way we wouldn't completely exclude "pip" packages elsewhere.

IMHO `installed` (or some related variable) should be a dictionary mapping just "base" package names to {`True`, `False`}, i.e., a `set()`.

Then `is_package_installed()` could just `return package in WHATEVER` (unless also `update=True` was passed, or the variable is yet `None`).

The package versions could be recorded in *separate* dictionaries.

There's also a colon missing after `default`.

\\

Isn't the description of `exclude_pip` in `list_packages()` as wrong as that of `local`?

If the former is `True` (**not** `False`), PIP packages are excluded (not considered), or keep the `False`, and remove the "not" in *"then [also] pip packages are not considered."*.

Similar for the latter (`local`):  Either change `False` to `True`, or remove the "not".

The *"**than** no error is raised"* is still in.

Also, in *"a sublist of 'standard', 'optional', ..."* the package type strings should have code markup (<code>\`\`'standard'\`\`</code> etc.).

Similar further down in `package_versions()`; there, math markup (only single backticks) is used instead of double backticks.

`src/sage_setup/optional_extension.py` uses `list_packages()` (which currently has `exclude_pip=False` as default); should we "fix" the former, too, and if so, here?

(Changing the default in `list_packages()` is perhaps too backward-incompatible, or we'd at least have to change a couple of calls elsewhere I guess.)

In principle, any pip-related function here should first check whether `is_package_installed("pip")`... ;-)

(There currently seems to be a dependency missing at least, since pip meanwhile is a standard package.  Not sure whether we'll get cyclic dependencies then, though...)

Fixed by #21403 (adding the missing dependency on `pip`); will appear in 7.4.beta4 I guess.

No, you just made it worse... ;-)

I only meant replace the misspelled *"than"* by *"then"*.

Now the *"than"* is still in, and the description is wrong, as `ignore_URLError=True` of course means **don't** raise an exception but simply return `None` on errors, but you turned the *"no error"* into *"an error"* and added another logically wrong sentence.

So I've fixed more docstrings on top of your changes.

Either check out my branch `u/leif/21291`, or simply set the ticket to positive review.

For beta4, it's unfortunately meanwhile too late.
