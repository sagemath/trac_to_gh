This ticket cleans up how the contents of `src/bin` are installed. One of its goals is to make the `sagelib` installation done by `src/setup.py` self-contained regarding the scripts that it needs at runtime.

Previous tickets moved some of the scripts to `build/bin` (no longer installed in `SAGE_LOCAL`). 

In follow-up tickets, `src/bin` could be cleaned up more. 
- See the list of files added on this ticket to `src/setup.py` for beginnings of a categorization.
- #29850: Install `src/bin/sage-env-config` as part of `sage_conf`
- #29847: Install `sage_setup` with `setuptools` as a prerequisite for building/installing sagelib, install sage-the-distribution scripts as "scripts"


Depends on #29111

Adding hooks for distributors is not a good direction for development.  It's better to sort out in sagelib itself which scripts should be considered part of sagelib, and which ones are provided by sage-the-distribution instead.

I'll think about it. Like I said it is a "nice to have", not a must have. But this will mark a transition for distros. Before this, most of us were manually installing a selection of scripts. Suddenly the install won't be manual anymore :)

Here are some thoughts:

Perhaps could just be deleted:
- `sage-cython`: #29923
- `sage-native-execute`: look at the script and see #9386. 
- `sage-open`: I wonder if the comment in that script is still valid; perhaps it can be deleted, or done purely in Python in sage/misc/viewer.py, the only place it's used. Maybe I'll look into this.
- `sage-pypkg-location`: apparently unused
- `sage-unzip` is in the listed, but the script itself is gone, isn't it?


Doctesting-related scripts. Where do these go?
- sage-runtests
- coverage scripts
- sage-fix-doctests
- sage-startuptime

In the libexec group:
- sage-cleaner?

Only relevant for sage-the-distribution:
- `sage-download`
- `sage-clone-source`
- `sage-sdist`
- `sage-location`

Per #29111, they are sagelib scripts.

Not sure about this one.
