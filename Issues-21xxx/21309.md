Thebe is a Jupyter javascript plugin for static sites that allows to render
selected divs of an HTML page as live cells connected to a Jupyter server.

- Code repository and documentation: https://github.com/oreillymedia/thebe
- Example/demo: https://oreillymedia.github.io/thebe/

Ticket #20690 aims to use this technology to implement live documentation
in the Jupyter notebook. Indeed, live documentation is one of the features
we had in the legacy Sage notebook and that was not yet available in Sage
when using the Jupyter notebook.

A first implementation of #20690 was entangling thebe.js within Sage source
code. Since upstream is well-defined, the aim of this ticket is to instead
package it the usual way, and #20690 is now based on this packaged version.

The zipball can be found at
https://github.com/oreillymedia/thebe/archive/9624e0a07a00026103dce1a3e32bbfbf90a6d0f9.zip
and should be renamed `thebe-9624e0a0.zip`
(upstream does not propose explicit releases).

It can also temporarily be downloaded at
https://lipn.univ-paris13.fr/~monteil/hebergement/tmp/thebe-9624e0a0.zip

Most javascript libs have dual names, for example `node` vs `nodejs` or `d3` vs `d3js`. Since we used the `*js` name for in other packages, i took that one, but indeed, in the case of `thebe` there is no `*js` version. So i renamed the package `thebe`as suggested.
