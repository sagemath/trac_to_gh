We propose additional methods in the `cdef class SkewPolynomial_finite_field_dense` for improved multiplication and division of ring elements. We also propose a new class `cdef class SkewPolynomial_finite_field_karatsuba` to handle the basic skew polynomial operations in the finite field case. 

Note: The original ticket #13215 first introduced this functionality. That was subsequently modified to support the basic implementation of skew polynomials and the karatsuba based methods from that ticket that were removed are being reintroduced here.
