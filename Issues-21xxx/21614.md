Same with `tan` and `imag`:

```
sage: real(sqrt(sin(x)))
sqrt(abs(sin(x)))*cos(1/2*arctan2(cos(real_part(x))*sinh(imag_part(x)), cosh(imag_part(x))*sin(real_part(x))))
sage: _.subs(x==0)
...
RuntimeError: arctan2_eval(): arctan2(0,0) encountered
```
SymPy expands similarly but gives NaN on substitution instead of an exception.

This all would not be of concern if not 3d plotting would likely need real/imag parts of a function, their workaround `real(...,hold=True)` works perfectly but this is not the general solution that is needed.

One solution would be to return `NaN` instead of throwing up.

Then make it known in that **documentation** that I just decided that symbolic NaN is to be returned whenever the result is not defined, not even complex infinity. That pertains to expressions, not relations. It could also be returned with `0/0`.

I think the SymPy folks have thought more about their ad hoc solution, and if I copy it it's not ad hoc, either.

```
Not a Number.

This serves as a place holder for numeric values that are indeterminate.
Most operations on NaN, produce another NaN.  Most indeterminate forms,
such as ``0/0`` or ``oo - oo` produce NaN.  Two exceptions are ``0**0``
and ``oo**0``, which all produce ``1`` (this is consistent with Python's
float).

NaN is loosely related to floating point nan, which is defined in the
IEEE 754 floating point standard, and corresponds to the Python
``float('nan')``.  Differences are noted below.

NaN is mathematically not equal to anything else, even NaN itself.  This
explains the initially counter-intuitive results with ``Eq`` and ``==`` in
the examples below.

NaN is not comparable so inequalities raise a TypeError.  This is in
constrast with floating point nan where all inequalities are false.

It is very hard to keep an overview of all details that can appear in "symbolics" (minus algebra). There are some bright people leading the SymPy effort. I think it's a good start to follow them.
