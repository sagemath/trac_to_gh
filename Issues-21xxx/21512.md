<a id='comment:5'></a>Installation worked great. Inside `sage -sh`, I managed to

```
pandoc -s -o file.md file.rst
notedown file.md -o file.ipynb
```

and opens in Jupyter correctly.

(There are some issues with the title, references, but I think these issues will be look at more closely in a follow up ticket like #21513 or #21514)
