Actually a new install only got until ecl. I remember working around by using gcc6 first until that fails then switching. I still provide the log for the env you requested but can give you a suitable log only when I get over the ecl problem.

This was after distclean and with -j1.

The cause of the problem. I need to understand *why* those files need `-std=c++11`. Any why did you add `-std=c++11` to those 2 files? That seems like a totally arbitrary choice to me.

It's a bad idea to "fix" a problem without understanding it. Otherwise, you might be hiding the problem instead of actually fixing it. When the problem comes back in the future, it might be even harder to fix because of an improper fix.

I agree but don't have the illusion you ultimately understand what's going on. You always test hypotheses with a limited number of experiments so you can only reject not accept one with 100 percent certainty.

For very subtle (possibly non-reproducible) errors, you might be right. But this ticket looks rather easy to understand.\n\n*Something* requires C++11.

I don't buy this. For very subtle (possibly non-reproducible) errors, you might be right. But this ticket looks rather easy to understand.

*Something* requires C++11. From reading the error message, it should be easy to figure out which line in which source file actually requires it. Play with that line to understand things better... try to reduce the file to a simple test-case... look at the pre-processed source... figure out what's different on your system...
