This adds a new file generated for each interpreter, called `interp_<name>.h`.  Its purpose is to provide the correct `__declspec(dllexport/import)` on exported function definitions, so that they have the correct link-time behavior when building the interpreter wrappers themselves.

This is a workaround to #19868.  Ideally this would be fixed directly in Cython so that such a workaround is not needed, but after exploring the issue it seems that for now providing such a workaround is easier than fixing Cython.

Explicit use of the `interp_<name>.h` headers replaces the implicit `cdef extern:` statements in the `wrapper_<name>.pxd` definition files.  This ensures that the function declarations (with the correct `__declspec` attribute) are included from the .h files, instead of being written directly into Cython-generated C files.  The end result has no visible differences for users of the library.

This currently depends on #20730 but doesn't strictly have to.  It was just easier to understand the code and see what needed to be changed where *after* it was refactored.

I don't want to be annoying, but this ticket depends on #20730 which depends on #20238, so it might not be merged soon anyway.

I tried building with a Cython with Jeroen's two patches applied, and with his suggested patch above, and early signs are good for this solving the problem.

I'm still running full `ptestlong` just to be sure, but it compiled with no problems--bravo!

Assuming this works, the question remains what to do in the short term.  There's still not a consensus on accepting [Cython-1650](https://github.com/cython/cython/pull/1650).  And even if it were accepted there's no consensus yet on the syntax.  

1) We could accept my fix in the short term, if needed, and back it out later.  But that's slightly annoying, especially since it adds new generated files.

2) Alternatively, we could patch Cython for now assuming that Jeroen's patch will be accepted *at some point*, but that's problematic for downstream support, especially considering the syntax uncertainties.

I prefer 1) for now because I don't like relying on patches, especially when it means building is impossible downstream *without* those patches, and further still given that it's a not completely insignificant patch (it's a new feature to Cython, not just a bug fix).

That said, I'm okay with either way.

Went ahead and rebased my existing branch, so that it's good to go if need be. But I'll await further feedback on how to move forward with this...

I agree with you that 1) is not very satisfactory but is the way to go before the discussion about cython settles down.

Could you use the :trac: syntax for http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/19868
And mention the way 2) should fix the wrongly generated headers in the docstrings, including ticket numbers on cython tracker?
