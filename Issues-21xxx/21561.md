In #20096, OpenBLAS was made standard in place of ATLAS, but the build fails:

Until we merge a working version of OpenBLAS, we should probably revert the default to ATLAS.

The current version in Sage apparently crashes (or makes other parts of Sage crash) on any "recent" AMD CPU (Bulldozer, Piledriver aka `bdver1`, `bdver2` / Opteron 62xx, 63xx, etc.).
