# Issue 28652: HyperbolicGeodesic.angle() returns mathematically incorrect results

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28889

Original creator: @maltekliemann

## TL;DR

`HyperbolicGeodesic.angle()` yields mathematically incorrect results. For example:


```
sage: g = HyperbolicPlane().UHP().get_geodesic(1, -1)  # Unit circle
sage: h = HyperbolicPlane().UHP().get_geodesic(0, I)  # Imaginary line
sage: g.angle(h)
1/2*pi
sage: h.angle(g) 
0
```


There's nothing to be found about this in sage-support or sage-devel.

## Details

The interesting part of the implementation uses the upper half-plane model and may be found [here](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/87c3057957495ee3ff135e88f792151b8c89cea9/src/sage/geometry/hyperbolic_space/hyperbolic_geodesic.py#L1524-L1545).  The algorithm is the following: Transform the upper half-plane so that one geodesic is moved onto the imaginary line. The other will be a half-circle intersecting that line, and it's easy to figure out a formula for their angle (see the last line).

I believe this is the problem: Take a look at the lexicographic sorting in the implementation I presume this serves to order the points so that any `+Infinity` contained in the sorted lists is moved to the front of the list. But that's exactly the problem: After doing so, line 1532 checks if `p2 != Infinity`. But this will always happen, as any `Infinity` entry was just moved to front of the list, except, of course, if both ideal endpoints are `Infinity` (which really shouldn't happen).

I've completely rewritten the implementation and added doctests. I'll submit that in a moment.

The bugfix addresses the problem as described. The new code is well-commented and adds tests.

Thanks a lot for the fix. There are some small details with the formatting of the documentation that should still be changed, IMO. The double colon `::` indicates the start of an indented code block and it can break building of the documentation if misplaced (possibly when `SAGE_DOCBUILD_OPTS='--include-tests-blocks'`). Therefore, please apply these changes:

This also removes trailing whitespace.
