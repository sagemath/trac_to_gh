## TL;DR

`HyperbolicGeodesic.angle()` yields mathematically incorrect results. For example:


```
sage: g = HyperbolicPlane().UHP().get_geodesic(1, -1)  # Unit circle
sage: h = HyperbolicPlane().UHP().get_geodesic(0, I)  # Imaginary line
sage: g.angle(h)
1/2*pi
sage: h.angle(g) 
0
```


There's nothing to be found about this in sage-support or sage-devel.

## Details

The interesting part of the implementation uses the upper half-plane model and may be found [here](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/87c3057957495ee3ff135e88f792151b8c89cea9/src/sage/geometry/hyperbolic_space/hyperbolic_geodesic.py#L1524-L1545).  The algorithm is the following: Transform the upper half-plane so that one geodesic is moved onto the imaginary line. The other will be a half-circle intersecting that line, and it's easy to figure out a formula for their angle (see the last line).

I believe this is the problem: Take a look at the lexicographic sorting in the implementation I presume this serves to order the points so that any `+Infinity` contained in the sorted lists is moved to the front of the list. But that's exactly the problem: After doing so, line 1532 checks if `p2 != Infinity`. But this will always happen, as any `Infinity` entry was just moved to front of the list, except, of course, if both ideal endpoints are `Infinity` (which really shouldn't happen).
