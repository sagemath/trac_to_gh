# Issue 18827: Equality shouldn't also be unequal

Issue created by migration from Trac.

```
bool((1/8*sqrt(2)*(sqrt(2)*(sqrt(2) - 2) + 4*sqrt(2)) + 1/4*sqrt(2)*(sqrt(2) - 2) + 3/4*sqrt(2) - 1/2) < (1/8*sqrt(2)*(sqrt(2) + 2) + 1/4*sqrt(2) + 1/4))
```

apparently yields `True`, though these expressions are apparently actually equal.  See [this ask.sagemath question](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/29228/unexpanded-symbolic-inequalities-yield-erroneous-results/) for details.

Can't reproduce this on 6.9beta (I get false for < and true for ==)

Awesome, thanks.  I'm sorry for not checking myself, only had time to report it before I forgot and it got lost.
