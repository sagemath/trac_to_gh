Looks like a problem with MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET.

```

I'm guessing that this should be dealt with separately.

I would like to give this a positive review, but since I can't build Sage, I also can't build the documentation or run doctests. So for now I will have to leave the rest of the review to others.

Right now homebrew's python3 is shadowing Xcode's, so I don't know. I would rather not uninstall homebrew's since it is used by other homebrew packages that I want to keep.

I have bigger issues right now: I can make almost no progress building Sage with 9.3.beta4. For example, with #31050 merged with beta4, `gmpy2` fails to build:

```

  #include <stdio.h>
```

Is my command-line tools installation broken? It is certainly true that the named `sysroot` directory does not exist, but instead it's `.../MacOSX11.1.sdk`. Where is that path stored? I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling the command-line tools, uninstalling and reinstalling homebrew and its packages, but no luck.

In contrast, with just #31050 (which was based on beta3), I see the following in the `gmpy2` log file:

```
  gcc -Wno-unused-result -Wsign-compare -Wunreachable-code -fno-common -dynamic -DNDEBUG -g -fwrapv -O3 -Wall -I/usr/local/include -I/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX11.0.sdk/usr/include -I/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX11.0.sdk/System/Library/Frameworks/Tk.framework/Versions/8.5/Headers -I./src -I/usr/local/include -I/usr/local/opt/openssl@1.1/include -I/usr/local/opt/sqlite/include -I/Users/palmieri/Desktop/Sage/sage_builds/TESTING/TEMP/sage-9.3.beta4/local/include -I/usr/local/Cellar/python@3.9/3.9.1/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.9/include/python3.9 -c src/gmpy2.c -o build/temp.macosx-11-x86_64-3.9/src/gmpy2.o -DSHARED=1
```

(same wrong path given to `-I`) but `gmpy2` builds successfully.

Separately, on a machine running Catalina, I'm having problems with `cypari`...

In a (working) Homebrew installation on Catalina, I don't have these `/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX11.0.sdk` paths used by the tools - ie.
gcc/clang  is installed in 
`InstalledDir: /Applications/Xcode-beta.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/bin`

This can be seen in config.log

I'm not clever enough to figure out how to hack `scipy` so it builds. If I issue the command `export SYSTEM_VERSION_COMPAT=1` globally before building Sage, then `cython` doesn't build. If I just issue it in the `scipy` spkg-install script, then `scipy` doesn't build with the same error as in comment:31.

Edit: the error with `cython` after executing `export SYSTEM_VERSION_COMPAT=1`:

```
ERROR: Cython-0.29.21-cp39-cp39-macosx_11_0_x86_64.whl is not a supported wheel on this platform.
```

This is with this ticket and an updated `setuptools` and `setuptools_scm`.

then Sage builds (if I also incorporate various other changes from #30651), but I get doctest failures of the form

```

We could (a) not worry about these for now, (b) filter out these warnings, (c) tinker with `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET`, or (d) something else. I don't have an opinion about which way to go.
