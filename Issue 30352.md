3.9.1 is out https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-391/
Release Date: Dec. 7, 2020

"3.9.1 is the first version of Python to support macOS 11 Big Sur. With Xcode 11 and later it is now possible to build “Universal 2” binaries which work on Apple Silicon. We are providing such an installer as the macos11.0 variant. This installer can be deployed back to older versions, tested down to OS X 10.9. As we are waiting for an updated version of pip, please consider the macos11.0 installer experimental."

Not sure which updated version of pip they are referring to. 20.3 (2020-11-30) lists "Add support for MacOS Big Sur compatibility tags. (#9138)" https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/news/#id15

No new news items regarding Big Sur in 20.3.3 (2020-12-15)

If this works (and I'll test it out soon), it should be a blocker, since I can't build Sage's Python 3.8 on Big Sur.

This builds for me on Big Sur. With the old version of `wheel`, I (not surprisingly) hit the problem fixed by #31050. With an updated `wheel`, `gmpy2` still fails to build, with this error:

Looks like a problem with MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET.

We should probably also update to latest `pip`

Great, with the new `pip` and new `wheel`, everything works until I hit `scipy`. The error is not one I remember seeing before:

```

I'm guessing that this should be dealt with separately.

I would like to give this a positive review, but since I can't build Sage, I also can't build the documentation or run doctests. So for now I will have to leave the rest of the review to others.

We can also try to throw in an upgrade of `setuptools`...

But doesn't the python3 from XCode work?


---

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2020-12-17 19:31:14

Right now homebrew's python3 is shadowing Xcode's, so I don't know. I would rather not uninstall homebrew's since it is used by other homebrew packages that I want to keep.

I have bigger issues right now: I can make almost no progress building Sage with 9.3.beta4. For example, with #31050 merged with beta4, `gmpy2` fails to build:

```
  Compiling with an SDK that doesn't seem to exist: /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX11.0.sdk
  Please check your Xcode installation
  gcc -Wno-unused-result -Wsign-compare -Wunreachable-code -fno-common -dynamic -DNDEBUG -g -fwrapv -O3 -Wall -I/usr/local/include -isysroot /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX11.0.sdk -I/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX11.0.sdk/usr/include -I/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX11.0.sdk/System/Library/Frameworks/Tk.framework/Versions/8.5/Headers -O2 -g -I./src -I/usr/local/include -I/usr/local/opt/openssl@1.1/include -I/usr/local/opt/sqlite/include -I/Users/palmieri/Desktop/Sage/sage_builds/TESTING/TEMP/sage-9.3.beta4/local/include -I/usr/local/Cellar/python@3.9/3.9.1/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.9/include/python3.9 -c src/gmpy2.c -o build/temp.macosx-11-x86_64-3.9/src/gmpy2.o -DSHARED=1
  clang: warning: no such sysroot directory: '/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX11.0.sdk' [-Wmissing-sysroot]

  #include <stdio.h>
```

Is my command-line tools installation broken? It is certainly true that the named `sysroot` directory does not exist, but instead it's `.../MacOSX11.1.sdk`. Where is that path stored? I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling the command-line tools, uninstalling and reinstalling homebrew and its packages, but no luck.

In contrast, with just #31050 (which was based on beta3), I see the following in the `gmpy2` log file:

```
  gcc -Wno-unused-result -Wsign-compare -Wunreachable-code -fno-common -dynamic -DNDEBUG -g -fwrapv -O3 -Wall -I/usr/local/include -I/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX11.0.sdk/usr/include -I/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX11.0.sdk/System/Library/Frameworks/Tk.framework/Versions/8.5/Headers -I./src -I/usr/local/include -I/usr/local/opt/openssl@1.1/include -I/usr/local/opt/sqlite/include -I/Users/palmieri/Desktop/Sage/sage_builds/TESTING/TEMP/sage-9.3.beta4/local/include -I/usr/local/Cellar/python@3.9/3.9.1/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.9/include/python3.9 -c src/gmpy2.c -o build/temp.macosx-11-x86_64-3.9/src/gmpy2.o -DSHARED=1
```

(same wrong path given to `-I`) but `gmpy2` builds successfully.

Separately, on a machine running Catalina, I'm having problems with `cypari`...

In a (working) Homebrew installation on Catalina, I don't have these `/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX11.0.sdk` paths used by the tools - ie.
gcc/clang  is installed in 
`InstalledDir: /Applications/Xcode-beta.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/bin`
and not in `/Library/...`.

This can be seen in config.log


---

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2020-12-18 23:02:59

`config.log` is a good place to look. I see that `gfortran -v` prints that it is configured using `--with-sysroot=/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX11.0.sdk`. I reinstalled homebrew's gcc but it didn't help. Any ideas how this is path determined? What does `gfortran -v` say for you?

(For `gcc/clang`, I see `InstalledDir: /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/bin`.)


---

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2020-12-19 04:47:20

Well, this is probably not the right thing to do in the long term, but I created a symlink connecting `MacOSX11.1.sdk` to `MacOSX11.0.sdk`. The build still fails on `scipy` with

but the other problems seem to be solved.

scipy probably needs an update, and/or a hack:

I'm not clever enough to figure out how to hack `scipy` so it builds. If I issue the command `export SYSTEM_VERSION_COMPAT=1` globally before building Sage, then `cython` doesn't build. If I just issue it in the `scipy` spkg-install script, then `scipy` doesn't build with the same error as in comment:31.

Edit: the error with `cython` after executing `export SYSTEM_VERSION_COMPAT=1`:

```
ERROR: Cython-0.29.21-cp39-cp39-macosx_11_0_x86_64.whl is not a supported wheel on this platform.
```

This is with this ticket and an updated `setuptools` and `setuptools_scm`.

I guess we should move my derailment of the discussion to #30651.

Changing priority from major to critical.

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2020-12-27 19:45:09

Does someone have time to review this ticket? The tests have already run successfully.

Note that an update to latest 3.8.x is not a good alternative:

  https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-387/
  Python 3.8.7 - Release Date: Dec. 21, 2020
  macOS 11 Big Sur not fully supported

  Python 3.8.7 is not yet fully supported on macOS 11 Big Sur. It will install on macOS 11 Big Sur and will run on Apple Silicon Macs using Rosetta 2 translation. However, a few features do not work correctly, most noticeably those involving searching for system libraries (vs user libraries) such as ctypes.util.find_library() and in Distutils. This limitation affects both Apple Silicon and Intel processors. We are looking into improving the situation for Python 3.8.8.

On macOS 10.14.6 with lots of Homebrew packages,
successfully ran

```bash
$ git trac checkout 30589
$ source .homebrew-build-env
$ ./bootstrap -q
$ ./configure --without-system-python3 --enable-download-from-upstream-url -q
$ make -s V=0
```

resulting in a build of Sage 9.3.beta4 based on Python 3.9.1.

But something that worked for another Sage install currently at 9.3.beta5:

```bash
$ V=0 sage -i pynormaliz
```

failed here while attempting to build e-antic.

On OS X Big Sur + various homebrew packages, if I use

```
% ./configure --with-system-python3=no --enable-download-from-upstream-url 
```

then Sage builds (if I also incorporate various other changes from #30651), but I get doctest failures of the form

```
File "src/sage/misc/sagedoc.py", line 646, in sage.misc.sagedoc.format

```

We could (a) not worry about these for now, (b) filter out these warnings, (c) tinker with `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET`, or (d) something else. I don't have an opinion about which way to go.

In any case, let's worry about optional packages like e-antic later.
