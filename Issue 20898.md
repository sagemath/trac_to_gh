CC:  chapoton charpent

On recent octave versions (at least 4.0.3) the command `octave` launch the GUI interface. Hence on my computer

```
sage: octave('1')  # launch octave GUI and hangs forever
```

With the option `--no-gui` everything is fine.

```
         from sage.matrix.all import MatrixSpace
-        return MatrixSpace(R, nrows, ncols)(w)
+        s = str(self).strip()
+        v = s.split('\n ')

moreover it doesn't work on SMC either, so I'd just skip it, unless I understand when one should return 0.

there is also an issue with `DISPLAY` --- if it is unset, then `--no-gui` comes into force implicitly...

My proposal (in the current ticket branch) is to call `octave-cli` instead of `octave`, which always launches `octave-gui` (according to my tests on Fedora 23 with octave 4.0.1). `octave-cli` is available for octave versions 3 and 4, so this is a simplification too.

If you use `octave-cli` then you can get rid of `--no-gui`.

As you do not use the `prompt` variable you would better remove it.

where in the branch do you see octave called?
octave-cli is called, yes.
Unless you have SAGE_OCTAVE_COMMAND set.
Certainly if you have it set to octave it will do not what you want.
Unset it, then the tests should pass, I think.

Think again :


```
charpent@SAP5057241:~$ sage -sh

Starting subshell with Sage environment variables set.  Don't forget
to exit when you are done.  Beware:
 * Do not do anything with other copies of Sage on your system.
 * Do not use this for installing Sage packages using "sage -i" or for
   running "make" at Sage's root directory.  These should be done
   outside the Sage shell.

Bypassing shell configuration files...

Note: SAGE_ROOT=/usr/local/sage-7
(sage-sh) charpent@SAP5057241:~$ echo $SAGE_OCTAVE_COMMAND

(sage-sh) charpent@SAP5057241:~$ which octave
/usr/bin/octave
(sage-sh) charpent@SAP5057241:~$ octave

[ Octave starts its GUI. I exit from it]

(sage-sh) charpent@SAP5057241:~$ exit
exit
Exited Sage subshell.
charpent@SAP5057241:~$ echo $SAGE_OCTAVE_COMMAND

charpent@SAP5057241:~$
```


Ergo SAGE_OCTAVE_COMMAND is not set neither in the Sage shell neither out of it.

A "make ptestlong" on this machine FAILS with a timeout on ...doctest/external.py", leaving an unclosable octave gui (you have to kill -TERM it...). From my check of 7.4beta0 :


```
...
sage -t --long --warn-long 50.8 src/sage/doctest/external.py
    Timed out
**********************************************************************
...
**********************************************************************
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage -t --long --warn-long 50.8 src/sage/doctest/external.py  # Timed out
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Total time for all tests: 8702.9 seconds
    cpu time: 11743.1 seconds
    cumulative wall time: 14507.8 seconds
```


The octave documentation does not hint at any way of making the CLI interface the default (all it does provide is the --no-gui option and the octave-cli binary). Therefore, this fix is somewhat urgent for people having octave>4.0.0 installed...

> I have //**NOT**// pulled #21135 : my diff was against the current (pristine (unmodified)) 7.4beta1. My point was that a four-letters patch was enough to solve my current difficulty (i. e. breaking something that used to work), and that the other proposed modificatins (which aim at //enhancing// something that used to work) are a //**separate**// issue... 

My apologies, I thought you were saying that you tried this branch and it didn't work. I'm very stressed today, in a bad way...
