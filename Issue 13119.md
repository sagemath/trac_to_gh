The tests in sage/interfaces/matlab.py are somewhat inconsistent in how they indicate their "optionalness" right now.  Let's make that better, and consistent with the new way of doing it.  Also one or two of them are actually doable without Matlab!  So let's make that work, too.

Looks good to me. I couldn't run the optional tests (no matlab available). But since only comments have been changed there, I suppose test results will stay the same.
