We can discuss the names of the parameters.

The method needs to be cleaned, but I let that for other tickets.

In a future ticket we could allow a user to pass directly a string of commands to plantri as done in `graphs.nauty_geng`.

Moving this ticket to 9.4, as it seems unlikely that it will be merged in 9.3, which is in the release candidate stage
