Keywords: set, iterator

Implementation of a set (using the category framework) from a function that returns an iterator. Building a set directly from an iterator leads to the impossibility of pickling.

A previous implementation was CombinatorialClassFromIterator (in sage.combinat.combinat) which is now deprecated.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/12518

Hi,

I'm in trouble with two points:

1) What to do with the equality test when the set are both infinite ? (see in the patch the warning printing on stderr)

2) What is the good way to implement the decorator for a method ? The implementation for functions work quite well but in sage.misc.cachefunc the implementation for methods rather than functions seem more tricky.

Hey Vincent,

I also get the patchbot errors when running the patch in the combinat queue on 5.5.rc0. Also from a quick look-through the patch, there are a few things which I believe needs to be addressed:
- Documentation and tests for the deprecated functions in `combinat/combinat.py`
- An example in `iter_with_cache()`, I also don't quite understand the documentation.
- You'll need to add `iter_with_cache` and `set_from_iterator` to the documentation by adding/editing a `.rst` file (probably `misc.rst`).
- I prefer to see the reserved words in code blocks: ```None```, ```self```, ```True```, and ```False```
- Same for input parameters and private functions, even in private functions.
- I prefer to have as much linking as possible: ex. `:class:`EnumeratedSetFromIterator``
- Instead of
  {{{#!python
  if x is True:
  ...
  if x is False:
  ...
  }}}
  it is better to do
  {{{#!python
  if x:
  ...
  if not x:
  ...
  }}}
  in case `x` is not a boolean (ex. `x = 1`).

Thanks,

Travis

Hi Travis,

These functions were *only* in the sage-combinat queues and not inside Sage. So the deprecation is just intended for people from combinat who were using it (and I think that none of them uses it).

> - An example in `iter_with_cache()`, I also don't quite understand the documentation.

I will open (few days) a new ticket for a better implementation of iter_with_cache. There is a similar construction in lazy power series and I would like to merge both. The idea is to have a Python data structure that behave like a list but with possibly infinitely many entries.

> - I prefer to see the reserved words in code blocks: ```None```, ```self```, ```True```, and ```False```

Is there a difference for documentation ? I thought that code blocks open a new paragraph.

Thanks for careful reading, I will adress all remarks in a new patch.

Best,
Vincent

Since these functions are not in sage, its probably best to remove these functions from this patch and then put a second patch in the combinat queue deprecating these functions.

I should have called it (inline) code format, and it just changes the format in the output html.

Hi,

The error in patchbot comes from the lazy import of graphs (which does not support pickling). I modify a little bit the implementation to use the generic framework of lazy list (in #13778). In particular, there is no more iter_with_cache.

The following does not work

```
sage: from sage.sets.set_from_iterator import set_from_method
sage: class A:
...     a = 10
...     @set_from_method
...     def f(self):
...         return xsrange(self.a)
sage: a = A()
sage: a.f()             # works perfectly
{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ...}
sage: A.f(a)            # does not work at all
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: f() takes exactly 1 argument (2 given)
```


It causes many problems with element classes which are Cython classes.

I am on this. Sorry.
Vincent

Do you mean put the whole class DummyExampleForPicklingTest into the doctest ? If it is the case, I can not because pickling classes defined in an interactive console is not (easily) possible.

            sage: from sage.structure.misc import getattr_from_other_class
