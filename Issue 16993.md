I spent a few hours writing a pexpect interface to Julia.  There's no doctests, and I had to do some odd things to make it work well (e.g., using vt100 mode for the TERM so that errors get reported! actually making use of the control codes for much, much better synchronization; putting in a bunch of \n's to ensure that opening strings don't hang the interface).  I'm too busy to doctest this and "do everything right" for Sage, but maybe somebody else wants to.  I think there is potential value for some users in having a pexpect Julia interface in Sage, since it makes it possible to easily move (small) data back and forth between systems, compare algorithms implemented in both, etc.    As with all the other interfaces, something at the C library level can be much faster and more scalable... but *both* approaches have unique value (in my opinion).  

I'm attaching some code to this ticket, which I've GPL'd.

A little while ago I attempted to flesh this interface out more on the branch u/alexjbest/sage-julia https://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/log/?h=u/alexjbest/sage-julia if any of that stuff is useful (even just some of the tests) feel free to repurpose it.
