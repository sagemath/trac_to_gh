# Issue 5464: installing Sage should build the documentation

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: jhpalmieri

Original creation time: 2009-03-10 04:32:02

Assignee: mabshoff

If I download sage-3.4.rc1 and type 'make', the documentation does not get built.  This means that clicking "Help" in the notebook produces a page with dead links to the tutorial, etc.  Sage absolutely needs this documentation easily available.

This is a dupe of #5414 - even though the summary of that ticket doesn't make it obvious :(

Cheers,

(#5414 is also filed under "notebook" -- I checked "documentation" and "build" looking for this kind of thing before creating the ticket.)

Feel free to close this one.
