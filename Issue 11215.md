Apply to root repo, by the way.

Sorry for the patch bomb. I thought it would be a good idea to clean up the formatting, like consistently line-wrapping up to 76 characters. I can make another patch without the line re-wrapping noise if that is desirable.

Keshav, your changes look great, but I dumped a lot of crap on top of it...

No, the more formatting fixes the better. By all means, please don't hold back! :) I wonder why you're wrapping to 76 columns, though. I believe PEP 8 suggests 79 for code and 72 for documentation and other flowed text.

By the way, it's probably not technically allowed for you to review a patch you suggested...

Thanks for the encouragement! I'm new to Sage development (and open-source development, for that matter). :-) I'm not quite sure where the line is between "beneficial but massive cleanup that no one had bothered to do" versus "lots of differencing noise that makes patches hard to review." In other words, I couldn't decide whether my patch was "scope creeping" beyond the original intent of the ticket.

I knew about 79 characters for code, but I didn't know about 72 for documentation. I naively used the series of hyphens on line 12, which is 76 characters long, as my guide... I will come back with a new patch.

Oh, I thought my reviewing your original patch was considered reviewing. Does the concept of reviewing apply to whole tickets, rather than patches, in which case I obviously can't review myself? :-)

I applies to patches.  You can review Keshav's patch, and Keshav can review yours, for example.

does not depend on other patches

Welcome to the fold, then :) I'm certainly no policy maker around here, but I think people should feel free to roll up their sleeves and fix code without worrying about diff noise. We're using version control systems which should be able to handle that kind of stuff easily anyway, unlike a decade ago, say...

BTW, there was a discussion on sage-devel a little while back about people reviewing each other's patches: https://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-devel/3X3pxQTBMWQ/discussion

Whoops, didn't mean to add myself as a reviewer (yet) - are you done with your patch, or do you want to do something else? If you're done, mark the ticket as "needs review" so I can review it :) Looks good so far.

I actually read that discussion at that time, but I totally forgot about it!

Yikes! You're posting faster than I can hit that radio button. :-)
