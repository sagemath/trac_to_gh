# Issue 18831: AsymptoticRing: inversion

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/19068

Original creator: behackl

Original creation time: 2015-08-21 13:27:09

CC:  dkrenn

Keywords: gsoc15, asymptotics

This ticket implements the inversion (and division) of asymptotic expressions (elements of the AsymptoticRing, implemented in #17716).

This relies heavily on the expansion via geometric series. If the expansion of such a series does not stop (e.g. in the case `1/(1-x)`), the series has to be truncated with an O-Term.

3 reviewer commits. Please cross check. Fine otherwise. From my side a conditional positive review (once #17716 is positive this can be set to positive as well).

`@`Daniel: thank you for your review, I cross-checked your reviewer commits; LGTM. As soon as the dependencies are all positive (and after I've merged them into this branch) I'll set this to `positive_review`.

Please add a TODO: Once `L`-terms are implemented, this inversion here will give incorrect results.

[comment:6 Daniel], do you want to cross-check the merge and the adaptions?

Cross-checked...changes look good.

Why reinvent the coercion model? You don't need `__div__` and `_div_`, the class `MultiplicativeGroupElement` already implements that for you...

I will fix this in #18578.

Seems to be a forgotten `__div__`; we got rid of them in the other files of this folder, but it seems we've forgotten it in the term monoids.

Thank you.
