CC:  dkrenn

Keywords: gsoc15, asymptotics

This ticket implements the inversion (and division) of asymptotic expressions (elements of the AsymptoticRing, implemented in #17716).

This relies heavily on the expansion via geometric series. If the expansion of such a series does not stop (e.g. in the case `1/(1-x)`), the series has to be truncated with an O-Term.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/19068

Seems to be a forgotten `__div__`; we got rid of them in the other files of this folder, but it seems we've forgotten it in the term monoids.

Thank you.
