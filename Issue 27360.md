`igraph` doesn't build on some systems:

```
[igraph-0.7.1999] /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/4.9.3/../../../../x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/bin/ld: cannot find -lblas
[igraph-0.7.1999] /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/4.9.3/../../../../x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/bin/ld: cannot find -llapack
```


Ideally, it *should* use OpenBLAS but it doesn't. Note that linking against OpenBLAS should be done with `-lopenblas`, not `-lblas`.

in fact, it's entirely a bug introduced by me. The have very similar options
--with-glpk=external, --with-blas=external, meaning totally different things---cause they ship a version of glpk, but do not ship one for blas/lapack, which are actually optional.

So we should not link them at all (I won't try making an openblas version, I have no idea whether it's supported).

What about GLPK? If you want to use the GLPK in Sage, there should be a dependency on it.
