That's a good idea.  It should still be synced to our mirrors primarily, but having a canonical "original" URL (even if it's just an attachment to a trac ticket) would provide the primary source for a tarball independent of the mirrors.

Without this change, failed test assertions did not show enough useful information.
Now, of course, nothing fails, so these lines have no effect on the operation of sage_bootstrap.

If you want to test that this ticket works, may I suggest picking a package that needs upgrading anyway, and use the new upstream_url mechanism to do the upgrade.
