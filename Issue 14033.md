Keywords: coproduct, symmetric functions, antipode

The coalgebra and Hopf structure of the k-bounded quotient were not previously implemented.  Ticket #14161 adds a test for the  antipode in Hopf algebras which will require these methods.

This ticket may have an impact on #13991.  It will certainly add more tests to k_dual.py, but I hope changes to this file will improve performance rather than degrade it.

I just noticed that #13991 closed and this was a duplicate with #14228.  The changes that I make here will have to be made compatible.

This version applies on #14228 and cleans up the k_dual.py file a bit.

Hey Mike,

I've uploaded a review patch which does some tweaks to the doc. If you're happy with my changes, you can set this to positive review.

Best,

Travis

I completely forgot these tickets were here.  I changed a couple of words because I thought the comment in the documentation that I wrote was unclear.
