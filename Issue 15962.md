Looks good.  Just a few small comments (all about methods of the class `PowerSeries`):
- The examples block in `__hash__()` is not correctly indented.
- In `_cmp_c_impl()`, put single backquotes also around the "g" in "Magma would declare f and g unequal.`
- In `is_unit()` and several other methods below it, please try to split the first sentence(s) into two paragraphs so that the first one is just one line (or at most two lines) long.
- In `sqrt()` it might be slightly better to say "Return a square root of self."
Once you fixed these you can set it to positive review.
