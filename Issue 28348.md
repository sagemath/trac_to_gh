Apologies, I didn't realize `git trac create` forks from develop instead of the current branch.

EDIT: Also apologies that it is not compiling, "it was working fine yesterday" and I have no idea what Cython is trying to tell me.

EDIT2: it was unicode quotes in the citation of the paper, ~600 lines down

It is often better to avoid coercion (ie comparison, operation, etc of elements with distinct parents). For example
- `g**((q-1)/r) == 1` -> `(g**((q-1)/r)).is_one()`
- `A*G**lam != 1` -> `not (A*G**lam).is_one()`
- `J = 0` -> `J = K.zero()`

Thank you for the feedback!

I have now included the algorithm in the `INPUT`, `EXAMPLES` and `TEST` sections and I have attached my small benchmark script to this ticket.

I have also integrated your suggestions with regard to coercion, however since `J` is an exponent like `k` and `v`, I believe it should always be an integer and shouldn't be an element of `K`.

Lastly, I have expanded the algorithm to include the `self.is_one()` case.

Since AMM is actually slightly faster even at small moduli, it could also be made the default in general unless the multiplicative generator is available.

That said, I am not sure how to check whether the generator is available. There does seem to be some caching but I can't see a way to explicitly check it.

There is some caching

```
sage: R = Zmod(next_prime(2**10))
sage: r = R.multiplicative_generator()
sage: R.multiplicative_generator() is r
True
```

or finite fields

```
sage: R = GF(next_prime(2**10)**2)
sage: r = R.multiplicative_generator()
sage: R.multiplicative_generator() is r
True
```

The cache is implemented via the decorator ``@`cached_method`. To access the cache here is what could be done

```
gen = R.multiplictative_generator.cache
if gen is not None:
    # gen is the multiplicative generator
    ...
else:
    # do not trigger multiplicative generator computation
    ...
```


You should also check timings over very small moduli, e.g things like `GF(2^5)` or `GF(3^10)`.

I added a couple new tests to the benchmarks. Unless you want to set a threshold at something like 11 I don't think it is worth using Johnston for small values.

Whether a particular finite field is faster with Johnston or AMM seems to be fairly randomly distributed with AMM's advantage getting slightly larger as the fields order increases (goes up to 85% AMM better for orders below 10000).

I would suggest making the default simply depend on the availability of a cached multiplicative generator.
