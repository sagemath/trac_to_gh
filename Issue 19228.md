Any progress here?

Equality-comparison is afaik just fine, at the very least the stopgap should only warn if the return value is non-zero. Also, a more informative wording might be e.g.

Symbolic expression compare by the printing order, not by mathematical inequality

Instead of a stopgap please review #16397.
