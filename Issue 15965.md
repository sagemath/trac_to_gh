Pari has a numeric implementation:

```
? 1/agm(1,sqrt(2))
%1 = 0.83462684167407318628142973279904680900
```

but Wikipedia provides a closed form integral expression, and if we had the "complete elliptic integral of the first kind" this would be even simpler.

Do you mean [elliptic_kc](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/functions/sage/functions/special.html?highlight=elliptic_kc#sage.functions.special.EllipticKC)?  This is indeed in Maxima, though not yet a "Sage symbolic function".  See also [the symbolics page on Trac](http://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/symbolics/functions) where a few things about this are mentioned.
