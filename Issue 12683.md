Keywords: spkg GCC 4.7.0 C++ g++ log() math.h overloaded SunOS

This is a rather subtle issue, related to Solaris' headers, and the fact that GCC (4.7.0) now defines `__cplusplus` to `199711L`, while previous versions defined it to just `1`.

If `__cplusplus >= 199711L`, a lot of overloaded (originally C) functions like `div()` and `log()` get defined in the `std` namespace (if one includes `math.h`), e.g.

```c++
float std::log(float);             // logf() in C
double std::log(double);           // log() in C
long double std::log(long double); // logl() in C
```

which is correct in the first place, but on Solaris these also end up in the **global** namespace:

```c++
// /usr/include/math.h

...

#if __cplusplus >= 199711L
...
using std::log;
...
#endif

```


Now FLINTQS happens to call `log()` with an `unsigned long` (without a cast) in one place, and with the overloaded functions present as well, the call gets ambiguous.  The obvious, trivial fix is to just cast the argument to a `double`, such that `double log(double)` gets called (as before).




There's a lot wrong with the FLINTQS spkg, as I noted a couple of times before, but I won't address other issues *here*.  [The most important fact being that *a newer version* of Bill Hart's quadratic sieve is included in FLINT since a long time, but the FLINT spkg simply doesn't install it.  So the FLINTQS spkg is obsolete in whole, but we can't remove it until *someone*<sup>TM</sup> fixes the FLINT spkg to also install the QS program included in it.]

I just built GCC-4.7.1 (see #13150) on `mark` (Solaris SPARC) and then built this FLINTQS spkg with GCC-4.7.1 and it worked.  This was starting from sage-5.1.beta0.
