# Issue 12420: plot error for message for too large figsize

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: dkrenn

Assignee: jason, was

Keywords: plot, error, figsize


```
sage: show(stats.IntList((1,2,3,4)).plot(figsize=(1,328)))
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: width and height must each be below 32768
```

It seems that there is a scaling of the size by a factor 100. At least the error message should be altered to give the correct value.
