Keywords: maxima

I received an email from Pierre Arnoux saying that this is wrong:

```
sage: integrate (sqrt(1-4*sin(x)^2),x, algorithm='maxima')
-1/12*sin(3*x) + 1/4*sin(x)
```

Quoting what Pierre says: "*Ce qui est visiblement faux: il y a un point d'inflexion horizontal en 0 alors que la fonction à intégrer vaut 1 en 0, ça ne peut pas être une primitive. Est-ce que vous avez une idée de ce qui ne marche pas?*"

Other programs in Sage just can't solve this integral:

```
sage: integrate (sqrt(1-4*sin(x)^2),x, algorithm='fricas')  # installed with "sage -i fricas"
integral(sqrt(4*cos(x)^2 - 3), x)
sage: integrate (sqrt(1-4*sin(x)^2),x, algorithm='giac')
integrate(sqrt(-4*sin(x)^2 + 1), x)
sage: integrate (sqrt(1-4*sin(x)^2),x, algorithm='sympy')
....does not halt...
```

Here is how I would describe this bug in the integrate function.
(This can be turned into a doctest when this bug is resolved.)

```
sage: f(x) = sqrt(1-4*sin(x)^2)
sage: F(x) = integrate(f(x), x)
sage: F(x)
-1/12*sin(3*x) + 1/4*sin(x)
```

Comparing the derivative of F with f shows this is wrong.

```
sage: g(x) = diff(F(x), x)
sage: g(x)
-1/4*cos(3*x) + 1/4*cos(x)
sage: f(0), g(0)
(1, 0)
```

Looking at the plots of f and F also reveals an error:

```
sage: xr = (-0.4, 0.4)
sage: plot(f, xr, color='blue') + plot(F, xr, color='red')
```

Here, f (blue curve) is 1 at 0, so its primitive F (red curve)
should have slope 1 at 0, instead of 0.
