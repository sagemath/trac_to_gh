Orders in number fields are currently not unique parents:

```
sage: K.<i> = NumberField(x^2 + 1)
sage: OK = K.order(i)
sage: OK is loads(dumps(OK))
False
```

Also, maximality of orders is sometimes wrong:

```
sage: OK = K.maximal_order()
sage: (OK & OK).is_maximal()
False
sage: OK = K.maximal_order(2)
sage: OK == K.maximal_order()
True
sage: OK.is_maximal()
False
```
