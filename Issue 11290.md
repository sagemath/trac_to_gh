# Issue 11290: Improve @parallel documentation to give examples of functions with multiple arguments

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: niles

Original creation time: 2011-06-10 17:35:42

Assignee: mvngu

CC:  kcrisman

Keywords: @parallel documentation beginner

All of the examples for ``@`parallel` (even those mentioned on mailing lists) demonstrate using it with functions that take a single argument.  Figuring out the syntax for multiple-argument functions can be slightly non-obvious, so the documentation should be improved.

More details at this [asksage question](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/336/passing-multiple-variables-and-parallel).
