CC:  @tobiasdiez @trevorkarn @fchapoton

Document configuring each common IDE or text editor
for using and/or developing Sage.

- CodeMirror
- Emacs + sage-shell-mode
- JupyterLab text editor
- PyCharm
- Spyder
- vi / vim
- VSCode / vscodium

and maybe others.

What to document:

- setting up syntax highlighting for .sage files
- ways to make Sage execute fragments of code
- telling the editor or IDE to use Sage's Python

Maybe one ticket per IDE or text editor?

Existing material:

- some wiki pages
- some answers to questions, or discussions, on
  - Ask Sage
  - sage-devel
  - sage-support
  - Stack Overflow

Related:

- Syntax highlighting mode for Sage syntax,
  aware of the syntactic sugar Sage adds to Python syntax

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/30500

Maybe this is better done on the wiki, and the wiki should have
a summary page pointing to a page for each IDE or text editor.

Maybe the part about vim could mention `:set backupcopy=yes` (see #21739) to avoid issues with the attach command (well, it's in my vimrc since 2015, but I don't know if it is still needed).

-1 for wiki - it's unmaintainable

+1 for extending the developer documentation

I agree with this. There are too many moving targets to keep this in the regular documentation, and crowd-sourcing it on the wiki will allow more flexibility. Anyone who is familiar with a particular editor (even including ~~the losers~~ those who use vi instead of emacs) can chime in as needed.
