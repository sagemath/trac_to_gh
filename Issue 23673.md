# Issue 23673: RelativeNumberFieldHomset ignores "category" argument

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/23910

Original creator: jdemeyer

This causes for example

```
sage: K.<a,b> = NumberField([x^2+1, x^2+2])
sage: H = Hom(K,K)
sage: loads(dumps(H)) is H
False
```

I am pretty sure they are independent. LGTM.

It would be nice if `is_NumberFieldHomsetCodomain` took the category as an argument.  But I think that can wait until another ticket.
