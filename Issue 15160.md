For partitions with first part >123 the product of Schur functions has problems.

```
sage: s = SymmetricFunctions(QQ).s()
sage: s[121,1]*s[2,1] # ok
s[121, 2, 1, 1] + s[121, 2, 2] + s[121, 3, 1] + s[122, 1, 1, 1] + 2*s[122, 2, 1] + s[122, 3] + s[123, 1, 1] + s[123, 2]
sage: s[122,1]*s[2,1] # not ok
2*s[1]

This bug was reported to me by Mercedes Rosas.  I haven't experimented yet to identify the problem precisely.

Since the product of Schur functions is done with lrcalc (which may or may not be where the bug is) I included Anders Buch in the cc of the developers list (this is the 'report upstream').

One fix for this bug could be to switch the product from symmetrica to lrcalc since the problem seems to be within symmetrica:

```
sage: import sage.libs.lrcalc.lrcalc as lrcalc
sage: sage.libs.lrcalc.lrcalc.mult([122,1],[2,1])
{[122, 2, 1, 1]: 1,
 [122, 2, 2]: 1,
 [122, 3, 1]: 1,
 [123, 1, 1, 1]: 1,
 [123, 2, 1]: 2,
 [123, 3]: 1,
 [124, 1, 1]: 1,
 [124, 2]: 1}
```

lrcalc seems to have a known reported bug in #14625 (to my eye, significantly less serious).  Any advice?

I am not sure if "Developers acknowledge bug." is quite accurate, but will have to do for now.  Axel Kohnert has been seriously hurt and is unconscious.  Adalbert Kerber from Bayreuth acknowledged the bug report though.

I am posting here a patch to change the multiplication from symmetrica to lrcalc.  I don't consider it quite ready for review, but it seems to solve the problem.  As a happy side effect it also seems to have a serious speedup.


```
sage: s = SymmetricFunctions(QQ).s()
sage: P = list(reversed(range(1,8)))
sage: %time s(P)*s(P);
```

has a speedup from 169.30s to 27.75s running on sage cloud.

I don't see the fix for symmetrica.  There is clearly a bug there that one can recreate on their website.

The attached patch changes `_multiply` to `_multiply_basis` and then calls `lrcalc.mult`.  I believe that given what the former `_multiply` function did, it should have been a `_multiply_basis` all along.  I also added three doctests.

That does not mean that the bug in symmetrica should not be fixed.  The following command causes a `Segmentation fault`

```
sage: symmetrica.mult_schur_schur([125],[3])
```


My recommendation is to review this patch and move on to fixing the problems with lrcalc mentioned in #14625.  Anders Buch has a version 1.1.7 of lrcalc while the version in Sage now is 1.1.6.
