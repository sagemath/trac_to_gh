Adding beginner as the docs for the question at hand is fairly straight forward to write.

Attachment

I agree with what Nick Anderson said in the linked ML thread that the features are already documented, so I'm not sure what exactly should be done here.  The attached patch is my attempt at providing some pointers to the relevant functions in the main `IntegerRing_class` documentation.

Okayokay, makes sense `:-)`

I converted the .diff file to a git commit, and I set it to positive review.

Thanks !
