CC:  chaoxu yomcat rudi

In #19027 matroid union, sum, partition are implemented, but most are not made discoverable by end users. I propose the following two ways of doing that:

* add import statements to sage/matroids/advanced.py
* create a new "submenu" matroids.constructions (similar to matroids.named_matroids) for these and future other constructions. So we could do

```
sage: M = matroids.constructions.Union([M1, M2])
```

Let me suggest also the following standard syntax:


```
sage: M = M1.union(M2)
```


To do this, just create a `union` method for matroids. The benefits is that, after creating a matroid `M1`, the user can see all available features by typing `M1.<TAB>`.

I added a union method and it seems to work well enough. I wasn't able to get it to work with cython-- it kept giving me an error "Expected an identifier" when I defined the union method. I also unearthed some issues with the union method, but I can talk with Stefan about that later. For now, it's exposed.

Yes, I forgot the `self`.

The reason we need the `_union` method (Stefan helped me figure this out) is that "union" is a reserved keyword for Cython, so `cpdef union` gives the following error when compiling:


```
Error compiling Cython file:

    cpdef union(self, matroids):

So instead we make `def union` sanitize the input and pass it to `cpdef _union`.

You can also fool this with a list of empty matroids. I can make it take empty matroids out of the list, but we may be getting diminishing returns with the sanitizing.

Sorry, this was wrong. An error on my part.

I rewrote it to filter out empty matroids from a list. I also figured that the cost of adding an empty matroid to the list and then removing it was worth the simplicity of not performing the same check twice.

One last thing, we don't typically write error messages as full sentences:

```diff
-                    raise TypeError("Can only take the union with a "
-                                     + "matroid or list of matroids.")
+                    raise TypeError("can only take the union with a "
+                                     + "matroid or list of matroids")
```

Once you make that change and add your real name to the authors, you can set a positive review on my behalf.
