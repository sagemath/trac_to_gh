# Issue 15949: extend transducers.add to arbitrary input-length

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: dkrenn

Original creation time: 2014-04-18 09:53:39

CC:  cheuberg skropf

Keywords: finite state machine

At the moment

```
sage: T = transducers.add([0, 1])
```

creates a transducer, which adds the values of the input-pair. This should be extended to arbitrary tuple-lengths.

(This came up during the review of #16142.)

rewrote def to lambda; removed trac reference since this brings no additional information. Needs cross-review. The remaining patch is a positive_review from my side.
