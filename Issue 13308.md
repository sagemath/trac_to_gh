# Issue 13308: Docstring formatting in misc_c.pyx

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: fwclarke

Original creation time: 2012-09-20 13:06:26

Assignee: mvngu

Keywords: docstring format

sage/misc/misc_c.pyx needs some double colons and blank lines.  For example

```
sage: prod?
...
       EXAMPLES:
          sage: prod([1,2,34]) 68 sage: prod([2,3], 5) 30 sage:
          prod((1,2,3), 5) 30 sage: F = factor(-2006); F -1 * 2 * 17 * 59
          sage: prod(F) -2006
...
```

The patch should solve the problem.

`AUTHORS:` should be left as it was, see [http://sagemath.org/doc/developer/conventions.html#headings-of-sage-library-code-files](http://sagemath.org/doc/developer/conventions.html#headings-of-sage-library-code-files)
