# Issue 32359: % for Maxima not working

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/32596

Original creator: @ingodahn

Original creation time: 2021-09-30 10:26:18

Keywords: Maxima

I noted that SageCell with language Maxima recognizes the % symbol (regularly used in Maxima to re-use the previous result), but does not use it. Instead it prints it as  __SAGE_SYNCHRO_MARKER_... .

An example is available at https://dahn-research.eu/Experimental/Maxima.html

Andrey Novoseltsev commented on this issue:

''I think this is how Sage handles it, nothing [SageMathCell](SageMathCell) specific.
''

So I am submitting this here.
