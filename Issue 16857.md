CC:  @mmasdeu @williamstein

non-FLINT methods are seriously broken after #16803:

```
sage: a = zero_matrix(QQ,3)
sage: b = identity_matrix(QQ,3)
sage: a.minpoly()
x
sage: b.minpoly()
x - 1
sage: a.minpoly('y')
y - 1
```

Also, using linbox or iml and modifying a matrix leaks memory:

```
sage: v = vector([0]*1000)
sage: M = identity_matrix(ZZ,1000)
sage: while True:           
....:    _ = M._solve_right_nonsingular_square(v)
....:    M[0,0] = 1
....:    print get_memory_usage()
```

Also, use type `int` for `_hnf_mod()` (anything larger than `2^31-1` isn't supported anyway).
