Sage-combinat has been adding tutorials to their own [website](http://combinat.sagemath.org/doc/thematic_tutorials/index-sage-combinat.html#thematic-tutorials-sage-combinat) for quite some time.  Others should know how to do this more easily from worksheets.

This is also an opportunity to continue the process of reorganization started in #17112 and continued in #17255.

Okay, this seems fine and (as expected) doc builds correctly, though I'm surprised you put the manuals earlier.  I wish there was a way to indicate that the coding details included how to interface with libraries, but that would be such a long title.

I disagree (not strongly). I don't like to add documentation explicitly refering to something which is known to be broken. Let me also add that I didn't intentionally look for bugs in `sws2rst`. I just tried the instructions, happened to store the `.sws` file in `/tmp` and got in trouble. Together with the fact that #17308 likely has an easy fix, I think we should wait for #17308.
