# Issue 17028: Add info on making tutorials

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: kcrisman

Original creation time: 2014-10-31 01:29:21

Sage-combinat has been adding tutorials to their own [website](http://combinat.sagemath.org/doc/thematic_tutorials/index-sage-combinat.html#thematic-tutorials-sage-combinat) for quite some time.  Others should know how to do this more easily from worksheets.

This is also an opportunity to continue the process of reorganization started in #17112 and continued in #17255.

"Advanced Sage Coding Details": I don't like the word "advanced". Perhaps "Further Sage Coding Details"?

Feel free to come up with a better suggestion, I figured this one wouldn't be very good.  I tried about five different ideas before settling on this one as the least bad of them.  What I really wanted was "Language-specific coding details that you might not have thought were important but will really bite you if you don't read them, plus some stuff about C libraries", but that seemed a bit too long.

Just to clarify, I mean "feel free to come up with a better suggestion than mine".   I'm not 100% sold on your first try, but I could be...

Okay, this seems fine and (as expected) doc builds correctly, though I'm surprised you put the manuals earlier.  I wish there was a way to indicate that the coding details included how to interface with libraries, but that would be such a long title.

Since you're the reviewer, you can be the one to set the review status, but I'm happy with this.

By which I mean if the only objection you had was that, we're good to go - I didn't know if you had any other questions.

I tried to follow the instructions on how to make a tutorial and they simply don't work for me:

```
(sage-sh) jdemeyer`@`tamiyo:tmp$ ls -l Tutorial.sws 
-rw-r--r-- 1 jdemeyer jdemeyer 204897 Nov  8 10:50 Tutorial.sws
(sage-sh) jdemeyer`@`tamiyo:tmp$ sage --sws2rst Tutorial.sws 
Processing Tutorial.sws
Unable to process file ('Tutorial.sws')
Error message: [Errno 20] Not a directory: '/tmp/Tutorial.sws/sage_worksheet'
Exiting.
```

I separated the "reorganize the index" part as a new ticket (with positive review!) #17307.

I think the part about using `--sws2rst` should only be added to the manual if it works properly, see #17308.

Your two commits are fine (assuming they look okay built, but I'm not going to check that now).  I will think about #17308 and whether that should be a dependency or not over the weekend.  On the face of it, I'd rather document what _not_ to do now and have that ticket be separate.

They only additional thing I find wrong about this is that I/we need to be more explicit about adding one's file to `index.rst`.

To me, the issue of a small bug in `sage -sws2rst` is nearly orthogonal to adding this information.   If you strongly disagree, luckily I have two alternate fixes you can try out for #17308 - let me know.

I disagree (not strongly). I don't like to add documentation explicitly refering to something which is known to be broken. Let me also add that I didn't intentionally look for bugs in `sws2rst`. I just tried the instructions, happened to store the `.sws` file in `/tmp` and got in trouble. Together with the fact that #17308 likely has an easy fix, I think we should wait for #17308.

Comment by kcrisman created at 2014-11-14 17:41:33

Anything else to do here now that #17308 is green?


---

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2014-11-14 17:49:51

Yes, I need to explicitly test these instructions.


---

Comment by kcrisman created at 2014-11-14 18:18:06

Okay.

`sphinx-build` doesn't work for me:

```
(sage-sh) jdemeyer`@`tamiyo:make_tutorial$ make html
sphinx-build -b html -d _build/doctrees   . _build/html
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/local/src/sage-git/local/bin/sphinx-build", line 5, in <module>
    from pkg_resources import load_entry_point
  File "build/bdist.linux-x86_64/egg/pkg_resources.py", line 2817, in <module>
  File "build/bdist.linux-x86_64/egg/pkg_resources.py", line 451, in _build_master

  File "build/bdist.linux-x86_64/egg/pkg_resources.py", line 639, in resolve
pkg_resources.DistributionNotFound: Sphinx==1.1.2
make: *** [html] Error 1
```


I have no idea why the wrong version (1.1.2 vs. 1.2.2) is in that file, reinstalling Sphinx doesn't help.

Your documentation patch is good.  I think this didn't get noticed until the Sphinx upgrade #16396 because we had been using previous betas or versions.  Another good reason for those to be in "Merged in"!

Sweet, thanks.  Hopefully people will actually use this now.
