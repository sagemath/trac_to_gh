CVXOPTBackend forgets to set its initial problem_name, and as a result the `MixedIntegerLinearProgram` cannot print itself.

```
sage: p = MixedIntegerLinearProgram(solver="CVXOPT")
sage: p
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
...
TypeError: cannot concatenate 'str' and 'NoneType' objects
<repr(<sage.numerical.mip.MixedIntegerLinearProgram at 0x190970a70>) failed: TypeError: cannot concatenate 'str' and 'NoneType' objects>
```

Can we have a doctest showing that this fixes the error in the ticket description?
