I did some small formating fixes, and I found this error:



```
sage: W = CoxeterGroup(["A",3])
sage: c = W.from_reduced_word([1,2,3])
sage: l = [w for w in W if w.is_coxeter_sortable(c)]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

   2065                 else:

   2067                 i += 1
   2068                 if i == n:

```
