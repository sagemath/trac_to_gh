# Issue 471: requested features for trac

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/471

Hello,

Trac Mercurial plugin -  see http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/TracMercurial
Add to Ticket Properties - Component: 
 - Misc
 - Documentation

It would also be nice if trac could send an email to sage-devel if a ticket were added, but that might cause too much traffic. As an alternative we might install an RSS plugin.

Cheers,

Michael

Changing type from defect to task.

One correction: Martin Albrecht did inform me that there already is a RSS feed. Still, Firefox 2.0 doesn't pick it up (at least for me).

And another problem: Attached Postscipt files are displayed as raw test. Is this a config or a general Trac issue.

Cheers,

Michael

Arrg, 1 second after I hit enter I saw the RSS link on the bottom of the page. Time to make tickets editable. Better luck next time.

Cheers,

Michael

Nope, most of this is fixed and since it is vague as is I am closing this as fixed.

Cheers,

Michael
