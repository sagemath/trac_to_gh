Could you replace `w_func` by `weight_function` in

```
         if algorithm == 'DHV':
+            by_weight, w_func = self._get_weight_function(by_weight=by_weight,
+                                                          weight_function=weight_function,
+                                                          check_weight=check_weight)

I had to find a name... it can be changed for something shorter, but only after we are done with the cleaning of the usage of weights in the graph module (#13112).
