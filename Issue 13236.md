Compilation of Sage-5.2 fails with an error inside the atlas-3.8.4 package.
However the latest atlas-3.10.0  version compiles fine. 
I therefore propose that the package be updated to the latest release for the next release of sage.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/13408

My sense is that this is a dup of #10508.  Can you try the spkg posted there?

The buildbot machine "rosemary" has RHEL 5.8 (the problematic version according to the `sage-devel` post), but `atlas-3.8.4` builds fine on that machine.  Skynet machine `cleo` also has RHEL IIRC but it's unaccessible now.

I have no idea.  The original poster is unresponsive, so it's hard to find out.  Since the problem is fixed by upstream atlas-3.10.0, let's assume #10508 also fixes it.
