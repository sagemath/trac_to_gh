I have a better idea: Let's just leave it for now and I can finish it in a follow-up.  As far as I'm concerned it fixes the overall issue; it just needed some additional work.

I'm still confused as to how/why it was merged at all.

Well, as soon as a ticket is positively reviewed, and it was in this state for a couple of days, Volker may grab it and merge it....

Is there something that remains to be done, or has it been fixed in the meantime?

Changing status from new to needs_info.

I don't understand the state of #27642. It is maked as fixed, but the branch is still there.

There seem to be no code changes on the attached branch at #27642, i.e. whatever is there has been merged by now. It could be reverted, but I have no idea why.

The branch of #27642 has been merged in some (probably, forced) way. So all of it is in, no worries.
