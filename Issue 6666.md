I'm not disputing your changes to the whitespace here, but note that PEP 8 does not say that there should be spaces around *all* operators, only the relational ones.  From https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/:

>> If operators with different priorities are used, consider adding whitespace around the operators with the lowest priority(ies). Use your own judgment; however, never use more than one space, and always have the same amount of whitespace on both sides of a binary operator.
>> Yes:
>> {{{
>> i = i + 1
>> submitted += 1
>> x = x*2 - 1
>> hypot2 = x*x + y*y
>> c = (a+b) * (a-b)
>> }}}
>> No:
>> {{{
>> i=i+1
>> submitted +=1
>> x = x * 2 - 1
>> hypot2 = x * x + y * y
>> c = (a + b) * (a - b)
>> }}}
Actually, in the case of `c = ...`, I would personally prefer the "no" option or even `(a + b)*(a - b)`, which is closer to standard mathematical typesetting, but in any case this is a matter of taste.
