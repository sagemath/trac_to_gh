After building and running many versions of Sage, my `.sage` directory is littered with files with names like

```
_Applications_sage_builds_sage-5.0.beta7-gcc_devel_sage-main-lazy_import_cache.pickle
```

We should instead store these in a subdirectory of `.sage`. The attached patch makes this change.

Hi John,

I noticed the same for me. Thanks for tacking care of that. By the way, in my `.sage` the mentioned file are all only 6 bytes long which seems to be rather small for a cache. Is it normal ? Is the cache actually working ?

Hi Florent,

My files are only 6 bytes long, too. I don't know anything about the actual code involved in the caches, so I don't know if they're working. (I think they may be the first step toward something more significant, but I'm not sure.)  In any case, it's certainly ridiculous to have files with ugly names over 80 characters long, especially if they only contain 6 bytes, stored in a semi-public place.
