The default range for `polar_plot` should be [0, 2*pi]. As of now it's something like [-pi/3, pi/3] (not sure of the exact range), which produces probably undesired results for most plots. [0, 2*pi] would be better since plotting a function over a full circle seems to be the most common use (almost all the examples in the documentation use this range, in fact).
