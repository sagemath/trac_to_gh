# Issue 4663: prune module_list.py of dead extensions

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/4663

Original creator: mabshoff

Original creation time: 2008-11-30 09:34:39

Assignee: craigcitro

After the cleanup from #4661 there are still various commented out Extensions in module_list. While some of those will come in potentially useful audit the files and remove potentially dead and terrible code while keeping around the good bits for resurrection. 

Cheers,

Michael
