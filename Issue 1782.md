Keywords: test doctest multi polynomial ideal reporducible

In multi_polynomial_ideal.py, the doctests for

 * complete_primary_decomposition
 * groebner_basis
 * primary_decomposition

work under `sage -t` but do not work from the `sage:` prompt.  Presumably there is some singular initialization that is not being reproduced at the prompt?

Changing keywords from "test doctest multi polynomial ideal reporducible" to "test doctest multi polynomial ideal reproducible".

This should be fixed since we compute reduced Gr√∂bner bases by default.

Nick, as you reported the bug: I claim this is fixed. Could you check?

This issue is resolved, I just checked and I can reproduce all doctests. Someone not me please close this ticket :-)
