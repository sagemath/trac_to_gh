Keywords: test doctest multi polynomial ideal reporducible

In multi_polynomial_ideal.py, the doctests for

* complete_primary_decomposition
* groebner_basis
* primary_decomposition

work under `sage -t` but do not work from the `sage:` prompt.  Presumably there is some singular initialization that is not being reproduced at the prompt?

This should be fixed since we compute reduced Gr√∂bner bases by default.
