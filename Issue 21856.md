Thanks! It works.

(I changed to critical since it is an optional package)

Optional packages aren't really blocker material... Also, I can't even tell what this fixes; No ticket description, no added test. I'm sure you know what you are doing but we shouldn't rush this in.

Replying to [comment:5 vbraun]:
> Optional packages aren't really blocker material...

Is this your personal opinion? The (optional) testsuite is broken.

> Also, I can't even tell what this fixes; No ticket description, no added test. I'm sure you know what you are doing but we shouldn't rush this in.

Without the patch, some doctests *do* fail.

Moreover, the precise list of what is failing is given in the sage-devel thread mentioned in the ticket description.
