Given an elliptic curve E the method E.simon_two_descent() returns an ordered triple. This consists of a lower bound on the Mordell-Weil rank of E, an integer which is supposed to be the F_2 dimension of the 2-Selmer group of E, and list of points, generating the part of the Mordell-Weil group that has been found.

Sometimes the second entry is larger than the actual 2-Selmer rank as computed by mwrank, and predicted by BSD. The first curve I know of for which this happens is the elliptic curve '438e1' from Cremona's tables.

This curve definitely possesses 2-covers which are everywhere locally soluble EXCEPT at that infinite place. These probably explain the discrepancy.

This is a bug in Simon's script indeed. I have emailed him about this one, too, as it happens with the later version of his file in gp, too.

That is indeed bad. The fomula (after the first descent) is indeed

 dim Sel_phi + dim Sel_phihat + dim E[2] - 2 .

this is a upper bound to dim Sel_2 and they have the same parity. But they need not be equal as the second descent in mwrank finds. The difference is a subquotient of Sha(E').

Conclusion: The output of Simon's algorithm is an upper bound on the 2-Selmer group, which is correct in parity, but not necessarily equal.

In propose that we change the documentation, for I don't image that Simon's script could give back to full answer - though I have not looked at it.

There are a few other improvements to the docstring.  In particular, it contained several calls to `set_random_seed()`.  These can't have any effect, because Simon's script runs inside a separate GP interpreter with its own random state, so I removed these.
