In `sage.tensor.modules.comp.CompWithSym`, the method generating non-redundant indices is implemented very inefficiently by going through all indices and throwing away the redundant ones. In the worst case scenario of a rank n tensor in n dimensions, we have to iterate through n<sup>n</sup> indices only to find the single non-redundant one.

This ticket fixes this by changing the implementation to directly generate only non-redundant indices. This gives for example the following improvement for 7 dimensions:

```
sage: import timeit
sage: from sage.tensor.modules.comp import Components, CompWithSym, CompFullySym, CompFullyAntiSym
sage: V = VectorSpace(QQ, 7)
sage: c = CompFullyAntiSym(QQ, V.basis(), 7)
sage: timeit.timeit(lambda:list(c.non_redundant_index_generator()),number=1)

new implementation:
4.3510999603313394e-05

old implementation:
2.4149506480007403
```

I also simplified the method generating redundant indices a bit.

Haven't checked the algorithm yet, but here are already some minor comments:

Is that really important? The order in which the components of tensors are displayed is a matter of personal taste, the mathematical results are the same anyway. Generating the indices in exactly the same order as we did previously would make the algorithm significantly more complicated.

You could of course just convert all of the indices into a list and sort that one via `list(tensor.non_redundant_index_generator()).sort()`. This is a bit inefficient but for display purposes, this should be fine.

I agree with Eric. Ordering the indices by coordinates is extremely convenient, at least for the output.

Since this seems only affect the Christoffel symbols, I can live with sorting them afterwards, even for the price of a small slow down in that case (which, I suspect, is still faster than the current implementation).

On the other hand, please keep in mind that there is a refactoring of the components's module going on in #30307. To that end, we will cache results related to symmetry such as this iterator.

Minor comments, feel free to ignore any or all of them.

Possible simplification for getting a sorted list:

```diff
-            generator = list(self.non_redundant_index_generator())
-            generator.sort()
+            generator = sorted(self.non_redundant_index_generator())
```

PEP8 recommends 2 spaces before inline comments
(and some suggested rephrasings):

```diff
-                    return # end point reached
+                    return  # end point reached
```

```diff
-        sym = self._sym.copy() # we may modify this in the following
+        sym = self._sym.copy()  # make a copy we can modify
```

```diff
-            step_finished = False # each step generates a new index
+            step_finished = False  # each step generates a new index
```

```diff
+                    return # end point reach
+                    return  # end point reached
```

Longer comments can go on their own line(s)
(and sometimes be made a bit shorter):

```diff
-                sym.append([pos]) # treat non-symmetrized indices as being symmetrized with themselves
+                # treat non-symmetrized indices as symmetrized with themselves
+                sym.append([pos])
```

```diff
-                    return # we went through all indices and didn't
-                           # find one which we can increase, thus we
-                           # have generated all indices
+                    # we went through all indices and none could be
+                    # increased, so we have generated all indices
+                    return
```

The following give the same boolean:

- `not any([a in b for b in c]) and not any([a in b for b in d])`
- `all(a not in b for e in (c, d) for b in e)`

so one could rewrite:

```diff
-            if not any([pos in isym for isym in sym]) and not any([pos in isym for isym in antisym]):
+            if all(pos not in isym for xsym in (sym, antisym) for isym in xsym):
```

Calling the flag `done` rather than `step_finished`,
one would read: `if not done: ...`.

Possible rewriting given how Python
turns numbers and lists to booleans:

```diff
-                if not step_finished and i == 0 and len(antisym) == 0:
+                if not step_finished and not i and not antisym:
```

Maybe shorten this comment:

```diff
-                            # this index is at the maximum and we have
-                            # to reset it
+                            # this index is at the maximum; reset it
```

Maybe add spaces around + and -, and after commas,
in several instances of:

```diff
- range(len(sym)-1,-1,-1)
+ range(len(sym) - 1, -1, -1)
```

I ponder, is the outer while-loop even necessary? Couldn't you just split this whole thing into two separated loops and `yield` within those? Then the code gets much simpler and the flag becomes obsolete.

Personally, I don't agree with that one. Of course, `not i` is more pythonic, but I find it less readable than `i == 0`, especially in the current context, where `i` is an integer.
