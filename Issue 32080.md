There are a few unnecessary matrices created in the `FiniteDimensionalModulesWithBasis.annihilator_basis()` method. This streamlines them leading to a significant improvement in performance.

Doctests are failing because you have changed how the matrix augmentation works:

```
sage -t --long --random-seed=0 src/sage/categories/finite_dimensional_lie_algebras_with_basis.py  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t --long --random-seed=0 src/sage/categories/finite_dimensional_algebras_with_basis.py  # 4 doctests failed
sage -t --long --random-seed=0 src/sage/categories/finite_dimensional_modules_with_basis.py  # 12 doctests failed
```


```
sage: matrix([[1,2],[3,4]]).augment(matrix([vector([5,6]), vector([7,8])]))
[1 2 5 6]
[3 4 7 8]
sage: matrix([[1,2],[3,4]]).augment(vector([5,6])).augment(vector([7,8]))
[1 2 5 7]
[3 4 6 8]
```

Actually, each time you augment with a vector, it is actually creating a matrix:

```
sage: vector([1,2]).column()  # called in augment
[1]
[2]
sage: type(_)
<class 'sage.matrix.matrix_integer_dense.Matrix_integer_dense'>
```

It also creates a lot more transient objects. So this really should not be faster (although I don't think you can get around the bug. I also cannot reproduce your timings. Your branch:

```
sage: F = FiniteDimensionalAlgebrasWithBasis(QQ).example()

CPU times: user 56.2 ms, sys: 4.28 ms, total: 60.5 ms
Wall time: 59.8 ms

```

Previous code:

```
CPU times: user 23.2 ms, sys: 0 ns, total: 23.2 ms
Wall time: 33.2 ms
(y, a, b)
```

Although I get quite a bit of variation in these timings, so it isn't so definitive. Yet it nothing on the order of magnitude difference in comment:1.

Potentially a way to improve the speed is just create one big matrix in one go, and maybe also get rid of the extra function calls with `side='right'`...
