As observed in #29104, Singular's configure may fail to find NTL even if Sage finds a system NTL. It continues to build, but the result is broken.

The details:

NTL's `spkg-configure.m4` (from #27265/#27822) uses `AC_CHECK_HEADER`/`AC_LINK_IFELSE`/`AC_RUN_IFELSE` and therefore is able to find NTL in an environment where the user has set CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS accordingly.
In that case, it sets `AC_SUBST(SAGE_NTL_PREFIX, [''])`

Then `build/bin/sage-build-env-config.in` does:

```
# This is usually blank if the system NTL is used, or $SAGE_LOCAL otherwise
export SAGE_NTL_PREFIX="@SAGE_NTL_PREFIX@"
if [ -n "$SAGE_NTL_PREFIX" ]; then
    # Many packages that depend on NTL accept a --with-ntl=<prefix> flag to
    # their ./configure scripts.  When using the system's NTL this is not
    # generally necessary, but when using the NTL package installed in
    # SAGE_LOCAL it is useful to pass it.
    export SAGE_CONFIGURE_NTL="--with-ntl=$SAGE_NTL_PREFIX"
fi
```


But Singular's `configure` (via its `m4/ntl-check.m4`) insists to find the headers in `NTL_HOME_PATH`, which defaults to `DEFAULT_CHECKING_PATH="/usr /usr/local /sw /opt/local"`, which can of course be quite wrong.

We should always provide the --with-ntl=PREFIX option to Singular -- and make it an error if Singular's configure cannot find NTL.

The fix on this ticket works (see #29104 / https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/508693083) - but it turns out that homebrew's NTL is not suitable:

```
  [singular-4.1.1p2.p0]   ld: illegal thread local variable reference to regular symbol __ZN3NTL13ErrorCallbackE for architecture x86_64
  [singular-4.1.1p2.p0]   clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)
  [singular-4.1.1p2.p0]   make[8]: *** [libSingular.la] Error 1
```

This is something that our `ntl/spkg-configure.m4` should be checking. (This is #29339.)

what's going on in `./configure` with NTL headers? Why is it there, and not in the corresponding `spkg-configure.m4` ?

But we can, as we call AC_CHECK_HEADER, and it sets `ac_cv_header_`<header-file>
so we can easily store it somewhere.
