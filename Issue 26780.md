# Issue 26780: Remove sage.schemes.elliptic_curves.padics from documentation

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27017

Original creator: jdemeyer

Original creation time: 2019-01-04 11:56:04

CC:  klee

The file `src/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/padics.py` contains only methods which are imported in `src/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_rational_field.py`

So there is no reason for this module to be documented.
