I'm pretty sure it should be `get_unicode`, not `get` here:
https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/6.9.beta6/src/sage/repl/rich_output/backend_ipython.py#L518

And while we are at it - how Unicode should be handled for HTML, i.e. should it be `rich_output.html.get_unicode()` for consistency?

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/19186
