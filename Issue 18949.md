I'm pretty sure it should be `get_unicode`, not `get` here:
https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/6.9.beta6/src/sage/repl/rich_output/backend_ipython.py#L518

And while we are at it - how Unicode should be handled for HTML, i.e. should it be `rich_output.html.get_unicode()` for consistency?

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/19186

Ping indeed: what behaviour is affected by this change? I suspect that we just don't have tests where unicode or not matters. Also, should it be `get_unicode` for html as mentioned in the description?

I think there is some clean up to be done, more than the attached branch, but I don't understand what's going on well enough to do it properly. Presumably switching to Python 3 can make some difference and expose bugs if there are indeed any.
