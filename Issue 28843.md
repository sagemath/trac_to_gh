# Issue 28843: Degenerate Metric Submanifold: New features

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29080

Original creator: Dicolevrai

Original creation time: 2020-01-25 17:22:13

CC:  egourgoulhon

Keywords: Degenerate Metric Manifold

We add some new methods in the class `DegenerateSubmanifold` such as `list_of_screens` which returns the list of screens already set on the null submanifold. We also resolve a problem that was not allowed the definition of a second screen distribution.

The changes look good to me. 
In the above commit, I've only performed some small tweaks. In particular, I've removed the `OUTPUT` section in the documentation of the class `Screen` (class docstrings shall only have an `INPUT` section, which describes the input of the class `__init__()` method). Let us wait for the patchbot report...

Well, it seems that the patchbot does not want to visit this ticket...
Since all tests are passed on my machine and the doc builds successfully, I am setting the ticket to positive review.
