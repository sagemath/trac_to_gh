Keywords: Degenerate Metric Manifold

We add some new methods in the class `DegenerateSubmanifold` such as `list_of_screens` which returns the list of screens already set on the null submanifold. We also resolve a problem that was not allowed the definition of a second screen distribution. 

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29080
