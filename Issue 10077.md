Sage coding convention encourages to use ".. WARNING::" rather than ".. warning::", however, using search_src shows the converse is done :


```
sage: len(search_src(".. warning::", interact=False).splitlines())
209
sage: len(search_src(".. WARNING::", interact=False).splitlines())
34
```

I guess we could just have ".. examples::" print "EXAMPLES:", and similarly for ".. tests::" and that would be the end of it.  On the other hand, if we could actually have these directives include all of the examples and interspersed text, then we could, for example, decide to omit the tests by passing a command-line option when building the docs.

I'm fine with using either the lower- or upper-case version. I see your argument about sticking to Sphinx's convention on using lower-case for directives. The relevant sections of the Developer's Guide need to be changed to mention that Sphinx's lower-case convention is preferred. And a note saying that Sphinx also accepts the upper-case version.
