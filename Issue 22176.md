I read through the diffs and all looks good.  Because of the removal of deprecated functions, I think I had better actually run some tests too...

OK -- I only tested the elliptic_curves directory which will not take long (many cores): tests pass.  

You can give yourself a positive review when your own tests finish successfully.
