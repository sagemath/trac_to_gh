Hey Travis,

Thanks for doing this!  I made a bunch of documentation fixes and improvements.  Also, I changed `._monomial`, `.get_monomials`, and `.set_monomials` to `_.variable`, `.get_variables`, and `.set_variables`, respectively.  If you agree with these changes, then it can get a positive review from me.
