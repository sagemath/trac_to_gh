With the changes on #18453, computing the weight of an element of the monomial crystals has become slow. This ticket aims to speed it up and do some other miscellaneous cleanups.

I am recycling this ticket because I couldn't improve the weight function.

Variant which uses an instance option rather than global option for setting the display output.

Hey Travis,

Thanks for doing this!  I made a bunch of documentation fixes and improvements.  Also, I changed `._monomial`, `.get_monomials`, and `.set_monomials` to `_.variable`, `.get_variables`, and `.set_variables`, respectively.  If you agree with these changes, then it can get a positive review from me.

I noticed that we aren't properly using the `use_Y`, and I fixed that on my last commit. I'm okay with your changes. So if you agree with mine, then it is a positive review.
