The description should be correct now. The names are chosen quite general. Still, I feel not comfortable reviewing my own modifications.

If you could grab a geometer, it would be certainly nice. But I think this is not necessary. I could ask my supervisor next week and modify the documentation at some later point if necessary. 

However, the term 'genus' is certainly wrong and it would be nice not having this into the final Sage version.
