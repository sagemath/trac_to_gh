We are at beta9 already. Still, is it likely to have this change in Sage9?

I don't feel qualified enough to be able to answer this as it is not my area of expertise. I might be able to grab a geometer to check it, but I cannot promise that. I can say at least the changes are code-wise correct.

Eric, this is essentially a trivial ticket, can you quickly check it?

The description should be correct now. The names are chosen quite general. Still, I feel not comfortable reviewing my own modifications.

If you could grab a geometer, it would be certainly nice. But I think this is not necessary. I could ask my supervisor next week and modify the documentation at some later point if necessary. 

However, the term 'genus' is certainly wrong and it would be nice not having this into the final Sage version.

the change in documentation looks ok to me. This should be done in the new version of sage.

Sorry for the delay in replying. I was not aware of this ticket, due to the mispelling of my username in the CC. Besides, when you open such ticket, please add it to the metaticket #18528 to increase its visibility.

Yes, it is okay for me. I am setting the ticket back to positive review.
