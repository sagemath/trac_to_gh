#27218 broke gap_packages on OSX. Here is the fix

sdh_install does "cp -R", which on OSX copies the contents of the 1st argument if it ends with '/', dropping everything before the last '/'. This broke gap_packages on OSX

Thanks, I hate it (the problem, not your fix :)

Perhaps `sdh_install` should be modified to strip trailing slashes from its arguments, since in general this behavior is not as intended (it is supposed to work that way only if the `-T` flag is given).

I'll open a new ticket for this; in the meantime let's go ahead and use this temporary workaround.
