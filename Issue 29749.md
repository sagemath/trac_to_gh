Merge conflict.

I also need to go through it again and check I respected the design decision in #29935.

It appears that without a solution to #29954, this task might be infeasible (unless you want to mark every single doctest counting the graphic primitives as known bug).

This can be closed as a duplicate of #30176, because commit 73af14a of that ticket adjusted the tolerance of these two doctests. I tried a dozen different seeds and didn't get any doctest failures in the plot directory.
