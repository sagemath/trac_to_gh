Still need to add references for Lorentzian polynomials and M-convex sets to documentation and the Sage master bibliography, but otherwise the code seems to be working well here.  Will finalize this and set the ticket to Needs Review tonight or tomorrow.

I just pushed a new branch to this ticket which rebases the changes on 9.1.beta9.  There are no significant changes to the code content, so it should be ready for review again.

Batch modifying tickets that will likely not be ready for 9.1, based on a review of the ticket title, branch/review status, and last modification date.

* do not use latex syntax in the reference file, just plain unicode accents

* why all these changes to quadratic forms ?


---

Comment by chapoton created at 2020-04-19 09:04:28

More work needed, besides my previous comment:18

- INPUTS: should always be INPUT:

- EXAMPLES: should be EXAMPLES:: when directly followed by doctests

- the correct syntax when calling references is `[Guy2019]_` with a final underscore

Sounds great, I'll give the branch a pass soon to fix the issues you mentioned.

Replying to [comment:18 chapoton]:
> * why all these changes to quadratic forms ?

The test for Lorentzian polynomials implemented in this ticket uses quadratic forms associated with homogeneous quadratic polynomials.  However, there is currently no built-in constructor for Sage's quadratic forms using this input, so we added another case to `QuadraticForm.__init__` to detect polynomials of this type.  Let me know if you think this should be handled in a different way.

Just fixed the formatting issues mentioned in comments [comment:18 18] and [comment:19 19].  Should be ready for review again.

The new references have arxiv links, which is good.
Both have since appeared:

- https://zbmath.org/?q=an%3A1454.52013
- https://zbmath.org/?q=an%3A7542930

so journal references have been added.

There are still some doctest errors.

Comment by slelievre created at 2022-08-24 19:43:40

The method was broken for the case of one-variable "multivariate"
polynomials, since the multivariate implementation assumed that
multivariate polynomials were on more than one variable.

This was revealed by testing after the refactoring in commit d412a84
that replaced the specific implementation for univariate polynomials
by a call to the multivariate method instead.

I'm happy with the state of this ticket. Please review my changes.

somebody among the many authors should stand up and fix the 3 (easy?) failing doctests

anyone interested ? This is ready for review, but it seems that the authors are not listening.
