Assignee: sage-combinat

CC:  sage-combinat darijgrinberg@gmail.com

Keywords: poset, combinat

This should return True:

```
sage: P = Poset(([1,2,3,4],[[1,4],[2,3],[3,4]]), facade = True)
sage: P.is_graded()
False
```


Anne's suggestion from this [thread](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-combinat-devel/XsMrxKdvl1A/discussion) on sage-combinat-devel:

    For a finite poset perhaps the easiest would be to

- start with a random element in the poset, assign rank 0
- look at all covers and cocovers and assign the rank according to the recurrence rank(x) = rank(y) + 1 if x covers y.
- repeat with the new elements
- if at any point an element is reached again and is assigned a different value from before, the poset is not graded; otherwise continue with new elements

Hello Darij,

I took a quick look at your code and have a few comments.

1. You should add the poset that Anne provided illustrating the bug as a doctest in the examples section. This way, it is guaranteed to work in all future versions of Sage.

2. I see that you are trying to create a list of empty lists. An easier and more efficient way to do this is:

   [ [] for x in range(n) ]

3. I see you are using these lists to construct lists of upper and lower covers. I think you should just use the `upper_covers` and `lower_covers` methods for posets, or the `neighbors_out` `neighbours_in` methods for Hasse diagrams.

4. I would probably use a dictionary for `rank_fcn` instead of a list. This way you don't have to create a list of the required length beforehand.

5. Your code first creates a function and then tests it to see if it is a rank function. Is it possible to do the tests as you are creating the function so that in case the poset is not graded, then we get an error as soon as one is detected? I haven't given it much thought. Maybe it isn't as efficient?

Christian,

Nice idea to use the `rank_function` for the plot method!

I don't like this loop:

```
579	                for i,j in edges:           # to find new elements, we run through all edges of the Hasse diagram
580	                    if i in rank_fcn:
                            ...
589	                    else: 
590	                        if j in rank_fcn:   # as above 
```

This means that you will be looking at edges multiple times until one of them has been assigned a rank. You are also looking at edges in other connected components. If there are several connected components, then this will take too long. For example,

```
sage: P = lambda n : Poset([range(n), [(i,i+1) for i in range(0,n,2)]])
sage: time p = P(10000); p
Time: CPU 2.32 s, Wall: 2.32 s
Finite poset containing 10000 elements
sage: time p.is_ranked()
True
Time: CPU 13.35 s, Wall: 13.36 s
```

With Darij and Anne's patch, this only takes 0.99s.

I'm preparing a patch right now to address this.

Here is a review patch. Apply on top of Christian's review patch (which goes on top of Anne's).

It looks at each edge exactly twice.

I also updated the documentation for Poset.rank_function.

Christian: I see you didn't run the doctests. I had to fix your attempt at using rank_function for plotting.

Also, there is a pickling error that got introduced by your patch in posets.py, but I can't replicated it from within Sage. I don't have time to debug this now, so go ahead and try to sort it out.

Hi Christian and Franco,

Thank you for your review patches and investigating this! Franco, conversely, can I ask
you to push your review patch to the sage-combinat queue? That would be easier for me and we
can fold all patches once everyone is happy!

I'll be traveling back to Davis soon (from Oberwolfach), so might not have internet in the meantime.

your code is certainly cleaner than mine was!

I don't see why, but my method seems to be twice as fast for boolean lattices (tested with up to sets of size 8). I would still vote for keeping yours since you have examples where it is much faster, and the code is nicer as well.

Thanks for pushing my patch.

The algorithm starts with some vertex, and propagates the value of the rank function along incoming *and* outgoing edges. If there is a unique minimal vertex in each connected component, then we could just use outgoing edges starting from that minimal vertex. Otherwise, we have to go backwards along some edges.

I just uploaded a new review patch with a small change. I changed one line:

```
    m = min(rank_fcn.values()) 
```

to

```
    m = min(rank_fcn[j] for j in component)
```

in order to renormalize each connected component.

I also pushed my change to the sage-combinat queue.

Hello Anne,

Is the documentation satisfactory?

We still haven't decided about "graded" vs "ranked" (whether they mean the same thing or not), but that's for another ticket. Or it can be our next "Sage Days Discussion". :-)

Hello Franco,

I had added something to the documentation of rank function (about what happens when there are several components and how the normalization works). So this is fine with me.

Yes, there is the issue about is_ranked versus is_graded. Perhaps we should indeed discuss this at the next Sage Days in Minneapolis. At least now Sage does what the documentation says it does! I could add a link from is_graded and is_ranked to rank_function, so that it is easier for the user to find that definition. What do you think?

I could fold all three patches, add this link, post it here and on sage-combinat and you or Christian could have a final look.

Best,

Anne

Great idea. What about "see also" sections for is_graded and is_ranked that point to each other? Perhaps this is what you meant by "add a link"?

Hello Franco and Christian,

I folded the patches and added the links to the rank_function method from is_graded and is_ranked. However, perhaps this was premature since like Franco I get the pickling failure in the doctests which I also cannot reproduce inside sage.

Any idea on how to fix this? I gues this introduced through Christian's review patch by adding the height???

Hi!

The following seems the line causing the pickling failure

+        rank_function = self.rank_function()

So I will remove the height function stuff that Christian added, since I have no idea how to fix this pickling failure otherwise.

Could you please review the new patch?

Thanks,

Anne
