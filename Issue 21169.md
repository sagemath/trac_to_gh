# Issue 21169: Convert and doctest all special functions to SymPy

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/21406

Original creator: rws

Original creation time: 2016-09-03 06:20:06

Not all special functions have doctests for conversion to Sympy like this one:

```
sage: log_gamma(x)._sympy_()
loggamma(x)
```

Let's make sure they all have one and, if not working, use this ticket to document progress.
