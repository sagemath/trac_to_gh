Hi,

* composition_from_subset must be renamed to from_subset
* You may remove the few trailing whitespaces that remain.

The rest looks good.

Comments on the doc in composition.py
* line 786: list(Compositions(4)) may be replaced with Compositions(4).list() (idem lines 877, 882, 927)
* line 844: there is a strange sharp at the end of the line
* line 859: a space is missing

How was this patch file created, as some headers are missing? You should use `hg export [tip]`.

The LaTeX documentation doesn't build because you use backslashes inside the

```
def cardinality(self):
"""
"""
```

docstring instead of

```
def cardinality(self):
r"""
"""
```

Made the fixes (I put it in a few other places as well). I'll double/triple-check over the compiled docbuild once it finishes the rebuild.

I also fixed a broken link. Jeroen, would it be okay if I set this back to positive review?

Sorry about this,

Travis
