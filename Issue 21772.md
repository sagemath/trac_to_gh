Something that happened to me with those tests as well is that I got a more verbose output the first time

```
File "/usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/sage/misc/latex.py", line 2157, in sage.misc.latex.?
Failed example:
    view(4, margin=5, debug=True)
Expected:
    \documentclass{article}
    ...
    \usepackage[tightpage,active]{preview}
    \PreviewEnvironment{page}
    \setlength\PreviewBorder{5.000000mm}
    \begin{document}\begin{page}$4$\end{page}
    \end{document}
    ...
Got:
    This is XeTeX, Version 3.14159265-2.6-0.99991 (TeX Live 2014) (preloaded format=xelatex)
     restricted \write18 enabled.
    entering extended mode
    LaTeX2e <2014/05/01>
    Babel <3.9l> and hyphenation patterns for 48 languages loaded.
...
```

It ends up being a super set of the expected output. I didn't get it when running the test remotely. I will have to check if you need to be on the machine to see that.

It must be because of the `debug=True` option that is given to many subcommands in the view function. What does `debug=True` mean anyway, printing which info? Since it is not well defined, it seems not the proper way to doctest the view function.

Also, we do not know where the .tex and the .pdf files are generated. And there is no way to run the view function without opening the generated .pdf file. So, it is difficult to test the `view` function properly.

OK, in any case the change is rather trivial. I don't like seeing windows poping up either in the middle of what I am doing because doctests are running in the background. Which is exactly what happened to me this afternoon.

Can you fill in the author section please.
