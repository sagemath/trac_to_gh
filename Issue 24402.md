Add function to iterate over all greedy and supergreedy (also called depth-first-search) linear extensions of a poset.

I would like to add function(s) to iterate over all greedy and super-greedy linear extensions of a poset. What is a reasonable interface? Currently `linear_extensions()` returns an object of a specific type, but for example `tau()` of a greedy linear extension is not necessarily greedy.

Changing status from new to needs_info.

Code added, interface missing.

I would probably subclass the linear extension classes and have `P.linear_extensions()` take a (super)greedy argument.

But what to do for `.tau()` then?

Meanwhile I mark this as needs_review: this does not affect "interface", i.e. `posets.py` at all. Interface can be thinked independently.

Have it return something in the general linear extension class (a lÃ¡ `Tableau` and its subclasses).

It is simple enough to change this later on too. While it made me laugh, we should be a bit more professional than `i_want_python_3` as a variable name.

Changed that. (But for example `orthocomplementations_iterator` has same kind of variable name.)

I don't think I reviewed that. Although that has something worse: raising a `StopIteration` (at least, IIRC this to be a bad thing and instead you should just `return`).

Anyways, thank you. Positive review.

Can be no `yield` and `return` in the same function.

No problem.

Void returns are okay, you just cannot return any object. Addendum: For example, see `sage.combinat.partitions.RegularPartitions_all.__iter__`.

OK, I did not know that. It is at least shorter to write just `return`, althought I did not find a reference to prefer it instead of `raise StopIteration`.

It is gone after Python 3.5.2: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0479/
