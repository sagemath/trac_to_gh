the following contradicts the doc:
with `meataxe` installed, I get

And, by the way, `gap` instead of `meataxe` appears to work, but is not documented.

Note that I've opened #28871 for a different meataxe issue (compiler warnings for the meataxe wrappers in the sage library). But I don't think there is a dependency in one direction or the other.

```
sage: M = random_matrix(GF(25,'x'),5)
sage: type(M)
<class 'sage.matrix.matrix_gfpn_dense.Matrix_gfpn_dense'>

So, meataxe as default implementation does work.

Here's the problem:

```
sage: sage.rings.finite_rings.integer_mod_ring.is_IntegerModRing(GF(5))
True
```

The non-default implementation "meataxe" would only be considered when `is_IntegerModRing(R)` returns False but `is_FiniteField(R)` returns True.

What do you think: Would it be a good idea to totally rewrite the logic that is implemented in `get_matrix_class`? It seems rather convoluted to me. The easiest fix would of course be to *first* check whether we have a finite field and only later check whether we at least have an `IntegerModRing`.

With the new commit, I switch the "if-then" branches for integer-mod-rings and for finite fields, which is needed since we want to treat finite prime fields as fields and not as integer-mod-rings.

Also, I added an example for `implementation='gap'`.

I didn't run tests yet, but switch it to "needs review" anyway...

I don't know what pyflakes complains about (it says "no such log"). Anyway, without meataxe tests pass. So, hopefully the remaining question is whether they also pass with meataxe installed.

Interesting. According to "git blame", that method was introduced by Burcin Erocal 10 years ago. Why has that error never shown up before?

The method `_matrices_from_rows` is defined in `src/sage/matrix/matrix_modn_dense_template.pxi`. So, perhaps Matrix_gfpn_dense should use the template?

Apparently not. Its first line states "Dense matrices over `\ZZ/n\ZZ` for `n` small using the LinBox library (FFLAS/FFPACK)."

Actually it could be that the creation of matrices from rows is defined for general matrices anyway. And as there is only a single line of code that actually uses `_matrices_from_rows`, it may very well be a better solution to nuke `_matrices_from_rows`.

I was mistaken about the purpose of `_matrices_from_rows`: It isn't about slicing but it is a very technical and hardly natural construction.

`src/sage/matrix/matrix_cyclo_dense.pyx` is the only place in which this method. It is supposed to be with a matrix over ZZ/nZZ, but meataxe is strictly over a field. Moreover, by default, meataxe should only be used in Sage when there is a finite NON-PRIME field. Hence, even over ZZ/(prime(ZZ), meataxe should normally not be used.

So, one could argue that the matrix implementation used in `src/sage/matrix/matrix_cyclo_dense.pyx` should be hard-coded. Would that be a solution that you could accept?
