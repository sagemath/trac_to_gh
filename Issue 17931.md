I don't think all these `quadratic_form__*` modules need to be added, aren't they just methods of quadratic forms?

Yes, mostly, indeed.

I _think_ all functions in these modules are imported as members of `quadratic_form.QuadraticForm` and already picked up by sphinx for this reason, except for `quadratic_form__evaluate`, whose contents are imported at the module level. I have updated the `rst` file accordingly. But I didn't check super-thoroughly, and of course, that's not a very robust way of doing things in the first place.

Why replace

```
from random import random
```

by

```
import random
```


This change looks unrelated to documentation.


---

Comment by chapoton created at 2015-08-22 07:40:54

Here is a branch with no changes to the import of random.

As far as I'm concerned yes (thanks Frédéric!). I don't remember why I changed the import, it may have been a rebasing error.

I'm not entirely happy with the formatting of the docstrings, but at least it's better than nothing.

I assume that my last commit is fine, so I'm setting this to positive_review.
