# Issue 19975: Use repr() for "unable to convert" error messages

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/20212

Original creator: jdemeyer

Original creation time: 2016-03-15 10:18:34

It is better to see

```
TypeError: unable to convert 'junk' to an integer
```

instead of

```
TypeError: unable to convert junk to an integer
```

For this reason, consistently use `repr()` formatting for such exceptions.

LGTM (I don't particular care for the verbosity for the induced crystals error message, but I understand that it is there for consistency/explanation).
