Unfortunately a test run can only get a red or a green status on GH Actions.
`TARGETS_OPTIONAL` is designed for additional tests of things that are likely to fail - such as `ptest` in `tox.yml`, which always has 1 or 2 failures that we don't want to be signaled by a red status.

There's only a rather shallow reason why currently use `TARGETS_OPTIONAL` for testing the optional and experimental packages.

Thanks. Yes, sounds reasonable.

From my point of view, optional should mean almost as safe as sage itself and experimental is for all stuff that might or might not work (I guess there are runtime failures as well that make stuff experimental). So adding a doctesting framework for this seems great.
