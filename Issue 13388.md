# Issue 13388: padics should not be iterable

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/13592

Currently, one can iterate over a padic element. So the following code runs forever:

```
sage: for c in Qp(3).zero():
...       pass
```


This causes some trouble, see #13302 and I think that padics should not return iterators at all.

What should the iterator for Qp(3).zero() be â€” should it be infinite or empty? Should the iterator for Zp(3)(3) and Qp(3)(3) iterate over [0,1] or over [1]?

I believe that if one wants to iterate over the terms, then one should have to call .list() or similar explicitly.
