This patch will add `certificate`-option to `is_meet_semidistributive`.

(There was also a slight but in `TEST`-part of doctest,  a `.is_join_semidistributive()` where should be `.is_meet_semidistributive()`.

Could be nicer with modified `kappa()` on `hasse_diagram.py`. Anyways, this works and will make the software a bit more unified.
