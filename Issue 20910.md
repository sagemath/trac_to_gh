Looks good to me.

Do you think I need to keep the old cmp_code (and deprecate it) ?

I don't, but others might.  Isn't the convention that we do not need to go through the deprecation process for functions which are not automatically imported when Sage starts up?

ok, let us keep things simple. Do you agree to set this to positive review ?

Yes (since test bots are happy and the code looks ok to me).
For various reasons doing my own testing is not possible for me right now.  Thanks!
