Keywords: upgrade

This updates cddlib to the latest version.

Unfortunately there is one small regression I don't quite understand: The doctest introduced in #14479 (then checking for an exception) and amended in #13026 (no longer an exception) throws an exception again.

Thus I had to revert 269c1e1551285.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/25341
