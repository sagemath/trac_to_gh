Ticket retargeted after milestone closed (if you don't believe this ticket is appropriate for the Sage 8.8 release please retarget manually)

I don't understand how this could be closed fixed as it breaks the building of the documentation.

```
OSError: /dev/shm/portage/sci-mathematics/sage-9999/work/sage-9999/src-python3_6/build/lib/sage/knots/link.py:docstring of sage.knots.link.Link.colorings:35: WARNING: citation not found: Livi1993
```

This ticket replace `Livi1993` in `sage/knots/link.py` with `Liv1993` in `doc/en/reference/references/index.rst` unfortunately there are still some instances of `Livi1993` left in `sage/knots/link.py`

```
# grep Livi1993 /dev/shm/portage/sci-mathematics/sage-9999/work/sage-9999/src-python3_6/build/lib/sage/knots/link.py
        - Chapter 3 of [Livi1993]_
        - Chapter 3 of [Livi1993]_
```


How do we proceed now that this ticket is merged?

Strange, it seems to pass on the patchbot. Standard procedure is Volker will just reopen the ticket. Otherwise we just have a blocker followup ticket.

First, I built the docs several times to test this ticket, and I didn't run into any problems. Second, I don't see "Chapter 3 of [Livi1993]_" in link.py. What version of Sage are you working on, and what branch? In fact, `grep -R "Chapter 3 of" src/sage` comes up blank for me.

Oh, maybe you're using #21863 which was not merged when #27500 was being reviewed. If both were merged at the same time, that could explain it.

The way to proceed is to continue with both merged and then to fix the documentation in a new ticket. (Or reopen #21863 and deal with it there. I would much rather not reopen this ticket: a ticket like this that makes lots of changes to the master bibliography file could easily run into merge conflicts, so we should keep it merged.)

I am pulling on Volker's branch in which both tickets are merged :( This ticket is the most recently merged one - which is why I came here. I don't understand how it wasn't spotted during the merge. I guess we should have a follow up ticket then.

Volker: this error is caused by the combination of this ticket with #21863. I request that you merge this one instead of #21863, because this one is more likely to run into merge conflicts if it gets delayed. The fix will be easy – change "[Livi1993]" to "[Liv1993]" twice in the other ticket.

Just merge #21863 in here and make the fix, or wait for the next beta which should be out this weekend and doesn't have a merge conflict yet.
