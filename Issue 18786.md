# Issue 18786: Minor typos in 6.8

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: jmantysalo

Original creation time: 2015-08-13 12:40:30

This is a container ticket for minor documentation typos found in version 6.8. I'll add them here, if I am not doing another ticket for same part of Sage. Of course others can also make additions to this.

- generic_graph.py / breadth_first_search / :meth:`successors` broken link.

Hellooooooooo !

I fixed some of the points you listed here, and so I add the commit. To be honest I am a bit scared to add a commit on a ticket that is not in `needs_review`, for I am worried that it may get forgotten... Saw this happen too many times already `:-/`

I took care of the typos in the group theory tuto and posets. Maybe we can just stop there for the moment ?

But then we should just open a new one... And I guess 6.9 will not be out for some time.

I did this because a) Nathann hoped for less tickets, at least tickets only correcting a typo or two, b) Sage seems to still have small typos that I found when reading the manuals, and c) for me it seems unlogical to correct totally non-relating typo in some ticket.

As an artifical example: Let's suppose that I wonder about Frattini sublattice. When thinking about docstring I see a typo in Frattini subgroup. Now I should make a note about the typo, so that I won't forget it when I make a patch at last.

I look throught your pathces. Two questions:

- Why is `interior_paths` removed from index?
- What is meant by "(see `GenericGraph` and `GenericGraph`)" on documentation of option `force_spring_layout`?

Otherwise all seems good. As beta5 is already out, maybe we should close this and start collecting typos for 6.10. Please also review my small patch that add two links.

Yo,

> - Why is `interior_paths` removed from index?

Because the function does not exist anymore (#17462)

> - What is meant by "(see `GenericGraph` and `GenericGraph`)" on documentation of option `force_spring_layout`?

Odd. Well, I guess it was meant to be references toward `.show` and `.plot`.

To me `FinitePosets` and `FiniteLatticePosets` are internal classes, and not meant to be instanciated by the user.

Arghs. As #18534 got rejected, now there is no way for the user to found `is_selfdual()`. And are you sure that _category_ of finite posets is meant to be internal? I know that the _class_ is.

I do not think that the category of Posets is meant to be internal.

I guess you meant the category of finite posets. Then my patch should be OK (but needs review, of course). And now just `force_spring_layout` needs checking.

Oh, my mistake. I was thinking of the class `FinitePoset` (without the terminal 's'). No problem with your last commit.

I will change some `M\"obius` to `Möbius`, so please wait a little more.

I removed those links. Ready for review.

Okay.

Nathann, look at `shard_preorder_graph()` on catalog of posets and lattices. The link is broken.

On my machine it seems fine.

Arghs. Partially built documentation. Sorry for noice.

Beta6 was released, so maybe this one should be closed. Nathann is busy. Frédéric, can you check my changes: 1) "M\"oibus" to "Möbius" is `hasse_diagram.py`, 2) two links added in `posets/__init__.py` and 3) removed links in `graph_plot_js.py`? After these this can be set to postive review, as I already check changes made by you and Nathann.
