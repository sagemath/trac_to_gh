But then we should just open a new one... And I guess 6.9 will not be out for some time.

I did this because a) Nathann hoped for less tickets, at least tickets only correcting a typo or two, b) Sage seems to still have small typos that I found when reading the manuals, and c) for me it seems unlogical to correct totally non-relating typo in some ticket.

As an artifical example: Let's suppose that I wonder about Frattini sublattice. When thinking about docstring I see a typo in Frattini subgroup. Now I should make a note about the typo, so that I won't forget it when I make a patch at last.

Arghs. As #18534 got rejected, now there is no way for the user to found `is_selfdual()`. And are you sure that *category* of finite posets is meant to be internal? I know that the *class* is.
