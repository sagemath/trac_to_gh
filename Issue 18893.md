```
sage: R.<x,y,z> = ZZ[]
sage: x.subs({x:1}).parent()
Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y, z over Integer Ring
sage: x.subs({x:1, y:1, z:1}).parent()
Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y, z over Integer Ring
```

compared to the univariate case

```
sage: R.<t> = ZZ[]
sage: t.subs({t:1}).parent()
Integer Ring
```


Note also that we have

```
sage: x.subs({x:RDF(1)}).parent()
Real Double Field
```
