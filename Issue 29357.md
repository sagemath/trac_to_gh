# Issue 29357: Remove some dead spkg-configure.m4 code

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29594

I've managed to copy/paste at least three instances of


```
sage_spkg_install_<package>=yes
```


into the nonexistent "else" branch of `SAGE_SPKG_DEPCHECK`. There is in fact no "else" branch for that macro, but the hard-coded failure action is precisely what I was trying to do anyway.
