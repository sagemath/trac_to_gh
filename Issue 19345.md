# Issue 19345: Upgrade boot_cropped to 1.58.0

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Some R packages using boost find Sagemath's boost first when used from within Sagemath's R and won't work with boost<1.58.

Original tarball available on [Sourceforge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost/1.58.0/) (no directly available link. Sorry, folks...).

Changing status from new to needs_review.

Passes ptestlong with no failures. Problem with R packages seems solved.

[ Edit ] Added a `spkg-src` script, and tested it successfully in a directory containing the new tarball, `package-version.txt` anr dhe script itself (`chmod +x`, of course).

Needs review

I've put the tarball on a sane webserver.

Thank you very much ! I'll look at getting a webserver somewhere, but my previous attemps do not make me optimistic...

Try github.io.
I just followed the instructions here: https://pages.github.com/
I created an empty repo named dimpase.github.io on my github account (name dimpase) page,
cloned it, added (using git) the tar.gz file, committed, pushed, and checked that this file
can be obtained via `wget http://dimpase.github.io/boost_cropped-1.58.0.tar.bz2`

all works just fine...
