Looking at Falcó, Hackbusch, Nouy, Tree-based tensor formats, ​https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.01262 (#31991), section 3, we may want to implement **normed** tensor modules.

Currently, our tensor modules are not equipped with a norm:

```
sage: FiniteRankFreeModule(QQ, 2)
2-dimensional vector space over the Rational Field
sage: v = _.an_element()
sage: v.norm()
AttributeError: 'FiniteRankFreeModule_with_category.element_class' object has no attribute 'norm'
```

See #30092 (Categories of normed additive monoids/groups, normed modules/rings/fields, ...)
