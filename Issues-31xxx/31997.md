The old code was replaced by new code in 2009 and is unused in the library.

```
$ git grep 'fast_float *(.*old *='
src/sage/ext/fast_eval.pyx:    sage: f = fast_float(sqrt(x^7+1), 'x', old=True)
src/sage/ext/fast_eval.pyx:def fast_float(f, *vars, old=None, expect_one_var=False):
src/sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial.pyx:            sage: list(fast_float(K(0), old=True))
src/sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial.pyx:            sage: list(fast_float(K(17), old=True))
src/sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial.pyx:            sage: list(fast_float(y, old=True))
```

Given that this is from a time before deprecation warnings were invented, and this is clearly marked as old, we just remove this code.

We also replace the remaining direct uses of `_fast_float_` methods by:
- `sage.calculus.integration.numerical_integral`
- `sage.numerical.optimize.{minimize_constrained,find_fit}`
- `Expression.find_local_minimum`
- `Expression.find_root`

Finally, we remove the entire implementation of the old `fast_float` (centering around class `FastDoubleFunc`) and all `_fast_float_` methods.

Possibly the name is unfortunate, but the presence of the method is actually what makes `fast_callable` work. Given that it implements the protocol that makes `fast_callable` work, I think the name is actually quite understandable.

FWIW here's a way to mimic `fast_float_arg(0)` and `fast_float_arg(1)`:

```python
sage: u = SR.symbol('u', domain='real')                                         
sage: v = SR.symbol('v', domain='real')                                         
sage: u = fast_callable(u, vars=[u,v])                                          
sage: v = fast_callable(v, vars=[u,v])
sage: u(1,2)

sage: v(1,2)

Should be fixed now. Numpy didn't know what to do about NaN unless `domain=float` was specified.

Not important, but one of those example functions isn't doing what the doctest thinks it does:

```
sage: f(x) = 0.0 / max(0, x)                                                                                                                                                 
sage: f                                                                                                                                                                      
x |--> NaN
```

since

```
sage: max(0, x)
