The giac upgrade to 1.6 in #30537 (9.3.beta9) made it necessary to switch pari to thread mode:

```
2c783788d3 build/pkgs/pari: Use Configure --mt=pthread
f49c6bf458 build/pkgs/pari/spkg-configure.m4: Check PARI_MT_ENGINE
```

The issue I find with this is that pari compiled with pthread is ~40% slower than pari in `make test-all`, e.g.:
- single thread pari:

```
+++ Total bench for gp-sta is 275142
+++ Total bench for gp-dyn is 281436
```
- pari with `--mt=pthread`:

```
+++ Total bench for gp-sta is 344547
+++ Total bench for gp-dyn is 399066
```
I think sage uses `gp-dyn` so that's a 40% slowdown (even using `gp-sta` there would be a 25% slowdown).

The performance hit might be even worse than that in some gp scripts, e.g.:

```
$ echo "sum(i=1,100 000 000, i);" | time gp -q
5.09user 0.00system 0:05.10elapsed 99%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 10700maxresident)k
0inputs+0outputs (0major+1568minor)pagefaults 0swaps
$ echo "sum(i=1,100 000 000, i);" | time sage-9.2/sage -gp -q
4.70user 0.04system 0:04.77elapsed 99%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 10496maxresident)k
16inputs+16outputs (0major+8362minor)pagefaults 0swaps
$ echo "sum(i=1,100 000 000, i);" | time sage-9.3.rc0/sage -gp -q
8.79user 0.02system 0:08.84elapsed 99%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 10852maxresident)k
8inputs+16outputs (0major+8729minor)pagefaults 0swaps
```
The performance of gp scripts may not be so important for sage, but it is for a system install of pari-gp, which means this places a conflict between what is good for a distro pari and what is required (?) for compiling sage. See https://github.com/void-linux/void-packages/pull/29635 for an example of this.

Thanks for the info (and sorry, I'm not familiar with git-trac, I see now that the way branches get merged I should have followed the branch up the tree to find 8ff8b0b, but that's not completely obvious at first sight).

For the record, I think [#30537 comment:45](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/30537#comment:45) shows an example failure (doctesting `src/sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_ideal.py`).

I recompiled sage-9.3.rc0 with single thread pari and indeed I get a lot of failures in doctesting this file, the first one being the one in the comment quoted above. Weird enough, when I try to reproduce the doctest by hand, step-by-step, it does not fail (?).

What could be done about it? Having a 40% or more penalty for pari seems a huge cost to pay.

Is there an indication of when and where giac added this requirement?

Just a quick note, since I reported this I've given up and switched to pari with pthreads, since it seems just too difficult otherwise.

The mitigations I'm using are:
- `-flto -fno-semantic-interposition`
- link gp with static libpari
