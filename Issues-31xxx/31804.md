The parent `Polyhedra(QQ, 3)` is the set of polyhedra whose vertices/rays/lines are in `QQ^3` and whose facets/equalities are in `QQ^{3+1}`.

We define parents corresponding to more general, finite or infinite, allowed sets of vertices/rays/lines, facets/equalities.

The category `PolyhedralSets` currently makes every parent an additive monoid (Minkowski sums). This will need to be changed -- the parent will be an additive monoid only if the sets of vertices/rays/lines, facets/equalities are.
