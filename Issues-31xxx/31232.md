I just came across this ticket and have one small suggestion for follow-up tickets concerning typing:

```
PP = NewType('PP', 'PlanePartition')
def random_element(self) -> PP:
```
Was the point of introducing PP as a new type was to prevent import problems? This can also be accomplished by specifying the type as a string:

```
def random_element(self) -> 'PlanePartition':
```
Once we drop python 3.6 support, one can also import annotations from future, which does this automatically so that the following works: 

```
from __future__ import annotations
def random_element(self) -> PlanePartition:
```
