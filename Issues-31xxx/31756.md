This works with Sage 9.2, but fails with 9.3.rc4:

```
sage: mathematica('Sqrt[x]').sage()
Sqrt(x)
```

The result is an uppercase symbolic function, but should be the lowercase function `sqrt` in Sage.

A doctest in interfaces/mathematica.py now fails:

```
File "src/sage/interfaces/mathematica.py", line 776, in sage.interfaces.mathematica.MathematicaElement._sage_
Failed example:
    m.sage()                          # optional - mathematica
Expected:
    (cos(1/x) - 1)^2*sin(sqrt(-x^2 + 1))
Got:
    (cos(1/x) - 1)^2*sin(Sqrt(-x^2 + 1))
```

This is also reproducible with `mathematica_free`, see [this post on sage-release](https://groups.google.com/g/sage-release/c/rjM44KX8pbc/m/8xYVp77iBgAJ).

This also affects the Gamma function:

```
File "src/sage/functions/gamma.py", line 731, in sage.functions.gamma._mathematica_gamma
Failed example:
    gamma(4/3)._mathematica_().sage()       # indirect doctest, optional - mathematica
Expected:
    gamma(4/3)
Got:
    Gamma(4/3)
```

This is caused by the mathematica symbol table containing entries (for 'Sqrt' and 'Gamma') which are python functions but not of class `sage.symbolic.function.Function`. The implementation of `symbolic_expression_from_string` in #31047 sorts the entries of the symbol table into vars and functions by checking for this class in order for the parser to be able to search the function and variable namespaces separately.

Unfortunately, it is not easily possible to extend the sorting procedure to sort raw python functions into the function namespace, because sagemath variables are also callable objects.

There are basically two ways to solve the problem:
1. convert the entries in the symbol table to proper sagemath functions (this is what I did in #31047 for the single sympy symbol table entry affected by this problem)
2. change the parser to scan the whole symbol table. This is a bit problematic since it means that the parser will happily accept nonsensical input like `pi(10)`.

Thank you for the analysis. Indeed, the Gamma function is affected by this, as well. In the case of the Gamma function, I recall that this is intended: The function `_mathematica_gamma` in the symbol table is a wrapper around the gamma function in Sage, which is needed because the order or number of arguments of the Gamma function in Mathematica is different. While it may be possible to turn this into a symbolic `Function`, this would only be needed as a workaround for this bug.

It is also possible to register new symbols, for example to convert custom functions from Mathematica to equivalent definitions in Sage, which could be Python functions. This still seems to work though.

```
sage: from sage.libs.pynac.pynac import register_symbol
sage: foo = lambda x: x^2 + 1
sage: register_symbol(foo, dict(mathematica='Foo'))
sage: mathematica.eval('Foo[x_]:=x^2+1')
sage: Foo = mathematica('Foo')
sage: Foo.sage() is foo
True
```
Some of the functions in Sage's global namespace are also Python functions:

```
sage: type(sqrt), type(gamma), type(log)
(<class 'function'>, <class 'function'>, <class 'function'>)
```

> Unfortunately, it is not easily possible to extend the sorting procedure to sort raw python functions into the function namespace, because sagemath variables are also callable objects.


How about checking whether the object is callable and not an instance of `SageObject`? Or whether it is an instance of `function`?

I was on the same track as `gh-spaghettisalat`, but less advanced (I'm new at debugging Sage...).

```
gh-mwageringel}}}' suggestion  of making {{{sqrt}}} and {{{gamma}}} proper Sage functions seems reasonable : if that's the only "corner cases" encountered so far, and the need to create proper Sage function for further additions is well documented, this would be also an appreciable cleanup.

One might also plan to create proper Sage function //wrappers// around the current functions This might even be delegated to {{{sage.symbolic.function_factory.function}}}, if that's acceptable in Sage library code.

//Warning : diversion ahead...//

I would be very interested in testing this "lite" solution because, I plan to propose to wrap Sympy's symbolic logical functions {{{And}}}, {{{Or}}} and {{{Not}}}, which are sorely lacking in Sage :

The Python operators {{{and}}}, {{{or}}} and {{{not}}} work well according to a "programming) point of view, but spew nonsense when applied to mathematical predication : compare
{{{
sage: (pi>3) and (pi<5)
pi < 5
}}}
with
{{{
sage: from sympy import sympify, And
sage: And(*map(sympify, ((pi>3), (pi<5))))
(pi > 3) & (pi < 5)
}}}

Writing a symbolic wrapper with {{{function}}} isn't quite difficult, adding a {{{_sage_}}} method to sympy's {{{And}}} is also easy ; the difficulty is to integrate this with Maxima :
{{{
sage: var("y")
y
sage: maxima("%pi>y and %pi<x")
%pi>yand%pi<x
}}}
which, of course, fails to backtranslate in Sage :
{{{
sage: maxima("%pi>y and %pi<x").sage()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
SyntaxError                               Traceback (most recent call last)
}}}
[ Backtrace : snip... ]
{{{
TypeError: unable to make sense of Maxima expression 'pi>yandpi<x' in Sage
}}}

Any hint about this problem in the Maxima interface would be very welcome...

//End of diversion...//

So I'm interested in your comments on {{{gh-mwageringel}}}' suggestions.

Ok, here is a minimal fix that treats Python functions as functions as well. Please review.

I have not tested the optional internet doctests because of SSL problems on my machine, but I assume that the current branch also fixes the errors mentioned on sage-release.

(There is one unrelated but harmless Mathematica doctest failure in interfaces/mathematica.py, related to the recent html/latex changes, which I am going to fix in #29136.)

> How about checking whether the object is callable and not an instance of `SageObject`? Or whether it is an instance of `function`?


One concurring datapoint : without your patch, Python functions are ignored by Mathematia objects `_sage_` method :

```
sage: # Attempt to define the (lower) incomplete beta function
sage: def foo(x, a, b): return x^a*gamma(a)*hypergeometric((a, -b + 1), (a + 1,), x)/gamma(a + 1)
sage: mathematica("Foo[x, a, b]")._sage_(locals={"Foo":foo})
Foo(x, a, b)
```
whereas Sage's //symbolic// functions are not :

```
sage: foo=function("foo", nargs=3, eval_func=lambda self, x, a, b: x^a*gamma(a)*hypergeometric((a, -b + 1), (a + 1,), x)/gamma(a + 1))
sage: mathematica("Foo[x, a, b]")._sage_(locals={"Foo":foo})
x^a*gamma(a)*hypergeometric((a, -b + 1), (a + 1,), x)/gamma(a + 1)
```

Testing your patch : stay tuned...

After rebasing your branch on `develop` :

[ Snip... ]

A first cursory look is satisfying :

```
sage: mathematica.Sqrt(x^2)._sage_()
sqrt(x^2)
sage: with assuming(x>0): mathematica.Sqrt(x^2)._sage_().simplify()
x
sage: mathematica.Gamma(x)._sage_()
gamma(x)
sage: (mathematica.Gamma(x)/mathematica.Gamma(x-1)).sage().simplify_factorial()
x - 1
sage: def foo(x, a, b): return x^a*gamma(a)*hypergeometric((a, -b + 1), (a + 1,), x)/gamma(a + 1)
sage: mathematica("Foo[x, a, b]")._sage_(locals={"Foo":foo})
x^a*gamma(a)*hypergeometric((a, -b + 1), (a + 1,), x)/gamma(a + 1)
```

Similarly :

```
harpent@zen-book-flip:/usr/local/sage-9$ sage -t --long src/sage/interfaces/mathematica.py 
Running doctests with ID 2021-05-02-19-58-43-32f2badb.
