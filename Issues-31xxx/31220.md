Running the doctests in WSL from a mounted Windows directory didn't worked because the folder is writable by default. (There are some ways to control the permissions, but its rather involved: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/file-permissions).

This ticket removes this check completely as I didn't see against which attack vectors it protects (if somebody has write access to sage's code base anyway, then she could also easily disable this check). But maybe I'm missing something.

> I have no objections to removing this test.


Me neither really. It used to test the fact that Jeroen patched python2.7 to secure paths. We have that out of the box with python3 except in isolated cases like above.

It is technically not sagemath's job to test python security out of the box. Let's move on.
