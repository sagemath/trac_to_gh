I tested as follows.

Set up a new clone with tricks to save time and bandwidth:

```
$ ORIG=sage.git  # local mirror of https://github.com/sagemath/sage.git
$ DEST=sage93c  # name for new clone
$ UPST=$(pwd)/sage-upstream  # common upstream folder for several clones
$ git clone --single-branch --branch develop --tags $ORIG $DEST  # clone locally
$ cd $DEST
$ ln -s $UPST ./upstream  # use common upstream folder to download less 
$ git remote add trac git://trac.sagemath.org/sage.git -t develop
```

Follow your advice:

```
$ git trac checkout 31419
$ git trac fetch 31344
$ git merge FETCH_HEAD
```

Build and test:

```
$ source .homebrew-build-env
$ ./bootstrap -q
$ ./configure --enable-download-from-upstream-url -q
$ make -s V=0
$ make -s V=0 testlong
```

The build succeeds but `make testlong` gives:

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage -t --long src/sage/interfaces/singular.py  # Killed due to segmentation fault
sage -t --long src/sage/interfaces/mwrank.py  # 4 doctests failed
sage -t --long src/sage/interfaces/gap.py  # 7 doctests failed
----------------------------------------------------------------------
```

When run again separately (with `./sage -t --long`), the tests

- pass for `src/sage/interfaces/singular.py` and `src/sage/interfaces/mwrank.py`
- keep failing for `src/sage/interfaces/gap.py`

Even easier is to use `(cd $ORIG && git worktree add $DEST)`
