```
We revise the CI workflows for Cygwin, now going through `SAGE_ROOT/tox.ini` for the package installation and invoking the new system package scripts from there.

We also add more stages to make the workflow more robust; this was originally done in #29152.

We also make another improvement that was easy to do:
The build now uses `SAGE_LOCAL=/opt/sage-$COMMIT` instead of `/sage/local`.
This will make it easier to download and install several versions of Sage.

 We fix it in this ticket by going through `SAGE_ROOT/tox.ini` for the package installation and invoking the new system package scripts from there.
+
+We also make another improvement that was easy to do:
+The build now uses `SAGE_LOCAL=/opt/sage-$COMMIT` instead of `/sage/local`.
+This will make it easier to download and install several versions of Sage.

A few remarks after skimming the changes:

> +        PACKAGES="python38 python38-pip"


I think it's better to install python using the python action, which brings a few goodies along: https://github.com/marketplace/actions/setup-python

> +        C:\tools\cygwin\bin\bash -l -x -c

Can you try to put this as `shell: C:\\tools\\cygwin\\bin\\bash -l -x -c {0}`? Would make the workflow easier to read.


And then my usual rant about using tox for this ;-). I know you are a big fan of using tox, and this is fine. But I still think it's not the best tool for github workflows. You are cramping a lot of things into one command, which makes it hard to see at which stake the workflow fails. I would propose to add helper scripts so that the workflow looks like
- Install dependencies:
  `choco install (build/bin/get-dependencies cygwin) --source cygwin`
- Build: 
  `build/bin/build-local` (with the script that is currently in tox: local, running bootstrap, configure and make)
- Test:
  `tox` (running all python tests)

The scripts can of course be reused in `tox.ini` still giving you the chance to locally use tox for this (although I find it counterintuitive that tox might change my system installation).

    "body": "<a id='comment:38'></a>\nLet me explain again why I like to use `tox` to drive as much as possible in our CI. `tox` is a stable tool that has been under long term maintenance.  For context, before we (well, I) started to use GH Actions, we (well, individual developers many of whom no longer have sufficient time) used buildbot, Circle CI, Travis CI, [GitLab](GitLab) pipelines, ... Because our project is surfing on \"free compute\", the available technologies are changing faster than our project can sustain. Therefore it is important not to spend too much effort on development specific to the CI platform. \n\nThe present ticket consolidates GH Actions-specific code for installing Cygwin to just become part of the tox workflow. It is not enough to just factor through scripts that \"could\" also be run by developers on a local Windows machine: We currently do not even have any developers who do that. By using tox inside the GH Actions workflow, we actually make sure that these scripts are usable (and remain usable when changes are made) outside of a GH Actions environment.",

<a id='comment:38'></a>
Let me explain again why I like to use `tox` to drive as much as possible in our CI. `tox` is a stable tool that has been under long term maintenance.  For context, before we (well, I) started to use GH Actions, we (well, individual developers many of whom no longer have sufficient time) used buildbot, Circle CI, Travis CI, [GitLab](GitLab) pipelines, ... Because our project is surfing on "free compute", the available technologies are changing faster than our project can sustain. Therefore it is important not to spend too much effort on development specific to the CI platform. 

The present ticket consolidates GH Actions-specific code for installing Cygwin to just become part of the tox workflow. It is not enough to just factor through scripts that "could" also be run by developers on a local Windows machine: We currently do not even have any developers who do that. By using tox inside the GH Actions workflow, we actually make sure that these scripts are usable (and remain usable when changes are made) outside of a GH Actions environment.

This is used in `choco install $PACKAGES --source cygwin` to install Cygwin and then these package in Cygwin.

I don't think the setup-python action can do that.

OK, I have run into this situation too. I think what is needed for the `local-...` environments is:
- an environment variable that can be passed to tox to disable system package installs
- a target or environment variable to give an interactive shell.

I will open a ticket for this.

I see two directions of improvement here:
- Moving stuff from `tox.ini` (for `tox -e local-...`) and `build/bin/write-dockerfile.sh` (for `tox -e docker-...`) into our top-level `Makefile`. For example, the complicated rule for the commands of `local` consists entirely of workarounds for things that should really be fixed/improved there.
- Improving the system package information scripts such as `sage-print-system-package-command` further.
Meta-ticket #29146 keeps track of such improvements, let's continue there.

On the other hand, I would be reluctant to add more scripts that developers can use to set up their system automatically. As I have written elsewhere, I think the current approach of printing command lines to educate developers about how to do things on their system is better for the Sage community than trying to provide scripts that do things automagically.
