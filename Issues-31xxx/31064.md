```
We revise the CI workflows for Cygwin, now going through `SAGE_ROOT/tox.ini` for the package installation and invoking the new system package scripts from there.

We also add more stages to make the workflow more robust; this was originally done in #29152.

We also make another improvement that was easy to do:
The build now uses `SAGE_LOCAL=/opt/sage-$COMMIT` instead of `/sage/local`.
This will make it easier to download and install several versions of Sage.

 We fix it in this ticket by going through `SAGE_ROOT/tox.ini` for the package installation and invoking the new system package scripts from there.
+
+We also make another improvement that was easy to do:
+The build now uses `SAGE_LOCAL=/opt/sage-$COMMIT` instead of `/sage/local`.
+This will make it easier to download and install several versions of Sage.

-We fix it in this ticket by going through `SAGE_ROOT/tox.ini` for the package installation and invoking the new system package scripts from there.
+We also add more stages to make the workflow more robust; this was originally done in #29152.
 
 We also make another improvement that was easy to do:
 The build now uses `SAGE_LOCAL=/opt/sage-$COMMIT` instead of `/sage/local`.

Would make the workflow easier to read.\n\n\nAnd then my usual rant about using tox for this ;-). I know you are a big fan of using tox, and this is fine. But I still think it's not the best tool for github workflows. You are cramping a lot of things into one command, which makes it hard to see at which stake the workflow fails. I would propose to add helper scripts so that the workflow looks like\n- Install dependencies:\n  `choco install (build/bin/get-dependencies cygwin) --source cygwin`\n- Build: \n  `build/bin/build-local` (with the script that is currently in tox: local, running bootstrap, configure and make)\n- Test:\n  `tox` (running all python tests)\n\nThe scripts can of course be reused in `tox.ini` still giving you the chance to locally use tox for this (although I find it counterintuitive that tox might change my system installation).",

A few remarks after skimming the changes:

> +        PACKAGES="python38 python38-pip"

I think it's better to install python using the python action, which brings a few goodies along: https://github.com/marketplace/actions/setup-python

> +        C:\tools\cygwin\bin\bash -l -x -c

Can you try to put this as `shell: C:\\tools\\cygwin\\bin\\bash -l -x -c {0}`? Would make the workflow easier to read.


And then my usual rant about using tox for this ;-). I know you are a big fan of using tox, and this is fine. But I still think it's not the best tool for github workflows. You are cramping a lot of things into one command, which makes it hard to see at which stake the workflow fails. I would propose to add helper scripts so that the workflow looks like
- Install dependencies:
  `choco install (build/bin/get-dependencies cygwin) --source cygwin`
- Build: 
  `build/bin/build-local` (with the script that is currently in tox: local, running bootstrap, configure and make)
- Test:
  `tox` (running all python tests)

The scripts can of course be reused in `tox.ini` still giving you the chance to locally use tox for this (although I find it counterintuitive that tox might change my system installation).

This is used in `choco install $PACKAGES --source cygwin` to install Cygwin and then these package in Cygwin.

I don't think the setup-python action can do that.

OK, I have run into this situation too. I think what is needed for the `local-...` environments is:
- an environment variable that can be passed to tox to disable system package installs
- a target or environment variable to give an interactive shell.

I will open a ticket for this.

I see two directions of improvement here:
- Moving stuff from `tox.ini` (for `tox -e local-...`) and `build/bin/write-dockerfile.sh` (for `tox -e docker-...`) into our top-level `Makefile`. For example, the complicated rule for the commands of `local` consists entirely of workarounds for things that should really be fixed/improved there.
- Improving the system package information scripts such as `sage-print-system-package-command` further.
Meta-ticket #29146 keeps track of such improvements, let's continue there.

On the other hand, I would be reluctant to add more scripts that developers can use to set up their system automatically. As I have written elsewhere, I think the current approach of printing command lines to educate developers about how to do things on their system is better for the Sage community than trying to provide scripts that do things automagically.
