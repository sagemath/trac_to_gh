From #30913:

Currently, `pip`, `wheel`, and `setuptools` are installed without making wheels available in `SAGE_SPKG_WHEELS`.

In this ticket, we make wheels available in `SAGE_SPKG_WHEELS`. For the case of `setuptools`, we create a new spkg `setuptools_wheel` that takes care of it (it depends on `wheel`). 

This is so that after installation, we have a complete set of wheels for all Python packages installed by the Sage distribution. This allows users to create a venv by installing a compatible set of wheels (whose compiled extensions use the configured libraries in `SAGE_LOCAL` and the system). The most robust way of doing so is by disabling the use of PyPI (`pip install --no-index`) so that no incompatible wheels can leak in. (This can be tested using  #30913.)

As PEP 517 packages (packages with a `pyproject.toml`, such as `pplpy`) are built using build isolation (without access to already installed packages), they need access to their build system packages such as `wheel` and `setuptools`. When use of PyPI is disabled, this relies on distributions (either source or wheel) to be available otherwise. On this ticket, we make them available as wheels. (We make `pip` available as a wheel for completeness.)
