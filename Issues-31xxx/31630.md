Update: the problem was elsewhere. Original report follows.


Apparently, `SageMath version 9.3.rc2, Release Date: 2021-04-06` breaks `sage-shell` for emacs. More precisely, `sage-shell-edit:send-buffer` and `sage-shell:send-doctest` do not work properly anymore.  For example, pressing `C-c` on the second line in a file containing

```
"""
sage: x = 1+1
"""
```
yields 

```
sage: x = 1+1
xxxxxxxxx         =========         111111111+++++++++111111111111111111
```
in the `*Sage*`buffer.
