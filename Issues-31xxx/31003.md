Add a minimal pytest configuration, so that calling `pytest` from `src` passes without any errors (and without finding any tests for the moment). 

This is a preparation for future usages of pytest, such as #30362 or #30738, and is in the general spirit of #28936 (since pytest is perhaps *the* testing framework for python). For example, one could imagine using `pytest doctest_modules` to run all sage doctests as well.
