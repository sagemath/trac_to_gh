Add a minimal pytest configuration, so that calling `pytest` from `src` passes without any errors (and without finding any tests for the moment). 

This is a preparation for future usages of pytest, such as #30362 or #30738, and is in the general spirit of #28936 (since pytest is perhaps *the* testing framework for python). For example, one could imagine using `pytest doctest_modules` to run all sage doctests as well.

Can I do this as follow-up tickets? The purpose of this one here was to provide a minimal test configuration that works for sage. Using pytest in an effective way definitely needs more changes in various areas.

Ok, this is now #31123.

Can you please retry if it works for you? For me `sage -sh` followed by `pip install pytest` and `pytest` works. You need to run pytest from a python installation in which sage is installed including the Cython modules.
