My home machine can't run `sage -t` in 9.3.beta7:

Running strace on that command shows a bunch of ENOMEM:

I think the default memlimit of 3300 MiB is arbitrary anyway, so maybe it just needs to be raised a little? A slight increase to `--memlimit=3400` solves the problem on that machine.

Also: why do we reimplement `ulimit -v` in a mathematics suite in the first place?

Every time we hit the limit, we increase it, annoying a few people in the process. Seems like we could avoid the intermediate step by just deleting it with the same end result.

To answer my own question: there is exactly one test in the sage library designed to check that allocating a huge matrix space fails gracefully when you run out of memory. To prevent that test from crashing the machine in the process, it's necessary to artificially limit the amount of memory available.

The whole `sage -t --memlimit` thing looks like it exists to support that one test. (It could be used for others, but not too many people are interested in gracefully running out of memory I guess.) The matrix space test relies not only on a limit being set, but that the limit is low enough not to crash the machine. Thus the conflict in choosing a default value that is just low enough to fail in only the expected way.

Despite there being only one such test, it seems to me that the "correct" memory limit is actually test-dependent. The fact that we've been able to get away with a single default for so long is probably just due to there being only one test: it's easy to pick a default that fails that one test but does not crash the machine. If there were twenty such tests, the required memory limit for the twentieth one could be too high to trigger a failure in the first.

Point is, I think the global default limit is the wrong approach here anyway. With only one test to fix, we could just set a memory limit for that one test (on Linux...), and test it unconditionally without any `optional - memlimit` hijinks. This will eliminate the problem for now, without reducing test coverage. If anyone wants to add more memory-limit tests in the future, it could be made less awkward with a wrapper that does the `getrlimit/setrlimit` stuff for you and ignores the subsequent failures on non-linux platforms.

I could settle for this. The reason I opted for removal instead is that (relative to complete removal) setting the default to zero has two cons:

1. It leaves all of the scaffolding for --memlimit and "optional - memlimit" in place but unused by default.
2. The one test needing a memory limit is disabled by default.

To be fair, I don't really think we should be running that one test anyway. It's still going to cause (much more isolated) problems down the road. But I thought it would be easier to get a positive review without removing/disabling any tests that are currently performed.

And I guess if the user has to go out of his way to invoke the memlimit tests, we could just tell him to run `ulimit -v <limit>` before `sage -t`. That would let us get rid of the whole `--memlimit` infrastructure.

The big problem I foresee is that, without the default limit (that was customized for the one test...), the user has no idea what to choose as the memory limit.

As we've seen, 3300MB is too low on Gentoo... it crashes sage. But the one memlimit test does,

```python
MatrixSpace(GF(2), 2^30)(1)
```

which constructs a matrix with `2^31` entries. Depending on the implementation, it shouldn't require *too* much more than 4GiB. So we're asking the user to guess a memlimit within a pretty small window; otherwise either sage itself or that doctest (the only one needing a memlimit in the first place) will fail.
