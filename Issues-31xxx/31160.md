Given that IPython is using `prompt_toolkit` for terminal interactions, we can probably remove the hard requirement for `readline` from the build of `python3`.

This would eliminate the build failures that we see reported occasionally related to `ncurses`/`readline` ("undefined symbol: UP", #31267).
