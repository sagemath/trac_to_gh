This ticket implements `conjugate` more efficiently for matrices over CDF and RDF. This speeds up taking the conjugate, and by extension Hermitian transpose, a lot.

Before:

```
sage: A = matrix.random(CDF, 80)
sage: %timeit A.C
28.7 ms ± 628 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10 loops each)
sage: %timeit A.H
30.2 ms ± 572 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10 loops each)
```

This is a performance bottleneck because it is much slower than matrix multiplication for example, even though that would have worse complexity.

After:

```
sage: A = matrix.random(CDF, 80)
sage: %timeit A.C
5.96 µs ± 36.9 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100000 loops each)
sage: %timeit A.H
14 µs ± 59.7 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100000 loops each)
```
