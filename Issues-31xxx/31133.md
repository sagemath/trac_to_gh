- #33870 Dummy script package _sagemath, record downstream package of Sage in distributions
- A Dockerfile for testing that the sage binary distribution runs on `ubuntu:latest` with the following set of installed distribution packages....
- A Dockerfile for testing that the sage binary distribution is able to install optional packages when run on `ubuntu:latest` with the following set of installed distribution packages....
- Test that a macOS binary distribution works on a set of OS versions, with and without XCode installed. (Sadly, cannot use Docker for that.)
