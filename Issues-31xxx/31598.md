It was observed in [#31554 comment:1](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/31554#comment:1) that pynac prints an empty sum or empty product as an empty string. It should instead print `0` or `1`.

```
sage: f(x) = (cos(a + x) + b*x).series(x,2)
sage: f
x |--> (cos(a)) + (b - sin(a))*x + Order(x^2)
sage: with hold: 
....:     print(f(0))
(b - sin(a))*()
```


Keywords: **pynac, printing**

The `()` term looks like it's an empty sum. Earlier already, it looks like `with hold: f(0)` is a sum consisting of one term, which should obviously be simplified.

It looks like you'd have to extend pynac's "print" (that's to say, it's generation of string representations) to handle empty sums properly.

This is indicative to me that pynac is not designed to evaluate in a hold environment. The immediate advice would be "don't do that".

Judging from https://github.com/pynac/pynac/ there's a reasonable amount of activity.

Pynac is only for use in sage, so sage (more precisely, dimpase) took over the control of pynac a few months ago (but I can't locate the discussion about this right now), so I have been posting all of my pynac patches here on trac. I can move the work somewhere else if that is better.

And you are right that pynac has problems inside hold environments (see #31597).

After further thought, I think it is best if I can keep putting my pynac patches here on the sage trac server, so they get tested by being merged into betas as soon as possible (and tested by the sage patchbots).
