What does this improve? Will something break if I revert it?

I ask because:
- I think this change might be the cause of #33907
- Also, this change makes singular restart every time `singular.interrupt()` is called. I think that is what the doctest failure in[comment:3](#comment%3A3) above is telling us. I think other interfaces do not restart after `interrupt()`.
- comments in #30945 seem to give the impression that it was already fixed by the upgrade of cysignals; was this change really needed to fix or improve something?
