Coercion on right operand via
    Conversion via converter map:
      From: Univariate Laurent Polynomial Ring in t over Complex Field with 53 bits of precision
      To:   Fraction Field of Univariate Polynomial Ring in t over Rational Field
Arithmetic performed after coercions.
Result lives in Fraction Field of Univariate Polynomial Ring in t over Rational Field

I had to change the correction, but now the bot is green.

The issue was about the existence of a morphism from Laurent[t]/QQ to Frac(ZZ[t]).

May I switch to positive ?

By the way, thanks a lot for your reviews, Travis. Domo arigato.
