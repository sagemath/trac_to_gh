Coercion on right operand via

Arithmetic performed after coercions.

I had to change the correction, but now the bot is green.

The issue was about the existence of a morphism from Laurent[t]/QQ to Frac(ZZ[t]).

May I switch to positive ?

By the way, thanks a lot for your reviews, Travis. Domo arigato.
