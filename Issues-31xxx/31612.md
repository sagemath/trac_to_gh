Prompted by a problem report using WSL at https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/1SQf-k15J4Y/m/3EnxbDdWAAAJ

https://pypi.org/project/setuptools-scm/#history

The new version has `python_requires = >=3.6`, so it is OK for Sage 9.3

To try this ticket: `make configure && ./configure --enable-download-from-upstream-url && make build`
