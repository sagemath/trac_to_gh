This is to upgrade to Flint 2.7.1.

Our last upgrade was to Flint 2.6.3 in #29719.

Changes in FLINT 2.7.0 (from NEWS file)

2.7.0 -- 11 Dec 2020

* Multivariate factorisation
* Square root and square testing for finite fields
* Square root and square testing for multivariates
* Zassenhaus factoring speedups (incl. degree pruning)
* Fast factorisation of cubic univariate polynomials
* Add context objects to fmpz_mod_poly functions
* Use BLAS for matrix multiplication over Z/nZ (small n)
* Linear solving for non-square/singular matrices (can_solve)
* Speed up factorisation over Z/nZ (for multiprecision n)

From the packaging point of view the main changes will be
- configuring BLAS
- pthread support
- context object in `fmpz_mod_poly` function (API change)

This ticket is not merged, tarball are not usually mirrored before Volker attempt to merge the tickets. You'll have to fetch the source a different way. Matthias created a handy way of using a string called `upstream_url` in the file checksum.ini to do the fetching from upstream but I cannot remember how it works.
