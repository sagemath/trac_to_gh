This version of `sage_conf` is for making a wheel that packages the precompiled non-Python bits of the Sage distribution, making `SAGE_ROOT` (and thus `SAGE_LOCAL=$SAGE_ROOT/local`) relocatable using Marc Culler's symbolic link surgery (the method proposed in #31076, using `SAGE_ROOT=/var/tmp/sage-...` and a symlink).

The `sage` script invokes `sage-config` to determine `SAGE_ROOT` and `SAGE_LOCAL`. In the version of `sage-config` supplied by this version of `sage_conf`, we ensure that the symlink from `/var/tmp/sage-....` to the actual install location is set.


So far, a wheel has been built for XCode python 3.8 on macOS 10.15.  The wheel is 670MB in size, an order of magnitude above the standard file size limit on PyPI; but a file size limit increase (requested in  https://github.com/pypa/pypi-support/issues/985) has kindly been granted by the PyPI team.  

The wheel declares dependencies (`install-requires`) to all Python packages in the Sage distribution that have extension modules.  The dependencies are specific using `@` to URLs on 
https://github.com/sagemath/sage-wheels/releases/tag/9.5.rc2, where I have uploaded the binary wheels.  Unfortunately, by PyPI policy, such `@` references are not allowed for packages on PyPI. 
Hence, the pip invocation needs to use a URL.

(See also https://twitter.com/mkoeppe_math/status/1378860285537054723)

**Instructions for testing:**

1. Make sure that the `bin` directory of the user installation scheme is in `PATH`. For example, on macOS:

```
$ export PATH=$HOME/Library/Python/3.8/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin
```

2. Install the wheel in the user scheme:

```
$ /usr/bin/python3 -m pip install -U --user  https://github.com/sagemath/sage-wheels/releases/download/9.3.rc1/sagemath_standard-9.3rc1-cp38-cp38-macosx_10_15_x86_64.whl
```

3. Run the installed sage.

```
$ sage
``` 

**Procedure for building the sage_conf wheel and compatible wheels:**


For building wheels on macOS Catalina that uses XCode python 3.8:

```
$ SKIP_CONFIGURE=1 tox -e local-macos-10.15-nohomebrew-python3_xcode -- bash
(tox -e ...) $ (cd src/pkgs/sage_conf-relocatable/ && python3 setup.py bdist_wheel --plat-name macosx_10_15_x86_64)
```
or

```
tox -e local-macos-10.15-nohomebrew-python3_xcode -- SAGE_CHECK=no sage-wheels
```

This creates (uploaded to https://github.com/sagemath/sage-wheels/releases/tag/9.5.rc2)
- src/pkgs/sage_conf-relocatable/dist/sage_conf-9.3rc1-cp38-cp38-macosx_10_15_x86_64.whl
- src/pkgs/sage_conf-relocatable/sage_root/venv-cpython-38-darwin-macosx_10_15_x86_64/var/lib/sage/wheels/*.whl

Build for macOS Big Sur (requires a machine running Big Sur or Monterey) (uploaded to https://github.com/sagemath/sage-wheels/releases/tag/9.5.rc2)

```
tox -e local-macos-11.1-nohomebrew-python3_xcode -- SAGE_CHECK=no sage-wheels
```

Build for macOS Monterey (requires a machine running Monterey)

```
tox -e local-macos-12.1-nohomebrew-python3_xcode -- SAGE_CHECK=no sage-wheels
```


Build for Linux (does not work yet):

```
$ TARGETS_PRE=Makefile tox -e docker-manylinux-2_24-minimal-python3.9 -- sage-wheels

```

**Follow-up steps:** 
- also build a **sagemath-standard** wheel
- build wheels for `manylinux` using `tox -e docker-manylinux....`
  - wheel is much too big: 2.3GB
  - auditwheel complains: `RuntimeError: Invalid binary wheel, found the following shared library/libraries in purelib folder:`; so we should replace our current abuse of package data (`install_data`) by platlib (`install_lib`). https://github.com/pypa/packaging-problems/issues/542#issuecomment-912838470: subclass `build_ext` instead of `build_py`
- disable building the dependencies of the sphinx packages; remove unneeded static libraries; remove duplicated/triplicated shared libraries if possible -- for example by storing a tar file `sage_root.tar` (with symlinks) instead of including the sage root as a directory - https://docs.python.org/3/library/tarfile.html#tarfile.open 
- #31602: split out `sage_root` from `sage_conf` and use install-requires in the `sage_conf` sdist/wheel with @ links to GH releases to the `sage_root` wheel and the built non-`any` wheels.

On macOS, some shared libraries from homebrew still leak into the build:

```
find src/pkgs/sage_conf-relocatable/.tox/python/lib/python3.9/site-packages/sage_root -name "*.so" -o -name "*.dylib" | xargs otool -L
libgiac.dylib:
/usr/local/opt/gettext/lib/libintl.8.dylib
R/library/cluster/libs/*.dylib:
	/usr/local/opt/gettext/lib/libintl.8.dylib (compatibility version 11.0.0, current version 11.0.0)
	/usr/local/opt/pcre/lib/libpcre.1.dylib (compatibility version 4.0.0, current version 4.12.0)
	/usr/local/opt/xz/lib/liblzma.5.dylib (compatibility version 8.0.0, current version 8.5.0)
```
Definitely should disable the R build (#30383).

Also check whether setting CC=`gcc -sysroot....` helps getting rid of `/usr/local` leaking in.

Also need to add `--enable-fat-binary`.

`setup.py build_py` should probably use a symlink from `/var/tmp...` into `~/.sage` as well so that it is easy to test relocation after removing the symlink.
Also `copytree` from `sage_root_source` should be changed so it overwrites (updates) the existing contents of SAGE_ROOT.

the tox test should include the test with `otool` for self-containedness.

The remaining shared libraries from `/usr/local` come in through our `freetype` (which uses libharfbuzz from `/usr/local`), `libgd` (which uses libtiff), and `pillow` (libtiff and everything else).

We could try not to ship `matplotlib` at all in the wheelhouse - it is responsible for pulling in `freetype` and `pillow` - but it still shares one shared library with some of our packages - `libpng`.

 This version of `sage_conf` is for making a wheel that packages the precompiled non-Python bits of the Sage distribution, making `SAGE_ROOT` (and thus `SAGE_LOCAL=$SAGE_ROOT/local`) relocatable using Marc Culler's symbolic link surgery (the method proposed in #31076, using `SAGE_ROOT=/var/tmp/sage-...` and a symlink).
