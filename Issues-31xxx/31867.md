The current behavior of the hyperplane arrangement `.intersection_poset()` method relabels the flats of a hyperplane arrangement. To understand how an arrangement intersects, it would be desirable to retain the original labels of the hyperplane in an intersection poset. The original method will be faster because it does not need to remember the hyperplanes themselves, so it should be retained for use in computing the characteristic polynomial and for backward compatibility.

This should make it faster because you will remove all of those affine subspace containment checks.",
