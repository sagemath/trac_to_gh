Code in `build/pkgs/gcc/spkg-configure.m4`, last modified in #30128, tries to use the `configure`-generated file `src/bin/sage-env-config` as part of the `SAGE_BROKEN_GCC` test.

As observed in #30845, this fails on builds from a distclean source tree into a `SAGE_LOCAL` that has an installed `g++`.
