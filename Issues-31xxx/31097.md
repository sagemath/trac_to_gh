Code in `build/pkgs/gcc/spkg-configure.m4`, last modified in #30128, tries to use the `configure`-generated file `src/bin/sage-env-config` as part of the `SAGE_BROKEN_GCC` test.

As observed in #30845, this fails on builds from a distclean source tree into a `SAGE_LOCAL` that has an installed `g++`.

Thanks! That worked. However, now I get:

```
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Checking whether SageMath should install SPKG gcc...
checking for C compiler vendor... gnu
checking whether /usr/share/miniconda/envs/sage-build/bin/x86_64-conda-linux-gnu-c++ supports C++11 features with -std=gnu++11... yes
checking for /usr/share/miniconda/envs/sage-build/bin/x86_64-conda-linux-gnu-cc option to accept ISO C99... none needed
configure: no suitable system package found for SPKG gcc
checking for the location of crti.o... /usr/share/miniconda/envs/sage-build/bin/../x86_64-conda-linux-gnu/sysroot/usr/lib/../lib
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
so detection is not yet working.
