Thank you for adding this code. However, there are a few things that will need to be addressed before this can be included.

- All methods and functions need to be doctested.
- There isn't a need to define a sublevel of the documentation for this one additional file. Just adding it to the usual homology documentation is fine. In a related note, I would put your files under the `sage/homology` folder.
- I wouldn't use `__foo` methods. There is no need to name-mangle. Just `_foo` is fine. (This will also make it easier to doctest; note that this does not apply to special methods like `__getitem__`.)
- Avoid useless checks here with short-circuiting:

  ```diff
  -if j%1000 == 0 and self._verbose:
  +if self._verbose and j%1000 == 0:
  ```
- Please follow PEP8 when reasonable. In particular, use Python's naming convention for variables. For example, change `_numSimplices` -> `_num_simplices`.

Some comments:

- It might be a good idea to have ways of converting to and from simplicial complexes: for instance, if X is a filtered complex, then a method that takes a value n and returns the complex made up of all simplices with filtration at most n. Also a `_simplicial_` method so that `SimplicialComplex(X)` works. In addition, take a simplicial complex and make it a filtered complex with everything in filtration 0.

- Related to that, I was wondering if it made sense for `FilteredComplex` to inherit from `SimplicialComplex`. I don't think so, but I thought I'd ask.

- Also related to that, would it make sense to have a way of modifying the filtration value for a given simplex? I would suggest renaming `get_value` to `filtration`. Maybe it could take two arguments: a required argument `s`, a simplex, and if that is the only argument, then return its filtration. If an optional argument `v` is present, then instead set its filtration to `v`.

- Throughout, I would change "filtered complex" to "filtered simplicial complex", and I would change the name of the file and the name of the class accordingly. When I see "filtered complex," I tend to think of a filtered chain complex, and then I think that there should be spectral sequences lurking somewhere. (That would be a great task for someone to take on.) To make things unambiguous, we should have `FilteredChainComplex` (I hope eventually) and `FilteredSimplicialComplex` (from this ticket).

- Regarding

```
    This implementation requires filtration values to be positive. Most
    features will not work with negative values.
```
 Should we have a warning or error if the user uses negative filtration values? I would also add this comment to the docstring for the `__init__` method, so that users will see if when they do `FilteredComplex?`.

- In the `__init__` method, I like the comments about `_vertices`, `_simplices`, and `_degrees_dict`. Can you add a similar comment about `_warnings`? (Or document the `warnings` argument.) Is `degree` the same as filtration value? I might change that language, at least in the docstring and names of the user-viewable variables (for example `simplex_degree_list` could perhaps just be renamed to `simplices`).

This might require a lot of work: various methods for `SimplicialComplex` would have to be modified to work with `FilteredSimplicialComplex`, like product, wedge, join, ..., unless we just forget the filtration. At least `FilteredSimplicialComplex` could inherit from `GenericCellComplex`, and maybe there could be a new intermediate class that both it and `SimplicialComplex` could inherit from.

I'm working on implementing all those suggestions, thank you for the very insightful feedback !

I also think that having `FilteredSimplicialComplex` inherit from `SimplicialComplex` is a bit odd, for all the reasons mentionned above, but I'm not sure it should inherit from `GenericCellComplex` either, since they don't really have the same homology type...

Maybe a simple first solution would be, as jhpalmieri suggests, to have a `_simplicial_()` method for `FilteredSimplicialComplex`, which returns the maximal simplicial complex associated to the filtered complex, as well as a `prune(max_value)` method which returns a copy of the filtered complex, where simplices of value more than `max_value` have been removed.

I agree, I didn't know about the cached_method decorator and it can probably be very useful here. However there is a problem: since `FilteredSimplicialComplex` objects can have their simplices inserted or changed, the cache key needs to take into account whether the complex has changed since last time persistent homology was computed or not.
I was thinking of just counting the number of times that the complex has been modified and have that also be part of the cache key, but maybe there is a simpler / less hacky solution...
In any case, I think that the `_compute_persistent_homology` method should be cached rather than the `persistence_intervals` method, since it can be called when computing intervals or betti numbers.

> Also, why can't you just pass `_filtration_dict` as a list of simplicies to `SimplicialComplex` in `_simplicial_`? Related, ...

Yes this is much simpler, thank you !

Addendum: The way you have it implemented now is effectively a memory leak since you are always adding more stuff to the cache every time you run it.

Sorry for loosing track of this; I didn't get any notifications from trac that you pushed changes.

I think all of my and John's current comments have been taken into account, correct?

Can you provide a rebase onto the latest beta? I will continue my review at that point.

Indeed, you can see in the diff that [ZC2005] has accidentally been added twice. I have removed the duplicate reference.

I made a few other reviewer changes. Most of them are doc formatting. However, there are two big ones:

- I added an equality check.
- I changed `warnings` to `verbose` as it wasn't being used to warn the user but simply expressing that it changed its state.

I found two things that might be lacking: we cannot remove simplices nor raise the filtration value. The first is a feature that can be added later. The second, I am guessing it is for reasons of keeping things consistent? These aren't anything that would prevent me from giving a positive review, but it would be nice for some clarification for the latter (of course, the behaviour is documented, but why do we want this?).

John, do you have any other comments?
