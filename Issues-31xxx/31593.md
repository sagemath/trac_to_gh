<div id="comment:2" align="right">Comment 2</div>

Here's a basic solution (without a new macro) that is perhaps already good enough for the moment.

It is modeled after autotools' treatment of paths derived from ${prefix} such as `@exec_prefix@`.

In `ecl/spkg-configure.m4` you would put the quoted value `'${prefix}'/lib/ecl/maxima.fas` as `MAXIMA_FAS`.
