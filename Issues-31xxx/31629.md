The ticket #31536 merged to Sage 9.3.rc2 introduced a regression such that

```
sage: show('$x+1$')
```
displays a nicely rendered expression! Before, the same code displayed a verbatim string `$x+1$`. 

The symptom is related with how `html(...)` works. This

```
sage: html('$x+1$')
```
also renders the math in the string (before and after #31536).

This ticket introduces `strict` mode to `html()` to fix the regression. The patch is based on #31517.
