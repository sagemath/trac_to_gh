Currently, `number_field_elements_from_algebraics` only implements the `embedded` parameter if all the elements are real. This ticket extends this to number fields with embedding of (non-real) algebraic numbers.

```
sage: K, (ii, rt2), hom = number_field_elements_from_algebraics([QQbar(I), sqrt(2)], embedded=True)
sage: K
Number Field in a with defining polynomial y^4 + 1 with a = -0.7071067811865475? + 0.7071067811865475?*I
sage: QQbar(ii), QQbar(rt2)
(0.?e-19 + 1.000000000000000?*I, 1.414213562373095? + 0.?e-18*I)
```
In particular, this is useful for conversions from `QQbar` to the number field, which requires an embedding.

The real case was implemented in #20181. I am not sure if there is a reason why the complex case was skipped, as the homomorphism returned by `number_field_elements_from_algebraics(..., embedded=False)` already corresponds to an embedding.
