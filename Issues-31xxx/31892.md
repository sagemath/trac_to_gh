There is an actual mathematical issue here.  The map from `P^2` to the conic is defined everywhere by a single triple of polynomials, but the map from the conic to `P^1` cannot be defined by a single pair.

For example the familiar easiest example `X^2 + Y^2 = Z^2`

is parametrized by mapping `(u : v)` to

`(x : y : z) = (u^2 - v^2 : 2 u v : u^2 + v^2)`,

but the reverse map is given by mapping `(x : y : z)` to

`(u : v) = (x + z : y) = (y : z - x)`

where

- the first formula `(x + z : y)` is defined away from `(-1 : 0 : 1)`
- and the second `(y : z - x)` away from `(1 : 0 : 1)`,
- and where they are both defined they agree.

That's the way maps between curves works.

Maps betwee (Sage) Schemes should be capable of being defined on patches like this.

The docstring for the method `parametrization()` does have the

```
Warning "The second map is currently broken
and neither the inverse nor well-defined."
```
which while not being grammatical does give a warning.

Moreover, we have `(x^2+xy : xy + y^2) = (x(x+y) : y(x+y)) = (x : y)`, so the output of `g*f` really is the identity map, and the same holds for `f*g`. So this is correct so far. Then the following is all incorrect:\n\n```\ng(P)\nValueError: [0, 0] does not define a valid point since all entries are 0\n(g*f).is_one()\nFalse\n(f*g).is_one()\nFalse\nsage: C.Hom(C).one() == f*g\nFalse\nsage: (x,y,z) = C.gens(); C.hom([x,y,z],C) == f*g                                                   \nFalse\n```\nSomething indeed needs to be done about this.

The warning [mentioned](#comment%3A2) by John refers to this ticket, so there seems to be no reason to doubt the output of parametrization.",

The inverse is correct in both examples at this ticket description, but the way it works in [SageMath](SageMath) is a little bit broken.

Here's what I get in version 9.5. I'm using `paramatrization(P)` in order to replicate the ticket description's example, because `parametrization` is randomized if you don't specify a point.

```

sage: P = C([0,0,1])                                                            
sage: (f, g) = C.parametrization(P); (f, g)

You can see from the output of `representatives` that `g` really knows that the first formula is not defined at all points and hence there is a second formula stored inside `g`, which does work in `(0:0:1)`. This agrees with what John [explained](#comment%3A2). Moreover, we have `(x^2+xy : xy + y^2) = (x(x+y) : y(x+y)) = (x : y)`, so the output of `g*f` really is the identity map, and the same holds for `f*g`. So this is correct so far. Then the following is all incorrect:

```
g(P)
ValueError: [0, 0] does not define a valid point since all entries are 0
(g*f).is_one()
False
(f*g).is_one()
False
sage: C.Hom(C).one() == f*g
False
sage: (x,y,z) = C.gens(); C.hom([x,y,z],C) == f*g                                                   
False
```
Something indeed needs to be done about this. The following indicates that we are very close.

```
sage: g.representatives()[1](P)
(1 : 1)
sage: (f*g).representatives()[0]                                                                
Scheme endomorphism of Projective Conic Curve over Finite Field of size 2 defined by x^2 + x*y + y^2 + x*z + y*z
  Defn: Defined on coordinates by sending (x : y : z) to
        (x : y : z)
```
Here are some other things that don't work:

```
sage: (f*g).representatives()[0].is_one()
False
sage: C.Hom(C).one().is_one()
TypeError: ...
sage: (g*f).representatives()                                                                   
AttributeError: ...
```
But I don't know enough about the inner workings of [SageMath](SageMath) schemes to fix it.

ps. The warning [mentioned](#comment%3A2) by John refers to this ticket, so there seems to be no reason to doubt the output of parametrization.

I see that #33953 was changed 4 days ago. Does that mean that this ticket needs work as well?

By the way, this ticket fixes `(g*f).is_one()`, but leaves `(f*g).is_one()` incorrect. Could something be done about that at the same time, or would that need a separate ticket? With either example from the ticket description, I get

```
sage: (f*g).is_one()
False
sage: (f*g).representatives()[0]
Scheme endomorphism of Projective Conic Curve over ... defined by ...
  Defn: Defined on coordinates by sending (x : y : z) to
        (x : y : z)
```
The first output should be `True`. The parametrization is correct as shown by the second output.

Yes. There is a merge conflict. I will soon push the merge with #33953.

Right. `(g*f).is_one()` works correctly because g*f is a morphism of a projective line, where equality check works correctly. `f*g` gives wrong result because correct equality check is not done(not implemented) for morphisms of projective subschemes.

I suggest to open a separate ticket to solve the problem of `f*g`.

Tests pass. Code looks good. Just one thing before giving this a positive review:

Could you change the following mathematically incorrect example?

```
sage: C = Curve(x^2 + y^2 - z^2)
sage: A.<u> = AffineSpace(QQ, 1)
sage: f = C.hom([(x + z)/y], A)
sage: g = C.hom([y/(z - x)], A)
sage: f == g
True
```
The reason: it relies on mathematically incorrect behaviour of [SageMath](SageMath). There are no non-constant morphisms from C to A. Indeed, all non-constant morphisms from C to P<sup>1</sup> are surjective, hence do not land inside A. For example, f((1:0:1)) is not defined as an element of A. [SageMath](SageMath) incorrectly claims that f is a morphism, as follows:

```
sage: R.<x,y,z> = QQ[]                                                                                                      
sage: C = Curve(x^2 + y^2 - z^2)                                                                                            
sage: A.<u> = AffineSpace(QQ, 1)                                                                                            
sage: f = C.hom([(x + z)/y], A)                                                                                             
sage: f                                                                                                                     
Scheme morphism:
  From: Projective Conic Curve over Rational Field defined by x^2 + y^2 - z^2
  To:   Affine Space of dimension 1 over Rational Field
  Defn: Defined on coordinates by sending (x : y : z) to
        ((x + z)/y)
sage: f.parent()                                                                                                            
Set of morphisms
  From: Projective Conic Curve over Rational Field defined by x^2 + y^2 - z^2
  To:   Affine Space of dimension 1 over Rational Field
```
This behaviour is not introduced at this ticket, but was already there in e.g. [SageMath](SageMath) 9.5, so you do not need to fix it. But we should not add examples to the documentation that rely on this incorrect behaviour.
Perhaps you could change the example as follows:

```
sage: C = Curve(x^2 + y^2 - z^2)
sage: P.<u,v> = ProjectiveSpace(QQ, 1)
sage: f = C.hom([x + z, y], P)
sage: g = C.hom([y, z - x], P)
sage: f == g
True
```
And/or you could give constant examples with codomain A. And perhaps you could also add an h for which f == h is False.
