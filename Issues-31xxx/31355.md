lrcalc 2.1 is out https://bitbucket.org/asbuch/lrcalc/src/master/ChangeLog

Instead of rewriting Sage's Python bindings to support the new API, we replace them with a wrapper around the new upstream provided bindings

Upstream:

lrcalclib-2.1.tar.gz (lrcalc): https://sites.math.rutgers.edu/~asbuch/lrcalc/lrcalc-2.1.tar.gz
lrcalc-2.1.tar.gz (lrcalc_python): https://pypi.io/packages/source/l/lrcalc/lrcalc-2.1.tar.gz

CC:  @antonio-rojas @anneschilling @fchapoton @tscrim @thierry-freebsd @orlitzky @mkoeppe @kiwifb @asbuch @slel

Keywords: upgrade, lrcalc

Actually, they are almost equivalent to the current bindings in Sage. The attached branch replaces lrcalc.pyx with a thin wrapper over lrcalc's bindings.

It mostly just translates the output from lrcalc to sage notation. The only function of lrcalc.pyx that isn't straghtforward to port is quantum multiplication: I found no way to recover the q-grading from lrcalc's output, so this is reimplemented in the patch.

The branch needs an update of lrcalc to include python bindings.

I changed the version to "2.0.0" and thought that was in line with [this page](https://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual/html_node/Updating-version-info.html).  Please let me know if I am doing something wrong.

We cannot use Python packages from the system, see #29023.

An SPKG providing both a library and Python bindings to it should be split into 2 SPKGs.

Then maybe sage shouldn't support using system lrcalc 2.x for now, the bindings and the C library should obviously be kept at the same version.

In any case, the sagelib side should be ready now, please someone else take care of the build side.

Yes, that's good; best to add `"wheel"` in requires too.

This is actually Sage-specific, not related to Python packaging, so not a task for you as the upstream author.

"Best practices" on your side would be to create a source distribution for the Python library, using `setup.py sdist` and to upload it to PyPI.  On the Sage packaging side, we can then use that as our upstream for a `lrcalc_python` SPKG.

The thing is that the API changes in lrcalc 2 require an almost complete rewrite of sage's interface, which would essentially make it a duplicate of your python bindings, and doing that doesn't make much sense to me.

Another solution would be to include a copy of your pyx in sage, if the licence allows it.

No need to worry about this. It is the responsibility of the user to install the C library. This is normal.

But it would be a good idea to explain this in the Python package's README (which would appear in the "Project description" at https://test.pypi.org/project/lrcalc/#description)

See https://pypi.org/project/pplpy/ for inspiration.

<a id='comment:89'></a>Some comments:

Shouldn't the doc for `def _lrcalc_dict_to_sage(result):` go after the implementation?

I think the extra `dict` call here is unnecessary:

```diff
-return dict({_Partitions(i):Integer(k) for i,k in result.items()})
+return {_Partitions(la): Integer(k) for la,k in result.items()}
```
(I changed the variable to make it more clear that it is a partition being returned.)

```diff
-return dict({tuple(_Partitions(j) for j in i):Integer(k) for i,k in result.items()})
+return {tuple(_Partitions(mu) for mu in la): Integer(k) for la,k in result.items()}
```
Also, is the `list` call necessary here?

```diff
-return dict({Permutation(list(i)):Integer(k) for i,k in result.items()})
+return {Permutation(list(la)): Integer(k) for la,k in result.items()}
```

For speed and memory usage (1 object instead of 2):

```diff
     for i,k in result.items():
-        output[_Partitions(i[0])] = output.get(_Partitions(i[0]), P.zero()) + k*quantum**(i[1])
+        la = _Partitions(i[0])
+        output[la] = output.get(la, P.zero()) + k*quantum**(i[1])
```

I believe this could be simplified:

```diff
-        while True:
-            try:
-                word = Word([i+1 for i in next(iterator)])
-                yield SkewTableaux().from_shape_and_word(shape, word)
-            except StopIteration:
-                break
+        ST = SkewTableaux()
+        for data in iterator:
+            yield ST.from_shape_and_word(shape, Word([i+1 for i in data]))
```
and similarly if `weight` is given. However, I think it would make sense to make `wt = tuple(weight)` and then get the weight of the word (perhaps before even constructing `Word`) first to avoid creating transient objects. We also don't need `word` to be a subclass of `Word`; a `list` is sufficient.

<a id='comment:9'></a>Does Sage's auto-download mechanism automatically rename the tarballs to their appropriate values. I am worried that both tarballs (lib and python) are called `lrcalc-2.1.tar.gz` on their respective upstream locations.

I made a few other little tweaks and checked the tests. If my changes are good, then it is a positive review.
