lrcalc 2.1 is out https://bitbucket.org/asbuch/lrcalc/src/master/ChangeLog

Instead of rewriting Sage's Python bindings to support the new API, we replace them with a wrapper around the new upstream provided bindings

Upstream:

lrcalclib-2.1.tar.gz (lrcalc): https://sites.math.rutgers.edu/~asbuch/lrcalc/lrcalc-2.1.tar.gz
lrcalc-2.1.tar.gz (lrcalc_python): https://pypi.io/packages/source/l/lrcalc/lrcalc-2.1.tar.gz

Some information from Anders:

> I recently put out a new version of my lrcalc program, much of it is
> rewritten, and some of the most important functions are close to twice as fast
> as before.  Some special cases have also been optimized to run a lot faster.

>
> I have included some (pure) Python3 bindings in the repository, so I think
> this update will be easy.  But I don't understand Sage well enough to do it
> myself.

For reference, some pointers:

Actually, they are almost equivalent to the current bindings in Sage. The attached branch replaces lrcalc.pyx with a thin wrapper over lrcalc's bindings.

It mostly just translates the output from lrcalc to sage notation. The only function of lrcalc.pyx that isn't straghtforward to port is quantum multiplication: I found no way to recover the q-grading from lrcalc's output, so this is reimplemented in the patch.

The branch needs an update of lrcalc to include python bindings.

If my bindings are used, then that will make it easier to keep things compatible if I make more changes to the C interface.  I should be able to keep the Python interface stable, at least up to reordering of output.

Quantum function: I will add a function mult_quantum_pairs that returns a dict from ((partition),d) to integers, you can switch to that if you want.

setup.py: Does the following include the tags you are looking for?  Suggestions welcome!

I changed the version to "2.0.0" and thought that was in line with [this page](https://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual/html_node/Updating-version-info.html).  Please let me know if I am doing something wrong.

Sorry for the moving target.  However, 2.1 should bring only more speed and no new problems.

We cannot use Python packages from the system, see #29023.

An SPKG providing both a library and Python bindings to it should be split into 2 SPKGs.

Then maybe sage shouldn't support using system lrcalc 2.x for now, the bindings and the C library should obviously be kept at the same version.

In any case, the sagelib side should be ready now, please someone else take care of the build side.

Is this the `pyproject.toml` that you need? If so, then I can add that.

```
[build-system]
requires = ["setuptools", "cython"]
build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"

Yes, that's good; best to add `"wheel"` in requires too.

This is actually Sage-specific, not related to Python packaging, so not a task for you as the upstream author.

"Best practices" on your side would be to create a source distribution for the Python library, using `setup.py sdist` and to upload it to PyPI.  On the Sage packaging side, we can then use that as our upstream for a `lrcalc_python` SPKG.

The thing is that the API changes in lrcalc 2 require an almost complete rewrite of sage's interface, which would essentially make it a duplicate of your python bindings, and doing that doesn't make much sense to me.

Another solution would be to include a copy of your pyx in sage, if the licence allows it.

No need to worry about this. It is the responsibility of the user to install the C library. This is normal.

But it would be a good idea to explain this in the Python package's README (which would appear in the "Project description" at https://test.pypi.org/project/lrcalc/#description)

Some comments:

Shouldn't the doc for `def _lrcalc_dict_to_sage(result):` go after the implementation?

I think the extra `dict` call here is unnecessary:

```diff
-return dict({_Partitions(i):Integer(k) for i,k in result.items()})
+return {_Partitions(la): Integer(k) for la,k in result.items()}
```
(I changed the variable to make it more clear that it is a partition being returned.)

```diff
-return dict({tuple(_Partitions(j) for j in i):Integer(k) for i,k in result.items()})
+return {tuple(_Partitions(mu) for mu in la): Integer(k) for la,k in result.items()}
```
Also, is the `list` call necessary here?

```diff
-return dict({Permutation(list(i)):Integer(k) for i,k in result.items()})
+return {Permutation(list(la)): Integer(k) for la,k in result.items()}
```

For speed and memory usage (1 object instead of 2):

```diff
     for i,k in result.items():
-        output[_Partitions(i[0])] = output.get(_Partitions(i[0]), P.zero()) + k*quantum**(i[1])
+        la = _Partitions(i[0])
+        output[la] = output.get(la, P.zero()) + k*quantum**(i[1])
```

I believe this could be simplified:

```diff
-        while True:
-            try:
-                word = Word([i+1 for i in next(iterator)])
-                yield SkewTableaux().from_shape_and_word(shape, word)
-            except StopIteration:
-                break
+        ST = SkewTableaux()
+        for data in iterator:
+            yield ST.from_shape_and_word(shape, Word([i+1 for i in data]))
```
and similarly if `weight` is given. However, I think it would make sense to make `wt = tuple(weight)` and then get the weight of the word (perhaps before even constructing `Word`) first to avoid creating transient objects. We also don't need `word` to be a subclass of `Word`; a `list` is sufficient.

Actually `spkg-configure` didn't work at all because it was using C++ instead of C. Fixed it now and added a check for a header only present in 2.1 so it will fail with older versions.

Fixed the license too, should be ready to go now.
