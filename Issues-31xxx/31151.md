Non-verbose `sage -i` would make
for a more pleasant default.

Related:

- #21589: Allow users to make `make V=0` the default by using `./configure --enable-silent-rules`

Once #21589 is in, this may just be a matter
of using the `--enable-silent-rules` flag
for `configure`  when preparing binaries.

Depends on #21589
