We define a subclass of `ManifoldSubset`, instances of which represent the image of a continuous map.

In particular, this will allow an embedded submanifold to be considered as a subset of the ambient manifold.

<a id='comment:13'></a>Yes, I have two comments:

- I advocate f-strings:

   {{{#!diff
   -        return "Image of the {}".format(self._map)
   +        return f"Image of the {self._map}"
   }}}
   More readable and even (slightly) faster.
- I don't quite get the purpose of
   {{{#!python
return self._map(preimage) == point
   }}}
   Isn't that always true if `preimage in self._map.domain()` is already met (and the inverse is correctly defined)?

Sounds legitimate.
