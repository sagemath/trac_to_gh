`sage-pip-uninstall` is invoked before installing a Python package to "force-uninstall" an existing installation. This (1) predates the use of the staging install (`DESTDIR`), which we use for all Python packages; (2) depends on packages supporting `setup.py --name`.

As a step toward retiring this mechanism, we 
- do not call `sage-pip-uninstall` for PEP-517 packages without `setup.py`
- make it only a warning if the `sage-pip-uninstall` script fails.

This is necessary for some upgrades attempted in #31280 and also works around a failure observed on `cygwin-standard` (likely because `setup.py --name` printed extra output that the script cannot parse) -https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/1943937811

 `sage-pip-uninstall` is invoked before installing a Python package to "force-uninstall" an existing installation. This (1) predates the use of the staging install (`DESTDIR`), which we use for all Python packages; (2) depends on packages supporting `setup.py --name`.
 
 As a step toward retiring this mechanism, we 
-- do not call `sage-pip-uninstall` for PEP-517 packages
+- do not call `sage-pip-uninstall` for PEP-517 packages without `setup.py`
 - make it only a warning if the `sage-pip-uninstall` script fails.
 
 This is necessary for some upgrades attempted in #31280 and also works around a failure observed on `cygwin-standard` (likely because `setup.py --name` printed extra output that the script cannot parse) -https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/1943937811
