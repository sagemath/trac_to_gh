(from #29913)

​https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/1583194874?check_suite_focus=true

We apply a simple fix similar to the one in #30576.

To test: `tox -e docker-ubuntu-bionic-standard`

Something has changed on `ubuntu-bionic` since the fixes we made for Sage 9.2 (#30576). Now system python3.6 misbehaves although all `LC_*/LANG` variables are unset.

The specific failure can be fixed like this:

```diff

but after that some individual doctest have similar unicode errors.  
Setting the locale (for example `LANG=C.UTF-8 make ptest`) fixes all of these errors.
