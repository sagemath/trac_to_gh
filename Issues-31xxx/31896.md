Currently the following code fails:

```
A.<x> = AffineSpace(QQ,1)
f = DynamicalSystem_affine(x^2 + x + 1)
F = f.homogenize(1)
F.field_of_definition_periodic(1)
```

As the dehomogenization of F has x as its variable, not x0. Similar code fails for field_of_definition_critical and field_of_definition_preimage.

We implement a fix by using x for arithmetic, not x0.
