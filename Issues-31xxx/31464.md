<a id='comment:6'></a>There's a test failure (no attribute `mod_DS`); you can click on the yellow question mark for details.  There's also a plugin failure from style issues in your documentation (see also notes below).

Style changes:
* Use spaces after commas (and not before), and around +, *, / and = (except in keyword arguments like `dS.mod(p=5)`).
* Description should use "return" rather than "returns" and could probably be rephrased as "Whether this dynamical system has good reduction at the given prime"
* For mod, I would suggest using an `EXAMPLES` block rather than a `TESTS` block

Code questions/suggestions:
* Why do you need to copy self?  I wouldn't expect any of these functions to change self in place.
* You shouldn't use a bare except, since it will catch KeyboardInterrupts.  Better practice is to either catch the specific error type, or at least use `except Exception:`
* You can just `return new_DS.degree_sequence(1)[0] == degree` rather than using an if statement.
* Rather than looping over `range(0, len(blah))` it's usually nicer to iterate over the object itself (e.g. `for poly in df_p_all:`)
* Even better: use a list comprehension like `coefficients = [poly.coefficients() for poly in DS.defining_polynomials()]`.

<a id='comment:11'></a>This seems like worthwhile functionality, but we should support number fields as well as function fields. The algorithm also seems a bit off. There are two options I see:

- 1. reducing modulo the prime using `change_ring`, normalizing coordinates and then checking if the degree of the reduced dynamical system is less than the original dynamical system

- 2. computing the resultant and then reducing the resultant modulo the prime. The dynamical system has good reduction if and only if the resultant is non zero.

Reducing using `change_ring` will be harder to code - there will probably be separate cases for number fields and function fields. On the other hand, the resultant computation will probably be slower.
