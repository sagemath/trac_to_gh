I made this change to fix something, but I will have to find exactly what was broken.

Anyway, looks very strange to me to use "deepcopy" to initiate a new element.

    "body": "<a id='comment:6'>Comment 6:</a>\nI also thought it looked strange, but I was thinking there was a reason for it (i.e., speed). However, by calling the `__init__()`, I don't see where there would be any benefits. There are still some uses of `deepcopy`, making feel a bit inconsistent. Yet, that is something that can be removed later.\n\nOne last thing, why did you remove only one block of the diagnostic (commented out) code?",

I also thought it looked strange, but I was thinking there was a reason for it (i.e., speed). However, by calling the `__init__()`, I don't see where there would be any benefits. There are still some uses of `deepcopy`, making feel a bit inconsistent. Yet, that is something that can be removed later.

One last thing, why did you remove only one block of the diagnostic (commented out) code?
