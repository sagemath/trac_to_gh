(from #29039#comment:78)

numpy's `spkg-install.in` runs `python3 lapack_conf.py` (i.e., correctly, with the Sage `python3`), but `lapack_conf.py` confusingly indicates `#!/usr/bin/env sage-bootstrap-python` (which is the wrong Python; but in `spkg-install.in`, the script is not called by the shell, so this `#!` is not actually interpreted). 

We remove this confusion in this ticket, but there is no functional change.
