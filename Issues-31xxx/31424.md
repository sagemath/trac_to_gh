Consider the following with Sage 9.0:

```
sage: k=26
sage: bool(2/(2*pi)^(2*k) <= abs(bernoulli(2*k)/factorial(2*k)))
False
```
This result is wrong:

```
sage: R = RealBallField(100)
sage: 2/R(2*pi)^(2*k) - abs(bernoulli(2*k))/factorial(2*k)
[-1.387129688041e-57 +/- 3.98e-70]
```

it seems the decision is taken according to floating-point arithmetic, but as we know, we cannot decide whether an expression is positive from its evaluation in floating-point arithmetic, due to rounding errors and cancellations:

```
sage: n(2/(2*pi)^(2*k) - abs(bernoulli(2*k)/factorial(2*k)), 53)
1.14702617601537e-56
sage: n(2/(2*pi)^(2*k) - abs(bernoulli(2*k)/factorial(2*k)), 100)
-1.3871296880407980731315151264e-57
```
The proper solution would be to evaluate the expression with either `RealIntervalField` or `RealBallField`.

The user interface could use some work, but `NotImplemented` means "I don't know." If a lack of precision is the problem, you can pass in a different `domain` over which to evaluate the relation:

```
sage: k = 26
sage: eq = 2/(2*pi)^(2*k) <= abs(bernoulli(2*k)/factorial(2*k))
sage: eq.test_relation()
NotImplemented
sage: eq.test_relation(domain=RealIntervalField(200))
True
sage: eq.test_relation(domain=RealBallField(200))
True
```

However the real benefit is in knowing that the answer was undetermined, rather than determined to be false.

> I'm not very familiar with this subsystem of Sage, but it strikes me as wrong to return `False` for `bool(unknown)`. Shouldn't this throw an exception?

Yes, arguably. This problem comes up frequently, and there has been a lot of discussion about it in the past. If I recall correctly, the argument against an exception is that the python data model defines how `__bool__()` and `__nonzero()__` should behave, and as a result, exceptions are not allowed in `bool(expr)`.

I can't find a statement anywhere that `__bool__` can't throw. What's true (and very reasonable) is that *if* it returns, it must return either `True` or `False`, but the official documentation says nothing about exceptions.

Indeed, throwing exceptions in `__bool__` not only *works*, but it's actually already happening in a few more or less standard situations: https://stackoverflow.com/a/52862551

Silently returning mathematically wrong results is *always* worse than anything that produces 
a correct result or visibly fails if it can't. This remains true even if the solution is considered hackish by some.

We're in agreement. This is the best ticket I was able to dig up with a quick search:

-  #17700: wrong symbolic results in case the answer is not known

Apparently a further issue is that maxima *also* does not distinguish between "known to be false" and "unknown," and we use maxima in some cases to obtain an answer.
