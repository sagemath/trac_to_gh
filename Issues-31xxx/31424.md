Consider the following with Sage 9.0:

```
sage: k=26
sage: bool(2/(2*pi)^(2*k) <= abs(bernoulli(2*k)/factorial(2*k)))
False
```
This result is wrong:

```
sage: R = RealBallField(100)
sage: 2/R(2*pi)^(2*k) - abs(bernoulli(2*k))/factorial(2*k)
[-1.387129688041e-57 +/- 3.98e-70]
```

The user interface could use some work, but `NotImplemented` means "I don't know." If a lack of precision is the problem, you can pass in a different `domain` over which to evaluate the relation:

```
sage: k = 26
sage: eq = 2/(2*pi)^(2*k) <= abs(bernoulli(2*k)/factorial(2*k))
sage: eq.test_relation()
NotImplemented
sage: eq.test_relation(domain=RealIntervalField(200))
True
sage: eq.test_relation(domain=RealBallField(200))
True
```

However the real benefit is in knowing that the answer was undetermined, rather than determined to be false.

Shouldn't this throw an exception?\n\nYes, arguably. This problem comes up frequently, and there has been a lot of discussion about it in the past. If I recall correctly, the argument against an exception is that the python data model defines how `__bool__()` and `__nonzero()__` should behave, and as a result, exceptions are not allowed in `bool(expr)`.",

> I'm not very familiar with this subsystem of Sage, but it strikes me as wrong to return `False` for `bool(unknown)`. Shouldn't this throw an exception?

Yes, arguably. This problem comes up frequently, and there has been a lot of discussion about it in the past. If I recall correctly, the argument against an exception is that the python data model defines how `__bool__()` and `__nonzero()__` should behave, and as a result, exceptions are not allowed in `bool(expr)`.

I can't find a statement anywhere that `__bool__` can't throw. What's true (and very reasonable) is that *if* it returns, it must return either `True` or `False`, but the official documentation says nothing about exceptions.

Indeed, throwing exceptions in `__bool__` not only *works*, but it's actually already happening in a few more or less standard situations: https://stackoverflow.com/a/52862551

Silently returning mathematically wrong results is *always* worse than anything that produces 
a correct result or visibly fails if it can't. This remains true even if the solution is considered hackish by some.

We're in agreement. This is the best ticket I was able to dig up with a quick search:

-  #17700: wrong symbolic results in case the answer is not known

Apparently a further issue is that maxima *also* does not distinguish between "known to be false" and "unknown," and we use maxima in some cases to obtain an answer.
