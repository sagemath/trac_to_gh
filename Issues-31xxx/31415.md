```
On each push to a branch in `sagemath/sagetrac-mirror`, it builds the HTML documentation and, if this succeeds, deploys it to netlify for easy inspection.
Example: https://62018055188ce050610e98a6--sagemath-tobias.netlify.app
Workflow runs: https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/actions/workflows/doc-build.yml


Once this ticket is merged, I will add a badge pointing to the github workflow (similar to the linting badge), where one then can get the url for this particular deployment. Due to various open issues at netlify, it is sadly not possible right now to set the deployment url to the branch name so we use the commit hash for this.

For pushes to the develop branch it deploys the docs to the 'production' website 
https://sagemath-tobias.netlify.app/

I've chosen netlify (say over github pages) mainly since it easily allows to push multiple versions of the same page under different urls (and does an intelligent diff so that the upload is smaller).

Related: https://github.com/sagemath/documentation/issues/24 #33263 #33294

Follow-up: 
- Change the deployment url to something more official. For this reason, I've created the site `sagemath-tobias.netlify.org`, so if you want to create an official sage account, `sagemath.netlify.org` is still available. Then one just needs to change the secrets in the github repo.

- Incorporate the post-fixes of https://github.com/sagemath/documentation into the main repo here, so that the preview looks the same as the published page.

- For pushes with tags (or to master), publish it on docs.sagemath.org website (for example using https://github.com/marketplace/actions/deploy-to-github-pages or by completely migrating to netlify).

Workflows are not run on forks by default, and you can disable a particular workflow in a fork. I think its more important that the workflow fails if it's not able to do what its supposed to do in the main repo.

The only stable url we have is the "production" webpage. And each deploy to this overrides the complete page. So it's not possible to only update one directory in the deployed page.
