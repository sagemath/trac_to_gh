On each push to a branch in `sagemath/sagetrac-mirror`, it builds the HTML documentation and, if this succeeds, deploys it to netlify for easy inspection.
Example: https://62018055188ce050610e98a6--sagemath-tobias.netlify.app
Workflow runs: https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/actions/workflows/doc-build.yml


Once this ticket is merged, I will add a badge pointing to the github workflow (similar to the linting badge), where one then can get the url for this particular deployment. Due to various open issues at netlify, it is sadly not possible right now to set the deployment url to the branch name so we use the commit hash for this.

For pushes to the develop branch it deploys the docs to the 'production' website 
https://sagemath-tobias.netlify.app/

I've chosen netlify (say over github pages) mainly since it easily allows to push multiple versions of the same page under different urls (and does an intelligent diff so that the upload is smaller).

Related: https://github.com/sagemath/documentation/issues/24 #33263 #33294

Follow-up: 
- Change the deployment url to something more official. For this reason, I've created the site `sagemath-tobias.netlify.org`, so if you want to create an official sage account, `sagemath.netlify.org` is still available. Then one just needs to change the secrets in the github repo.

- Incorporate the post-fixes of https://github.com/sagemath/documentation into the main repo here, so that the preview looks the same as the published page.

- For pushes with tags (or to master), publish it on docs.sagemath.org website (for example using https://github.com/marketplace/actions/deploy-to-github-pages or by completely migrating to netlify).

Yes, here is what I have for now.

On each push, it builds the documentation and deploys it to netlify. Example: https://61ffda629c2d6f02653112ff--sagemath-tobias.netlify.app/

However, what Harald says above is still true. Currently, there are symlinks in the documentation tree (to import static files), which yields to display errors. I have the same display problems locally (because I'm using WSL and Windows is not resolving the Linux symlinks). So that's something that still needs fixing. Any ideas how to remove the symlinks?

Sorry, should have provided an example. I think all subpages that are not `index.html` are affected, for example https://61ffda629c2d6f02653112ff--sagemath-tobias.netlify.app/reference/structure/sage/structure/sage_object.html. The problem is the symlink that normally resolves `_static` to the correct path. This doesn't work on netlify (nor github pages) and leads to the following error:

Why do you think so? If the secrets are not provided or missconfigured, then this workflow fails at this step, which I think is what you want.

Workflows are not run on forks by default, and you can disable a particular workflow in a fork. I think its more important that the workflow fails if it's not able to do what its supposed to do in the main repo.

If someone enables actions for a fork, then it's this persons responsibility to configure the actions according to her preferences. It's not our responsibility to think about how forks handle actions. (I know that some sage devs have forks whose only purpose is to more easily run the actions; but in this case you can disable the documentation workflow very easily in the ui and be done with it or just ignore the failed run).

The alternative is checking for the existence of the secrets. But if the secrets are misconfigured in the main repo, then the workflow would still succeed although its clearly not doing what its supposed to do. I think a robust main workflow is more important than no red workflow runs on forks.

Once this bug is fixed, we can directly link the "Documentation" badge to the preview url (which is then derived from the branch name). Or we just switch to a github-based workflow, where the action can simply post a message to the PR or add it as a status check.

The only stable url we have is the "production" webpage. And each deploy to this overrides the complete page. So it's not possible to only update one directory in the deployed page.
