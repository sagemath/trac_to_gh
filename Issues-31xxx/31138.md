In reponse to an [ask.sagemath question](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/53294/installing-optional-packages-infinite-loop/#54977) about package installation on windows, I linked to my documentation for a from-source installation on WSL.

Emmanuel Charpentier requested that I added this to the official documentation.

I've added a section on setting up WSL to en/installation/source.rst and a section which covers the steps needed to launch sage in WSL from the windows desktop or start menu to en/installation/launching.rst

Thanks for adding the documentation. The explanations are very good. Some small suggestions from my side:
- Did you tried it on WSL 2 with Ubunutu 20.04? Last time I tried, I run into serious problems, I think it was with ecl. On 20.10 it does work for me as well. Maybe this should be made more explicit in the explanation?
- You can restart the WSL instance more easily via `wsl --shutdown`.
- "I'd recommend" - I think the rest of the documentation is more in the "we" form, i.e. "we recommend" or "it is recommended".

I've just done an install (of 9.2) on Ubuntu 20.04, it compiled successfully and passed all the tests. However, Jupyter won't start, and I can't install the package that motivated me to do the WSL from source install in the first place.

I'll make the upgrade to 20.10 an instruction rather than a recommendation.

Thanks for the other suggestions.
