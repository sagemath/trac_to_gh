    "body": "For very large and challenging computations, most of the elements of the face lattice contain rather few atoms/bits. With little changes to the code, we can just collect the non zero chunks (64,128 or 256 bits).\n\nRoaringBitmap performs better (starting with maybe 100,000 bits, but not with less, as container contain 64k bits), but that would add an extra dependency and make things more complicated.\n\nTo avoid code duplications, we also gather some functions in `bitset_intrinsics.h` that work just the same (e.g. intersection and union).\n(This actually accounts for most changes by this ticket.)\n\nBefore (on #27103):\n\n```\nsage: P = polytopes.Birkhoff_polytope(5)

```
For very large and challenging computations, most of the elements of the face lattice contain rather few atoms/bits. With little changes to the code, we can just collect the non zero chunks (64,128 or 256 bits).

RoaringBitmap performs better (starting with maybe 100,000 bits, but not with less, as container contain 64k bits), but that would add an extra dependency and make things more complicated.

To avoid code duplications, we also gather some functions in `bitset_intrinsics.h` that work just the same (e.g. intersection and union).
(This actually accounts for most changes by this ticket.)

This is the last subsequent improvement in comparison to sage 8.9 mentioned in https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.01945.

Follow ups:
- Move things from `geometry/polyhedron/combinatorial_polyhedron` to a more general location.
- Some renamings for lattices in general `face` -> `element`.
- Expose to simplical complexes.
- Expose to lattice of flats of matroids.
