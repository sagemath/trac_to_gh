Let me note that the second case works already:

```
sage: L.<z> = LaurentPolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: LS.<y> = LazyLaurentSeriesRing(QQ)
sage: f = z^-2 + 1 + z
sage: g = 1/(y*(1-y)); g
y^-1 + 1 + y + y^2 + y^3 + y^4 + y^5 + ...
sage: f(g)
y^-1 + 2 + y + 2*y^2 - y^3 + 2*y^4 + y^5 + ...
```

Here is, why this works: the relevant line in `__call__` in `LaurentPolynomial_univariate` is

```
    return self.__u(x) * (x[0]**self.__n)
```
* `x` is a singleton tuple with the Laurent series as its only element, that is, `g` from above.
* `self.__n` is the valuation of the Laurent polynomial, that is `-2` in our case
* `x[0]**self.__n` therefore is the n-th power of the Laurent series
* `self.__u` is the polynomial obtained by multiplying the Laurent polynomial with z^-n
* `self.__u(x)` is therefore calling the `__call__` method of the polynomial ring, and this works for similar reasons.

It might be a good idea to briefly doctest this in the future `__call__` of `LazyLaurentSeries`.

I am not sure whether this is an efficient way to obtain the composition.  But that's certainly not important now.
