Fix the `submonoid` method so that we don't get two copies of the identity element when the generating set already includes the identity element.

```
sage: R = IntegerModRing(15)
sage: R.submonoid([R.one()]).list()         # this should be [1]
[1, 1]

sage: S = SymmetricGroup(4)
sage: S.submonoid([S.one()]).list()         # this should be [()]
[(), ()]

sage: S = SymmetricGroup(4)
sage: S.submonoid(list(S)).cardinality()    # this should be 24
25
```

Does this also fix duplicate generators?

```
sage: S = SymmetricGroup(4)
sage: M = S.submonoid([S[3], S[3]])
sage: M
A subgroup of (Symmetric group of order 4! as a permutation group)
with 2 generators
sage: M.list()
[(), (1,2)(3,4), (1,2)(3,4)]
```

Using `OrderedDict`, or just `dict` once we drop Python 3.6 support,
could help. See:
