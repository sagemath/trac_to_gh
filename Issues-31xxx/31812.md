`polygons3d` calls `sage.plot.plot3d.index_face_set.IndexFaceSetIndexFaceSet`, which should show the same graphic as calling `polygon3d` repeatedly.

```
sage: points = [(0, 0, 0), (1, 0, 0), (-1, 0, 0), (0, 0, 1), (0, 1, 0), (1, 0, 1), (1, 1, 0), (-1, 0, 1),

sage: faces = [[3, 0, 1, 5], [0, 4, 6, 1], [3, 0, 2, 7], [0, 4, 8, 2]]                                    
sage: polygons3d(faces, points, color='blue')                                
Graphics3d Object
```
This gives all black faces, instead of blue. It is different than

```
sage: sum(polygon3d([points[i] for i in face], color='blue') for face in faces)
Graphics3d Object
```

Same behavior here.
 
Blue with `viewer='jmol'` or `'tachyon'` but black with default `viewer='threejs'`.

Mysteriously, if I call `viewer='threejs'` after `viewer='jmol'` was used, then it shows blue.

```
p = polygons3d(faces, points, color='blue')
p.show()   # default is threejs, black
p.show(viewer='jmol') # blue
p.show(viewer='threejs') # now this mysteriously becomes blue
```
In any case, this is not a bug in `polygons3d` or `IndexFaceSet` then.
