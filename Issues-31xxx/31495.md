There is a didactic/pedagogical value in having a function "SR.symbols()" as a synonym for "SR.var()".

I don't understand. `SR.var()` is presently an error. Presently `SR.symbols` is a dictionary, so `SR.symbols()` is also an error. Do you want the two to raise the same error?

I am a strong -1 on making `SR.symbols` and `SR.var` synonymous. One is plural and the other is singular, and it shows in their semantics. There's a good reason for `SR.symbol` to behave differently: it should either produce a symbol with exactly the given string as identifier or raise an error: no processing. `var` is more a convenience function that way. Denoting it by the plural of `symbol` does not convey that.

I agree that the use of `var` can be a bit confusing, but I don't think `symbols` is a good substitute. In case of doubt, I am in support of maintaining the status quo. Change has a cost, so there should be a clear benefit beyond the taste of the developer involved.

Hello, @nbruin! Thank you for your comment. However, I didn't understand the part where you say that `SR.var()` is an error. I just tried `SR.var('x')` and I didn't get any error message. (I am just thinking that the use of the empty parentheses could be confusing. If that is the case, I use the notation where, for example, `clear` is a command---which doesn't require parameters---, and `print()` is a function.)

The intention behind having a `SR.symbols()` function with the same functionality as `SR.var()` is explained in @sagetrac-tmonteil's answer to the Ask [SageMath](../wiki/SageMath) question that I referenced in the ticket, part of which I cite: "I would vote +1 if there were a `SR.symbols` doing the same wrapping as `SR.var`"

Concerning the current meaning of `SR.symbols`, I have also made a ticket and a pull request to change it to `SR._symbols` here: [https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31494](https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31494) (mentioned in the "dependencies" field of this ticket). If accepted, it would leave the name `SR.symbols` free for defining @sagetrac-tmonteil's proposed function.

Please, let me know your thoughts on this matter!
