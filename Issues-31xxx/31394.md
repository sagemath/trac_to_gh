https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.05432 gives a construction of SRG(65, 32, 15, 16), which can be built as follows:

```
a=PermutationGroup([
 '(0)(1,17,2,18)(3,6,4,5)(7,31,8,32)(9,25,10,26)(11,14,12,13)(15,24,16,23)(19,22,20,21)(27,29,28,30)(33,35,34,36)(37,61,38,62)(39,55,40,56)(41,43,42,44)(45,53,46,54)(47,63,48,64)(49,52,50,51)(57,59,58,60)',

ee=reduce(lambda x,y: x+y, map(lambda o: a.orbit(o,action='OnSets'), oe))
ggg=Graph(ee,format='list_of_edges')
ggg.is_strongly_regular(parameters=True)
# (65, 32, 15, 16)
```

we should add this construction.

yes, this doctest missed a fix, now added in [comment:12](#comment%3A12). But I don't understand

```
because this can only happen if a test in lines 2966-8 of `src/sage/graphs/generators/smallgraphs.py`,
where this construction is added, also fails.

For me now `--long` tests pass (merged over 9.3.beta8), so I'm setting this to  positive review. Hopefully this will just work, and we don't need to dig deeper.

Oups...

Note that `make graphs-clean && make graphs` fails to download the package and in particular it don't try to use the specified `upstream_url` (why ?).  So I downloaded it manually and then all tests pass. 

I set this ticket back to positive review.

this only works if configure was run with `--enable-download-from-upstream-url`.
