`FinitePoset.meet(x, y)` computes the meet of two elements `x`, `y` in the poset, returning `None` if the meet doesn't exist.

Similar for `FinitePoset.join(x, y)`.

Currently, `FinitePoset._hasse_diagram` has `@lazy_attribute` `_meet` (resp. `_join`) and method `meet_matrix` (resp. `join_matrix`). However, they don't compute the matrix but raise an Error if the poset is not a meet/join-semilattice.

```
sage: from sage.combinat.posets.hasse_diagram import HasseDiagram                     
sage: h = HasseDiagram({0:[2], 1:[2,3], 2:[4], 3:[4], 4:[]})                
sage: h._meet   
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
ValueError: not a meet-semilattice: no bottom element
```

We propose to change `HasseDiagram._meet` (resp. `_join`), so that the `(x,y)`-entry of the matrix is `-1` if the meet of `x` and `y` doesn't exist, instead of raising an Error.  Defer the checks to `HasseDiagram.meet_matrix()` (resp. `join_matrix`).

For the poset `h` above, we expect:

```
h._meet[2,3]
1
h._meet[0,1]
-1
sage: h.meet_matrix()   
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
ValueError: not a meet-semilattice: no bottom element
```

Then, we make the method `FinitePoset.meet(x, y)` (resp. `join(x, y)`) by applying the `_element_to_vertex` and `_vertex_to_element` conversions on `poset._hasse_diagram._meet`.

This extends `meet` of a pair `x, y` in `FiniteMeetSemilattice` to non-semilattice finite poset. 

```
sage: P = Poset({"a":["b", "c", "d"], "b":["e", "f"], "c":["f"], "d":["f", "g"]}
....: )                                                                         
sage: M = MeetSemilattice(P)                                                    
sage: M.meet("f","g")                                                           
'd'
sage: P2 = Poset({"b":["e", "f"], "c":["f"], "d":["f", "g"]})                    
sage: M2 = MeetSemilattice(P)  
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
ValueError: not a meet-semilattice: no bottom element
```
For the posets `P` and `P2` above, we expect:

```
sage: P.meet("f","g")                                                           
'd'
sage: P2.meet("f","g")
'd'
```

In addition, `FinitePoset` has the method `common_upper_covers`. We propose to implement the method `common_lower_covers` as well, for symmetry and completeness.

In fact, I meant `FinitePoset.meet(x, y)` for two given elements x and y in the poset, even for poset such that `poset.has_bottom()` is `False`. Now reading the code more carefully, I realize that this is not exactly the same as `poset._hasse_diagram._meet`, which gives the `meet_matrix` in the case of a meet-semilattice and raises an error otherwise.

 In addition, `FinitePoset` has the method `common_upper_covers`. We propose to implement the method `common_lower_covers` as well, for symmetry and completeness.

The semilattice check can be quite slow with your proposal as it is done every time the `meet_matrix()` is called. I think you should define a new attribute `_semilattice_failure = None` on initialization. Then when `_meet` is called, it sets this attribute to an invalid pair (and perhaps `()` if successful). Then the check in `meet_matrix()` becomes:

```python
if (n != 0) and (not self.has_bottom()):
    raise ValueError("not a meet-semilattice: no bottom element")
# call the attribute to build the matrix and sets _semilattice_failure
mt = self._meet
if self._semilattice_failure:
    x, y = self._is_meet_semilattice
    raise LatticeError('meet', x, y)
