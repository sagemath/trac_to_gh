Following an initial report by Ask Sage user "Road" at

- [Ask Sage question 54375](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/54375)

Define a polynomial ring and its generators:

```
sage: R = PolynomialRing(QQ, 'a, b, c')
sage: a, b, c = R.gens()
```
The generators display well:

```
sage: latex(a)  # good
a
```
Now define a quotient of that ring modulo an ideal:

```
sage: I = R.ideal(a**2 + a + 1)
sage: S = R.quotient(I, names=R.variable_names()).fraction_field()
sage: a, b, c = S.gens()
```
The generators display poorly:

```
sage: latex(a)  # should be same as above
\text{\texttt{a}}
```

Adding a `_latex_` method in `sage/rings/quotient_ring_element.py`
addresses the issue.

This is done in this ticket.
