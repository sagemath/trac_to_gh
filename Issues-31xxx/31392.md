Error building Sage.

The following package(s) may have failed to build (not necessarily
during this run of 'make all-start'):

It is safe to delete any log files and build directories, but they
contain information that is helpful for debugging build problems.
WARNING: If you now run 'make' again, the build directory of the
same version of the package will, by default, be deleted. Set the

`locale: command not found` is not the problem here, this is just cosmetic.

`isirreducible: symbol not found` is what is causing the build error.
