`locale: command not found` is not the problem here, this is just cosmetic.

`isirreducible: symbol not found` is what is causing the build error.

<a id='comment:8'></a>
Now it builds on glibc (but not on musl).
The failures are with stuff that is already packaged in void, like python packages.
So it seems pointless to track those here, rather just wait for sage to complete the spkg ticket for python packages.
