I believe no. If you look at https://gitlab.inria.fr/zimmerma/ecm/-/releases/7.0.5 you first see "Source code" tarballs made automatically by gitlab, but they are of no use since they do no contain a configure file (the autotools were not run).

The "release tarball" was added manually by me, and the long hash was given to me by gitlab.

Indeed https://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/commit?id=f2619864f27c34b751e84d6a4d41d77cfbe39d9a seems to do similar as my patch, so you can just keep this ticket and ignore mine.

This shows that trac search is not very good: https://trac.sagemath.org/search?q=ecm doesn't show this ticket (no, I didn't look at the second page, given that the first page shows nothing relevant; yes, searching "upgrade ecm" gives this as the first hit).

The Trac "query" engine often beats its "search" engine.

https://trac.sagemath.org/query?order=id&desc=1&summary=~ecm

I added a few custom search engines to my browser
to send trac queries like the above, querying fields
"summary", "description", "author", "reviewer", etc.

Then typing `sagetracsummary ecm` (choose your keyword)
in the url bar goes to the above.

Or to query only non-closed tickets:

https://trac.sagemath.org/query?order=id&desc=1&status=!closed&summary=~ecm
