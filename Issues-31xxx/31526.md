`ubuntu-trusty` 14.04 is long past "standard support" and will reach its EOL in April 2022 (https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases), but several optional packages do not build on it because of an outdated compiler (gcc 4.x)

`debian-jessie` (8) is past EOL LTS, with EOL ELTS in June 2022 (https://wiki.debian.org/DebianReleases). Same situation with gcc 4.x.

`linuxmint-17` is past EOL (https://forums.linuxmint.com/viewtopic.php?t=289281). gcc 4.x

`centos-7` has EOL June 2024. gcc 4.x

We switch these systems in the GH Actions CI tests for optional packages to using the `gcc_spkg` configuration factor.


Next wave:
- `linuxmint-18` with gcc 5.4
- `slackware-14.2` with gcc 5.5

What's the recommended way around for users on this? `-without-system-gcc`? Can we test this?
