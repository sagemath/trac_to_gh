Python 3.9 deprecates the use `sample(population, k)` when `population` is a `set`. 

```
sage: G = graphs.RandomChordalGraph(100)                                                                                            
/Users/dcoudert/sage/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/sage/misc/prandom.py:179: DeprecationWarning: Sampling from a set deprecated
since Python 3.9 and will be removed in a subsequent version.
  return _pyrand().sample(population, k)
```
It was used in `graphs.RandomChordalGraph(...)`, so we change that.
