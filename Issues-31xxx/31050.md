On OS X Big Sur, there is a bug with our version of wheel — see https://github.com/pypa/wheel/issues/385. This prevents Sage from building if using a version of Python built with `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` set to 11, and it appears that this is the case for the recent homebrew version of Python 3.9.
