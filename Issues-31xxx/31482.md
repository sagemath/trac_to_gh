https://github.com/latte-int/latte/releases/tag/version_1_7_6

This version finds the moved cddlib headers (as well as headers in the old location).

We also make `lrslib` an optional dependency only. In contrast to the dependencies `4ti2` and `lidia`, at runtime LattE uses `lrslib` only when requested explicitly by a command-line option; and Sage does not pass this command-line option.

Critical because the critical cddlib upgrade (#30319) depends on it.
