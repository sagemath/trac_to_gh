Another thing to consider is a specific implementation for finitely presented groups as it would need to construct the confluent rewriting system and do the reductions upon every multiplication (preferably on the GAP side).

As far as I see the `multiplication_table()` method DOES belong to the category of magmas.

On the other hand, the issue with putting group elements into sets is a trap into which
unsuspecting users may easily fall, and thus I find it appropriate to issue a warning,
regardless of how the multiplication_table issue is eventually resolved.
(However, from what I saw from glancing through the sage documentation, "wrong" hashcodes
seems to be a fundamental issue of sage. But I did not see anywhere a warning that
sets would not work as expected.)

I am not sure I understand. Where should I write my real name?
Does a small clarification of the documentation qualify me to
add my name to the author list of the package.

For general magmas, we have no idea if there is a solution to the word problem. Of course, mathematically, this would be defined, but in order to actual make any computation, you need a solution to the word problem.\n\n> On the other hand, the issue with putting group elements into sets is a trap into which\n> unsuspecting users may easily fall, and thus I find it appropriate to issue a warning,\n> regardless of how the multiplication_table issue is eventually resolved.\n> (However, from what I saw from glancing through the sage documentation, \"wrong\" hashcodes\n> seems to be a fundamental issue of sage.

The mathematical one doesn't make sense to me because it is a table, which means we have put some ordering on the magma's elements. For the implementation, again, we want an ordering, so it would be a `list` and doesn't use hashing.\n\n> > Also, you should fill in your (real) name as the author.\n\n> \n> I am not sure I understand.

I disagree because it only makes computational sense for finite magmas. For general magmas, we have no idea if there is a solution to the word problem. Of course, mathematically, this would be defined, but in order to actual make any computation, you need a solution to the word problem.

I don't understand. I am not sure if you are making a mathematical or implementation argument. The mathematical one doesn't make sense to me because it is a table, which means we have put some ordering on the magma's elements. For the implementation, again, we want an ordering, so it would be a `list` and doesn't use hashing.

No, here on the ticket.

I had updated the documentation to be in line with the current state of the software.
You apparently did not notice that, on that occasion, I also adressed an issue with use of finitely generated group elements as set elements and dictionary keys:

```
The following example shows that two different representations of the
same element can result in two distinct elements of a "set"::

    sage: F.<r,s,t> = FreeGroup()
    sage: G = F / (r^2, s^3, t^3, r*s*t) # the tetrahedral group
    sage: G.order()
    12
    sage: a,b = G(r*s),G(~t) # ~t is an alternative notation for t^-1
    sage: set_of_2 = {a,b}
    sage: print(set_of_2, len(set_of_2)) # two-element set
    {r*s, t^-1} 2
    sage: a==b # a and b are the same element!
    True
```
I also added the workaround via permutation groups.

Should I open a different ticket for updating the documention? I am afraid fixing the multiplication_table as part of a comprehensive solution will require some fundamental design decisions and will not be done soon.

Documenting a separate issue (which does deserve to be documented) does not solve the problem of this ticket. So that should be a separate ticket. Fixing the multiplication table for a finitely presented group is not hard if you use `list(G)` and `==` checking. Basically you just need to have `get_row = self._elts.index` in `sage.matrix.operation_table.OperationTable.__init__` for FPGs.

OK, but this is not specific to the multiplication table.
Nearly ALL methods for finitely generated groups are not guaranteed to finish. There is already a warning about this in the documentation.
But sometimes they DO finish. (e.g. the order() method in my example).
I think if sage (or GAP) is able to figure out the order or the group and the order is reasonably small, it is not
unreasonable to expect that it should be possible to construct a multiplication table.

I am unsure whether the error in multiplication_table has "nothing to do with hashing or constructing a set/dict." The `KeyError` seems to indicate that a dict might be involved. Using `==` might slow down things, but probably acceptable for those cases
where one would want a multiplication table.

I guess this type of conversion and  `==` checking is already done anyway when converting to a permutation group, so it would be the easiest solution to piggyback on the multiplication table for permutation groups.

Anyway, I have opened a new ticket, #31311. (have to figure out how to associate the git branch with a new ticket)

Are there any issues to which I should still respond?

This is an implementation detail for optimization that is coming back to bite us in this special case. Here is a proposal for fixing the multiplication table to use the list as a fallback.

> I guess this type of conversion and  `==` checking is already done anyway when converting to a permutation group, so it would be the easiest solution to piggyback on the multiplication table for permutation groups.

There would be a disassociation of the FPG with the multiplication table as it wouldn't be able to hold on to that information in a natural way.

You just need to put the branch name in the ticket's branch field (if you aren't using the git trac commands).

But I am not sure whether anyone might ever want to look at such large multiplication tables. So I guess it is tolerable.

We loose the association with the elements of the FPG by going to another group. This defeats the purpose of the code. If someone wants to use a perm group, then they can (and should IMO) just convert it themselves.

Then does that constitute a review? The patchbot is green. If so, then you can put your name as the reviewer and set it to a positive review.
