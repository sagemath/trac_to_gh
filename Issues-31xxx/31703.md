We implement presheaves and sheaves over manifolds. Parts that can benefit from this implementation are:

- charts
- frames
- vector bundle sections
- tensor fields
- scalar fields

We implement mix-in classes for the parents as well as for its elements, endowed with a restriction method and a `_domain` attribute. We use a qoset (poset) structure to benefit from digraphs which allow efficient relations between the restrictions. See also #31740, #31771 and #31680.
