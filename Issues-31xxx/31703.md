We implement presheaves and sheaves over manifolds. Parts that can benefit from this implementation are:

- charts
- frames
- vector bundle sections
- tensor fields
- scalar fields

We implement mix-in classes for the parents as well as for its elements, endowed with a restriction method and a `_domain` attribute. We use a qoset (poset) structure to benefit from digraphs which allow efficient relations between the restrictions. See also #31740, #31771 and #31680.

Depends on #31785

> What I meant is that your sections often have additional structure. For example, if you consider the presheaf $F$ of sections of a bundle of groups, then you can naturally multiply two such sections, i.e there are maps $F(U) \times F(U) \to F(U)$ for every open subset $U$ induced by the group multiplication. For example, the wedge product of differential forms can be described in such a way.

This behavior will naturally be captured by the corresponding parent of sections.
