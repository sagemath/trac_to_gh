Indeed.  This 1 could either have the default precision of the ring or the precision of `x` in the `x^(exact 0)` being computed.  The first option seems the most logical to me since `x^(exact 0)` is 1 independently of (the precision of) `x`.

I think the first option is the most sensible. Now there is another issue of `0^0`:

    507         else:

```
To match !Sage/Python, this should also return `1`. I also think `0` should be special-cased in the exponentiation as `R(0)^R(1)` also fails.

I am okay with letting this ticket go as-in, but I think it would be better to fix this other issue here.

I think `0^a` should only be 0 if `a` is an exact zero, not if `a` is an inexact zero.  For example, `0<sup>(p</sup>100)` should be 0 for compatibility with the integers.

This already works (with the current patch) in capped relative precision:

```
sage: R = Zp(2)
sage: R(0)^R(0)
1 + O(2^20)
sage: R(0)^(O(2^20))
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: in order to raise to a p-adic exponent, base must be a unit
```
The reason `R(0)^R(0)` fails in your example (and should fail, in my opinion) is that exact zero does not exist when working in capped absolute precision.

Things like `R(0)^(inexact element)` are not well defined; for example, there is no way of knowing whether `x^(1 + O(p^n))` should mean `x^1` (i.e. `x`) or something else like `x^(1 - p^n)`, which is in general completely different (or even undefined if `x = 0`).
