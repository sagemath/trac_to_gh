I was able to successfully build Sage on M1 (see #30592) but had two main types of doctest errors.

<div id="comment:6" align="right">comment:6</div>

These defaults in cvxopt's setup.py can be overridden using environment variables
`CVXOPT_SUITESPARSE_INC_DIR`, `CVXOPT_SUITESPARSE_LIB_DIR`.
We already set these variables when we build our own `suitesparse` (then `SAGE_SUITESPARSE_PREFIX` is nonempty). 

On macOS, we could just set these variables also (to something arbitrary) when system suitesparse is in use.

See also [#33083 comment:40](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/33083#comment:40) - a related issue on `alpine`.
