I was able to successfully build Sage on M1 (see #30592) but had two main types of doctest errors.

<div id="comment:6" align="right">Comment 6</div>

These defaults in cvxopt's setup.py can be overridden using environment variables
`CVXOPT_SUITESPARSE_INC_DIR`, `CVXOPT_SUITESPARSE_LIB_DIR`.
We already set these variables when we build our own `suitesparse` (then `SAGE_SUITESPARSE_PREFIX` is nonempty). 

On macOS, we could just set these variables also (to something arbitrary) when system suitesparse is in use.

See also [#33083 comment:40](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/33083#comment:40) - a related issue on `alpine`.

`setup.py` still says

```
if sys.platform.startswith("darwin"):
    # macOS
    SUITESPARSE_LIB_DIR = '/usr/local/lib'
    SUITESPARSE_INC_DIR = '/usr/local/include'
```
and `/opt` is not found anywhere in that file, and looking at the log file, I don't know how it's finding the suitesparse libraries.

can one build Sage's `suitsparse` on M2, and use it to build `cvxopt`?
If so, we can close it.
