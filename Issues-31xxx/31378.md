The goal of this ticket is to create a new module for morphic words.

As a consequence, it will improve the following computations which take a lot of time:


```
sage: m = WordMorphism('a->ab,b->a')
sage: w = m.fixed_point('a')
sage: w
word: abaababaabaababaababaabaababaabaababaaba...
sage: %time w[1000]
CPU times: user 1.45 ms, sys: 0 ns, total: 1.45 ms
Wall time: 1.45 ms
'a'
sage: %time w[10000]
CPU times: user 82.9 ms, sys: 0 ns, total: 82.9 ms
Wall time: 82.1 ms
'a'
sage: %time w[100000]
CPU times: user 5.19 s, sys: 6.26 ms, total: 5.2 s
Wall time: 5.19 s
'b'
sage: %time w[1000000]
CPU times: user 12min 45s, sys: 93.4 ms, total: 12min 45s
Wall time: 12min 45s
'a'
```

```
sage: m = WordMorphism("a->ab,b->,c->cdab,d->dcab")
sage: w = m.fixed_point("a")

```

What is the remaining problem you mention in the commit message? Can you provide an example?


In the following, the multiplication `vMk*M` is computed twice. Maybe you want to write `vMk1 = vMk*M` to represent `vM^{k+1}` and at the end of the loop, you may do `vMk = vMk1`.

```diff
         while vMk[position] <= n:
+            if vMk == vMk*M:
+                raise ValueError('The morphism has a finite fixed point of length {}.'.format(vMk[position]))
             vMk = vMk*M
             length_of_images.append(vMk)
```

I would suggest that the error message also include the value of `n`. Something like `IndexError: index (=2) out of range, the fixed point is finite and has length 2`.

I think the error should be an `IndexError` instead of `ValueError`, as it is for strings:

```
sage: s = 'ab'                                                                  
sage: s[2]

> More generally, when the growth of `|sigma^n(letter)|` is polynomial (and not exponential) then going via the representation is not a good idea.


Well if the growth rate of the `|sigma^n(letter)|` is quadratic this ticket does an improvement. Here is an example:

On 9.5.beta0:

```
sage: s = WordMorphism('a->abc,b->bc,c->c')                                     
sage: w = s.fixed_point('a')                                                    
sage: %time w[1000000]                                                          
CPU times: user 6.45 s, sys: 11.5 ms, total: 6.46 s
Wall time: 6.46 s
'c'
```

On 9.5.beta0 + #31378:

```
sage: s = WordMorphism('a->abc,b->bc,c->c')                                     
sage: w = s.fixed_point('a')                                                    
sage: %time w[1000000]                                                          
CPU times: user 28.5 ms, sys: 51 µs, total: 28.6 ms
Wall time: 28.4 ms
'c'
```

Here it grows quadratically:

```
sage: for i in range(10): u = s('a', i); print(len(u), u)                       
1 a
3 abc
6 abcbcc
10 abcbccbccc
15 abcbccbcccbcccc
21 abcbccbcccbccccbccccc
28 abcbccbcccbccccbcccccbcccccc
36 abcbccbcccbccccbcccccbccccccbccccccc
45 abcbccbcccbccccbcccccbccccccbcccccccbcccccccc
55 abcbccbcccbccccbcccccbccccccbcccccccbccccccccbccccccccc
```

The problem is when the images grow linearly. Question: can we detect that?
