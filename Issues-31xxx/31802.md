# Issue 31802: Bug in plotting 3d polyhedron with rays, add option polygon='rainbow'

Visually, there is no different between the two plots:

```
p = Polyhedron(rays=[(0, 0, 1)],lines=[(1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0)])
p.plot()
q = Polyhedron(lines=[(1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0)])
q.plot()
```
The bug seems to be caused by `sage.geometry.polyhedron.Projection._init_solid_3d`, which discards the rays. There might also be a bug in `sage.geometry.polyhedron.Projection._init_lines_arrows`, but I'm not sure how to plot the arrows in this example.
