This ticket intends to extend, standardize, optimize and test parents with multiple implementations. Especially regarding
- argument names (`implementation` vs `impl` vs `backend`)
- string representation
- reconstruction (should be part of `TestSuite`)
- conversion of elements between implementations
- handling of default constructor
