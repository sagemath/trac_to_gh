The following are painfully slow:

```
sage: x1 = AA(2^(1/100))
sage: x2 = AA(2^(1/100))
sage: y = x1 - x2
sage: z = x1 - x2
sage: y == y
sage: y == 0
sage: y == z
```
Note that for testing, you need to recreate `y` before each comparison as otherwise it has been made exact.

We avoid computing the minimum polynomial (as it calls `exactify()`) in the rich comparison until we need to. We also avoid calling `exactify()` for a binary operation in `sign()` until we absolutely need to. Additionally, the identity test is not done before reaching `_richcmp_`.

I have not run any timings on this, but things to check for speed regressions would be low degree minimal polynomials. Suggestions for good timing tests would be useful.

I don't completely understand why I need to update some of the test for the eigenvalues, but the real precision seems to have significantly improved. So there might be some other doctests that need fixing; waiting for the patchbot.

I also took the change to mark a test as `# long time` that was taking nearly 2 seconds on my computer.

When precision increases it is typically that more enclosure refinement occurred. With the new code it looks to me that we should have less refinement. If my diagnostic is correct, this is bad. Would be nice to check what are the diameters of the intervals before and after the change.

This is occurring after a call to `exactify()`. Thus, we could have something that ends up being a rational that didn't know it before. For example, `b = a - (a + 1)` for some irrational `a`, then taking `b + 1 == 0`). Adding a `print("rat check")` just after the `if` statement gives:

```sage
sage: a = AA(sqrt(2))
sage: b = a - (a + 1)
sage: (b + 1).sign()
rat check
0
```
I will add this as a test and push. I also need to figure out why the test in `src/sage/geometry/polyhedron/backend_field.py` is failing too...

Here is what is happening. Because we are sorting the (complex) roots, we compare things lex on the `(real, imag)` pair. Eventually it has to check that the real parts of the two numbers are not equal (see `case 3:`). This calls the real `_richcmp_` method. In here, before it computed the `minpoly()` (which called `exactify()` of the treal parts), whereas now only gets the minpoly if they are known, so it first tries the refinement before ultimately ended up calling `exactify()` (as both are supposed to actually be 0). This gets called when comparing these roots with a root that is explicitly known with a real part of 0.

I don't think this is a bad thing as I believe the refinement is a relatively fast operation, especially if we ultimately compute `exactify()` on most elements. Also, getting rid of calls to `exactify()` in cases when it is not needed is a larger benefit IMO. However, some more actual use-cases could be useful here for testing timings.

Computing minpoly is doable and desirable for all descriptors without exactification. This is the reason why was introduced the function `composed_op` on polynomials

```
sage: x = polygen(QQ)
sage: p = x^3 + 2*x - 1
sage: q = x^3 - x + 3
sage: a = p.roots(QQbar, multiplicities=False)[0]
sage: b = q.roots(QQbar, multiplicities=False)[0]
sage: r = p.composed_op(q, operator.add)
sage: r(a + b)  # not necessary minpoly, but at least a multiple
0.?e-15
```

More generally, I think that QQbar elements beyond degree 8 (let say) should not try to find a reasonable representation of the number field they represent (what is exactify currently doing via `polred` which is costly). They should just be considered as the root of some irreducible polynomial. Computing minpoly of `a + b`, `abs(a)`, etc is doable.

Though, all this logic is now in [Fredrik's calcium](https://fredrikj.net/calcium/) and I am not sure how much it is desirable to improve the version in Sage compared to having a calcium version of `AA`/`QQbar`.

Actually, to construct a better refinement of `a + b` knowing the minimal polynomials `m_a(x)` and `m_b(x)` there are at least two strategies
- compute `m_{a+b}(x)` (eg via `composed_op`) and do refinement with it
- compute better refinement of `a` and `b` and add them
Depending on `deg(m_a)`, `deg(m_b)`, `deg(m_{a+b})` it might be better to use the second option.

Consider the following computation:

```
x = AA(1+100*2^(-1000))^(1/100)
y = AA(1+101*2^(-1000))^(1/101)
x < y
```
(which calls `sign(y-x)` internally). With your patch (if I read it correctly; I did not actually run it), Sage will notice that the minimal polynomials are different, but will not take advantage of that information. It will still trigger exact computation of `y-x` (which takes forever). 

I suggest adding for this case (different minimal polynomials) the code

```
while self._value.contains_zero():
    self._more_precision()
return self._value.unique_sign()
```
Is there any reason not to do so? (For the record: in this particular example, this loop takes 82ms on my machine.)

<a id='comment:17'></a>
I wonder if we can improve *exactification* instead of avoiding it. At the moment any two instances of `AlgebraicGenerator` are recognized to be different, even if they describe the *same root* of the same polynomial. Is there a special reason for this? What is the idea behind the attribute `_index`?

Howsoever, I did the following attempt modifying the method  `_richcmp_` of this class  and changed `self is other` in `union` to `self == other` and accordingly `super is self` to `super == self` in `super_poly` (`diff` shown with respect to stable 9.3):

This change passes through all doctests (including `--long`) and makes *exactification* possible for the testcase of the ticket description:

```sage
sage: x1 = AA(2^(1/100))
....: x2 = AA(2^(1/100))
....: y = x1 - x2

```

Of course this does not solve the testcase of [comment:14](https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31767#comment:14). Concerning this it seems, that the function `composed_op` could do a good job here:



```sage
sage: x = AA(1+2*2^(-1000))^(1/2); y = AA(1+3*2^(-1000))^(1/3)
sage: p = x.minpoly()
sage: q = y.minpoly()
sage: %time r = p.composed_op(q, operator.sub)
CPU times: user 4 ms, sys: 0 ns, total: 4 ms
Wall time: 5.53 ms
sage: %time F = r.factor()
CPU times: user 0 ns, sys: 0 ns, total: 0 ns
Wall time: 2.65 ms
```

I would prefer such a solution since it would not just fix this issue, but also improve exactification in general. On the other hand I agree with Vincent that this only makes sense (in view of the upcoming Calcium), if it will be easy to realize.

But note, that this issue is different from the former one in not just hanging in Pari's `nffactor` but already one step before in the construction of the Pari number field (of degree two!):

```sage
sage: AG = x._exact_field()
sage: AG.pari_field()

Those cases already would have been picked up earlier in this block:

I agree that for a single `+` operation on two elements for which you know the minimal polynomial, infinite refinement is a way to go.

However, you need someting to compute minimal polynomials in order to handle

```
sage: a = AA(1 + 2^(-1000))
sage: x = a^(1/100) + a^(1/104) - a^(1/102) - a^(1/103)
```
I opened #31889 for that purpose.
