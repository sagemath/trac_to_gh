We extend the `ManifoldSubsetPullback` constructor to handle relatively open convex sets.

In this case, we 
- set up the affine hull as an embedded submanifold via `ConvexSet_base.affine_hull_projection` (#31993), generalized from `Polyhedron.affine_hull_manifold` (#31659) 
- make the relatively open set an open subset; the pullback is the image of the open subset

We add `ConvexSet_base` methods
- `as_manifold_subset`.
- `relative_interior_manifold` 

Next step: `Polyhedron.face_manifold_poset`, top element of which is the polyhedron as a union of its relative interior and its facets. Using #31732, the intersection of the relative interior and each facet is declared empty.
