running on Ubuntu 18.04. I get the same result on the "master" and the current "develop" branch

config-log and build-log is attached.

The bug seems to have something to do with these error messages:

```
*** WARNING: renaming "readline" since importing it failed: /home/rote/Dokumente/Software/sage/local/lib/libreadline.so.8: undefined symbol: UP


[python3-3.8.5] Following modules built successfully but were removed because they could not be imported:
[python3-3.8.5] readline   
```

This error can be reproduced using:

```
tox -e docker-ubuntu-bionic-standard -- ncurses readline python3
```

From `python3...log`:

```
checking for getc_unlocked() and friends... yes
checking how to link readline libs... -lreadline -ltinfo
...
```
but when python3 actually links readline, it is doing something else:

```

You could check if uninstalling `libncursesw5-dev` solves this problem

```
The issue likely arises because `find_library_file` inspects the system library but then the Sage-built library is used for linking https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/setup.py#L977

I think this is a limitation of distutils - it does not know about `LIBRARY_PATH`
