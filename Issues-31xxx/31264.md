Various types of 3d plots lack a way of
setting zmin and/or zmax, or a zrange:

- `plot3d`
- `plot` method of hyperplane arrangement
- `plot` method of polyhedron

while some others provide one, such as:

- `implicit_plot3d`
- `plot_vector_field3d`

Three-dimensional parametric plots
(whether 3D curves with `parametric_plot`
or 3D surfaces with `parametric_plot3d`)
lack a way to set bounds on all three
coordinates x, y and z.

This is frequently requested by users,
see for instance:

- [Ask Sage question 55355: Ranging the z-axis](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/55355)
- [Ask Sage question 54100: Calimero effect in plot3d](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/54100)
- [Ask Sage question 36557: Vertical view plot3d](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/36557)
- [Ask Sage question 30561: Visualizing Polyhedron with specified range](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/30561)
- [sage-support request, 2008-11-13, Limiting z axis in 3d plot](https://groups.google.com/g/sage-support/c/SfR6lb-dwYc/m/n7hLC8SwYJQJ)
- [sage-support request, 2021-07-29, parametric_plot](https://groups.google.com/g/sage-support/c/bIU9cJslsC0/m/uvI7CfmEAQAJ)

Though such bounds cannot be applied when
creating 3D plots, 3D graphics objects
have a method `add_condition` that allows
to truncate to a region.

It would be good to add examples of using
this method to the documentation pages for
`plot3d` and `parametric_plot3d`.

An example is provided in Frédéric Chapoton's answer to

- [Ask Sage question 58169: change the view box on a 3D graph](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/58169)
