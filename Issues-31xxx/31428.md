The empty abelian group as a Gap abelian group:

```
sage: A = AbelianGroupGap([])                                                                    
sage: A                                                                                          
Abelian group with gap, generator orders ()
```

Before this ticket:

```
sage: A([])                                                                                      
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
IndexError                                Traceback (most recent call last)
.....
--> 358             x = gens_gap[0]**0
    359             for i in range(len(exp)):
    360                 x *= gens_gap[i]**(exp[i] % orders[i])

IndexError: tuple index out of range
```

After this ticket:

```
sage: A([]) == A.one()
True
```

Done by starting the product at identity in a more robust way:

```diff
-            x = gens_gap[0]**0
+            x = self.one()
```

This change is good:

```diff
-            x = gens_gap[0]**0
+            x = A.one()
```
Optionally, the loop that follows could be inlined:

```diff
-            x = A.one()
-            for i in range(len(exp)):
-                x *= gens_gap[i]**(exp[i] % orders[i])
-            x = x.gap()
+            x = prod((g**(e % o) for g, e, o in zip(gens_gap, exp, orders)),
+                     A.one()).gap()
```

It might be faster but I did not check. That could be a separate ticket.

The patchbot has a pyflakes error complaining that `A` is undefined.

Please fix:

```diff
-            x = A.one()
+            x = self.one()
```
