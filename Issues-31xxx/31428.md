The empty abelian group as a Gap abelian group:

```
sage: A = AbelianGroupGap([])                                                                    
sage: A                                                                                          
Abelian group with gap, generator orders ()
```

Before this ticket:

```
sage: A([])                                                                                      
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

--> 358             x = gens_gap[0]**0
    359             for i in range(len(exp)):
    360                 x *= gens_gap[i]**(exp[i] % orders[i])

IndexError: tuple index out of range
```

After this ticket:

```
sage: A([]) == A.one()
True
```

Done by starting the product at identity in a more robust way:

```diff
-            x = gens_gap[0]**0
+            x = self.one()
```
