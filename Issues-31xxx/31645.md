As reported by user TBK in [this sage devel thread](https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/av4L3qQZl0o/m/d-UDze62AQAJ), the `series` method sometimes returns an incorrect power series in which a constant term has erroneously been multiplied by a power of x:

```
    sage: ((1-sqrt(1-x))/x + 0).series(x,3)
    1/2 + 1/8*x + 1/16*x^2 + Order(x^3)  # correct
    sage: ((1-sqrt(1-x))/x + 123).series(x,3)
    123*x^(-1) + 1/2 + 1/8*x + 1/16*x^2 + Order(x^3)  # wrong !!!
```

**Diagnosis:** Laurent polynomials are stored as a pair consisting of a polynomial and an offset `n` that represents multiplication by `x^n`. Pynac's `add::useries` method fails to account for the offset when adding the constant term to a power series.

This should be easy to fix, so I should be able to upload a PR soon.

The PR fixes the bug by moving the handling of the constant term to the initialization phase, where the offset is known to be 0.

With this PR applied, we get the correct result for the example in the ticket description:

```
sage: ((1-sqrt(1-x))/x + 123).series(x,3)
247/2 + 1/8*x + 1/16*x^2 + Order(x^3)
```
As a doctest, the PR uses the following very simple example that was also giving a wrong answer:

```
sage: (x^(-1) + 1).series(x,1)  # wrong answer !!!
2*x^(-1) + Order(x)
```

My recent pynac patches had merge conflicts, but I rebased this one on #31554 (hence the dependency), so I think it should merge cleanly.  Only the last 3 commits come from this ticket ("trac 31645 handling ...", "add doctest", and "increment pynac patch level").

This is a critical bug, so I hope it can be merged in 9.3.
