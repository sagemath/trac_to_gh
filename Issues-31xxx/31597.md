The [ginac documentation](https://www.ginac.de/tutorial/#Automatic-evaluation) says "GiNaC performs some automatic transformations on expressions, to simplify them and put them into a canonical form. ... This behavior is usually referred to as *automatic* or *anonymous evaluation*. ... The general rule is that when you construct expressions, GiNaC automatically creates them in canonical form, ... All GiNaC methods that transform expressions, like `subs()` or `normal()`, automatically re-evaluate their results." 

It seems that some (many?) pynac methods assume that their inputs have been sanitized in this way. Since applying a hold context disables this automatic evaluation, these methods may silently produce incorrect results inside a hold context. Examples of this can be seen in #31554.
