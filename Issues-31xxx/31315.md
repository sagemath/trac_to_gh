Notice that ``@`classmethod _test_remove_constraint` and `_test_remove_constraints` are missing. They should be added to `generic_backend_test.py` in #31103 later.

This method is not defined in most backends. Only `glpk_backend.pyx` has it. The test there is correct, but it uses `p = MixedIntegerLinearProgram(...)` instead.
