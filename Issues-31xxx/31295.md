`distutils` is marked deprecated in Python 3.10, 3.11 - see https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0632/ and https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/deprecated/distutils-legacy.html?, which also lists some replacements

OK, I could have flagged pari_jupyter earlier, but I am more worried about packages sage_lib depends on. pari_jupyter not working is probably affecting a very small number of users and not an obstacle to sage itself. I guess in the back of my mind I see cysignals going out of maintenance since Jeroen disappeared. cypari has somewhat been rescued but could also be a concern.
