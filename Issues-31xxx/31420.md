To make `sage` a namespace package, we need to get rid of `src/sage/__init__.py`.

It currently contains:
- definition of `__all__` (no longer needed; has no effect on completion, neither in plain python3 nor IPython)
- definition of `__version__` (unused)
- preloading of `zlib` (introduced in #23122)
- #32489: `load_ipython_extension` (introduced in #18726): This function is defined in module `sage` so that `%load_ext sage` works (see http://www.slabbe.org/blogue/categorie/ipython/); we forgot to define the corresponding function that would make `%unload_ext sage` work
- #32479: monkey patching of `inspect.isfunction` to support Cython functions (introduced in #25373)
- monkey patching of `importlib.machinery.ExtensionFileLoader` (introduced in #24681); the quest to get an upstream fix merged was apparently abandoned - https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/6653
- monkey patching of sqlite on Cygwin (introduced in #30157)

In this ticket we remove the ones that are not needed any more, and some others to another module init. #32479 and #32489 will take care of the leftovers.
