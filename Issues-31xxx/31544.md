`primes(start, stop=None)` is supposed to return an iterator over all primes between `start` and `stop-1`, but it confuses the two arguments when only one is given.

```
sage: list(primes(start=5, stop=10))    # this is OK
[5, 7]

sage: next(primes(start=5))    # should be 5
2

sage: list(primes(start=5))    # this should not terminate!
[2, 3]

sage: it = primes(start=25)
sage: [next(it) for _ in range(5)]    # this should be [29, 31, 37, 41, 43]
[2, 3, 5, 7, 11]
```

Clearly this behavior is meant for arguments given as positional arguments. I agree that when `start` is given as a keyword argument, it should never be taken as "stop".
