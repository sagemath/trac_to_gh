```
Using ellipsis syntax `[a .. b]` or `(a .. b)`
interferes with multiline block continuation
in Sage REPL input.

For reference, after entering the first two lines
below and hitting enter, the prompt is extended
with an (auto-indented) third line, as expected:

```
sage: for n in range(4):
....:     m = 2*n
....:
```
and the input is evaluated only once the user
either manually unindents (e.g. with ctrl-A ctrl-K)
and hits enter, or hits enter twice.

By contrast, in all cases below, hitting enter
at the end of the second line evaluates the code
typed so far, preventing to type a third line:

```
sage: for n in (1 .. 3):
....:     m = 2*n
sage: for n in [0 .. 3]:
....:     m = 2*n
sage: for n in range(4):
....:     m = (2*n .. 3*n)
sage: for n in range(4):
....:     m = [2*n .. 3*n]
```

<a id='comment:8'></a>`R.0` is fixed as well.

There is correct python syntax. Then ipython has some special syntax, like `%time`.
Then sage has some special syntax.

I would say that special syntax is anything, that gives a `SyntaxError` without modification. So replacing `2` by `Integer(2)` is not special syntax.
Replacing `2^3` by `2**3` is also not special syntax (and we need really to avoid doing it twice).

I don't know what is a better name for it, but this is really what the bug boils down to:

`IPython.input_transformer_manager.check_complete` checks the syntax as well, which means it must have access to all our special syntax rules.

As I understands it, your code does (added) Sage syntax preparsing down in "token level"(`input_transformer_manager` level) keeping out problematic transforms indicated by `syntax_only`, and then does Sage syntax preparing second time after "token level". Am I right? 

Then wouldn't it be more safe and efficient to do the transforms (ellipsis and generators) that are necessary to kill the bug in the token level and leave the other transforms after that?

<a id='comment:14'></a>The major changes are the following:

- Instead of worrying about `quote_state`, we require that all the lines are given at once into `preparse_multiple_lines`.
- We add `preparse_multiple_lines` to `cleanup_transformers`.
- We remove `preparse` from `input_transformers_post`.
- The following are now handled via token transformers instead:
  - Backslash division `B \ C`.
  - Generator construction `K.<a> = QuadraticField(2)`.
  - Calculus like function assigment `f(x) = (x + 1)`.

We add a couple of deprecations.

Thing is that almost all our changes affect the syntax and need to be done before `input_transformers_post`. We could do all of them just in `cleanup_transformers`, but that makes it difficult resolving things like #30953.

Instead of doing the token now, we could also leave them for #30953. This should make this ticket here easier.

`time` is working in `.sage`. What isn't working anymore is automagic. But automagic isn't meant for multiline things and thus is really a strange concept for files. Line- and cell-magic should be working just fine. (Cell-magic is also a bit strange, as it cannot be exited.) Line-magic wasn't working before in `.sage`-files.

But yes, this is a regression.

<a id='comment:35'></a>Sorry about the mess.

This is a much simpler fix. It just creates a second input manager that does Sage's preparsing to check correctness of Sage's syntax. It does not behave as desired with magics, e.g.

```
sage: ip = get_ipython()
sage: ip._check_complete_transformer.transform_cell("%time 8^^1")
"get_ipython().run_line_magic('time', 'Integer(8)^Integer(1)')\n"
```
which means it would preparse things after `%time` twice, but it's sole purpose is to check the correctness of syntax, for which it works just fine.

With the new approach I would like the following follow ups:
- close #4545 with a doctest
- have preparse and preparse_file call `ip.transform_cell`, which means the code will behave exactly as if parsed into the interactive shell (move the code from preparse to a helper function then)
- #30953: do generator construction and calculus like assignment with token transformation

You did introduce these classes in the branch of new approach. Your branch fixed the things above. Then I started working on your branch (with those new classes) because there were regressions in loading `.sage` files.

<a id='comment:38'></a>Then let's straight out our communication first.

(1) You pushed `public/31951-new` with the new approach.
(2) Then I worked on your branch to fix regressions in loading `.sage` files, and then pushed my branch to `public/31951`. I think this is a mistake. I should have named it `public/31951-new-new` or something.

So now the branch (`public/31951-new2) uploaded to this ticket wiped out both of our works!

Could I upload my branch again with name `public/31951-new3`? Then we can start discussing with the magics, in which there is a miscommunication as well...

We can move the previous work to a new ticket (or new tickets). However, I realized that our approach does not work well with automagic, e.g.

`time 8^1` and `time 8^^1` should be equivalent to `%time 8^1` resp. `%time 8^^1`, but I did not accomplish this. Did you?

There are a number of phases that the transformation undergoes:

1. `get_ipython().input_transformer_manager.cleanup_transforms`: Things like cleaning the prompt as I suggested.
2. `get_ipython().input_transformer_manager.token_transformers`: Things like IPythons line magic.
3. `get_ipython().prefilter_manager`: Things like IPythons automagic.
4. `get_ipython().input_transformers_post`: Currently Sage's `preparse`.
5. `ip.ast_transformers` (Optional additional changes).

Anything that you enter undergoes all 5 steps. However, when checking whether multi-line input is complete, only the first two steps are checked. It makes sense to execute our preparser at step 4, so it works nicely with automagic. It should be executed at step 2 or later to work nicely with (non-auto) magic.

My latest solution to this ticket is to leave Sage's preparser at step 4, but overwrite `check_complete` with the method from a different input manager that applies Sage's preparser at step 1. Things will be modified before checking whether this is magic, but this should not bother us.

I quickly scanned your fixes and I think they make sense. When executing a file, it should behave exactly as when typed into the shell, so this could be done via `ipython_preparse` or similar (which calls `get_ipython().transform_cell()` (steps 1 and 2) and not `get_ipython().input_transformer_manager().transform()` (steps 1 to 4).

If you agree, you could put your branch on #30953 and we leave the minimalistic fix here. Because of the problems with automagic, I think sage's preparsing should stay at step 4 however (except for checking completeness).

Thanks for the detailed explanation. I only guessed the process.

Anyway we are too late to provide a "quick fix".

No. I didn't know that. There is no other problem with our approach except this one.

I investigated this. The reason is that ipython applies `cleanup_transforms` **several** times to the input string for automagic. Hence `time 8^^1` becomes `time 8^1` and again `time 8**1`.

So the solution is to make this code

```
    # Use ^ for exponentiation and ^^ for xor
    # (A side effect is that **** becomes xor as well.)
    L = L.replace('^', '**').replace('****', '^')  
```
also to a token transformer(named perhaps `SageCaretTransformer` or `SageExponentiationTransformer`?).

With another token transformer, our approach(my branch containing your work) fixes all problems.

Not working. The problem is that `8^^1` is preparsed twice. Automagic is hard to detect and depends in fact on whether a variable of a specific name is defined.

At the moment I really see two ways of doing it:
- Have an artificial input manager for `check_complete`.
- Do the preparsing in steps 1 and 2 except for single-lines, when we keep doing the preparsing at step 4.

<a id='comment:53'></a>`quote_state` needs not to be a global in `interpreter.py`.

The problem here is that automagic will still have the 3 token replacement. I'm not on your new branch, but you will see a failure similar to

```
sage: ls | grep \f
/bin/bash: -c: line 0: syntax error near unexpected token `('
/bin/bash: -c: line 0: `ls -F --color | grep * BackslashOperator() * f'
```

On develop this works just fine.

So the token replacements should not be applied in case of single lines, but then need to be added to `SagePreparseTransformer` again (to be applied to single lines). We could also remove the backslash token and put it back into `SagePreparseTransformer`, but this wouldn't fix the following:

Now:

```
sage: del maxima
sage: maxima f(x)=2
__tmp__=var("x")
```

Before:

```
sage: del maxima
sage: maxima f(x)=2
f(x)=2
```

What I understand from this is that now `IPython` is being loaded, even when just running sage from command line, which is new. I have no idea if this is acceptable.

Whenevern you run

`sage -c "print('hello')` or similar, this will call `preparse`, which imports whatever it needs to run. In our case we added the dependency to `IPython`.

Now the new fix just slightly modified the develop branch to obtain the same output, so I don't know why to use tokens, if a slight modification works just as well.
