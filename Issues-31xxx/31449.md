Certain important functionalities are missing in `AbstractLinearRankMetricCode`.
A list with functionalities to be added:
- Computing the support of a codeword. Both column and row support are desired.
- Computing the relative distance of the code.
- Computing the rank distribution of the code.
- Finding random codeword of given rank.
- Finding the minimal and maximal rank in the code.
- Finding the characteristic of the code.
- Rewriting elements in the extended field in some basis and recovering from it.
