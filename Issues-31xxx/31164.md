```rst
Since Sage 9.2, the `spkg section of the Sage reference manual <https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/spkg/>`_ is automatically generated from the information in the `SAGE_ROOT/build/pkgs/ <https://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/tree/build/pkgs>`_ directory. Each SPKG is represented by a subdirectory. The structure of these subdirectories is explained in 
the `Developer's Guide <https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/packaging.html>`_.
```

**This meta-ticket tracks the task of adding external packages, in particular those that used to be listed at https://wiki.sagemath.org/SageMathExternalPackages, as optional/experimental packages.** 
By including them as optional/experimental packages in `build/pkgs`:
- They are automatically included in our reference manual (see #29655)
- Information about them can be obtained using the commands
  * Optional packages available: `./sage -optional`
  * Experimental packages available: `./sage -experimental`
  * Details about an SPKG: `./sage -info <SPKG>`
- The GH Actions workflows `tox-optional.yml` and `tox-experimental.yml` will run them, providing continuous integration that will allow use to catch unintended breaking changes during the Sage development cycle

**Already added as packages, see [spkg section of the Sage reference manual](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/spkg/):**

**Tickets for pip-installable packages:**

The packages will typically be added as [pip packages instead of normal packages](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/packaging.html#package-source-types). 
These do not come with tarball information and do not have to pin the version, so by default the latest version on PyPI would be installed.
Hence there is no additional maintenance burden from updating the packages.
Adding the packages is made easy by the new [sage -package create](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/packaging.html#utility-script-to-create-packages) commands, added [in Sage 9.3](https://wiki.sagemath.org/ReleaseTours/sage-9.3#For_developers:_Setting_up_Python_packages_from_PyPI_as_Sage_packages).

The solution here is to use pip packages instead of normal packages. 
https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/packaging.html#package-source-types

These do not come with tarball information and do not have to pin the version, so by default the latest version on PyPI would be installed.

> - there is no serious continuous integration for packages (as they have eg for gap)


Well, we do have workflows on GH Actions that at least tries to install all optional and experimental packages!
