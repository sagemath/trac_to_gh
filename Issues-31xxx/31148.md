```markdown
My system has qhull 8.0.0 installed.  Because Matplotlib
doesn't know about my system qhull it builds its own version.
This can cause runtime issues with Matplotlib trying to call
the wrong qhull library.  For example, this fixes the error that
```bash
$ ./sage -tp 8 --long src/sage/plot/plot3d/list_plot3d.py
```
produces
```bash
QH6249 qh_lib_check: Incorrect qhull library called.
Size of qhT for caller is 2896, but for library is 2792.

QH6256 qh_lib_check: Cannot continue.
Library 'qhull 7.2.0 (2015.2 2016/01/18)'
uses a static qhT (e.g., libqhull.so)
```
if the system has qhull 8.0.0 installed.
```

As the branch is on top of the one of #31128, it's OK to just add that ticket as a dependency. I have just done that.

(Best practice, however, would be to have independent branches for independent tickets.)
