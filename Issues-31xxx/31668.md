#27364 fixes a bug that `_test_construction` should have found -- except `TestSuite` is not called at all for any multivariate polynomial rings. 

We add a bunch of `TestSuite` calls for the rings constructed as examples in `polynomial_ring_constructor`.

Many tests are failing; we skip these tests to make this ticket mergeable. In follow-up tickets, these failures should be fixed.

If one always wants \"the minimal parent\", then after plugging in `x=0` one can end up in `base_ring[y]`. When the variables and their substitution values are computed in some fashion and then substituted into a bunch of different polynomials it is inconvenient that the result may have different type and so one has to consider multiple cases. I hit it because toric code breaks on certain examples because of this issue.",

I disagree with this logic - why the parent of the result depends on values used for substitution? If one always wants "the minimal parent", then after plugging in `x=0` one can end up in `base_ring[y]`. When the variables and their substitution values are computed in some fashion and then substituted into a bunch of different polynomials it is inconvenient that the result may have different type and so one has to consider multiple cases. I hit it because toric code breaks on certain examples because of this issue.

And more precisely, the rule for substitution is:
- if the substitution is "partial" then the omitted variables are set to themselves
- for a full substitution, the result of the parent is set to be the common_parent of the base_ring of the polynomial ring and the parents of values to be substituted

Why something that specific is needed in `rings/polynomial/polynomial_ring.py`?

```
def construction(self):
    ...
    implementation = None
    if 'NTL' in self._implementation_repr:
        implementation = 'NTL'
    ...
```

On multi-variate polynomials with a single variable this test should fail

```
            # substituting one variable (in a polynomial ring with variables) with 0
            d = {str(gens[0]): 0}
            tester.assertEqual(self.subs(**d).parent(), self.parent())
```

This is obviously not a complete solution. The parents don't keep track in a clean way what the implementation is. I have some other experimental code that tries to decode the element class, but it's all not very satisfying.

What is "partial"? How about this one:

```
sage: R.<x, y> = QQ[]
sage: parent(x.subs(x=1))
Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y over Rational Field
sage: R.<x, y> = QQ["a, b"][]
sage: parent(x.subs(x=1))
Multivariate Polynomial Ring in a, b over Rational Field
```
I also think that it makes sense to have the same results here

```
sage; R.<x, y> = QQ["a, b"][]
sage: p = x + y
sage: parent(p.subs(x=1, y=2))
Multivariate Polynomial Ring in a, b over Rational Field
sage: parent(p.subs(x=1).subs(y=2))
Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y over Multivariate Polynomial Ring in a, b over Rational Field
```

Partial is when you do not substitute all variables. On `QQ[x,y]` if you only specify the value of `x`, let say `x=1` then `y` is set to `y`. In other words `p.subs(x=1)` is equivalent to `p(1, y)`. All the examples you wrote are perfectly valid and will be supported in the same way. The only example that is wrong and I want to disable is in [comment:28](#comment%3A28).
