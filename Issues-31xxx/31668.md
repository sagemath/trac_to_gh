#27364 fixes a bug that `_test_construction` should have found -- except `TestSuite` is not called at all for any multivariate polynomial rings. 

We add a bunch of `TestSuite` calls for the rings constructed as examples in `polynomial_ring_constructor`.

Many tests are failing; we skip these tests to make this ticket mergeable. In follow-up tickets, these failures should be fixed.

I disagree with this logic - why the parent of the result depends on values used for substitution? If one always wants "the minimal parent", then after plugging in `x=0` one can end up in `base_ring[y]`. When the variables and their substitution values are computed in some fashion and then substituted into a bunch of different polynomials it is inconvenient that the result may have different type and so one has to consider multiple cases. I hit it because toric code breaks on certain examples because of this issue.

Just a quick comment -- the above only demonstrates that the parent of the result depends on the parents of the substituted values (not the values themselves), and which subset is substituted.

And more precisely, the rule for substitution is:
- if the substitution is "partial" then the omitted variables are set to themselves
- for a full substitution, the result of the parent is set to be the common_parent of the base_ring of the polynomial ring and the parents of values to be substituted

This is obviously not a complete solution. The parents don't keep track in a clean way what the implementation is. I have some other experimental code that tries to decode the element class, but it's all not very satisfying.

Certainly not optimal, but something similar is implemented for `MatrixSpace` (from `matrix/matrix_class.py`) via `_has_default_implementation`.

Definitely: this is #31852. I was not convinced by the solution I used for `MatrixClass`. I secretly hoped that you had some alternative.

What is "partial"? How about this one:

```
sage: R.<x, y> = QQ[]
sage: parent(x.subs(x=1))
Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y over Rational Field
sage: R.<x, y> = QQ["a, b"][]
sage: parent(x.subs(x=1))
Multivariate Polynomial Ring in a, b over Rational Field
```
I also think that it makes sense to have the same results here

```
sage; R.<x, y> = QQ["a, b"][]
sage: p = x + y
sage: parent(p.subs(x=1, y=2))
Multivariate Polynomial Ring in a, b over Rational Field
sage: parent(p.subs(x=1).subs(y=2))
Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y over Multivariate Polynomial Ring in a, b over Rational Field
```

Partial is when you do not substitute all variables. On `QQ[x,y]` if you only specify the value of `x`, let say `x=1` then `y` is set to `y`. In other words `p.subs(x=1)` is equivalent to `p(1, y)`.
