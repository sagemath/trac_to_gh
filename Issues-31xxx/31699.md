  - Add a feature `--use-feature=in-tree-build` to build local projects in-place when installing. This is expected to become the default behavior in pip 21.3

We add two new packages that have become dependencies in the new versions: `toml`, `typing_extensions`.

This looks like just a package update ticket right. 

I guess the way `pip` is usually used, building in place probably doesn't matter. However, that's bucking the trend of every other build system that are going through extra effort to let you keep your source clean.
