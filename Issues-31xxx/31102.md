The bug comes from the oeis database, see the weird invisible character `â�¨` at the end of the line `%Y A000217 A011782 counts compositions of any length.` of the page https://oeis.org/search?q=A000217&n=1&fmt=text

I think it is better to fix upstream database and keep some pressure on its quality instead of silently working around this typo on our side.

I am requesting an account on oeis to fix it.
