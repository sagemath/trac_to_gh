```
With Sage 9.3 on macOS Catalina and default browser set to Safari 14.1.1, if I open a Terminal.app window, start sage, and type:

```
sage: var('x, y')
sage: plot3d(x^2 + y^2, (x, -1, 1), (y, -1, 1)) 
```
an essentially blank webpage opens in Safari (there is the little "i in a circle" menu in the lower-right corner but no plot).

On the same system, the plot appears fine if I switch to Chrome or Firefox.  Moreover, if in Safari I turn on the developer menu, it works ok there as well.  Note this is specific to the plots created at the command line; Jupyter notebooks are unaffected.

Based on my testing, I believe that, with the developer menu off, Safari will not pull in script files when they are not located at or below the location of the html file.  Specifically, I copied one of the tmp_hash.html files to the attached `bad_sage.html` and played with different locations and values of the `script src` for `three.min.js`.  For example, in is current form, if I put a copy of `three.min.js` in `$HOME` then Safari opens `bad_sage.html` when it in `$HOME` but not if the html file is in `$HOME/Desktop` or `/tmp`.

I certainly meant three.js
I cannot imagine they can't work around this.

There is nothing they can do as far as I can see.  The problem is that the file `three.min.js` is not being read by Safari at all because of its location relative to the `html` file that requests it. This is true of any `JavaScript` file, nothing specific to `three.js`.

The obvious if inelegant fix on the Sage side would be to dump all of `three.min.js` into the (completely temporary) `html` file in `$HOME/.sage/temp/*` rather than the current

```
<script src="$SAGE_LOCAL/share/threejs/build/three.min.js"></script>
```
line.

I was able to duplicate the issue without `three.js` with 1-line `.js` file and a dozen lines of `html`, see `safari_issue.tar.gz`.

As for being hard to believe, note that it only manifests itself when loading local files, something most users never do, and only when they are arranged in a particular way.  Moreover, further testing indicates the rule is not:

* Only load JS files at or below the requesting HTML file.

but

* Only load JS and **HTML** files at or below the level of any HTML file previously open in this tab.

This means if a program opens their local HTML docs at the top level, probably the most common reason local files are opened, there will be no issue, even if individual files refer to stuff in directories above them.

Having the developer menu on is surely very uncommon, so it's likely that most use notebooks or have a different default browser (no issue with Chrome or Firefox).

Just to update the ticket, this continues to be a problem with Safari 15.5 on Big Sur (11.6.7).
