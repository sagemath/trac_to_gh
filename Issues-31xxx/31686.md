Initially asked at 

- [Ask Sage question 56710: Computing the factored multiplicative order of an extension field tries to solve an unnecessarily hard factoring problem](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/56710)

There seems to be a unnecessary performance problem with constructing large extension fields:

```python
sage: p = Integer('0x24000000000024000130e0000d7f70e4a803ca76f439266f443f9a5'
....:             'cda8a6c7be4a7a5fe8fadffd6a2a7e8c30006b9459ffffcd300000001')
sage: GF(p^2)
```
This hangs trying to factor the 891-bit integer p<sup>2</sup> - 1, which is longer than the longest solved RSA Challenge number. (As it happens, the hard part of this factorization is a 675-bit integer which is still impractical.)

It is not unreasonable that constructing the extension field requires knowing the factorization of the multiplicative order. (You can get around this by constructing it with a specific modulus, but then many operations, e.g. taking roots, require this factorization anyway.)

However, we know that p<sup>2</sup> - 1 splits as (p-1)(p+1), and factoring those may be much more feasible:

```python
sage: factor(p - 1)
2^32 * 3^4 * 17 * 67 * 293 * 349 * 1997 * 19556633 * 44179799701097
* 1461985442088199434216480729118540833655826472878315075486478169293801719414121837587283877
sage: factor(p + 1)
2 * 313 * 751 * 2003 * 2671 * 738231097
* 55047696457335561580180364861378466840614260303507426009866606293225963076275651294902969015038913167956483928299
```
(this takes less than a second on my desktop).

In general, computing the multiplicative order of an extension field should take advantage of the factorization of p<sup>k</sup> - 1 as a polynomial. There might also be other cases where we know the factorization by construction, and should be able to provide it.

EDIT: I wrongly thought that the program hangs at factoring `p^2`... this comment is not much relevant to the ticket.

To my mind it is a mistake that `GF` takes as input `p^2` and not the pair `(p, 2)`. I would suggest to
- rework the `FiniteFieldFactory` to also accept `Factorization`

```
sage: p = 17
sage: q = Factorization([[p, 2]])
sage: GF(q)
```
- tweak the sage preparser so that the `p^2` in `GF(p^2)` is converted to `GF(Factorization([This is the Trac macro *p,2* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#p,2-macro)))`.

Please open a ticket to allow `GF((p, d))` instead of `GF(p^d)`.

Of course figuring out the prime and degree 
when factoring the argument `q` of `GF(q)` as `p^d`
is easier than factoring general composite numbers.
Still it seems a waste that in `GF(p^d)` the prime power
is computed only to then recover the prime and degree.

The attached branch achieves the proposed goal of the ticket,
understood as speeding up (and often allowing at all)
factoring the unit order of non-prime finite fields.

```python
sage: p = 0x24000000000024000130e0000d7f70e4a803ca76f439266f443f9a5cda8a6c7be4a7a5fe8fadffd6a2a7e8c30006b9459ffffcd300000001
sage: F = GF(p^2, 'a')

```

```

Finding a pseudo-Conway polynomial still takes longer
than using a random irreducible polynommial, see #31434.

```python
sage: p = 1100585370631
sage: %time F = GF(p^24, 'a')
CPU times: user 120 ms, sys: 12.3 ms, total: 132 ms
Wall time: 170 ms
sage: %time F = GF(p^24)
CPU times: user 1.76 s, sys: 303 ms, total: 2.07 s
Wall time: 2.46 s
```

```python
sage: p = 0x24000000000024000130e0000d7f70e4a803ca76f439266f443f9a5cda8a6c7be4a7a5fe8fadffd6a2a7e8c30006b9459ffffcd300000001
sage: %time F = GF(p^2, 'a')
CPU times: user 1.94 s, sys: 9.62 ms, total: 1.95 s
Wall time: 2.05 s
sage: %time F = GF(p^2)
CPU times: user 14.7 s, sys: 49.9 ms, total: 14.8 s
Wall time: 17.7 s
```

<div id="comment:14" align="right">comment:14</div>

Some questions and thoughts.

I added a doctest in a `TESTS` block, should it be
in `EXAMPLES` instead?

I decided to only include a quick one, to keep
doctesting time under control.

Optionally, the example from #31434 and the first
example from here could be added too.

Maybe Flint, NTL, PARI, ... have code we could use
instead of rolling our own?

Should `d == 1` and maybe `d == 2` be special-cased
to avoid imports in those frequent cases?

If it does not exceed a couple of seconds, why not.
