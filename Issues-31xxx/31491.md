I don't read Farsi, but it builds correctly and looks good in the HTML. Thanks for this contribution!

However, trying to build the PDF documentation:

```
./sage -docbuild fa/a_tour_of_sage pdf

l.276 \sphinxmaketitle
                      
? 
! Emergency stop.
 ...                                              
                                                  
l.276 \sphinxmaketitle
                      
!  ==> Fatal error occurred, no output PDF file produced!
```

So this needs more work before it can be merged.

Seems likely, unless we were to go xetex.  Of course, maybe numbering won't really matter in such a small document?  It could be worth testing out, at least.
