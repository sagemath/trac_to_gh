I don't read Farsi, but it builds correctly and looks good in the HTML. Thanks for this contribution!

However, trying to build the PDF documentation:

```
./sage -docbuild fa/a_tour_of_sage pdf

l.276 \sphinxmaketitle
                      
!  ==> Fatal error occurred, no output PDF file produced!
```

So this needs more work before it can be merged.
