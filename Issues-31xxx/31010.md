```
The latest release of sage at the time of writing is 9.2 but running:

```
docker run -it sagemath/sagemath:latest sage --version
```


gives:


```
SageMath version 9.1, Release Date: 2020-05-20
```

Is it possible to add a minimal github/gitlab workflow that checks that the docker creation works in princple, and which is fast enough to be run on each push to some branch? In this way one could make sure that tickets don't destroy the publishing pipeline.
