```
In sage-9.1, this works fine with Jupyter:

```
%display latex

then in another cell

@interact
def f(n=10):
    print(n)
```
However, in sage-9.2, the output of Interact is **displayed as latex**, i.e., somebody changed %display latex in such a way that it also breaks widgets.

```

This is a really serious bug, since not only is `@`interact broken, in fact all of ipywidgets stops working the second you do "%display latex".

FWIW, `%display latex` also breaks `%matplotlib notebook`. For instance the following cell in a Jupyter notebook

```
%display latex
%matplotlib notebook
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot([1, 2, 3, 4])
plt.ylabel('some numbers')
plt.show()
```
yields

```
<𝙸𝙿𝚢𝚝𝚑𝚘𝚗.𝚌𝚘𝚛𝚎.𝚍𝚒𝚜𝚙𝚕𝚊𝚢.𝙹𝚊𝚟𝚊𝚜𝚌𝚛𝚒𝚙𝚝𝚘𝚋𝚓𝚎𝚌𝚝>
<𝙸𝙿𝚢𝚝𝚑𝚘𝚗.𝚌𝚘𝚛𝚎.𝚍𝚒𝚜𝚙𝚕𝚊𝚢.𝙷𝚃𝙼𝙻𝚘𝚋𝚓𝚎𝚌𝚝>
```
instead of the pyplot window.
If one suppresses `%display latex` or replaces it by `%display plain`, then everything is fine: the interactive pyplot window appears, with the requested plot. 

Contrary to the issue with `@interact`, this one is also there in Sage 9.1, except that the output is only

```
<𝙸𝙿𝚢𝚝𝚑𝚘𝚗.𝚌𝚘𝚛𝚎.𝚍𝚒𝚜𝚙𝚕𝚊𝚢.𝙷𝚃𝙼𝙻𝚘𝚋𝚓𝚎𝚌𝚝>
```
