I suggest some code improvements for the documentation (adding a note that an attribute à la `_is_immutable` is required to check immutability), an additional method `_require_immutable` (to require immutability in cases like hash functions) and Python 3 compatibility (using `format` instead of `%` as recommended in Python's doc).

Then, the method is standardized, which I would favorize.

And what do you think about the change of error message?

I had something like this in mind...

Should be even faster since `getattr` is completely avoided. Moreover, the error message is now much clearer if the object doesn't support mutability.

I don't understand this distinction you're trying to make. If you use this decorator with a method on a class that does not implement an `is_immutable` method, then you get an `AttributeError`. However, it is potentially reasonable for a class to add an attribute `_is_immutable` when it becomes immutable. I agree with your point on not depending on implementation details, but because we are trying to set the API for implementations, I feel like that is somewhat moot. There is also something to be said for having different error messages, but having more flexibility I think trumps this, although just barely.

I actually don't know. That was the setup I found there. Actually, due to #31182, I think it is better to make this class completely Pythonic. If there is a need for a Cythonic version, I suggest to introduce a `SageObjectWithMutability`. See my [ticket:31182#comment:12 comment].

What do you mean?
