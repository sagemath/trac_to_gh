I suggest some code improvements for the documentation (adding a note that an attribute à la `_is_immutable` is required to check immutability), an additional method `_require_immutable` (to require immutability in cases like hash functions) and Python 3 compatibility (using `format` instead of `%` as recommended in Python's doc).

That makes sense. What about this instead:

> Alternatively, one could ask for the method is_immutable() instead of the attribute?


Then, the method is standardized, which I would favorize.

And what do you think about the change of error message?

I had something like this in mind...

Should be even faster since `getattr` is completely avoided. Moreover, the error message is now much clearer if the object doesn't support mutability.

Any ideas for a compromise? I think, from a developer's viewpoint, the original error message was more clear. But my plan, so far, is that this decorator should be used for the mutability checks in the manifold setting (after the pickling in #31182 had been solved).

If you use this decorator with a method on a class that does not implement an `is_immutable` method, then you get an `AttributeError`. However, it is potentially reasonable for a class to add an attribute `_is_immutable` when it becomes immutable. I agree with your point on not depending on implementation details, but because we are trying to set the API for implementations, I feel like that is somewhat moot. There is also something to be said for having different error messages, but having more flexibility I think trumps this, although just barely.\n\n> > I am not 100% convinced the error message is more clear, but I am okay with it (once you remove the trailing period).\n\n> \n> Any ideas for a compromise?

But my plan, so far, is that this decorator should be used for the mutability checks in the manifold setting (after the pickling in #31182 had been solved).\n\n\nI would generally avoid the decorator and just directly call stuff. It is nearly the same amount of code. While it does make it slightly easier to refactor, it obfuscates the code mode and slows it down. This is good for the more casual user, but for production code, I would avoid the decorator in this case.",

> > The problem with this approach is that it will raise an attribute error if it is used on a class that does not implement an `is_immutable()` method. Although I mostly agree that it generally should if it is using this feature, but I could conceive of a reason why it wouldn't. I would say it is more likely that things will have some attribute to hold the mutability status than just a method to check it. Ultimately I would leave the check the way it currently is with something in the docstring stating that it is a requirement to use the decorator.

> I don't get your point entirely. Is your `AttributeError` concern related only to the method or generally speaking? If it's related, I'd say we use the attribute only (even though I personally like methods more, because they are not interested in implementation details), drop the `getattr` (because it's faster) and raise an attribute error if that is not implemented. I think it should definitely raise an attribute error in cases where we cannot say whether the object is immutable or not. The decorator wouldn't make much sense in situations like this, same for the error message.


I don't understand this distinction you're trying to make. If you use this decorator with a method on a class that does not implement an `is_immutable` method, then you get an `AttributeError`. However, it is potentially reasonable for a class to add an attribute `_is_immutable` when it becomes immutable. I agree with your point on not depending on implementation details, but because we are trying to set the API for implementations, I feel like that is somewhat moot. There is also something to be said for having different error messages, but having more flexibility I think trumps this, although just barely.

> Any ideas for a compromise? I think, from a developer's viewpoint, the original error message was more clear. But my plan, so far, is that this decorator should be used for the mutability checks in the manifold setting (after the pickling in #31182 had been solved).


I would generally avoid the decorator and just directly call stuff. It is nearly the same amount of code. While it does make it slightly easier to refactor, it obfuscates the code mode and slows it down. This is good for the more casual user, but for production code, I would avoid the decorator in this case.

As for the manifold code, I should switch to `_require_immutable` in `Mutability` instead?

I think this is good overall. However I have one question and comment:

Why is the `_require_immutable` not a `cpdef` method but instead a Python and `cdef`? I think you need an `except -1` added too.
