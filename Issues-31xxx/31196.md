I suggest some code improvements for the documentation (adding a note that an attribute Ã  la `_is_immutable` is required to check immutability), an additional method `_require_immutable` (to require immutability in cases like hash functions) and Python 3 compatibility (using `format` instead of `%` as recommended in Python's doc).

Depends on #31181

I had something like this in mind...

Should be even faster since `getattr` is completely avoided. Moreover, the error message is now much clearer if the object doesn't support mutability.

+I suggest some code improvements for the documentation (adding a note that an attribute Ã  la `_is_immutable` is required to check immutability), an additional method `_require_immutable` (to require immutability in cases like hash functions) and Python 3 compatibility (using `format` instead of `%` as recommended in Python's doc).

I think this is good overall. However I have one question and comment:

Why is the `_require_immutable` not a `cpdef` method but instead a Python and `cdef`? I think you need an `except -1` added too.
