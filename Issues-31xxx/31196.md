I suggest some code improvements for the documentation (adding a note that an attribute à la `_is_immutable` is required to check immutability), an additional method `_require_immutable` (to require immutability in cases like hash functions) and Python 3 compatibility (using `format` instead of `%` as recommended in Python's doc).

I had something like this in mind...

Should be even faster since `getattr` is completely avoided. Moreover, the error message is now much clearer if the object doesn't support mutability.

I don't understand this distinction you're trying to make. If you use this decorator with a method on a class that does not implement an `is_immutable` method, then you get an `AttributeError`. However, it is potentially reasonable for a class to add an attribute `_is_immutable` when it becomes immutable. I agree with your point on not depending on implementation details, but because we are trying to set the API for implementations, I feel like that is somewhat moot. There is also something to be said for having different error messages, but having more flexibility I think trumps this, although just barely.

-I suggest some code improvements. For the decorator check, we require a method `ìs_immutable()` to be implemented and avoid `getattr` completely. Furthermore, the error message is aligned with that from the method `_require_immutable` and in accordance with preexisting error messages of that kind, so that this decorator can conveniently and effortlessly be used for e.g. the manifolds module.
+I suggest some code improvements for the documentation, an additional method `_require_immutable` and Python 3 compatibility.

I think this is good overall. However I have one question and comment:

Why is the `_require_immutable` not a `cpdef` method but instead a Python and `cdef`? I think you need an `except -1` added too.
