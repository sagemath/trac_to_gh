First I thought, I had to pay attention to the lattice, but that is not the issue here. It seems that the equality check depends on the order of the rays.

<a id='comment:2'></a>Thanks for the reply.

Why? Is there a use case for checking that the order is the same?

I would usually assume that `==` checks if two things are mathematically the same, just as `1/1 == 1` evaluates to true. Is the order of the rays even guaranteed to be preserved from input?
