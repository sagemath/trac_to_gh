First I thought, I had to pay attention to the lattice, but that is not the issue here. It seems that the equality check depends on the order of the rays.

You have to use `R1.is_equivalent(R)` or `R.is_equivalent(R1)`. The usual equality check depends on the order of the rays (see the docs for `is_equivalent`).

Thanks for the reply.

Why? Is there a use case for checking that the order is the same?

I would usually assume that `==` checks if two things are mathematically the same, just as `1/1 == 1` evaluates to true. Is the order of the rays even guaranteed to be preserved from input?

If you have things associated to a cone and, for example, variables corresponding to rays and indexed in the same way, then the order of rays is important. I would be strongly opposed to changing this behaviour.
