When jedi is activated, the IPython tab completion tries to access the `__module__` attribute of the tab-completed object

```
sage: ip = get_ipython()
sage: ip.Completer.use_jedi = True
sage: cython("""
....: cdef class A(object):
....:     def __getattr__(self, key):
....:         print('getattr(key={})'.format(key))
....:         raise AttributeError
....: """)
sage: my_custom_name = A()
sage: ip.Completer.all_completions("my_custo")
getattr(key=__module__)
getattr(key=__module__)
['my_custom_name']
```
Note that this is very specific to extension classes and works fine with plain Python classes. 

You can see here that it is specific to jedi

```
sage: ip.Completer.use_jedi = False
sage: ip.Completer.all_completions("my_cu")
['my_custom_name']
```

This access to the `__module__` attribute has dramatic consequence with lazily imported objects that gets imported when accessing any attribute including `__module__`. In the following example, it even leads to a Sage crash on 9.2.rc3 because of badly designed lazy import

```
sage: ip.Completer.all_completions("s")
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
AttributeError: module 'sage.coding.linear_code' has no attribute 'self_orthogonal_binary_codes'
```

Here is the full trace of the calls that lead to the access of `__module__` in the first example above
