In SageMath 9.3.rc0:

```
sage: BrandtModule(23).right_ideals()[0].parent() is None
True
```
The attached branch fixes this by calling `Ideal_fractional.__init__()`.  This also means that the attributes `__basis` and `__quaternion_algebra` are no longer needed.

Two related improvements:
- implement `_richcmp_` rather than `__eq__` and `__ne__`
- add an explicit argument to `__init__` to specify the ambient quaternion algebra, instead of deducing it from the generators.

<a id='comment:3'></a>I didn't know what a Brandt module is, so I found a typo (j,j) in the docs (sage.modular.quatalg.brandt):

```
``A = QuaternionAlgebra(k,a,b)`` returns a quaternion algebra with basis

```

Want to fix that while you're in there? The algebra is over my head, but the refactoring looks reasonable even if I ignore what the words mean.

While fixing this I spotted several other things in the documentation and code of `sage.modular.quatalg.brandt` that I would like to fix, so I prefer making that a separate ticket.

I personally slightly prefer being explicit about the class instead of using `super()`, but this is just a matter of taste.
