}
```
After the fix from this ticket, we should be able to automate syncing upstream packages to the Sage server by using

```
./sage -package download --allow-upstream --on-error=warn :all:
```
followed by 

```
./sage -package upload :all:
```
... if someone is able to set up the necessary credentials for the workflow.

We also add a mechanism to exclude non-distributable tarballs:  If a tarball name includes the pattern `do-not-distribute`, `sage -package upload` now skips it and logs a message.  We change the name of the tarball of `scipoptsuite` accordingly - this is our only non-distributable tarball.

I think this ticket is fine. It fixes

./sage -package download --allow-upstream :all:

as claimed.

```
./sage -package upload :all:
```
needs work yet, which is a seperate issue, I would say.

Of course, both things can be taken care of in this ticket. But one might as well open a seperate ticket.

There is at least an info section missing here https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/packaging.html, so that people are warned when adding new packages.

However, I would prefer it the other way around, even though it is annoying: Have a small sentence in SPKG.rst that we may redistribute. This would be more fool-proof.

Good idea.

> However, I would prefer it the other way around, even though it is annoying: Have a small sentence in SPKG.rst that we may redistribute. This would be more fool-proof.

I disagree. We make free software here; the non-distributable case is an exception for rare cases.

It does not have to be foolproof. We have the review process that so far seems to have successfully stopped people from adding proprietary packages.

If you are interested in adding structured license info to `build/pkgs/`... see #21571.
