CVXPY is a system for disciplined convex programming in which finite dimensional optimization problems are expressed using expression trees.

We monkey-patch caching `_sage_` methods into the CVXPY classes, along the same lines as it is done for SymPy in `sage.interfaces.sympy`.

- Each [leaf](https://www.cvxpy.org/api_reference/cvxpy.expressions.html#leaf) is a scalar, vector or matrix, subject to a domain restriction such as `nonneg` or `PSD`. `_sage_` methods return symbolic variables or expressions or vectors/matrices thereof. `_sage_domain_` methods return the domain as a set. (For the PSD domain, see #30172.) `_sage_manifold_` method returns the pullback (#31688), defining a manifold subset / submanifold etc.

- A subclass of `cvxpy.Problem` would provide a method `feasible_set` an instance of class `ConditionSet_cvxpy` (see #24176) or `ConvexSet_cvxpy`, representing sets of points that satisfy a list of `cvxpy.Constraint`s.
