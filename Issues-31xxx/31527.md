Polymake is available on a number of systems (https://repology.org/project/polymake/versions) and also on Homebrew via a custom tap: https://polymake.org/doku.php/download/start#binary_releases

We add system package info and `spkg-configure.m4`

Fixing broken distribution packages is beyond the scope of the ticket.

Setting this globally unfortunately breaks autotools (`aclocal`) from homebrew:

```
Usage: DynaLoader::dl_find_symbol(libhandle, symbolname) at /usr/local/Cellar/polymake/4.3_1/libexec/perl5/lib/perl5/darwin-thread-multi-2level/XSLoader.pm line 89.
Compilation failed in require at /usr/local/Cellar/polymake/4.3_1/libexec/perl5/lib/perl5/File/Path.pm line 6.
BEGIN failed--compilation aborted at /usr/local/Cellar/polymake/4.3_1/libexec/perl5/lib/perl5/File/Path.pm line 6.
Compilation failed in require at /usr/local/bin/aclocal line 33.
BEGIN failed--compilation aborted at /usr/local/bin/aclocal line 33.
```
Too bad that `polymake-config` does not advertise the necessary Perl library path...

```
USE="cdd flint normaliz libpolymake lrs nauty ppl singular" emerge --ask polymake
```
doesn't work, there is a problem with `lrs` (and Sage installs `polymake` with `lrs`)
Apparently, it's known to Sage, as `spkg-install.in` has a comment:

```
# Since polymake v3.4, it does not find our lrs installation if we do not provide --with-lrs explicitly.
```

Once this is fixed in Gentoo (sorry, I don't grok its ebuilds), `distros/gentoo.txt` should be provided (with appropriate `[..]` options?).

You have to set `USE=bliss` or `USE=nauty`, but not both, to pick a backend for graph automorphism computations.

They don't "fail," portage tells you to pick one because you have to pick one =P

If one is a significantly better choice than the other, we would normally enable that one by default, but I don't know enough about polymake to say that either is better.

What's wrong with lrs?

This does not take away the problem that polymake's configure fails, I cannot imagine it's due to lrs's version.

`perl_cpan_polymake_prereq` does not make sense in `SAGE_SPKG_DEPCHECK` because it is a dummy script package -- we provide no spkg-install for it.

You can add `SAGE_SPKG_DEPCHECK` for `bliss`, `cddlib`, `lrslib`, `readline`, `ppl`, which bring shared libraries.

There seems to be a packaging bug that breaks polymake when `TERM` is set to `dumb` (as we do in the (deprecated) polymake pexpect interface):

it does, I get the same error as from `polymake` in terminal. I get

```
configure:39826: ./conftest
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'pm::perl::exception'
  what():  "/usr/share/polymake/apps/common/perllib/PolyDB.pm", line 23: Can't locate MongoDB.pm in @INC (you may need to install the MongoDB module)
...
```

However, I don't get why you need this extra hack, rather than the result of `perl_mongodb/spkg-configure.m4`, which could be added into `SAGE_SPKG_DEPCHECK`, and which duly reports

```
perl_mongodb-none:                           no suitable system package; optional
```
These perl module packages aren't so dummy after all.

What do you mean it's `dummy` - it does the check for the needed modules!

anyhow, these packages do useful tests on suitability of system `polymake`, as we have discovered here, why not add them to `SAGE_SPKG_DEPCHECK` ?

I don't know what `PolyDB` is, it seems to be an integral part of polymake now.

it's not yet 1am here, and 
it's only wrong if `perl_mongodb` is optional for the latest polymake. Note that Gentoo builds polymake just fine, while there is no Perl MongoDB installed (and the result of the build is broken).

2. Whether system `perl_mongodb` is available or not, we can use system `polymake`.

3. Even if we add an installation script for `perl_mongodb`, installing it as an SPKG does NOT make it necessary to stop using the system polymake (which is what `SAGE_SPKG_DEPCHECK` implements).

Good, then `spkg-configure.m4` (= the scope of this ticket) does its job correctly.

> However, I don't get why you need this extra hack


Not a hack, just a proper runtest for the polymake library.

except that we can't in some cases, see above.
