Follow-up from #29537, #31521.

Observed on `cygwin-standard` but likely also affects the Docker images and the Sage binary distribution.

With the upgrade to numpy 1.20.x (#31008), the non-portability shows as an error message instead of a crash:

```
  [sagelib-9.4.beta0]       from numpy.core._multiarray_umath import (
  [sagelib-9.4.beta0]   RuntimeError: NumPy was built with baseline optimizations: 
  [sagelib-9.4.beta0]   (SSE SSE2 SSE3 SSSE3 SSE41 POPCNT SSE42 AVX F16C FMA3 AVX2 AVX512F AVX512CD AVX512_SKX) but your machine doesn't support:
  [sagelib-9.4.beta0]   (AVX512F).
  [sagelib-9.4.beta0]   ************************************************************************

Actually the place to do it is correct however:

> The command arguments are available in build, build_clib, and build_ext. if build_clib or build_ext are not specified by the user, the arguments of build will be used instead, which also holds the default values.


So this does not work for `bdist_wheel` and this is what we use.
