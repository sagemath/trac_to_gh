Currently, creating a point in a projective space
over a ring accepts any tuple of the correct length
as input, unless all coordinates are zero.

For instance,

```
sage: P2 = ProjectiveSpace(Integers(15), 2)
sage: P2(3, 3, 3)
(3 : 3 : 3)
```
is allowed.

That is a bad convention as they should only be allowed
if they generate the ring. Here, at least one entry
must be a unit.

The equality between points is tested by the equations
`x[i] * y[j] = x[j] * y[i]`.

With the troublesome entries above, this results in errors like

```
sage: a = P2(3, 3, 3)
sage: a2 = P2(1, 1, 1)
sage: b = P2(5, -5, 5)
sage: b2 = P2(1, -1, 1)
sage: [a2 == a, a == b, b == b2, b2 == a2]
[True, True, True, False]
```

I disagree with the ticket's summary.

The projective space over `Z/m`, with m composite,
has two types of points:

- points whose coordinates generate the ring
- points whose coordinates do not generate the ring

Both types of points are valid. See

- [Wikipedia: Projective line over a ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_line_over_a_ring)

Phrased otherwise, not all lines in `(Z/m)^n`
have the same number of points.

Sometimes only points of the first type matter,
other times both types are useful.

Looks good.

Optionally, wrap long lines, e.g. as follows.

```diff
-                    raise ValueError(f"{v} does not define a point in {X.codomain()} since all entries are zero")
+                    raise ValueError(f"{v} does not define a point "
+                                     f"in {X.codomain()} "
+                                     "since all entries are zero")
```

```diff
-                    raise ValueError(f"{v} does not define a point in {X.codomain()} since it is a multiple of a zero divisor")
+                    raise ValueError(f"{v} does not define a point "
+                                     f"in {X.codomain()} since it is "
+                                     "a multiple of a zero divisor")
