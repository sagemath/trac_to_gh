Currently, creating a point in a projective space
over a ring accepts any tuple of the correct length
as input, unless all coordinates are zero.

For instance,

```
sage: P2 = ProjectiveSpace(Integers(15), 2)
sage: P2(3, 3, 3)
(3 : 3 : 3)
```
is allowed.

That is a bad convention as they should only be allowed
if they generate the ring. Here, at least one entry
must be a unit.

The equality between points is tested by the equations
`x[i] * y[j] = x[j] * y[i]`.

With the troublesome entries above, this results in errors like

```
sage: a = P2(3, 3, 3)
sage: a2 = P2(1, 1, 1)
sage: b = P2(5, -5, 5)
sage: b2 = P2(1, -1, 1)
sage: [a2 == a, a == b, b == b2, b2 == a2]
[True, True, True, False]
```

I disagree with the ticket's summary.

The projective space over `Z/m`, with m composite,
has two types of points:

- points whose coordinates generate the ring
- points whose coordinates do not generate the ring

Both types of points are valid. See

- [Wikipedia: Projective line over a ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_line_over_a_ring)

Phrased otherwise, not all lines in `(Z/m)^n`
have the same number of points.

Sometimes only points of the first type matter,
other times both types are useful.

A point in `P^n` over a ring `R` is `(x_0:..x_n)` with `x_0R+...+x_nR = R` quotient by the equivalence relation which is scaling by units in `R`.\nYour second kind is not a point. This agrees with viewing `P^n` as a scheme over R and taking its `R`-valued points.

Replying to [@slel](#comment:5):
> The projective space over `Z/m`, with m composite,

No, I disagree and the linked page as well! A point in `P^n` over a ring `R` is `(x_0:..x_n)` with `x_0R+...+x_nR = R` quotient by the equivalence relation which is scaling by units in `R`.
Your second kind is not a point. This agrees with viewing `P^n` as a scheme over R and taking its `R`-valued points. It follows that `P^1(Z/pq)` is `P^1(Z/p) x P^1(Z/q)`, that it is the union of affine patches as usual, etc.

Your confusion may stem from the following: Not every equivalence class has the same number of elements in `R^(n+1)`. But that is not the issue here (or ever when dealing projective geometry, I believe).

You are of course right. Thanks for unconfusing me.

Does the documentation have examples such as the following?

```
sage: P1 = ProjectiveSpace(Zmod(6), 1)
sage: P1(2, 3)
```

Looks good.

Optionally, wrap long lines, e.g. as follows.

```diff

```
