... we only need to be careful with the method `ambient_dim`, which is the dimension of the polyhedron, not of the space.

So in this ticket we add to the API defined by `ConvexSet_base`:
- the method `ambient`, which is allowed to be a containing convex set, not necessarily a space,
- the method `ambient_vector_space`, which is always a vector space (even if `ambient` is only a free module).
