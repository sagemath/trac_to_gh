As observed, for example, in #31267:
Build SPKG `readline`, build SPKG `singular` (which has the dependency on `readline`); then removing the SPKG `readline` and using the system readline does not trigger a rebuild of `singular`.

This is caused by a shortcoming of our build system: All system packages are represented by the target `$SAGE_LOCAL/var/lib/sage/installed/.dummy` - which is old.

As a solution, we replace use of `.dummy` by separate files that represent system packages in 
`$SAGE_LOCAL/var/lib/sage/system/...`.

These files can just be empty regular files, but in some cases, they could be symlinks to system files, so that an update of a system package triggers the rebuild of a Sage package.

`sage.misc.package` would be extended to also read these installation records.
