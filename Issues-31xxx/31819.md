I specified what I expect in `find_face`. It's a hidden cython method. So I think it is fine to assume things without checking.

It's not a terrible fail, if `self.structure.highest_dimension` was set. This would just be ignored in this case.

This just prevents segmentation fault. It's never supposed to happen anyway. In fact I can't even change this. Because when I set `highest_dimension` it will be equal to `current_dimension`. Only after running this, is `current_dimension` lower, if there are faces left.

If `new_faces_counter` is non-zero, the current dimension is lowered and it holds that `current_dimension < highest_dimension`.\n\nIf `new_faces_counter` is zero and there are no new subfaces, then `next_face_loop` returns `0` and `next_dimension` terminates as `current_dimension = highest_dimension`.\n\nWhenever `next_face_loop` raises the dimension, it will return `0`. This way `next_dimension` will in fact check, that we still have `current_dimension <= highest_dimension`.",

> Why doesn't it prevent visiting the (sub) faces of dimension >= `self.structure.current_dimension`?


I don't understand the question.

`next_dimension` first calls `next_face_loop`. `only_subsets` makes sure that `next_face_loop` actually gets to the point of calling `get_next_level` (unless our face is the the only face left, than there are no new subfaces). If `new_faces_counter` is non-zero, the current dimension is lowered and it holds that `current_dimension < highest_dimension`.

If `new_faces_counter` is zero and there are no new subfaces, then `next_face_loop` returns `0` and `next_dimension` terminates as `current_dimension = highest_dimension`.

Whenever `next_face_loop` raises the dimension, it will return `0`. This way `next_dimension` will in fact check, that we still have `current_dimension <= highest_dimension`.

I meant to change to `if unlikely(self.structure.current_dimension > self.structure.highest_dimension):` like all other checkings.

Sure, if it never happens, then the current version is fine.

That's what I figure you meant. But it does not work. E.g. when you want to only visit the elements below the first facet, the highest dimension will be set to `d-2`. But current dimension is `d-1`. Only after `next_face_loop` is called has the dimension changed to `d-2`. This is different from the start. At the start the facets are already known and hence the dimension starts at `d-1`. But when you want to visit everything below something, the elements below have not been computed yet.

I could set this up differently, if you find it confusing and make `only_subsets` call `next_face_loop` once.
