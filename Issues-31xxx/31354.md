so that it works for QQ too.

Before this ticket:

```
sage: QQ.zeta_function()
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
AttributeError: 'RationalField_with_category' object
has no attribute 'zeta_function'
```
After this ticket:

```
sage: QQ.zeta_function()
PARI zeta function associated to Rational Field
```

yes, this is just moving code around. Plus adding one doctest in TESTS:

The motivation: `QQ.zeta_function` was a not implemented method.

Now QQ has a `zeta_function` method, as well as any member of the category of number fields.

No change in functionality for other number fields.

Looks good to me.  I have not built the branch myself, and would like to, to make sure that the methods of the zeta function returned (which is of course the Riemann Zeta function) work.  That will take a little time...

The docstring says that the algorithm defaults to 'gp' but (a) it doesn't, it defaults to 'pari', and (b)

```
sage: QQ.zeta_function(algorithm='gp')
...
AttributeError: 'RationalField_with_category' object has no attribute 'absolute_polynomial'
```
This can be fixed by changing the line mentioning self.absolute_polynomial() to

```
s = 'nf = nfinit(%s);' % polygen(self) if self.degree() == 1 else self.absolute_polynomial()
```
with also an additional import

```
from sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_ring import polygen
```
a few lines earlier.  Or -- perhaps better? -- add methods polynomial(), absolute_polynomial(), defining_polynomial() to the RationalField class, to avoid such things once and for all.  (I very often add methods to RationalField to match methods available for number fields.)

And change the docstring to admit that 'pari' is the default -- so I am not sure why the default is 'None' which is the changed to 'pari' instead of being set to 'pari' i nthe first place!
