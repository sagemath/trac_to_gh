It was not possible to specify an arbitrary folder as the output of the docbuild, because the citation extension had an assertion that checked that the output directory was a subfolder of `SAGE_DOC`. This check is replaced by providing some default folder for the citations in case the output directory is not below `SAGE_DOC`. 

This is allows to build the documentation by running `sphinx` manually, which is required by some tools (e.g. the restructuredtext extension for VS code provides a HTML preview of the currently edited rst file by running sphinx on it).


I also used the opportunity to convert the code in question to use pathlib.
