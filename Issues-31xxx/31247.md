We have currently the following bug:

```
sage: from sage.categories.functor import ForgetfulFunctor
sage: F = ForgetfulFunctor(Rings(), Sets())
sage: F(ZZ)
Integer Ring
```

The result should rather be:

```
sage: Set(ZZ)
Set of elements of Integer Ring
```
so that:
- `F(ZZ).category()` gives `InfiniteEnumeratedSets()`
- ... and thus `Hom(F(ZZ), ...)` will construct morphisms in the correct category
- it uses equality as sets, not as rings

Digging into the source code, the forgetful functor `F` calls the following code from its class parent `Functor`:

```python
    def _apply_functor(self, x):
        """
        Apply the functor to an object of ``self``'s domain.

        NOTE:

        Each subclass of :class:`Functor` should overload this method. By default,
        this method coerces into the codomain, without checking whether the
        argument belongs to the domain.

        TESTS::

            sage: from sage.categories.functor import Functor
            sage: F = Functor(FiniteFields(),Fields())
            sage: F._apply_functor(ZZ)
            Rational Field

        """
        return self.__codomain(x)
```

Here, `__codomain` should be the destination category. However, the call function of a category is treated as some kind of coercion/conversion:

```python
    def __call__(self, x, *args, **opts):
        """
        Construct an object in this category from the data in ``x``,
        or throw ``TypeError`` or ``NotImplementedError``.

        If ``x`` is readily in ``self`` it is returned unchanged.
        Categories wishing to extend this minimal behavior should
        implement :meth:`._call_`.

        EXAMPLES::

            sage: Rings()(ZZ)
            Integer Ring
        """
        if x in self:
            return x
        return self._call_(x, *args, **opts)
```

as the following note in `sage/categories/sets_cat.py` indicates, too:

```python
    def _call_(self, X, enumerated_set=False):
        r"""
        Construct an object in this category from the data ``X``.

        INPUT:

        - ``X`` -- an object to be converted into a set

        - ``enumerated_set`` -- if set to ``True`` and the input is either a
          Python tuple or a Python list then the output will be a finite
          enumerated set.

        EXAMPLES::

            sage: Sets()(ZZ)
            Integer Ring
            sage: Sets()([1, 2, 3])
            {1, 2, 3}

            sage: S = Sets()([1, 2, 3]); S.category()
            Category of finite sets
            sage: S = Sets()([1, 2, 3], enumerated_set=True); S.category()
            Category of facade finite enumerated sets

        .. NOTE::

           Using ``Sets()(A)`` used to implement some sort of forgetful functor
           into the ``Sets()`` category. This feature has been removed, because
           it was not consistent with the semantic of :meth:`Category.__call__`.
           Proper forgetful functors will eventually be implemented, with

Then, the same would hold for manifolds in #31241. Differentiable manifolds are also in the category of topological manifolds (or at least should be). But we already agreed that it's a bug there. What is the difference then?

> I think if you want to change your object, you should call the explicit constructor rather than relying on a functor. Moreover, if it is not going to be the current behavior, then I think you're asking for a solution to an impossible problem.

Well, the forgetful functor has the purpose to forget imposed structures, and see the object as an object in the super category only. This condition is currently not met:

```
sage: from sage.categories.functor import ForgetfulFunctor 
....: F = ForgetfulFunctor(Rings(), Sets()) 
....: F(ZZ).category()                                                    
Join of Category of euclidean domains and Category of infinite enumerated sets and Category of metric spaces
sage: F(ZZ)(1) + F(ZZ)(2)                                                       
3
```

Usual set operations are not even compatible:

```
sage: Set([1,2,3]).union(F(ZZ))                                                    
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
...
TypeError: X (=Integer Ring) must be a Set
```


Of course, different structures need different implementations.

For manifolds, the current stage of behavior is rather bad. Differentiable manifolds can be seen as topological manifolds, however each differentiable manifold comes with a differentiable structure which Sage keeps implicitly track of. This must be dropped after the forgetful functor had been applied. But with the above behavior, this is not possible because the original instance would be returned.

I hoped to compute the correct category of an image in #32121 (Replace `MapCombinatorialClass`, add methods `Map.image`, `Map.pushforward`)...

This in and of itself is not a bug IMO as per [comment:4](#comment%3A4). However, what is a bug IMO is that

```
sage: F(phi).parent()
Set of Homomorphisms from Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Rational Field
 to Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Rational Field
```
which leads to this

```
sage: F(phi).category_for()
Join of Category of euclidean domains
 and Category of commutative algebras over (number fields and quotient fields and metric spaces)
 and Category of infinite sets
```
For morphisms, where the category is part of the homset constructor, we can create the new homset parent and then convert the morphism into that parent. Mostly this just consists of rebuilding the same object but with a different parent. This is meaningful when we want to compose maps (as opposed to manipulating sets).

Mathematically one would, of course, say that the forgetful functor should act like the identity on a parent.

But our parents are equipped with a distinguished category.

So the forgetful functor needs to construct a new parent in which the distinguished category is replaced by the codomain.

That strongly depends on how mathematically precise you want to connect a parent to its mathematical model. Strictly speaking, `ZZ` is just a set, but the ring of integers is really `(ZZ, +, *)` with distinguished binary operations `+: ZZ x ZZ -> ZZ` and `*: ZZ x ZZ -> ZZ`. However, the "ring" `ZZ` is just modeling the set and it is the implementation of the elements that carry the information of `+` and `*`. However, if you never add or multiply the elements together, then `1` is just an element of the set `ZZ`.

> But our parents are equipped with a distinguished category.

I think it is better to treat it like "this is the smallest category where this object (currently) makes sense to belong to."

> So the forgetful functor needs to construct a new parent in which the distinguished category is replaced by the codomain.

I still contest that the set of objects is still the set of objects. Equality is not always the mathematical equality you are thinking of (which we actually often think of as being "isomorphic to").

Even allowing that we wanted a new parent, this would be an impossible problem to solve as we would either have to have a class for the forgetful functor for each category (a huge number) or we would need to know which methods to remove (any parent can implement their own custom version or ones that only make sense in category `C'` not its super category `C`).

If the user wants to do equality as some other type of object, then we should tell the user to build other type. For example, `Set(ZZ)` to do equality as a `Set` object.

Morphisms already have a hook for specifying the category. This might not be fully implemented, but if we wanted to consider the isomorphism `x |-> 2x` of **Q** as a **Q**-vector space, but it doesn't make sense as a ring morphism. The forgetful functor should change the category of the morphism.

I agree that it is impossible to solve in general. 

That should not stop us from implementing it for useful cases. In #34384, I implement it for `codomain=Sets()`.

There's warnings for the rest. We could also raise a `NotImplementedError`.

No and no. It is well-defined based upon what is implemented. It is not tautological because, e.g., `ZZ` is also in `Sets()`. Furthermore, saying it is tautological makes no sense because then any definition involving "the smallest" would be tautological.

You just tried to make a point about it. In fact, having a framework for multiple types of elements has been a wishlist item for a while.

If you do not mean it in that way, which is what typically means by "distinguished", then the result of `category()` is irrelevant.

Whether you have just one element class or multiple element classes -- the parent is still equipped with the *list* of the element classes that can be used with it. 

And therefore, once more, the distinction of whether the operations are carried in the parent or in the elements is irrelevant.

Yes, because equality as XYZ is a statement about maps in the category XYZ.

Which is why the forgetful functor when applied to a parent with a distinguished category needs to return a parent with the changed category.

Yes, `Set(...)` is the forgetful functor, sending the parent with a distinguished category `C` to a parent whose distinguished category is a full subcategory of `Sets()`.

#34384 makes this functor available systematically as the `ForgetfulFunctor(..., Sets())`. That's all

Isomorphism is not equality. It is very important not to confuse the two. As soon as you start talking about maps, you are talking isomorphism. In fact, I don't think many category theorists even talk about equality (everything is up to isomorphism).

Changing the implementation is not a mathematical operation. It is a programming one. This further reinforces that we should be talking about Python `==`, not mathematical equality. The distinguished category has nothing to do with its mathematical equality statement.

> Completely unrelated to the "equality of representations" issues that you talked about.

So `==` should always be mathematical equality, in some definition that you have not made precise? What about the cases when we want this isomorphic to (this occurs in permutation groups) or when no canonical representative exists (e.g., elements in the symbolic ring or for manifolds). We could go for this, but then should we remove code that doesn't comply or things that do not have canonical representatives? If we allow `==` for non-canoical representatives, then what makes those cases special compared to these parents?

We can do this, but that is just some semmantic sugar with making `Set()` a distinguished object in the category `Sets()` for the `ForgetfulFunctor()`. I have no objections. What I do have a strong objection to is saying if it did not do that, then it is a bug.

No, they do not. `Hom` takes a `category` argument to specify the category the morphism belongs to:

```
sage: Hom(QQ, ZZ)
Set of Homomorphisms from Rational Field to Integer Ring
sage: Hom(QQ, ZZ, category=Sets())
Set of Morphisms from Rational Field to Integer Ring in Category of sets
```

You are implicitly changing the requirements (and hence, the definition) by calling something a bug that IMSO should not be (nor has it previously been considered to be AFAIK).

If I have a new ring structure on **Z**, lets call it `TT`, then `ZZ == TT` would be `False`. Now if we apply the forgetful functor to them, they would still be false. I am saying this is fine and proper because they are different representations of the same set, but you are saying it is a bug.

We just usually suppress it from notion as context determines, just like what is done here. Now I will concede that applying the forgetful functor should make it clear what category we want to do it in, but that is just breaking the syntactic (semantic?) sugar.

Mathematically, any homset should also take the category as input. We just usually suppress it from notion as context determines, just like what is done here. Now I will concede that applying the forgetful functor should make it clear what category we want to do it in, but that is just breaking the syntactic (semantic?) sugar. You would rather try to solve an impossible problem than simply telling the user to type fewer characters with a more intuitive semantic?

I wouldn't say that it's fine and proper; I'd say there is an implementation restriction that stops us from detecting that they are equal. Sage is of course full of such implementation restrictions. 

A proper implementation of the forgetful functor will improve this situation: It removes the implementation restriction.

This is not evidence of anything about a general bug for `ForgetfulFunctor`. That is about this category's implementation of `__call__`, which is what `ForgetfulFunctor` does. If `F: C -> D`, then `F(X)` is performs `D(x)`. It is up to each category to impose how it wants to perform its `__call__`, which is an implementation detail.

Then the fact that two "equal" things are not equal is not a bug. Hence, the fact that forgetful functor does not necessarily return a new object, which could lead to a different `==` implementation, is not a bug.

No it does not. If you want `==` as instances of `Set`, you should explicitly make your objects instances of `Set`. It doesn't matter what the category an object belongs to. The implementation is what carries the meaning of `==`. Let the category decide what it wants to do with `__call__`. That is what the forgetful functor does.

Coercion is not involved:

```python
    Category.__call__(self, x, *args, **opts):
        if x in self:
            return x
        return self._call_(x, *args, **opts)

The coercion system is not mentioned in the note or in any of the relevant code.

The documentation of `Category__call__` even specifies:

```
        If ``x`` is readily in ``self`` it is returned unchanged.
        Categories wishing to extend this minimal behavior should
        implement :meth:`._call_`.
```
This is further direct documentation evidence that even categories do not want to change objects of subcategories. This is not a bug.

This makes no sense to me. The coercion system, which only operates on *elements*, makes no requirements on the syntax nor semantics of `__call__`, much less for things that are not parents (as a way of creating elements).

No, the `ForgetfulFunctor` is just not fully implemented. 

It does not even have its own `_apply_functor` method, it is just taking the one from `Functor`.

And this code is from 2010, whereas the comment in `sets_cat.py` regarding the lack of "proper forgetful functors" is from 2015.

To me the "coercion system" includes the functorial constructions for parents etc. It won't be useful to discuss this terminology.

The term "coercion system" has a clear set meaning within Sage. I agree the terminology you use is not important, but it will cause confusion if it conflicts with something else.

That being said, I don't think there are any set rules like the ones you are trying to invoke. All that is required is the output of any functor is some object that is in the category. Just like applying a morphism only requires that the result is an element the parent codomain, not that it needs to have a specific implementation. Sometimes this can cause some headaches, but those are the things the user needs to be wary of.

Can you clarify - you are disagreeing with the comment in sets_cat.py from Florent's commit? For reference again:

           Using `Sets()(A)` used to implement some sort of forgetful functor
           into the `Sets()` category. This feature has been removed, because
           it was not consistent with the semantic of `Category.__call__`.
           Proper forgetful functors will eventually be implemented, with
           another syntax.

And `Category.__call__` is unambiguous:

        Categories wishing to extend this minimal behavior should

"extending" this minimal behavior means to do more things when `x` is *not* in `self`.

I don't know of any consistency rule you want with the result of `ForgetfulFunctor`. As far as I know, we don't have any requirements other than `F(X) in Sets()` returns `True`, where the codomain of the (forgetful) functor `F` is `Sets()`.

I agree fully with the first part; it was inconsistent. I don't know what Florent was intending by the word "proper" for the latter part; in particular the semantics on the result. However, I am very wary of changing current allowed behaviors (and definitions) in ways that says we should try to solve impossible problems with huge maintenance burdens in our code base.

Not for the image of functors; that is only the `Category.__call__`. For the implementation of `ForgetfulFunctor`, it was chosen to just do the result of `Category.__call__`. In fact, the `NOTE:` in `Functor._apply_functor` indicates that subclasses are allowed to change the default behavior to suit their needs.

I didn't have time to carefully read the whole discussion, yet. But concerning the discussion about "equality", here are 2 cents:

`2==4/2` is true, when `ZZ` and `QQ` are considered as rings, because there is a coercion from `ZZ` to `QQ` that is a morphism in the category of rings. IMHO, it makes sense to request that applying the forgetful functor to a coercion morphism (in a smaller category) yields a coercion morphism (in a larger category). Hence, `2==4/2` should be true also in the category of sets (the usual coercion morphism of rings would be applied as a coercion morphism of sets).

The opposite problem is more tricky. I have no concise example, but I could imagine that there are two rings `(R,+,*)` and `(S,+,*)` such that there is a meaningful coercion map between abelian groups `(R,+)` and `(S,+)` that is not a ring morphism. Hence, if `F` is the forgetful functor from `Rings()` to `AbelianGroups()`, it may very well be possible that there is `a in R` and `b in S` such that `F(R)(a) == F(S)(b)` should evaluate as true (because `a,b` can be coerced as elements of abelian groups), but `a == b` should evaluate as false (because there is no coercion of rings).

And that would indeed be difficult to implement.

You need to pick your definition of "distinguished" as you are going between "this is an object in this category" and "this category is just considered special to this object" when it suits you. If the category is just special, then no new object needs to be returned because it still is an object in that category.

Because our parents are equipped with a distinguished category (i.e., mathematically they are pair of: (1) an object in the category of objects and (2) a category in the category of categories)), when we apply the `ForgetfulFunctor`, we need to return a new parent with a new distinguished category (i.e., mathematically, a pair of (1) new object, (2) new category).

If it is just some category that has special meaning for the defaults for some inputs, then there is no bug here with `ForgetfulFunctor(ZZ, codomain=Sets())` returning `ZZ`. You don't have to remember about the structure that puts it into `Rings()`. Everything that depends on the category of the object, such as `Hom` has an input for the user to set the category.

Basically, this leads us right into the absurd. A parent is not modeling this pair.

A parent is just modeling the set of elements. Nothing more, nothing less. It has some things associated to it, such as having a distinguished category, that tells you things you can do on it. However, it is just meant to be the set.

Yes, the problem of deciding whether a given morphism can be lifted to a subcategory is very hard. For morphisms between finite parents, there would probably be a trivial algorithm, but it would depend on the specific categories whether an efficient algorithm is available. For morphisms between infinite parents, this will often be undecidable.

Fortunately, this problem does not need to be solved for this ticket.

Equality of parents is clearly a very complicated topic that involves multiple issues, at least the following:
- on the programming level, equality (`==`) vs identity (`is`), `UniqueRepresentation`
- on the programming level, the hash/equality contract (both on elements and on parents) and its many violations in Sage

- the semantics of mutable objects

A general discussion of this topic will not lead very far. But a key question to answer is:
- What is an identity morphism?

I would say it is at least an injective coercion morphism.
So this example by Travis:
> What about more abstract parents? Should all three dimensional free modules over a field `k` be equal since they all could be considered as `k`<sup>3</sup> (in particular, by the method `to_vector()` in `ModulesWithBasis()`)? How do we even want to decide?

There would be no coercion morphisms between these modules in general, so the answer would be "no". (Yes, the implementation of (ambient) free modules in `sage.modules` does make them `UniqueRepresentation`, so for these there would be a trivial "yes".)

I'd suggest to start discussing this question in a simpler context than equality of parents, namely the specification of an `is_subset` method for (enumerated) sets (#34398). 

Naively, `S.is_subset(T)` would be equivalent to `all(x in T for x in S)`. But because `x in T` is subject to the discovery of coercion maps, we can ask for a stricter test than this pointwise test.
