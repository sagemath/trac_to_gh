Installing "sdist + patches" is not supported by Python package infrastructure.

We review existing patches, and for those packages that still need them, we create a repository fork and create and deposit an sdist tarball from here.

Tickets:

- #31967/#31280 `rst2ipynb`: Update to 0.2.3 to remove patching
- #32691 `setuptools`: Upgrade to 58.2.0, remove old `easy_install` patch
- #32832 `cython`: Eliminate use of custom patches
- #32828 `pyzmq`

Packages with patches can be found as follows:

```
$ ./sage -package list --has-file install-requires.txt --has-file patches | sort
cvxopt
cypari
cython
dot2tex
ipywidgets
notedown
numpy
pillow
psutil
rpy2
setuptools
sphinx
widgetsnbextension
```

Also, some Python packages need specific settings of environment variables at build time. Example: #21170 (pypolymake); a new package script such as `spkg-env` could set these (#29045)

Finally, some packages may install custom configurations, such as the `notebook` package's `jupyter_notebook_config.py` that currently gets installed into ` "$SAGE_INST_LOCAL"/etc/jupyter`.

In #30371, no patches to python packages are applied (as the packages used there come directly from pypi completely bypassing sages package infrastructure).
The only real test failures on ubuntu are:
