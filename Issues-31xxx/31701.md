This method compares `self` and `other`. If they are both polyhedra, then <= means "is contained in", and < means "is strictly contained in".

Bug example:

```
sage: p1 = Polyhedron(vertices=[(1, 1), (0, 0), (1, 2)])
sage: p2 = Polyhedron(vertices=[(1, 2), (0, 0), (0, 2)])
sage: p2 < p1
False
sage: p1 > p2
True
```

It seems that the bug comes from line 707 of `sage/geometry/polyhedron/base.py`, where the code forgets one of the four cases.
