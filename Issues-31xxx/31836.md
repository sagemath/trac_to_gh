TypeError: __call__() takes at least 1 positional argument (0 given)
```

Expected : 

```
sage: CDF()
0.0
```

Most real field implementations rely on `Parent.__call__` while complex ones have to define their own `__call__` method in order to accept constructions like `CC(a,b)`, but the implementation of `CDF` misses the empty case.
