```
On macOS, even when using `gcc -isysroot /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX10.15.sdk` (which disables use of `/usr/local`), Singular's `configure` script sneaks in `/usr/local/include` and `/usr/local/lib`.

```
It was created by singular configure 4.2.0p1+2021-03-13+sage, which was
generated by GNU Autoconf 2.69.  Invocation command line was

  $ ./configure --prefix=/var/tmp/sage-9.3.rc0-cpython-38-darwin/local --libdir=/var/tmp/sage-9.3.rc0-cpython-38-darwin/local/lib --disable-maintainer-mode

If NTL from homebrew is installed, this can lead to an NTL threading mismatch:

But the problem is real - Singular will not use gmp that can be found by compiler and linker if it finds `/usr/local/include/gmp.h`
This ought to be fixed upstream.
