```
On macOS, even when using `gcc -isysroot /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX10.15.sdk` (which disables use of `/usr/local`), Singular's `configure` script sneaks in `/usr/local/include` and `/usr/local/lib`.

```
It was created by singular configure 4.2.0p1+2021-03-13+sage, which was
generated by GNU Autoconf 2.69.  Invocation command line was

  $ ./configure --prefix=/var/tmp/sage-9.3.rc0-cpython-38-darwin/local --libdir=/var/tmp/sage-9.3.rc0-cpython-38-darwin/local/lib --disable-maintainer-mode

If NTL from homebrew is installed, this can lead to an NTL threading mismatch:

Picking up a newer upstream spielwiese HEAD (which contains a few new commits that look like bugfixes) plus two new PRs: https://github.com/Singular/Singular/pull/1066 and https://github.com/Singular/Singular/pull/1067; the new tarball is made from tag  https://github.com/mkoeppe/Singular/tree/singular-4.2.0p1+2021-03-24%2Bsage-2

Recipe for making the tarball: From within a Sage shell, I used `./configure --with-ntl=/usr/local --with-gmp=/usr/local --disable-pyobject-module --enable-doc-build --with-libparse && make && make dist`
