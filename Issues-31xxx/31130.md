Latte probably raises an error here, which we fail to communicate. The `RuntimeError` was never tested.

Thanks and sorry: The second doctest that I added did not contain an error message and therefore is working fine with and without this ticket.

I replaced by the doctest from this ticket that includes an error message now (and wasn't working before).

I don't think so. #31046 reports some doctest failures. But we don't know which ones, because there is no proper error message. Now that this ticket is closed, we can hope that we can a proper report of this message.

Well, we could also close #31046 and wait until the error shows up again.
