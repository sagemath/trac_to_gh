(from #30315)

As previously observed in #30324, the `SAGE_CHECK` logic implemented in #30118 and improved in #29766 still does not work correctly with dependencies conditionalized on `SAGE_CHECK`.

We fix it (again...?!) by moving the computation of the `SAGE_CHECK_...` variables earlier, before the dependencies are evaluated.

To test it, we conditionalize `sagetex` dependencies on `SAGE_CHECK`:

```
$ make sagetex-clean jmol-clean
$ make sagetex                    # should NOT build jmol
$ make sagetex-clean
$ SAGE_CHECK=yes make sagetex     # now it builds jmol
```
