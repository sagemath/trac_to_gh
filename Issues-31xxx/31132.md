As previously discussed in #30745, `/usr/local` is leaking into our build, through wrong orders of include and/or library directives.

In #30745, this problem was not fixed but rather some more packages were found to be usable on homebrew, so distro information was added.

The problem has been reported again with `pari` (building `cypari2`) in #31029/#30589.

This is caused by a misconfigured `python3`. In this ticket, we add code to detect this problem when looking for the system python at configure time.

```
Checking whether SageMath should install SPKG python3...
checking whether any of libpng bzip2 xz libffi is installed as or will be installed as SPKG... no
checking for python3 >= 3.6.0, < 3.10.0 with modules sqlite3, ctypes, math, hashlib, crypt, readline, socket, zlib, distutils.core... 
checking ... whether /usr/local/bin/python3 is good... no, this is a misconfigured Python whose sysconfig compiler/linker flags contain -I or -L options, which may cause wrong versions of libraries to leak into the build of Python packages - see https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/31132; to use it anyway, use ./configure --with-python=/usr/local/bin/python3
checking ... whether /usr/bin/python3 is good... yes
checking for python3 >= 3.6.0, < 3.10.0 with modules sqlite3, ctypes, math, hashlib, crypt, readline, socket, zlib, distutils.core... /usr/bin/python3
configure: will use system package and not install SPKG python3
```
When `--with-python=...` is used, only a warning is issued.

I discovered another annoying leak while testing.  I have octave installed via homebrew and one of its dependencies is qhull.  With qhull installed via homebrew if I build sage and run


```
./sage -tp 8 --long --warn-long 31.1 --random-seed=0 src/sage/plot/plot3d/list_plot3d.py
```

then it crashes with


```
sage: m = matrix(RDF, 6, [sin(i^2 + j^2) for i in [0,pi/5,..,pi] for j in [0,pi/5,..,pi]]) ## line 379 ##
sage: list_plot3d(m, color='yellow', interpolation_type='linear', num_points=5) # indirect doctest ## line 380 ##
QH6249 qh_lib_check: Incorrect qhull library called.  Size of qhT for caller is 2896, but for library is 2792.
QH6256 qh_lib_check: Cannot continue.  Library 'qhull 7.2.0 (2015.2 2016/01/18)' uses a static qhT (e.g., libqhull.so)
```

I was able to track the problem down to matplotlib.  If I do:

make matplotlib-clean

brew unlink qhull

make matplotlib

brew link qhull


then the tests pass without any issues.

Not for me:

```

...
checking for /usr/bin/python3... /usr/bin/python3
checking ... whether /usr/bin/python3 is good... no, the version is in the supported range, and the modules can be imported, but distutils cannot build a C extension

I think that building using the included version of Python 3 on OS X is not required for this — Sage can just build its own Python — but in case anyone wants to help troubleshoot, here is an excerpt from `config.log`:

Looks like there are two missing libraries, readline and zlib.  For brew, readline is "keg only", and I get the following message when I install it:

```
readline is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local,
because macOS provides BSD libedit.

For compilers to find readline you may need to set:
  export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/readline/lib"
  export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/readline/include"

For pkg-config to find readline you may need to set:
  export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/opt/readline/lib/pkgconfig"
```
I didn't check, but likely zlib is similar. The fix should be to tell `configure` to look in `/usr/local/opt/readline` in addition to `/usr/local`.

The `-arch arm64 -arch x86_64` there looks scary.

I tested this by installing as many homebrew packages as I can, and then building with --with-system-python3=no and everything builds correctly at least on Big Sur.  Of course --with-system-python3=no is currently necessary since otherwise configure will use /usr/bin/python3 which needs #31228 to work.

On another note, when I test I see lots of warnings of the form:


```
ld: warning: dylib (/usr/local/lib/libmpfr.dylib) was built for newer macOS version (10.15) than being linked (10.9)
ld: warning: dylib (/usr/local/lib/libgmp.dylib) was built for newer macOS version (10.15) than being linked (10.9)
ld: warning: dylib (/usr/local/lib/libgmpxx.dylib) was built for newer macOS version (10.15) than being linked (10.9)
ld: warning: dylib (/usr/local/lib/libgsl.dylib) was built for newer macOS version (10.15) than being linked (10.9)
ld: warning: dylib (/usr/local/lib/libntl.dylib) was built for newer macOS version (10.15) than being linked (10.9)
```

I did a little bit of poking, and it appears this might be caused by src/bin/sage-env setting MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET to 10.9.  Maybe we can open a ticket for this? The source code for sage-env mentions that this was done in response to #7095, which is a ticket from 11 years ago.

I think I had to do `brew update` first, which displayed some instructions regarding unshallowing, after which I ran `brew update` again.

This is now rejecting the system python on Gentoo, I guess because of the `-L` in `LDFLAGS`:

```
$ python3 -m sysconfig
...
CONFIGURE_LDFLAGS = "-Wl,-O1 -Wl,--as-needed -L."
LDFLAGS = "-Wl,-O1 -Wl,--as-needed -L."
```

That is added to our python build for obsolete reasons (there is no Gentoo/FreeBSD anymore):

```
# Set LDFLAGS so we link modules with -lpython3.2 correctly.                                                                                                             
# Needed on FreeBSD unless Python 3.2 is already installed.                                                                                                              
# Please query BSD team before removing this!                                                                                                                            
append-ldflags "-L."
```

Can someone briefly summarize the problem that this `-L.` causes, so that I can get it removed?
