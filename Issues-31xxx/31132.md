As previously discussed in #30745, `/usr/local` is leaking into our build, through wrong orders of include and/or library directives.

In #30745, this problem was not fixed but rather some more packages were found to be usable on homebrew, so distro information was added.

The problem has been reported again with `pari` (building `cypari2`) in #31029/#30589.

This is caused by a misconfigured `python3`. In this ticket, we add code to detect this problem when looking for the system python at configure time.

```
Checking whether SageMath should install SPKG python3...
checking whether any of libpng bzip2 xz libffi is installed as or will be installed as SPKG... no
checking for python3 >= 3.6.0, < 3.10.0 with modules sqlite3, ctypes, math, hashlib, crypt, readline, socket, zlib, distutils.core... 
checking ... whether /usr/local/bin/python3 is good... no, this is a misconfigured Python whose sysconfig compiler/linker flags contain -I or -L options, which may cause wrong versions of libraries to leak into the build of Python packages - see https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31132; to use it anyway, use ./configure --with-python=/usr/local/bin/python3
checking ... whether /usr/bin/python3 is good... yes
checking for python3 >= 3.6.0, < 3.10.0 with modules sqlite3, ctypes, math, hashlib, crypt, readline, socket, zlib, distutils.core... /usr/bin/python3
configure: will use system package and not install SPKG python3
```
When `--with-python=...` is used, only a warning is issued.

I discovered another annoying leak while testing.  I have octave installed via homebrew and one of its dependencies is qhull.  With qhull installed via homebrew if I build sage and run


```
./sage -tp 8 --long --warn-long 31.1 --random-seed=0 src/sage/plot/plot3d/list_plot3d.py
```

then it crashes with


```
sage: m = matrix(RDF, 6, [sin(i^2 + j^2) for i in [0,pi/5,..,pi] for j in [0,pi/5,..,pi]]) ## line 379 ##
sage: list_plot3d(m, color='yellow', interpolation_type='linear', num_points=5) # indirect doctest ## line 380 ##
QH6249 qh_lib_check: Incorrect qhull library called.  Size of qhT for caller is 2896, but for library is 2792.
QH6256 qh_lib_check: Cannot continue.  Library 'qhull 7.2.0 (2015.2 2016/01/18)' uses a static qhT (e.g., libqhull.so)
```

I was able to track the problem down to matplotlib.  If I do:

make matplotlib-clean\\
brew unlink qhull\\
make matplotlib\\
brew link qhull\\

then the tests pass without any issues.

Let's see what the homebrew maintainers do with this.

For now the best thing we can do is detect the issue and print a warning (or we could reject the homebrew python with this issue entirely.)

Not for me:

```

...
checking for /usr/bin/python3... /usr/bin/python3
checking ... whether /usr/bin/python3 is good... no, the version is in the supported range, and the modules can be imported, but distutils cannot build a C extension

I think that building using the included version of Python 3 on OS X is not required for this — Sage can just build its own Python — but in case anyone wants to help troubleshoot, here is an excerpt from `config.log`:

I don't think I've ever tried building python3 from scratch since I always have relied on homebrew's version, so I'm not sure where this is coming from.

This looks like a complication that may have come in through #27122

I think we need the upgrade to python 3.9 for this in #30589

Looks like there are two missing libraries, readline and zlib.  For brew, readline is "keg only", and I get the following message when I install it:

```
readline is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local,
because macOS provides BSD libedit.

For compilers to find readline you may need to set:
  export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/readline/lib"
  export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/readline/include"

For pkg-config to find readline you may need to set:
  export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/opt/readline/lib/pkgconfig"
```
I didn't check, but likely zlib is similar. The fix should be to tell `configure` to look in `/usr/local/opt/readline` in addition to `/usr/local`.

The `-arch arm64 -arch x86_64` there looks scary.

Could you post the whole config.log please

I tested this by installing as many homebrew packages as I can, and then building with --with-system-python3=no and everything builds correctly at least on Big Sur.  Of course --with-system-python3=no is currently necessary since otherwise configure will use /usr/bin/python3 which needs #31228 to work.

On another note, when I test I see lots of warnings of the form:


```
ld: warning: dylib (/usr/local/lib/libmpfr.dylib) was built for newer macOS version (10.15) than being linked (10.9)
ld: warning: dylib (/usr/local/lib/libgmp.dylib) was built for newer macOS version (10.15) than being linked (10.9)

ld: warning: dylib (/usr/local/lib/libntl.dylib) was built for newer macOS version (10.15) than being linked (10.9)
```

I did a little bit of poking, and it appears this might be caused by src/bin/sage-env setting MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET to 10.9.  Maybe we can open a ticket for this? The source code for sage-env mentions that this was done in response to #7095, which is a ticket from 11 years ago.

That's right, this mechanism deactivates the old code in `sage-env` when we use system python3 instead of building our own python.

This is now rejecting the system python on Gentoo, I guess because of the `-L` in `LDFLAGS`:

```
$ python3 -m sysconfig
...
CONFIGURE_LDFLAGS = "-Wl,-O1 -Wl,--as-needed -L."
LDFLAGS = "-Wl,-O1 -Wl,--as-needed -L."
```

That is added to our python build for obsolete reasons (there is no Gentoo/FreeBSD anymore):

```
# Set LDFLAGS so we link modules with -lpython3.2 correctly.                                                                                                             
# Needed on FreeBSD unless Python 3.2 is already installed.                                                                                                              
# Please query BSD team before removing this!

Can someone briefly summarize the problem that this `-L.` causes, so that I can get it removed?
