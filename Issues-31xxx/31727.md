Follow-up from #31718.

This ticket proposes to deprecate `list_of_subsets` (note - no other methods in `sage.manifolds` follow this naming scheme) in favor of a new method `subset_family`, which prints in a more compact way, is hashable, and is sorted by name too.

We also add `superset_family` (previously the set of supersets was not exposed by a method).

We also add `open_superset_family` (to complement `open_superset` added in #31677).
