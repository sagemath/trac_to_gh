As illustrated by the following code, constructing a crystal of tableaux given a fundamental weight using `crystals.HighestWeight` does not always work.  Specifically, it fails for the spin representations, and for Cartan types `F_4`, `E_6`, `E_7` and `E_8`.

This is only a tentative fix.  The special case `G2` looks silly to me.  Also, I think we should raise an error for type `E` and `F` and `model="Tableaux"`, or do something better.

Hi Anne!

What I mean is that the special casing of `G2` looks silly.  

```
+         if cartan_type.type() == "G":
+            sh = sum([[i]*c for i, c in dominant_weight], [])
+            sh = Partition(reversed(sh)).conjugate()
+            return CrystalOfTableaux(cartan_type, shape=sh)
+
```
I.e., in all cases but `G2` we use the ambient space to contruct the shape.

Put differently, would you say that the following code is better, worse, or about equally good?

```
    if model == 'Tableaux':
        if cartan_type.type() in ["A", "C", "G"]:
            sh = sum([[i]*c for i,c in dominant_weight], [])
            sh = Partition(reversed(sh)).conjugate()
        elif cartan_type.type() in ["B", "D"]:
            sh = dominant_weight.to_ambient().to_vector()
            from sage.rings.integer_ring import ZZ
            if sh[-1] in ZZ:
                sh = Partition(sh)
        else:
            raise ValueError("invalid model")
        return CrystalOfTableaux(cartan_type, shape=sh)
```

I don't know anything about type `Q`, but the following also doesn't look quite right, does it?

```
sage: ct = CartanType("Q4")
sage: L = ct.root_system().weight_lattice()
sage: La = L.fundamental_weights()
sage: C = crystals.Tableaux(ct, shape=[3,1]); (C.highest_weight_vectors()[0].weight(), C.cardinality())
((3, 1, 0, 0), 80)
sage: C = crystals.HighestWeight(2*La[1]+La[2]); (C.highest_weight_vector().weight(), C.cardinality())
((3, 1, 0, 0), 45)

sage: L

{
    "body": "<a id='comment:8'>Comment 8:</a>\nOne major issue for using the ambient space for G<sub>2</sub> is the realization of the fundamental weights are not naturally partitions like for the other types:\n\n```\nsage: RootSystem('G2').ambient_space().fundamental_weights()\nFinite family {1: (1, 0, -1), 2: (2, -1, -1)}\nsage: RootSystem('D4').ambient_space().fundamental_weights()\nFinite family {1: (1, 0, 0, 0), 2: (1, 1, 0, 0), 3: (1/2, 1/2, 1/2, -1/2), 4: (1/2, 1/2, 1/2, 1/2)}\n```\nHowever, I think your idea of converting to the ambient space is good.

One major issue for using the ambient space for G<sub>2</sub> is the realization of the fundamental weights are not naturally partitions like for the other types:

```
sage: RootSystem('G2').ambient_space().fundamental_weights()
Finite family {1: (1, 0, -1), 2: (2, -1, -1)}
sage: RootSystem('D4').ambient_space().fundamental_weights()
Finite family {1: (1, 0, 0, 0), 2: (1, 1, 0, 0), 3: (1/2, 1/2, 1/2, -1/2), 4: (1/2, 1/2, 1/2, 1/2)}
```
However, I think your idea of converting to the ambient space is good. You also don't need to convert the list to a partition. Thus, the last `if` statement is unnecessary.

The type EF failures are expected as there is no (canonical) tableau realization and should be removed from the ticket description.

Additionally, I think the added doctest should be more tailored to the failure of the ticket, namely the spin representations in type BD.

I think either is fine as long as it is correct! I slightly like it better to use the conversion to the ambient lattice for most types.

Regarding type Q, I do not think the tableaux model was ever implemented for this type, so I think it should not be used!

Best,

I have implemented it:

```
sage: C = crystals.Tableaux(['Q',3], shape=[3,1])

24
```

Dear Anne, Daniel and Travis (I guess that T is a good approximation to E)!

My thought about *not* using the ambient space was that the choice of positive roots is quite arbitrary, and it might be more correct to (at least try to) avoid dependence on a specific choice.  So here is another version of the same code:

```
        n = cartan_type.rank()
        from sage.modules.free_module_element import vector
        from sage.rings.integer_ring import ZZ
        from sage.rings.rational_field import QQ
        d = {i: vector(QQ, [1]*i + [0]*(n-i)) for i in range(1, n+1)}
        if cartan_type.type() == "B":
            d[n] = vector(QQ, [1/2 for i in range(n)])
        elif cartan_type.type() == "D":
            d[n-1] = vector(QQ, [1/2 for i in range(n-1)] + [-1/2])
            d[n] = vector(QQ, [1/2 for i in range(n)])
        sh = sum((c*d[i] for i, c in dominant_weight), vector(QQ, n))
        if sh[-1] in ZZ:
            sh = Partition(sh)
        return CrystalOfTableaux(cartan_type, shape=sh)
```
The call to `Partition` should not be avoided, or probably done in `crystals.Tableaux`, because

```
sage: C1 = crystals.Tableaux("A4", shape=[2,1]); C1
The crystal of tableaux of type ['A', 4] and shape(s) [[2, 1]]
sage: C2 = crystals.Tableaux("A4", shape=[2,1,0,0]); C2
The crystal of tableaux of type ['A', 4] and shape(s) [[2, 1, 0, 0]]
sage: C1 == C2
False
```

Alternatively, here is a code which always relies on the chosen set of positive roots, but in a quirky way:

```
        sh = dominant_weight.to_ambient().to_vector()
        if cartan_type.type() == "G":
            sh = (-sh)[2:0:-1]
        from sage.rings.integer_ring import ZZ
        if cartan_type.type() in ["B", "D"] and sh[-1] not in ZZ:
            return CrystalOfTableaux(cartan_type, shape=sh)

        return CrystalOfTableaux(cartan_type, shape=Partition(sh))
```
Note that moving the call to `Partition` to the individual `crystals.Tableaux` classes would save three more lines, including the import statement.

I assume that it's out of the question to change the choice of positive roots for `G_2`, right?

Concerning the test, I must say that I like to have one (more or less) systematic test.  It would have saved me a day if something like it would have been available.

Yes, it should be avoided *here* in the highest weight crystals code. That is an issue with the `CrystalOfTableaux` code not sufficiently standardizing itself. There is also a strong argument for padding the list to have length `n`.

I also like this option except for the call to `Partition`.

I agree with Anne that definitely not on this ticket.

If you want a systematic test, I would explicitly write something in. My second option would be to use `CartanType.samples(finite=True)`. I don't like depending on something that is essentially downstream.

Now that I am looking at the code and the changes, it seems more like we should standardize the shape to actually be a partition and strip the trailing zeros there. Plus, they are accessible via the `shapes` attribute. Sorry for the back-and-forth on this; the code has spoken.

In answer to [This is the Trac macro *comment:18* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#comment:18-macro), type A is the only exception to the rule, and I agree we should not remove height n columns to make it a **gl**<sub>n</sub> object, which it more naturally is IMO.

Since we are also fixing the input for `CrystalsOfTableaux` here, there is also this one:

```
sage: crystals.Tableaux(['D',4], shape=[-1/2,1/2,1/2,-1/2])
The crystal of tableaux of type ['D', 4] and shape(s) [[-1/2, 1/2, 1/2, -1/2]]
```
I think the check is lacking and the fact we force the spins to all be plus or minus is artificial and can be removed.

It says in the documentation:

   If the type is D_r, the shape is permitted to have a negative value
   in the r-th position. Thus if the shape equals [s_1,...,s_r],
   then s_r may be negative but in any case s_1 >= ... >=
   s_{r-1} >= |s_r|. This crystal is related to that of shape
   [s_1,...,|s_r|] by the outer automorphism of SO(2r).

So negative entries should not be allowed except in the r-th entry.

you are referring to the fact that `[1/2, ..., 1/2, -1/2]` is allowed?

Yes, `[1/2, ..., 1/2, -1/2]` is allowed.

What I mean is you cannot mix `[1/2, ..., 1/2, -1/2]` with `[1/2, ..., 1/2, 1/2]`:

```
sage: crystals.Tableaux(['D',4], [[1/2,1/2,1/2,-1/2],[1/2,1/2,1/2,1/2]])
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)
...
ValueError: in type D spins should all be positive or negative

Everything in the type A root system can be considered up to scalar multiples of the `(1, 1, ..., 1)` vector. So these two can be considered to be the same element because it really lives in a quotient space.

<a id='comment:35'>Comment 35:</a>
Thank you for looking at the code!

One more question: I currently do

```
dominant_weight = dominant_weight.to_ambient().to_weight_space(ZZ)
```
do obtain a weight in the weight lattice.

Maybe it would make sense to add a method `to_weight_space` to `RootSpace`, so we could just say

```
dominant_weight = dominant_weight.to_weight_space()
```
(`WeightSpaceElement` has a method `to_weight_space` which just returns `self`, whereas `dominant_weight.to_ambient().to_weight_space(ZZ)` has to do some real work)
