This was reported to me by Chris Wuthrich in December 2019, and by Barry Mazur and Karl Rubin a few days ago.  I originally thought that there was a bug in eclib, but it turns out that the only bug is that the default value of certain parameters is too small for the cases they were interested in.  I will post a 2-line patch to increase this.  It has to be a 2-line patch, not 1, since the current eclib interfae does not expose the relevant parameter to Sage at all currently.

Here are two example. Wuthrich's (takes a little while as the conductor is 87416):

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve([49,-49])
sage: me = E.modular_symbol(implementation="eclib")
sage: me(1/8)
10/17
sage: mn = E.modular_symbol(implementation="num")
sage: mn(1/8)
1/2
```
and Mazur's:

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve('1590g1')                                                                                                                     
sage: ms = E.modular_symbol()                                                                                                                         
sage: [ms(a/5) for a in [1..4]]                                                                                                                       
[1001/153, -1001/153, -1001/153, 1001/153]
sage: ms = E.modular_symbol(implementation='num')                                                                                                     
sage: [ms(a/5) for a in [1..4]]                                                                                                                       
[13/2, -13/2, -13/2, 13/2]
```

In both cases, after my patch the 'eclib' values agree with the numerical values.

> Is there evidence that 1000 is the right bound for all curves? All for which it makes sense to use eclib. Maybe it should increase with the conductor. Probably 100*sqrt(N) or so is safer.

Good point -- though at the top level E.modular_symbol() used default nap=400 in this patch.  As you know, for large conductor it will take a long time to make this construction, so I rather doubt it will be used much for N>10000 (say), so a default which works on this range seemed reasonable.  On the other hand, compared with the time it takes to construct the modular symbol space, the time to compute more ap from the curve is negligible, suggesting that having a higher default is better.

I will be changing eclib's own default (which is 300 ap) anyway, probably to 1000, and the way the code works is that it sets a minimum value of nap (currently 300) so that  whatever value the user gives is increased to this if less.  (i.e., there is in effect the line nap=max(300,nap) in eclib's relevant function.)

I would be so much happier if it were possible to get this normalising factor another way than by taking rations of periods.  It is *only* needed at all so that we get the right answers for non-optima curves -- when you give it an optimal curve it goes to all this trouble to compute the ratio as 1 (or in the example before the fix it computed it as 73/68 or something), but I know of no way to do that.  It would be possible to change eclib so that it assumes that the curve is optimal by default, only computing the normalisation factors if the users specifically asks.  Then on the Sage side we could decide to use the default if the curve's label ends in '1', or if the isogeny class consists of only one curve.

The current fix is designed to be easily implemented as it requires no change to eclib -- which had no bugs in this regard, except possible the too low default value of 300.

But I will take your suggestion on board with a new patch, and while waiting for the review I'll test it as many curves as I can -- the test being that 'eclib' and 'num' give the same answer for all small rationals.
