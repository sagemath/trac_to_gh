#21783 removes the last productive bit of `sage-location`. The only thing that `sage-location` does now is write a warning if it notices that the tree has moved.

We want to get rid of the whole mechanism completely.... (or reuse its remains to implement #31076). 

In this ticket, we remove a part of it, the "sage-force-relocate" mechanism, which used to be invoked by `sage-spkg`.

We also fix the script so that it works in installations without `SAGE_ROOT`. This is for the benefit of downstream packaging and #30913.

(When we finally get rid of `sage-location`, we can finally close tickets #15146, #17479, #11755.)

This is also preparation of sorts for #31076, which proposes to add a different relocation mechanism.

> - The script's main purpose is to see if Sage has been relocated and then to quit with an error message if so. Do we need to do this? Can we just document that it can't be moved and let it fail however if fails if someone ignores this? That is, can we delete this entirely?


I think there's value in giving a clear error message - removing it could cause more traffic on sage-support
