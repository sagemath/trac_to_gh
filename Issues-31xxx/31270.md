#21783 removes the last productive bit of `sage-location`. The only thing that `sage-location` does now is write a warning if it notices that the tree has moved.

We want to get rid of the whole mechanism completely.... (or reuse its remains to implement #31076). 

In this ticket, we remove a part of it, the "sage-force-relocate" mechanism, which used to be invoked by `sage-spkg`.

We also fix the script so that it works in installations without `SAGE_ROOT`. This is for the benefit of downstream packaging and #30913.

(When we finally get rid of `sage-location`, we can finally close tickets #15146, #17479, #11755.)

This is also preparation of sorts for #31076, which proposes to add a different relocation mechanism.


Depends on #21783

Also: would the check

```
    if OLD_SAGE_ROOT != SAGE_ROOT:
```
be more robust as

```
    if not os.path.samefile(OLD_SAGE_ROOT, SAGE_ROOT):
```
or `SAGE_ROOT = os.pathlib.Path('...')` followed by `SAGE_ROOT.samefile(...)` or something similar? Maybe we have to handle `None` as a special case.

Edit: typo: should be `samefile`, not `samepath`.
