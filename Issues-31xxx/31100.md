I observed a memory leak (tested with Sage 9.1) when evaluating
a multivariate polynomial with coefficients in a finite field,
see the following code:

```
sage: n = 4
sage: F.<h> = GF(2^n)
sage: P.<x, y, z> = PolynomialRing(F)
sage: g = x^5 + y^7 + h*x*y + h**2*x^2*z^5
sage: while True:
....:     v = g(F(1), F(h), F(1))
```

I think there is still a leak of 2MB about every 10K iterations. The leak is smaller (2MB about every 85K iterations) if I use simpler examples for F, P, and g:

```
sage: from time import time 
....: F = GF(2) 
....: P.<x, y> = PolynomialRing(F) 
....: g = x^3 + x^2 
....: count = 0 
....: mem_orig = get_memory_usage() 
....: mem_updated = mem_orig 
....: time_orig = time() 
....: while True: 
....:     v = g(F(1), F(1)) 
....:     count += 1 
....:     mem_now = get_memory_usage() 
....:     if mem_now != mem_updated: 
....:         mem_updated = mem_now 
....:         time_now = time() 
....:         print(f"memory lost = {mem_now - mem_orig}MB after {count} iterations in {round(
....: time_now - time_orig, 1)} seconds")                                                     
memory lost = 2.0MB after 72135 iterations in 84.3 seconds
memory lost = 4.0MB after 158151 iterations in 179.4 seconds
memory lost = 6.0MB after 244167 iterations in 370.0 seconds
memory lost = 8.0MB after 330183 iterations in 585.5 seconds
etc.
```
This is with 9.3.beta5 on MacOS, but results are similar (except the timings are faster) on `CoCalc` with 9.1 and 9.2.

This is not just limited to finite fields. It also happens over `F = QQ`. It also happens in both of these cases:

```
        if res == NULL:
            return res_parent(0)
        if p_LmIsConstant(res, _ring):
            sage_res = si2sa( p_GetCoeff(res, _ring), _ring, parent._base )
            p_Delete(&res, _ring)            # sage_res contains copy
```
My guess is it is somewhere within the `singular_polynomial_call` function.

Addendum: #16958 might be relevant.

I have confirmed that the leak is coming from in there. In fact, I believe I have further isolated it to the line

```
cdef ideal *res_id = fast_map_common_subexp(from_id, r, to_id, r)
```
This is a singular function, so it makes me believe there is a bug in Singular. At least, I cannot find any other place where it could be leaking, but it is possible I missed something. I am stumped at this point. `:/`
