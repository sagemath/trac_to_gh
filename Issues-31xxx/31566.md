Yes, you should be checking R to save an extra call of .base-ring()

You also need to add at least one example.

Merge conflict on the latest release.

Also, the example should include a t, so that the map is properly defined over the function field.

The latest release also throws an unnecessary ValueError when minimal=False over function fields. This can be fixed in this ticket or a separate ticket.
