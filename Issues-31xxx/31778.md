*Mathics* is an open source interpreter for the *Wolfram Language*. From the introduction of its reference manual:

    Mathics — to be pronounced like “Mathematics” without the
    “emat” — is a general-purpose computer algebra system (CAS).
    It is meant to be a free, light-weight alternative to
Mathematica®. It is free both as in “free beer” and as in
“freedom”. There are various online mirrors running
    Mathics but it is also possible to run Mathics locally.
    A list of mirrors can be found at the Mathics homepage,
    http://mathics.github.io.

    The programming language of Mathics is meant to resemble
    Wolfram’s famous Mathematica® as much as possible. However,
    Mathics is in no way affiliated or supported by Wolfram.
    Mathics will probably never have the power to compete with
    Mathematica® in industrial applications; yet, it might be
    an interesting alternative for educational purposes.

The aim of this ticket is to implement an interface to Mathics.
Such an interface has the advantage that functions written in
Wolfram Language can be used in Sage on systems that miss a
Mathematica® licence.

Moreover, there are many classical software packages written in
Wolfram Language that eventually could be used inside Sage
in order to participate from their functionality. Currently,
for example, Mathics developers are working to get
[KnotTheory](http://katlas.math.toronto.edu/wiki/Setup)
and [FeynCalc](https://feyncalc.github.io/) running.


To install Mathics inside Sage just run:

```bash
./configure --enable-download-from-upstream-url
make mathics
```


Thanks to the developers of Mathics to support this interface!

The initial version for the interface is an adaption of the corresponding interface for Mathematica. But in contrast it directly uses the Mathics library functionality instead of Pexpect. It contains all doctests inherited from the Mathematica module but also additional ones which are more Mathics specific. Furthermore, the coverage of doctests is complete.

Two of the Mathematica doctests use `FindMinimum` which doesn't seem to be available in Mathics. I mark them as `not tested`. 25 doctests had differences to the output that once has been produced by Mathematica. Most of them are caused by a different way of formatting. I've accepted them all, since they where either minor or a task for Mathics developers to decide if they are acceptable or not (see also [this comment ](https://github.com/mathics/Mathics/issues/1235#issuecomment-814899766) in [Mathics issue 1235](https://github.com/mathics/Mathics/issues/1235)). Explicitly these are:

Observe that the graphical support of Mathics is restricted to `SVG`. For the usage in Sage it would be preferable to have `PNG` possible, as well, or to convert it here to `PNG` (for example using `svg2rlg` introducing a new dependency to `svglib`).




Sage package integration is initialized using:

```
sage -package create Mathics3 --pypi --type optional
```

I rename the created package `Mathics3` to `mathics` to match Sage package naming conventions.

The problem with the order of terms and factors is that usually the evaluation of algebraic expressions is delegated to sympy, so we cannot from Mathics warrant a specific order. A way to make tests compatible with both backends (WMA and Mathics) could be to write tests that check that a difference between two equivalent expressions is zero. 

Regarding format, it is possible to use an init file/ set of commands to overwrite the standard behavior of MakeBoxes over `Times` or `Power`. 

About images, notice that to produce png`s, you can load one of the optional backend modules:
pymathics-matplotlib or pymathics-asymptote. To load the modules, you need to install one of the following libraries:

https://github.com/mathics3/pymathics-matplotlib 
https://github.com/mathics3/pymathics-asymptote

and then run inside Mathics either `LoadModule["pymathics-matplotlib"]` or
`LoadModule["pymathics-asymptote"]`. 
Both are work in progress, but produces pngs for basic plots and graphics.

This is related to something I noticed a while ago and have been meaning to fix. I thought I recorded it as an issue and I think I had a local branch for it, but I can't find the issue or branch. The closest I can find is https://github.com/mathics/Mathics/issues/1098 from Jan 3, 2021 and I have just renamed the title to make it more in line with what I have in mind.

We *should* be canonicalize output along the lines of standard formatting conventions and practice: if I have an expression in a variable, in `StandardOutput` format the higher powers of the variable come first in order and any constant comes last. It gets a little more complicated when there are combinations of variables. 

Interestingly, on parsing we *do* canonicalize the input seen, *and it is in the opposite order*!  But this is the way WL does it too.


However WL seems to canonicalize its `StandardOutput` too so you don't notice the reversal between what is *parsed* in input (as opposed to written by the user) and what is formatted on output. 

Were this done, we would have both more natural looking, predicatble, and more WL-compatible output.

If it will help simplify things, (and personally I think it will), we can put out another release shortly. I generally would like to do so roughly every month that there are significant changes and I think in the last month there have been. 

It is better to have many smaller releases as opposed to larger releases over a longer periods of time, especially as we are in a period of great flux and we are making great strides towards reducing the overall flakiness.

I see! But, I think we can postpone the `PNG` availability to a follow up ticket. This is not essential to start with the interface. At least, if you convert to Sage objects you can do plotting there.

Thanks! These problems are solved. But on sytsems where `lxml` is not present I'm getting a startup message `lxml.html is not available...`, now, which distrubes the first doctest:


```sage
File "src/sage/interfaces/mathics.py", line 37, in sage.interfaces.mathics
Failed example:
    mobj = mathics(x^2-1); mobj       # optional - mathics
Expected:
    -1 + x ^ 2
Got:
    lxml.html is not available...
    -1 + x ^ 2
**********************************************************************
1 item had failures:
   1 of  87 in sage.interfaces.mathics
    [222 tests, 1 failure, 9.45 s]
```


Is this something essential? If not: is there a way to supress this message in `MathicsSession`? Or, is there a missing dependency?

This dependency was newly added to the last release when an HTML import feature was added. 

It shouldn't be necessary. Perhaps down the line, loading various types of files will moved to packages outside of the Mathics core. 

When https://github.com/mathics/Mathics/pull/1379 lands, it should address this by making the `lxml` package optional. And next release we may have a `FindMinimum` as well.

For now though, I don't know what to suggest. Sigh.

Also, after this gets into sage, we should figure out how to incorporate sage testing into a broader set of tests we do. (We need this for other packages as well.)

Thats fine!

> install lxml in sage ...


If `lxml` is optional in Mathics then it doesn't make sense to do anything in Sage (especially outside this interface) just to avoid this message. If a Sage user wants to use the optional functionality of Mathics via the interface then he can install it manually by `sage -pip install lxml`.

> If sage already has something for parsing HTML, then maybe we can use that in the next release of Mathics.



AFAIK, html parsers that can be used per default in Sage are those of the following libraries:

```sage
sage: import html
sage: import html5lib
```

The commits above contain an update to the current release of Mathics3 introducing two new dependencies to `pint` and `palettable`. Still, the Mathematica function `FindMinimum` is not present in this version. But anyway, I think this is not necessary for a start with the interface. Thus, I marked the corresponding doctests to be ignored.

I've started a [workflow](https://github.com/soehms/sage/actions/runs/1203951924) which is identical to `tox-optional.yml` except that the matrix for the optional packages is reduced to `mathics`.

It seems that there are no failures which are related to the new package except on debian buster one failing doctest on `mathics.py`. This was caused by the missing dependency to `importlib_metadata` which is needed for Sage on Python 3.7 and which is added in the current commit. Rerunning the [debian buster test](https://github.com/soehms/sage/actions/runs/1207317942) looks good now, as well.

Therefore, I think the ticket is ready for review, right now!
