We rewrite the input data for `LazyLaurentSeries` to use a `Stream` that has both a dense version similar to a `lazy_list` and a sparse version using a `dict`. We use various subclasses to build an evaluation tree for expressions involving lazy Laurent series elements.

We provide additional features not previously implemented for lazy Laurent series, such as functional definitions and composition. This provides enhancements for features such as exact arithmetic, equality, and performance. This is supplemented by an extensive suite of tests and examples.

This ticket is part of the meta ticket #31651. It provides the underlying data structures for lazy series, which later tickets include lazy, e.g., Taylor (usual power series) and Dirichlet series. This will eventually serve as a replacement for `LazyPowerSeries` (#32367; see also #15673).

We use various subclasses to build an evaluation tree for expressions involving lazy Laurent series elements.\n \n-This ticket is part of the meta ticket #31651\n+We provide additional features not previously implemented for lazy Laurent series, such as functional definitions and composition. This provides enhancements for features such as exact arithmetic, equality, and performance. This is supplemented by an extensive suite of tests and examples.\n+\n+This ticket is part of the meta ticket #31651. It provides the underlying data structures for lazy series, which later tickets include lazy, e.g., Taylor (usual power series) and Dirichlet series. This will eventually serve as a replacement for `LazyPowerSeries` (#32367; see also #15673).\n``````\n",

-A dense implementation of the Lazy Laurent Series using Lazy Lists.
+We rewrite the input data for `LazyLaurentSeries` to use a `CoefficientStream` that has both a dense version similar to a `lazy_list` and a sparse version using a `dict`. We use various subclasses to build an evaluation tree for expressions involving lazy Laurent series elements.
 
-This ticket is part of the meta ticket #31651
+We provide additional features not previously implemented for lazy Laurent series, such as functional definitions and composition. This provides enhancements for features such as exact arithmetic, equality, and performance. This is supplemented by an extensive suite of tests and examples.
+
+This ticket is part of the meta ticket #31651. It provides the underlying data structures for lazy series, which later tickets include lazy, e.g., Taylor (usual power series) and Dirichlet series. This will eventually serve as a replacement for `LazyPowerSeries` (#32367; see also #15673).

<a id='comment:6'></a>Sorry to jump in with some naive questions and comments,
feel free to ignore. Or to set back to positive review
and to open a follow-up ticket instead.

These class names mix camel case and underscores:

```
CoefficientStream_add
CoefficientStream_cauchy_product
CoefficientStream_sub
CoefficientStream_composition
CoefficientStream_lmul
CoefficientStream_rmul
CoefficientStream_neg
CoefficientStream_cauchy_inverse
CoefficientStream_map_coefficients
CoefficientStream_zero
CoefficientStream_exact
CoefficientStream_uninitialized
CoefficientStream_shift
```
Is that usual? Naively I would have expected:

```
CoefficientStreamAdd
CoefficientStreamCauchyProduct
CoefficientStreamSub
CoefficientStreamComposition
CoefficientStreamLmul
CoefficientStreamRmul
CoefficientStreamNeg
CoefficientStreamCauchyInverse
CoefficientStreamMapCoefficients
CoefficientStreamZero
CoefficientStreamExact
CoefficientStreamUninitialized
CoefficientStreamShift
```

I'm sure it's just my ignorance and you'll point me
to other examples.

Could names be shortened by using Stream
instead of CoefficientStream?

Change which L is capitalised:

```diff
-The coefficient stream can be used to build up a Lazy laurent series::
+The coefficient stream can be used to build up a lazy Laurent series::
```

Unclear syntax:

```
Two coefficient streams can be composed (depending on whether it exists)::
```

Typo:

```diff
         The default is to always return ``False`` as it
-        cannot be decided or they are equal.
+        cannot be decided whether they are equal.
```

In comments, use sentences with initial capital
and final period, and regular indentation
(with additional minor rephrasing suggestions).

```diff
             # We cannot pickle a generator object, so we remove it and
-            #   the cache from the pickle information.
+            # the cache from the pickle information.
```

```diff
         # We do not insist that the last entry of initial_coefficients
-        #   is different from constant in case comparisons can be
-        #   expensive such as in the symbolic ring
+        # is different from constant in case comparisons can be
+        # expensive such as in the symbolic ring.
```

```diff
-            # the constant part makes no contribution to the negative
-            # we need this for the case so self._neg_powers[0][n] => 0
+            # The constant part makes no contribution to the negative.
+            # We need this for the case so self._neg_powers[0][n] => 0.
```

```diff
-        v = self._approximate_order  # shorthand name
+        v = self._approximate_order  # shorthand name for this "order" or "valuation"
-        n = 0  # Counts the number of places from the order
+        n = 0  # shift from the "order" position
         yield self._ainv
+        # Note that first entry of the cache will correspond to z^v
+        # The first entry of the cache is the coefficient of z^v
```

```diff
-        # We don't hash the function in case that happens to not be hashable
+        # We don't hash the function as it might not be hashable.
```

In examples blocks, end introductory sentences with `::` or `. ::`
but not `.::` (as I think that would render as ".:" -- please check).

```diff
-generating functions for sequences arising in combinatorics.::
+generating functions for sequences arising in combinatorics.::
```

```diff
-that are needed are computed.::
+that are needed are computed. ::
```

```diff
-coefficient are computed.::
+coefficient are computed. ::
```

Typos.

```diff
-    Two sequences can be subracted::
+    Two sequences can be subtracted::
```

```diff
-explcitly
+explicitly
```

Incorrect capitalisation (several occurrences):

```diff
-        Dense Implementation::
+        Dense implementation::
```

```diff
-        Sparse Implementation::
+        Sparse implementation::
```

Capitalise Laurent and end with period:

```diff
-                # One of the lazy laurent series is not known to eventually be constant
+                # One of the lazy Laurent series is not known to eventually be constant.
```

Rephrase:

```diff
-        # the product is exact if and only if both of the factors are
-        # exact, and one has eventually 0 coefficients:
+        # The product is exact if and only if both factors are exact
+        # and one of the factors has eventually 0 coefficients:
         #   (p + a x^d/(1-x))(q + b x^e/(1-x))
         #   = p q + (a x^d q + b x^e p)/(1-x) + a b x^(d+e)/(1-x)^2
```

Rephrase and fix typo in "coeffcients"

```
-            # (a x^d q)/(1-x) has constant a q(1), and the initial
-            # values are the cumulative sums of the coeffcients of q
+            # The series `(a * x^d * q) / (1 - x)` has constant term
+            # `a * q(1)`, and initial values the cumulative sums
+            # of the coefficients of `q`.
```

In several docstrings, "if" should be "whether", e.g.

```diff
+        Return if ``self`` is sparse or not.
+        Return whether ``self`` is sparse.
```

Note you can check which files were touched by this ticket with

```

```

and then run tox on these files
(except `src/sage/rings/lazy_laurent_series_operator.py`
which was removed):

```

```

which runs tests and some sanity checks
including pycodestyle which detects
invalid escape sequences, and codespell 
which detects some typos.

In particular codespell makes these suggestions,
some silly, some useful:

Comments on your changes:

In the test `L(0).map_coefficients(lambda c: c + 1)`, we should actually check the resulting stream is `Stream_zero`.

We should also better handle `truncate` and `__pow__` (with the special `0^0` returning `1`).

It is a test, and it would make it clear what behavior we expect.

> and, more importantly, `Stream_exact` would actually raise an error (at least it should).  So, in fact an output `0` (without the `O(z^7)`) is a promise that the stream is zero.


It is possible we optimize out some of the checks for `Stream_exact` that ends up allowing this to sneak through. So it makes the test more robust.

> `__pow__` actually does the right thing: if `self` is 0, then it calls `generic_power`, which calls `_mul_`, which returns `0`.  I will add a test, however.


I agree that it does the right thing, but we can certainly optimize it.

I'm not quite sure we should really insist in the doctests on a difference between `Stream_exact` and `Stream_zero`.  It looks like an implementation detail to me.  I think that from the user's perspective, there should be absolutely no difference in behaviour between the two - in contrast to any `Stream_inexact`.

In case you do not agree, did you have a test as follows in mind:

```
            sage: from sage.data_structures.stream import Stream_zero
            sage: L.<z> = LazyLaurentSeriesRing(ZZ)
            sage: s = L(0).map_coefficients(lambda c: c + 1); s
            0
            sage: isinstance(s._coeff_stream, Stream_zero)
            True
```

Running that argument further, `Stream_exact` and `Stream_inexact` could be seen as an implementation detail. All the user sees is the element of the lazy Laurent series. It is the developers that see more (as they need to).

Here we are actually wanting to test something about the implementation. Plus `Stream_zero` is a very special object because it is the only thing that will have a non-integer (approximate) order.

I don't think we should test `foo(L(0)) is L.zero()` as we cannot (nor should) presume there is a unique `zero` instance. Although this would be highly desirable.

Yes, that would be the test I would want to run here.

I have done the requested change.  The remainder of this comment is only for our personal enjoyment:

I think that there is quite a fundamental - and in fact user-visible - difference between `Stream_exact` and `Stream_inexact`.  It is user visible, since the big-O term is missing from the output.  It is fundamental, because we can decide equality.

I agree with your argument that `Stream_zero` is a very special object because of its infinite order.

I think we should change the order of the optional arguments.  Currently, we have:

```
    def _element_constructor_(self, x=None, valuation=None, constant=None, degree=None):
```
I think

```
    def _element_constructor_(self, x=None, valuation=None, degree=None, constant=None):
```
would be more logical.  As I mentioned on #32309, we should also give the user the possibility to be explicit whether the argument is supposed to be interpreted as a polynomial or a function that yields the coefficients.  It appears to me, that the least disruptive way is

```
    def _element_constructor_(self, x=None, valuation=None, degree=None, constant=None, coefficients=None):
```

Note that the original code does only allows a single value as argument to the element constructor, which then returns a constant series.

    def series(self, coefficient, valuation, constant=None, degree=None):
```
which is confusing.

Should we make it 

```
    def series(self, coefficient, valuation, degree=None, constant=None):
```
and allow `degree` to be a pair `(constant, degree)` or

```
    def series(self, coefficient, valuation, constant=None):
```
?

(perhaps it would be better to deprecate this method anyway)

We still don't have a good replacement for what the `series` method does. However, I agree with changing the signature and allowing the pair input. I also did the same if someone does `constant=(a,b)`.

I thought a bit more about the `coefficients` attributes for the `_element_constructor_`. I think you're right that there is not really a better solution. I implemented something that is more minimal of a change to avoid duplication and to minimize the impact. Although on this ticket, it is likely not necessary as we cannot (easily) demonstrate a case where we must use the option.

I also added the checks for `valuation in ZZ`.
