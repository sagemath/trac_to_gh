Currently, the sigma invariants method for dynamical systems on projective space is not implemented when the projective space has dimension greater than 1. Using the algorithm described in [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.03184.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.03184.pdf), this ticket implements that functionality.

<a id='comment:9'></a>I pushed a branch with a few comments in the main algorithm. Feel free to add some more.


Here are the issues I've found:

- I don't think putting the degrees as the first two coordinates is appropriate since unless you understand the full form of the sigma invariant polynomials it's not that helpful. If you do know the full form, then then information is not needed.

- need examples for
  - formal=True
  - finite fields
  - polynomial rings

- cycle is ignored for dimension > 1, but seems like a not implemented error should be thrown instead of simply ignoring the parameter. Also, should mention in the INPUT documentation that it is only for dim=1.

- You need to fix the signs as you pull off the coefficients in

```
sigmas.append(sigma_dictionary.pop(w**i*t**j, 0))
```

- Formal doesn't seem to work as these both give the same result

```
P.<x,y,z>=ProjectiveSpace(QQ,2)
f=DynamicalSystem([x^2-z^2,y^2,z^2])
f.sigma_invariants(2,return_polynomial=True,formal = False)
f.sigma_invariants(2,return_polynomial=True,formal = True)
```

- random error

```
P.<x,y,z>=ProjectiveSpace(QQbar,2)
f=DynamicalSystem([x^2-z^2,y^2,z^2])
f.sigma_invariants(2,return_polynomial=True,formal = False)
```

- shouldn't these work?

```
R.<c>=QQ[]
P.<x,y>=ProjectiveSpace(R,1)
f=DynamicalSystem([x^2+c*y^2,y^2])
f.sigma_invariants(1,return_polynomial=True)

R.<c,d>=QQ[]
P.<x,y,z>=ProjectiveSpace(R,2)
f=DynamicalSystem([x^2+c*z^2,y^2+d*z^2,z^2])
f.sigma_invariants(1,return_polynomial=True)

R.<c,d>=QQ[]
P.<x,y,z>=ProjectiveSpace(FractionField(R),2)
f=DynamicalSystem([x^2+c*z^2,y^2+d*z^2,z^2])
f.sigma_invariants(1,return_polynomial=True)
```

- This is wrong

```
P.<x,y>=ProjectiveSpace(QQ,1)
f=DynamicalSystem([x^2+3*y^2,x*y])
f.sigma_invariants(1,return_polynomial=True, chow=True)
```

<a id='comment:11'></a>Pushed a change fixing the random QQbar issue, and fixing the signs.

I also added flattening and unflattening for the families with a parameter - those should work now.

There does seem to be a big bug in the code. This one is correct:

```
R.<c>=QQ[]
P.<x,y>=ProjectiveSpace(R,1)
f=DynamicalSystem([x^2+c*y^2,y^2])
f.sigma_invariants(1,return_polynomial=True,chow=True)
w^3 + (-3)*w^2*t + 2*w^2 + 3*w*t^2 + (-4)*w*t + 4*c*w - t^3 + 2*t^2 + (-4*c)*t
```

But this fails:

```
R.<c>=QQ[]
P.<x,y>=ProjectiveSpace(FractionField(R),1)
f=DynamicalSystem([x^2+c*y^2,y^2])
f.sigma_invariants(1,return_polynomial=True, chow=True)
w - t
```
Not sure what is going on there.

As for putting the degrees in the first two coordinates, I did that so that the full form of the polynomial could be specified. I think the two degrees plus the list of coefficients with 0's is enough to fully specify the polynomial, so that doing a check of

```
f.sigma_invariants(1) == g.sigma_invariants(1)
```
actually tells us if f and g are not conjugate.

P.<x,y>=ProjectiveSpace(QQ,1)
f=DynamicalSystem([x^2+3*y^2,x*y])
f.sigma_invariants(1,return_polynomial=True, chow=True)
```

This map has a fixed point at infinity with multiplicity 3, which we try to account for in the second affine chart. However, it only shows up with multiplicity 1 in that affine chart. Not sure how to fix that.

<a id='comment:14'></a>I think this needs to be deformed as was done in the formal periodic points.

I see four cases

- all periodic points and multipliers are distinct (typical case): runs as normal
- all periodic points distinct, but multipliers not all distinct: chow method works
- periodic points not all distinct, all other multipliers distinct: deform and use normal method
- periodic points not all distinct and multipliers not all distinct: deform + chow method
