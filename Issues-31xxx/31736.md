CC:  @egourgoulhon @mjungmath @tscrim

Two subsets are equal if they are subsets of each other.

We add methods `equal_subsets`, `equal_subset_family`; and a method `declare_equal` to make two or more subsets equal.

We modify the method `subset_poset` and `superset_poset` to quotient out by equality.
