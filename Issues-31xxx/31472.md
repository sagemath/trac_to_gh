```
Two functions can be added:
* `inverse_series_trunc`, similarly to what exists for polynomials: it returns a polynomial approximation at the given precision of the inverse series of this polynomial matrix (algorithm: Newton iteration; requirement: constant coefficient is a unit)
* truncated expansion of linear system solution.
For the latter, it should be decided whereas to support only the case where the constant coefficient is a unit (easier to handle), or more generally any nonsingular input matrix.

The truncated inverse method is complete (code, doc, tests) and ready for review. I add here that in the current state of sage and without considering the time for format conversions:
* this method is much faster than the same operation done via polynomials with matrix coefficients when the degrees are "large" and matrix dimensions are "small";
* this method is much slower than the same operation done via polynomials with matrix coefficients when the degrees are "small" and matrix dimensions are "large".

This is simply explained: with the current implementations, the "matrix of polynomials" format benefits from fast polynomial multiplication but relies on naive matrix multiplication, whereas the "polynomial with matrix coefficients" format benefits from fast linear algebra but relies on naive polynomial multiplication. **In short, sage currently lacks a fast polynomial matrix multiplication combining fast polynomial multiplication and fast matrix multiplication**, at least when working over fields where such things are not too tricky to do. But the best approach should be to incorporate this from [LinBox](https://github.com/linbox-team/linbox), [NTL/PML](https://github.com/vneiger/pml), or other efficient libraries which already implement this.

**Examples:**

```
sage: mpR.<X> = MatrixSpace(GF(9001),3,3)[]
sage: C = mpR.random_element(degree=1000)
sage: %time inv_trunc = C.inverse_series_trunc(1001)
Wall time: 1.39 s
sage: %time inv_trunc = C.inverse_series_trunc(10000)
Wall time: 31.4 s

sage: pR.<x> = GF(9001)[]
sage: M = Matrix.random(pR,3,3,degree=1000)
sage: %time inv_trunc = M.inverse_series_trunc(1001)
Wall time: 8.21 ms
sage: %time inv_trunc = M.inverse_series_trunc(1000000)
CPU times: user 5.9 s, sys: 80 ms, total: 5.98 s
Wall time: 5.98 s

sage: mpR.<X> = MatrixSpace(GF(9001),200,200)[]
sage: C = mpR.random_element(degree=10)
sage: %time inv_trunc = C.inverse_series_trunc(11)
Wall time: 271 ms
sage: M = Matrix.random(pR,200,200,degree=10)
sage: %time inv_trunc = M.inverse_series_trunc(11)
Wall time: 30.3 s
```

Great start, but a few comments:

1) Can this be used for solving (solve_left and solve_right) at full precision? Even if we don't do anything clever, we should give a function that computes the correct precision and calls the truncated algorithm.

2) If we are sticking with Sage's functionality for solve_left and solve_right, then we should provide support for nonsingular and non-square matrices.

3) Can the truncated inverse be used to compute the inverse at full precision?

First experiments: `solve_left`, in the case of a **square nonsingular matrix**.

In that case, the standard approach to do `solve_left` is to do the `solve_left_series_trunc` version at precision twice the degree times the dimension (`2*m*d` in the code below), and then reconstruct the fractions via fast GCD. This seems to be **substantially faster than the existing `solve_left`** for all parameters I tried (note that below I am not timing the GCD step, but that must be negligible compared to the matrix operations).

Now some timings for `inverse`, in the case of a **square matrix with invertible constant term**.

Again, compared against the existing `inverse`, there is a **clear advantage of using the new `inverse_series_trunc`** (Newton iteration) at precision twice the dimension times the degree, and then reconstructing the inverse entries by fast GCD.

Now, to conclude, **my suggestion is to open two new tickets for improving system solve and inversion using these new functionalities**.

Indeed the above experiments show good potential, but this is only tested on a small set of parameters, and in the favorable case of square matrices with invertible constant term.
- System solve (i.e. `solve_left` and `solve_right`) can be applied much more generally, such as to rank-deficient and rectangular matrices. It should be investigated whether the approximant basis approach used in `solve_left_series_trunc` for these general cases is still interesting versus the existing `solve_left`. Another (directly related) approach for the general case, to be investigated as well, is to apply the minimal kernel basis method.
- Inversion (i.e. `inverse`) can be applied to nonsingular matrices that do not have invertible constant term, which `inverse_series_trunc` cannot do. Also, we should investigate more general inversion methods such as those based on a partial diagonalization procedure (Zhou & Labahn & Storjohann 2015).
- In all cases, more extensive benchmarking should be made to make sure that there is no loss of performance for some families of parameters.

This is too much work and changes not directly in the scope of this ticket.

Please let me know if you have comments about these comments (before I create these tickets), and also about potential other things to improve on the core of this ticket.
