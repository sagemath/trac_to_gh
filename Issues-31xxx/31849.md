Motivation : this ask.sagemath [question](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/57235/are-these-integrate-interface-issues-with-fricas-known/).

Contemplate :

```
sage: var('x d b c a D C A B')
(x, d, b, c, a, D, C, A, B)
sage: foo = (b*x + a)^2*(D*x^3 + C*x^2 + B*x + A)/(d*x + c)
sage: integrate(foo, x, algorithm="fricas")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
```    
Bandwidth savings : Snip...

```
TypeError: unsupported operand parent(s) for *: 'Integer Ring' and '<class 'function'>'
```
But :

```
sage: var("capitalD")
capitalD
sage: integrate(foo.subs({D:capitalD}), x, algorithm="fricas").subs({capitalD:D})
1/60*(12*D*b^2*d^5*x^5 - 15*(D*b^2*c*d^4 - (2*D*a*b + C*b^2)*d^5)*x^4 + 20*(D*b^2*c^2*d^3 + (D*a^2 + 2*C*a*b + B*b^2)*d^5 - (2*D*a*b*c + C*b^2*c)*d^4)*x^3 - 30*(D*b^2*c^3*d^2 - (C*a^2 + 2*B*a*b + A*b^2)*d^5 + (D*a^2*c + (2*C*a*b + B*b^2)*c)*d^4 - (2*D*a*b*c^2 + C*b^2*c^2)*d^3)*x^2 + 60*(D*b^2*c^4*d - (C*a^2 + 2*B*a*b + A*b^2)*c*d^4 + (B*a^2 + 2*A*a*b)*d^5 + (D*a^2*c^2 + (2*C*a*b + B*b^2)*c^2)*d^3 - (2*D*a*b*c^3 + C*b^2*c^3)*d^2)*x - 60*(D*b^2*c^5 - A*a^2*d^5 - (C*a^2 + 2*B*a*b + A*b^2)*c^2*d^3 + (B*a^2 + 2*A*a*b)*c*d^4 + (D*a^2*c^3 + (2*C*a*b + B*b^2)*c^3)*d^2 - (2*D*a*b*c^4 + C*b^2*c^4)*d)*log(d*x + c))/d^6
```
The cherry on the pie :

```
sage: bool(integrate(foo.subs({D:capitalD}), x, algorithm="fricas").diff(x).subs({capitalD:D})==foo)
True
```

The use of the variable `D` shadows the Fricas function `D`, which is //not// a problem for Fricas, but is not known to the `fricas._sage_()` method, which uses hardcoded equivalences for categorizing syntactic trees' atoms.

In line -4, we check whether `e` is in the symbol table, because it might be a constant like `%pi` or `%i` or `infinity`.  I guess the easiest way out is to check for these explicitely.  I am not sure whether we should remove constants from the symbol table entirely, but it may be less confusing to do so.

I don't immediately know what would cause that circular import. Of course, the ideal thing would be to remove the circular import, but if that is not feasible, your solution of doing something in the `__init__` is much better than doing this in something that is repeatedly called.

Are you going to do that on this ticket or a separate one?
