Hello all,

I am using the following release: 
`SageMath version 9.1, Release Date: 2020-05-20`
over the following platform:
`Linux user 5.4.0-67-generic #75-Ubuntu SMP Fri Feb 19 18:03:38 UTC 2021 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux`

When I try to use the **Brial** package, I receive a Deprecating Warning as follows:

`sage-9-1/SageMath/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/brial/gbrefs.py:9: DeprecationWarning: the imp module is deprecated in favour of importlib; see the module's documentation for alternative uses`

To solve this issue, I merely revised the line 9 of `sage-9-1/SageMath/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/brial/gbrefs.py` as follows:

`import imp` --> `import importlib as imp`

Component: **packages: standard**

Keywords: **BRiAL, PyPolyBoRi**
