The circle S1 with polar coordinates doesn't specify an orientation at the moment. It is also not possible to call `set_orientation` with the polar chart as argument, since this throws an error that the chart doesn't cover the whole manifold.

So I guess to fix this one would need to introduce a set of polar coordinates to get a bona-fide atlas.

Indeed, by default `S1` is endowed with a single chart and without any orientation:

```
sage: S1 = manifolds.Sphere(1) 
sage: S1.atlas()                                                                                    
[Chart (A, (phi,))]
sage: S1.orientation()                                                                              
[]
```
I think this is bad; the minimal atlas shall contain enough charts to cover the entire manifold. There is the same issue with all the spheres. 
One has to invoke stereographic coordinates to get some orientation:

```
sage: S1.stereographic_coordinates()                                                                
Chart (S^1-{NP}, (y1,))
sage: S1.atlas()                                                                                    
[Chart (A, (phi,)),

This is on purpose! The orientation must cover the entire manifold, otherwise a non-orientable manifold could mistakenly seen as orientable. Take for example the Moebius strip.

Polar coordinates do *not* yield an atlas for S^1, there is a slit missing.

So, this behavior is perfectly fine.

If you want to use polar coordinates for orientation stuff, you must restrict everything to the open subset `A`, i.e. `S^n` without a slit.

Strictly speaking, it suffices to specify the orientation (i.e. a norm-one vector field) only on a dense subspace. But I guess it's probably impossible to check if a subset is dense in sage.

> Polar coordinates do *not* yield an atlas for S^1, there is a slit missing.

That's a bit the problem. With the current default atlas, S^1 is diffeomorphic to R, which of course it not correct (or in other words, what is currently returned by S1.atlas is not an atlas of S^1). I cannot say much about the implementation/performance issues, but isn't the transition map to the other polar chart not just a translation by pi?.

The (open) Moebius strip is a counter-example. When you cut the Moebius strip, the cut has measure zero, but the remainder is orientable.

That's not true. The polar coordinates are defined only on `A`, which is a real subset of `S^1`. `A` is diffeomorphic to `R`, `S^1` is still not.

That's only a counterexample to the (wrong) statement that a manifold is orientable iff if it is orientable on dense subset. However, to specify an orientation it is enough to give a unit-norm vector field on a dense subset (such that the vector field extends continuously to the whole manifold).

For the records, 'large' already means n ≥ 4. I think, the initialization should run fast enough at least for n≤7.

The current implementation is, imho, a good compromise between performance and accuracy. Like I said, the topological data is not lost and can easily be retrieved. Besides,

```
sage: S1 = manifolds.Sphere(1, coordinates='stereographic')
```

initializes the sphere with stereographic coordinates and has therefore the same effect as your suggestion.

I don't see a need for a change here; apart from making stereographic coordinates the standard set of charts, but due to performance issues I'd not recommend it.

By the way, the intention is not to get the charts by using the atlas but rather calling `stereographic_coordinates()` etc, which then constructs the charts (and orientation!) on demand.

Travis, what do you think?

> Yes, we cannot make an exception for `S^1` because this requires a complete refactoring of the current orientation code. However, I wouldn't recommend it since orientations must always cover the whole manifold.

I don't think that is an argument because we can cover S<sup>1</sup> by a single chart with the current implementation, the *periodic* chart [0, 1). The tricky bit is this is not a chart in the mathematical sense (as far as I am aware), but it is still a single chart here.

> Alternatively, one could define the domain of the periodic chart being the whole `S^1`, but that is just mathematically wrong. It would suggest that `S^1` could be covered by one chart, which is extremely wrong. And since Sage is also used as teaching tool, I would strongly advice against it.

As we both seem to agree, this is a problem with the implementation differing from the mathematics. So we need to rectify the two. Implicitly, I believe we are thinking the periodic chart is 2 charts pieced together in a natural way with an implicit orientation. So it would make sense IMO to use that single periodic chart to define the orientation. Otherwise you will need to strip out the abuse, which will make doing research with the code harder and not worth it.

S<sup>1</sup> is also special as you don't have to miss 2 points with the polar coordinates, unless you want a disconnected manifold. Because of its special topology compared to higher dimensional spheres, there is plenty of justification for making it behave differently, even if that means returning the stereographic coordinates as the default.

I'm bit out of the loop, but where is the problem in specifying a correct atlas using two charts in spherical coordinates? So for `S^1`, on the first chart `\phi \in (0, 2 \pi)` and on the second chart `\phi \in (-\pi, \pi)`. This is a proper atlas whose transition function is adding pi. That would be mathematically correct and also easy to implement.
