```
When installing [SageMath](../wiki/SageMath) the startmenu entries and desktop shorts aren't created for all users (as chosen) but only for the admin.
(Windows 7)

EDIT:
Moreover: the dialog, if to generate the short cuts for
only this or all users pops up only when you start the
installation by right-click/ "open as admin".
BEING the admin and just starting the installation
does the dialog also, but only with ONE choice.

And in all cases in the system panel / installed software
SageMath is only listed when you are the admin.
Which is in contrast to all other programs which are listed
for everyone, and the question for admin pops up only when
double-clicked.
