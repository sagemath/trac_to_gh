This operation is currently available for matrices over `RDF`.

The version for `FiniteRankFreeModuleMorphism` would define a new basis on each of the domain and codomain (with an orthogonal change of basis) so that the matrix of the morphism in the new bases is the diagonal of the singular values.

Example:

```
sage: M = FiniteRankFreeModule(ZZ, 3, name='M') 
sage: N = FiniteRankFreeModule(ZZ, 2, name='N') 
sage: e = M.basis('e') ; f = N.basis('f') 
sage: H = Hom(M,N) ; H 
Set of Morphisms from Rank-3 free module M over the Integer Ring to Rank-2 free module N over the Integer Ring in Category of finite dimensional modules over Integer Ring
sage: phi = H([[2,-1,3], [1,0,-4]], name='phi', latex_name=r'\phi') ; phi 
Generic morphism:
  From: Rank-3 free module M over the Integer Ring
  To:   Rank-2 free module N over the Integer Ring
sage: phi.matrix(e, f)                                                   
[ 2 -1  3]
[ 1  0 -4]
sage: f_prime = N.basis('f_prime', from_family=(f[0]-f[1], -2*f[0]+3*f[1]
# pretend that this basis is the right orthogonal matrix of the SVD...
sage: phi.matrix(e, f_prime)                                             
[ 8 -3  1]
[ 3 -1 -1]
```

If I'm understanding correctly after reading the code, we are still working with matrices (instead of high-dimensional tensors). Suppose `A` is the matrix obtained from `M.hom(N, some_matrix, basis=(e, f))`. Let `x.parent() == M`, `y.parent() == N`. Then we have:

```
y = A*x
y = U * S * V_dagger * x            # do SVD on A
(U_dagger * y) = S * (V_dagger * x) # invert U
y_prime = S*x_prime                 # renamed x and y
```

In code, we will reassign the default bases of `M` and `N`:

```
M._def_basis = V
N._def_basis = U                    # certainly, this reassignment needs more
                                    # work in terms of actual implementations
``` 

such that `S` would be the result of `hom.matrix()` in this new basis.

In Sage we support a wide range of rings for the arithmetic, and consequently often use multiple libraries for the implementation and also have an in-Sage generic implementation.

The existing implementation of `SVD` in `src/sage/matrix/matrix_double_dense.pyx` just calls `scipy.linalg.svd`.

It would be quite useful to add a generic implementation that only uses the general methods that Sage matrices offer. In that way, we could have access to arbitrary precision and symbolic computations.

It would also be good to check what other libraries that we already use or could easily use also provide implementations of SVD.

I think currently `SVD()` doesn't support other fields such as `ZZ`, or `QQ`. We may be restricted to `RDF` if we choose to use `matrix_double_dense.pyx`.

Could we consider symbolic SVD such as in MATLAB or `sympy`？ This way we can preserve the `QQ` structure, however I feel svd on `ZZ` will be a bit demanding..

Some development tools that help with this: 
- `./sage -fixdoctests src/sage/tensor/modules/free_module_morphism.py` will run the doctests and update the output
