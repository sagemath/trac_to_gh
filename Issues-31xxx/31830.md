```
On macOS, it has gotten harder to install all Perl libraries needed for polymake.

- To clean out previous installations of Perl packages:

  ```
  rm -rf ~/perl5
  ```

- System `/usr/bin/perl` on macOS Catalina is 5.18, does not have `EXTERN.h`. To compile Perl packages, need to make headers from XCode available by setting `CPATH`. Also need to override various test failures that seem to come from system integrity protection using `cpan install -f`.

  ```
  env CPATH="$(xcrun --show-sdk-path)/System/Library/Perl/5.18/darwin-thread-multi-2level/CORE:$CPATH" /usr/bin/cpan install -f XML::Writer XML::LibXML XML::LibXSLT File::Slurp JSON SVG || echo "(ignoring error)"
  ```
  (This setting of the environment variable should not be made persistent.)

- homebrew's perl5 .... info needed


- perlbrew (current recommendation by Perl users): https://perlbrew.pl/ https://github.com/gugod/App-perlbrew

- https://github.com/tokuhirom/plenv (alternative to perlbrew)
