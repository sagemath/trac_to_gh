Ready for review.

I don't have much experience with abstract complexes. I'd like to know if this is going in the right direction with Sage homology.

I'm also wondering what other methods of `PolyhedralComplex` could be interesting. Maybe interactions between `PolyhedralComplex` and `SimplicialComplex` such as `PolyhedralComplex.subdivide()` and `SimplicialComplex.geometric_realization()`? And interactions between `PolyhedralComplex` and rational polyhedral fan?

Note that the methods `wedge`, `chain_complex` and `alexander_whitney` are currently missing, as I don't know how to implement them.

Any advice or comment is greatly appreciated! Thanks.

It looks good to me so far, thank you for all of the work you've done.

> Note that the methods `wedge`, `chain_complex` and `alexander_whitney` are currently missing, as I don't know how to implement them.


I don't know anything about polyhedral complexes. The wedge is the one-point union, and to construct this, you're going to have to translate the two complexes so that they share a point. Is that acceptable? I could imagine taking a complex which has a point (x_1, x_2) and another complex which has a point (y_1, y_2), and forming the join by embedding both in a larger ambient space so that (x_1, x_2) -> (x_1, x_2, y_1, y_2) <- (y_1, y_2) — the first complex lies in the first coordinates, the second in the last coordinates. I don't know if that's a sensible construction from the point of view of people who actually work with these objects.

`chain_complex` — is there a standard way to produce a chain complex from a polyhedral complex? I would hope so, and I would hope that it's written down somewhere. We shouldn't invent something from scratch. Can we have a method that triangulates the complex and produces a simplicial complex? How hard would that be? I found this: https://sites.millersville.edu/rumble/slides/Seville-Feb-2018.pdf. Is it helpful?

`alexander_whitney` — I don't know how to handle this (although maybe the Umble slides describe it), and in any case, it's tied to a map of chain complexes, so there is no need to worry about it until the chain complex situation is resolved.

By the way, is it possible to have a class of abstract polyhedral complexes, in addition to these more concrete complexes? Maybe it would be nice to view the product of two simplicial complexes as an "abstract" polyhedral complex without having to choose embeddings of the simplicial complexes.

Do you mean the method `PolyhedralComplex.subdivide(make_simplicial=True)`? It produces a **geometric** simplicial complex. 
Then, #31842 - `CombinatorialPolyhedralComplex` will take care of making it abstract.

I might change `has_maximal_cell` to `is_maximal_cell`. What do you think?

I once heard that `self.is_xxx(other)` means that "`self` is xxx of `other`". Therefore, in this case, I would think that `cell.is_maximal_cell(polyhedralcomplex)` and `polyhedralcomplex.has_maximal_cell(cell)`. If this is not the convention in `sage/homology`, I'm happy to change the name to `is_maximal_cell`.

A few things to do before I would set a positive review:

- Add doctests for the `NotImplementedError` raising methods.
- Change `has_maximal_cell` to `is_maximal_cell` because that is what the docstring is saying. If this was `has_maximal_cell`, I would expect it not to take any other arguments.
- You can test plotting:
  {{{
sage: poset.plot(element_labels=d)                    # not tested
  }}}
- Change:
  {{{#!diff
-TESTS on nonbounded polyhedral complex::
+For a nonbounded polyhedral complex::
  }}}
- Add a `TestSuite(foo).run()` to the `__init__` doctests. (Not really necessary, but I like to see such a test there.)
