Japanese characters creep into various parts of Sage documentation. For example, the table of contents in the (English) Sage developer's guide (html) has headings in Japanese, and when building the PDF version of `it/a_tour_of_sage`, I see this error:

```
    ! Package inputenc Error: Unicode character リ (U+30EA)
```
Indeed, the file `local/share/doc/sage/latex/it/a_tour_of_sage/a_tour_of_sage.tex` has the line

```
    \renewcommand{\releasename}{リリース}
```
and also a few lines earlier

```
    \date{2021年06月08日}
```
and at the bottom

```
    \renewcommand{\indexname}{索引}
```
These lines are the same as in ja/a_tour_of_sage/a_tour_of_sage.tex.

Depends on #31948

<a id='comment:2'>**Comment 2:**</a>
Since maybe Sage 9.3, some interface elements of
the (English language) (html) developer guide appear
in Japanese for me in Sage built from source.

Comparing the online version and my local version
of the "Git setup" page for instance:

- https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/git_setup.html
- file:///path_to_sage/local/share/doc/sage/html/en/developer/git_setup.html

the correspondence is as follows.

Menu headers in the left menu:

- Table of Contents - 目次
- Previous topic - 前のトピックへ
- Next topic - 次のトピックへ
- This Page - このページ
- Quick search - クイック検索

Navigation menu (top right and bottom right):

- previous - 前へ
- next - 次へ
- index - 索引

Nice catch. Previously the different languages were isolated in separate processes via `build_many`, now they run serially in the same Python process, so there's a potential for state to persist.
