(from #30589)

On OS X Big Sur + various homebrew packages, if I use

```
% ./configure --with-system-python3=no --enable-download-from-upstream-url 
```
then Sage builds (if I also incorporate various other changes from #30651), but I get doctest failures of the form

```
File "src/sage/misc/sagedoc.py", line 646, in sage.misc.sagedoc.format
Failed example:
    cython('\n'.join(cython_code))
Expected nothing
Got:
    ld: warning: dylib (/usr/local/lib/libmpfr.dylib) was built for newer macOS version (11.0) than being linked (10.9)
    ld: warning: dylib (/usr/local/lib/libgmp.dylib) was built for newer macOS version (11.0) than being linked (10.9)
    ld: warning: dylib (/usr/local/lib/libgmpxx.dylib) was built for newer macOS version (11.0) than being linked (10.9)
    ld: warning: dylib (/usr/local/lib/libgsl.dylib) was built for newer macOS version (11.0) than being linked (10.9)
    ld: warning: dylib (/usr/local/lib/libntl.dylib) was built for newer macOS version (11.0) than being linked (10.9)
```
We should filter out these warnings in doctesting.

MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=11.0 ./sage -t --random-seed=0 src/sage/docs/instancedoc.pyx

I think the underlying problem lies in the python that sage is using.  You can see this, for example, by running sage and trying


```
import sysconfig
sysconfig.get_config_var("MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET")
```

the issue is that the homebrew libraries were built on a particular operating system with its own deployment target, which is newer than the python target of sage.  This problem also manifests itself in #31227 where /usr/bin/python3 has the target set to 10.14.6 for some reason.

I wonder if you can try to fix this by making sage set MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET environment variable when it's run.  You can probably get away with just setting it to whatever version of the Mac operating system you are on.

```diff
