(from #30589)

On OS X Big Sur + various homebrew packages, if I use

```
% ./configure --with-system-python3=no --enable-download-from-upstream-url 
```
then Sage builds (if I also incorporate various other changes from #30651), but I get doctest failures of the form

```
File "src/sage/misc/sagedoc.py", line 646, in sage.misc.sagedoc.format
Failed example:
    cython('\n'.join(cython_code))
Expected nothing
Got:
    ld: warning: dylib (/usr/local/lib/libmpfr.dylib) was built for newer macOS version (11.0) than being linked (10.9)
    ld: warning: dylib (/usr/local/lib/libgmp.dylib) was built for newer macOS version (11.0) than being linked (10.9)
    ld: warning: dylib (/usr/local/lib/libgmpxx.dylib) was built for newer macOS version (11.0) than being linked (10.9)
    ld: warning: dylib (/usr/local/lib/libgsl.dylib) was built for newer macOS version (11.0) than being linked (10.9)
    ld: warning: dylib (/usr/local/lib/libntl.dylib) was built for newer macOS version (11.0) than being linked (10.9)
```
We should filter out these warnings in doctesting.

I'm not sure why the "..." doesn't capture all of this. Maybe it matches the verbatim "..." in the doctest output, or maybe it doesn't capture multiline strings.

I modified the filter a bit, starting it with "dylib..." instead of "ld: warning: dylib...", since I've seen a few cases without "ld: warning".

I was doing some testing today and could, for example, eliminate these warnings by doing something like:

MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=11.0 ./sage -t --random-seed=0 src/sage/docs/instancedoc.pyx

I think the underlying problem lies in the python that sage is using.  You can see this, for example, by running sage and trying


```
import sysconfig
sysconfig.get_config_var("MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET")
```

the issue is that the homebrew libraries were built on a particular operating system with its own deployment target, which is newer than the python target of sage.  This problem also manifests itself in #31227 where /usr/bin/python3 has the target set to 10.14.6 for some reason.

I wonder if you can try to fix this by making sage set MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET environment variable when it's run.  You can probably get away with just setting it to whatever version of the Mac operating system you are on.

What happen's if you try

```
MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=11.0 ./sage -t src/sage/misc/sagedoc.py
```

That won't change sysconfig's deployment target, but it might stop the linking warnings.

(I just ran make distclean for some reason and won't be able to test until tomorrow)

1. unconditionally (on OS X only, I mean) set `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` before running doctests?
2. set it conditionally based on some test of Python? If so, what test?
3. don't set it at all, but print a message (either always or conditionally) suggesting that the user might set it?
4. something else?

Do we set it in `src/bin/sage-runtests` or somewhere else?

It is, and the only thing I can think is to change the doctest:

```diff

What do you think about that?
