If the class `Mutability` is used as mixin for mutability features, the pickling goes wrong (see [here](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/30261#comment:9)).

An attempt using this mixin class after #30281, still throws a pickling test error, e.g. in #30310:


```

```

I found out that a non-cythonized alternative works without errors.

Depends on #31196

Turns out that

```diff
from sage.misc.decorators import sage_wraps
+cimport cython

+@cython.auto_pickle(True)
cdef class Mutability:
```

helps.

But I cannot really tell why that is and if that's a reasonable approach. I am not a pickling expert.

That is likely an issue with how the pickling is implemented and affects all C/Python classes equally. This likely requires implementations of `__reduce__` in the corresponding classes that use it. It's been awhile since I've looked this closely at a pickling issue. There might be some better/more general way to do it.

What I said isn't an opinion but a fact.

> The class `Mutability` is intended to be mixed in, right? Every class in Sage must inherit from `SageObject`, either directly or within an inheritance tree. In order to use `Mutability`, we need therefore two inheritances since `Mutability` does *not* inherit from `SageObject`. But a second inheritance is not allowed if the subsequent class is a Cython class as well. Having `class Sequence(SageObject, Mutability)` on the other hand is allowed but *only* if `Mutability` is a Python class (see [here](https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/userguide/extension_types.html#subclassing) for details).

There is a key difference here: the class being an *extension type*, i.e., a `cdef` class. If you don't believe me, try it. Here is a minimal example:

```
sage: %%cython
....: cdef class Foo:
....:     pass
....: cdef class Bar:
....:     pass
....: class MyClass(Foo, Bar):  # Change to cdef class to see it fail
....:     pass
....:
sage: C = MyClass()
```

> My point is, classes which inherit from another Cython class, in particular any `cdef` class, can therefore *never* benefit from this mix in class if `Mutability` stays Cythonic (this should hold true for almost every class in Sage).

This is not true. In fact, there are lots of examples in Sage that use `Parent` and `WithEqualityById` via `UniqueRepresentation`.

See above.

> In any case, due to the above reasons, I suggest a class `SageObjectWithMutability` inheriting from `SageObject` implementing the mutability feature. That would be useful for `Sequence`, `BundleConnection`, `AffineConnection` and probably even more.

Strong -1. See above.

If this approach gets a positive review as well as #30284 based upon that, I'll add an explicit doctest for the pickling with #30284 to this file.

If I understand this correctly, `__setstate__` and `__getstate__` are high level methods so that any implementation of `__reduce__` would overwrite their behavior, which is exactly what we want.

I tried to write a test into the docstring:

```
sage: class A(SageObject, Mutability):
....:     def __init__(self, val):
....:         self._val = val
....:     def change(self, val):
....:         self._require_mutable()
....:         self._val = val
....:     def __hash__(self):
....:         self._require_immutable()
....:         return hash(self._val)
sage: a = A(4)
sage: loads(dumps(a))
```

The doctest fails with:

```
Failed example:
    loads(dumps(a))
Exception raised:
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/home/michi/Projekte/sage-devel/local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/sage/doctest/forker.py", line 714, in _run

```

It is a bit odd since it works perfectly within a usual Sage instance. Only as a doctest this fails. Doctests where `Mutability` is included in #30284 on the other hand work perfectly again.

Okay, seems to be perfectly normal, see `_test_pickling` in `sage_object.pyx`:

```

            sage: class Bla(SageObject): pass
            sage: Bla()._test_pickling()
            Traceback (most recent call last):
            ...
            PicklingError: Can't pickle <class '__main__.Bla'>: attribute
            lookup ... failed

        TODO: for a stronger test, this could send the object to a
        remote Sage session, and get it back.
```

I'll just add, as already suggested, some tests from #30284 as soon as this ticket is ready, too.
