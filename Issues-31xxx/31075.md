The code formatter "black" is probably the most popular one for Python. We add basic configuration and documentation for it.

I would actually propose to reformat the whole code base with black, and then require that people use it before checkin their code (checked via the official github action). In this way one could get rid of all the formatting problems once and for all. This global reformat probably needs to be done by the release manager to prevent merge conflicts.

I agree: I would prefer not to use black as a commit hook.  I find that it adds a lot of unnecessary whitespace.  As an example, here's a diff produced by black that I find makes the code less readable:

```
-verbose("Approximants of %r on %r towards %r"%(self, self.domain(), G), level=3)
+verbose(
+    "Approximants of %r on %r towards %r" % (self, self.domain(), G), level=3
+)
```

I also don't think it's worth making a change across Sage that will break everyone's outstanding branches.
