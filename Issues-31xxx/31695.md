After merging the pynac sources as `src/sage/symbolic/ginac` (#32386), we are able to create a distribution package **sagemath-symbolics**, containing the integrated pynac from that ticket and most of 
- `sage.symbolic`, 
- `sage.calculus`, 
- `sage.functions`, 
- `sage.interfaces` (parts),
- `sage.rings.asymptotic`,
- `sage.geometry.hyperbolic_space`
- `sage.manifolds`

There are many parts of Sage that (fortunately!) do not depend at all on Sage symbolics, or only depend on it for some smaller features. For example, `sage.graphs` has 0 imports from `sage.symbolic`, `sage.combinat` just a handful, etc. (Removing unnecessary uses of `SR` and symbolic functions is done in #32411, #32413, #32415, #32416, ...; refactoring to avoid dependencies via `is_...` functions and similar is addressed in #32414.)

As of this ticket, **sagemath-symbolics** will be a subset distribution  that is a superset of **sagemath-categories** (#29865), similar to **sagemath-linbox** (#31444) and **sagemath-polyhedra** (#32432). (Later, when the namespace package mechanism is in place, it will become a native namespace package.)

Like **sagemath-linbox**, also **sagemath-symbolics** has non-pip-installable dependencies: `ecl`, `maxima`, `giac`, `singular` (for pynac's use of libfactory)
