<a id='comment:5'></a>Hi David,

Great start.

Let us stick to `SL(2,Z)` in this ticket. Further improvements (other congruence subgroups, Bloch-Okounkov brackets should be reserved for other tickets).

Some concrete remarks
- `QuasiModularFormsRing` could simply be `QuasiModularForms`
- The main class should inherit from `Parent` and the category should be properly initialized, see https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/thematic_tutorials/coercion_and_categories.html
- The objective is to manipulate exact formal objects. Not approximate q-series. The following operations should be available on the elements
  - equality tests between two qm-forms
  - decomposition of a qm-form with respect to the grading (ie by level)
  - testing modularity
  - computing the q-series expansion of a qm-form (arbitrary precision)
  - multiplication by a modular form (maybe the simplest to achieve this is to define qm-forms as an algebra over modular forms?)
  - (further ticket) computing algebraic or differential equations (for that purpose it is necessary to have formal derivatives, not the derivative of the q-expansion)
  - (further ticket) asymptotics of coefficients
- The following methods should be available on the parent (the algebra itself)
  - vector space basis of a given graded component
  - basis and generators up to modular forms

<a id='comment:25'></a>This

```
        if not self._polynomial.degree():
            return self._polynomial[0].is_modular_form()
        else:
            return False
```
is equivalent to

```
return not self._polynomial.degree() and self._polynomial[0].is_modular_form()
```


Why do you store base ring in the element (attribute `__base_ring`)? This would better be accessed through the parent. Note that `ModuleElement` has a default implementation of the method `base_ring` as

```
def base_ring(self):
    return self._parent.base_ring()
```
Also, since you inherit from `Parent`, there is already a slot dedicated to that. Namely `_base`. This is initialized inside the constructor

```
Parent.__init__(self, base=..., category=...)
```
So : remove `__base_ring` from both `QuasiModularForms` and `QuasiModularFormsElement`.
