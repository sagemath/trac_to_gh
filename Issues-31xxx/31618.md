The goal of this ticket is to structure and polish the documentation of Brandt modules, in particular the following:
- add a sub-heading "Brandt Modules" to separate it clearly from generalities about quaternion algebras, orders and ideals
- point the reader to methods (of quaternion algebras, Brandt modules etc.) rather than top-level functions from sage.modular.quatalg.brandt
- use a consistent definition of level; since this module implements things from Pizer's paper, it seems best to use his definition
- talk about general orders rather than Eichler orders; the distinction does not seem very important in this introduction
- fix a typo noticed in[comment:3](#comment%3A3):ticket:31582.
