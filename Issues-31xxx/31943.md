There's a very simple bug in Sagemath's PARI/GP 2.11.4, currently fixed in PARI/GP master, such that we'll get this error

```
gp(\'qfminim(Mat([1.]),,,)\')

  ***   at top-level: qfminim(Mat([1.]),,,2)
  ***                 ^----------------------
  *** qfminim: precision too low in qfminim.
```

Unfortunately, the same bug is also affecting some of the number theory code I've written, as it uses the Fincke-Post algorithm via qfminim() to fetch lattice points for a grid search.

This is PARI/GP bug 2262:

https://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=2262

```
A missing mandatory flag when calling lllfp in fincke_pohst() was
causing internal confusion (same error on qfminit(Mat(1),,,2)).
```

Keywords: **PARI/GP qfminim**
