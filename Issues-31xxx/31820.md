The normaliz cone is recreated after loading a saved normaliz polyhedron. Unfortunatly, it is recreated from the representation objects and not from the corresponding vectors. This leads to circular dependencies that are not always successfully resolved:

```
sage: P = polytopes.cube(backend='normaliz')                                    
sage: v = P.Vrepresentation()[0]                                                
sage: v1 = loads(v.dumps())                                                     
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
~/Applications/sage/local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/sage/geometry/polyhedron/representation.py in __getitem__(self, i)
     83             2
     84         """
---> 85         return self._vector[i]
     86 
     87     def __hash__(self):

AttributeError: 'Vertex' object has no attribute '_vector'
```

We fix this by initialization of the cone from the vectors instead.
