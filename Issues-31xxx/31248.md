The current error messages of the standard and semistandard tableaux assert that rows are weakly increasing and columns are strictly increasing. On failing this property, a generic error of the form


"The rows of <<specific tableaux>> are not weakly increasing"

is printed. I propose to make the information more precise, to print errors of the form:


"row (1) is not weakly increasing between columns (2, 3)"

Thank you for contributing.

Can you please fill in "Author" and "Component" field.

Why did you remove the first line "coding: utf-8"?

No, the release manager (Volker Braun) takes care of it.
A number of people can close tickets for invalidity/duplicate etc,
but the actual merging is done by one person only (and a number of bots/scripts that help).

A positively reviewed ticket with green bots and all fields filled in will usually be merged in a week or two or rejected (merge conflict, issues with specific architectures, failing bots). But it might take longer (too many positively review tickets waiting, end of release cycle).
