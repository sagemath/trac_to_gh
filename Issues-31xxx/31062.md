(from #30556)

... because we still don't have openssl on some platforms and so can't install pip packages.

We also make two minor fixes to package dependencies that are conditionalized on SAGE_CHECK:
- `sage_sws2rst` was using the wrong variable for the conditionalization
- `rpy2` likes to have ipython available for tests (https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/1561098042):

```
