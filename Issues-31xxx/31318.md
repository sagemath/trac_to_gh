In preparation for dropping support for Python 3.6 in Sage 9.4 (#30551), we issue a deprecation warning when `configure` accepts a system python 3.6. For example, on `ubuntu-bionic` Python 3.6 is the default, but Python 3.7 is also available, and users will want to consider using that by the configure option `--with-python=...`.

To test: `tox -e docker-ubuntu-bionic-standard -- config.status`.
