Here is some sample parallel code taken from [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/19699363):

```
from multiprocessing import Pool
def myfunc(x):
    return [i for i in range(x)]

A = []
def mycallback(x):
    print('mycallback is called with {}'.format(x))
    A.extend(x)

pool=Pool()
r = pool.map_async(myfunc, (1,2), callback=mycallback)
r.wait()
print(A)
```

In usual python, it outputs

```
mycallback is called with [[0], [0, 1]]
[[0], [0, 1]]
```
In Sage-python (e.g. cocalc.com), it outputs

```
[]
```
