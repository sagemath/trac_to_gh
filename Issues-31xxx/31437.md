Viewing x<sup>3</sup> as a polynomial in ZZ[x][y], its factorization should be x<sup>3</sup> with a unit of 1, but Sage places x<sup>3</sup> in the unit:

```python
sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(ZZ) 
....: S.<y> = PolynomialRing(R) 
....: p = S(x^3); 
....: factor(p).unit()                                                          
x^3
sage: dict(factor(p))
{}
```

Using ZZ[x,y] gives the right answers:

```python
sage: S.<x,y> = PolynomialRing(ZZ) 
....: p = S(x^3); 
....: factor(p).unit()
1
sage: dict(factor(p))                                                           
{x: 3}
```
