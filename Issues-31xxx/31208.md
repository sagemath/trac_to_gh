Sage is compiled with `-march=native` by default with #27122. We make use of this and use it to obtain faster length and a faster iterator for bitsets, when the instructions are available. (Those are the instructions that do not require overalignment.)

Comparison is performed on an Intel i7 with both instructions available (cpu flags `popcnt` and `bmi1`).

Tests are run with #31197, as this provides an easy use case for a bitset iterator.

Before:

```                                                           
sage: set_random_seed(0)
sage: B = Bitset([randint(0,1000000) for _ in range(100000)])
sage: %timeit len(B)
15.2 µs ± 8.99 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100000 loops each)

sage: set_random_seed(0)
sage: edges = [(randint(0,1000), randint(0,1000)) for _ in range(100000)]
sage: G = Graph(edges, sparse=False, loops=True) 
sage: %timeit _ = G.copy(sparse=False)
2.62 ms ± 2.75 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops each)
sage: H = G.copy(sparse=False)
sage: %timeit H == G
2.45 ms ± 2.06 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops each)
```

After:

```
sage: set_random_seed(0)
sage: B = Bitset([randint(0,1000000) for _ in range(100000)])
sage: %timeit len(B)
5.87 µs ± 7.7 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100000 loops each)

sage: set_random_seed(0)
sage: edges = [(randint(0,1000), randint(0,1000)) for _ in range(100000)]
sage: G = Graph(edges, sparse=False, loops=True)
sage: %timeit _ = G.copy(sparse=False)
2.32 ms ± 6.73 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops each)
sage: H = G.copy(sparse=False)
sage: %timeit H == G
2.04 ms ± 2.38 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops each)
```

Before setting this ticket to positive review, it would be better to have a second opinion.
