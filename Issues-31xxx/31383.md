An issue found by Thibaut Verron:

```
sage: S.<x> = PowerSeriesRing(QQ)
sage: L = Frac(S)
sage: s = L(O(x^2))*x^(-1)
sage: s.power_series()
TypeError: self is not a power series

<div id="comment:4" align="right">Comment 4</div>

I think the problem is that the previous doctest is

```
sage: L.<t> = LaurentSeriesRing(GF(2))
sage: R.<x,y> = PolynomialRing(L)
sage: O = L._power_series_ring
sage: S.<x,y> = PolynomialRing(O)
sage: t**(-1)*x*y in S
False
```
Tbis redefines the variable `O`, which messes up your doctest. Changing this variable to a different letter should fix the problem.

However, I do think there is a different bug in the code, because the following should return `TypeError: self is not a power series`, instead of `O(x^0)`:

```
sage: S.<x> = PowerSeriesRing(QQ)                                                                                                                          
sage: L = Frac(S)                                                                                                                                          
sage: s = L(O(x^2))*x^(-3)

That's debatable given how power series (for some reason I don't understand) are considered to be zero when all of their known coefficients are zero. But I think I agree with you...

However, the docstring starts immediately with `EXAMPLE`. Would you be willing to add a short descriptive blurb at the start? I was thinking something like:

```
Return a power series that is equal to `self`.

A `TypeError` is raised if `self` has a term (or an error term `O(x^k)`)
whose exponent is negative.

That's a bit out of scope for this ticket, but fine.

I don't want to document the fact that it raises a `TypeError` though, because I don't think it is the correct choice (it should be a `ValueError`).
