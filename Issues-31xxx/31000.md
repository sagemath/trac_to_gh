Keywords: macOS, app

This ticket is to track reviving the macOS app.
Possibly as an independent project.

One model is [Gap.app](https://cocoagap.sourceforge.io/),
a standalone app for GAP, developed by Russ Woodroofe,
downloadable either bundled with GAP, or by itself
to make it work with an existing GAP installation.

Done at the 3-manifolds project!

Marc Culler now maintains **Sage-macOS**,
a Sage macOS app available at

- https://github.com/3-manifolds/Sage_macOS/releases
