This ticket is to track reviving the macOS app.
Possibly as an independent project.

One model is [Gap.app](https://cocoagap.sourceforge.io/),
a standalone app for GAP, developed by Russ Woodroofe,
downloadable either bundled with GAP, or by itself
to make it work with an existing GAP installation.
