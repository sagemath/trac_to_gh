This ticket is to track reviving the macOS app.
Possibly as an independent project.

One model is [Gap.app](https://cocoagap.sourceforge.io/),
a standalone app for GAP, developed by Russ Woodroofe,
downloadable either bundled with GAP, or by itself
to make it work with an existing GAP installation.

This actually works!  No small feat.  Tested on High Sierra - very painless installation, jsmol and threejs work, very basic math goes fine in Jupyter and command line.  Not even any warnings from Apple, again no small feat.  Obviously not as fully featured as the previous app, but given that sagenb is now dead and many of the other features may not have been used as much, definitely much preferable to not having anything for Mac users of this type.  Kudos!
