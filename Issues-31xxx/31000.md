This ticket is to track reviving the macOS app.
Possibly as an independent project.

One model is [Gap.app](https://cocoagap.sourceforge.io/),
a standalone app for GAP, developed by Russ Woodroofe,
downloadable either bundled with GAP, or by itself
to make it work with an existing GAP installation.

I guess that is more of a question for Matthias and those spearheading the modular install - for instance, would/should an eventual reprised Mac app include packages that in principle exist on a modern Mac, such as Python 3 or git - or should one rely on being able to install command line tools?  (My vote would be for having one that requires zero command line available as an option, as that was very useful in many circumstances, especially for beginners, but I assume I don't get a say since I no longer can actively develop at this time.)",
