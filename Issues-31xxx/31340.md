It was discovered in #31313 that constructing a row of an integer matrix results in a memory leak on some platforms. The leak was seen on MacOS 10.15.7 and `CoCalc` (Ubuntu 20.04), but not CentOS Linux 7.9.2009 (see [#31313 comment:6](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/31313#comment:6) and [#31313 comment:5](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/31313#comment:5)). On MacOS:

```
sage: A = Matrix(ZZ, 200)
sage: def memleak(A):
....:     for i in range(10000):
....:         row0 = A[0]
sage: memleak(A)
sage: start_mem = get_memory_usage()
sage: memleak(A)
sage: print(f"memory leak = {round(get_memory_usage() - start_mem)}MB")
memory leak = 48.0MB
```
The leak seems to disappear if `ZZ` is replaced with  `QQ` or `RR` or `GF(2^10)`.

It seems that a substantial part of the leak arises from just making a list of integers:

```
def memleak():
    for i in range(10000):
        [ZZ(1) for j in range(200)]
memleak()
start_mem = get_memory_usage()
memleak()
print(f"memory leak = {get_memory_usage() - start_mem}MB")
```
I got different results on different runs, but on MacOS they were usually around 15MB, though I also got 26MB and 31MB. `CoCalc` seemed to be consistently about 30MB. I usually (but not always) got 0.0MB for `QQ`, `RR`, and `GF(2^10)`.

There is also usually no leak if I change `[ZZ(1) for j in range(200)]` to `[ZZ(1)] * 200`.

I discovered the same problem at #31511

For what it is worth, in my process of debugging it I found that the leak is not caused by objects the python garbage collector knows about:

The code:

```
import sys
import gc

for x in range(4):
    M = 3000
    mem = get_memory_usage()

    objs1 = None
    objs2 = None
    gc.collect()
    gc.collect()
    objs1 = gc.get_objects()
    for i in range(10^3):
        R = [ZZ(10) for z in range(500,500+M)]
    R = None
    gc.collect()
    gc.collect()
    objs2 = gc.get_objects()
    print("memory usage %s:"%M, get_memory_usage(mem))
    obj1_ids = {id(obj) for obj in objs1}
    objs_new = [obj for obj in objs2 if (not id(obj) in obj1_ids) and not obj is objs1]
    print("nr_new_objects",len(objs_new))
    print("new_objects", objs_new)
    print("new_object_types", [type(obj) for obj in objs_new])
    print("new_object_sizes", [sys.getsizeof(obj)  for obj in objs_new])
    objs1 = None
    objs2 = None
    obj1_ids = None
    objs_new = None
    gc.collect()
```
produces:

```
memory usage 3000: 90.3125
nr_new_objects 3
new_objects [[], [], <bound method Condition.__exit__ of <Condition(<unlocked _thread.lock object at 0x7fb77dfcf090>, 1)>>]
new_object_types [<class 'list'>, <class 'list'>, <class 'method'>]
new_object_sizes [56, 56, 64]
memory usage 3000: 90.8984375
nr_new_objects 0
new_objects []
new_object_types []
new_object_sizes []
memory usage 3000: 90.8828125
nr_new_objects 0
new_objects []
new_object_types []
new_object_sizes []
memory usage 3000: 90.8828125
nr_new_objects 0
new_objects []
new_object_types []
new_object_sizes []
```
Showing that the only new uncollectible items produced during the loop is some negligible threading stuff that is not relevant for the leak.

My knowledge of memory leaks in python stops where the knowledge of the gc stops, so I am throwing my hat in the ring.

I wouldn't even know how to deactivate the highly optimized memory allocation using the pool. I mean some custom memory allocation/deallocation (or at least mpz integer creation destruction code) is still needs to happen since we do need the mpz integer in the background.

However it seems that the current source code also contains some hints that might fix the problem:

```
        #  "This chapter is provided only for informational purposes and the
        #  various internals described here may change in future GMP releases.
        #  Applications expecting to be compatible with future releases should use
        #  only the documented interfaces described in previous chapters."
        #
        # If this line is used Sage is not such an application.
        #
        # The clean version of the following line is:
        #
        #  mpz_init( <mpz_t>(<char *>new + mpz_t_offset) )
        #
        # We save time both by avoiding an extra function call and
        # because the rest of the mpz struct was already initialized
        # fully using the memcpy above.

        (<__mpz_struct *>( <char *>new + mpz_t_offset) )._mp_d = <mp_ptr>mpz_alloc(GMP_LIMB_BITS >> 3)
```

```
    # Again, we move to the mpz_t and clear it. See above, why this is evil.
    # The clean version of this line would be:
    #   mpz_clear(<mpz_t>(<char *>o + mpz_t_offset))

    mpz_free((<__mpz_struct *>( <char *>o + mpz_t_offset) )._mp_d, 0)
```

However I don't have a sage development environment on a machine where I can test if replacing those lines with the clean versions in the comments actually solves the problem.

No.

- Not using the pool is very likely to be a huge speed regression. This is the reason why there were introduced in the first place. The pool is critical, when one accesses at a Python/Cython level to the coefficient of a matrix or a polynomial. It is important to perform benchmarks here.
- Reproduce the memory leak with `RDF`

See https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/typeobj.html#Py_TPFLAGS_HAVE_GC . If an object has pointers to other python objects, then the cyclic garbage collector needs to trace through it, and reference counts need to be propagated upon deletion of the object. Integers shouldn't do that; at least not a light-weight mpz wrapper. (objects without these flags aren't tracked, so `gc_objects` wouldn't find them. The leak can still easily be on the python heap.

**Concerning memory pools:**

Having something like memory pools in place is probably necessary, but Python has also evolved since this code was written and it may no longer be the fastest solution.

I wanted to start working on this. But I seem to have one problem. The only machine where I can reproduce the problem, is a machine where I don't have a big enough diskspace quota to set up my own development version of sage.

I thought I would be able to reproduce it on a machine using Ubuntu 18.04 using sage-9.3beta9 however:

wow, and that's why on Fedora 30 there is no leak - they are on gmp 6.1.2, whereas
the trouble starts with gmp 6.2.

From that link

```
I investigated this more, and came to the conclusion that Sage is
incompatible with libgmp 6.2 due to the following commit:

https://gmplib.org/repo/gmp-6.2/rev/299ec6187305

This invalidates the assumptions Sage's rings/integer.pyx makes about
libgmp internals. The "global_dummy_Integer" object created there
without an explicit value will now be created using libgmp's new lazy
allocation, and Sage's fast_tp_new() forcibly changing the _mp_d member
of such an object to a new allocation will lead to an inconsistent
state (allocation size still set to 0, but non-dummy pointer set). This
causes libgmp to disregard the existing pointer and leak the memory
when setting a new value in the object.

I believe (haven't tested though) that a quick workaround would be to
change

global_dummy_Integer = Integer()
to 
global_dummy_Integer = Integer(1)
which would force the global default object to use non-lazy allocation.
```

The removal in [comment 12](https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31340?replyto=29#comment:12) is maybe removing things at random without knowing the exact cause. 

However the current change:
 

```diff
cdef Integer global_dummy_Integer
-global_dummy_Integer = Integer()
+global_dummy_Integer = Integer(1) - Integer(1)
```

is based on the analysis in https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=964848#10 that even pinpoints the exact commit in gmp that caused sage to become incompatible with gmp. And just makes sure that the global dummy integer is correctly initialized even with gmp's new lazy allocation mechanism.  I really don't know what else there is you want to know.

Sorry, I haven't had time last week to keep up with Sage, but thank you for pointing this out.  I was reacting earlier to proposals to remove the integer pool.

The lazy allocation optimization in GMP is a good idea in general, but it's a shame it didn't come with an API addition for bypassing this and making immediate allocations without some kind of hack like this.

The fix here is incorrect, see #33081.

In fact `Integer(1) - Integer(1)` creates an integer 0 but with `_mp_alloc == 2`. However, `fast_tp_new()` only allocates one limb, creating bad integers.

See #33081 for more details and a new fix.

TL;DR: the API is to use `_mpz_realloc(..., 1)` to reallocate the dummy integer to exactly one limb.

BTW: reusing an integer from the pool is about 10 times faster than creating a new one (something like 5ns vs 50ns)
