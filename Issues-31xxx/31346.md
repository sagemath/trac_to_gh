This is a proposal for changing the workflow for upgrading Python packages, using `pipenv`.

Current practice: 
- Tickets for either upgrading a single package, a set of related packages, a set of unrelated packages; #31280
  (see https://trac.sagemath.org/query?summary=~update&milestone=sage-9.2&or&milestone=sage-9.3&summary=~upgrade&groupdesc=1&group=status&max=1500&col=id&col=summary&col=component&col=time&col=changetime&col=author&col=reviewer&col=keywords&order=component). 
- `sage --package update-latest` helps

Issues with current practice:
- TBD

Proposed change:
- (draft, from #30371)
  The workflow to update Python packages would then look as follows:
  - Run pipenv update
  - Test
  - If everything is fine, create ticket updating pipfile.lock and create a ticket for each updated dependency that is also listed in sage's build/pgks folder.
