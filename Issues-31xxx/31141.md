If we are adding a coproduct, does that mean it should belong to the category of bialgebras?

Hello Travis, and happy new year to you !

Well, this is in fact a coaction and not a coproduct, as the left-hand side lives in a quotient algebra (modulo pi^2).

One could add the category "Coalgebras", but this would be slightly wrong.
