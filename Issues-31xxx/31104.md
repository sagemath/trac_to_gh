`sage.geometry.polyhedron` provides an opportunity to study use of `pytest` as a replacement for `TestSuite` (proposed in #30738) in a small self-contained codebase.

`_test_` methods for `Polyhedron_base` were only recently introduced in tickets such as #29934.

Important design constraint:

- The polyhedron objects that can be tested depend on the presence of optional packages / Python modules such as `PyNormaliz`.

That's straightforward to implement using pytest's mark mechanism: https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/example/markers.html. Question: should the tests on optional packages be automatically skipped if the optional package is not installed (`mark.skipif`) or do you want to have the option to include/exclude all tests depending on the optional package (e.g. add `mark.pynormaliz` to the test class/method and then select all tests relying on pyronmaliz with `pytest -m pynormaliz` or exclude them with `pytest -m "not pynormaliz"`)? In the latter case, in which granularity (specific optional package, all optional packages)?

Thanks for the pointer. 

> Question: should the tests on optional packages be automatically skipped if the optional package is not installed (`mark.skipif`) or do you want to have the option to include/exclude all tests depending on the optional package (e.g. add `mark.pynormaliz` to the test class/method and then select all tests relying on pyronmaliz with `pytest -m pynormaliz` or exclude them with `pytest -m "not pynormaliz"`)? 

Same as in the existing `sage -t` -- there's autodetection of packages/features, but the user can also pass `--optional=....` to override. See `sage.doctest.control` (which will need adjustments also in the course of the modularization effort).

In fact, given that any feasible transition plan will necessarily have both `TestSuite` and `pytest` tests in the codebase for some time, we should probably invoke `pytest` either from the doctests, or from the doctesting control script.
