To clarify my question, the Sage distribution ships a specific version of FPLLL (5.4.0 with this ticket); but if fpylll comes from PyPI, what future versions should we expect to support this version of FPLLL?

If FPLLL/FPyLLL do not have a policy regarding version compatibility, it would probably pay off to set one...

<a id='comment:41'></a>For some reason, even after make distclean, configure is unable to find homebrew install of fplll 5.4.0 (on macOS). Then, the compilation fails on `fpylll` (may be a mix of fplll installations).

After modifying `spkg-configure.m4` to change `fplll == 5.4.0` to `fplll >= 5.4.0` and adding file `distros/homebrew.txt` with `fplll`, configure finds the local install and everything goes well.

Should we open a ticket for that ?

Yes please. What version of fplll does pkg-config report?
