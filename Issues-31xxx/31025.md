To clarify my question, the Sage distribution ships a specific version of FPLLL (5.4.0 with this ticket); but if fpylll comes from PyPI, what future versions should we expect to support this version of FPLLL?

If FPLLL/FPyLLL do not have a policy regarding version compatibility, it would probably pay off to set one...

For some reason, even after make distclean, configure is unable to find homebrew install of fplll 5.4.0 (on macOS). Then, the compilation fails on `fpylll` (may be a mix of fplll installations).

After modifying `spkg-configure.m4` to change `fplll == 5.4.0` to `fplll >= 5.4.0` and adding file `distros/homebrew.txt` with `fplll`, configure finds the local install and everything goes well.

Should we open a ticket for that ?

not sure how to get that, but inside config.log, I see:

```
## ------------------------------------------------------ ##
## Checking whether SageMath should install SPKG fplll... ##
## ------------------------------------------------------ ##
configure:19538: checking whether any of mpfr is installed as or will be installed as SPKG
configure:19547: result: no
configure:19552: checking for fplll >= 5.4

configure:19562: $? = 0
configure:19576: $PKG_CONFIG --exists --print-errors "fplll >= 5.4"
configure:19579: $? = 0
configure:19617: result: yes
configure:19629: will use system package and not install SPKG fplll
```
and I have fplll 5.4.0 installed by homebrew.
