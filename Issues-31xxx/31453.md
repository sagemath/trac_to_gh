```

The answer to that question is "because I didn't think of it."

Replying to [mkoeppe](#comment%3A7):
> Why not just use `zip(self._sets_keys(), elements)`?


Using `_sets_keys` is CFM actually "wrong" and introduces a miniscule performance penalty in any method that (possibly indirectly) references `cartesian_factors()`. The CFM subclass method is,

```python
def cartesian_factors(self):
    return self._sets
```

which puts the factors in "left to right" order, regardless of what order `_sets_keys()` is in. Compare with the superclass method,

```python
def cartesian_factors(self):
    return tuple(self.cartesian_projection(i)
                 for i in self.parent()._sets_keys())
```

which... is at least... trying? to do the right thing?

In any case, using `count(0)` avoids giving the impression that the `sets_keys()` order is actually used for `elements`. I think either `_sets_keys()` should be used everywhere, for consistency, or nowhere, for performance.

In any case, for now I'd just like it to work =)

I've used your code.
