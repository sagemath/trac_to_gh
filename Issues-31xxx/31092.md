pynac is a fork of ginac 1.4.3 made in the early days of Sage. It uses Python objects instead of ginac's custom objects (and CLN numbers) and provides Python hooks that Sage uses. 
- https://github.com/pynac/pynac

#30534 proposed to repackage `pynac` as a pip-installable package, but instead #32386 merged the `pynac` sources into sagelib in `src/sage/symbolic/ginac`.

ginac appears to be under somewhat active development. 
- https://www.ginac.de/ginac.git/
- Ginac NEWS file https://www.ginac.de/ginac.git/?p=ginac.git;a=blob;f=NEWS;h=0a37b6ec0f0db5e0bf96009ab6d80bd2319619e5;hb=HEAD -- see changes since 1.4.3

This meta-ticket is for keeping track of changes in upstream ginac that should be merged into Sage, continuing the work described in the Pynac Changelog: https://github.com/pynac/pynac/wiki/Changelog

- #33401 ginac: Port C++ updates from upstream

I've done quite a bit of digging around pynac before, but I don't remember most of the details I learned.

One thing I wonder is why ginac needs to be patched, rather than providing a Python wrapper around plain ginac.

OTOH, I think adding support for Python objects to ginac is a potential win for them too...

Do we have any clue about **why** pynac developers choose to fork ginac rather than wrapping it or adding support for Sage objects ?

Having one well-maintained engine rather than three (I'm also thinking of `symengine`) would be beneficial to all parties...

If you troll through Trac and sage-devel you will eventually see a lot of details about this - I think it was at the time easier to just fork it to allow us to use different numbers than CLN.  I think also that ginac might not have been under as active of development at the time.

But in the end that is archaeology; if you are able to achieve this ticket's goals, that would be very useful in many ways.  A lot of ecosystems were not as well developed then.

But I think if we had a very modularized way to extend it to be easily used by Python (I don't know what that would entail) that didn't impact anything for "normal" GiNaC users, and presented it as a pull request, they might be willing.

 pynac is a fork of ginac 1.4.3 made in the early days of Sage. It uses Python objects instead of ginac's custom objects (and CLN numbers) and provides Python hooks that Sage uses.
