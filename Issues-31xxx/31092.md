pynac is a fork of ginac 1.4.3 made in the early days of Sage. It uses Python objects instead of ginac's custom objects (and CLN numbers) and provides Python hooks that Sage uses. 
- https://github.com/pynac/pynac

#30534 proposed to repackage `pynac` as a pip-installable package, but instead #32386 merged the `pynac` sources into sagelib in `src/sage/symbolic/ginac`.

ginac appears to be under somewhat active development. 
- https://www.ginac.de/ginac.git/
- Ginac NEWS file https://www.ginac.de/ginac.git/?p=ginac.git;a=blob;f=NEWS;h=0a37b6ec0f0db5e0bf96009ab6d80bd2319619e5;hb=HEAD -- see changes since 1.4.3

This meta-ticket is for keeping track of changes in upstream ginac that should be merged into Sage, continuing the work described in the Pynac Changelog: https://github.com/pynac/pynac/wiki/Changelog

- #33401 ginac: Port C++ updates from upstream

I've done quite a bit of digging around pynac before, but I don't remember most of the details I learned.

One thing I wonder is why ginac needs to be patched, rather than providing a Python wrapper around plain ginac.

OTOH, I think adding support for Python objects to ginac is a potential win for them too...

Do we have any clue about **why** pynac developers choose to fork ginac rather than wrapping it or adding support for Sage objects ?

Having one well-maintained engine rather than three (I'm also thinking of `symengine`) would be beneficial to all parties...

If you troll through Trac and sage-devel you will eventually see a lot of details about this - I think it was at the time easier to just fork it to allow us to use different numbers than CLN.  I think also that ginac might not have been under as active of development at the time.

But in the end that is archaeology; if you are able to achieve this ticket's goals, that would be very useful in many ways.  A lot of ecosystems were not as well developed then.
