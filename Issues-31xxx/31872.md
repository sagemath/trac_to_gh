This seems like it extends existing functionality. There is already a possible periods function for the rationals, see `possible_periods`. This ticket seems to extend that functionality to function fields, so we should add to the existing function instead of creating a new one.

Further, what algorithm is this based on? You mention a paper by Hutz, which paper is it?
