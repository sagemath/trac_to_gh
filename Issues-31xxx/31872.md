In dimension 1, this is not from my paper. As Alex said, this should be part of the `possible_periods` function rather than a new function. Similarly, the `mod` function it depends on should be part of `change_ring`.

Although since e can be unbounded in this case (see Silverman Arithmetic of Dynam. Sys. exercise 2.22), so some thought needs to be given here on what should be implemented. I'm less familiar with the function field set-up. Can you get around this unbounded e problem by using multiple primes?

My concern is that no matter what the user passes in for `e`, the function could be missing valid periods.
