`is_included_in` is only defined by `RealSet`. We deprecate it and replace it by `is_subset`.

The spelling `issubset` is used in Python sets. `is_subset` is widely used in Sage. Sympy provides both spellings (see #31926), but the source code notes that `issubset` "should be deprecated".

Can you also open a followup ticket (or on the original tickets or here) some quick fixes of some little things I missed during my previous reviews (sorry!):
