Here is an example to reproduce it yourself: 

```
theta,z=var('theta,z')
c = cylindrical_plot3d(2,(theta,0,2*pi),(z,-5,5))
```

Compare

```
c.show(aspect_ratio=1)
```

with

```
c.show(viewer='jmol', aspect_ratio=1)
```

In the `threejs` case, it is only possible to rotate the cylinder around its own axis, and along one horizontal axis. For example, it seems impossible to turn the cylinder so that it looks horizontal.

<div id="comment:1" align="right">Comment 1</div>

The viewer currently uses Three.js's `OrbitControls` to control the camera: https://threejs.org/examples/#misc_controls_orbit

Three.js also has a `TrackballControls` that might be useable with a bit of modification to the viewer: https://threejs.org/examples/#misc_controls_trackball

The trackball controls have no fixed "up" direction like the orbit controls. Is that similar to what you had in mind?

Yes it seems that `TrackballControls` would do the job, though it should still be tested within Sage context.
