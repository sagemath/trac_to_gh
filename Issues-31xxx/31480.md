Hitting tab completion after

```
sage: P = polytopes.cube()
sage: P.f_vector(
```

exposes incorrect lazy imports. We fix them. This will lead to hard crash of sage in ipython <7.20.0. In #31476 we will downgrade ipython again to recover Python 3.6 support.



Upgrading ipython would resolve the hard #31373

I decided to move this up to blocker, because it has a super easy and unproblematic fix and it is very annoying when sage crashes hard.
