I came to this same conclusion a few seconds ago =)

First I have to update our Gentoo package to 1.7.0.5 so that I can see the new output and fix the c++17 issue, but then I'll update this branch with tests that work with all versions.

This is not such a great example anyway:

```
sage: f = 1/x*((-2*x^(1/3)+1)^(1/4))^3

I think I'll replace it with an integral that I can do in my head.

I'm not blaming giac for anything here. The existing test was a bad choice:

1. It was testing the exact string form of an indefinite integral, which, as you note, is unreliable for many reasons.
2. The results of that indefinite integral do not agree (even up to a constant) between the various integration engines we have, so who knows if "expected" output is correct.

My use of `(x=1).n()` just makes it clear that the answers are different, since the resulting expression is rather ugly.
