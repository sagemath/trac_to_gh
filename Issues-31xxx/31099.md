```
We create `tox` environments `local-conda-forge-environment[-optional]`. 
In contrast to `...-standard` and `...-minimal`, they use the files `$SAGE_ROOT/environment*.yml` (generated by `bootstrap`) to set up the conda environment.

To test locally:

```
  tox -e local-conda-forge-environment
  tox -e local-conda-forge-environment-optional
```

We also add them to the GH Actions workflow to ensure that the files `environment*.yml` are generated correctly.


See also:
- #30845, which adds tests for the files `SAGE_ROOT/src/environment*.yml`

Can't continue at the moment because miniforge3 on macOS seems broken at the moment

```
Miniforge3 will now be installed into this location:
/Users/mkoeppe/s/sage/sage-rebasing/worktree-algebraic-2018-spring/.tox/local-conda-forge-environment_yml/conda

  - Press ENTER to confirm the location
  - Press CTRL-C to abort the installation
  - Or specify a different location below

That's right.

> These question arose because I have trouble understanding how this interplay now works. Ok, I can now run `tox -e local-conda-forge-environment` but what is the advantage of this over `conda env create environment.yml && sage -t` ?

`conda env create environment.yml && sage -t` does not work -- it's missing the build of Sage between the two commands!

`tox -e local-conda-forge-environment` includes that -- and it does so in an isolated install tree (`SAGE_LOCAL`) under `.tox/`

All of the `local` tox environments pass on the `MAKE` variable. If you want to build in parallel, use `export MAKE="make -j16"`.

On this ticket, the only change to the existing `tox -e local-conda-forge-standard` is that using the environment files is tested, instead of using `conda install PACKAGES....`
