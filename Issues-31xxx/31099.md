```
We create `tox` environments `local-conda-forge-environment[-optional]`. 
In contrast to `...-standard` and `...-minimal`, they use the files `$SAGE_ROOT/environment*.yml` (generated by `bootstrap`) to set up the conda environment.

To test locally:

```
  tox -e local-conda-forge-environment
  tox -e local-conda-forge-environment-optional
```

We also add them to the GH Actions workflow to ensure that the files `environment*.yml` are generated correctly.


See also:
- #30845, which adds tests for the files `SAGE_ROOT/src/environment*.yml`

Can't continue at the moment because miniforge3 on macOS seems broken at the moment

```
Miniforge3 will now be installed into this location:
/Users/mkoeppe/s/sage/sage-rebasing/worktree-algebraic-2018-spring/.tox/local-conda-forge-environment_yml/conda

  - Press ENTER to confirm the location
  - Press CTRL-C to abort the installation
  - Or specify a different location below

Figured out what was wrong: This was caused by having a `.condarc` that only defines `pkg_dirs` but no `channels`.

Great questions. I hope we can add the answers in #28746 (Developer's Guide: Add instructions for sagelib development in a conda environment)

The present ticket does not change anything in this regard. It only tests that environment.yml can be used to set up some environment in which the Sage distribution can be built and tested.

I thought the point of using tox in order to manage the conda was to make sure that locally a developer can easily work in a similar way to what is tested on the CI.

`conda env create environment.yml && sage -t` does not work -- it's missing the build of Sage between the two commands!

`tox -e local-conda-forge-environment` includes that -- and it does so in an isolated install tree (`SAGE_LOCAL`) under `.tox/`

Seems that building is done single-thread for some reason. I.e.

```
make --no-print-directory all-sage

is only using one core. Is it on purpose?

All of the `local` tox environments pass on the `MAKE` variable. If you want to build in parallel, use `export MAKE="make -j16"`.

On this ticket, the only change to the existing `tox -e local-conda-forge-standard` is that using the environment files is tested, instead of using `conda install PACKAGES....`
