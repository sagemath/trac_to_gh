We create `tox` environments `local-conda-forge-environment[-optional]`. 
In contrast to `...-standard` and `...-minimal`, they use the files `$SAGE_ROOT/environment*.yml` (generated by `bootstrap`) to set up the conda environment.

To test locally:

```
  tox -e local-conda-forge-environment
  tox -e local-conda-forge-environment-optional
```

We also add them to the GH Actions workflow to ensure that the files `environment*.yml` are generated correctly.

- #30845, which adds tests for the files `SAGE_ROOT/src/environment*.yml`

Figured out what was wrong: This was caused by having a `.condarc` that only defines `pkg_dirs` but no `channels`.

Great questions. I hope we can add the answers in #28746 (Developer's Guide: Add instructions for sagelib development in a conda environment)

The present ticket does not change anything in this regard. It only tests that environment.yml can be used to set up some environment in which the Sage distribution can be built and tested.

I thought the point of using tox in order to manage the conda was to make sure that locally a developer can easily work in a similar way to what is tested on the CI. These question arose because I have trouble understanding how this interplay now works. Ok, I can now run `tox -e local-conda-forge-environment` but what is the advantage of this over `conda env create environment.yml && sage -t` ?

That's right.

`conda env create environment.yml && sage -t` does not work -- it's missing the build of Sage between the two commands!

`tox -e local-conda-forge-environment` includes that -- and it does so in an isolated install tree (`SAGE_LOCAL`) under `.tox/`
