Currently `ClusterAlgebra.greedy_element` gives wrong answers when mixing initial and non-initial cluster variables.

The code in this ticket started as a fix to these issues and ended up in a retooling of the whole greedy and theta basis framework.

With the proposed changes the code should be able to compute (in rank 2) theta basis elements, F-polynomials, and decompose any element in terms of theta basis elements.
