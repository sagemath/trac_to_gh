(from #30371)


In order to compile the cython files only using system-wide installed libraries the following has to be done (on Ubunutu 20.04, under WSL):
- Install dependencies:
  `apt-get install liblinbox-dev libflint-arb-dev libhomfly-dev libgiac-dev libratpoints-dev libzn-poly-dev libbrial-dev libbrial-groebner-dev libatlas-base-dev`
- Configure ARB by setting env variable `ARB_LIBRARY` to `flint-arb`.

- Install `GAP`:
  This would be `apt-get install libgap-dev`, but this requires Ubuntu 20.10: https://packages.ubuntu.com/groovy/libgap-dev and the old gap-dev didn't worked for me. So download libgap-dev, libgap7 and gap-libs manually from https://packages.ubuntu.com/groovy, and install them using `sudo dpkg -i ./gap-libs_4.11.0-4_all.deb` etc and `sudo apt install -f`
- Fix installation of `ecl`:
  After `apt-get install ecl` ecl is broken under WSL. To fix this, first run `apt-get install libtool autoconf`, then follow https://github.com/rdp/ffmpeg-windows-build-helpers/issues/452#issuecomment-638639182.
  Maybe it would also work to build `ecl` directly from code: https://common-lisp.net/project/ecl/static/manual/Building-ECL.html#Building-ECL (which is also a newer version). I also had the problem that `ECL_WITH_LISP_FPE_BEGIN` was not defined (probably because the version of ecl that I used was too old so that https://gitlab.com/embeddable-common-lisp/ecl/-/merge_requests/154 was not included.)
- Install maxima:
  `apt-get install maxima-sage` and register with ecl using `sudo cp -f /usr/lib/ecl/maxima.fas /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ecl-16.1.3/maxima.fas`

- cysignals is broken, see https://github.com/sagemath/cysignals/issues/111. 
  To fix this, remove all method bodies in `python3.8/site-packages/cysignals/macros.h` (relative to the venv).
