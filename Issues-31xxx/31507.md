```
In Sage 9.2, after defining:

```
sage: G = AbelianGroup(2, gens_orders=[16, 16])
sage: f0, f1 = G.gens()
sage: H = G.subgroup ([f0*f1^3])
```
the following correctly determines non-membership:

```
sage: f0*f1^2 in H
False
```
but the following gives a type error:

```
sage: f0 in H
TypeError: no conversion of this rational to integer
```

The error seems to come from the `__contains__` method
of `src/sage/groups/abelian_gps/abelian_group.py`
(around line 1715), in particular the `if-else`
statements of lines 1740-1743.

From #32910:

Ok, I don't have a development version of sage yet. And I have trouble getting one. But here is some code I wrote that I used to monkey patch
`sage.groups.abelian_gps.abelian_group.AbelianGroup_subgroup.__contains__` and it seems to work like a charm for my application.

```
def __contains__(self, x):
    """
    Test whether ``x`` is an element of this subgroup.

    EXAMPLES::

        sage: G.<a,b> = AbelianGroup(2)
        sage: A = G.subgroup([a])
        sage: a in G
        True
        sage: a in A
        True

    TESTS:

    Check that :trac:`32910` is fixed::

        sage: Zmstar.<a,b> = AbelianGroup(2,[4,576])
        sage: Hgens =  [a**2,a*b**2]
        sage: H = Zmstar.subgroup(Hgens)
        sage: g = Zmstar.gen(1)**3
        sage: g in H
        True

    """
    amb_inv = self.ambient_group().gens_orders()
    inv_basis = diagonal_matrix(ZZ,amb_inv)
    gens_basis = matrix(
        ZZ, len(self._gens), len(amb_inv), [g.list() for g in self._gens]
    )
    return vector(ZZ, x.list()) in inv_basis.stack(gens_basis).row_module()

sage.groups.abelian_gps.abelian_group.AbelianGroup_subgroup.__contains__ = __contains__

Hi Dave,

Thanks for turning this into a git branch and making sure that the non algorithmic part of the code like the `is_instance` check are still there. And indeed you are right it should return False.

Is there a reason to do the imports inside of the function and not at the top of the file? Was there a problem with circular imports?

The following suggestions are to

- use Sage preparsing of `^` to `**` in doctests,
- use `b` rather than `Zmstar.gen(1)`,
- rename `Zmstar` to `G`,
- increase test density.

```diff
-            sage: Zmstar.<a,b> = AbelianGroup(2, [4, 576])
+            sage: G.<a,b> = AbelianGroup(2, [4, 576])
-            sage: Hgens =  [a**2,a*b**2]
+            sage: Hgens = [a^2, a*b^2]
-            sage: g = Zmstar.gen(1)**3
-            sage: g in H
-            False
-            sage: a^3*b^2 in H
-            True
+            sage: [g in H for g in (a^3, b^2, b^3, a^3*b^2)]
+            [False, False, False, True]
```

```diff
-            sage: f0*f1^2 in H
-            False
-            sage: f0 in H
-            False
+            sage: [g in H for g in (f0, f0*f1^2, f0*f1^3, f0*f1^4)]
+            [False, False, True, False]
```

Another cosmetic change I would make, but maybe my pep8 is off:

```diff
-            gens_basis = matrix(
-                ZZ, len(self._gens), len(amb_inv), [g.list() for g in self._gens]
-                )
+            gens_basis = matrix(ZZ, len(self._gens), len(amb_inv),
+                                [g.list() for g in self._gens])
```

I went for this simpler implementation because I had trouble understanding what the original code was trying to do. I am guessing that maybe the divisions had to be integer divisions `//`. And I also had the feeling that the original code was relying on the self._gens being in some sort of standard form so that the algorithm is able to reduce `x` to 1 if and only if x is in self. However as the code below shows, there is nothing guaranteeing that H._gens is in any sort of standard from. It is just what was passed during construction.

```
sage: Zmstar.<a,b> = AbelianGroup(2)   
....: Hgens =  [a**5*b, a**3, a*b, b**7]   
....: H = Zmstar.subgroup(Hgens)  
....: H._gens                                                                                      
(a^5*b, a^3, a*b, b^7)
```

The following piece of code show a more subtle (i.e. not even raising an error) way that the old code can fail.

```
sage: G.<a,b> = AbelianGroup(2)   
....: Hgens =  [a*b, a*b^-1]   
....: H = G.subgroup(Hgens)  
....: b**2 in H

I also broke two lines that were more than 80 characters, and added a check for whether "junk" is in H in the first test, because the method should not choke on stupid input.
