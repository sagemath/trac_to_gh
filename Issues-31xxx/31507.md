In Sage 9.2, after defining:

```
sage: G = AbelianGroup(2, gens_orders=[16, 16])
sage: f0, f1 = G.gens()
sage: H = G.subgroup ([f0*f1^3])
```
the following correctly determines non-membership:

```
sage: f0*f1^2 in H
False
```
but the following gives a type error:

```
sage: f0 in H
TypeError: no conversion of this rational to integer
```

The error seems to come from the `__contains__` method
of `src/sage/groups/abelian_gps/abelian_group.py`
(around line 1715), in particular the `if-else`
statements of lines 1740-1743.

From #32910:

Ok, I don't have a development version of sage yet. And I have trouble getting one. But here is some code I wrote that I used to monkey patch
`sage.groups.abelian_gps.abelian_group.AbelianGroup_subgroup.__contains__` and it seems to work like a charm for my application.

```
def __contains__(self, x):
    """
    Test whether ``x`` is an element of this subgroup.

    EXAMPLES::

        sage: G.<a,b> = AbelianGroup(2)
        sage: A = G.subgroup([a])
        sage: a in G
        True
        sage: a in A
        True

    TESTS:

    Check that :trac:`32910` is fixed::

        sage: Zmstar.<a,b> = AbelianGroup(2,[4,576])
        sage: Hgens =  [a**2,a*b**2]
        sage: H = Zmstar.subgroup(Hgens)
        sage: g = Zmstar.gen(1)**3
        sage: g in H
        True

    """
    amb_inv = self.ambient_group().gens_orders()
    inv_basis = diagonal_matrix(ZZ,amb_inv)
    gens_basis = matrix(
        ZZ, len(self._gens), len(amb_inv), [g.list() for g in self._gens]
    )
    return vector(ZZ, x.list()) in inv_basis.stack(gens_basis).row_module()

sage.groups.abelian_gps.abelian_group.AbelianGroup_subgroup.__contains__ = __contains__

Hi Dave,

Thanks for turning this into a git branch and making sure that the non algorithmic part of the code like the `is_instance` check are still there. And indeed you are right it should return False.

Is there a reason to do the imports inside of the function and not at the top of the file? Was there a problem with circular imports?

The following suggestions are to

- use Sage preparsing of `^` to `**` in doctests,
- use `b` rather than `Zmstar.gen(1)`,
- rename `Zmstar` to `G`,
- increase test density.

```diff
-            sage: Zmstar.<a,b> = AbelianGroup(2, [4, 576])
+            sage: G.<a,b> = AbelianGroup(2, [4, 576])
-            sage: Hgens =  [a**2,a*b**2]
+            sage: Hgens = [a^2, a*b^2]
-            sage: g = Zmstar.gen(1)**3
-            sage: g in H
-            False
-            sage: a^3*b^2 in H
-            True
+            sage: [g in H for g in (a^3, b^2, b^3, a^3*b^2)]
+            [False, False, False, True]
```

```diff
-            sage: f0*f1^2 in H
-            False
-            sage: f0 in H
-            False
+            sage: [g in H for g in (f0, f0*f1^2, f0*f1^3, f0*f1^4)]
+            [False, False, True, False]
```

Another cosmetic change I would make, but maybe my pep8 is off:

```diff
-            gens_basis = matrix(
-                ZZ, len(self._gens), len(amb_inv), [g.list() for g in self._gens]
-                )
+            gens_basis = matrix(ZZ, len(self._gens), len(amb_inv),
+                                [g.list() for g in self._gens])
```

Feel free to ignore these minor comments.

I went for this simpler implementation because I had trouble understanding what the original code was trying to do. I am guessing that maybe the divisions had to be integer divisions `//`. And I also had the feeling that the original code was relying on the self._gens being in some sort of standard form so that the algorithm is able to reduce `x` to 1 if and only if x is in self. However as the code below shows, there is nothing guaranteeing that H._gens is in any sort of standard from. It is just what was passed during construction.

```
sage: Zmstar.<a,b> = AbelianGroup(2)   
....: Hgens =  [a**5*b, a**3, a*b, b**7]   
....: H = Zmstar.subgroup(Hgens)  
....: H._gens                                                                                      
(a^5*b, a^3, a*b, b^7)
```

The following piece of code show a more subtle (i.e. not even raising an error) way that the old code can fail.

```
sage: G.<a,b> = AbelianGroup(2)   
....: Hgens =  [a*b, a*b^-1]   
....: H = G.subgroup(Hgens)  
....: b**2 in H                                                                 
False
sage: H.gen(0)/H.gen(1)==b**2

I think this update implements all of the suggestions.

I also broke two lines that were more than 80 characters, and added a check for whether "junk" is in H in the first test, because the method should not choke on stupid input.

And I added the last example of[comment:9](#comment%3A9) as another test. I think that example is very strong evidence that this ticket takes the right approach by getting rid of code duplication.

I apologize for the python style errors -- I am not fluent.  PEP8 says "Imports are always put at the top of the file..." so I moved them there.  It also says "The closing brace/bracket/parenthesis on multi-line constructs may either line up under the first non-whitespace character of the last line of list ... or it may be lined up under the first character of the line that starts the multi-line construct ...". So (regarding[comment:10](#comment%3A10)) I left the closing parenthesis on its own line (but reduced the indent to match the author's original code that black liked).

Further comments or corrections (or corrections to my implementations of the corrections) are welcome, of course.  If there aren't any, and the patchbot comes back green again, then I think we are done.
