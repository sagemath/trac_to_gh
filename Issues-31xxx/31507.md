In Sage 9.2, after defining:

```
sage: G = AbelianGroup(2, gens_orders=[16, 16])
sage: f0, f1 = G.gens()
sage: H = G.subgroup ([f0*f1^3])
```
the following correctly determines non-membership:

```
sage: f0*f1^2 in H
False
```
but the following gives a type error:

```
sage: f0 in H
TypeError: no conversion of this rational to integer
```

The error seems to come from the `__contains__` method
of `src/sage/groups/abelian_gps/abelian_group.py`
(around line 1715), in particular the `if-else`
statements of lines 1740-1743.

Ok, I don't have a development version of sage yet. And I have trouble getting one. But here is some code I wrote that I used to monkey patch
`sage.groups.abelian_gps.abelian_group.AbelianGroup_subgroup.__contains__` and it seems to work like a charm for my application.

```
def __contains__(self, x):
    """
    Test whether ``x`` is an element of this subgroup.

    EXAMPLES::

        sage: G.<a,b> = AbelianGroup(2)
        sage: A = G.subgroup([a])
        sage: a in G
        True
        sage: a in A
        True

    TESTS:

    Check that :trac:`32910` is fixed::

        sage: Zmstar.<a,b> = AbelianGroup(2,[4,576])
        sage: Hgens =  [a**2,a*b**2]

<a id='comment:7'></a>Hi Dave,

Thanks for turning this into a git branch and making sure that the non algorithmic part of the code like the `is_instance` check are still there. And indeed you are right it should return False.

Is there a reason to do the imports inside of the function and not at the top of the file? Was there a problem with circular imports?

<a id='comment:8'></a>The following suggestions are to

- use Sage preparsing of `^` to `**` in doctests,
- use `b` rather than `Zmstar.gen(1)`,
- rename `Zmstar` to `G`,
- increase test density.

```diff
-            sage: Zmstar.<a,b> = AbelianGroup(2, [4, 576])
+            sage: G.<a,b> = AbelianGroup(2, [4, 576])
-            sage: Hgens =  [a**2,a*b**2]
+            sage: Hgens = [a^2, a*b^2]
-            sage: g = Zmstar.gen(1)**3
-            sage: g in H
-            False
-            sage: a^3*b^2 in H
-            True
+            sage: [g in H for g in (a^3, b^2, b^3, a^3*b^2)]
+            [False, False, False, True]
```

```diff
-            sage: f0*f1^2 in H
-            False
-            sage: f0 in H
-            False
+            sage: [g in H for g in (f0, f0*f1^2, f0*f1^3, f0*f1^4)]
+            [False, False, True, False]
```

Another cosmetic change I would make, but maybe my pep8 is off:

```diff
-            gens_basis = matrix(
-                ZZ, len(self._gens), len(amb_inv), [g.list() for g in self._gens]
-                )
+            gens_basis = matrix(ZZ, len(self._gens), len(amb_inv),
+                                [g.list() for g in self._gens])
```

(a^5*b, a^3, a*b, b^7)
```

The following piece of code show a more subtle (i.e. not even raising an error) way that the old code can fail.

```
sage: G.<a,b> = AbelianGroup(2)   
....: Hgens =  [a*b, a*b^-1]   
....: H = G.subgroup(Hgens)  
....: b**2 in H                                                                 
False
sage: H.gen(0)/H.gen(1)==b**2                                                   
True
```

I actually let my code be formatted by black whose output is guaranteed to be pep8 compatible. And black proposed the above linebreak so at least the original is pep8 compatible. Although black does put the closing parenthesis unindented.

<a id='comment:13'></a>I think this update implements all of the suggestions.

I also broke two lines that were more than 80 characters, and added a check for whether "junk" is in H in the first test, because the method should not choke on stupid input.

And I added the last example of comment:9 as another test. I think that example is very strong evidence that this ticket takes the right approach by getting rid of code duplication.

I apologize for the python style errors -- I am not fluent.  PEP8 says "Imports are always put at the top of the file..." so I moved them there.  It also says "The closing brace/bracket/parenthesis on multi-line constructs may either line up under the first non-whitespace character of the last line of list ... or it may be lined up under the first character of the line that starts the multi-line construct ...". So (regarding comment:10) I left the closing parenthesis on its own line (but reduced the indent to match the author's original code that black liked).

Further comments or corrections (or corrections to my implementations of the corrections) are welcome, of course.  If there aren't any, and the patchbot comes back green again, then I think we are done.
