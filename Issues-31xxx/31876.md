You are right, but actually the example itself is fishy since the variable of the Laplace transform (`a` in this case) already appears in the function being transformed.  I would suggest simplifying the example as follows (also fixing whitespace):

This already succeeds with the current Maxima version.

Apart from that, it would be nice to have a doctest in `src/sage/calculus/calculus.py` showing that taking the inverse Laplace transform of a constant now returns a delta function.
