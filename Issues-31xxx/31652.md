<div id="comment:1" align="right">comment:1</div>

I think the bad output is coming from `repr_lincomb`:

```
sage: repr_lincomb([[x + 1, 2]])
'2*x + 1'
```
This function is only documented to "Compute a string representation of a linear combination of some formal symbols." It does not work correctly for linear combinations of more complicated expressions, because it does not insert any parentheses.
