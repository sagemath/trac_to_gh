The issue reported in https://groups.google.com/g/sage-release/c/fXpbYwaqt9o/m/929SlEXcCAAJ is likely caused by the upgrade to singular (#25993) from 4.1.1p2 to 4.2.0p1.
Upstream singular introduced some rather unfortunate linker flags in 4.1.3 or earlier.

We fix it by a number of PRs to the singular build system. The new snapshot release is made from the current singular `spielwiese` HEAD, which has merged the PRs. There are a number of other change since the last snapshot release built in #31552, which seem to be bugfixes.

It would have been nice for `gmp-check.m4` to follow that model. That would also prevent `/usr/lib` and `/usr/local/lib` to ever end up in a `rpath` unless you explicitly pass it as a path to be checked.

All of the above PRs have been merged by upstream.

I have made another PR, https://github.com/Singular/Singular/pull/1081, just with minor fixes to the Singular docbuild so the process of making a release is simpler: `autoreconf -fi && ./configure --disable-pyobject-module --enable-doc-build && make && make dist`
