The issue reported in https://groups.google.com/g/sage-release/c/fXpbYwaqt9o/m/929SlEXcCAAJ is likely caused by the upgrade to singular (#25993) from 4.1.1p2 to 4.2.0p1.
Upstream singular introduced some rather unfortunate linker flags in 4.1.3 or earlier.

We fix it by a number of PRs to the singular build system. The new snapshot release is made from the current singular `spielwiese` HEAD, which has merged the PRs. There are a number of other change since the last snapshot release built in #31552, which seem to be bugfixes.

Previous tickets: #25993, #31552
