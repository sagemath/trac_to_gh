The issue reported in https://groups.google.com/g/sage-release/c/fXpbYwaqt9o/m/929SlEXcCAAJ is likely caused by the upgrade to singular (#25993) from 4.1.1p2 to 4.2.0p1.
Upstream singular introduced some rather unfortunate linker flags in 4.1.3 or earlier.

We fix it by a number of PRs to the singular build system. The new snapshot release is made from the current singular `spielwiese` HEAD, which has merged the PRs. There are a number of other change since the last snapshot release built in #31552, which seem to be bugfixes.

Previous tickets: #25993, #31552

<a id='comment:18'>Comment 18:</a>
All of the above PRs have been merged by upstream.

I have made another PR, https://github.com/Singular/Singular/pull/1081, just with minor fixes to the Singular docbuild so the process of making a release is simpler: `autoreconf -fi && ./configure --disable-pyobject-module --enable-doc-build && make && make dist`

New release for sage at https://github.com/mkoeppe/Singular/releases/tag/singular-4.2.0p1%2B2021-04-06%2Bsage
