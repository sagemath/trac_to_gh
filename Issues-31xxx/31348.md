Currently `gmp.pc`, which may be provided at least on some platforms, is not used at all -- neither by `configure` nor by `sage.env.cython_aliases`, `sage.misc.cython`.

For example, on homebrew, using it will provide the specific library search directory `-L/usr/local/Cellar/gmp/6.2.1/lib` instead of having to rely on `/usr/local/` (which is disabled when compiler/linker are invoked with `-isysroot`)

Currently, `gmp` is detected using `AC_CHECK_HEADER`, and the result is communicated to `sage-build-env-config` as variables `SAGE_GMP_PREFIX` and `SAGE_GMP_INCLUDE`; but it is not available in the runtime environment (`sage_conf.py`, `sage-env-config`).

- https://groups.google.com/g/sage-release/c/0q3kywk7RP8/m/uspq0xeuAgAJ
can be fixed by simply changing `sage.misc.cython` to pick up `gmp.pc`.  But to avoid unpleasant surprises, we need to make sure that it is used consistently when present.

(After #32549, the relevant file is `build/pkgs/gmp/spkg-configure.m4`.)

The above applies to `mpfr` as well. See failure report in https://groups.google.com/g/sage-release/c/8ctwsUGl6LQ/m/Ob38Iyh1AAAJ

Similar situation with `readline` (#29000): The spkg-configure script already uses pkg-config - but forgets to tell the build system what it found.

For NTL, the configure script already determines `SAGE_NTL_PREFIX`.
This variable just needs to be used more.

No, brew does not install mpir in gmp-compatible mode, as far as
I can tell from reading https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/HEAD/Formula/mpir.rb
