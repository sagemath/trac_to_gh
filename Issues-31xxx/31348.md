Currently `gmp.pc`, which may be provided at least on some platforms, is not used at all -- neither by `configure` nor by `sage.env.cython_aliases`, `sage.misc.cython`.

For example, on homebrew, using it will provide the specific library search directory `-L/usr/local/Cellar/gmp/6.2.1/lib` instead of having to rely on `/usr/local/` (which is disabled when compiler/linker are invoked with `-isysroot`)

Currently, `gmp` is detected using `AC_CHECK_HEADER`, and the result is communicated to `sage-build-env-config` as variables `SAGE_GMP_PREFIX` and `SAGE_GMP_INCLUDE`; but it is not available in the runtime environment (`sage_conf.py`, `sage-env-config`).

- https://groups.google.com/g/sage-release/c/0q3kywk7RP8/m/uspq0xeuAgAJ
can be fixed by simply changing `sage.misc.cython` to pick up `gmp.pc`.  But to avoid unpleasant surprises, we need to make sure that it is used consistently when present.

(After #32549, the relevant file is `build/pkgs/gmp/spkg-configure.m4`.)

The above applies to `mpfr` as well. See failure report in https://groups.google.com/g/sage-release/c/8ctwsUGl6LQ/m/Ob38Iyh1AAAJ

Similar situation with `readline` (#29000): The spkg-configure script already uses pkg-config - but forgets to tell the build system what it found.

I started to play around with this a bit, and I can use python’s pkgconfig to locate gmp and mpfr.  After doing that though, I get complaints about not being able to locagte -lntl, which I don’t think I can find with pkgconfig since it doesn’t have an ntl.pc file.

This may be a bit too hacky, but would it be possible in the build process to copy the various includes and libraries to SAGE_LOCAL/{include, lib} that are picked up by configure? That seems like it would solve a whole host of problems at the expense of if the user updates one of those libraries then the new version would not be picked up.

For NTL, the configure script already determines `SAGE_NTL_PREFIX`.
This variable just needs to be used more.
