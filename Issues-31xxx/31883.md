A `ScalarField` on a topological manifold is supposed to be a continuous map -- but this is not reflected by the category of its parent.

```
sage: M = Manifold(2, 'R^2', structure='topological')
sage: c_cart.<x,y> = M.chart()
sage: r_squared = M.scalar_field(x^2+y^2)
sage: r_squared.parent().category()
Category of commutative algebras over Symbolic Ring
sage: r_squared.codomain()
AttributeError: 'ScalarFieldAlgebra_with_category.element_class' object has no attribute 'codomain'
```

Meanwhile, we have\n\n```\nsage: M = Manifold(2, 'M')\nsage: CM = M.scalar_field_algebra()\nsage: M.base_field()\nReal Field with 53 bits of precision\nsage: CM.base_ring()\nSymbolic Ring\n```\nWith the `codomain()` method introduced in this ticket, we have in addition\n\n```\nsage: X.<x,y> = M.chart() \nsage: f = M.scalar_field(x^2)\nsage: f.codomain() is f.domain().base_field()\nTrue\n```\nwhich is nice, but\n\n```\nsage: f.codomain() is f.parent().base_ring()\nFalse\n```\nMoreover, for images of scalar fields, we have\n\n```\nsage: p = M((pi, 0))\nsage: f(p)\npi^2\nsage: f(p) in f.codomain()\nTrue\n```\nbut this holds only because `pi^2` can be converted to an element of `RR`. Otherwise, the test fails:\n\n```\nsage: a = var('a', domain='real')\nsage: p = M((a, 0))\nsage: f(p) in f.codomain()\nFalse\n```\n`f(p)` not lying in `f.codomain()` is certainly something we do not want, but this is currently a consequence of the inconsistency 1 <-> 2 mentioned above. The latter could be removed by making `SR` the base field of manifolds. But then a real manifold and a complex one would appear as having the same base field (according to `base_field()`). \n\nFinally, it's worth to stress that in practice, the inconsistency 1 <-> 2 is a rather mild one: to my knowledge, it has never triggered any error nor yield any false result in actual computations on manifolds (apart from the trivial `CM.base_ring() is M.base_field()` being false).",

I agree with the code added in this ticket, but let me seize the opportunity to point out some current inconsistency in the manifold set up, which is due to the lack of a proper real field in Sage (cf. #24456):
1. the base field of a real manifold is `RR`
2. the base ring of the algebra of scalar fields on a manifold is `SR` 

Of course, from a pure mathematical side, 1 and 2 should be identical. 

The basic reason for 1 is `RR` being the simplest proxy for the genuine real field, albeit all (symbolic) computations on manifolds have nothing to do with 53 bits of precision...

The basic reason for 2 is to naturally allow for algebra operations like `a*f`, where `a` is a symbolic variable and `f` a scalar field.

If #24456 converges some day, both 1 and 2 should be set to the real field object that will emerge from it. Meanwhile, we have

```
sage: M = Manifold(2, 'M')
sage: CM = M.scalar_field_algebra()
sage: M.base_field()
Real Field with 53 bits of precision
sage: CM.base_ring()
Symbolic Ring
```
With the `codomain()` method introduced in this ticket, we have in addition

```
sage: X.<x,y> = M.chart() 
sage: f = M.scalar_field(x^2)
sage: f.codomain() is f.domain().base_field()
True
```
which is nice, but

```
sage: f.codomain() is f.parent().base_ring()
False
```
Moreover, for images of scalar fields, we have

```
sage: p = M((pi, 0))
sage: f(p)
pi^2
sage: f(p) in f.codomain()
True
```
but this holds only because `pi^2` can be converted to an element of `RR`. Otherwise, the test fails:

```
sage: a = var('a', domain='real')
sage: p = M((a, 0))
sage: f(p) in f.codomain()
False
```
`f(p)` not lying in `f.codomain()` is certainly something we do not want, but this is currently a consequence of the inconsistency 1 <-> 2 mentioned above. The latter could be removed by making `SR` the base field of manifolds. But then a real manifold and a complex one would appear as having the same base field (according to `base_field()`). 

Finally, it's worth to stress that in practice, the inconsistency 1 <-> 2 is a rather mild one: to my knowledge, it has never triggered any error nor yield any false result in actual computations on manifolds (apart from the trivial `CM.base_ring() is M.base_field()` being false).
