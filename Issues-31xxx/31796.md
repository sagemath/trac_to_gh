(See also this `sage-devel` [post](https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/U_WGbYG2zOE/m/gO3tZyVEAwAJ).)

Currently, all whitespace is stripped off `maxima(x)` and `maxima_calculus(x)` where `x` is a string. The same goes for Maxima code defined via the interfaces. To illustrate :

```
r1=maxima_calculus('foo: a and (b or c)')
r2=maxima_calculus('untree(x) := append([part(x, 0)], maplist(lambda([u], if atom(u) then u else untree(u)), x))')
r3=maxima_calculus('untree(foo)')
(r1, r2, r3)
```
outputs :

```
(aand(borc),
 untree(x):=append([part(x,0)],maplist(lambda([u],ifatom(u)thenuelseuntree(u)),x)),
 [\"and\",a,[\"or\",b,c]])
```

This also deminstrates that the Maxima interpretation of the first instruction is correct ; it is its output which is ill-interpreted by Sage...

In order to maintain the `print(eval(read(x))==x` equality, it is desirable to keep spaces at least around boolean operators.

If I recall correctly, there were problems with maxima inserting spaces at unpredictable places every now and again; even in the middle of identifiers! The original commits would have been for maxima on CLISP rather than on ECL (although I recall the whitespace problem occurring on ECL (too?)). It could be that with the different iterations of "expect" -- and almost certainly in maxima_lib -- this isn't a problem anymore, but it means you'll have to test a *lot* in order to make really sure that a very old problem doesn't inadvertently comes back.

Also note that maxima_lib and maxima each have their own `_eval_line_` which does the stripping, so to keep the two interfaces in step, you'd want to change it in both.

This still happens, at least for MaximaElement pieces. To be explored in a followup ticket (but I'm afraid that this one is in Maxima's territory...). I've installed a workaround for this in `assumptions.py`

> even in the middle of identifiers!


This I didn't see (yet).

> The original commits would have been for maxima on CLISP rather than on ECL (although I recall the whitespace problem occurring on ECL (too?)). It could be that with the different iterations of "expect" -- and almost certainly in maxima_lib -- this isn't a problem anymore, but it means you'll have to test a *lot* in order to make really sure that a very old problem doesn't inadvertently comes back.


Advice gladly accepted for filing and solving a followup ticket, or to better test the proposed solution.

For the latter : what would you think of generating random SR expressions, translate them to Maxima strings, and check back-and-forth translations ? ISTR that such a random expression generator exists somewhere in Sage but, for the life of me, I'm unable to recall //where// I saw this...

> Also note that maxima_lib and maxima each have their own `_eval_line_` which does the stripping,


In different ways ==> two different fixes. No possible code sharing here without //major// restructuration.


> so to keep the two interfaces in step, you'd want to change it in both.


Done. You're welcome to review my branch, which passes `ptestlong` with exactly the same errors as `develop` at `9.3.rc5` (and therefore `needs_review`). And delivers parseable output for Maxima strings containing logical operators. Yay !

Indeed : neither `DOT_SAGE` nor `SAGE_LOCAL` appear anywhere in this file but on line 487, where they are imported from `sage.env`.

Residues of code past ?

This one is right, but seems harmless. Was in the original code.

This one is hard to check. After hunting all capital `I` in the file :
* In live code, I find an import of I in `AlgebraicConverter.arithmetic`, line 1112 (as announced by `pyflakes`). 
* All the other uses are in examples/tests.

Past code residues, again ?

I'm interested, too.

But I can also make a new commit including the changes suggested by `pyflakes` (as well as deleting the "trailing whitespace" `relint` complains about so insistently, but not the semicolon uses `pycodestyle` hates...).

Advice ?
