On `cygwin-standard` (https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/2000089431?check_suite_focus=true)

```
Setting up build directory for argon2_cffi-20.1.0
...
    ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement pycparser
    ERROR: No matching distribution found for pycparser
```

This is actually an install-requires of `cffi`, which comes in because `argon2-cffi` is a PEP-517 package.

We also update cffi to the latest version, from 1.14.4 to 1.14.5.
