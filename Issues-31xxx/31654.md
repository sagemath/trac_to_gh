<a id='comment:20'></a>In both `tensorfield.py` and `scalarfield.py`, maybe change

```diff
-        Make ``self`` to a copy of ``other``.
+        Make ``self`` a copy of ``other``.
```

Maybe rephrase this:

```diff
-        - ``other`` -- other scalar field in the very same module from which
-          ``self`` should be a copy of
+        - ``other`` -- other scalar field, in the same module as ``self``
```

Maybe remove the + sign here?

```diff
             raise TypeError("the original must be an element "
-                            + "of {}".format(self.parent()))
+                            "of {}".format(self.parent()))
