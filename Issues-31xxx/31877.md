Then a forgetful functor would also make more sense.

A `RealSet` instance is a union of finitely many (possibly degenerate) intervals, so it is always a topological subspace of the real line, but not always a manifold. It would belong to the category of manifolds with corners of mixed dimension, but I think it's a long way until we have implemented that.

Just because it comes with a natural topology doesn't mean it is the topology the user wants.

If you argument like that, every set must be seen in the category of topological spaces, because every set is endowed with a topology.

But I agree, for structures like rings, groups etc. this approach makes total sense. Though, I still don't understand why `ForgetfulFunctor` was introduced in the first place.

But for manifolds, things are slightly different. It would be good to have a functor that forgets about the topological structure, for example to impose another one. Like I said, I don't like the idea of enforcing a preferred topology on a set if we see it just as set (what we clearly do with `RealSet` as the name indicates).

`RealSet` provides constructors for certain subsets of the reals. The "set" of real numbers comes with a distinguished topology, which is reflected by the names of the `RealSet` constructors for intervals such as `open`, `closed`. 

In #31881 (`RealSet`: Extend constructors so that they can build manifold objects) I plan to add a `category` keyword argument. Then also the rather specialized use case that a subset of the real numbers is to be treated merely as a set can be achieved by passing `category=Sets()` to the constructors.

Good point!
