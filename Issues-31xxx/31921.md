Ticket #30352 included a new optional database and its interface in sage. As all new optional package of this kind, whether to use it or not is detected at runtime by the feature framework.

In #30352 presence was implemented by looking if the sage interface python module is installed. Which is always true since this interface is shipped in the standard sagelib. Instead it should have searched for the module installed by the `database_knotinfo` package itself.

Furthermore, it sets user writable cache under `SAGE_SHARE` which is a system location for any system wide installation of sage. 

The problem is not clearly visible in vanilla sage as there are no direct consequence for a private user installation. But for system installation or distro installation which are sandboxed, there are consequences as sage will try to create files in system location.
See https://github.com/cschwan/sage-on-gentoo/issues/639 for example.

I understand, the wrong python module was looked up. Of course you cannot know that without installing the package or reading the ticket very, very, carefully.

There are more files, so that should be a separate folder.

Sorry for causing this trouble. I already had `SAGE_DB` (`.sage/db`) in mind instead of `SAGE_SHARE` when I did the last change in #30352. But since everything worked fine for me I let it as is.

I can do the tests but maybe not today!
