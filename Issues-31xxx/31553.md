<div id="comment:0"></div>

Our maxima SPKG requires(?) a custom patch called `undoing_true_false_printing_patch.patch` that reverts this upstream commit:

https://sourceforge.net/p/maxima/code/ci/f5e9b0f7eb122c4e48ea9df144dd57221e5ea0ca

Our patch was introduced in sage commit 91990e962b to ease the upgrade to maxima-5.29.1. Since upstream has no plans to revert that commit (and distros won't either), we'll have to work around it before we can use maxima from the system.

I'm not getting too far with this, but the problem lies somewhere between when the `retrieve` function receives its `msg` argument in `interfaces/maxima_lib.py` and when it is printed to the console. The `msg` we receive is

```
((MTEXT) Is  $_SAGE_VAR_a  an  EVEN   NUMBER ?)
```

but when printed out it looks like

```
Is _SAGE_VAR_a an even\ number?
```

Our copy of `retrieve` is out-of-date, but the upstream one has the same issue. I tried setting the global value of `linel` to `1000` in case it was a word-wrap issue in one of the display functions, but no luck there.

That sounds reasonable to me, but it's more work than I was prepared to bite off. While monkey-patching is terrible, it's no worse than patch-patching, so I don't think this makes the situation worse than it was.

Yeah, I know. But at least Gentoo, Conda, and Nix all ship the same patch, and maxima upstream might be willing to add it as a new `./configure` option if we ask nicely. The `spkg-configure.m4` for maxima would check that the system copy was usable in any case, so while we may not be able to use the system copy everywhere, being able to use it on Gentoo, Conda, Nix, etc. would be an improvement.

If maxima upstream strongly rejects the idea, then in the long term, I think we should revert back to a supported interface (but expect lots of disagreement on that) rather than require a custom patched maxima on most systems for the rest of eternity.

> I hope that a sage install that uses the system ECL without write permission on the system ECL library can somehow adapt ECLs search paths to also look in a location that sits in the sage tree

We already support system ECL and this works because you can point ECL to the maxima library directly if you've just installed the maxima SPKG and know where it lives.

Upstream ticket for this: https://sourceforge.net/p/maxima/patches/80/

I think reverting maxima to a "supported" interface is a no-go. Then we should move to sympy or something else as default back-end for "hard calculus". The only "supported" way of communicating with maxima would be through an expect interface. These are fragile and also need constant care; I expect much more than this little element: this is the first time this one plays up in the roughly 10 years we've had maxima_lib. That's a pretty good score. Remember that maxima is a very old, very mature project.

The reality is that probably any other project would require *more* work to stay up-to-date with. If that project would provide more/better/more stable functionality that would be worth it.

It definitely needs to be *possible* for sage to have specific components: we'll need them in the future as projects go defunct or undergo drastic redesigns that make the new version unusable for our purposes. It's nice if we can use system-provided resources if they are compatible, but there is a reason why sage originally bundled everything: it's very hard to coordinate compatible versions of prerequisites if you don't have the capability of building them yourself if need be.

OK, I think I found what the problem really is. If I capture what `msg` is actually passed to `retrieve` (that is to say: I monkey-patch retrieve to store the message in a global variable), I get:

```
sage: ecl_eval("*RET_MSG*") 
<ECL: ((MTEXT) "Is " |$_SAGE_VAR_a| " an " EVEN | | NUMBER "?")>
```
The vertical bars note the enclosed string is actually the name of a *symbol*, not a string. So it passes the space as a *symbol*. And apparently when this gets processed by maxima and sent to a string-backed stream rather than STDOUT, this gets rendered as "\ " rather than " ". There may be fancier options, but as long as this is the only problem we have, a plain work-around is to manually replace space symbols by strings before processing. Updated "retrieve":

```
ecl_eval(r"""
(defun retrieve (msg flag &aux (print? nil))
  (declare (special msg flag print?))
  (setq msg (mapcar #'(lambda (x) (if (eq x '| |) " " x)) msg))
  (or (eq flag 'noprint) (setq print? t))
  (error
      (concatenate 'string "Maxima asks: "
      (string-trim '(#\Newline)
      (with-output-to-string (*standard-output*)
      (cond ((not print?)
         (setq print? t)
             (format-prompt t ""))
        ((null msg)
             (format-prompt t ""))
        ((atom msg)
             (format-prompt t "~A" msg)
         (mterpri))
        ((eq flag t)
             (format-prompt t "~{~A~}" (cdr msg))
         (mterpri))
        (t
             (format-prompt t "~M" msg)
         (mterpri))
      ))))
  )
)
""")
```
This should work with an unpatched `msize-mtext`.

*FOR POSTERITY*

To help people hack ecl/maxima from sage/python in the future: The key to capturing the message was to do a

```
ecl_eval(r"""(defvar *RET_MSG* NIL)""")
```
and then stuff the following somewhere at the start of `retrieve`:

```
(setq *RET_MSG* msg)
```
This can all be done interactively from the sage prompt by a judicious use of `ecl_eval` statements, because LISP is just about as dynamic as PYTHON is. For posterity, the command sequence to get the offending error message:

```
var('x,a')
assume(a>0)
assume(a,'integer')
limit(x^(a),x=0)
```

It's good to get rid of that particular patch. What is happening with the "other" patch, namely `matrixexp.patch`? Is there a ticket for it that escaped my attention?

I don't think I opened a ticket. I did investigate a bit, and found the upstream bug:

https://sourceforge.net/p/maxima/bugs/2596/

The patch was introduced in #13973 to fix a failing doctest. There is apparently a workaround within maxima by enabling "ratmx" for the exponentiation, but I don't think there's a sage interface for that. We could always mark the doctest `# known bug` and link to the upstream issue.

I opened #32898 so that removing `matrixexp.patch`
has its own ticket.
