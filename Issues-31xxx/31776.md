In order to be usable outside of sage, we make the deprecation functions in `sage.misc.superseded` more flexible. The aim is to be able to use them outside of sage. In particular, it should be possible to reference something else than a trac ticket (eg gitlab merge request, github pull request, etc). See [https://gitlab.com/jo314schmitt/admcycles/-/blob/master/admcycles/superseded.py admcycles/superseded.py](https://gitlab.com/jo314schmitt/admcycles/-/blob/master/admcycles/superseded.py admcycles/superseded.py) for an example where a lot of duplications could have been avoided.
