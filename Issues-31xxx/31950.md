If I understand correctly, the matrix is upper triangular with 1s on the diagonal.
We could therefore either just take the det of a submatrix, or use a triangular-matrix inversion algorithm (not available, as far as I know).

Probably doing the single det is faster as we won't have any specialized triangular inversion code for a while is my guess.
