For the gcd, is it that the dimension vector has a common gcd of 1 or that pairwise the values are coprime? For example, is the dimension vector `[2, 3, 4]` allowed? If so, please add this as a doctest.

Because `cardinal_RG` is called in a tight loop, I think it would make sense to also factor out the `self.digraph().edges(labels=False)` call.

Since you only want one entry of the inverse, wouldn't it be faster to use Cramer's rule?

Thanks, Travis.

If I understand correctly, the matrix is upper triangular with 1s on the diagonal.
We could therefore either just take the det of a submatrix, or use a triangular-matrix inversion algorithm (not available, as far as I know).

Thank you.

Probably doing the single det is faster as we won't have any specialized triangular inversion code for a while is my guess.

If the bot comes back green, positive review.

Thanks again for your many reviews, Travis. If I can help back, do no hesitate to ask.

P.S. Concerning the tickets that are not merged since months, I think that their "minor" priority plays a role in the problem.
