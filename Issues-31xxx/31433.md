Define an elliptic curve, find its discriminant
and its number of real components:

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve([0, -1, 1, 0, 0])
sage: E.discriminant()
-11
sage: E.real_components()
1
```
The number of real components is 1 or 2 when the discriminant is negative or positive respectively.  The current code does a lot of unnecessary work:

```
        invs = self.short_weierstrass_model().ainvs()
        x = rings.polygen(self.base_ring())
        f = x**3 + invs[3]*x + invs[4]
        if f.discriminant() > 0:
            return 2
        else:
            return 1
```
It is unnecessary to compute a short Weierstrass model, take its coefficients, construct a polynomial, and compute its discriminant, since `E.discriminant()` has the same sign as the discriminant computed here.

As well as fixing this we add a `real_components()` method for elliptic curves over number fields, which takes as a parameter a real embedding of the base field.
