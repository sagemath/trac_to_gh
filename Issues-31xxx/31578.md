There is no such problem with `9.3.beta7`.

For `9.3.rc0`, `sage_conf.py` contains

```
# build/pkgs/sage_conf/src/sage_conf.py.  Generated from sage_conf.py.in by configure.

VERSION = "9.3.rc0"

MAXIMA = "/local/sage-git/sage/local/bin/maxima"

ARB_LIBRARY = "arb"

NTL_INCDIR = "///usr/include"
NTL_LIBDIR = "///usr/lib" 
```

So the question is whether the `///` are causing the linker warnings when doctesting?

Correct me if I misunderstand. For `9.3.rc0` I changed

```
NTL_INCDIR = "///usr/include"
NTL_LIBDIR = "///usr/lib" 
```
to

```
NTL_INCDIR = "/usr/include"
NTL_LIBDIR = "/usr/lib"
```
did `make sage_conf` and `./sage -t --random-seed=0 src/sage/misc/cython.py` still displays linker warnings. If correct I could make this change when bisecting to see if bisecting can proceed.

If someone wants to provide some values for `NTL_INCDIR` and `NTL_LIBDIR` that can be arranged but then they should be tested - separately.

As far as I am concerned, those two variables should just be eliminated which would quite the patch during a rc.

They are needed because of the unfortunate need for a compile time environment at runtime of Sage when using the `cython` function. In this situation we cannot rely on the proper compile time environment being set (such as on macOS using the `.homebrew-build-env`.)

It would be fine with me to back out the setting of these two variables for Sage 9.3 if you think this helps.

short of using a kind of macro mentioned in [comment:29](#comment%3A29), 
how about checking for presence of `$ntl_prefix/lib/libntl.*` - and if there is none,
try `$ntl_prefix/lib64/libntl.*`

Should we error out if none of these works?

it already does create confusion. 

Should `NTL_LIBDIR` be just empty list if the location of libntl is one of standard locations?

Oh, well, that doesn't work =)

Seriously though, this problem is going to manifest elsewhere as well. Trying to guess at the exact environment that was present during `./configure` so that it can be replicated during `cython()` will be a losing battle.

Adding a .pc file upstream might help or it might make things worse. There are two separate libdirs, and I'm not sure off the top of my head how `pkg-config` decides which *.pc file to use (and thus which libdir to return) on a multilib system.

Even if it works, you're basically forbidding people from installing things manually and passing `-L` and `-I` during the build, instead forcing everyone to both provide *.pc files and then override `PKG_CONFIG_DIR`. It seems like a lot of antipattern to bury ourselves under to avoid telling people to set up their build environment before they want to build.

Perhaps cosmetic for purposes here but in the `makefile` there is `INCLUDEDIR=$(PREFIX)/include` which on a gentoo install gives

```
$ pkg-config --cflags ntl
-I$(PREFIX)/include/NTL
```
i.e. from the installed `ntl.pc`

```
includedir=$(PREFIX)/include/NTL
```
Somehow `(PREFIX)` should be `{PREFIX}`.

gives, after `./configure` (perhaps a `./bootstrap` is needed before the `./configure`)

```

This assumes that `pkg-config` is installed and works correctly and that `basename` is installed. Not sure if there are `autoconf` equivalents to these. This gives the current result if a system `ntl.pc` file is not installed.

It's for François Bissey (fbissey) to decide. Maybe Michael Orlitzky (mjo) can help.

One, since it seems that the mechanism works well enough, I will submit it upstream. Two, I can include it in the sage-on-gentoo overlay but Michael has gone to a lot of effort to bring ntl up to date in Gentoo so I will submit a PR there as well.

Delete the `NTL_*` variables and tell macOS users that they have to run sage from homebrew if they built it using homebrew (only in rare cases where they later want to compile & run cython code).

There's no reason for most libraries to have a pkg-config file; although it's not the pkg-config file that I have a problem with if it solves an **actual** problem (at worse, it's harmless cruft).

Even better would be to incorporate sourcing of all these things into `sage` script on Homebrew, no?

this is only true for sane OSes with sane sysadmins.

> although it's not the pkg-config file that I have a problem with if it solves an **actual** problem (at worse, it's harmless cruft). It's using the pkg-config file to work around a sage issue,


many (most?) (semi)distros are hostile to multiplatform solutions; e.g. Sage on Gentoo chooses not to
run `./configure`, forcing Sage to basically have a lot of cruft specifically for such cases.
Sage has to jump hoops to make distros happy...

From the viewpoint of distribution packaging, `.pc` files are not very useful. But that's missing the point entirely - `pkg-config` is designed as a solution to the problem of finding libraries in a heterogeneous environment.

OK PR added to the description. Note that there is a minor change to the patch attached here. `includedir` shouldn't have included `NTL` as remarqued by Steve Trogdon.

New update works on gentoo w/o system .pc file

```
$ grep NTL build/pkgs/sage_conf/src/sage_conf.py
NTL_INCDIR = "///usr/include"
NTL_LIBDIR = "///usr/lib"
```

and with system .pc file

```
$ grep NTL build/pkgs/sage_conf/src/sage_conf.py
NTL_INCDIR = "/usr/include"
NTL_LIBDIR = "/usr/lib64"
```
