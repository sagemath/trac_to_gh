(from #29620)

We propose to remove the full `boost` package, which was added in 2016 (#20754, #20776) and updated once in 2018 (#26597), and only offer our cropped version of boost, which is enough for all of our packages. 

We argue that it's not Sage's job to provide a full boost installation.

No doctests depend on it. It can be used instead of boost_cropped though. The point of it is that some people wanted the full boost rather than a little bit being available in sage. Either because they wanted to use it or install packages through pip that may need it. 

Some optional packages could have undeclared dependency but chances are low.

As we move to use more and more system packages - including boost, I am OK with a move to remove it.

Especially since our `boost` package has been around so long as an optional package.

> As we move to use more and more system packages - including boost, I am OK with a move to remove it.

Right, and `boost_cropped` will skip installation and use the system `boost` if it's present.

Exactly. `boost` is a somewhat high demand maintenance package. There are regular releases and the build system is highly unusual. Working on it has shown some interesting quirks. I won't be sorry to see it go.
