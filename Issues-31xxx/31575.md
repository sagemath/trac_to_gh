(from #29620)

We propose to remove the full `boost` package, which was added in 2016 (#20754, #20776) and updated once in 2018 (#26597), and only offer our cropped version of boost, which is enough for all of our packages. 

We argue that it's not Sage's job to provide a full boost installation.

I don't see `boost` listed as a dependency for any other package or any doctests that depend on it. Can we just delete `build/pkgs/boost`?

Some optional packages could have undeclared dependency but chances are low.

As we move to use more and more system packages - including boost, I am OK with a move to remove it.

Especially since our `boost` package has been around so long as an optional package.

Right, and `boost_cropped` will skip installation and use the system `boost` if it's present.

Exactly. `boost` is a somewhat high demand maintenance package. There are regular releases and the build system is highly unusual. Working on it has shown some interesting quirks. I won't be sorry to see it go.
