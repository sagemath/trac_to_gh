For example on `ubuntu-bionic-i386-minimal` https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/2161532075: `openssl` fails with:

```
make depend && make _build_sw
gcc  -I. -Iinclude -Iapps/include  -fPIC -pthread -m64 -Wa,--noexecstack -O2 -g -march=native -DOPENSSL_USE_NODELETE -DL_ENDIAN -DOPENSSL_PIC -DOPENSSLDIR="\"/sage/local/openssl\"" -DENGINESDIR="\"/sage/local/lib64/engines-3\"" -DMODULESDIR="\"/sage/local/lib64/ossl-modules\"" -DOPENSSL_BUILDING_OPENSSL -DNDEBUG  -MMD -MF apps/lib/libapps-lib-app_params.d.tmp -MT apps/lib/libapps-lib-app_params.o -c -o apps/lib/libapps-lib-app_params.o apps/lib/app_params.c

                 from /usr/lib/gcc/i686-linux-gnu/7/include-fixed/limits.h:34,
                 from ./e_os.h:13,
                 from apps/include/apps.h:13,
                 from apps/lib/app_params.c:10:

 #include <bits/libc-header-start.h>
          ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
```

Same failure mode also for `tachyon` (https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/2177818373 for `ubuntu-bionic-i386-minimal`).



Critical for Sage 9.3 because it stops us from seeing other build failures on `i386-minimal` platforms
