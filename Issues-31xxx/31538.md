For example on `ubuntu-bionic-i386-minimal` https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/2161532075: `openssl` fails with:

```

 #include <bits/libc-header-start.h>
          ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
```

Same failure mode also for `tachyon` (https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/2177818373 for `ubuntu-bionic-i386-minimal`).



Critical for Sage 9.3 because it stops us from seeing other build failures on `i386-minimal` platforms
