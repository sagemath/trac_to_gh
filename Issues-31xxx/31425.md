when trying to compile Sage 9.2 from source, I get on my laptop (x86_64, Ubuntu 18.04):

```
Now running gfan to install links in '/usr/local/sage-9.2/local/bin/'...
./gfan: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6: version `GLIBCXX_3.4.26' not found (required by ./gfan)
```
This is reminiscent of #9510. I have no LD_LIBRARY_PATH defined.

Component: **packages: standard**

Keywords: **gfan**

I think we need know more about your system. ubuntu-bionic is well tested by our portability infrastructure. Did you add any packages from other package repos?
