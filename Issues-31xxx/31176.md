All outside dependencies of `SnapPy` itself are already included in `sage`. That is, 

```
sage -pip install --no-deps snappy spherogram plink FXrays snappy_manifolds
```
would be a completely functional "optional spkg" for `SnapPy`.

Sounds like `cypari` should be an `extras_require`?

Unfortunately, outside of Sage, SnapPy does use `cypari` very heavily; it is just that inside of Sage, it uses `cypari2` instead.  The two modules provide identical functionality, but `cypari` is statically linked (and includes an embedded copy of `cysignals`) whereas `cypari2` relies on the external dynamic library `libpari`.
