It should be noted that `SnapPy`, nor any of the other software at â€‹[https://github.com/3-manifolds](https://github.com/3-manifolds), actually depends on, or even uses, `(py)graphviz` or `ipympl`.  A certain amount of the stuff in that Docker image is just there because I used it in some project or other ;-).

All outside dependencies of `SnapPy` itself are already included in `sage`. That is, 

```
sage -pip install --no-deps snappy spherogram plink FXrays snappy_manifolds
```
would be a completely functional "optional spkg" for `SnapPy`.
