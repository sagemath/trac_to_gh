Volker Braun pointed out in [#31479 comment:12](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/31479#comment:12) that sage gives the following wrong answer on a 32-bit machine after the bug-fix patch of #31479 is applied:

```
sage: a,b,c,d = var("a b c d")
sage: ((a + b + c)^30 * (3*b + d - 5/d)^3).expand().subs(a=0,b=2,c=-1)
d^3 + 18*d^2 + 1739461754973*d - 8697308774865/d + 450/d^2 - 125/d^3 + 36
```
This answer is congruent modulo `2^32` to `d^3 + 18*d^2 + 93*d - 465/d + 450/d^2 - 125/d^3 + 36`, which is the correct answer, so it seems clear that the problem comes from an integer overflow error. Perhaps the overflow error can also be produced on a 64-bit machine.

Depends on #31694

I reproduced the bug by installing sage in a 32-bit debian virtual machine, and found a much simpler example of the overflow:

```
sage: (2*x).subs(x=-2^31)
0
```
More generally:

```
sage: for n in range(10):
....:     print(n, (n*x).subs(x=-2^31)/2^31)
0 0
1 -1
2 0
3 -1
4 0
5 -1
6 0
7 -1
8 0
9 -1
```

I think the problem is an incorrect calculation of absolute value:

```
sage: abs(x).subs(x=-2^31)
-2147483648
```
To decide whether a multiplication might cause an overflow, pynac compares the absolute values of the factors to a certain bound. In the example of [comment:2](#comment%3A2), the absolute value of a factor is negative, so it is less than the bound, even though the factor is actually very large.

And I think the incorrect absolute value comes from the C++ `std::labs` function. The documentation of that function says "If the result cannot be represented as a long int (such as labs(LONG_MIN) in an implementation with two's complement signed values), it causes undefined behavior."

I should be able to write a pynac patch soon that tests my theory. Even if it isn't the bug we are looking for, this bug in the absolute value needs to be fixed.

Here is a crash that is caused by the overflow when `-2^31` is divided by `-1`:

```
sage: (1 - 2^31*x)*x
    <snip>
Unhandled SIGFPE: An unhandled floating point exception occurred. ...
```

Patches to fix all of these should be coming soon.

Followup tickets: #31984 and #31986.

I will try to post this (and my other pynac patches) to the pynac github repository soon.  My previous attempts failed because I know almost nothing about git, but now I understand that I need a fork, instead of a clone, so I hope to be successful.
