Volker Braun pointed out in ticket:31479#comment:12 that sage gives the following wrong answer on a 32-bit machine after the bug-fix patch of #31479 is applied:

```
sage: a,b,c,d = var("a b c d")
sage: ((a + b + c)^30 * (3*b + d - 5/d)^3).expand().subs(a=0,b=2,c=-1)
d^3 + 18*d^2 + 1739461754973*d - 8697308774865/d + 450/d^2 - 125/d^3 + 36
```
This answer is congruent modulo `2^32` to `d^3 + 18*d^2 + 93*d - 465/d + 450/d^2 - 125/d^3 + 36`, which is the correct answer, so it seems clear that the problem comes from an integer overflow error. Perhaps the overflow error can also be produced on a 64-bit machine.

Followup tickets: #31984 and #31986.

I will try to post this (and my other pynac patches) to the pynac github repository soon.  My previous attempts failed because I know almost nothing about git, but now I understand that I need a fork, instead of a clone, so I hope to be successful.
