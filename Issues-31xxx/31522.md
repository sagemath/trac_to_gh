```
For example on `ubuntu-trusty-maximal` (https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/2135025659), 
`configure` correctly finds system `perl_cpan_polymake_prereq`
but then tests whether SPKG `perl_cpan_polymake_prereq` can be installed (it gives an error - by design).

This can be distracting in the GH Action logs.


Depends on #31163
