<div id="comment:0"></div>

From #30520.

Observed:

```
sage: product(-x, x, 1, SR.var('n'))
#0: simplify_product(product='product(-_SAGE_VAR_x,_SAGE_VAR_x,1,_SAGE_VAR_n))
...
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
RuntimeError: ECL says: Error executing code in Maxima:
factorial: factorial of negative integer -1 not defined.
```
or equivalently:

```
sage: from sage.calculus.calculus import symbolic_product
sage: x, n = SR.var('x, n')
sage: symbolic_product(-x, x, 1, n)
#0: simplify_product(product='product(-_SAGE_VAR_x,_SAGE_VAR_x,1,_SAGE_VAR_n))
...
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
RuntimeError: ECL says: Error executing code in Maxima:
factorial: factorial of negative integer -1 not defined.
```

Expected:

```
sage: from sage.calculus.calculus import symbolic_product
sage: x, n = SR.var('x, n')
sage: symbolic_product(-x, x, 1, n)
(-1)^n*factorial(n)
```


Upstream: **Reported upstream. Developers acknowledge bug.**

Thanks for fixing this and for the heads-up.

This should be applied as a patch in Sage until
a Maxima release has this and we upgrade to it.
