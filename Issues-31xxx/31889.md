The sage implementation of `QQbar` uses a symbolic representation (called descriptors). The descriptors can be of one of the types
- `ANRational`
- `ANRoot`
- `ANExtensionElement`
- `ANUnaryExpr`
- `ANBinaryExpr`

For now, only `ANRational` and `ANExtensionElement` provides custom computation of minimal polynomials. This ticket implements it for any descriptor.
