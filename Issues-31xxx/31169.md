This metaticket addresses defects in Sage's
algorithm for plotting one-variable functions.

* #31089: `detect_poles` puts a gap in function plots
  (even if there are no poles).
* #29954: plots sometimes have a gap in intervals
  where the function is nearly linear.
* #6895: plots should not have a vertical line segment
  at places where the function has a vertical asymptote
  or jump discontinuity (see alsoticket: ticket:29954#comment:12#comment:29954
  andticket: ticket:29954#comment:13#comment:29954). The behaviour
  of `detect_poles=True` is a small step in this direction.
* "`adaptive_refinement` fails quite a lot ... because
  it takes the absolute error instead of a relative one"
  (fromticket: ticket:29954#comment:13#comment:29954). On intervals where the
  graph has large slope, even a relative error is not
  correct -- an angle (or the horizontal relative distance)
  should be used instead.
* plots do not accurately locate the endpoints of an interval
  where the function is not defined (seeticket: ticket:13246#comment:44#comment:13246
  and `plot(sqrt(cos(27*x)), 0, 1)`): adaptive plotting should
  not be terminated when an exclusion point of the function
  is detected.
* plots do not accurately locate the tip of a cusp
  (such as `plot(abs(x - sqrt(2))^(1/3), 1, 2)`,
  which should touch the x-axis)
* #8341: `detect_poles="show"` does not detect a vertical
  asymptote unless the function changes sign.

Related tickets that could also be discussed:

* #31870: Fix using matplotlib stylesheets in plots
* #13368: plot(x, xmin=1, xmax=-1) comes up empty 
* #12676: plot exclude sometimes just connects instead of excluding
* #6893: plotting code improvements
* Clarify the documentation in `sage/plot/plot.py`:
  * The description of `sage.plot.line.line` in the class
    docstring says "a line determined by a sequence of points
    (this need not be straight!)". This should be changed to
    something like "a piecewise-linear curve determined
    by a sequence of points".
  * A `point` is an ordered pair `(x,y)`, but, confusingly,
    this word is sometimes also used to refer to a real number
    that represents a possible value of `x`. (Regrettably,
    this is institutionalized in the naming of the argument
    `initial_points` of the function `generate_plot_points`.)

What I don't like about the current behaviour, is that things are connected even if adaptive refinment fails.

Examples `plot(sin(1/x))`, `plot(floor(x))` and similar.

This would also automatically take care of poles, if done right (of course the absolute, relative error etc are even more an issue then).
at 

Additionally one should also take care of functions, that need many refinments in only few locations, e.g. `plot(real_nth_root(x, 3))`. You don't see the error currently, because we just connect everything, but `0` actually needs about 50 refinements, which isn't a big deal because it is only one value.

Currently, the keyword ``adaptive_recursion`` does not really take care of this, because it does not distinguish between functions where refinement needs to be done an exponential number of times and those where this needs not to be done. Of course you can always leave this up to the user as well to discover that `plot(real_nth_root(x, 3), adaptive_recursion=50)` does indeed do many recursions but only at one location so it is not a runtime problem.

-* (no ticket yet) Clarify the documentation in sage/plot/plot.py:
-  * The description of `sage.plot.line.line` in the class docstring says "a line determined by a sequence of points (this need not be straight!)". This should be changed to something like "a piecewise-linear curve determined by a sequence of points".
