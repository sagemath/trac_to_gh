Currently, method `breadth_first_search` in `c_graph.pyx` implements a queue using a list and removes element at position 0. This is ok on small graphs, but for large graphs, This is really slow.

I'm using the following function to benchmark. When `report_distance` is `False`, it calls the code from `c_graph.pyx`, and when it is `True`,  is uses a Python implementation from `generic_graph.py`.

```sage
def comp(): 
    for n in [5, 10, 50, 100, 500, 1000]: 
        G = graphs.Grid2dGraph(n, n) 
        print(G) 
        %timeit _ = list(G.breadth_first_search(start=(0, 0), report_distance=False))
        %timeit _ = list(G.breadth_first_search(start=(0, 0), report_distance=True))
```


Before:

```
sage: comp()

72.8 µs ± 6 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10000 loops each)
2D Grid Graph for [10, 10]
58.5 µs ± 1.2 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10000 loops each)
269 µs ± 13.8 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000 loops each)
2D Grid Graph for [50, 50]
1.92 ms ± 165 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops each)
8.12 ms ± 263 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops each)
2D Grid Graph for [100, 100]
9.63 ms ± 232 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops each)
36.2 ms ± 1.43 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10 loops each)
2D Grid Graph for [500, 500]
397 ms ± 18 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each)
1.12 s ± 27.3 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each)

5.64 s ± 414 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each)
```


After:

```
sage: comp()

2D Grid Graph for [10, 10]
21.8 µs ± 1.62 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100000 loops each)
300 µs ± 19.9 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000 loops each)

8.65 ms ± 457 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops each)
2D Grid Graph for [100, 100]
2.99 ms ± 141 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops each)
34.8 ms ± 1.69 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10 loops each)
2D Grid Graph for [500, 500]
105 ms ± 4.5 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10 loops each)
1.18 s ± 14.6 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each)
2D Grid Graph for [1000, 1000]
596 ms ± 68.3 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each)
5.83 s ± 1.11 s per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each)
```

Another improvement is to avoid using `in_neighbors` and `out_neighbors` since these methods return lists of vertices and behind we have some mallocs of arrays. So a lot of operations that can be avoided.

First of all:

I can confirm an enourmous improvement (something like a factor 2 or 3), but I can't reproduce the 32 seconds for your before `2D Grid Graph for [1000, 1000]`. Looks to me like you went into swap or similar.

I don't see an improvement in factoring out `next_depth...`.

The compiler optimzes things fine for me, if I distinct everywhere with `self.direction == 0` and `self.direction != 0`. Then one can right away change the data type for lifo to https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/stack
as well.

This is how my overall diff looks to your branch:

However, as mentioned above, I need to figure out something yet for sparse graphs.

And there seems to exist no depth-first doctest for static sparse, at least not in `sage/src/sage/graphs`.

Never mind my last comment. I think it is a good first step to seperate `next_breadth...` and `next_depth...` for the following reason:

I don't think queue is a good implementation in the long run. The thing is, we know exactly which values things in queue can take and we don't want anything twice, so we might as well implement the queue as `int*` of length number of active vertices (one needs to realloc to segmentation fault, in case someone adds vertices while we perform the depth first search, but I assume non-optimal runtime is okay in this case).
- And each vertex points to the next in the queue (initial value -1).
- We need also keep track of first and last of the queue.
- We only add a vertex to the queue, if it doesn't have a next value yet (and is not the last one).

Later on, we can also report the distance easily.

I rebased the branch on 9.3.beta5 and use `int*` to implement the queue. I have let the `in_neighbors` and `out_neighbors` to have a functional branch. 

Ideally, we should implement (un)safe iterators over the in/out neighbors of all backends. Currently, some backends have neighbor iterators that first build the list of neighbors and then iterate over that list...

Ok, I implemented `next_out_neighbor_unsafe` for static sparse graph. It doesn't accept labels, because the labels are only known to the backend.

I pushed it to `u/gh-kliem/next_out_neighbor_for_static_sparse`, not yet a ticket, but with this thing you can apply my suggestion from [comment:10](#comment%3A10).

Does this appear reasonable to you?

As mentioned, we can also easily add a method that reports the distance of the current vertex as to replace the python method. Do you want to do this here or in an extra ticket.

comment:10 can of course also be an extra ticket and then I can quickly just review this here.

Btw, my idea for the queue imitation does not seem to make a difference, but for limiting the maximum memory usage. What might be simpler (and actually use less memory in some cases) is to use the standard queue implementation with the new setup for seen: Mark a vertex as seen as soon as we add it to the queue.

Its appears to be all the same speed but this would avoid reinventing the wheel while still reducing the memory usage.

When we also keep track of the current distance, we will need to change the base type for queue, but that wouldn't be a problem.

And on some follow up ticket, we can also allow a list of vertices for the cython implementation.

Feel free to modify this ticket and merge your proposals (including using queue to not reinvent the wheel). 

For reporting distances, my only concern is whether we should do all in a single method or if we should design specific methods to save some tests.

Observe that we can use the data structure for distances to report edges.

I agree that in another ticket we can have list of vertices as input.

I still think that it would be nice to have low level neighbor iterators in backends, but this is another story.

I implemented `next_out_neighbor_unsafe` for static sparse. What do you mean by low level neighbor iterators? Python iterators?

I think `next_out_neighbor_unsafe` is a pretty good solution to make it work for all backends with one function name.

I tried implementing an iterator in sparse graph and this takes twice as much (I don't know how to make it significantly faster):

It is a python function after all.

The advantage of creating the list of all neighbors is that we need less often to traverse the tree of neighbors. However, for a sparse graph, this should usually be a very fast operation. This seems to be the only thing that can be improved in `next_out_neighbor` for sparse graphs (and I don't see anything for dense graphs at all).

There was an error in method ` next_in_neighbor_unsafe` of `static_sparse_backend.pyx`:

```diff
-        cdef int degree = self.g_rev.neighbors[u+1] - self.g.neighbors[u]
+        cdef int degree = self.g_rev.neighbors[u+1] - self.g_rev.neighbors[u]
```
The segfaults reported by the patchbot for #31129 are all due to this error.

I changed to the safer / cleaner version

```diff
-        cdef int degree = self.g_rev.neighbors[u+1] - self.g.neighbors[u]
+        cdef int degree = out_degree(self.g_rev, u)
```
