Currently, `MultiCoordFunction` is not an element class.

```
sage: M = Manifold(2, 'M', structure='topological')
sage: X.<x,y> = M.chart()
sage: FR = X.function_ring()
sage: f = X.multifunction(x+y, sin(x*y), x^2 + 3*y); f
Coordinate functions (x + y, sin(x*y), x^2 + 3*y) on the Chart (M, (x, y))
sage: f.parent()
<class 'sage.manifolds.chart_func.MultiCoordFunction'>
sage: FR^3                                                 # with #31721
Ambient free module of rank 3 over Ring of chart functions on Chart (M, (x, y))
sage: f in FR^3
False
```

We change the function `sage.modules.free_module.element_class` so that it uses the element class `Vector_symbolic_dense` not only for free modules over the ring `SR` but also for free modules over any commutative ring whose base ring is `SR`.

In fact, we dispatch through a new method `_free_module_element_class_dense`. `ChartFunction` provides a specialized implementation, which makes sure that `MultiCoordFunction` (now a subclass of `Vector_symbolic_dense`) is used as the element class.

This simplifies the implementation of `MultiCoordFunction` and also  makes the elementwise symbolic methods `simplify` etc. available.


Follow-up:
- We could move the method `MultiCoordFunction.jacobian` to the superclass, making it more generally available.


Depends on #31721
Depends on #31999

> I think I could use some help from a pickling expert here...

Sorry I am definitely not such an expert and therefore cannot offer help here. Instead, let me ask about the motivation of this ticket. I understand that, from a mathematical point of view, `MultiCoordFunction`'s belong to the free module `FR^n` (`FR` being the ring of chart functions associated to a given chart and `n` the manifold's dimension) and that implementing this simplifies (a little) the code by relying on some code already implemented for `Vector_symbolic_dense`. This, by itself, is a motivation. However, I would say this is not a strong one, because no use is made in the manifold code of the *module* structure of the set of `MultiCoordFunction`'s over a given chart. Indeed, in the current implementation, the class `MultiCoordFunction` is used only to store

1. the coordinate expression of a continous map in a given pair of charts;
2. the transition map between two charts.

In both cases, there is no meaning in the basic module operations `m1 + m2` and `f*m1`, where `m1` and `m2` are two `MultiCoordFunction`'s and `f` is a chart function. Hence, the motivation to provide a parent with a module structure seems pretty weak, given the current use of the class `MultiCoordFunction`. So maybe it is not worth to pursue the effort and keep `MultiCoordFunction` as a simple technical storage class (by opposition to a "mathematical" class), not relying on sophisticated parts of Sage, with complicated pickling and possibly less efficient in terms of CPU time.

Thanks for your quick reply. This sounds a strong motivation for a module structure!

Wouldn't a kind of `MultiScalarField` be better suited? In some sense, for vector-valued functions, this already exists through the class `Components`.

Thanks for these explanations.

I guess a tricky point is regarding the required smoothness of scalar fields. I like to think of the domain as a smooth manifold, but the functions that I want to define on them often are less smooth - typically only piecewise C<sup>1</sup>, with Lipschitz gradients.
