<a id='comment:4'>Comment 4:</a>
We don't have consistency with the type of error for trying to take the roots of `0`:

```
sage: R.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: R.zero().roots()
ValueError: roots of 0 are not defined
sage: R.<x> = ZZ['t'][]
sage: R.zero().roots()
ArithmeticError: factorization of 0 is not defined
```
However, standardizing that is another ticket.
