When initializing the inverse of a transition map between two charts, either by the method `CoordChange.inverse` (computation of the inverse) or by `CoordChange.set_inverse` (inverse provided by the user), the attribute `_inverse` of `self` is set to the inverse object (for caching). Obviously, by symmetry, the attribute `_inverse` of the inverse should be set to `self`, but it is not. As a consequence, we have in Sage 9.3:

```
sage: E.<x,y> = EuclideanSpace()
sage: cart = E.cartesian_coordinates()
sage: polar = E.polar_coordinates()
sage: polar_to_cart = E.coord_change(polar, cart)
sage: polar_to_cart.display()
x = r*cos(ph)
y = r*sin(ph)
sage: cart_to_polar = E.coord_change(cart, polar)
sage: cart_to_polar.display()
r = sqrt(x^2 + y^2)
ph = arctan2(y, x)
sage: polar_to_cart.inverse() is cart_to_polar
True
```
So far so good, but

```
sage: cart_to_polar.inverse() is polar_to_cart
...
ValueError: no solution found; use set_inverse() to set the inverse manually
``` 

This is fixed in this ticket by the following one-line addition to the code of `CoordChange.inverse` and `CoordChange.set_inverse`:

```
self._inverse._inverse = self
```
Besides, this ticket improves a little bit the documentation of `CoordChange.inverse`.
