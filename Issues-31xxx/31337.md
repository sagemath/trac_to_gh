To eliminate an infinite loop, ticket #30688 deleted one of pynac's expansion rules for powers of a product: expanding `(a1*a2*...*a_n)^c` no longer pulls out a factor of `(-ai)^c` when `ai` is negative. (But the factor `(ai)^c` will still be pulled out if `ai` is positive.) We should reimplement a version of this rule that does not crash sage.
