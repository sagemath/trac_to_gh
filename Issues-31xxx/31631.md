It is desirable to have a cleaner and more flexible eigenvalues/eigenvectors computation when the eigenvalues do not belong to the fraction field of the base ring of the matrix. Namely
- rely on `.algebraic_closure()` of the fraction field of the base field instead of assuming that the user wants to use `QQbar`. This will make eigenvalues/eigenvectors computation work over `Fp` for example.
- Check coercion to the algebraic closure before using `galois_conjugates` (the underlying problem of #30518 before it was fixed by #31628)

This problem in the code were noticed in #30518 but an alternative (and useful) workaround in #31628 was designed to solve the initial problem.
