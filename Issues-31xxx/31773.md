<a id='comment:2'></a>I tried Macaulay2, version 1.17.2.1, from master branch.

Every **[x...z]** in 1.17 changed to **[x..z]** in 1.17.2.1

Example:

```
sage: str(macaulay2("QQ[x,y,z]/(x+y+z)"))
 QQ[x..z]
---------
x + y + z

sage: R.<x,y,z,w> = PolynomialRing(ZZ, 4)
sage: I = R.ideal([x*y-z^2, y^2-w^2])
sage: Q = R.quotient(I)
sage: Q._macaulay2_init_()
    ZZ[x..z, w]
-------------------

Yes, it is `[x..z]` on my end, too. I have used triple dots `...` because they are interpreted as a generic placeholder by our doctesting framework. This way, the tests also pass with older versions of Macaulay2, as `[x...z]` also matches `[x, y, z]`.

You can try to run the tests on the few files that contain Macaulay2 doctests like this:

```
./sage -t -l --optional=sage,macaulay2 $(git grep -l -i "optional.*macaulay2" | paste -sd " " -)
```

By the way do you know how to use the M2 interface in Jupyter?

test if M2 is found

```
In [1]: ￼import shutil
         shutil.which("M2")
Out[1]:
'/home/sheerluck/M2/install/bin/M2'
```
if `shutil.which` returns empty string, we need to add PATH to kernel:

1) `jupyter-kernelspec list` shows where sagemath kernel is

```
$ jupyter-kernelspec list
Available kernels:
...
sagemath          /usr/share/jupyter/kernels/sagemath
```

2) go there, open kernel.json, and after `"language": "sage"` add "env":

```
{
  ...
  "language": "sage",
  "env": {"PATH":"/home/sheerluck/M2/install/bin:$PATH"} 
}
```

> What's wrong?

we need to check several things

1) that M2 and octave work with full paths. If on some system M2 is installed in `/opt/M2` and octave is installed in `/opt/octave` we need to check that `/opt/M2/bin/M2` works and `/opt/octave/bin/octave-cli` works. M2 can fail to run with "/usr/lib64/libfactory-4.3.0.so not found" if `singular`  was recently updated to 4.3.1

2) that before `"env": {"PATH":"/opt/M2/bin/:/opt/octave/bin/:$PATH"}` line there is a comma after `"language": "sage"`:

```
 "display_name": "SageMath 9.7.beta8",
 "language": "sage",
 "env": {"PATH":"/opt/M2/bin/:/opt/octave/bin/:$PATH"}
```

3) that both paths are separated with colon: `"PATH":"/opt/M2/bin/:/opt/octave/bin/:$PATH"`

4) that `sage -n jupyter` starts without errors

5) that "display_name" from 2) is what we see in jupyter

6) that we get `'/opt/M2/bin/M2'` after

```
import shutil
shutil.which("M2")
```

7) that we get `'/opt/octave/bin/octave-cli'` after

```
import shutil
shutil.which("octave-cli")
```

If all that is checked, jupyter has to give us something like

```
In [1]: macaulay2("2+2")

Out[1]: 4

In [2]: octave.eval('2+2')

Out[2]: 'ans = 4'
```
