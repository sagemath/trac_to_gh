This commit adds the first functionality for endomorphism rings of jacobians of genus 2 curves over Q. There is a new class `EndomorphismRing`, and two methods of this class: `is_absolutely_field` which determines whether or not the endomorphism algebra is a field; and `is_absolutely_trivial`, which determines whether or not the ring is just the integer ring Z.

One corresponding attribute has been added to the Jacobian of the hyperelliptic curve: `is_generic`, which is a wrapper for `is_absolutely_trivial` above.

The algorithms are based on Lombardo's paper "Computing the geometric endomorphism ring of a genus 2 Jacobian".

This is needed for trac ticket #30837.

Why doesn't `EndomorphismRing` inherit from `Homset`? It should also use `_repr_` rather than `__repr__`.

I think you should not cache the result of `endomorphism_ring`. It should redirect to `Hom`, which does caching, and implement a `_Hom_` method as

```python
def _Hom_(self, Y, category):
    if self == Y:
        from .jacobian_endomorphisms import EndomorphismRing
        return EndomorphismRing(self)
    return super()._Hom_(Y, category)
```
That way someone doing `End(X)` or `Hom(X, X)` will get the endomorphism ring as well.

A few things about the documentation:

```diff
     def is_generic(self, B=200):
         r"""
-        Returns whether the absolute endomorphism algebra of self is the
+        Return whether the absolute endomorphism algebra of ``self`` is the
         integer ring `\ZZ`.
 
         INPUT:
 
-        - ``B`` -- the bound which appears in the statement of the algorithm
-        from Lombardo's paper. Defaults to 200.
+        - ``B`` -- (default: 200) the bound which appears in the statement of
+          the algorithm from [Lom2019]_
 
         OUTPUT:
 
-            (bool): boolean indicating whether or not the absolute endomorphism
-            ring is isomorphic to the integer ring.
+        Boolean indicating whether or not the absolute endomorphism
+        ring is isomorphic to the integer ring.
 
-        EXAMPLES::
+        EXAMPLES:
 
-        This is LMFDB curve 603.a.603.2
+        This is LMFDB curve 603.a.603.2::

             sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
             sage: f = 4*x^5 + x^4 - 4*x^3 + 2*x^2 + 4*x + 1
             sage: C = HyperellipticCurve(f)
```
and similar changes. The biggest is when `EXAMPLES` is followed by text, it should be a single colon `:`, when something it to have Sage code after it, it should be a double colon `::`.

The `Codes up Lombardo's Algorithm 4.15` is not a really good explanation of what the function does. It is good to state `This is Algorithm 4.15 in [Lom2019]_.`, yet it is good to be more self-contained with a more descriptive version of what the function does.

I agree with you.
Perhaps, `__endomorphism_ring` is the only one that makes sense, see https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/pull/2/files#r669811139

With that in mind, I would add include a `proof` flag in the input of the methods `is_absolutely_field`, `is_absolutely_trivial`, and `is_generic`,
and raise an error if `proof=True` and you would be returning `False`. 

Note, I don't think you need to do this `is_geom_trivial_when_field` and `get_is_geom_irred` as these are not available to the user. However, I would say in documention string that any `False` returned by those functions is not proved.

I don't think makes sense for this ticket. The ticket is not providing the ring in any shape or form, indeed, this ticket only provides a method to check if End = ZZ, and if not we cannot even prove it with the current method.

It is a `Homset`, and it will provide consistency with other such things within Sage. There isn't anything more you have to implement on top of it. Moreover, it will be much more naturally accessible via the `Hom` functor, which would handle the caching, and easy to extend to be an actual homset.

Dear Edgar, Nils, Travis,

Thank you all very much for your comments and code review. The latest commit has addressed all of the above comments now. Here are the main changes:

1. The `EndomorphismRing` class is gone; its two main methods have been attached directly to the Jacobian via `is_generic` (which existed previously) and `geometric_endomorphism_algebra_is_field`. I didn't rename `is_generic` to what Nils suggested - `endomorphism_ring_is_ZZ` - since I understand that the word "generic" is commonly used to refer to there being geometrically no extra endomorphisms; but let me know if I should change either of these user-facing names.

2. The file `jacobian_endomorphisms.py` has been renamed `jacobian_endomorphism_utils.py`, since it isn't offering any proper implementation of `EndomorphismRing`, and instead contains the main functions for the two methods in (1) above.

3. Requisite doc changes throughout.

I have a problem with it, especially when it's attached to the Jacobian itself: it should mention it is measuring something about the endomorphism ring: people could think that it tests whether the torsion is generic?

There is also the slightly pedantic point that any particular jacobian is *not* generic, in the sense that its corresponding point in A_g is closed, and therefore not a generic point.
