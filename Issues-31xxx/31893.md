I was browsing https://github.com/sagemath/sage/actions
and noticed a lot of

```
sage -t --random-seed=0 src/sage/misc/sageinspect.py
    Timed out
```
in many logs of **Run SAGE_ROOT/tox.ini**

We improve and significantly speed up one doctest,
thereby fixing these timeouts.

Before:

```
sage -t --long --random-seed=0 src/sage/misc/sageinspect.py
    [340 tests, 158.98 s]
```
After:

```
sage -t --long --random-seed=0 src/sage/misc/sageinspect.py
    [340 tests, 34.82 s]
```
