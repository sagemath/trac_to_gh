There seems to be a memory leak in the `prime_range` function. The leak happens regardless of the algorithm used, whether `pari_primes` or `pari_isprime`.

```
import os, psutil
import gc
process = psutil.Process(os.getpid())

# Memory leak in prime_range() function: memory usage grows on every iteration 
# and doesn't free up even after a gc.collect() statement.
for i in range(10):
     pr = prime_range(1000000)
     print(f'{process.memory_info().rss/1e6:.0f} MB')

gc.collect()
print(f'After GC collect: {process.memory_info().rss/1e6:.0f} MB')


# using pari_isprime
for i in range(10):
     pr = prime_range(start=1, stop=1000000, algorithm="pari_isprime")
     print(f'{process.memory_info().rss/1e6:.0f} MB')

gc.collect()
print(f'After GC collect: {process.memory_info().rss/1e6:.0f} MB')
```

I'm using version 9.2 on Windows, the latest release from Github. I'm using Windows 10 Enterprise version 21H1.

The behaviour continues even if I increase the number of iterations to 100 or 1000.

Thanks for testing. It definitely seems OS-specific, then. I tried on a couple of different Windows computers and observed the leak. On the other hand, I **did not** observe a leak on my WSL-based Ubuntu setup.
