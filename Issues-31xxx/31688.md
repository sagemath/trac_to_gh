Similar to #31653, given a continuous map `\Phi: N -> M` and a manifold subset `S` of `M`, we define the pullback (preimage) of `S` as the subset of `N` of points `p` with `\Phi(p)` in `S`.

Given a real scalar field `Phi: N -> R` and a `RealSet` `S`, we define the pullback in the same way.

Also, we view a chart `C` as a continuous function `Phi: C.domain() -> R^n` and allow pulling back any subset of `R^n` (an object with a `__contains__` method; for example polyhedra, lattices, linear subspaces, tensor modules) by it as well. 

In all cases, because `Phi` is continuous, topological closures/interiors pull back.


An application is in #31981.

Some comments regarding the documentation:

- there is no entry for the class `ManifoldSubsetPullback` in the reference manual
- in the files `continuous_map.py` and `subsets/pullback.py`, each instance of `:class:`ManifoldSubset`` should be replaced by `:class:`~sage.manifolds.subset.ManifoldSubset``
- the docstring of `ScalarField.pullback` should have an INPUT and OUTPUT sections similar to those of `ContinuousMap.preimage`. By the way, to be consistent with `ContinuousMap.preimage`, shouldn't `ScalarField.pullback` be renamed to `ScalarField.preimage`, with `pullback` defined as an alias to `preimage`?
- the INPUT and OUTPUT sections of `DiffMap.pullback` should be updated to take into account the new arguments.

Thanks. 

At the moment, we have 

```
sage: M = Manifold(2, 'M')

sage: M.identity_map().preimage(M)                                                                  
Subset Id_M_inv_M of the 2-dimensional differentiable manifold M
sage: M.identity_map().preimage(M) is M                                                             
False
sage: M.zero_scalar_field().preimage(RealSet.point(0))                                              
Subset zero_inv_{0} of the 2-dimensional differentiable manifold M
sage: M.zero_scalar_field().preimage(RealSet.point(0)) is M                                         
False
```
Do you think it would be easy to have both answers to be `True`? If no, this should not hamper the current ticket, but be differed to another ticket.
