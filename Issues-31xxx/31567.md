This will do a "best effort" isolation to avoid using a homebrew installation in `/usr/local` for anything except bootstrapping and unpacking xz tarballs + a little trick for liblzma.h, which is missing on macOS.

To test:

```
$ EXTRA_CONFIGURE_ARGS="--disable-r" tox -e local-macos-nohomebrew-python3_xcode
```
It can then be checked that no libraries from /usr/local leak in, using

```
find prefix/lib -name "*.so" -o -name "*.dylib*" -exec otool -L {} \;
```
(Building R is disabled because the R package build still pokes around in /usr/local and finds libintl and liblzma.)

To set specific deployment targets, use:

```
$ EXTRA_CONFIGURE_ARGS="--disable-r" tox -e local-macos-10.14-nohomebrew-python3_xcode -- config.status
$ EXTRA_CONFIGURE_ARGS="--disable-r" tox -e local-macos-10.15-nohomebrew-python3_xcode -- config.status
$ EXTRA_CONFIGURE_ARGS="--disable-r" tox -e local-macos-11.1-nohomebrew-python3_xcode -- config.status
```

... and with python3.7 from XCode:

```
$ tox -e local-macos-10.14-nohomebrew-python3_xcode-python3.7 -- config.status
```
(Remove `config.status` from the end of these lines to have the actual build done.)

These environments allow building Sage for older macOS versions, for example for building a 10.14 distribution on a 10.15 machine. The wheels are then correctly tagged, for example `pplpy-0.8.6-cp38-cp38-macosx_10_14_x86_64.whl`.

Cannot go in the opposite direction (building for 11 on a 10.15 machine) -- because pip will refuse to install a previously built wheel that is tagged for 11.)
