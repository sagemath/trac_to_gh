This looks strange

Typo here (or > of)

PBW generator or the

Concerning dagger, the codomain should be the opposite algebra. But we do not have any way to explain that, do we ?

Fixed.

Not really, no. Since we want to identify the opposite algebra with the original algebra as vector spaces, the best we can do here is think of it as a linear map (rather than an algebra morphism).
