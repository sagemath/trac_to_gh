Concerning dagger, the codomain should be the opposite algebra. But we do not have any way to explain that, do we ?

Indeed, that could be simplified.

Fixed.

Not really, no. Since we want to identify the opposite algebra with the original algebra as vector spaces, the best we can do here is think of it as a linear map (rather than an algebra morphism).
