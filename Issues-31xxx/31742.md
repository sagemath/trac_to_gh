We define some convenience methods that make it easy to construct manifold objects corresponding to linear and mixed-integer linear optimization problems.

The ambient manifold is just a Euclidean space, using the (formatted) variable names of the frontend.  We also define a backend chart using the variable names that the MILP backend uses.

Adding variables to the MILP will define a `ContinuousMap` that injects the previous MILP into the new one.

Adding constraints to the MILP will set up a subset.

'x[(1, 2)]'
```
This variable name is not compatible with LP (http://lpsolve.sourceforge.net/5.0/CPLEX-format.htm) or MPS file format (https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/9.1/refman/mps_format.html).
So changing this to something that has a chance to work with these file formats, such as `x_1_2`, would be an improvement.
