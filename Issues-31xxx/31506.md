On sage-9.1 [SageMath](../wiki/SageMath) version 9.1, Release Date: 2020-05-20                     Using Python 3.7.3.

Built in Centos 8, I meet the following behavior.

```
sage:(sinh(sqrt(t))).laplace(t,s)
0
```

I don't get 0 with other (non zero) functions.

I confirm the bug (on MacOS 10.15.7 and Ubuntu 20.04).  As a workaround, you can use sympy:

```
sage: var("s t")
(s, t)
sage: laplace(sinh(sqrt(t)), t, s, algorithm="sympy")[0]
1/2*sqrt(pi)*e^(1/4/s)/s^(3/2)
```

The problem (as with some other bugs) seems to be our default setting of `domain : complex` for maxima:

```
sage: maxima("laplace(sinh(sqrt(t)), t, s);")  # maxima gives the wrong answer
0
sage: maxima("domain : real;")  # change the domain
real
sage: maxima("laplace(sinh(sqrt(t)), t, s);")  # now we get the right answer
(sqrt(%pi)*%e^(1/(4*s)))/(2*s^(3/2))
```
PS I get the same behavior in a command-line maxima session (correct answer when the domain is "real" and 0 when the domain is "complex").
