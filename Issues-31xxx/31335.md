Follow-up from #31132:

It has been reported that it's still leaking with the upgraded python3 from homebrew that includes https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/commit/784d29205ee5bd27fed226a5f96837428e171825


The `sagelib` build collects many `-I`, `-L` directives through pkgconfig. 
Such directives on the command line take precedence over the search paths set by `sage-env` in `$CPATH`, `$LIBRARY_PATH`.
Now if `-I/usr/local/` or `-L/usr/local` (instead of more specific paths to `/usr/local/Cellar/.../...`) appear, then unwanted packages that happen to be installed can leak in. 

However, here the problem is caused by homebrew installing a `distutils.cfg` that injects `/usr/local/include` into our include search path.
We fix the leak by switching to a modern configuration of setuptools.

This also affects `cysignals`, as reported in https://groups.google.com/g/sage-release/c/KdSKg6RdZok/m/91Ibwn8RAgAJ

+Follow-up from #31132:
+
+It has been reported that it's still leaking.
+
+The \`sagelib\` build collects many \`-I\`, \`-L\` directives through pkgconfig. 
+Such directives on the command line take precedence over the search paths set by \`sage-env\` in \`$CPATH\`, \`$LIBRARY_PATH\`.
+
+Now if \`-I/usr/local/\` or \`-L/usr/local\` (instead of more specific paths to \`/usr/local/Cellar/.../...\`) appear, then unwanted packages that happen to be installed can leak in.
+
+To check whether this comes in through \`pkg-config\`:
+
+\`\`\`
+for a in $(pkg-config --list-all | sed 's/ .*//;'); do printf "$a: "; pkg-config --cflags $a; printf "$a: "; pkg-config --libs $a; done
+\`\`\`
+
+To make sure that libraries installed in $SAGE_LOCAL (if set) take precedence over such leaks, we could essentially revert #29697, adding some refinements:
+- \`SAGE_LOCAL\` vs \`SAGE_VENV\`
+- make sure that if \`$SAGE_LOCAL\` is unset, nothing is added.
+
+Relevant tickets: #13348, #14709, #29562 (+), #29607 (+), #29697 (?), #31041 (~), #30818 (~), #30013 (~)

<a id='comment:24'></a>We can work around the existence of this `distutils.cfg` by using `setuptools` (#30912) - more specifically versions of `setuptools` that bring and use their own copy of distutils.

setuptools 49.6.0 (in Sage 9.3.beta6) does not; >=50.0.0 does; >=50.1.0 only does if `SETUPTOOLS_USE_DISTUTILS=local` is set. (https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/history.html#v50-1-0)

#31134 updates setuptools to 51.1.1.

<a id='comment:27'></a>OK, I had removed `/usr/local/include` from `CPATH` in my shell.

+Follow-up from #31132:
+
+It has been reported that it's still leaking with the upgraded python3 from homebrew that includes https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/commit/784d29205ee5bd27fed226a5f96837428e171825
+
+
+The \`sagelib\` build collects many \`-I\`, \`-L\` directives through pkgconfig. 
+Such directives on the command line take precedence over the search paths set by \`sage-env\` in \`$CPATH\`, \`$LIBRARY_PATH\`.
+Now if \`-I/usr/local/\` or \`-L/usr/local\` (instead of more specific paths to \`/usr/local/Cellar/.../...\`) appear, then unwanted packages that happen to be installed can leak in. 
+
+However, here the problem is caused by homebrew installing a \`distutils.cfg\` that injects \`/usr/local/include\` into our include search path.
+We fix the leak by switching to a modern configuration of setuptools.
+
+This also affects \`cysignals\`, as reported in https://groups.google.com/g/sage-release/c/KdSKg6RdZok/m/91Ibwn8RAgAJ
