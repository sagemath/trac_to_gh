Follow-up from #31132:

It has been reported that it's still leaking with the upgraded python3 from homebrew that includes https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/commit/784d29205ee5bd27fed226a5f96837428e171825


The `sagelib` build collects many `-I`, `-L` directives through pkgconfig. 
Such directives on the command line take precedence over the search paths set by `sage-env` in `$CPATH`, `$LIBRARY_PATH`.
Now if `-I/usr/local/` or `-L/usr/local` (instead of more specific paths to `/usr/local/Cellar/.../...`) appear, then unwanted packages that happen to be installed can leak in. 

However, here the problem is caused by homebrew installing a `distutils.cfg` that injects `/usr/local/include` into our include search path.
We fix the leak by switching to a modern configuration of setuptools.

This also affects `cysignals`, as reported in https://groups.google.com/g/sage-release/c/KdSKg6RdZok/m/91Ibwn8RAgAJ

There we go, it's another distribution bug in homebrew. It installs a `distutils.cfg` that injects the paths into our build.

homebrew has been struggling with this since at least 2014 - https://github.com/Homebrew/legacy-homebrew/issues/26272

We can work around the existence of this `distutils.cfg` by using `setuptools` (#30912) - more specifically versions of `setuptools` that bring and use their own copy of distutils.

setuptools 49.6.0 (in Sage 9.3.beta6) does not; >=50.0.0 does; >=50.1.0 only does if `SETUPTOOLS_USE_DISTUTILS=local` is set. (https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/history.html#v50-1-0)

#31134 updates setuptools to 51.1.1.

I was able to build successfully on Big Sur with the following packages installed via homebrew:

flint arb pari singular ecl maxima fplll

There's still the issue that documentation is not building using homebrew's python 3.9, https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/9EMs9h2i_H4, but I have no idea what's going on there.
