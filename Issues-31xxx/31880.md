We implement this TODO item in `RealSet._repr_`:

```
# Switch to u'\u222A' (cup sign) with Python 3
```

We also add `_latex_` methods to `RealSet` and `InternalRealInterval`, 
upstreaming and extending the change in https://github.com/mkoeppe/cutgeneratingfunctionology/commit/4c7fb7df9a92cdb2435028c7eb19d186ab4b58ee#diff-b4cd72590a22494dab392e336268a3c94ea5b0adeb6b5864bda0e2ad87c65323
