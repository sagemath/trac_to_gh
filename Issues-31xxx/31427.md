Currently `.dockerignore` is just a symlink to `.gitignore`, but the two files have rather different semantics - https://zzz.buzz/2018/05/23/differences-of-rules-between-gitignore-and-dockerignore/

Also, we have a small number of other `.gitignore` files in the tree - which, of course, do not have an effect on Docker.  In this ticket, we integrate them into the top-level `.gitignore` file. This solves immediate problems when building with `tox -e docker-...` from non-clean source trees with editable installs.

More work will be needed in follow-up tickets.
