We expose `MemoryAllocator` as an independent Python package.

Indeed, it doesn't depend on anything Sage-specific,
and it can be useful for other Cython projects.

In order to remove the dependency on `cysignals`, which
at the moment doesn't work on Windows without Cygwin, we
remove `sig_block`/`sig_unblock` from the allocation.
This seems not harmful as the allocation via `MemoryAllocator`
should not be called within `sig_on`/`sig_off` anyway.

```
[build-system]
requires = ["setuptools", "wheel", "Cython"]
build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"

I more or less copied it from pplpy.

I added dependencies and updated the links. What else is missing?

Note that the project is not on PyPi yet. I'm waiting for an ok of someone, that the prerelease is somewhat acceptable.
