We expose `MemoryAllocator` as an independent Python package.

Indeed, it doesn't depend on anything Sage-specific,
and it can be useful for other Cython projects.

In order to remove the dependency on `cysignals`, which
at the moment doesn't work on Windows without Cygwin, we
remove `sig_block`/`sig_unblock` from the allocation.
This seems not harmful as the allocation via `MemoryAllocator`
should not be called within `sig_on`/`sig_off` anyway.
