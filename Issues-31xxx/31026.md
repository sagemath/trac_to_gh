As the title says. Getting a `canonical_label` graph and then getting its `sparse6_string` actually returns the sparse6 encoding of the original graph.

See the following illustrative code:

```sage
sage: G = Graph([(0,1),(1,2),(2,3),(3,0),(0,2)])
sage: H = Graph([(0,1),(1,2),(2,3),(3,0),(1,3)]) # Last edge is different
sage: G == H
False
sage: G.is_isomorphic(H)
True
sage: G.sparse6_string()
':CcKV'
sage: H.sparse6_string()
':Cd`V'

# Trying to get the encoding of a canonical version of the graph does not work es expected
sage: G_ = G.canonical_label()
sage: H_ = H.canonical_label()
sage: G_ == H_ # The canonical versions are equal
True
sage: G_.sparse6_string() # The sparse6 encodings are NOT equal
':CcKV'
sage: H_.sparse6_string() # They are however equal to the ones of their respective original graphs
':Cd`V'

# This of course leads to the problem that loading a graph from the representation does not yield the original graph
# Works fine for the original graph
sage: Graph(G.sparse6_string(), loops=False, multiedges=False) == G
True
# Does not work for the canonical version
sage: Graph(G.sparse6_string(), loops=False, multiedges=False) == G
True
# The encoding of G_ is indeed the one of G
sage: Graph(G_.sparse6_string(), loops=False, multiedges=False) == G
True

# Explicitly creating a new graph works fine and returns the same encodings
sage: G__ = Graph(G.canonical_label().edges())
sage: H__ = Graph(H.canonical_label().edges())
sage: G__.sparse6_string()
':CoKI'
sage: H__.sparse6_string()
':CoKI'
```

False
sage: G.is_isomorphic(H)

'Cn'
sage: G_ = G.canonical_label()                                                                                                      
sage: H_ = H.canonical_label()

sage: G_.graph6_string()                                                                                                            
'C^'
sage: H_.graph6_string()                                                                                                            
'C^'
```

The reason is that `graph6_string` tries (actually, method `_bit_vector`) first to sort vertices and this is not done for `sparse6_string`.
Actually, before the switch to Python 3, vertices where most of the time sorted, but this is no longer possible (cannot sort objects of different types). 

With this patch, we get the behavior you expect

```sage
sage: G = Graph([(0,1),(1,2),(2,3),(3,0),(0,2)])
