Never mind. That broke a number of tests, and it doesn't appear to do what it should anyway. I will continue to look for other ways to do this.

So I've attempted to make a `sage.symbolic.expression.Expression.sgn` method which returns `giac.sgn(self)`. This causes one of the tests in `src.sage.symbolic.expression` to fail:

`sage: unicode_art(SR(1.3 - I))` should return `1.3 - ⅈ`, but it instead returns `1.3 - 1.0⋅ⅈ`. I'm not sure whether this really matters, especially since there are other tests in that same method which return `1.0⋅x` instead of `x`, but is a test that technically fails.

I have a feeling there may some other formatting tests that this may cause to fail, and I'm not sure why.
