We modify `MixedIntegerLinearProgram.new_variable` so that it remembers the variables.

To avoid reintroducing reference loops eliminated in #12616, we modify `MIPVariable` so that it no longer stores a reference to the MIP but rather to the `backend`, the `base_ring`, and the `linear_functions_parent`.

A new method `M.variables()` yields all `MIPVariable` instances that have been created using `M.new_variable()` in the order of their creation.


Depends on #20656
