The `MatrixSpace` class still has a `__call__()` method instead of `_element_constructor_()`.  This is relatively easy to change, and has the benefit that if `M` is a matrix space and `m` an element of `M`, then `M(m)` simply returns `m`.  This can be viewed as a small addendum to #23719.

One side effect of the attached branch is that the first argument (`entries`) is now effectively a mandatory non-keyword argument, and `copy` and `coerce` are keyword-only arguments.  This is probably a good thing for readability, though.
