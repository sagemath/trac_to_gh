Magma implements a command called `IsEasySnAn` to cheaply detect whether an irreducible polynomial of degree `n` over the rational has Galois group containing the alternating group on `n` letters. I believe this is based on a method of Davenport-Smith ("Fast recognition of alternating and symmetric Galois groups"). I propose to implement the same in Sage.

I should perhaps emphasize that the point here is to make the command blindingly fast. One important aspect of this is using distinct-degree factorization, rather than full factorization, of the reduction of the polynomial modulo a prime.
