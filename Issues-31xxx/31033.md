Magma implements a command called `IsEasySnAn` to cheaply detect whether an irreducible polynomial of degree `n` over the rational has Galois group containing the alternating group on `n` letters. I believe this is based on a method of Davenport-Smith ("Fast recognition of alternating and symmetric Galois groups"). I propose to implement the same in Sage.

Modulo the use of distinct-degree factorization (which should probably be its own ticket), here is an implementation of the Davenport-Smith method.
