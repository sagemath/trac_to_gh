Replying to [@jhpalmieri](#comment%3A5):
> Is it worth also making this change in `build/bin` also? (`sage-dist-helpers`, `sage-pip-install`, `sage-pip-uninstall`,

These pip calls already use `--no-index`, which implies `--disable-pip-version-check`.

> `sage-print-system-package-command`)

I don't think we should change this one: The output is (mostly) for informing/educating users, and it is better if we show the simplest possible command line there.
