These pip calls already use `--no-index`, which implies `--disable-pip-version-check`.

> `sage-print-system-package-command`)

Okay, looks good to me. Works as advertised and I don't see any downside, as long as we keep our `pip` reasonably up to date. (The warning serves as a reminder to update it, so we are losing that.)
