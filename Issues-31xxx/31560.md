  - #32168: Fix conversion between spaces of modular forms
  - #32349: Remove base ring attribute
- #32135: implement `to_polynomial` and `from_polynomial`
- #31512: ring of quasi-modular forms
  - #32336 Implement `to_polynomial`, `from_polynomial`
  - #32343 Implement Serre derivative for modular forms
  - #32357 Implement derivative of quasiforms and graded form
- #31898: typos and documentation of `modular/modform_hecketriangle`
- #32337: Implement conversion from q-expansion (with enough precision) to `GradedModularFormElement` and `QuasiModularFormElement`
- #32366: the q-bracket and related functions, the Bloch-Okounkov theorem.
