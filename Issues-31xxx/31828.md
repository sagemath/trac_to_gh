Some magma functions (e.g. `IsSquare`) return a variable number of arguments depending on the answer.

```
magma: a, b := IsSquare(5);
magma: a;
false
magma: assigned b;
false
magma: a, b := IsSquare(4);
magma: a;
true
magma: assigned b;
true
```

In the interface from Sage, if you specify 2 return values when only one is produced it will die.

```
sage: magma.IsSquare(4, nvals=2)                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
(true, 2)
sage: magma.IsSquare(5, nvals=2)
...
Runtime error in :=: Illegal undefined assignment for LHS index assignment
```

I propose that it returns `None` in this setting.
