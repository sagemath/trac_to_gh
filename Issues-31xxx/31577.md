In the current layout, these embedded source trees are a little difficult to find / complicated to type.

The proposed location is:

```
SAGE_ROOT
- pkgs
  - sage-conf
    - setup.py
    - bin/
    - sage_conf.py.in
  - sage-docbuild
    - setup.py
    - sage_docbuild   -> symlinks to SAGE_ROOT/sage_docbuild/
  - sage-sws2rst
    - setup.py
    - bin/
    - sage_sws2rst/
  - sagemath-standard
    - setup.py
    - bin             -> symlinks to SAGE_ROOT/src/bin/        
    - sage            -> symlinks to SAGE_ROOT/src/sage/
    - sage_setup      -> symlinks to SAGE_ROOT/src/sage_setup/ (removed in #29847)
```
that is, the new directory `pkgs` will be on the same level as 

```
SAGE_ROOT
- src
```
the unchanged monolithic sagelib source tree, which will continue to contain subdirectories

```
  - bin/ 
  - doc/
  - sage/
  - sage_docbuild/      # was sage_setup/docbuild/ in Sage 9.2
  - sage_setup/ 
```

We add symlinks from the previous locations `SAGE_ROOT/build/pkgs/sage[math]_*/src` to the new locations `SAGE_ROOT/pkgs/sage[math]-*`

#29847 will add:

```
SAGE_ROOT
- pkgs
  - sage-setup
    - setup.py
    - sage_setup         -> symlinks to src/sage_setup/
```
and remove `sage_setup` from the `sagemath-standard` distribution.

Other modularization tickets (#29705) will add

```
SAGE_ROOT
- pkgs
  - sagemath-core/
  - sagemath-brial/
  - sagemath-giac/
  - sagemath-meataxe/
  - sagemath-tdlib/
```
etc.

#29868 will add

```
SAGE_ROOT
- pkgs
  - sagemath-doc-html/
  - sagemath-doc-pdf/
```

**All files that contain Sage doctests will remain in the monolithic `src/` source tree;** the source trees of the distributions symlink there.  This may be changed in a follow-up ticket regarding the modularization of doctesting.


Before merging this branch into a non-distclean worktree, it is useful to use 

```
  git clean -f -x build/pkgs/*/src
```

Alternatively, these directories could just be put into SAGE_ROOT:

```

Would it make sense to reverse this: put the files in `SAGE_ROOT/sage_docbuild` and then make `SAGE_ROOT/src/sage_docbuild` into a link? Is there any reason to keep `SAGE_ROOT/src/sage_docbuild`? If so, why also create the top-level directory?

What about `SAGE_ROOT/src/sage_setup`, along the same lines?

This is a great question.

There is no technical reason for keeping `SAGE_ROOT/src/sage_docbuild` at all.
Likewise, after #29847, there will be no technical reason for keeping `SAGE_ROOT/src/sage_setup`.

But in #29705, I promised not to change the structure of the source tree, which I interpret as keeping the monolithic tree `SAGE_ROOT/src` unchanged.  It is so that we don't overwhelm the developer community by making too many changes at the same time. 

Of course, it could be argued that `sage_docbuild` is a new name anyway, and very few people will know or care about this package.

So if you think that's better, I can just move the `sage_docbuild` sources to `SAGE_ROOT/sage_docbuild/sage_docbuild` on this ticket.

(I'd rather not put reverse symlinks.)

> I really don't like that kind of changes. In sage-on-distro `SAGE_SRC` becomes `SAGE_LIB` at runtime when `SAGE_ROOT` is undefined. That would break things there. Not to mention I am against introducing more `SAGE_ROOT` outside of the build system as a matter of principle. As Matthias says modularization of doctesting is a separate issue and that's what would be most appropriate there.


I think that on distros, `have_git` will be false (it tests whether `SAGE_ROOT/.git` exists), so this block, and the resulting doctests, will be skipped entirely.

One of the goals of that particular method is to exclude files if in a distro. I don't know enough about distros to know if the method is well-implemented, though. (I didn't write it.)

Some related questions about this ticket: how does this new organization affect distros, and should we be doctesting any of the pieces that are being moved to `SAGE_ROOT`?

`sage-sws2rst` has its own simple test script, not related to the Sage doctester.

The other packages do not have separate tests but are doctested as part of the Sage.
The assumption is here that the doctester is run after all of these packages are installed. This assumption would continue to hold even as the modularization goes forward. I don't really have a plan for modularizing the doctesting, other than #30778.

As far as I am concerned, anything living under `build/pkgs/` should have a separate tarball and be installed as a separate package. This has been somewhat challenged by the way Matthias is conducting the modularization. But that's the goal at the end of the day. If it is there it is not supposed to be anything special anymore. 

That being said `sage_conf` is being a pain because it is still very special as far as I can see. It still need a real SAGE_ROOT tree. But that is a different conversation and ticket.

That's right, after this ticket, `SAGE_ROOT/sage-docbuild`, `SAGE_ROOT/sage-sws2rst`, `SAGE_ROOT/sagemath-standard`, and `SAGE_ROOT/sage-conf` are standard source trees of Python distribution packages, containing nothing that is specific to Sage-the-distribution. 

It is possible to build sdists from each of these source trees using `setup.py sdist`, and wheels using `setup.py bdist_wheel`. 

Actually also `sage-conf` has the same status: You can build an sdist or a wheel from it. However, this version of `sage-conf` is not useful for putting it on PyPI. #29039 and #31396 create separate versions of `sage-conf` that are suitable for distribution.

This is probably the best solution and it is also incredibly dirty once you get QA and multi-python support involved. In short this is cheap and easy if your packaging is somewhat ad hoc. Once you want this to go inside a framework with rules, there is a higher price than you may expect.
