The documentation of the package modular/modform_hecketriangle contains some typos in the documentation and inconsistencies regarding the official [SageMath](SageMath) conventions. Here is the documentation of this package:

[https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/modfrm_hecketriangle/index.html](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/modfrm_hecketriangle/index.html)

Moreover, it would be desirable to add some reference and explain how to use the package more deeply. Indeed, the code here seems independent of the original modular forms implementation but use a different approach for its implementation.  Thus, it can be confusing to use for someone who is already familiar to the original implementation of modular forms (by "original implementation" I mean the one in modular/modform).

Therefore, the goal of this ticket is to review the documentation, fix the typos and add references. 

**Remark**: the package modform_hecketriangle was originally implemented in 2013 by Jonas Jermann (see the ticket #16134).

What is the reason for capitalization here
