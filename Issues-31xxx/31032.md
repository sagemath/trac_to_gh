BAck in sage 9.1 we had issues with building pdf docs because of missing raw strings. 

Some issues that were also happening in vanilla sage have been fixed and merged but sage-on-gentoo continued to carry a few extra ones.

This ticket is to merge those leftovers.

I'd have to check, things were not failing on it so I may not have paid as much attention to it as I should have. But it does look suspicious.

I introduced those back in sage 8.3 in fact, 9.1 is the latest time it was rebased. https://github.com/cschwan/sage-on-gentoo/issues/509

And it was glossed over because it didn't cause anything to break. But it probably looks weird. I'll look at it tomorrow.
