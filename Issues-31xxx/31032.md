Some issues that were also happening in vanilla sage have been fixed and merged but sage-on-gentoo continued to carry a few extra ones.

I'd have to check, things were not failing on it so I may not have paid as much attention to it as I should have. But it does look suspicious.

I introduced those back in sage 8.3 in fact, 9.1 is the latest time it was rebased. https://github.com/cschwan/sage-on-gentoo/issues/509

And it was glossed over because it didn't cause anything to break. But it probably looks weird. I'll look at it tomorrow.
