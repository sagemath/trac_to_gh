... the current code is confused about pypa-normalized names vs. spkg-normalized names:

```
$ ./sage -package update-latest importlib_metadata

    self._init_type()

    with open(os.path.join(self.path, 'type')) as f:
IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: u'/Users/mkoeppe/s/sage/sage-rebasing/worktree-algebraic-2018-spring/build/pkgs/importlib-metadata/type'
```

We also update the code so that it uses the files `checksums.ini` and `install-requires.txt` to recognize normal Python packages. 

As a result, the interface has changed slightly:

- `sage --package update-latest :all:` now also updates optional and experimental packages
- use `sage --package update-latest :standard:` for (a better version of) the previous behavior

We also fix `sage --package fix-checksum` so it does not trip over non-normal packages.
