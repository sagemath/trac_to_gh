```
The current generic implementation of `_richcmp_` of morphisms relies on certain assumptions that does not hold in general, and may give mathematically wrong answers. For example, 

```
sage: S.<a,b> = QQ['a,b'].quotient('a*b')
sage: R.<x> = S[]
sage: f = R.hom([b], R)
sage: g = R.hom([b], R) * R.hom(S.hom([-a, b], S), R)
sage: f == g  # should be False
True
```

The aim of this ticket is to reimplement or refactor morphism infrastructure to make comparison of morphisms robust.

This is a sequel to #28617.

Comment of Markus:

>It may be necessary to separate the implementations for rings and modules. For rings, it is enough to check that f and g agree on the generators of the ring and, recursively, on the generators of the base ring. For modules, I am not so sure – maybe we need to restrict to the case of module homomorphisms and raise a `NotImplementedError` otherwise.

Well, maybe the class `RingHomomorphism` is not the right place to add this code since I realized that a lot of ring homomorphisms do not derive for this class. Here are a few examples:

```
sage: from sage.rings.morphism import RingHomomorphism
sage: isinstance(ZZ.hom(Zmod(6)), RingHomomorphism)
False

sage: R.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: isinstance(R.coerce_map_from(ZZ), RingHomomorphism)
False
```

Should we change this? Or put the comparison code at the level of categories? Other ideas?

But it doesn't seem to be that obvious: for instance, `RingMap` (which is explicitly defined as the set of set-theoretic maps between rings in the documentation) derives from `Morphism` and not from `Map`. Is this a bug or is there some subtlely behind it?

`RingMap` is there just to provide the common name "Set-theoretic ring". I think the adjective "set-theoretic" is meaningless as all ring morphisms are set-theoretic. I guess `RingMap` could equally be `RingMorphism` but the author seems to have preferred `RingMap` as the class name.

There could be a performance reason for it as we really want some important rings to have really fast maps (but not necessarily morphisms) between them. I don't know of an explicit example of this, but this might be a reason. Another is that it is just old code that is in need of cleanup.

I had a discussion with David Roe on zulip about this ticket.

The starting point of our discussion is the observation that there are currently two concurrent systems for handling the different types of morphisms provided by Sage: the class hierarchy and the category framework. This causes confusion and sometimes contradiction.

We believe that it would be great to clarify the situation and clearly separate the roles of these two systems. Roughly speaking, our proposal is to use the class hierarchy to handle different types of implementations and let the category stuff handle mathematical properties of the morphisms.

In this perspective, we do not want to keep the class `RingHomomorphism` for instance, but want to move the methods therein to the category. Contrarily having special classes for coercion maps or for maps whose domains are polynomial rings continues to make sense.

Any class can implement its own `_richcmp_` method if there is a good reason for (typically a very simple way to compare morphisms of this type). However, a `_richcmp_` method should be also provided by the category and it will be used as a fallback if the class does not provide any specific implementation (or if it returns `NotImplemented`). (Maybe it would be a good idea to have different names for those methods, e.g. `_richcmp_class` and `_richcmp_category`, especially since inheritence with the special method `_richcmp_` seems to work very bizarrely.)

The same approach could also be used for compositions.

Since this touches a lot of things in the structure of morphisms in Sage, I would appreciate to have your feedback before starting to write code.

Oh yes, I saw your comment but forgot to answer.
Since basically the class `RingMap` does nothing more than `Map` except redefining `_repr_type`, I can't believe there is a performance issue here.

But I agree with you that in general we have to be very careful about this.

That's a good point.

I think it makes sense at least for some categories.
For instance, equalities of ring homomorphisms can be checked by comparing the images of the generators. Again, I might be wrong but I suspect that in most cases, the objects in Sage are finitely generated, so if we have enough information about the underlying structure (which is a priori encoded in the category), implementing a reliable comparison test sounds feasible.

OK. Thanks for the clarification.
I previously encountered several issues with inheritance of rich comparisons, but it was probably because I was using directly `__richcmp__`.
