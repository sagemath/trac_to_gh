As an example of a curve "from the wild" (well, it's still constructed, but it was encountered somewhere else, and apart from rational bitangents it probably doesn't have particular properties that are relevant for its periods):

```
P2.<X,Y,Z>=ProjectiveSpace(QQ,2)
f=X^4 - 2*X^3*Y + 5*X^2*Y^2 + 4*X*Y^3 + Y^4 + 2*X^3*Z - 5*X^2*Y*Z - 9*X*Y^2*Z - 6*Y^3*Z - 3*X^2*Z^2 - X*Y*Z^2 + 7*Y^2*Z^2 + 6*Y*Z^3 + Z^4
C=Curve(f)
S1=C.riemann_surface(prec=500,integration_method="heuristic")
S2=C.riemann_surface(prec=500,integration_method="rigorous")
```
The first one completes about 76 seconds, doing (according to prun) 41627 function evaluations. Interestingly enough, there are 49 line_integral calls and 67 calls to integrate_vector_N, indicating that the interval splitting is very modest in this case, but as you can see, has great effect.

The second one completes in 554 seconds, doing (according to prun) 121052 function evaluations. A large part of that difference is probably computing integration nodes (based on the evaluations, we'd expect about three times the run time).

So, I think this code is a big improvement, and I'm expecting that we can turn to "rigorous" as our default strategy.

**EDIT**: as pointed out in #9, the numbers are swapped. `S1` takes longer, with more evaluations and `S2` takes less time, with less evaluations.

I think you have the two cases reversed, on my machine I get that `S1.period_matrix()` takes about 387s with 121052 function calls, while `S2.period_matrix()` takes 53s with 41627 function calls.

In my tests it seems the "heuristic" method is still faster for low precisions and "easy" integration paths. As one increases the precision, it seems that "rigorous" starts to win out.

I think in the introduction documentation of the module, you'll have to add a section explaining what the different integration methods do and briefly explain what the benefits and draw-backs of the methods are.

Otherwise, the present code looks pretty good!

---
line 1519, _bounding_data:

Perhaps describe the input and output a little more unambgiously. Introducing notation may help:

for input:
- differentials are specified as by `cohomology_basis`.

Output is a tuple (Rzw, [(g, dgdz, F, a0_info), ...]) where:
- Rzw is a polynomial in z and w over the base ring of the defining equation
- the list has a tuple for each differential, in order
- g is a rational function in the quotient field of the parent of the defining polynomial of the curve such that
  g dz represents the differential
- dgdz is the derivative of g with respect to z, but now represented in Rzw
- F is the minimal polynomial of g over z (represented as a bivariate polynomial in z and g
- a0_info is a tuple (a0L, [r,...]) where describing the leading coefficient of F in g (which is itself a polynomial in z):
  a0L is its leading coefficient (as a complex number) and the r is a list of the roots, listed with multiplicity.

Note the awkward description of g. Perhaps put it in Rzw instead.

To illustrate the names used (and the fact that we're forcing the names z,w,g for the variables here), perhaps use x,y in the example instead, so that the difference is visible.
Also, perhaps display S.cohomology_basis() so that it's clearer what the relation is with the data given here. You should probably explain that the "1" given there stands for 1/(df/dw), as the output shows.

line 1577 rigorous_line_integral:

The reference "Developed by Gao" needs adjustment. Perhaps describe: bounding an algebraic integrand on a circular domain using Cauchy's form of the remainder in Taylor approximation combined with Fujiwara's bound on algebraic functions. (see [Bruin-DisneyHogg-Gau, in preparation] ) or something like that.

Certainly "Gao" is an entirely unhelpful reference :-)

line 1619: allow for tolerance on the numerical output here. Also note that the labelling of the upstairs edge is entirely arbitrary, so this doctest is liable to break in the future.
(there are other tests in this file like that and it's probably hard to fix this).

line 1629: I think you can comment more positively here: the reason to make `differentials` available separately is so that a fast-callable version can be supplied, which
speeds up the evaluation of the integrands significantly. This is also why the differentials are all represented relative to the same denominator (df/dw).

line 1646: "it's" -> "its"

line 1659: float literals can be tricky: in library code they will be actual python "float" objects. "0.5" is explicitly representable, so it's fine here. The 0.912 is probably approximate anyway, so it doesn't matter.
 
line 1672: can you put a comment in that explains what this loop does? i.e., cover the line segment along which we'll be integrating with ellipses inscribed in circles that avoid branch points? and that the loop continues to bisect the line segments until each fits in such an ellipse?

Wow. I tried some random examples. For hyperelliptic curves it seems heuristic (for low precisions) is often faster than than rigorous. Exchanging the roles of x, y for those generally leads to very high degree covers, which I guess is not so good for Fujiwara, so that didn't seem to be such a great thing to do for rigorous either.

However, when we more to general plane curves (a quartic here):

```
f = -3*y^4 + 3*y^3*x + 2*y^2*x^2 + 4*y*x^3 - 4*x^4 - y^3 - 4*y^2*x + 2*y*x^2 + x^3 - 3*y^2 - 2*y*x + x^2 - 4*x + 4
```
the results become quite striking!

```
%time B=Sh.riemann_matrix()  # heuristic
CPU times: user 1min 11s, sys: 1.06 ms, total: 1min 11s
Wall time: 1min 11s

%time B = Sr.riemann_matrix()  # rigorous
CPU times: user 5.67 s, sys: 4.99 ms, total: 5.68 s
Wall time: 5.71 s
```
This timing is with a warmed-up cache for integration nodes: the first run took more than 2 minutes.

For hyperelliptic curves one shouldn't be using this code anyway, so I think "rigorous" might actually be a better default setting.

We're getting there! Some knock-on corrections:

Line 400: "approximately half" -- that's only the case if the two methods eventually use about the same number of nodes to compute the answer they return.

Some more polishing, if you don't mind.

Please use two spaces before `#` for inline comments.

Both in example blocks for `# random` and `# abs tol`, etc.,
and for regular code such as:

```diff
-        KP = PolynomialRing(k, 'W') # W->fraction field
+        KP = PolynomialRing(k, 'W')  # W -> fraction field
```

In the `_bounding_data` docstring's OUTPUT block,
add a blank line before the itemized list.

Consider using comprehension syntax here:

```diff
-        integral_dict = dict()
-        for upstairs_edge in occurring_edges:
-            integral_dict[upstairs_edge] = line_int(upstairs_edge)
+        integral_dict = {edge: line_int(edge)
+                         for edge in occurring_edges}
```

Comparison operators `==`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`
want a space on each side. Here:

```diff
-        if integration_method=="heuristic":
+        if integration_method == "heuristic":
             line_int = lambda edge: self.simple_vector_line_integral(edge,fcd)
-        elif integration_method=="rigorous":
+        elif integration_method == "rigorous":
```

This line can now be removed.

```diff
-        integral_dict = dict()
         integral_dict = {edge: line_int(edge) for edge in occurring_edges}
```

PEP 8 recommends putting operators
(such as `+` or `or`) after a line break:

- https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#should-a-line-break-before-or-after-a-binary-operator

in case you want to change this block and similar ones:

```diff
-                        if ((a_in_arg < b_in_arg < a_out_arg) or
-                                (b_in_arg < a_out_arg < a_in_arg) or
-                                (a_out_arg < a_in_arg < b_in_arg)):
+                        if ((a_in_arg < b_in_arg < a_out_arg)
+                            or (b_in_arg < a_out_arg < a_in_arg)
+                            or (a_out_arg < a_in_arg < b_in_arg)):
```

Sorry for holding the ticket with minor things,
feel free to set back to positive review at any point.

```

What I can do is cd into src, and run `tox -- sage/schemes/riemann_surfaces/riemann_surface.py`, which runs with all tests passed (though it did pick up the typos before I fixed those). Indeed, running the test leading to `(RM_S - rm).norm() < (RM_T - rm).norm()` manually in the command line interface or in a notebok succeeds for me. Running `-t --long` does raise error for the `%time` syntax too, which I will edit, but still doesn't fail on the period matrix test. 

What are your system details? Perhaps that will be illuminating, as I don't know enough about the lint badges to know how to use them to diagnose a problem.

So far I tested on macOS 10.14.6 with
lots of packages installed via Homebrew.

If I find time I can also test on Cygwin,
Debian and Ubuntu (and more via tox).

Ok, I am using Ubuntu 18.04.04, so it's possible that this is a system issue, I think I should be able to test on a macOS so will try and check that.

Indeed it is, because it's line magic in IPython, which isn't active during doctesting (indeed, the doctest environment, while it pretends to test sage input, isn't identical to the actual interactive environment, so you may need to adjust code for doctests a bit so that it executes correctly).

In this case, `time` is hard to access, because it's entirely wrapped up in `IPython`s environment. Closest thing is `timeit`, which is available as a function in sage. So then to display times one can do:

```
        sage: A2.<x,y>=QQ[]
        sage: C=Curve(y^2-x^4-1)
        sage: S=C.riemann_surface()
        sage: timeit("S.period_matrix()", number=1, repeat=1)
```
The statement gets executed in a local scope, so normal assignments wouldn't capture the return value. In this case, the period_matrix is available for cheap afterwards thanks to caching. In general, something like

```
sage: L=[None]
sage: timeit("L[0]=expensive_result()", number=1, repeat=1)
sage: L[0]
```
might be required if capturing the returned object is desired.

No, the problem is in how the doctest is formulated:

```
sage: rm=(-1+I*sqrt(3))/2
sage: M=matrix(1,1,[rm.n(200)])
sage: (M-rm).norm()
1.1102230246251565e-16

The problem is that `rm` lives in the symbolic ring. `M` is a float matrix with high precision, because the precision is explicitly requested. When you construct `M-rm` you get a matrix over the symbolic ring. Apparently `norm` then asks for a numerical result, to standard precision [no precision is requested] and apparently, `rm` computed to 53 bits does not agree with `rm` computered to 200 bits and then rounded to 53 bits. In fact:

```
sage: (M-rm).norm().parent()
Real Double Field
```
so we did end up with system floats ... which are a little more susceptible to architecture-dependent peculiarities. They shouldn't be if they are properly IEEE ...

About tox: it is a powerful tool for testing.

It can help build and test Sage in various
operating systems via Docker:

- [Sage 9.1 release tour > Portability > For developers](https://wiki.sagemath.org/ReleaseTours/sage-9.1#For_developers)

The `sage --tox` option runs the tests and a few extra
tools to check code style and spelling.

- [Sage 9.2 release tour > Testing and linting with tox](https://wiki.sagemath.org/ReleaseTours/sage-9.2#Testing_and_linting_with_tox)
- [Sage 9.3 release tour > Cleaning of the Sage codebase to conform to best practices](https://wiki.sagemath.org/ReleaseTours/sage-9.3#Cleaning_of_the_Sage_codebase_to_conform_to_best_practices)

In [Trefethen, 2008] equation (4.14) is
`|I-I_n|\leq \frac{64 M}{15(1-\rho<sup>{-2})\rho</sup>{2n+2}`
which is attributed to [P. Rabinowitz, Rough and ready error estimates in Gaussian integration of analytic functions, Comm. ACM, 12 (1969), pp. 268‚Äì270.: Equation 18] and [H. Brass, Quadraturverfahren, 1977: Theorem 90]. The Rabinowitz reference is readily available.

I don't think there is a contradiction between (3.11) and (3.25): it looks like (3.25) receives some more advanced arguments. It's certainly not claimed to be derived from (3.11) directly. It may be worth checking if the extra +2 in Trefethen's version gives a further improvement (and if it's correct!)

Trefethen is using a modification of equation (19) from Rabinowitz, which I have checked and get the same answer, so there is the room for this modification (which, now that this ticket is closed, I will add on to #32297). You are right the equations don't follow directly, hence the reason the factors are not identical.
