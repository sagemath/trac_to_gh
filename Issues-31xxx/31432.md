Polynomial rings over finite fields have a method `polynomials`
to return a generator of polynomials of given degree or of given maximal degree.

We add an option `monic` (defaulting to `False`)
so that `monic=True` only generates monic polynomials.

Not hard to do oneself but so convenient it deserves to be offered.
