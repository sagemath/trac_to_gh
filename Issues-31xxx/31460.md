The `add_condition` method of ` IndexFaceSet` was implemented considering a simple division (N) of the intersecting edges. I included straightforward modification, by implementing the bisection method.  The former parameter N is redefined now to mean the maximum steps in the bisection method. There is also a user-defined precision target (default eps = 1.0e-6). The result is a much more continuous boundary.

**Keywords:** Intersection, triangular surface, IndexFaceSet, add_condiction
