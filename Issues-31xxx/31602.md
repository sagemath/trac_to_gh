Redesign of #31396 that does not need to put a huge wheel on PyPI

- huge wheel `sage_root_with_var_tmp_symlink` and wheels for all Python package linking to libraries there are published on https://github.com/sagemath/sage-wheels/releases (no size limit)

- `sage_conf` (sdist and wheel) declares install_requires that @ to the URLs within https://github.com/sagemath/sage-wheels/releases



Depends on #31396
