too many failed tests, not using stored timings
```

Also other environments are affected.

We fix it by doing what was first proposed in #30474:
change `sage --coverage` so that it can invoke `sage --coverageall` if necessary. Then we get rid of `sh -c` (which causes the quoting bug) for all "sagedirect" environments.

because `args.filename` is a list and then `sage --coverage --all src/sage/geometry/polyhedron/base.py` does not work anymore.

Once done, you can put this on positive review on my behalf.
