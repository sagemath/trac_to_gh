From [Ask Sage question 57195: Incorrect symbolic sum with binomial coefficients](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/57195).

This sum of binomials (expressed in two ways) is incorrect:

```
sage: t, n, k = SR.var('t, n, k')
sage: sum(t^(k - 1)*binomial(n - 1, k - 1), k, 1, n)  # incorrect
0
sage: sum(t^(k)*binomial(n - 1, k), k, 0, n - 1)  # incorrect
0
```
Expected in both cases: `(t + 1)^(n - 1)`.

These somewhat similar (but different) sums are correct:

```
sage: sum(t^(k - 1)*binomial(n, k - 1), k, 1, n + 1)
(t + 1)^n
sage: sum(t^(k)*binomial(n, k), k, 0, n)
(t + 1)^n
sage: sum(t^(k - 1)*binomial(n, k - 1), k, 1, n)
(t + 1)^n - t^n
sage: sum(t^(k)*binomial(n, k), k, 0, n - 1)
(t + 1)^n - t^n
```

Details and workaround in Emmanuel Charpentier's answer
to [Ask Sage question 57195](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/57195).

My hunch is that the problem lies with the management of non-atomic arguments by `binomial`, but I haven't a clue on how to explore this.

Suggestions ?

<div id="comment:3" align="right">Comment 3</div>

Contrary to what is said in the description, the "equivalent sum obtained by shifting the summation index" is **not** correct. In the equivalent sum, the top of the binomial coefficient needs to stay at `n-1`, not change to `n`:

```
sage: sum(t^(k)*binomial(n-1, k), k, 0, n-1)
0
```
I don't know what is going on, but here is some additional data.  In this example, only `j=-1` is wrong:

```
sage: for j in range(-3, 4):
....:     j, sum(t^k * binomial(n + j, k), k, 0, n + j)
....:
(-3, sum(t^k*binomial(n - 3, k), k, 0, n - 3))
(-2, sum(t^k*binomial(n - 2, k), k, 0, n - 2))
(-1, 0)
(0, (t + 1)^n)
(1, (t + 1)^(n + 1))
(2, (t^2 + 2*t + 1)*(t + 1)^n)
(3, (t^3 + 3*t^2 + 3*t + 1)*(t + 1)^n)
```
But in this example, all of the negative values of `j` are wrong:

```
sage: for j in range(-3, 4):
....:     j, sum(t^k * binomial(n + j, k), k, 0, n)
....:
(-3, (t + 1)^n)
(-2, (t + 1)^n)
(-1, (t + 1)^n)
(0, (t + 1)^n)
(1, (t + 1)^(n + 1) - t^(n + 1))
(2, (t^2 + 2*t + 1)*(t + 1)^n - ((n + 2)*t + t^2)*t^n)
(3, (t^3 + 3*t^2 + 3*t + 1)*(t + 1)^n 
    - 1/2*(2*(n + 3)*t^2 + 2*t^3 + (n^2 + 5*n + 6)*t)*t^n)

> Contrary to what is said in the description, the "equivalent sum obtained by shifting the summation index" is not correct. In the equivalent sum, the top of the binomial coefficient needs to stay at n-1, not change to n:

Oh yeah ?

```
sage: var("n, t, j, k, n1, k1")
(n, t, j, k, n1, k1)
sage: foo = sum(t^k*binomial(n-1, k-1), k, 1, n, hold=True)
sage: foo.unhold() # doubleplus ungood...
0
sage: foo.maxima_methods().changevar(k1==k-1, k1, k).unhold() # doubleplus ungood again...
0
sage: foo.maxima_methods().changevar(k1==k-1, k1, k).subs(n==n1+1).unhold() # better
(t + 1)^n1*t
sage: foo.maxima_methods().changevar(k1==k-1, k1, k).subs(n==n1+1).unhold().subs(n1==n-1) # better, and expressed in terms of the original variable
(t + 1)^(n - 1)*t
```

A little numerical check won't hurt :

```
sage: foo.subs(n==5).unhold().factor() # Binomial has no problem with numerical values ==> reference
(t + 1)^4*t
sage: foo.maxima_methods().changevar(k1==k-1, k1, k).unhold().subs(n==5) # 0.subs(n==5) is still 0...
0
sage: foo.maxima_methods().changevar(k1==k-1, k1, k).subs(n==n1+1).unhold().subs(n1==n-1).subs(n=5) # Correct...
(t + 1)^4*t
```

As for the extension to other offset values :

```
sage: sum(t^(k-j)*binomial(-j + n, -j + k), k, j, n) # Sage doesn't compute this
sum(t^(-j + k)*binomial(-j + n, -j + k), k, j, n)
sage: sum(t^(k-j)*binomial(-j + n, -j + k), k, j, n, hold=True).maxima_methods().changevar(k1==k-j, k1,  k).subs(n==n1+j).unhold().subs(n1==n-j) # same transformation as before
(t + 1)^(-j + n)
sage: sum(t^(k-j)*binomial(-j + n, -j + k), k, j, n, algorithm="giac") # giac concurs
(t + 1)^(-j + n)
sage: sum(t^(k-j)*binomial(-j + n, -j + k), k, j, n, algorithm="mathematica") # so does Mathematica
(t + 1)^(-j + n)
```

Numerical checks left to the reader as an exercise...

It turns out that Sage can (awkwardly but) correctly solve the general case, and gets the special cases wrong. Premature optimization ?

//Note :// the quantities you have computed are *not* those sought for by the original author. Re-read your code...

<div id="comment:5" align="right">Comment 5</div>

I'm sorry if I wasn't clear.  Replacing `n` with `6` in the original sum gives:

```
sage: sum(t^(k - 1)*binomial(6 - 1, k - 1), k, 1, 6)
t^5 + 5*t^4 + 10*t^3 + 10*t^2 + 5*t + 1
```
But replacing `n` with `6` in the "equivalent" sum gives:

```
sage: sum(t^(k)*binomial(6, k), k, 0, 6-1)
6*t^5 + 15*t^4 + 20*t^3 + 15*t^2 + 6*t + 1
```
This is not the same answer, which means that the two sums are mathematically different. On the other hand, replacing `n` with `6` in the sum I suggested gives:

```
sage: sum(t^(k)*binomial(6-1, k), k, 0, 6-1)
t^5 + 5*t^4 + 10*t^3 + 10*t^2 + 5*t + 1
```
This is the same answer as the original sum, and (unless I made a mistake) it will give the same answer for all values of `n`. I thought that was what we wanted, so that is why I said that `n-1` should not be changed to `n`. I apologize if I was not clear about what I meant, or if I misunderstood what you were trying to say.

My other examples were not intended to be directly related to the original question. However, since they are slightly different, and present some additional situations, I thought they might (but only might) help locate the bug. I don't think I need to re-read my code -- it acts exactly as I intended -- but I'm sorry if it wasted your time because I didn't explain my intentions properly.

I think this is a maxima bug, after all:

```

I confirmed this by testing directly in maxima:

For comparison:

```

sage: symbolic_sum(t^(k-1)*binomial(n - 1, k - 1), k, 1, n, algorithm='giac')
(t + 1)^(n - 1)

sage: symbolic_sum(t^(k-1)*binomial(n - 1, k - 1), k, 1, n, algorithm='sympy')

AttributeError: Unable to convert SymPy result (=Piecewise((t*(t + 1)**(n - 1), ((Abs(t) <= 1) & (re(n) - 1 > 0)) | ((Abs(t) < 1) & (re(n) - 1 <= -1)) | (Ne(t, -1) & (Abs(t) <= 1) & (re(n) - 1 <= 0) & (re(n) - 1 > -1))), (Sum(t**k*binomial(n - 1, k - 1), (k, 1, n)), True))/t) into Sage

I don't have mathematica, so I didn't test `algorithm='mathematica'`, but it gave the correct result in [comment:4](#comment%3A4), so it must be fine.

You may be right :

> (%o9)	0

By the way, addressing the general case :

```
sage: var("t, n, k, j");
sage: sum(t^(k - j)*binomial(n - j, k-j), k, j, n)
sum(t^(-j + k)*binomial(-j + n, -j + k), k, j, n)

The latter can be (penibly) generalized as :

```
sage: from sympy import sympify, Sum as SSum
sage: %time SSum(*map(sympify, (t^(k - j)*binomial(n - j, k-j), (k, j, n)))).doit().simplify().args[0][0]._sage_()
CPU times: user 13.6 s, sys: 0 ns, total: 13.6 s
Wall time: 13.6 s
(t + 1)^(-j + n)
```


> I don't have mathematica,

which isn' *that* hard to steal ;-)

Apologies for an earlier misleading edit to the
ticket description. If I understand correctly,
the sum earlier described as an "equivalent sum
obtained by shifting the summation index" is
indeed correctly computed, but not equivalent
to the buggy one. Description amended now.
