Prompted by a build failure of `r` on `cygwin-standard` in  https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/1915093157

```

```
we make it possible to disable R using a configure options so that one can get a working Sage installation in this way.

(The original build failure has hopefully resolved been resolved by #29537.)

Again we have a problem with `r`. As `cygwin` is one of our supported platforms and `r` is a standard package, this is a blocker.

(More problems with R are around the corner, for wheel builds of Sage - #31396.)


This justifies another round of discussion for the proposal to downgrade the `r` and `rpy2` to "optional" packages - after #29486, #29170, https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/IX3niEdmCEM/m/LovmF6gmIwAJ

In #29170, @novoselt pointed out that supporting R is important for SageMathCell; and @kiwifb mentioned that "Suddenly dropping R/rpy2 feels rough. However, we don't have usage data to know how rough it would be."

I think that we do need a bit of substantiation here given to make the case of keeping R supported as a standard package - and its cost of maintenance. Note that our R is also nontrivially patched and an update to the 4.x series is overdue, and nobody has stepped up to do this upgrade.

Maybe this is asking for a new type of package: standard on some platforms, optional on others.

I have been "using" the system's R for a while now ("using" mean that Sage doesn't build it, not that I actually use it for anything). Can we distribute binaries that will use a system R installation? (Maybe this is a bad question, because at least on OS X, can we distribute functioning binaries in the first place?)

rpy2 3.4.x has wheels for macOS - https://pypi.org/project/rpy2/#files

We should find out with what installation of R these wheels are supposed to work - hopefully R's official binary packages that are on CRAN - see https://mirror.las.iastate.edu/CRAN/

There are two doctests in `sage/repl/ipython_tests.py` that run R.

Tests for `_r_init_` in `sage/structure/sage_object.pyx`, I note interfaces for other optional packages (octave, mathematica, polymake...) do not have tests.

That's all that I can see and think of right now.

If addition of standard packages requires a mention on sage-devel then IMHO removal should, too...

Also, doesn't pass the testsuite:

This ticket is about the very concrete problem that R does not build on one of our standard platforms, Cygwin, and we are not able to use the system R either.

Because failing standard packages block the entire build, we either need to fix it, or downgrade it from standard before the 9.3 release.

Aaaaarghhh...

This would be a documentation nightmare (explaining why a ticket is "optionally optional" is awkward at the very minimum...). It would also "froze" the idea of Windows 10 being a "second-class citizen" as far as Sage is concerned.

I'm starting to consider promoting a WSL2 port as the preffered windows platform,and preparing a deprecation of the Cygwin port, which remains necessary as long as Windows 
 versions <10 remain relevant only as rthe "sanest" way out of this predicament ("sane" being an hyperbole, of course...).

But this also should be discussed on `sage-devel`. Hence this [post](https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/alkG4veIsBk/m/AtNQ1KCMBgAJ)...

Cool, thanks for the pointer.  I don't have chocolatey installed, but I did the equivalent using apt-cyg and the (very nice) `sage-get-system-packages` command.

Of course if there's something *very* specific to the way chocolatey is installing the packages then that's a problem and I'll have to dig deeper.  Seems unlikely?

Fresh Cygwin install.  I installed all the `:standard:` packages recommended by `sage-get-system-packages`.

Ran `./bootstrap` then `./configure` with no additional arguments.  Then ran `make r`.

First it builds and installs OpenBLAS.  Several hours later it builds and installs R with no problem.

I am downloading the build artifacts from the [GitHub](GitHub) build to see if there are any more detailed logs about the R build there...

So the end result is on [GitHub](GitHub) R is not linking with openblas:

```
  External libraries:          readline, curl
  Additional capabilities:     PNG, JPEG, TIFF, NLS, ICU
  Options enabled:             shared R library, shared BLAS, R profiling

  Capabilities skipped:        cairo
  Options not enabled:         memory profiling
```

Whereas on my local build it has:

```
  External libraries:          readline, BLAS(OpenBLAS), LAPACK(generic), curl
  Additional capabilities:     PNG, JPEG, TIFF, NLS, ICU
  Options enabled:             shared R library, R profiling

  Capabilities skipped:        cairo
  Options not enabled:         shared BLAS, memory profiling
```

And the build error is occurring somewhere related to building R's baseline BLAS which AFAIK I've never tested on Cygwin since it always successfully links with OpenBLAS.

Now the question is just why is the double complex check failing?

Unlikely. Chocolatey really just calls cygwin's `setup_....exe` many times.

```

But this looks more like a problem in the make check.  Why is it trying to link to some `../cygopenblas_skylakexp-r0.3.13.a` when the build produced `cygopenblas_haswellp-r0.3.13.a` not skylake?

Probably not related though...

Here is the relevant part in the R configure that checks for double complex support in the BLAS lib: https://github.com/wch/r-source/blob/78f3b069d6269ddde40d76515a1eef67df674435/m4/R.m4#L2642

There is a note in there:

```
dnl Now check if zdotu works (fails on AMD64 with the wrong compiler;
dnl also fails on macOS with Accelerate/vecLib and gfortran; 
dnl but in that case we have a work-around using USE_VECLIB_G95FIX)
```

I don't know what they mean by that.  What is "the wrong compiler" in this case?

Perhaps we could just toss in a patch to disable this check and see what happens?

I tried manually building the `conftest.f` from R's configure check and got this warning:

```
$ gfortran -c conftest.f
conftest.f:15:72:

   15 |  10      ztemp = ztemp + zx(i)*zx(i)

Warning: Fortran 2018 deleted feature: DO termination statement which is not END DO or CONTINUE with label 10 at (1)
```

And in fact this was fixed upstream just a few months ago: https://github.com/wch/r-source/commit/b2e1bf7ee4a42288b56d77080ad942395b2fe4b0#diff-519bfce994ea1571b861581c2c200f396eb96ad94ba9bc74f20103dc1bda38dc

I applied the upstream fix and the warning went away.  Maybe somewhere `-Werror` is getting set in `FFLAGS`.

I figured out that it's possible to download the failed R build artifacts from GH (very nice, thank you).  Unfortunately the `config.log` does not say anything very helpful here:

```
configure:38593: checking whether double complex BLAS can be used
conftestf.f:15:72:

   15 |  10      ztemp = ztemp + zx(i)*zx(i)
      |                                                                        1
Warning: Fortran 2018 deleted feature: DO termination statement which is not END DO or CONTINUE with label 10 at (1)
configure:38674: result: no
```

Something the way the test is written it's not producing useful output.  It looks like the fortran compilation succeeds, with the warning, but only as a warning.  Probably the C compilation (or linking?) fails.  But it's not producing any output to the log.  I still can't reproduce a failure in this locally.

I rebuilt openblas locally with `SAGE_CHECK=yes` and the checks passed.

This was linking against the OpenBLAS that was included in the build artifacts from [GitHub](GitHub).  If I link against my locally built OpenBLAS it works.

So the problem is again OpenBLAS, and apparently the fact that the OpenBLAS from the stage-i-a build artifacts is not portable, and possibly running on different CPUs between jobs?

I see that now.

But looking again at the openblas build log from GH one of the first lines output, from the `echo` in `spkg-install.in`, is:

```
Building OpenBLAS: make
```

This should say:

```
Building OpenBLAS: make DYNAMIC_ARCH=1
```

So somewhere along the way the setting is being lost...

The simple bug was -- as you correctly suspected -- in my CI script. The testing is done through tox, which does not pass through environment variables (except for those explicitly configured to be passed through).

This was done in #30375.  Both `SAGE_FAT_BINARY` and the option `--enable-fat-binary` are respected at `configure` time and are made persistent for the build through `build/bin/sage-build-env-config`. Mixing in the environment variable set at `make` time is not done; I don't think this is a problem.

Both `SAGE_FAT_BINARY` and the option `--enable-fat-binary` are respected at `configure` time and are made persistent for the build through `build/bin/sage-build-env-config`. Mixing in the environment variable set at `make` time is not done; I don't think this is a problem.


Still, it used to be possible to set it when running `make` as well.  I guess it's not so important, but it feels like a regression, and was confusing to me.

I think it's common practice to only show one of `--enable-...` and `--disable-...` depending on what is the default. 

For our optional packages, I think we decided to list both because of the perhaps unusual semantics of `--disable-...` uninstalling a previously installed optional package.
