```
Analysis of the bug reported in #31530 revealed that evaluating a series inside a hold context can yield incorrect results or a crash:

```
sage: a,b,c = var("a b c")
sage: f(x) = (a + b*x).series(x, 2)
sage: print(f"f(c) = {f(c)},    f(1) = {f(1)}")
f(c) = b*c + a,    f(1) = a + b
sage: with hold: 
....:     print(f(c)) 
b*(c)
sage: with hold: 
....:     print(f(1))

<segmentation fault>
```
This bug was present at least as far back as v9.1. The segmentation fault seems to be from running out of memory.

I have tentatively rated this ticket as a blocker because it gives wrong results in a quite simple situation, but perhaps we will soon see that its impact is limited.

The other three calls to `handle_factor` in the pynac source code are essentially no-ops, so they should be removed.  I opened #31608 for this.

I opened #31607 for fixing the `f(1)` segmentation fault.
