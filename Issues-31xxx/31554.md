```
Analysis of the bug reported in #31530 revealed that evaluating a series inside a hold context can yield incorrect results or a crash:

```
sage: a,b,c = var("a b c")
sage: f(x) = (a + b*x).series(x, 2)
sage: print(f"f(c) = {f(c)},    f(1) = {f(1)}")
f(c) = b*c + a,    f(1) = a + b
sage: with hold: 
....:     print(f(c)) 
b*(c)
sage: with hold: 
....:     print(f(1))

<segmentation fault>
```
This bug was present at least as far back as v9.1. The segmentation fault seems to be from running out of memory.

<a id='comment:20'></a>This is a known bug on 32-bit.  (See #31585.)  In commit [96b0f8b](https://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/commit/?id=96b0f8bd3c791f533989d92d026e9558fa880a5c) of ticket #31479, I added a `# 32-bit # known bug` tag to this line of the output. (And the tag shows up in the branch of this ticket, even though it's not in the expected output of the failed doctest.) Was that the wrong thing to do? I don't know much about doctesting and I couldn't find any examples to emulate in the sage source code.

How are we supposed to handle the doctest in this situation where 32-bit gives a wrong answer? (64-bit works correctly.)
