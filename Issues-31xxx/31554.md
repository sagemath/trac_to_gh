Analysis of the bug reported in #31530 revealed that evaluating a series inside a hold context can yield incorrect results or a crash:

```
sage: a,b,c = var("a b c")
sage: f(x) = (a + b*x).series(x, 2)
sage: print(f"f(c) = {f(c)},    f(1) = {f(1)}")
f(c) = b*c + a,    f(1) = a + b
sage: with hold: 
....:     print(f(c)) 
b*(c)
sage: with hold: 
....:     print(f(1))

<segmentation fault>
```
This bug was present at least as far back as v9.1. The segmentation fault seems to be from running out of memory. 

Depends on #31479

Here is an example that seems very strange to me. Does the `()` in the final line mean that something returned `None` instead of `0`?

```
sage: f(x) = (cos(a + x) + b*x).series(x,2)
sage: f
x |--> (cos(a)) + (b - sin(a))*x + Order(x^2)
sage: with hold: 
....:     print(f(0))
(b - sin(a))*()
```
I have tentatively rated this ticket as a blocker because it gives wrong results in a quite simple situation, but perhaps we will soon see that its impact is limited.

The disappearance of `a` has nothing to do with series. There is a bug in the handling of `x^0`:

```
sage: a,b,c = var("a b c")
sage: with hold:
....:    print((a*x^0).subs({x:c}))
....:    print((a*x^0 + b*x^1).subs({x:c}))
0*a

The purpose of pynac's `handle_factor` method is to help convert `0*x` to `0` and `x^0` to `1`. The `print(f(c))` bug in the ticket description is a result of the fact that `handle_factor` erroneously converts `x^0` to `0`, instead of `1`.  The PR fixes the two places where this problem occurs, by eliminating the call to `handle_factor`.  

The other three calls to `handle_factor` in the pynac source code are essentially no-ops, so they should be removed.  I opened #31608 for this.

I opened #31607 for fixing the `f(1)` segmentation fault.
