This was raised at [Ask Sage question 55698](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/55698).

Number fields have an iterator to yield all elements of bounded global height.  This is used in an incorrect way to enumerate points of bounded height on projective space: in `schemes.projective.projective_space` the iterator `points_of_bounded_height` appears to iterate over all points whose projective coordinates all have height less than the given bound -- this is not just wrong, it is not well-defined.  Similarly, in `schemes.projective.projective_point` the global height of a point is incorrectly implemented as the max of the heights of its coordinates -- again, not well defined.

Hi, I updated my code and added some docs (see the `.py` file here https://github.com/8d1h/RationalPoints/)

The global height is implemented without log, since this gives the precise value for rational numbers.

The rational point enumeration method uses elimination and is a lot faster than the current available algorithms (see the documented examples).

Hi! Sorry I was going to fix this but I didn't quite figure out how the whole trac thing works.

For doctests, I put two of them in my file.

```
sage: P = ProjectiveSpace(QQ, 2)
sage: P(1/1,2/3,5/8).global_height()
2.77258872223978
sage: F.<u> = NumberField(x^3-5)
sage: P = ProjectiveSpace(F, 2)
sage: P(u,u^2/5,1).global_height()
0.536479304144700
```

These are the current wrong results: they should be log(24) and 1.07295860828940 respectively.

I guess you could try Magma at http://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/calc/

```
P := ProjectiveSpace(Rationals(),2);
p := P ! [1/1,2/3,5/8];
Log(HeightOnAmbient(p:Absolute));

R<x> := PolynomialRing(Integers());
F<u> := NumberField(x^3-5);
P := ProjectiveSpace(F,2);
p := P ! [u,u^2/5,1];
Log(HeightOnAmbient(p:Absolute));
```
although there are some differences in conventions, hence the `Log` and `:Absolute`.

The functionality looks good to me.

We have an issue with return types.

```
sage: P.<x,y,z> = ProjectiveSpace(QQ,2)
sage: Q = P.point([4, 4, 1/30])
sage: type(Q.global_height())
<class 'sage.symbolic.expression.Expression'>
```

While sometimes we return a real number. Since the function previously returned a real number, we shouldn't change the return type.

Since this a function already included in Sage, we can't change it's return type without somehow deprecating the function.

Additionally, it seems we can't return the exact answer in all cases - some answers are still inexact. Having different types returned from the same function with the same parameters is bad practice.

So here I do prefer the inexact answer. It would be nice to return an exact answer, but I don't think it's possible here.

I recently came across this bug in the height functions as well as a couple other height bugs. This ticket did fix the the incorrect values I was seeing in global_height().

I'm trying to see if the other issues already have tickets opened too. Was there a ticket opened for the projective points of bounded height iterator? I couldn't find one when I searched trac.

Thanks.
