This was raised at [Ask Sage question 55698](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/55698).

Number fields have an iterator to yield all elements of bounded global height.  This is used in an incorrect way to enumerate points of bounded height on projective space: in `schemes.projective.projective_space` the iterator `points_of_bounded_height` appears to iterate over all points whose projective coordinates all have height less than the given bound -- this is not just wrong, it is not well-defined.  Similarly, in `schemes.projective.projective_point` the global height of a point is incorrectly implemented as the max of the heights of its coordinates -- again, not well defined.

Hi, I updated my code and added some docs (see the `.py` file here https://github.com/8d1h/RationalPoints/)

The global height is implemented without log, since this gives the precise value for rational numbers.

The rational point enumeration method uses elimination and is a lot faster than the current available algorithms (see the documented examples).

Hi! Sorry I was going to fix this but I didn't quite figure out how the whole trac thing works.

For doctests, I put two of them in my file.

```
sage: P = ProjectiveSpace(QQ, 2)
sage: P(1/1,2/3,5/8).global_height()
2.77258872223978
sage: F.<u> = NumberField(x^3-5)
sage: P = ProjectiveSpace(F, 2)
sage: P(u,u^2/5,1).global_height()
0.536479304144700
```

These are the current wrong results: they should be log(24) and 1.07295860828940 respectively.

I guess you could try Magma at http://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/calc/

```
P := ProjectiveSpace(Rationals(),2);
p := P ! [1/1,2/3,5/8];
Log(HeightOnAmbient(p:Absolute));

R<x> := PolynomialRing(Integers());
F<u> := NumberField(x^3-5);
P := ProjectiveSpace(F,2);
p := P ! [u,u^2/5,1];
Log(HeightOnAmbient(p:Absolute));
```
although there are some differences in conventions, hence the `Log` and `:Absolute`.

(BTW I was trying to use Sage to check these values for my computation in Macaulay2 in the first place, and it turned out that the function is not correctly implemented...)

While sometimes we return a real number. Since the function previously returned a real number, we shouldn't change the return type.

Since this a function already included in Sage, we can't change it's return type without somehow deprecating the function.

Additionally, it seems we can't return the exact answer in all cases - some answers are still inexact. Having different types returned from the same function with the same parameters is bad practice.

So here I do prefer the inexact answer. It would be nice to return an exact answer, but I don't think it's possible here.

I recently came across this bug in the height functions as well as a couple other height bugs. This ticket did fix the the incorrect values I was seeing in global_height().

I'm trying to see if the other issues already have tickets opened too. Was there a ticket opened for the projective points of bounded height iterator? I couldn't find one when I searched trac.

Thanks.
