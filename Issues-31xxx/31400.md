This was raised at [Ask Sage question 55698](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/55698).

Number fields have an iterator to yield all elements of bounded global height.  This is used in an incorrect way to enumerate points of bounded height on projective space: in `schemes.projective.projective_space` the iterator `points_of_bounded_height` appears to iterate over all points whose projective coordinates all have height less than the given bound -- this is not just wrong, it is not well-defined.  Similarly, in `schemes.projective.projective_point` the global height of a point is incorrectly implemented as the max of the heights of its coordinates -- again, not well defined.

Hi, I updated my code and added some docs (see the `.py` file here https://github.com/8d1h/RationalPoints/)

The global height is implemented without log, since this gives the precise value for rational numbers.

The rational point enumeration method uses elimination and is a lot faster than the current available algorithms (see the documented examples).

I have ported the code for global_height from "gh-8d1h" git repo. No idea if this is correct and better than before.

Hi! Sorry I was going to fix this but I didn't quite figure out how the whole trac thing works.

For doctests, I put two of them in my file.

```
sage: P = ProjectiveSpace(QQ, 2)
sage: P(1/1,2/3,5/8).global_height()
2.77258872223978
sage: F.<u> = NumberField(x^3-5)
sage: P = ProjectiveSpace(F, 2)
sage: P(u,u^2/5,1).global_height()
0.536479304144700
```

These are the current wrong results: they should be log(24) and 1.07295860828940 respectively.

I guess you could try Magma at http://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/calc/

```
P := ProjectiveSpace(Rationals(),2);
p := P ! [1/1,2/3,5/8];
Log(HeightOnAmbient(p:Absolute));

R<x> := PolynomialRing(Integers());
F<u> := NumberField(x^3-5);
P := ProjectiveSpace(F,2);
p := P ! [u,u^2/5,1];
Log(HeightOnAmbient(p:Absolute));
```
although there are some differences in conventions, hence the `Log` and `:Absolute`.

(BTW I was trying to use Sage to check these values for my computation in Macaulay2 in the first place, and it turned out that the function is not correctly implemented...)

The functionality looks good to me.

We have an issue with return types.

```
sage: P.<x,y,z> = ProjectiveSpace(QQ,2)
sage: Q = P.point([4, 4, 1/30])
sage: type(Q.global_height())
<class 'sage.symbolic.expression.Expression'>
```

While sometimes we return a real number. Since the function previously returned a real number, we shouldn't change the return type.
