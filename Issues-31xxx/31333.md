(extracted from and needed for #29865)

`sage_include_directories` returns the basic list of include directories for compiling extensions, not including directories obtained through pkgconfig etc.  This basic list includes directories supplied by numpy. This is fine for the monolithic Sage library because `numpy` is a standard package; but in the course of modularization, we will have various distributions that do not need the dependency on numpy. 
We use try/expect around the import and call to numpy.
