This ticket has grown from its initial motive and now solves multiple problems related with Sage rich output. In particular, it 

- fixes the blocker #31513
- fixes the %matplotlib notebook magic, which is broken in a %display latex context in Sage 9.2
- performs some code improvement regarding the handling of mathjax

The patch has been quite tested with Jupyter notebooks involving various types of Sage objects, Matplotlib objects and ipywidgets. 

The initial motive, which is the root of the solutions, is

---
Presently mathjax is coupled with latex in Sage. The coupling causes dilemmas because latex is for printing and mathjax is for rendering math in html. We encounter such a dilemma in solving #11362, for example.

This ticket takes mathjax from `sage.misc.latex` and place it properly in `sage.misc.html`.

The command `view(obj)` is used to view the latex representation of an object.  This ticket aims to make  `show(obj)` and `pretty_print(obj)` show the html+mathjax representation of the object. The html+mathjax representation can be made from the latex representation or given by `_html_` method of the object.

While we are at it, we also cleaned up old code written for deprecated sage notebook.

Right.

I agree. Though I had decided to follow the deprecation path, now I give up.

I think we can make a compromise. We make the clear distinction between latex representation and html(+mathjax) representation internally or on code level but we keep `%display latex` for end users. 

I will commit a patch soon.

The same code also fails on sage 9.3.beta9 without this ticket.

It works for me, both with sage 9.2 and 9.3.rc0 (note that it does not work if `%display latex` is set first).

FWIW, for `plt.show()`, the following happens in `SageDisplayFormatter.format`:

```
        # use IPython display for IPython native objects
        if isinstance(obj, IPYTHON_NATIVE_TYPES):     <== this test is passed
            if self.ipython_display_formatter(obj):   <== this test fails
                return {}, {}                         
```
Hence the `return {}, {}` is not performed.

No. My system is MacOS 11.2.3 with Chrome 89.0.4389.90. 

I tried to install jupyter-matplotlib extension with jupyterlab 2 and jupyterlab 3. All did not work.

By the way, it works with Python 3 kernel in jupyterlab.

`self.ipython_display_formatter(obj)` is an ipython native method. which has nothing to do with sage `%display` magic. I don't understand why it fails with `%display latex` but it works with `%display plain`.

No, it fails with `%display plain` as well. All subsequent tests in `SageDisplayFormatter.format` also fail, so at the end

```
        return ipy_format, ipy_metadata
```
is achieved. The same thing happens with Sage 9.3.rc0 (i.e. outside this ticket branch), but for some reason, the output `ipy_format, ipy_metadata` is better handled in that case, so that the pyplot window opens.

Strange... On my side, I haven't any special setting regarding matplotlib (it's the default version included in Sage). 

Regarding CoCalc, I've just got the answer from William: it works with Sage 9.2 kernel but you have to start a "Jupyter classic server" (in the "New" menu).

Does it work without installing jupyter-matplotlib extension?

I created a new Ubuntu vm, and installed a fresh sage from source, and installed jupyter-matplotlib from the jupyter extension manager. Even then it doesn't work and shows the same message `Javascript Error: IPython is not defined`. Now even with Python3 kernel.

Thanks for the new code. The pyplot window is now correctly handled. Unfortunately, two new issues have appeared: 

1/ Outside the context `%matplotlib notebook`, there is no graphical display of `plt.show()`: the output of the Jupyter cell

```
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot([1, 2, 3, 4])
plt.ylabel('some numbers')
plt.show()
```
is

```
<Figure size 432x288 with 1 Axes>
```
instead of a png figure displayed by the notebook.

2/ The native IPython rich output method `_repr_latex_` is broken:

```
class A(SageObject):

    def __init__(self, data):
        self._data = data

    def _repr_latex_(self):
        try:
            return '$' + self._data._latex_() + '$'
        except (AttributeError, NotImplementedError):  
            return None  # if None is returned, plain text is used

A(sin(x^2))
```
results in 

```
<__main__.A object at 0x7f0566d4a940>
```
instead of the latex-typeset formula.

These two issues were not present in the previous version of the patch, nor in plain Sage 9.3.rc0.

Note that there cannot be two interactive pyplot windows in two distinct cells of a given Jupyter notebook; if you open a new window via `plt.show()` in a new cell, the first one becomes blank (in the same cell, it is OK). This might explain what you observe.

Because of your last paragraph, I think this can't be a blocker for 9.3: it should be one of the first tickets merged in 9.4 instead.

 Presently mathjax is coupled with latex in Sage. The coupling causes dilemmas because latex is for printing and mathjax is for rendering math in html. We encounter such a dilemma in solving #11362, for example.
 
 This ticket takes mathjax from `sage.misc.latex` and place it properly in `sage.misc.html`.
