Currently, the point transform matrix method is slow over fields such as QQbar, and does not work over precision fields such as the reals.

We implement a different approach based on linear algebra which improves performance over QQbar and works over precision fields. We replace the old approach as our update is an improvement in all cases. As our updated method works over rings, we moved the method to projective space over a ring.

We also add an optional normalize parameter, which over a field normalizes the last non zero entry of the returned matrix to be 1.

<a id='comment:7'>Comment 7:</a>
A few comments here.

- why is this based of off #31896?

- Documentation fixes

`Given a projective space of dimension n -> Given a projective space of dimension n`

`finds -> find`

`If the base ring is a field, the matrix is normalized so that the last nonzero entry in the last row is 1.`

- In the examples, there is a left action defined for matrices on projective points, so you only need to do

```
[m*points_source[i] == points_target[i] for i in range(4)]
```

- add some white space to examples like

```
sage: P1.<a,b,c>=ProjectiveSpace(RR, 2)
sage: points_source=[P1([1,4,1]),P1([1,2,2]),P1([3,5,1]),P1([1,-1,1])]
sage: points_target=[P1([5,-2,7]),P1([3,-2,3]),P1([6,-5,9]), P1([3,6,7])]
sage: P1.point_transformation_matrix(points_source, points_target)
```


- probably worth adding a citation of some kind. This is a standard calculation, but a citation is harder to pin down. I guess you could use my thesis Proposition 2.16 which works out all the details.

```
@phdthesis{Hutz,
  author =   {Benjamin Hutz},
  title =    {Arithmetic Dynamics on Varieties of Dimension Greater Than 1},
  school =  {Brown University},
  year =     {2007},
}
```


-What happened here

works:

```
R.<t> = FunctionField(QQ)
P.<a,b> = ProjectiveSpace(R,1)
points_source = [P([-6*t,7]), P([2,4]), P([3,2])]
points_target = [P([-1,2*t]), P([0,2]), P([-1,6])]
P.point_transformation_matrix(points_source, points_target)
```

ZeroDivisionError:

```
R.<t> = FunctionField(CC)
P.<a,b> = ProjectiveSpace(R,1)
points_source = [P([-6*t,7]), P([2,4]), P([3,2])]
points_target = [P([-1,2*t]), P([0,2]), P([-1,6])]
P.point_transformation_matrix(points_source, points_target)
```

This may be part of a larger issue with non-exact fields. 

```
R.<t> = CC[]
P.<a,b> = ProjectiveSpace(R,1)
points_source = [P([-6*t,7]), P([2,4]), P([3,2])]
points_target = [P([-1,2*t]), P([0,2]), P([-1,6])]
m=P.point_transformation_matrix(points_source, points_target, normalize=False)
[m*points_source[i] == points_target[i] for i in range(3)]
[False, False, False]
```
same for RR,RIF, CIF (Qp seems ok)

even just plain CC has issues

```
P.<a,b> = ProjectiveSpace(CC,1)
points_source = [P([-6,7]), P([1,4]), P([3,2])]
points_target = [P([7,-12]), P([4,2]), P([2,6])]
m=P.point_transformation_matrix(points_source, points_target)
[m*points_source[i] == points_target[i] for i in range(3)]
[False, True, True]
```

Complex Inteval field just gives weirdness

```
P.<a,b> = ProjectiveSpace(CIF,1)
points_source = [P([-6,7]), P([1,4]), P([3,2])]
points_target = [P([7,-12]), P([4,2]), P([2,6])]
m=P.point_transformation_matrix(points_source, points_target)
[m*points_source[i] == points_target[i] for i in range(3)]
[False, True, True]
```


You may just need to exclude non-exact fields.

Fixed the documentation issues.

As for the issues with non-exact fields, normalizing was causing issues, as CIF can't distinguish 1*10<sup>-13</sup> from 0. I stopped normalizing if the field is not exact. This shouldn't interfere with existing functionality, as this function did not previously work with non-exact fields. This fixes the CIF example:


```
P.<a,b> = ProjectiveSpace(CIF,1)
points_source = [P([-6,7]), P([1,4]), P([3,2])]
points_target = [P([7,-12]), P([4,2]), P([2,6])]
m=P.point_transformation_matrix(points_source, points_target); m
[          0.?e-14 0.33333333333334?]
[0.66666666666667?           0.?e-14]
```


The zero division error seems to be caused by CC[] thinking it is an exact field, as function fields do not implement an is_exact() method.

I added a warning saying that over non-exact fields, the matrix may be far from correct.

This fixes the issues that are fixable. The ZeroDivisionError seems to not be an issue in any of your code, that is just a problem with .inverse() over that ring. So we'll leave that as is.

The inexact solution I think is as good as it can get. Checking `==` for these points isn't really the best mechanism. Looking more closely they are differing only be precision errors in the examples I tried. So, I'm ok with the behavior being exhibited.

Just one issue
- the warning box is not formatting correctly in the documentation. I think it is just the space before the `::`
