In SageMath 9.3:

```
sage: R.<a> = Zq(4)
sage: b = a - a
sage: b.trace()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
AttributeError: 'sage.rings.padics.qadic_flint_CR.qAdicCappedRelativeElement' object has no attribute 'ground_ring'
```
The attached branch fixes this and also changes a few instances of "norm" to "trace" in the docstring of `trace_unram()`.
