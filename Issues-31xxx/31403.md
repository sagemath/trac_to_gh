giac uses `libnauty` if it finds it, so it should be an optional dependency.

Also, giac uses `cliquer` if it finds it, see https://groups.google.com/g/sage-release/c/R-8gvElDIUo/m/tHvIEdaQAAAJ

We add these missing dependencies.

Follow up: if `libnauty` is not configured to be installed (nor present as a system package), then we should disable its use by `giac`. The corresponding test in `giac`'s configure script is not robust - it explicitly checks in `/usr/local`; which may be disabled on macOS using `-isysroot`.

<a id='comment:12'></a>I am just looking at the configure script for `giac`

```
AC_CHECK_LIB(cliquer,main) 
AC_CHECK_LIB(nauty,main)
AC_CHECK_HEADERS(nauty/naututil.h)
```
It is all automagic. I am fairly sure the `libcliquer` detection is there so that when nauty is found the `libcliquer` flags are properly included too. Notice how no headers are checked for `cliquer`, just adding the library for linking.

If it used a vendored libcliquer we won't be seeing this bug reported.
According to https://ubuntu.pkgs.org/21.10/ubuntu-universe-amd64/libnauty2_2.7r1+ds-2_amd64.deb.html `libcliquer` is "Required".
