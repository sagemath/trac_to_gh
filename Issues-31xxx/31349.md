part of #31295 (Meta-ticket: Replace imports from deprecated distutils).

We fall back to distutils if setuptools cannot be imported. 
In this way we avoid having to declare `setuptools` as an `install_requires` of `sagelib` (for now).

Looks okay to me. Is there a reason to not "declare `setuptools` as an `install_requires` of `sagelib`"?
