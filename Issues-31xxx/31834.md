From #29683.

We change name `equalities` to `equations`, which is mostly used for internals and documentation.

We have the equation always last.

We make `CombinatorialFace.ambient_H_indices`, `CombinatorialFace.ambient_Hrepresentation` and `CombinatorialFace.n_ambient_Hrepresentation` consistent.

Keywords: **Hrepresentation, combinatorial polyhedron**

`ambient_H_indices`: 
- Lines 684-685 with `add_equations=True`?
- Might be good to move the block `Add the indices of the equation::` (Lines 677-685) to Line 660--, for clear comparison with the above?
- Line 692 `cdef size_t n_facets, n_equations` is not used anymore. Remove it?

Everything else looks great to me.

Please feel free to set to Positive review once the Status badges becomes green.
