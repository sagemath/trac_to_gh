From #29683.

We change name `equalities` to `equations`, which is mostly used for internals and documentation.

We have the equation always last.

We make `CombinatorialFace.ambient_H_indices`, `CombinatorialFace.ambient_Hrepresentation` and `CombinatorialFace.n_ambient_Hrepresentation` consistent.

Looks great to me!

Some small suggestions:
- Doctests of `def ambient_H_indices(self, add_equations=True)`: It would be good to test with `add_equations=False` and `add_equations=True` on a polyhedron that has equation (e.g. on the first `P = polytopes.permutahedron(5)`). The second `P =polytopes.cyclic_polytope(4,6)` has no equation, so it doesn't show a difference. I'm also curious if `add_equations` always appends larger indices no matter the backend is `field` or `ppl`.
- `if add_equations and self._ambient_facets:` probably should be two if's, so that `not self._ambient_facets and add_equations and self._equations` does not result in `equations = ()`?
- Docstring of `Hrepr`: the description is unclear, but since it's deprecated, maybe it doesn't matter.

Yes, why wouldn't it. It counts the number of facets and then appends indices. The equations are taken out of the Hrepresentation in `base.pyx`.

I really don't think it matters. It's deprecated for one hear already and has only been with us for one release total. Only there in case someone used it at some point.

`ambient_H_indices`: 
- Lines 684-685 with `add_equations=True`?
- Might be good to move the block `Add the indices of the equation::` (Lines 677-685) to Line 660--, for clear comparison with the above?
- Line 692 `cdef size_t n_facets, n_equations` is not used anymore. Remove it?

Everything else looks great to me.

Please feel free to set to Positive review once the Status badges becomes green.
