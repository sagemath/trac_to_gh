```
This patch changes the implementation of WordMorphism.growing_letters to be less sophisticated but faster.

```
sage: m = WordMorphism('a->aa,b->bc,c->def,d->fe,e->df,f->gh,g->hh,h->')
sage: %timeit m.growing_letters()
24.7 µs ± 74.3 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10000 loops each)
```
vs.

```
sage: %timeit m.growing_letters()
7.89 ms ± 84 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops each)
```
It also adds a method for returning "immortal" letters (letter a is mortal for a morphism s if there exists an integer k>0 such that s<sup>k</sup>(a) = ε).

Component: **combinatorics**

Keywords: **words**

On second thought, what do you think about replacing:

```
if not self.is_endomorphism():
```
with something like:

```
if not set(self.codomain().alphabet()).issubset(self.domain().alphabet()):
```
so that one doesn't have to manually specify the codomain in cases like this:

```
WordMorphism('a->b,b->c,c->d,d->c', codomain=Words('abcd')).growing_letters()

Indeed. Is there a name for functions `f: A -> B` with `B` included in `A`?

I would just call it an endomorphism as the only difference is a promise that the image is smaller than all of `A`.

It is a bit like calling a matrix with more rows than column a square matrix :)

```
sage: WordMorphism('a->a,b->b,c->a').incidence_matrix()
[1 0 1]
[0 1 0]
```

I will see why this is not consistent.

I agree fundamentally with your point, but not a generic example. I would argue that if there is a canonical way of embedding the image, I think we can allow the abuse. ;)

-1 on this. This would break the composition `f: A -> B` and `g: B -> C` if `A < B` but `C` is some other unrelated set of words that is not defined on all of `A`.

I don't think it would in practice due to the way `__mul__` is implemented:

```
def __mul__(self, other):
    r"""
    Returns the morphism ``self``\*``other``.
    ...
    """
return WordMorphism(dict((key, self(w)) for key, w in other._morph.items()), codomain=self.codomain())
```
and for example:

```
sage: f = WordMorphism('a->a,b->a', codomain=FiniteWords('ab'))
sage: g = WordMorphism('a->0')
sage: g * f
WordMorphism: a->0, b->0
```

All in all, I don't mind either of these approaches. I also noticed that in the docs of `is_endomorphism` there already is:

```
Returns ``True`` if the codomain is a subset of the domain.
```
And hence that `is_endormophism` did work with subsets in some point, but this was changed in #8920 due to not being mathematically accurate.

Maybe I was unclear. What I suggested is to change

```
sage: WordMorphism('a->a,b->a').codomain()
Finite words over {'a'}
```
to

```
sage: WordMorphism('a->a,b->a').codomain()
Finite words over {'a', 'b'}
```

The keyword `codomain` will not disappear and still allows you to build any kind of morphism you want

```
sage: WordMorphism('a->a,b->a', codomain=FiniteWords('a')).codomain()
Finite words over {'a'}
```

I think it is still somewhat relevant to the ticket at hand, so we should see if we can come to a consensus.

That is what I understood your proposal to be, but I am thinking of the following situation:

```
sage: I = WordMorphism('a->a,b->b')  # The identity map
sage: f = WordMorphism('a->x')                                                            
sage: I.domain()
Finite words over {'a', 'b'}
sage: I.codomain()
Finite words over {'a', 'b'}
sage: f.domain()
Finite words over {'a'}
sage: f.codomain()
Finite words over {'x'}
sage: f * I  # This should not be a valid composition

    979 
    980     def __pow__(self, exp):

    798                     return C(im, datatype=datatype)

```
Now this is failing, as it should, but not in a meaningful way IMO. The error message is somewhat cryptic, It all works without explicit consideration of the domain/codomain matching because of how it is coded, but it feels a bit fragile to me.

It looks fragile to me as well but also unrelated to this ticket which is about improving `growing_letters`. [comment:14](#comment%3A14) which is the starting point of the discussion about `is_endomorphism` was complaining about the fact that `growing_letters` (and many other methods) remains valid under the more general assumption that you can iterate the morphism.
