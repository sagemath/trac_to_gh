Very recent versions of LaTeX won't build the PDF documentation for `en/reference/stats/`, instead yielding an error:

```
Chapter 8.
! TeX capacity exceeded, sorry [input stack size=5000].
\non@alpherr #1->\@latex@error {\string #1
                                          allowed only in math mode}\@ehd

```
We should find a workaround.

(Split off from #31387 — some more discussion there.)

LaTeX bug is fixed at https://github.com/latex3/latex2e/pull/503.

Works for me, too. Thanks for fixing this. 

By the way, I don't think `\makeatletter` and `\makeatother` are necessary, because the definition of `\pdfstringdefDisableCommands` in hyperref.sty already includes `\makeatletter`:

```
\def\pdfstringdefDisableCommands{%
  \begingroup
    \makeatletter
    \HyPsd@DisableCommands
}
```
However, I don't see any harm in adding the extra lines, and it seems possible that old versions of hyperref might not have this, so the extra lines may be safer.
