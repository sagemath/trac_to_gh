This should return `-I`, not `I`:

```
sage: K.<j> = QuadraticField(-1, embedding=CC(0,-1))
sage: SR(j)
I
```
Works under Sage 9.2, so maybe related to #18036?

Hmm, if I remember right, the `GaussianInteger` class was intended for ℚ[i] *with its standard embedding*, so I think there is something else.
