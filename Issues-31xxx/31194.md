In #30181, the class `ModuleElementWithMutability` was introduced. In an effort to set a standard in Sage, as per `sage.structure.mutability.Mutability`, we rename the `_is_mutable` to `_is_immutable`. As such, this class is not currently compatible with the wrappers `sage.structure.mutability.require_mutable` and `sage.structure.nutability.require_immutable`, see as well #31196.

The same holds for other classes whose mutability attribute will be unified here.
