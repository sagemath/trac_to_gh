In #30181, the class `ModuleElementWithMutability` was introduced. In an effort to set a standard in Sage, as per `sage.structure.mutability.Mutability`, we rename the `_is_mutable` to `_is_immutable`. As such, this class is not currently compatible with the wrappers `sage.structure.mutability.require_mutable` and `sage.structure.nutability.require_immutable`, see as well #31196.

The same holds for other classes whose mutability attribute will be unified here.

You would also need to change the corresponding attribute in `element.pxd`:

```diff
 cdef class ModuleElementWithMutability(ModuleElement):
-    cdef bint _is_mutable
+    cdef bint _is_immutable
     cpdef bint is_immutable(self)
     cpdef bint is_mutable(self)
```
You currently have numerous doctest failures because of this. There will probably be a few other places that require some touch ups that you can check for with a `grep`.
