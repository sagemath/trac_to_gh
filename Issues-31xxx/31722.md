All generic methods such as `ìs_field` or `is_integral_domain`, which are commonly used all over Sage, are part of `rings/ring.pyx`. But not every ring inherits from it.

I suggest to move those method to `categories/rings.py`. This allows to replace any `_Fields = Fields()` allocation and `if R in _Fields` clauses by a simpler and quicker `R.is_field()` check.

I am a -1 on doing this. You are changing a Cython function into a Python function (which can be further called indirectly) and this check is done in some parts that need to be fast. The `is_field` check is currently quicker because of this. However, I am not opposed to having some generic method somewhere about this.

This is suggesting that more rings inherit from `Ring` when possible rather than lifting stuff up to the category.

Wait a second...but `is_field` is currently a pure Python function via `def` in `ring.pyx`. Then I don't understand what you mean.

I mean, this cannot only happen to magmas. Is there any way to handle this properly?

See Travis's comment: #31713#comment:17.

There are a lot of files that nail `_Fields` into memory whereas other files call `is_field` even though that ring does not admit this method (e.g. `free_module`). I think this should be unified together with a clear guideline for future developments.

The idea is nice but the realization is less nice. By refining the category you change the classes of parents and elements (except if it is an extension class). Namely, the following construction is not commutative

```
sage: a = P(...)        # create element
sage: P in Fields()     # refine category
sage: f(a)              # the type P.Element did not change, a inherits from Ring.ElementClass
```
versus

```
sage: P in Fields()     # refine category
sage: a = P(...)        # create element
sage: f(a)              # the type P.Element did change, a inherits from Field.ElementClass
```
Maybe even worse, the following scenario ends up with two elements having different classes

```
sage: a = P(...)     # inherits from Rings.ElementClass
sage: P in Fields()
sage: b = P(...)     # inherits from Fields.ElementClass
```

If that is the case, the implementation of `is_field` is even easier: just return `False` for the category of rings and `True` for the category of Fields.

And the implementation of the category of magmas would be a violation of the above concept, i.e. a flawed implementation.

However, that being said, most parents take care of their category correctly.

Not a big issue, isn't it? A parent is still allowed to overwrite the category's method.

But honestly, I don't quite get your initial argument. Why can't a parent be in the category of fields and maintain the original ring implementation?
