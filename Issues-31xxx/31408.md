As of Sage 9.4, Sage ships FLINT 2.7.1 (#31069), accepts system FLINT >= 2.6.0, and is ready for FLINT 2.8.x.

Many of the features added in the FLINT 2.x series are so far unused in Sage. See https://github.com/wbhart/flint2/blob/trunk/NEWS (newest items at the end)

Tickets/features:

- #29894 minimal interface for using ZZ[x] matrices in Flint
- #31525 Wrap FLINT 2.6 functions, drop support for system FLINT < 2.6
- #32175 Support FLINT 2.8.0
- #31548 Use FLINT's `nmod_mat_t` for matrices mod n.
- #31666 very fast multi-variate polynomials - use them for Sage polynomial rings and perhaps in `sage.tensor.modules`

For creating the bindings to the new FLINT functions, there is a potential for synergy with https://github.com/fredrik-johansson/python-flint; the SymPy developers have [announced](https://groups.google.com/g/sympy/c/vYsavewGj1w/m/CQKTSznPAgAJ) (2021) that they plan to use `python-flint`.
