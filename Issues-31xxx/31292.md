We refactor `Executable` and `StaticFile` through a base class `FileFeature`. 

The method `absolute_filename` replaces `StaticFile.absolute_path` and is now also available for `Executable`. (This is for #33440/#31296/#30818.)

The renaming from `StaticFile.absolute_path` to `absolute_filename` (with deprecation) is preparation for reclaiming the name `absolute_path` for a method that returns a `Path` instead of a `str`.

We also add some type annotations.

Follow-up: #31296

Actually this would lead to errors like

```

Failed example:

> Then just introduce a new method, and deprecate the old one.

I was in the middle of doing this but couldn't come up with a name for the new method, given that the good name, `absolute_path`, is already taken. Suggestions?

I like f-strings too, but in the interest of focus I don't change everything that can be changed. This line of code is copied from a place in the same file.

```
EXAMPLES::
        sage: from sage.features import StaticFile, Executable, FileFeature
        sage: issubclass(StaticFile, FileFeature)
        True
        sage: issubclass(Executable, FileFeature)
        True
```
Please replace this by a meaningful doctest that actually shows how to use the class.

In FileFeature.absolute_path you call `self.absolute_filename` which doesn't exist. So this should be added at least as an abstract method.

```
try:
            from sage.misc.superseded import deprecation
        except ImportError:
            pass
        deprecation(31292, 'method absolute_path has been replaced by absolute_filename')
```
That looks like a strange construction. Why should the import of the deprecation fail? But even if it fails the call of `deprecation` will throw another error as its not defined then.

Avoiding use of `sage.misc.abstract_method` for the same modularization reason.
I'll not start using https://docs.python.org/3/library/abc.html here for this purpose.

I can make an ad-hoc abstract method that just raises a `NotImplementedError`
