We refactor `Executable` and `StaticFile` through a base class `FileFeature`. 

The method `absolute_filename` replaces `StaticFile.absolute_path` and is now also available for `Executable`. (This is for #33440/#31296/#30818.)

The renaming from `StaticFile.absolute_path` to `absolute_filename` (with deprecation) is preparation for reclaiming the name `absolute_path` for a method that returns a `Path` instead of a `str`.

We also add some type annotations.

Follow-up: #31296

Actually this would lead to errors like

```
File "src/sage/databases/cremona.py", line 1552, in sage.databases.cremona.LargeCremonaDatabase.degphi
Failed example:
    c = CremonaDatabase()
Exception raised:

        elif (filename[-3:] != '.db'):
    TypeError: 'PosixPath' object is not subscriptable

EXAMPLES::
        sage: from sage.features import StaticFile, Executable, FileFeature
        sage: issubclass(StaticFile, FileFeature)
        True
        sage: issubclass(Executable, FileFeature)
        True
```
Please replace this by a meaningful doctest that actually shows how to use the class.

In FileFeature.absolute_path you call `self.absolute_filename` which doesn't exist. So this should be added at least as an abstract method.

```
try:
            from sage.misc.superseded import deprecation
        except ImportError:
            pass
        deprecation(31292, 'method absolute_path has been replaced by absolute_filename')
```
That looks like a strange construction. Why should the import of the deprecation fail? But even if it fails the call of `deprecation` will throw another error as its not defined then.

Avoiding use of `sage.misc.abstract_method` for the same modularization reason.
I'll not start using https://docs.python.org/3/library/abc.html here for this purpose.

I can make an ad-hoc abstract method that just raises a `NotImplementedError`
