We refactor `Executable` and `StaticFile` through a base class `FileFeature`. 

The method `absolute_filename` replaces `StaticFile.absolute_path` and is now also available for `Executable`. (This is for #33440/#31296/#30818.)

The renaming from `StaticFile.absolute_path` to `absolute_filename` (with deprecation) is preparation for reclaiming the name `absolute_path` for a method that returns a `Path` instead of a `str`.

We also add some type annotations.

Follow-up: #31296

Please replace this by a meaningful doctest that actually shows how to use the class.

In FileFeature.absolute_path you call `self.absolute_filename` which doesn't exist. So this should be added at least as an abstract method.

Avoiding use of `sage.misc.abstract_method` for the same modularization reason.
I'll not start using https://docs.python.org/3/library/abc.html here for this purpose.
