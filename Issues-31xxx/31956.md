```
Currently we have:

```
sage: W = QQ^2
sage: V = W.span([[2, 3]])
sage: V.is_subspace(W)
True
sage: V in VectorSpaces(QQ)
True
sage: V in VectorSpaces(QQ).Subobjects()
False
```
Indeed `V` is missing the `ambient`, `lift`, `retract` methods from `Sets.Subobjects.ParentMethods`

And there is an apparent conflict of the element method `lift` with the one defined in `free_module_element.pyx`


Depends on #33431
