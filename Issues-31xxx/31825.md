I don't know why its important that sage_conf version is 'none', but it sometimes fails with the actual version number after doing some incremental builds:

```
sage -t --long --warn-long 46.6 --random-seed=0 src/sage/misc/package.py
**********************************************************************

Failed example:

Expected:

Got:
    '9.3'
