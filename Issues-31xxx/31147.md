What did you need this for exactly in #30371?

For modularization we certainly need something like this; but I think when building all modules, with this patch the unresolved cython aliases will just stay as is and cause errors later.

A version of this is needed for Sage 9.3: Since #29706, `cython_aliases` insists to find `lapack.pc` even though no `LAPACK_...` aliases are used anywhere in `src/`.
In the Sage distribution, of course, we have that; but it fails for example in conda when testing without build of the Sage distribution.

They are enforcing using gslcblas as their cblas library. That's a bit surprising and shocking. Their own comment is confusing, they seem to think gslcblas should be used which is not the case.

In Debian BLAS is managed with the alternatives system (update-alternatives), which allows to install multiple implementations at the same time and define one of them as default.
As a result, libblas.so.3, cblas.h and blas.pc are symlinks managed by the alternatives system, so these files do not show up in any package, but they are created as symlinks when any BLAS implementation is installed.

But no BLAS implementation installs a libcblas.so or cblas.pc. Could it be that this is not really needed and provided by libblas.so together with cblas.h?

That's a Debian specific thing

The unpatched Netlib reference blas implementation does install a libcblas.so library.
