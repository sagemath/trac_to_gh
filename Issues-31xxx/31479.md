```
Pynac's `poly_mul_expand` function silently produces wrong results when expanding certain sums. This ticket eliminates its use by pynac's `ex::expand` method, and therefore provides a (temporary) fix for the problems reported in #31077 and #31411.

This is part of metaticket #31478.

Use of the `poly_mul_expand` function can be re-enabled after the bugs have been fixed.
