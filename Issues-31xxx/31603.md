Consider the following example:

```
sage: version()
'SageMath version 9.3.beta6, Release Date: 2021-01-17'
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^3-2)
sage: O = K.maximal_order()
sage: I = O.ideal(4)
sage: Omod4 = O.quotient(I, 'b')
sage: a + I == 1 # Are a and 4 coprime? (no)
False
sage: a_bar = Omod4(a)
sage: a_bar.is_unit() # So this should return False...
True
sage: a_bar.parent()
Quotient of Maximal Order in Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^3 - 2 by the ideal (4)
```

Clearly the method `is_unit()` gives the wrong answer in this example.

I checked the implementation:

```
sage: a_bar.is_unit??
    ...
    def is_unit(self):
        """
        Return True if self is a unit in the quotient ring.
        ...
        """
        if self.__rep.is_unit():
            return True
        from sage.categories.fields import Fields
        if self.parent() in Fields:
            return not self.is_zero()
        try:
            self.__invert__()
            return True
        except ArithmeticError:
            return False
        raise NotImplementedError
```

When I trace through this, I do not understand what happens.
On the first line `self.__rep.is_unit()` returns `True`, while my debugger says `self` has no attribute `__rep`.
When I step into this call, I end up in `K.is_field()`, which returns `True`.

I tried checking if for some reason we where executing the line `if self.parent() in Fields`, but this does not seem to be the case: `self.parent()` gives
`Quotient of Maximal Order in Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^3 - 2 by the ideal (4)`

<a id='comment:1'>**Comment 1:**</a>
`self.__rep` is another name for `self.lift()`, which is equal to `a`.

The lift is erroneously being considered as an element of the field `K`, instead of as an element of the order `O`.

```
sage: a_bar.lift().parent()
Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^3 - 2
sage: Omod4(2).lift().parent()
Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^3 - 2
sage: Omod4(2).is_unit()
True
```

Possibly related tickets: #12242 and #28552.
