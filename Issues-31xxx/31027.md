(split out from #30315)

We propose to downgrade jmol to optional.  

It is still needed for
- HTML docbuild -> #33507
- sagetex testsuite
- PDF docbuild
so we make installation of jmol conditional on these.

See discussion: ​https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/qKqTmLzHAbg/m/6YxQ_qWUBQAJ
 and #33507 for alternative technologies for creating 3D graphics for documentation and sagetex
