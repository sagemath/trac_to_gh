You need to pass the parent to construct the representation/element. The generic parent `SymmetricGroupRepresentations_class` does not know about what the default ring should be. This is something set by the subclasses. I see two options:

1 - Implement a proper parent/element system with rewriting the (internal) construction paths to use `P.element_class` for the appropriate parent `P`.
2 - Just pass the correct object during the call of `SymmetricGroupRepresentation`.

1 takes more work, but it is the proper way to do it. 2 is quick and will work for now. I don't think 1 is too much more work, and I can do it if you want.
