We add a simple mechanism to sagelib's `setup.py` (via a new module in `sage_setup`) to prepend `SAGE_LOCAL` values to key environment variables needed for the build: `PATH`, `LIBRARY_PATH`, `CPATH`, `LDFLAGS`. This allows use to build sagelib outside of an environment set by `sage-env` (which would set these variables among many more) if only `sage_conf` is installed in the build environment.

To test:

```
./configure --enable-editable
make sagelib-build-deps      # installs sage_conf and other things
(cd src && ../local/bin/python3 setup.py develop)
```
Note - the last line is not within a sage-env!

Follow-up, if necessary: Because for misconfigured Pythons, `-I` options may leak in as described in #31335 and take precedence over the CPATH that we set, we may want to essentially revert #29697, adding some refinements:
- `SAGE_LOCAL` vs `SAGE_VENV`
- make sure that if `$SAGE_LOCAL` is unset, nothing is added.

Relevant tickets regarding include/library search paths: #13348, #14709, #29562 (+), #29607 (+), #29697 (?), #31041 (~), #30818 (~), #30013 (~)


Depends on #31593

```

I am trying to follow the logic of the ticket but I fail to see when `SAGE_LOCAL` is not defined, which is the only way to avoid these. In `env.py` we have 

```
SAGE_LOCAL = var("SAGE_LOCAL", SAGE_VENV)
```
So either something from the environment or `SAGE_VENV` and it is defined by

```
SAGE_VENV = var("SAGE_VENV", os.path.abspath(sys.prefix))
```
So if neither `SAGE_LOCAL` or `SAGE_VENV` is in the environment `SAGE_LOCAL` becomes `os.path.abspath(sys.prefix)`.

I am not sure why the `if SAGE_LOCAL:` conditional is necessary since it is always defined. What I don't see is a way to avoid the content of that block becoming added to the environment.

Is there another ticket that will make `SAGE_LOCAL` default to `None` in some circumstances? Or a process that I overlooked?

The idea for distribution packaging would be that `SAGE_LOCAL` will not be set at all, which is why we have the `if SAGE_LOCAL` there.

That it is always set, by the traditional catch-all defaults in `sage.env`, is a nice catch; let's fix this in #32036.
