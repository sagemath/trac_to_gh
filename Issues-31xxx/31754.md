PARI/GP 2.13.0 introduced factored forms for units of number fields. In the PARI/GP upgrade ticket #30801 we use some workaround to expand this factored form (via `bnf.nfbasistoalg(bnf.nffactorback(.))`). However, it would be much more natural (and efficient) if Sage worked directly with the factored form.

Depends on #30801
