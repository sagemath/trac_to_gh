(from #31132)

#27122 determines whether `CC` accepts `-march=native` and then adds it globally to `CFLAGS` in `build/bin/sage-build-env`.

However, Python extension modules are compiled with the compiler listed in sysconfig. On macOS with homebrew, using `/usr/bin/python3`, this could be `clang`, which does not accept `-march=native`.

<a id='comment:2'></a>Do we manually set the Compiler to be different somewhere vor is this enforced by using system python? If not, is there a reasonable place to check this?

Can this happen to python modules only?

<a id='comment:4'></a>This is the standard behavior of python's distutils. Only Python extension modules are affected.

`m4/sage_check_python_for_venv` defines a macro used by `build/pkgs/python3/spkg-configure.m4` to check the suitability of distutils.

These are probably the best places to put additional checks.

Yes, I think that would be better. Otherwise too many `spkg-install` files would have to be changed. I don't see a clean way of implementing this in the helper functions `sdh_pip_install` and `sdh_setup_bdist_wheel`.

Maybe we need to add `-march=native` yet:

```
