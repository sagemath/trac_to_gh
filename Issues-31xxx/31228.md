(from #31132)

#27122 determines whether `CC` accepts `-march=native` and then adds it globally to `CFLAGS` in `build/bin/sage-build-env`.

However, Python extension modules are compiled with the compiler listed in sysconfig. On macOS with homebrew, using `/usr/bin/python3`, this could be `clang`, which does not accept `-march=native`.

Do we manually set the Compiler to be different somewhere vor is this enforced by using system python? If not, is there a reasonable place to check this?

Can this happen to python modules only?

This is the standard behavior of python's distutils. Only Python extension modules are affected.

`m4/sage_check_python_for_venv` defines a macro used by `build/pkgs/python3/spkg-configure.m4` to check the suitability of distutils.

These are probably the best places to put additional checks.

Yes, I think that would be better. Otherwise too many `spkg-install` files would have to be changed. I don't see a clean way of implementing this in the helper functions `sdh_pip_install` and `sdh_setup_bdist_wheel`.

Looks plausible, however I don't see exactly, where `-march=native` was added such that this command fails.

```
            AS_IF([CC="$CC" CXX="$CXX" conftest_venv/bin/python3 conftest.py --verbose build --build-base=conftest.dir >& AS_MESSAGE_LOG_FD 2>&1 ], [
```

Maybe we need to add `-march=native` yet:

```
            AS_IF([CC="$CC" CXX="$CXX" CFLAGS="-march=native" CXXFLAGS="-march=native" conftest_venv/bin/python3 conftest.py --verbose build --build-base=conftest.dir >& AS_MESSAGE_LOG_FD 2>&1 ], [
```

But I'm just hoping they are respected.

I just started github actions along with commit `3a86a18f345a1c98411aa05254bff58ac02c3180`.

Please tell me, if I need to pull other tickets yet as mentioned in:

https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/30725#comment:42

Btw, I personally would find it useful, those tickets needed to fix github actions on top of the current beta are collected somewhere.
