This simplified example gives the same failure::

```
sage: a, b, c, t = SR.var('a, b, c, t')
sage: r = function('r')(t)
sage: de = diff(r, t) + sqrt(a*r + b + c/r)
sage: desolve(de, r, ivar=t)
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
TypeError: ECL says: BINDING-STACK overflow at size 10240.
Stack can probably be resized. Proceed with caution.
```
By contrast:

```
sage: de = diff(r, t) + sqrt(a*r + b)
sage: desolve(de, r, ivar=t)
-2*sqrt(a*r(t) + b)/a == _C + t
```

```
sage: de = diff(r, t) + sqrt(a*r + b/t)
sage: desolve(de, r, ivar=t)
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
NotImplementedError: Maxima was unable to solve this ODE.
Consider to set option contrib_ode to True.
```

```
sage: de = diff(r, t) + sqrt(a + b/t)
sage: desolve(de, r, ivar=t)
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
TypeError: Computation failed since Maxima requested additional
constraints; using the 'assume' command before evaluation
