I recently made a new version of eclib, which will only affect the saturation of points on elliptic curves over Q.  The interface for this (in the `saturation()` method for elliptic curves over Q) has some problems.  Mainly, it does not do a good job of choosing the real precision which mwrank should work at, and also (due to shortcomings in eclib which are now improved) (1) when saturation at one prime fails owing to precision being too low, Sage has no way to do something sensible such as raise an error, or put the call into a loop in which the precision is increased; (2) there is no way to saturate at a single prime, or a range of primes, only at all primes or all primes except 2 or all primes up to some bound.

The rationale here is that if you have saturated points on one curve and map them to another using an isogeny, then the image points will automatically be saturated at all primes dividing the isogeny degree.

I don't see a sensible way to deal with this in two parts, so I'll make a new eclib spkg (if that is what they are still called) and make the code changes to saturation at the same time.

Incidentally, Sage has its own implementation of the same underlying algorithm for elliptic curves over number fields, as as well as all the above, there should be a parameter called 'implementation' which could be either 'sage' or 'eclib' (or 'pari' before long).

<a id='comment:2'></a>Here's the updated `eclib` version `v20210310` (see tarball link above) together with the necessary changes to the interface in `src/sage/libs/eclib`, and also a much simplified (and improved) `saturation()` method in `sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_rational_field`.

This was a symbiotic procedure, in the sense that as I modified the interface code and tested, I found issues which had to be fixed on the `eclib` side.

The main changes for `eclib` are:  various efficiency improvements in the sieve used to p-saturation for an individual prime p;  much better division of a point by p (when it is p times a smaller point), by default using division polynomials instead of floating point methods, though I did also improve the f.p. approach to set the precision appropriately (instead of just relying on the user to do so) which fixed the immediate hard cases I had;  reducing the saturation index bound when the subgroup is enlarged.  I also made some improvements to the construction of a newform from an elliptic curve which will avoid the normalisation problems with modular symbols (which I had already fixed on the Sage side, but this is more robust).

I will post here some elliptic curves whose saturation is now faster and/or better.  There are plenty of examples in the old doctests, but the really hard cases are not very suitable for doctests as they involve hundreds (or thousands) of digits, or take 15 minutes.

<a id='comment:3'></a>An example where the point P is 3*Q but E.saturation([P]) used to fail.

In Sage 9.2:

```
E = EllipticCurve([0, 1, 0, -3532341, 2671895459])
Q = E([188751344014/116704809 , 43530702836852015/1260762051627])
P = 3*Q
E.saturation([P]) # fails
```
even after `mwrank_set_precision(2000)`, which is slow.  But with the new version (and no precision adjustment necessary, as the new method is exact):

```
sage: E.saturation([P])                                                                                                                               
([(188751344014/116704809 : 43530702836852015/1260762051627 : 1)],
 3,
 22.2351273597058)
```
and this is instantaneous.

An example you will probably not want to run to completion:

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve([0,1,1,-9872,374262])

```
Under 9.2 it reports that the saturation index bound is 86682 but that it will not go past 10000 -- you can override this if you want, but even going up to 10000 takes a long time.  With the new code, it does not reduce the bound (since the default is supposed to be that it goes all the way up to the bound necessary to prove saturation) and takes about 15 minutes.

So YES, we need to provide a method to check the version.  The current m4 script cannot do that (the function version() it runs dates from before eclib had versin numbers and just displays compilation date and time).  I can easily provide a function to return the version (which autotools defines as the macro VERSION).  Perhaps more helpful would be a function to return the triple of integers (year, month, day), and also a function to compare the current version with a given (y,m,d) triple and return true iff the current version is equal or later than it.   Then the little program constructed and run by the m4 could run (say) compare_eclib_version(2021, 3, 10) which would return true if and only if the actual version was equal or later than this.

<a id='comment:18'></a>I typed a long reply to that which just got zapped before I submitted the changes...

Yes, all previous versions of eclib will NOT work after these changes.  So YES, we need to provide a method to check the version.  The current m4 script cannot do that (the function version() it runs dates from before eclib had versin numbers and just displays compilation date and time).  I can easily provide a function to return the version (which autotools defines as the macro VERSION).  Perhaps more helpful would be a function to return the triple of integers (year, month, day), and also a function to compare the current version with a given (y,m,d) triple and return true iff the current version is equal or later than it.   Then the little program constructed and run by the m4 could run (say) compare_eclib_version(2021, 3, 10) which would return true if and only if the actual version was equal or later than this.  How does that sound?

In any case I can see that today will see a new version released with these functions in it, probably called 'v20210317'.

<a id='comment:19'></a>`pkg-config` is standard, distros that don't use it consistently have only themselves to blame.
With `pkg-config`, it's as simple as with `fplll`, say, see
https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/develop/build/pkgs/fplll/spkg-configure.m4

Probably the separate check for `mwrank` should be kept, though. Can you add `--version` and/or `-v` option to `mwrank`, so that `mwrank -v` prints its version (make it equal to 
the `eclib` version) and exits?

Theoretically, there could be a situation that versions of mwrank and eclib are not the same on the system, so `mwrank -v` will allow to check for this consistency.

Say, one installs `mwrank` using an old eclib in `/usr/local/bin`, and has it shadow the new one `mwrank` in `/usr/bin`. We see such fun not quite bugs creeping up once in a while. 

Comparing versions of eclib and mwrank is an extra check that won't hurt. `pkg-config` is useful in Python, as there is a Python interface to it (already used in Sage quite a bit
to simplify the dread of getting the right libraries etc).

this is correct. Also, Sage is still on flint 2.6.3, see #31069

more details can be found in the top-level config.log

Pari upgrade to 2.13 is not yet done, see #30906 - needs review.

As to what exactly is amiss in your current Pari, it can be seen in the top-level config log. There were several bugs in Pari 2.11 - were they all fixed in 2.11.4?
I don't recall right away, there was a problematic Pari 2.12 release, perhaps something from there needed to be backported...

Hmm, if you already have mpir/gmp installed in your Sage install, then ./configure will assume you want to keep it (and thus everything that depends upon it will be built).

```
make gmp-clean mpir-clean 
```
should clean these up, so that the system GMP is picked up by ./configure

Sage most probably finds mpir in /usr/local first, and then rejects it for some reason.
Please post top-level config.log
(This is a configuration noone tried since few years, I guess. MPIR is semi-abandoned,
I don't know why we have not downgraded it to experimental yet)

I am not tied at all to MPIR, I started using it when Bill Hart was in Warwick.  But it will simplify m life a bit to just use ordinary gmp, so I will uninstall mpir and hope that this will fix things.

gmp is a build dependency of gcc, so not too bizzare. 

However, system packages should not depend on anything in /usr/local, so perhaps something was not properly flushed...

This is a repo I downloaded yesterday, have made some changes to (in build/ and whatever else the branch on this ticket touches such as src/libs/eclib) but have never actually built, only run ./bootstrap and ./configure.

./configure *does* now report that it can use the system gmp -- this is only true after rerunning ./bootstrap *and* adding --with-mp=pir on the configure command line.  That is progress.  But it still does not like my NTL.  Here's a bit of config.log:

I think it *is* bizarre since I reinstalled the system gmp and gcc and after that gcc did not work, while after reinstalling my own mpir build gcc does work.

I don't know exactly what that means or how to fix it.

The only reason I am in this  mess is that I was trying to improve Sage for Sage users by improving eclib (no-one else uses it).  I have now spent several days on all this package installation nonsense, which used to be very simple but is now in some in-between state where things only half work.  And now I cannot even push my branch to trac for some other stupid reason.  I did push it to my github fork https://github.com/JohnCremona/sage/tree/31443-eclib-saturation

but I have had enough of all this.  I may come back to it next week, but I have others things to do.

remove these `git://` things - you are not using `ssh` while pushing to a `git://` URL. `git://` is a "native" git protocol that does authentication via a password, I have no idea how you actually managed to push from this machine earlier. That is, run 

```
git remote rm trac
git remote add trac git@trac.sagemath.org:sage.git
```

I don't know either, I've never seen this before --- I only know that your gcc toolchain is messed up (and this doesn't have much to do with Sage). It might be as simple as looging out and back in, or perhaps a reboot, bit it really no Sage's fault.

> And now I cannot even push my branch to trac for some other stupid reason.

which this is not Sage's fault (other that Sage messes up with MPIR for far too long :-)).


I think your packages is in a good shape, I will finish up the branch and put it up for review.

this is fine - git:// works for fetch, this does not need authentication,
and the push url is OK here, it is an ssh one.

git:// sometimes does not work through firewalls (if they are not too well set up)

There is also a possible middle ground - you could set an upper bound as well such as `<= 20231231`. 

Does the new version of `eclib` work with old version of Sage?

Downstream distributors of sage could perhaps comment whether fixing the eclib version creates additional burden for them.

Github makes a tarball whenever one makes a release, and it is at https://github.com/JohnCremona/eclib/releases/tag/20210318
but I don't think that it is identical in content to what one gets from autotools "make dist".  I would certainly prefer to having the tarball there instead of making a separate one and putting it on my own web page.

I realize that Sage itself will carry on using FLINT, but it would help me not to have to build it on machines I use, and also it would make it slightly more likely that someone building Sage would not need to build eclib.

For the record, I now have a branch which uses an NTL function instead of eclib's own for reduction of dense matrices modulo a small (int or long) prime p when FLINT_LEVEL=0 -- i.e. for when FLINT is not available, or configure has been given --without-flint.   Testing shows that this is reasonable -- much better than using eclib's own naive function -- though slower than using FLINT.  So it will be there in some future release, which might make without-flint the default, but there is no urgency.

What this means is that is that there will be yet another eclib release soon (I am hoping for tomorrow), so I am quite relaxed about whether this version gets into 9.3, despite having a positive review a week ago.

But now I have not yet been able to build a 32-bit eclib (it is not enough to add -m32 to the compiler flags, it seems, and it might need a 32-bit version of the dependent libraries too).

The only purpose of this test is to show that saturation may not change anything.  I'll patch it to use this smaller example instead:

```
sage: E = mwrank_EllipticCurve([0, 0, 0, -391, 0])                                                                                                                                                                           
sage: E.gens()                                                                                                                                                                                                               
[[196, 2730, 1]]
sage: E.saturate()

The Point_comparer is used to sort lists of torsion points (finite order) and uses the point's order as the first comparator, but calling order(P) has a side-effect of caching the order in P if it was not already there, so cannot be called on a const point.  Of course I could use copies within the comparer.

Would this change get around the issue?
