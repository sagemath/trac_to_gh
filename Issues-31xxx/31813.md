As reported on [this question](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/57020/geodesicstangent-vector-evaluation-interpolation-error/), `tangent_vector_eval_at` doesn't work if the option `solve_across_charts` is set to `True` in the geodesic declaration.

This is because the resulting interpolation is stored in a segmented way (one for each chart encountered during the integration), which is not expected by `tangent_vector_eval_at`.
