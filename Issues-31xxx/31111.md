We extend the existing `local-direct` as follows:

- Other `tox -e local-...`: If it finds non-symlink `logs/` and `config.log` in `SAGE_ROOT`, it now moves `logs`, `config.log`, `config.status` into `.tox/local-direct/` before setting symlinks into its own environment directory.

- `tox -e local-direct` restores `logs/` in `SAGE_ROOT` from `.tox/local-direct` -- thus cleaning up the effects that `tox -e local-...` has on the source tree.
