(from #31742)

The current variable names for the backend, constructed in `MIPVariable.__getitem__`:

```
sage: M2.<x> = MixedIntegerLinearProgram()                                                                                                               
sage: x[1,2]                                                                                                                                             
x_0
sage: x[3,4]                                                                                                                                             
x_1
sage: M2.get_backend().col_name(0)                                                                                                                       
'x[(1, 2)]'
```
Such variable names are not compatible with LP (http://lpsolve.sourceforge.net/5.0/CPLEX-format.htm) or MPS file format (https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/9.1/refman/mps_format.html).
They are also not compatible with the rules for Python identifiers - which becomes relevant when we want to use `SR` variables with the same name, as is done by `InteractiveLPBackend`.

So changing this to something that has a chance to work with these file formats and is a valid Python identifier, such as `x_1_2`, would be an improvement.

```
In `mip.pyx`:

- L823: `name = self._first_variable_names.pop(0)`. 
I would remember the variable names in the MIP instance, and expose them to the user, to enable the reconstruction of variables of the MIP later. Maybe maintain a list `self._variable_names`
- L843: `self._default_mipvariable = self.new_variable()`
I would give a name such as `mipvar` to default mipvariable, so that `write_lp` does not confuse variable `x_1` of `LinearFunction` with variable `x_1` of MIP.
- L876: `return tuple(self.new_variable() for i in range(n))`
I would pass `name` from `self._variable_names` to the new variable constructor.
- L1255: `default_name = str(self.linear_functions_parent()({i: 1}))`
This doesn't make sense to me. It displays `x_i` (string of `sage.numerical.linear_functions.LinearFunction`).
- L1258: `varid_explainer[i] = '{0} = {1}'.format(s, default_name)... else... `
I would like to change the Variables section of `p.show()` above to `...[namified variable if name is given or mipvar_index otherwise]... = i-th column var is a continuous variable...`. 
- L2657: `sage: p = MixedIntegerLinearProgram(names=['m'], solver="GLPK")`.
It is confusing to provide name `m`, and then to use new variable `x` as `m`.
- I notice that `write_lp` is properly implemented in coin backend (or perhaps I didn't install the package properly), as variable names are not passed to the backend.

<a id='comment:5'></a>Regarding `<MIPVariable xxx>._namify(multi_indices)`, I would trust the users to provide meaningful names, such that
- the final name of a MIP variable is <string> `xxx__iii`, which consists of two parts connected by the double underscores: the variable sequence name `xxx` and the index `iii`.
- the variable sequence name 'xxx' (provided to `mip.<'xxx'> = MixedIntegerLinearProgram(...)`, `mip = MixedIntegerLinearProgram(names = ['xxx'], ...)` or `something_like_xxx = mip.new_variable(name='xxx')`) should be a string that satisfies the rules of Python identifiers. In addition, it cannot start or end by an underscore, neither can it contain double underscores `__`. The default is `mipvar`.
- the index `iii` is the return of `xxx._namify(multi_indices)`, where `multi_indices` is an integer, a string, a tuple or a list. Each element in `multi_indices` is either a integer or a string satisfying the rules of Python identifiers. (So `a['1']` is not allowed, but `a[1]` is good.) In addition, when naming a new variable, the index element cannot contain `_`, nor space.

In `mip.__getitem__(v)`, if `v` contains `__`, then it is understood as the composition of the sequence name `xxx` and the index `iii`; otherwise, it is understood as `mipvar__v`.

Caveats:
- The example `a[4, 'string', QQ]` in L142 of `mip.pyx` will no longer be allowed, since the last index `QQ` is not an integer nor a string. (We won't do `str(QQ)` to get `Rational Field` which contains a space.)
- variable sequence names `w`, `z` should be avoided if the user would like to use the interactive simplex method (These are slack variables in the "Vanderbei" style).

Examples: `_namify(4, 'string', 'QQ') = '_4_string_QQ'` and it will be possible to map a string back to a mip variable.

```
sage: p.<p_var> = MixedIntegerLinearProgram(solver='GLPK')                    
sage: p_var[4, 'string', 'QQ']                                                
x_0 # the return has type <class 'sage.numerical.linear_functions.LinearFunction'>
sage: p.get_backend().col_name(0)                                               
'p_var__4_string_QQ'
sage: p['p_var__4_string_QQ']
x_0
sage: p[4, 'string', 'QQ']
x_1
sage: p.get_backend().col_name(1)
'mipvar__4_string_QQ'
sage: p['mipvar__4_string_QQ']
x_1
sage: p['4_string_QQ']
x_1
