We provide a dedicated reversed Hermite normal form computation implementation for function fields. It seems that we gain 30% in performance.

Performance comparison of ideal arithmetic: 

```
sage: k.<a> = GF(16)
sage: K.<x> = FunctionField(k)
sage: Y = polygen(K, 'Y')
sage: L.<y> = K.extension(Y^4 + Y - x^5)
sage: O = L.maximal_order()
sage: i = O.ideal(y)
sage: j = O.ideal(x, 1/y)
sage: I = (i + j)^10
sage: J = (i / j)^10
sage: timeit('I + J')  # add
sage: timeit('I * J')  # mul
sage: timeit('I / J')  # div
sage: timeit('I^10')   # pow
```
