This ticket proposes to change some methods that currently return lists to generators - like the method `open_supersets` added in #31677. This is in line with the changes in the Python standard library when we moved from Python 2 to 3.

`ManifoldSubset`:
- `open_covers()` currently returns a list of lists
  - change to generator of `ManifoldSubsetFiniteFamily` instances 
  - add optional argument `trivial` to simplify the common use case that only needs the nontrivial open covers

- `subsets()` currently returns a `frozenset`
  - change to generator of `ManifoldSubset` instances

These API changes will probably make some updates to sage.manifolds worksheets that are maintained outside of the Sage tree necessary.


Follow-up for some methods of `Manifold` in #31720.

Yes, in #31732 I use `ManifoldObjectFiniteFamily` directly for the family of open covers. Its elements are `ManifoldSubsetFiniteFamily` instances.

I agree that charts/frames are likely to benefit from becoming finite families too. This will also need a separate subclass because they are indexed not by names but by coordinate tuples.

Alright, that makes sense. Just a personal taste: I think its better to add some distinct examples to `ManifoldObjectFiniteFamily` to clarify the difference to `ManifoldSubsetFiniteFamily`.

Right. But don't you think it should rather be a new common parent class both inherit from?

In any case, this is something definitely need, indeed!

Sure, let's do that when we introduce some more applications to families.

Let's take this discussion to #31720 (Manifold: Change some methods to generators), which introduces generators for charts. Families could be introduced in the same ticket -- but I will need some guidance there what the keys should be.
