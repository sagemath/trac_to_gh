<div id="comment:0"></div>

We define the Riemannian manifold PL_k of continuous piecewise linear functions from the interval [0,1] to the reals with k+1 marked breakpoints.

Default chart: breakpoints 0 = a_0 < a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_k = 1; slopes s_1, ..., s_k.

The breakpoints are marked: For example for k = 2, we distinguish the constant function with a_0 = 0, a_1 = 1/2, a_2 = 1 and s_1 = s_2 = 0 from the constant function with a_1 = 1/3.

This manifold has an immersion (but not embedding) into the Hilbert space of L<sup>2</sup> functions.  The inner product there (see #30218) pulls back to define the metric on PL_k.

Elements of PL_k indicate their embedding.

Short of defining infinite-dimensional Banach and Hilbert manifolds, for this ticket we would define 
- a version of `ContinuousMap` that maps into an arbitrary (topological) `VectorSpace` (with distinguished basis)
- a version of `DiffMap` that maps into an arbitrary (topological) `VectorSpace` or `InnerProductSpace` (#30218) (with distinguished basis)
- versions of `TopologicalSubmanifold`, `DifferentiableSubmanifold`, `PseudoRiemannianSubmanifold` that can work with these types of maps.
