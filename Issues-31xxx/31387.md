I'm not sure why `index:aagmrz2019` is the only reference that is multiply defined unless it is because it is the first reference in `src/doc/en/reference/references/index.rst` - the labels are imported twice. The following seems to get rid of the warnings

I believe the `xr-hyper` package aliases `\externalcitedocument` to `\externaldocument`. I haven't thoroughly tested this to determine if references are OK, but the `multiply defined` warnings are not present.

What happens if you delete `\usepackage{xcite}`?  (In addition to deleting `\externalcitedocument`.)  There is no reason to import this package:

```
The package xcite is no longer necessary, because its functionality has been taken 
over by xr, so this final version is just a stub that loads xr. 
    (from https://ctan.org/pkg/xcite)
```
There is no reason to load both `xr` and `xr-hyper`, because they both do the same thing. I do not understand why only one reference would be multiply defined, but maybe the problem is an incompatibility between these two packages.

It may also help to update to the latest version of `xr-hyper` (7.00j 2021-02-10), or, at least, a newer version than 2019/10/03 v6.1.

A more serious problem is that the pdf docs don't build for me: I get an error in `reference/stats`. From `local/share/docs/sage/latex/en/reference/stats/stats.log`:

```
Chapter 8.

\non@alpherr #1->\@latex@error {\string #1

If you really absolutely need more capacity,
you can ask a wizard to enlarge me.

I thought `xr-hyper` would be better, because it is distributed with `hyperref`, and is therefore less likely to have a version clash, but `xr` is probably more stable:

```
%% xr-hyper package (beta release) ...
%% This is a modified version of the xr package from the Standard LaTeX
%% tools distribution. ...
%% If no problems are reported the version in the tools distribution
%% will be updated to match this at the next LaTeX release.
```
So using `xr` is probably a good idea.

I tested the patch of [comment:9](#comment%3A9) on Ubuntu 20.04 (`CoCalc`) and had the good results, just the same 15 undefined references as in [comment:5](#comment%3A5).  I noticed that some Japanese fonts are missing (not surprising), and I also had 2 other LaTeX Warnings:

```

local/share/doc/sage/latex/en/installation/installation.log:LaTeX Warning: Hyper reference `index:installation-guide' on page 35 undefined 
```

I will test on MacOS 10.15.

In my experience, this error is almost always due to an infinite loop (such as `\def\foo{\foo}`). 

Did these results use a patch to `conf_sub.py`? What are the versions of `xr.sty`, `xr-hyper.sty` and `hyperref.sty` that are reported in the TeX log?

I've seen in on several machines with different branches, and I'm not patching anything. 

```

I do

```
make doc-clean
make doc # sometimes I include this, sometimes not, make no difference

The complaint comes from the line

```

If I change this (for example, to "...Samplers for ZZ[x]", removing the math mode, the error goes away.

Switching between `$` and `\(` makes no difference, nor do the `\protect` statements. Using `\texorpdfstring` works, though. This works:

```
\documentclass{report}

\begin{document}

\chapter{Testing \texorpdfstring{\(\mathbf{y}=4\)}{blah}}

test

\chapter{Testing \(\mathbf{x}=3\)}

This does not:

```
