This Ticket tracks the progress of the GSoC 2021 project on B-terms. It will be split into multiple sub tickets.

Related tickets:
* #31933 (initial support)
* #32153 (Refactor  _repr_ of exact term and term with coefficient)
* #32214 (Asymptotic Term Monoids: unify repr)
* #32215 (Asymptotic Term Monoids: refactor element construction)
* #32229 (fix conversion)
* #32278 (Add support for B-terms in Asymptotic Ring)
* #32922 (Change parameter name)

TODO:
* implement logarithm in `MonomialGrowthElement.find_minimum`
* implement B-term support for `ExponentialGrowthElement` in `growth_group.py`
* implement cartesian product of `growth_groups`
* support multivariate terms
