We define a subclass of `ManifoldSubset` whose instances represents the topological closure of given subset in the manifold. 

Subsets provide a method `closure` to construct it.  When the subset is already closed, as detected by the new method `is_closed`, it just returns the input.

We also add a method `declare_closed`. It just sets up an open disjoint union with an open complement. (This is exactly what `is_closed` tests.)

The purpose of this is to build a connection of manifolds to cell complexes and convex polyhedra: In a separate ticket, we will define embedded submanifolds of euclidean spaces that arise as interiors of polyhedra or relative interiors of their faces.

Btw: Do you really mean cell complexes or rather simplicial complexes?

Looks already nice!

Right, the cube is already a counter-example.

No, I don't think so.

I confirm; more generally, there is no such functionality for continuous maps.

There is a spurious line feed in the html documentation of `ManifoldSubsetClosure`, which can be fixed with

```diff
     - ``name`` -- (default: computed from the name of the subset)
-       string; name (symbol) given to the closure
+      string; name (symbol) given to the closure
```
Besides, there should be some `EXAMPLES` section in the main docstring of `ManifoldSubsetClosure`, and the latter should start with `r"""`, instead of `"""`, I think.

<a id='comment:40'></a>Also, in the docstring of `ManifoldSubset.closure()`, it would be nice to add an `OUTPUT` field as follows:

```
OUTPUT:

This allows one to easily access to the documentation of class `ManifoldSubsetClosure` from that of `closure()`. For completeness, one may also add an `INPUT` field describing the arguments `name` and `latex_name` and their default values.
