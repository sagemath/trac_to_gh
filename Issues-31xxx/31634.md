When `discrete_log` is called with an `order` parameter (i.e., in the form `discrete_log(a, b, order)`), it can fail throwing an exception triggered by the call to Babystep-Giantstep `bsgs`, even though the provided `order` is valid according to the documentation (being equal to a proper multiple of the exact order of `b`), and the log itself exists.

If the `order` parameter is omitted or equal to the exact order of `b`, the bug does not seem to be triggered.
