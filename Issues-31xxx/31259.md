Python 2 compatibility is still set as default for `SagePickler` and uses protocol 2. State of the art is Python 3 with protocol 4, and since Sage 9.0, backwards compatibility to Python 2 is not supported anymore.

I suggest to set `py2compat` to `False` by default.

Makes both sense.

>Particularly, it might be necessary to up internal version code of some pickles so that we can branch the unpickling code appropriately.


What does that mean?

> We used to have a pickle jar that contained historical pickles that could be tested. This has fallen into disuse, unfortunately. Perhaps it needs to be restored (and stocked with a good supply of py2-generated pickles!).


Where can I find this the remains? Do you have an example for me?

fixing up imports of standard library modules and types whose names changed between Python 2 and 3

seems to not be correct. I'd expect that problems arising from just a protocol change are going to be fairly mild. (Python's unpickler will definitely look at the first two bytes and choose the right protocol decoder)

And if the pickler already keeps track of the protocol of the dump automatically, I don't see a problem of changing the protocol.

Or is there something I miss?
