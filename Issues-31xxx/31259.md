Python 2 compatibility is still set as default for `SagePickler` and uses protocol 2. State of the art is Python 3 with protocol 4, and since Sage 9.0, backwards compatibility to Python 2 is not supported anymore.

I suggest to set `py2compat` to `False` by default.

Makes both sense.

>Particularly, it might be necessary to up internal version code of some pickles so that we can branch the unpickling code appropriately.

What does that mean?

Where can I find this the remains? Do you have an example for me?

I don't really understand the problem. The option `py2compat` is already a dead end neither passed to any other object nor stored as an attribute. Changing the default value here should therefore not affect processes elsewhere, related to this option at least.

And if the pickler already keeps track of the protocol of the dump automatically, I don't see a problem of changing the protocol.

Or is there something I miss?
