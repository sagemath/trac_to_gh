If a subword complex has only the empty facet, greedy_facet crashes.

Hi Vincent,

I'm rereading the code (not necessarily to fix the bug, but who knows), and there are some suspicious things in the code of `_greedy_facets`:

- a default parameter is a mutable object `elems=[]`: this is very dangerous because if users gains access to that list, they can modify the default value of the function... It seems that no one is modifying or returning the list, so this could be ok here, but this is generally considered bad practice. I think `tuple` would be better than list here.

- the two lines `return []` and `return set(X)` smell too. Is the function returning a list or a set?

Finally, I think that the bug is that when `pos` reaches `n`, one should stop. I'm not sure what to return then.
