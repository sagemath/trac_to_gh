I'm glad you knew what to do with the repeated references. There are several labels that I believe should be changed. These are tough to spot. "CP16" should be "CP2016", "WW72" should be "WW1972", "SWW72" should be "SWW1972" and "Sz69" should be "Sz1969". I may have missed some.

All of the references *should* be moved to the master index, and they all *should* be put into the standard format, but there are a lot of them in `combinat`, and it's tedious work. It can also yield a patch bomb. Fixing a few as we come across them is a good compromise.
