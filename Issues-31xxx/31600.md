Here is an example to reproduce it yourself:

```
theta,z=var('theta,z')
cb = cylindrical_plot3d(2,(theta,0,2*pi),(z,-5,5), alpha=0.3, color='blue')
cr = cylindrical_plot3d(1,(theta,0,2*pi),(z,-7,7), alpha=0.3, color='red')
cv = cylindrical_plot3d(0.5,(theta,0,2*pi),(z,-10,10), alpha=0.5, color='green')
p = cb + cr + cv
```

Compare

```
p.show(aspect_ratio=1)
```

with

```
p.show(viewer='jmol', aspect_ratio=1)
```

As you can see, with `threejs`, when you rotate the picture, on some angles, the transparency is correct, but sometimes there is no transparency at all, and sometimes there is a wrong transparency, see the attached pictures.

I've used the `render_order` option in the past to help with nested transparent surfaces. So you'd make sure your cylinders are rendered innermost to outermost (green then red then blue):

```python
theta,z=var('theta,z')
cb = cylindrical_plot3d(2,(theta,0,2*pi),(z,-5,5), alpha=0.3, color='blue', render_order=-1)
cr = cylindrical_plot3d(1,(theta,0,2*pi),(z,-7,7), alpha=0.3, color='red', render_order=-2)
cv = cylindrical_plot3d(0.5,(theta,0,2*pi),(z,-10,10), alpha=0.5, color='green', render_order=-3)
p = cb + cr + cv
show(p, viewer='threejs')
```

You'll still see issues with self-transparency due to the order in which the faces of each cylinder are drawn. Also, adjusting the render order can conflict with the text sprites, so I try to use negative values.

I don't know of a way to automatically set the render order or that it'd even be possible for some arbitrary set of transparent surfaces.

But for the self-transparency and text sprite problems I mentioned, perhaps it would be better to just disable writing to the depth-buffer entirely for transparent surfaces and text? I'm trying to think through whether this might result in other graphical glitches itself, since it seems so straight-forward that why wouldn't Three.js do this automatically when you make a material transparent?

I've pushed a commit with this change and will attach an example with the same cylinders plus an intersecting opaque surface for comparison.

It might be for performance reasons. On such a small scene the difference might not be
noticeable. (By the way, I noticed that on my little desktop, the noDepthWrite.html example ignites the cooling fan one second after I start rotating the scene, when viewing with the Chromium browser. But the situation is the same with the "normal" sage graphics output for this scene).

It is known that, in principle, a depth buffer cannot handle multiple transparent surfaces correctly unless they come in a consistent order (front-to-back or back-to-front).

Is there some documentation on what threejs does when setting depthWrite: false

Maybe the behaviour should be controllable by an option by the user.

The example looks good!

The [doc](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/materials/Material.depthWrite) for it is basic, but it looks like it's only ever passed along as-is to WebGL's [glDepthMask](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGLRenderingContext/depthMask) prior to rendering each object. A bit of the call stack in three.js:

Joshua, why don’t you ask these questions in the Three.js forum: https://discourse.threejs.org/

Here is an example where `depthWrite:false` would eliminate a visual distinction:

```
sage: var("u v")

sage: green= parametric_plot3d([u,v,0.2-u-v],(u,1,3),(v,1,3),alpha=0.6, color='green',render_order=2)                  
sage: red2 = parametric_plot3d([u,v,0.3-u-v],(u,0,2),(v,2.2,4.2),alpha=0.6, color='red',render_order=3)                 
sage: (red1+green+red2).show()

But surprise when looking from behind!
