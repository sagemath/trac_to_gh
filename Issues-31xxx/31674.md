This would be convenient for example for #31660.

To implement this, we refactor the method `open_subset`, already now duplicated between `TopologicalManifold` and `DifferentiableManifold` through a new method `_init_open_subset`.

    "body": "Replying to [ticket:31674 mkoeppe]:\n> \n> To implement this, perhaps the method `open_subset`, already now duplicated between `TopologicalManifold` and `DifferentiableManifold` could be refactored through a new method `open_subset_class`.\n\n>\n\nIt sounds indeed a good idea to refactor the common code in the two (now three) `open_subset` methods! \n\nNote that the comment \n\n```\n#!# update vector frames and change of frames\n```\nin `DifferentiableManifold.open_subset` means that vector frames that are not coordinate frames could be inherited from those on the ambient manifold. I've put the marker `#!#` to indicate that this is not implemented yet. For example:\n\n```\n\nsage: M = Manifold(2, 'M')                                                                                              \nsage: X.<x,y> = M.chart()                                                                                               \nsage: e0 = M.vector_field(1, 1)                                                                                          \nsage: e1 = M.vector_field(1, -2)                                                                                         \nsage: e = M.vector_frame('e', (e0, e1))                                                                                   \nsage: M.frames()                                                                                                        \n[Coordinate frame (M, (d/dx,d/dy)), Vector frame (M, (e_0,e_1))]\nsage: U = M.open_subset('U', coord_def={X: x>0})                                                                        \nsage: U.frames()                                                                                                        \n[Coordinate frame (U, (d/dx,d/dy))]\n```\nThe vector frame `e` is thus not transmitted to `U`. Of course, this can be achieved at any moment by the method `restrict`: \n\n```\nsage: e.restrict(U)                                                                                                     \nVector frame (U, (e_0,e_1))\nsage: U.frames()                                                                                                        \n[Coordinate frame (U, (d/dx,d/dy)), Vector frame (U, (e_0,e_1))]\n```\n\n---\nNew commits:\n<table><tr><td><a href=\"https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/aac8835cc795dd04ef6ac14bd360d6a5945643d6\">aac8835</a></td><td><code>{Topological,Differentiable,PseudoRiemannianSubmanifold}._repr_: Print subsets as subsets</code></td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/004c23a2a059909105224fec4b8a9b046dc4885a\">004c23a</a></td><td><code>Add/update examples</code></td></tr></table>\n",

Replying to [ticket:31674 mkoeppe]:

It sounds indeed a good idea to refactor the common code in the two (now three) `open_subset` methods! 

Note that the comment 

```
#!# update vector frames and change of frames
```
in `DifferentiableManifold.open_subset` means that vector frames that are not coordinate frames could be inherited from those on the ambient manifold. I've put the marker `#!#` to indicate that this is not implemented yet. For example:

```

sage: M = Manifold(2, 'M')                                                                                              
sage: X.<x,y> = M.chart()                                                                                               
sage: e0 = M.vector_field(1, 1)                                                                                          
sage: e1 = M.vector_field(1, -2)                                                                                         
sage: e = M.vector_frame('e', (e0, e1))                                                                                   
sage: M.frames()                                                                                                        
[Coordinate frame (M, (d/dx,d/dy)), Vector frame (M, (e_0,e_1))]
sage: U = M.open_subset('U', coord_def={X: x>0})                                                                        
sage: U.frames()                                                                                                        
[Coordinate frame (U, (d/dx,d/dy))]
```
The vector frame `e` is thus not transmitted to `U`. Of course, this can be achieved at any moment by the method `restrict`: 

```
sage: e.restrict(U)                                                                                                     
Vector frame (U, (e_0,e_1))
sage: U.frames()                                                                                                        
[Coordinate frame (U, (d/dx,d/dy)), Vector frame (U, (e_0,e_1))]
```
