This would be convenient for example for #31660.

To implement this, we refactor the method `open_subset`, already now duplicated between `TopologicalManifold` and `DifferentiableManifold` through a new method `_init_open_subset`.

It sounds indeed a good idea to refactor the common code in the two (now three) `open_subset` methods! 

Note that the comment 

```
#!# update vector frames and change of frames
```
in `DifferentiableManifold.open_subset` means that vector frames that are not coordinate frames could be inherited from those on the ambient manifold. I've put the marker `#!#` to indicate that this is not implemented yet. For example:

```

sage: M = Manifold(2, 'M')                                                                                              
sage: X.<x,y> = M.chart()                                                                                               
sage: e0 = M.vector_field(1, 1)                                                                                          
sage: e1 = M.vector_field(1, -2)                                                                                         
sage: e = M.vector_frame('e', (e0, e1))

[Coordinate frame (U, (d/dx,d/dy))]
```
The vector frame `e` is thus not transmitted to `U`. Of course, this can be achieved at any moment by the method `restrict`: 

```
sage: e.restrict(U)                                                                                                     
Vector frame (U, (e_0,e_1))
sage: U.frames()                                                                                                        
[Coordinate frame (U, (d/dx,d/dy)), Vector frame (U, (e_0,e_1))]
```
