Currently, the dense graphs backend redefines bitsets. We change the type to `binary_matrix_t`.

This mainly simplifies the code and lets dense graphs use future improvements of bitsets, but it also speeds up direct functions with the backend.

Realloc is a bit slower though.

We benefit from the improvements of the binary matrix data structure done in #31200 and #31207, including the addition of reallocation method.

Before:

```

sage: edges = [(randint(0,1000), randint(0,1000)) for _ in range(100000)]                                                             
sage: %timeit G = Graph(edges, sparse=False, loops=True)

sage: %timeit _ = G.copy(sparse=True)

sage: %timeit _ = G.copy(sparse=False)
