In Sage 9.3.rc5, we have

```
sage: S2 = manifolds.Sphere(2)                                      
sage: g = S2.metric()
sage: g                                    
Riemannian metric g on the 2-sphere S^2 of radius 1 smoothly embedded 
 in the Euclidean space E^3
```
So far so good, but then

```
sage: g.display()
...
ValueError: no basis could be found for computing the components
 in the Coordinate frame (A, (d/dtheta,d/dphi))
```

```
sage: g.ricci_scalar()
...
ValueError: no basis could be found for computing the components
 in the Coordinate frame (A, (d/dtheta,d/dphi))
```

Since spheres are implemented as embedded manifolds, they are only endowed with the induced metric from the ambient space.

Thus I'd say this is no bug. In particular it could happen that the user wants to endow spheres with metrics different from the induced one.

I'd say we just mention this in the documentation.

Wait. We implemented spheres as Riemannian submanifolds which means that `S2.metric()` should certainly give the induced metric.

But then this is more a bug of `PseudoRiemannianSubmanifold` where `metric()` is not delegating to `induced_metric()`.

This issue is by the way not restricted to spheres. Also Pseudo-Riemannian manifolds can have different metrics. The current implementation even accommodates this. From that perspective, despite what I said earlier, I actually don't see the need for such a flag because this is in full line with the current way of using Pseudo-Riemannian manifolds.

At this point it might also worth to mention that differentiable manifolds with imposed metrics are not seen as Pseudo-Riemannian manifolds. We don't even have a category for Pseudo-Riemannian manifolds.

> 

In the current implementation, on any `PseudoRiemannianManifold`, 
- `metric()` returns the default metric
- `metric('h')` initializes a new metric with name `h`

To be consistent, on a `PseudoRiemannianSubmanifold`, we should have the following behavior:
- `metric()` redirects to `induced_metric()`, since this is clearly the default metric on a pseudo-Riemannian submanifold
- `metric('h')` initializes a new metric with name `h`

To acheive this, we should redefine `metric()` in the subclass `PseudoRiemannianSubmanifold`.

This is to normalize all the manifold `__init__`'s; this is mandory for constructing degenerate submanifolds, which inherit both from `DegenerateManifold` and `DifferentiableSubmanifold`.

This restores `g` as the default metric name, after the `__init__` entry has been normalized with `metric_name=None`.

I don't know. At least one of them gave a green light (the only plugin failure is `non_ascii`, but that plugin is no longer relevant and should be removed IMHO).
