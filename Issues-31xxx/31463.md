```
**Improvements for weak Popov form**:
* extend with an option allowing column-wise transformation into column weak Popov (for consistency with other functions),
* sort the rows by increasing leading position (for consistency with other functions),
* make some arbitrary but clearly stated choice for where zero rows are placed (typically, at the bottom of the weak Popov form).

The latter two changes will not impact performance since they only involve row permutation. They should not either impact code that uses the current version, since the current code only guarantees that the output is weak Popov, a fact not changed by the new specification.

**Normalization into Popov form**: call the weak Popov form algorithm and then use Mulders and Storjohann algorithm to transform it into the canonical Popov form. Shifts should be supported, as well as working row-wise or column-wise.

**Zero rows option**: for both weak Popov and Popov forms, add an option to allow the user to specify that they want a form with the zero rows removed (option set to False by default, for compatibility). The number of rows in the returned matrix is then the rank of the input matrix.

All things above have been handled in a preliminary version, except for the transformation from weak Popov to (strong) Popov which is kept for later. Minor improvements/corrections are expected; documentation should be completed; and more tests should be done and some of them included in the documentation.

The comments and tests seem good, but maybe the documentation for reduced_form could be more clear about what reduced form is being computed (since it is not a canonical form). For example, is it randomly computed?

This function should also be simplified using the new weak_popov_form functionalities.

Thank you for noticing this, indeed `reduced_form` should be simplified, it does not need to distinguish row-wise and column-wise anymore thanks to the new `weak_popov_form` features. I'm going to fix this in a commit right now.

And indeed, the documentation is unclear because it puts too much highlight on the fact that a reduced form is not unique (for example this is also the case for weak Popov forms, and this is not even mentioned in the weak Popov documentation).

I think this is more confusing than helping, since it already appears clearly in the definitions and the class description that the Popov / Hermite forms are unique, but reduced forms and weak Popov forms are not.
