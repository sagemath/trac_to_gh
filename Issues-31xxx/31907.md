<a id='comment:1'></a>The error message includes these two urls:

- https://status.python.org/incidents/hzmjhqsdjqgb
- https://github.com/pypa/pypi-support/issues/978

where explanations involve a bunch of acronyms including:

- CDN (content delivery network)
- PSF (Python Software Foundation)
- SNI (server name indication)
- TLS (Transport Layer Security)
- VCL (Varnish conguration language)

and the general idea is that Fastly, a company that
sponsors the Python Software Foundation by providing
hosting and a content delivery network, in particular
for files at pypi.org and at pythonhosted.org,
dropped support for "non-SNI clients".

The hints in the discussion include:

- check if your Python and OpenSSL version supports SNI with
  {{{
  python2 -c "import ssl; print(ssl.HAS_SNI)"
  }}}

- append `--trusted-host pypi.org --trusted-host files.pythonhosted.org`
  to pip install commands

Related:

- [Fastly product description](https://docs.fastly.com/products/)
- [pdf snapshots of the above page in expanded form](https://docs-archive.fastly.com/snapshots/),
  including [2021-05-31](https://docs-archive.fastly.com/snapshots/static/2021-05-31-products-aio.pdf)

Not sure that helps at all but just in case.
