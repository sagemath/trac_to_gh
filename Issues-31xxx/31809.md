Exception (fmpz_divexact_si). Division by zero.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
(no backtrace available)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGABRT: An abort() occurred.
This probably occurred because a *compiled* module has a bug
in it and is not properly wrapped with sig_on(), sig_off().
Python will now terminate.

```
ref: https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/develop/src/sage/rings/polynomial/weil/power_sums.c#L77-L87

because  `force_squarefree = True` we don't run `return (1)`, but then in the last line we try to divide by the content of that vector which is 0.

<a id='comment:3'></a>I think this is a problem with sanitizing input: the line

```
    if (fmpz_sgn(f0+n-1) != sgn0_l) return(0);
```
is supposed to rule out the zero polynomial, but that fails if the initial polynomial is somehow specified with leading zeroes. 

I'm not sure how that never came up before, but it's easy enough to fix by adjusting `n` at the outset. Patch to follow shortly.
