Following sd111 discussion at #31016 we noted that tests in `sage/tests/books` are not installed and therefore not doctested when doctests are run from a globally installed sage as is done by the like of sage-on-gentoo and Arch.

They have been put into sage so they can be updated on change of behavior, but a better location may be somewhere under `doc` and that could still be doctested.

Just to re-iterate: 

If it is .py files that you install under `PYTHON_PATH` (site-package or otherwise), it should be precompiled. This happens automatically if you install things as python package but not as package data. QA in Gentoo would tell me to manually compile them, effectively it would introduce something I have to do on my side.

If we install them as real data by changing them to .rst files for example, we could then install them as package data, but we would need some kind of runner for them like `sage/doctest/test.py` is for the content of `sage/doctest/tests/`.

Putting them under `doc` is interesting but may cause problem with the doc build system. We don't want to produce html or pdf.
