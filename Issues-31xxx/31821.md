We add a method `_test_combinatorial_polyhedron` to `Polyhedron_base` that runs the test suite on the combinatorial polyhedron.

We fix pickling of the combinatorial polyhedron in case there are equations by pickling from the matrix instead of a list of facets. This way the incidences will be exactly the same including the incidences corresponding to equations.

Depends on #31820
