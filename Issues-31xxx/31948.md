Based on #31353 (`sage --docbuild`: Add options to list all documents), we can remove the issues with parallel (#31344) and serial (#31936) docbuild by restructuring the docbuild using `make`.

Blocker because it solves blocker issue #31936.

```
and it seems to build the documentation, but it doesn't do it in parallel, I think because  we've turned off parallel processing for recursive calls to make earlier in the file.

If it did work, this approach would need a little tinkering: we should build the reference manual first, then everything else.

A separate question: why do we use `cd ../..` in the recipe for `doc-html` (and other doc targets), rather than `cd $(SAGE_ROOT)`?

Several problems:

- lack of parallel building
- line 348 should be replaced by something that just builds the top-level reference manual stuff, assembling the parts into one set of indices, etc. Probably the same for line 352.
- I'm getting some warning messages that I don't know what to make of: "[schemes  ] Handler <function on_build_finished at 0x33872ef70> for event 'build-finished' threw an exception", for example.

One more task: the reference manual is built twice: the line

```

needs to be replaced with something that just builds the top-level ref manual indices, and similarly for the html build. I may be able to work on this later, but please go ahead if you want to take a stab at it.

`ffmpeg` should also be broken out of `_recommended` and transformed to its separate script package. 
When I created `_recommended`, I did not anticipate that users would be confused when the configure script recommends to install things that are already installed.

Actually, can we do this? I don't know enough about distro use: can we really recommend "make doc" and "make doc-pdf" as replacements?

I'd say just adding a deprecation warning won't break anything.

Having these make recipes in our main Makefile probably shouldn't be the final form of this. 
In #31356, I hope that we can restructure the docbuild as script packages (`sagemath_doc_html`, `sagemath_doc_pdf`), and in the next step as pip-installable packages (#29868).

Is that error new? Is it repeatable?

Probably, but on another ticket. Should we start using `src/doc/Makefile` for more than just cleaning? As I said earlier, I am unclear on the distro situation: I don't know what packages are going to be available in general, and in particular in this case: if we have the documentation source files, can we be guaranteed to have `sage_docbuild`?

In any case, this may all fit somehow into #31356 and related tickets.

I agree.

I think that's a good idea. The things that we added in `build/make/Makefile.in` could just be moved there.

I'm experimenting with this and it seems to be working. A few questions about our Makefiles:

- Where is SAGE_ROOT defined? It appears to work if I just use it in `src/doc/Makefile`, but I don't know why.

- Do I need to use `+$(MAKE_REC)` or can I just use `$(MAKE)`? The latter seems to work.

- Do I need to define `AM_V_at` in this Makefile, or does it inherit the definition from `build/make/Makefile`?

It comes from the environment and is set in `build/make/install`. 

> - Do I need to use `+$(MAKE_REC)` or can I just use `$(MAKE)`? The latter seems to work.


`$(MAKE)` is fine here - https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#MAKE-Variable

> - Do I need to define `AM_V_at` in this Makefile, or does it inherit the definition from `build/make/Makefile`?


You'd need to copy this definition from Makefile.in; it's not exported
