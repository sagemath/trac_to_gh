Based on #31353 (`sage --docbuild`: Add options to list all documents), we can remove the issues with parallel (#31344) and serial (#31936) docbuild by restructuring the docbuild using `make`.

Blocker because it solves blocker issue #31936.

I'm not quite sure how to go about this. I tried this:

```
and it seems to build the documentation, but it doesn't do it in parallel, I think because  we've turned off parallel processing for recursive calls to make earlier in the file.

If it did work, this approach would need a little tinkering: we should build the reference manual first, then everything else.

A separate question: why do we use `cd ../..` in the recipe for `doc-html` (and other doc targets), rather than `cd $(SAGE_ROOT)`?

And if we really want to pull all of the parallel building out of the current system, then we should build the pieces of the reference manual separately in the `Makefile`. I think this is what you intended.

Several problems:

- lack of parallel building
- line 348 should be replaced by something that just builds the top-level reference manual stuff, assembling the parts into one set of indices, etc. Probably the same for line 352.
- I'm getting some warning messages that I don't know what to make of: "[schemes  ] Handler <function on_build_finished at 0x33872ef70> for event 'build-finished' threw an exception", for example.

This doesn't work for me, unfortunately. If I do `make doc-clean && make doc`, I get this error, which I don't understand.

This is a hybrid model, using the old parallel building methods for the reference manual. The inventory build is fine, but I get some strange warnings during the html build:

I haven't tried `pdb`, but I get it when doing `make doc-clean && make` — running `make` again at that point doesn't produce the error. I also get it on two different machines, one Big Sur, one Catalina.

One more task: the reference manual is built twice: the line

```
+$(MAKE_REC) SAGE_DOCBUILD_OPTS="$(SAGE_DOCBUILD_OPTS) --no-prune-empty-dirs" doc-inventory--reference
```
needs to be replaced with something that just builds the top-level ref manual indices, and similarly for the html build. I may be able to work on this later, but please go ahead if you want to take a stab at it.

`ffmpeg` should also be broken out of `_recommended` and transformed to its separate script package. 
When I created `_recommended`, I did not anticipate that users would be confused when the configure script recommends to install things that are already installed.

I think that we could also delete the `cleanup` method in `src/sage_docbuild/ext/inventory_builder.py`: its docstring says

```
        Remove the '_static' directory.

        This directory is unnecessary for the inventory build, but it
        may be created by the graphviz extension. Its presence will
        break the docbuild later on, so remove it.
```
But let's keep it for now. It doesn't cause any harm.

Actually, can we do this? I don't know enough about distro use: can we really recommend "make doc" and "make doc-pdf" as replacements?

I'd say just adding a deprecation warning won't break anything.

Having these make recipes in our main Makefile probably shouldn't be the final form of this. 
In #31356, I hope that we can restructure the docbuild as script packages (`sagemath_doc_html`, `sagemath_doc_pdf`), and in the next step as pip-installable packages (#29868).

Probably, but on another ticket. Should we start using `src/doc/Makefile` for more than just cleaning? As I said earlier, I am unclear on the distro situation: I don't know what packages are going to be available in general, and in particular in this case: if we have the documentation source files, can we be guaranteed to have `sage_docbuild`?

In any case, this may all fit somehow into #31356 and related tickets.

I'm experimenting with this and it seems to be working. A few questions about our Makefiles:

- Where is SAGE_ROOT defined? It appears to work if I just use it in `src/doc/Makefile`, but I don't know why.

- Do I need to use `+$(MAKE_REC)` or can I just use `$(MAKE)`? The latter seems to work.

- Do I need to define `AM_V_at` in this Makefile, or does it inherit the definition from `build/make/Makefile`?

It comes from the environment and is set in `build/make/install`. 

> - Do I need to use `+$(MAKE_REC)` or can I just use `$(MAKE)`? The latter seems to work.


`$(MAKE)` is fine here - https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#MAKE-Variable

> - Do I need to define `AM_V_at` in this Makefile, or does it inherit the definition from `build/make/Makefile`?


You'd need to copy this definition from Makefile.in; it's not exported

I am seeing a race condition, sphinx may race `FileExistsError`, cf. e.g.

```
[dochtml] [reference] preparing documents... skipping loading of indexes... done
[dochtml] [reference] Merging js index files...
[dochtml] [reference]     algebras: 4424 js index entries
[dochtml] [reference]     arithgroup: 1204 js index entries

[dochtml] [reference]     topology: 1937 js index entries
[dochtml] [reference]     valuations: 973 js index entries
[dochtml] [reference] ... done (64387 js index entries)
[dochtml] [reference] copying static files... failed
[dochtml] [reference] WARNING: cannot copy static file
FileExistsError(17, 'File exists')
[dochtml] [reference] dumping search index in English (code: en)... done
[dochtml] [reference] The HTML pages are in
local/share/doc/sage/html/en/reference.
[dochtml] Error building the documentation.
```

`make -j1`
allows the docs to build. 

See e.g. https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/runs/3104375540

It's of course not totally surprising that several processes may try to, say, create the same directory. Perhaps the relevant part of the builder should be launched with this specific error being ignored?

I think this part of the process (copying static files) is controlled by Sphinx, not by Sage or its modifications to Sphinx, for what that's worth.
