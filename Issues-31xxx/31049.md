(from #31004)

When `configure --enable-editable` is in use (default after #32406), the installed `sage-version.sh` is corrupted.

... causing:

```
$ venv/bin/sage -version
./local/var/lib/sage/venv-python3.10/bin/sage-version.sh: line 3: __requires__: command not found
./local/var/lib/sage/venv-python3.10/bin/sage-version.sh: line 4: syntax error near unexpected token `'pkg_resources''
./local/var/lib/sage/venv-python3.10/bin/sage-version.sh: line 4: `__import__('pkg_resources').require('sagemath-standard==9.7b5')'
```

Also affected: `sage-gdb-commands` (#33627)

`setup.py develop` is what `sdh_pip_editable_install` boils down to.
