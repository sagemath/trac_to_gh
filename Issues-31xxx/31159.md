```
Currently, if a package fails to build, the user sees the following:

```
************************************************************************
Error building package python3-3.8.5
************************************************************************
Please email sage-devel (http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel)
explaining the problem and including the log file
  ...sage/logs/pkgs/python3-3.8.5.log
Describe your computer, operating system, etc.
```
On the mailing list, the first thing we do in many cases is to ask the reported to send config.log as well.

In this ticket, we update the instructions so that hopefully we can skip one step.

Good call, this should help. Ideally we could also have a script
to zip the relevant files and suggest posting the zipped form to
the list. Zipping typically shrinks logs by a factor at least 5.
But let us get this in.
