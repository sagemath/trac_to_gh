Currently, an error is raised when constructing a quaternion algebra over a base ring that is not a field.  This can be weakened to the condition that the base ring is a commutative ring in which 2 is a unit.

For backwards compatibility, when using the syntax `QuaternionAlgebra(a, b)`, the elements `a` and `b` must lie in a domain `R`, and the resulting quaternion algebra is defined over the fraction field of `R`.

There should be some tests showing that multiplication works without issues when the base ring is not a field.  Also, in the documentation, is the construction `QuaternionAlgebra(a, b)` okay if `a` and `b` have the same parent which is an integral domain where 2 is invertible?  Or do you need to give the ring explicitly in this case?
