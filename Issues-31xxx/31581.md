Creating a free module morphism with a matrix and without specifying its codomain, currently creates a codomain spanned by row of the matrix. 

This causes a problem when creating a vector-space homomorphism with an integer matrix.


```
sage: V = QQ^2; m = identity_matrix(2)                                          
sage: V.hom(m)                                                                  
Free module morphism defined by the matrix
[1 0]
[0 1]
Domain: Vector space of dimension 2 over Rational Field
Codomain: Ambient free module of rank 2 over the principal ideal domain Integer Ring
```

Here the codomain should be a **Q**-vector space, not a **Z**-module, this is not a morphism.

I don't think this is a good fix. There is no reason to enforce the codomain to be a pushout of the domain (and something else). The construction of a morphism with generators should use whatever `im_gens` is provided or raise an error.

More importantly, the only problem I see with the description is the fact that the result is not a morphism. This should have been detected and an appropriate error raised.

When we use "Hom(V)", or equivalently "hom(-, V)", we specify the codomain. It should indeed output an error if the wrong codomain is given, instead of the current

```
sage: V = QQ^2
sage: V.hom(identity_matrix(2), ZZ^2)                                              
Vector space morphism represented by the matrix:
[1 0]
[0 1]
Domain: Vector space of dimension 2 over Rational Field
Codomain: Ambient free module of rank 2 over the principal ideal domain Integer Ring
```





The question here should be : given a list of images, what is the *correct* way to build a codomain? 

Mathematically, the pushout is the minimal way to make it work, and won't do anything if the codomain base ring is already big enough. However, I don't have a strong opinion about whether it *should* always work, so I pushed the suggested change, and added this case as an example in the documentation so that it's clearer that for our example, one should write either 



```
sage: V = QQ^2
sage: V.hom(identity_matrix(2), V)
```



or 


```
sage: V = QQ^2
sage: V.hom(identity_matrix(QQ, 2))
```


Now the previous cases return a ValueError

```
sage: V = QQ^2; W = ZZ^2                                                                                                         
sage: V.hom(identity_matrix(2))                                               
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: The base ring of the domain must be contained in the base ring of the codomain
