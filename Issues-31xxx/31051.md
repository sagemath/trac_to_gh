```
On some systems, e.g. Fedora 32, `/bin` is a symlink to `/usr/bin`
and the `PATH` has the symlink `/bin` in front of `/usr/bin`.

In this situation, with the version of `build/pkgs/gp2c/spkg-configure.m4`
from #30231 (merged in Sage 9.2.beta8), running `./configure` fails
while checking for `gp2c`.

This ticket amends `build/pkgs/gp2c/spkg-configure.m4` to solve
that problem.

The problem occurs even without trying to build `gp2c`, as currently
`configure` checks for system packages including of disabled optional
packages (see #29498 for fixing that).

True, and building gp2c should also fail since we don't know where pari.cfg is. Like the comment says, "If we can't find pari.cfg, gp2c isn't going to work."

What was the original `./configure` command, and what did it output? What does it output after the message was changed to a warning? Something is fishy.

Ok, there are two things weird:

1. Why is it trying to install the (optional) gp2c package when you haven't enabled it with `--enable-gp2c`?
2. Why can't it find your system `pari.cfg`?

The real problem is the first item... but, I'm curious. Your config log shows...

```
configure:17361: checking for gp
configure:17379: found /bin/gp
```

Is that really where `gp` lives, or is it a symlink to `/usr/bin/gp`? Perhaps `/bin` is a symlink to `/usr/bin`? We use that path when guessing the location of `pari.cfg`, so having it return `/bin/gp` instead of `/usr/bin/gp` would throw a wrench into things. It's an easy fix however.

(But regardless, you haven't enabled gp2c at all, so you shouldn't be hitting this problem.)

This should fix the second problem, and allow `--enable-gp2c` to work on systems where `/bin` is a symlink to `/usr/bin`. I still have no idea about the larger issue, though.

-Without this change, I can not run `./configure` on fedora 32,

+On some systems, e.g. Fedora 32, `/bin` is a symlink to `/usr/bin`

pari.cfg file can be found in the PARI object directory and is installed in $prefix/lib/pari/.

this is in gp2c docs of the Par project:
https://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/pub/pari/manuals/gp2c/gp2c.html

Fedora is wrong about the location it installs pari.cfg to
