As reported in this [ask.sagemath question](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/55527/subs-in-vector-field/), tensor fields are endowed with a method `subs()` which is totally ineffective:

```
sage: E.<x,y> = EuclideanSpace()                                                                    
sage: a = var('a')                                                                                  
sage: v = E.vector_field(a*x, a^2 + y)                                                              
sage: v.display()                                                                                   
a*x e_x + (a^2 + y) e_y
sage: v.subs(a==1)                                                                                  
Vector field on the Euclidean plane E^2
sage: v.display()                                                                                   
a*x e_x + (a^2 + y) e_y
```
This is because `subs()` is inherited from the generic base class `Element` and the code of `Element.subs()` has

```
        parent = self._parent
        try:
            ngens = parent.ngens()
        except (AttributeError, NotImplementedError, TypeError):
            return self
```
Since `v.parent().ngens()` returns an `AttributeError`, this explains the silent failure. 



Currently, the required substitution can be achieved by means of the method `apply_map`:

```
sage: v.apply_map(lambda comp: comp.subs(a==1))                                                     
sage: v.display()                                                                                   
x e_x + (y + 1) e_y
```
