Functions in pynac expect the `gcd` of two rational numbers `p` and `q` to be the largest number `d`, such that `p/d` and `q/d` are integers (except that `gcd(0,0) = 0`). But pynac's `numeric::gcd` method says that `gcd(p,1) = 1` for all `p`, which does not have to be true when `p` is not an integer.

That seems reasonable, but needs some thought, because it will change the value of the function in some cases. Without the change you suggest, I think `1.gcd(b)` will return `1` whenever `b` is a `PyObject` (such as a complex number), even if the denominator of `b` is not `1` (for example, if `b` is a rational multiple of `I`).

PS. Once the correct behaviour has been implemented, the description of the `gcd(const numeric &a, const numeric &b)` function (in this same file) should be corrected. It currently says "return  The GCD of two numbers if both are integer, a numerical 1 if they are not."
