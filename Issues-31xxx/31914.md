... by means of `element_of` (#24171) and possibly `or_symbolic` (#31911) 

This is a step toward evaluation/simplification of piecewise functions.

Similar to sympy's `contains` method (see #31926) (contrast: `__contains__`)



Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31914
