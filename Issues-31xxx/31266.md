If this happens we should fall back on the usual tensor product.

We don't do a check for the characteristic 2 case when setting the category. It just by default always puts it in the category of supercommutative Hopf algebras. Does something change mathematically in this case?

I will change the test do work in char 3 so it will have a guaranteed distinction between the two.

Of course, but I was wondering if there could be some other structural difference, such as it no longer satisfied one of the supercommutative Hopf algebra axioms due to the extra freedom. If the category still makes sense, then I don't see a reason why we shouldn't keep it. Likewise, I don't see a point of making a special-case for characteristic 2 in the tensor construction.

Because the signs don't matter, the following should return True:

```
sage: SteenrodAlgebra(2) in HopfAlgebras(GF(2))
False
```
whereas this should be false (as it is) in other characteristics. Maybe this should return True as well:

```
sage: GradedHopfAlgebrasWithBasis(GF(2)) == SuperHopfAlgebrasWithBasis(GF(2))
False
```
Not for this ticket, though.

The change looks okay to me, but every time I look at tensor products in Sage, I get confused. The documentation for `tensor` says

```
   This functor takes a collection of graded algebras (possibly with
   basis) and constructs the signed tensor product of those algebras.
   If this algebra is in a subcategory, say that of
   "Algebras(QQ).Graded()", it is automatically endowed with its
   natural algebra structure, thanks to the category
   "Algebras(QQ).Graded().SignedTensorProducts()" of signed tensor
   products of graded algebras.
```
So it's not clear that it should be used with elements in the first place. In this case, `a.tensor(s)` fails without the fix here but works with it, so I am happy with the change, but should the documentation of `tensor` be changed, or do we want the `tensor` function to apply only to parents, while the `tensor` method applies to elements?

Actually, I take that back, I'm not happy with the change. You're modifying `tensor` inside `ParentMethods` but applying it to elements. The documentation says "Return the tensor product of the parents," and the previous doctests apply to parents, not elements. Am I missing something?

It is a functor, so I would expect it to work on the elements as well. I feel like this is just documenting the parent construction, and while it could be more explicit that it also takes in elements, we would also have to change the `tensor` functor and likely any of the others in the global namespace for consistency.
