I would think a better name for this method would be something like `naive_height`. I am cc-ing some people who might have an opinion on this.

A few minor doc things:

```diff
         """
-         Return the max degree between the denominator and numerator .
+        Return the max degree between the denominator and numerator.
```
and remove these blanklines:

```diff
             sage: f.height_ff_element()
             1
-        
-
-         
         """
-
         return max(self._x.denominator().degree(),self._x.numerator().degree())
```
and before the `def height_ff_element`.

The "degree" of an element of a function field is commonly understood (at least in the area of algebraic geometry codes where function fields are extensively used) as the negative value of the valuation of the element at an infinite place of the function field. For rational function field, "degree" is simply the usual degree of the numerator minus the usual degree of the denominator. 

It seems to me that the implemented method is comparable with the `height` that measures the complexity of rational numbers, in the context of rational function field.

In conclusion, I suggest to rename the method just to `height`, without `ff_element` part.

Well, I agree that this definition of degree is also more or less common.

However, in general algebraic geometry, the degree of a mapping is more often defined as the number of preimages of the generic point (which is also the degree of the underlying algebraic ring extension). For rational functions, it agrees with the maximum of the degree of the numerator and the denominator. That's where this definition comes from.

I understand this argument but my feeling is that the word `height` is usually reserved for algebraic numbers, or varieties defined over number fields: Weil heights, Neron-Tate heights, Faltings heights, etc. are all defined in this context.

Maybe calling the method `height` for rational functions over finite fields would make sense but for a rational function over `QQ`, I really expect a `height` method to return a measure of the size of the coefficients (and the aforementioned Wikipedia page agrees).

So, I would continue to argue for using `degree`.

There is one doctest failure in `ideal.py`. I don't know how this ticket is related with the failure. Anyway the doctest itself seems fragile. So I suggest to change it like

```diff
             sage: K.<x> = FunctionField(GF(4))
             sage: O = K.maximal_order()
             sage: I = O.ideal(x^3*(x+1)^2)
-            sage: I._factor()
-            [(Ideal (x) of Maximal order of Rational function field in x
-            over Finite Field in z2 of size 2^2, 3),
+            sage: I.factor()  # indirect doctest
+            (Ideal (x) of Maximal order of Rational function field in x
+            over Finite Field in z2 of size 2^2)^3 *
             (Ideal (x + 1) of Maximal order of Rational function field in x
-            over Finite Field in z2 of size 2^2, 2)]
+            over Finite Field in z2 of size 2^2)^2
```
