This tickets adds a new class for dense matrices over `Zmod(N)` implemented using FLINT's `nmod_mat_t` type, along with some supporting ancillary changes:

* Changed echelon form over `Zmod(N)` for composite `N` to return the Howell form (see the introduction and Chapter 4 of [Storjohann's thesis](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~astorjoh/diss2up.pdf)).  Since this echelon form can have more rows than the input matrix, made some supporting changes including a new method `_echelon_copy`.
* Changed rank over `Zmod(N)` to return the number of leading 1s in Howell form (it raised a `NotImplementedError` before), and `pivots` to be the locations of these leading 1s.  There is also a method `_pivots` for accessing the columns where the leading entry is not 1.
* Matrices modulo composite `N` have improved speed and functionality for inversion, `charpoly`, `det`, `minpoly`, `echelon_form`, `solve_right` and `right_kernel_matrix`.  There is also a new method `minpoly_ideal` for the ideal vanishing on a matrix (the natural generalization of the minimal polynomial, which generates this ideal when it is principal).
* Changed `stack` and `augment` to return a matrix over a common base ring of the two inputs, rather than just using the top/left matrix to determine the base ring.
* A new method `_change_implementation` on matrices, together with rough heuristics for matrices on matrices mod `N` in determining when it's worth switching between FLINT and linbox (linbox is faster for large matrices, FLINT for smaller, and FLINT offers extra functionality for matrices modulo composite integers).
* Support multiplication of matrices with different implementations
* Add FLINT's `ulong_extras` for number theoretic functions on longs
* Add some iterators related to split primes in cyclotomic fields in support of changes to `matrix_cyclo_dense` (which uses a multimodular approach), and moved the `_reduction_matrix` method to the base field which will yield better caching behavior.
* Fix some doctests that relate to choosing different solutions in `solve_right` and getting different random matrices with a different implementation.

<a id='comment:22'></a>If you aren't yet ready for comments, I apologize. However, I made a quick skim over things before I realized you set this as needs review for the patchbot.

For `def _change_implementation`, wouldn't it make more sense to be `cdef` or `cpdef` since it should be called entirely from internal stuff? Also, in that implementation, I don't think we should use `self.list()` for spare matrices. I also generally find using `sage.matrix.matrix_space.MatrixSpace` unstable and think it is better to have a direct import.

I know you said this is for the patchbot, but it would be good to have doctests for `_solve_right_modn`. I would also add

```
cdef list X
cdef Py_ssize_t n
```
change

```diff
-            X = self.matrix_space(B.ncols(), self.ncols())(X)
-            return X.T
+            return self.matrix_space(B.ncols(), self.ncols())(X).T
```
(perhaps casting the result as a matrix too), and mark `B` as a `Matrix`.

I am not sure about the name of the files being `matrix_nmod_dense` and the subsequently the name of the class. It conflicts with the `matrix_modn_*` files and I feel it is too generic given that it is for a specific implementation.

Why is `poly_crt` in the matrix file?

`can't` -> `cannot` as we want to make the writing formal.

It would be good to implement a `get_is_zero_unsafe` method.

Yea, I didn't quite realize that either. ^^;;

The former for the name of the file, the latter for the name of the class considering the other matrix classes in Sage.

Let me know if there is anything I can do to help too.

Even for a 2 by 2 matrix where the calling overhead is most substantial, changing to `cpdef` makes a negligible difference:

```

[  2 112]
sage: %time B = A._change_implementation("linbox") # using def                                                                                                
CPU times: user 339 µs, sys: 8 µs, total: 347 µs
Wall time: 350 µs
```

```

I don't think it's worth the cost of recompiling everything depending on `matrix0.pxd`, and the risk of developers accidentally using `def` instead of `cpdef` on a matrix class in the future.

I agree about sparse matrices, but currently in `sage.matrix.matrix_space.get_matrix_class` we don't allow the `implementation` keyword for sparse matrices, so the issue is moot.  I'd be happy to have more sparse matrices in Sage eventually, but for now there's no way to even test a version of `_change_implementation` in `Matrix_sparse`.

I've added the `cdef Py_ssize_t n` since that can speed up the loop, and made the change you suggested in the diff.  I don't think it's necessary to mark `X` as a list or `B` as a matrix, since I'm not calling any functions that will benefit from knowing the types (and the runtime is surely dominated by the call to Pari's `matsolvemod`)

Agreed.  I've changed it to `matrix_modn_dense_flint`.

I've created #31731 and removed it from this ticket.

Both done.

+This tickets adds a new class for dense matrices over `Zmod(N)` implemented using FLINT's `nmod_mat_t` type, along with some supporting ancillary changes:
