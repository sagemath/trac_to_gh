**Update:** The successor to this ticket is #31404 which offers a different approach by using gappy directly in Sage rather than providing Sage-specific wrappers.  I think it is overall a better approach for now.

Package tarball: see `checksums.ini`; use `./configure --enable-download-from-upstream-url` to test.

[gappy](https://github.com/embray/gappy) is a new !Python/Cython package providing a Python interface to GAP using its public "libgap" API (to the extent possible).

It is the result of extracting Sage's `sage.libs.gap` package into a standalone package without a dependency on Sage, so it still bears some of the legacy of that package (which will continue to be cleaned up and improved on).

One particular improvement is the help system for GAP functions--as before it is possible to extract documentation (when it exists) from the GAP docs, but this is faster now (previously the pexpect interface was still required) and can usually extract *only* the documentation for the queried function (previously it would also append the entire rest of the documentation chapter). It may also introduce some minor performance improvements in some areas, but it will be interesting to test this with some non-trivial examples.

This ticket is to attempt to convert `sage.libs.gap` to a wrapper around gappy (rather than replace it entirely).  The main reason a wrapper is still needed, is in order to participate in Sage's coercion model.

The GAP interpreter wrapper class `sage.libs.gap.libgap.Gap` is a `Parent`, and its elements are instances of `GapElement` and subclasses thereof which are subclasses of `Element`.

This presents a challenge which makes wrapping gappy less straightforward than one would hope: Because the classes `gappy.Gap` and `gappy.GapObj` (its equivalent of `GapElement`) are cdef classes, as well as `Parent` and `Element`, it is not possible to use multiple inheritance like

```
class GapElement(GapObj, Element):
    ...
```

because their base structs are incompatible.  The current workaround to this is that `GapElement` is a wrapper for a `GapObj` (which in turn wraps C-level GAP `Obj` pointers).  This creates a bit of unfortunate overhead, albeit not much; by using `cdef` and `cpdef` methods, Cython can make the call to wrapped objects reasonably fast in many cases.

## TODO

* Rework the `sage.libs.gap.assigned_names` and `sage.libs.gap.all_documented_functions` modules.

* Fix more uses within sage of the deprecated `Gap.function_factory` method.

* Fix more tests; all test are passing in `sage.libs.gap` as well as all in `sage.groups.perm_gps`, but some tests elsewhere are failing.

* There are miscellaneous other functions in `sage.libs.gap` that can probably be deprecated or removed.

### Food for thought...

There are some other possible workarounds to this issue I would like to explore in the future.

The first is to change how gappy works: Rather than `Gap` and `GapObj` being `cdef` classes, they could be pure-Python wrappers around some `cdef` classes.  This would again create some overhead, but hopefully not too much.  Then they can participate in multiple inheritance with Sage's `Parent` and `Element` classes.

The other two, which would be much more disruptive, but also possibly useful for other packages that would like to integrate with Sage without explicitly depending on it, and have been discussed before:

1) Create a relatively Sage "base" package with little to no mathematical functionality but that provides base classes for some of Sage's structural classes such as `SageObject`, `Parent`, and `Element` (maybe also `CategoryObject`?).  These base classes need not replicate the full functionality found in Sage, but just enough to provide some bootstrapping.

2) A similar but subtly different option is to make classes like `SageObject`, `Parent`, and `Element` into Abstract Base Classes.

A quick remark on `install-requires`: For prerelease versions, it's best to use the exact version; version ranges may not work (see
[#30913 comment:81](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/30913#comment:81)), 
so it should be `gappy ==0.1.0a0`

`gappy` is an excellent news!

I would like to bring the attention to cypari2 that played the role of gappy at the time the PARI/GP interface in Sage became an independent Cython module. In particular, if any design decision has to be made, it would be weird if they would be different for both interfaces.

First of all, two things that seem different from the rough description of the ticket
- there is no extra layer between cypari2 and Sage. Sage deals with `cypari2.gen.Gen` objects directly.
- cypari2 is completely agnostic to Sage and its coercion system

There was no need for coercion because the most basic possible happen : in any mixture, everything is converted to a cypari2 Gen object. Here with integers

```
sage: type(1 + pari(1))
<class 'cypari2.gen.Gen'>
sage: type(pari(1) + 1)
<class 'cypari2.gen.Gen'>
```
Here with matrices

```
sage: type(pari("[1, 2; 3, 4]") + matrix(2, [1,1,1,1]))
<class 'cypari2.gen.Gen'>
sage: type(matrix(2, [1,1,1,1]) + pari("[1, 2; 3, 4]"))
<class 'cypari2.gen.Gen'>
```
I do not see the difference here with the GAP interface. In what sort of construction the interaction with categories/coercion has to be handled? I would like a more concrete description if possible.

On a related note, cypari2 introduced the standardized name `__pari__` for the method that would provide a conversion of any object to its cypari2 equivalent. That way, any Python library could make interaction with cypari2.

For the cypari2 -> Sage conversion, there is `sage.libs.pari.convert_sage.gen_to_sage` which is a partial but efficient converter. It introduced a slowdown in conversions PARI/GP -> Sage because the `sage` method on `cypari2.gen.Gen` (which was kept) became

```python
cdef class Gen:
    def sage(self, locals=None):
        r"""
        Return the closest SageMath equivalent of the given PARI object.

        INPUT:

        - ``locals`` -- optional dictionary used in fallback cases that
          involve ``sage_eval``

        See :func:`~sage.libs.pari.convert_sage.gen_to_sage` for more information.
        """
        from sage.libs.pari.convert_sage import gen_to_sage
        return gen_to_sage(self, locals)
```

AFAICT this makes some minor performance improvements in construction of permutation groups from Sage -> GAP, but might be a little slower for going from GAP -> Sage.

A good stress test would be iterating through the E<sub>7</sub> Weyl group:

```
sage: W = CoxeterGroup('E7', implementation='permutation')
sage: W.cardinality()                                                                                                     
2903040
sage: %time for w in W.iteration('depth', False): pass                                                                    
CPU times: user 1.05 s, sys: 391 µs, total: 1.05 s
Wall time: 1.05 s
```
If you are more brave, do E<sub>8</sub> (which has 696729600 elements), but that will take many minutes to complete. D<sub>9</sub> is perhaps a better intermediate example:

```
sage: W = CoxeterGroup('D9', implementation='permutation')                                                                
sage: W.cardinality()                                                                                                     
92897280
sage: %time for w in W.iteration('depth', False): pass                                                                    
CPU times: user 34.4 s, sys: 0 ns, total: 34.4 s
Wall time: 34.4 s
```

As long as the slowdown is relatively small, then I think this is a good way forward as it makes maintenance easier. Plus it will benefit the broader community.

so at least for this case no better but no worse.

In what sort of construction the interaction with categories/coercion has to be handled? I would like a more concrete description if possible.\n\nHonestly, I do not know.  I don't even understand the coercion system well-enough to say.  It's just because the old `sage.libs.gap` did use it, so I tried, for now, to keep the same interface for a couple reasons:\n\n* Backwards compatibility--I didn't want to break the existing API too much, especially if someone is writing code that explicitly checks for Sage `GapElement`s.  I do not know if anyone is actually doing this.\n\n* Consistency--the other Sage interfaces to other languages use the Parent/Element model so I just tried to keep that consistent.  Maybe it is not really necessary or useful though.  If someone can confirm for me that it isn't then we can use gappy more-or-less directly and do a way with a lot of extra complexity.\n\n> On a related note, cypari2 introduced the standardized name `__pari__` for the method that would provide a conversion of any object to its cypari2 equivalent. That way, any Python library could make interaction with cypari2.\n> \n> For the cypari2 -> Sage conversion, there is `sage.libs.pari.convert_sage.gen_to_sage` which is a partial but efficient converter. It introduced a slowdown in conversions PARI/GP -> Sage because the `sage` method on `cypari2.gen.Gen` (which was kept) became\n\nThis is one area where I think it's still useful to have wrapper classes in Sage; which is just to add a `.sage()` methods to gappy `GapObj`s.  But if they don't have to be `Element` subclasses, then they can simply subclass `GapObj` rather than wrap them.\n\n---\nNew commits:\n<table><tr><td><a href=\"https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/a07f20ecee90d82914116e45b31e58b93d0e3ca1\">a07f20e</a></td><td><code>Fixes needed for gappy v0.1.0a2 which did away with the libgap_soname</code></td></tr></table>\n",

Thanks for your comments Vincent.  Yes, this is definitely intended in the same vein as cypari2.

I think this is what I would prefer as well.

Here's the same examples using gappy directly.  The integers work:

```
sage: from gappy import gap                                                                                                                                                                      
sage: type(1 + gap(1))                                                                                                                                                                           
<class 'gappy.gapobj.GapInteger'>
sage: type(gap(1) + 1)                                                                                                                                                                           
<class 'gappy.gapobj.GapInteger'>
```

but the matrices do not for some reason; I think because gappy uses a `_gap_` magic method (similarly to `__pari__`, but this conflicts with Sage's existing `_gap_` magic method for using the GAP pexpect interface).  I get:

```
sage: type(gap([[1, 2], [3, 4]]) + matrix(2, [1, 1, 1, 1]))

It has the necessary converters registered to handle `SageObject`s correctly.

So it looks like gappy and cypari2 are indeed mostly similar in this case.

> I do not see the difference here with the GAP interface. In what sort of construction the interaction with categories/coercion has to be handled? I would like a more concrete description if possible.

Honestly, I do not know.  I don't even understand the coercion system well-enough to say.  It's just because the old `sage.libs.gap` did use it, so I tried, for now, to keep the same interface for a couple reasons:

* Backwards compatibility--I didn't want to break the existing API too much, especially if someone is writing code that explicitly checks for Sage `GapElement`s.  I do not know if anyone is actually doing this.

* Consistency--the other Sage interfaces to other languages use the Parent/Element model so I just tried to keep that consistent.  Maybe it is not really necessary or useful though.  If someone can confirm for me that it isn't then we can use gappy more-or-less directly and do a way with a lot of extra complexity.

This is one area where I think it's still useful to have wrapper classes in Sage; which is just to add a `.sage()` methods to gappy `GapObj`s.  But if they don't have to be `Element` subclasses, then they can simply subclass `GapObj` rather than wrap them.

Another possibility is that just as user classes can have a `_gap_` method to convert to GAP-compatible representations, gappy could add a system for registering "GAP -> <whatever>" converters.  They could have `.sage()` methods tacked on to them without having to make subclasses.

Could we try to make the direct interface work as well? I mean as far as binary operators are concerned, it should be fine to mix gappy elements with SageMath elements. If an intermediate layer is needed it could also be introduced. I think gappy is a good occasion to clean the design of the gap interface.

hmm. PARI/GP is a counterexemple to that.

One construction I can imagine where the layer could be relevant is if you want to use some gap objects as coefficients of a matrix. To do that, you would use

```
sage: MatrixSpace(GapBaseRing(), 3, 3)

where `GapBaseRing()` would be a GapObj modelling a ring of numbers. Then if `GapBaseRing()` is not recognized as a proper ring from SageMath such construction would be impossible. I am not sure it is currently used anywhere.

> > On a related note, cypari2 introduced the standardized name `__pari__` for the method that would provide a conversion of any object to its cypari2 equivalent. That way, any Python library could make interaction with cypari2.

Actually one could use `__gap__` (double underscore) for the gappy objects and keep the single underscore `_gap_/_libgap_` for the one with coercion layer. The double score convention is more Pythonic and, I think, prefered outside of [SageMath](../wiki/SageMath). Moreover, I believe the simple underscore could be as generic as

```

cdef class Element(SageObject):

        from sage.libs.gap.wrapper import GappyWrapperWithCoercion
        return GappyWrapperWithCoercion(self.__gap__())
```

The new version I just pushed shows some examples of how it works: https://gappy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#gappy.gapobj.GapObj.convert_to

See in particular the example of

```
@GapList.convert_to('numpy')
```

which registers a converter from `GapList` to Numpy arrays.  Same could be done for `GapFoo.convert_to('sage')`.

Integer constructor has a special case for cypari2

```
file: src/sage/rings/integer.pyx
cdef class Integer(Element):
    def __init__(self, x):
        ...
        elif isinstance(x, pari_gen):
            set_from_pari_gen(self, x)
```
This is the general approach taken by cypari2. Though, maybe it is not desirable to clutter the sage element constructors.

Maybe just as there is `__pari__` and `__gap__` we should develop a standard for a `__sage__` magic method that Sage can call on objects from other libraries in order to get their equivalent representation as a Sage type.

For now I could add a special case in the Integer constructor but I agree it's not ideal.  I noticed it's also the case in the permutation element 

```
cdef class PermutationGroupElement(MultiplicativeGroupElement):
    ...
    def __init__(self, g, parent, check=True):
        ...
        elif isinstance(g, GapElement):
            if isinstance(g, GapElement_Permutation):
                self._set_libgap(g.obj)
            elif isinstance(g, GapElement_String):
                self._set_string(g.sage())
            elif isinstance(g, GapElement_List):
                self._set_list_images(g.sage(), convert)
            else:
                raise ValueError("invalid data to initialize a permutation")
        ...
```

So, nothing very "magic" going on...

Good point. The remark applies equally to gappy and cypari2 (and possibly other libraries).

In the same vein that Erik proposed in [comment:26] we could introduce a way to register conversions to Sage so that `ZZ(my_cypari2_object)` (construction from the parent) works. One would then drop the support for `Integer(my_cypari2_object)` (construction from the element class). There will be some time penalty in doing this. But fast conversion functions would remain available in `sage.libs.pari`.

On the other hand, `Integer` does implement a `__pari__` method for conversion to cypari2. That should be changed at the same time.

Beyond conversions, many methods of `Integer` depend exlicitely on `__pari__`
- `perfect_power`
- `is_prime_power`
- `is_prime`
- `next_probable_prime`
- `next_prime`
- `previous_prime`
- etc
Given that, I don't see how we could make `Integer` independent of cypari2 without removing most of it functionalities.
