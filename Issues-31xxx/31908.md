The current implementation of the extraction of the asymptotics of coefficients along a chosen diagonal for combinatorial multivariate generating functions (`sage.rings.asymptotic.asymptotics_multivariate_generating_functions`) requires users to compute the minimal critical points on their own.

In a recent paper by Melczer and Salvy, https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.04187, a method for computing these points (including numerical certification that the found points are actually minimal critical points) has been outlined. This should be implemented as a new feature for the existing module (including necessary adaptions of the existing interface).

(There was some discussion about this in the AMS Math Research Community *Combinatorial Applications of Computational Geometry and Algebraic Topology* which took place from May 30 to June 5.)
