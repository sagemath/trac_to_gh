> Michael, do you agree with the positive review?


Yes. I still find some style changes unnecessary, e.g.

```diff
-    def set_embedding(self, phi, inverse=None, var=None,
-                      t_inverse=None):
+    def set_embedding(
+        self, phi: ContinuousMap, inverse=None, var=None, t_inverse=None
+    ):
```

leaving a glimpse of inconsistency behind. If that could be changed: I am happy. But I can also live with this. I would just appreciated it if we can stick to previously established styling rules in the future. Otherwise the code becomes more a patchwork rug than it already is.
