According to https://autotools.io/pkgconfig/pkg_check_modules.html you shouldn't use `==` but `=`. And it is indeed correct here

```
fbissey@equinoxe ~ $ pkg-config --exists --print-errors "libzip = 1.7"
Requested 'libzip = 1.7' but version of libzip is 1.7.3
fbissey@equinoxe ~ $ pkg-config --exists --print-errors "libzip == 1.7"
Unknown version comparison operator '==' after package name 'libzip' in file '(command line arguments)'
```
