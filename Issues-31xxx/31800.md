(Slack matrix is basically the same as incidence matrix and should use the code from `Polyhedron_base.incidence_matrix` to do the conversion.

Given an incidence matrix, you want to delete all rows and columns of all-ones (maybe, that is a problem with lines though and with cones). Then you want to remove all non-maximal "facets" and all non-minimal "vertices". Finally we need to know how the new labels correspond to the old labels.

Did I get that right?

Let `F` be the meet of the given facets and `G` be the join of the given vertices. Obtain the interval `[F, G]` as combinatorial polyhedron (with specified order of Vrep and Hrep).

Is this what you had in mind?
