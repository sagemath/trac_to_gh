As pointed out in [this ask sage question](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/55824/typeerror-in-parametric_plot3d-with-real-or-imag/) (and #17684), `parametric_plot3d` gives a `TypeError` when plotting the real part of a symbolic square root:

```
sage: x, y = var("x y")
sage: parametric_plot3d([sqrt(x + I*y).real(), 0, 0], (x, -1, 1), (y, -1, 1))

    <long Traceback>

   1907             if c.imag == 0:
   1908                 return c.real
-> 1909             raise TypeError('unable to coerce to a real number')
   1910 
   1911     def _complex_double_(self, CDF):

TypeError: unable to coerce to a real number
```
The error goes away when `sqrt` is replaced with `exp`, `sin`, `cos`, or `tan`, but not when it is replaced with `log` or or `asin` or `acos` or `atan`. Replacing `real` with `imag` gives the same results, except that there is no error when `log` is combined with `imag`.
