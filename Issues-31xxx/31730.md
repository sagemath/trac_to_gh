We add a new option `unimodular`, which will be useful for lattice point applications.

More generally, given a (not necessarily orthogonal) direct sum decomposition of the ambient space into a rational vector space L #30203 and a direct complement M, use an affine transformation that is lattice-preserving for L and, depending on the other options, arbitrary/orthogonal/orthonormal for M.


Depends on #27366
