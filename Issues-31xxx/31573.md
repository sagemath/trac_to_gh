Initiated by this [mathoverflow question](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/383331/understanding-the-implementation-of-the-p-adic-sigma-function-in-sagemath) I propose to improve the documentation of `sigma` for a formal group of an elliptic curve as well as simplify it.

For historic reasons, it produced a power series with coefficients containing one, now useless, indeterminate. This ticket changes the code to return simply a power series in the base field of the elliptic curve. And it clarifies the documentation.
