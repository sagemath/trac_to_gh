We define the category of open subsets of a topological space.

- The category is a `CategoryWithParameters`
- A parent is an open subset.
- An element is a point in the open subset.
- A morphism is an inclusion map.


A concrete implementation for open subsets of a topological manifold:

- A parent has a `ManifoldSubsetFamily` instance that stores the equivalence class of named subsets that are known to be equal


This is preparation for #31703.

Why do we need a category of open sets? Wouldn't it be better to represent the actual *set* of open subsets, i.e. the set-theoretic notion of topology? This is then an object of the category of topologies.

As for the parent-element framework this would mean: the topology is the parent, and its elements are open subsets.

The only property we need is that of the homset. Isn't it a bit overkill to give it a whole category by itself? What does speak against a concrete implementation of the topology of a manifold, which comes in handy on many occasions, and then introducing a category of topologies? The homset between elements of the topology can then be established as induced by the poset structure of subsets. These homsets can still be implemented on the level of the category of topologies.

> Also, in case it isn't clear, it is okay to have the homset be empty.


Yes, it is clear. But I just learned category theory and some things still confuse me at the first glimpse.

Example at hand:

Set of Morphisms from 1 to 2 in Category of elements of Integer Ring
```

I'd rather like to see open subsets as objects of the category of elements of a topology than giving it a bare category.

After a little chat with Travis, and a little thought myself, I think that Travis's latter proposal, i.e. seeing the category of open subsets as subcategory of subobjects of topological spaces, is indeed a good idea.

The sheaf implementation is already on a good way and doesn't necessarily need a family structure (though it would be nice from a mathematical viewpoint imo).

Even though I still like the idea of the topology being realized as a set rather than a category more, I can live with that approach, too.
