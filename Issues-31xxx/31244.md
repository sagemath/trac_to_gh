I don't understand the need for this function, because sage's "modulo" operator `%` works for polynomials:

```
sage: Qx.<x> = QQ[x]

the modulo operator doesn't work in this example

```

sage: FF.<t> = FunctionField(QQ)                                                
sage: f= t^3+t^2+1 ;f                                                           
t^3 + t^2 + 1
sage: g= t^2+ 1 ;g                                                              
t^2 + 1
sage: f%g   
sage: f.mod(g) 
```


the % operator returns an error


                    
the function mod ( f.mod(g) ) always returns zero regardless of f and g





thanks for taking the time to respond

0 is the correct answer for `f.mod(g)` (unless g = 0), because 1/g is in FF. 

However, perhaps it would make sense to have a `polynomial` method that returns `f.numerator()` if `f` is a polynomial (and gives a `ValueError` otherwise). This would allow a user to treat `f` as a polynomial. For example, they could write `f.polynomial() % g.polynomial()` or `f.polynomial().mod(g.polynomial())`.
