We eliminate direct reading of files from the package directories of sagelib by using `importlib.resources` (available since python 3.7) 
- `git grep 'SAGE_EXTCODE' src/sage`
- `git grep '__file__' src/sage`

This will help make sagelib `zip_safe` (https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/userguide/miscellaneous.html#setting-the-zip-safe-flag)

In this ticket, we take care of `sage.repl`, moving data needed by its doctests from `SAGE_EXTCODE` (= `src/sage/ext_data`) into the package directory. (Thus, we avoid a dependency on support for resources in namespace packages brought by Python 3.10(?) or the backport package `importlib-resources`, see https://github.com/python/importlib_resources/pull/196)

Follow-up tickets will deal with other parts of the library. In the end, the directory `src/sage/ext_data` will be eliminated.
