> But no BLAS implementation installs a libcblas.so or cblas.pc. Could it be that this is not really needed and provided by libblas.so together with cblas.h?


That's a Debian specific thing

https://salsa.debian.org/science-team/lapack/-/blob/master/debian/README.if-you-look-for-libcblas.so.3

The unpatched Netlib reference blas implementation does install a libcblas.so library.
