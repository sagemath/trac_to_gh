It seems like `numpy.distutils` gets confused by extra whitespace in the result of `gfortran -dumpversion`. This might be related to the use of `zsh` as the shell. 

This will need investigation by someone who has already made the switch to Big Sur...

I haven't tested the full homebrew-macos-11.0-xcode-minimal build, but I'm guessing it's related to MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET.

As I noted above, I can recreate the error with numpy by using sage's gfortran 9.2.0 on my machine with homebrew.  As per usual I think this is because python was built with MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET 11.0 and gfortran 9.2.0 can't recognize this value.

Now I know that at some point scipy's spkg-install.in file was changed to contain the lines:


```
if [ $MACOSX_VERSION -ge 20 ]; then
     export MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=11.0
fi
```

I'm not exactly sure what is in homebrew-macos-11.0-xcode-minimal, but if sage is building its own gfortran and its own python using a different MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET then I would guess that this line might be causing the problems.

It's been a while since I've thought about this problem, but it's possible that the above export might not be needed anymore since homebrew patched GCC.

For what it's worth, if I do

```
% make distclean && ./configure --with-system-gfortran=no && make
```
then the build fails on `numpy`, not `scipy`, but with the same sort of error:

```
ValueError: A valid Fortran version was not found in this string:

It's actually worse than just extra newlines.  I tried manually patching to strip all whitespace from both ends, but that didn't solve the problem.  I dumped the contents of the version_string which is causing numpy to fail into a text file and it turned out to be

"gfortran: warning: couldn't understand version 11

9.3.0"

(I tested with gcc 9.3, but the same happens with 9.2)

I can get numpy and scipy to build by manually forcing MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET to be 10.16 but it seems that 11 and 11.0 both cause problems.

Here is a proposal for how to deal with this:

1.  Remove the if statements from scipy's spkg-install to set MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET to 11.0.  I don't think this is needed anymore since Homebrew patched GCC 10 but I can do some testing on that.

2.  At some point in the build process we take a look at MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET, which can be easily done with something like


```
python3 -c "import sysconfig; print(sysconfig.get_config_var('MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET'))"
```

if we get back a value of 11 and yet the version of gfortran we are using is less than 10.2.0 then we change MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET to 10.16 or something like that.

I tried running on github CI, but it quit after a few days and only got through 10.15.  I just took out 10.15 and am trying again...

I tried to run the CI tests on 11.0 but I got the following error message:

"No runner matching the specified labels was found: macos-11.0"

Is there a different way I should get the tests to run on Big Sur?
