GLPK (GNU Linear Programming Kit) version 5.0
was released on 2020-12-16.

The last version was GLPK 4.65, released on 2018-02-16,
to which we upgraded in #24824.

>- `src/api/rmfgen.c`
>- `src/misc/qmd.c`
>- `src/misc/relax4.c`

It looks like the only significant change - packaging wise - is that the patch `dont_print_Longstepwillbeused.patch` is included. The main reason for the bump seems to be purely linked to the fact that the copyright was transferred to the FSF.

It remain to be seen if the removed functionality is used in sage at all.
