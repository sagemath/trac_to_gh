GLPK (GNU Linear Programming Kit) version 5.0
was released on 2020-12-16.

The last version was GLPK 4.65, released on 2018-02-16,
to which we upgraded in #24824.

From the release notes of GLPK 5.0:

> The copyright was transferred to the Free Software Foundation.

>
> To fix some licensing problems the routines in the following
> files were disabled by replacing with dummy ones that print an
> error message:
>
>- `src/api/gridgen.c`
>- `src/api/netgen.c`
>- `src/api/rmfgen.c`
>- `src/misc/qmd.c`
>- `src/misc/relax4.c`
>
> Note that this change does not affect
> the main functionality of the package.
>
> Some minor bugs were fixed.

It looks like the only significant change - packaging wise - is that the patch `dont_print_Longstepwillbeused.patch` is included. The main reason for the bump seems to be purely linked to the fact that the copyright was transferred to the FSF.

It remain to be seen if the removed functionality is used in sage at all.
