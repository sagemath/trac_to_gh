GLPK (GNU Linear Programming Kit) version 5.0
was released on 2020-12-16.

The last version was GLPK 4.65, released on 2018-02-16,
to which we upgraded in #24824.

From the release notes of GLPK 5.0:

> The copyright was transferred to the Free Software Foundation.

>
> To fix some licensing problems the routines in the following
> files were disabled by replacing with dummy ones that print an
> error message:

>
> - `src/api/gridgen.c`
> - `src/api/netgen.c`
> - `src/api/rmfgen.c`
> - `src/misc/qmd.c`
> - `src/misc/relax4.c`
 
>
> Note that this change does not affect
> the main functionality of the package.

>
> Some minor bugs were fixed.

It remain to be seen if the removed functionality is used in sage at all.
