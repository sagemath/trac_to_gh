While `solve_mod` explicitly states

> Each equation must involve only polynomials  in 1 or many variables.


it might be helpful to have a test for that particular error with, say, a discrete log thing like `solve_mod(5^x==2,23)` or the like.  People often read the documentation too quickly, but if they then come back and find the error already in the doc, it can be useful, and point them to a better command, such as `discrete_log(2,mod(5,23))`, in that case, which will also detect when there is not a solution.
