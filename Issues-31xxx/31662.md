We transform `build/sage_bootstrap` to a new pip-installable distribution **sage-bootstrap** (with source dir `SAGE_ROOT/pkgs/sage-bootstrap`). 

Other bits from SAGE_ROOT and `build/` become package data of this distribution, for now via symlinks.

```
SAGE_ROOT
- pkgs
  - sage-bootstrap
    - setup.py
    - sage_bootstrap/
      - bin/
      - sage_root_source/
        - configure.ac -> SAGE_ROOT/configure.ac
        - m4/          -> SAGE_ROOT/m4
        - build/       -> SAGE_ROOT/build
        - ...
```

We put an sdist of the distribution 'sage-bootstrap' on PyPI, to give users easy access to commands such as `sage-print-system-package-command`. This can be useful for other projects that want to generate system package advice.
