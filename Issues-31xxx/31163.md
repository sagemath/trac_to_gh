Then scripts like `build/pkgs/perl_cpan_polymake_prereq/spkg-install` can be removed.

This will help toward #31522 - because the GH Actions scripts can just avoid trying to install these packages.

A small issue: running `./sage -i graphviz` prints this at the end:

```
The following package(s) may have failed to build (not necessarily
during this run of 'make graphviz'):

It is safe to delete any log files and build directories, but they
contain information that is helpful for debugging build problems.
WARNING: If you now run 'make' again, the build directory of the
same version of the package will, by default, be deleted. Set the
environment variable SAGE_KEEP_BUILT_SPKGS=yes to prevent this.
```
Should `sage --info ...` also write the output to a log file with an appropriate error so that it gets flagged in this message?

Also, and I'm guessing this is beyond the scope of this ticket, but on my Mac I did `brew install graphviz` and then `./configure`, and it said

```
configure:43560: result: graphviz-none:                               using system package; SPKG will not be installed
```
It would be nice if `make graphviz` said that it was already installed as a system package, rather than giving the same error message as if it weren't installed.

It also used to say:

```
perl_cpan_polymake_prereq-none:              no suitable system package; optional, use "./configure --enable-perl_cpan_polymake_prereq" to install
```

I just made some improvements to both of these messages. I am now getting:

```
pandoc-none:                                 using system package
...
perl_cpan_polymake_prereq-none:              no suitable system package; optional
```

Also I have removed the useless configure options `--enable-perl_cpan_polymake_prereq` (whose only function was to provoke an error at `make` time) -- so they are no longer shown in `./configure --help`.

This wouldn't be consistent with what `make SPKG` does for installable packages: When the system package is in use, `make SPKG` will nevertheless build the SPKG.

We unfortunately do not have make targets that would mean "make sure that SPKG exists, either as system package or a built package" -- see #31501 for this
