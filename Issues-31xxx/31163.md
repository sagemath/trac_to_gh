Then scripts like `build/pkgs/perl_cpan_polymake_prereq/spkg-install` can be removed.

This will help toward #31522 - because the GH Actions scripts can just avoid trying to install these packages.

It also used to say:

```
perl_cpan_polymake_prereq-none:              no suitable system package; optional, use "./configure --enable-perl_cpan_polymake_prereq" to install
```

I just made some improvements to both of these messages. I am now getting:

```
pandoc-none:                                 using system package
...
perl_cpan_polymake_prereq-none:              no suitable system package; optional
```

Also I have removed the useless configure options `--enable-perl_cpan_polymake_prereq` (whose only function was to provoke an error at `make` time) -- so they are no longer shown in `./configure --help`.

This wouldn't be consistent with what `make SPKG` does for installable packages: When the system package is in use, `make SPKG` will nevertheless build the SPKG.

We unfortunately do not have make targets that would mean "make sure that SPKG exists, either as system package or a built package" -- see #31501 for this
