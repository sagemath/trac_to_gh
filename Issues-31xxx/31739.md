```
In Sage 9.3.rc4, we get the incorrect

```
sage: exp(2*atanh(x))
(x + 1)/(x - 1)
```

The correct answer is (1 + x)/(1 - x) so we expect:

```
sage: exp(2*atanh(x))
-(x + 1)/(x - 1)
```

Similarly, we get the incorrect

```
sage: exp(2*acoth(x))
(x - 1)/(x + 1)
```

while we expect:

```
sage: exp(2*acoth(x))
(x + 1)/(x - 1)
```

The bug is in Pynac. A fix is provided at

- [Pynac pull request 374: Fix exp of inverse hyperbolic functions](https://github.com/pynac/pynac/pull/374)

The upgrade to Pynac 0.7.29, which has the change,
is done in #31694, merged in Sage 9.4.beta5.

This ticket adds doctests as examples.

I proposed a fix to Pynac, see link in ticket description.

We should either apply it here as a patch
or wait for a new Pynac release with the fix.

We should also add doctests.

Thanks Dima for merging my pull request in Pynac.

I'm adding examples in `src/sage/functions/hyperbolic.py`.
Having added the examples in the file's main docstring,
I skipped mentioning the ticket number, which I would
have done if I had put the doctests in TESTS blocks.
Hope that's okay.

Follow-up Pynac issue for the case c = 1 at
