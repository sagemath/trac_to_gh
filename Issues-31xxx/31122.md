I am trying to get this result from Wolfram Alpha:

![](https://www5a.wolframalpha.com/Calculate/MSP/MSP21524965ia66h299a9d00001af0hg64d139ccf6?MSPStoreType=image/gif&s=49)

This is what I've tried using [SageMath](../wiki/SageMath) version 9.3beta4:


```
x, y = var('x y')

f(x, y) = 2 * y * exp(-x^3)

# method 1
f(x, y).integrate(x, y, oo).integrate(y, 0, oo)

# method 2
f(x, y).integrate(x, y, oo, algorithm='giac').integrate(y, 0, oo, algorithm='giac')

# method 3
f(x, y).integrate(x, y, oo, algorithm='sympy').integrate(y, 0, oo, algorithm='sympy')
```

The first method throws a runtime exception and asks for assumptions about y. The second method and third method returns an unevaluated integral.

Is there some arguments I need to pass to `integrate()` to get the expected answer?
