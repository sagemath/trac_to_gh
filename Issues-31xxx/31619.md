As promised in #13674, I refactor some things to support `cholesky()` and `is_positive_definite()` over inexact rings. The main idea is to use the `block_ldlt()` method that supports inexact rings instead of `indefinite_factorization()` which does not.

Controversial bits:

1. The `certificate` argument to `is_positive_definite()` has been removed. This lets us unify the interface and implementation with `is_positive_semidefinite()`. If the user wants the factorization (which is all the certificate was), he can still ask for it directly.

2. I've left the `indefinite_factorization` method alone even though it is largely superseded by `block_ldlt(classical=True)`. Does anyone want to factorize complex matrices that are symmetric but not hermitian? How about symmetric matrices over finite fields where "conjugate" is meaningless? If not, we could deprecate/remove `indefinite_factorization()`. But I know little about what people do with matrices over finite fields.

3. I've declared that every constant, non-relational symbolic expression is a square in `SR`. This is not really principled; it just sounds true, and makes `cholesky()` work with symbolic matrices whose entries are "numbers".

<a id='comment:2'></a>I am not sure about dropping the `certificate` from `is_positive_definite()`. I would lean towards adding one for `is_positive_semidefinite()` to make it consistent. At the very least, it will require a deprecation.

I cannot comment on 2 or 3.

I would change this block:

```
-        for d_i in d:
-            if d_i.nrows() == 1:
-                if semi:
-                    if d_i < 0:
-                        return False
-                else:
-                    if d_i <= 0:
-                        return False
-            else:
-                # There's a 2x2 block
-                return False
-        return True
+        if semi:
+            return not any(d_i.nrows() > 1 or d_i < 0 for d_i in d)
+        else:
+            return not any(d_i.nrows() > 1 or d_i <= 0 for d_i in d)
```
Also, would it be better to do `d_i[0,0]` so the actual entry is checked? Another alternative would be

```
return all(d_i.nrows() == 1 and d_i >= 0 for d_i in d)
```
and similarly for the positive definite case. IMO this is a more clear than the negative test.

The real problem here is that `certificate` is returning an implementation detail, namely the `indefinite_factorization()` that was computed to check the eigenvalues.In order to make `is_positive_definite()` numerically stable, I've already changed that implementation detail -- there's no indefinite factorization to return. I could return the `block_ldlt()` factorization, but if anyone is actually using the certificate, that's still going to mess them up. So the interface is broken either way. (And if no one was using `certificate`, it makes a lot more sense in the future for users to compute the factorization themselves.)

A related problem is that the `certificate` argument to the superclass method can't always be honored in subclasses. There is no `certificate` argument for `RDF` or `CDF` matrices, for example. If `is_positive_definite()` is ever implemented for some other subclass using a C library, that C library is certainly not going to return an `indefinite_factorization()`, so what can we do if the user wants a certificate?

If we have to deprecate it first, then we have to continue using `indefinite_factorization()`, which means we can't make it numerically stable (or work with rings like `SR` and `RR`) until the deprecation period is over.

That wasn't intentional so I'm glad you noticed it.

I went one further and replaced this with

```python
       import operator
       op = operator.gt
       if semi:
           op = operator.ge
       return all(d_i.nrows() == 1 and op(d_i[0,0], 0) for d_i in d)
```

to minimize duplication. It's a lot clearer now, thanks.

I don't really like it, but I've added a commit that implements this to minimize the amount of back-and-forth that we have to do. I feel like a two-stage deprecation/removal cycle is just going to annoy people *twice* -- once when the format of the certificate changes on them, and then again when it goes away for real.

I've also finally taken the time to go over the documentation of `is_positive_definite()` and `cholesky()`, updated in two new commits.

I'm not sure what to do about this. I agree that it makes sense, but I really don't want to make  `block_ldlt()` as awkward as `indefinite_factorization()` without a good reason.

> I don't really like it, but I've added a commit that implements this to minimize the amount of back-and-forth that we have to do. I feel like a two-stage deprecation/removal cycle is just going to annoy people *twice* -- once when the format of the certificate changes on them, and then again when it goes away for real.


Thank you. If they get annoyed twice, then they didn't read the deprecation message and it is their own fault IMO.

I am happy with the current patch. Dima, how about you? (If I really wanted to quibble, we could change the `Returns` -> `Return` in `cholesky()` since we are modifying its docstring anyways. However, that can be done only if there is another commit.)
